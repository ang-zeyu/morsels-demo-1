[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13615"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 6 (#18)"],[1,"    Age. How We Are Born_, by Mrs. N.J. (apparently a Russian lady      writing in English), prefaced by J.H. Badley, is satisfactory.      Mention may also be made of _The Wonder of Life_, by Mary Tudor      Pole. Margaret Morley's _Song of Life_, an American book, which I      have not seen, has been highly praised. Most of these books are      intended for quite young children, and while they explain more or      less clearly the origin of babies, nearly always starting with      the facts of plant life, they touch very slightly, if at all, on      the relations of the sexes.        Mrs. Ennis Richmond's books, largely addressed to mothers, deal      with these questions in a very sane, direct, and admirable      manner, and Canon Lyttelton's books, discussing such questions      generally, are also excellent. Most of the books now to be      mentioned are intended to be read by boys and girls who have      reached the age of puberty. They refer more or less precisely to      sexual relationships, and they usually touch on masturbation.      _The Story of Life_, written by a very accomplished woman, the      late Ellice Hopkins, is somewhat vague, and introduces too many      exalted religious ideas. Arthur Trewby's _Healthy Boyhood_ is a      little book of wholesome tendency; it deals specially with      masturbation. _A Talk with Boys About Themselves_ and _A Talk      with Girls About Themselves_, both by Edward Bruce Kirk (the      latter book written in conjunction with a lady) deal with general      as well as sexual hygiene. There could be no better book to put      into the hands of a boy or girl at puberty than M.A. Warren's      _Almost Fourteen_, written by an American school teacher in 1892.      It was a most charming and delicately written book, which could      not have offended the innocence of the most sensitive maiden.      Nothing, however, is sacred to prurience, and it was easy for the      prurient to capture the law and obtain (in 1897) legal      condemnation of this book as \"obscene.\" Anything which sexually      excites a prurient mind is, it is true, \"obscene\" for that mind,      for, as Mr. Theodore Schroeder remarks, obscenity is \"the      contribution of the reading mind,\" but we need such books as this      in order to diminish the number of prurient minds, and the      condemnation of so entirely admirable a book makes, not for      morality, but for immorality. I am told that the book was      subsequently issued anew with most of its best portions omitted,      and it is stated by Schroeder (_Liberty of Speech and Press      Essential to Purity Propaganda_, p. 34) that the author was      compelled to resign his position as a public school principal.      Maria Lischnewska's _Geschlechtliche Belehrung der Kinder_      (reprinted from _Mutterschutz_, 1905, Heft 4 and 5) is a most      admirable and thorough discussion of the whole question of sexual      education, though the writer is more interested in the teacher's      share in this question than in the mother's. Suggestions to      mothers are contained in Hugo Salus, _Wo kommen die Kinder her?_,      E. Stiehl, _Eine Mutterpflicht_, and many other books. Dr. Alfred      Kind strongly recommends Ludwig Gurlitt's _Der Verkehr mit meinem      Kindern_, more especially in its combination of sexual education      with artistic education. Many similar books are referred to by      Bloch, in his _Sexual Life of Our Time_, Ch. xxvi.        I have enumerated the names of these little books because they      are frequently issued in a semi-private manner, and are seldom      easy to procure or to hear of. The propagation of such books      seems to be felt to be almost a disgraceful action, only to be      performed by stealth. And such a feeling seems not unnatural when      we see, as in the case of the author of _Almost Fourteen_, that a      nominally civilized country, instead of loading with honors a man      who has worked for its moral and physical welfare, seeks so far      as it can to ruin him.        I may add that while it would usually be very helpful to a mother      to be acquainted with a few of the booklets I have named, she      would do well, in actually talking to her children, to rely      mainly on her own knowledge and inspiration.    The sexual education which it is the mother's duty and privilege to  initiate during her child's early years cannot and ought not to be  technical. It is not of the nature of formal instruction but is a private  and intimate initiation. No doubt the mother must herself be taught.[24]  But the education she needs is mainly an education in love and insight.  The actual facts which she requires to use at this early stage are very  simple. Her main task is to make clear the child's own intimate relations  to herself and to show that all young things have a similar intimate  relation to their mothers; in generalizing on this point the egg is the  simplest and most fundamental type to explain the origin of the individual  life, for the idea of the egg--in its widest sense as the seed--not only  has its truth for the human creature but may be applied throughout the  animal and vegetable world. In this explanation the child's physical  relationship to his father is not necessarily at first involved; it may be  left to a further stage or until the child's questions lead up to it.    Apart from his interest in his origin, the child is also interested in his  sexual, or as they seem to him exclusively, his excretory organs, and in  those of other people, his sisters and parents. On these points, at this  age, his mother may simply and naturally satisfy his simple and natural  curiosity, calling things by precise names, whether the names used are  common or uncommon being a matter in regard to which she may exercise her  judgment and taste. In this manner the mother will, indirectly, be able to  safeguard her child at the outset against the prudish and prurient notions  alike which he will encounter later. She will also without unnatural  stress be able to lead the child into a reverential attitude towards his  own organs and so exert an influence against any undesirable tampering  with them. In talking with him about the origin of life and about his own  body and functions, in however elementary a fashion, she will have  initiated him both in sexual knowledge and in sexual hygiene.    The mother who establishes a relationship of confidence with her child  during these first years will probably, if she possesses any measure of  wisdom and tact, be able to preserve it even after the epoch of puberty  into the difficult years of adolescence. But as an educator in the  narrower sense her functions will, in most cases, end at or before  puberty. A somewhat more technical and completely impersonal acquaintance  with the essential facts of sex then becomes desirable, and this would  usually be supplied by the school.        The great though capricious educator, Basedow, to some extent a      pupil of Rousseau, was an early pioneer in both the theory and      the practice of giving school children instruction in the facts      of the sexual life, from the age of ten onwards. He insists much      on this subject in his great treatise, the _Elementarwerk_      (1770-1774). The questions of children are to be answered      truthfully, he states, and they must be taught never to jest at      anything so sacred and serious as the sexual relations. They are      to be shown pictures of childbirth, and the dangers of sexual      irregularities are to be clearly expounded to them at the outset.      Boys are to be taken to hospitals to see the results of venereal      disease. Basedow is aware that many parents and teachers will be      shocked at his insistence on these things in his books and in his      practical pedagogic work, but such people, he declares, ought to      be shocked at the Bible (see, e.g., Pinloche, _La Reforme de      l'Education en Allemagne au dixhuitieme siecle: Basedow et le      Philanthropinisme_, pp. 125, 256, 260, 272). Basedow was too far      ahead of his own time, and even of ours, to exert much influence      in this matter, and he had few immediate imitators.        Somewhat later than Basedow, a distinguished English physician,      Thomas Beddoes, worked on somewhat the same lines, seeking to      promote sexual knowledge by lectures and demonstrations. In his      remarkable book, _Hygeia_, published in 1802 (vol. i, Essay IV)      he sets forth the absurdity of the conventional requirement that      \"discretion and ignorance should lodge in the same bosom,\" and      deals at length with the question of masturbation and the need of      sexual education. He insists on the great importance of lectures      on natural history which, he had found, could be given with      perfect propriety to a mixed audience. His experiences had shown      that botany, the amphibia, the hen and her eggs, human anatomy,      even disease and sometimes the sight of it, are salutary from      this point of view. He thinks it is a happy thing for a child to      gain his first knowledge of sexual difference from anatomical      subjects, the dignity of death being a noble prelude to the      knowledge of sex and depriving it forever of morbid prurience.      It is scarcely necessary to remark that this method of teaching      children the elements of sexual anatomy in the _post-mortem_ room      has not found many advocates or followers; it is undesirable, for      it fails to take into account the sensitiveness of children to      such impressions, and it is unnecessary, for it is just as easy      to teach the dignity of life as the dignity of death.        The duty of the school to impart education in matters of sex to      children has in recent years been vigorously and ably advocated      by Maria Lischnewska (op. cit.), who speaks with thirty years'      experience as a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13618"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Peterborough (#18)"],[1,"of the details are well worthy of attention. We find  the Tudor rose and portcullis: the arms of S. Edward and of S. Edmund,  the Martyr King; an early instance in stone of the Prince of Wales'  feathers; and the triangular symbol of the Holy Trinity. The date is  about 1520.    Through an open archway to the east we enter the burial ground. Until  1804 this was the only place of burial for the whole city. On the left  is the Deanery, but nothing of antiquity is to be seen from the  exterior. In the hall are some good fragments of old glass, some of it  probably part of the original embellishments of the house, though some  may have been brought from the Cathedral, and some is again quite  modern. Some panels of early date, brought from another room, have also  lately been put up in the hall. The churchyard has been planted with  trees and shrubs, and is well kept. It has, however, become much more  publicly used than was the case in the last century, owing to a  thoroughfare for foot-passengers which has been opened at the  north-western end of the close; and the usual results of such publicity  have followed in the treading down of the turf and in the damage  inflicted on the shrubs. One of the most striking views of the Cathedral  is seen from the north-eastern corner of the precincts, near the house  known as \"The Vineyard.\" This was the house occupied by the officers who  came down to superintend the spoliation of the building in 1643. This  view takes in the whole of the great length of the Cathedral, the  bell-tower and the north-western spire forming a very effective group.    Passing round the east end and proceeding to the south we come to the  ruins of the =Infirmary=. Here we may see some very excellent Early  English work, most elegant and graceful. It was erected about 1260. The  plan was similar to a large church with aisles. The nave was used as the  hall, the aisles were the quarters of the inmates, and the chancel was  the chapel of the institution. Many of the main arches remain, and the  details of the ornamentation and mouldings will repay careful study. At  the west end is a very perfect piece of arcading. The large arch, seen  above a low wall to the east, was the arch leading to the chapel; in  exactly the same position as the chancel arch in a church. At each side  of this arch is a lancet never pierced. The main arch is now blocked up,  forming a wall to one of the prebendal houses. The dining room of this  same house was the Infirmarer's house, and has much very interesting  Early English work. To the south of the Infirmary is another ancient  house, though much modernised.    Before entering the Cloister court we pass through the old slype, once a  simple vaulted passage, but now open to the sky. It was the means of  communication between the Refectory, which was situated to the west, and  the Chapter House, which was on the east side of the Cloister. Quite  recently some of the arches on the west side have been opened to view,  and interesting tracery brought to light.    The =Cloister Court= is always called the Laurel Court. The origin of  this name is not known. The northern part of the area covers the site of  the nave of the Saxon church; but though search was made, during the  recent works, for remains of the old foundations, nothing was  discovered. On the south and west sides are to be seen remains of the  arches and groining, but the appearance of the south wall of the  cathedral suggests that there could not have been any covered alley to  the north, so completely have all evidences of such an erection been  removed. But it is known that there did exist an alley there, when the  Cloisters were complete; for Gunton, describing it, says \"The Cloyster  about four square, in length 168 yards, in breadth 6 yards.\" The  windows, contrary to the usual practice, were all glazed, and they  contained a very fine series of painted glass, all destroyed in 1643.  Gunton gives the subjects:--\"The windows were all compleat and fair,  adorned with glass of excellent painting: In the South Cloyster was the  History of the Old Testament: In the East Cloyster of the New: In the  North Cloyster, the Figures of the successive Kings from King Peada: In  the West Cloyster, was the History from the foundation of the Monastery  of King Peada, to the restoring of it by King Edgar.\" Each light had two  lines of verse at the foot, explaining the subject matter of the glass  above. All the verses in the windows of the west alley are given; and  from this we gather that there were nine windows there of four lights  each. Although Gunton only gives the verses belonging to the west  cloister, yet as he said previously that \"every window had at the bottom  the explanation of the history thus in verse,\" it is supposed that  similar legends appeared in all the other alleys of the cloister. The  verses are very quaint.    [Illustration: Door to Palace Grounds from the Cloisters, 1797.]    [Illustration: Door way to Cathedral from the Cloisters.]    The archway at the south-eastern corner is very elegant, the open  quatrefoil above the round arch and below the pointed arch being  especially good. The south wall indicates that there were two sets of  cloisters here, as the remains of early English arcading are to be  clearly seen. Towards the west was the lavatory, the remains indicating  work of late fourteenth century date. It is on record that Robert of  Lindsey (1214-1222) erected a lavatory in the south cloister: this would  be contemporary with the Early English work remaining in this wall, and  with the archway to the slype; but it must have been removed when the  cloisters were enlarged, and another lavatory, of which we see the  remains under three arches, built in its stead. The Refectory was  immediately to the south of this wall: some beautiful carving is to be  seen in the Bishop's garden. The south-western doorway gives access to  the Bishop's grounds. The depth of the hollows behind the carved foliage  above the door is remarkable.    In the west wall are remains of a Norman cloister; there are three  arches and a door. From the architectural character it seems almost  certain that these are older than any part of the present Cathedral.  William of Waterville (1155-1175) \"built the Cloister and covered it  with lead.\" Canon Davys conjectures that this Abbot in reality repaired  and made sound the old cloisters that had been built by Ernulf  (1107-1115), \"whose recent additions to the buildings of the monastery,  we learn, alone escaped the fire, which consumed the other parts of the  Abbey in the time of John de Sais.\" One of these arches has the cheese  moulding; and on each jamb is a small incised cross, a very few inches  long. If these are consecration crosses they are the only ones that have  been noticed in any part of the Abbey.    On the wall of the building west of the south transept are some stone  brackets. These shew that after the destruction of the ancient cloister  a covered way of some kind was erected here. Marks can also be seen, in  the masonry, which indicate that the building once had three gables. Two  of the Norman buttresses of the south nave aisle have very curious  terminations, which might well puzzle any observer. They are fireplaces  for the use of plumbers. Passing through the Norman doorway at the  north-western corner of the Laurel Court, we come into a narrow passage  leading to the Minster Close.    [Illustration: Archway from Cloisters, North-West.]    In the =Bishop's Palace=, besides the remains of the Refectory, which,  though so scanty, shew what a beautiful building it once was, there is  very little worthy of note. The hall is a vaulted chamber, of no great  height, with piers to support the roof; most of it is part of the  Abbot's dwelling, and of thirteenth century date. The Heaven's Gate  Chamber, previously noticed, built by Abbot Kirton (1496-1528), lies to  the south-east of the hall. The chapel was erected by Bishop Magee soon  after he came to the diocese.    =The City.=--The mother church of S. John the Baptist is the only parish  church in the city of mediaeval date. Until 1856 it was the only parish  church in the place. Originally the church stood east of the Minster.  But, following what seems to be almost a universal law, the main  population spread westward as the number of inhabitants increased, and  the earlier buildings were left to the occupation of the poorer class.  An insignificant little house in the old town is traditionally said to  have been the Vicar's residence. It has some evidence of antiquity about  it. The present church was built early in the fifteenth century. It was  opened in 1407 with much solemnity by Abbot Genge. It is a spacious and  dignified building, having a nave of seven bays; and there are two bays  to the chancel, besides the sanctuary. The west tower is good, but  hardly of sufficient dignity for such a church. The interior was  reseated, and new roofs were added in 1883; they were designed by the  late Mr. Pearson.    In 1891 the south porch was restored in memory of Dr. James, a former  vicar. The arches under the tower which had been bricked up for many  years were underpinned and repaired; and in 1909 were again opened to  the church. By 1919 the fittings were almost complete, several rich  stained glass windows and beautiful oak screens had been given as  memorials. A carved reredos, oak panelling and seats, and a marble  pavement have been fitted in the Sanctuary. The organ was rebuilt and  enlarged by Messrs. Harrison of Durham.    Towards the west end of the church in the north aisle is a tablet to  William Squire by Flaxman; close by is a large picture of King Charles I  and two curious specimens of early embroidery are also to be seen; they  were once portions of altar-cloths, or of copes. In each case the work  is in the form of a cross, about two feet long. Each has the figure of  the"]]]
