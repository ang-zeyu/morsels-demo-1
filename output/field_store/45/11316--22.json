The king replied, that he would see the stranger in the  evening, and ordered an attendant to procure him a lodging, and  prevent annoyance from the crowd. Mr. Park was conducted into a large  hut, in which he had scarcely seated himself, than the mob entered,  it being found impossible to keep them out, and when one party had  seen him, and asked a few questions, they retired, and another  succeeded, party after party, during the greater part of the day.    The king, whose name was Koorabarri, now sent for Mr. Park, who  followed the messenger through a number of courts, surrounded with  high walls. Mr. Park was astonished at the number of the king's  attendants: they were all seated, the men on the king's right hand,  and the women and children on the left. The king was not  distinguished from his subjects by any superiority of dress, being  seated on a leopard's skin, spread upon a bank of earth, about two  feet high. Mr. Park seated himself upon the ground before him, and  relating the causes that induced him to pass through his country,  solicited his protection. The king replied, that he could at present  afford him but little assistance, all communication between Kaarta  and Bambarra being cut off; and Monsong, king of Bambarra, with his  army on his march to Kaarta, there was little hope of reaching  Bambarra by the direct route, for coming from an enemy's country, he  would certainly be plundered or taken for a spy. Under these  circumstances he did not wish him to remain at Kaarta, but advised  him to return to Kasson till the war was at an end, when, if he  survived the contest, he would bestow every attention on the  traveller, but if he should fall, his sons would take him under their  care.    Mr. Park dreaded the thoughts of passing the rainy season in the  interior of Africa, and was averse to return to Europe, without  having made further discoveries, he therefore rejected the well-meant  advice of the king, and requested his majesty to allow a man to  accompany him as near the frontiers of Kaarta as was consistent with  safety. The king, finding he was resolved to proceed, told him that  one route, though not wholly free from danger, still remained, which  was first to go into the Moorish kingdom of Luda-mar, and thence by a  circuitous route to Jarra, the frontier town of Ludamar. He then  inquired of Mr. Park how he had been treated since he left the  Gambia, and jocularly asked him how many slaves he expected to take  home with him on his return. He was, however interrupted by the  arrival of a man mounted on a fine moorish horse covered with sweat  and foam, who having something of importance to communicate, the king  immediately took up his sandals, which is the signal for strangers to  retire. Mr. Park accordingly took leave, but afterwards learned that  this messenger was one of the scouts employed to watch the motions of  the enemy, and had brought intelligence that the Bambarra army was  approaching Kaarta.    In the evening the king sent to the stranger a fine sheep, a very  acceptable gift, as they had not broken their fast during the whole  of the day. At this time, evening prayers were announced, by beating  on drums, and blowing through hollowed elephants' teeth; the sound of  which was melodious, and nearly resembled the human voice. On the  following morning, Mr. Park sent his horse-pistols and holsters as a  present to the king, and informed him that he wished to leave Kemmoo  as soon as he could procure a guide. In about an hour the king  returned thanks for his present, and sent a party of horsemen to  conduct him to Jarra. On that night he slept at a village called  Marena, where, during the night, some thieves broke into the hut  where the baggage was deposited, cut open one of Mr. Park's bundles,  and stole a quantity of beads, part of his clothes, some amber and  gold. The following day was far advanced before they recommenced  their journey, and the excessive heat obliged them to travel but  slowly. In the evening they arrived at the village of Toorda, when  all the king's people turned back with the exception of two, who  remained to guide Mr. Park and his attendants to Jarra.    On the 15th of February they departed from Toorda, and about two  o'clock came to a considerable town called Funing-kedy, where being  informed that the road to Jarra was much infested by the moors, and  that a number of people were going to that town on the following  day, Mr. Park resolved to stay and accompany them. Accordingly in the  afternoon of the 17th of February, accompanied by thirty people, he  left Funing-kedy, it being necessary to travel in the night to avoid  the moorish banditti. At midnight they stopped near a small village,  but the thermometer being so low as 68 deg., none of the negroes could  sleep on account of the cold. They resumed their journey at daybreak,  and in the morning passed Simbing, the frontier village of Ludamar.    From this village Major Houghton wrote his last letter, with a  pencil, to Dr. Laidley, having been deserted by his negro servants,  who refused to follow him into the moorish country. This brave but  unfortunate man, having surmounted many difficulties, had endeavoured  to pass through the kingdom of Ludamar, where Mr. Park learned the  following particulars concerning his fate. On his arrival at Jarra,  he got acquainted with some moorish merchants, who were travelling to  Tisheel, a place celebrated for its salt pits in the great desert,  for the purpose of purchasing salt. It is supposed that the moors  deceived him, either in regard to the route he wished to pursue, or  the state of the country between Jarra and Timbuctoo, and their  intention probably was to rob and leave him in the desert. At the end  of two days he suspected their treachery, and insisted on returning  to Jarra. Finding him to persist in this determination, the moors  robbed him of every thing he possessed, and went off with their  camels; the major, being thus deserted, returned on foot to a  watering place called Tarra. He had been some days without food, and  the unfeeling moors refusing to give him any, he sunk at last under  his distresses. Whether he actually perished of hunger, or was  murdered by the savage Mahometans, is not certainly known. His body  was dragged into the woods, and Mr. Park was shown at a distance, the  spot where his remains were left to perish.    Leaving Simbing, the travellers arrived in safety at Jarra, which is  a large town situate at the bottom of rocky hills; the houses being  built of clay and stones intermixed, the former answering the purpose  of mortar. It forms part of the moorish kingdom of Ludamar, but the  majority of the inhabitants are negroes, who purchase a precarious  protection from the moors, in order to avert their depredations.    On Mr. Park's arrival at Jarra, he obtained a lodging at the house of  Daman Jumma, a Gambia slatee, to whom he had an order from Dr.  Laidley for a debt of the value of six slaves. Daman readily  acknowledged the debt, but said he was afraid he could not pay more  than two slaves' value. He was, however, very useful to Mr. Park, by  procuring his beads and amber to be exchanged for gold, which being  more portable, was more easily concealed from the moors.    The difficulties, which they had  already encountered, and the savage  deportment of the moors, had completely frightened Mr. Park's  attendants, and they declared they would not proceed one step further  to the eastward. In this situation, Mr. Park applied to Daman, to  obtain from Ali, king of Ludamar, a safe conduct into Bambarra, and  he hired one of Daman's slaves to guide him thither, as soon as the  passport should be obtained. A messenger was despatched to Ali, then  encamped near Benown, and Mr. Park sent that prince, as a present,  five garments of cotton cloth purchased from Daman. On the 26th of  February, one of Ali's slaves arrived, as he said, to conduct Mr.  Park as far as Goomba, and demanded one garment of blue cotton cloth  for his attendance. About this time the negro boy Demba declared,  that he would never desert his master, although he wished that he  would turn back, to which he was strongly recommended by Johnson, who  had declared his reluctance to proceed.    On the following day, Mr. Park delivered a copy of his papers to  Johnson, to convey them to Gambia with all possible expedition, and  he left in Daman's possession various articles, which he considered  not necessary to take with him. He then left Jarra, accompanied by  his faithful boy, the slave sent by king Ali, and one of Daman's  slaves. Without meeting with any occurrence of note, Mr. Park arrived  on the 1st of March at a large town called Deena, inhabited by a  greater proportion of moors than of negroes. Mr. Park lodged in a hut  belonging to one of the latter. The moors, however, assembled round  it, and treated him with every sort of indignity, with a view to  irritate him, and afford them a pretence for pillaging his baggage.  Finding, however, their attempts ineffectual, they at last declared  that the property of a Christian was lawful plunder to the followers  of Mahomet, and accordingly opened his bundles, and robbed him of  every thing they chose.    Mr. Park spent the 2nd of March, in endeavouring to prevail on his  people to proceed with him, but so great was their dread of the  moors, that they absolutely refused. Accordingly, the next morning,  about two o'clock, Mr. Park proceeded alone on his adventurous  journey. He had not, however, got above half a mile from Deena, when  he heard some one calling after him, and on looking back, saw his  faithful boy running after him. He was informed by the boy, that  Ali's man had set out for Benown, but Daman's negro was still at  Deena, but that if his master would stop a little, he could persuade  the latter to join "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12668"],[0,"An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, Volume 2 (#18)"],[1," so completely sick of their  journey, and of the prospect before them, that they requested to return  with the soldiers, whose mission here terminated, being ordered to leave  them at this place in the direction of the guides; one man only expressed  a resolution to persevere, and penetrate further into the country, and  was left with them for that purpose.    The history of these people might well be supposed to end here; but their  restless dispositions were not calculated to remain long in peace.    It will be seen, on recurring to the transactions of the month of October  last, that a boat belonging to a settler had been carried off in the  night, by some people who were supposed to have taken her out to sea,  where, from the weakness of the boat, they must soon have perished: but  they were now heard of again. Owen Cavanagh, a free man, had a boat which  he employed in transporting grain from the Hawkesbury to Sydney. On the  10th of this month, he informed the governor, that, a short time before,  his boat had been boarded in the night, off Mullett Island, by the very  people who had stolen the one from the settler, and carried her off, with  another containing fifty bushels of grain which some other person was  bringing to Sydney. One man, who had, against his wish, been concerned in  the first seizure, now left them, and returned with Cavanagh; and from  him the following account of their proceedings was obtained. Having  effected the capture, they proceeded to the southward, with the intention  of reaching the wreck of the ship _Sydney Cove_. For their guide,  they had a pocket compass, of which scarcely one man of the fourteen who  composed the party knew the use. In this boat they were twice thrown on  shore, and at last reached an island, where, had they not fortunately  found many birds and seals, they must inevitably have perished. From the  inconceivable hardships they underwent, they would to a man have gladly  returned, could they have hoped that their punishment would have been any  thing short of death. Finding it impossible for such a number of  discontented beings to continue of one mind, or to be able to furnish  food in their miserable situation for so many, they judged it necessary,  from a motive of self-preservation, that one half should deceive the  other half; and while these were asleep, those who were prepared took  away the boat, leaving their seven wretched and unsuspecting companions  upon the desolate island, the situation of which this man could not  describe so as to enable the governor at any time to find it. Their  number now being reduced to seven, and thinking themselves in danger near  this port, they had been lurking for some time about Broken Bay, with a  view of capturing a better boat loaded with grain from the Hawkesbury;  which they effected, first by taking the boat of Owen Cavanagh, the  support of whose wife and children it had long been. After securing him,  they took possession of a smaller boat, containing upwards of fifty  bushels of wheat; and, finding Cavanagh's the largest and best of the  two, they ran out about three or four leagues from the land, when they  shifted their prisoners into the smaller boat, and stood off to the  Northward; where it was very probable they would lose their boat, she  being of such a size, that if they should get her on shore by any  accident, they would not be able to launch her again, and must finally  perish.    Here we find extreme ignorance, accompanied by great cunning, producing  cruelty; for nothing less can be said of their abandoning the miserable  uninformed companions of their crime. Self-preservation was their plea;  but was there not a method left within their reach, which might have  preserved the whole? Might they not have returned to Sydney, and thrown  themselves upon that mercy which they had so often seen exercised in the  settlement. Could it be imagined, that at this day there was existing in  a polished civilised kingdom a race of beings (for they do not deserve  the appellation of men) so extremely ignorant, and so little humanised as  these were, compared with whom the naked savages of the mountains were an  enlightened people?    Occasional desertions of one or two people at a time had occurred since  the establishment of the settlement; but the first convicts who arrived  from Ireland in the _Queen_ in the year 1791 went off in numerous  bodies, few of whom ever returned. They too were prepossessed with the  possibility of penetrating through the woods to China, and imparted the  same idea to all of their countrymen who came after them, engaging them  in the same act of folly and madness. It was not then to be wondered at,  that Wilson, who lately came in from the woods, should, among other  articles of information, mention his finding more than fifty skeletons,  which the natives assured him had been white men, who had lost their way  and perished. This account was corroborated by different European  articles which were scattered about, such as knives, old shoes, and other  things which were known not to belong to the natives.    On the 20th the _Francis_ returned with Captain Hamilton from the  southward. Previous to his departure for the wreck of his ship, he had  informed the governor that she had on board nearly 7000 gallons of  spirits, and solicited permission to bring back a part with him in the  schooner. The governor, ever averse to the introduction of spirituous  liquors, would certainly have resisted the application; but, it being  generally known in the colony that a considerable quantity of this  article had been saved from the wreck, and that the island abounded with  kangaroos and birds, he conceived these circumstances not only to have  conduced to those desertions and captures of boats which had been  effected, but as likely to prove farther temptations to similar  practices. He therefore determined to purchase the rum of Captain  Hamilton; and, as there was none in store for the public service, to take  it on account of government. An agreement was accordingly entered into by  the commissary, and 3500 gallons were brought round in the _Francis_.    Captain Hamilton stated, that of all the other articles which had been  taken on shore from the wreck, a small quantity of coarse cloth alone had  been saved, the remainder having been destroyed by gales of wind and bad  weather. The wreck of the ship was entirely washed away. Of the six  Lascars who had been left with the property, one had died; the other five  were in health, and had lived tolerably well, killing upon a neighbouring  island as many kangaroos and birds as they could use. These poor fellows  had erected a smoke-house, and had salted and smoke-dried as much meat as  would serve them during the ensuing winter.    These people, though provided only with one small boat, had made some  excursions; and it appeared by their accounts, that this part of the  coast of New South Wales was formed entirely by a group of islands,  extending as far as they had seen to the westward of them, and  interspersed with many shoals. Hence, and indeed from observations which  he had made when on that part of the coast himself, the governor thought  it highly probable that there were many passages or straits quite through  to the ocean westward, making Van Diemen's land, the southernmost part of  New Holland, an island.    Captain Hamilton had left a cow with his people, but she had died; a mare  that he had been more fortunate with was brought away in the _Francis_.    Notwithstanding the severe trial which Cole-be had been put to for the  death of Ye-ra-ni-be, the friends of that young man had not thought it  sufficient to atone for his loss. One of them, Mo-roo-bra, in company  with some other natives, meeting with Cole-be, made an attack upon him,  with a determination to put an end to the business and his life together.  Cole-be, not yet recovered of the wounds that he had received in the last  affair, was unable to make much resistance; and, after receiving several  blows on the head, was supposed to have been dispatched; but Mo-roo-bra,  as they were quitting him, seeing him revive, and attempting to rise,  returned to finish this savage business; which so exasperated another  native, that he snatched up a spear, and in a rage threw it with all his  force at Mo-roo-bra. The spear entered his right side, just over the hip  bone, and went inclining downwards quite through the body, penetrating  the bladder in its passage. Of this wound he died in about an hour. On  the same evening this generous fellow was attacked by the friends of the  deceased in the usual way; and, as might be expected, defended himself  with great gallantry. He was, however, speared twice through the thigh,  once through the leg, and received a bad wound in the right hand. The  spear entered at the side of the hand, rather on the back part of it,  came out in the palm, entered again under the ball of the thumb, and came  out on the back of the hand, near the tendon of the forefinger. The very  little inflammation that attended these painful wounds was remarkable.    Both the officiating magistrates at Sydney being at this time much  indisposed, so great an inconvenience was felt, that the governor found  it necessary, through the want of other magistrates, to take upon himself  the execution of some part of their troublesome office. It must be  observed, that the governor for the time being is a justice of the peace,  by virtue of his Majesty's letters patent.    Towards the latter end of the month, he went up to Parramatta, attended  by his aid-de-camp, to examine the progress of the works carrying on  there.    While on this service, an Irish convict, who had escaped from his work,  and had been for some time missing, was brought in. He had wandered about  for several days in search of a road which he expected to have found, and  which was to have conducted him"]]]
