It was the god Khnemu who assisted Thoth in performing  the commands of God at the creation, and one very interesting sculpture  at Philae shows Khnemu in the act of fashioning man upon a potter's  wheel. The deceased, in mentioning Khnemu's name, seems to invoke his  aid in the judgment as fashioner of man and as the being who is in some  respects responsible for the manner of his life upon earth.    In Chapter 30A there is no mention made of the \"guardian of the  balance,\" and the deceased says, \"May naught stand up to oppose me in  judgment in the presence of the lords of things!\" The \"lords of things\"  may be either the \"lords of creation,\" _i.e._, the great cosmic gods, or  the \"lords of the affairs [of the hall of judgment],\" _i.e._, of the  trial. In this chapter the deceased addresses not Khnemu, but \"the gods  who dwell in the divine clouds, and who are exalted by reason of their  sceptres,\" that is to say, the four gods of the cardinal points, called  Mestha, H[=a]pi Tuamutef, and Qebhsennuf, who also presided over the  chief internal organs of the human body. Here, again, it seems as if the  deceased was anxious to make these gods in some way responsible for the  deeds done by him in his life, inasmuch as they presided, over the  organs that were the prime movers of his actions. In any case, he  considers them in, the light of intercessors, for he beseeches them to  \"speak fair words unto R[=a]\" on his behalf, and to make him to prosper  before the goddess Nehebka. In this case, the favour of R[=a], the  Sun-god, the visible emblem of the almighty and eternal God, is sought  for, and also that of the serpent goddess, whose attributes are not yet  accurately defined, but who has much to do with the destinies of the  dead. No mention whatever is made of the Lord of Amentet--Osiris.    Before we pass to the consideration of the manner in which the judgment  is depicted upon the finest examples of the illustrated papyri,  reference must be made to an interesting vignette in the papyri of  Nebseni [Footnote: British Museum, No. 9900.] and Amen-neb. [Footnote 2:  British Museum, No. 0964.] In both of these papyri we see a figure of  the deceased himself being weighed in the balance against his own heart  in the presence of the god Osiris. It seems probable that a belief was  current at one time in ancient Egypt concerning the possibility of the  body being weighed against the heart, with the view of finding out if  the former had obeyed the dictates of the latter; be that as it may,  however, it is quite certain that this remarkable variant of the  vignette of Chapter 30B had some special meaning, and, as it occurs in  two papyri which date from the XVIIIth dynasty, we are justified in  assuming that it represents a belief belonging to a much older period.  The judgment here depicted must, in any case, be different from that  which forms such a striking scene in the later illustrated papyri of the  XVIIIth and following dynasties.    We have now proved that the idea of the judgment of the dead was  accepted in religious writings as early as the IVth dynasty, about B.C.  3600, but we have to wait nearly two thousand years before we find it in  picture form. Certain scenes which are found in the Book of the Dead as  vignettes accompanying certain texts or chapters, _e.g._, the Fields of  Hetep, or the Elysian Fields, are exceedingly old, and are found on  sarcophagi of the XIth and XIIth dynasties; but the earliest picture  known of the Judgment Scene is not older than the XVIIIth dynasty. In  the oldest Theban papyri of the Book of the Dead no Judgment Scene is  forthcoming, and when we find it wanting in such authoritative documents  as the Papyrus of Nebseni and that of Nu, [Footnote: British Museum, No.  10,477.] we must take it for granted that there was some reason for its  omission. In the great illustrated papyri, in which, the Judgment Scene  is given in full, it will be noticed that it comes at the beginning of  the work, and that it is preceded by hymns and by a vignette. Thus, in  the Papyrus of Ani, [Footnote: British Museum, No. 10,470.] we have a  hymn to R[=a] followed by a vignette representing the sunrise, and a  hymn to Osiris; and in the Papyrus of Hunefer, [Footnote 2: British  Museum, No. 9901.] though the hymns are different, the arrangement is  the same. We are justified, then, in assuming that the hymns and the  Judgment Scene together formed an introductory section to the Book of  the Dead, and it is possible that it indicates the existence of the  belief, at least during the period of the greatest power of the priests  of Amen, from B.C. 1700 to B.C. 800, that the judgment of the dead for  the deeds done in the body preceded the admission of the dead into the  kingdom of Osiris. As the hymns which accompany the Judgment Scene are  fine examples of a high class of devotional compositions, a few  translations from some of them are here given.    HYMN TO R[=A]. [Footnote: See _The Chapters of Coming Forth by Day_, p.  7.]      \"Homage to thee, O thou who risest in Nu, [Footnote: The sky    personified.] and who at thy manifestation dost make the world bright    with light; the whole company of the gods sing hymns of praise unto    thee after thou hast come forth. The divine Merti [Footnote:    Literally, the Two Eyes, _i.e._, Isis and Nephthys.] goddesses who    minister unto thee cherish thee as King of the North and South, thou    beautiful and beloved Man-child. When, thou risest men and women live.    The nations rejoice in thee, and the Souls of Annu [Footnote: _i.e._,    R[=a], Shu and Tefnut.] (Heliopolis) sing unto thee songs of joy. The    Souls of the city of Pe, [Footnote: Part of the city of Buto    (Per-Uatchit). The souls of Pe were Horus, Mestha, H[=a]pi.] and the    Souls of the city of Nekhen [Footnote: _i.e._, Horus, Tuamutef, and    Qebhsennuf.] exalt thee, the apes of dawn adore thee, and all beasts    and cattle praise thee with one accord. The goddess Seba overthroweth    thine enemies, therefore hast thou rejoicing in thy boat; thy mariners    are content thereat. Thou hast attained unto the [= A]tet boat,    [Footnote: _i.e._, the boat in which the sun travels until noon.] and    thy heart swelleth with joy. O lord of the gods, when thou didst    create them they shouted for joy. The azure goddess Nut doth compass    thee on every side, and the god Nu floodeth thee with his rays of    light. O cast thou thy light upon me and let me see thy beauties, and    when thou goest forth over the earth I will sing praises unto thy fair    face. Thou risest in heaven's horizon, and thy disk is adored when it    resteth upon the mountain to give life unto the world.\"      \"Thou risest, thou risest, and thou comest forth from the god Nu. Thou    dost renew thy youth, and thou dost set thyself in the place where    thou wast yesterday. O thou divine Child, who didst create thyself, I    am not able [to describe] thee. Thou hast come with thy risings, and    thou hast made heaven and earth resplendent with thy rays of pure    emerald light. The land of Punt [Footnote: _i.e._, the land on each    side of the Red Sea and North-east Africa.] is established [to give]    the perfumes which, thou smellest with thy nostrils. Thou risest, O    marvellous Being, in heaven, and the two serpent-goddesses, Merti, are    established upon thy brow. Thou art the giver of laws, O thou lord of    the world and of all the inhabitants thereof; all the gods adore    thee.\"    HYMN TO OSIRIS [Footnote: See _The Chapters of Coming Forth by Day_, p.  11.]      \"Glory be to thee, O Osiris Un-nefer, the great god within Abydos,    king of eternity and lord of everlastingness, the god who passest    through millions of years in thy existence. Thou art the eldest son of    the womb of Nut, thou wast engendered by Seb, the Ancestor of the    gods, thou art the lord of the Crowns of the North and of the South,    and of the lofty white crown. As Prince of the gods and of men thou    hast received the crook, and the whip, and the dignity of thy divine    fathers. Let thy heart which is in the mountain of Ament [Footnote:    _i.e._, the underworld.] be content, for thy son Horus is established    upon thy throne. Thou art crowned the lord of Tattu (Mendes) and ruler    in Abtu (Abydos). Through thee the world waxeth green in triumph    before the might of Neb-er-tcher. [Footnote: A name of Osiris.] Thou    leadest in thy train that which is, and that which is not yet, in thy    name of 'Ta-her-sta-nef;' thou towest along the earth in thy name of    'Seker;' thou art exceedingly mighty and most terrible in thy name of    'Osiris;' thou endurest for ever and for ever in thy name of    'Un-nefer.'\"      \"Homage to thee, O thou King of kings, Lord of lords, Prince of    Princes! From the womb of Nut thou hast ruled the world and the    underworld. Thy body is of bright and shining metal, thy head is of    azure blue, and the brilliance of the turquoise encircleth thee. O    thou god An, who hast had existence for millions of years, who    pervadest all things with thy body, who art beautiful in countenance    in the Land of Holiness (_i.e._, the underworld), grant thou to me    splendour in heaven, might upon earth, and triumph in the underworld.    Grant thou that I may sail down to Tattu like a living soul, and up to    Abtu like the phoenix; and grant that I may enter in and come forth    from the pylons of the lands of the underworld without let or    hindrance.

And shall I  now be browbeaten by a chitty-faced girl?--I have not given you a  fortune! Damn you! who brought you up? I will make you a bill for  clothing and lodging.

And, in a concern that is so completely my own, shall my  will go for nothing? Would you lay down this rule for yourself, and  suffer no other creature to take the benefit of it? I want nothing of  you: how dare you refuse me the privilege of a reasonable being, to live  unmolested in poverty and innocence? What sort of a man do you show  yourself, you that lay claim to the respect and applause of every one  that knows you?\"    The spirited reproaches of Emily had at first the effect to fill Mr.  Tyrrel with astonishment, and make him feel abashed and overawed in the  presence of this unprotected innocent. But his confusion was the result  of surprise. When the first emotion wore off, he cursed himself for  being moved by her expostulations; and was ten times more exasperated  against her, for daring to defy his resentment at a time when she had  every thing to fear. His despotic and unforgiving propensities  stimulated him to a degree little short of madness. At the same time his  habits, which were pensive and gloomy, led him to meditate a variety of  schemes to punish her obstinacy. He began to suspect that there was  little hope of succeeding by open force, and therefore determined to  have recourse to treachery.    He found in Grimes an instrument sufficiently adapted to his purpose.  This fellow, without an atom of intentional malice, was fitted, by the  mere coarseness of his perceptions, for the perpetration of the greatest  injuries. He regarded both injury and advantage merely as they related  to the gratifications of appetite; and considered it an essential in  true wisdom, to treat with insult the effeminacy of those who suffer  themselves to be tormented with ideal misfortunes. He believed that no  happier destiny could befal a young woman than to be his wife; and he  conceived that that termination would amply compensate for any  calamities she might suppose herself to undergo in the interval. He was  therefore easily prevailed upon, by certain temptations which Mr. Tyrrel  knew how to employ, to take part in the plot into which Miss Melville  was meant to be betrayed.    Matters being thus prepared, Mr. Tyrrel proceeded, through the means of  the gaoler (for the experience he already had of personal discussion did  not incline him to repeat his visits), to play upon the fears of his  prisoner. This woman, sometimes under the pretence of friendship, and  sometimes with open malice, informed Emily, from time to time, of the  preparations that were making for her marriage. One day, \"the squire had  rode over to look at a neat little farm which was destined for the  habitation of the new-married couple;\" and at another, \"a quantity of  live stock and household furniture was procured, that every thing might  be ready for their reception.\" She then told her \"of a licence that was  bought, a parson in readiness, and a day fixed for the nuptials.\" When  Emily endeavoured, though with increased misgivings, to ridicule these  proceedings as absolutely nugatory without her consent, her artful  gouvernante related several stories of forced marriages, and assured her  that neither protestations, nor silence, nor fainting, would be of any  avail, either to suspend the ceremony, or to set it aside when  performed.    The situation of Miss Melville was in an eminent degree pitiable. She  had no intercourse but with her persecutors. She had not a human being  with whom to consult, who might afford her the smallest degree of  consolation and encouragement. She had fortitude; but it was neither  confirmed nor directed by the dictates of experience. It could not  therefore be expected to be so inflexible, as with better information it  would, no doubt, have been found. She had a clear and noble spirit; but  she had some of her sex's errors. Her mind sunk under the uniform  terrors with which she was assailed, and her health became visibly  impaired.    Her firmness being thus far undermined, Grimes, in pursuance of his  instructions, took care, in his next interview, to throw out an  insinuation that, for his own part, he had never cared for the match,  and since she was so averse to it, would be better pleased that it  should never take place. Between one and the other however, he was got  into a scrape, and now he supposed he must marry, will he, nill he. The  two squires would infallibly ruin him upon the least appearance of  backwardness on his part, as they were accustomed to do every inferior  that resisted their will. Emily was rejoiced to find her admirer in so  favourable a disposition; and earnestly pressed him to give effect to  this humane declaration. Her representations were full of eloquence and  energy. Grimes appeared to be moved at the fervency of her manner; but  objected the resentment of Mr. Tyrrel and his landlord. At length,  however, he suggested a project, in consequence of which he might assist  her in her escape, without its ever coming to their knowledge, as,  indeed, there was no likelihood that their suspicions would fix upon  him. \"To be sure,\" said he, \"you have refused me in a disdainful sort of  a way, as a man may say. Mayhap you thought I was no better 'an a brute:  but I bear you no malice, and I will show you that I am more  kind-hearted 'an you have been willing to think. It is a strange sort of  a vagary you have taken, to stand in your own light, and disoblige all  your friends. But if you are resolute, do you see? I scorn to be the  husband of a lass that is not every bit as willing as I; and so I will  even help to put you in a condition to follow your own inclinations.\"    Emily listened to these suggestions at first with eagerness and  approbation. But her fervency somewhat abated, when they came to discuss  the minute parts of the undertaking. It was necessary, as Grimes  informed her, that her escape should be effected in the dead of the  night. He would conceal himself for that purpose in the garden, and be  provided with false keys, by which to deliver her from her prison. These  circumstances were by no means adapted to calm her perturbed  imagination. To throw herself into the arms of the man whose intercourse  she was employing every method to avoid, and whom, under the idea of a  partner for life, she could least of all men endure, was, no doubt, an  extraordinary proceeding. The attendant circumstances of darkness and  solitude aggravated the picture. The situation of Tyrrel Place was  uncommonly lonely; it was three miles from the nearest village, and not  less than seven from that in which Mrs. Jakeman's sister resided, under  whose protection Miss Melville was desirous of placing herself. The  ingenuous character of Emily did not allow her once to suspect Grimes of  intending to make an ungenerous and brutal advantage of these  circumstances; but her mind involuntarily revolted against the idea of  committing herself, alone, to the disposal of a man, whom she had lately  been accustomed to consider as the instrument of her treacherous  relation.    After having for some time revolved these considerations, she thought of  the expedient of desiring Grimes to engage Mrs. Jakeman's sister to wait  for her at the outside of the garden. But this Grimes peremptorily  refused. He even flew into a passion at the proposal. It showed very  little gratitude, to desire him to disclose to other people his concern  in this dangerous affair. For his part, he was determined, in  consideration of his own safety, never to appear in it to any living  soul. If Miss did not believe him, when he made this proposal out of  pure good-nature, and would not trust him a single inch, she might even  see to the consequences herself. He was resolved to condescend no  further to the whims of a person who, in her treatment of him, had  shown herself as proud as Lucifer himself.    Emily exerted herself to appease his resentment; but all the eloquence  of her new confederate could not prevail upon her instantly to give up  her objection. She desired till the next day to consider of it. The day  after was fixed by Mr. Tyrrel for the marriage ceremony. In the mean  time she was pestered with intimations, in a thousand forms, of the fate  that so nearly awaited her. The preparations were so continued,  methodical, and regular, as to produce in her the most painful and  aching anxiety. If her heart attained a moment's intermission upon the  subject, her female attendant was sure, by some sly hint or sarcastical  remark, to put a speedy termination to her tranquillity. She felt  herself, as she afterwards remarked, alone, uninstructed, just broken  loose, as it were, from the trammels of infancy, without one single  creature to concern himself in her fate. She, who till then never knew  an enemy, had now, for three weeks, not seen the glimpse of a human  countenance, that she had not good reason to consider as wholly  estranged to her at least, if not unrelentingly bent on her destruction.  She now, for the first time, experienced the anguish of never having  known her parents, and being cast upon the charity of"]]]
