Methinks, instead of in the forests lording,  The noble Sir should find it good,  The love of this young silly blood  At once to set about rewarding.  Her time is miserably long;  She haunts her window, watching clouds that stray  O'er the old city-wall, and far away.  \"Were I a little bird!\" so runs her song,  Day long, and half night long.  Now she is lively, mostly sad,  Now, wept beyond her tears;  Then again quiet she appears,--Always  love-mad.    FAUST    Serpent! Serpent!    MEPHISTOPHELES _(aside)_    Ha! do I trap thee!    FAUST    Get thee away with thine offences,  Reprobate! Name not that fairest thing,  Nor the desire for her sweet body bring  Again before my half-distracted senses!    MEPHISTOPHELES    What wouldst thou, then? She thinks that thou art flown;  And half and half thou art, I own.    FAUST    Yet am I near, and love keeps watch and ward;  Though I were ne'er so far, it cannot falter:  I envy even the Body of the Lord  The touching of her lips, before the altar.    MEPHISTOPHELES    'Tis very well! _My_ envy oft reposes  On your twin-pair, that feed among the roses.    FAUST    Away, thou pimp!    MEPHISTOPHELES    You rail, and it is fun to me.  The God, who fashioned youth and maid,  Perceived the noblest purpose of His trade,  And also made their opportunity.  Go on! It is a woe profound!  'Tis for your sweetheart's room you're bound,  And not for death, indeed.    FAUST    What are, within her arms, the heavenly blisses?  Though I be glowing with her kisses,  Do I not always share her need?  I am the fugitive, all houseless roaming,  The monster without air or rest,  That like a cataract, down rocks and gorges foaming,  Leaps, maddened, into the abyss's breast!  And side-wards she, with young unwakened senses,  Within her cabin on the Alpine field  Her simple, homely life commences,  Her little world therein concealed.  And I, God's hate flung o'er me,  Had not enough, to thrust  The stubborn rocks before me  And strike them into dust!  She and her peace I yet must undermine:  Thou, Hell, hast claimed this sacrifice as thine!  Help, Devil! through the coming pangs to push me;  What must be, let it quickly be!  Let fall on me her fate, and also crush me,--  One ruin whelm both her and me!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Again it seethes, again it glows!  Thou fool, go in and comfort her!  When such a head as thine no outlet knows,  It thinks the end must soon occur.  Hail him, who keeps a steadfast mind!  Thou, else, dost well the devil-nature wear:  Naught so insipid in the world I find  As is a devil in despair.

Save I have him near.          The grave is here;          The world is gall          And bitterness all.            My poor weak head          Is racked and crazed;          My thought is lost,          My senses mazed.            My peace is gone,          My heart is sore:          I never shall find it,          Ah, nevermore!            To see him, him only,          At the pane I sit;          To meet him, him only,          The house I quit.            His lofty gait,          His noble size,          The smile of his mouth,          The power of his eyes,            And the magic flow          Of his talk, the bliss          In the clasp of his hand,          And, ah! his kiss!            My peace is gone,          My heart is sore:          I never shall find it,          Ah, nevermore!            My bosom yearns          For him alone;          Ah, dared I clasp him,          And hold, and own!            And kiss his mouth,          To heart's desire,          And on his kisses          At last expire!    [Illustration]          XVI      MARTHA'S GARDEN    MARGARET FAUST    MARGARET    Promise me, Henry!--    FAUST    What I can!    MARGARET    How is't with thy religion, pray?  Thou art a dear, good-hearted man,  And yet, I think, dost not incline that way.    FAUST    Leave that, my child! Thou know'st my love is tender;  For love, my blood and life would I surrender,  And as for Faith and Church, I grant to each his own.    MARGARET    That's not enough: we must believe thereon.    FAUST    Must we?    MARGARET    Would that I had some influence!  Then, too, thou honorest not the Holy Sacraments.    FAUST    I honor them.    MARGARET    Desiring no possession  'Tis long since thou hast been to mass or to confession.  Believest thou in God?    FAUST    My darling, who shall dare  \"I believe in God!\" to say?  Ask priest or sage the answer to declare,  And it will seem a mocking play,  A sarcasm on the asker.    MARGARET    Then thou believest not!    FAUST    Hear me not falsely, sweetest countenance!  Who dare express Him?  And who profess Him,  Saying: I believe in Him!  Who, feeling, seeing,  Deny His being,  Saying: I believe Him not!  The All-enfolding,  The All-upholding,  Folds and upholds he not  Thee, me, Himself?  Arches not there the sky above us?  Lies not beneath us, firm, the earth?  And rise not, on us shining,  Friendly, the everlasting stars?  Look I not, eye to eye, on thee,  And feel'st not, thronging  To head and heart, the force,  Still weaving its eternal secret,  Invisible, visible, round thy life?  Vast as it is, fill with that force thy heart,  And when thou in the feeling wholly blessed art,  Call it, then, what thou wilt,--  Call it Bliss! Heart! Love! God!  I have no name to give it!  Feeling is all in all:  The Name is sound and smoke,  Obscuring Heaven's clear glow.    MARGARET    All that is fine and good, to hear it so:  Much the same way the preacher spoke,  Only with slightly different phrases.    FAUST    The same thing, in all places,  All hearts that beat beneath the heavenly day--  Each in its language--say;  Then why not I, in mine, as well?    MARGARET    To hear it thus, it may seem passable;  And yet, some hitch in't there must be  For thou hast no Christianity.    FAUST    Dear love!    MARGARET                      I've long been grieved to see  That thou art in such company.    FAUST    How so?    MARGARET            The man who with thee goes, thy mate,  Within my deepest, inmost soul I hate.  In all my life there's nothing  Has given my heart so keen a pang of loathing,  As his repulsive face has done.    FAUST    Nay, fear him not, my sweetest one!    MARGARET    I feel his presence like something ill.  I've else, for all, a kindly will,  But, much as my heart to see thee yearneth,  The secret horror of him returneth;  And I think the man a knave, as I live!  If I do him wrong, may God forgive!    FAUST    There must be such queer birds, however.    MARGARET    Live with the like of him, may I never!  When once inside the door comes he,  He looks around so sneeringly,  And half in wrath:  One sees that in nothing no interest he hath:  'Tis written on his very forehead  That love, to him, is a thing abhorred.  I am so happy on thine arm,  So free, so yielding, and so warm,  And in his presence stifled seems my heart.    FAUST    Foreboding angel that thou art!    MARGARET    It overcomes me in such degree,  That wheresoe'er he meets us, even,  I feel as though I'd lost my love for thee.  When he is by, I could not pray to Heaven.  That burns within me like a flame,  And surely, Henry, 'tis with thee the same.    FAUST    There, now, is thine antipathy!    MARGARET    But I must go.    FAUST                    Ah, shall there never be  A quiet hour, to see us fondly plighted,  With breast to breast, and soul to soul united?    MARGARET    Ah, if I only slept alone!  I'd draw the bolts to-night, for thy desire;  But mother's sleep so light has grown,  And if we were discovered by her,  'Twould be my death upon the spot!    FAUST    Thou angel, fear it not!  Here is a phial: in her drink  But three drops of it measure,  And deepest sleep will on her senses sink.    MARGARET    What would I not, to give thee pleasure?  It will not harm her, when one tries it?    FAUST    If 'twould, my love, would I advise it?    MARGARET    Ah, dearest man, if but thy face I see,  I know not what compels me to thy will:  So much have I already done for thee,  That scarcely more is left me to fulfil.    (_Enter_ MEPHISTOPHELES.) [_Exit_.    MEPHISTOPHELES    The monkey! Is she gone?    FAUST                              Hast played the spy again?    MEPHISTOPHELES    I've heard, most fully, how she drew thee.  The Doctor has been catechised, 'tis plain;  Great good, I hope, the thing will do thee.  The girls have much desire to ascertain  If one is prim and good, as ancient rules compel:  If there he's led, they think, he'll follow them as well.    FAUST    Thou, monster, wilt nor see nor own  How this pure soul, of faith so lowly,  So loving and ineffable,--  The faith alone  That her salvation is,--with scruples holy  Pines, lest she hold as lost the man she loves so well!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Thou, full of sensual, super-sensual desire,  A girl by the nose is leading thee.    FAUST    Abortion, thou, of filth and fire!    MEPHISTOPHELES    And then, how masterly she reads physiognomy!  When I am present she's impressed, she knows not how;  She in my mask a hidden sense would read:  She feels that surely I'm a genius now,--  Perhaps the very Devil, indeed!  Well, well,--to-night--?    FAUST                              What's that to thee?    MEPHISTOPHELES    Yet my delight 'twill also be!

I go so little out.    LISBETH    It's true, Sibylla said, to-day.  She's played the fool at last, there's not a doubt.  Such taking-on of airs!    MARGARET           "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/146"],[0,"A Little Princess (#18)"],[1,"he  took and carried in the most businesslike manner back to his home.    \"You see,\" said Sara, \"that is for his wife and children. He is very  nice.  He only eats the little bits.  After he goes back I can always  hear his family squeaking for joy. There are three kinds of squeaks.  One kind is the children's, and one is Mrs. Melchisedec's, and one is  Melchisedec's own.\"    Ermengarde began to laugh.    \"Oh, Sara!\" she said.  \"You ARE queer--but you are nice.\"    \"I know I am queer,\" admitted Sara, cheerfully; \"and I TRY to be nice.\"  She rubbed her forehead with her little brown paw, and a puzzled,  tender look came into her face.  \"Papa always laughed at me,\" she said;  \"but I liked it.  He thought I was queer, but he liked me to make up  things.  I--I can't help making up things.  If I didn't, I don't  believe I could live.\"  She paused and glanced around the attic. \"I'm  sure I couldn't live here,\" she added in a low voice.    Ermengarde was interested, as she always was.  \"When you talk about  things,\" she said, \"they seem as if they grew real. You talk about  Melchisedec as if he was a person.\"    \"He IS a person,\" said Sara.  \"He gets hungry and frightened, just as  we do; and he is married and has children.  How do we know he doesn't  think things, just as we do?  His eyes look as if he was a person.  That was why I gave him a name.\"    She sat down on the floor in her favorite attitude, holding her knees.    \"Besides,\" she said, \"he is a Bastille rat sent to be my friend.  I can  always get a bit of bread the cook has thrown away, and it is quite  enough to support him.\"    \"Is it the Bastille yet?\" asked Ermengarde, eagerly.  \"Do you always  pretend it is the Bastille?\"    \"Nearly always,\" answered Sara.  \"Sometimes I try to pretend it is  another kind of place; but the Bastille is generally  easiest--particularly when it is cold.\"    Just at that moment Ermengarde almost jumped off the bed, she was so  startled by a sound she heard.  It was like two distinct knocks on the  wall.    \"What is that?\" she exclaimed.    Sara got up from the floor and answered quite dramatically:    \"It is the prisoner in the next cell.\"    \"Becky!\" cried Ermengarde, enraptured.    \"Yes,\" said Sara.  \"Listen; the two knocks meant, 'Prisoner, are you  there?'\"    She knocked three times on the wall herself, as if in answer.    \"That means, 'Yes, I am here, and all is well.'\"    Four knocks came from Becky's side of the wall.    \"That means,\" explained Sara, \"'Then, fellow-sufferer, we will sleep in  peace.  Good night.'\"    Ermengarde quite beamed with delight.    \"Oh, Sara!\" she whispered joyfully.  \"It is like a story!\"    \"It IS a story,\" said Sara.  \"EVERYTHING'S a story.  You are a story--I  am a story.  Miss Minchin is a story.\"    And she sat down again and talked until Ermengarde forgot that she was  a sort of escaped prisoner herself, and had to be reminded by Sara that  she could not remain in the Bastille all night, but must steal  noiselessly downstairs again and creep back into her deserted bed.        10    The Indian Gentleman      But it was a perilous thing for Ermengarde and Lottie to make  pilgrimages to the attic.  They could never be quite sure when Sara  would be there, and they could scarcely ever be certain that Miss  Amelia would not make a tour of inspection through the bedrooms after  the pupils were supposed to be asleep.  So their visits were rare ones,  and Sara lived a strange and lonely life.  It was a lonelier life when  she was downstairs than when she was in her attic.  She had no one to  talk to; and when she was sent out on errands and walked through the  streets, a forlorn little figure carrying a basket or a parcel, trying  to hold her hat on when the wind was blowing, and feeling the water  soak through her shoes when it was raining, she felt as if the crowds  hurrying past her made her loneliness greater. When she had been the  Princess Sara, driving through the streets in her brougham, or walking,  attended by Mariette, the sight of her bright, eager little face and  picturesque coats and hats had often caused people to look after her.  A happy, beautifully cared for little girl naturally attracts  attention.  Shabby, poorly dressed children are not rare enough and  pretty enough to make people turn around to look at them and smile.  No  one looked at Sara in these days, and no one seemed to see her as she  hurried along the crowded pavements. She had begun to grow very fast,  and, as she was dressed only in such clothes as the plainer remnants of  her wardrobe would supply, she knew she looked very queer, indeed.  All  her valuable garments had been disposed of, and such as had been left  for her use she was expected to wear so long as she could put them on  at all. Sometimes, when she passed a shop window with a mirror in it,  she almost laughed outright on catching a glimpse of herself, and  sometimes her face went red and she bit her lip and turned away.    In the evening, when she passed houses whose windows were lighted up,  she used to look into the warm rooms and amuse herself by imagining  things about the people she saw sitting before the fires or about the  tables.  It always interested her to catch glimpses of rooms before the  shutters were closed.  There were several families in the square in  which Miss Minchin lived, with which she had become quite familiar in a  way of her own.  The one she liked best she called the Large Family.  She called it the Large Family not because the members of it were  big--for, indeed, most of them were little--but because there were so  many of them.  There were eight children in the Large Family, and a  stout, rosy mother, and a stout, rosy father, and a stout, rosy  grandmother, and any number of servants. The eight children were always  either being taken out to walk or to ride in perambulators by  comfortable nurses, or they were going to drive with their mamma, or  they were flying to the door in the evening to meet their papa and kiss  him and dance around him and drag off his overcoat and look in the  pockets for packages, or they were crowding about the nursery windows  and looking out and pushing each other and laughing--in fact, they were  always doing something enjoyable and suited to the tastes of a large  family.  Sara was quite fond of them, and had given them names out of  books--quite romantic names.  She called them the Montmorencys when she  did not call them the Large Family.  The fat, fair baby with the lace  cap was Ethelberta Beauchamp Montmorency; the next baby was Violet  Cholmondeley Montmorency; the little boy who could just stagger and who  had such round legs was Sydney Cecil Vivian Montmorency; and then came  Lilian Evangeline Maud Marion, Rosalind Gladys, Guy Clarence, Veronica  Eustacia, and Claude Harold Hector.    One evening a very funny thing happened--though, perhaps, in one sense  it was not a funny thing at all.    Several of the Montmorencys were evidently going to a children's party,  and just as Sara was about to pass the door they were crossing the  pavement to get into the carriage which was waiting for them. Veronica  Eustacia and Rosalind Gladys, in white-lace frocks and lovely sashes,  had just got in, and Guy Clarence, aged five, was following them.  He  was such a pretty fellow and had such rosy cheeks and blue eyes, and  such a darling little round head covered with curls, that Sara forgot  her basket and shabby cloak altogether--in fact, forgot everything but  that she wanted to look at him for a moment. So she paused and looked.    It was Christmas time, and the Large Family had been hearing many  stories about children who were poor and had no mammas and papas to  fill their stockings and take them to the pantomime--children who were,  in fact, cold and thinly clad and hungry.  In the stories, kind  people--sometimes little boys and girls with tender hearts--invariably  saw the poor children and gave them money or rich gifts, or took them  home to beautiful dinners.  Guy Clarence had been affected to tears  that very afternoon by the reading of such a story, and he had burned  with a desire to find such a poor child and give her a certain sixpence  he possessed, and thus provide for her for life. An entire sixpence, he  was sure, would mean affluence for evermore. As he crossed the strip of  red carpet laid across the pavement from the door to the carriage, he  had this very sixpence in the pocket of his very short man-o-war  trousers; And just as Rosalind Gladys got into the vehicle and jumped  on the seat in order to feel the cushions spring under her, he saw Sara  standing on the wet pavement in her shabby frock and hat, with her old  basket on her arm, looking at him hungrily.    He thought that her eyes looked hungry because she had perhaps had  nothing to eat for a long time.  He did not know that they looked so  because she was hungry for the warm, merry life his home held and his  rosy face spoke of, and that she had a hungry wish to snatch him in her  arms and kiss him.  He only knew that she had big eyes and a thin face  and thin legs and a common basket and poor clothes. So he put his hand  in his pocket and found his sixpence and walked up to her benignly.    \"Here, poor little girl,\" he said.  \"Here is a sixpence. I will give it  to you.\"    Sara started, and all at once realized that she looked exactly like  poor children she had seen, in her better days, waiting on the pavement  to watch her as she got out of her brougham. And she had given them  pennies many a time.  Her face went red and then it went pale, and for  a second she felt as if she could not take the dear little sixpence.    \"Oh, no!\" she said.  \"Oh, no, thank you; I mustn't take it, indeed!\"    Her voice was so unlike an ordinary street child's voice and her manner  was so like the manner of a well-bred little person that Veronica  Eustacia (whose real name was Janet) and Rosalind Gladys (who was"]]]
