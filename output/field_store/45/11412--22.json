His daughter Creidylad is to be wedded to  Gwythur, but is kidnapped by Gwyn. Arthur decides that they must fight  for her yearly on 1st May until the day of judgment, when the victor  would gain her hand.[297] Professor Rh[^y]s regards Creidylad as a  Persephone, wedded alternately to light and dark divinities.[298] But  the story may rather be explanatory of such ritual acts as are found in  folk-survivals in the form of fights between summer and winter, in which  a Queen of May figures, and intended to assist the conflict of the gods  of growth with those of blight.[299] Creidylad is daughter of a probable  god of growth, nor is it impossible that the story of the battle of  Mag-tured is based on mythic explanations of such ritual combats.    The Brythons worshipped Nuada as Nodons in Romano-British times. The  remains of his temple exist near the mouth of the Severn, and the god  may have been equated with Mars, though certain symbols seem to connect  him with the waters as a kind of Neptune.[300] An Irish mythic poet  Nuada Necht may be the Nechtan who owned a magic well whence issued the  Boyne, and was perhaps a water-god. If such a water-god was associated  with Nuada, he and Nodons might be a Celtic Neptune.[301] But the  relationship and functions of these various personages are obscure, nor  is it certain that Nodons was equated with Neptune or that Nuada was a  water-god. His name may be cognate with words meaning \"growth,\"  \"possession,\" \"harvest,\" and this supports the view taken here of his  functions.[302] The Welsh Nudd Hael, or \"the Generous,\" who possessed a  herd of 21,000 milch kine, may be a memory of this god, and it is  possible that, as a god of growth, Nuada had human incarnations called  by his name.[303]    Ler, whose name means \"sea,\" and who was a god of the sea, is father of  Manannan as well as of the personages of the beautiful story called _The  Children of Lir_, from which we learn practically all that is known of  him. He resented not being made ruler of the Tuatha Dea, but was later  reconciled when the daughter of Bodb Dearg was given to him as his wife.  On her death, he married her sister, who transformed her step-children  into swans.[304] Ler is the equivalent of the Brythonic Llyr, later  immortalised by Shakespeare as King Lear.    The greatness of Manannan mac Lir, \"son of the sea,\" is proved by the  fact that he appears in many of the heroic tales, and is still  remembered in tradition and folk-tale. He is a sea-god who has become  more prominent than the older god of the sea, and though not a supreme  god, he must have had a far-spreading cult. With Bodb Dearg he was  elected king of the Tuatha De Danann. He made the gods invisible and  immortal, gave them magical food, and assisted Oengus in driving out  Elemar from his _sid_. Later tradition spoke of four Manannans, probably  local forms of the god, as is suggested by the fact that the true name  of one of them is said to be Orbsen, son of Allot. Another, the son of  Ler, is described as a renowned trader who dwelt in the Isle of Man, the  best of pilots, weather-wise, and able to transform himself as he  pleased. The _Coir Anmann_ adds that the Britons and the men of Erin  deemed him god of the sea.[305] That position is plainly seen in many  tales, e.g. in the magnificent passage of _The Voyage of Bran_, where he  suddenly sweeps into sight, riding in a chariot across the waves from  the Land of Promise; or in the tale of _Cuchulainn's Sickness_, where  his wife Fand sees him, \"the horseman of the crested sea,\" coming across  the waves. In the _Agallamh na Senorach_ he appears as a cavalier  breasting the waves. \"For the space of nine waves he would be submerged  in the sea, but would rise on the crest of the tenth without wetting  chest or breast.\"[306] In one archaic tale he is identified with a great  sea wave which swept away Tuag, while the waves are sometimes called  \"the son of Lir's horses\"--a name still current in Ireland, or, again,  \"the locks of Manannan's wife.\"[307] His position as god of the sea may  have given rise to the belief that he was ruler of the oversea Elysium,  and, later, of the other-world as a magical domain coterminous with this  earth. He is still remembered in the Isle of Man, which may owe its name  to him, and which, like many another island, was regarded by the Goidels  as the island Elysium under its name of Isle of Falga. He is also the  Manawyddan of Welsh story.    Manannan appears in the Cuchulainn and Fionn cycles, usually as a ruler  of the Other-world. His wife Fand was Cuchulainn's mistress, Diarmaid  was his pupil in fairyland, and Cormac was his guest there. Even in  Christian times surviving pagan beliefs caused legend to be busy with  his name. King Fiachna was fighting the Scots and in great danger, when  a stranger appeared to his wife and announced that he would save her  husband's life if she would consent to abandon herself to him. She  reluctantly agreed, and the child of the _amour_ was the seventh-century  King Mongan, of whom the annalist says, \"every one knows that his real  father was Manannan.\"[308] Mongan was also believed to be a rebirth of  Fionn. Manannan is still remembered in folk-tradition, and in the Isle  of Man, where his grave is to be seen, some of his ritual survived until  lately, bundles of rushes being placed for him on midsummer eve on two  hills.[309] Barintus, who steers Arthur to the fortunate isles, and S.  Barri, who crossed the sea on horseback, may have been legendary forms  of a local sea-god akin to Manannan, or of Manannan himself.[310] His  steed was Enbarr, \"water foam _or_ hair,\" and Manannan was \"the horseman  of the maned sea.\" \"Barintus,\" perhaps connected with _barr find_,  \"white-topped,\" would thus be a surname of the god who rode on Enbarr,  the foaming wave, or who was himself the wave, while his mythic  sea-riding was transferred to the legend of S. Barri, if such a person  ever existed.    Various magical possessions were ascribed to Manannan--his armour and  sword, the one making the wearer invulnerable, the other terrifying all  who beheld it; his horse and canoe; his swine, which came to life again  when killed; his magic cloak; his cup which broke when a lie was spoken;  his tablecloth, which, when waved, produced food. Many of these are  found everywhere in _Maerchen_, and there is nothing peculiarly Celtic in  them. We need not, therefore, with the mythologists, see in his armour  the vapoury clouds or in his sword lightning or the sun's rays. But  their magical nature as well as the fact that so much wizardry is  attributed to Manannan, points to a copious mythology clustering round  the god, now for ever lost.    The parentage of Lug is differently stated, but that account which makes  him son of Cian and of Ethne, daughter of Balor, is best attested.[311]  Folk-tradition still recalls the relation of Lug and Balor. Balor, a  robber living in Tory Island, had a daughter whose son was to kill her  father. He therefore shut her up in an inaccessible place, but in  revenge for Balor's stealing MacIneely's cow, the latter gained access  to her, with the result that Ethne bore three sons, whom Balor cast into  the sea. One of them, Lug, was recovered by MacIneely and fostered by  his brother Gavida. Balor now slew MacIneely, but was himself slain by  Lug, who pierced his single eye with a red-hot iron.[312] In another  version, Kian takes MacIneely's place and is aided by Manannan, in  accordance with older legends.[313] But Lug's birth-story has been  influenced in these tales by the _Maerchen_ formula of the girl hidden  away because it has been foretold that she will have a son who will slay  her father.    Lug is associated with Manannan, from whose land he comes to assist the  Tuatha Dea against the Fomorians. His appearance was that of the sun,  and by this brilliant warrior's prowess the hosts were utterly  defeated.[314] This version, found in _The Children of Tuirenn_, differs  from the account in the story of Mag-tured. Here Lug arrives at the  gates of Tara and offers his services as a craftsman. Each offer is  refused, until he proclaims himself \"the man of each and every art,\" or  _samildanach_, \"possessing many arts.\" Nuada resigns his throne to him  for thirteen days, and Lug passes in review the various craftsmen (i.e.  the gods), and though they try to prevent such a marvellous person  risking himself in fight, he escapes, heads the warriors, and sings his  war-song. Balor, the evil-eyed, he slays with a sling-stone, and his  death decided the day against the Fomorians. In this account Lug  _samildanach_ is a patron of the divine patrons of crafts; in other  words, he is superior to a whole group of gods. He was also inventor of  draughts, ball-play, and horsemanship. But, as M. D'Arbois shows,  _samildanach_ is the equivalent of \"inventor of all arts,\" applied by  Caesar to the Gallo-Roman Mercury, who is thus an equivalent of Lug.[315]  This is attested on other grounds. As Lug's name appears in Irish Louth  (_Lug-magh_) and in British Lugu-vallum, near Hadrian's Wall, so in Gaul  the names Lugudunum (Lyons), Lugudiacus, and Lugselva (\"devoted to  Lugus\") show that a god Lugus was worshipped there. A Gaulish feast of  Lugus in August--the month of Lug's festival in Ireland--was perhaps  superseded by one in honour of Augustus. No dedication to Lugus has yet  been found, but images of and inscriptions to Mercury abound at  Lugudunum Convenarum.[316] As there were three Brigits, so there may  have been several forms of Lugus, and two dedications to the _Lugoves_  have been found in Spain and Switzerland, one of them inscribed by the  shoemakers of Uxama.[317] Thus the Lugoves may have been multiplied  forms of Lugus or _Lugovos_, \"a hero,\" the meaning given to \"Lug\" by  O'Davoren.[318] Shoe-making was not one of the arts professed by Lug, "]]]
