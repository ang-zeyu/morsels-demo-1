As a port of shipment, I think it must yield to the new  port, Nipe Bay, on the north coast. It is merely a bit of commercial logic,  the question of a sixty-mile rail-haul as compared with a voyage around the  end of the island. Santiago will not be wiped from the map, but I doubt its  long continuance as the leading commercial centre of eastern Cuba. It is  also a fairly safe prediction that the same laws of commercial logic will  some day operate to drain northward the products of the fertile valley of  the Cauto, and the region behind old Manzanillo and around the still older  Bayamo.    [Illustration: COBRE _Oriente Province_]    Except the places earlier mentioned, Jucaro, Trinidad and Cienfuegos, there  are no southern ports to the west until Batabano is reached, immediately  south of, and only a few miles from, the city of Havana. It is a shallow  harbor, of no commercial importance. It serves mainly as the centre of a  sponge-fishing industry, and as a point of departure for the Isle of Pines,  and for ports on the south coast. The Isle of Pines is of interest for a  number of reasons, among which are its history, its mineral springs, its  delightful climate, and an American colony that has made much trouble  in Washington. Columbus landed there in 1494, and gave it the name _La  Evangelista_. It lies about sixty miles off the coast, almost due south  from Havana. Between the island and the mainland lies a labyrinth of islets  and keys, many of them verdure-clad. Its area is officially given as 1,180  square miles. There seems no doubt that, at some earlier time, it formed a  part of the main island, with which it compares in geologic structure and  configuration. It is now, in effect, two islands connected by a marsh; the  northern part being broken and hilly, and the southern part low, flat, and  sandy, probably a comparatively recently reclaimed coralline plain. The  island has been, at various times, the headquarters of bands of pirates, a  military hospital, a penal institution, and a source of political trouble.  It is now a Cuban island the larger part of which is owned by Americans. It  is a part of the province of Havana, and will probably so remain as long as  Cuba is Cuba. My personal investigations of the disputed question of the  political ownership of the island began early in 1899. I then reached a  conclusion from which I have not since seen any reason to depart. The  island was then, had always been, and is now, as much a part of Cuba as  Long Island and Key West have been and are parts of the United States.    Just who it was that first raised the question of ownership, none of us who  investigated the matter at the time of its particular acuteness, was  able to determine satisfactorily, although some of us had a well-defined  suspicion. The man is now dead, and I shall not give his name. Article I,  of the Treaty of Paris, of December 10, 1898, presumably disposes of the  Cuban area; Article II refers to Porto Rico; and Article III refers to the  Philippines. The issue regarding the Isle of Pines was raised under  Article II, presumably referring only to Porto Rico. A slight but possibly  important difference appears in the Spanish and the English versions. The  English text reads that \"Spain cedes ... the island of Porto Rico and other  islands now under Spanish sovereignty\" etc. The Spanish text, literally  translated runs: \"Spain cedes ... the island of Porto Rico and the others  that are now under its sovereignty.\" The obvious reference of the article  is to Mona, Viequez, and Culebra, all small islands in Porto Rican waters.  But the question was raised and was vigorously discussed. An official map  was issued showing the island as American territory. Americans jumped  in, bought up large tracts, and started a lively real estate boom. They  advertised it widely as American territory, and many put their little  collections of dollars into it. The claim of Spanish cession was afterward  denied in the very document that served to keep the issue alive for a  number of years. Article VI of the Platt Amendment, which the Cubans  accepted with marked reluctance, declared that the island was omitted from  the boundaries of Cuba, and that the title and ownership should be left to  future adjustment by treaty. But no alternative appears between cession and  no cession. Had the island become definitely American territory by cession,  its alienation, by such a step, would not have been possible. When we left  Cuba, in 1902, the official instructions from Washington were that the Isle  of Pines would remain under a _de facto_ American government. President  Palma, accepting the transfer, expressed his understanding that it would  \"continue _de facto_ under the jurisdiction of the Republic of Cuba.\" In  some way, the departing American authority failed to leave any agent or  representative of the _de facto_ government of the United States, and the  Cubans included the island in their new administration, very properly. When  the treaty proposed by the Platt Amendment came before the United States  Senate, it hung fire, and finally found lodgment in one of the many  pigeon-holes generously provided for the use of that august body. There it  may probably be found today, a record and nothing more. Why? For the very  simple reason that some of the resident claimants for American ownership  sent up a consignment of cigars made on the island from tobacco grown on  the island, and refused to pay duty on them. The ground of refusal was that  they were a domestic product, sent from one port in the United States to  another port in the same country, and therefore not dutiable. The case of  Pearcy _vs_ Stranahan, the former representing the shippers, and the latter  being the Collector of the Port of New York, came before the Supreme Court  of the United States, and that final authority decided and declared that  the Isle of Pines was Cuban territory and a part of Cuba. The question is  settled, and the Isle of Pines can become territory of the United States  only by purchase, conquest, or some other form of territorial transfer.    While the American settlers in the Isle of Pines, and the several  real-estate companies who seek purchasers for their holdings, own a large  part of the territory, they still constitute a minority of the population.  Many of the settlers, probably most of them, are industrious and persistent  in their various productive activities. Their specialty is citrus fruits,  but their products are not limited to that line. More than a few have tried  their little experiment in pioneering, and have returned to their home land  more or less disgusted with their experience. Those who have remained,  and have worked faithfully and intelligently, have probably done a little  better than they would have done at home. The great wealth for which all,  doubtless, earnestly hoped, and in which many, doubtless, really believed,  has not come. This settlement is only one of many speculative exploitations  in Cuba. Some of these have been fairly honest, but many of them have been  little better than rank swindles. Many have been entirely abandoned, the  buyers losing the hard-earned dollars they had invested. Others, better  located, have been developed, by patience, persistence, and thrift, into  fairly prosperous colonies. I do not know how many victims have been  caught by unscrupulous and ignorant promoters in the last fifteen years,  principally in the United States and in Canada, but they are certainly  many, so many that the speculative industry has declined in recent years.  Many of the settlers who have remained have learned the game, have  discovered that prosperity in Cuba is purchased by hard work just as it is  elsewhere. In different parts of the island, east, west, and centre, there  are now thrifty and contented colonists who have fought their battle, and  have learned the rules that nature has formulated as the condition of  success in such countries. Whether these people have really done any better  than they would have done had they stayed at home and followed the rules  there laid down, is perhaps another question. At all events, there are  hundreds of very comfortable and happy American homes in Cuba, even in the  Isle of Pines, where they persist in growling because it is Cuba and not  the United States.    In a review of a country including forty-four thousand square miles of  territory, condensed into two chapters, it is quite impossible to include  all that is worth telling. Moreover, there is much in the island of which  no adequate description can be given. There is much that must be seen if it  if to be fairly understood and appreciated.          VIII    _THE UNITED STATES AND CUBA_      IN his message to Congress, on December 5, 1898, President McKinley  declared that \"the new Cuba yet to arise from the ashes of the past must  needs be bound to us by ties of singular intimacy and strength if its  enduring welfare is to be assured.\"    Probably to many of the people of the United States, the story of our  relations with Cuba had its beginning with the Spanish-American war.  That is quite like a notion that the history of an apple begins with its  separation from the tree on which it grew. The general history of the  island is reviewed in other chapters in this volume. The story of our  active relations with Cuba and its affairs runs back for more than a  hundred years, at least to the days of President Thomas Jefferson who,  in 1808, wrote thus to Albert Gallatin: \"I shall sincerely lament Cuba's  falling into any other hands but those of its present owners.\" Several  other references to the island appear at about that time. Two great  movements were then going on. Europe was in the throes of the Napoleonic  disturbance, and for more than twenty-five years both France and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1149"],[0,"From London to Land's End (#18)"],[1,"townspeople from falling into the river.  But that  the sea has choked up the river with sand is not only probable, but true;  and there are other rivers which suffer in the like manner in this same  country.    This town of Lostwithiel retains, however, several advantages which  support its figure--as, first, that it is one of the Coinage Towns, as I  call them; or Stannary Towns, as others call them; (2) the common gaol  for the whole Stannary is here, as are also the County Courts for the  whole county of Cornwall.    There is a mock cavalcade kept up at this town, which is very remarkable.  The particulars, as they are related by Mr. Carew in his \"Survey of  Cornwall,\" take as follows:--    \"Upon Little Easter Sunday the freeholders of this town and manor, by  themselves or their deputies, did there assemble; amongst whom one (as it  fell to his lot by turn), bravely apparelled, gallantly mounted, with a  crown on his head, a sceptre in his hand, and a sword borne before him,  and dutifully attended by all the rest (also on horseback), rode through  the principal street to the church.  The curate in his best beseen  solemnly received him at the churchyard stile, and conducted him to hear  divine service.  After which he repaired, with the same pomp, to a house  provided for that purpose, made a feast to his attendants, kept the  table's-end himself, and was served with kneeling assay and all other  rights due to the estate of a prince; with which dinner the ceremony  ended, and every man returned home again.  The pedigree of this usage is  derived from so many descents of ages that the cause and author outreach  the remembrance.  Howbeit, these circumstances afford a conjecture that  it should betoken royalties appertaining to the honour of Cornwall.\"    Behind Foy and nearer to the coast, at the mouth of a small river which  some call Lowe, though without any authority, there stand two towns  opposite to one another bearing the name of the River Looe--that is to  say, distinguished by the addition of East Looe and West Looe.  These are  both good trading towns, and especially fishing towns; and, which is very  particular, are (like Weymouth and Melcombe, in Dorsetshire) separated  only by the creek or river, and yet each of them sends members to  Parliament.  These towns are joined together by a very beautiful and  stately stone bridge having fifteen arches.    East Looe was the ancienter corporation of the two, and for some ages ago  the greater and more considerable town; but now they tell us West Looe is  the richest, and has the most ships belonging to it.  Were they put  together, they would make a very handsome seaport town.  They have a  great fishing trade here, as well for supply of the country as for  merchandise, and the towns are not despisable.  But as to sending four  members to the British Parliament (which is as many as the City of London  chooses), that, I confess, seems a little scandalous; but to whom, is  none of my business to inquire.    Passing from hence, and ferrying over Foy River or the River Foweth (call  it as you please), we come into a large country without many towns in it  of note, but very well furnished with gentlemen's seats, and a little  higher up with tin-works.    The sea making several deep bays here, they who travel by land are  obliged to go higher into the country to pass above the water, especially  at Trewardreth Bay, which lies very broad, above ten miles within the  country, which passing at Trewardreth (a town of no great note, though  the bay takes its name from it), the next inlet of the sea is the famous  firth or inlet called Falmouth Haven.  It is certainly, next to Milford  Haven in South Wales, the fairest and best road for shipping that is in  the whole isle of Britain, whether be considered the depth of water for  above twenty miles within land; the safety of riding, sheltered from all  kind of winds or storms; the good anchorage; and the many creeks, all  navigable, where ships may run in and be safe; so that the like is  nowhere to be found.    There are six or seven very considerable places upon this haven and the  rivers from it--viz., Grampound, Tregony, Truro, Penryn, Falmouth, St.  Maws, and Pendennis.  The three first of these send members to  Parliament.  The town of Falmouth, as big as all the three, and richer  than ten of them, sends none; which imports no more than this--that  Falmouth itself is not of so great antiquity as to its rising as those  other towns are; and yet the whole haven takes its name from Falmouth,  too, unless, as some think, the town took its name from the haven, which,  however, they give no authority to suggest.    St. Maws and Pendennis are two fortifications placed at the points or  entrance of this haven, opposite to one another, though not with a  communication or view; they are very strong--the first principally by  sea, having a good platform of guns pointing athwart the Channel, and  planted on a level with the water.  But Pendennis Castle is strong by  land as well as by water, is regularly fortified, has good out-works, and  generally a strong garrison.  St. Maws, otherwise called St. Mary's, has  a town annexed to the castle, and is a borough sending members to the  Parliament.  Pendennis is a mere fortress, though there are some  habitations in it, too, and some at a small distance near the seaside,  but not of any great consideration.    The town of Falmouth is by much the richest and best trading town in this  county, though not so ancient as its neighbour town of Truro; and indeed  is in some things obliged to acknowledge the seigniority--namely, that in  the corporation of Truro the person whom they choose to be their Mayor of  Truro is also Mayor of Falmouth of course.  How the jurisdiction is  managed is an account too long for this place.  The Truro-men also  receive several duties collected in Falmouth, particularly wharfage for  the merchandises landed or shipped off; but let these advantages be what  they will, the town of Falmouth has gotten the trade--at least, the best  part of it--from the other, which is chiefly owing to the situation.  For  that Falmouth lying upon the sea, but within the entrance, ships of the  greatest burthen come up to the very quays, and the whole Royal Navy  might ride safely in the road; whereas the town of Truro lying far  within, and at the mouth of two fresh rivers, is not navigable for  vessels of above 150 tons or thereabouts.    Some have suggested that the original of Falmouth was the having so large  a quay, and so good a depth of water at it.  The merchants of Truro  formerly used it for the place of lading and unlading their ships, as the  merchants of Exeter did at Topsham; and this is the more probable in  that, as above, the wharfage of those landing-places is still the  property of the corporation of Truro.    But let this be as it will, the trade is now in a manner wholly gone to  Falmouth, the trade at Truro being now chiefly (if not only) for the  shipping off of block tin and copper ore, the latter being lately found  in large quantities in some of the mountains between Truro and St.  Michael's, and which is much improved since the several mills are erected  at Bristol and other parts for the manufactures of battery ware, as it is  called (brass), or which is made out of English copper, most of it dug  in these parts--the ore itself ago being found very rich and good.    Falmouth is well built, has abundance of shipping belonging to it, is  full of rich merchants, and has a flourishing and increasing trade.  I  say \"increasing,\" because by the late setting up the English packets  between this port and Lisbon, there is a new commerce between Portugal  and this town carried on to a very great value.    It is true, part of this trade was founded in a clandestine commerce  carried on by the said packets at Lisbon, where, being the king's ships,  and claiming the privilege of not being searched or visited by the Custom  House officers, they found means to carry off great quantities of British  manufactures, which they sold on board to the Portuguese merchants, and  they conveyed them on shore, as it is supposed, without paying custom.    But the Government there getting intelligence of it, and complaint being  made in England also, where it was found to be very prejudicial to the  fair merchant, that trade has been effectually stopped.  But the Falmouth  merchants, having by this means gotten a taste of the Portuguese trade,  have maintained it ever since in ships of their own.  These packets bring  over such vast quantities of gold in specie, either in _moidores_ (which  is the Portugal coin) or in bars of gold, that I am very credibly  informed the carrier from Falmouth brought by land from thence to London  at one time, in the month of January, 1722, or near it, eighty thousand  _moidores_ in gold, which came from Lisbon in the packet-boats for  account of the merchants at London, and that it was attended with a guard  of twelve horsemen well armed, for which the said carrier had half per  cent. for his hazard.    This is a specimen of the Portugal trade, and how considerable it is in  itself, as well as how advantageous to England; but as that is not to the  present case, I proceed.  The Custom House for all the towns in this  port, and the head collector, is established at this town, where the  duties (including the other ports) is very considerable.  Here is also a  very great fishing for pilchards; and the merchants for Falmouth have the  chief stroke in that gainful trade.    Truro is, however, a very considerable town, too.  It stands up the water  north and by east from Falmouth, in the utmost extended branch of the  Avon, in the middle between the conflux of two rivers, which, though not  of any long course, have a very good appearance for a port, and make it  large wharf between them in the front of the town.
