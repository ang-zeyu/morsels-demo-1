F. Well, now examine the leaves.    19. A. Oh, I see they are all covered over with little bristles; and when  I examine them with the glass, I see a little bag, filled with a juice  like water, at the bottom of each. Ha! these are the things which stung  me.    20. F. Now touch the little bag with the point of the pin.    21. A. When I press the bag, the juice runs up and comes out at the small  point at the top; so I suppose the little thorn must be hollow inside,  though it is finer than the point of my cambric needle.    22.  F. Have all the leaves those stings?    23. A. No, papa; some of the young ones are quite green and soft, like  velvet, and I may handle them without any danger.    24.  F. Now look at the stem, and break it.    25. A. I can easily crack it, but I can not break it asunder, for the bark  is so strong that it holds it together.    26. F. Well, now you see there are more curious things in  the nettle than you expected.    27. A. Yes, indeed, I see that. But you have often told me that God makes  nothing without its use; and I am sure I can not see any use in all these  things.    28. F. That we will now consider. You saw the little flower burst open,  and a cloud rose, you say, like enchantment. Now all this is necessary for  the nature of the plant. There are many thousand plants in the world, and  it has pleased God, in his wisdom, to make them all different. Now look at  this other nettle, which grew on the opposite side of the road; you see  that it is not exactly like the one you have just examined.    29. A. No, papa; this has little flat seeds instead of flowers.    30. F. Very right, my dear. Now, in order to make those seeds grow, it is  necessary that the little flower of this plant and the seed of that should  be together, as they are in most others. But plants can not walk, like  animals. The wisdom of God, therefore, has provided a remedy for this.  When the little flower bursts open it throws out a fine powder, which you  saw rise like a cloud; this is conveyed by the air to the other plant, and  when it falls upon the seed of that plant it gives it power to grow, and  makes it a perfect seed, which, in its turn, when it falls to the ground,  will produce a new plant. Were it not for this fine powder, that seed  would never be perfect or complete.    31. A. That is very curious, indeed; and I see the use of the little cloud  and the flower; but the leaf that stung me, of what use can that be?  There, dear papa, I am afraid I puzzle you to tell me that.    32. P. Even these stings are made useful to man. The poor people in some  countries use them instead of blisters, when they are sick. Those leaves  which do not sting are used by some for food, and from the stalk others  get a stringy bark, which answers the purpose of flax. Thus you see that  even the despised nettle is not made in vain; and this lesson may serve to  teach you that we only need to understand the works of God to see that \"in  goodness and wisdom he has made them all.\"      DEFINITIONS.--12.

He was a poet, and the author, also, of some well known prose works. Of  these, his \"Yesterdays with Authors\" is the most noted.    1. We were crowded in the cabin;       Not a soul would dare to sleep:     It was midnight on the waters,       And a storm was on the deep.    2. 'T is a fearful thing in winter       To be shattered by the blast,     And to hear the rattling trumpet       Thunder, \"Cut away the mast!\"    3. So we shuddered there in silence,       For the stoutest held his breath,     While the hungry sea was roaring,       And the breakers threatened death.    4. And as thus we sat in darkness,       Each one busy in his prayers,     \"We are lost!\" the captain shouted,       As he staggered down the stairs.    5. But his little daughter whispered,       As she took his icy hand,     \"Is n't God upon the ocean,       Just the same as on the land?\"    6. Then we kissed the little maiden,       And we spoke in better cheer;     And we anchored safe in harbor       When the morn was shining clear.      DEFINITIONS.--l. Deep, the ocean. 2. Blast, tempest. 3. Break'ers, waves  of the sea broken by rocks. 6. Cheer, state of mind.        XLVI. THE CREATOR. (126)    The poetry at the close of this selection is by John Keble, a celebrated  English clergyman, born in 1792. He held for some years the professorship  of Poetry at Oxford University. He died in 1866.    1. Come, and I will show you what is beautiful. It is a rose fully blown.  See how she sits upon her mossy stem, the queen of flowers. Her leaves  glow like fire. The air is filled with her sweet odor. She is the delight  of every eye.    2. But there is one fairer than the rose. He that made the rose is more  beautiful than the rose. He is altogether lovely. He is the delight of  every heart.    3. I will show you what is strong. The lion is strong. When he raiseth  himself up from his lair, when he shaketh his mane, when the voice of his  roaring is heard, the cattle of the field fly, and the wild beasts of the  desert hide themselves; for he is terrible.    4. But He who made the lion is stronger than the lion. He can do all  things. He gave us life, and in a moment can take it away, and no one can  save us from his hand.    5. I will show you what is glorious. The sun is glorious. When he shineth  in the clear sky, when he sitteth on his throne in the heavens, and  looketh abroad over the earth, he is the most glorious and excellent  object the eye can behold.    6. But He who made the sun is more glorious than the sun. The eye cannot  look on his dazzling brightness. He seeth all dark places, by night as  well as by day. The light of his countenance is over all the world.    7. This great Being is God. He made all things, but He is more excellent  than all that He has made. He is the Creator, they are the creatures. They  may be beautiful, but He is Beauty. They may be strong, but He is  Strength. They may be perfect, but He is Perfection.    8. There is a book, who runs may read,  Which heavenly truth imparts,  And all the lore its scholars need--  Pure eyes and loving hearts.    9.  The works of God, above, below,        Within us, and around,      Are pages in that book, to show        How God himself is found.    10. The glorious sky, embracing all,        Is like the Father's love;      Wherewith encompassed, great and small        In peace and order move.    11. Thou who hast given me eyes to see        And love this sight so fair,      Give me a heart to find out Thee        And read Thee everywhere.      DEFINITIONS.--1. Blown, blossomed, bloomed. O'dor, smell, scent. 3. Lair,  bed of a wild beast. Des'ert, a wilderness, a place where no one lives. 5.  Ex'cel-lent, surpassing others in worth, su-perior. 6. Daz'zling,  overpowering with light. 7. Per-fec'tion, the state of being perfect, so  that nothing is wanting. 8. Im-parts', makes known. Lore, learning. 10.  En-com'passed, surrounded.      EXERCISES.--What is described as beautiful? As strong? As glorious? Who is  more beautiful than the rose, stronger than the lion, and more glorious  than the sun? What is the book which we may all read? What should it teach  us?        XLVII. THE HORSE. (128)    1. Uncle Thomas. Well, boys, I am glad to see you again. Since I last saw  you I have made quite a tour, and at some future time will describe to you  what I have seen. I promised at this meeting, however, to tell you  something about animals, and I propose to begin with the horse. But I know  that you like stories better than lecturing, so I will proceed at once to  tell you some which I have gathered for you.    2. Frank. We never feel tired of listening to you, Uncle Thomas. We know  you always have something curious to tell us.    3. Uncle Thomas. Well then, Frank, to begin at once with the horse.    4. In several parts of the world there are to be found large herds of wild  horses. In South America the immense plains are inhabited by them, and it  is said that ten thousand are sometimes found in a single herd. These  herds are always preceded by a leader, who directs their motions; and such  is the regularity with which they perform their movements, that it seems  as if they could hardly be surpassed by the best trained cavalry.    5. It is extremely dangerous for travelers to meet a herd of this  description. When they are unaccustomed to the sight of such a mass of  creatures, they can not help feeling greatly alarmed at their rapid and  apparently irresistible approach. The trampling of the animals sounds like  distant thunder; and such is the rapidity and impetuosity of their  advance, that it seems to threaten instant destruction.    6. Sometimes, however, they suddenly stop short, utter a loud and piercing  neigh, and, with a rapid wheel, take an opposite course, and altogether  disappear. On such occasions it requires great care in the traveler to  prevent his horses from breaking loose and escaping with the wild herd.    7. In those countries where wild horses are so plentiful, the inhabitants  do not take the trouble to raise others, but whenever they want one they  mount upon an animal accustomed to the sport, and gallop over the plain  toward a herd, which is readily found at no great distance.    8.

I don't know how either her  mother or I can ever do without her! ever make up our minds to resign her  to any one else!\"    \"I don't wonder at it, sir,\" the captain said with feeling. \"But may I  understand that you do not object to me personally?\"    \"No, sir, oh no! I see no objection to you more than to any other, except  disparity of years, Violet being so young; and that is not so great as it  was between her parents.\"    \"Then you give me some hope?\"    \"If you have won her affections, yes. How is it in regard to that?\"    \"I have said no word to her on the subject, Mr. Dinsmore--feeling that the  more honorable course was first to ask permission of her mother and  yourself--and am by no means certain that she cares for me at all except  as a friend of the family and of her cousin, Lieut. Keith. Have I your  consent, sir?\"    \"I will talk with my daughter, captain, and let you know the result.\"    He rose as if to leave the room, but the captain detained him.    \"Let me tell you,\" he said, coloring in spite of himself, \"that I am not  rich, having very little beside my pay.\"    \"That is a matter of small importance,\" Mr. Dinsmore answered in a kindly  tone, \"seeing that riches are so apt to take wings and fly away, and that  the Master said, 'A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the  things which he possesseth.' If her mother's wealth remains, Violet will  be well provided for, as I presume you are aware, yet I cannot for a  moment suppose you capable of seeking her on that account. In fact,\" he  concluded with a smile, \"the child has nothing at all of her own, and her  mother can, should she choose, leave her penniless.\"    \"And I should be more than willing to take her so, if I could get her,\"  the captain answered, returning the smile; \"it would be a dear delight to  me to provide her with all things desirable by my own exertions.\"    \"Excuse the question, Capt. Raymond, but have you taken into consideration  the fact that Violet's extreme youth must render her unfit for the cares  and responsibilities of motherhood to your children?\"    \"Mr. Dinsmore, there is not a woman in a thousand of those twice her age  whom I would as willingly trust. But she shall have no care or labor that  I can save her from, always supposing I can be so happy as to win her for  my own.\"    The family had retired for the night to their own apartments. Mrs.  Travilla, almost ready to seek her couch, sat alone in her dressing-room  in front of the brightly blazing wood fire; her open Bible was in her  hand, a lamp burning on a little table by the side of her easy-chair.    Her dressing-gown of soft white cashmere became her well, and her unbound  hair lying in rich masses on her shoulders lent a very youthful look to  face and figure.    Her father thought, as he came softly in and stood at her side, gazing  down upon her, that he had seldom seen her more rarely beautiful.    She lifted her eyes to his with the old sweet smile of filial love and  reverence, shut her book and laid it on the table.    He laid his hand gently on her head, bent down and kissed her on brow and  cheek and lip.    \"Dear papa, won't you sit down?\" she said, rising to draw up a chair for  him.    \"Yes,\" he answered; \"I want a little talk with you. How wonderfully young  you look to-night!--so like my little girl of other days that I feel a  strong inclination to invite you to your old seat upon my knee. Will you  take it?\" sitting down and drawing her gently toward him.    She yielded to his wish, saying, as she put her arm about his neck and  gazed lovingly into his eyes, \"I am still child enough to enjoy it  greatly, if I am not so heavy as to weary you, my dear father.\"    \"I do not feel your weight unpleasantly,\" he returned. \"You must remember  I am a very strong man, and you but a slight and delicate woman. Not so  plump as I could wish to see you,\" he added, pushing up the sleeve of her  gown and clasping his fingers round the white arm.    \"Isn't there plenty of flesh there to hide the bones?\" she asked  laughingly.    \"The bones are well hidden, but the flesh is not so solid as I would have  it.\"    \"Ah, papa, you must not be so hard to please!\" she said, with playful look  and tone. \"I think I'm in very good condition; am glad I'm not too heavy  to sit here and play at being your own little girl again. What happy days  those were! when I had not a care or anxiety except to please my earthly  and my heavenly father.\"    \"Would you like to go back to them?\"    \"No, dear father, your love and tender care made me a very happy child,  but I have no desire to retrace my steps. I should far rather press  forward to the heavenly home whither you are travelling with me--'the rest  that remaineth to the people of God,' rest from sin as well as from  sorrow, pain, and care.\"    \"'Casting _all_ you care upon _Him_, for He careth for you.' He who ever  liveth; He who hath all power in heaven and in earth; He who has said, 'I  have loved thee with an everlasting love,' 'I will never leave thee nor  forsake thee.' Dear daughter, if cares and anxieties oppress you, ask  yourself what right a Christian has to be troubled with them.\"    \"None, papa,\" she answered humbly; \"I am thankful that I can say a belief  in His love and power prevents them from pressing very heavily, yet it is  my grief and shame that my faith is often too weak to lift the burden  entirely.\"    \"What is the particular burden to-night?\" he asked tenderly.    \"My absent darlings, papa: my Elsie, now beginning with the cares of  married life, my eldest son exposed to I know not what dangers and  temptations.\"    \"But with the very same Almighty Friend their mother has to watch over and  protect, to comfort and sustain them.\"    \"Yes, papa! Oh, I ought not to have one anxious thought about them!\"    \"When such thoughts will arise, dear child, turn them into petitions on  their behalf, and believing in God's willingness to hear and answer  prayer, your heart may grow light.    \"But this is not exactly what I came to talk about.\" Then he repeated the  substance of his conversation with Capt. Raymond, and asked what answer  she would give.    Her surprise was as great as her father's had been, and a look of sore  pain came into her face as she exclaimed, \"Violet! my little Vi! must I  lose her too?\"    \"Perhaps not, dearest; it may be that she cares nothing for him. But you  need decide nothing to-night, and must try not to let the question keep  you awake.\"    For a moment she seemed lost in thought, then lifting to his, eyes  brimful of tears, \"Papa,\" she said tremulously, \"I cannot stand in the way  of my child's happiness, therefore I must let him speak, and learn from  her own lips whether she cares for him or not.\"    \"Yes, I think you are right. And now, daughter dear, I must bid you  good-night. But first I want you to promise me that you will determinately  cast this care on the Lord, and not let it rob you of needed sleep.\"    They had both risen, and as he spoke he took her in his arms and held her  close to his heart.    \"I will, papa, in obedience to Him and to you,\" she said, while for a  moment her arm was about his neck, her head laid upon his breast.          CHAPTER XIII.        \"On you most loved, with anxious fear I wait,       And from your judgment must expect my fate.\"                               --_Addison_.      Naturally Elsie's first waking thoughts on the following morning were of  Violet and her future. She was not a \"match-making mamma,\" not at all  desirous to be rid of her daughters, and had never once thought of Capt.  Raymond as a possible suitor for Violet.    He was not a very young man, and it was difficult to realize that Vi was  grown up enough for her hand to be sought in marriage by even one near her  own age, much less by the father of a family whose eldest child could not  be very many years younger than she.    \"She surely cannot fancy him!\" the mother said to herself with a sigh of  relief; but instantly came the remembrance that the disparity of years had  been still greater between herself and the husband she had loved with all  the strength of her nature--so loved that never for a moment could she  admit the idea of the possibility that any other could fill his place in  her heart. What more could she ask for her beloved child, for this life,  than such wedded bliss as she herself had known?    But how could she spare her! especially so soon after resigning her sweet  namesake daughter to another. It was only the unselfishness of her mother  love which could at all reconcile her to the thought.    She longed to know whether she were likely to be called upon to make the  sacrifice, but generously resolved to use no means to discover the state  of her child's feelings until the captain had spoken. In the mean while  she would neither make an opportunity for him nor throw any obstacle in  his way.    Her toilet was scarcely complete, and she had just dismissed her maid,  when a tap on her dressing-room door was followed by her father's  entrance.    \"Ah, papa! good-morning!\" she said, her face growing bright with pleasure.  \"Are you well, my dear father?\" going to him and putting her arms about  his neck.    \"Perfectly, my darling,\" he said, caressing her. \"How are you? how did you  sleep?\"    \"I am able to answer, Very well indeed, to both questions, papa,\" she  returned brightly.    \"You didn't let worrying thoughts keep you awake?\"    \"Oh, no, sir!\"    \"And is your answer to Capt. Raymond still the same?\"    \"Yes, papa,\" she said, with an involuntary sigh.    \"I don't believe you wish him success,\" he remarked, with a slight smile  and a keen, searching look into her face.    \"No,\" she said, the tears starting to her eyes; \"I had thought to keep my  sweet child for years to come.\"    \"But you have no objection to him, more than you would have to any"]]]
