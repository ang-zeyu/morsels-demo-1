Oddly enough, this last consideration afforded me least satisfaction; it  seemed to bring home to me by force of contrast the poor figure that I  must assuredly cut in the eyes of the other two, the still poorer  opinion that they would have of me if ever they knew all. I did not care  to pursue this train of thought. It was a subject upon which I was not  prepared to examine myself; to change it, I thought of Bob's present  peril, which I had almost forgotten as I lounged abstractedly in the  empty hall. If anything were to happen to him, in the vulgar sense! What  an irony, what poetic punishment for us survivors! And yet, even as I  rehearsed the ghastly climax in my mind, I told myself that the mother  would rather see him even thus, than married to a widow who had also  been divorced; it was the younger woman who would never forgive me, or  herself.    Disappointed faces met me on my next visit to the veranda. The little  crowd there had dwindled to a group. I could have had the telescope now  for as long as I liked: the upper part of the Matterhorn was finally and  utterly effaced and swallowed up by dense white mist and cloud. My  friend the mountaineer looked grave, but his disfigured face did not  wear the baulked expression of others to which he drew my attention.    \"It is like the curtain coming down with the man's head still in the  lion's mouth,\" said he.    \"I hope,\" said I devoutly, \"that you don't seriously think there's any  analogy?\"    The climber looked at me steadily, and then smiled.    \"Well, no, perhaps I don't think it quite so bad as all that. But it's  no use pretending it isn't dangerous. May I ask if you know who the  foolhardy fellow is?\"    I said I did not know, but mentioned my suspicion, only begging my  climbing friend not to let the name go any farther. It was in too many  mouths already, in quite another connection, I was going on to explain;  but the mountaineer nodded, as much as to warn me that even he knew all  about that. It was Bob's office, however, to provide the hotel with its  sensation while he remained, and he was not allowed to perform  anonymously very long. His departure over night leaked out. I was asked  if it was true. The flight of Mrs. Lascelles was the next discovery;  desperate deductions were drawn at once. She had jilted the unlucky  youth and sent him in utter recklessness on his intentionally suicidal  ascent. Nobody any longer expected to see him come down alive; so much I  gathered from the fragments of conversation that reached my ears; and  never was better occupation for a bad day than appeared to be afforded  by the discussion of the supposititious tragedy in all its imaginary  details. As, however, the talk invariably abated at my approach, giving  place to uncomplimentary glances in my direction, I could not but infer  that public opinion had assigned me an unenviable part in the piece.  Perhaps I deserved it, though not from their point of view.    The afternoon was at once a dreariness and a dread. There was no ray of  sun without, no sort of warmth within. The Matterhorn never reappeared,  but seemed the grimmer monster for this sinister invisibility. I  gathered that there was real occasion for anxiety, if not for alarm, and  I nursed mine chiefly in my own room until I heard the news when I went  down for my letters. Bob Evers had walked in as though nothing had  happened, and gone straight up to his room with a note that the  concierge handed him. Some one had asked him whether it was he who had  been up the Matterhorn in the morning, and young Evers had vouchsafed  the barest affirmative compatible with civility. The sunburnt climber  was my informant.    \"And I don't mind telling you it is a relief to me,\" he added, \"and to  everybody, though I shouldn't wonder if there was a little unconscious  disappointment in the air as well. I congratulate you, for I could see  you were anxious, and I must find an opportunity of congratulating your  young friend himself.\"    Meanwhile no such opportunity was afforded me, though I quite expected  and was fully prepared for another visit from Bob in my room. I waited  for him there until dinner-time, but he never came, and I was beginning  to wish he would. It was like the wrapping of the Matterhorn in mist; it  only widened the field of apprehension; and yet it was not for me to go  to the boy. My unrest was further aggravated by a letter which I had  just received from the boy's mother in answer to my first to her. It was  not a very dreadful letter; but I only trusted that no evil impulse had  caused Catherine to write in anything like the same strain to Bob; for  neither was it a very charitable letter, nor one that a man could be  glad to get from the woman whom he had set out on an enduring pinnacle.  There was only this to be said for it, that years ago I had sought in  vain for a really human weakness in Catherine Evers, and now at last I  had found one. She was rather too human about Mrs. Lascelles.    I looked for Bob both at and after dinner, but we were never within  speaking distance and I fancied he avoided even my eye. What had Mrs.  Lascelles said? He looked redder and browner and rougher in the face,  but I heard that he would hardly open his lips at table, that he was  almost surly on the subject of his exploit. Everybody else appeared to  me to be speaking of it, or of Bob himself; but I had him on my nerves  and may well have formed an exaggerated impression about it all. Only I  do not forget some of the things I did overhear that day, and night; and  they now had the effect of sending me in search of Bob, since Bob would  not come near me. \"I will have it out with him,\" I grimly decided, \"and  then get out of this myself by the first train going.\" I had had quite  enough of the place that had enchanted me up to the last four-and-twenty  hours. I began to see myself back in Elm Park Gardens. There, at least,  if also there alone, I should get some credit for what I had done.    It was no use looking for Bob upon the terrace now; yet I did look  there, among other obvious places, before I could bring myself to knock  at his door. There was a light in his room, so I knew that he was there,  and he cried out admittance in so sharp a tone that I fancied he also  knew who knocked. I found him packing in his shirt-sleeves. He received  me with a stare in exact keeping with his tone. What on earth had Mrs.  Lascelles said?    \"Going away?\" I asked, as a mere preliminary, and I shut the door behind  me. Bob followed the action with raised eyebrows, then flung me the  shortest possible affirmative, as he bent once more over the suit-case on  the bed.    But in a few seconds he looked up.    \"Anything I can do for you, Clephane?\"    \"That depends where you are going.\"    Bob went on packing with a smile. I guessed where he was going. \"I  thought there might be something pressing,\" he remarked, without looking  up again.    \"There is,\" said I. \"There is something you can do for me on the spot.  You can try to believe that I have not meant to be quite such a skunk as  I may have seemed--to you,\" I was on the point of adding, but I stopped  short of that advisedly, as I thought of Mrs. Lascelles also.    \"Oh, that's all right,\" said Bob, in a would-be airy tone that carried  its own contradiction. \"All's fair, according to the proverb; I no more  blame you than you would have blamed me. I hope, on the contrary, that I  may congratulate you.\"    And he stood up with a look which, coupled with his words, made it my  turn to stare.    \"Indeed you may not,\" said I.    \"Aren't you engaged to her?\" he asked.    \"Good God, no!\" I cried. \"What made you think so?\"    \"Everything!\" exclaimed Bob, after a moment's pause of obvious  bewilderment. \"I--you see--I had a note from Mrs. Lascelles herself!\"    \"Yes?\" said I, carefully careless, but I wanted more than ever to know  that missive's gist.    \"Only a few lines,\" Bob went on, ruefully; \"they are the first thing I  heard or saw when I got down, and they almost made me wish I'd come down  with a run! Well, it's no use talking about it, I only thought you'd  know. It was the usual smack in the eye, I suppose, only nicely put and  all that. She didn't tell me where she was going, or why; she told me I  had better ask you.\"    \"But you wouldn't condescend.\"    Bob gave a rather friendly little laugh.    \"I said I'd see you damned!\" he admitted. \"But of course I thought you  were the lucky man. I still half believe you are!\"    \"Well, I'm not.\"    \"Do you mean to say that she's refused you too?\"    \"She hasn't had the chance.\"    Bob's eyes opened to an infantile width.    \"But you told me you were in earnest!\" he urged.    \"As much in earnest as you were, I believe was what I said.\"    \"That's the same thing,\" returned Bob, sharply. \"You may not think it  is. I don't care what you think. But I'm very sorry you said you were in  earnest if you were not.\"    And his tone convinced me that he was no longer commiserating himself;  he was sorry on some new account, and the evident reality of his regret  filled me in turn with all the qualms of a guilty conscience.    \"Why are you sorry?\" I demanded.    \"Oh, not on my own account,\" said Bob. \"I'm delighted, personally, of  course.\"    \"Then do you mean to say--you actually told her--I was as much in  earnest as you were?\"    Bob Evers smiled openly in my face; it was the only revenge he ever  took; and even it was tempered by the inextinguishable sweetness of  expression and the childlike wide-eyed candour which were Bob's even in  the hour of his humiliation, and will be, one hopes, all his days.    \"Not in so many words,\" he said, \"but I am afraid I did tell her in  effect. You see, I took you at your word. I thought it was quite true.  I'm awfully sorry, Duncan.

This will reveal the median nerve  itself situated upon the red fibres of the flexor metacarpi internus  muscle. If not fortunate enough to have cut immediately over the nerve, it  can be readily felt with the finger between the belly of the flexor muscle  and the radius.'[A]    [Footnote A: _Journal of Comparative Pathology and Therapeutics_, vol. ix.,  p. 181.]    The nerve exposed, the remainder of the operation is exactly as that  described in removing the portion of the nerve in the plantar operation.  The wound is sutured and suitably dressed, and a fair amount of exercise  afterwards allowed the patient.      F. LENGTH OF REST AFTER NEURECTOMY.    This is placed by the majority of surgeons at about three weeks to a  month. Within that period no excessive exertion should be undergone by  the patient. A certain amount of quiet exercise, however, is beneficial,  facilitating the healing of the wounds, and accustoming the animal to the  altered condition of his limb.      G. SEQUELAE OF NEURECTOMY.    These we shall relate collectively, making no distinction between those  following excision of the plantar nerve and those succeeding section of the  median. It must be remembered by the surgeon, however, that the unfortunate  sequelae we are now about to describe are likely to be far more grave when  following section of the larger nerve.    _Liability of Pricked Foot going undetected_.--On account of the warning  they convey to the surgeon, first place among the sequelae of neurectomy  must be given to accidents following loss of sensation. Take, for example,  punctured foot. In any case, in the sense of being unforeseen, it is  accidental. In the neurectomized foot it becomes doubly accidental, in that  not only is it unforeseen, but that it is for some time indiscoverable.  With the foot deprived of sensation, a nail may be picked up, or a prick  sustained at the forge, and no intimation given to the attendant until pus  has underrun the horn, and broken out at the coronet. What follows, then,  is that the hoof as a whole, or the greater part of it, sloughs off.    No neurectomy should be undertaken unless this contingency has been allowed  for. The owner should be advised of it by the surgeon, who should at the  same time enjoin on his client the absolute necessity of giving to the  neurectomized foot daily and careful attention.    _Loss of Tone in the Non-sensitive Area_.--In addition to the mischief  resulting from a wound going undetected, it must be remembered that the  loss of tone resulting from the operation gives to every wound (however  slight), in the region supplied by the removed nerve, a sluggish and  troublesome character. Difficult to deal with as wounds about the foot  ordinarily are, they are rendered more so by a previous neurectomy.    _Gelatinous Degeneration_. This is a condition liable to occur in cases  where the operation has been too long deferred, and when considerable  structural alteration has already taken place in the shape of diseased bone  or tendon, more especially in navicular disease. It consists in a peculiar  softening of the structures of the limb, accompanied with enlargement,  due to swelling of the connective tissues, the enlargement and softening  generally making itself first apparent by a soft, pulpy swelling in the  hollow of the heel.    From this onwards the enlargement increases, and lameness becomes  excessive, the animal going more and more on his heels, until, finally, no  portion of the solar surface of the foot comes to the ground at all.    The case is hopeless, and destruction should be advised.    _Reported Case_.--'The patient, a brown carriage gelding, was brought to  the Royal Veterinary College infirmary in a cart on December 31, the only  previous history obtainable being that it had suddenly fallen lame a month  before.    'The symptoms presented were excessive lameness of the near fore-limb. On  being trotted, the toe was elevated each time the foot reached the ground,  progression being entirely on the heels. Separation of the hoof for about 2  inches at the hinder part of the coronet; oedematous swelling from foot to  knee, extending during the next three days to the elbow. Great tenderness  between the knee and the fetlock; below this no sensation whatever, as a  pin was inserted in several places round the coronet without causing any  symptoms of pain. On further examination, two unnerving scars were found.  No treatment was adopted, and the horse was destroyed on January 6.    'On dissecting the leg, the following appearances presented themselves:    'The limb was very much enlarged, due to thickening of the connective  tissue, the skin being removed only with difficulty. The tendons were soft  and much thickened. A rupture of the skin at the coronet, just where the  skin meets the wall of the foot. Large extravasations of blood at the back  of the tendons, situated in the lower half. _External_ nerve trunk had  become reunited, at the point of junction there being a hard lump about  the size of a walnut. _Internal_ nerve trunk also had become reunited, and  presented a thickened portion at the point of junction, but not so large as  that of the outer side, and situated in the lower half of the tendon, about  2 inches higher than that on the external nerve. This nerve trunk was  atrophied below the thickening, and had undergone gelatinous degeneration.  Judging from the scars on the skin, this side had evidently been unnerved a  week or ten days previously to that on the outer side. The band stretching  across the back of the perforatus, between the external and internal  nerves, appeared on the inside to have become firmly fixed into the tendon.    'On removing the hoof, under the sole there appeared a large quantity of  very foetid pus; the laminae were very much inflamed in patches. There  was an enormous thickening of connective tissues in the heel. On cutting  longitudinally through the perforatus tendon, there was exposed a large  blood-coloured mass, of a gelatinous appearance, situated on the perforatus  tendon, the latter being very much thickened, and growing to the navicular  bone. The underneath surface of the superior suspensory ligament was much  thickened, and firmly adherent to the bone; at the posterior surface of  the metacarpus there was a quantity of gelatinous substance. The anterior  ligament of the fetlock-joint was thickened; the navicular bone was entire,  but showed lesions of navicular disease, being ulcerated. Section through  the bone did not reveal anything further. It may be here remarked that the  ulcerations were on either side of the central ridge, and not at all on the  ridge itself.    'Microscopic examination of the tissue joining the two ends of the nerve  together revealed a few nerve fibres; the general appearance was that  of granulation tissue, containing capillary vessels, which were fairly  plentiful, and comparatively large in size.'[A]    [Footnote A: _Veterinary Record_, vol. iv., p. 386 (Hobday)]    _Chronic Oedema of the Leg_.--In some cases there is a distinct swelling  of the leg some time after the operation. This exposes the limb to the  infliction of sores from striking with the opposite foot, with, of course,  the difficulty in healing we have just described.    _Persistent Pruritus_.--This annoying sequel occurs in the neurectomized  limb, with or without gelatinous degeneration, and appears to be without a  remedy. The itching in some cases is so intense as to lead the animal to  constantly gnaw at the top of the foot. As one observer has remarked, the  animal may begin literally biting pieces out of his limb. The result of the  irritation and gnawing is fatal. Great sloughing of the parts takes place,  and the animal has eventually to be slaughtered.    _Fracture of the Bones_.--The sudden loss of sensation in a foot may cause  the animal to use violently the limb he has for months past been carefully  nursing. It may be that the lameness for which the operation has been  performed has been due to disease existing in the navicular bone, and  extending, perhaps, to the os pedis. By the disease the bone has already  been made brittle, its substance and ligamentous attachments perchance  weakened and broken up by a slow-spreading caries, and rarefaction of the  remaining bone substance rendered almost certain. In this instance, the  free use of the foot, and the application to the diseased structures of an  unwonted pressure immediately after the operation results in fracture. With  the rupture of the structures we get the elevated toe and soft swelling in  the heel, as described in gelatinous degeneration. Treatment, of course, is  out of the question.    _Neuroma_.--A further sequel is the appearance at the seat of the operation  of what is termed an 'amputational neuroma.' This is a tumour-like  growth occurring on the end of the divided nerve. It is composed of  connective-tissue elements permeated by nerve fibres which have grown out  from the axis-cylinders of the nerve stump. It may vary in size from a pea  to a hazel-nut, and is frequently the cause of much pain. This must be cut  down upon and cleanly removed, taking away at the same time as much of the  nerve as is possible.    _Reunion of the Divided Nerve_.--We may say at once that 'reunion' in the  popular sense of the word does not take place. At a varying period after  section, however, we do get a return of sensation. This is brought about in  the following manner: The axis-cylinder of the nerve, still in connection  with the spinal cord, swells somewhat, and hypertrophies. The cells of this  hypertrophied portion show a great tendency to proliferate and produce  new nerve structure. This growing point splits, and gives rise to several  fibrils, which are new axis-cylinders. These commence to grow towards the  periphery, and, in so doing, grow through the cicatricial"]]]
