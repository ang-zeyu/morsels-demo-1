On account of the inheritance of a depraved and pathological  constitution, the children of intemperate parents frequently suffer from  an abnormal psychical organization. As in the progeny of insane,  epileptics, suicides, and criminals, so also among the children of  drunkards, do we see cases of congenital idiocy and imbecility, of  neurasthenia and inebriety, of psychical and somatic degeneracy, also of  depraved morality, of vagrancy and crime.    Mr. President and Gentlemen: In the light of the enumerated facts,  nobody will dispute that intemperance is a fruitful as well as  inexhaustible source for the increase and development of insanity; and  that every effort toward diminution of the frequency of insanity, toward  the prevention of mental diseases, must be directed against this  widespread evil, intemperance.    May your noble society succeed in confining this torrent of evil in a  narrower growing bed, and to deliver mankind from a curse which cannot  be too much contended with.           *       *       *       *       *          PLANTAIN AS A STYPTIC.    [Footnote: Read at the meeting of the Amer. Pharm. Assoc.]    By J.W. COLCORD.      Several articles during the past few months, copied from English  pharmaceutical journals, calling attention to the styptic properties of  plantain leaves--Plantago major--having attracted my attention, I  determined to try a few experiments when opportunity offered. Having a  shiftless neighbor whose yard produced a bountiful crop of the article,  I was easily able to secure an abundant supply for my experiments.  Believing that better results would be obtained from fresh plants than  from dried, I expressed the juice from them by means of an \"Enterprise\"  mill, obtaining about 16 fluid ounces of juice from 3 pounds of leaves.  The juice was of a light green color, very turbid, evidently caused by a  large amount of chlorophyl. Setting aside 4 ounces of the filtered  liquid for further experimenting, I packed the residue from the press  into a conical glass percolator and exhausted with dilute alcohol,  evaporating the percolate in a water-bath to two ounces, mixing with the  12 ounces of expressed juice and adding 2 ounces of alcohol. This  preparation, which I call a fluid extract, represents virtually equal  parts by weight of the dried plants. It is of a dark brown color with a  marked odor of the recent plant, and so far, after standing three months  undisturbed on my shelves, shows no sign of precipitation.    My next experiment was a mixture of equal quantities of the expressed  juice with glycerin. At the present time, after standing three months,  the mixture is clear and bright, with no sign of precipitation. This, I  think, promises to be the most efficient preparation, and will prove  valuable as an injection in the treatment of leucorrhoea, hemorrhages,  and similar disorders.    Experiment number three was made with equal parts of the juice and  alcohol, and number four with three parts of the juice with one part of  alcohol.    In a short time a precipitate was observed in both samples in about  equal proportions, and was removed about one month after making by  filtering through paper, and neither has shown signs of precipitation  since, and continue bright, clear, light-brown liquids.    Of their therapeutic value as styptics, I have not had sufficient trial  to form an opinion, although, as far as I can judge, they have proved  satisfactory. While writing this article, a cook from a neighboring  restaurant, with a finger sliced off in a potato slicer, exposing the  bone, came in for treatment. Having bandaged I applied the glycerate,  which soon stopped the profuse bleeding, giving her a small bottle of it  to apply subsequently. I asked her to report to me in two or three days,  and, on reporting, I found a healthy granulation presenting. Its styptic  properties are undoubtedly due to tannic acid, as all the tests I have  been able to make prove this to be the case. The readiness with which it  can be obtained in the summer renders it a valuable adjunct,  undoubtedly, to the materia medica of the country practitioner or  housewife for stopping hemorrhages in simple wounds.    The bruised leaves applied directly usually prove sufficient for the  purpose; as to whether it will prove sufficiently valuable to add to our  list of pharmaceutical preparations will require longer and more  extended experiment.--_New Remedies_.           *       *       *       *       *          DANGER FROM FLIES.      Dr. Grassi is said (_British Medical Journal_) to have made an  important, and by no means pleasant, discovery in regard to flies. It  was always recognized that these insects might carry the germs of  infection on their wings or feet, but it was not known that they are  capable of taking in at the mouth such objects as the ova of various  worms, and of discharging them again unchanged in their faeces. This  point has now been established, and several striking experiments  illustrate it. Dr. Grassi exposed in his laboratory a plate containing a  great number of the eggs of a human parasite, the _Tricocephalus  dispar_. Some sheets of white paper were placed in the kitchen, which  stands about ten meters from the laboratory. After some hours, the usual  little spots produced by the faeces of flies were found on the paper.  These spots, when examined by the microscope, were found to contain some  of the eggs of the tricocephalus. Some of the flies themselves were then  caught, and their intestines presented large numbers of the ova. Similar  experiments with the ova of the _Oxyuris vermicularis_ and of the  _Toenia solium_ afforded corresponding results. Shortly after the flies  had some mouldy cream, the _Oidium lactis_ was found in their faeces. Dr.  Grassi mentions an innocuous and yet conclusive experiment that every  one can try. Sprinkle a little lycopodium on sweetened water, and  afterward examine the faeces and intestines of the flies; numerous spores  will be found. As flies are by no means particular in choosing either a  place to feed or a place to defecate, often selecting meat or food for  the purpose, a somewhat alarming vision of possible consequences is  raised.           *       *       *       *       *          THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY'S GARDENS.      The erection of the new house for the accommodation of the serpents,  alligators, and other reptiles, which is shown in our illustration, must  be commended as a valuable improvement of the Zoological Society's  establishment in Regent's Park. This building, which has a rather  stately aspect and is of imposing dimensions, constructed of brick and  terracotta, with a roof of glass and iron, stands close to the south  gate of the Gardens, entered from the Broad Walk of the Park. The  visitor, on entering by that gate, should turn immediately to the left  hand, along the narrow path beside the aviary of the Chinese golden  pheasants, and will presently come to the Reptile House, which is too  much concealed from view by some of the sheds for the deer. The spacious  interior, represented in our view, is one of the most agreeable places  in the whole precinct of these gardens, being well aired and lighted,  very nicely paved, and tastefully decorated in pale color, with some  fine tropical plants in tubs on the floor, or in the windows, and in  baskets hanging from the roof. Three oval basins, with substantial  margins of concrete, so formed as to prevent the reptiles crawling over  them, while one basin is further protected by an iron grating, contain  water in which the alligators, the infant crocodiles, and a number of  tortoises, but none of the larger species, make themselves quite at  home. One side of the house, with its windows looking into a pleasant  airy vestibule, is occupied by many small glass cases for the smaller  lizards, with boxes and pots of flowers set between them upon tables,  which present a very attractive exhibition. The other three sides of the  hall, which is nearly square, are entirely devoted to the large wall  cages, with fronts of stout plate glass, in single sheets, rising about  14 feet to the roof, in which the serpents are confined--the huge  pythons, anaconda, and boa constrictor, the poisonous cobras and  rattlesnakes, and others well known to the visitors at these gardens.  Each cage or compartment has a sliding door of iron behind, to which the  keeper has access in a passage running along the back of the wall, and  there are doors also from one compartment to another. The floor is of  smooth slate, and the largest snake has ample space to uncoil itself, or  to climb up the trunks and branches of trees placed there for its  exercise and amusement.    [Illustration: THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY'S GARDENS. THE BABIROUSSA FAMILY.]      THE BABIROUSSA.    We present, on the same page, a few sketches of the babiroussas, a male  and two females, with a young one, recently presented to the society by  Dr. F.H. Bauer. These animals, which are from Celebes, in the Malay  Archipelago, have been placed temporarily in different stalls of the  ostrich house, on the north side of the gardens. The babiroussa is a  species of wild hog, peculiar to the islands of Eastern Asia, and  remarkable, in the male animal, for the extraordinary growth and  direction of the canine teeth. The upper pair of canine teeth, growing  out through the upper jaw, curve backward and upward on the forehead,  having somewhat the aspect of horns; while the lower canine teeth form a  pair of crooked tusks in the under jaw. These teeth may be useful for  defensive fighting, as a guard to the head, but could not serve for  attack. The skull of a babiroussa, with the teeth fully developed, is in  the possession of Mr. Bartlett, the able superintendent of the  Zoological Society's collection.--_Illustrated London News_.

Colonial  possessions which merely serve the purpose of acquiring wealth, and are  only used for economic ends, while the owner-State does not think of  colonizing in any form or raising the position of the aboriginal  population in the economic or social scale, are unjustifiable and  immoral, and can never be held permanently. \"But that colonization which  retains a uniform nationality has become a factor of immense importance  for the future of the world. It will determine the degree in which each  nation shares in the government of the world by the white race. It is  quite imaginable that a count owns no colonies will no longer count  among the European Great Powers, however powerful it may otherwise be.\"  [F]    [Footnote F: Treitschke, \"Politik,\" i., Section 8.]    We are already suffering severely from the want of colonies to meet our  requirements. They would not merely guarantee a livelihood to our  growing working population, but would supply raw materials and  foodstuffs, would buy goods, and open a field of activity to that  immense capital of intellectual labour forces which is to-day lying  unproductive in Germany, or is in the service of foreign interests. We  find throughout the countries of the world German merchants, engineers,  and men of every profession, employed actively in the service of foreign  masters, because German colonies, when they might be profitably engaged,  do not exist. In the future, however, the importance of Germany will  depend on two points: firstly, how many millions of men in the world  speak German? secondly, how many of them are politically members of the  German Empire?    These are heavy and complicated duties, which have devolved on us from  the entire past development of our nation, and are determined by its  present condition as regards the future. We must be quite clear on this  point, that no nation has had to reckon with the same difficulties and  hostility as ours. This is due to the many restrictions of our political  relations, to our unfavourable geographical position, and to the course  of our history. It was chiefly our own fault that we were condemned to  political paralysis at the time when the great European States built  themselves up, and sometimes expanded into World Powers. We did not  enter the circle of the Powers, whose decision carried weight in  politics, until late, when the partition of the globe was long  concluded. All which other nations attained in centuries of natural  development--political union, colonial possessions, naval power,  international trade--was denied to our nation until quite recently. What  we now wish to attain must be _fought for_, and won, against a superior  force of hostile interests and Powers.    It is all the more emphatically our duty plainly to perceive what paths  we wish to take, and what our goals are, so as not to split up our  forces in false directions, and involuntarily to diverge from the  straight road of our intended development.    The difficulty of our political position is in a certain sense an  advantage. By keeping us in a continually increasing state of tension,  it has at least protected us so far from the lethargy which so often  follows a long period of peace and growing wealth. It has forced us to  stake all our spiritual and material forces in order to rise to every  occasion, and has thus discovered and strengthened resources which will  be of great value whenever we shall be called upon to draw the sword.          CHAPTER V        WORLD POWER OR DOWNFALL    In discussing the duties which fall to the German nation from its  history and its general as well as particular endowments, we attempted  to prove that a consolidation and expansion of our position among the  Great Powers of Europe, and an extension of our colonial possessions,  must be the basis of our future development.    The political questions thus raised intimately concern all international  relations, and should be thoroughly weighed. We must not aim at the  impossible. A reckless policy would be foreign to our national character  and our high aims and duties. But we must aspire to the possible, even  at the risk of war. This policy we have seen to be both our right and  our duty. The longer we look at things with folded hands, the harder it  will be to make up the start which the other Powers have gained on us.      \"The man of sense will by the forelock clutch    Whatever lies within his power,    Stick fast to it, and neither shirk,    Nor from his enterprise be thrust,    But, having once begun to work,    Go working on because he must.\"                                 _Faust_                        (translated by Sir Theodore Martin).    The sphere in which we can realize our ambition is circumscribed by the  hostile intentions of the other World Powers, by the existing  territorial conditions, and by the armed force which is at the back of  both. Our policy must necessarily be determined by the consideration of  these conditions. We must accurately, and without bias or timidity,  examine the circumstances which turn the scale when the forces which  concern us are weighed one against the other.    These considerations fall partly within the military, but belong mainly  to the political sphere, in so far as the political grouping of the  States allows a survey of the military resources of the parties. We must  try to realize this grouping. The shifting aims of the politics of the  day need not be our standard; they are often coloured by considerations  of present expediency, and offer no firm basis for forming an opinion.  We must rather endeavour to recognize the political views and intentions  of the individual States, which are based on the nature of things, and  therefore will continually make their importance felt. The broad lines  of policy are ultimately laid down by the permanent interests of a  country, although they may often be mistaken from short-sightedness or  timidity, and although policy sometimes takes a course which does not  seem warranted from the standpoint of lasting national benefits. Policy  is not an exact science, following necessary laws, but is made by men  who impress on it the stamp of their strength or their weakness, and  often divert it from the path of true national interests. Such  digressions must not be ignored. The statesman who seizes his  opportunity will often profit by these political fluctuations. But the  student who considers matters from the standpoint of history must keep  his eyes mainly fixed on those interests which seem permanent. We must  therefore try to make the international situation in this latter sense  clear, so far as it concerns Germany's power and ambitions.    We see the European Great Powers divided into two great camps.    On the one side Germany, Austria, and Italy have concluded a defensive  alliance, whose sole object is to guard against hostile aggression. In  this alliance the two first-named States form the solid, probably  unbreakable, core, since by the nature of things they are intimately  connected. The geographical conditions force this result. The two States  combined form a compact series of territories from the Adriatic to the  North Sea and the Baltic. Their close union is due also to historical  national and political conditions. Austrians have fought shoulder to  shoulder with Prussians and Germans of the Empire on a hundred  battlefields; Germans are the backbone of the Austrian dominions, the  bond of union that holds together the different nationalities of the  Empire. Austria, more than Germany, must guard against the inroads of  Slavism, since numerous Slavonic races are comprised in her territories.  There has been no conflict of interests between the two States since the  struggle for the supremacy in Germany was decided. The maritime and  commercial interests of the one point to the south and south-east, those  of the other to the north. Any feebleness in the one must react  detrimentally on the political relations of the other. A quarrel between  Germany and Austria would leave both States at the mercy of  overwhelmingly powerful enemies. The possibility of each maintaining its  political position depends on their standing by each other. It may be  assumed that the relations uniting the two States will be permanent so  long as Germans and Magyars are the leading nationalities in the  Danubian monarchy. It was one of the master-strokes of Bismarck's policy  to have recognized the community of Austro-German interests even during  the war of 1866, and boldly to have concluded a peace which rendered  such an alliance possible.    The weakness of the Austrian Empire lies in the strong admixture of  Slavonic elements, which are hostile to the German population, and show  many signs of Pan-Slavism. It is not at present, however, strong enough  to influence the political position of the Empire.    Italy, also, is bound to the Triple Alliance by her true interests. The  antagonism to Austria, which has run through Italian history, will  diminish when the needs of expansion in other spheres, and of creating a  natural channel for the increasing population, are fully recognized by  Italy. Neither condition is impossible. Irredentism will then lose its  political significance, for the position, which belongs to Italy from  her geographical situation and her past history, and will promote her  true interests if attained, cannot be won in a war with Austria. It is  the position of a leading political and commercial Mediterranean Power.  That is the natural heritage which she can claim. Neither Germany nor  Austria is a rival in this claim, but France, since she has taken up a  permanent position on the coast of North Africa, and especially in  Tunis, has appropriated a country which would have been the most natural  colony for Italy, and has, in point of fact, been largely colonized by  Italians. It would, in my opinion, have been"]]]
