Christ's sufferings and glory.    1 Now for a tune of lofty praise  To great Jehovah's equal Son!  Awake, my voice, in heavenly lays,  Tell the loud wonders he hath done.    2 Sing how he left the worlds of light  And the bright robes he wore above,  How swift and joyful was his flight  On wings of everlasting love.    3 Down to this base, this sinful earth  He came to raise our nature high;  He came t' atone almighty wrath;  Jesus the God was born to die.]    4 [Hell and its lions roar'd around,  His precious blood the monsters spilt,  While weighty sorrows press'd him down,  Large as the loads of all our guilt.]    5 Deep in the shades of gloomy death  Th' almighty Captive pris'ner lay;  Th' almighty Captive left the earth,  And rose to everlasting day.    6 Lift up your eyes, ye sons of light,  Up to his throne of shining grace,  See what immortal glories sit  Round the sweet beauties of his face.    7 Amongst a thousand harps and songs  Jesus the God exalted reigns,  His sacred Name fills all their tongues  And echoes thro' the heavenly plains!      Hymn 2:44.  Hell; or, The vengeance of God.    1 With holy fear and humble song,  The dreadful God our souls adore;  Reverence and awe becomes the tongue  That speaks the terrors of his power.    2 Far in the deep where darkness dwells,  The land of horror and despair,  Justice has built a dismal hell,  And laid her stores of vengeance there.    3 [Eternal plagues and heavy chains,  Tormenting racks and fiery coals,  And darts t' inflict immortal pains,  Dy'd in the blood of damned souls.]    4 [There Satan the first sinner lies,  And roars, and bites his iron bands;  In vain the rebel strives to rise,  Crush'd with the weight of both thine hands.]    5 There guilty ghosts of Adam's race  Shriek out, and howl beneath thy rod;  Once they could scorn a Saviour's grace,  But they incens'd a dreadful God.    6 Tremble, my soul, and kiss the Son;  Sinners, obey the Saviour's call;  Else your damnation hastens on,  And hell gapes wide to wait your fall.      Hymn 2:45.  God's condescension to our worship.    1 Thy favours Lord, surprise our souls;  Will the Eternal dwell with us?  What canst thou find beneath the poles  To tempt thy chariot downward thus?    2 Still might he fill his starry throne,  And please his ears with Gabriel's songs;  But th' heavenly Majesty comes down,  And bows to hearken to our tongues.    3 Great God, what poor returns we pay  For love so infinite as thine!  Words are but air, and tongues but clay,  But thy compassion's all divine.      Hymn 2:46.  God's condescension to human affairs.    1 Up to the Lord that reigns on high,  And views the nations from afar,  Let everlasting praises fly,  And tell how large his bounties are.    2 [He that can shake the worlds he made,  Or with his word, or with his rod,  His goodness how amazing great!  And what a condescending God!]    3 [God that must stoop to view the skies,  And how to see what angels do,  Down to our earth he casts his eyes,  And bends his footsteps downward too.]    4 He over-rules all mortal things,  And manages our mean affairs;  On humble souls the King of kings  Bestows his counsels and his cares.    5 Our sorrows and our tears we pour  Into the bosom of our God,  He hears us in the mournful hour,  And helps us bear the heavy load.    6 In vain might lofty princes try  Such condescension to perform;  For worms were never rais'd so high  Above their meanest fellow-worm.    7 O could our thankful hearts devise  A tribute equal to thy grace,  To the third heaven our songs should rise,  And teach the golden harps thy praise.      Hymn 2:47.  Glory and grace in the person of Christ.    1 Now to the Lord a noble song!  Awake, my soul, awake, my tongue;  Hosanna to th' eternal Name,  And all his boundless love proclaim.    2 See where it shines in Jesus' face,  The brightest image of his grace;  God, in the person of his Son,  Has all his mightiest works outdone.    3 The spacious earth and spreading flood  Proclaim the wise, the powerful God;  And thy rich glories from afar  Sparkle in every rolling star.    4 But in his looks a glory stands,  The noblest labour of thine hands:  The pleasing lustre of his eyes  Outshines the wonders of the skies.    5 Grace, 'tis a sweet, a charming theme;  My thoughts rejoice at Jesus' name:  Ye angels, dwell upon the sound,  Ye heavens, reflect it to the ground!    6 O, may I live to reach the place  Where he unveils his lovely face,  Where all his beauties you behold,  And sing his Name to harps of gold!      Hymn 2:48.  Love to the creatures is dangerous.    1 How vain are all things here below!  How false, and yet how fair!  Each pleasure hath its poison too,  And every sweet a snare.    2 The brightest things below the sky  Give but a flattering light;  We should suspect some danger nigh  Where we possess delight.    3 Our dearest joys, and nearest friends,  The partners of our blood,  How they divide our wavering minds,  And leave but half for God!    4 The fondness of a creature's love,  How strong it strikes the sense!  Thither the warm affections move,  Nor can we call them thence.    5 Dear Saviour, let thy beauties be  My soul's eternal food;  And grace command my heart away  From all created good.      Hymn 2:49.  Moses dying in the embraces of God.    1 Death cannot make our souls afraid  If God be with us there;  We may walk thro' her darkest shade,  And never yield to fear.    2 I could renounce my all below,  If my Creator bid,  And run, if I were call'd to go,  And die as Moses did.    3 Might I but climb to Pisgah's top,  And view the promis'd land,  My flesh itself shall long to drop,  And pray for the command.    4 Clasp'd in my heavenly Father's arms  I would forget my breath,  And lose my life among the charms  Of so divine a death.      Hymn 2:50.  Comfort under sorrows and pains.    1 Now let the Lord my Saviour smile,  And shew my name upon his heart,  I would forget my pains awhile,  And in the pleasure lose the smart.    But O it swells my sorrows high  To see my blessed Jesus frown!  My spirits sink, my comforts die,  And all the springs of life are down.    3 Yet why, my soul, why these complaints?  Still while he frowns his bowels move;  Still on his heart he bears his saints,  And feels their sorrows and his love.    4 My name is printed on his breast;  His book of life contains my name;  I'd rather have it there impress'd  Than in the bright records of fame.    5 When the last fire burns all things here,  Those letters shall securely stand,  And in the Lamb's fair book appear,  Writ by th' eternal Father's hand.    6 Now shall my minutes smoothly run,  Whil'st here I wait my Father's will;  My rising and my setting sun  Roll gently up and down the hill.      Hymn 2:51.  God the Son equal with the Father.    1 Bright King of Glory, dreadful God!  Our spirits bow before thy seat,  To thee we lift an humble thought,  And worship at thine awful feet.    2 [Thy power hath form'd, thy wisdom sways  All nature with a sovereign word;  And the bright world of stars obeys  The will of their superior Lord.]    3 [Mercy and truth unite in one,  And smiling sit at thy right-hand;  Eternal justice guards thy throne,  And vengeance waits thy dread command.]    4 A thousand seraphs strong and bright  Stand round the glorious Deity;  But who amongst the sons of light  Pretends comparison with thee?    5 Yet there is one of human frame,  Jesus, array'd in flesh and blood,  Thinks it no robbery to claim  A full equality with God.    6 Their glory shines with equal beams;  Their essence is for ever one,  Tho' they are known by different names  The Father God, and God the Son.    7 Then let the name of Christ our King  With equal honours be ador'd;  His praise let every angel sing,  And all the nations own their Lord.      Hymn 2:52.  Death dreadful or delightful.    1 Death! 'tis a melancholy day  To those that have no God,  When the poor soul is forc'd away  To seek her last abode.    2 In vain to heaven she lifts her eyes,  But guilt, a heavy chain,  Still drags her downward from the skies  To darkness, fire, and pain.    3 Awake and mourn, ye heirs of hell,  Let stubborn sinners fear,  You must be driven from earth, and dwell  A long for-ever there.    4 See how the pit gapes wide for you,  And flashes in your face,  And thou, my soul, look downwards too,  And sing recovering grace.    5 He is a God of sovereign love  That promis'd heaven to me,  And taught my thoughts to soar above,  Where happy spirits be.    6 Prepare me, Lord, for thy right-hand,  Then come the joyful day,  Come death, and some celestial band,  To bear my soul away.      Hymn 2:53.  The pilgrimage of the saints; or, Earth and heaven.    1 Lord! what a wretched land is this  That yields us no supply!  No cheering fruits no wholesome trees,  Nor streams of living joy!    2 But pricking thorns thro' all the ground  And mortal poisons grow,  And all the rivers that are found  With dangerous waters flow.    3 Yet the clear path to thine abode  Lies thro' this horrid land;  Lord! we would keep the heavenly road,  And run at thy command.    4 [Our souls shall tread the desert thro'  With undiverted feet;  And faith and flaming zeal subdue  The terrors that we meet.]    5 [A thousand savage beasts of prey "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13376"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage, King AEthelbert, 596 to King George III, 1775 (#18)"],[1,"sokemen. They  were not fighting men, and did not give homage, but might give  fealty, i.e. fidelity. Many free sokemen were caught up in the  subjugation by baron landlords and were reduced almost to the  condition of the unfree villein. The services they performed for  their lords were often indistinguishable. They might also hold  their land by villein tenure, although free as a person with the  legal rights of a freeman. The freeman still had a place in court  proceedings which the unfree villein did not.    Great stone cathedrals were built in fortified towns for the  Conquerer's Norman bishops, who replaced the English bishops. Most  of the existing and new monasteries functioned as training grounds  for scholars, bishops, and statesmen rather than as retreats from  the world's problems to the security of religious observance. The  number of monks grew as the best minds were recruited into the  monasteries.    The Conquerer made the church subordinate to him. Bishops were  elected only subject to the King's consent. The bishops had to  accept the status of barons. Homage was exacted from them before  they were consecrated, and fealty and an oath afterward. The  Conquerer imposed knight's service on bishoprics, abbeys, and  monasteries, which was usually commuted to a monetary amount.  Bishops had to attend the King's court. Bishops could not leave  the realm without the King's consent. No royal tenant or royal  servant could be excommunicated, nor his lands be placed under  interdict, without the King's consent. Interdict could demand, for  instance, that the church be closed and the dead buried in  unconsecrated ground. No church rules could be made without his  agreement to their terms. No letters from the pope could be  received without the King's permission. The Archbishop of  Canterbury was still recognized as a primary advisor to the king.  Over the years, the selection for this office frequently became a  source of contention among king, pope, and clergy.    Men continued to give land to the church for their souls, such as  this grant which started the town of Sandwich: \"William, King of  the English, to Lanfranc the Archbishop and Hugoni de Montfort and  Richard son of Earl Gilbert and Haimo the sheriff and all the  thegns of Kent, French and English, greeting. Know ye that the  Bishop of Bayeux my brother for the love of God and for the  salvation of my soul and his own, has given to St. Trinity all  houses with their appurtenances which he has at Sandwich and that  he has given what he has given by my license.\" Many private owners  of churches gave them to cathedrals or monastic communities,  partly to ensure their long term survival, and partly because of  church pressure.    When the land was all divided out, the barons had about 3/7 of it  and the church about 2/7. Most of the barons had been royal  servants. The king retained about 2/7, including forests for  hunting, for himself and his family and household, on which he  built many royal castles and hundreds of manor [large private  estate headed by a lord] houses throughout the nation. He built  the massive White Tower in London. It was tall with four turrets  on top, and commanded a view of the river and bridge, the city and  the surrounding countryside. The only windows were slits from  which arrows could be shot. On the fourth and top floor was the  council chamber and the gallery of the chapel. On the third floor  was the banqueting hall, the sword room, and the chapel. The king  and his household slept in apartments on these upper floors.  Stairs went up to the gateway entrance on the second floor, which  were hidden by a wall. The garrison's barracks were on the first  floor (ground floor). Any prisoners were kept in cells at a level  below the first floor. The other castles were often built at the  old fortification burhs of Alfred. Each had a constable in charge,  who was a baron. Barons and earls had castle-guard duty in the  king's castles. The Conquerer was constantly moving about the land  among his and his barons' castles, where he met with his magnates  and conducted public business, such as deciding disputes about  holding of land. Near his own castles and other of his property,  he designated many areas as royal hunting forests. Anyone who  killed a deer in these forests was mutilated, for instance by  blinding. People living within the boundaries of the designated  forestland could no longer go into nearby woods to get meat or  honey, dead wood for firing, or live wood for building. Swineherds  could no longer drive pigs into these woods to eat acorns they  beat down from oak trees. Making clearings and grazing livestock  in the designated forestland were prohibited. Most of the nation  was either wooded or bog at this time.    London was a walled town of one and two story houses made of mud,  twigs, and straw, with thatched roofs. It included a bundle of  communities, townships, parishes, and lordships. There were  churches, a goods market, a fish market, quays on the river, and a  bridge over the river. Streets probably named by this time include  Bread Street, Milk Street, Honey Lane, Wood Street, and Ironmonger  Lane. Fairs and games were held outside the town walls in a field  called \"Smithfield\". The great citizens had the land  qualifications of knights and ranked as barons on the Conquerer's  council. The freemen were a small percentage of London's  population. There was a butchers' guild, a pepperers' guild, a  goldsmiths' guild, the guild of St. Lazarus, which was probably a  leper charity (of which there were many in the 1000s and 1100s),  the Pilgrims' guild, which helped people going on pilgrimages, and  four bridge guilds, probably for keeping the wooden London Bridge  in repair. Men told the time by sundials, some of which were  portable and could be carried in one's pocket. London could defend  itself, and a ringing of the bell of St. Paul's Church could shut  every shop and fill the streets with armed horsemen and soldiers  led by a soldier portreeve. Across the Thames from London on its  south side was Southwark, a small trading and fishing settlement.    The Conquerer did not interfere with landholding in London, but  recognized its independence as a borough in this writ: \"William  the King greets William, Bishop of London, and Gosfrith the  portreeve, and all the burgesses [citizens] of London friendly.  Know that I will that you be worthy of all the laws you were  worthy of in the time of King Edward. And I will that every child  shall be his father's heir after his father's day. And I will not  suffer any man to do you wrong. God preserve you.\" The Norman word  \"mayor\" replaced \"portreeve\".    So London was not subjected to the Norman feudal system. It had  neither villeins nor slaves. Whenever Kings asserted authority  over it, the citizens reacted until the king \"granted\" a charter  reaffirming the freedoms of the city and its independence.    Under pressure from the ecclesiastical judges, the Conquerer  replaced the death penalty by that of the mutilation of blinding,  chopping off hands, and castrating offenders. Castration was the  punishment for rape. But these mutilations usually led to a slow  death by gangrene.    The Normans used the Anglo-Saxon concepts of jurisdictional  powers. Thus when the Conquerer confirmed \"customs\" to the abbot  of Ely, these were understood to include the following: 1) sac and  soke - the right to hold a court of private jurisdiction and enjoy  its profits, 2) toll - a payment in towns, markets, and fairs for  goods and chattel bought and sold, 3) team - persons might be  vouched to warranty in the court, the grant of which made a court  capable of hearing suits arising from the transfer of land, 4)  infangenthef - right of trying and executing thieves on one's  land, 4) hamsocne, 5) grithbrice - violation of the grantees'  special peace, for instance that of the sheriff, 6) fightwite -  fine for a general breach of the peace, 7) fyrdwite - fine for  failure to appear in the fyrd.    Every shire, now called \"county\", had at least one burh, or  defensible town. Kings had appointed a royal moneyer in each burh  to mint silver coins such as pennies for local use. On one side  was the King's head in profile and on the other side was the name of  the moneyer. When a new coinage was issued, all moneyers had to go  to London to get the new dies. The Conquerer's head faced  frontally on his dies, instead of the usual profile used by former  Kings.    The Conquerer held and presided over his council three times a  year, as was the custom, at Easter, Christmas, and Whitsuntide,  which coincided with the great Christian festivals. This was an  advisory council and consisted of the Conquerer's wife and sons,  earls, barons, knights, officers of the King's household,  archbishops, and bishops. It replaced the witan of wise men. It  dealt with fundamental matters of law, state, war, and church. Its  functions were largely ceremonial. Earldoms and knighthoods were  conferred and homages to the king were witnessed. Bishops were  nominated. Attendance at the council, like attendance at courts,  was regarded as a burden rather than a privilege. The Conquerer's  will was the motive force which under lay all the council's  action. When it was administering royal justice, it was called the  Royal Court..    The Justiciar was the head of all legal matters and he or the  Conquerer's wife represented the King at the Royal Court in his  absence from the realm. The chamberlain was a financial officer of  the household; his work was rather that of auditor or accountant.  The Chancellor headed the Chancery and the chapel. Other household  offices were steward, butler, constable, and marshall. The  Treasurer was responsible for the collection and distribution of  revenue and was the keeper of the royal treasure at the palace at  Winchester. He was also an important member of the household"]]]
