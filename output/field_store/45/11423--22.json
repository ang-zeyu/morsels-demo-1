A beautiful collar of silver was made for him, and on it were engraved  the words,        A TOKEN OF GRATITUDE FROM THE NINETY-TWO PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES WERE      SAVED BY PRINCE JAN, WHEN ALL HOPE WAS LOST.    With this collar was a purse of money sufficient to pay Jan's passage  home, and a nice sum left over to give to the monks who cared for the  dogs at the Hospice.    But the biggest surprise of all came when Captain Smith found that he,  too, was to make the trip to the Hospice with the doctor and Prince Jan.    The old man wrote a letter to his daughter, explaining everything and  saying he would come to her as soon as he and the doctor could get  back.    Jan did not know what all the excitement in the little home meant, but  every one patted him or spoke kindly, and the old captain's eyes were  shining all the time, as he trotted about the rooms, whistling.          Chapter XV    AN UNFORGOTTEN TRAIL      Once again Jan went on a big boat, but he did not worry this time,  because his friends were with him. Hippity-Hop and Cheepsie had been  left with the doctor's wife until the captain should return for them.    The voyage was followed by travelling in a train, and each day of the  whole journey the doctor and captain visited Jan. When he was on the  train, his friends took him out of the car a number of times, so he  could stretch his legs and run about on the ground while the train  waited at a station. It did not take Jan long to understand that if he  did not get back in the car he would be left behind. So he watched very  carefully and at the first call of the captain or the doctor, he ran  swiftly to the right car and jumped in it. Passengers on the long train  watched him do this, for he never mistook his own car though there were  several others just like the one in which he rode.    Jan wore his silver collar, and wherever he went men and women would  look at it, then pat his big head and praise him. He was very happy  though he did not know where he and his friends were going.    From the train they stopped at a little town, and early the next morning  Jan followed the doctor and the captain to a place where a funny little  cart waited them. A sleepy-looking mule was hitched to the cart, and a  driver stood at the mule's head. After some talk between the driver and  the doctor, the old captain climbed into the cart and the doctor trudged  beside it, while the muleteer, as the drivers of these little carts are  called, kept near the mule's head. At first Jan followed behind them  all, but in a short time he found that the road they were trudging  became more steep. Then he trotted ahead and led the way, but looked  back often to see that every one was all right.    The town where they had spent the night was perched on a high bluff  overlooking a noisy, scurrying little river that seemed in a great hurry  to get some place else. The road Jan now travelled climbed higher and  higher, but as he stopped and looked down he could see the river  gurgling and hurrying along. It was a queer little stream, and the  muleteer called it the Dranse. In places Jan could not see it at all,  and then when he thought it had gone in another direction, it popped  out, foaming and spluttering as though it thought Jan had been fooled.  Sometimes it appeared to be running backward, and then suddenly it  seemed to be racing forward, and always it kept playing its game of  hide-and-seek with them all, and laughing and dancing like a merry elf  or water-sprite. The river kept all of them interested until they  stopped at a little village, which the muleteer said was Cantine de  Proz.    Here they walked about, while the mule was unhitched and the little  wagon was left behind. The captain now climbed on the back of the mule,  and the doctor and muleteer walked on either side of him. The road had  changed to a narrow, slippery pathway, one side of which dropped down to  a deep chasm with a fringe of snow showing here and there.    In front of them loomed mountains, and as the path twisted sharply, Jan  stopped short and stared ahead. Far away rose a huge white mountain, and  around it grouped peaks of dazzling snow, the first snow Jan had seen  since he was a puppy.    The doctor and the old man were watching him, but Jan did not see them.  He was remembering things he had almost forgotten. Slowly the mule  climbed, and the twisting trail turned and wound higher and higher. Jan  lifted his head and sniffed the air that was growing colder. Then as  they turned where the path seemed to end, the dog gave a loud bark and  dashed ahead of them where something white lay on the ground. Faster and  faster his feet flew until he stood in this white patch. His nose  touched it and tossed it in little white clouds, he threw himself down  and rolled over and over, then jumped to his feet and barked in sharp,  excited tones. Again he snapped at it, and then he raced along the  trail, frisking like a puppy, while the doctor and the captain kept  smiling at each other and nodding their heads.    But not until a tiny cabin was reached, where they all went inside to  rest a short time, did Prince Jan recognize the little Rest House and  knew that the white trail winding up the mountain side would end at the  door of the Hospice.    So, when the old man was perched again on the mule and the travellers  started toward the high white peak, Jan did not wait longer, but raced  ahead of them, barking as he ran. Up, up, faster and faster, he ran. His  heart pounded, his tongue hung far out of his mouth, he plunged his nose  into the soft, cold drifts, sometimes stopping to take a big bite, then  with yelps of joy he darted on.    And high above the steep trail rose the sharp peaks that shadowed the  hundreds of deep gullies: places where the snow never melted, even in  summer. And Prince Jan knew that he was following once more the path  that his forefathers had trodden.    He stopped quickly and lifted his nose high, then he sent forth the  great cry of the St. Bernard dogs. The deep tones echoed from crag to  crag, until it sounded as if all the dogs that had ever trodden that  trail were answering him.    Another twist of the pathway showed the jagged tips of the highest  peaks, and just back of that crest rose the roof of the Hospice. Jan  stood still for a second before he sent again that call of his people.  Again he heard the voices answering, but this time the answer came from  the dogs in the kennel-yards.    Jan trembled with excitement, then he shot forward and did not stop  until he had reached the worn stone steps that he remembered so well.  The door was closed, but some instinct made him raise his head and give  the cry of the trail.    Slowly the big door swung open and Brother Antoine stood looking with  puzzled eyes at a St. Bernard dog that he did not know. But Jan had not  forgotten. He reared on his hind legs and let his front paws drop  lightly on the shoulders of the monk. Their eyes were level, and as the  dog looked at the monk, Brother Antoine called out, \"Why! It is  Jan--Prince Jan--come back to us!\"    \"Woof! Woof!\" Jan's voice brought other monks hastily to the door, where  Brother Antoine stood patting the big, strange dog that stood with  bright shining eyes, looking from one to the other, while his fluffy  tail bobbed and wagged furiously.    As they stood talking and wondering how he came there, the doctor and  the captain, with the muleteer, came in sight. So the mystery was fully  understood.    Inside the Hospice, the monks gathered around to listen to the story of  the adventures of Prince Jan since that time when he had been led down  the trail to a Land of No Snow. His silver collar was examined and  admired, and Jan knew they were all glad that he had come back home.    It was Brother Antoine, though, who said, \"Come with me, Prince Jan.\"    The big dog followed at once. Through the corridors of the Hospice, down  a few steps, he went swiftly to the basement, under high archways, and  through the open entrance that led into the kennel yard. And then, Jan  stood once more in the home of his ancestors, and saw again his own kin.    Panting with excitement, he ran among them all and looked eagerly  around. Many of the dogs were strangers to him, but when he saw old  Bruno limping slowly across to where he stood, Jan's yelp made the other  dogs start, and as he reached Bruno's side and showed that he had not  forgotten, Bruno's joy was just as plain. Two tawny streaks flashed up  to Jan, sniffed, and then yelped and yelped in wildest excitement; and  this time Jan's voice mingled with his mother's and Rollo's, while the  other dogs joined until the white mountains sent back the call of the  Hospice dogs.    Brother Antoine, smiling happily, patted Jan and left him with the other  dogs. But later in the day he returned and bade Jan follow. They went  into the Big Room where the captain and the doctor were talking with  several travellers and two more monks. They watched the dog move to the  side of the old man; then Brother Antoine unfastened the silver collar  from Jan's neck and hung it over the fireplace beside the big painting  of the St. Bernard dog rescuing a man from the snow.    \"It shall hang there so that all who come to the Hospice may see it and  hear the story of Prince Jan,\" said Brother Antoine.    Every one praised Jan, and he then went back to the kennel, where he was  quickly surrounded by the other dogs. It was a great day for the St.  Bernards, and they were very proud of Jan when he told them the story of  his adventures in the strange land where there was never any snow.

In the course of his speech General Smuts also said \"the Pass laws do  the Whites no good and are intolerable to the Natives.\" The Native  Affairs Act of 1920 provides for the establishment of a permanent Native  Affairs Commission, and for the Creation of local Native Councils or  conferences of Native Chiefs and other representatives for the  discussion of all questions affecting the interests of the Natives. In  explaining the nature and scope of this Act the Prime Minister said that  more study and investigation, and more consultation with the Natives  were required before it could be said that the areas suggested by the  Beaumont Commission were fair and proper.
