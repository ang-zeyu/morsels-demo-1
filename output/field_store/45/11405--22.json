[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14473"],[0,"Birds of Guernsey (1879) (#18)"],[1,"in the West of England, I may mention that it may be immediately  distinguished from the Rock Dove by the absence of the white rump, that  part being nearly the same colour as the back in the Stock Dove, and  from the Wood Pigeon, _Columba palumbus_, by its smaller size and the  entire absence of white on the wing. It is perhaps more necessary to  point out this difference, as the Stock Dove frequently goes by the name  of the Wood Pigeon; indeed Dresser has adopted this name for it, the  Wood Pigeon being called the Ring Dove, as is very frequently the case.      93. TURTLE DOVE. _Turtur vulgaris_, Eyton. French, \"Colombe  tourterelle.\"--The Turtle Dove is a regular, but probably never very  numerous summer visitant, arriving and departing about the same time as  in England. Neither Miss Carey nor Mr. Couch ever mention it in their  notes on Guernsey birds in the 'Zoologist': and Mr. MacCulloch, writing  to me about the bird, does not go farther than to say \"The Turtle Dove  has, I believe, been known to breed here.\" In June, 1866, however, I  shot one in very wild weather, flying across the bay at Vazon Bay; so  wild was the weather with drifting fog and rain that I did not know what  I had till I picked it up; in fact, when I shot it I thought it was some  wader, flying through the fog towards me. This summer (1878) I saw two  at Mr. Jago's which had been shot at Herm in May, just before I came;  and in June I saw one or two more about in Guernsey. The pair shot in  Herm would probably have bred in that island if they had been left  unmolested.    Professor Ansted mentions it in his list, but only as occurring in  Guernsey, and there is one specimen in the Museum.      94. QUAIL. _Coturnix communis_, Bonnaterre. French, \"Caille.\"--I have  never seen the Quail in the Islands myself, and it cannot be considered  more than an occasional straggler; there can be no doubt, however, that  it sometimes remains to breed, as there are some eggs in the Museum  which I have reason to believe are Guernsey taken, and Mr. MacCulloch  writes me word that \"Quails certainly visit us occasionally, and I  remember having seen their eggs in my youth\"; and Mrs. Jago (late Miss  Cumber), who was herself a bird-stuffer in Guernsey a good many years  ago, told me she had had two Quails through her hands during the time  she had been stuffing; but evidently she had not had very many, nor did  she think them very common, as she did not know what they were when they  were brought to her, and she was some time before she found anyone to  tell her. The Quail breeds occasionally, too, in Alderney, as the  bird-stuffer and carpenter had some Quail's and Landrail's eggs; these  he told me he had taken out of the same nest which he supposed belonged  originally to the Landrail, as there were rather more Landrail's than  Quail's eggs in it.    Professor Ansted includes the Quail in his list, but marks it as  occurring only in Guernsey. There is a specimen in the Museum, and, as I  said before, several eggs.      95. WATER RAIL. _Rallus aquations_, Linnaeus. French, \"Rale d'eau.\"--The  Water Rail is not very common in Guernsey, but a few occur about the  Braye Pond, and in other places suited to them; and, I believe,  occasionally remain to breed, as Mr. Jago, the bird-stuffer, told me he  had seen a pair of Water Rails and four young, his dog having started  them from a hedge near the Rousailleries farm; the young could scarcely  fly. I saw one at the bird-stuffer's at Alderney, which had been shot in  that Island; and the bird-stuffer told me they were common, and he  believed they bred there, but he had no eggs. Their number, however, is,  I think, rather increased in the autumn by migrants; at all events, more  specimens are brought to the bird-stuffers at that time of year. I have  before mentioned the incident of the Water Rail being killed by the  Merlin, recorded by Mr. Couch in the 'Zoologist' for 1875.    The Water Rail is included in Professor Ansted's list, and marked as  occurring in Guernsey and Sark. There are two specimens in the Museum.      96. SPOTTED CRAKE. _Porzana maruetta_, Leach. French, \"Poule d'eau  marouette.\"--I have some doubt as to the propriety of including the  Spotted Crake in my list, but, on the whole, such evidence as I have  been able to collect seems in favour of its being at all events  occasionally seen and shot, though its small size and shy skulking  habits keep it very much from general notice. Mr. MacCulloch, however,  writes to me to say the Spotted Rail has been found here; and one of Mr.  De Putron's labourers described a Rail to me which he had shot in the  Vale Pond in May, 1877, which, from his description, could have been  nothing but a Spotted Rail.    This is all the information I have been able to glean, but Professor  Ansted includes it in his list, and marks it as occurring in Guernsey.  There are also two pretty good specimens in the Museum, which I have no  doubt were killed in Guernsey.      97. LANDRAIL. _Crex pratensis_, Bechstein. French, \"Rale des pres,\"  \"Rale de terre\" ou \"de Genet,\" \"Poule d'eau de genet.\"--The Landrail is  a common summer visitant, breeding certainly in Guernsey, Sark, and  Alderney,[16] and probably in Herm, though I cannot be quite so sure  about the latter Island. It seems to be rather more numerous in some  years than others, as occasionally I have heard them craking in almost  every field. But the last summer I was in the Islands (1878) I heard  very few. The Corn Crake arrives and departs much about the same time as  in England, and I have never been able to find that any stay on into the  winter, or even as late as November.    It is included in Professor Ansted's list, but only marked as occurring  in Guernsey and Sark. There are two specimens in the Museum.      98. MOORHEN. _Gallinula chloropus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Poule d'eau  ordinaire.\"--I have not seen the Moorhen myself in Guernsey, but Mr.  Couch, writing to me in December, 1876, told me that Mr. De Putron  informed him that Coots, Waterhens, and Little Grebes bred that year in  the Braye Pond; and Mr. De Putron, to whom I wrote on the subject, said  the information I had received was perfectly correct. I see no reason to  doubt the fact of the Moorhen occasionally breeding in Mr. De Putron's  pond, and perhaps in other places in the Island, especially the Grand  Mare. But I do not believe they breed regularly in either place; they  certainly did not in this last summer (1878), or I must have seen or  heard them. As far as Mr. De Putron's pond is concerned, I could not  have helped hearing their loud call or alarm note had only one pair been  breeding there; I have, however, a young bird of the year, killed in  Guernsey in November, 1878.    Professor Ansted includes it in his list, and marks it as only occurring  in Guernsey. There are two specimens in the Museum, probably both  Guernsey killed.      99. COMMON COOT. _Fulica atra_, Linnaeus. French, \"Foulque,\" \"Foulque  macroule.\"--In spite of Mr. De Putron's statement that the Coot bred in  the Braye Pond in the summer of 1876, I can scarcely look upon it in the  light of anything but an occasional and never numerous autumnal  visitant; and its breeding in the Braye Pond that year must have been  quite exceptional. In the autumn it occurs both in the Braye Pond and on  the coast in the more sheltered parts. I have the skin of one killed in  the Braye Pond in November, 1876, which might have been one of those  bred there that year.    Professor Ansted includes the Coot in his list, but only marks it as  occurring in Guernsey. There is no specimen in the Museum.      100. LITTLE BUSTARD. _Otis tetrax_, Linnaeus. French, \"Outarde  canepetiere,\" \"Poule de Carthage.\"--The Little Bustard can only be  considered a very rare occasional visitant to the Channel Islands, and  very few instances of its occurrence have come under my notice. The  first was mentioned to me by Mr. MacCulloch, who wrote me word that a  Little Bustard was killed in Guernsey in 1865, but unfortunately he  gives no information as to the time of the year. Another was shot by a  farmer in Guernsey early in March, 1866, and was recorded by myself in  the 'Zoologist' for that year. Mr. Couch also recorded one in the  'Zoologist' for 1875, \"as having been shot at the back of St. Andrew's  (very near the place where one was shot fifteen years ago) on the 20th  of November, 1874.\" This bird is now in the possession of Mr. Le Mottee,  at whose house I saw it, and was informed that it had been shot at a  place called the Eperons, in the parish of St. Andrew's, on the date  above mentioned. These are all the instances of the occurrence of the  Little Bustard in the Channel Islands that I have been able to gain any  intelligence of, but they are sufficient to show that although by no  means a common visitant, it does occasionally occur on both spring and  autumn migration.    It is not included in Professor Ansted's list. There is, however, a  specimen in the Museum, which I was told, when I saw it in 1866, had  been killed the previous year, but there is no date of the month, and I  should think, from the state of plumage, it was an autumn-killed  specimen: it is still in the Museum, as I saw it there again this year,  1878. This is probably the bird mentioned by Mr. MacCulloch as killed in  1865, and also very likely the one spoken of by Mr. Couch, in 1875, as  having been killed in St. Andrew's fifteen years ago; but there seems to  have been some mistake as to Mr. Couch's date for this one, as, had it  been killed so long ago as 1860, it would in all probability have been  included in Professor Ansted's list, and mentioned by Mr. Gallienne in  his remarks on some of the birds included in the list.      101. THICK-KNEE. _Oedicnemus scolopax_, S.G. Gmelin. French, \"Oedicneme  criard,\" \"Poule d'Aurigny.\"[17]--The Thick-knee, Stone Curlew, or  Norfolk Plover, as it is called,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14474"],[0,"The Chemical History of a Candle (#18)"],[1," takes before the bad air which I throw into this part of the apparatus has  reached the candle. The candle at first goes on burning, but so soon as  the air has had time to reach it, it goes out. And, now, I will shew you  another experiment, because this is an important part of our philosophy.  Here is a jar which contains fresh air, as you can see by the circumstance  of a candle or gas-light burning it. I make it close for a little time,  and by means of a pipe I get my mouth over it so that I can inhale the  air. By putting it over water, in the way that you see, I am able to draw  up this air (supposing the cork to be quite tight), take it into my lungs,  and throw it back into the jar.    [Illustration: Fig. 33.]    We can then examine it, and see the result. You observe, I first take up  the air, and then throw it back, as is evident from the ascent and descent  of the water; and now, by putting a taper into the air, you will see the  state in which it is, by the light being extinguished. Even one  inspiration, you see, has completely spoiled this air, so that it is no  use my trying to breathe it a second time. Now, you understand the ground  of the impropriety of many of the arrangements among the houses of the  poorer classes, by which the air is breathed over and over again, for the  want of a supply, by means of proper ventilation, sufficient to produce a  good result. You see how bad the air becomes by a single breathing; so  that you can easily understand how essential fresh air is to us.    To pursue this a little further, let us see what will happen with  lime-water. Here is a globe which contains a little lime-water, and it is  so arranged as regards the pipes, as to give access to the air within, so  that we can ascertain the effect of respired or unrespired air upon it. Of  course, I can either draw in air (through A), and so make the air that  feeds my lungs go through the lime-water, or I can force the air out of my  lungs through the tube (B), which goes to the bottom, and so shew its  effect upon the lime-water.    [Illustration: Fig. 34.]    You will observe that, however long I draw the external air into the  lime-water, and then through it to my lungs, I shall produce no effect  upon the water--it will not make the lime-water turbid; but if I throw the  air _from_ my lungs through the lime-water, several times in succession,  you see how white and milky the water is getting, shewing the effect which  expired air has had upon it; and now you begin to know that the atmosphere  which we have spoiled by respiration is spoiled by carbonic acid, for you  see it here in contact with the lime-water.    I have here two bottles, one containing lime-water and the other common  water, and tubes which pass into the bottles and connect them. The  apparatus is very rough, but it is useful notwithstanding.    [Illustration: Fig. 35.]    If I take these two bottles, inhaling here and exhaling there, the  arrangement of the tubes will prevent the air going backwards. The air  coming in will go to my mouth and lungs, and in going out, will pass  through the lime-water, so that I can go on breathing and making an  experiment, very refined in its nature, and very good in its results. You  will observe that the good air has done nothing to the lime-water; in the  other case nothing has come to the lime-water but my respiration, and you  see the difference in the two cases.    Let us now go a little further. What is all this process going on within  us which we cannot do without, either day or night, which is so provided  for by the Author of all things that He has arranged that it shall be  independent of all will? If we restrain our respiration, as we can to a  certain extent, we should destroy ourselves. When we are asleep, the  organs of respiration, and the parts that are associated with them, still  go on with their action--so necessary is this process of respiration to  us, this contact of the air with the lungs. I must tell you, in the  briefest possible manner, what this process is. We consume food: the food  goes through that strange set of vessels and organs within us, and is  brought into various parts of the system, into the digestive parts  especially; and alternately the portion which is so changed is carried  through our lungs by one set of vessels, while the air that we inhale and  exhale is drawn into and thrown out of the lungs by another set of  vessels, so that the air and the food come close together, separated only  by an exceedingly thin surface: the air can thus act upon the blood by  this process, producing precisely the same results in kind as we have seen  in the case of the candle. The candle combines with parts of the air,  forming carbonic acid, and evolves heat; so in the lungs there is this  curious, wonderful change taking place. The air entering, combines with  the carbon (not carbon in a free state, but, as in this case, placed ready  for action at the moment), and makes carbonic acid, and is so thrown out  into the atmosphere, and thus this singular result takes place: we may  thus look upon the food as fuel. Let me take that piece of sugar, which  will serve my purpose. It is a compound of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,  similar to a candle, as containing the same elements, though not in the  same proportion--the proportions being as shewn in this table:--    SUGAR.    Carbon, . . . . 72                    _  Hydrogen, . . . 11 |                     | 99  Oxygen, . . . . 88_|    This is, indeed, a very curious thing, which you can well remember, for  the oxygen and hydrogen are in exactly the proportions which form water,  so that sugar may be said to be compounded of 72 parts of carbon and 99  parts of water; and it is the carbon in the sugar that combines with the  oxygen carried in by the air in the process of respiration--so making us  like candles--producing these actions, warmth, and far more wonderful  results besides, for the sustenance of the system, by a most beautiful and  simple process. To make this still more striking, I will take a little  sugar; or, to hasten the experiment, I will use some syrup, which contains  about three-fourths of sugar and a little water. If I put a little oil of  vitriol on it, it takes away the water, and leaves the carbon in a black  mass. [The Lecturer mixed the two together.] You see how the carbon is  coming out, and before long we shall have a solid mass of charcoal, all of  which has come out of sugar. Sugar, as you know, is food, and here we have  absolutely a solid lump of carbon where you would not have expected it.  And if I make arrangements so as to oxidize the carbon of sugar, we shall  have a much more striking result Here is sugar, and I have here an  oxidizer--a quicker one than the atmosphere; and so we shall oxidize this  fuel by a process different from respiration in its form, though not  different in its kind. It is the combustion of the carbon by the contact  of oxygen which the body has supplied to it. If I set this into action at  once, you will see combustion produced. Just what occurs in my  lungs--taking in oxygen from another source, namely, the atmosphere--takes  place here by a more rapid process.    You will be astonished when I tell you what this curious play of carbon  amounts to. A candle will burn some four, five, six, or seven hours. What,  then, must be the daily amount of carbon going up into the air in the way  of carbonic acid! What a quantity of carbon must go from each of us in  respiration! What a wonderful change of carbon must take place under these  circumstances of combustion or respiration! A man in twenty-four hours  converts as much as seven ounces of carbon into carbonic acid; a milch cow  will convert seventy ounces, and a horse seventy-nine ounces, solely by  the act of respiration. That is, the horse in twenty-four hours burns  seventy-nine ounces of charcoal, or carbon, in his organs of respiration,  to supply his natural warmth in that time. All the warm-blooded animals  get their warmth in this way, by the conversion of carbon, not in a free  state, but in a state of combination. And what an extraordinary notion  this gives us of the alterations going on in our atmosphere. As much as  5,000,000 pounds, or 548 tons, of carbonic acid is formed by respiration  in London alone in twenty-four hours. And where does all this go? Up into  the air. If the carbon had been like the lead which I shewed you, or the  iron which, in burning, produces a solid substance, what would happen?  Combustion could not go on. As charcoal burns, it becomes a vapour and  passes off into the atmosphere, which is the great vehicle, the great  carrier for conveying it away to other places. Then, what becomes of it?  Wonderful is it to find that the change produced by respiration, which  seems so injurious to us (for we cannot breathe air twice over), is the  very life and support of plants and vegetables that grow upon the surface  of the earth. It is the same also under the surface, in the great bodies  of water; for fishes and other animals respire upon the same principle,  though not exactly by contact with the open air.    Such fish as I have here [pointing to a globe of gold-fish] respire by the  oxygen which is dissolved from the air by the water, and form carbonic  acid; and they all move about to produce the one great work of making the  animal and vegetable kingdoms subservient to each other. And all the  plants growing upon the surface of the earth, like that which I have  brought here to serve as an illustration, absorb carbon. These leaves are  taking up their carbon from the atmosphere, to which we have given it in  the form of carbonic acid, and they are growing and prospering. Give them  a pure air like ours, and they could not live in it; give them carbon with  other matters, and they live and rejoice. This piece of wood gets all its  carbon, as the trees and plants get theirs, from"]]]
