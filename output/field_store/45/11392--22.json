If your brush is very  full it will not be influenced nearly so much. And if one wants a touch  that shall be distinct, as would be the case in painting the shiny light  on a glazed pot, a very full brush would be used. But generally  speaking, get your effects with as little paint as possible. Thinner  paint is easier to refine and manipulate. There will be no fear of its  not being solid if you are painting into a solidly scumbled middle tone.    Many charming things are to be done with a mixture of solid and  transparent paint, but it is well at first not to complicate the  problem too much, and therefore to leave this until later on, when you  are competent to attack problems of colour. Keep your early work both in  monochrome and colour #quite solid#, but as thin as you can, reserving  thicker paint for those occasions when you wish to put a touch that  shall not be influenced by what you are painting into.    [Illustration: Plate XXV.    ILLUSTRATING SOME TYPICAL BRUSH STROKES MADE WITH FOUR CLASSES OF BRUSH    Class A, round; Class B, flat; Class C, full flat brush with rounded  corners; Class D, filbert shape.]    It will perhaps be as well to illustrate a few of the different brush  strokes, and say something about the different qualities of each. These  are only given as typical examples of the innumerable ways a brush may  be used as an aid to very elementary students; every artist will, of  course, develop ways of his own.    The touch will of necessity depend in the first instance upon the shape  of the brush, and these shapes are innumerable. But there are two  classes into which they can roughly be divided, flat and round. The  round brushes usually sold, which we will call Class A, have rather a  sharp point, and this, although helpful in certain circumstances, is  against their general usefulness. But a round brush with a round point  is also made, and this is much more convenient for mass drawing. Where  there is a sharp point the central hairs are much longer, and  consequently when the brush is drawn along and pressed so that all the  hairs are touching the canvas, the pressure in the centre, where the  long hairs are situated, is different from that at the sides. This has  the effect of giving a touch that is not equal in quality all across,  and the variety thus given is difficult to manipulate. I should  therefore advise the student to try the blunt-ended round brushes first,  as they give a much more even touch, and one much more suited to  painting in planes of tone.    The most extreme flat brushes (Class B) are thin and rather short, with  sharp square ends, and have been very popular with students. They can be  relied upon to give a perfectly flat, even tone, but with a rather hard  sharp edge at the sides, and also at the commencement of the touch. In  fact, they make touches like little square bricks. But as the variety  that can be got out of them is limited, and the amount of paint they can  carry so small that only short strokes can be made, they are not the  best brush for general use. They are at times, when great refinement and  delicacy are wanted, very useful, but are, on the whole, poor tools for  the draughtsman in paint. Some variety can be got by using one or other  of their sharp corners, by which means the smallest possible touch can  be made to begin with, which can be increased in size as more pressure  is brought to bear, until the whole surface of the brush is brought into  play. They are also often used to paint across the form, a manner  illustrated in the second touch, columns 1 and 2 of the illustration on  page 114 [Transcribers Note: Plate XXVI].    A more useful brush (Class C) partakes of the qualities of both flat and  round. It is made with much more hair than the last, is longer, and has  a square top with rounded corners. This brush carries plenty of paint,  will lay an even tone, and, from the fact that the corners are rounded  and the pressure consequently lessened at the sides, does not leave so  hard an edge on either side of your stroke.    Another brush that has recently come into fashion is called a filbert  shape (Class D) by the makers. It is a fine brush to draw with, as being  flat it paints in planes, and having a rounded top is capable of  getting in and out of a variety of contours. They vary in shape, some  being more pointed than others. The blunt-ended form is the best for  general use. Either this class of brush or Class C are perhaps the best  for the exercises in mass drawing we have been describing. But Class A  should also be tried, and even Class B, to find out which suits the  particular individuality of the student.    On page 114 [Transcribers Note: Plate XXVI] a variety of touches have  been made in turn by these different shaped brushes.    In all the strokes illustrated it is assumed that the brush is  moderately full of paint of a consistency a little thinner than that  usually put up by colourmen. To thin it, mix a little turpentine and  linseed oil in equal parts with it; and get it into easy working  consistency before beginning your work, so as not to need any medium.    In the first column (No. 1), a touch firmly painted with an equal  pressure all along its course is given. This gives you a plane of tone  with firm edges the width of your brush, getting gradually darker or  lighter as your brush empties, according to the length of the stroke and  to whether you are painting into a lighter or darker ground.    In column No. 2 a drag touch is illustrated. This is a very useful one.  The brush is placed firmly on the canvas and then dragged from the point  lightly away, leaving a gradated tone. A great deal of the modelling in  round objects is to be expressed by this variety of handling. The danger  is that its use is apt to lead to a too dexterous manner of painting; a  dexterity more concerned with the clever manner in which a thing is  painted than with the truth expressed.    Column No. 3. This is a stroke lightly and quickly painted, where the  brush just grazes the surface of the canvas. The paint is put on in a  manner that is very brilliant, and at the same time of a soft quality.  If the brush is only moderately full, such touches will not have any  hard edges, but be of a light, feathery nature. It is a most useful  manner of putting on paint when freshness of colour is wanted, as it  prevents one tone being churned up with another and losing its purity.  And in the painting of hair, where the tones need to be kept very  separate, and at the same time not hard, it is very useful. But in  monochrome painting from the cast it is of very little service.    Another method of using a brush is hatching, the drawing of rows of  parallel lines in either equal or varying thicknesses. This method will  lighten or darken a tone in varying degree, according to whether the  lines are thick, thin, or gradated--somewhat in the same way that lines  of shading are drawn in line work. In cases where the correction of  intricate modelling is desired and where it would be very difficult to  alter a part accurately by a deft stroke of the brush, this method is  useful to employ. A dry brush can be drawn across the lines to unite  them with the rest of the work afterwards. This method of painting has  lately been much used by those artists who have attempted painting in  separate, pure colours, after the so-called manner of Claude Monet,  although so mechanical a method is seldom used by that master.    As your power of drawing increases (from the line drawing you have been  doing), casts of hands and heads should be attempted in the same manner  as has been described. Illustrations are given of exercises of this  description on pages 110 and 122. Unfortunately the photographs, which  were taken from the same study at different stages during the painting,  are not all alike, the first painting of the lights being too darkly  printed in some cases. But they show how much can be expressed with the  one tone, when variety is got by using the middle tone to paint into.  The two tones used are noted in the right-hand lower corner.    Try to train yourself to do these studies at one sitting. But if you  find you cannot manage this, use slower drying colours, say bone brown  and zinc white, which will keep wet until the next day.    When you begin studying from the life, proceed in the same way with  monochrome studies painted into a middle tone.    And what are you to do if you find, when you have finished, that it is  all wrong? I should advise you to let it dry, and then scumble a middle  tone right over the whole thing, as you did at first, which will show  the old work through, and you can then correct your drawing and proceed  to paint the lights and shadows as before. And if only a part of it is  wrong, when it is quite dry rub a little, poppy oil thinned with  turpentine over the work, as little as will serve to cover the surface.  If it is found difficult to get it to cover, breathe on the canvas, the  slightest moisture will help it to bite. When this is done, wipe it off  with the palm of your hand or an old piece of clean linen. Now paint a  middle tone right over the part you wish to retouch, being careful about  joining it up to the surrounding work, and proceed as before, drawing in  the light and shadow masses.    This form of drawing you will probably find more difficult at first. For  the reason already explained it seems natural to observe objects as  made up of outlines, not masses. The frame with cottons across it should  be used to flatten the appearance, as in making outline drawings. And  besides this a black glass should be used. This can easily be made by  getting a small piece of glass--a photographic negative will do--and  sticking some black paper on the back; turning it over the front to keep  the raw edges of the glass from cutting"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1429"],[0,"The Garden Party, and Other Stories (#18)"],[1," were seventeen! It's\"--and she gave a faint shudder--\"the  stupidity I loathe, and being stared at by old fat men. Beasts!\"    Hennie gave her a quick look and then peered out of the window.    We drew up before an immense palace of pink-and-white marble with  orange-trees outside the doors in gold-and-black tubs.    \"Would you care to go in?\" I suggested.    She hesitated, glanced, bit her lip, and resigned herself. \"Oh well,  there seems nowhere else,\" said she. \"Get out, Hennie.\"    I went first--to find the table, of course--she followed. But the worst  of it was having her little brother, who was only twelve, with us. That  was the last, final straw--having that child, trailing at her heels.    There was one table. It had pink carnations and pink plates with little  blue tea-napkins for sails.    \"Shall we sit here?\"    She put her hand wearily on the back of a white wicker chair.    \"We may as well. Why not?\" said she.    Hennie squeezed past her and wriggled on to a stool at the end. He felt  awfully out of it. She didn't even take her gloves off. She lowered her  eyes and drummed on the table. When a faint violin sounded she winced  and bit her lip again. Silence.    The waitress appeared. I hardly dared to ask her. \"Tea--coffee? China  tea--or iced tea with lemon?\"    Really she didn't mind. It was all the same to her. She didn't really  want anything. Hennie whispered, \"Chocolate!\"    But just as the waitress turned away she cried out carelessly, \"Oh, you  may as well bring me a chocolate, too.\"    While we waited she took out a little, gold powder-box with a mirror in  the lid, shook the poor little puff as though she loathed it, and dabbed  her lovely nose.    \"Hennie,\" she said, \"take those flowers away.\" She pointed with her puff  to the carnations, and I heard her murmur, \"I can't bear flowers on  a table.\" They had evidently been giving her intense pain, for she  positively closed her eyes as I moved them away.    The waitress came back with the chocolate and the tea. She put the  big, frothing cups before them and pushed across my clear glass. Hennie  buried his nose, emerged, with, for one dreadful moment, a little  trembling blob of cream on the tip. But he hastily wiped it off like a  little gentleman. I wondered if I should dare draw her attention to  her cup. She didn't notice it--didn't see it--until suddenly, quite by  chance, she took a sip. I watched anxiously; she faintly shuddered.    \"Dreadfully sweet!\" said she.    A tiny boy with a head like a raisin and a chocolate body came  round with a tray of pastries--row upon row of little freaks, little  inspirations, little melting dreams. He offered them to her. \"Oh, I'm  not at all hungry. Take them away.\"    He offered them to Hennie. Hennie gave me a swift look--it must have  been satisfactory--for he took a chocolate cream, a coffee eclair,  a meringue stuffed with chestnut and a tiny horn filled with fresh  strawberries. She could hardly bear to watch him. But just as the boy  swerved away she held up her plate.    \"Oh well, give me one,\" said she.    The silver tongs dropped one, two, three--and a cherry tartlet. \"I don't  know why you're giving me all these,\" she said, and nearly smiled. \"I  shan't eat them; I couldn't!\"    I felt much more comfortable. I sipped my tea, leaned back, and even  asked if I might smoke. At that she paused, the fork in her hand, opened  her eyes, and really did smile. \"Of course,\" said she. \"I always expect  people to.\"    But at that moment a tragedy happened to Hennie. He speared his pastry  horn too hard, and it flew in two, and one half spilled on the table.  Ghastly affair! He turned crimson. Even his ears flared, and one ashamed  hand crept across the table to take what was left of the body away.    \"You utter little beast!\" said she.    Good heavens! I had to fly to the rescue. I cried hastily, \"Will you be  abroad long?\"    But she had already forgotten Hennie. I was forgotten, too. She was  trying to remember something... She was miles away.    \"I--don't--know,\" she said slowly, from that far place.    \"I suppose you prefer it to London. It's more--more--\"    When I didn't go on she came back and looked at me, very puzzled.  \"More--?\"    \"Enfin--gayer,\" I cried, waving my cigarette.    But that took a whole cake to consider. Even then, \"Oh well, that  depends!\" was all she could safely say.    Hennie had finished. He was still very warm.    I seized the butterfly list off the table. \"I say--what about an ice,  Hennie? What about tangerine and ginger? No, something cooler. What  about a fresh pineapple cream?\"    Hennie strongly approved. The waitress had her eye on us. The order was  taken when she looked up from her crumbs.    \"Did you say tangerine and ginger? I like ginger. You can bring me one.\"  And then quickly, \"I wish that orchestra wouldn't play things from  the year One. We were dancing to that all last Christmas. It's too  sickening!\"    But it was a charming air. Now that I noticed it, it warmed me.    \"I think this is rather a nice place, don't you, Hennie?\" I said.    Hennie said: \"Ripping!\" He meant to say it very low, but it came out  very high in a kind of squeak.    Nice? This place? Nice? For the first time she stared about her, trying  to see what there was... She blinked; her lovely eyes wondered. A very  good-looking elderly man stared back at her through a monocle on a black  ribbon. But him she simply couldn't see. There was a hole in the air  where he was. She looked through and through him.    Finally the little flat spoons lay still on the glass plates. Hennie  looked rather exhausted, but she pulled on her white gloves again. She  had some trouble with her diamond wrist-watch; it got in her way. She  tugged at it--tried to break the stupid little thing--it wouldn't break.  Finally, she had to drag her glove over. I saw, after that, she couldn't  stand this place a moment longer, and, indeed, she jumped up and turned  away while I went through the vulgar act of paying for the tea.    And then we were outside again. It had grown dusky. The sky was  sprinkled with small stars; the big lamps glowed. While we waited for  the car to come up she stood on the step, just as before, twiddling her  foot, looking down.    Hennie bounded forward to open the door and she got in and sank back  with--oh--such a sigh!    \"Tell him,\" she gasped, \"to drive as fast as he can.\"    Hennie grinned at his friend the chauffeur. \"Allie veet!\" said he. Then  he composed himself and sat on the small seat facing us.    The gold powder-box came out again. Again the poor little puff was  shaken; again there was that swift, deadly-secret glance between her and  the mirror.    We tore through the black-and-gold town like a pair of scissors tearing  through brocade. Hennie had great difficulty not to look as though he  were hanging on to something.    And when we reached the Casino, of course Mrs. Raddick wasn't there.  There wasn't a sign of her on the steps--not a sign.    \"Will you stay in the car while I go and look?\"    But no--she wouldn't do that. Good heavens, no! Hennie could stay. She  couldn't bear sitting in a car. She'd wait on the steps.    \"But I scarcely like to leave you,\" I murmured. \"I'd very much rather  not leave you here.\"    At that she threw back her coat; she turned and faced me; her lips  parted. \"Good heavens--why! I--I don't mind it a bit. I--I like  waiting.\" And suddenly her cheeks crimsoned, her eyes grew dark--for  a moment I thought she was going to cry. \"L--let me, please,\" she  stammered, in a warm, eager voice. \"I like it. I love waiting!  Really--really I do! I'm always waiting--in all kinds of places... \"    Her dark coat fell open, and her white throat--all her soft young body  in the blue dress--was like a flower that is just emerging from its dark  bud.          6. LIFE OF MA PARKER.    When the literary gentleman, whose flat old Ma Parker cleaned every  Tuesday, opened the door to her that morning, he asked after her  grandson. Ma Parker stood on the doormat inside the dark little hall,  and she stretched out her hand to help her gentleman shut the door  before she replied. \"We buried 'im yesterday, sir,\" she said quietly.    \"Oh, dear me! I'm sorry to hear that,\" said the literary gentleman in  a shocked tone. He was in the middle of his breakfast. He wore a very  shabby dressing-gown and carried a crumpled newspaper in one hand.  But he felt awkward. He could hardly go back to the warm sitting-room  without saying something--something more. Then because these people set  such store by funerals he said kindly, \"I hope the funeral went off all  right.\"    \"Beg parding, sir?\" said old Ma Parker huskily.    Poor old bird! She did look dashed. \"I hope the funeral was  a--a--success,\" said he. Ma Parker gave no answer. She bent her head  and hobbled off to the kitchen, clasping the old fish bag that held  her cleaning things and an apron and a pair of felt shoes. The literary  gentleman raised his eyebrows and went back to his breakfast.    \"Overcome, I suppose,\" he said aloud, helping himself to the marmalade.    Ma Parker drew the two jetty spears out of her toque and hung it behind  the door. She unhooked her worn jacket and hung that up too. Then she  tied her apron and sat down to take off her boots. To take off her boots  or to put them on was an agony to her, but it had been an agony for  years. In fact, she was so accustomed to the pain that her face was  drawn and screwed up ready for the twinge before she'd so much as untied  the laces. That over, she sat back with a sigh and softly rubbed her  knees...    \"Gran! Gran!\" Her little grandson stood on her lap in his button boots.  He'd just come in from playing in the street.    \"Look what a state you've made your gran's skirt into--you wicked boy!\"    But he put his arms round her neck and rubbed his cheek against hers.    \"Gran, gi' us a penny!\" he coaxed.    \"Be off with you; Gran ain't got no"]]]
