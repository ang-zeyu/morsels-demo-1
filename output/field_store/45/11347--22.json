Under other circumstances  he was now among these people again. The famine which prevailed at the  time of his arrival gave him the necessary opportunity to gain their  affections by first satisfying their material needs. He showed the  starving folk how to catch fish with nets which he and his companions  had made, and then was able to teach them other things. He preached  with success for some time, and baptized many who heard him. Bede has  left a record characteristic of his day, in which he relates that  immediately they had accepted the faith which he taught, \"the rain, so  long withheld, revisited the thirsty land.\"    Aethelwealh, grateful for Wilfrith's aid, granted him lands at Selsea.  The bishop at once gave freedom to those families and their slaves who  occupied the district, and baptized them, giving them release, as Bede  has told, from spiritual and temporal bond's at the same time. Selsea  thus became another see from which Christian principle and practice  might be taught in the midst of the surrounding tribes. In this spot,  near the residence of the king, a church was built, in which the  bishop's cathedra was placed. The structure was dedicated to S. Peter,  and was the first cathedral church in Sussex. It is not now known what  the architectural character of this building was. Perhaps there was  some attempt in its design to take advantage of such suggestions as  the Romans left behind them at Regnum, for we find in early instances  of English architecture that such examples had exercised some  influence upon the elementary efforts of those days. But it is more  likely that his first church was nothing but a small and simple barn,  for men were not then burdened with the idea that a cathedral must be  a big church, provided it served as a centre from which the bishop  could use his pastoral responsibility. During Wilfrith's stay at  Selsea many changes took place.    Then Ceadwalla, who had defeated Aedilwalch, or Aethelwealh, confirmed  the grants to the Church made by his predecessor, in return for the  kindness he had received from Wilfrith some time before.    Under their new head the missionaries at Selsea undertook, with the  king's sanction, to convert those who inhabited the neighbouring  island of Wight and also parts of the mainland which now were subject  to the new ruler. But after five years in the south Wilfrith returned  to his old diocese of York. Sussex, to a large extent, had accepted  the faith he endeavoured to teach, and many churches were established  and organised before his departure.    [Illustrations: OUR LORD WITH MARTHA AND MARY. THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.  SCULPTURED PANELS IN THE SOUTH CHOIR AISLE, SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN  BROUGHT FROM THE CATHEDRAL AT SELSEA (SEE P. 96).]    For some years after Wilfrith had returned to York there was no bishop  in charge of the newly founded diocese in Sussex. The community of  workers he had brought together at Selsea still continued to exist;  but Sussex in ecclesiastical affairs was subject to Winchester during  this interval. Ceadwalla, when Kentwine, King of Wessex, died in 685,  had begun \"to strive for the kingdom,\" so the chronicle has recorded,  and having established himself upon the throne, he succeeded also in  conquering the ruler of Sussex, and so brought both kingdoms under his  sway. Wilfrith had converted him to the Christian faith; but when this  prelate was recalled to his former diocese, no one had been appointed  to carry on the work he had begun. For twenty years this vacancy  continued. Then, after the death of Ceadwalla, Ine, his successor,  divided the large diocese, which was subject to the Bishop of  Winchester, by making, with the consent of his witan, a new see at  Sherburne and reviving that of Selsea. Of this latter, #Eadberht#  was appointed the first bishop in the year 709. The community in  Selsea over which Eadberht had presided before his consecration was a  secular foundation. Whatever was the principle upon which it had been  founded, there seems no doubt that during the interim which elapsed  before a bishop was placed in charge some elementary form of  government was carried on by a succession of elected presidents. This  body was either composed of secular clergy, who were distributed  throughout the diocese, living as priests in charge of parishes _in  saeculo_, or it was a foundation supported by those who lived according  to a _regula_. The regulars were those who lived together, having  vowed obedience to some particular form of rule. These were unmarried  men, who used one building, property, refectory, and dormitory of the  institution in common. Not all of these were ordained, as there were  among them lay brothers as well as those who were priests. But the  seculars--those in the world--were not subject to rules and conditions  such as these. Many, as priests living in their parishes, were married  men.    After the consecration of Eadberht and his installation as Bishop of  Selsea, the cathedra, or episcopal chair, was occupied successively by  twenty prelates. The period during which these held office, including  the few intervals when for a time the see remained vacant, extended  over about three hundred and seventy years. Little is known of these  bishops further than that their signatures are to be found attached to  various charters. These were all called Bishops of the South Saxons.    #Aethelgar# was Bishop of Selsea in 980. He had been a member of  the monastic colony at Glastonbury, near Wells. After occupying the  see for about eight years, he succeeded Dunstan as Archbishop of  Canterbury.    Bishops #Ordberht# and #Aelmer# were bishops after Aethelgar;  and then the next prelate of importance was #Aethelric#, who was a  Benedictine of Christ Church, Canterbury. He was learned in the  ancient laws and customs of his country, and when a very old man acted  as one of the arbitrators appointed to settle the differences which  had arisen between Lanfranc and Odo, Earl of Kent. Aethelric had been  consecrated by Stigand, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was removed from  the Primacy by William the Conqueror to make room for Lanfranc, his  own nominee.    The see of Selsea was governed by three other bishops till William  appointed one of his chaplains to the office. This was #Stigand#  (1070-1087), but not that Stigand (the Primate) who at the same royal  bidding had to make room for Lanfranc. It was while he was still an  occupant of the see that the transfer to Chichester was effected. He  earned the displeasure of the king by refusing to consecrate Gausbert  to the Abbey of Battle unless the monk would come to Chichester for  the ceremony. He had some trouble, too, with his metropolitan,  Lanfranc, on account of a dispute concerning the limits of his  jurisdiction. Certain parishes within the territory of his diocese  were claimed as subject to the more eastern see. The Primate  established his right to these \"peculiars,\" and the right obtained  until the last century, when all such holdings were abolished by law.    #Godfrey# (1087-1088) evidently incurred the displeasure of his  papal superior, as the only known record of his very brief episcopate  is represented by a discovery which was made in 1830 when an  absolution from the Pope, inscribed upon a leaden cross, was dug up in  the paradise close to the south choir aisle.    It was not till three years had elapsed since Godfrey's death that  #Ralph de Luffa# (1091-1123) was consecrated to the vacancy by  Thomas, Archbishop of York. Meanwhile the king enjoyed the  temporalities of the see. In his person we meet a figure of much  importance to the history of the fabric and see, for to his energy and  initiative we owe the greater part of the cathedral building that  remains to-day.    Ralph's activity was not wholly absorbed by his interest in the  architectural idea which he hoped to realise. He spent much time and  care attending to the needs of the churches of which he was the  overseer. He visited them regularly three times in the year for the  purpose of effecting reforms when they were necessary, for teaching,  and for developing the organisation of the diocese as it was affected  by the condition of each parochial unit. Thus by his office and  oversight he was endeavouring to maintain the necessary relations  between the particular churches and their cathedral centre. In defence  of these same members of the local and general ecclesiastical body he  was obliged to resent the attempted interference of two kings of the  realm. Henry I. wished to fill his pockets by imposing fines upon the  clergy. To oppose this the bishop closed all the churches in the  diocese and blocked up the entrances with thorns; and so, except in  the monasteries, the offering of public worship ceased. The  restriction was in time removed, and the king acknowledged the  bishop's plea that he should endeavour to replenish the coffers of his  poor see, so that the injured cathedral might be repaired, rather than  reduce it to poverty by extortion.    Ralph is credited with having established the office of \"dean\" [31] at  Chichester--the first of the four cathedral dignitaries, of which the  others are the praecentor, the chancellor, and the treasurer.      [31] Stephens, p. 49.    #Seffrid Pelochin#, or #d'Escures# (1125-1147), ceded to the  king's aggression the rights and privileges Ralph had gained. He was  obliged to vacate the see in 1145, [an]d returned to Glastonbury,  where he had been abbot before he was made bishop. His name figures in  the list which Roger of Hoveden gives in his chronicle, as one among  the bishops who were at the Council of London in 1129.    #Hilary# (1147-1169) was a bishop who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13334"],[0,"The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce — Volume 2: In the Midst of Life: Tales of (#18)"],[1,"were at a disadvantage in that most of them  lacked bayonets; they fought by bludgeoning--and a clubbed rifle is a  formidable arm. The sound of the conflict was a clatter like that of the  interlocking horns of battling bulls--now and then the pash of a crushed  skull, an oath, or a grunt caused by the impact of a rifle's muzzle  against the abdomen transfixed by its bayonet. Through an opening made  by the fall of one of his men Captain Armisted sprang, with his dangling  left arm; in his right hand a full-charged revolver, which he fired with  rapidity and terrible effect into the thick of the gray crowd: but  across the bodies of the slain the survivors in the front were pushed  forward by their comrades in the rear till again they breasted the  tireless bayonets. There were fewer bayonets now to breast--a beggarly  half-dozen, all told. A few minutes more of this rough work--a little  fighting back to back--and all would be over.    Suddenly a lively firing was heard on the right and the left: a fresh  line of Federal skirmishers came forward at a run, driving before them  those parts of the Confederate line that had been separated by staying  the advance of the centre. And behind these new and noisy combatants, at  a distance of two or three hundred yards, could be seen, indistinct  among the trees a line-of-battle!    Instinctively before retiring, the crowd in gray made a tremendous rush  upon its handful of antagonists, overwhelming them by mere momentum and,  unable to use weapons in the crush, trampled them, stamped savagely on  their limbs, their bodies, their necks, their faces; then retiring with  bloody feet across its own dead it joined the general rout and the  incident was at an end.    IV    THE GREAT HONOR THE GREAT    The Governor, who had been unconscious, opened his eyes and stared about  him, slowly recalling the day's events. A man in the uniform of a major  was kneeling beside him; he was a surgeon. Grouped about were the  civilian members of the Governor's staff, their faces expressing a  natural solicitude regarding their offices. A little apart stood General  Masterson addressing another officer and gesticulating with a cigar. He  was saying: \"It was the beautifulest fight ever made--by God, sir, it  was great!\"    The beauty and greatness were attested by a row of dead, trimly  disposed, and another of wounded, less formally placed, restless,  half-naked, but bravely bebandaged.    \"How do you feel, sir?\" said the surgeon. \"I find no wound.\"    \"I think I am all right,\" the patient replied, sitting up. \"It is that  ankle.\"    The surgeon transferred his attention to the ankle, cutting away the  boot. All eyes followed the knife.    In moving the leg a folded paper was uncovered. The patient picked it up  and carelessly opened it. It was a letter three months old, signed  \"Julia.\" Catching sight of his name in it he read it. It was nothing  very remarkable--merely a weak woman's confession of unprofitable sin--  the penitence of a faithless wife deserted by her betrayer. The letter  had fallen from the pocket of Captain Armisted; the reader quietly  transferred it to his own.    An aide-de-camp rode up and dismounted. Advancing to the Governor he  saluted.    \"Sir,\" he said, \"I am sorry to find you wounded--the Commanding General  has not been informed. He presents his compliments and I am directed to  say that he has ordered for to-morrow a grand review of the reserve  corps in your honor. I venture to add that the General's carriage is at  your service if you are able to attend.\"    \"Be pleased to say to the Commanding General that I am deeply touched by  his kindness. If you have the patience to wait a few moments you shall  convey a more definite reply.\"    He smiled brightly and glancing at the surgeon and his assistants added:  \"At present--if you will permit an allusion to the horrors of peace--I  am 'in the hands of my friends.'\"    The humor of the great is infectious; all laughed who heard.    \"Where is Captain Armisted?\" the Governor asked, not altogether  carelessly.    The surgeon looked up from his work, pointing silently to the nearest  body in the row of dead, the features discreetly covered with a  handkerchief. It was so near that the great man could have laid his hand  upon it, but he did not. He may have feared that it would bleed.          THE STORY OF A CONSCIENCE    I    Captain Parrol Hartroy stood at the advanced post of his picket-guard,  talking in low tones with the sentinel. This post was on a turnpike  which bisected the captain's camp, a half-mile in rear, though the camp  was not in sight from that point. The officer was apparently giving the  soldier certain instructions--was perhaps merely inquiring if all were  quiet in front. As the two stood talking a man approached them from the  direction of the camp, carelessly whistling, and was promptly halted by  the soldier. He was evidently a civilian--a tall person, coarsely clad  in the home-made stuff of yellow gray, called \"butternut,\" which was  men's only wear in the latter days of the Confederacy. On his head was a  slouch felt hat, once white, from beneath which hung masses of uneven  hair, seemingly unacquainted with either scissors or comb. The man's  face was rather striking; a broad forehead, high nose, and thin cheeks,  the mouth invisible in the full dark beard, which seemed as neglected as  the hair. The eyes were large and had that steadiness and fixity of  attention which so frequently mark a considering intelligence and a will  not easily turned from its purpose--so say those physiognomists who have  that kind of eyes. On the whole, this was a man whom one would be likely  to observe and be observed by. He carried a walking-stick freshly cut  from the forest and his ailing cowskin boots were white with dust.    \"Show your pass,\" said the Federal soldier, a trifle more imperiously  perhaps than he would have thought necessary if he had not been under  the eye of his commander, who with folded arms looked on from the  roadside.    \"'Lowed you'd rec'lect me, Gineral,\" said the wayfarer tranquilly, while  producing the paper from the pocket of his coat. There was something in  his tone--perhaps a faint suggestion of irony--which made his elevation  of his obstructor to exalted rank less agreeable to that worthy warrior  than promotion is commonly found to be. \"You-all have to be purty  pertickler, I reckon,\" he added, in a more conciliatory tone, as if in  half-apology for being halted.    Having read the pass, with his rifle resting on the ground, the soldier  handed the document back without a word, shouldered his weapon, and  returned to his commander. The civilian passed on in the middle of the  road, and when he had penetrated the circumjacent Confederacy a few  yards resumed his whistling and was soon out of sight beyond an angle in  the road, which at that point entered a thin forest. Suddenly the  officer undid his arms from his breast, drew a revolver from his belt  and sprang forward at a run in the same direction, leaving his sentinel  in gaping astonishment at his post. After making to the various visible  forms of nature a solemn promise to be damned, that gentleman resumed  the air of stolidity which is supposed to be appropriate to a state of  alert military attention.    II    Captain Hartroy held an independent command. His force consisted of a  company of infantry, a squadron of cavalry, and a section of artillery,  detached from the army to which they belonged, to defend an important  defile in the Cumberland Mountains in Tennessee. It was a field  officer's command held by a line officer promoted from the ranks, where  he had quietly served until \"discovered.\" His post was one of  exceptional peril; its defense entailed a heavy responsibility and he  had wisely been given corresponding discretionary powers, all the more  necessary because of his distance from the main army, the precarious  nature of his communications and the lawless character of the enemy's  irregular troops infesting that region. He had strongly fortified his  little camp, which embraced a village of a half-dozen dwellings and a  country store, and had collected a considerable quantity of supplies. To  a few resident civilians of known loyalty, with whom it was desirable to  trade, and of whose services in various ways he sometimes availed  himself, he had given written passes admitting them within his lines. It  is easy to understand that an abuse of this privilege in the interest of  the enemy might entail serious consequences. Captain Hartroy had made an  order to the effect that any one so abusing it would be summarily shot.    While the sentinel had been examining the civilian's pass the captain  had eyed the latter narrowly. He thought his appearance familiar and had  at first no doubt of having given him the pass which had satisfied the  sentinel. It was not until the man had got out of sight and hearing that  his identity was disclosed by a revealing light from memory. With  soldierly promptness of decision the officer had acted on the  revelation.    III    To any but a singularly self-possessed man the apparition of an officer  of the military forces, formidably clad, bearing in one hand a sheathed  sword and in the other a cocked revolver, and rushing in furious  pursuit, is no doubt disquieting to a high degree; upon the man to whom  the pursuit was in this instance directed it appeared to have no other  effect than somewhat to intensify his tranquillity. He might easily  enough have escaped into the forest to the right or the left, but chose  another course of action--turned and quietly faced the captain, saying  as he came up: \"I reckon ye must have something to say to me, which ye  disremembered. What mout it be, neighbor?\"    But the \"neighbor\" did not answer, being engaged in the unneighborly act  of covering him with a cocked pistol.    \"Surrender,\" said the captain as calmly"]]]
