Our soundings at first were 7 fathom, which held so a great while,  but at length it decreased to 6. Then we saw the land right ahead that in  the plan makes the east of the bay. We could not come near it with the  ship, having but shoal water; and it being dangerous lying there, and the  land extraordinary low, very unlikely to have fresh water (though it had  a few trees on it, seemingly mangroves) and much of it probably covered  at high-water, I stood out again that afternoon, deepening the water, and  before night anchored in 8 fathom, clean white sand, about the middle of  the bay. The next day we got up our anchor; and that afternoon came to an  anchor once more near 2 islands and a shoal of coral rocks that face the  bay. Here I scrubbed my ship; and, finding it very improbable I should  get anything further here, I made the best of my way out to sea again,  sounding all the way: but, finding by the shallowness of the water that  there was no going out to sea to the east of the two islands that face  the bay, nor between them, I returned to the west entrance, going out by  the same way I came in at, only on the east instead of the west side of  the small shoal to be seen in the plan; in which channel we had 10, 12,  and 13 fathom water, still deepening upon us till we were out at sea. The  day before we came out I sent a boat ashore to the most northerly of the  2 islands, which is the least of them, catching many small fish in the  meanwhile with hook and line. The boat's crew returning told me that the  isle produces nothing but a sort of green, short, hard, prickly grass,  affording neither wood nor fresh water; and that a sea broke between the  2 islands, a sign that the water was shallow. They saw a large turtle and  many skates and thornbacks, but caught none.    THE AUTHOR'S REMOVING TO ANOTHER PART OF NEW HOLLAND: DOLPHINS, WHALES,  AND MORE SEA-SERPENTS: AND OF A PASSAGE OR STRAIT SUSPECTED HERE: OF THE  VEGETABLES, BIRDS, AND FISH.    It was August the 14th when I sailed out of this bay or sound, the mouth  of which lies, as I said, in 25 degrees 5 minutes, designing to coast  along to the north-east till I might commodiously put in at some other  part of New Holland. In passing out we saw 3 water-serpents swimming  about in the sea, of a yellow colour, spotted with dark brown spots. They  were each about 4 foot long, and about the bigness of a man's wrist, and  were the first I saw on this coast, which abounds with several sorts of  them. We had the winds at our first coming out at north and the land  lying north-easterly. We plied off and on, getting forward but little  till the next day: when the wind coming at south-south-west and south we  began to coast it along the shore to the northward, keeping at 6 or 7  leagues off shore; and sounding often, we had between 40 and 46 fathom  water, brown sand with some white shells. This 15th of August we were in  latitude 24 degrees 41 minutes. On the 16th day at noon we were in 23  degrees 22 minutes. The wind coming at east by north we could not keep  the shore aboard, but were forced to go farther off, and lost sight of  the land. Then sounding we had no ground with 80 fathom line; however the  wind shortly after came about again to the southward, and then we jogged  on again to the northward and saw many small dolphins and whales, and  abundance of scuttle-shells swimming on the sea; and some water-snakes  every day. The 17th we saw the land again, and took a sight of it.    The 18th in the afternoon, being 3 or 4 leagues offshore, I saw a shoal  point, stretching from the land into the sea a league or more. The sea  broke high on it; by which I saw plainly there was a shoal there. I stood  farther off and coasted alongshore to about 7 or 8 leagues distance: and  at 12 o'clock at night we sounded, and had but 20 fathom hard sand. By  this I found I was upon another shoal, and so presently steered off west  half an hour, and had then 40 fathom. At one in the morning of the 18th  day we had 85 fathom: by two we could find no ground; and then I ventured  to steer alongshore again, due north, which is two points wide of the  coast (that lies north-north-east) for fear of another shoal. I would not  be too far off from the land, being desirous to search into it wherever I  should find an opening or any convenience of searching about for water,  etc. When we were off the shoal point I mentioned where we had but 20  fathom water, we had in the night abundance of whales about the ship,  some ahead, others astern, and some on each side blowing and making a  very dismal noise; but when we came out again into deeper water they left  us. Indeed the noise that they made by blowing and dashing of the sea  with their tails, making it all of a breach and foam, was very dreadful  to us, like the breach of the waves in very shoal water, or among rocks.  The shoal these whales were upon had depth of water sufficient, no less  than 20 fathom, as I said; and it lies in latitude 22 degrees 22 minutes.  The shore was generally bold all along; we had met with no shoal at sea  since the Abrolho Shoal, when we first fell on the New Holland coast in  the latitude of 28, till yesterday in the afternoon, and this night. This  morning also when we expected by the chart we had with us to have been 11  leagues offshore we were but 4; so that either our charts were faulty,  which yet hitherto and afterwards we found true enough as to the lying of  the coast, or else here was a tide unknown to us that deceived us; though  we had found very little of any tide on this coast hitherto. As to our  winds in the coasting thus far, as we had been within the verge of the  general trade (though interrupted by the storm I mentioned) from the  latitude of 28, when we first fell in with the coast: and by that time we  were in the latitude of 25 we had usually the regular tradewind (which is  here south-south-east) when we were at any distance from shore: but we  had often sea and land-breezes, especially when near shore, and when in  Shark's Bay; and had a particular north-west wind, or storm, that set us  in thither. On this 18th of August we coasted with a brisk gale of the  true tradewind at south-south-east, very fair and clear weather; but,  hauling off in the evening to sea, were next morning out of sight of  land; and the land now trending away north-easterly, and we being to the  northward of it, and the wind also shrinking from the south-south-east to  the east-south-east (that is, from the true tradewind to the seabreeze,  as the land now lay) we could not get in with the land again yet awhile,  so as to see it, though we trimmed sharp and kept close on a wind. We  were this 19th day in latitude 21 degrees 42 minutes. The 20th we were in  latitude 19 degrees 37 minutes and kept close on a wind to get sight of  the land again, but could not yet see it. We had very fair weather, and  though we were so far from the land as to be out of sight of it, yet we  had the sea and land-breezes. In the night we had the land-breeze at  south-south-east, a small gentle gale; which in the morning about  sunrising would shift about gradually (and withal increasing in strength)  till about noon we should have it at east-south-east, which is the true  sea breeze here. Then it would blow a brisk gale, so that we could scarce  carry our topsails double reefed: and it would continue thus till 3 in  the afternoon, when it would decrease again. The weather was fair all the  while, not a cloud to be seen; but very hazy, especially nigh the  horizon. We sounded several times this 20th day and at first had no  ground; but had afterwards from 52 to 45 fathom, coarse brown sand, mixed  with small brown and white stones, with dints besides in the tallow.    The 21st day also we had small land breezes in the night and seabreezes  in the day: and as we saw some seasnakes every day, so this day we saw a  great many, of two different sorts or shapes. One sort was yellow, and  about the bigness of a man's wrist, about 4 foot long, having a flat tail  about 4 fingers broad. The other sort was much smaller and shorter, round  and spotted black and yellow. This day we sounded several times, and had  45 fathom sand. We did not make the land till noon, and then saw it first  from our topmast-head. It bore south-east by east about 9 leagues  distance; and it appeared like a cape or head of land. The seabreeze this  day was not so strong as the day before, and it veered out more; so that  we had a fair wind to run in with to the shore, and at sunset anchored in  20 fathom, clean sand, about 5 leagues from the bluff point; which was  not a cape (as it appeared at a great distance) but the easternmost end  of an island, about 5 or 6 leagues in length and 1 in breadth. There were  3 or 4 rocky islands about a league from us between us and the bluff  point; and we saw many other islands both to the east and west of it, as  far as we could see either way from our topmast-head: and all within them  to the south there was nothing but islands of a pretty height, that may  be seen 8 or 9 leagues off. By what we saw of them they must have been a  range of islands of about 20 leagues in length, stretching from  east-north-east to west-south-west and, for ought I know, as far as to  those of Shark's Bay; and to a considerable breadth also (for we could  see 9 or 10 leagues in among them) towards the continent or mainland of  New Holland, if there be any such thing hereabouts: and, by the great  tides I met with a while afterwards, more to the north-east, I had a  strong suspicion that here might be a kind of archipelago of islands and  a passage possibly to the south of New Holland and New Guinea into the  great South Sea eastward; which I had thoughts also of attempting in my  return from New Guinea (had circumstances"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15697"],[0,"True Stories of History and Biography (#18)"],[1," the  third of July.    But, hark! what sound is this? The hurried clang of a bell! There is the  Old North, pealing suddenly out!--there, the Old South strikes in!--now, the  peal comes from the church in Brattle street!--the bells of nine or ten  steeples are all flinging their iron voices, at once, upon the morning  breeze! Is it joy or alarm? There goes the roar of a cannon, too! A royal  salute is thundered forth. And, now, we hear the loud exulting shout of a  multitude, assembled in the street. Huzza, Huzza! Louisbourg has  surrendered! Huzza!        \"O Grandfather, how glad I should have been to live in those times!\" cried  Charley. \"And what reward did the king give to General Pepperell and  Governor Shirley?\"    \"He made Pepperell a baronet; so that he was now to be called Sir William  Pepperell,\" replied Grandfather. \"He likewise appointed both Pepperell and  Shirley to be colonels in the royal army. These rewards, and higher ones,  were well deserved; for this was the greatest triumph that the English met  with, in the whole course of that war. General Pepperell became a man of  great fame. I have seen a full length portrait of him, representing him in  a splendid scarlet uniform, standing before the walls of Louisbourg, while  several bombs are falling through the air.\"    \"But, did the country gain any real good by the conquest of Louisbourg?\"  asked Laurence. \"Or was all the benefit reaped by Pepperell and Shirley?\"    \"The English Parliament,\" said Grandfather, \"agreed to pay the colonists  for all the expenses of the siege. Accordingly, in 1749, two hundred and  fifteen chests of Spanish dollars, and one hundred casks of copper coin,  were brought from England to Boston. The whole amount was about a million  of dollars. Twenty-seven carts and trucks carried this money from the  wharf to the provincial treasury. Was not this a pretty liberal reward?\"    \"The mothers of the young men, who were killed at the siege of Louisbourg,  would not have thought it so,\" said Laurence.    \"No, Laurence,\" rejoined Grandfather; \"and every warlike achievement  involves an amount of physical and moral evil, for which all the gold in  the Spanish mines would not be the slightest recompense. But, we are to  consider that this siege was one of the occasions, on which the colonists  tested their ability for war, and thus were prepared for the great contest  of the Revolution. In that point of view, the valor of our forefathers was  its own reward.\"    Grandfather went on to say, that the success of the expedition against  Louisbourg, induced Shirley and Pepperell to form a scheme for conquering  Canada. This plan, however, was not carried into execution.    In the year 1746, great terror was excited by the arrival of a formidable  French fleet upon the coast. It was commanded by the Duke d'Anville, and  consisted of forty ships of war, besides vessels with soldiers on board.  With this force, the French intended to retake Louisbourg, and afterwards  to ravage the whole of New England. Many people were ready to give up the  country for lost.    But the hostile fleet met with so many disasters and losses, by storm and  shipwreck, that the Duke d'Anville is said to have poisoned himself in  despair. The officer next in command threw himself upon his sword and  perished. Thus deprived of their commanders, the remainder of the ships  returned to France. This was as great a deliverance for New England, as  that which old England had experienced in the days of Queen Elizabeth,  when the Spanish Armada was wrecked upon her coast.    \"In 1747,\" proceeded Grandfather, \"Governor Shirley was driven from the  Province House, not by a hostile fleet and army, but by a mob of the  Boston people. They were so incensed at the conduct of the British  Commodore Knowles, who had impressed some of their fellow-citizens, that  several thousands of them surrounded the council-chamber, and threw stones  and brick-bats into the windows. The governor attempted to pacify them;  but, not succeeding, he thought it necessary to leave the town, and take  refuge within the walls of Castle William. Quiet was not restored, until  Commodore Knowles had sent back the impressed men. This affair was a flash  of spirit, that might have warned the English not to venture upon any  oppressive measures against their colonial brethren.\"    Peace being declared between France and England in 1748, the governor had  now an opportunity to sit at his ease in Grandfather's chair. Such repose,  however, appears not to have suited his disposition; for, in the following  year, he went to England, and thence was dispatched to France, on public  business. Meanwhile, as Shirley had not resigned his office,  Lieutenant-Governor Phips acted as chief magistrate in his stead.          Chapter IX      In the early twilight of Thanksgiving eve, came Laurence, and Clara, and  Charley, and little Alice, hand in hand, and stood in a semi-circle round  Grandfather's chair. They had been joyous, throughout that day of  festivity, mingling together in all kinds of play, so that the house had  echoed with their airy mirth.    Grandfather, too, had been happy, though not mirthful. He felt that this  was to be set down as one of the good Thanksgivings of his life. In truth,  all his former Thanksgivings had borne their part in the present one; for,  his years of infancy, and youth, and manhood with their blessings and  their griefs, had flitted before him, while he sat silently in the great  chair. Vanished scenes had been pictured in the air. The forms of departed  friends had visited him. Voices, to be heard no more on earth, had sent an  echo from the infinite and the eternal. These shadows, if such they were,  seemed almost as real to him, as what was actually present--as the merry  shouts and laughter of the children--as their figures, dancing like  sunshine before his eyes.    He felt that the past was not taken from him. The happiness of former days  was a possession forever. And there was something in the mingled sorrow of  his lifetime, that became akin to happiness, after being long treasured in  the depths of his heart. There it underwent a change, and grew more  precious than pure gold.    And now came the children, somewhat aweary with their wild play, and  sought the quiet enjoyment of Grandfather's talk. The good old gentleman  rubbed his eyes, and smiled round upon them all. He was glad, as most aged  people are, to find that he was yet of consequence, and could give  pleasure to the world. After being so merry, all day long, did these  children desire to hear his sober talk? Oh, then, old Grandfather had yet  a place to fill among living men,--or at least among boys and girls!    \"Begin quick, Grandfather,\" cried little Alice; \"for Pussy wants to hear  you.\"    And, truly, our yellow friend, the cat, lay upon the hearth rug, basking  in the warmth of the fire, pricking up her ears, and turning her head from  the children to Grandfather, and from Grandfather to the children, as if  she felt herself very sympathetic with them all. A loud purr, like the  singing of a tea-kettle, or the hum of a spinning-wheel, testified that  she was as comfortable and happy as a cat could be. For Puss had feasted,  and therefore, like Grandfather and the children, had kept a good  Thanksgiving.    \"Does Pussy want to hear me?\" said Grandfather, smiling. \"Well; we must  please Pussy, if we can!\"    And so he took up the history of the chair, from the epoch of the peace of  1748. By one of the provisions of the treaty, Louisbourg, which the New  Englanders had been at so much pains to take, was restored to the king of  France.    The French were afraid, that, unless their colonies should be better  defended than heretofore, another war might deprive them of the whole.  Almost as soon as peace was declared, therefore, they began to build  strong fortifications in the interior of North America. It was strange to  behold these warlike castles, on the banks of solitary lakes, and far in  the midst of woods. The Indian, paddling his birch-canoe on Lake  Champlain, looked up at the high ramparts of Ticonderoga, stone piled on  stone, bristling with cannon, and the white flag of France floating above.  There were similar fortifications on Lake Ontario, and near the great  Falls of Niagara, and at the sources of the Ohio River. And all around  these forts and castles lay the eternal forest; and the roll of the drum  died away in those deep solitudes.    The truth was, that the French intended to build forts, all the way from  Canada to Louisiana. They would then have had a wall of military strength,  at the back of the English settlements, so as completely to hem them in.  The king of England considered the building of these forts as a sufficient  cause of war, which was accordingly commenced in 1754.    \"Governor Shirley,\" said Grandfather, \"had returned to Boston in 1753.  While in Paris, he had married a second wife, a young French girl, and now  brought her to the Province House. But, when war was breaking out, it was  impossible for such a bustling man to stay quietly at home, sitting in our  old chair, with his wife and children round about him. He therefore  obtained a command in the English forces.\"    \"And what did Sir William Pepperell do?\" asked Charley.    \"He staid at home,\" said Grandfather, \"and was general of the militia. The  veteran regiments of the English army, which were now sent across the  Atlantic, would have scorned to fight under the orders of an old American  merchant. And now began what aged people call the Old French War. It would  be going too far astray from the history of our chair, to tell you one  half of the battles that were fought. I cannot even allow myself to  describe the bloody defeat of General Braddock, near the sources of the  Ohio River, in 1755. But, I must not omit to mention, that when the  English general was mortally wounded, and his army routed, "]]]
