Ruth was walking slowly by with her usual demure and sweet  expression.    \"Hullo!\" called out Susy. \"We'll meet to-night, sha'n't we?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Ruth.    \"Aren't you coming? Why, you are sort of Prime Minister to the queen.\"    \"You don't think it right really, do you,\" said Ruth--\"not from the  bottom of your heart, I mean?\"    \"Right or wrong, I mean to enjoy myself,\" said Susy Hopkins. \"I suppose,  if you come to analyse it, it is wrong, and not right. But, dear me,  Ruth! what fun should we poor girls have if we were too particular on  these points?\"    \"It always seems to me that it is worth while to do right,\" said Ruth.    \"So you say, but I don't quite agree with you. You will come to-night,  in any case, won't you?\"    \"Yes, I will come to-night; but I am not happy about it, and I wish  Kathleen--Oh, I know it is very fascinating, and Kathleen is just  delightful, but I should not like our teachers to know.\"    \"Of course not,\" said Susy, staring at her. \"They'd soon put a stop to  it.\"    \"Are you certain? I know so little about the school.\"    \"Certain? I'm convinced. Why, they'd be furious. I expect we'd be  expelled.\"    \"Then that proves it. I didn't know there was any strict rule about it.\"    \"Why, what are you made of, Ruth Craven?\"    \"I thought,\" said Ruth, \"that when we were not in school we were our own  mistresses.\"    \"To a certain extent, of course; but we have what is called the school  character to keep up. We have, as it were, to uphold the spirit of the  school. Now the spirit of the school is quite against secrecy in any  form. Oh dear, why will you drag all this out of me? I'd made up my mind  not to think of it, and now you have forced me to say it. Of course you  will come to-night. You have to think of Kathleen as well as the school,  and she's gone to a fearful lot of expense. You could not by any  possibility forsake her, could you?\"    \"No, of course not,\" said Ruth very slowly.    She bade Susy good-bye and walked on; her attitude was that of one who  was thinking hard.    \"Ruth is very pretty,\" said Susy to herself, \"but I don't know that I  quite admire her. She is the sort of girl that everybody loves, and I am  not one to admire a universal favorite. She is frightfully, tiresomely  good, and she's just _too_ pretty; and she's not a bit vain, and she's  not a bit puffed up. Oh, she is just right in every way, and yet I feel  that I hate her. She has got the sort of conscience that will worry our  queen to distraction. Still, once she joins she'll have to obey our  rules, and I expect our queen will make them somewhat stringent.\"    A clock from a neighboring church struck the half-hour. Susy looked up,  uttered an exclamation, put wings to her feet, and ran the rest of the  way home. Susy's home was in the High Street of the little town of  Merrifield. Her mother kept a fairly flourishing stationer's shop, in  one part of which was a post-office. Some ladies were buying stamps as  Susy dashed through the shop on her way to the family rooms at the back.  Mrs. Hopkins was selling stationery to a couple of boys; she looked up  as her daughter entered. Susy went into the parlor, where tea was laid  on the table. It consisted of a stale loaf, some indifferent butter, and  a little jam. The tea, in a pewter teapot, was weak; the milk was  sky-blue, and the jug that held it was cracked.    Susy poured out a cup of tea, drank it off at a gulp, snatched a piece  of bread-and-butter from the plate, and sat down to prepare her lessons  at another table. She had two hours' hard work before her, and it was  already nearly six o'clock. The quarry was a little distance away, and  she must tidy herself and do all sorts of things. Just then her mother  came in.    \"Oh, Susy,\" she said, \"I am so glad you have come! I want you to attend  to the shop for the next hour. I am sent for in a hurry to my sister's;  she has a bad cold, and wants me to call in. I think little Peter is not  well; your aunt is afraid he is catching measles. Run into the shop the  moment you have finished your tea, like a good child. You can take one  of your lesson-books with you if you like. There won't be many customers  at this hour.\"    \"Oh, mother, I did really want to work hard at my lessons. They are very  difficult, you know, and you promised that when I went to the Great  Shirley School you'd never interfere with my lesson hours.\"    \"I did say so, and of course I don't mean to interfere; but this is a  special case.\"    \"Can't Tommy go and stand in the shop? If any special customers come in  I will attend to them.\"    \"No, Tommy can't. He has a headache and is lying down upstairs. You must  oblige me this time, Susy. You can sit up a little longer to-night to  finish your lessons if you are much interrupted while I am away.\"    \"You are sure you will not be more than an hour, mother?\"    \"Oh, certain.\"    \"And I suppose in any case I may shut up the shop at seven o'clock,  mayn't I?\"    \"Shut the shop at seven o'clock!\" said Mrs. Hopkins. \"You forget that  this is Wednesday. We always keep the shop, except the post-office part,  open until past nine on Wednesdays; such a lot of people come in for  odds and ends on this special night. But I will be back long before  nine. Don't on any account shut the shop until I appear.\"    Susy, feeling cross and miserable, all her bright hopes dashed to the  ground, took a couple of books and went into the shop and sat behind the  counter. The days were getting short and cold, and as the shop door was  opened there was a thorough draught where she was sitting. Her feet  grew icy cold; she could scarcely follow the meaning of her somewhat  difficult lessons. No customers appeared.    \"How stupid I am!\" thought the little girl. \"This will never do.\"    She roused herself, and bending forward, propped her book open before  her. Presently she heard the clock outside strike seven.    \"Mother will be back now, thank goodness!\" she thought. \"If I work  desperately hard, and stop my ears so that I needn't hear a sound, I may  have done by nine o'clock.\"    Just at that moment two ladies came in to ask for a special sort of  stationery. Susy, who was never in the least interested in the shop, did  not know where to find it. She rummaged about, making a great mess  amongst her mother's neat stores; and finally she was obliged to say  that she did not know where it was.    \"Never mind,\" said one of the ladies, kindly; \"I will come in again next  time I am passing. It doesn't matter this evening.\"    Susy felt vexed; she knew her mother would blame her for sending the  ladies away without completing a purchase. And they had scarcely left  before she found the box which contained the stationery. She pushed it  out of sight on the shelf, and sat down again to her book. Her mother  ought to be coming in now. Susy would have to do a lot of exercises;  these she could not by any possibility do in the shop. She had also some  mathematical work to get through or she would never be able to keep her  place in class. Why didn't Mrs. Hopkins return? Half-an-hour went by;  three-quarters. It was now a quarter to eight. Susy felt quite  distracted. With the exception of the two ladies, there had been no  customer in the shop up to the present. The fact was, they did not  begin to appear until soon after eight on Wednesday evenings. Then the  schoolgirls and schoolboys and many other people of the poorer class  used to drop in for penn'orths and ha'p'orths of stationery, for pens,  for ink, for sealing-wax, &c.    \"Mother must be in soon. I know what I will do,\" said Susy. \"I will open  the door of the parlor and sit there. If any one appears I can dash out  at once.\"    No sooner had the thought come to her than she resolved to act on it.  She turned on the gas in the parlor--it was already brightly lighted in  the shop--and sat down to her work.    \"An hour and a quarter before the meeting of the Wild Irish Girls,\" she  said to herself. \"Strange, is it not, that I should call myself a Wild  Irish Girl when I am a Cockney through and through? Well, whatever  happens, I shall be at the meeting.\"          CHAPTER X.    THE WILD IRISH GIRLS' SOCIETY IS STARTED.      While Susy sat in the parlor a tramp happened to pass the brightly  lighted shop. He was weather-beaten and slipshod, and altogether made a  most disreputable appearance. A hand was thrust into each of his  pockets, and these pockets were destitute of coin. The tramp was hungry  and penniless. The little shop with its gay light and tempting articles  of stationery, and books and sealing-wax displayed in the window, were  quite to the man's taste. He could not see the parlor beyond, nor the  peep-hole where Susy was supposed to be able to watch the shop; he only  noticed that no one was within. The tramp was in the humor to do  something desperate; he entered the shop under the pretense of begging;  made straight for the till, pulled it open, and took out a handful of  money. He had no time to count his spoils, but leaving the till-drawer  still open, he dashed out of the shop.    Now it so happened that Susy, just when the tramp stole in, had gone  upstairs to fetch a fresh exercise-book. She noticed nothing amiss on  her return, and went tranquilly on with her work. Eight o'clock struck.  Susy was in despair.    \"I can't possibly fail Kathleen,\" she said to herself. \"She started this  splendid idea in order to help me and give me pleasure. I must be at the  quarry whatever happens to-night. Something very unusual is detaining  mother. I know what I'll do: I'll shut up the shop at half-past eight,  leave a little note for mother, and then go to the quarry as fast as I  can. I will tell mother that I am due at an important meeting, and she  is sure not to question me; mother is always very kind, and gives me as  much liberty as she can.\"  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15868"],[0,"The Man Without a Country, and Other Tales (#18)"],[1,"message do then! If, however, you have the wit to sound your long and  short on an engine-whistle, thus;--Scre scre, scre; screeee; scre scre;  scre scre scre scre scre; scre scre scre,--scre scre; screeeee screeeee;  scre; screeeee;--why, then the whole neighborhood, for five miles  around, will know that Comet must stop, if only they understand spoken  language,--and among others, the engineman of Comet will understand it;  and Comet will not run into that wreck of worlds which gives the  order,--with the nucleus of hot iron and his tail of five hundred tons  of coal.--So, of the signals which fog-bells can give, attached to  light-houses. How excellent to have them proclaim through the darkness,  \"I am Wall \"! Or of signals for steamship-engineers. When our friends  were on board the \"Arabia\" the other day, and she and the \"Europa\"  pitched into each other,--as if, on that happy week, all the continents  were to kiss and join hands all round,--how great the relief to the  passengers on each, if, through every night of their passage, collision  had been prevented by this simple expedient! One boat would have  screamed, \"Europa, Europa, Europa,\" from night to morning,--and the  other, \"Arabia, Arabia, Arabia,\"--and neither would have been mistaken,  as one unfortunately was, for a light-house.    The long and short of it is, that whoever can mark distinctions of time  can use this alphabet of long-and-short, however he may mark them. It is  therefore within the compass of all intelligent beings, except those who  are no longer conscious of the passage of time, having exchanged its  limitations for the wider sweep of eternity. The illimitable range of  this alphabet, however, is not half disclosed when this has been said.  Most articulate language addresses itself to one sense, or at most to  two, sight and sound. I see, as I write, that the particular  illustrations I have given are all of them confined to signals seen or  signals heard. But the dot-and-line alphabet, in the few years of its  history, has already shown that it is not restricted to these two  senses, but makes itself intelligible to all. Its message, of course, is  heard as well as read. Any good operator understands the sounds of its  ticks upon the flowing strip of paper, as well as when he sees it As he  lies in his cot at midnight, he will expound the passing message without  striking a light to see it But this is only what may be said of any  written language. You can read this article to your wife, or she can  read it, as she prefers; that is, she chooses whether it shall address  her eye or her ear. But the long-and-short alphabet of Morse and his  imitators despises such narrow range. It addresses whichever of the five  senses the listener chooses. This fact is illustrated by a curious set  of anecdotes,--never yet put in print, I think,--of that critical  despatch which in one night announced General Taylor's death to this  whole land. Most of the readers of these lines probably read that  despatch in the morning's paper. The compositors and editors had read  it. To them it was a despatch to the eye. But half the operators at the  stations _heard_ it ticked out, by the register stroke, and knew it  before they wrote it down for the press. To them it was a despatch to  the ear. My good friend Langenzunge had not that resource. He had just  been promised, by the General himself (under whom he served at Palo  Alto), the office of Superintendent of the Rocky Mountain Lines. He was  returning from Washington over the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, on a  freight-train, when he heard of the President's danger. Langenzunge  loved Old Rough and Ready,--and he felt badly about his own office, too.  But his extempore train chose to stop at a forsaken shanty-village on  the Potomac, for four mortal hours, at midnight. What does he do, but  walk down the line into the darkness, climb a telegraph-post, cut a  wire, and applied the two ends to his tongue, to _taste_, at the fatal  moment, the words, \"Died at half past ten.\" Poor Langenzunge! he hardly  had nerve to solder the wire again. Cogs told me that they had just  fitted up the Naguadavick stations with Bain's chemical revolving disk.  This disk is charged with a salt of potash, which, when the electric  spark passes through it, is changed to Prussian blue. Your despatch is  noiselessly written in dark blue dots and lines. Just as the disk  started on that fatal despatch, and Cogs bent over it to read, his  spirit-lamp blew up,--as the dear things will. They were beside  themselves in the lonely, dark office; but, while the men were fumbling  for matches, which would not go, Cogs's sister, Nydia, a sweet blind  girl, who had learned Bain's alphabet from Dr. Howe at South Boston,  bent over the chemical paper, and _smelt_ out the prussiate of potash,  as it formed itself in lines and dots to tell the sad story. Almost  anybody used to reading the blind books can read the embossed Morse  messages with the finger,--and so this message was read at all the  midnight way-stations where no night-work is expected, and where the  companies do not supply fluid or oil. Within my narrow circle of  acquaintance, therefore, there were these simultaneous instances, where  the same message was seen, heard, smelled, tasted, and felt. So  universal is the dot-and-line alphabet,--for Bain's is on the same  principle as Morse's.    The reader sees, therefore, first, that the dot-and-line alphabet can be  employed by any being who has command of any long and short symbols,--be  they long and short notches, such as Robinson Crusoe kept his accounts  with, or long and short waves of electricity, such as these which  Valentia is sending across to the Newfoundland bay, so prophetically and  appropriately named \"The Bay of Bulls.\" Also, I hope the reader sees  that the alphabet can be understood by any intelligent being who has any  one of the five senses left him,--by all rational men, that is,  excepting the few eyeless deaf persons who have lost both taste and  smell in some complete paralysis. The use of Morse's telegraph is by no  means confined to the small clique who possess or who understand  electrical batteries. It is not only the torpedo or the _Gymnotus  electricus_ that can send us messages from the ocean. Whales in the sea  can telegraph as well as senators on land, if they will only note the  difference between long spoutings and short ones. And they can listen,  too. If they will only note the difference between long and short, the  eel of Ocean's bottom may feel on his slippery skin the smooth messages  of our Presidents, and the catfish, in his darkness, look fearless on  the secrets of a Queen. Any beast, bird, fish, or insect, which can  discriminate between long and short, may use the telegraph alphabet, if  he have sense enough. Any creature, which can hear, smell, taste, feel,  or see, may take note of its signals, if he can understand them. A tired  listener at church, by properly varying his long yawns and his short  ones, may express his opinion of the sermon to the opposite gallery  before the sermon is done. A dumb tobacconist may trade with his  customers in an alphabet of short-sixes and long-nines. A beleaguered  Sebastopol may explain its wants to the relieving army beyond the line  of the Chernaya, by the lispings of its short Paixhans and its long  twenty-fours.          THE LAST VOYAGE OF THE RESOLUTE.      [I had some opportunities, which no other writer for the press had, I  believe, of examining the Resolute on her return from that weird voyage  which is the most remarkable in the history of the navies of the world.  And, as I know of no other printed record of the whole of that voyage  than this, which was published in the Boston Daily Advertiser of June  11, 1856, I reprint it here. Readers should remember that the English  government abandoned all claim on the vessel; that the American  government then bought her of the salvors, refitted her completely, and  sent her to England as a present to the Queen. The Queen visited the  ship, and accepted the present in person. The Resolute has never since  been to sea. I do not load the page with authorities; but I studied the  original reports of the Arctic expeditions carefully in preparing the  paper, and I believe it to be accurate throughout.    The voyage from New London to England, when she was thus returned, is  strictly her last voyage. But when this article was printed its name was  correct.]           *       *       *       *       *    It was in early spring in 1852, early on the morning of the 21st of  April, that the stout English discovery ship Resolute, manned by a large  crew, commanded by a most manly man, Henry Kellett, left her moorings  in the great river Thames, a little below the old town of London, was  taken in tow by a fussy steam-tug, and proudly started as one of a fine  English squadron in the great search of the nations for the lost Sir  John Franklin. It was late in the year 1855, on the 24th of December,  that the same ship, weather-worn, scantily rigged, without her lighter  masts, all in the trim of a vessel which has had a hard fight with wind,  water, ice, and time, made the light-house of _New_ London,--waited for  day and came round to anchor in the other river Thames, of _New_  England. Not one man of the English crew was on board. The gallant  Captain Kellett was not there; but in his place an American master, who  had shown, in his way, equal gallantry. The sixty or seventy men with  whom she sailed were all in their homes more than a year ago. The eleven  men with whom she returned had had to double parts, and to work hard to  make good the places of the sixty. And between the day when the  Englishmen left her, and the day the Americans found her, she had spent  fifteen months and more alone. She was girt in by the ice of the Arctic  seas. No man knows where she went, what narrow scapes"]]]
