Hey?\"    \"How long before sunset now?\" asked Buck Daniels sharply.    \"Maybe a couple of hours.\"    \"A couple of hours,\" repeated Daniels, and ground his knuckles across  his forehead. \"A couple of hours!\"    He raised his glass with a jerky motion and downed the contents; the  chaser stood disregarded before him and O'Brien regarded his patron with  an eye of admiration.    \"You long for these parts?\" he asked.    \"No, I'm strange to this range. Riding up north pretty soon, if I can  get someone to tell me the lay of the land. D'you know it?\"    \"Never been further north than Brownsville.\"    \"Couldn't name me someone that's travelled about, I s'pose?\"    \"Old Gary Peters knows every rock within three day's riding. He keeps  the blacksmith shop across the way.\"    \"So? Thanks; I'll look him up.\"    Buck Daniels found the blacksmith seated on a box before his place of  business; it was a slack time for Gary Peters and he consoled himself  for idleness by chewing the stem of an unlighted corn-cob, whose bowl  was upside down. His head was pulled down and forward as if by the  weight of his prodigious sandy moustache, and he regarded a vague  horizon with misty eyes.    \"Seen you comin' out of O'Brien's,\" said the blacksmith, as Buck took  possession of a nearby box. \"What's the news?\"    \"Ain't any news,\" responded Buck dejectedly. \"Too much talk; no news.\"    \"That's right,\" nodded Gary Peters. \"O'Brien is the out-talkingest man I  ever see. Ain't nobody on Brownsville can get his tongue around so many  words as O'Brien.\"    So saying, he blew through his pipe, picked up a stick of soft pine, and  began to whittle it to a point.    \"In my part of the country,\" went on Buck Daniels, \"they don't lay much  by a man that talks a pile.\"    Here the blacksmith turned his head slowly, regarded his companion for  an instant, and then resumed his whittling.    \"But,\" said Daniels, with a sigh, \"if I could find a man that knowed  the country north of Brownsville and had a hobble on his tongue I could  give him a night's work that'd be worth while.\"    Gary Peters removed his pipe from his mouth and blew out his dropping  moustaches. He turned one wistful glance upon his idle forge; he turned  a sadder eye upon his companion.    \"I could name you a silent man or two in Brownsville,\" he said, \"but  there ain't only one man that knows the country right.\"    \"That so? And who might he be?\"    \"Me.\"    \"You?\" echoed Daniels in surprise. He turned and considered Gary as if  for the first time. \"Maybe you know the lay of the land up as far as  Hawkin's Arroyo?\"    \"Me? Son, I know every cactus clear to Bald Eagle.\"    \"H-m-m!\" muttered Daniels. \"I s'pose maybe you could name some of the  outfits from here on a line with Bald Eagle--say you put 'em ten miles  apart?\"    \"Nothin' easier. I could find 'em blindfold. First due out they's  McCauley's. Then lay a bit west of north and you hit the Circle K  Bar--that's about twelve mile from McCauley's. Hit 'er up dead north  again, by east, and you come eight miles to Three Roads. Go on to--\"    \"Partner,\" cut in Daniels, \"I could do business with you.\"    \"Maybe you could.\"    \"My name's Daniels.\"    \"I'm Gary Peters. H'ware you?\"    They shook hands.    \"Peters,\" said Buck Daniels, \"you look square, and I need you in square  game; but there ain't any questions that go with it. Twenty iron men for  one day's riding and one day's silence.\"    \"M'frien',\" murmured Peters. \"In my day I've gone three months without  speakin' to anything in boots; and I wasn't hired for it, neither.\"    \"You know them people up the line,\" said Daniels. \"Do they know you?\"    \"I'll tell a man they do! Know Gary Peters?\"    \"Partner, this is what I want. I want you to leave Brownsville inside of  ten minutes and start riding for Elkhead. I want you to ride, and I want  you to ride like hell. Every ten miles, or so, I want you to stop at  some place where you can get a fresh hoss. Get your fresh hoss and leave  the one you've got off, and tell them to have the hoss you leave ready  for me any time to-night. It'll take you clear till to-morrow night to  reach Elkhead, even with relayin' your hosses?\"    \"Round about that, if I ride like hell. What do I take with me?\"    \"Nothing. Nothing but the coin I give you to hire someone at every stop  to have that hoss you've left ready for me. Better still, if you can  have 'em, get a fresh hoss. Would they trust you with hosses that way,  Gary?\"    \"Gimme the coin and where they won't trust me I'll pay cash.\"    \"I can do it. It'll about bust me, but I can do it.\"    \"You going to try for a record between Brownsville and Elkhead, eh? Got  a bet up, eh?\"    \"The biggest bet you ever heard of,\" said Daniels grimly. \"You can tell  the boys along the road that I'm tryin' for time. Have you got a fast  hoss to start with?\"    \"Got a red mare that ain't much for runnin' cattle, but she's greased  lightnin' for a short bust.\"    \"Then get her out. Saddle her up, and be on your way. Here's my  stake--I'll keep back one twenty for accidents. First gimme a list of  the places you'll stop for the relays.\"    He produced an old envelope and a stub of soft pencil with which he  jotted down Gary Peters' directions.    \"And every second,\" said Buck Daniels in parting, \"that you can cut off  your own time will be a second cut off'n mine. Because I'm liable to be  on your heels when you ride into Elkhead.\"    Gary Peters lifted his eyebrows and then restored his pipe. He spoke  through his teeth.    \"You ain't got a piece of money to bet on that, partner?\" he queried  softly.    \"Ten extra if you get to Elkhead before me.\"    \"They's limits to hoss-flesh,\" remarked Peters. \"What time you ridin'  against?\"    \"Against a cross between a bullet and a nor'easter, Gary. I'm going  back to drink to your luck.\"    A promise which Buck Daniels fulfilled, for he had need of even borrowed  strength. He drank steadily until a rattle of hoofs down the street  entered the saloon, and then someone came in to say that Gary Peters had  started out of town to \"beat all hell, on his red mare.\"    After that, Buck started out to find Dan Barry. His quarry was not in  the barn nor in the corral behind the barn. There stood Satan and Black  Bart, but their owner was not in sight. But a thought came to Buck while  he looked, rather mournfully, at the stallion's promise of limitless  speed. \"If I can hold him up jest half a minute,\" murmured Buck to  himself, \"jest half a minute till I get a start, I've got a rabbit's  chance of livin' out the night!\"    From the door of the first shed he took a heavy chain with the key in  the padlock. This chain he looped about the post and the main timber of  the gate, snapped the padlock, and threw the key into the distance. Then  he stepped back and surveyed his work with satisfaction. It would be a  pretty job to file through that chain, or to knock down those ponderous  rails of the fence and make a gap. A smile of satisfaction came on the  face of Buck Daniels, then, hitching at his belt, and pulling his  sombrero lower over his eyes, he started once more to find Dan Barry.    He was more in haste now, for the sun was dipping behind the mountains  of the west and the long shadows moved along the ground with a  perceptible speed. When he reached the street he found a steady drift of  people towards O'Brien's barroom. They came by ones and twos and idled  in front of the swinging doors or slyly peeked through them and then  whispered one to the other. Buck accosted one of those by the door and  asked what was wrong.    \"He's in there,\" said the other, with a broad and excited grin. \"He's in  there--waitin'!\"    And when Buck threw the doors wide he saw, at the farther end of the  deserted barroom, Dan Barry, seated at a table braiding a small  horsehair chain. His hat was pushed far back on his head; he had his  back to the door. Certainly he must be quite unaware that all  Brownsville was waiting, breathless, for his destruction. Behind the bar  stood O'Brien, pale under his bristles, and his eyes never leaving the  slender figure at the end of his room; but seeing Buck he called with  sudden loudness: \"Come in, stranger. Come in and have one on the house.  There ain't nothing but silence around this place and it's getting on my  nerves.\"    Buck Daniels obeyed the invitation at once, and behind him, stepping  softly, some of them entering with their hats in their hands and on  tiptoe, came a score of the inhabitants of Brownsville. They lined the  bar up and down its length; not a word was spoken; but every head turned  as at a given signal towards the quiet man at the end of the room.          CHAPTER XVI    THE COMING OF NIGHT      It was not yet full dusk, for the shadows were still swinging out from  the mountains and a ghost of colour lingered in the west, but midnight  lay in the open eyes of Jerry Strann. There had been no struggle, no  outcry, no lifting of head or hand. One instant his eyes were closed,  and then, indeed, he looked like death; the next instant the eyes open,  he smiled, the wind stirred in his bright hair. He had never seemed so  happily alive as in the moment of his death. Fatty Matthews held the  mirror close to the faintly parted lips, examined it, and then drew  slowly back towards the door, his eyes steady upon Mac Strann.    \"Mac,\" he said, \"it's come. I got just this to say: whatever you do, for  God's sake stay inside the law!\"    And he slipped through the door and was gone.    But Mac Strann did not raise his head or cast a glance after the  marshal. He sat turning the limp hand of Jerry back and forth in his  own, and his eyes wandered vaguely through the window and down to the  roofs of the village.    Night thickened perceptibly every moment, yet still while the eastern  slope of every roof was jet black, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12473"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 06 (#18)"],[1,"had happened, to their room. They permitted me to  talk an hour longer with them. Our conversation, like the earth's  course, was about the sun. The mother declared that the sun, as it sank  in the snowy clouds, seemed like a red glowing rose, which the gallant  heaven had thrown upon the white outspreading bridal-veil of his loved  earth. The daughter smiled, and thought that a frequent observation of  such phenomena weakened their impression. The mother corrected this  error by a quotation from Goethe's _Letters of Travel_, and asked me if  I had read _Werther_. I believe that we also spoke of Angora cats,  Etruscan vases, Turkish shawls, maccaroni, and Lord Byron, from whose  poems the elder lady, daintly lisping and sighing, recited several  passages about the sunset. To the younger lady, who did not understand  English, and who wished to become familiar with those poems, I  recommended the translation of my fair and gifted countrywoman, the  Baroness Elise von Hohenhausen. On this occasion, as is my custom when  talking with young ladies, I did not fail to declaim against Byron's  godlessness, heartlessness, cheerlessness, and heaven knows what  besides.    After this business I took a walk on the Brocken, for there it is never  quite dark. The mist was not heavy, and I could see the outlines of the  two hills known as the Witch's Altar and the Devil's Pulpit. I fired my  pistol, but there was no echo. Suddenly, however, I heard familiar  voices and found myself embraced and kissed. The newcomers were  fellow-students from my own part of Germany, and had left Goettingen four  days later than I. Great was their astonishment at finding me again,  alone on the Blocksberg. Then came a flood tide of narrative, of  astonishment, and of appointment-making, of laughing, and of  recollecting, and in the spirit we found ourselves again in our learned  Siberia, where refinement is carried to such an extent that the bears  are tied up in the taverns, and the sables wish the hunter good  evening.[54]    In the great room we had supper. There was a long table, with two rows  of hungry students. At first we indulged in the usual topic of  university conversation--duels, duels, and once again duels. The company  consisted principally of Halle students, and Halle formed, in  consequence, the nucleus of their discourse. The window-panes of  Court-Councilor Schuetz were exegetically illuminated. Then it was  mentioned that the King of Cyprus' last levee had been very brilliant;  that the monarch had chosen a natural son; that he had married with the  left hand a princess of the house of Lichtenstein; that the  State-mistress had been forced to resign, and that the entire ministry,  greatly moved, had wept according to rule. I need hardly explain that  this all referred to certain beer dignitaries in Halle. Then the two  Chinese, who two years before had been exhibited in Berlin, and who were  now appointed lecturers on Chinese esthetics in Halle, were discussed.  Then jokes were made. Some one supposed a case in which a live German  might be exhibited for money in China, and to this end a placard was  fabricated, in which the mandarins Tsching-Tschang-Tschung and Hi-Ha-Ho  certified that the man was a genuine Teuton, including a list of his  accomplishments, which consisted principally of philosophizing, smoking,  and endless patience. It concluded with the notice that visitors were  prohibited from bringing any dogs with them at twelve o'clock (the hour  for feeding the captive), as these animals would be sure to snap from  the poor German all his titbits.    A young _Burschenschafter_, who had recently passed his period of  purification in Berlin, spoke much, but very partially, of this city. He  had frequented both Wisotzki and the theatre, but judged falsely of  both. \"For youth is ever ready with a word,\" etc. He spoke of the  sumptuousness of the costumes, of scandals among actors and actresses,  and similar matters. The youth knew not that in Berlin, where outside  show exerts the greatest influence (as is abundantly evidenced by the  commonness of the phrase \"so people do\"), this ostentation must flourish  on the stage preeminently, and consequently that the special care of the  management must be for \"the color of the beard with which a part is  played\" and for the truthfulness of the costumes which are designed by  sworn historians and sewed by scientifically instructed tailors. And  this is indispensable. For if Maria Stuart wore an apron belonging to  the time of Queen Anne, the banker, Christian Gumpel, would with justice  complain that thereby all illusion was destroyed; and if Lord Burleigh  in a moment of forgetfulness should don the hose of Henry the Fourth,  then the War-Councilor Von Steinzopf's wife, _nee_ Lilienthau, would not  get the anachronism out of her head for the whole evening.... But little  as this young man had comprehended the conditions of the Berlin drama,  still less was he aware that the Spontini Janissary opera, with its  kettledrums, elephants, trumpets, and gongs, is a heroic means of  inspiring our enervated people with warlike enthusiasm--a means once  shrewdly recommended by Plato and Cicero. Least of all did the youth  comprehend the diplomatic significance of the ballet. It was with great  trouble that I finally made him understand that there was really more  political science in Hoguet's feet than in Buchholz's head, that all his  _tours de danse_ signified diplomatic negotiations, and that his every  movement hinted at state matters; as, for instance, when he bent forward  anxiously, stretching his hands out wide and grasping at the air, he  meant our Cabinet; that a hundred pirouettes on one toe without quitting  the spot alluded to the German Diet; that he was thinking of the lesser  princes when he tripped around with his legs tied; that he described the  European balance of power when he tottered hither and thither like a  drunken man; that he hinted at a Congress when he twisted his bended  arms together like a skein; and finally, that he sets forth our  altogether too great friend in the East, when, very gradually unfolding  himself, he rises on high, stands for a long time in this elevated  position, and then all at once breaks out into the most terrifying  leaps. The scales fell from the eyes of the young man, and he now saw  how it was that dancers are better paid than great poets, and why the  ballet forms in diplomatic circles an inexhaustible subject of  conversation. By Apis! how great is the number of the esoteric, and how  small the array of the esoteric frequenters of the theatre! There sit  the stupid audience, gaping and admiring leaps and attitudes, studying  anatomy in the positions of Lemiere, and applauding the _entrechats_ of  Roehnisch, prattling of \"grace,\" \"harmony,\" and \"limbs\"--no one remarking  meanwhile that he has before him in chronological ciphers the destiny of  the German Fatherland.           *       *       *       *       *    The company around the table gradually became better acquainted and much  noisier. Wine banished beer, punch-bowls steamed, songs were sung, and  brotherhood was drunk in true student fashion. The old \"Landsfather  toast\" and the beautiful songs of W. Mueller, Rueckert, Uhland, and others  rang out with the exquisite airs of Methfessel. Best of all sounded our  own Arndt's German words, \"The Lord, who bade iron grow, wished for no  slaves.\" And out of doors it roared as if the old mountain sang with us,  and a few reeling friends even asserted that he merrily shook his bald  head, which caused the great unsteadiness of the floor of our room.           *       *       *       *       *    During this crazy scene, in which plates learned to dance and glasses to  fly, there sat opposite me two youths, beautiful and pale as statues,  one resembling Adonis, the other Apollo. The faint rosy hue which the  wine spread over their cheeks was scarcely noticeable. They gazed on  each other with infinite affection, as if the one could read in the eyes  of the other, and in those eyes there was a light as though drops of  light had fallen therein from the cup of burning love, which an angel on  high bears from one star to the other. They conversed softly with  earnest trembling voices, and narrated sad stories, through all of which  ran a tone of strange sorrow. \"Lora is dead now too!\" said one, and,  sighing, proceeded to tell of a maiden of Halle who had loved a student,  and who, when the latter left Halle, spoke no more to any one, ate but  little, wept day and night, gazing over on the canary-bird which her  lover had given her. \"The bird died, and Lora did not long survive it,\"  was the conclusion, and both the youths sighed as though their hearts  would break. Finally the other said, \"My soul is sorrowful; come forth  with me into the dark night! Let me inhale the breath of the clouds and  the moon-rays. Companion of my sorrow! I love thee; thy words are  musical, like the rustling of reeds and the flow of rivulets; they  reecho in my breast, but my soul is sad!\"    Both of the young men arose. One threw his arm around the neck of the  other, and thus they left the noisy room. I followed, and saw them enter  a dark chamber, where the one by mistake, instead of the window, threw  open the door of a large wardrobe, and both, standing before it with  outstretched arms, expressing poetic rapture, spoke alternately. \"Ye  breezes of darkening night,\" cried the first, \"how ye cool and revive my  cheeks! How sweetly ye play amid my fluttering locks! I stand on the  cloudy peak of the mountain; far below me lie the sleeping cities of  men, and blue waters gleam. List! far below in the valley rustle the  fir-trees! Far above yonder hills sweep in misty forms the spirits of  our fathers. Oh, that I could hunt with ye on your cloud-steeds through  the stormy night, over the rolling sea, upwards to the stars! Alas! I am  laden"]]]
