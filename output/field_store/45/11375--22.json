But this warranty requires not only that the vessel shall sail under  the protection of the convoy, but also that she shall continue during  its course under the same protection, unless prevented from so doing  by tempest or other unavoidable accident, in which case, the master  and owners will be excused, if the master does all that is in his  power to keep with the convoy.    The merchantman must, before sailing, obtain or endeavour to obtain,  the sailing orders issued by the convoying squadron. The value of a  convoy appointed by Government arises in a great degree from its  taking the ships under control, as well as under protection; but this  control cannot be exercised except by means of sailing orders.  Otherwise, the master could not learn the rendezvous in case of  dispersion by a storm, or obey signals in case of attack.    The obligation to sail with convoy does not depend merely on special  agreement; but, by act of parliament, a merchant cannot sail without a  convoy, on a _foreign_ voyage, unless previously licensed to do  so.[197]        SECTION IV.      [Sidenote: _Armed Neutralities_.]    It is not improbable the course of events in the present war may make  it not uninteresting to my readers to have some short account of the  origin and meaning of _Armed Neutralities_, especially as the  principles on which they were founded may again be open to discussion.  The right to take enemy's property on board neutral vessels has, in  the present war, been waived by the Queen, in a declaration, dated  Buckingham Palace, March 29th 1854. This is however tempered by a  reservation of the right to search for contraband. Up to the present  time the right to take enemy's goods on board a neutral vessel has in  this country been steadily maintained; though in France it has been  fluctuating; the interests of another commercial power became the  origin of the extraordinary confederacies termed _Armed Neutralities_.  At an early period it was an object of interest with Holland, a great  commercial and navigating country, whose permanent policy was  essentially pacific, to obtain a relaxation of the severe rules which  had previously been observed in maritime warfare. The States General  of the United Provinces having complained of the provisions in the  French Ordinance of 1538, a treaty of commerce was concluded between  France and the Republic in 1646, by which the law, as far as respected  the capture and confiscation of neutral vessels for carrying enemy's  property, was suspended; but it was found impossible to obtain, at  that time, any relaxation as to the liability to capture of enemy's  property in neutral vessels.    This latter concession, however, the United Provinces obtained from  France by the treaty of alliance of 1662, and the commercial treaty  signed at the same time with the peace, at Nimiguen, in 1671;  confirmed by the treaty of Ryswick, in 1697. The maxim that _free  ships_ make _free goods_ was coupled in these treaties with its  correlative maxim, _enemy's ships_ make _enemy's goods_.    The same concession was obtained by Holland from England in 1668 and  1674, as the price of an alliance between the two countries against  the ambitious designs of Louis XIV.    In the subsequent war of 1756, a controversy arose between England and  Holland, in which it was said, on the one hand, that England had  violated the rights of neutral commerce; and on the other, that  Holland had not fulfilled the guarantees under which those privileges  had been granted.    Afterwards, when the American Revolution gave rise to a war between  France and Great Britain, the latter power, instead of following the  example of her enemy, (who had issued an ordinance prohibiting the  seizure of neutral vessels, even when bound to or from enemy ports,  unless carrying contraband,) issued an order in council, (March,  1780,) suspending the special stipulations respecting commerce and  navigation contained in the Treaty of 1674.    This was the crisis of many complaints made by the neutral powers  against Great Britain; and, in 1780, the Empress of Russia proclaimed  the principles of the Baltic Code of Neutrality, and declared she  would maintain them by _force of arms_.    This system of armed neutrality contained the following principles.    1. That commerce with the ports and roads of the enemy is free to  neutral powers.    2. That the ship covers the cargo.    3. That those merchandizes only be considered as contraband, which are  declared to be such by treaties with the belligerent powers, or with  one of them.    4. That no place shall be considered as blockaded, till it is  surrounded in such a manner by hostile ships that no person can enter  it without manifest danger.    5. That these principles shall serve as a basis for decisions  concerning the legality of prizes.    The principal powers of Europe, as Sweden, Denmark, Prussia, Germany,  Holland, France, Spain, Portugal, Naples, and also the United States,  acceded to the Russian principles of neutrality.    The Court of London answered this declaration by appealing to \"the  principles generally acknowledged as the Law of Nations, being the  only law between powers where no treaties subsist;\" and to         \"the tenor of its different engagements with other powers,       where those engagements had altered the primitive law by       neutral stipulations, according to the will and convenience       of the contracting parties.\"    England, being thus opposed to all the maritime world, was at this  time obliged to smother her resentment; only simply expostulating with  Russia. But the want of the consent of a power of such decided  maritime superiority as that of Great Britain, was an insuperable  obstacle to the success of the Baltic Conventional Law of Neutrality;  and it was abandoned in 1793 by the naval powers of Europe, as not  sanctioned by the existing law of nations, in every case in which the  doctrines of that code did not rest upon positive compact.    During the protracted wars of the French Revolution, all the  belligerent powers began by discarding in practice, not only the  principles of the armed neutrality, but even the generally received  maxims of international law by which neutral commerce in time of war  had been previously regulated. France, on her part, revived the  severity of her ancient prize code; decreeing not only the capture and  condemnation of the goods of her enemies found on board neutral  vessels, but even of the vessels themselves laden with goods of  British growth, produce, and manufacture.    In 1801, principally in consequence of the doctrines of the British  Admiralty Courts with regard to the right of search, great efforts  were made by the Baltic powers to recall and enforce the doctrines of  the armed neutrality of 1780. This attempt is generally known as the  Armed Neutrality of 1800, and was met, promptly overpowered, and the  confederacy finally dissolved, by the naval power of England. Russia  gave up the point, and by her convention with England of the 17th of  June, 1801, expressly agreed, that enemy's property was not to be  protected on board of neutral ships.[198] This settlement was ended by  the death of the Emperor Paul.          APPENDIX TO PART I.        NOTE A.--_The Law of Reprisals_.[199]    Reprisals by commission, or letters of marque and reprisal, granted to  one or more injured persons, in the name and authority of the  Sovereign, constitutes a case of \"partial, or special reprisals,\" and  is considered to be compatible with a state of peace, and was formerly  permitted by the Law of Nations; though it may be doubted if such a  rule would hold good now.[200] General reprisals upon the persons and  property of the subjects of another nation are equivalent to open war.  It is often the first step which is taken at the commencement of a  public war, and may be considered as amounting to a declaration of  hostilities, unless satisfaction is made by the offending state.    A stoppage or seizure (in other words, an embargo), must not be  confounded with complete reprisals. When ships are seized for the  purpose of obtaining satisfaction for a particular injury, or security  against a possible event, that seizure is only an embargo. The vessels  are preserved as long as there is any hope of obtaining satisfaction  or justice. As soon as that hope disappears, they are confiscated, and  the reprisals are accomplished. In fact, that which was _embargo_  becomes reprisals by the _act of confiscation_.[201]    In the words of Lord Stowell:         \"Upon property so detained the declaration of war is said to       have a retroactive effect, and to render it liable to be       considered as the property of enemies taken in time of war.       The property is seized provisionally--an act hostile enough       in the mere execution, but equivocal as to its effects, and       liable to be varied by subsequent events, and by the conduct       of the government, the property of whose subjects is so       detained. Where the first seizure is equivocal, if the       matter in dispute terminates in reconciliation, the seizure       is converted into a mere civil embargo. This would be the       retroactive effect of that course of circumstances. On the       contrary, if the transactions end in hostility, the       retroactive effect is directly the other way. It impresses a       hostile character upon the original seizure. It is declared       to be embargo; it is no longer an equivocal act, subject to       two interpretations; there is a declaration of the _animus_       by which it was done, that it was done _hostili animo_, and       is to be considered a hostile measure _ab initio_. The       property taken is liable to be used as the property of       persons, trespassers _ab initio_, and guilty of injuries       which they have refused to redeem by any amicable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13882"],[0,"John Thorndyke's Cases (#18)"],[1,"t, for instance\" (a very spruce, hard felt), \"is a new one, I think.\"    \"Got it last week,\" said Mr. Loewe.    \"Exactly. It is an expensive hat, by Lincoln and Bennett, and I see you  have judiciously written your name in indelible marking-ink on the  lining. Now, a new hat suggests a discarded predecessor. What do you do  with your old hats?\"    \"My man has them, but they don't fit him. I suppose he sells them or  gives them away.\"    \"Very well. Now, a good hat like yours has a long life, and remains  serviceable long after it has become shabby; and the probability is that  many of your hats pass from owner to owner; from you to the  shabby-genteel, and from them to the shabby ungenteel. And it is a fair  assumption that there are, at this moment, an appreciable number of  tramps and casuals wearing hats by Lincoln and Bennett, marked in  indelible ink with the name S. Loewe; and anyone who should examine those  hats, as you suggest, might draw some very misleading deductions as to  the personal habits of S. Loewe.\"    Mr. Marchmont chuckled audibly, and then, remembering the gravity of  the occasion, suddenly became portentously solemn.    \"So you think that the hat is of no use, after all?\" said Mr. Loewe, in a  tone of deep disappointment.    \"I won't say that,\" replied Thorndyke. \"We may learn something from it.  Leave it with me, at any rate; but you must let the police know that I  have it. They will want to see it, of course.\"    \"And you will try to get those things, won't you?\" pleaded Loewe.    \"I will think over the case. But you understand, or Mr. Marchmont does,  that this is hardly in my province. I am a medical jurist, and this is  not a medico-legal case.\"    \"Just what I told him,\" said Marchmont. \"But you will do me a great  kindness if you will look into the matter. Make it a medico-legal case,\"  he added persuasively.    Thorndyke repeated his promise, and the two men took their departure.    For some time after they had left, my colleague remained silent,  regarding the hat with a quizzical smile. \"It is like a game of  forfeits,\" he remarked at length, \"and we have to find the owner of  'this very pretty thing.'\" He lifted it with a pair of forceps into a  better light, and began to look at it more closely.    \"Perhaps,\" said he, \"we have done Mr. Loewe an injustice, after all. This  is certainly a very remarkable hat.\"    \"It is as round as a basin,\" I exclaimed. \"Why, the fellow's head must  have been turned in a lathe!\"    Thorndyke laughed. \"The point,\" said he, \"is this. This is a hard hat,  and so must have fitted fairly, or it could not have been worn; and it  was a cheap hat, and so was not made to measure. But a man with a head  that shape has got to come to a clear understanding with his hat. No  ordinary hat would go on at all.    \"Now, you see what he has done--no doubt on the advice of some friendly  hatter. He has bought a hat of a suitable size, and he has made it  hot--probably steamed it. Then he has jammed it, while still hot and  soft, on to his head, and allowed it to cool and set before removing it.  That is evident from the distortion of the brim. The important corollary  is, that this hat fits his head exactly--is, in fact, a perfect mould of  it; and this fact, together with the cheap quality of the hat, furnishes  the further corollary that it has probably only had a single owner.    \"And now let us turn it over and look at the outside. You notice at once  the absence of old dust. Allowing for the circumstance that it had been  out all night, it is decidedly clean. Its owner has been in the habit of  brushing it, and is therefore presumably a decent, orderly man. But if  you look at it in a good light, you see a kind of bloom on the felt, and  through this lens you can make out particles of a fine white powder  which has worked into the surface.\"    He handed me his lens, through which I could distinctly see the  particles to which he referred.    \"Then,\" he continued, \"under the curl of the brim and in the folds of  the hatband, where the brush has not been able to reach it, the powder  has collected quite thickly, and we can see that it is a very fine  powder, and very white, like flour. What do you make of that?\"    \"I should say that it is connected with some industry. He may be  engaged in some factory or works, or, at any rate, may live near a  factory, and have to pass it frequently.\"    \"Yes; and I think we can distinguish between the two possibilities. For,  if he only passes the factory, the dust will be on the outside of the  hat only; the inside will be protected by his head. But if he is engaged  in the works, the dust will be inside, too, as the hat will hang on a  peg in the dust-laden atmosphere, and his head will also be powdered,  and so convey the dust to the inside.\"    He turned the hat over once more, and as I brought the powerful lens to  bear upon the dark lining, I could clearly distinguish a number of white  particles in the interstices of the fabric.    \"The powder is on the inside, too,\" I said.    He took the lens from me, and, having verified my statement, proceeded  with the examination. \"You notice,\" he said, \"that the leather  head-lining is stained with grease, and this staining is more pronounced  at the sides and back. His hair, therefore, is naturally greasy, or he  greases it artificially; for if the staining were caused by  perspiration, it would be most marked opposite the forehead.\"    He peered anxiously into the interior of the hat, and eventually turned  down the head-lining; and immediately there broke out upon his face a  gleam of satisfaction.    \"Ha!\" he exclaimed. \"This is a stroke of luck. I was afraid our neat and  orderly friend had defeated us with his brush. Pass me the small  dissecting forceps, Jervis.\"    I handed him the instrument, and he proceeded to pick out daintily from  the space behind the head-lining some half a dozen short pieces of  hair, which he laid, with infinite tenderness, on a sheet of white  paper.    \"There are several more on the other side,\" I said, pointing them out to  him.    \"Yes, but we must leave some for the police,\" he answered, with a smile.  \"They must have the same chance as ourselves, you know.\"    \"But surely,\" I said, as I bent down over the paper, \"these are pieces  of horsehair!\"    \"I think not,\" he replied; \"but the microscope will show. At any rate,  this is the kind of hair I should expect to find with a head of that  shape.\"    \"Well, it is extraordinarily coarse,\" said I, \"and two of the hairs are  nearly white.\"    \"Yes; black hairs beginning to turn grey. And now, as our preliminary  survey has given such encouraging results, we will proceed to more exact  methods; and we must waste no time, for we shall have the police here  presently to rob us of our treasure.\"    He folded up carefully the paper containing the hairs, and taking the  hat in both hands, as though it were some sacred vessel, ascended with  me to the laboratory on the next floor.    \"Now, Polton,\" he said to his laboratory assistant, \"we have here a  specimen for examination, and time is precious. First of all, we want  your patent dust-extractor.\"    The little man bustled to a cupboard and brought forth a singular  appliance, of his own manufacture, somewhat like a miniature vacuum  cleaner. It had been made from a bicycle foot-pump, by reversing the  piston-valve, and was fitted with a glass nozzle and a small detachable  glass receiver for collecting the dust, at the end of a flexible metal  tube.    \"We will sample the dust from the outside first,\" said Thorndyke, laying  the hat upon the work-bench. \"Are you ready, Polton?\"    The assistant slipped his foot into the stirrup of the pump and worked  the handle vigorously, while Thorndyke drew the glass nozzle slowly  along the hat-brim under the curled edge. And as the nozzle passed  along, the white coating vanished as if by magic, leaving the felt  absolutely clean and black, and simultaneously the glass receiver became  clouded over with a white deposit.    \"We will leave the other side for the police,\" said Thorndyke, and as  Polton ceased pumping he detached the receiver, and laid it on a sheet  of paper, on which he wrote in pencil, \"Outside,\" and covered it with a  small bell-glass. A fresh receiver having been fitted on, the nozzle was  now drawn over the silk lining of the hat, and then through the space  behind the leather head-lining on one side; and now the dust that  collected in the receiver was much of the usual grey colour and fluffy  texture, and included two more hairs.    \"And now,\" said Thorndyke, when the second receiver had been detached  and set aside, \"we want a mould of the inside of the hat, and we must  make it by the quickest method; there is no time to make a paper mould.  It is a most astonishing head,\" he added, reaching down from a nail a  pair of large callipers, which he applied to the inside of the hat; \"six  inches and nine-tenths long by six and six-tenths broad, which gives  us\"--he made a rapid calculation on a scrap of paper--\"the  extraordinarily high cephalic index of 95.6.\"    Polton now took possession of the hat, and, having stuck a band of wet  tissue-paper round the inside, mixed a small bowl of plaster-of-Paris,  and very dexterously ran a stream of the thick liquid on to the  tissue-paper, where it quickly solidified. A second and third  application resulted in a broad ring of solid plaster an inch thick,  forming a perfect mould of the inside of the hat, and in a few minutes  the slight contraction of the plaster in setting rendered the mould  sufficiently loose to allow of its being slipped out on to a board to  dry.    We were none too soon, for even as Polton was removing the mould, the  electric bell, which I had switched on to the laboratory, announced a  visitor, and when I went down I found a police-sergeant waiting with a  note from Superintendent Miller, requesting the immediate"]]]
