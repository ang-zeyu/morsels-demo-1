The first act of _Orfeo_ ends in a tumultuous effect of the stringed  instruments which was evidently intended to indicate a change of scene  and the appearance of the stage settings of the infernal regions. This  passage does not appear in the French _Orphee_ and it is lacking in the  engraved score, where it is replaced by a bravura aria of doubtful  taste, accompanied by a single quartet. Whether the stage managers  wanted an entr'acte or the tenor, Legros, demanded an effective aria, or  for both these reasons, a reading of the manuscript indicates how  absolutely the author's meaning was changed. There is no doubt that  except for some such reason he would have changed this aria and put it  in harmony with the rest of the work.    For a long time this aria was attributed to Bertoni, the composer, and  Gluck was accused of plagiarizing it. As a matter of fact, and to the  contrary, this aria came from an older Italian opera of Gluck's. Bertoni  not only imitated it in one of his scores, but he had the hardihood to  write an _Orfeo_ on the text already followed by Gluck in which he  plagiarized the work of his illustrious predecessor in a scandalous  fashion.    This same aria, changed with real genius and performed with prodigious  eclat by Madame Viardot, and re-orchestrated by myself, was one of the  strongest reasons for the success of the famous performances at the  Theatre-Lyrique. But it is well understood that it could not properly  find a place in an edition where the sole end was artistic sincerity and  purity of the text.    From this point of view it would seem that the best manner of giving  _Orphee_ would be to conform to the author's definitive version. A tenor  would have to take the part of Orpheus, since we no longer have male  contraltos, and to keep to this kind of a voice in _Orphee_ we would  have to have recourse to what is called, in theatrical terms, a  _travesti_. There are obstacles to this, however. The pitch has changed  since the Eighteenth Century; it has gone up and it is now impossible,  or nearly so, to sing the role written for Legros. The contraltos of the  Italian chorus have become the counter-tenors, who, for the same reason,  find themselves struggling with too sharp notes.    In the Seventeenth Century the French pitch was even more flat, and it  is a great pity, for it is almost impossible to perform our old music,  on account of the insuperable obstacles. This is not the case in  Germany, however, or in Italy, and that is the reason why the works of  Sebastian Bach and Mozart can be sung. The same is true of Gluck's  Italian works.    This was the reason that Doret gave the part of Orpheus to a contralto,  just as is done at the Opera-Comique. The poetic character of the part  of Orpheus lends itself excellently to such a feminine interpretation.  But in resuming the key of the Italian score, it is necessary to go  back, at least to a considerable degree, to the instrumentation. By a  curious anomaly the beautiful recitative, accompanied by the murmur of  brooks and the songs of the birds, is in C major in both scores. The  author could not have changed them. On the contrary he modified his  instrumentation greatly, simplified and perfected it.    We know that the authors, in utter defiance of mythology, wanted a happy  ending and so brought Eurydice back to life a second time. Love  accomplished this miracle and the work ended with the song \"Love  Triumphs,\" which is exceedingly joyful and in harmony with the  situation. They did not want this ending, which was in _Orfeo_ and which  Gluck retained in _Orphee_, at the old Theatre-Lyrique and the  Opera-Comique, and they replaced it with a chorus by Echo and Narcissus.  This chorus is charming, but that does not excuse it. Joy was what the  author wanted and this does not give joy at all. Gluck's finale is  regarded as not sufficiently distinguished, but this is wrong. The real  finale was sung at Mezieres and it was found that it was not at all  common, but that its frank gaiety was in the best of taste.    Gluck had no scruples about grinding several grists from the same sack  and drawing from his old works to help out his new ones. So the  parasitical aria attributed to Bertoni was written by Gluck in the first  place in 1764 for a soprano. He wove this into his opera _Aristo_ in  1769. This is also true of the trio, _Tendre Amour_, which precedes the  finale in the last act. A serious-minded analyst might be tempted to  admire the profound psychology of the author in mingling doleful accents  with expressions of joy, but he would have his labor for his pains. The  trio was taken from the opera _Elena e Paride_, where Gluck expressed  strongly wrought up emotions. Doret did not keep these two passages and  one can't blame him. On the other hand, he retained, by making it an  entr'acte, the _Ballet des Furies_. This was taken from a ballet, _Don  Giovanni o il convitato de pietra_, which was performed at Vienna in  1761. This passage was used as the accompaniment to Don Juan's descent  into Hell, surrounded by his band of demons.    Many of Gluck's compatriots came to Mezieres to see _Orphee_ and they  were loyal enough to recognize the superiority of the performance. Some  even had the courage to say, \"We murder Gluck in Germany.\"    I discovered that fact a long time ago. In my youth I was indignant when  I saw Paris, where Gluck wrote his finest works, quite neglecting them,  whereas Germany continued to promote them. In those days I was  frequently called to the other side of the Rhine to play in concerts,  and I watched for a chance to see one of these masterpieces which had  been forgotten in France. So it was with the liveliest joy that one day  I entered one of the leading German theaters where they were giving  _Armide_. What a hollow mockery it was!    Madame Malten was Armide, and she was everything that could be wished in  voice, talent, style, beauty and charm. She spoke French without an  accent and was as remarkable as an actress as a singer, so she would  without doubt have had great success at the Opera in Paris. She was  Armide herself, an irresistible enchantress.    But the rest! Renaud was a raw boy, and his shaven chin brought out in  sharp relief enormous black moustaches with long waxed ends. He had a  voice, to be sure, but no style, and no understanding of the work he was  trying to interpret.    Hidradot is an old sorcerer tempered in the fires of Hell. He enters,  saying:        \"I see hard by Death that threatens me,      And already old age, that has chilled my blood,      Is on me, bowing me beneath a crushing burden.\"    Imagine my surprise at seeing come on the stage a magnificent specimen  of manhood, with a curled black beard, in all the glory of his youth and  vigor superbly arrayed in a red cloak trimmed with gold!    The stage setting was also extraordinary. In the second act Renaud went  to sleep at the back of the stage, forcing Armide to speak the whole of  the beautiful scene which follows, one of the most important in the  part, at a distance from the footlights and with her back to the  audience.    As for the orchestra, sometimes it followed Gluck's text and sometimes  it borrowed bits of orchestration which Meyerbeer had written for the  Opera at Berlin. This orchestration is interesting, and I know it well  for I have had it in hand. It is only fair to say that Gluck, from some  inexplicable caprice, did not give the same care to the instrumentation  of _Armide_ that he did to _Orphee_, _Alcesti_, and the _Iphigenies_.  The trombones do not appear at all and the drums and flutes only at rare  intervals. Re-orchestration is not absolutely necessary and Meyerbeer's  is no more reprehensible than those with which Mozart enriched Handel's  _Messe_ and _La Fete d'Alexandre_. What was inadmissible was not  deciding frankly for one version or the other. It was like a badly  patched coat which shows the old cloth in one place and the new in  another.    Afterwards I saw _Armide_ treated in another way.    Did you ever happen to cherish the memory of a delightful and  picturesque city, where everything made a harmonious whole, where the  beautiful walks were arched over by old trees--and later come back to it  to find it embellished, the trees cut down, the walks replaced by  enormous buildings which dwarfed into insignificance the ancient marvels  which gave the city its charm?    This was the case with me when I saw _Armide_ again in a city which I  shall not name. The opera had been judged superannuated and had been  \"improved.\" A young composer had written a new score in which he  inserted here and there such bits of Gluck as he thought worthy of being  preserved. A costly and magnificently imbecile luxuriousness set off the  whole piece. I may be pardoned the cruel adjective when I say that in  the scene of Hate, so deeply inspired, and which takes place in a sort  of cave, they relegated the chorus to the wings to make a place for  dragons, fantastic birds beating their wings, and other deviltries.  This, of course, deprived the chorus of all its power and distinction.    But the best was at the end of the second act. The forest with its  trees, grass and rocks entirely disappeared in the flies taking Renaud  and Armide with it and the spectator was left, for some unknown reason,  looking at a background surrounded by mountains. Then, by a marvel of  mechanism, there appeared to the sound of ultramodern music, Renaud  sleeping on a bed of state, with Armide standing at the foot and  stretching forth her hand with a gesture of authority, declaiming in a  solemn tone,         \"Rinaldo, I love you!\"    and the curtain fell to the applause of the audience.           *       *       *       *       *    We owe much to Germany in music, for it has produced"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16462"],[0,"With the Boer Forces (#18)"],[1,"drift.  The few tents fell, and men in brown uniforms moved hither and thither  near the waterworks building. Waggon after waggon joined in the  procession; drivers were shrieking and wielding their whips over the heads  of the oxen, and farther behind were cavalrymen mounting their horses. It  was daylight then, although the sun was still below the horizon, and the  movements of the enemy could be plainly discerned. The ox-teams came  slowly down the road--there seemed to be no limit to their number--and the  generals retreated down the drift to the bottom of the spruit, so that  their presence should not be discerned by the enemy, and to await the  arrival of the waggons.    The shrieking natives drew nearer, the rumbling of the waggons became more  distinct, and soon the first vehicle descended the drift. A few burghers  were sent forward to intercept it. As soon as it reached the bottom of the  spruit the men grasped the bridles of the horses, and instantly there were  shrieks from the occupants of the vehicle. It was filled with women and  children, all pale with fright on account of the unexpected appearance of  the Boers. The passengers were quickly and gently taken from the waggon  and sent to places of safety in the spruit, while a burgher jumped into  the vehicle and drove the horses up the other drift and out upon the open  veld. The operation of substituting drivers was done so quickly and  quietly that none of those approaching the drift from the other side  noticed anything extraordinary, and proceeded into the spruit. Other  burghers stood prepared to receive them as they descended the drift with  their heavily laden ammunition and provision waggons, and there was little  trouble in seizing the British drivers and placing the whips into the  hands of Boers. Waggon after waggon was relieved of its drivers and sent  up to the other bank without creating a suspicion in the minds of the  others who were coming down the slope from the waterworks.    After fifty or more waggons had crossed the drift a solitary cavalry  officer with the rank of captain, riding leisurely along, followed one of  them. His coat had a rent in it and he was holding the torn parts  together, as if he were planning the mending of it when he reached  Bloemfontein. A young Boer sprang toward him, called \"Hands up!\" and  projected the barrel of his carbine toward him. The officer started out of  his reverie, involuntarily reached for his sword, but repented almost  instantly, and obeyed the order. General De Wet approached the captain,  touched his hat in salute, and said, \"Good morning, sir.\" The officer  returned the complimentary greeting and offered his sword to the Boer. De  Wet declined to receive the weapon and told the officer to return to his  men and ask them to surrender. \"We have a large force of men surrounding  you,\" the general explained, \"and you cannot escape. In order to save many  lives I ask you to surrender your men without fighting.\" The officer  remained silent for a moment, then looked squarely into the eyes of the  Boer general and said, \"I will return to my men and will order them to  surrender.\" De Wet nodded his head in assent, and the captain mounted his  horse. \"I will rely upon your promise,\" the general added, \"if you break  it I will shoot you.\"    General De Wet and several of his commandants followed the cavalry officer  up the drift and stood on the bank while the horseman galloped slowly  toward the troops which were following the waggons down the slope. The  general raised his carbine and held it in his arms. His eyes were fixed on  the officer, and he stood as firm as a statue until the cavalryman reached  his men. There was a momentary pause while the captain stood before his  troops, then the horses were wheeled about and their hoofs sent showers of  dust into the air as they carried their riders in retreat. General De Wet  stepped forward several paces, raised his carbine to his shoulder, aimed  steadily for a second, then fired. The bullet whistled menacingly over the  heads of oxen and drivers--it struck the officer, and he fell.[1]        [1] This incident of the battle was witnessed by the writer, as well      as by several of the foreign military attaches. Whether the British      officer broke his promise by asking his men to retreat or whether his      troopers were disobedient is a question, but it is more than likely      that he endeavoured to act in good faith. Whether the officer was      killed or only wounded by General De Wet's shot could not be      ascertained.    All along the banks of the spruit, for a mile on either side of the  ravine, and over on the hills where Peter De Wet and his burghers lay, men  had been waiting patiently and expectantly for that signal gun of  Christian De Wet. They had been watching the enemy toiling down the slope  under the very muzzles of their guns for almost an age, it seemed, yet  they dared not fire lest the plans of the generals should be thwarted. Men  had lain flat on the ground with their rifles pointing minute after minute  at individuals in the advancing column, but the words of their general, \"I  will fire the first shot,\" restrained them. The flight of the bullet which  entered the body of the cavalry officer marked the ending of the long  period of nervous tension, and the burghers were free to use their guns.    [Illustration: THE AUTHOR, AND A BASUTO PONY WHICH ASSISTED IN THE FIGHT  AT SANNASPOST]    Until the officer advised his men to retreat and he himself fell from his  horse the main body of the British troops was ignorant of the presence of  the Boers, but the report of the rifle was a summons to battle and  instantly the field was filled with myriads of stirring scenes. The lazy  transport-train suddenly became a thing of rapid motion; the huge body of  troops was quickly broken into many parts; horses that had been idling  along the road plunged forward as if projected by catapults. Officers with  swords flashing in the sunlight appeared leading their men into different  positions, cannon were hurriedly drawn upon commanding elevations, and Red  Cross waggons scattered to places of safety. The peaceful transport-train  had suddenly been transformed into a formidable engine of war by the  report of a rifle, and the contest for a sentiment and a bit of ground was  opened by shrieking cannon-shell and the piercing cry of rifle-ball.    Down at the foot of the slope, where the drift crossed the spruit, Boers  were dragging cannon into position, and in among the waggons which had  become congested in the road, burghers and soldiers were engaging in  fierce hand-to-hand encounters. A stocky Briton wrestled with a youthful  Boer, and in the struggle both fell to the ground; near by a cavalryman  was firing his revolver at a Boer armed with a rifle, and a hundred paces  away a burgher was fighting with a British officer for the possession of a  sword. Over from the hills in the south came the dull roar of Boer cannon,  followed by the reports of the shells exploding in the east near the  waterworks. British cannon opened fire from a position near the white  smoke-stack and scores of bursting projectiles fell among the waggons at  the spruit. Oxen and horses were rent limb from limb, waggons tumbled over  on their sides; boxes of provisions were thrown in all directions, and out  of the cloud of dust and smoke stumbled men with blood-stained faces and  lacerated bodies. Terrified and bellowing oxen twisted and tugged at their  yokes; horses broke from their fastenings in the waggons and dashed hither  and thither, and weakling donkeys strove in vain to free themselves from  waggons set on fire by the shells. Explosion followed explosion, and with  every one the mass became more entangled. Dead horses fell upon living  oxen; wheels and axles were thrown on the backs of donkeys, and plunging  mules dragged heavy waggons over great piles of _debris_.    The cannon on the southern hills became more active and their shells  caused the landscape surrounding the waterworks to be filled with geysers  of dust. Troops which were stationed near the white smoke-stack suddenly  spurred their horses forward and dashed northward to seek safety behind a  long undulation in the ground. The artillerymen in the hills followed  their movements with shells, and the dust-fountains sprang up at the very  heels of the troops. The cannon at the drift joined in the attack on the  horsemen scattered over the slope, and the big guns at the waterworks  continued to reply vigorously. The men in the spruit were watching the  artillery duel intently as they sped up and down the bottom of the  water-less stream, searching for points of vantage. A large number of them  moved rapidly down the spruit towards its confluence with the Modder River  in order to check the advance of the troops driven forward by the  shell-fire, and another party rushed eastward to secure positions in the  rear of the British cannon at the waterworks. The banks of the stream  still concealed them, but they dared not fire lest the enemy should  disturb their plans. On and on they dashed, over rocks and chasms, until  they were within a few hundred yards of a part of the British force.  Slowly they crept up the sides of the spruit, cautiously peered out over  the edge of the bank and then opened fire on the men at the cannon and the  troops passing down the slope. Little jets of dust arose where their  bullets struck the ground, men fell around the cannon, and cavalrymen  quickly turned and charged toward the spruit. The shells of the cannon at  the drift and on the southern hills fell thicker and thicker among the  troops and the air above them was heavy with the light blue smoke of  bursting shrapnel. The patter of the Boer rifles at the spruit increased  in intensity and the jets of brown dust became more numerous. The  cavalrymen leaped from their horses and ran ahead to"]]]
