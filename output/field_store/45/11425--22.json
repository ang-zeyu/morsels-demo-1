See, death is  the portion of all our race! Call hither our children and our  children's children, and tell them the manner of our sinning.\"  And while Adam lay prostrate upon the bed of pain, Eve told them  the story of their fall.[115]      EVE'S STORY OF THE FALL    After I was created, God divided Paradise and all the animals  therein between Adam and me. The east and the north were assigned  to Adam, together with the male animals. I was mistress of the  west and the south and all the female animals. Satan, smarting  under the disgrace of having been dismissed from the heavenly  host, resolved to bring about our ruin and avenge himself upon  the cause of his discomfiture. He won the serpent over to his  side, and pointed out to him that before the creation of Adam the  animals could enjoy all that grew in Paradise, and now they were  restricted to the weeds. To drive Adam from Paradise would  therefore be for the good of all. The serpent demurred, for he  stood in awe of the wrath of God. But Satan calmed his fears, and  said, \"Do thou but become my vessel,[117] and I shall speak a  word through thy mouth wherewith thou wilt succeed in seducing  man.\"    The serpent thereupon suspended himself from the wall surrounding  Paradise, to carry on his conversation with me from without. And  this happened at the very moment when my two guardian angels had  betaken themselves to heaven to supplicate the Lord. I was quite  alone therefore, and when Satan assumed the appearance of an  angel, bent over the wall of Paradise, and intoned seraphic songs  of praise, I was deceived, and thought him an angel. A  conversation was held between us, Satan speaking through the  mouth of the serpent:    \"Art thou Eve?\"    \"Yes, it is I.\"    \"What art thou doing in Paradise?\"    \"The Lord has put us here to cultivate it and eat of its fruits.\"    \"That is good. Yet you eat not of all the trees.\"    \"That we do, excepting a single one, the tree that stands in the  midst of Paradise. Concerning it alone, God has forbidden us to  eat of it, else, the Lord said, ye will die.\"    The serpent made every effort to persuade me that I had naught to  fear--that God knew that in the day that Adam and I ate of the  fruit of the tree, we should be as He Himself. It was jealousy  that had made Him say,[118] \"Ye shall not eat of it.\" In spite of  all his urging, I remained steadfast and refused to touch the  tree. Then the serpent engaged to pluck the fruit for me.  Thereupon I opened the gate of Paradise, and he slipped in.  Scarcely was he within, when he said to me, \"I repent of my  words, I would rather not give thee of the fruit of the forbidden  tree.\" It was but a cunning device to tempt me more. He consented  to give me of the fruit only after I swore to make my husband eat  of it, too. This is the oath he made me take: \"By the throne of  God, by the cherubim, and by the tree of life, I shall give my  husband of this fruit, that he may eat, too.\" Thereupon the  serpent ascended the tree and injected his poison, the poison of  the evil inclination, into the fruit,[119] and bent the branch on  which it grew to the ground. I took hold of it, but I knew at  once that I was stripped of the righteousness in which I had been  clothed.[120] I began to weep, because of it and because of the  oath the serpent had forced from me.    The serpent disappeared from the tree, while I sought leaves  wherewith to cover my nakedness, but all the trees within my  reach had cast off their leaves at the moment when I ate of the  forbidden fruit.[121] There was only one that retained its  leaves, the fig-tree, the very tree the fruit of which had been  forbidden to me.[122] I summoned Adam, and by means of  blasphemous words I prevailed upon him to eat of the fruit. As  soon as it had passed his lips, he knew his true condition, and  he exclaimed against me: \"Thou wicked woman, what bast thou  brought down upon me? Thou hast removed me from the glory of  God.\"    At the same time Adam and I heard the archangel Michael[123] blow  his trumpet, and all the angels cried out: \"Thus saith the Lord,  Come ye with Me to Paradise and hearken unto the sentence which I  will pronounce upon Adam.\"[124]    We hid ourselves because we feared the judgment of God. Sitting  in his chariot drawn by cherubim, the Lord, accompanied by angels  uttering His praise, appeared in Paradise. At His coming the bare  trees again put forth leaves.[125] His throne was erected by the  tree of life, and God addressed Adam: \"Adam, where dost thou keep  thyself in hiding? Thinkest thou I cannot find thee? Can a house  conceal itself from its architect?\"[126]    Adam tried to put the blame on me, who had promised to hold him  harmless before God. And I in turn accused the serpent. But God  dealt out justice to all three of us. To Adam He said: \"Because  thou didst not obey My commands, but didst hearken unto the voice  of thy wife, cursed is the ground in spite of thy work. When thou  dost cultivate it, it will not yield thee its strength. Thorns  and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and in the sweat of  thy face shalt thou eat bread. Thou wilt suffer many a hardship,  thou wilt grow weary, and yet find no rest. Bitterly oppressed,  thou shalt never taste of any sweetness. Thou shalt be scourged  by heat, and yet pinched by cold. Thou shalt toil greatly, and  yet not gain wealth. Thou shalt grow fat, and yet cease to live.  And the animals over which thou art the master will rise up  against thee, because thou didst not keep my command.\"[127]    Upon me God pronounced this sentence: \"Thou shalt suffer anguish  in childbirth and grievous torture. In sorrow shalt thou bring  forth children, and in the hour of travail, when thou art near to  lose thy life, thou wilt confess and cry, 'Lord, Lord, save me  this time, and I will never again indulge in carnal pleasure,'  and yet thy desire shall ever and ever be unto thy husband.\"[128]    At the same time all sorts of diseases were decreed upon us. God  said to Adam: \"Because thou didst turn aside from My covenant, I  will inflict seventy plagues upon thy flesh. The pain of the  first plague shall lay hold on thy eyes; the pain of the second  plague upon thy hearing, and one after the other all the plagues  shall come upon thee.\"[129] The serpent God addressed thus:  \"Because thou becamest the vessel of the Evil One,[130] deceiving  the innocent, cursed art thou above all cattle and above every  beast of the field. Thou shalt be robbed of the food thou wast  wont to eat, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.  Upon thy breast and thy belly shalt thou go, and of thy hands and  thy feet thou shalt be deprived. Thou shalt not remain in  possession of thy ears, nor of thy wings, nor of any of thy limbs  wherewith thou didst seduce the woman and her husband, bringing  them to such a pass that they must be driven forth from Paradise.  And I will put enmity between thee and the seed of man. It shall  bruise thy head, and, thou shalt bruise his heel until the day of  judgment.\"[131]      THE DEATH OF ADAM    On the last day of Adam's life, Eve said to him, \"Why should I go  on living, when thou art no more? How long shall I have to linger  on after thy death? Tell me this!\" Adam assured her she would not  tarry long. They would die together, and be buried together in  the same place. He commanded her not to touch his corpse until an  angel from God had made provision regarding it, and she was to  begin at once to pray to God until his soul escaped from his  body.    While Eve was on her knees in prayer, an angel came,[132] and  bade her rise. \"Eve, arise from thy penance,\" he commanded.  \"Behold, thy husband hath left his mortal coil. Arise, and see  his spirit go up to his Creator, to appear before Him.\" And, lo,  she beheld a chariot of light, drawn by four shining eagles, and  preceded by angels. In this chariot lay the soul of Adam, which  the angels were taking to heaven. Arrived there, they burnt  incense until the clouds of smoke enveloped the heavens. Then  they prayed to God to have mercy upon His image and the work of  His holy hands. In her awe and fright, Eve summoned Seth, and she  bade him look upon the vision and explain the celestial sights  beyond her understanding. She asked, \"Who may the two Ethiopians  be, who are adding their prayers to thy father's?\" Seth told her,  they were the sun and the moon, turned so black because they  could not shine in the face of the Father of light.[133] Scarcely  had he spoken, when an angel blew a trumpet, and all the angels  cried out with awful voices, \"Blessed be the glory of the Lord by  His creatures, for He has shown mercy unto Adam, the work of His  hands!\" A seraph then seized Adam, and carried him off to the  river Acheron, washed him three times, and brought him before the  presence of God, who sat upon His throne, and, stretching out His  hand, lifted Adam up and gave him over to the archangel Michael,  with the words, \"Raise him to the Paradise of the third heaven,  and there thou shalt leave him until the great and fearful day  ordained by Me.\" Michael executed the Divine behest, and all the  angels sang a song of praise, extolling God for the pardon He had  accorded Adam.    Michael now entreated God to let him attend to the preparation of  Adam's body for the grave. Permission being given, Michael  repaired to earth, accompanied by all the angels. When they  entered the terrestrial Paradise, all the trees blossomed forth,  and the perfume wafted thence lulled all men into slumber except  Seth alone. Then God said to Adam, as his body lay on the ground:  \"If thou hadst kept My commandment, they would not rejoice who  brought thee hither. But I tell thee, I will turn the joy of  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1494"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 2 (#18)"],[1,"sake of their brother  Benjamin, so Mordecai, the descendant of Benjamin, was  destined to rend his on account of his brethren, the people of  Israel. But because mortification was inflicted upon the  brethren through Manasseh, the steward of Joseph, the  allotment of territory given to the tribe of Manasseh was  \"torn\" in two, one-half of the tribe had to live on one side  of the Jordan, the other half on the other side. And Joseph,  who had not shrunk from vexing his brethren so bitterly  that they rent their clothes in their abasement, was punished,  in that his descendant Joshua was driven to such despair  after the defeat of Ai that he, too, rent his clothes.[257]    Convicted of theft beyond the peradventure of a doubt,  the brethren of Joseph had no choice but to comply with the  steward's command and return to the city. They accompanied  him without delay. Each of them loaded his ass himself, raising  the burden with one hand from the ground to  the back of the beast, and then they retraced their steps  cityward,[258] and as they walked, they rapped Benjamin roughly  on the shoulder, saying, \"O thou thief and son of a thief,  thou hast brought the same shame upon us that thy mother  brought upon our father.\" Benjamin bore the blows and the  abusive words in patient silence, and he was rewarded for  his humility. For submitting to the blows upon his shoulder,  God appointed that His Shekinah should \"dwell between  his shoulders,\" and He also called him \"the beloved of the  Lord.\"[259]    Joseph's brethren returned to the city without fear.  Though it was a great metropolis, in their eyes it appeared  but as a hamlet of ten persons, which they could wipe out  with a turn of the hand.[260] They were led into the presence  of Joseph, who, contrary to his usual habit, was not holding  a session of the court in the forum on that day. He remained  at home, that his brethren might not be exposed to  shame in public. They fell to the earth before him, and  thus came true his dream of the eleven stars that made  obeisance to him.[261] But even while paying homage to Joseph,  Judah was boiling inwardly with suppressed rage, and  he said to his brethren, \"Verily, this man hath forced me to  come back hither only that I should destroy the city on this  day.\"    Guarded by his valiant men on the right and on the left,  Joseph addressed his brethren, snarling, \"What deed is this  that ye have done, to steal away my cup? I know well, ye  took it in order to discover with its help the whereabouts of  your brother that hath disappeared.\"[262] Judah was spokesman,  and he replied: \"What shall we say unto my lord  concerning the first money that he found in the mouth of  our sacks? What shall we speak concerning the second  money that also was in our sacks? And how shall we  clear ourselves concerning the cup? We cannot acknowledge  ourselves guilty, for we know ourselves to be innocent  in all these matters. Yet we cannot avow ourselves innocent,  because God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants,  like a creditor that goes about and tries to collect a  debt owing to him.[263] Two brothers take care not to enter  a house of mirth and festivity together, that they be not  exposed to the evil eye, but we all were caught together in  one place, by reason of the sin which we committed in  company.\"    Joseph: \"But if your punishment is for selling Joseph,  why should this brother of yours suffer, the youngest, he  that had no part in your crime.    Judah: \"A thief and his companions are taken together.\"    Joseph: \"If you could prevail upon yourselves to report  to your father concerning a brother that had not stolen, and  had brought no manner of shame upon you, that a wild  beast had torn him, you will easily persuade yourselves to  say it concerning a brother that hath stolen, and hath  brought shame upon you. Go hence, and tell your father,  'The rope follows after the water bucket.'[264] But,\" continued  Joseph, shaking his purple mantle, \"God forbid that  I should accuse you all of theft. Only the youth that stole  the cup in order to divine his brother's whereabouts shall  remain with me as my bondman; but as for you, get you up  in peace unto your father.\"    The holy spirit called out, \"Great peace have they which  love thy law!\"    The brethren all consented to yield Benjamin to the ruler  of Egypt, only Judah demurred, and he cried out, \"Now it  is all over with peace!\" and he prepared to use force, if  need be, to rescue Benjamin from slavery.[265]      JUDAH PLEADS AND THREATENS.    Joseph dismissed his brethren, and carried Benjamin off  by main force, and locked him up in a chamber. But Judah  broke the door open and stood before Joseph with his  brethren.[266] He determined to use in turn the three means of  liberating Benjamin at his disposal. He was prepared to  convince Joseph by argument, or move him by entreaties, or  resort to force, in order to accomplish his end.[267]    He spake: \"Thou doest a wrong unto us. Thou who  didst say, 'I fear God,' thou showest thyself to be like unto  Pharaoh, who hath no fear of God. The judgments which  thou dost pronounce are not in accordance with our laws, nor  are they in accordance with the laws of the nations. According  to our law, a thief must pay double the value of what he  hath stolen. Only, if he hath no money, he is sold into slavery,  but if he hath the money, he maketh double restitution.  And according to the law of the nations, the thief is deprived  of all he owns. Do so, but let him go free. If a man buys  a slave, and then discovers him to be a thief, the transaction  is void. Yet thou desirest to make one a slave whom thou  chargest with being a thief. I suspect thee of wanting to  keep him in thy power for illicit purposes,[268] and in this  lustfulness thou resemblest Pharaoh. Also thou art like Pharaoh  in that thou makest a promise and keepest it not. Thou  saidst unto thy servants, Bring thy youngest brother down  unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. Dost thou call  this setting thine eyes upon him?[269] If thou didst desire  nothing beside a slave, then wouldst thou surely accept our  offer to serve thee as bondmen instead of Benjamin. Reuben  is older than he, and I exceed him in strength. It cannot  but be as I say, thou hast a lustful purpose in mind with  our brother.[270]    \"Therefore let these words of mine which I am about to  speak find entrance into thy heart: For the sake of the  grandmother of this lad were Pharaoh and his house  stricken with sore plagues, because he detained her in his  palace a single night against her will. His mother died a  premature death, by reason of a curse which his father uttered  in inconsiderate haste. Take heed, then, that this man's  curse strike thee not and slay thee. Two of us destroyed the  whole of a city on account of one woman, how much more  would we do it for the sake of a man, and that man the  beloved of the Lord, in whose allotment it is appointed that  God shall dwell!    \"If I but utter a sound, death-dealing pestilence will  stalk through the land as far as No. In this land Pharaoh  is the first, and thou art the second after him, but in our  land my father is the first, and I am the second. If thou  wilt not comply with our demand, I will draw my sword,  and hew thee down first, and then Pharaoh.\"    When Judah gave utterance to this threat, Joseph made a  sign, and Manasseh stamped his foot on the ground so that  the whole palace shook. Judah said, \"Only one belonging to  our family can stamp thus!\" and intimidated by this display  of great strength, he moderated his tone and manner.  \"From the very beginning,\" he continued to speak, \"thou  didst resort to all sorts of pretexts in order to embarrass us.  The inhabitants of many countries came down into Egypt to  buy corn, but none of them didst thou ask questions about  their family relations. In sooth, we did not come hither to  seek thy daughter in marriage, or peradventure thou desirest  an alliance with our sister? Nevertheless we gave  thee an answer unto all thy questions.\"    Joseph replied: \"Verily, thou canst talk glibly! Is there  another babbler like thee among thy brethren?[271] Why dost  thou speak so much, while thy brethren that are older than  thou, Reuben, Simon, and Levi, stand by silent?\"    Judah: \"None of my brethren has so much at stake as I  have, if Benjamin returns not to his father. I was a surety  to my father for him, saying, If I bring him not unto thee,  and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame forever,  in this world and in the world to come.[272]    The other brethren withheld themselves intentionally from  taking part in the dispute between Judah and Joseph, saying,  \"Kings are carrying on a dispute, and it is not seemly for  us to interfere between them.\"[273] Even the angels descended  from heaven to earth to be spectators of the combat between  Joseph the bull and Judah the lion, and they said, \"It lies  in the natural course of things that the bull should fear the  lion, but here the two are engaged in equal, furious combat.\"    In reply to Judah, when he explained that his great interest  in Benjamin's safety was due to the pledge he had  given to his father, Joseph spoke: \"Why wast thou not a  surety for thy other brother, when ye sold him for twenty  pieces of silver? Then thou didst not regard the sorrow  thou wast inflicting upon thy father, but thou didst say, A  wild beast hath devoured Joseph. And yet Joseph had done  no evil, while this Benjamin has committed theft. Therefore,  go up and say unto thy father, The rope hath followed  after the water bucket.\"    These words had such an effect upon Judah that he broke  out in sobs, and cried aloud, \"How shall I go up to my  father, and the lad be not with me?\"[274] His outcry reached  to a distance of four hundred parasangs, and when Hushim  the son of Dan heard it in Canaan, he jumped into Egypt  with a single"]]]
