He's very ill--had a stroke  yesterday, and the doctor declares his condition critical. His nephew,  Shiel, so Anne says, has been sent for, and arrived at Sydenham last  night! If that's not bad news I don't know what is!\" John Martin said,  thrusting his plate away from him and leaning back in his chair. \"It's  true I can manage the business all right myself--and there's the  possibility, of course, that this young Shiel may shape all right. I  suppose if anything happens he will step into Dick's shoes. I've never  heard Dick mention any one else. Poor old Dick!\"    \"I am so sorry, father!\" Gladys said, laying her hand on his. \"But  cheer up! It may not be as bad as you expect. Shall you go and see how  he is?\"    \"I think so, my dear! I think so,\" John Martin replied, \"but don't  worry me about it now. Talk to your aunt and leave me out of it, I'm a  bit upset. My brain's in a regular whirl!\"    Undoubtedly the news was something in the nature of a blow: for Dick  Davenport, apart from being John Martin's partner--partner in the firm  of Martin and Davenport, the world-renowned conjurors, whose hall in  the Kingsway was one of the chief amusement places in London, was John  Martin's oldest friend. They had been chums at Cheltenham College, had  entered the Army and gone to India together, had quitted the Service  together, and, on returning together to England, had started their  conjuring business, first of all in Sloane Street, and subsequently in  the Kingsway. From the very start their enterprise had met with  success, and, had it not been for Davenport's wild extravagance, they  would have been little short of millionaires. But Davenport, though a  most lovable character in every respect, could not keep money--he no  sooner had it than it was gone. His house in Sydenham was little short  of a palace; whilst, it was said, he almost rivalled royalty, in  magnificent display, whenever he entertained. The result of all this  reckless expenditure was no uncommon one--he ran through considerably  more than he earned and--as there was no one else to help him--he  invariably came down on John Martin. It was \"Jack, old boy, I'm damned  sorry, but I must have another thousand;\" or, \"Jack! these infernal  scamps of creditors are worrying the life out of me, can you, will  you, lend me a trifle--a couple of thousand will do it\"--and so on--so  on, ad infinitum. John Martin never refused, and at the time of  Davenport's illness, the latter owed him something like a hundred  thousand pounds.    Fortunately John Martin, though far from parsimonious, was careful. He  had an excellent business head, and, thanks to his sagacious share in  the management, the business remained solvent. He knew Davenport's  capacity--that nowhere could he have found another such a brilliant  genius in conjuring--nor, apart from his thriftlessness, any one so  thoroughly reliable. In Davenport's keeping all the great tricks they  had invented--and great tricks they undoubtedly were--were absolutely  safe.    Despite the fact that they had repeatedly offered big sums of money to  any one who could discover the secret of how they were done, every  attempt to do so had utterly failed. The Mysteries of Martin and  Davenport's Home of Wonder, in the Kingsway, baffled the world. Of  course one thing had helped them enormously--namely, they had no  rivals. So colossal was their reputation, that no one else had ever  even thought of setting up in opposition.    And now one of the two great master-minds, that had accomplished all  these marvels and acquired such universal fame, was stricken down,  checkmated by the still greater power of nature; and his  colleague--the only other man in existence who shared his  knowledge--was obliged to rack his brain as to what was now to be  done--done for the continuance and prosperity of the firm.    After finishing her breakfast Gladys joined her aunt in the garden.    \"To dream of flowers and trees evidently means bad news,\" she said.  \"But as I feel in a mood for a walk, I shall call at the Vicarage.\"    \"What, now! At this hour!\" Miss Templeton cried aghast.    \"Why not?\" Gladys said imperturbably. \"I'm not going to pay a call.  They haven't called on us. I shall say I've merely come to make an  inquiry. Can she tell me of any one who interprets dreams? Come with  me!\"    But as her aunt pleaded an excuse, Gladys went alone.    The Vicar was in the garden in his shirt sleeves, and though obviously  surprised to see Gladys, seemed quite prepared to enter into  conversation with her. But Gladys was not enamoured of clergymen. Her  ways were not their ways, and she had come strictly on business.  Consequently she somewhat curtly demanded to be conducted into the  presence of his wife, who received her very affably.    \"Why, how very strange,\" she observed when Gladys had stated the  object of her visit. \"I was asked a similar question only yesterday. A  Miss Rosenberg, who is staying with us, had an extraordinary dream  about trees and flowers--only it took the form of a poem, which she  awoke repeating. There were several verses--quite doggerel it is  true--but nevertheless rather remarkable for a dream. She wrote them  down, and asked me if I could tell her whether there was any hidden  meaning in them. Here they are,\" and she handed Gladys two pages of  sermon paper on which was written--        \"In the greenest of green valleys,      Aglow with summer sun,      Lived a maiden fair and radiant,      More radiant there was none.        \"The flowers gave her their friendship;      Her couch was on the ground.      A happier, gayer maiden,      Was nowhere to be found.        \"The air was filled with music      Sung by the babbling brook.      Sweet lullabies with chorus clear      In which the flowers partook.        \"This maiden knew not sorrow,      Until an evil day;      When riding lone across the moors,      A hunter lost his way.        \"And chancing on this valley,      He met the maiden sweet.      Her beauty overwhelmed him;      He fell love-sick at her feet.        \"Despite the fervent warnings      Of her friends the flowers and trees,      She listened to his courting;      And with him roamed the leas.        \"The leas, far from the valley,      They rode the livelong night;      Till a heavy mist descending      Hid the roadway from their sight.        \"Uprose, then, forms of evil.      From out the mocking gloom;      And seizing horse and hunter scared,      Left the maiden to her doom.        \"Travellers now within those regions,      Through the nightly grey fog see      A woman's shade crawl slow along,      To a ghastly melody.        \"And those who linger--follow      The phantom pale and wan.      O'er hill and dale, and rill and vale      It slowly leads them on.        \"On till they reach the valley,      A valley grim and drear,      Where lurid things with fibrous arms      Their course through darkness steer.        \"And on the travellers palsied      In frenzied crowd they pour.      And those who view their faces,      Are heard but seen no more.\"    \"Do you mean to say she dreamed all that?\" Gladys exclaimed.    \"Yes,\" the Vicar's wife said. \"She told me so and I have no reason to  doubt her. She doesn't romance as a rule, and is certainly not the  least bit in the world poetical--on the contrary she is most practical  and matter-of-fact. Her only hobby, as far as I know, is flowers.\"    \"Mine, too!\" Gladys interrupted. \"Were you able to explain the  verses?\"    \"No, I can't interpret dreams. I'm intensely interested in them; as I  am in all things psychic. I was at a lecture given by Mrs. Annie  Besant last night! She--\"    \"Do you know any one who does interpret dreams?\" Gladys asked.    \"Why, yes! A firm, claiming to do all sorts of wonderful things--to  tell dreams, solve tricks, divine the presence of metals and water,  and so on, has just set up in Cockspur Street. I read a short notice  about them in this morning's paper. I will get it for you.\"    She left the room and in a few moments returned.    \"Here it is,\" she said. And under the heading of \"Sorcery Revived\"  Gladys read as follows:--    \"There is really no end to the devices to which people resort nowadays  to make money, but for sheer novelty, nothing, we think, beats this.  Three Americans, Messrs. Hamar, Kelson and Curtis, fresh from San  Francisco, California, have just bought premises in Cockspur Street,  S.W., and set up there as Sorcerers!    \"They style themselves 'The Modern Sorcery Company Ltd.,' and profess  to interpret dreams, read people's thoughts, tell their pasts, solve  all manner of tricks and detect the presence of metals and water. One  wonders what next!\"    \"This paper evidently has its doubts,\" Gladys commented. \"They are  frauds, of course.\"    \"I dare say they are,\" the Vicar's wife replied, \"though I believe in  thought-reading and other things they say they can do. I advised Miss  Rosenberg to see them about her dream. She went in by the nine o'clock  train. Had you come a few minutes earlier you would have seen her.\"    \"Well, thanks awfully,\" Gladys said, \"for telling me about these  people. Very probably I'll go in to Town some time during the day and  call at Cockspur Street. I must apologize again for calling at such an  unearthly hour. Good-bye,\" and Gladys smilingly took her departure.          CHAPTER IX    LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT      Shortly after Gladys reached home after her visit to the Vicarage, a  young man with a serious expression somewhat out of keeping with his  jaunty walk, entered the gate of Pine Cottage, and came to an abrupt  halt.    \"Well,\" he ejaculated, \"this is a pretty place, and what's more--for  dozens of houses and gardens are pretty--it's artistic!\" In front of  him stretched a miniature avenue of chestnut trees, which was rendered  striking, even to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14328"],[0,"The Consolation of Philosophy (#18)"],[1," received from without, then might it be taken  away by him who gave it, or some other; but since it is conferred by his  own righteousness, then only will he lose his prize when he has ceased  to be righteous. Lastly, since every prize is desired because it is  believed to be good, who can account him who possesses good to be  without reward? And what a prize, the fairest and grandest of all! For  remember the corollary which I chiefly insisted on a little while back,  and reason thus: Since absolute good is happiness, 'tis clear that all  the good must be happy for the very reason that they are good. But it  was agreed that those who are happy are gods. So, then, the prize of the  good is one which no time may impair, no man's power lessen, no man's  unrighteousness tarnish; 'tis very Godship. And this being so, the wise  man cannot doubt that punishment is inseparable from the bad. For since  good and bad, and likewise reward and punishment, are contraries, it  necessarily follows that, corresponding to all that we see accrue as  reward of the good, there is some penalty attached as punishment of  evil. As, then, righteousness itself is the reward of the righteous, so  wickedness itself is the punishment of the unrighteous. Now, no one who  is visited with punishment doubts that he is visited with evil.  Accordingly, if they were but willing to weigh their own case, could  _they_ think themselves free from punishment whom wickedness, worst of  all evils, has not only touched, but deeply tainted?    'See, also, from the opposite standpoint--the standpoint of the  good--what a penalty attends upon the wicked. Thou didst learn a little  since that whatever is is one, and that unity itself is good.  Accordingly, by this way of reckoning, whatever falls away from goodness  ceases to be; whence it comes to pass that the bad cease to be what they  were, while only the outward aspect is still left to show they have been  men. Wherefore, by their perversion to badness, they have lost their  true human nature. Further, since righteousness alone can raise men  above the level of humanity, it must needs be that unrighteousness  degrades below man's level those whom it has cast out of man's estate.  It results, then, that thou canst not consider him human whom thou seest  transformed by vice. The violent despoiler of other men's goods,  enflamed with covetousness, surely resembles a wolf. A bold and restless  spirit, ever wrangling in law-courts, is like some yelping cur. The  secret schemer, taking pleasure in fraud and stealth, is own brother to  the fox. The passionate man, phrenzied with rage, we might believe to be  animated with the soul of a lion. The coward and runaway, afraid where  no fear is, may be likened to the timid deer. He who is sunk in  ignorance and stupidity lives like a dull ass. He who is light and  inconstant, never holding long to one thing, is for all the world like a  bird. He who wallows in foul and unclean lusts is sunk in the pleasures  of a filthy hog. So it comes to pass that he who by forsaking  righteousness ceases to be a man cannot pass into a Godlike condition,  but actually turns into a brute beast.'        SONG III.    CIRCE'S CUP.          Th' Ithacan discreet,      And all his storm-tossed fleet,      Far o'er the ocean wave      The winds of heaven drave--      Drave to the mystic isle,      Where dwelleth in her guile      That fair and faithless one,      The daughter of the Sun.      There for the stranger crew      With cunning spells she knew      To mix th' enchanted cup.      For whoso drinks it up,      Must suffer hideous change      To monstrous shapes and strange.      One like a boar appears;      This his huge form uprears,      Mighty in bulk and limb--      An Afric lion--grim      With claw and fang. Confessed      A wolf, this, sore distressed      When he would weep, doth howl;      And, strangely tame, these prowl      The Indian tiger's mates.        And though in such sore straits,      The pity of the god      Who bears the mystic rod      Had power the chieftain brave      From her fell arts to save;      His comrades, unrestrained,      The fatal goblet drained.      All now with low-bent head,      Like swine, on acorns fed;      Man's speech and form were reft,      No human feature left;      But steadfast still, the mind,      Unaltered, unresigned,      The monstrous change bewailed.        How little, then, availed      The potencies of ill!      These herbs, this baneful skill,      May change each outward part,      But cannot touch the heart.      In its true home, deep-set,      Man's spirit liveth yet.      _Those_ poisons are more fell,      More potent to expel      Man from his high estate,      Which subtly penetrate,      And leave the body whole,      But deep infect the soul.        IV.      Then said I: 'This is very true. I see that the vicious, though they  keep the outward form of man, are rightly said to be changed into beasts  in respect of their spiritual nature; but, inasmuch as their cruel and  polluted minds vent their rage in the destruction of the good, I would  this license were not permitted to them.'    'Nor is it,' said she, 'as shall be shown in the fitting place. Yet if  that license which thou believest to be permitted to them were taken  away, the punishment of the wicked would be in great part remitted. For  verily, incredible as it may seem to some, it needs must be that the bad  are more unfortunate when they have accomplished their desires than if  they are unable to get them fulfilled. If it is wretched to will evil,  to have been able to accomplish evil is more wretched; for without the  power the wretched will would fail of effect. Accordingly, those whom  thou seest to will, to be able to accomplish, and to accomplish crime,  must needs be the victims of a threefold wretchedness, since each one of  these states has its own measure of wretchedness.'    'Yes,' said I; 'yet I earnestly wish they might speedily be quit of this  misfortune by losing the ability to accomplish crime.'    'They will lose it,' said she, 'sooner than perchance thou wishest, or  they themselves think likely; since, verily, within the narrow bounds of  our brief life there is nothing so late in coming that anyone, least of  all an immortal spirit, should deem it long to wait for. Their great  expectations, the lofty fabric of their crimes, is oft overthrown by a  sudden and unlooked-for ending, and this but sets a limit to their  misery. For if wickedness makes men wretched, he is necessarily more  wretched who is wicked for a longer time; and were it not that death, at  all events, puts an end to the evil doings of the wicked, I should  account them wretched to the last degree. Indeed, if we have formed true  conclusions about the ill fortune of wickedness, that wretchedness is  plainly infinite which is doomed to be eternal.'    Then said I: 'A wonderful inference, and difficult to grant; but I see  that it agrees entirely with our previous conclusions.'    'Thou art right,' said she; 'but if anyone finds it hard to admit the  conclusion, he ought in fairness either to prove some falsity in the  premises, or to show that the combination of propositions does not  adequately enforce the necessity of the conclusion; otherwise, if the  premises be granted, nothing whatever can be said against the inference  of the conclusion. And here is another statement which seems not less  wonderful, but on the premises assumed is equally necessary.'    'What is that?'    'The wicked are happier in undergoing punishment than if no penalty of  justice chasten them. And I am not now meaning what might occur to  anyone--that bad character is amended by retribution, and is brought  into the right path by the terror of punishment, or that it serves as an  example to warn others to avoid transgression; but I believe that in  another way the wicked are more unfortunate when they go unpunished,  even though no account be taken of amendment, and no regard be paid to  example.'    'Why, what other way is there beside these?' said I.    Then said she: 'Have we not agreed that the good are happy, and the evil  wretched?'    'Yes,' said I.    'Now, if,' said she, 'to one in affliction there be given along with his  misery some good thing, is he not happier than one whose misery is  misery pure and simple without admixture of any good?'    'It would seem so.'    'But if to one thus wretched, one destitute of all good, some further  evil be added besides those which make him wretched, is he not to be  judged far more unhappy than he whose ill fortune is alleviated by some  share of good?'    'It could scarcely be otherwise.'    'Surely, then, the wicked, when they are punished, have a good thing  added to them--to wit, the punishment which by the law of justice is  good; and likewise, when they escape punishment, a new evil attaches to  them in that very freedom from punishment which thou hast rightly  acknowledged to be an evil in the case of the unrighteous.'    'I cannot deny it.'    'Then, the wicked are far more unhappy when indulged with an unjust  freedom from punishment than when punished by a just retribution. Now,  it is manifest that it is just for the wicked to be punished, and for  them to escape unpunished is unjust.'    'Why, who would venture to deny it?'    'This, too, no one can possibly deny--that all which is just is good,  and, conversely, all which is unjust is bad.'    Then I answered: 'These inferences do indeed follow from what we lately  concluded; but tell me,' said I, 'dost thou take no account of the  punishment of the soul after the death of the body?'    'Nay, truly,' said she, 'great are these penalties, some of them  inflicted, I imagine, in the severity of retribution, others in the  mercy of purification. But it is not my present purpose to speak of  these. So far, my aim hath been to make thee recognise that the power of  the bad"]]]
