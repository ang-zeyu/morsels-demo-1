(2) See The Gospel according to MATTHEW, chap. ii., verses 1 to 12.      If there be an abuse of correspondences, or symbols, there surely must  also be a use, to which the word \"magic\" is not inapplicable. As such,  religious ritual, and especially the sacraments of the Christian Church,  will, no doubt, occur to the minds of those who regard these symbols  as efficacious, though they would probably hesitate to apply the term  \"magical\" to them. But in using this term as applying thereto, I do  not wish to suggest that any such rites or ceremonies possess, or can  possess, any CAUSAL efficacy in the moral evolution of the soul. The  will alone, in virtue of the power vouchsafed to it by the Source of all  power, can achieve this; but I do think that the soul may be assisted by  ritual, harmoniously related to the states of mind which it is desired  to induce. No doubt there is a danger of religious ritual, especially  when its meaning is lost, being engaged in for its own sake. It is then  mere superstition;(1) and, in view of the danger of this degeneracy,  many robust minds, such as the members of the Society of Friends, prefer  to dispense with its aid altogether. When ritual is associated with  erroneous doctrines, the results are even more disastrous, as I have  indicated in \"The Belief in Talismans\". But when ritual is allied with,  and based upon, as adequately symbolising, the high teaching of genuine  religion, it may be, and, in fact, is, found very helpful by many  people. As such its efficacy seems to me to be altogether magical, in  the best sense of that word.      (1) As \"ELIPHAS LEVI\" well says: \"Superstition... is the sign surviving  the thought; it is the dead body of a religious rite.\" (_Op cit_., p.  150.)      But, indeed, I think a still wider application of the word \"magic\" is  possible. \"All experience is magic,\" says NOVALIS (1772-1801), \"and  only magically explicable\";(2a) and again: \"It is only because of the  feebleness of our perceptions and activity that we do not perceive  ourselves to be in a fairy world.\" No doubt it will be objected that the  common experiences of daily life are \"natural,\" whereas magic postulates  the \"supernatural\". If, as is frequently done, we use the term  \"natural,\" as relating exclusively to the physical realm, then, indeed,  we may well speak of magic as \"supernatural,\" because its aims are  psychical. On the other hand, the term \"natural\" is sometimes employed  as referring to the whole realm of order, and in this sense one can use  the word \"magic\" as descriptive of Nature herself when viewed in the  light of an idealistic philosophy, such as that of SWEDENBORG, in which  all causation is seen to be essentially spiritual, the things of this  world being envisaged as symbols of ideas or spiritual verities, and  thus physical causation regarded as an appearance produced in virtue of  the magical, non-causal efficacy of symbols.(1) Says CORNELIUS AGRIPPA:  \"... every day some natural thing is drawn by art and some divine  thing is drawn by Nature which, the Egyptians, seeing, called Nature a  Magicianess (_i.e_.) the very Magical power itself, in the attracting of  like by like, and of suitable things by suitable.\"(2)      (2a) NOVALIS: _Schriften_ (ed. by LUDWIG TIECK and FR. SCHLEGEL, 1805),  vol. ii. p. 195    (1) For a discussion of the essentially magical character of inductive  reasoning, see my _The Magic of Experience_ (1915)    (2) _Op. cit_., bk. i. chap. xxxvii. p. 119.      I would suggest, in conclusion, that there is nothing really opposed  to the spirit of modern science in the thesis that \"all experience  is magic, and only magically explicable.\" Science does not pretend  to reveal the fundamental or underlying cause of phenomena, does  not pretend to answer the final Why? This is rather the business  of philosophy, though, in thus distinguishing between science and  philosophy, I am far from insinuating that philosophy should be  otherwise than scientific. We often hear religious but non-scientific  men complain because scientific and perhaps equally as religious men do  not in their books ascribe the production of natural phenomena to the  Divine Power. But if they were so to do they would be transcending  their business as scientists. In every science certain simple facts of  experience are taken for granted: it is the business of the scientist  to reduce other and more complex facts of experience to terms of these  data, not to explain these data themselves. Thus the physicist attempts  to reduce other related phenomena of greater complexity to terms of  simple force and motion; but, What are force and motion? Why does force  produce or result in motion? are questions which lie beyond the scope  of physics. In order to answer these questions, if, indeed, this be  possible, we must first inquire, How and why do these ideas of force and  motion arise in our minds? These problems land us in the psychical or  spiritual world, and the term \"magic\" at once becomes significant.    \"If, says THOMAS CARLYLE,... we... have led thee into the true Land of  Dreams; and... thou lookest, even for moments, into the region of  the Wonderful, and seest and feelest that thy daily life is girt with  Wonder, and based on Wonder, and thy very blankets and breeches are  Miracles,--then art thou profited beyond money's worth....\"(1)      (1) THOMAS CARLYLE: _Sartor Resartus_, bk. iii. chap. ix.          VIII. ARCHITECTURAL SYMBOLISM    I WAS once rash enough to suggest in an essay \"On Symbolism in Art\"(1)  that \"a true work of art is at once realistic, imaginative, and  symbolical,\" and that its aim is to make manifest the spiritual  significance of the natural objects dealt with. I trust that those  artists (no doubt many) who disagree with me will forgive me--a man  of science--for having ventured to express any opinion whatever on the  subject. But, at any rate, if the suggestions in question are accepted,  then a criterion for distinguishing between art and craft is at once  available; for we may say that, whilst craft aims at producing works  which are physically useful, art aims at producing works which are  spiritually useful. Architecture, from this point of view, is a  combination of craft and art. It may, indeed, be said that the modern  architecture which creates our dwelling-houses, factories, and even to  a large extent our places of worship, is pure craft unmixed with art On  the other hand, it might be argued that such works of architecture are  not always devoid of decoration, and that \"decorative art,\" even though  the \"decorative artist\" is unconscious of this fact, is based upon rules  and employs symbols which have a deep significance. The truly artistic  element in architecture, however, is more clearly manifest if we turn  our gaze to the past. One thinks at once, of course, of the pyramids  and sphinx of Egypt, and the rich and varied symbolism of design and  decoration of antique structures to be found in Persia and elsewhere in  the East. It is highly probable that the Egyptian pyramids were employed  for astronomical purposes, and thus subserved physical utility, but it  seems no less likely that their shape was suggested by a belief in some  system of geometrical symbolism, and was intended to embody certain of  their philosophical or religious doctrines.      (1) Published in _The Occult Review_ for August 1912, vol. xvi. pp. 98  to 102.      The mediaeval cathedrals and churches of Europe admirably exhibit this  combination of art with craft. Craft was needed to design and construct  permanent buildings to protect worshippers from the inclemency of the  weather; art was employed not only to decorate such buildings, but  it dictated to craft many points in connection with their design. The  builders of the mediaeval churches endeavoured so to construct their  works that these might, as a whole and in their various parts, embody  the truths, as they believed them, of the Christian religion: thus the  cruciform shape of churches, their orientation, etc. The practical  value of symbolism in church architecture is obvious. As Mr F. E. HULME  remarks, \"The sculptured fonts or stained-glass windows in the churches  of the Middle Ages were full of teaching to a congregation of whom  the greater part could not read, to whom therefore one great avenue of  knowledge was closed. The ignorant are especially impressed by pictorial  teaching, and grasp its meaning far more readily than they can follow a  written description or a spoken discourse.\"(1)      (1) F. EDWARD HULME, F.L.S., F.S.A.: _The History, Principles, and  Practice of Symbolism in Christian Art_ (1909), p. 2.      The subject of symbolism in church architecture is an extensive one,  involving many side issues. In these excursions we shall consider only  one aspect of it, namely, the symbolic use of animal forms in English  church architecture.    As Mr COLLINS, who has written, in recent years, an interesting work on  this topic of much use to archaeologists as a book of data,(2a) points  out, the great sources of animal symbolism were the famous _Physiologus_  and other natural history books of the Middle Ages (generally called  \"Bestiaries\"), and the Bible, mystically understood. The modern tendency  is somewhat unsympathetic towards any attempt to interpret the Bible  symbolically, and certainly some of the interpretations that have been  forced upon it in the name of symbolism are crude and fantastic enough.  But in the belief of the mystics, culminating in the elaborate system of  correspondences of SWEDENBORG, that every natural"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12753"],[0,"The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights (#18)"],[1,"ether. And so they fell to eagerly, and  gave each other many great and mighty strokes.    And as they were thus fighting, the damsel Vivien, lady of the lake, who  loved King Arthur, came upon the ground, for she knew by her enchantments  how Morgan le Fay had craftily devised to have King Arthur slain by his  own sword that day, and therefore came to save his life. And Arthur and  Sir Accolon were now grown hot against each other, and spared not strength  nor fury in their fierce assaults; but the king's sword gave way  continually before Sir Accolon's, so that at every stroke he was sore  wounded, and his blood ran from him so fast that it was a marvel he could  stand. When King Arthur saw the ground so sore be-blooded, he bethought  him in dismay that there was magic treason worked upon him, and that his  own true sword was changed, for it seemed to him that the sword in Sir  Accolon's hand was Excalibur, for fearfully it drew his blood at every  blow, while what he held himself kept no sharp edge, nor fell with any  force upon his foe.    \"Now, knight, look to thyself, and keep thee well from me,\" cried out Sir  Accolon. But King Arthur answered not, and gave him such a buffet on the  helm as made him stagger and nigh fall upon the ground. Then Sir Accolon  withdrew a little, and came on with Excalibur on high, and smote King  Arthur in return with such a mighty stroke as almost felled him; and both  being now in hottest wrath, they gave each other grievous and savage  blows. But Arthur all the time was losing so much blood that scarcely  could he keep upon his feet yet so full was he of knighthood, that  knightly he endured the pain, and still sustained himself, though now he  was so feeble that he thought himself about to die. Sir Accolon, as yet,  had lost no drop of blood, and being very bold and confident in Excalibur,  even grew more vigorous and hasty in his assaults. But all men who beheld  them said they never saw a knight fight half so well as did King Arthur;  and all the people were so grieved for him that they besought Sir Damas  and Sir Outzlake to make up their quarrel and so stay the fight; but they  would not.    So still the battle raged, till Arthur drew a little back for breath and a  few moments' rest; but Accolon came on after him, following fiercely and  crying loud, \"It is no time for me to suffer thee to rest,\" and therewith  set upon him. Then Arthur, full of scorn and rage, lifted up his sword and  struck Sir Accolon upon the helm so mightily that he drove him to his  knees; but with the force of that great stroke his brittle, treacherous  sword broke short off at the hilt, and fell down in the grass among the  blood, leaving the pommel only in his hand. At that, King Arthur thought  within himself that all was over, and secretly prepared his mind for  death, yet kept himself so knightly sheltered by his shield that he lost  no ground, and made as though he yet had hope and cheer. Then said Sir  Accolon, \"Sir knight, thou now art overcome and canst endure no longer,  seeing thou art weaponless, and hast lost already so much blood. Yet am I  fully loth to slay thee; yield, then, therefore, to me as recreant.\"  \"Nay,\" said King Arthur, \"that may I not, for I have promised to do battle  to the uttermost by the faith of my body while my life lasteth; and I had  rather die with honour than live with shame; and if it were possible for  me to die an hundred times, I had rather die as often than yield me to  thee, for though I lack weapons, I shall lack no worship, and it shall be  to thy shame to slay me weaponless.\" \"Aha,\" shouted then Sir Accolon, \"as  for the shame, I will not spare; look to thyself, sir knight, for thou art  even now but a dead man.\" Therewith he drove at him with pitiless force,  and struck him nearly down; but Arthur evermore waxing in valour as he  waned in blood, pressed on Sir Accolon with his shield, and hit at him so  fiercely with the pommel in his hand, as hurled him three strides  backwards.    This, therefore, so confused Sir Accolon, that rushing up, all dizzy, to  deliver once again a furious blow, even as he struck, Excalibur, by  Vivien's magic, fell from out his hands upon the earth. Beholding which,  King Arthur lightly sprang to it, and grasped it, and forthwith felt it  was his own good sword, and said to it, \"Thou hast been from me all too  long, and done me too much damage.\" Then spying the scabbard hanging by  Sir Accolon's side, he sprang and pulled it from him, and cast it away as  far as he could throw it; for so long as he had worn it, Arthur new his  life would have been kept secure. \"Oh, knight!\" then said the king, \"thou  hast this day wrought me much damage by this sword, but now art thou come  to thy death, for I shall not warrant thee but that thou shalt suffer, ere  we part, somewhat of that thou hast made me suffer.\" And therewithal King  Arthur flew at him with all his might, and pulled him to the earth, and  then struck off his helm, and gave him on the head a fearful buffet, till  the blood leaped forth. \"Now will I slay thee!\" cried King Arthur; for his  heart was hardened, and his body all on fire with fever, till for a moment  he forgot his knightly mercy. \"Slay me thou mayest,\" said Sir Accolon,  \"for thou art the best knight I ever found, and I see well that God is  with thee; and I, as thou hast, have promised to fight this battle to the  uttermost, and never to be recreant while I live; therefore shall I never  yield me with my mouth, and God must do with my body what he will.\" And as  Sir Accolon spoke, King Arthur thought he knew his voice; and parting all  his blood-stained hair from out his eyes, and leaning down towards him,  saw, indeed, it was his friend and own true knight. Then said he--keeping  his own visor down--\"I pray thee tell me of what country art thou, and  what court?\" \"Sir knight,\" he answered, \"I am of King Arthur's court, and  my name is Sir Accolon of Gaul.\" Then said the king, \"Oh, sir knight! I  pray thee tell me who gave thee this sword? and from whom thou hadst it?\"    Then said Sir Accolon, \"Woe worth this sword, for by it I have gotten my  death. This sword hath been in my keeping now for almost twelve months,  and yesterday Queen Morgan le Fay, wife of King Urience, sent it to me by  a dwarf, that therewith I might in some way slay her brother, King Arthur;  for thou must understand that King Arthur is the man she hateth most in  all the world, being full of envy and jealousy because he is of greater  worship and renown than any other of her blood. She loveth me also as much  as she doth hate him; and if she might contrive to slay King Arthur by her  craft and magic, then would she straightway kill her husband also, and  make me the king of all this land, and herself my queen, to reign with me;  but now,\" said he, \"all that is over, for this day I am come to my death.\"    \"It would have been sore treason of thee to destroy thy lord,\" said  Arthur. \"Thou sayest truly,\" answered he; \"but now that I have told thee,  and openly confessed to thee all that foul treason whereof I now do  bitterly repent, tell me, I pray thee, whence art thou, and of what  court?\" \"O, Sir Accolon!\" said King Arthur, \"learn that I am myself King  Arthur.\" When Sir Accolon heard this he cried aloud, \"Alas, my gracious  lord! have mercy on me, for I knew thee not.\" \"Thou shalt have mercy,\"  said he, \"for thou knewest not my person at this time; and though by thine  own confession thou art a traitor, yet do I blame thee less, because thou  hast been blinded by the false crafts of my sister Morgan le Fay, whom I  have trusted more than all others of my kin, and whom I now shall know  well how to punish.\" Then did Sir Accolon cry loudly, \"O, lords, and all  good people! this noble knight that I have fought with is the noblest and  most worshipful in all the world; for it is King Arthur, our liege lord  and sovereign king; and full sorely I repent that I have ever lifted lance  against him, though in ignorance I did it.\"    Then all the people fell down on their knees and prayed the pardon of the  king for suffering him to come to such a strait. But he replied, \"Pardon  ye cannot have, for, truly, ye have nothing sinned; but here ye see what  ill adventure may ofttimes befall knights-errant, for to my own hurt, and  his danger also, I have fought with one of my own knights.\"    Then the king commanded Sir Damas to surrender to his brother the whole  manor, Sir Outzlake only yielding him a palfrey every year; \"for,\" said he  scornfully, \"it would become thee better to ride on than a courser;\" and  ordered Damas, upon pain of death, never again to touch or to distress  knights-errant riding on their adventures; and also to make full  compensation and satisfaction to the twenty knights whom he had held in  prison. \"And if any of them,\" said the king, \"come to my court complaining  that he hath not had full satisfaction of thee for his injuries, by my  head, thou shalt die therefor.\"    Afterwards, King Arthur asked Sir Outzlake to come with him to his court,  where he should become a knight of his, and, if his deeds were noble, be  advanced to all he might desire.    So then he took his leave of all the people and mounted upon horseback,  and Sir Accolon went with him to an abbey hard by, where both their wounds  were dressed. But Sir Accolon died within four days after. And when he was  dead, the king sent his body to Queen Morgan, to Camelot, saying that he  sent her a present in return for the sword Excalibur which she had sent  him by the damsel.    So, on the morrow, there came a damsel from Queen Morgan to the king, and  brought with her the richest mantle that ever was seen, for it was set as  full of precious stones as they could stand against each other, and they  were the richest stones that ever the king saw. And the damsel said, \"Your  sister sendeth you this mantle, and prayeth you to take her gift, and in"]]]
