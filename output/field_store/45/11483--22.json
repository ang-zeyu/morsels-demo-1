Then serve  the other end in a similar manner, and smooth each seam along.    We now take a piece of stout millboard (an old ledger book cover will  do if large enough), or, if purchased with the frame, ask for a two  pound board: this will cost about 4d., and be sufficient for several  bags. Cut it quarter of an inch less than the bottom all round, and  see that it fits before gluing it in. To do this, place one end within  the seams at one end of the bag, and by lifting it in the middle press  in the other, when the stiffening will lie within the four seams at  the bottom. Having fitted it satisfactorily, take it out again and  glue it well with some good hot glue. This must be neither too thick  nor too thin. The best way to prepare it is to lay some glue in cold  water for twelve hours. It will absorb sufficient water in that time,  and can be boiled up without any further preparation. The quicker it  is fixed after the glue is put on the better. A brush similar to a  paint brush will be the best to apply it with, and need not cost more  than 6d. After the gluing, lay it aside for a few hours to allow it to  thoroughly set, during which time the making of the handles can be  proceeded with. On some bought bags these are very common, and seldom  last more than a few months; the usual plan being to take a piece of  rope about the size of a clothes line and roll a piece of brown paper  round it, covering it afterward with a piece of basil leather.    Procure two pieces of brown harness leather--the shoulder of the hide  is most suitable--from a saddler, 11 inches long by 1-1/8 inches wide,  round the four ends, and make a compass mark 1/8 of an inch from the  edge all round for the stitching. Take a piece of line as above, and  place within the leather, which most likely will have to be damped to  make it draw round easier. Leave 11/2 inches from each end for sewing to  the bag, the line also being so much less than the full length of the  handles. Having sewn them, flatten the ends and bend the handles into  a semicircular shape, and leave them to dry.    By this time the glue holding the stiffening to the bottom of the bag  will be set, so the next move will be to put in the studs or nails.  Take the largest size awl and make five punctures through the bottom,  about three-quarters of an inch from each corner and one in the  center, as in Fig 8; push the nails through and turn down each of the  two claws in an opposite direction, tap them with a hammer to make  them lie closer, and also to prevent them from becoming loose. This  done, we next take the frame and remove the key-plate from it.    Fold the sides of the bag well over the frame, so that the stitching  will get a good hold of the part that goes inside. Put a stitch  through at each corner to hold it, and see that it sets perfectly true  on the frame. A space is left between the two plates of iron forming  the frame, which allows of the bag being sewn through it. Fix the  key-plate by riveting inside. Sew the bag from one corner of frame to  the other corner on each side, leaving the gussets unstitched. It is  now ready for the lining. Let this be good, as it will greatly add to  the durability of the bag if strong. Coarse linen at 8d. to 10d. per  yard is the best material for this purpose. The sides and bottom may  be cut in one piece; the length of this will be twice the depth of one  side of carpet (less the part which folds over the frame) and the  width of the bottom. The width of this piece throughout to be a half  inch less than the outsides were cut. The gusset lining will want to  be the same width as the gusset, but an inch less in length will do.  The seams of the lining may be stitched with an ordinary household  sewing machine if good thread is used. When made, place the lining  inside the bag, see that it is well down at the bottom, turn in the  top edge all round to the required size, and fix in as follows: Take a  long carpet needle and a length of thread, pass the needle through the  lining at the folded ridge and bring it up again through the same at a  distance of an inch or so. This forms a stitch within the lining; pass  the needle through one of the stitches made in sewing in the frame and  repeat as before, carefully observing that the lining falls into its  proper place as it is being sewn in. Continue in this way until the  two sides are done, leaving only the gussets and gusset lining to be  united. This is done by folding the edges inward and sewing them  together, the frame joints moving freely between the gussets and  lining. We have now only the handles to put on and it is complete. Sew  these on with a five cord thread well waxed. To protect the lock  against being unduly strained when filled, a strap and buckle may be  put on between the handles and each end of the frame, as in Fig. 3.    Next in order is the cricket bat bag, which should always be comprised  in the outfit of the amateur cricketer, as well as of the  professional. In making this we follow the instructions given for the  carpet bag. It may be made either of carpet, tan-canvas, or leather,  the latter, of course, being the strongest and most expensive. Carpet  will not require to be described, but a brief description of  tan-canvas and leather may be of service to the amateur in assisting  him to choose something for himself.    Tan-canvas, as used for bags and portmanteaux, is a strong, coarse  material of a brown color; it wears well, and has one advantage over  carpet--it is thoroughly waterproof.    Leather is, of course, superior to carpet or canvas, but there are a  few tricks in its manufacture which it may not be out of place here to  mention as a caution to the amateur that the old saying, \"There's  nothing _like_ leather,\" is a thing of the past where the general  appearance of an article is meant. The genius of the inventor has  produced machinery which gives to paper, linen, and other stuffs the  appearance of the genuine article, whereas it does not contain one  particle of it. At one time, when a hide of leather was required to be  of the same thickness all over it, the currier would work at the flesh  of the skin with a shaving knife, gradually scraping the thick parts  away until it was reduced to the required substance. Now it is done  in a few minutes. The hide is passed whole between the rollers of a  splitting machine against the sharp edge of a knife, which reaches  from one side of the machine to the other, a distance of 10 or 12  feet. This knife is so gauged that any thickness can be taken off at  one operation, the part taken off resembling the hide in size and  shape. The top or grain of the hide is then dressed and finished off  brown, if for brown hides; or, if to be used for enameled hides, they  are dyed and japanned. These are called either brown or enameled  cow-hides, according as they are finished off, and are used for all  the best class of Gladstone, brief, and other bags. The bottom or  fleshing of the hide is also dyed and japanned, and when finished,  exactly resembles in appearance the hide itself, and is very difficult  for the novice to tell when made up into bags or any other article.  These are called _splits_, and having had the best part of the skin  taken from them, do not wear one-fourth the time the grain will. The  black enamel soon chips off, which gives them a worn-out appearance.    To make a bag 36 inches by 12 inches by 8 inches requires a frame 36  inches long, the sides 361/2 inches by 14 inches, gussets 14 inches by  81/2 inches, bottom 361/2 inches by 8 inches. The lining will be 36 inches  by 12 inches for the sides, gussets 13 inches by 8 inches, bottom 36  inches by 8 inches. For the handles two pieces of leather 12 inches by  2 inches. The straps and chapes are sewn on quite close to the frame,  straps 10 inches long by 1 inch, chapes 41/2 inches by 1 inch. Cut a  slit in the middle of the chape for the buckle tongue to go through,  and pare the under side at the end so that it is not too lumpy when  sewn on to the bag. Cut two loops 3 inches long by 3/4 inch wide for the  points of straps to go through.    The brief bag must be made of leather, and as there is the same amount  of work in making it, whether it be of split or hide, it will be sure  to give greater satisfaction if the latter is chosen. The manufacture  of this bag differs considerably from the others. The sides and  gussets in the carpet bag are cut straight from top to bottom, but in  the brief bag they must be shaped to fit the frame, and give it a more  comely appearance. The frame, as before described, is quite different.  The way to commence with this bag is to open the frame as in Fig. 7,  so that it will lie perfectly flat upon the bench. With the rule  measure it carefully between the corners, A, A, and again at A, B. The  distance between A and B being less when the frame is open than when  closed, an additional 1/2 inch must be added to allow the gusset to bend  freely round the hinge. Having correctly taken these measurements, get  a sheet of brown paper and fold it in the middle; the reason for this  is to allow of each side of the pattern taking the same curve at the  swelled part. Cut the pattern for the sides first by ascertaining half  the distance, A, A, and marking it on to the edge of the paper,  measuring from the folded edge toward the ends. Next mark on the  folded edge the depth you intend the bag to be, allowing in this, as  in the carpet bag, 11/2 inches for covering the frame. The depths of  brief bags vary so much that I will give these only as a guide,  leaving my readers to add or reduce as their fancy guides them; but if  they should strictly adhere to these given below, I am certain they  will find them very useful sizes.    For a 12 inch frame cut the sides and gussets 101/2 inches in depth;  when made up, these will be "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16363"],[0,"The New York Times Current History of the European War, Vol 1, Issue 4, January (#18)"],[1,"combination, did their share when the enemy were  repulsed. As they fell back they were subjected to a shower of shrapnel.  When they sought shelter in villages or buildings they were shattered  and driven out by high-explosive shells and then again caught by  shrapnel as they came into the open.    The troops to suffer so severely were mostly of Twenty-third Corps, one  of their new formations.    Certainly the way their advance was conducted showed a lack of training  and faults in leading which the almost superhuman bravery of the  soldiers could not counterbalance. It was a holocaust.    The spectacle of these devoted men chanting a national song as they  marched on to certain death was inspiring. It was at the same time  pitiable.    And if any proof were needed that untrained valor alone cannot gain the  day in modern war, the advance of the Twenty-third German Corps on Oct.  23 most assuredly furnished it.    Besides doing its share of execution on the hostile infantry, our  artillery in this quarter brought down a German captive balloon.    As some gauge of the rate at which the guns were firing at what was for  them an ideal target, it may be mentioned that one field battery  expended 1,800 rounds of ammunition during the day.    On Saturday, the 24th, action on our right was once more confined to  that of artillery, except at night, when the Germans pressed on, only to  be repulsed.    In the centre, near Armentieres, our troops withstood three separate  attempts of the enemy to push forward, our guns coming into play with  good effect. Against our left the German Twenty-seventh Corps made a  violent effort with no success.    On Sunday, the 25th, it was our turn to take the offensive. This was  carried out by a portion of our left wing, which advanced, gained some  ground, and took two guns and eighty prisoners. It is believed that six  machine guns fell to the French.    In the centre the fighting was severe, though generally indecisive in  result, and the troops in some places were engaged in hand-to-hand  combat. Toward evening we captured 200 prisoners.    On the right action was again confined to that of the guns.    Up to the night of the 25th, therefore, not only have we maintained our  position against the great effort on the part of the enemy to break  through to the west, or to force us back, which started on the 20th; we  have on our left passed to the offensive.    These six days, as may be gathered, have been spent by us in repelling a  succession of desperate onslaughts. It is true that the efforts against  us have been made to a great extent by partially trained men, some of  whom appear to be suffering from lack of food. But it must not be  forgotten that these troops, which are in great force, have only  recently been brought into the field, and are therefore comparatively  fresh. They are fighting also with the utmost determination, in spite  of the fact that many of them are heartily sick of the war.    The struggle has been of the most severe and sanguinary nature, and it  seems that success will favor that side which is possessed of most  endurance, or can bring up and fling fresh forces into the fray. Though  we have undoubtedly inflicted immense loss upon the enemy, they have so  far been able to fill up the gaps in their ranks and to return to the  charge, and we have suffered heavily ourselves.    One feature of the tactics now employed has been the use of cavalry in  dismounted action, for on both sides many of the mounted troops are  fighting in the trenches alongside the infantry.    Armored motor cars, armed with Maxims and light quick-firing guns, also  have recently played a useful part on our side, especially in helping to  eject the enemy lurking in villages and isolated buildings. Against such  parties the combined action of the quick-firer against the snipers in  buildings, and the Maxim against them when they are driven into the  open, is most efficacious.          XI.    *The British Defense at Ypres.*    [Dated Nov. 13.]      The diminution in the force of the German rush to the west has not  lasted long. The section of the front to the north of our forces was the  first to meet the recrudescence of violence in the shape of an attack in  the neighborhood of Dixmude and Bixschoote.    Our turn came next. After eight days of comparative relaxation we were  under constant pressure from Tuesday, Nov. 3, to Tuesday, the 10th. The  next day saw a repetition of the great attempt of the Germans to break  through our lines to the French coast.    What was realized might happen did happen. In spite of the immense  losses suffered by the enemy during the five-day attack against Ypres,  which lasted from Oct. 29 to the 2d of this month, the cessation of  their more violent efforts on the latter day did not signalize the  abandonment of the whole project, but merely the temporary  relinquishment of the main offensive until fresh troops had been massed  to carry on what was proving to be a costly and difficult operation.    Meanwhile the interval was employed in endeavoring to wear out the  Allies by repeated local attacks of varying force and to shatter them by  a prolonged and concentrated bombardment. By the 11th, therefore, it  seems that they considered they had attained both objects, for on that  day they recommenced the desperate battle for the possession of Ypres  and its neighborhood.    Though the struggle has not yet come to an end, this much can be said:  The Germans have gained some ground, but they have not captured Ypres.    In repulsing the enemy so far we have suffered heavy casualties, but  battles of this fierce and prolonged nature cannot but be costly to both  sides. We have the satisfaction of knowing that we have foiled the enemy  in what appears to be at present his main object in the western theatre  of operations, and have inflicted immensely greater losses on him than  those we have suffered ourselves.    To carry on the narrative for the three days of the 10th, 11th, and 12th  of November:    Tuesday, the 10th, was uneventful for us. At some distance beyond our  left flank the enemy advanced in force against the French and were  repulsed. Directly on our left, however, along the greater part of the  front, shelling was less severe, and no infantry attacks took place.    To the southeast of Ypres the enemy kept up a very heavy bombardment  against our line, as well as that of the French. On our left centre the  situation remained unchanged, both sides contenting themselves with  furious cannonading. In our centre the Germans retained their hold on  the small amount of ground which they had gained from us, but in doing  so incurred a heavy loss from our artillery and machine gun fire.    Incidentally, one of the houses held by the enemy was so knocked about  by our fire that its defenders bolted. On their way to the rear they  were met by reinforcements under an officer who halted them, evidently  in an endeavor to persuade them to return. While the parley Was going on  one of our machine guns was quietly moved to a position of vantage,  whence it opened a most effective fire on the group.    On our right one of the enemy's saps, which was being pushed toward our  line, was attacked by us. All the men in it were captured.    Wednesday, the 11th, was another day of desperate fighting. As day broke  the Germans opened fire on our trenches to the north and south of the  road from Menin to Ypres. This was probably the most furious artillery  fire which they have yet employed against us.    A few hours later they followed this by an infantry assault in force.  This attack was carried out by the First and Fourth brigades of the  Guard Corps, which, as we now know from prisoners, have been sent for to  make a supreme effort to capture Ypres, since that task had proved too  heavy for the infantry of the line.    As the attackers surged forward they were met by our frontal fire, and  since they were moving diagonally across part of our front they were  also attacked on the flank by artillery, rifles, and machine guns.  Though their casualties before they reached our line must have been  enormous, such was their resolution and the momentum of the mass that in  spite of the splendid resistance of our troops they succeeded in  breaking through our line in three places near the road. They penetrated  some distance into the woods behind our trenches, but were  counter-attacked again, enfiladed by machine guns and driven back to  their line of trenches, a certain portion of which they succeeded in  holding, in spite of our efforts to expel them.    What their total losses must have been during this advance may be gauged  to some extent from the fact that the number of dead left in the woods  behind our line alone amounted to 700.    A simultaneous effort made to the south, a part of the same operation  although not carried out by the Guard Corps, failed entirely, for when  the attacking infantry massed in the woods close to our line, our guns  opened on them with such effect that they did not push the assault home.    As generally happens in operations in wooded country, the fighting to a  great extent was carried on at close quarters. It was most desperate and  confused. Scattered bodies of the enemy who had penetrated into the  woods in the rear of our position could neither go backward nor forward,  and were nearly all killed or captured.    The portion of the line to the southeast of Ypres held by us was heavily  shelled, but did not undergo any very serious infantry attack. That  occupied by the French, however, was both bombarded and fiercely  assaulted. On the rest of our front, save for the usual bombardment, all  was comparatively quiet.    On the right one of our trenches was mined and then abandoned. As soon  as it was occupied by the enemy the charges were fired and several  Germans were blown to pieces.    Thursday, Nov. 12, was marked by a"]]]
