With an effort he left her at last and mounted the grassy slope and  climbed high up among the tottering yellow crags; and there he battled  with himself. Whatever the charm of Mescal's surrender, and the  insistence of his love, stern hammer-strokes of fairness, duty, honor,  beat into his brain his debt to the man who had saved him. It was a  long-drawn-out battle not to be won merely by saying right was right. He  loved Mescal, she loved him; and something born in him with his new  health, with the breath of this sage and juniper forest, with the sight  of purple canyons and silent beckoning desert, made him fiercely  tenacious of all that life had come to mean for him. He could not give  her up--and yet--    Twilight forced Hare from his lofty retreat, and he trod his way  campward, weary and jaded, but victorious over himself. He thought he  had renounced his hope of Mescal; he returned with a resolve to be true  to August, and to himself; bitterness he would not allow himself to  feel. And yet he feared the rising in him of a new spirit akin to that  of the desert itself, intractable and free.    \"Well, Jack, we rode down the last of Silvermane's band,\" said August,  at supper. \"The Navajos came up and helped us out. To-morrow you'll see  some fun, when we start to break Silvermane. As soon as that's done I'll  go, leaving the Indians to bring the horses down when they're broken.\"    \"Are you going to leave Silvermane with me?\" asked Jack.    \"Surely. Why, in three days, if I don't lose my guess, he'll be like a  lamb. Those desert stallions can be made into the finest kind of saddle-  horses. I've seen one or two. I want you to stay up here with the sheep.  You're getting well, you'll soon be a strapping big fellow. Then when we  drive the sheep down in the fall you can begin life on the cattle  ranges, driving wild steers. There's where you'll grow lean and hard,  like an iron bar. You'll need that horse, too, my lad.\"    \"Why--because he's fast?\" queried Jack, quickly answering to the implied  suggestion.    August nodded gloomily. \"I haven't the gift of revelation, but I've come  to believe Martin Cole. Holderness is building an outpost for his riders  close to Seeping Springs. He has no water. If he tries to pipe my water-  -\" The pause was not a threat; it implied the Mormon's doubt of himself.  \"Then Dene is on the march this way. He's driven some of Marshall's  cattle from the range next to mine. Dene got away with about a hundred  head. The barefaced robber sold them in Lund to a buying company from  Salt Lake.\"    \"Is he openly an outlaw, a rustler?\" inquired Hare.    \"Everybody knows it, and he's finding White Sage and vicinity warmer  than it was. Every time he comes in he and his band shoot up things  pretty lively. Now the Mormons are slow to wrath. But they are  awakening. All the way from Salt Lake to the border outlaws have come  in. They'll never get the power on this desert that they had in the  places from which they've been driven. Men of the Holderness type are  more to be dreaded. He's a rancher, greedy, unscrupulous, but hard to  corner in dishonesty. Dene is only a bad man, a gun-fighter. He and all  his ilk will get run out of Utah. Did you ever hear of Plummer, John  Slade, Boone Helm, any of those bad men?\"    \"No.\"    \"Well, they were men to fear. Plummer was a sheriff in Idaho, a man high  in the estimation of his townspeople, but he was the leader of the most  desperate band of criminals ever known in the West; and he instigated  the murder of, or killed outright, more than one hundred men. Slade was  a bad man, fatal on the draw. Helm was a killing machine. These men all  tried Utah, and had to get out. So will Dene have to get out. But I'm  afraid there'll be warm times before that happens. When you get in the  thick of it you'll appreciate Silvermane.\"    \"I surely will. But I can't see that wild stallion with a saddle and a  bridle, eating oats like any common horse, and being led to water.\"    \"Well, he'll come to your whistle, presently, if I'm not greatly  mistaken. You must make him love you, Jack. It can be done with any wild  creature. Be gentle, but firm. Teach him to obey the slightest touch of  rein, to stand when you throw your bridle on the ground, to come at your  whistle. Always remember this. He's a desert-bred horse; he can live on  scant browse and little water. Never break him of those best virtues in  a horse. Never feed him grain if you can find a little patch of browse;  never give him a drink till he needs it. That's one-tenth as often as a  tame horse. Some day you'll be caught in the desert, and with these  qualities of endurance Silvermane will carry you out.\"    Silvermane snorted defiance from the cedar corral next morning when the  Naabs, and Indians, and Hare appeared. A half-naked sinewy Navajo with a  face as changeless as a bronze mask sat astride August's blindfolded  roan, Charger. He rode bareback except for a blanket strapped upon the  horse; he carried only a long, thick halter, with a loop and a knot.  When August opened the improvised gate, with its sharp bayonet-like  branches of cedar, the Indian rode into the corral. The watchers climbed  to the knoll. Silvermane snorted a blast of fear and anger. August's  huge roan showed uneasiness; he stamped, and shook his head, as if to  rid himself of the blinders.    Into the farthest corner of densely packed cedar boughs Silvermane  pressed himself and watched. The Indian rode around the corral, circling  closer and closer, yet appearing not to see the stallion. Many rounds he  made; closer he got, and always with the same steady gait. Silvermane  left his corner and tried another. The old unwearying round brought  Charger and the Navajo close by him. Silvermane pranced out of his  thicket of boughs; he whistled; he wheeled with his shiny hoofs lifting.  In an hour the Indian was edging the outer circle of the corral, with  the stallion pivoting in the centre, ears laid back, eyes shooting  sparks, fight in every line of him. And the circle narrowed inward.    Suddenly the Navajo sent the roan at Silvermane and threw his halter. It  spread out like a lasso, and the loop went over the head of the  stallion, slipped to the knot and held fast, while the rope tightened.  Silvermane leaped up, forehoofs pawing the air, and his long shrill cry  was neither whistle, snort, nor screech, but all combined. He came down,  missing Charger with his hoofs, sliding off his haunches. The Indian,  his bronze muscles rippling, close-hauled on the rope, making half  hitches round his bony wrist.    In a whirl of dust the roan drew closer to the gray, and Silvermane  began a mad race around the corral. The roan ran with him nose to nose.  When Silvermane saw he could not shake him, he opened his jaws, rolled  back his lip in an ugly snarl, his white teeth glistening, and tried to  bite. But the Indian's moccasined foot shot up under the stallion's ear  and pressed him back. Then the roan hugged Silvermane so close that half  the time the Navajo virtually rode two horses. But for the rigidity of  his arms, and the play and sudden tension of his leg-muscles, the  Indian's work would have appeared commonplace, so dexterous was he, so  perfectly at home in his dangerous seat. Suddenly he whooped and August  Naab hauled back the gate, and the two horses, neck and neck, thundered  out upon the level stretch.    \"Good!\" cried August. \"Let him rip now, Navvy. All over but the work,  Jack. I feared Silvermane would spear himself on some of those dead  cedar spikes in the corral. He's safe now.\"    Jack watched the horses plunge at breakneck speed down the stretch,  circle at the forest edge, and come tearing back. Silvermane was pulling  the roan faster than he had ever gone in his life, but the dark Indian  kept his graceful seat. The speed slackened on the second turn, and  decreased as, mile after mile, the imperturbable Indian held roan and  gray side to side and let them run.    The time passed, but Hare's interest in the breaking of the stallion  never flagged. He began to understand the Indian, and to feel what the  restraint and drag must be to the horse. Never for a moment could  Silvermane elude the huge roan, the tight halter, the relentless Navajo.  Gallop fell to trot, and trot to jog, and jog to walk; and hour by hour,  without whip or spur or word, the breaker of desert mustangs drove the  wild stallion. If there were cruelty it was in his implacable slow  patience, his farsighted purpose. Silvermane would have killed himself  in an hour; he would have cut himself to pieces in one headlong dash,  but that steel arm suffered him only to wear himself out. Late that  afternoon the Navajo led a dripping, drooping, foam-lashed stallion into  the corral, tied him with the halter, and left him.    Later Silvermane drank of the water poured into the corral trough, and  had not the strength or spirit to resent the Navajo's caressing hand on  his mane.    Next morning the Indian rode again into the corral on blindfolded  Charger. Again he dragged Silvermane out on the level and drove him up  and down with remorseless, machine-like persistence. At noon he took him  back, tied him up, and roped him fast. Silvermane tried to rear and  kick, but the saddle went on, strapped with a flash of the dark-skinned  hands. Then again Silvermane ran the level stretch beside the giant  roan, only he carried a saddle now. At the first, he broke out with free  wild stride as if to run forever from under the hateful thing. But as  the afternoon waned he crept weariedly back to the corral.    On the morning of the third day the Navajo went into the corral without  Charger, and roped the gray, tied him fast, and saddled him. Then he  loosed the lassoes except the one around Silvermane's neck, which he  whipped under his foreleg to draw him down. Silvermane heaved a groan  which plainly said "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12625"],[0,"Architecture and Democracy (#18)"],[1,"masses,  but the brightest, strongest colors may be used with safety in units  of sufficiently restricted size. For harmony, as well as for richness,  the law of complementaries, in its most general application, is  the safest of all guides, but it must be followed with fine  discrimination. Complementary colors are like married pairs, if they  find the right adjustment with one another they are happy--that is,  there is an effect of beauty--but lacking such adjustment they are  worse off together than apart. Every artist who experiments in color  soon finds out for himself that instead of using two colors directly  complementary, it is better to \"split\" one of them, that is, use  instead of one of them two others, which combined will yield the  color in question. For example, the color complementary to red is  green-blue. Now green-blue is equidistant between yellow-green and  blue-violet, so if for red and blue-green; red, yellow-green and  blue-violet be substituted the combination loses its obviousness and  a certain harshness without losing anything of its brilliance, or  without departing from the optical law involved. Such a combination  corresponds to a diminished triad in music.    Another important consideration with regard to color as employed by  the architect dwells in those optical changes effected by distance and  position: the relative visibility of different colors and combinations  of colors as the spectator recedes from them, and the environmental  changes which colors undergo--in bright sunlight, in shadow, against  the sky, and with relation to backgrounds of different sorts.    The effect of distance is to make colors merge into one another, to  lower the values, but not all equally. Yellow loses itself first,  tending toward white. The effect of distance, in general, is to  disintegrate and decompose, thus giving \"vibration\" as it is called. A  knowledge of these and kindred facts will save the architect from many  disappointments and enable him to obtain wonderful chromatic effects  by simple means.    Many architects unused to color problems design their ornament with  very little thought about the colors which they propose to employ,  making it an after-consideration; but the two things should be  considered synchronously for the best final effect. There is a cryptic  saying that \"color is at right angles to form,\" that is, color is  capable of making surfaces advance toward or recede from the eye, just  as modelling does; and for this reason, if color is used, a great deal  of modelling may be dispensed with. If a receding color is used on a  recessed plane, it deepens that plane unduly; while on the other hand  if a color which refuses to recede--like yellow for example--is used  where depth is wanted, the receding plane and the approaching color  neutralize one another, resulting in an effect of flatness not  intended. The tyro should not complicate his problem by combining  color with high relief modelling, bringing inevitably in the element  of light and shade. He should leave that for older hands and concern  himself rather with flat or nearly flat surfaces, using his modelling  much as the worker in cloisonne uses his little rims of brass--to  confine and define each color within its own allotted area. Then,  as he gains experience, he may gradually enrich his pattern by the  addition of the element of light and shade, should he so decide.    Now as to certain general considerations in relation to the  appropriate and logical use of ceramics in the construction and  adornment of buildings, exterior and interior. In our northern  latitudes care should be taken that ceramics are not used in places  and in ways where the accumulation of snow and ice render the joints  subject to alternate freezing and thawing, for in such case, unless  the joints are protected with metal, the units will work loose in  time. On vertical surfaces such protection is not necessary; the use  of ceramics should therefore be confined for the most part to such  surfaces: for friezes, panels, door and window architraves, and the  like. When it is desirable for aesthetic reasons to tie a series of  windows together vertically by means of some \"fill\" of a material  different from that of the body of the wall, ceramics lend themselves  admirably to the purpose--better than wood, which rots; than iron,  which rusts; than bronze, which turns black; and than marble, which  soon loses its color and texture in exposed situations of this sort.    On the interior of buildings, the most universal use of ceramics is,  of course, for floors, and with the non-slip devices of various sorts  which have come into the market, they are no less good for stairs.  There is nothing better for wainscoting, and in fact for any surface  whatsoever subject to soil and wear. These materials combine permanent  protection and permanent decoration. But fired by the zeal of the  convert the use of ceramics may be overdone. One easily recalls  entire rooms of this material, floors, walls, ceilings, which are less  successful than as though a variety of materials had been employed. It  is just such variety--each material treated in a characteristic, and  therefore different way--that gives charm to so many foreign churches  and cathedrals: walls of stone, floors of marble, choir-stalls of  carved wood, and rood-screen of metal: it is the difference between  an orchestra of various instruments and a mandolin orchestra or a  saxaphone sextette. Ceramics should never invade the domain of the  plasterer, the mural painter, the cabinet maker. Do not let us, in  our zeal for ceramics, be like Bottom the weaver, eager to play every  part.    Ceramics have, as regards architecture, a distinct and honorable  function. This function should be recognized, taken advantage of, but  never overpassed. They offer opportunities large but not limitless.  They constitute one instrument of the orchestra of which the architect  is the conductor, an instrument beautiful in the hands of a master,  and doubly beautiful in concert and contrast with those other  materials whose harmonious ensemble makes that music in three  dimensions: architectural art.          SYMBOLS AND SACRAMENTS      Architecture is the concrete presentment in space of the soul of a  people. If that soul be petty and sordid--\"stirred like a child  by little things\"--no great architecture is possible because great  architecture can image only greatness. Before any worthy architecture  can arise in the modern world the soul must be aroused. The cannons  of Europe are bringing about this awakening. The world--the world of  thought and emotion from whence flow acts and events--is no longer  decrepit, but like Swedenborg's angels it is advancing toward the  springtide of its youth: down the ringing grooves of change \"we sweep  into the younger day.\"    After the war we are likely to witness an art evolution which will  not be restricted to statues and pictures and insincere essays in  dry-as-dust architectural styles, but one which will permeate the  whole social fabric, and make it palpitate with the rhythm of a  younger, a more abundant life. Beauty and mystery will again make  their dwelling among men; the Voiceless will speak in music, and the  Formless will spin rhythmic patterns on the loom of space. We shall  seek and find a new language of symbols to express the joy of the  soul, freed from the thrall of an iron age of materialism, and  fronting the unimaginable splendors of the spiritual life.    [Illustration: PLATE XV. SYMBOL OF RESURRECTION]    For every aesthetic awakening is the result of a spiritual awakening  of some sort. Every great religious movement found an art expression  eloquent of it. When religion languished, such things as Versailles  and the Paris Opera House were possible, but not such things as the  Parthenon, or Notre Dame. The temples of Egypt were built for the  celebration of the rites of the religion of Egypt; so also in the  case of Greece. Roman architecture was more widely secular, but Rome's  noblest monument, the Pantheon, was a religious edifice. The Moors,  inflamed with religious ardor, swept across Europe, blazing their  trail with mosques and palaces conceived seemingly in some ecstatic  state of dream. The Renaissance, tainted though it was by worldliness,  found still its inspiration in sacred themes, and recorded  its beginning and its end in two mighty religious monuments:  Brunelleschi's and Michael Angelo's domical churches, \"wrought in a  sad sincerity\" by deeply religious men. Gothic art is a synonym for  mediaeval Christianity; while in the Orient art is scarcely secular at  all, but a symbolical language framed and employed for the expression  of spiritual ideas.    This law, that spirituality and not materialism distils the precious  attar of great art, is permanently true and perennially applicable,  for laws of this order do not change from age to age, however various  their manifestation. The inference is plain: until we become a  religious people great architecture is far from us. We are becoming  religious in that broad sense in which churches and creeds, forms  and ceremonies, play little part. Ours is the search of the heart  for something greater than itself which is still itself; it is the  religion of brotherhood, whose creed is love, whose ritual is service.    This transformed and transforming religion of the West, the tardy  fruit of the teachings of Christ, now secretly active in the hearts  of men, will receive enrichment from many sources. Science will reveal  the manner in which the spirit weaves its seven-fold veil of illusion;  nature, freshly sensed, will yield new symbols which art will organize  into a language; out of the experience of the soul will grow new  rituals and observances. But one precious tincture of this new  religion our civilization and our past cannot supply; it is the  heritage of Asia,"]]]
