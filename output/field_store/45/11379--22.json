He sat on the porch, where  evidently he had awaited her return, and he looked anything but happy.    \"Where is dad?\" continued Columbine.    Jack motioned toward the second door, beyond which he sat, the one that  opened into the room the rancher used as a kind of office and storeroom.  As Columbine walked by Jack he grasped her skirt.    \"Columbine! you're angry?\" he said, appealingly.    \"I reckon I am,\" replied Columbine.    \"Don't go in to dad when you're that way,\" implored Jack. \"He's angry,  too--and--and--it'll only make matters worse.\"    From long experience Columbine could divine when Jack had done something  in the interest of self and then had awakened to possible consequences.  She pulled away from him without replying, and knocked on the  office door.    \"Come in,\" called the rancher.    Columbine went in. \"Hello, dad! Do you want me?\"    Belllounds sat at an old table, bending over a soiled ledger, with a  stubby pencil in his huge hand. When he looked up Columbine gave a  little start.    \"Where've you been?\" he asked, gruffly.    \"I've been calling on Mrs. Andrews,\" replied Columbine.    \"Did you go thar to see her?\"    \"Why--certainly!\" answered Columbine, with a slow break in her speech.    \"You didn't go to meet Wilson Moore?\"    \"No.\"    \"An' I reckon you'll say you hadn't heerd he was there?\"    \"I had not,\" flashed Columbine.    \"Wal, _did_ you see him?\"    \"Yes, sir, I did, but quite by accident.\"    \"Ahuh! Columbine, are you lyin' to me?\"    The hot blood flooded to Columbine's cheeks, as if she had been struck a  blow.    \"_Dad_!\" she cried, in hurt amaze.    Belllounds seemed thick, imponderable, as if something had forced a  crisis in him and his brain was deeply involved. The habitual, cool,  easy, bold, and frank attitude in the meeting of all situations seemed  to have been encroached upon by a break, a bewilderment, a lessening of  confidence.    \"Wal, are you lyin'?\" he repeated, either blind to or unaware of her  distress.    \"I could not--lie to you,\" she faltered, \"even--if--I wanted to.\"    The heavy, shadowed gaze of his big eyes was bent upon her as if she had  become a new and perplexing problem.    \"But you seen Moore?\"    \"Yes--sir.\" Columbine's spirit rose.    \"An' talked with him?\"    \"Of course.\"    \"Lass, I ain't likin' thet, an' I ain't likin' the way you look an'  speak.\"    \"I am sorry. I can't help either.\"    \"What'd this cowboy say to you?\"    \"We talked mostly about his injured foot.\"    \"An' what else?\" went on Belllounds, his voice rising.    \"About--what he meant to do now.\"    \"Ahuh! An' thet's homesteadin' the Sage Creek Valley?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Did you want him to do thet?\"    \"I! Indeed I didn't.\"    \"Columbine, not so long ago you told me this fellar wasn't sweet on you.  An' do you still say that to me--are you still insistin' he ain't in  love with you?\"    \"He never said so--I never believed it ... and now I'm sure--he isn't!\"    \"Ahuh! Wal, thet same day you was jest as sure you didn't care anythin'  particular fer him. Are you thet sure now?\"    \"No!\" whispered Columbine, very low. She trembled with a suggestion of  unknown forces. Not to save a new and growing pride would she evade any  question from this man upon whom she had no claim, to whom she owed her  life and her bringing up. But something cold formed in her.    Belllounds, self-centered and serious as he strangely was, seemed to  check his probing, either from fear of hearing more from her or from an  awakening of former kindness. But her reply was a shock to him, and,  throwing down his pencil with the gesture of a man upon whom decision  was forced, he rose to tower over her.    \"You've been like a daughter to me. I've done all I knowed how fer you.  I've lived up to the best of my lights. An' I've loved you,\" he said,  sonorously and pathetically. \"You know what my hopes are--fer the  boy--an' fer you.... We needn't waste any more talk. From this minnit  you're free to do as you like. Whatever you do won't make any change in  my carin' fer you.... But you gotta decide. Will you marry Jack or not?\"    \"I promised you--I would. I'll keep my word,\" replied Columbine,  steadily.    \"So far so good,\" went on the rancher. \"I'm respectin' you fer what you  say.... An' now, _when_ will you marry him?\"    The little room drifted around in Columbine's vague, blank sight. All  seemed to be drifting. She had no solid anchor.    \"Any--day you say--the sooner the--better,\" she whispered.    \"Wal, lass, I'm thankin' you,\" he replied, with voice that sounded afar  to her. \"An' I swear, if I didn't believe it's best fer Jack an' you,  why I'd never let you marry.... So we'll set the day. October first!  Thet's the day you was fetched to me a baby--more'n seventeen  years ago.\"    \"October--first--then, dad,\" she said, brokenly, and she kissed him as  if in token of what she knew she owed him. Then she went out, closing  the door behind her.    Jack, upon seeing her, hastily got up, with more than concern in his  pale face.    \"Columbine!\" he cried, hoarsely. \"How you look!... Tell me. What  happened? Girl, don't tell me you've--you've--\"    \"Jack Belllounds,\" interrupted Columbine, in tragic amaze at this truth  about to issue from her lips, \"I've promised to marry you--on  October first.\"    He let out a shout of boyish exultation and suddenly clasped her in his  arms. But there was nothing boyish in the way he handled her, in the  almost savage evidence of possession. \"Collie, I'm mad about you,\" he  began, ardently. \"You never let me tell you. And I've grown worse and  worse. To-day I--when I saw you going down there--where that Wilson  Moore is--I got terribly jealous. I was sick. I'd been glad to kill  him!... It made me see how I loved you. Oh, I didn't know. But now ...  Oh, I'm mad for you!\" He crushed her to him, unmindful of her struggles;  his face and neck were red; his eyes on fire. And he began trying to  kiss her mouth, but failed, as she struggled desperately. His kisses  fell upon cheek and ear and hair.    \"Let me--go!\" panted Columbine. \"You've no--no--Oh, you might have  waited.\" Breaking from him, she fled, and got inside her room with the  door almost closed, when his foot intercepted it.    Belllounds was half laughing his exultation, half furious at her escape,  and altogether beside himself.    \"No,\" she replied, so violently that it appeared to awake him to the  fact that there was some one besides himself to consider.    \"Aw!\" He heaved a deep sigh. \"All right. I won't try to get in. Only  listen.... Collie, don't mind my--my way of showing you how I felt. Fact  is, I went plumb off my head. Is that any wonder, you--you darling--when  I've been so scared you'd never have me? Collie, I've felt that you were  the one thing in the world I wanted most and would never get. But  now.... October first! Listen. I promise you I'll not drink any  more--nor gamble--nor nag dad for money. I don't like his way of running  the ranch, but I'll do it, as long as he lives. I'll even try to  tolerate that club-footed cowboy's brass in homesteading a ranch right  under my nose. I'll--I'll do anything you ask of me.\"    \"Then--please--go away!\" cried Columbine, with a sob.    When he was gone Columbine barred the door and threw herself upon her  bed to shut out the light and to give vent to her surcharged emotions.  She wept like a girl whose youth was ending; and after the paroxysm had  passed, leaving her weak and strangely changed, she tried to reason out  what had happened to her. Over and over again she named the appeal of  the rancher, the sense of her duty, the decision she had reached, and  the disgust and terror inspired in her by Jack Belllounds's reception of  her promise. These were facts of the day and they had made of her a  palpitating, unhappy creature, who nevertheless had been brave to face  the rancher and confess that which she had scarce confessed to herself.  But now she trembled and cringed on the verge of a catastrophe that  withheld its whole truth.    \"I begin to see now,\" she whispered, after the thought had come and gone  and returned to change again. \"If Wilson had--cared for me I--I might  have--cared, too.... But I do--care--something. I couldn't lie to dad.  Only I'm not sure--how much. I never dreamed of--of _loving_ him, or any  one. It's so strange. All at once I feel old. And I can't understand  these--these feelings that shake me.\"    So Columbine brooded over the trouble that had come to her, never  regretting her promise to the old rancher, but growing keener in the  realization of a complexity in her nature that sooner or later would  separate the life of her duty from the life of her desire. She seemed  all alone, and when this feeling possessed her a strange reminder of the  hunter Wade flashed up. She stifled another impulse to confide in him.  Wade had the softness of a woman, and his face was a record of the  trials and travails through which he had come unhardened, unembittered.  Yet how could she tell her troubles to him? A stranger, a rough man of  the wilds, whose name had preceded him, notorious and deadly, with that  vital tang of the West in its meaning! Nevertheless, Wade drew her, and  she thought of him until the recurring memory of Jack Belllounds's rude  clasp again crept over her with an augmenting disgust and fear. Must she  submit to that? Had she promised that? And then Columbine felt the  dawning of realities.        CHAPTER VII    Columbine was awakened in the gray dawn by the barking of coyotes. She  dreaded the daylight thus heralded. Never before in her life had she  hated the rising of the sun. Resolutely she put the past behind her and  faced the future, believing now that with the great decision made she  needed only to keep her mind off what might have been, and to attend  to her duty.    At breakfast she found the rancher in better spirits than he had been  for weeks. He informed her "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13941"],[0,"The Divine Right of Church Government (#18)"],[1,"him that  superlative commendation above all kings before and after him, ver. 25.    2. Countenanceth, advanceth, and encourageth by his authority and  example the public exercise of all God's ordinances, and duties of  religion within his dominions, whether in matter of divine worship,  discipline, and government, maintaining for the Church the fulness of  spiritual liberties and privileges communicated to her from Christ: as  did Asa, 2 Chron. xv. 9-16: Jehoshaphat, 2 Chron. xx. 7-9: Hezekiah, 2  Chron. xxix., xxx., and xxxi. chapters throughout: Josiah, 2 Chron.  xxxiv. and xxxv. chapters. And to this end God prescribed in the law  that the king should still have a copy of the law of God by him, therein  to read continually, Deut. xvii. 18-20; because he was to be not only a  practiser, but also a protector thereof, a keeper of both tables.    3. Supplies the Church with all external necessaries, provisions, means,  and worldly helps in matters of religion: as convenient public places to  worship in, sufficient maintenance for ministers, (as the Scripture  requireth, 1 Tim. v. 17, 18; 1 Cor. ix. 6-15; Gal. vi. 6:) schools and  colleges, for promoting of literature, as nurseries to the prophets,  &c.; together with the peaceable and effectual enjoyment of all these  worldly necessaries, for comfortably carrying on of all public  ordinances of Christ. Thus David prepared materials, but Solomon built  the temple, 1 Chron. xxii. Hezekiah commanded the people that dwelt in  Jerusalem, to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they  might be encouraged in the law of the Lord; and Hezekiah himself and his  princes came and saw it performed, 2 Chron. xxxi. 4, &c., 8: Josiah  repaired the house of God, 2 Chron. xxxiv.    Nor need the magistrate think scorn, but rather count it his honor to be  an earthly protector of the Church, which is the _body of Christ, the  Lamb's wife_, for redeeming of which Christ died, and for gathering and  perfecting of which the very world is continued.    An ordering, regulating power is also allowed to the magistrate about  ecclesiastical matters in a political way, so that he warrantably,    1. Reforms the Church, when corrupted in divine worship, discipline, or  government: as did Moses, Exod. xxxii.; Joshua, Josh. xxiv.; Asa, 2  Chron. xv.; Jehoshaphat, 2 Chron. xvii.; Hezekiah, 2 Kings xviii.;  Josiah, 2 Kings xxiii.; 2 Chron. xxxiv.    2. Convenes or convocates synods and councils, made up of ecclesiastical  persons, to consult, advise, and conclude determinatively, according to  the word, how the church is to be reformed and refined from corruptions,  and how to be guided and governed when reformed, &c. For, 1. Pious  magistrates under the Old Testament called the Church together, convened  councils. David, about bringing back the ark, 1 Chron. xiii. 1, 2, and  another council when he was old, 1 Chron. xiii. 1; Solomon, 1 Kings  viii. 1; Hezekiah, 2 Chron. xxix. 4; and Josiah, 2 Kings xxiii. 1, 2. 2.  All ought to be subject to superior powers, who ought to procure the  public peace and prosperity of the Church, Rom. xiii. 1, 2, &c.; 1 Pet.  ii. 13, &c., 17; 1 Tim. ii. 2. Therefore superior powers may convocate  councils. 3. Christian magistrates called the four general councils:  Constantine the first Nicene council; Theodosius, senior, the first  council of Constantinople; Theodosius, junior, the first Ephesian  council; Marcian Emperor, the Chalcedon council; and, 4. Hereunto  antiquity subscribes, as Dr. Whitaker observes.    3. Supports the laws of God with his secular authority, as a keeper of  the tables, enjoining and commanding, under civil penalties, all under  his dominion, strictly and inviolably to observe the same: as \"Josiah  made all that were present in Israel to serve the Lord their God,\" 2  Chron. xxxiv. 33. Nehemiah made the sabbath to be sanctified, and  strange wives to be put away, Neb. xii. 13, &c. Yea, Nebuchadnezzar, a  heathen king, decreed, that \"Whosoever should speak amiss of the God of  Shadrach,\" &c., \"should be cut in pieces, and their houses made a  dunghill,\" Dan. iii. 28, 29. And Darius decreed, \"That in every dominion  of his kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel,\" &c., Dan.  vi. 26, 27.    And as he strengthens the laws and ordinances of God by his civil  authority, so he ratifies and establishes within his dominions the just  and necessary decrees of the Church in synods and councils (which are  agreeable to God's word) by his civil sanction.    4. Judges and determines definitively with a consequent political  judgment, or judgment of political discretion, concerning the things  judged and determined antecedently by the Church, in reference to his  own act. Whether he will approve such ecclesiasticals or not; and in  what manner he will so approve, or do otherwise by his public authority;  for he is not a brutish agent, (as papists would have him,) to do  whatsoever the Church enjoins him unto blind obedience, but is to act  prudently and knowingly in all his office; and therefore the judgment of  discerning (which belongs to every Christian, for the well-ordering of  his own act) cannot be denied to the Christian magistrate, in respect of  his office.    5. Takes care politically, that even matters and ordinances merely and  formally ecclesiastical, be duly managed by ecclesiastical persons  orderly called thereto. Thus Hezekiah commanded the priests and Levites  to do their duties, 2 Chron. xxix. 5, 24, and the people to do theirs, 2  Chron. xxx. 1; and for this he is commended, that therein he did cleave  unto the Lord, and observed his precepts which he had commanded Moses, 2  Kings xviii. 6. Thus when the king is commanded to observe and do all  the precepts of the law, the Lord (as orthodox divines do judge)  intended that he should keep them, not only as a private man, but as a  king, by using all care and endeavor that all his subjects with him  perform all duties to God and man, Deut. xvii. 18-20.    6. A compulsive, coactive, punitive, or corrective power, formally  political, is also granted to the political magistrate in matters of  religion, in reference to all sorts of persons and things under his  jurisdiction. He may politically compel the outward man of all persons,  church officers, or others under his dominions, unto external  performance of their respective duties, and offices in matters of  religion, punishing them, if either they neglect to do their duty at  all, or do it corruptly, not only against equity and sobriety, contrary  to the second table, but against truth and piety, contrary to the first  table of the decalogue. We have sufficient intimation of the  magistrate's punitive power in cases against the second table; as the  stubborn and rebellious, incorrigible son, that was a glutton and a  drunkard, sinning against the fifth commandment, was to be stoned to  death, Deut. xxi. 18-21. The murderer, sinning against the sixth  commandment, was to be punished with death, Gen. ix. 6; Numb. xxxv.  30-34; Deut. x. 11-13. The unclean person, sinning against the seventh  commandment, was to be punished with death, Lev. xx. 11, 12, 14, 17,  19-25; and before that, see Gen. xxxviii. 24. Yea, Job, who is thought  to live before Moses, and before this law was made, intimates that  adultery is a heinous crime, yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by  the judges, Job xxxi. 9,11. The thief, sinning against the eighth  commandment, was to be punished by restitution, Exod. xxii. 1, 15, &c.  The false witness, sinning against the ninth commandment, was to be  dealt withal as he would have had his brother dealt with, by the law of  retaliation, Deut. xix. 16, to the end of the chapter, &c. Yea, the  magistrate's punitive power is extended also to offences against the  first table; whether these offences be against the first commandment, by  false prophets teaching lies, errors, and heresies in the name of the  Lord, endeavoring to seduce people from the true God. \"If there arise  among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, that prophet, or that  dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he hath spoken to turn  you away from the Lord your God, which brought you out of the land of  Egypt,\" &c., Deut. xiii. 1-6. From which place Calvin notably asserts  the punitive power of magistrates against false prophets and impostors  that would draw God's people to a defection from the true God, showing  that this power also belongs to the Christian magistrate in like cases  now under the gospel.    Yea, in case of such seducement from God, though by nearest allies,  severe punishment was to be inflicted upon the seducer, Deut. xiii.  6-12. See also ver. 12, to the end of the chapter, how a city is to be  punished in the like case. And Mr. Burroughs,[27] in his Irenicum, shows  that this place of Deut. xiii. 6, &c., belongs even to us under the  gospel.    Or whether these offences be against the second commandment, the  magistrate's punitive power reaches them, Deut. xvii. 1-8; Lev. xvii.  2-8; 2 Chron. xvi. 13, 16. \"Maachah, the mother of Asa the king, he  removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove.\" Job  xxxi. 26-28, herewith compare Exod. viii. 25, 26. Or whether the  offences be against the third commandment, \"And thou shalt speak unto  the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth God shall bear his  sin: and he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord he shall surely be put  to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him, as well  the stranger as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the  name of the Lord shall be put to death,\" Lev. xxiv. 15, 16. Yea, the  heathen king Nebuchadnezzar made a notable decree to this purpose,  against blaspheming God, saying, \"I make a decree, that every people,  nation, and language, who speak any thing amiss against the God of  Shadrach, Meshech, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their  houses shall"]]]
