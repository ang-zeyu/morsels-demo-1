To quote Goethe, \"having recognized the fact,  it still remains for us to see how it developed.\" Let us now  consider this point.    Three things were necessary before these Gregorian chants  could develop at all: (1) A simple, clean-cut musical scale  or systematized table of musical sounds. (2) Some definite  manner of symbolizing sounds, so that they could be accurately  expressed in writing. (3) A cultivation of the sense of  hearing, in order that mankind might learn to distinguish  between sounds that are discordant and those that sound well  together; in other words, harmony.    We will begin with the scale, and review what we know of the  Greek modes in order to show how they were amalgamated into  our present octave system of scales.

The chromatic and enharmonic styles had been  abandoned in theory, the portamento which the singers introduced  into their chants being the only principle retained. The new  system was as follows:        [F8: g, a, b,  G8: c d e f g a b c' d' e' f' g' a']      [First nine notes labelled:       Hypoion., Hypodor., Hypophryg., Hypolyd./Ionian,       Hypo-mixolyd./Dorian, Hypoaeol./Phryg., Lyd., Mixolyd., Aeol.]    In order to complete the story of the evolution of scales and  clefs, we must add that the Flemish monk, Hucbald (900 A.D.),  divided this scale into regular tetrachords, beginning at  G, with the succession, tone, semitone, tone, forming four  disjunct tetrachords,        [F: (g, a, b-, c) (d e f g) (a b c' d') G: (e' f+' g' a')]    This division remained without influence on the development  of the scale.    The first change in the _tetrachord_ system of reckoning  tones and dividing the scale was made by Guido d'Arezzo (first  half of eleventh century), who divided it into hexachords or  groups of six notes each. Up to that time, each note of the  scale had had a letter of the alphabet for its symbol. It was  Guido who conceived the idea of using syllables for these  notes. The story of how it occurred to him is well known:  On one occasion, hearing his brethren in the monastery choir  of Arezzo, in Tuscany, sing a hymn to St. John the Baptist, he  noticed that the first syllable of each line came on regularly  ascending notes of the scale, the first syllable coming on C,  the first of the next line on D, the first of the third on E,  etc., up to A on the sixth line. As all these syllables happened  to differ one from the other, and, moreover, were very easy  to sing, he hit upon the idea of using them to distinguish  the notes on which they fell in the hymn.        [F:  c   d  f   (d e) d |  d  d c d  e  e   ]      [W: _Ut_ queant laxis   | _Re_sonare fibris ]      [F: (e f g) e (d e) c d |  f  g a  (g f) d d]      [W: _Mi_ra    gestorum  | _Fa_muli tuorum   ]      [F: (g a g) e f  g d  |  a  g a f (g a) a | (g f) d c e d  ]      [W: _Sol_ve   polluti | _La_bii reatum    | Sancte  Joannes]    Furthermore, as there were six of these syllables, he arranged  the musical scale in groups of six notes instead of four,  hexachords instead of tetrachords. Commencing with G, which  was the lowest note of the system in Hucbald's time, the first  hexachord was formed of G A B C D E; the second, following the  example of the Greeks, he made to overlap the first, namely,  C D E F G A; the third, likewise overlapping the second,  commenced on F. In order to make this hexachord identical  in structure with, the first and second, he flatted the B,  thus making the succession of notes, F G A B[flat] C D. The  next three hexachords were repetitions of the first three,  namely, G A B C D E, C D E F G A, F G A B[flat] C D; the last  was again a repetition of the first, G A B C D E.      THE GAMUT.

From this we get our word for the scale,  the gamut. The other notes remained the same as before, only  that for the lowest octave capital letters were used; in the  next octave, the notes were designated by small letters, and  in the last octave by double letters, aa, bb, etc., as in the  following example.      [F: g,  g     G: a  g'         | a'  g''                     ]    [W: Capitals.  : Small letters | Double or very small letters]      PRESENT SCALE.        [F: c,,    | c,    | c    G: c'  | c'' | c''' | c'''']      [W: C_     | C     | c     : c'  | c'' | c''' | c'''']      [W: Contra | Great | Small : 1st | 2nd | 3rd  | 4th  ]    Following out his system, he applied the newly acquired  syllables to each of the hexachords--for instance, the lowest  hexachord, G A B C D E, which was called hard, became _ut re  mi fa sol la_; the second, which was called natural, C D E F  G A, also became _ut re mi fa sol la_; and the third, which  was called soft, F G A B[flat] C D, became likewise _ut re mi  fa sol la_. The next three hexachords were treated in the same  manner; the last or seventh hexachord was merely a repetition  of the first and the fourth.    Now in the hymns, and also in the sequences, as they were called  (which were simply a series of notes forming a little melody  sung to two or three words), the voice was rarely called upon  to progress more than the interval of a sixth, and so this  solmization, as the new system was called, was very valuable;  for one had only to give the pitch, and _ut_ always meant the  keynote, _re_ the second, _mi_ the third, etc., etc. In time  _ut_ was found to be a difficult syllable to sing, and _do_  was substituted. This change, however, was made after the scale  was divided into a system of octaves instead of hexachords. The  improvement in singing soon made the limits of the hexachords  too small to be practical; therefore another syllable was added  to the hexachordal system, _si_, and with this seventh note  we have our modern scale. From this we see that the scale in  present use is composed of octaves, just as the older scales  were composed of hexachords, and before that tetrachords. Just  as in mediaeval times each hexachord commenced with _ut_,  so now every octave of our tonal system commences with _do_.    Before leaving the hexachordal system, it may be as well to  explain the mode of procedure when the voice had to go beyond  the interval of the sixth. We know that the first of every set  of six notes was called _ut_, the second, _re_, the third,  _mi_, etc. When the voice had to go beyond _la_, the sixth  note, to B[natural], that sixth note was always called _re_,  and was considered the second note of a new hexachord. If,  on the other hand, the voice had to go beyond _a_, to B[flat],  the fifth note was called _re_, since the syllables _mi fa_  must always come on the half-tone.    In a study of our system of writing music, it may be as well to  begin with the derivation of our sharps and flats. Observing  the third hexachord on our list we see that in order to make  it identical in structure with the first and second, the B had  to be lowered a semitone. Now the third hexachord was called  soft. The B[flat] in it was accordingly called a soft B or  B _molle_, which is still the name in France for a flat, and  _moll_ in German still means minor, or \"soft\" or \"lowered.\" For  the fourth hexachord, which was called hard, this B was again  raised a semitone. But the flatted B was already indicated  by the letter _b_ or round _b_, as it was called; hence this  B natural was given a _square_ shape and called B _carre_,  [illustration]. The present French word for natural (when it  is specially marked) is _becarre_; the German word for major  also comes indirectly from this, for _dur_ means \"hard.\"    An explanation of the modern German names for notes will be  easily understood in this connection. In the German nomenclature  the letters of the alphabet stand for the notes of the scale  as in the English, with the exception of B. This B, or \"round\"  B, in the German system stands for B[flat], which is more  logical than our English usage, since our flat is merely a  slightly modified form of _b_. The German B natural is our  letter _h_, which is merely a corruption of the square _b_,  [illustration], which by the addition of a line in time  became our [natural]. The Germans have carried the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16358"],[0,"The English Gipsies and Their Language (#18)"],[1,"Oriental.  I have found  that, without exception, there is a disposition among most people to  promptly declare that all these words were taken, \"of course,\" from  English slang.  Thus, when I heard a Gipsy speak of his fist as a  \"puncher,\" I naturally concluded that he did so because he regarded its  natural use to be to \"punch\" heads with.  But on asking him why he gave  it that name, he promptly replied, \"Because it takes pange (five) fingers  to make a fist.\"  And since _panja_ means in Hindustani a hand with the  five fingers extended, it is no violent assumption to conclude that even  _puncher_ may owe quite as much to Hindustani as to English, though I  cheerfully admit that it would perhaps never have existed had it not been  for English associations.  Thus a Gipsy calls a pedlar a _packer_ or  _pack-mush_.  Now, how much of this word is due to the English word pack  or packer, and how much to _paikar_, meaning in Hindustani a pedlar?  I  believe that there has been as much of the one as of the other, and that  this doubly-formative influence, or _influence of continuation_, should  be seriously considered as regards all Rommany words which resemble in  sound others of the same meaning, either in Hindustani or in English.  It  should also be observed that the Gipsy, while he is to the last degree  inaccurate and a blunderer as regards _English_ words (a fact pointed out  long ago by the Rev. Mr Crabb), has, however, retained with great  persistence hundreds of Hindu terms.  Not being very familiar with  peasant English, I have generally found Gipsies more intelligible in  Rommany than in the language of their \"stepfather-land,\" and have often  asked my principal informant to tell me in Gipsy what I could not  comprehend in \"Anglo-Saxon.\"    \"To pitch together\" does not in English mean to stick together, although  _pitch_ sticks, but it does in Gipsy; and in Hindustani, _pichchi_ means  sticking or adhering.  I find in all cases of such resemblance that the  Gipsy word has invariably a closer affinity as regards meaning to the  Hindu than to the English, and that its tendencies are always rather  Oriental than Anglo-Saxon.  As an illustration, I may point out _piller_  (English Gipsy) to attack, having an affinity in _pilna_ (Hindustani),  with the same meaning.  Many readers will at once revert to _pill_,  _piller_, and _pillage_--all simply _implying_ attack, but really meaning  to _rob_, or robbery.  But _piller_ in English Gipsy also means, as in  Hindustani, to assault indecently; and this is almost conclusive as to  its Eastern origin.    It is remarkable that the Gipsies in England, or all the world over,  have, like the Hindus, a distinctly descriptive expression for every  degree of relationship.  Thus a _pivli beebee_ in English Gipsy, or  _pupheri bahim_ in Hindustani, is a father's sister's daughter.  This in  English, as in French or German, is simply a cousin.    _Quod_, imprisonment, is an old English cant and Gipsy word which Mr  Hotten attempts to derive from a college quadrangle; but when we find  that the Hindu _quaid_ also means confinement, the probability is that it  is to it we owe this singular term.    There are many words in which it is evident that the Hindu Gipsy meaning  has been shifted from a cognate subject.  Thus _putti_, the hub of a  wheel in Gipsy, means the felly of a wheel in Hindustani.  _Kaizy_, to  rub a horse down, or scrape him, in the original tongue signifies \"to tie  up a horse's head by passing the bridle to his tail,\" to prevent his  kicking while being rubbed or 'scraped.  _Quasur_, or _kasur_, is in  Hindustani flame: in English Gipsy _kessur_ signifies smoke; but I have  heard a Gipsy more than once apply the same term to flame and smoke, just  as _miraben_ stands for both life and death.    Very Oriental is the word kismet, or destiny, as most of my readers are  probably aware.  It is also English Gipsy, and was explained to me as  follows: \"A man's _kismut_ is what he's bound to kair--it's the kismut of  his see.  Some men's kismut is better'n wavers, 'cos they've got more  better chiv.  Some men's kismut's to bikin grais, and some to bikin  kanis; but saw foki has their kismut, an' they can't pen chichi elsus.\"  In English, \"A man's destiny is what he is bound to do--it is the fate of  his soul (life).  Some men's destiny is better than others, because they  have more command of language.  Some are fated to sell horses, and others  to sell hens; but all people have their mission, and can do nothing  else.\"    _Quran_ in the East means the Koran, and quran uthara to take an oath.  In  English Gipsy kurran, or kurraben, is also an oath, and it seems strange  that such a word from such a source should exist in England.  It is,  however, more interesting as indicating that the Gipsies did not leave  India until familiarised with Mohammedan rule.  \"He kaired his kurran pre  the Duvel's Bavol that he would jal 'vree the tem for a besh.\"  \"He swore  his oath upon God's Breath (the Bible) that he would leave the country  for a year.\"  Upon inquiring of the Gipsy who uttered this phrase why he  called the Bible \"God's Breath,\" he replied naively, \"It's sim to the  Duvel's jivaben, just the same as His breathus.\"  \"It is like God's life,  just the same as His breath.\"    It is to be observed that _nearly all the words which Gipsies claim as  Gipsy_, _notwithstanding their resemblance to English_, _are to be found  in Hindustani_.  Thus _rutter_, to copulate, certainly resembles the  English _rut_, but it is quite as much allied to _rutana_ (Hindustani),  meaning the same thing.  \"Sass,\" or sauce, meaning in Gipsy, bold,  forward impudence, is identical with the same English word, but it agrees  very well with the Hindu _sahas_, bold, and was perhaps born of the  latter term, although it has been brought up by the former.    Dr A. F. Pott remarks of the German Gipsy word _schetra_, or violin, that  he could nowhere find in Rommany a similar instrument with an Indian  name.  Surrhingee, or sarunghee, is the common Hindu word for a violin;  and the English Gipsies, on being asked if they knew it, promptly replied  that it was \"an old word for the neck or head of a fiddle.\"  It is true  they also called it sarengro, surhingro, and shorengro, the latter word  indicating that it might have been derived from sherro-engro--_i.e_.,  \"head-thing.\"  But after making proper allowance for the Gipsy tendency,  or rather passion, for perverting words towards possible derivations, it  seems very probable that the term is purely Hindu.    Zuhru, or Zohru, means in the East Venus, or the morning star; and it is  pleasant to find a reflection of the rosy goddess in the Gipsy _soor_,  signifying \"early in the morning.\"  I have been told that there is a  Rommany word much resembling _soor_, meaning the early star, but my  informant could not give me its exact sound.  _Dood of the sala_ is the  common name for Venus.  Sunrise is indicated by the eccentric term of  \"_kam-left the panni_\" or sun-left the water.  \"It wells from the waver  tem you jin,\" said my informant, in explanation.  \"The sun comes from a  foreign country, and first leaves that land, and then leaves the sea,  before it gets here.\"    When a Gipsy is prowling for hens, or any other little waifs, and wishes  to leave a broken trail, so that his tracks may not be identified, he  will walk with the feet interlocked--one being placed outside the  other--making what in America is very naturally termed a snake-trail.  This he calls _sarserin_, and in Hindu _sarasana_ means to creep along  like a snake.    Supposing that the Hindu word for rice, _shali_, could hardly have been  lost, I asked a Gipsy if he knew it, and he at once replied, \"_Shali giv_  is small grain-corn, werry little grainuses indeed.\"    _Shalita_ in Hindustani is a canvas sack in which a tent is carried.  The  English Gipsy has confused this word with _shelter_, and yet calls a  small or \"shelter\" tent a shelter _gunno_, or bag.  \"For we rolls up the  big tent in the shelter tent, to carry it.\"  A tent cloth or canvas is in  Gipsy a _shummy_, evidently derived from the Hindu shumiyana, a canopy or  awning.    It is a very curious fact that the English Gipsies call the Scripture or  Bible the _Shaster_, and I record this with the more pleasure, since it  fully establishes Mr Borrow as the first discoverer of the word in  Rommany, and vindicates him from the suspicion with which his assertion  was received by Dr Pott.  On this subject the latter speaks as follows:--    \"Eschastra de Moyses, l. ii. 22; [Greek text], M.; Sanskrit, castra;  Hind., shastr, m.  Hindu religious books, Hindu law, Scripture,  institutes of science (Shakespeare).  In proportion to the importance of  the real existence of this word among the Gipsies must be the suspicion  with which we regard it, when it depends, as in this instance, only on  Borrow's assertion, who, in case of need, to supply a non-existing word,  may have easily taken one from the Sanskrit.\"--_Die Zigeuner_, vol. ii.  p. 224.    The word _shaster_ was given to me very distinctly by a Gipsy, who  further volunteered the information, that it not only meant the  Scriptures, but also any written book whatever, and somewhat marred the  dignity of the sublime association of the Bible and Shaster, by adding  that \"any feller's bettin'-book on the race-ground was a _shasterni lil_,  'cos it's written.\"    I have never heard of the evil eye among the lower orders of English, but  among Gipsies a belief in it is as common as among Hindus, and both  indicate it by the same word, _seer_ or _sihr_.  In India _sihr_, it is  true, is applied to enchantment or magic in general, but in this case the  whole may very well stand for a part.  I may add that my own  communications on the subject of the _jettatura_, and the proper means of  averting it by means of crab's claws, horns, and the usual sign of the  fore and"]]]
