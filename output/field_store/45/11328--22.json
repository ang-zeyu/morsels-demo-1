And they pledged each other in the tin  cups.    \"Been gettin' them instructions?\" said Mr. McLean, grinning. \"I thought  I saw yu' learning your steps through the window.\"    \"Here's your good health,\" said the Southerner. Once more they pledged  each other handsomely.    \"Did she call you an exception, or anything?\" said Lin.    \"Well, it would cipher out right close in that neighborhood.\"    \"Here's how, then!\" cried the delighted Lin, over his cup.    \"Jest because yu' happen to come from Vermont,\" continued Mr. McLean,  \"is no cause for extra pride. Shoo! I was raised in Massachusetts  myself, and big men have been raised there, too,--Daniel Webster and  Israel Putnam: and a lot of them politicians.\"    \"Virginia is a good little old state,\" observed the Southerner.    \"Both of 'em's a sight ahead of Vermont. She told me I was the first  exception she'd struck.\"    \"What rule were you provin' at the time, Lin?\"    \"Well yu' see, I started to kiss her.\"    \"Yu' didn't!\"    \"Shucks! I didn't mean nothin'.\"    \"I reckon yu' stopped mighty sudden?\"    \"Why, I'd been ridin' out with her--ridin' to school, ridin' from  school, and a-comin' and a-goin', and she chattin' cheerful and askin'  me a heap o' questions all about myself every day, and I not lyin' much  neither. And so I figured she wouldn't mind. Lots of 'em like it. But  she didn't, you bet!\"    \"No,\" said the Virginian, deeply proud of his lady who had slighted him.  He had pulled her out of the water once, and he had been her unrewarded  knight even to-day, and he felt his grievance; but he spoke not of it  to Lin; for he felt also, in memory, her arms clinging round him as he  carried her ashore upon his horse. But he muttered, \"Plumb ridiculous!\"  as her injustice struck him afresh, while the outraged McLean told his  tale.    \"Trample is what she has done on me to-night, and without notice. We was  startin' to come here; Taylor and Mrs. were ahead in the buggy, and I  was holdin' her horse, and helpin' her up in the saddle, like I done for  days and days. Who was there to see us? And I figured she'd not mind,  and she calls me an exception! Yu'd ought to've just heard her about  Western men respectin' women. So that's the last word we've spoke.  We come twenty-five miles then, she scootin' in front, and her horse  kickin' the sand in my face. Mrs. Taylor, she guessed something was up,  but she didn't tell.\"    \"Miss Wood did not tell?\"    \"Not she! She'll never open her head. She can take care of herself, you  bet!\" The fiddles sounded hilariously in the house, and the feet also.  They had warmed up altogether, and their dancing figures crossed the  windows back and forth. The two cow-punchers drew near to a window and  looked in gloomily.    \"There she goes,\" said Lin.    \"With Uncle Hughey again,\" said the Virginian, sourly. \"Yu' might  suppose he didn't have a wife and twins, to see the way he goes  gambollin' around.\"    \"Westfall is takin' a turn with her now,\" said McLean.    \"James!\" exclaimed the Virginian. \"He's another with a wife and fam'ly,  and he gets the dancin', too.\"    \"There she goes with Taylor,\" said Lin, presently.    \"Another married man!\" the Southerner commented. They prowled round to  the store-room, and passed through the kitchen to where the dancers were  robustly tramping. Miss Wood was still the partner of Mr. Taylor. \"Let's  have some whiskey,\" said the Virginian. They had it, and returned, and  the Virginian's disgust and sense of injury grew deeper. \"Old Carmody  has got her now,\" he drawled. \"He polkas like a landslide. She learns  his monkey-faced kid to spell dog and cow all the mawnin'. He'd ought to  be tucked up cosey in his bed right now, old Carmody ought.\"    They were standing in that place set apart for the sleeping children;  and just at this moment one of two babies that were stowed beneath  a chair uttered a drowsy note. A much louder cry, indeed a chorus of  lament, would have been needed to reach the ears of the parents in the  room beyond, such was the noisy volume of the dance. But in this quiet  place the light sound caught Mr. McLean's attention, and he turned to  see if anything were wrong. But both babies were sleeping peacefully.    \"Them's Uncle Hughey's twins,\" he said.    \"How do you happen to know that?\" inquired the Virginian, suddenly  interested.    \"Saw his wife put 'em under the chair so she could find 'em right off  when she come to go home.\"    \"Oh,\" said the Virginian, thoughtfully. \"Oh, find 'em right off. Yes.  Uncle Hughey's twins.\" He walked to a spot from which he could view the  dance. \"Well,\" he continued, returning, \"the schoolmarm must have taken  quite a notion to Uncle Hughey. He has got her for this quadrille.\" The  Virginian was now speaking without rancor; but his words came with a  slightly augmented drawl, and this with him was often a bad omen. He  now turned his eyes upon the collected babies wrapped in various  colored shawls and knitted work. \"Nine, ten, eleven, beautiful sleepin'  strangers,\" he counted, in a sweet voice. \"Any of 'em your'n, Lin?\"    \"Not that I know of,\" grinned Mr. McLean.    \"Eleven, twelve. This hyeh is little Christopher in the blue-stripe  quilt--or maybe that other yello'-head is him. The angels have commenced  to drop in on us right smart along Bear Creek, Lin.\"    \"What trash are yu' talkin' anyway?\"    \"If they look so awful alike in the heavenly gyarden,\" the gentle  Southerner continued, \"I'd just hate to be the folks that has the  cuttin' of 'em out o' the general herd. And that's a right quaint notion  too,\" he added softly. \"Them under the chair are Uncle Hughey's, didn't  you tell me?\" And stooping, he lifted the torpid babies and placed them  beneath a table. \"No, that ain't thorough,\" he murmured. With wonderful  dexterity and solicitude for their wellfare, he removed the loose wrap  which was around them, and this soon led to an intricate process of  exchange. For a moment Mr. McLean had been staring at the Virginian,  puzzled. Then, with a joyful yelp of enlightenment, he sprang to abet  him.    And while both busied themselves with the shawls and quilts, the  unconscious parents went dancing vigorously on, and the small,  occasional cries of their progeny did not reach them.          XI. \"YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME BEFORE WE GET THROUGH\"      The Swinton barbecue was over. The fiddles were silent, the steer was  eaten, the barrel emptied, or largely so, and the tapers extinguished;  round the house and sunken fire all movement of guests was quiet;  the families were long departed homeward, and after their hospitable  turbulence, the Swintons slept.    Mr. and Mrs. Westfall drove through the night, and as they neared their  cabin there came from among the bundled wraps a still, small voice.    \"Jim,\" said his wife, \"I said Alfred would catch cold.\"    \"Bosh! Lizzie, don't you fret. He's a little more than a yearlin', and  of course he'll snuffle.\" And young James took a kiss from his love.    \"Well, how you can speak of Alfred that way, calling him a yearling, as  if he was a calf, and he just as much your child as mine, I don't see,  James Westfall!\"    \"Why, what under the sun do you mean?\"    \"There he goes again! Do hurry up home, Jim. He's got a real strange  cough.\"    So they hurried home. Soon the nine miles were finished, and good  James was unhitching by his stable lantern, while his wife in the house  hastened to commit their offspring to bed. The traces had dropped, and  each horse marched forward for further unbuckling, when James heard  himself called. Indeed, there was that in his wife's voice which made  him jerk out his pistol as he ran. But it was no bear or Indian--only  two strange children on the bed. His wife was glaring at them.    He sighed with relief and laid down the pistol.    \"Put that on again, James Westfall. You'll need it. Look here!\"    \"Well, they won't bite. Whose are they? Where have you stowed ourn?\"    \"Where have I--\" Utterance forsook this mother for a moment. \"And you  ask me!\" she continued. \"Ask Lin McLean. Ask him that sets bulls on  folks and steals slippers, what he's done with our innocent lambs,  mixing them up with other people's coughing, unhealthy brats. That's  Charlie Taylor in Alfred's clothes, and I know Alfred didn't cough like  that, and I said to you it was strange; and the other one that's been  put in Christopher's new quilts is not even a bub--bub--boy!\"    As this crime against society loomed clear to James Westfall's  understanding, he sat down on the nearest piece of furniture, and  heedless of his wife's tears and his exchanged children, broke into  unregenerate laughter. Doubtless after his sharp alarm about the bear,  he was unstrung. His lady, however, promptly restrung him; and by the  time they had repacked the now clamorous changelings, and were rattling  on their way to the Taylors', he began to share her outraged feelings  properly, as a husband and a father should; but when he reached the  Taylors' and learned from Miss Wood that at this house a child had  been unwrapped whom nobody could at all identify, and that Mr. and Mrs.  Taylor were already far on the road to the Swintons', James Westfall  whipped up his horses and grew almost as thirsty for revenge as was his  wife.    Where the steer had been roasted, the powdered ashes were now cold  white, and Mr. McLean, feeling through his dreams the change of dawn  come over the air, sat up cautiously among the outdoor slumberers and  waked his neighbor.    \"Day will be soon,\" he whispered, \"and we must light out of this. I  never suspicioned yu' had that much of the devil in you before.\"    \"I reckon some of the fellows will act haidstrong,\" the Virginian  murmured luxuriously, among the warmth of his blankets.    \"I tell yu' we must skip,\" said Lin, for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12982"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science — Volume 1, No. (#18)"],[1,"rt, that I see, to a greater extent than other professions, which  are allowed to be highly respectable. Political, military, naval,  university, and clerical parties, of great eminence, defend abuses in  their several lines when profitable. We can't do better than follow  such good examples. Let us stick up for business, and--I was going to  say--leave society to take care of itself. No; that is just what we  should endeavor to prevent society from doing. The world is growing  too wise for us gentlemen. Accordingly, this Interments Bill, by  which our interests are so seriously threatened, has been brought into  Parliament. We must join heart and hand to defeat and crush it. Let us  nail our colors--which I should call the black flag--to the mast, and  let our war-cry be, \"No surrender!\" or else our motto will very soon  be, \"Resurgam;\" in other words, it will be all up with us. We stand in  a critical position in regard to public opinion. In order to determine  what steps to take for protecting business, we ought to see our  danger. I wish, therefore, to state the facts of our case clearly to  you; and I say let us face them boldly, and not blink them. Therefore,  I am going to speak plainly and plumply on this subject.    There is no doubt--between ourselves--that what makes our trade so  profitable is the superstition, weakness, and vanity of parties.  We can't disguise this fact from ourselves, and I only wish we may  be able to conceal it much longer from others. As enlightened  undertakers, we must admit that we are of no more use on earth than  scavengers. All the good we do is to bury people's dead out of sight.  Speaking as a philosopher--which an undertaker surely ought to be--I  should say that our business is merely to shoot rubbish. However, the  rubbish is human rubbish, and bereaved parties have certain feelings  which require that it should be shot gingerly. I suppose such  sentiments are natural, and will always prevail. But I fear that  people will by and by begin to think that pomp, parade, and ceremony  are unnecessary upon melancholy occasions. And whenever this happens,  Othello's occupation will, in a great measure, be gone.    I tremble to think of mourning relatives considering seriously what  is requisite--and all that is requisite--for decent interment, in a  rational point of view. Nothing more, I am afraid Common Sense would  say, than to carry the body in the simplest chest, and under the  plainest covering, only in a solemn and respectful manner, to the  grave, and lay it in the earth with proper religious ceremonies. I  fear Common Sense would be of opinion that mutes, scarfs, hatbands,  plumes of feathers, black horses, mourning coaches, and the like,  can in no way benefit the defunct, or comfort surviving friends, or  gratify anybody but the mob, and the street-boys. But happily, Common  Sense has not yet acquired an influence which would reduce every  burial to a most low affair.    Still, people think no more than they did, and in proportion as they  do think, the worse it will be for business. I consider that we have  a most dangerous enemy in Science. That same Science pokes its nose  into everything--even vaults and churchyards. It has explained how  grave-water soaks into adjoining wells; and has shocked and disgusted  people by showing them that they are drinking their dead neighbors.  It has taught parties resident in large cities that the very air they  live in reeks with human remains, which steam up from graves; and  which, of course, they are continually breathing. So it makes our  churchyards to be worse haunted than they were formerly believed to  be by ghosts, and, I may add, vampyres, in consequence of the dead  continually rising from them in this unpleasant manner. Indeed,  Science is likely to make people dread them a great deal more than  Superstition ever did, by showing that their effluvia breed typhus and  cholera; so that they are really and truly very dangerous. I should  not be surprised to hear some sanitary lecturer say, that the fear of  churchyards was a sort of instinct implanted in the mind, to prevent  ignorant people and children from going near such unwholesome places.    It would be comparatively well if the mischief done us by Science,  Medicine and Chemistry, and all that sort of thing--stopped here. The  mere consideration that burial in the heart of cities is unhealthy,  would but lead to extramural interment, to which our only  objection--though even that is no very trifling one--is that it  would diminish mortality, and consequently our trade. But this  Science--confound it!--shows that the dead do not remain permanently  in their coffins, even when the sextons of metropolitan graveyards  will let them. It not only informs Londoners that they breathe and  drink the deceased; but it reveals how the whole of the defunct party  is got rid of, and turned into gases, liquids, and mould. It exposes  the way in which all animal matter as it is called in chemical  books--is dissolved, evaporates, and disappears; and is ultimately, as  I may say, eaten up by Nature, and goes to form parts of plants, and  of other living creatures. So that, if gentlemen really wanted to be  interred with the remains of their ancestors, it would sometimes  be possible to comply with their wishes only by burying them with a  quantity of mutton--not to say with the residue of another quadruped  than the sheep, which often grazes in churchyards. Science, in  short, is hammering into people's heads truths which they have been  accustomed merely to gabble with their mouths--that all flesh is  indeed grass, or convertible into it; and not only that the human  frame does positively turn to dust, but into a great many things  besides. Now, I say, that when they become really and truly convinced  of all this; when they know and reflect that the body cannot remain  any long time in the grave which it is placed in; I am sadly afraid  that they will think twice before they will spend from thirty to  several hundred pounds in merely putting a corpse into the ground to  decompose.    The only hope for us if these scientific views become general, is,  that embalming will be resorted to; but I question if the religious  feelings of the country will approve of a practice which certainly  seems rather like an attempt to arrest a decree of Providence; and  would, besides, be very expensive. Hero I am reminded of another  danger, to which our prospects are exposed. It is that likely to arise  from serious parties, in consequence of growing more enlightened,  thinking consistently with their religious principles, instead of  their religion being a mere sentimental kind of thing which they never  reason upon. We often, you know, gentlemen, overhear the bereaved  remarking that they trust the departed is in a better place. Why, if  this were not a mere customary saying on mournful occasions--if the  parties really believed this--do you think they would attach any  importance to the dead body which we bury underground? No; to be sure:  they would look upon it merely as a suit of left-off clothes--with  the difference of being unpleasant and offensive, and not capable of  being kept. They would see that a spirit could care no more about  the corpse it had quitted, than a man who had lost his leg, would for  the amputated limb. The truth is--don't breathe it, don't whisper  it, except to the trade--that the custom of burying the dead with  expensive furniture; of treating a corpse as if it were a sensible  being; arises from an impression--though parties won't own it, even  to themselves--that what is buried is the actual individual, the  man himself. The effect of thinking seriously, and at the same time  rationally, will be to destroy this notion, and with it put an end  to all the splendor and magnificence of funerals, arising from it.  Moreover, religious parties, being particular as to their moral  conduct, would naturally consider it wrong and wicked to spend upon  the dead an amount of money which might be devoted to the benefit  of the living; and no doubt, when we come to look into it, such  expenditure is much the same thing with the practice of savages and  heathens in burying bread, and meat, and clothes, along with their  deceased friends.    I have been suggesting considerations which are very discouraging, and  which afford but a poor look-out to us undertakers. But, gentlemen,  we have one great comfort still. It has become the fashion to  inter bodies with parade and display. Fashion is fashion; and the  consequence is that it is considered an insult to the memory of  deceased parties not to bury them in a certain style; which must  be respectable at the very least, and cost, on a very low average,  twenty-five or thirty pounds. Many, such as professional persons and  tradespeople, who cannot afford so much money, can still less afford  to lose character and custom. That is where we have a pull upon the  widows and children, many of whom, if it were not for the opinion of  society, would be only too happy to save their little money, and turn  it into food and clothing, instead of funeral furniture.    Now here the Metropolitan Interments Bill steps in, and aims at  destroying our only chances of keeping up business as heretofore. We  have generally to deal with parties whose feelings are not in a state  to admit of their making bargains with us--a circumstance, on their  parts, which is highly creditable to human nature; and favorable  to trade. Thus, in short, gentlemen, we have it all our own way  with them. But this Bill comes between the bereaved party and the  undertaker. By the twenty-seventh clause, it empowers the Board of  Health to provide houses and make arrangements for the reception and  care of the dead previously to, and until interment; in order, as  it explains in a subsequent clause, to the accommodation of persons  having to provide the funerals--sup"]]]
