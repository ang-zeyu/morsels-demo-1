Shrubs (#18)"],[1,"freely its showy flowers during summer, and the bright scarlet  or orange berries in winter.    L. EUROPAEUM.--European Box Thorn. South Europe, 1730. This is a spiny,  rambling shrub, that may often be seen clambering over some cottage  porch, or used as a fence or wall plant in many parts of England. It  often grows nearly 20 feet long, and is then a plant of great beauty,  with linear-spathulate leaves of the freshest green, and pretty little  pink or reddish flowers. For quickly covering steep, dry banks and  mounds where few other plants could exist this European Box Thorn is  invaluable. Either species will grow in very poor, dry soil, and is  readily propagated by means of cuttings.      LYONIA.    LYONIA PANICULATA (_syns L. ligustrina, Andromeda globulifera, A.  pilifera_, and _Menziesia globularis_).--North America, 1806. This  species grows about a yard high, with clustered, ovate leaves, and  pretty, pinky, drooping flowers.      MACLURA.    MACLURA AURANTIACA.--Osage Orange, or Bow-wood. North America, 1818.  This is a wide-spreading tree with deciduous foliage, and armed with  spines along the branches. The leaves are three inches long, ovate and  pointed, and of a bright shining green. Flowers rather inconspicuous,  being green with a light tinge of yellow, and succeeded by fruit bearing  a resemblance when ripe to the Seville orange. It is hardy, and grows  freely in rather sandy or gravelly soil.      MAGNOLIA.    MAGNOLIA ACUMINATA.--Cucumber Tree. North America, 1736. This is a large  and handsome species, of often as much as 50 feet in height, and with a  head that is bushy in proportion. The leaves are 6 inches long, ovate  and pointed, and of a refreshing shade of green. Flowers  greenish-yellow, sweetly scented, and produced abundantly all over the  tree. They are succeeded by small, roughish fruit, resembling an infant  cucumber, but they usually fall off before becoming ripe.    M. CAMPBELII.--Sikkim, 1868. This is a magnificent Indian species, but,  unfortunately, it is not hardy except in the favoured English and Irish  localities. The leaves are large, and silky on the undersides, while the  flowers are crimson and white, and equally as large as those of the  better-known M. grandiflora.    M. CONSPICUA (_syn M. Yulan_).--Yulan. China, 1789. A large-growing  shrub, with Pea-green, deciduous foliage, and large, pure white flowers  that oft get damaged by the spring frosts. M. conspicua Soulangeana is a  supposed hybrid between M. conspicua and M. obovata. Whatever may be the  origin of this Magnolia, it is certainly a handsome and showy plant of  very vigorous growth, producing freely its white, purple-tinted flowers,  and which last for a long time in perfection. There are several other  varieties, including M. conspicua Soulangeana nigra, with dark purplish  flowers; M. conspicua Alexandrina, M. conspicua Soulangeana speciosa,  and M. conspicua Norbertii.    M. CORDATA, a native of the Southern Alleghanies (1801), is still rare  in collections. It is a small-growing, deciduous species, with yellow  flowers, that are neither scented nor showy.    M. FRASERI (_syn M. auriculata_).--Long-leaved Cucumber Tree. North  America, 1786. This species has distinctly auriculated leaves and large,  yellowish-white, fragrant flowers.    M. GLAUCA.--Laurel Magnolia. North America, 1688. This is one of the  commonest species in our gardens, and at the same time one of the  hardiest. It is of shrub size, with Laurel-like leaves, and  sweetly-scented, small, pure white flowers, produced about the end of  June.    M. GRANDIFLORA.--North America, 1737. One of the handsomest species,  with very large, glossy, evergreen leaves, and deliciously odoriferous,  creamy-white flowers, that are often fully 6 inches across. It is  usually seen as a wall plant, and the slight protection thus afforded is  almost a necessity in so far as the development of the foliage and  flowers is concerned. M. grandiflora exoniensis (Exmouth Magnolia) is a  very handsome form.    M. LENNEI.--This is a garden hybrid between M. conspicua and M. obovata  discolor, and has flowers as large as a goose's egg, of a rosy-purple  colour, and produced profusely.    M. MACROPHYLLA.--North America, 1800. This species has very large leaves  and flowers, larger, perhaps, than those of any other species. They are  very showy, being white with a purple centre. It attains a height of 30  feet.    M. OBOVATA DISCOLOR (_syn M. purpurea_).--Japan, 1790. This is a  small-growing, deciduous shrub, with large, dark green leaves, and  Tulip-shaped flowers, that are purple on the outside and almost white  within.    M. PARVIFLORA, from Japan, with creamy-white, fragrant flowers, that are  globular in shape, is a very distinct and attractive species, but cannot  generally be relied upon as hardy.    M. STELLATA (_syn M. Halleana_).--Japan, 1878. A neat, small-growing,  Japanese species, of bushy habit, and quite hardy in this country. The  small, white, fragrant flowers are produced abundantly, even on young  plants, and as early as April. One of the most desirable and handsome of  the small-growing species. M. stellata (pink variety) received an Award  of Merit at the meeting of the Royal Horticultural Society on March 28,  1893. This bids fair to be really a good thing, and may best be  described as a pink-flowered form of the now well-known and popular  species.    M. UMBRELLA (_syn M. tripetala_).--Umbrella Tree. North America, 1752. A  noble species, with large, deep green leaves, that are often 16 inches  long. It is quite hardy around London, and produces its large, white,  fragrant flowers in succession during May and June. The fruit is large  and showy, and of a deep purplish-red colour.      MEDICAGO.    MEDICAGO ARBOREA.--South Europe, 1596. This species grows to the height  of 6 feet or 8 feet, and produces its Pea-shaped flowers from June  onwards. The leaves are broadly oval and serrated at the tips, but they  vary in this respect. It is not hardy unless in warm, sheltered corners  of southern England and Ireland, although it stood unharmed for many  years at Kew. It succeeds best, and is less apt to receive injury, when  planted in rather dry and warm soil.      MENISPERMUM.    MENISPERMUM CANADENSE.--Moonseed. North America, 1691. This shrub is  principally remarkable for the large, reniform, peltate leaves, which  are of value for covering pergolas, bowers and walls. The flowers are of  no great account, being rather inconspicuous and paniculate. It is hardy  in most places, and is worthy of culture for its graceful habit and  handsome foliage.      MICROGLOSSA.    MICROGLOSSA ALBESCENS (_syn Aster albescens_ and _A.  cabulicus_).--Himalayas, 1842. This member of the Compositae family is a  much-branched shrub, with grayish lanceolate foliage, and clusters of  flowers about 6 inches in diameter, and of a bluish or mauve colour. It  is a native of Nepaul, and, with the protection of a wall, perfectly  hardy around London.      MITCHELLA.    MITCHELLA REPENS.--Partridge Berry. North America, 1761. A low-growing,  creeping plant, having oval, persistent leaves, white flowers, and  brilliant scarlet fruit. It is a neat little bog plant, resembling  Fuchsia procumbens in habit, and with bunches of the brightest  Cotoneaster-like fruit. For rock gardening, or planting on the margins  of beds in light, peaty soil, this is one of the handsomest and most  beautiful of hardy creeping shrubs.      MITRARIA.    MITRARIA COCCINEA.--Scarlet Mitre Pod. Chiloe, 1848. This is only hardy  in the South of England and Ireland, and even there it requires wall  protection. It is a pretty little shrub, with long, slender shoots,  which, during the early part of the summer, are studded with the bright  red, drooping blossoms, which are urn-shaped, and often nearly 2 inches  long. It delights in damp, lumpy, peat.      MYRICA.    MYRICA ASPLENIFOLIA (_syn Comptonia asplenifolia_).--Sweet Fern. North  America, 1714. A North American plant of somewhat straggling growth,  growing to about 4 feet high, and with linear, pinnatified,  sweet-smelling leaves. The flowers are of no decorative value, being  small and inconspicuous, but for the fragrant leaves alone the shrub  will always be prized. It grows well in peaty soil, is very hardy, and  may be increased by means of offsets. This shrub is nearly allied to our  native Myrica or Sweet Gale.    M. CALIFORNICA.--Californian Wax Myrtle. California, 1848. In this we  have a valuable evergreen shrub that is hardy beyond a doubt, and that  will thrive in the very poorest classes of soils. In appearance it  somewhat resembles our native plant, but is preferable to it on account  of the deep green, persistent leaves. The leaves are about 3 inches  long, narrow, and produced in tufts along the branches. Unlike our  native species, the Californian Wax Myrtle has no pleasant aroma to the  leaves.    M. CERIFERA.--Common Candle-berry Myrtle. Canada, 1699. This is a neat  little shrub, usually about 4 feet high, with oblong-lanceolate leaves,  and inconspicuous catkins.    M. GALE.--Sweet Gale or Bog Myrtle. This has inconspicuous flowers, and  is included here on account of the deliciously fragrant foliage, and  which makes it a favourite with cultivators generally. It is a native  shrub, growing from 3 feet to 4 feet high, with deciduous,  linear-lanceolate leaves, and clustered catkins appearing before the  leaves. A moor or bog plant, and of great value for planting by the pond  or lake side, or along with the so-called American plants, for the aroma  given off by the foliage.    The Myricas are all worthy of cultivation, although the flowers are  inconspicuous--their neat and in most cases fragrant foliage, and  adaptability to poor soil or swampy hollows, being extra  recommendations.      MYRTUS.    MYRTUS COMMUNIS.--Common Myrtle. South Europe, 1597. A well-known shrub,  which, unless in very favoured spots"]]]
