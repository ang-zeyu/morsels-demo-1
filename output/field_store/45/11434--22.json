Persons who have a rather expansive span of attention for  acoustical impressions have also a wide span for the visual objects.  Persons whose attention is vivid and quick have on the whole the  expansive type of attention, while those who attend slowly have a  narrow field of attention, and so on. Hence the manifestation of one  feature of attention allows us to presuppose without further tests  that certain other features may be expected in the particular  individual.    The problem of attention, indeed, seems to stand quite in the centre  of the field of industrial efficiency. This conviction has grown upon  me in my observation of industrial life. The peculiar kind of  attention decides more than any mental trait for which economic  activity the individual is adapted. The essential point is that such  differences of attention cannot be characterized as good or bad; it is  not a question of the attentive and of the inattentive mind. One type  is not better than another, but is simply different. Two workingmen,  not only equally industrious and capable, but also equally attentive,  may yet occupy two positions in which they are both complete failures  because their attention does not fit the places, and both may become  highly efficient as soon as they exchange positions. Their particular  types of attention have now found the right places. The one may be  disposed to a strong concentration by which everything is inhibited  which lies on the mental periphery, the other may have the talent for  distributing his attention over a large field, while he is unable to  hold it for a long while at one point. If the one industrial activity  demands the attentive observation of one little lever or one wheel at  one point, while the other demands that half a dozen large machines be  simultaneously supervised, all that is necessary is to find the man  with the right type of attention for each place. It would be utterly  arbitrary to claim that the expansive type of attention is  economically more or less valuable than the concentrated type. Both in  English and in German we have a long popular series of pamphlets with  descriptions of the requirements and conditions for the various  occupations to which a boy or a girl may turn, but I have nowhere  found any reference to the most essential mental functions such as the  particular kind of attention or memory or will. These pamphlets are  always cut after the same pattern. Where the detail refers at all to  the mental side, it points only to particular knowledge which may be  learned in school or trade or work, or to abilities which may be  developed by training. But the individual differences which are set by  the particular conditions and dispositions of the mind are neglected  with surprising uniformity in the vocational literature of all  countries. The time seems ripe for at last filling this blank in the  consciousness of the nation and in the institutions of the land.          PART II    THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK          XIII    LEARNING AND TRAINING      We have placed our psychotechnical interest at the service of economic  tasks. We therefore had to start from the various economic purposes  and had to look backward, asking what ways might lead to these goals.  All our studies so far were in this sense subordinated to the one task  which ought to be the primary one in the economic world, and yet which  has been most ignored. The purpose before us was to find for every  economic occupation the best-fitted personality, both in the interest  of economic success and in the interest of personal development.  Individual traits under this point of view become for us the decisive  psychological factors, and experimental psychology had to show us a  method to determine those personal differences and their relation to  the demands for industrial efficiency. This first goal may be reached  with all the means of science, as we hope it will be in the future, or  everything may be left to unscientific, haphazard methods as in the  past: in any case a second task stands before the community, namely,  the securing of the best possible work from every man in his place.  Indeed, the nation cannot delay the solution of this second problem  until the first has been solved in a satisfactory way. We might even  say that the answer to the second question is the more important, the  less satisfactory the answer to the first is. If every place in the  economic world were filled only by those who are perfectly adapted by  their mental traits, it would be much less difficult to get efficient  work from everyone. The fact that so many misfits are at work makes it  such an urgent necessity to find ways and means by which the  efficiency can be heightened.    It must be acknowledged, however, that the problem of the best work is  not quite such a clear one as that of the best man. From various  standpoints a different answer may be given to the question which kind  of work is the best. A capitalistic, profit-seeking egotism may  consider the quickest performance, or, if differences of quality are  involved, the most skillful performance, the only desirable end. The  social reformers, on the other hand, may consider the best work that  which combines the greatest and best possible output with the highest  possible saving of the organism and the fullest development of the  personality. We have emphasized from the start that the practical  psychologist as such has not the right to give a decision upon  problems of social civilization. He has to accept the economic tasks  from the community for which he is working and his impartial service  commences only when the goals have been determined. It is not his  share to select the ends, but simply to determine the means after the  valuable ends have been chosen. As a psychological scientist he has  not the right to enter into the arena of different social party  fights. Yet we find after all a broad region which seems rather  untouched by any conflict of reasonable opinions. A reckless  capitalism on the one side and a feeble sentimentality on the other  side may try to widen or to narrow the boundaries of this region, but  taken all together, a vigorous healthy nation which is eagerly devoted  to its work is on the whole in agreement as to the essential economic  demands for efficient labor.    Experience, to be sure, shows that great changes in the conditions of  work can never enter into the history of civilization without certain  disturbances, and that opposition must therefore necessarily arise in  certain groups even against such changes as are undoubtedly  improvements and advances from the point of view of the whole nation.  Such dissatisfaction arose when the factory system was introduced, and  it is only natural that some irritation should accompany the  introduction of psychological improvements in the methods of work,  inasmuch as not a few wage-earners may at first have to lose their  places because a small number of men will under the improved  conditions be sufficient for the performance of tasks which needed  many before. But the history of economics has clearly shown that from  the point of view of the whole community such an apparent disturbance  has always been only temporary. If the psychologists succeed in  fundamentally improving the conditions of labor, the increased  efficiency of the individual will promote such an enriched and  vivified economic life that ultimately an increase in the number of  laborers needed will result. The inquiry into the possible  psychological contributions to the question of reinforced achievement  must not be deterred by the superficial objection that in one or  another industrial concern a dismissal of wage-earners might at first  result. Psychotechnics does not stand in the service of a party, but  exclusively in the service of civilization.    To begin at the beginning, we may start from the commonplace that  every form of economic labor in the workshop and in the factory, in  the field and in the mine, in the store and in the office, must first  be learned. How far do the experiments of the psychologist offer  suggestions for securing the most economic method of learning  practical activities? Bodily actions in the service of economic work  are taught and learned in hundreds of thousands of places. It is  evident that one method of teaching must reach the goal more quickly  and more reliably than another. Some methods of teaching must  therefore be economically more advantageous, and yet on the whole the  methods of teaching muscular work are essentially left to chance. It  is indeed not difficult to observe how factory workers or artisans  have learned the same complex motion according to entirely different  methods. The result is that they carry out the various partial  movements in a different order, or with different auxiliary motions,  or in different positions, or in a different rhythm, or with different  emphasis, simply because they imitate different teachers, and because  no norm, no certainty as to the best methods for the teaching, has  been determined. But the process of learning is still more fluctuating  and still more dependent upon chance than the process of teaching. The  apprentice approaches the instruction, in any chance way, and the  beginner usually learns even the first steps with a psychophysical  attitude which is left to accident. An immense waste of energy and a  quite anti-economic training in unfit movements is the necessary  result.    The learning of the elements of school knowledge in the classroom in  earlier times proceeded after exactly such chance methods. Any one who  knew how to read, write, and calculate felt himself prepared to pour  reading, writing, and arithmetic into the unprotected children.  Methods which are based on scientific examination of the  psychophysical process of reading "]]]
