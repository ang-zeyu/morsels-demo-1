At  festivals and times of pilgrimage the precincts are thronged by a crowd  of worshippers the like of which is hardly to be seen in Europe,  worshippers not only devout but fired with an enthusiasm which bursts  into a mighty chorus of welcome when the image of the god is brought  forth from the inner shrine.    The earlier forms of Buddhist ceremonial are of the synagogue type  (though in no way derived from Jewish sources) for, though there is no  prayer, they consist chiefly of confession, preaching and reading the  scriptures. But this puritanic severity could not be popular and the  veneration of images and relics was soon added to the ritual. The former  was adopted by Buddhism earlier than by the Brahmans. The latter, though  a conspicuous feature of Buddhism in all lands, is almost unknown to  Hinduism. In their later developments Buddhist and Christian ceremonies  show an extraordinary resemblance due in my opinion chiefly to  convergence, though I do not entirely exclude mutual influence. Both  Buddhism and Roman Catholicism accepted pagan ritual with some  reservations and refinements. The worship has for its object an image or  a shrine containing a relic which is placed in a conspicuous position at  the end of the hall of worship[80]. Animal sacrifices are rejected but  offerings of flowers, lights and incense are permitted, as well as the  singing of hymns. It is not altogether strange if Buddhist and Catholic  rituals starting from the same elements ended by producing similar  scenic effects.    Yet though the scenic effect may be similar, there is often a difference  in the nature of the rite. Direct invocations are not wanting in Tibetan  and Far Eastern Buddhism but many services consist not of prayers but of  the recitation of scripture by which merit is acquired. This merit is  then formally transferred by the officiants to some special object, such  as the peace of the dead or the prosperity of a living suppliant.    The later phases of both Hinduism and Buddhism are permeated by what is  called Tantrism[81], that is to say the endeavour to attain spiritual  ends by ritual acts such as gestures and the repetition of formulae.  These expedients are dangerous and may become puerile, but those who  ridicule them often forget that they may be termed sacramental with as  much propriety as magical and are in fact based on the same theory as  the sacraments of the Catholic Church. When a child is made eligible for  salvation by sprinkling with water, by the sign of the cross and by the  mantra \"In the Name of the Father,\" etc., or when the divine spirit is  localized in bread and wine and worshipped, these rites are closely  analogous to tantric ceremonial.    The Buddhist temples of the Far East are in original intention copies of  Indian edifices and in the larger establishments there is a daily  routine of services performed by resident monks. But the management of  religious foundations in these countries has been much influenced by old  pagan usages as to temples and worship which show an interesting  resemblance to the customs of classical antiquity but have little in  common with Buddhist or Christian ideas. A Chinese municipal temple is a  public building dedicated to a spirit or departed worthy. If sacrifices  are offered in it, they are not likely to take place more than three or  four times a year. Private persons may go there to obtain luck by  burning a little incense or still more frequently to divine the future:  public meetings and theatrical performances may be held there, but  anything like a congregational service is rare. Just so in ancient Rome  a temple might be used for a meeting of the Senate or for funeral games.      22. _The Worship of the Reproductive Forces_    One aspect of Indian religions is so singular that it demands notice,  although it is difficult to discuss. I mean the worship of the  generative forces. The cult of a god, or more often of a goddess, who  personifies the reproductive and also the destructive powers of nature  (for it is not only in India that the two activities are seen to be  akin) existed in many countries. It was prominent in Babylonia and Asia  Minor, less prominent but still distinctly present in Egypt and in many  cases was accompanied by hysterical and immoral rites, by mutilations of  the body and offerings of blood. But in most countries such deities and  rites are a matter of ancient history: they decayed as civilization  grew: in China and Japan, as formerly in Greece and Rome, they are not  an important constituent of religion. It is only in India and to some  extent in Tibet, which has been influenced by India, that they have  remained unabashed until modern times.    If it is right to regard with veneration the great forces of nature,  fire, sun and water, a similar feeling towards the reproductive force  cannot be unphilosophic or immoral. Nor does the idea that the supreme  deity is a mother rather than a father, though startling, contain  anything unseemly. Yet it is an undoubted fact that all the great  religions except Hinduism, though they may admit a Goddess of  Mercy--Kuan-yin or the Madonna--agree in rejecting essentially sexual  deities. Modern Europe is probably prudish to excess, but the general  practice of mankind testifies that words and acts too nearly connected  with sexual things cannot be safely permitted in the temple. This remark  would indeed be superfluous were it not that many millions of our Hindu  fellow-citizens are of a contrary opinion.    Such practices prevail chiefly among the Saktas in Bengal and Assam but  similar licence is permitted (though the theoretical justification and  theological setting are different) in some Vishnuite sects. Both are  reprobated by the majority of respectable Hindus, but both find educated  and able apologists. And though it may be admitted that worship of the  linga may exist without bad effects, moral or intellectual, yet I think  that these effects make themselves felt so soon as a sect becomes  distinctly erotic. Anyone who visits two such different localities as  Kamakhya in Assam and Gokul near Muttra must be struck with the total  absence in the shrines of anything that can be called beautiful, solemn  or even terrible. The general impression is of something diseased,  unclean and undignified. The figure of the Great Goddess of life and  death might have fired[82] the invention of artists but as a matter of  fact her worship has paralyzed their hands and brains.    Nor can I give much praise to the Tantras as literature[83]. It is true  that, as some authors point out, they contain fine sayings about God and  the soul. But in India such things form part of the common literary  stock and do not entitle the author to the praise which he would win  elsewhere, unless his language or thoughts show originality. Such  originality I have not found in those Tantras which are accessible. The  magical and erotic parts may have the melancholy distinction of being  unlike other works but the philosophical and theological sections could  have been produced by any Hindu who had studied these branches of Indian  literature.      23. _Hinduism in Practice_    After reviewing the characteristics of a religion it is natural to ask  what is its effect on those who profess it. Buddhism, Christianity and  Islam offer materials for answering such a question, since they are not  racial religions. In historical times they have been accepted by peoples  who did not profess them previously and we can estimate the consequences  of such changes. But Hinduism has racial or geographical limits. It  proselytizes, but hardly outside the Indian area: it is difficult to  distinguish it from Indian custom, as the gospel is distinguished from  the practice of Europe: it is superfluous to enquire what would be its  effect on other countries, since it shows no desire to impose itself on  them and they none to accept it. It is, like Shinto in Japan, not a  religion which has moulded the national character but the national  character finding expression in religion. Shinto and Hinduism are also  alike in perpetuating ancient beliefs and practices which seem  anachronisms but otherwise they are very different, for many races and  languages have contributed their thoughts and hopes to the ocean of  Hinduism and they all had an interest in speculation and mysticism  unknown to the Japanese.    The fact that Hinduism is something larger and more comprehensive than  what we call a religion is one reason why it contains much of dubious  moral value. It is analogous not to Christianity but to European  civilization which produces side by side philanthropy and the horrors of  war, or to science which has given us the blessings of surgery and the  curse of explosives. There is a deep-rooted idea in India that a man's  daily life must be accompanied by religious observances and regulated by  a religious code, by no means of universal application but still  suitable to his particular class. An immoral occupation need not be  irreligious: it simply requires gods of a special character. Hence we  find Thugs killing and robbing their victims in the name of Kali. But  though the Hindu is not at ease unless his customs are sanctioned by his  religion, yet religion in the wider sense is not bound by custom, for  the founders of many sects have declared that before God there is no  caste. A Hindu may devote himself to religion and abandon the world with  all its conventions, but if like most men he prefers to live in the  world, it is his duty to follow the customs and usages sanctioned for  his class and occupation. Thus as Sister Nivedita has shown in her  beautiful writings, cooking, washing and all the humble round of  domestic life become one long ritual of purification and prayer in which  the entertainment of a guest stands"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15262"],[0,"Christianity and Islam in Spain, A.D. 756-1031 (#18)"],[1,"anthropomorphite  heresy.

Not only did many of the clergy hold heretical views, but their  depravity was notorious. Hostegesis did not blush to spend the produce  of the church tithes and offerings, which he had with difficulty  extorted from his flock,[1] in bribing the court officials and the  king's sons, giving them feasts at which open and flagrant vice was  indulged in.[2] The clergy were not above pretending illness in order to  avoid paying the monthly tax to their Moslem rulers.[3] Some, even in  the highest positions in the Church, denied their Saviour and  apostatized to the Moslems; one of these renegades being Samuel, Bishop  of Elvira, the uncle of Hostegesis' mother, who, with a pervert's zeal,  persecuted the Church he had deserted, imprisoning the clergy, taxing  his former flock, and even forcing some to embrace Islam.[4]    It is not surprising, therefore, that bishops and clergy were sometimes  deposed. Samson, indeed, underwent this disgrace at the hands of a  hostile faction under Hostegesis, on the ground of his pretended heresy;  and, similarly, Valentius,[5] Bishop of Cordova, was deprived of his see  because he was a supporter of Samson. But these instances reflect more  discredit on the deposers than on their victims. Instances of deposition  are not wanting, in the free states the North. Sisenandus, seventh  Bishop of Compostella (940), was deposed by King Sancho for dissolute  living, and malversation of Church moneys.[6] On the king's death he  recovered his see, driving out his successor. Pelayo, another bishop of  Compostella, suffered the same punishment.[7]        [1] The offering of one-third for the Church was refused to      Hostegesis as being sacrilegious; so he proceeded to extort it,      \"suis codicibus institutis.\"--Samson \"Apol.,\" ii.

Yonge, p. 86.        [7] Mariana (1.1.).    When the kings of Castile gradually drove back the Moors, and when  Alfonso took Toledo in 1085, his wife, Constance of Burgundy, and her  spiritual adviser, a monk named Bernard, were horrified at the laxity in  morals and doctrine of the Muzarabic Christians. Their addiction to  poetry and natural science was regarded with suspicious aversion, and  the pork-eating, circumcision, and, not least, the cleanly habits,[1]  contracted from an intercourse with Moslems, were looked upon as so many  marks of the beast. In 1209 the Crusaders, who had swarmed to the wars  in Spain, even wished to turn their pious arms against these poor  Muzarabes, so scandalised were they at the un-Romish rites. Yet we are  told that Alfonso the Great, when building and restoring churches in the  territory newly wrested from the Moors, set up again the ordinances of  the Goths, as formerly observed at Toledo.[2]    The free church in the North had itself been in great danger of  extinction, when the armies of the great Almanzer (977-1002) swept  yearly through the Christian kingdoms like some devastating tempest.[3]  Fifty-two victorious campaigns did that irresistible warrior lead  against the infidels.[4] Barcelona, Pampluna, and Leon fell before his  arms, and the sacred city of Compostella was sacked, and for a time left  desolate, the bells of St James' shrine being carried off to Cordova to  serve as lamps in the grand mosque. We are not, therefore, surprised to  find that there were many bishops in the North who had lost their sees;  and this was the case even before the tenth century, for a bishop named  Sabaricus, being driven from his own see by the Arabs, was given that of  Mindumetum by Alfonso III. in 867,[5] and twenty years later a bishop  named Sebastian received the see of Auria in the same way.[6]    It is natural enough that the Moslems and the clergy of the Christian  Church should be hostile to one another, but it is surprising to  find--as we do find in some cases--the latter making common cause with  the Arabs in ill-treating their fellow-countrymen and coreligionists.  Thus, as we have seen, Hostegesis, relying on the support of the secular  arm,[7] beat and imprisoned the clergy for withholding from him the  Church tithes, dragging them through the city naked, with a crier crying  before them:--\"Such is the punishment of those who will not pay their  tithes to their bishop.\"[8] Bishops were even found to make episcopal  visitations, getting the names of all their flock, as if with the  intention of praying for them individually, and then to hand in their  names to the civil power for the purpose of taxation.[9] Others obtained  from the Arabs the privilege of farming the revenues derived from  Christian taxation, and cruelly oppressed their coreligionists.[10]        [1] The Christians in the North were vulgarly supposed by the      Arabs not to wash. See Conde, i. 203--\"It is related of these      people of Galicia ... that they live like savages or wild      beasts, and never wash either their persons or their garments.\"        [2] \"Chron. Albeld.,\" sec. 58--\"Ordinem Gothorum sicuti Toleto      fuerat statuit.\"        [3] \"Chron.

He was the son  of a serf of the Church,[1] and married a cousin of Hostegesis.[2]  Instead of championing the cause of the Christians, as his position  should have impelled him to do, he went so far in the opposite direction  as to call them up before him, and try to shake their attachment to  Christianity--a religion, nominally at least, his own also. Those who  held firm he forced to pay increased taxes, and even levied blackmail on  the churches. He did not scruple to drag forth the bodies of martyrs  from under the altars of churches, and, showing them to the king, to  remind him that it had been forbidden to Christians to bury their  martyrs.[3]    Following up the hostile measures instituted by Hostegesis against  Samson and Valentius, he proceeded to accuse them of inciting the  fanatics to revile Mohammed, urging that they should be tested with this  dilemma. They should be asked whether what the revilers said were true  or not. \"If they answer, 'true,' let them be punished as well as the  reviler; if 'false,' bid them slay the man themselves; refusing which,  you will know that they have aided and abetted him to abuse your  Prophet. In that case, give me permission, and I will slay the three  myself.\"[4]        [1] Dozy, ii. 268.        [2] Samson, \"Apol.,\" ii. Pref. sec. 5.        [3] Samson, 1.1.        [4] _Ibid._, sec. 9.

We have had occasion to mention one or two cases of Church, and  national, Councils held in Spain under the Arabs, and it will be worth  while to enumerate all the instances which are recorded, that we may  contrast them with those held under the Goths. It was one of the most  characteristic features of the Old Church in Spain that it was united  so closely with the civil power as almost to render the Government of  Spain a theocracy. This intimate connection of Church and State was  naturally overthrown by the Arab conquest; but the Moslem rulers, seeing  how useful such institutions as general councils were likely to be in  adjusting the relations between Mussulmans and Christians, both allowed  purely ecclesiastical councils to be called under their jurisdiction,  and also summoned others in which they took part themselves, together  with Jews, to the great scandal of the stricter Christians.[1]    To the purely ecclesiastical kind belong a council held at Seville by  Elipandus[2] to condemn the errors of Migetius; and another, held by  Cixila at Toledo in 776, against the errors of Egila, bishop of  Elvira.[3] Whether Egila abjured his error is not known, but it is  certain that he remained bishop.    Elipandus is also said, but on very doubtful authority, to have held a  council, whereat he renounced his own error of Adoptionism.[4]        [1] We even find in 962 that the bishops of Toledo and Cordova      had Moslem names, viz., Obeidollah ibn Kasim (Al"]]]
