The Germans felt that what was a danger for their ally  was also a danger for them and that they must do all in the power to  maintain Austria-Hungary in the position of a great power. They felt  that this could only be done by keeping perfect faith with their ally  and by great military strength, so that Russia might possibly be  deterred from war and peace be preserved, or else that, in case war was  forced upon them, they could wage it with honor and success. Now it was  clear in Berlin that in view of the Russian and Servian preparations,  Austria-Hungary, in case of a war, would be obliged to use a great part  of her forces against Servia and therefore would have to send against  Russia fewer troops than would have been possible under the conditions  formerly prevailing in Europe. Formerly even European Turkey could have  been counted upon for assistance, that after her recent defeat seemed  very doubtful. These reasons and considerations, which were solely of a  defensive nature, led to the great German military bills of the last two  years. Also Austria-Hungary was obliged to increase its defensive  strength.    Whoever considers carefully the course of events that has been briefly  sketched here will pronounce the assertion of our enemies, that Germany  wanted the war, ridiculous and absurd. On the contrary, it can be said  that Germany never before endeavored more eagerly to preserve peace than  during the last few years. Germany had plenty of opportunities to attack  and good opportunities to boot, for we knew for years that the army of  France was no more ready than that of Russia. But the Germans are not a  warlike nation and the German Emperor, with his Government, has always  shown how earnestly he meant his reiterated assertions that the  preservation of peace was his principal aim. He was actuated in this by  general considerations of humanity, justice, and culture, as well as by  the consideration of the German trade and commerce. This, especially the  transoceanic commerce of Germany, has increased from year to year. War,  however, means the ruin of commerce. Why expose Germany needlessly to  this terrible risk, especially as everything in Germany prospered and  her wealth increased? No, the German Army bills were merely meant to  protect us against, and prepare us for, the attacks of Muscovite  barbarism. But nobody in Germany has ever doubted for a moment that  France would attack us at the first Russian signal. Since the first days  of the Franco-Russian alliance things have become entirely reversed.  Then France wanted to win Russia for a war of revenge against Germany;  now, on the contrary, France thought herself obliged to place her power  and her existence at the disposal of the Russian lust of conquest.    In the Spring of 1914 the German press reported from St. Petersburg  detailed accounts of Russia's comprehensive preparations for war. They  were not denied in Russia, and Paris declared that Russia would be ready  in two or three years and then pursue a policy corresponding to her  power; France, too, would then be at the height of her power. If the  German Government had desired war, on the strength of these accounts,  which were true, it could have waged a preventive war at once and  easily. It did not do so, considering that a war is just only when it is  forced upon one by the enemy. Thus Spring went by with the atmosphere  at high tension. From St. Petersburg and Paris overbearing threats came  in increasing numbers to the effect that the power of the Dual Alliance  was now gigantic and that Germany and Austria soon would begin to feel  it. We remained quiet and watchful, endeavoring with perseverance and  with all our might to win over Great Britain to the policy of preserving  peace. Colonial and economic questions were being discussed by the  German and English Governments, and the cordiality between the two great  powers seemed only to be equaled by their mutual confidence.    Then on the 28th of June occurred that frightful assassination by  Servians of the successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Archduke  Francis Ferdinand. The Greater Servia propaganda of action had put aside  the man who was especially hated in Servia as the powerful exponent of  Austro-Hungarian unity and strength. This murder is the real cause of  the present European war. Austria-Hungary was able to prove to a  shuddering world, a few days after the murder, that it had been prepared  and planned systematically, yea, that the Servian Government had been  cognizant of the plan. The immense extent of the Servian revolutionary  organization in the provinces of Southern Austria, the warlike spirit of  the Servians and its instigation by Russia and France, imposed upon the  Vienna Government the duty to insist upon quiet and peace within and  without its borders. It addressed to the Servian Government a number of  demands which aimed at nothing but the suppression of the anti-Austrian  propaganda. Servia was on the point of accepting the demand, when there  arrived a dispatch from St. Petersburg, and Servia mobilized. Then  Austria, too, had to act. Thus arose the Austro-Servian war. But a few  days later the Russian Army was being mobilized, and the mobilization  was begun also in France. At the same time, as the German \"White Book\"  clearly proves, the diplomacy of Russia and France asserted its great  love of peace and tried to prolong the negotiations in order to gain  time, for, as is well known, the Russian mobilization proceeds slowly.  Germany was waiting, and again and again the German Emperor tried to win  the Czar over to the preservation of peace, for he considered him  sincere and thought him his personal friend. Emperor William was to be  cruelly disappointed. He finally saw himself obliged to proclaim a state  of war for Germany. But at that time the Russian and French armies were  already in a state of complete mobilization. At that time The London  Daily Graphic wrote the following article, which shows how an English  paper that was only slightly friendly to Germany judged of the situation  at that time:         The Mobilization Mystery.           A general mobilization has been ordered in Russia, and Germany has       responded by proclaiming martial law throughout the empire. We are       now enabled to measure exactly the narrow and slippery ledge which       still stands between Europe and the abyss of Armageddon. Will the       Russian order be acted upon in the provinces adjoining the German       frontier? If it is, then the work of the peacemakers is at an end,       for Germany is bound to reply with a mobilization of her own armed       forces, and a rush to the frontiers on all sides must ensue. We       confess that we are unable to understand the action of Russia in       view of the resumption of the negotiations with Austria. It is not       likely that these negotiations have been resumed unless both sides       think that there is yet a chance of agreement, but if this is the       case, why the mobilization which goes far beyond the limits of       necessary precaution, and is, indeed, calculated to defeat the       efforts of the diplomatists, however promising they may be? There       may, of course, be a satisfactory explanation, but as the matter       stands it is inexplicable, and is all the more regrettable because       it is calculated--we feel sure unjustly--to cast doubts on the       loyalty and straightforwardness of the Russian Government.    When Russia had let pass the time limit set by Germany, when France had  answered that she would act according to her own interests, then the  German Empire had to mobilize its army and go ahead. Before one German  soldier had crossed the German frontier a large number of French  aeroplanes came flying into our country across the neutral territory of  Belgium and Luxemburg without a word of warning on the part of the  Belgian Government. At the same time the German Government learned that  the French were about to enter Belgium. Then our Government, with great  reluctance, had to decide upon requesting the Belgian Government to  allow our troops to march through its territory. Belgium was to be  indemnified after the war, was to retain its sovereignty and integrity.  Belgium protested, at the same time allowing, by an agreement with  France, that the French troops might enter Belgium. After all this, and  not till France and Belgium itself had broken the neutrality, our troops  entered the neutral territory. Germany wanted nothing from Belgium, but  had to prevent that Belgian soil be used as a gate of entrance into  German territory.    Little has as yet been said of Great Britain. It was Germany's  conviction that the sincerity of Britain's love for peace could be  trusted. At any rate, Sir Edward Grey and Mr. Asquith asserted again and  again in the course of the last few years that England wished friendly  relations with Germany and never would lend its support to a  Franco-Russian attack on Germany. Now this attack had been made; Germany  was on the defensive against two powerful enemies. What would Great  Britain do about it? That was the question. Great Britain asked in  return for its neutrality that the German forces should not enter  Belgium. In other words, it asked that Germany should allow the French  and Belgian troops to form on Belgian territory for a march against our  frontier! This we could not allow. It would have been suicidal. The  German Government made Great Britain, in return for its neutrality, the  following offers: we would not attack the northern coast of France, we  would leave unmolested the maritime commerce of France and would  indemnify Belgium after the war and safeguard its sovereignty and  integrity. In spite of this Great Britain declared war on Germany and  sides today with those Continental powers that have united for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16350"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature,  Vol. 2 (#18)"],[1,"s, to prove them lucky or unlucky. But these  follies are not those that I am now treating on. Some names have been  considered as more auspicious than others. Cicero informs us that when  the Romans raised troops, they were anxious that the _name_ of the first  soldier who enlisted should be one of good augury. When the censors  numbered the citizens, they always began by a fortunate name, such as  _Salvius Valereus_. A person of the name of _Regillianus_ was chosen  emperor, merely from the royal sound of his name, and _Jovian_ was  elected because his name approached nearest to the beloved one of the  philosophic _Julian_. This fanciful superstition was even carried so far  that some were considered as auspicious, and others as unfortunate. The  superstitious belief in _auspicious names_ was so strong, that Caesar,  in his African expedition, gave a command to an obscure and distant  relative of the Scipios, to please the popular prejudice that the  Scipios were invincible in Africa. Suetonius observes that all those of  the family of Caesar who bore the surname of Caius perished by the sword.    The Emperor Severus consoled himself for the licentious life of his  empress Julia, from the fatality attending those of her _name_. This  strange prejudice of lucky and unlucky names prevailed in modern Europe.  The successor of Adrian VI. (as Guicciardini tells us) wished to  preserve his own name on the papal throne; but he gave up the wish when  the conclave of cardinals used the powerful argument that all the popes  who had preserved their own names had died in the first year of their  pontificates. Cardinal Marcel Cervin, who preserved his name when  elected pope, died on the twentieth day of his pontificate, and this  confirmed this superstitious opinion. La Motte le Vayer gravely asserts  that all the queens of Naples of the name of _Joan_, and the kings of  Scotland of the name of _James_, have been unfortunate: and we have  formal treatises of the fatality of Christian names. It is a vulgar  notion that every female of the name of _Agnes_ is fated to become mad.  Every nation has some names labouring with this popular prejudice.    Herrera, the Spanish historian, records an anecdote in which the choice  of a queen entirely arose from her _name_. When two French ambassadors  negotiated a marriage between one of the Spanish princesses and Louis  VIII., the names of the Royal females were _Urraca_ and _Blanche_. The  former was the elder and the more beautiful, and intended by the Spanish  court for the French monarch; but they resolutely preferred _Blanche_,  observing that the _name_ of _Urraca_ would never do! and for the sake  of a more mellifluous sound, they carried off, exulting in their own  discerning ears, the happier named, but less beautiful princess.    There are _names_ indeed which are painful to the feelings, from the  associations of our passions.[22] I have seen the Christian _name_ of a  gentleman, the victim of the caprice of his godfather, who is called  _Blast us Godly_,--which, were he designed for a bishop, must irritate  religious feelings. I am not surprised that one of the Spanish monarchs  refused to employ a sound catholic for his secretary, because his name  (_Martin Lutero_) had an affinity to the _name_ of the reformer. Mr.  Rose has recently informed us that an architect called _Malacarne_, who,  I believe, had nothing against him but his _name_, was lately deprived  of his place as principal architect by the Austrian government,--let us  hope not for his unlucky _name_; though that government, according to  Mr. Rose, acts on capricious principles! The fondness which some have  felt to perpetuate their _names_, when their race has fallen extinct, is  well known; and a fortune has then been bestowed for a change of name.  But the affection for names has gone even farther. A _similitude of  names_, Camden observes, \"dothe kindle sparkes of love and liking among  meere strangers.\" I have observed the great pleasure of persons with  uncommon names meeting with another of the same name; an instant  relationship appears to take place; and I have known that fortunes have  been bequeathed for _namesakes_. An ornamental manufacturer, who bears a  name which he supposes to be very uncommon, having executed an order for  a gentleman of the _same name_, refused to send his bill, never having  met with the like, preferring to payment the honour of serving him for  _namesake_.    Among the Greeks and the Romans, beautiful and significant names were  studied. The sublime Plato himself has noticed the present topic; his  visionary ear was sensible to the delicacy of a name; and his exalted  fancy was delighted with _beautiful names_, as well as every other  species of beauty. In his Cratylus he is solicitous that persons should  have happy, harmonious, and attractive _names_. According to Aulus  Gellius, the Athenians enacted by a public decree, that no slave should  ever bear the consecrated names of their two youthful patriots,  Harmodius and Aristogiton,--names which had been devoted to the  liberties of their country, they considered would be contaminated by  servitude. The ancient Romans decreed that the surnames of infamous  patricians should not be borne by any other patrician of that family,  that their very names might be degraded and expire with them. Eutropius  gives a pleasing proof of national friendships being cemented by a  _name_; by a treaty of peace between the Romans and the Sabines, they  agreed to melt the two nations into one mass, that they should bear  their _names_ conjointly; the Roman should add his to the Sabine, and  the Sabine take a Roman name.[23]    The ancients _named_ both persons and things from some event or other  circumstance connected with the object they were to name. Chance, fancy,  superstition, fondness, and piety, have invented _names_. It was a  common and whimsical custom among the ancients, (observes Larcher) to  give as _nicknames_ the _letters_ of the alphabet. Thus a lame girl was  called _Lambda_, on account of the resemblance which her lameness made  her bear to the letter [Greek: l], or _lambda_! AEsop was called _Theta_ by his  master, from his superior acuteness. Another was called _Beta_, from his  love of beet. It was thus Scarron, with infinite good temper, alluded to  his zig-zag body, by comparing himself to the letter s or z.    The learned Calmet also notices among the Hebrews _nicknames_ and names  of raillery taken from defects of body or mind, &c. One is called Nabal,  or _fool_; another Hamor, the _Ass_; Hagab, the _Grasshopper_, &c. Women  had frequently the names of animals; as Deborah, the _Bee_; Rachel, the  _Sheep_. Others from their nature or other qualifications; as Tamar, the  _Palm-tree_; Hadassa, the _Myrtle_; Sarah, the _Princess_; Hannah, the  _Gracious_. The Indians of North America employ sublime and picturesque  _names_; such are the great Eagle--the Partridge--Dawn of the  Day!--Great swift Arrow!--Path-opener!--Sun-bright!          THE JEWS OF YORK.      Among the most interesting passages of history are those in which we  contemplate an oppressed, yet sublime spirit, agitated by the conflict  of two terrific passions: implacable hatred attempting a resolute  vengeance, while that vengeance, though impotent, with dignified and  silent horror, sinks into the last expression of despair. In a  degenerate nation, we may, on such rare occasions, discover among them a  spirit superior to its companions and its fortune.    In the ancient and modern history of the Jews we may find two kindred  examples. I refer the reader for the more ancient narrative to the  second book of Maccabees, chap. xiv. v. 37. No feeble and unaffecting  painting is presented in the simplicity of the original. I proceed to  relate the narrative of the Jews of York.    When Richard I. ascended the throne, the Jews, to conciliate the royal  protection, brought their tributes. Many had hastened from remote parts  of England, and appearing at Westminster, the court and the mob imagined  that they had leagued to bewitch his majesty. An edict was issued to  forbid their presence at the coronation; but several, whose curiosity  was greater than their prudence, conceived that they might pass  unobserved among the crowd, and ventured to insinuate themselves into  the abbey. Probably their voice and their visage alike betrayed them,  for they were soon discovered; they flew diversely in great  consternation, while many were dragged out with little remains of life.    A rumour spread rapidly through the city, that in honour of the festival  the Jews were to be massacred. The populace, at once eager of royalty  and riot, pillaged and burnt their houses, and murdered the devoted  Jews. Benedict, a Jew of York, to save his life, received baptism; and  returning to that city, with his friend Jocenus, the most opulent of the  Jews, died of his wounds. Jocenus and his servants narrated the late  tragic circumstances to their neighbours, but where they hoped to move  sympathy they excited rage. The people at York soon gathered to imitate  the people at London; and their first assault was on the house of the  late Benedict, which having some strength and magnitude, contained his  family and friends, who found their graves in its ruins. The alarmed  Jews hastened to Jocenus, who conducted them to the governor of York  Castle, and prevailed on him to afford them an asylum for their persons  and effects. In the mean while their habitations were levelled, and the  owners murdered, except a few unresisting beings, who, unmanly in  sustaining honour, were adapted to receive baptism.    The castle had sufficient strength for their defence; but a suspicion  arising that the governor, who often went out, intended to betray them,  they one day refused him entrance. He complained to the sheriff of the  county, and the chiefs of the violent party, who stood deeply"]]]
