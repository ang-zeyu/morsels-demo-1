And the apprehension of there being less steadiness and  firmness among people of this age, than in past ages, often troubled me  while I was a child.\" An anxious desire to do away, as far as he himself  was concerned, this merited reproach, operated as one among other causes to  induce him to be particularly watchful over his thoughts and actions, and  to endeavour to attain that purity of heart, without which he conceived  there could be no perfection of the Christian character. Accordingly, in  the twenty-second year of his age, he had given such proof of the integrity  of his life, and of his religious qualifications, that he became an  acknowledged minister of the gospel in his own Society.    [Footnote A: This short sketch of the life and labours of John Woolman, is  made up from his Journal.]    At a time prior to his entering upon the ministry, being in low  circumstances, he agreed for wages to \"attend shop for a person at Mount  Holly, and to keep his books.\" In this situation we discover, by an  occurrence that happened, that he had thought seriously on the subject, and  that he had conceived proper views of the Christian unlawfulness of  slavery. \"My employer,\" says he, \"having a Negro woman, sold her, and  desired me to write a bill of sale, the man being waiting, who bought her.  The thing was sudden, and though the thought of writing an instrument of  slavery for one of my fellow-creatures made me feel uneasy, yet I  remembered I was hired by the year, that it was my master who directed me  to do it, and that it was an elderly man, a member of our Society, who  bought her. So through weakness I gave way and wrote, but, at executing it,  I was so afflicted in my mind, that I said before my master and the friend,  that I believed slave-keeping to be a practice inconsistent with the  Christian religion. This in some degree abated my uneasiness; yet, as often  as I reflected seriously upon it, I thought I should have been clearer, if  I had desired to have been excused from it, as a thing against my  conscience; for such it was. And some time after this, a young man of our  Society spoke to me to write a conveyance of a slave to him, he having  lately taken a Negro into his house. I told him I was not easy to write it;  for though many of our meeting, and in other places, kept slaves, I still  believed the practice was not right, and desired to be excused from the  writing. I spoke to him in good-will; and he told me that keeping slaves  was not altogether agreeable to his mind, but that the slave being a gift  to his wife he had accepted of her.\"    We may easily conceive that a person so scrupulous and tender on this  subject (as indeed John Woolman was on all others) was in the way of  becoming in time more eminently serviceable to his oppressed  fellow-creatures. We have seen already the good seed sown in his heart, and  it seems to have wanted only providential seasons and occurrences to be  brought into productive fruit. Accordingly we find that a journey, which he  took as a minister of the gospel in 1746, through the provinces of  Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina, which were then more noted than  others for the number of slaves in them, contributed to prepare him as an  instrument for the advancement of this great cause. The following are his  own observations upon this journey. \"Two things were remarkable to me in  this journey; First, in regard to my entertainment. When I ate, drank, and  lodged free-cost, with people who lived in ease on the hard labour of their  slaves, I felt uneasy; and, as my mind was inward to the Lord, I found,  from place to place, this uneasiness return upon me at times through the  whole visit. Where the masters bore a good share of the burthen, and lived  frugally, so that their servants were well provided for, and their labour  moderate, I felt more easy. But where they lived in a costly way, and laid  heavy burthens on their slaves, my exercise was often great, and I  frequently had conversations with them in private concerning it. Secondly,  This trade of importing slaves from their native country being much  encouraged among them, and the White people and their children so generally  living without much labour, was frequently the subject of my serious  thoughts: and I saw in these southern provinces so many vices and  corruptions, increased by this trade and this way of life, that it appeared  to me as a gloom over the land.\"    From the year 1747 to the year 1753, he seems to have been occupied chiefly  as a minister of religion, but in the latter year he published a work upon  Slave-keeping; and in the same year, while travelling within the compass of  his own monthly meeting, a circumstance happened, which kept alive his  attention to the same subject. \"About this time,\" says he, \"a person at  some distance lying sick, his brother came to me to write his will. I knew  he had slaves, and, asking his brother, was told, he intended to leave them  as slaves to his children. As writing was a profitable employ, and as  offending sober people was disagreeable to my inclination, I was straitened  in my mind, but as I looked to the Lord he inclined my heart to his  testimony; and I told the man, that I believed the practice of continuing  slavery to this people was not right, and that I had a scruple in my mind  against doing writings of that kind; that, though many in our Society kept  them as slaves, still I was not easy to be concerned in it, and desired to  be excused from going to write the will. I spoke to him in the fear of the  Lord; and he made no reply to what I said, but went away: he also had some  concerns in the practice, and I thought he was displeased with me. In this  case, I had a fresh confirmation, that acting contrary to present outward  interest from a motive of Divine love, and in regard to truth and  righteousness, opens the way to a treasure better than silver, and to a  friendship exceeding the friendship of men.\"    From 1753 to 1755, two circumstances of a similar kind took place, which  contributed greatly to strengthen him in the path he had taken; for in both  these cases the persons who requested him to make their wills, were so  impressed by the principle upon which he refused them, and by his manner of  doing it, that they bequeathed liberty to their slaves.    In the year 1756, he made a religious visit to several of the Society in  Long Island. Here it was that the seed, now long fostered by the genial  influences of Heaven, began to burst forth into fruit. Till this time he  seems to have been a passive instrument, attending only to such  circumstances as came in his way on this subject. But now he became an  active one, looking out for circumstances for the exercise of his labours.  \"My mind,\" says he, \"was deeply engaged in this visit, both in public and  private; and at several places observing that members kept slaves, I found  myself under a necessity, in a friendly way, to labour with them on that  subject, expressing, as the way opened, the inconsistency of that practice  with the purity of the Christian religion, and the ill effects of it as  manifested amongst us.\"    In the year 1757, he felt his mind so deeply interested on the same  subject, that he resolved to travel over Maryland, Virginia, and North  Carolina, in order to try to convince persons, principally in his own  Society, of the inconsistency of holding slaves. He joined his brother with  him in this arduous service. Having passed the Susquehanna into Maryland,  he began to experience great agitation of mind. \"Soon after I entered this  province,\" says he, \"a deep and painful exercise came upon me, which I  often had some feeling of since my mind was drawn towards these parts, and  with which I had acquainted my brother, before we agreed to join as  companions.    \"As the people in this and the southern provinces live much on the labour  of slaves, many of whom are used hardly, my concern was that I might attend  with singleness of heart to the voice of the true Shepherd, and be so  supported, as to remain unmoved at the faces of men.\"    It is impossible for me to follow him in detail, through this long and  interesting journey, when I consider the bounds I have prescribed to myself  in this work. I shall say therefore, what I purpose to offer generally and  in a few words.    It appears that he conversed with persons occasionally, who were not of his  own Society, with a view of answering their arguments, and of endeavouring  to evince the wickedness and impolicy of slavery. In discoursing with  these, however strenuous he might appear, he seems never to have departed  from a calm, modest, and yet dignified and even friendly demeanour. At the  public meetings for discipline, held by his own Society in these provinces,  he endeavoured to display the same truths and in the same manner, but  particularly to the elders of his own Society, exhorting them, as the most  conspicuous rank, to be careful of their conduct, and to give a bright  example in the liberation of their slaves. He visited also families for the  same purpose: and he had the well-earned satisfaction of finding his  admonitions kindly received by some, and of seeing a disposition in  others to follow the advice he had given them.    In the year 1758, he attended the yearly meeting at Philadelphia, where he  addressed his brethren on the propriety of dealing with such members, as  should hereafter purchase slaves. On the discussion of this point he spoke  a second time, and this to such effect that he had the satisfaction at this  meeting to see minutes made more fully than any before, and a commitee  appointed, for the advancement of the great object, to which he had now  been instrumental in turning the attention of many, and to witness a  considerable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12434"],[0,"Twelve Studies on the Making of a Nation: The Beginnings of Israel's History (#18)"],[1," Still later, with the development of a higher civilization  and with the individual conscience stimulating men to care for the  welfare not merely of their family, but of their nation,  legislation considers primarily the welfare of society.  Yet, as  one of our great judges has lately explained, in practically all  stages of society, whenever the population becomes numerous and  business is so developed that we may recognize different classes in  a community, legislation has been primarily in the interests of a  ruling class, often at the expense of the other classes.  This  principle is illustrated by certain of the later Jewish ceremonial  laws that brought to the priests a large income at the expense of  the people.  Many laws in Europe and in the United States to-day  have been made clearly in the interests of certain classes in  society.  Can you think of some?      III.    THE AUTHORITY UNDERLYING ALL LAW.    Back of all laws and rules, as the fundamental consideration,  whether consciously expressed in laws or carried out instinctively,  lies the welfare of society.  Among the wolves the pack that is  best disciplined by the strongest and most successful leader is the  one that survives.  In the earlier savage groups the rules which  guided united action grew up as a result of successful experience  in securing food and warding off enemies.  Among them the less  disciplined, the less intelligently directed groups perish.    Through his fear of the unknown, stimulated by the terrible  vindications of nature's laws, when poison and pestilence and  storms and floods do their deadly work, the savage feels the  presence of unknown forces that he calls gods, and he thus gives to  his rules of action the sanction of divinity.  And as society  develops through the pastoral, agricultural and industrial stages  into the tribe and state, with the development of religion and the  growing sense of right and of responsibility to one's fellow men,  this religious sanction of the law still abides.  In the earlier  days the sanction was due to fear of the vengeance of the gods.  In  later society it is the sense of right and justice and love for  one's fellow men, springing from the firm belief in the divine  creation and direction of the universe and in God's care for men.    But as this sense of fear or right or justice or love, associated  with a Being felt to be divine, is not universal, inasmuch as many  members of society are found ready to act selfishly, taking the law  into their own hands, force is needed in all stages of society to  put the rules and laws into effect.  With every law, as Austin  says, must go a penalty.  But as society grows more and more humane  the sense of obligation of each individual for the welfare of his  fellows grows, until in the best society laws are made and obeyed  by most citizens, not from a sense of fear of punishment, but  mainly out of goodwill to others.  A sense of justice prevails and  the sanction of law becomes not so much fear of the penalty  imposed, as the moral and religious sense of the individual and of  society.  Why, for example, do you obey the law against stealing?    IV.    MOSES' RELATION TO THE OLD TESTAMENT LAWS.    The Hebrew laws given in the Old Testament are generally known as  the laws of Moses, and the assumption of many readers in earlier  years has been that the different codes were practically formulated  by Moses himself.  The subsequent study of the Old Testament long  ago suggested to many that this view may be mistaken.  The oldest  records of his work and the fact that, as creator of the Hebrew  nation after the Exodus and as leader and prophet be rendered  important judicial decisions, have well justified the belief that  he was the real founder of what is called the Mosaic Law.  As  stated in Exodus 18, he did actually formulate the principles by  which decisions were made by the rulers whom he appointed over  thousands and over hundreds, fifties and tens.  He may have even  put into form the principles found in the earliest decalogues.  Moreover, as the Israelites in their later history were led to  formulate new rules of action, they based these upon the principles  of justice, religion and civil equality found in the earlier  decalogues.  While the specific rules of living must have changed  materially, as the Israelites changed their habits of living from  those of wanderers in the wilderness to those adapted to their  early settlements in Canaan and afterward to the settled conditions  under the monarchy, they would still base their laws upon these  earlier principles.  Hence it was not unnatural to ascribe the  origin of these laws to Moses, nor is it to-day inaccurate to speak  of them as the Mosaic code, even though they may have been put into  their present form at different periods remote from one another,  and by rulers, prophets and priests whose occupations and attitude  toward life were widely different.  Back of practically all these  laws are the fundamental beliefs that the Israelites are the people  chosen of God, that to him they owe allegiance and that from him  they derive, in principle at least, the laws under which they live.      V.    THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN LAW.    Not merely the Hebrews, but practically all ancient nations ascribe  the origin of their laws either to a deity or to some great  ancestral hero.  As already noted, the code of Hammurabi is  represented as having been given to him directly by the god  Shamash.  In the early days of Greek history, the laws of Solon and  Draco were formulated.  In India we find the laws of Manu, in China  the teachings of Confucius, and so on throughout all of the great  nations.  In some instances, doubtless, many of the laws were  actually formulated under the direction of the person to whom they  are ascribed; but in many others, as perhaps in the case of the  Mosaic code, there was some great judge or king under whose  direction certain principles were laid down and simple laws or  precedents established, and as a result all later developments were  ascribed to him.    In modern times, when legislative bodies are found in limited  monarchies as well as in republics, the methods of legislation are  necessarily different.  Although chosen bodies of men come together  to legislate for the benefit of society, as represented by the  state, there is still a normal tendency for the ruling class to  feel that it is to a great extent the state, and it does not forget  its own needs.  This class legislation was doubtless existent to a  certain extent even when the laws, supposed to be of divine origin,  were formulated by prophets and priests, for the real public  character of the laws was dependent primarily upon the unselfish  beliefs, social and religious, of the writers, whether kings or  priests.  No one is able to free himself entirely from the  influence of class prejudice.    Like the legislatures the courts even are also the product of their  times, though naturally conservative.  No law can long exactly fit  changing conditions.  The judge must adapt a law made by one  generation to the needs of the next.  In so doing he bends it to  suit his times, and to further the welfare of his state.    If aeroplanes carrying goods from Pennsylvania to New York over the  State of New Jersey let them fall and damage the property of a  resident of New Jersey, can our courts invoke the Interstate  Commerce Law made before aeroplanes were invented?    And yet there has been throughout the individual history of each  nation a gradual improvement in the living conditions of the masses  of people, even in the tribal state.  As it proved more profitable  to preserve a worker than to kill him, captives in war were not  slain, but enslaved.  As society became more settled, the custom of  personally avenging one's wrong by slaying an enemy was modified.  Cities of refuge were established, where innocent victims might  escape the avengers.  All down through the ages there has been a  growing tendency to adapt the punishment to the crime, to temper  justice with mercy, to realize that the aim of all law is not  vengeance or punishment, but the promotion of the best interests of  society through the wise administration of justice.      VI.    THE ATTITUDE OP THE CITIZENS TOWARD THE LAW.    Among savages, as has been said, there is no formulation of law.  There is the instinct of the individual to preserve his own life,  and there are rules that must be followed if the people are to  survive.  As has been truly said: \"The love of justice is simply in  the majority of men the fear of suffering injustice.\" The instinct  of preservation and sheer necessity compel the people almost  unconsciously to follow the rules of their leader.    In most patriarchal societies the fear of the god of the tribe, the  overpowering influence of custom and the unswerving directness of  the punishment of the man who violates it tend to prevent the  development of individuality and of independent thinking; and the  normal attitude of practically every person is to obey the customs  and the laws, although often those laws leave to the individual a  range of action not found in later civilized states.  But as the  sense of right and justice and the desire to promote the public  welfare grow, individualism grows also.  Each individual, thrown  upon his own resources, learns to think and question and judge.  In  democratic states he learns to take upon himself the responsibility  for his acts, and at length the view becomes prevalent that law  exists for the benefit of society.  The individual, in judging  himself and his attitude toward society, feels that the law must be  obeyed because obedience promotes the public welfare.  Even when he  believes that a law is unwise, or even unjust, he hesitates to  violate it, not only because he might be punished therefor, but  primarily because it has become wrong, according "]]]
