It was a wise remark of Goethe's  that, if you want to improve men you must begin by assuming that they  are a little better than what they seem; and it is a principle which  is applicable to communities and classes as well as to individuals.    Before dismissing the question of the relations between vagrancy and  destitution there is one more point which still requires to be  considered. According to English law, prostitution is set down as a  form of vagrancy, and the number of persons convicted of this offence  is to be found included in the statistics of vagrancy. We shall,  therefore, consider prostitution in this connection as a form of  vagrancy, and proceed to examine the extent to which it is produced by  destitution. If this grave social disorder were entirely due to a want  of the elementary needs of life on the part of the unhappy creatures  who practice it, we should find an utter absence of it in America and  Australia. In these two important portions of the globe, woman's work  is at a premium; it is one of the easiest things imaginable for  females to get employment; no one willing to work need remain idle a  single day, and the bitter cry of householders, in those quarters of  the world, is that domestic servants are not to be had. But, in spite  of the favourable position in which women stand, as far as work is  concerned in America and Australia, what do we find? Do we find that  there is no such thing as a fallen class in Melbourne and New York? On  the contrary, it is often a subject of bitter complaint by American  and Australian citizens that their large towns are just as bad, as far  as sexual morality goes, as the cities of the old world. The higher  economic position of women does not seem to touch the evil either in  the Antipodes or beyond the Atlantic. It exists among communities  where destitution is an almost unmeaning word; it exists in lands  where no woman need be idle, and where she is highly paid for her  services. In the face of such facts it is impossible to believe that  destitution is the only motive which impels a certain class of women  to wander the streets.    What is true with respect to destitution is that it compels women to  remain in the deplorable life they have adopted, but it seldom or  never drives them to take to it. Almost all the best authorities are  agreed upon this point. No one has examined this social sin in all its  bearings with such patience and exhaustiveness as Parent Duchatelet,  and his deliberate opinion, after years of investigation, is that its  origin lies in the character of the individual, in vanity, in  slothfulness, in sex. It does not, however, follow that a person  possessing these characteristics in an abnormal degree is bound to  fall. If such a person is protected by parental care, no evil results  need necessarily ensue. It is when low instincts are combined with a  bad home that the worst is to be feared. This fact was clearly and  emphatically brought to light by the parliamentary inquiry which took  place in France a few years ago. M. Th. Roussel, one of the highest  authorities on the committee, the man, in fact, from whom the inquiry  derived its name, thus sums up some of its results: \"However large a  part in the production of prostitution must be allowed to the love of  pleasure and of finery, to a dislike of work and to debased instincts,  the cause which, according to the facts cited, appears everywhere as  the most powerful and the most general, is the want of a home, the  want of maternal care.\" Here are some of the facts on which M. Roussel  bases his general statement. \"At Bordeaux, out of 600 'filles  inscrites' 98 were minors. Of the latter, 44 appear to have fallen  through their own fault alone. The remaining 54 grew up under  abnormal, domestic conditions; 14 were orphans, without father or  mother, 7 had only one parent, 32 had been abandoned or perverted by  their parents.\"    In England it would be impossible to conduct a parliamentary inquiry  on the lines of the \"Enquete Roussel,\" but it is very probable if such  an inquiry were instituted it would reveal a condition of things very  similar to what exists in France. The scattered and fragmentary  information we do possess points to that conclusion, and the  conclusion, it must be admitted, is not at all a hopeful or comforting  one. Supposing that all the homeless and deserted female children we  have now in our midst were immediately placed under the protection of  the State (as a matter of fact, most of them are), it does not follow  that they will grow up to lead regular lives. According to the  thirty-second report of the Inspector of Reformatory and Industrial  Schools, the authorities are unable to account satisfactorily for the  character of more than four fifths of the inmates of girls' industrial  schools who have left these institutions on an average for two or  three years. That is to say, it is probable that about twenty out of  every hundred girls go to the bad within two or three years of leaving  an industrial school. The proportion of girls discharged from  reformatory schools, whose character is bad within two years of their  discharge, is still larger than in the case of industrial schools.  This is only what might be expected, for it is the worst cases that  are now sent to reformatory schools. \"Since the passing of the  Elementary Education Act,\" said Miss Nicoll of the Girls' Reformatory,  Hampstead, at the Fourth Conference of the National Association of  certified Reformatory and Industrial Schools, \"a great change has  gradually been made in the character and age of the inmates of our  reformatories on admission. The School Boards in the country, and more  especially the School Board of London, by enforcing compulsory  attendance of all the children of the poor between the ages of five  and thirteen, have swept into what are termed Truant Schools all the  neglected and uncontrollable children who were formerly sent to  certified industrial schools--these latter being now retained in a  great measure for children who, besides being neglected and beyond the  control of their parents, have either taken their first steps in a  course of crime, or have, by association with vicious companions,  become familiar with it. The industrial schools have thus intercepted  the very class from which our numbers were usually drawn, leaving, as  a rule, for reformatories, girls about fifteen, who, though nominally  under fifteen, are sometimes a good deal older when admitted. Young  persons, as these are termed in the Summary Jurisdiction Acts of 1879,  are of a much more hardened character than before, and in addition to  having been guilty of acts of petty larceny, have frequently been  prostitutes for some time anterior to their admission. This being so,  it can hardly be wondered at if the success of reformatories is not so  marked as it was when they were first instituted.\"    Seeing that reformatories for girls, on account of the more hardened  character of their inmates on admission, are not so successful as  industrial schools, it is certainly within the mark to say that at  least one-fourth of the cases discharged from these institutions  become failures in the space of two years. If the proportion is so  high at the end of two years, what will it amount to at the end of  five? It is then that the young person enters upon what is _par  excellence_ the criminal age, and when that age is reached, I fear  that the proportion of failures increases considerably. In any case we  have sufficient data to show that the protection of the State, when  extended, as it is in the United Kingdom, to helpless and homeless  girls, does not in many instances suffice to keep them on the road of  virtue. Deep-seated instincts manage to assert themselves in spite of  the most careful training, the most vigilant precautions, and until  the moral development of the population, as a whole, reaches a higher  level, it will be vain to hope too much from the labours of State  institutions, however excellent these institutions may be.    It has, however, to be remembered that the fallen class is not by any  means recruited exclusively from the ranks of the helpless and the  homeless. On the contrary, according to the evidence of the Roussel  commission, nearly one half of the minors (44 out of 98) found in the  \"maisons de tolerance\" of Bordeaux had no domestic or economic  impediments to encounter. External circumstances, as far as could be  seen, had nothing to do with the unhappy position in which they stood,  and the life they adopted appears to have been entirely of their own  choosing. It is true the Bordeaux statistics only cover a small area,  and are not to be looked upon as in themselves exhaustive, but when  these statistics confirm, as they do, the careful observations of all  unbiassed investigators, we cannot be far wrong in coming to the  conclusion that in France, at least, fifty per cent. of the cases of  prostitution are not originally due to the pressure of want. Since the  introduction of Truant and Industrial Schools in this country for  homeless and neglected girls, it is certain that the proportion of  those who fall from sheer destitution must be extremely small. On the  Continent, where such institutions do not exist on such an extensive  scale, the proportion may be somewhat larger, but in the United  Kingdom it cannot, according to the most liberal computation, exceed  ten per cent. of the cases brought before the magistrates. Many  experienced observers will not allow that it reaches such a high  percentage.    We are now in a position to tabulate the results of our inquiries as  to the part "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15831"],[0,"The Scientific American Boy; Or, The Camp at Willow Clump Island (#18)"],[1,"or forward end of the gaff through a  pulley block near the top of the mast, and led down to the backbone,  where it was \"belayed,\" or wrapped around a cleat. The cleat, which was  whittled out of a stick of wood, was made in the form indicated in Fig.  171. A short length of rope was strung through a pulley block and tied  with some slack to the upper end and to the center of the gaff. This  rope is called a \"bridle,\" and to the pulley block on this \"bridle\" a  rope was attached called the \"peak halyard.\" The peak halyard was passed  through a pulley block at the top of the mast, and belayed on a cleat at  the side of the backbone. For the main sheet (that is, the rope used for  guiding the mainsail) two pulley blocks were fastened to the backbone,  one just in front of the seat and the other a few feet further forward,  and two more were lashed to the boom, midway between these blocks. The  sheet was fastened near the aft end of the backbone and then strung  through the blocks in the order illustrated, the free end of the sheet  being brought back to the seat, where a cleat was provided, to which it  could be secured when desired.    [Illustration: Fig. 172. The Jib-sail.]    [Illustration: Fig. 173. The Ice Boat Completed.]    The jib-sail was now cut out to the dimensions given in Fig. 172. The  foot of the sail was lashed to a jib-boom 3 feet 4 inches long. The  jib-boom was attached to the backbone at its fore end by means of a  couple of screw eyes. The eye of one of these was pried open, linked  through the other and then closed again. One of the screw eyes was now  screwed into the head of the jib-boom and the other was threaded into  the end of the backbone. The upper corner or \"head\" of the jib was tied  to a jib-halyard, which passed through a block at the top of the mast,  and was secured on a cleat on the backbone. On the jib we used two  sheets. They were attached to the end of the jib-boom and passed on  opposite sides of the mast through blocks on the crosspiece to the stern  of the boat, where separate cleats were provided for them.    This completed our ice boat, and a very pretty little boat she was. It  was with great reluctance that we furled the sails, unstepped the mast,  and stowed away the parts in our attic until old Jack Frost should wake  up and furnish us with a field of smooth ice.      THE SLEDGE.    [Illustration: Fig. 174. A Spacing Block.]    [Illustration: Fig. 175. The Runners and Rails Spaced Apart.]    Our sledge was patterned after a picture of one used by Peary in one of  his Arctic expeditions. First we got four strips of hickory 1 inch  thick, 1-1/2 inches wide and 8 feet long for the runners and side rails.  Beginning 18 inches from the ends, each stick was tapered gradually to a  thickness of 1/2 an inch. Then we made eight spreaders or spacing  blocks, each 1-1/2 inches thick, 2-1/2 inches wide and 11 inches long.  In each end a notch 1/2 inch deep was cut to receive the runners and  side rails. In the edge of each block, midway of its length, a slot 1  inch deep was cut to receive the cross sticks of the sledge. First we  nailed the runners and rails to the blocks, fastening them with screws,  spacing the blocks 16 inches from the ends, and 20 inches apart from  center to center. Then we bent the ends of the rails and runners  together, fastening them with bolts, as in Fig. 175. Four crosspieces,  or floor beams, were cut out of a 1-inch board, each 2 inches wide and  30 inches long. These were fitted into the slots in the space blocks and  secured with screws. A cross stick was also fastened between the rails  and runners at the forward end. On the floor beams we nailed a flooring  of 1/2-inch slats, 2 inches wide and 6 feet long. At the rear end these  slats projected 8 inches beyond the last space block and over them a  cross slat was nailed. A stick of hickory 4-1/2 feet long was soaked in  hot water, as described on page 39, and was bent to an U-shape. The ends  were then fitted over the first cross stick, and under the first floor  supports, and securely nailed in place. Another stick of hickory 6 feet  long was similarly bent, and the ends slipped over the rear cross slats  and fitted against the rear space blocks, in which position the stick  was securely nailed.    [Illustration: Fig. 176. The Sledge.]    It was our intention to shoe the runners with strips of brass, but these  were not procurable in our village, and we had no time to go down to  Millville. However, the village blacksmith came to our rescue and shod  our sledge with sleigh runner iron.    We had planned to make two more devices for our winter sports--a  toboggan and a peculiar looking contrivance called a \"rennwolf,\" a  picture of which Dutchy happened to unearth in one of his father's  books. Unfortunately Bill and I had to return to school before either of  these was completed. However, the work was entrusted to Reddy, who was  quite handy with tools, and Jack, who was made secretary _pro  tempore_, took notes on the work.      THE TOBOGGAN.    [Illustration: Fig. 177. Tying Down the Head Piece of the Toboggan.]    The toboggan was made of light flexible hickory boards, 1/4 of an inch  thick, 6 inches wide and 8 feet long. Three of these boards were used,  and they were fastened together with cross sticks or battens, about 3  inches wide and 1/2 an inch thick. There were six of these battens  spaced about 15 inches apart, and secured to the floor boards with  flathead screws introduced from the under side and countersunk so that  the heads would not project below the bottom of the toboggan. At the  forward end we screwed on a head piece of oak, 3/4 of an inch thick,  1-1/2 inches wide and 20 inches long. The head piece was fastened to the  under side of the boards, so that when they were curved up into a hood  it would lie on top. The ends of the head piece, which projected 1 inch  each side of the boards, were notched to hold the rope, which was tied  fast after the boards had been steamed. The boards were steamed by  wrapping them in burlap for a distance of 2 feet from the forward end,  and pouring boiling water over them, as was done with the snow shoes  (page 39). Before bending the boards we had fixed screw eyes in the ends  of each batten, except the forward one; a rope had been strung through  these screw eyes and the ends were now tied to the head piece and drawn  tight so as to bend the boards into a graceful curve. In this way the  ropes were of service not only for curving the front end into a hood,  but also for side rails, to hold on by when shooting swiftly around  curves.    [Illustration: Fig. 178. The Toboggan.]      THE RENNWOLF.    The runners of the rennwolf were made of hickory strips, 1 inch thick, 2  inches wide and 8 feet long. At their forward ends these strips were  tapered down to a thickness of 1/2 an inch and curved upward. About 30  inches from the rear end of each runner an upright post was nailed. The  post was 3 feet long and was braced by a diagonal brace 24 inches long,  as shown in Fig. 179. A tie bar was nailed to the post about 6 or 8  inches from the bottom and connected with the forward curved end of the  runner.    [Illustration: Fig. 179. Dimensions of Rennwolf.]    The two runners were now placed parallel to each other about 18 inches  apart, and connected by four cross bars, one at the forward end, and  three on the upright posts, in about the positions illustrated. The  upper cross bar was extended 6 inches beyond the posts at each side, and  served as a handle for guiding the queer craft. An 18-inch square board  was used for the seat of the rennwolf. It rested on the second cross-bar  of the post about 12 inches from the runners, and the forward end was  supported on legs nailed to the tie bars. On each runner back of the  posts a loop of leather was nailed, large enough to receive the toe of  one shoe.    When using this odd sled one foot would rest on the runner with the toe  in the strap, and by kicking out against the snow or ice with the other  foot the rennwolf would be made to spin along at a rapid rate. Of  course, when coasting both feet would rest on the runners and the sled  was steered by an occasional side push at the right or left. Owing to  the great length of the runners the rennwolf would easily ride over  uneven surfaces and thin spots in the ice.    [Illustration: Fig. 180. The Rennwolf in Use.]      ICE CREEPERS.    [Illustration: Fig. 181. The Ice Creeper.]    In order to provide a better hold for the propelling foot, we fastened  around the toe a strap of leather, through which a number of long tacks  projected. Their sharp points would stick into the ice, and prevent the  foot from slipping. The seat of the rennwolf was convenient for carrying  a coat or any light luggage, and it was often used to give a friend a  very exhilarating ride.          CHAPTER XV.    THE SUBTERRANEAN CLUB.      I am afraid we were not very glad to get back to school that fall. It  seemed very hard to give up the sport we had been having, and our heads  were brimful of new schemes which we could hardly wait to put into  practice. But we soon learned that there are many things that could be  done during recreation hours at school. We had intended building a cave  on our island that summer, but our vacation came to an end before we got  around to it. There seemed no reason why we shouldn't dig one in the  woods at the back of the schoolhouse.      A CAVE-IN.    Bill had read somewhere that if you dig a cave under a tree the roots of  the tree will support the ground on top and make a natural and  substantial roof. It sounded very reasonable, we thought; in fact, we  never questioned the truth of the statement, because we had somehow  gotten the notion that books were never wrong, and that whatever was set  up in type must surely be so. But events proved that the man who wrote  that book had never attempted to build a cave in the manner "]]]
