V. _Of Stimulus less than natural._    1. A quantity of stimulus less than natural, producing a decreased exertion  of sensorial power, occasions an accumulation of the general quantity of  it. This circumstance is observable in the hemiplagia, in which the  patients are perpetually moving the muscles, which are unaffected. On this  account we awake with greater vigour after sleep, because during so many  hours, the great usual expenditure of sensorial power in the performance of  voluntary actions, and in the exertions of our organs of sense, in  consequence of the irritations occasioned by external objects had been  suspended, and a consequent accumulation had taken place.    In like manner the exertion of the sensorial power less than natural in one  part of the system, is liable to produce an increase of the exertion of it  in some other part. Thus by the action of vomiting, in which the natural  exertion of the motions of the stomach are destroyed or diminished, an  increased absorption of the pulmonary and cellular lymphatics is produced,  as is known by the increased absorption of the fluid deposited in them in  dropsical cases. But these partial quiescences of sensorial power are also  sometimes attended with other partial quiescences, which sympathize with  them, as cold and pale extremities from hunger. These therefore are to be  ascribed to the associations of sympathy explained in Sect. XXXV. and not  to the general accumulation of sensorial power.    2. A quantity of stimulus less than natural, applied to fibres previously  accustomed to perpetual stimulus, is succeeded by accumulation of sensorial  power in the affected organ. The truth of this proposition is evinced,  because a stimulus less than natural, if it be somewhat greater than that  above mentioned, will excite the organ so circumstanced into violent  activity. Thus on a frosty day with wind, the face of a person exposed to  the wind is at first pale and shrunk; but on turning the face from the  wind, it becomes soon of a glow with warmth and flushing. The glow of the  skin in emerging from the cold-bath is owing to the same cause.    It does not appear, that an accumulation of sensorial power above the  natural quantity is acquired by those muscles, which are not subject to  perpetual stimulus, as the locomotive muscles: these, after the greatest  fatigue, only acquire by rest their usual aptitude to motion; whereas the  vascular system, as the heart and arteries, after a short quiescence, are  thrown into violent action by their natural quantity of stimulus.    Nevertheless by this accumulation of sensorial power during the application  of decreased stimulus, and by the exhaustion of it during the action of  increased stimulus, it is wisely provided, that the actions of the vascular  muscles and organs of sense are not much deranged by small variations of  stimulus; as the quantity of sensorial power becomes in some measure  inversely as the quantity of stimulus.    3. A quantity of stimulus less than that mentioned above, and continued for  some time, induces pain in the affected organ, as the pain of cold in the  hands, when they are immersed in snow, is owing to a deficiency of the  stimulation of heat. Hunger is a pain from the deficiency of the  stimulation of food. Pain in the back at the commencement of ague-fits, and  the head-achs which attend feeble people, are pains from defect of  stimulus, and are hence relieved by opium, essential oils, spirit of wine.    As the pains, which originate from defect of stimulus, only occur in those  parts of the system, which have been previously subjected to perpetual  stimulus; and as an accumulation of sensorial power is produced in the  quiescent organ along with the pain, as in cold or hunger, there is reason  to believe, that the pain is owing to the accumulation of sensorial power.  For, in the locomotive muscles, in the retina of the eye, and other organs  of senses, no pain occurs from the absence of stimulus, nor any great  accumulation of sensorial power beyond their natural quantity, since these  organs have not been used to a perpetual supply of it. There is indeed a  greater accumulation occurs in the organ of vision after its quiescence,  because it is subject to more constant stimulus.    4. A certain quantity of stimulus less than natural induces the moving  organ into feebler and more frequent contractions, as mentioned in No. I.  4. of this Section. For each contraction moving through a less space, or  with less force, that is, with less expenditure of the spirit of animation,  is sooner relaxed, and the spirit of animation derived at each interval  into the acting fibres being less, these intervals likewise become shorter.  Hence the tremours of the hands of people accustomed to vinous spirit, till  they take their usual stimulus; hence the quick pulse in fevers attended  with debility, which is greater than in fevers attended with strength; in  the latter the pulse seldom beats above 120 times in a minute, in the  former it frequently exceeds 140.    It must be observed, that in this and the two following articles the  decreased action of the system is probably more frequently occasioned by  deficiency in the quantity of sensorial power, than in the quantity of  stimulus. Thus those feeble constitutions which have large pupils of their  eyes, and all who labour under nervous fevers, seem to owe their want of  natural quantity of activity in the system to the deficiency of sensorial  power; since, as far as can be seen, they frequently possess the natural  quantity of stimulus.    5. A certain quantity of stimulus, less than that above mentioned, inverts  the order of successive fibrous contractions; as in vomiting the vermicular  motions of the stomach and duodenum are inverted, and their contents  ejected, which is probably owing to the exhaustion of the spirit of  animation in the acting muscles by a previous excessive stimulus, as by the  root of ipecacuanha, and the consequent defect of sensorial power. The same  retrograde motions affect the whole intestinal canal in ileus; and the  oesophagus in globus hystericus. See this further explained in Sect. XXIX.  No. 11. on Retrograde Motions.    I must observe, also, that something similar happens in the production of  our ideas, or sensual motions, when they are too weakly excited; when any  one is thinking intensely about one thing, and carelessly conversing about  another, he is liable to use the word of a contrary meaning to that which  he designed, as cold weather for hot weather, summer for winter.    6. A certain quantity of stimulus, less than that above mentioned, is  succeeded by paralysis, first of the voluntary and sensitive motions, and  afterwards of those of irritation, and of association, which constitutes  death.    VI. _Cure of increased Exertion._    1. The cure, which nature has provided for the increased exertion of any  part of the system, consists in the consequent expenditure of the sensorial  power. But as a greater torpor follows this exhaustion of sensorial power,  as explained in the next paragraph, and a greater exertion succeeds this  torpor, the constitution frequently sinks under these increasing librations  between exertion and quiescence; till at length complete quiescence, that  is, death, closes the scene.    For, during the great exertion of the system in the hot fit of fever, an  increase of stimulus is produced from the greater momentum of the blood,  the greater distention of the heart and arteries, and the increased  production of heat, by the violent actions of the system occasioned by this  augmentation of stimulus, the sensorial power becomes diminished in a few  hours much beneath its natural quantity, the vessels at length cease to  obey even these great degrees of stimulus, as shewn in Sect. XL. 9. 1. and  a torpor of the whole or of a part of the system ensues.    Now as this second cold fit commences with a greater deficiency of  sensorial power, it is also attended with a greater deficiency of stimulus  than in the preceding cold fit, that is, with less momentum of blood, less  distention of the heart. On this account the second cold fit becomes more  violent and of longer duration than the first; and as a greater  accumulation of sensorial power must be produced before the system of  vessels will again obey the diminished stimulus, it follows, that the  second hot fit of fever will be more violent than the former one. And that  unless some other causes counteract either the violent exertions in the hot  fit, or the great torpor in the cold fit, life will at length be  extinguished by the expenditure of the whole of the sensorial power. And  from hence it appears, that the true means of curing fevers must be such as  decrease the action of the system in the hot fit, and increase it in the  cold fit; that is, such as prevent the too great diminution of sensorial  power in the hot fit, and the too great accumulation of it in the cold one.    2. Where the exertion of the sensorial powers is much increased, as in the  hot fits of fever or inflammation, the following are the usual means of  relieving it. Decrease the irritations by blood-letting, and other  evacuations; by cold water taken into the stomach, or injected as an enema,  or used externally; by cold air breathed into the lungs, and diffused over  the skin; with food of less stimulus than the patient has been accustomed  to.    3. As a cold fit, or paroxysm of inactivity of some parts of the system,  generally precedes the hot fit, or paroxysm "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15718"],[0,"How To Write Special Feature Articles (#18)"],[1,"hilariously to the last second of their stay.        In the spring we celebrated Max's second respectable rise in salary      by dropping out of the country club. We could do without it by that      time. At first we thought it necessary to substitute a determined      tramp for the Sunday morning golf game; but we presently gave that      up. We were becoming garden enthusiasts. And as a substitution for      most of the pleasure cravings of life, gardening is to be highly      recommended. Discontent has a curious little trick of flowing out of      the earthy end of a hoe.        Later that summer I found that a maid was one of the things I could      do without, making the discovery in an interregnum not of my      original choosing. A charwoman came in for the heavier work, and I      took over the cooking. Almost immediately, in spite of my      inexperience, the bills dropped. I could not cook rich pastries and      fancy desserts, and fell back on simple salads and fruit instead. I      dipped into the household magazines, followed on into technical      articles on efficiency, substituted labor-savers wherever I could,      and started my first muddled set of accounts.        At the beginning of the new year I tried my prentice hand on a      budget; and that was the year that we emerged from debt and began to      save.        That was six very short years ago. When, with three babies, the      bungalow became a trifle small, we built a little country house and      moved farther out. Several people whom we liked best among that      first \"exclusive younger set\" have moved out too, and formed the      nucleus of a neighborhood group that has wonderful times on incomes      no one of which touches $4000 a year.        Ours is not as much as that yet; but it is enough to leave a wide      and comfortable margin all around our wants. Max has given up his      pipe for cigarettes (unmonogramed), and patronizes a good tailor for      business reasons. But in everything else our substitutions stand:      gardening for golf; picnics for roadhouse dinners; simple food,      simple clothing, simple hospitality, books, a fire, and a game of      chess on winter nights.        We don't even talk about economies any more. We like them.      But--every Christmas there comes to me via the Christmas tree a box      of stockings, and for Max a box of socks--heavy silk. There never is      any card in either box; but I think we'll probably get them till we      die.    The following short confession, signed \"Mrs. M.F.E.,\" was awarded the  first prize by the _American Magazine_ in a contest for articles on \"The  Best Thing Experience Has Taught Me\":        Forty Years Bartered for What?        A tiny bit of wisdom, but as vital as protoplasm. I know, for I      bartered forty precious years of wifehood and motherhood to learn      it.        During the years of my childhood and girlhood, our family passed      from wealth to poverty. My father and only brother were killed in      battle during the Civil War; our slaves were freed; our plantations      melted from my mother's white hands during the Reconstruction days;      our big town house was sold for taxes.        When I married, my only dowry was a fierce pride and an overwhelming      ambition to get back our material prosperity. My husband was making      a \"good living.\" He was kind, easy-going, with a rare capacity for      enjoying life and he loved his wife with that chivalrous,      unquestioning, \"the queen-can-do-no-wrong\" type of love.        But even in our days of courting I answered his ardent love-making      with, \"And we will work and save and buy back the big house; then we      will--\" etc., etc.        And he? Ah, alone at sixty, I can still hear echoing down the years      his big tender laugh, as he'd say, \"Oh, what a de-ah, ambitious      little sweetheart I have!\"        He owned a home, a little cottage with a rose garden at one side of      it--surely, with love, enough for any bride. But I--I saw only the      ancestral mansion up the street, the big old house that had passed      out of the hands of our family.        I would have no honeymoon trip; I wanted the money instead. John      kissed each of my palms before he put the money into them. My      fingers closed greedily over the bills; it was the nest egg, the      beginning.        Next I had him dismiss his bookkeeper and give me the place. I      didn't go to his store--Southern ladies didn't do that in those      days--but I kept the books at home, and I wrote all the business      letters. So it happened when John came home at night, tired from his      day's work at the store, I had no time for diversions, for      love-making, no hours to walk in the rose garden by his side--no, we      must talk business.        I can see John now on many a hot night--and summer _is_ hot in the      Gulf States--dripping with perspiration as he dictated his letters      to me, while I, my aching head near the big hot lamp, wrote on and      on with hurried, nervous fingers. Outside there would be the evening      breeze from the Gulf, the moonlight, the breath of the roses, all      the romance of the southern night--but not for us!        The children came--four, in quick succession. But so fixed were my      eyes on the goal of Success, I scarcely realized the mystery of      motherhood. Oh, I loved them! I loved John, too. I would willingly      have laid down my life for him or for any one of the children. And I      intended _sometime_ to stop and enjoy John and the children. Oh,      yes, I was going really to _live_ after we had bought back the big      house, and had done so and so! In the meanwhile, I held my breath      and worked.        \"I'll be so glad,\" I remember saying one day to a friend, \"when all      my children are old enough to be off at school all day!\" Think of      that! Glad when the best years of our lives together were passed!      The day came when the last little fellow trudged off to school and I      no longer had a baby to hamper me. We were living now in the big      old home. We had bought it back and paid for it. I no longer did      John's bookkeeping for him--he paid a man a hundred dollars a month      to do that--but I still kept my hand on the business.        Then suddenly one day--John died. _Died_ in what should have been      the prime and vigor of his life.        I worked harder than ever then, not from necessity, but because in      the first few years after John left I was _afraid_ to stop and      think. So the years hurried by! One by one the children grew up and      entered more or less successful careers of their own.... I don't      feel that I know them so very well.        And now that the time of life has come when I must stop and think, I      ask myself: \"What did you do with the wonderful gifts Life laid in      your lap--the love of a good man, domestic happiness, the chance to      know intimately four little souls?\"        And being honest I have to answer: \"I bartered Life's great gifts      for Life's pitiful extras--for pride, for show!\"        If my experience were unique it would not be worth publishing, but      it is only too common. Think of the wives who exchange the best      years of their lives, their husband's comfort, his peace of mind, if      not to buy back the family mansion, then for a higher social      position; sometimes it is merely for--clothes!        It is to you women who still have the opportunity to \"walk with John      in the garden\" that I give my dearly bought bit of experience. Stop      holding your breath until you get this or that; stop reaching out      blindly for to-morrow's prize; _live_ to-day!    THE \"HOW-TO-DO-SOMETHING\" ARTICLE. Articles the primary purpose of which  is to give directions for doing something in a particular way, are  always in demand. The simplest type is the recipe or formula containing  a few directions for combining ingredients. More elaborate processes  naturally demand more complex directions and require longer articles. In  the simpler types the directions are given in the imperative form; that  is, the reader is told to \"take\" this thing and that, and to \"mix\" it  with something else. Although such recipe directions are clear, they are  not particularly interesting. Many readers, especially those of  agricultural journals, are tired of being told to do this and that in  order to get better results. They are inclined to suspect the writer of  giving directions on the basis of untried theory rather than on that of  successful practice. There is an advantage, therefore, in getting away  from formal advice and directions and in describing actual processes as  they have been carried on successfully.    Articles intended to give practical guidance are most interesting when  cast in the form of an interview, a personal experience, or a narrative.  In an interview article, a person may indirectly give directions to  others by describing in his own words the methods that he has used to  accomplish the desired results. Or the writer, by telling his own  experiences in doing something, may give readers directions in an  interesting form.    Whatever method he adopts, the writer must keep in mind the questions  that his readers would be likely to ask if he were explaining the method  or process to them in person. To one who is thoroughly familiar with a  method the whole process is so clear that he forgets how necessary it is  to describe every step to readers unfamiliar with it. The omission of a  single point may make it impossible for the reader to understand or to  follow the directions. Although a writer need not insult the  intelligence of his readers by telling them what they already know, he  may well assume that they need to be reminded tactfully of many things  that they may have known but have possibly forgotten.
