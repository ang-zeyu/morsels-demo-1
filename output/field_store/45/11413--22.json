It is more than forty years since the writer, then a boy, was one day  searching among the heavy works of a learned library in the country to  find some entertaining reading for a summer afternoon. It was a library  rich in theology, in Greek and Latin classics, in French and Spanish  literature, but contained little to amuse a child. Led by some happy  fortune, in turning over a pile of the \"Monthly Anthology\" his eye was  attracted by the title of a play, \"Sacontala,[30] or the Fatal Ring; an  Indian Drama, translated from the original Sanskrit and Pracrit. Calcutta,  1789,\" and reprinted in the Anthology in successive numbers. Gathering  them together, the boy took them into a great chestnut-tree, amid the  limbs of which he had constructed a study, and there, in the warm,  fragrant shade, read hour after hour this bewitching story. The tale was  suited to the day and the scene,--filled with images of tender girls and  religious sages, who lived amid a tropical abundance of flowers and  fruits; so blending the beauty of nature with the charm of love. Nature  becomes in it alive, and is interpenetrated with human sentiments.  Sakuntala loves the flowers as sisters; the Kesara-tree beckons to her  with its waving blossoms, and clings to her in affection as she bends over  it. The jasmine, the wife of the mango-tree, embraces her lord, who leans  down to protect his blooming bride, \"the moonlight of the grove.\" The holy  hermits defend the timid fawn from the hunters, and the birds, grown tame  in their peaceful solitudes, look tranquilly on the intruder. The demons  occasionally disturb the sacrificial rites, but, like well-educated  demons, retire at once, as soon as the protecting Raja enters the sacred  grove. All breathes of love, gentle and generous sentiment, and quiet joys  in the bosom of a luxuriant and beautiful summer land. Thus, in this poem,  written a hundred years before Christ, we find that romantic view of  nature, unknown to the Greeks and Romans, and first appearing in our own  time in such writers as Rousseau, Goethe, and Byron.    He who translated this poem into a European language, and communicated it  to modern readers, was Sir William Jones, one of the few first-class  scholars whom the world has produced. In him was joined a marvellous gift  of language with a love for truth and beauty, which detected by an  infallible instinct what was worth knowing, in the mighty maze of Oriental  literature. He had also the rare good fortune of being the first to  discover this domain of literature in Asia, unknown to the West till he  came to reveal it. The vast realm of Hindoo, Chinese, and Persian genius  was as much a new continent to Europe, when discovered by Sir William  Jones, as America was when made known by Columbus. Its riches had been  accumulating during thousands of years, waiting till the fortunate man  should arrive, destined to reveal to our age the barbaric pearl and gold  of the gorgeous East,--the true wealth of Ormus and of Ind.    Sir William Jones came well equipped for his task. Some men are born  philologians, loving _words_ for their own sake,--men to whom the devious  paths of language are open highways; who, as Lord Bacon says, \"have come  forth from the second general curse, which was the confusion of tongues,  by the art of grammar.\" Sir William Jones was one of these, perhaps the  greatest of them. A paper in his own handwriting tells us that he knew  critically eight languages,--English, Latin, French, Italian, Greek,  Arabic, Persian, and Sanskrit; less perfectly eight others,--Spanish,  Portuguese, German, Runic, Hebrew, Bengali, Hindi, Turkish; and was  moderately familiar with twelve more,--Tibetian, Pali, Phalavi, Deri,  Russian, Syriac, Ethiopic, Coptic, Welsh, Swedish, Dutch, and Chinese.  There have been, perhaps, other scholars who have known as many tongues as  this. But usually they are crushed by their own accumulations, and we  never hear of their accomplishing anything. Sir William Jones was not one  of these, \"deep versed in books, and shallow in himself.\" Language was his  instrument, but knowledge his aim. So, when he had mastered Sanskrit and  other Oriental languages, he rendered into English not only Sakuntala, but  a far more important work, \"The Laws of Manu\"; \"almost the only work in  Sanskrit,\" says Max Muller, \"the early date of which, assigned to it by  Sir William Jones from the first, has not been assailed.\" He also  translated from the Sanskrit the fables of Hitopadesa, extracts from the  Vedas, and shorter pieces. He formed a society in Calcutta for the study  of Oriental literature, was its first president, and contributed numerous  essays, all valuable, to its periodical, the \"Asiatic Researches.\" He  wrote a grammar of the Persian language, and translated from Persian into  French the history of Nadir Shah. From the Arabic he also translated many  pieces, and among them the Seven Poems suspended in the temple at Mecca,  which, in their subjects and style, seem an Arabic anticipation of Walt  Whitman. He wrote in Latin a Book of Commentaries on Asiatic Poetry, in  English several works on the Mohammedan and Civil Law, with a translation  of the Greek Orations of Isaeus. As a lawyer, a judge, a student of  natural history, his ardor of study was equally apparent. He presented to  the Royal Society in London a large collection of valuable Oriental  manuscripts, and left a long list of studies in Sanskrit to be pursued by  those who should come after him. His generous nature showed itself in his  opposition to slavery and the slave-trade, and his open sympathy with the  American Revolution. His correspondence was large, including such names as  those of Benjamin Franklin, Sir Joseph Banks, Lord Monboddo, Gibbon,  Warren Hastings, Dr. Price, Edmund Burke, and Dr. Parr. Such a man ought  to be remembered, especially by all who take an interest in the studies to  which he has opened the way, for he was one who had a right to speak of  himself, as he has spoken in these lines:--        \"Before thy mystic altar, heavenly truth,      I kneel in manhood, as I knelt in youth.      Thus let me kneel, till this dull form decay,      And life's last shade be brightened by thy ray,      Then shall my soul, now lost in clouds below,      Soar without bound, without consuming glow.\"    Since the days of Sir William Jones immense progress has been made in the  study of Sanskrit literature, especially within the last thirty or forty  years, from the time when the Schlegels led the way in this department.  Now, professors of Sanskrit are to be found in all the great European  universities, and in this country we have at least one Sanskrit scholar of  the very highest order, Professor William D. Whitney, of Yale. The system  of Brahmanism, which a short time since could only be known to Western  readers by means of the writings of Colebrooke, Wilkins, Wilson, and a few  others, has now been made accessible by the works of Lassen, Max Muller,  Burnouf, Muir, Pictet, Bopp, Weber, Windischmann, Vivien de Saint-Martin,  and a multitude of eminent writers in France, England, and Germany.[31]        Sec. 2. Difficulty of this Study. The Complexity of the System. The Hindoos  have no History. Their Ultra-Spiritualism.      But, notwithstanding these many helps, Brahmanism remains a difficult  study. Its source is not in a man, but in a caste. It is not the religion  of a Confucius, a Zoroaster, a Mohammed, but the religion of the Brahmans.  We call it Brahmanism, and it can be traced to no individual as its  founder or restorer. There is no personality about it.[32] It is a vast  world of ideas, but wanting the unity which is given by the life of a man,  its embodiment and representative.    But what a system? How large, how difficult to understand! So vast, so  complicated, so full of contradictions, so various and changeable, that  its very immensity is our refuge! We say, It is impossible to do justice  to such a system; therefore do not demand it of us.    India has been a land of mystery from the earliest times. From the most  ancient days we hear of India as the most populous nation of the world,  full of barbaric wealth and a strange wisdom. It has attracted conquerors,  and has been overrun by the armies of Semiramis, Darius, Alexander; by  Mahmud, and Tamerlane, and Nadir Shah; by Lord Clive and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1468"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 1 (#18)"],[1," originated in the  sixteenth century was, during the first quarter of the seventeenth  century, constantly widening. Theories tending to Turkish despotism  were in fashion at Whitehall. Theories tending to republicanism were  in favour with a large portion of the House of Commons. The violent  Prelatists who were, to a man, zealous for prerogative, and the violent  Puritans who were, to a man, zealous for the privileges of Parliament,  regarded each other with animosity more intense than that which, in the  preceding generation, had existed between Catholics and Protestants.    While the minds of men were in this state, the country, after a peace  of many years, at length engaged in a war which required strenuous  exertions. This war hastened the approach of the great constitutional  crisis. It was necessary that the King should have a large military  force. He could not have such a force without money. He could not  legally raise money without the consent of Parliament. It followed,  therefore, that he either must administer the government in conformity  with the sense of the House of Commons, or must venture on such a  violation of the fundamental laws of the land as had been unknown during  several centuries. The Plantagenets and the Tudors had, it is true,  occasionally supplied a deficiency in their revenue by a benevolence or  a forced loan: but these expedients were always of a temporary nature.  To meet the regular charge of a long war by regular taxation, imposed  without the consent of the Estates of the realm, was a course which  Henry the Eighth himself would not have dared to take. It seemed,  therefore, that the decisive hour was approaching, and that the English  Parliament would soon either share the fate of the senates of the  Continent, or obtain supreme ascendency in the state.    Just at this conjuncture James died. Charles the First succeeded to the  throne. He had received from nature a far better understanding, a far  stronger will, and a far keener and firmer temper than his father's.  He had inherited his father's political theories, and was much more  disposed than his father to carry them into practice. He was, like his  father, a zealous Episcopalian. He was, moreover, what his father had  never been, a zealous Arminian, and, though no Papist, liked a Papist  much better than a Puritan. It would be unjust to deny that Charles had  some of the qualities of a good, and even of a great prince. He wrote  and spoke, not, like his father, with the exactness of a professor, but  after the fashion of intelligent and well educated gentlemen. His taste  in literature and art was excellent, his manner dignified, though not  gracious, his domestic life without blemish. Faithlessness was the chief  cause of his disasters, and is the chief stain on his memory. He was, in  truth, impelled by an incurable propensity to dark and crooked ways.  It may seem strange that his conscience, which, on occasions of little  moment, was sufficiently sensitive, should never have reproached  him with this great vice. But there is reason to believe that he was  perfidious, not only from constitution and from habit, but also on  principle. He seems to have learned from the theologians whom he most  esteemed that between him and his subjects there could be nothing of the  nature of mutual contract; that he could not, even if he would, divest  himself of his despotic authority; and that, in every promise which he  made, there was an implied reservation that such promise might be broken  in case of necessity, and that of the necessity he was the sole judge.    And now began that hazardous game on which were staked the destinies of  the English people. It was played on the side of the House of Commons  with keenness, but with admirable dexterity, coolness, and perseverance.  Great statesmen who looked far behind them and far before them were at  the head of that assembly. They were resolved to place the King in such  a situation that he must either conduct the administration in conformity  with the wishes of his Parliament, or make outrageous attacks on the  most sacred principles of the constitution. They accordingly doled out  supplies to him very sparingly. He found that he must govern either in  harmony with the House of Commons or in defiance of all law. His choice  was soon made. He dissolved his first Parliament, and levied taxes by  his own authority. He convoked a second Parliament, and found it more  intractable than the first. He again resorted to the expedient of  dissolution, raised fresh taxes without any show of legal right, and  threw the chiefs of the opposition into prison At the same time a new  grievance, which the peculiar feelings and habits of the English nation  made insupportably painful, and which seemed to all discerning men to  be of fearful augury, excited general discontent and alarm. Companies  of soldiers were billeted on the people; and martial law was, in some  places, substituted for the ancient jurisprudence of the realm.    The King called a third Parliament, and soon perceived that the  opposition was stronger and fiercer than ever. He now determined on a  change of tactics. Instead of opposing an inflexible resistance to the  demands of the Commons, he, after much altercation and many evasions,  agreed to a compromise which, if he had faithfully adhered to it, would  have averted a long series of calamities. The Parliament granted  an ample supply. The King ratified, in the most solemn manner, that  celebrated law, which is known by the name of the Petition of Right,  and which is the second Great Charter of the liberties of England. By  ratifying that law he bound himself never again to raise money without  the consent of the Houses, never again to imprison any person, except  in due course of law, and never again to subject his people to the  jurisdiction of courts martial.    The day on which the royal sanction was, after many delays, solemnly  given to this great Act, was a day of joy and hope. The Commons,  who crowded the bar of the House of Lords, broke forth into loud  acclamations as soon as the clerk had pronounced the ancient form of  words by which our princes have, during many ages, signified their  assent to the wishes of the Estates of the realm. Those acclamations  were reechoed by the voice of the capital and of the nation; but  within three weeks it became manifest that Charles had no intention of  observing the compact into which he had entered. The supply given by the  representatives of the nation was collected. The promise by which that  supply had been obtained was broken. A violent contest followed. The  Parliament was dissolved with every mark of royal displeasure. Some of  the most distinguished members were imprisoned; and one of them, Sir  John Eliot, after years of suffering, died in confinement.    Charles, however, could not venture to raise, by his own authority,  taxes sufficient for carrying on war. He accordingly hastened to make  peace with his neighbours, and thenceforth gave his whole mind to  British politics.    Now commenced a new era. Many English Kings had occasionally committed  unconstitutional acts: but none had ever systematically attempted to  make himself a despot, and to reduce the Parliament to a nullity. Such  was the end which Charles distinctly proposed to himself. From March  1629 to April 1640, the Houses were not convoked. Never in our history  had there been an interval of eleven years between Parliament and  Parliament. Only once had there been an interval of even half that  length. This fact alone is sufficient to refute those who represent  Charles as having merely trodden in the footsteps of the Plantagenets  and Tudors.    It is proved, by the testimony of the King's most strenuous supporters,  that, during this part of his reign, the provisions of the Petition of  Right were violated by him, not occasionally, but constantly, and on  system; that a large part of the revenue was raised without any legal  authority; and that persons obnoxious to the government languished for  years in prison, without being ever called upon to plead before any  tribunal.    For these things history must hold the King himself chiefly responsible.  From the time of his third Parliament he was his own prime minister.  Several persons, however, whose temper and talents were suited to  his purposes, were at the head of different departments of the  administration.    Thomas Wentworth, successively created Lord Wentworth and Earl of  Strafford, a man of great abilities, eloquence, and courage, but of a  cruel and imperious nature, was the counsellor most trusted in political  and military affairs. He had been one of the most distinguished members  of the opposition, and felt towards those whom he had deserted that  peculiar malignity which has, in all ages, been characteristic of  apostates. He perfectly understood the feelings, the resources, and the  policy of the party to which he had lately belonged, and had formed a  vast and deeply meditated scheme which very nearly confounded even the  able tactics of the statesmen by whom the House of Commons had been  directed. To this scheme, in his confidential correspondence, he gave  the expressive name of Thorough. His object was to do in England all,  and more than all, that Richelieu was doing in France; to make Charles a  monarch as absolute as any on the Continent; to put the estates and the  personal liberty of the whole people at the disposal of the crown; to  deprive the courts of law of all independent authority, even in ordinary  questions of civil right between man and man; and to punish with  merciless rigour all who murmured at the acts of the government, or who  applied, even in the most decent and regular manner, to any tribunal for  relief against those acts. [12]    This was his end; and he distinctly saw in what manner alone this  end could be attained. There was, in truth,"]]]
