The sun rose in a pure  sky and flooded with his rays all the eastern side of the mountain.    The crater was reached. It was just what the engineer had made it out to  be in the dark; that is to say, a vast funnel which extended, widening,  to a height of a thousand feet above the plateau. Below the chasm, large  thick streaks of lava wound over the sides of the mountain, and thus  marked the course of the eruptive matter to the lower valleys which  furrowed the northern part of the island.    The interior of the crater, whose inclination did not exceed thirty five  to forty degrees, presented no difficulties nor obstacles to the ascent.  Traces of very ancient lava were noticed, which probably had overflowed  the summit of the cone, before this lateral chasm had opened a new way  to it.    As to the volcanic chimney which established a communication between the  subterranean layers and the crater, its depth could not be calculated  with the eye, for it was lost in obscurity. But there was no doubt as to  the complete extinction of the volcano.    Before eight o'clock Harding and his companions were assembled at the  summit of the crater, on a conical mound which swelled the northern  edge.    \"The sea, the sea everywhere!\" they cried, as if their lips could not  restrain the words which made islanders of them.    The sea, indeed, formed an immense circular sheet of water all around  them! Perhaps, on climbing again to the summit of the cone, Cyrus  Harding had had a hope of discovering some coast, some island shore,  which he had not been able to perceive in the dark the evening before.  But nothing appeared on the farthest verge of the horizon, that is to  say over a radius of more than fifty miles. No land in sight. Not a  sail. Over all this immense space the ocean alone was visible--the  island occupied the center of a circumference which appeared to be  infinite.    The engineer and his companions, mute and motionless, surveyed for  some minutes every point of the ocean, examining it to its most extreme  limits. Even Pencroft, who possessed a marvelous power of sight, saw  nothing; and certainly if there had been land at the horizon, if it  appeared only as an indistinct vapor, the sailor would undoubtedly  have found it out, for nature had placed regular telescopes under his  eyebrows.    From the ocean their gaze returned to the island which they commanded  entirely, and the first question was put by Gideon Spilett in these  terms:    \"About what size is this island?\"    Truly, it did not appear large in the midst of the immense ocean.    Cyrus Harding reflected a few minutes; he attentively observed the  perimeter of the island, taking into consideration the height at which  he was placed; then,--    \"My friends,\" said he, \"I do not think I am mistaken in giving to the  shore of the island a circumference of more than a hundred miles.\"    \"And consequently an area?\"    \"That is difficult to estimate,\" replied the engineer, \"for it is so  uneven.\"    If Cyrus Harding was not mistaken in his calculation, the island had  almost the extent of Malta or Zante, in the Mediterranean, but it was at  the same time much more irregular and less rich in capes, promontories,  points, bays, or creeks. Its strange form caught the eye, and when  Gideon Spilett, on the engineer's advice, had drawn the outline, they  found that it resembled some fantastic animal, a monstrous leviathan,  which lay sleeping on the surface of the Pacific.    This was in fact the exact shape of the island, which it is of  consequence to know, and a tolerably correct map of it was immediately  drawn by the reporter.    The east part of the shore, where the castaways had landed, formed a  wide bay, terminated by a sharp cape, which had been concealed by a high  point from Pencroft on his first exploration. At the northeast two other  capes closed the bay, and between them ran a narrow gulf, which looked  like the half-open jaws of a formidable dog-fish.    From the northeast to the southwest the coast was rounded, like  the flattened cranium of an animal, rising again, forming a sort of  protuberance which did not give any particular shape to this part of the  island, of which the center was occupied by the volcano.    From this point the shore ran pretty regularly north and south, broken  at two-thirds of its perimeter by a narrow creek, from which it ended in  a long tail, similar to the caudal appendage of a gigantic alligator.    This tail formed a regular peninsula, which stretched more than thirty  miles into the sea, reckoning from the cape southeast of the island,  already mentioned; it curled round, making an open roadstead, which  marked out the lower shore of this strangely-formed land.    At the narrowest part, that is to say between the Chimneys and the creek  on the western shore, which corresponded to it in latitude, the island  only measured ten miles; but its greatest length, from the jaws at the  northeast to the extremity of the tail of the southwest, was not less  than thirty miles.    As to the interior of the island, its general aspect was this, very  woody throughout the southern part from the mountain to the shore, and  arid and sandy in the northern part. Between the volcano and the east  coast Cyrus Harding and his companions were surprised to see a  lake, bordered with green trees, the existence of which they had not  suspected. Seen from this height, the lake appeared to be on the same  level as the ocean, but, on reflection, the engineer explained to his  companions that the altitude of this little sheet of water must be about  three hundred feet, because the plateau, which was its basin, was but a  prolongation of the coast.    \"Is it a freshwater lake?\" asked Pencroft.    \"Certainly,\" replied the engineer, \"for it must be fed by the water  which flows from the mountain.\"    \"I see a little river which runs into it,\" said Herbert, pointing out a  narrow stream, which evidently took its source somewhere in the west.    \"Yes,\" said Harding; \"and since this stream feeds the lake, most  probably on the side near the sea there is an outlet by which the  surplus water escapes. We shall see that on our return.\"    This little winding watercourse and the river already mentioned  constituted the water-system, at least such as it was displayed to the  eyes of the explorers. However, it was possible that under the masses of  trees which covered two-thirds of the island, forming an immense forest,  other rivers ran towards the sea. It might even be inferred that such  was the case, so rich did this region appear in the most magnificent  specimens of the flora of the temperate zones. There was no indication  of running water in the north, though perhaps there might be stagnant  water among the marshes in the northeast; but that was all, in addition  to the downs, sand, and aridity which contrasted so strongly with the  luxuriant vegetation of the rest of the island.    The volcano did not occupy the central part; it rose, on the contrary,  in the northwestern region, and seemed to mark the boundary of the two  zones. At the southwest, at the south, and the southeast, the first part  of the spurs were hidden under masses of verdure. At the north, on the  contrary, one could follow their ramifications, which died away on the  sandy plains. It was on this side that, at the time when the mountain  was in a state of eruption, the discharge had worn away a passage, and  a large heap of lava had spread to the narrow jaw which formed the  northeastern gulf.    Cyrus Harding and his companions remained an hour at the top of the  mountain. The island was displayed under their eyes, like a plan in  relief with different tints, green for the forests, yellow for the  sand, blue for the water. They viewed it in its tout-ensemble, nothing  remained concealed but the ground hidden by verdure, the hollows of the  valleys, and the interior of the volcanic chasms.    One important question remained to be solved, and the answer would have  a great effect upon the future of the castaways.    Was the island inhabited?    It was the reporter who put this question, to which after the close  examination they had just made, the answer seemed to be in the negative.    Nowhere could the work of a human hand be perceived. Not a group of  huts, not a solitary cabin, not a fishery on the shore. No smoke curling  in the air betrayed the presence of man. It is true, a distance of  nearly thirty miles separated the observers from the extreme points,  that is, of the tail which extended to the southwest, and it would have  been difficult, even to Pencroft's eyes, to discover a habitation there.  Neither could the curtain of verdure, which covered three-quarters  of the island, be raised to see if it did not shelter some straggling  village. But in general the islanders live on the shores of the narrow  spaces which emerge above the waters of the Pacific, and this shore  appeared to be an absolute desert.    Until a more complete exploration, it might be admitted that the island  was uninhabited. But was it frequented, at least occasionally, by  the natives of neighboring islands? It was difficult to reply to this  question. No land appeared within a radius of fifty miles. But fifty  miles could be easily crossed, either by Malay proas or by the large  Polynesian canoes. Everything depended on the position of the island,  of its isolation in the Pacific, or of its proximity to archipelagoes.  Would Cyrus Harding be able to find out their latitude and longitude  without instruments? It would be difficult. Since he was in doubt, it  was best to take precautions against a possible descent of neighboring  natives.    The exploration of the island was finished, its shape determined, its  features made out, its extent calculated, the water and mountain systems  ascertained. The disposition of the forests and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12680"],[0,"Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People (#18)"],[1,"baked for twopence by the local bakers. _Tabechas_, or stuffed  entrails, and liver, lights or milt were good substitutes for meat. A  favorite soup was _Borsch_, which was made with beet-root, fat taking  the place of the more fashionable cream.    The national dish was seldom their lot; when fried fish came it was  usually from the larder of Mrs. Simons, a motherly old widow, who lived  in the second floor front, and presided over the confinements of all the  women and the sicknesses of all the children in the neighborhood. Her  married daughter Dinah was providentially suckling a black-eyed boy when  Mrs. Ansell died, so Mrs. Simons converted her into a foster mother of  little Sarah, regarding herself ever afterwards as under special  responsibilities toward the infant, whom she occasionally took to live  with her for a week, and for whom she saw heaven encouraging a future  alliance with the black-eyed foster brother. Life would have been  gloomier still in the Ansell garret if Mrs. Simons had not been created  to bless and sustain. Even old garments somehow arrived from Mrs. Simons  to eke out the corduroys and the print gowns which were the gift of the  school. There were few pleasanter events in the Ansell household than  the falling ill of one of the children, for not only did this mean a  supply of broth, port wine and other incredible luxuries from the  Charity doctor (of which all could taste), but it brought in its train  the assiduous attendance of Mrs. Simons. To see the kindly brown face  bending over it with smiling eyes of jet, to feel the soft, cool hand  pressed to its forehead, was worth a fever to a motherless infant. Mrs.  Simons was a busy woman and a poor withal, and the Ansells were a  reticent pack, not given to expressing either their love or their hunger  to outsiders; so altogether the children did not see so much of Mrs.  Simons or her bounties as they would have liked. Nevertheless, in a  grave crisis she was always to be counted upon.    \"I tell thee what, Meshe,\" said old Mrs. Ansell often, \"that woman wants  to marry thee. A blind man could see it.\"    \"She cannot want it, mother,\" Moses would reply with infinite respect.    \"What art thou saying? A wholly fine young man like thee,\" said his  mother, fondling his side ringlets, \"and one so _froom_ too, and with  such worldly wisdom. But thou must not have her, Meshe.\"    \"What kind of idea thou stuffest into my head! I tell thee she would not  have me if I sent to ask.\"    \"Talk not thyself thereinto. Who wouldn't like to catch hold of thy  cloak to go to heaven by? But Mrs. Simons is too much of an Englishwoman  for me. Your last wife had English ideas and made mock of pious men and  God's judgment took her. What says the Prayer-book? For three things a  woman dies in childbirth, for not separating the dough, for not lighting  the Sabbath lamps and for not--\"    \"How often have I told thee she did do all these things!\" interrupted  Moses.    \"Dost thou contradict the Prayer-book?\" said the _Bube_ angrily. \"It  would have been different if thou hadst let me pick a woman for thee.  But this time thou wilt honor thy mother more. It must be a respectable,  virtuous maiden, with the fear of heaven--not an old woman like Mrs.  Simons, but one who can bear me robust grandchildren. The grandchildren  thou hast given me are sickly, and they fear not the Most High. Ah! why  did'st thou drag me to this impious country? Could'st thou not let me  die in peace? Thy girls think more of English story books and lessons  than of _Yiddishkeit_, and the boys run out under the naked sky with  bare heads and are loth to wash their hands before meals, and they do  not come home in the dinner hour for fear they should have to say the  afternoon prayer. Laugh at me, Moses, as thou wilt, but, old as I am, I  have eyes, and not two blotches of clay, in my sockets. Thou seest not  how thy family is going to destruction. Oh, the abominations!\"    Thus warned and put on his mettle, Moses would keep a keen look-out on  his hopeful family for the next day, and the seed which the grandmother  had sown came up in black and blue bruises or, the family anatomy,  especially on that portion of it which belonged to Solomon. For Moses's  crumbling trousers were buckled with a stout strap, and Solomon was a  young rogue who did his best to dodge the Almighty, and had never heard  of Lowell's warning,        You've gut to git up airly,      Ef you want to take in God.    Even if he had heard of it, he would probably have retorted that he  usually got up early enough to take in his father, who was the more  immediately terrible of the two. Nevertheless, Solomon learned many  lessons at his father's knee, or rather, across it. In earlier days  Solomon had had a number of confidential transactions with his father's  God, making bargains with Him according to his childish sense of equity.  If, for instance, God would ensure his doing his sums correctly, so that  he should be neither caned nor \"kept in,\" he would say his morning  prayers without skipping the aggravating _Longe Verachum_, which bulked  so largely on Mondays and Thursdays; otherwise he could not be bothered.    By the terms of the contract Solomon threw all the initiative on the  Deity, and whenever the Deity undertook his share of the contract,  Solomon honorably fulfilled his. Thus was his faith in Providence never  shaken like that of some boys, who expect the Deity to follow their  lead. Still, by declining to praise his Maker at extraordinary length,  except in acknowledgment of services rendered, Solomon gave early  evidence of his failure to inherit his father's business incapacity.    On days when things at the school went well, no one gabbled through the  weary Prayer-book more conscientiously than he; he said all the things  in large type and all the funny little bits in small type, and even some  passages without vowels. Nay, he included the very preface, and was  lured on and coaxed on and enticed by his father to recite the  appendices, which shot up one after the other on the devotional horizon  like the endless-seeming terraces of a deceptive ascent; just another  little bit, and now that little bit, and just that last bit, and one  more very last little bit. It was like the infinite inclusiveness of a  Chinese sphere, or the farewell performances of a distinguished singer.    For the rest, Solomon was a _Chine-ponim_, or droll, having that  inextinguishable sense of humor which has made the saints of the Jewish  Church human, has lit up dry technical Talmudic, discussions with  flashes of freakish fun, with pun and jest and merry quibble, and has  helped the race to survive (_pace_ Dr. Wallace) by dint of a humorous  acquiescence in the inevitable.    His _Chine_ helped Solomon to survive synagogue, where the only drop of  sweetness was in the beaker of wine for the sanctification service.  Solomon was always in the van of the brave boys who volunteered to take  part in the ceremonial quaffing of it. Decidedly. Solomon was not  spiritual, he would not even kiss a Hebrew Pentateuch that he had  dropped, unless his father was looking, and but for the personal  supervision of the _Bube_ the dirty white fringes of his \"four-corners\"  might have got tangled and irredeemably invalidated for all he cared.    In the direst need of the Ansells Solomon held his curly head high among  his school-fellows, and never lacked personal possessions, though they  were not negotiable at the pawnbroker's. He had a peep-show, made out of  an old cocoa box, and representing the sortie from Plevna, a permit to  view being obtainable for a fragment of slate pencil. For two pins he  would let you look a whole minute. He also had bags of brass buttons,  marbles, both commoners and alleys; nibs, beer bottle labels and cherry  \"hogs,\" besides bottles of liquorice water, vendible either by the sip  or the teaspoonful, and he dealt in \"assy-tassy,\" which consisted of  little packets of acetic acid blent with brown sugar. The character of  his stock varied according to the time of year, for nature and Belgravia  are less stable in their seasons than the Jewish schoolboy, to whom  buttons in March are as inconceivable as snow-balling in July.    On Purim Solomon always had nuts to gamble with, just as if he had been  a banker's son, and on the Day of Atonement he was never without a  little tin fusee box filled with savings of snuff. This, when the fast  racked them most sorely, he would pass round among the old men with a  grand manner. They would take a pinch and say, \"May thy strength  increase,\" and blow their delighted noses with great colored  handkerchiefs, and Solomon would feel about fifty and sniff a few  grains himself with the air of an aged connoisseur.    He took little interest in the subtle disquisitions of the Rabbis, which  added their burden to his cross of secular learning. He wrestled but  perfunctorily with the theses of the Bible commentators, for Moses  Ansell was so absorbed in translating and enjoying the intellectual  tangles, that Solomon had scarce more to do than to play the part of  chorus. He was fortunate in that his father could not afford to send him  to a _Chedar_, an insanitary institution that made Jacob a dull boy by  cutting off his play-time and his oxygen, and delivering him over to the  leathery mercies of an unintelligently learned zealot, scrupulously  unclean.    The literature and history Solomon really cared for was not of the Jews.  It was the history of Daredevil Dick and his congeners whose surprising  adventures, second-hand, in ink-stained sheets, were bartered to him for  buttons, which shows the advantages of not having a soul above such.  These deeds of derring-do (usually starting in a __school-room period in  which teachers were thankfully accepted as created by Providence for the  sport of schoolboys) Solomon conned at all hours, concealing them under  his"]]]
