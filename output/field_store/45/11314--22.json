The ideas  expressed by these mediating elements--they may be independent words,  affixes, or modifications of the radical element--may be called  \"derivational\" or \"qualifying.\" Some concrete concepts, such as _kill_,  are expressed radically; others, such as _farmer_ and _duckling_, are  expressed derivatively. Corresponding to these two modes of expression  we have two types of concepts and of linguistic elements, radical  (_farm_, _kill_, _duck_) and derivational (_-er_, _-ling_). When a word  (or unified group of words) contains a derivational element (or word)  the concrete significance of the radical element (_farm-_, _duck-_)  tends to fade from consciousness and to yield to a new concreteness  (_farmer_, _duckling_) that is synthetic in expression rather than in  thought. In our sentence the concepts of _farm_ and _duck_ are not  really involved at all; they are merely latent, for formal reasons, in  the linguistic expression.    Returning to this sentence, we feel that the analysis of _farmer_ and  _duckling_ are practically irrelevant to an understanding of its content  and entirely irrelevant to a feeling for the structure of the sentence  as a whole. From the standpoint of the sentence the derivational  elements _-er_ and _-ling_ are merely details in the local economy of  two of its terms (_farmer_, _duckling_) that it accepts as units of  expression. This indifference of the sentence as such to some part of  the analysis of its words is shown by the fact that if we substitute  such radical words as _man_ and _chick_ for _farmer_ and _duckling_, we  obtain a new material content, it is true, but not in the least a new  structural mold. We can go further and substitute another activity for  that of \"killing,\" say \"taking.\" The new sentence, _the man takes the  chick_, is totally different from the first sentence in what it conveys,  not in how it conveys it. We feel instinctively, without the slightest  attempt at conscious analysis, that the two sentences fit precisely the  same pattern, that they are really the same fundamental sentence,  differing only in their material trappings. In other words, they express  identical relational concepts in an identical manner. The manner is here  threefold--the use of an inherently relational word (_the_) in analogous  positions, the analogous sequence (subject; predicate, consisting of  verb and object) of the concrete terms of the sentence, and the use of  the suffixed element _-s_ in the verb.    Change any of these features of the sentence and it becomes modified,  slightly or seriously, in some purely relational, non-material regard.  If _the_ is omitted (_farmer kills duckling_, _man takes chick_), the  sentence becomes impossible; it falls into no recognized formal pattern  and the two subjects of discourse seem to hang incompletely in the void.  We feel that there is no relation established between either of them  and what is already in the minds of the speaker and his auditor. As soon  as a _the_ is put before the two nouns, we feel relieved. We know that  the farmer and duckling which the sentence tells us about are the same  farmer and duckling that we had been talking about or hearing about or  thinking about some time before. If I meet a man who is not looking at  and knows nothing about the farmer in question, I am likely to be stared  at for my pains if I announce to him that \"the farmer [what farmer?]  kills the duckling [didn't know he had any, whoever he is].\" If the fact  nevertheless seems interesting enough to communicate, I should be  compelled to speak of \"_a farmer_ up my way\" and of \"_a duckling_ of  his.\" These little words, _the_ and _a_, have the important function of  establishing a definite or an indefinite reference.    If I omit the first _the_ and also leave out the suffixed _-s_, I obtain  an entirely new set of relations. _Farmer, kill the duckling_ implies  that I am now speaking to the farmer, not merely about him; further,  that he is not actually killing the bird, but is being ordered by me to  do so. The subjective relation of the first sentence has become a  vocative one, one of address, and the activity is conceived in terms of  command, not of statement. We conclude, therefore, that if the farmer is  to be merely talked about, the little _the_ must go back into its place  and the _-s_ must not be removed. The latter element clearly defines, or  rather helps to define, statement as contrasted with command. I find,  moreover, that if I wish to speak of several farmers, I cannot say _the  farmers kills the duckling_, but must say _the farmers kill the  duckling_. Evidently _-s_ involves the notion of singularity in the  subject. If the noun is singular, the verb must have a form to  correspond; if the noun is plural, the verb has another, corresponding  form.[54] Comparison with such forms as _I kill_ and _you kill_ shows,  moreover, that the _-s_ has exclusive reference to a person other than  the speaker or the one spoken to. We conclude, therefore, that it  connotes a personal relation as well as the notion of singularity. And  comparison with a sentence like _the farmer killed the duckling_  indicates that there is implied in this overburdened _-s_ a distinct  reference to present time. Statement as such and personal reference may  well be looked upon as inherently relational concepts. Number is  evidently felt by those who speak English as involving a necessary  relation, otherwise there would be no reason to express the concept  twice, in the noun and in the verb. Time also is clearly felt as a  relational concept; if it were not, we should be allowed to say _the  farmer killed-s_ to correspond to _the farmer kill-s_. Of the four  concepts inextricably interwoven in the _-s_ suffix, all are felt as  relational, two necessarily so. The distinction between a truly  relational concept and one that is so felt and treated, though it need  not be in the nature of things, will receive further attention in a  moment.    [Footnote 54: It is, of course, an \"accident\" that _-s_ denotes  plurality in the noun, singularity in the verb.]    Finally, I can radically disturb the relational cut of the sentence by  changing the order of its elements. If the positions of _farmer_ and  _kills_ are interchanged, the sentence reads _kills the farmer the  duckling_, which is most naturally interpreted as an unusual but not  unintelligible mode of asking the question, _does the farmer kill the  duckling?_ In this new sentence the act is not conceived as necessarily  taking place at all. It may or it may not be happening, the implication  being that the speaker wishes to know the truth of the matter and that  the person spoken to is expected to give him the information. The  interrogative sentence possesses an entirely different \"modality\" from  the declarative one and implies a markedly different attitude of the  speaker towards his companion. An even more striking change in personal  relations is effected if we interchange _the farmer_ and _the duckling_.  _The duckling kills the farmer_ involves precisely the same subjects of  discourse and the same type of activity as our first sentence, but the  roles of these subjects of discourse are now reversed. The duckling has  turned, like the proverbial worm, or, to put it in grammatical  terminology, what was \"subject\" is now \"object,\" what was object is now  subject.    The following tabular statement analyzes the sentence from the point of  view of the concepts expressed in it and of the grammatical processes  employed for their expression.     I. CONCRETE CONCEPTS:      1. First subject of discourse: _farmer_      2. Second subject of discourse: _duckling_      3. Activity: _kill_      ---- analyzable into:    A. RADICAL CONCEPTS:          1. Verb: _(to) farm_          2. Noun: _duck_          3. Verb: _kill_    B. DERIVATIONAL CONCEPTS:          1. Agentive: expressed by suffix _-er_          2. Diminutive: expressed by suffix _-ling_  II. RELATIONAL CONCEPTS:      Reference:        1. Definiteness of reference to first subject of discourse:            expressed by first _the_, which has preposed position        2. Definiteness of reference to second subject of discourse:            expressed by second _the_, which has preposed position      Modality:        3. Declarative: expressed by sequence of \"subject\" plus verb; and            implied by suffixed _-s_      Personal relations:        4. Subjectivity of _farmer_: expressed by position of _farmer_            before kills; and by suffixed _-s_        5. Objectivity of _duckling_: expressed by position of _duckling_            after _kills_      Number:        6. Singularity of first subject of discourse: expressed by lack of            plural suffix in _farmer_; and by suffix _-s_ in following verb        7. Singularity of second subject of discourse: expressed by lack            of plural suffix in _duckling_      Time:        8. Present: expressed by lack of preterit suffix in verb; and by            suffixed _-s_    In this short sentence of five words there are expressed, therefore,  thirteen distinct concepts, of which three are radical and concrete, two  derivational, and eight relational. Perhaps the most striking result of  the analysis is a renewed realization of the curious lack of accord in  our language between function and form. The method of suffixing is used  both for derivational and for relational elements; independent words or  radical elements express both concrete ideas (objects, activities,  qualities) and relational ideas (articles like _the_ and _a_; words  defining case relations, like _of_, _to_, _for_, _with_, _by_; words  defining local relations, like _in_, _on_, _at_); the same relational  concept may be expressed more than once (thus, the singularity of  _farmer_ is both negatively expressed in the noun and positively in the  verb); "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1265"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#18)"],[1," theatricals. Thirty years later his fellow--students recalled with  delight the fits of laughter into which they had been sent by Prince  Albert's mimicry. The verve with which his Serene Highness reproduced  the tones and gestures of one of the professors who used to point to  a picture of a row of houses in Venice with the remark, \"That is the  Ponte-Realte,\" and of another who fell down in a race and was obliged to  look for his spectacles, was especially appreciated.    After a year at Bonn, the time had come for a foreign tour, and Baron  Stockmar arrived from England to accompany the Prince on an expedition  to Italy. The Baron had been already, two years previously, consulted  by King Leopold as to his views upon the proposed marriage of Albert  and Victoria. His reply had been remarkable. With a characteristic  foresight, a characteristic absence of optimism, a characteristic sense  of the moral elements in the situation, Stockmar had pointed out what  were, in his opinion, the conditions essential to make the marriage a  success. Albert, he wrote, \"was a fine young fellow, well grown for his  age, with agreeable and valuable qualities; and it was probable that  in a few years he would turn out a strong handsome man, of a kindly,  simple, yet dignified demeanour. Thus, externally, he possesses  all that pleases the sex, and at all times and in all countries must  please.\" Supposing, therefore, that Victoria herself was in favour of  the marriage, the further question arose as to whether Albert's mental  qualities were such as to fit him for the position of husband of the  Queen of England. On this point, continued the Baron, one heard much to  his credit; the Prince was said to be discreet and intelligent; but  all such judgments were necessarily partial, and the Baron preferred to  reserve his opinion until he could come to a trustworthy conclusion from  personal observation. And then he added: \"But all this is not enough.  The young man ought to have not merely great ability, but a right  ambition, and great force of will as well. To pursue for a lifetime a  political career so arduous demands more than energy and inclination--it  demands also that earnest frame of mind which is ready of its own accord  to sacrifice mere pleasure to real usefulness. If he is not satisfied  hereafter with the consciousness of having achieved one of the most  influential positions in Europe, how often will he feel tempted to  repent his adventure! If he does not from the very outset accept it as a  vocation of grave responsibility, on the efficient performance of  which his honour and happiness depend, there is small likelihood of his  succeeding.\"    Such were the views of Stockmar on the qualifications necessary for the  due fulfilment of that destiny which Albert's family had marked out for  him; and he hoped, during the tour in Italy, to come to some conclusion  as to how far the prince possessed them. Albert on his side was much  impressed by the Baron, whom he had previously seen but rarely; he  also became acquainted, for the first time in his life, with a young  Englishman, Lieutenant Francis Seymour, who had been engaged to  accompany him, whom he found sehr liebens-wurdig, and with whom he  struck up a warm friendship. He delighted in the galleries and scenery  of Florence, though with Rome he was less impressed. \"But for some  beautiful palaces,\" he said, \"it might just as well be any town in  Germany.\" In an interview with Pope Gregory XVI, he took the opportunity  of displaying his erudition. When the Pope observed that the Greeks  had taken their art from the Etruscans, Albert replied that, on the  contrary, in his opinion, they had borrowed from the Egyptians: his  Holiness politely acquiesced. Wherever he went he was eager to increase  his knowledge, and, at a ball in Florence, he was observed paying no  attention whatever to the ladies, and deep in conversation with the  learned Signor Capponi. \"Voila un prince dont nous pouvons etre fiers,\"  said the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who was standing by: \"la belle danseuse  l'attend, le savant l'occupe.\"    On his return to Germany, Stockmar's observations, imparted to King  Leopold, were still critical. Albert, he said, was intelligent,  kind, and amiable; he was full of the best intentions and the noblest  resolutions, and his judgment was in many things beyond his years. But  great exertion was repugnant to him; he seemed to be too willing to  spare himself, and his good resolutions too often came to nothing. It  was particularly unfortunate that he took not the slightest interest  in politics, and never read a newspaper. In his manners, too, there was  still room for improvement. \"He will always,\" said the Baron, \"have more  success with men than with women, in whose society he shows too little  empressement, and is too indifferent and retiring.\" One other feature  of the case was noted by the keen eye of the old physician: the Prince's  constitution was not a strong one. Yet, on the whole, he was favourable  to the projected marriage. But by now the chief obstacle seemed to lie  in another quarter, Victoria was apparently determined to commit herself  to nothing. And so it happened that when Albert went to England he had  made up his mind to withdraw entirely from the affair. Nothing would  induce him, he confessed to a friend, to be kept vaguely waiting;  he would break it all off at once. His reception at Windsor threw an  entirely new light upon the situation. The wheel of fortune turned  with a sudden rapidity; and he found, in the arms of Victoria, the  irrevocable assurance of his overwhelming fate.    II    He was not in love with her. Affection, gratitude, the natural reactions  to the unqualified devotion of a lively young cousin who was also  a queen--such feelings possessed him, but the ardours of reciprocal  passion were not his. Though he found that he liked Victoria very much,  what immediately interested him in his curious position was less her  than himself. Dazzled and delighted, riding, dancing, singing, laughing,  amid the splendours of Windsor, he was aware of a new sensation--the  stirrings of ambition in his breast. His place would indeed be a high,  an enviable one! And then, on the instant, came another thought. The  teaching of religion, the admonitions of Stockmar, his own inmost  convictions, all spoke with the same utterance. He would not be there to  please himself, but for a very different purpose--to do good. He must be  \"noble, manly, and princely in all things,\" he would have \"to live and  to sacrifice himself for the benefit of his new country;\" to \"use his  powers and endeavours for a great object--that of promoting the welfare  of multitudes of his fellowmen.\" One serious thought led on to another.  The wealth and the bustle of the English Court might be delightful for  the moment, but, after all, it was Coburg that had his heart. \"While  I shall be untiring,\" he wrote to his grandmother, \"in my efforts and  labours for the country to which I shall in future belong, and where  I am called to so high a position, I shall never cease ein treuer  Deutscher, Coburger, Gothaner zu sein.\" And now he must part from Coburg  for ever! Sobered and sad, he sought relief in his brother Ernest's  company; the two young men would shut themselves up together, and,  sitting down at the pianoforte, would escape from the present and the  future in the sweet familiar gaiety of a Haydn duet.    They returned to Germany; and while Albert, for a few farewell months,  enjoyed, for the last time, the happiness of home, Victoria, for the  last time, resumed her old life in London and Windsor. She corresponded  daily with her future husband in a mingled flow of German and English;  but the accustomed routine reasserted itself; the business and the  pleasures of the day would brook no interruption; Lord M. was once  more constantly beside her; and the Tories were as intolerable as ever.  Indeed, they were more so. For now, in these final moments, the old feud  burst out with redoubled fury. The impetuous sovereign found, to her  chagrin, that there might be disadvantages in being the declared enemy  of one of the great parties in the State. On two occasions, the Tories  directly thwarted her in a matter on which she had set her heart. She  wished her husband's rank to be axed by statute, and their opposition  prevented it. She wished her husband to receive a settlement from the  nation of L50,000 a year; and, again owing to the Tories, he was only  allowed L30,000. It was too bad. When the question was discussed in  Parliament, it had been pointed out that the bulk of the population was  suffering from great poverty, and that L30,000 was the whole revenue of  Coburg; but her uncle Leopold had been given L50,000, and it would  be monstrous to give Albert less. Sir Robert Peel--it might have been  expected--had had the effrontery to speak and vote for the smaller sum.  She was very angry; and determined to revenge herself by omitting to  invite a single Tory to her wedding. She would make an exception in  favour of old Lord Liverpool, but even the Duke of Wellington she  refused to ask. When it was represented to her that it would amount to  a national scandal if the Duke were absent from her wedding, she was  angrier than ever. \"What! That old rebel! I won't have him:\" she  was reported to have said. Eventually she was induced to send him an  invitation; but she made no attempt to conceal the bitterness of her  feelings, and the Duke himself was only too well aware of all that had  passed.    Nor was it only against the Tories that her irritation rose. As the time  for her wedding approached, her temper grew steadily sharper and  more arbitrary. Queen Adelaide annoyed her. King Leopold, too, was  \"ungracious\" in his correspondence; \"Dear Uncle,\" she told Albert, \"is  given to believe that he must rule the roost everywhere. However,\" she  added"]]]
