And here he found the light he long had sought,    Gilding at once Nirvana's blissful heights    And lighting life's sequestered, lowly vales--    A light whose inner life is perfect love,    A love whose outer form is living light,    Nirvana's Sun, the Light of all the worlds,[4]    Heart of the universe, whose mighty pulse    Gives heaven, the worlds and even hell their life,    Maker and Father of all living things    Matreya's[5] self, the Lover, Saviour, Guide,    The last, the greatest Buddha, who must rule    As Lord of all before the kalpa's end.      The way of life--the noble eightfold path,    The way of truth, the Dharma-pada--found,    With joy he bade his loving guides farewell,    With joy he turned from all those blissful scenes.    And when the rosy dawn next tinged the east,    And morning's burst of song had waked the day,    With staff and bowl he left the sacred tree--    Where pilgrims, passing pathless mountain-heights,    And desert sands, and ocean's stormy waves,    From every nation, speaking every tongue,    Should come in after-times to breathe their vows--    Beginning on that day his pilgrimage    Of five and forty years from place to place,    Breaking the cruel chains of caste and creed,    Teaching the law of love, the way of life.      [1]The later Buddhists make much of the doctrine of metempsychosis, but  in the undoubted sayings and Sutras or sermons of Buddha I find no  mention of it except in this way as the last hope of those who persist  through life in evil, while the good after death reach the other shore,  or Nirvana, where there is no more birth or death.    [2]This great and fundamental truth, lying as the basis of human action  and responsibility, was recognized by Homer, who makes Jupiter say:      \"Perverse mankind, whose wills created free,    Charge all their woes to absolute decree.\"    Odyssey, Book I, lines 41 and 42    [3]After examining the attempted explanations of that remarkable  passage, the original of which is given at the end of the sixth book of  Arnold's \"Light of Asia,\" I am satisfied this is its true  interpretation.  It is not the death of the body, for he lived  forty-five years afterwards, much less the annihilation of the soul, as  some have imagined, but the conquest of the passions and gross and  selfish desires which make human life a prison, the very object and end  of the highest Christian teaching's and aspirations.    [4] \"Know then that heaven and earth's compacted frame,      And flowing waters, and the starry flame,      And both the radiant lights, one common soul      Inspires and feeds and animates the whole.\"            Dryden's Virgil, Book VI, line 360.    [5]Buddha predicted that Matreya (Love incarnate) would be his  successor (see Beal's Fa Hian, page 137, note 2, and page 162; also  Hardy's Manual, page 386, and Oldenburgh's Buddhism, page 386), who was  to come at the end of five hundred years at the end of his Dharma (see  Buddhism and Christianity, Lillie, page 2).    It is a remarkable fact that this successor is the most common object  of worship among Buddhists, so that the most advanced Buddhists and the  most earnest Christians have the same object of worship under different  names.          BOOK VII.      Alone on his great mission going forth,    Down Phalgu's valley he retraced his steps,    Down past the seat where subtle Mara sat,    And past the fountain where the siren sang,    And past the city, through the fruitful fields    And gardens he had traversed day by day    For six long years, led by a strong desire    To show his Brahman teachers his new light.    But ah! the change a little time had wrought!    A new-made stupa held their gathered dust,    While they had gone where all see eye to eye,    The darkness vanished and the river crossed.      Then turning sadly from this hallowed spot--    Hallowed by strivings for a higher life    More than by dust this little mound contained--    He sought beneath the spreading banyan-tree    His five companions, whom he lately left    Sad at his own departure from the way    The sacred Vedas and the fathers taught.    They too had gone, to Varanassi[1] gone,    High seat and centre of all sacred lore.      The day was well-nigh spent; his cave was near,    Where he had spent so many weary years,    And as he thither turned and upward climbed,    The shepherd's little child who watched the flock    His love had rescued from the bloody knife,    Upon a rock that rose above his path    Saw him pass by, and ran with eagerness    To bear the news.  Joy filled that humble home.    They owed him all.  The best they had they brought,    And offered it with loving gratitude.    The master ate, and as he ate he taught    These simple souls the great, the living truth    That love is more than costly sacrifice;    That daily duties done are highest praise;    That when life's duties end its sorrows end,    And higher joys await the pure in heart.    Their eager souls drank in his living words    As those who thirst drink in the living spring.    Then reverently they kissed his garment's hem,    And home returned, while he lay down to sleep.    And sweetly as a babe the master slept--    No doubts, no darkness, and no troubled dreams.    When rosy dawn next lit the eastern sky,    And morning's grateful coolness filled the air,    The master rose and his ablutions made.    With bowl and staff in hand he took his way    Toward Varanassi, hoping there to find    The five toward whom his earnest spirit yearned.      Ten days have passed, and now the rising sun.    That hangs above the distant mountain-peaks    Is mirrored back by countless rippling waves    That dance upon the Ganges' yellow stream,    Swollen by rains and melted mountain-snows,    And glorifies the thousand sacred fanes[2]    With gilded pinnacles and spires and domes    That rise in beauty on its farther bank,    While busy multitudes glide up and down    With lightly dipping oars and swelling sails.    And pilgrims countless as those shining waves,    From far and near, from mountain, hill and plain,    With dust and travel-stained, foot-sore, heart-sick,    Here came to bathe within the sacred stream,    Here came to die upon its sacred banks,    Seeking to wash the stains of guilt away,    Seeking to lay their galling burdens down.    Scoff not at these poor heavy-laden souls!    Blindly they seek, but that all-seeing Eye    That sees the tiny sparrow when it falls,    Is watching them, His angels hover near.    Who knows what visions meet their dying gaze?    Who knows what joys await those troubled hearts?      The ancient writings say that having naught    To pay the ferryman, the churl refused    To ferry him across the swollen stream,    When he was raised and wafted through the air.    What matter whether that all-powerful Love    Which moves the worlds, and bears with all our sins,    Sent him a chariot and steeds of fire,    Or moved the heart of some poor fisherman    To bear him over for a brother's sake?    All power is His, and men can never thwart    His all-embracing purposes of love.    Now past the stream and near the sacred grove    The deer-park called, the five saw him approach.    But grieved at his departure from the way    The ancient sages taught, said with themselves    They would not rise or do him reverence.    But as he nearer came, the tender love,    The holy calm that shone upon his face,    Made them at once forget their firm resolve.    They rose together, doing reverence,    And bringing water washed his way-soiled feet,    Gave him a mat, and said as with one voice:    \"Master Gautama, welcome to our grove.    Here rest your weary limbs and share our shade.    Have you escaped from karma's fatal chains    And gained clear vision--found the living light?\"      \"Call me not master.  Profitless to you    Six years have passed,\" the Buddha answered them,    \"In doubt and darkness groping blindly on.    But now at last the day has surely dawned.    These eyes have seen Nirvana's sacred Sun,    And found the noble eightfold path that mounts    From life's low levels, mounts from death's dark shades    To changeless day, to never-ending rest.\"    Then with the prophet's newly kindled zeal,    Zeal for the truth his opened eyes had seen,    Zeal for the friends whose struggles he had shared,    Softened by sympathy and tender love,    He taught how selfishness was primal cause    Of every ill to which frail flesh is heir,    The poisoned fountain whence all sorrows flow,    The loathsome worm that coils about the root    And kills the germ of every springing joy,    The subtle foe that sows by night the tares    That quickly springing choke the goodly seed    Which left to grow would fill the daily life    With balmy fragrance and with precious fruit.    He showed that selfishness was life's sole bane    And love its great and sovereign antidote.    He showed how selfishness would change the child    From laughing"]]]
