So the father would retire, muttering stormily--\"But when does  this painter ever paint?\" . . .    At first Julio had tried to win renown with his brush, believing that  it would prove an easy task. In true artist fashion, he collected his  friends around him, South American boys with nothing to do but enjoy  life, scattering money ostentatiously so that everybody might know  of their generosity. With serene audacity, the young canvas-dauber  undertook to paint portraits. He loved good painting, \"distinctive\"  painting, with the cloying sweetness of a romance, that copied only the  forms of women. He had money, a good studio, his father was standing  behind him ready to help--why shouldn't he accomplish as much as many  others who lacked his opportunities? . . .    So he began his work by coloring a canvas entitled, \"The Dance of the  Hours,\" a mere pretext for copying pretty girls and selecting buxom  models. These he would sketch at a mad speed, filling in the outlines  with blobs of multi-colored paint, and up to this point all went well.  Then he would begin to vacillate, remaining idle before the picture only  to put it in the corner in hope of later inspiration. It was the same  way with his various studies of feminine heads. Finding that he was  never able to finish anything, he soon became resigned, like one  who pants with fatigue before an obstacle waiting for a providential  interposition to save him. The important thing was to be a painter . . .  even though he might not paint anything. This afforded him the  opportunity, on the plea of lofty aestheticism, of sending out cards  of invitation and asking light women to his studio. He lived during  the night. Don Marcelo, upon investigating the artist's work, could not  contain his indignation. Every morning the two Desnoyers were accustomed  to greet the first hours of dawn--the father leaping from his bed, the  son, on his way home to his studio to throw himself upon his couch not  to wake till midday.    The credulous Dona Luisa would invent the most absurd explanations to  defend her son. Who could tell? Perhaps he had the habit of painting  during the night, utilizing it for original work. Men resort to so many  devilish things! . . .    Desnoyers knew very well what these nocturnal gusts of genius were  amounting to--scandals in the restaurants of Montmartre, and scrimmages,  many scrimmages. He and his gang, who believed that at seven a full  dress or Tuxedo was indispensable, were like a band of Indians, bringing  to Paris the wild customs of the plains. Champagne always made them  quarrelsome. So they broke and paid, but their generosities were almost  invariably followed by a scuffle. No one could surpass Julio in the  quick slap and the ready card. His father heard with a heavy heart the  news brought him by some friends thinking to flatter his vanity--his  son was always victorious in these gentlemanly encounters; he it was who  always scratched the enemy's skin. The painter knew more about fencing  than art. He was a champion with various weapons; he could box, and was  even skilled in the favorite blows of the prize fighters of the slums.  \"Useless as a drone, and as dangerous, too,\" fretted his father. And  yet in the back of his troubled mind fluttered an irresistible  satisfaction--an animal pride in the thought that this hare-brained  terror was his own.    For a while, he thought that he had hit upon a way of withdrawing his  son from such an existence. The relatives in Berlin had visited  the Desnoyers in their castle of Villeblanche. With good-natured  superiority, Karl von Hartrott had appreciated the rich and rather  absurd accumulations of his brother-in-law. They were not bad; he  admitted that they gave a certain cachet to the home in Paris and to the  castle. They smacked of the possessions of titled nobility. But Germany!  . . . The comforts and luxuries in his country! . . . He just wished his  brother-in-law to admire the way he lived and the noble friendships that  embellished his opulence. And so he insisted in his letters that the  Desnoyers family should return their visit. This change of environment  might tone Julio down a little. Perhaps his ambition might waken on  seeing the diligence of his cousins, each with a career. The Frenchman  had, besides, an underlying belief in the more corrupt influence of  Paris as compared with the purity of the customs in Patriarchal Germany.    They were there four months. In a little while Desnoyers felt ready to  retreat. Each to his own kind; he would never be able to understand  such people. Exceedingly amiable, with an abject amiability and evident  desire to please, but constantly blundering through a tactless desire to  make their grandeur felt. The high-toned friends of Hartrott emphasized  their love for France, but it was the pious love that a weak and  mischievous child inspires, needing protection. And they would accompany  their affability with all manner of inopportune memories of the wars in  which France had been conquered. Everything in Germany--a monument, a  railroad station, a simple dining-room device, instantly gave rise to  glorious comparisons. \"In France, you do not have this,\" \"Of course, you  never saw anything like this in America.\"    Don Marcelo came away fatigued by so much condescension, and his wife  and daughter refused to be convinced that the elegance of Berlin could  be superior to Paris. Chichi, with audacious sacrilege, scandalized her  cousins by declaring that she could not abide the corseted officers with  immovable monocle, who bowed to the women with such automatic rigidity,  blending their gallantries with an air of superiority.    Julio, guided by his cousins, was saturated in the virtuous atmosphere  of Berlin. With the oldest, \"The Sage,\" he had nothing to do. He was a  poor creature devoted to his books who patronized all the family with  a protecting air. It was the others, the sub-lieutenants or military  students, who proudly showed him the rounds of German joy.    Julio was accordingly introduced to all the night  restaurants--imitations of those in Paris, but on a much larger scale.  The women who in Paris might be counted by the dozens appeared here  in hundreds. The scandalous drunkenness here never came by chance,  but always by design as an indispensable part of the gaiety. All was  grandiose, glittering, colossal. The libertines diverted themselves  in platoons, the public got drunk in companies, the harlots presented  themselves in regiments. He felt a sensation of disgust before these  timid and servile females, accustomed to blows, who were so eagerly  trying to reimburse themselves for the losses and exposures of their  business. For him, it was impossible to celebrate with hoarse ha-has,  like his cousins, the discomfiture of these women when they realized  that they had wasted so many hours without accomplishing more than  abundant drinking. The gross obscenity, so public and noisy, like a  parade of riches, was loathsome to Julio. \"There is nothing like this  in Paris,\" his cousins repeatedly exulted as they admired the stupendous  salons, the hundreds of men and women in pairs, the thousands of  tipplers. \"No, there certainly was nothing like that in Paris.\" He was  sick of such boundless pretension. He seemed to be attending a fiesta  of hungry mariners anxious at one swoop to make amends for all former  privations. Like his father, he longed to get away. It offended his  aesthetic sense.    Don Marcelo returned from this visit with melancholy resignation. Those  people had undoubtedly made great strides. He was not such a blind  patriot that he could not admit what was so evident. Within a few years  they had transformed their country, and their industry was astonishing  . . . but, well . . . it was simply impossible to have anything to do  with them. Each to his own, but may they never take a notion to envy  their neighbor! . . . Then he immediately repelled this last suspicion  with the optimism of a business man.    \"They are going to be very rich,\" he thought. \"Their affairs are  prospering, and he that is rich does not hunt quarrels. That war of  which some crazy fools are always dreaming would be an impossible  thing.\"    Young Desnoyers renewed his Parisian existence, living entirely in the  studio and going less and less to his father's home. Dona Luisa began to  speak of a certain Argensola, a very learned young Spaniard, believing  that his counsels might prove most helpful to Julio. She did not know  exactly whether this new companion was friend, master or servant. The  studio habitues also had their doubts. The literary ones always spoke  of Argensola as a painter. The painters recognized only his ability as a  man of letters. He was among those who used to come up to the studio  of winter afternoons, attracted by the ruddy glow of the stove and the  wines secretly provided by the mother, holding forth authoritatively  before the often-renewed bottle and the box of cigars lying open on the  table. One night, he slept on the divan, as he had no regular quarters.  After that first night, he lived entirely in the studio.    Julio soon discovered in him an admirable reflex of his own personality.  He knew that Argensola had come third-class from Madrid with twenty  francs in his pocket, in order to \"capture glory,\" to use his own words.  Upon observing that the Spaniard was painting with as much difficulty  as himself, with the same wooden and childish strokes, which are so  characteristic of the make-believe artists and pot-boilers, the routine  workers concerned themselves with color and other rank fads. Argensola  was a psychological artist, a painter of souls. And his disciple, felt  astonished and almost displeased on learning what a comparatively simple  thing it was to paint a soul. Upon a bloodless countenance, with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1487"],[0,"The Perfect Wagnerite: A Commentary on the Niblung's Ring (#18)"],[1,"to go out and forage for food and drink. In fact,  he is on the way to his drinking-pool when Siegfried kills him. And  Siegfried himself has no more use for gold than Fafnir: the only  difference between them in this respect is that Siegfried does not waste  his time in watching a barren treasure that is no use to him, whereas  Fafnir sacrifices his humanity and his life merely to prevent anybody  else getting it. This contrast is true to human nature; but it shunts  The Ring drama off the economic lines of the allegory. In real life,  Fafnir is not a miser: he seeks dividends, comfortable life, and  admission to the circles of Wotan and Loki. His only means of procuring  these is to restore the gold to Alberic in exchange for scrip in  Alberic's enterprises. Thus fortified with capital, Alberic exploits his  fellow dwarfs as before, and also exploits Fafnir's fellow giants who  have no capital. What is more, the toil, forethought and self-control  which the exploitation involves, and the self-respect and social esteem  which its success wins, effect an improvement in Alberic's own character  which neither Marx nor Wagner appear to have foreseen. He discovers that  to be a dull, greedy, narrow-minded money-grubber is not the way to make  money on a large scale; for though greed may suffice to turn tens  into hundreds and even hundreds into thousands, to turn thousands into  hundreds of thousands requires magnanimity and a will to power rather  than to pelf. And to turn thousands into millions, Alberic must make  himself an earthly providence for masses of workmen: he must create  towns and govern markets. In the meantime, Fafnir, wallowing in  dividends which he has done nothing to earn, may rot, intellectually  and morally, from mere disuse of his energies and lack of incentive to  excel; but the more imbecile he becomes, the more dependent he is upon  Alberic, and the more the responsibility of keeping the world-machine in  working order falls upon Alberic. Consequently, though Alberic in 1850  may have been merely the vulgar Manchester Factory-owner portrayed by  Engels, in 1876 he was well on the way towards becoming Krupp of Essen  or Carnegie of Homestead.    Now, without exaggerating the virtues of these gentlemen, it will  be conceded by everybody except perhaps those veteran German  Social-Democrats who have made a cult of obsolescence under the name  of Marxism, that the modern entrepreneur is not to be displaced and  dismissed so lightly as Alberic is dismissed in The Ring. They are  really the masters of the whole situation. Wotan is hardly less  dependent on them than Fafnir; the War-Lord visits their work, acclaims  them in stirring speeches, and casts down their enemies; whilst Loki  makes commercial treaties for them and subjects all his diplomacy to  their approval.    The end cannot come until Siegfried learns Alberic's trade and shoulders  Alberic's burden. Not having as yet done so, he is still completely  mastered by Alberic. He does not even rebel against him except when he  is too stupid and ignorant, or too romantically impracticable, to see  that Alberic's work, like Wotan's work and Loki's work, is necessary  work, and that therefore Alberic can never be superseded by a warrior,  but only by a capable man of business who is prepared to continue his  work without a day's intermission. Even though the proletarians of all  lands were to become \"class conscious,\" and obey the call of Marx by  uniting to carry the Class struggle to a proletarian victory in  which all capital should become common property, and all Monarchs,  Millionaires, Landlords and Capitalists become common citizens, the  triumphant proletarians would have either to starve in Anarchy the next  day or else do the political and industrial work which is now being  done tant bien que mal by our Romanoffs, our Hohenzollerns, our Krupps,  Carnegies, Levers, Pierpont Morgans, and their political retinues. And  in the meantime these magnates must defend their power and property  with all their might against the revolutionary forces until these  forces become positive, executive, administrative forces, instead of the  conspiracies of protesting, moralizing, virtuously indignant amateurs  who mistook Marx for a man of affairs and Thiers for a stage villain.  But all this represents a development of which one gathers no forecast  from Wagner or Marx. Both of them prophesied the end of our epoch, and,  so far as one can guess, prophesied it rightly. They also brought its  industrial history up to the year 1848 far more penetratingly than the  academic historians of their time. But they broke off there and left  a void between 1848 and the end, in which we, who have to live in that  period, get no guidance from them. The Marxists wandered for years  in this void, striving, with fanatical superstition, to suppress the  Revisionists who, facing the fact that the Social-Democratic party was  lost, were trying to find the path by the light of contemporary history  instead of vainly consulting the oracle in the pages of Das Kapital.  Marx himself was too simpleminded a recluse and too full of the  validity of his remoter generalizations, and the way in which the rapid  integration of capital in Trusts and Kartels was confirming them, to be  conscious of the void himself.    Wagner, on the other hand, was comparatively a practical man. It is  possible to learn more of the world by producing a single opera, or even  conducting a single orchestral rehearsal, than by ten years reading in  the Library of the British Museum. Wagner must have learnt between Das  Rheingold and the Kaisermarsch that there are yet several dramas to be  interpolated in The Ring after The Valkyries before the allegory can  tell the whole story, and that the first of these interpolated dramas  will be much more like a revised Rienzi than like Siegfried. If  anyone doubts the extent to which Wagner's eyes had been opened to the  administrative-childishness and romantic conceit of the heroes of  the revolutionary generation that served its apprenticeship on the  barricades of 1848-9, and perished on those of 1870 under Thiers'  mitrailleuses, let him read Eine Kapitulation, that scandalous burlesque  in which the poet and composer of Siegfried, with the levity of a  schoolboy, mocked the French republicans who were doing in 1871 what he  himself was exiled for doing in 1849. He had set the enthusiasm of the  Dresden Revolution to his own greatest music; but he set the enthusiasm  of twenty years later in derision to the music of Rossini. There is  no mistaking the tune he meant to suggest by his doggerel of Republik,  Republik, Republik-lik-lik. The Overture to William Tell is there as  plainly as if it were noted down in full score.    In the case of such a man as Wagner, you cannot explain this volte-face  as mere jingoism produced by Germany's overwhelming victory in the  Franco-Prussian War, nor as personal spite against the Parisians for the  Tannhauser fiasco. Wagner had more cause for personal spite against  his own countrymen than he ever had against the French. No doubt his  outburst gratified the pettier feelings which great men have in common  with small ones; but he was not a man to indulge in such gratifications,  or indeed to feel them as gratifications, if he had not arrived at a  profound philosophical contempt for the inadequacy of the men who were  trying to wield Nothung, and who had done less work for Wagner's own  art than a single German King and he, too, only a mad one. Wagner had by  that time done too much himself not to know that the world is ruled by  deeds, not by good intentions, and that one efficient sinner is worth  ten futile saints and martyrs.    I need not elaborate the point further in these pages. Like all men of  genius, Wagner had exceptional sincerity, exceptional respect for facts,  exceptional freedom from the hypnotic influence of sensational popular  movements, exceptional sense of the realities of political power as  distinguished from the presences and idolatries behind which the real  masters of modern States pull their wires and train their guns. When he  scored Night Falls On The Gods, he had accepted the failure of Siegfried  and the triumph of the Wotan-Loki-Alberic-trinity as a fact. He had  given up dreaming of heroes, heroines, and final solutions, and had  conceived a new protagonist in Parsifal, whom he announced, not as  a hero, but as a fool; who was armed, not with a sword which cut  irresistibly, but with a spear which he held only on condition that he  did not use it; and who instead of exulting in the slaughter of a  dragon was frightfully ashamed of having shot a swan. The change in the  conception of the Deliverer could hardly be more complete. It reflects  the change which took place in Wagner's mind between the composition  of The Rhine Gold and Night Falls On The Gods; and it explains why  he dropped The Ring allegory and fell back on the status quo ante by  Lohengrinizing.    If you ask why he did not throw Siegfried into the waste paper basket  and rewrite The Ring from The Valkyries onwards, one must reply that the  time had not come for such a feat. Neither Wagner nor anyone else then  living knew enough to achieve it. Besides, what he had already done had  reached the limit of even his immense energy and perseverance and so  he did the best he could with the unfinished and for ever unfinishable  work, rounding it off with an opera much as Rossini rounded off some of  his religious compositions with a galop. Only, Rossini on such occasions  wrote in his score \"Excusez du peu,\" but Wagner left us to find out the  change for ourselves, perhaps to test how far we had really followed his  meaning.          WAGNER'S OWN EXPLANATION    And now, having given my explanation of The Ring, can I give Wagner's  explanation of it? If I could (and I can) I should not by any means  accept it as conclusive. "]]]
