I want to speak  with you. I am in great trouble.\"    So the Lizard drew near, wagging her head wisely, for it pleased her to  be consulted by the big Crocodile. \"What can it be, dear friend, that is  troubling you this day?\" she said amiably. \"Surely, no one would be so  rude or rash as to offend the King of Congo River. But tell me your  trouble and perhaps I can advise you.\"    \"Listen to me, then,\" said the Crocodile. \"Almost every day a nice fat  Hen,--Oh, Mbambi! so delightfully fat and tempting!--comes to my river  to feed. Well, why don't I make her my dinner? you ask. Now hearken:  each time, just as I am about to catch her and carry her to my home she  startles me by calling me '_Brother_.' Did you ever hear of anything so  maddening? Twice I have let her escape because of the word. But I can  stand it no longer, and I am on the way to Princess Nzambi to hold a  palaver about it.\" (By \"palaver\" the slangy Crocodile meant a long,  serious talk.)    \"Silly idiot!\" cried the Mbambi, not very politely. \"Do nothing of the  kind. You will only get the worst of the palaver and show your ignorance  before the wise Nzambi. Now listen to me. Don't you know, dear  Crocodile, that the Duck lives on the water, though she is neither a  fish nor a reptile? And the Duck lays eggs. The Turtle does the same,  though she is no bird. The Hen lays eggs, just as I do; and I am Mbambi,  the great Lizard. As for you, dear old Hungry-Mouth, you know that at  this moment\"--here she whispered discreetly, looking around to see that  no one was listening,--\"at this moment in a snug nest dug out of the  sand on the banks of the Congo, Mrs. Crocodile has covered with leaves  to hide them from your enemies sixty smooth white eggs. And in a few  weeks out of these will scamper sixty little wiggly Crocodiles, your  dear, homely, scaly, hungry-mouthed children. Yes, we all lay eggs, my  silly friend, and so in a sense we are all brothers, as the Hen has  said.\"    \"Sh!\" whispered the Crocodile, nervously. \"Don't mention those eggs of  mine, I beg of you. Some one might overhear. What you say is undoubtedly  true,\" he added pensively, after thinking a few moments. \"Then I suppose  I must give up my tempting dinner of Hen. I cannot eat my Sister, can  I?\"    \"Of course you cannot,\" said the Mbambi, as he rustled away through the  jungle. \"We can't have everything we want in this world.\"    \"No, I see we cannot,\" sighed the Crocodile, as he waddled back towards  the banks of the Congo. Now in the same old spot he found the Hen, who  had been improving his absence by greedily stuffing herself on  beetle-bugs, flies, and mosquitoes until she was so fat that she could  not run away at the Crocodile's approach. She could only stand and  squawk feebly, fluttering her ridiculous wings.    But the Crocodile only said, \"Good evening, Sister,\" very politely, and  passing her by with a wag of his enormous tail sank with a plop into the  waters of the Congo.    And ever since that time the Hen has eaten her dinner in tranquil peace,  undisturbed by the sight of floating log or basking shape of knobby  green. For she knows that old Hungry-Mouth will not eat his Sister, the  Hen.          THE THRUSH AND THE CUCKOO      In the wonderful days of old it is said that Christ and Saint Peter went  together upon a journey. It was a beautiful day in March, and the earth  was just beginning to put on her summer gorgeousness. As the two  travelers were passing near a great forest they spied a Thrush sitting  on a tree singing and singing as hard as he could. And he cocked his  head as if he was very proud of something.    Saint Peter stopped at the foot of the tree and said, \"I wish you a good  day, Thrush!\"    \"I have no time to thank you,\" chirped the Thrush pertly.    \"Why not, pretty Thrush?\" asked Saint Peter in surprise. \"You have all  the time in the world and nothing to do but sing.\"    \"You mistake,\" cried the Thrush. \"I am making the summer! It is I, I, I  who make the green grass grow and the flowers bud. Look, how even now  the world is growing beautiful in answer to my song.\" And the conceited  little bird continued to warble as hard as he could,--        \"To-day I shall marry, I and no other!      To-morrow my brother.\"    Christ and Saint Peter looked at each other and smiled, then went upon  their way without another word, leaving the Thrush to continue his task  of making the summer.    This was in the morning. But before midday the clouds gathered and the  sky darkened, and at noon a cold rain began to drip. The poor Thrush  ceased his jubilant song and began to shiver in the March wind. By night  the snow was felling thick and fast, and where there had been a green  carpet on the earth was now spread a coverlet of snowy white. Shivering  and like to die of cold the Thrush took refuge under the tree in the  moss and dead leaves. He thought no more of his marriage, nor of his  brother's, but only of the danger which threatened him, and of the  discomfort.    The next morning Christ and Saint Peter, plodding through the  snow-drifts, came upon him again, and Saint Peter said as before, \"I  wish you good day, Thrush.\"    \"Thank you,\" answered the Thrush humbly, and his voice was shaky with  cold and sorrow.    \"What do you here on the cold ground, O Thrush-who-make-the-summer, and  why are you so sad?\" asked Saint Peter. And the Thrush piped feebly,--        \"To-day I must die, I and no other!      To-morrow my brother.\"    \"O foolish little bird,\" said Saint Peter. \"You boasted that you made  the summer. But see! The Lord's will has sent us back to the middle of  winter, to punish your boasting. You shall not die, he will send the sun  again to warm you. But hereafter beware how you take too much credit for  your little efforts.\"    Since that time March has ever been a treacherous and a changeful month.  Then the Thrush thinks not of marriage, but of his lesson learned in  past days, and wraps himself in his warmest feathers, waiting for the  Lord's will to be done. He is no longer boastful in his song, but sings  it humbly and sweetly to the Lord's glory, thanking him for the summer  which his goodness sends every year to happy bird and beast and child of  man.           *       *       *       *       *    Now after this adventure with the Thrush, Christ and Saint Peter went  upon their journey for many miles. At last, weary and hungry, they  passed a Baker's shop. From the window came the smell of new warm bread  baking in the oven, and Christ sent Saint Peter to ask the Baker for a  loaf. But the Baker, who was a stingy fellow, refused.    \"Go away with you!\" he cried. \"I give no bread to lazy beggars!\"    \"I ask it for my Master, who has traveled many miles and is most faint  and weary,\" said Saint Peter. But the Baker frowned and shook his head,  then strode into the inner shop, banging the door after him.    The Baker's wife and six daughters were standing at one side when these  things happened, and they heard all that took place. They were generous  and kind-hearted bodies, and tears stood in their eyes at the Baker's  rough words. As soon as he had gone out they wrapped up the loaf and  gave it stealthily to Saint Peter saying,--    \"Take the loaf for your Master, good man, and may he be refreshed by  it.\"    Saint Peter thanked and blessed them and took the loaf to Christ. And  for their charity the Lord set these good women in the sky as the Seven  Stars,--you may see them to this day shining in love upon the sleeping  world. But the wicked Baker he changed into a Cuckoo; and as long as he  sings his dreary song, \"Coo-coo! Coo-coo!\" in the spring, so long the  Seven Stars are visible in the heaven, so folk say.          THE OWL AND THE MOON      When the moon is round and full, if you look very carefully at the  golden disk you can see in shadowy outline the profile of a beautiful  lady. She is leaning forward as if looking down upon our earth, and  there is a little smile upon her sweet lips. This fair dame is Putri  Balan, the Princess of the Moon, and she smiles because she remembers  how once upon a time she cheated old Mr. Owl, her tiresome lover.    Putri Balan, so they tell you in Malay, was always very, very beautiful,  as we see her now. Like all the Malay women, Putri Balan loved to chew  the spicy betel-nut which turns one's lips a bright scarlet. It is  better, so they say, than any kind of candy, and it is considered much  nicer and more respectable than chewing-gum. So Putri Balan was not  unladylike, although she chewed her betel-nut all night long.    Now, ever since the day when Mr. Owl carelessly let the naughty little  Wren escape from prison, the shamed and sorry old fellow had never  dared to show his face abroad in daylight. Gradually his eyes grew  blurred and blinky, till now he could not see anything by day, even if  he were to try.    So it happens that there are many delightful things about which old Mr.  Owl does not know,--things which take place while the beautiful sun is  shining. But also there are marvelous sights, unknown to early-sleeping  birds, which he enjoys all by himself. For at night his queer eyes are  wonderfully strong and bright. All day long he sits in his hollow tree,  but when the other feathered folk are drowsing upon their roosts, or are  snugly rolled up in their little nests, with their heads tucked under  their downy wings, old Mr. Owl puts on his round spectacles and goes  a-prowling up and down the world through the woods and meadows (like  Haroun-al-Rashid in the streets of Bagdad), spying all sorts of queer  doings.    And this is how old Mr. Owl happened to see the fair Princess Putri  Balan, smiling down from her moon upon the sleeping world of birds who  had never seen her and never would see her in all her loveliness.

SUCCEEDS IN FINDING THEIR TRACES.    Previous however to putting this plan into execution, it was considered  advisable to visit the beach again, fifteen or sixteen miles distant, on  doing which next morning, with Mr. Spofforth and Warrup, we had the  satisfaction to find the feet-marks of five men on the sand, taking a  southerly direction. Warrup having pronounced them to be without doubt  the footsteps of white men, and not more than two or three days old, we  followed them eagerly along the shore for a mile, and then came to an  empty cask that had been washed on shore, together with several broken  bottles and a stone jar. On further examination part of the head of the  cask was found much cut with a knife, as if used for a plate, and near  the extinct embers of a small fire lay the bones of a fish, which Warrup  concluded had been picked on the morning of the previous day. Rejoiced at  having now got upon the right track, and being unwilling to lose time by  following it up from this spot, we took a good look round and returned to  our camp at Bookernyup by sunset, from whence we next morning started  early in a southerly direction, took up safely everything we had  concealed on the Moore River, and shortly after dark had completed 24  miles to a place called Kadjelup, where we halted on some deep pools  similar to those at Barrumbur.    Breakfasting early on the 15th, the baggage was despatched forward to  Neergabby, and at daybreak Mr. Spofforth, Kinchela (a private of the 21st  regiment) and Warrup accompanied me on horseback to the beach, which we  found eleven miles off, but to our great disappointment a very high tide  had totally obliterated all marks from the sand and left us in perplexity  and doubt. Concluding however that the missing party must be in advance  of us, and that they could not fail to observe the papers which had been  offered to their notice at the mouth of the Garban River, we turned our  steps that way; left a paper of directions in the event of their being  behind us, and carefully examined both beach and sandhills, as well as  the country immediately in rear of them. Twelve miles brought us to the  mouth of the river, and there we found everything as we had placed  it--not a mark near the beach except the footsteps of the native dog  prowling about the sandhills, and nothing which could lead to a belief  that the spot had been visited since we last left it. Somewhat  disappointed, although rejoicing in having now hemmed the unfortunate  absentees up into a narrow limit, within which we knew they MUST be  wandering towards Perth, we joined our party at Neergabby shortly after  dark, and observed on our way the traces of five natives who were  confidently said by Warrup to be Perth natives, sent to look after us  with intelligence. They had come along the coast from the south as far as  the mouth of the river, and had struck inland to the south-east on their  return. The conclusions of this intelligent lad on the occasion were  afterwards found to be strictly correct, even to the names of the men who  composed the party.    PROVIDENTIAL DISCOVERY OF THEM.    The early morning of the 16th found us all in busy preparation for the  day's proceedings and relying with reasonable confidence on a successful  issue to our exertions. The remainder of the party were sent back with  one horse to Kadjelup, whilst my indefatigable companion Mr. Spofforth  accompanied me, with Kinchela and the two natives and four horses, to  resume our examination of the beach to the north. Fifteen miles in a  north-west direction brought us to the desired spot, but still no sign  was apparent of its having been visited by any human being since  ourselves; we however commenced a close examination to the northward, and  at the end of a mile and a half had the infinite satisfaction of falling  in with three of the missing party, in the persons of Ruston, Stiles, and  Clotworthy, who had formed a portion of the wrecked boats' crews.    THEIR MISERABLE CONDITION.    The state of distress and exhaustion in which they were found on the  beach was truly pitiable and moving. With scarcely strength to drag one  foot after the other they had marched about a mile and a half that  morning until they encountered the bold rocky projection of land at which  we discovered them, and the passing of which they had given up as utterly  hopeless from want of sufficient strength to climb over it. Having been  three days without water except their own and the seawater, the former of  which they had saved in their canteens, and emptied out before us, and  their only food being such nourishment as they could obtain from chewing  a coarse rushy plant which grew about high-water mark, it cannot be  matter of surprise that they were almost frantic after water, and that  the portions of it which we sparingly administered to them, mixed with a  little brandy, were most eagerly seized. Indeed the greatest firmness and  forbearance were necessary on our part to prevent the unfortunate  sufferers from committing fatal excesses. They declared their extremity  to have been so great that no chance had appeared to them of surviving  the next awful night, or of getting a foot beyond their present position;  and, to his credit be it said, one of them* had been on his knees only  ten minutes before they were rescued, supplicating with uplifted hands  that aid and assistance which had thus, through Divine Providence, been  so opportunely afforded them.    (*Footnote. Ruston.)    SEARCH FOR MR. SMITH.    In answer to our anxious enquiries respecting Mr. Walker and Mr. Smith we  learnt that the former, being much the strongest of the party, had, at  their request, made the best of his way towards Perth ten days since, in  order to send them out assistance, and that Mr. Smith, having been  totally unable to proceed with them any further, had remained behind, in  a dying state, four days ago. Touched by this distressing intelligence,  and sensibly alive to the value of time, we lost not a moment in lifting  our three light weights on our horses, and by supporting them in their  seats conveyed them over the sandhills to the more level space behind,  where sufficient brushwood was scattered about for maintaining a fire.  Here Mr. Spofforth kindly undertook their charge, while I should proceed  with Kinchela and Warrup in search of poor Smith.    Ruston having expressed himself very anxious to accompany us, and fearing  that we might not otherwise accomplish our object, after receiving some  suitable refreshment, he was mounted, and we all set off at as quick a  pace as he could manage. At the end of three miles a good view of the  coast to the northward was opened to us from the summit of a rising  ground, and Ruston pointed out, at the distance of 24 miles, an island  near which he said young Smith had been left. As this was far beyond the  six or seven miles of which they had at first spoken, and totally  precluded the possibility of my returning that night with the water-kegs  which I had taken to be filled at some wells which they had seen in the  vicinity, I relinquished all idea of proceeding, while the sun was then  touching the horizon, and we accordingly rejoined Mr. Spofforth and his  charge. We were now perfectly satisfied of the wandering inconsistency in  the conversation of the three rescued men, who were evidently to a  considerable extent delirious or light-headed. Being too sore in body and  excited in mind to admit much sleep to their assistance, they were full  of their expressions of thankfulness for their timely deliverance, and at  length terminated a long and weary night.    DISCOVERY OF HIS BODY.    The morrow's dawn found me on my way with Kinchela and Warrup to search  for poor Smith, while Mr. Spofforth proceeded with the three rescued men  and Wyip to join our party at Kadjelup, 12 miles off. At the distance of  a mile and a half we found the guns of Mr. Walker and Mr. Smith, which  the men had buried among the sandhills from inability to carry them any  further. A close scrutiny of the beach brought us, at the end of ten  miles, to a spot where Warrup observed the traces of feet in the sand.  Following them up, they ascended a bare sandhill to the height of twelve  or fourteen feet, turned short round to the left, and there terminated at  the unfortunate object of our search, extended on his back, lifeless, in  the midst of a thick bush, where he seemed to have laid himself down to  sleep, half-enveloped in his blanket. The poor fellow's last bed appeared  to have been selected by himself; and at the distance of three or four  yards from him lay all the trifling articles which had constituted his  travelling equipage. These were his wooden canteen, his brown felt hat,  and haversack, containing his journal, shoes, tinder, steel, gun-screw, a  few small canvas bags which he had used for carrying shellfish, and a  small bag with thread, needles, and buttons. Life seemed to have been  extinct rather more than two days; and from the position of the head,  which had fallen considerably below the level of the body, we were led to  conclude that a rush of blood into the brain had caused his death, and at  last without much suffering.    BURIAL OF MR. SMITH.    With the help of the soldier and Warrup we made a grave with our hands  and buried poor Smith deep in a sandhill near the shore, about  seventy-six miles to the north of Swan River. Even Warrup,  notwithstanding the general apathy of the native character, wept like a  child over the untimely fate of this young man, from whom he had formerly  received kindness. Smoothing over his solitary bed, and placing at the  head of his grave a piece of wood found upon the beach, we pursued our  melancholy way half a mile to the northward,"]]]
