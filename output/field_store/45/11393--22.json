Consequently they were free to attack not alone  Spanish vessels and colonies, but also those previously belonging  to Portugal. As early as 1596 Cornelius Houtman rounded the Cape  and visited Sumatra and Bantam, and within fifty, years the Dutch  had replaced the Portuguese in many of their Eastern possessions.  In 1614 they took Malacca, and with it the command of the Spice  Islands; by 1658 they had secured full possession of Ceylon. Much  earlier, in 1619, they had founded Batavia in Java, which they made  the centre of their East Indian possessions, as it still remains.    The English at first attempted to imitate the Dutch in their East  Indian policy. The English East India Company was founded by Elizabeth  in 1600, and as early as 1619 had forced the Dutch to allow them to  take a third share of the profits of the Spice Islands. In order  to do this several English planters settled at Amboyna, but within  four years trade rivalries had reached such a pitch that the Dutch  murdered some of these merchants and drove the rest from the islands.  As a consequence the English Company devoted its attention to the  mainland of India itself, where they soon obtained possession of  Madras and Bombay, and left the islands of the Indian Ocean mainly  in possession of the Dutch. We shall see later the effect of this  upon the history of geography, for it was owing to their possession  of the East India Islands that the Dutch were practically the  discoverers of Australia. One result of the Dutch East India policy  has left its traces even to the present day. In 1651 they established  a colony at the Cape of Good Hope, which only fell into English  hands during the Napoleonic wars, when Napoleon held Holland.    Meanwhile the English had not lost sight of the possibilities of  the North-East Passage, if not for reaching the Spice Islands,  at any rate as a means of tapping the overland route to China,  hitherto monopolised by the Genoese. In 1558 an English gentleman,  named Anthony Jenkinson, was sent as ambassador to the Czar of  Muscovy, and travelled from Moscow as far as Bokhara; but he was  not very fortunate in his venture, and England had to be content  for some time to receive her Indian and Chinese goods from the  Venetian argosies as before. But at last they saw no reason why  they should not attempt direct relations with the East. A company of  Levant merchants was formed in 1583 to open out direct communications  with Aleppo, Bagdad, Ormuz, and Goa. They were unsuccessful at the  two latter places owing to the jealousy of the Portuguese, but  they made arrangements for cheaper transit of Eastern goods to  England, and in 1587 the last of the Venetian argosies, a great  vessel of eleven hundred tons, was wrecked off the Isle of Wight.  Henceforth the English conducted their own business with the East,  and Venetian and Portuguese monopoly was at an end.    [Illustration: RUSSIAN MAP OF ASIA, 1737.]    But the journeys of Chancellor and Jenkinson to the Court of Moscow  had more far-reaching effects; the Russians themselves were thereby  led to contemplate utilising their proximity to one of the best  known routes to the Far East. Shortly after Jenkinson's visit, the  Czar, Ivan the Terrible, began extending his dominions eastward,  sending at first a number of troops to accompany the Russian merchant  Strogonof as far as the Obi in search of sables. Among the troops  were a corps of six thousand Cossacks commanded by one named Vassili  Yermak, who, finding the Tartars an easy prey, determined at first  to set up a new kingdom for himself. In 1579 he was successful in  overcoming the Tartars and their chief town Sibir, near Tobolsk;  but, finding it difficult to retain his position, determined to  return to his allegiance to the Czar on condition of being supported.  This was readily granted, and from that time onward the Russians  steadily pushed on through to the unknown country of the north  of Asia, since named after the little town conquered by Yermak,  of which scarcely any traces now remain. As early as 1639 they  had reached the Pacific under Kupilof. A force was sent out from  Yakutz, on the Lena, in 1643, which reached the Amur, and thus  Russians came for the first time in contact with the Chinese, and  a new method of reaching Cathay was thus obtained, while geography  gained the knowledge of the extent of Northern Asia. For, about  the same time (in 1648), the Arctic Ocean was reached on the north  shores of Siberia, and a fleet under the Cossack Dishinef sailed  from Kolyma and reached as far as the straits known by the name  of Behring. It was not, however, till fifty years afterwards, in  1696, that the Russians reached Kamtschatka.    Notwithstanding the access of knowledge which had been gained by  these successive bold pushes towards north and east, it still remained  uncertain whether Siberia did not join on to the northern part of  the New World discovered by Columbus and Amerigo, and in 1728 Peter  the Great sent out an expedition under VITUS BEHRING, a Dane in the  Russian service, with the express aim of ascertaining this point.  He reached Kamtschatka, and there built two vessels as directed by  the Czar, and started on his voyage northward, coasting along the  land. When he reached a little beyond 67 deg. N., he found no land  to the north or east, and conceived he had reached the end of the  continent. As a matter of fact, he was within thirty miles of the  west coast of America; but of this he does not seem to have been  aware, being content with solving the special problem put before  him by the Czar. The strait thus discovered by Behring, though not  known by him to be a strait, has ever since been known by his name.  In 1741, however, Behring again set out on a voyage of discovery to  ascertain how far to the east America was, and within a fortnight  had come within sight of the lofty mountain named by him Mount  St. Elias. Behring himself died upon this voyage, on an island  also named after him; he had at last solved the relation between  the Old and the New Worlds.    These voyages of Behring, however, belong to a much later stage  of discovery than those we have hitherto been treating for the  last three chapters. His explorations were undertaken mainly for  scientific purposes, and to solve a scientific problem, whereas  all the other researches of Spanish, Portuguese, English, and Dutch  were directed to one end, that of reaching the Spice Islands and  Cathay. The Portuguese at first started out on the search by the  slow method of creeping down the coast of Africa; the Spanish, by  adopting Columbus's bold idea, had attempted it by the western  route, and under Magellan's still bolder conception had equally  succeeded in reaching it in that way; the English and French sought  for a north-west passage to the Moluccas; while the English and  Dutch attempted a northeasterly route. In both directions the icy  barrier of the north prevented success. It was reserved, as we shall  see, for the present century to complete the North-West Passage  under Maclure, and the North-East by Nordenskiold, sailing with  quite different motives to those which first brought the mariners  of England, France, and Holland within the Arctic Circle.    The net result of all these attempts by the nations of Europe to  wrest from the Venetians the monopoly of the Eastern trade was to  add to geography the knowledge of the existence of a New World  intervening between the western shores of Europe and the eastern  shores of Asia. We have yet to learn the means by which the New  World thus discovered became explored and possessed by the European  nations.    [_Authorities:_ Cooley and Beazeley, _John and Sebastian Cabot_,  1898.]          CHAPTER IX    THE PARTITION OF AMERICA    We have hitherto been dealing with the discoveries made by Spanish  and Portuguese along the coast of the New World, but early in the  sixteenth century they began to put foot on _terra firma_ and explore  the interior. As early as 1513 Vasco Nunez de Balboa ascended the  highest peak in the range running from the Isthmus of Panama, and  saw for the first time by European eyes the great ocean afterwards  to be named by Magellan the Pacific. He there heard that the country  to the south extended without end, and was inhabited by great nations,  with an abundance of gold. Among his companions who heard of this  golden country, or El Dorado, was one Francisco Pizarro, who was  destined to test the report. But a similar report had reached the ears  of Diego Velasquez, governor of Cuba, as to a great nation possessed  of much gold to the north of Darien. He accordingly despatched  his lieutenant Hernando Cortes in 1519 to investigate, with ten  ships, six hundred and fifty men, and some eighteen horses. When  he landed at the port named by him Vera Cruz, the appearance of  his men, and more especially of his horses, astonished and alarmed  the natives of Mexico, then a large and semi-civilised state under  the rule of Montezuma, the last representative of the Aztecs, who  in the twelfth century had succeeded the Toltecs, a people that had  settled on the Mexican tableland as early probably as the seventh  century, introducing the use of metals and roads and many of the  elements of civilisation. Montezuma is reported to have been able  to range no less than two hundred thousand men under his banners,  but he showed his opinion of the Spaniards by sending them costly  presents, gold and silver and costly stuffs. This only aroused  the cupidity of Cortes, who determined to make a bold stroke for  the conquest of such a rich prize. He burnt his ships and advanced  into the interior of the country, conquering on his way the tribe  of the Tlascalans, who had been at war with the Mexicans, but,  when conquered, were ready to assist him against them.

Little cups filled with this mix are       made by pinching the edges of the dough together. The tops are       brushed with egg yolk and baked in a brisk oven.       Cottage Cheese Pancakes    1 cup prepared pancake  4 tablespoons top milk or light cream  1 teaspoon salt  4 eggs, well beaten  1 tablespoon sugar  2 cups cottage cheese, put through ricer         Mix batter and stir in cheese last until smooth.

Today you can get imported canned Holland cheese waffles to heat  quickly and serve.       Napkin Dumpling    1 pound cottage cheese  1/8 pound butter, softened  3 eggs, beaten  3/4 cup Farina  1/2 teaspoon salt  Cinnamon and brown sugar         Mix together all ingredients (except the cinnamon and sugar) to       form a ball. Moisten a linen napkin with cold water and tie the       ball of dough in it. Simmer 40 to 50 minutes in salted boiling       water, remove from napkin, sprinkle well with cinnamon and brown       sugar, and serve. This is on the style of Hungarian potato and       other succulent dumplings and may be served with goulash or as a       meal in itself.      BUTTER AND CHEESE          Where fish is scant      And fruit of trees,      Supply that want      With butter and cheese.        Thomas Tusser in      _The Last Remedy_    Butter and cheese are mixed together in equal parts for cheese butter.  Serbia has a cheese called Butter that more or less matches Turkey's  Durak, of which butter is an indispensable ingredient, and French  Cancoillote is based on sour milk simmered with butter.    The English have a cheese called Margarine, made with the butter  substitute. In Westphalia there are no two schools of thought about  whether 'tis better to eat butter with cheese or not, for in  Westphalia sour-milk cheese, butter is mixed in as part of the process  of making. The Arabs press curds and butter together to store in vats,  and the Scots have Crowdie or Cruddy Butter.      BUTTERMILK CHEESE      The value of buttermilk is stressed in an extravagant old Hindu  proverb: \"A man may live without bread, but without buttermilk he  dies.\"    Cheese was made before butter, being the earliest form of dairy  manufacturing, so buttermilk cheese came well after plain milk cheese,  even after whey cheese. It is very tasty, and a natural with potato  salad. The curd is salted after draining and sold in small parchment  packages.    German \"leather\" cheese has buttermilk mixed with the plain. The Danes  make their Appetitost with sour buttermilk. Ricotta Romano, for a  novelty, is made of sheep buttermilk.      COTTAGE CHEESE      In America cottage cheese is also called pot, Dutch and smearcase. It  is the easiest and quickest to make of all cheeses, by simply letting  milk sour, or adding buttermilk to curdle it, then stand a while on  the back of the kitchen stove, since it is homemade as a rule. It is  drained in a bag of cheesecloth and may be eaten the same day, usually  salted.    The Pilgrims brought along the following two tried and true recipes  from olde England, and both are still in use and good repute:      _Cottage Cheese No. 1_    Let milk sour until clotted. Pour boiling water over and it will  immediately curd. Stir well and pour into a colander. Pour a little  cold water on the curd, salt it and break it up attractively for  serving.      _Cottage Cheese No. 2_    A very rich and tasty variety is made of equal parts whole milk and  buttermilk heated together to just under the boiling point. Pour into  a linen bag and let drain until next day. Then remove, salt to taste  and add a bit of butter or cream to make a smooth, creamy consistency,  and pat into balls the size of a Seville orange.      CREAM CHEESE      In England there are three distinct manners of making cream cheese:    1. Fresh milk strained and lightly drained.  2. Scalded cream dried and drained dry, like Devonshire.  3. Rennet curd ripened, with thin, edible rind, or none, packaged  in small blocks or miniature bricks by dairy companies, as  in the U.S. Philadelphia Cream cheese.    American cream cheeses follow the English pattern, being named from  then: region or established brands owned by Breakstone, Borden, Kraft,  Shefford, etc.    Cream cheese such as the first listed above is easier to make than  cottage cheese or any other. Technically, in fact, it is not a cheese  but the dried curd of milk and is often called virginal. Fresh milk is  simply strained through muslin in a perforated box through which the  whey and extra moisture drains away for three or four days, leaving a  residue as firm as fresh butter.    In America, where we mix cream cheese with everything, a popular  assortment of twelve sold in New York bears these ingredients and  names: Chives, Cherry, Garden, Caviar, Lachs, Pimiento, Olive and  Pimiento, Pineapple, Relish, Scallion, Strawberry, and Triple Decker  of Relish, Pimiento and Cream in layers.    In Italy there is Stracchino Cream, in Sweden Chantilly. Finally, to  come to France, la Foncee or Fromage de Pau, a cream also known around  the world as Creme d'Isigny, Double Creme, Fromage a la Creme de Gien,  Pots de Creme St. Gervais, etc. etc.    The French go even farther by eating thick fresh cream with Chevretons  du Beaujolais and Fromage Blanc in the style that adds _a la creme_ to  their already glorified names.    The English came along with Snow Cream Cheese that is more of a  dessert, similar to Italian Cream Cheese.    We'd like to have a cheese ice cream to contrast with too sweet ones.  Attempts at this have been made, both here and in England; Scottish  Caledonian cream came closest. We have frozen cheese with fruit, to be  sure, but no true cheese ice cream as yet, though some cream cheeses  seem especially suitable.        The farmer's daughter hath soft brown hair      (Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese)      And I met with a ballad I can't say where,      That wholly consisted of lines like these,      (Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese.)    In this parody by Calverly, \"The Farmer's Daughter,\" the ingredients  suggest cheese cake, dating back to 1381 In England. From that year  Kettner in his _Book of the Table_ quotes this recipe:         Take cream of almonds or of cow milk and beat them well together;       and make small coffins (that is, cases of pastry), and do it (put       it) therein; and do (put) thereto sugar and good powders. Or take       good fat cheese and eggs and make them of divers colours, green,       red or yellow, and bake them or serve them forth.    This primitive \"receipt\" grew up into Richmond maids of honor that  caused Kettner to wax poetic with:         At Richmond we are permitted to touch with our lips a countless       number of these maids--light and airy as the \"airy, fairy       Lilian.\" What more can the finest poetry achieve in quickening       the things of earth into tokens and foretastes of heaven, with       glimpses of higher life and ethereal worlds.      CHEESECAKES      _Coronation Cheese Cake_      The _Oxford Dictionary_ defines cheese cake as a \"tartlet filled with  sweet curds, etc.\" This shows that the cheese is the main thing, and  the and-so-forth just a matter of taste. We are delighted to record  that the Lord Mayor of London picked traditional cheese tarts, the  maids of honor mentioned earlier in this section, as the Coronation  dessert with which to regale the second Queen Elizabeth at the city  luncheon in Guildhall This is most fitting, since these tarts were  named after the maids of honor at the court of the first Queen  Elizabeth. The original recipe is said to have sold for a thousand  pounds. These Richmond maids of honor had the usual cheese cake  ingredients: butter and eggs and pounds of cheese, but what made the  subtle flavor: nutmeg, brandy, lemon, orange-flower water, or all  four?    More than 2,000 years before this land of Coronation cheese cake, the  Greeks had a word for it--several in fact: Apician Cheese Cake,  Aristoxenean, and Philoxenean among them. Then the Romans took it over  and we read from an epistle of the period:         Thirty times in this one year, Charinus, while you have been       arranging to make your will, have I sent you cheese cakes       dripping with Hyblaean Thyme. (Celestial honey, such as that of       Mount Hymettus we still get from Greece.)    Plato mentioned cheese cake, and a town near Thebes was named for it  before Christ was born, at a time when cheese cakes were widely known  as \"dainty food for mortal man.\"    Today cheese cakes come in a half dozen popular styles, of which the  ones flavored with fresh pineapple are the most popular in New York.  But buyers delight in every sort, including the one hundred percent  American type called cheese pies.    Indeed, there seems to be no dividing line between cheese cakes and  cheese pies. While most of them are sweet, some are made piquant with  pimientos and olives. We offer a favorite of ours made from  popcorn-style pot cheese put through a sieve:       Pineapple Cheese Cake    2-1/2 pounds sieved pot cheese  1-inch piece vanilla bean  1/4 pound sweet butter, melted  1/2 small box graham crackers, crushed fine  4 eggs  2 cups sugar  1 small can crushed pineapple, drained  2 cups milk  1/3 cup flour         In a big bowl mix everything except the graham crackers and       pineapple in the order given above. Butter a square Pyrex pan and       put in the graham-cracker dust to make a crust. Cover this evenly       with the pineapple and pour in the cheese-custard mixture. Bake I       hour in a \"quiet\" oven, as the English used to say for a moderate       one, and when"]]]
