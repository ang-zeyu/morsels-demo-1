In several places the concrete spillway  had crumbled down to a ragged edge, showing that the solid wall was  giving way. The amount of water flowing over the dam was greater now.  The creek was steadily rising. Down the valley the horseman with the  red flag was but a speck in the distance.    \"What can I do? What can I do?\" murmured Tom. \"If all the powder there  is left has been doped, I can't save the town! What can I do? What can  I do?\"    Ned had reached the foreman, who, with his helpers, was standing about  the big gun.    \"Have any of your men left recently?\" yelled Ned.    \"Any of my men left? What do you mean?    \"Schlichter went yesterday,\" said the timekeeper. \"I thought he was in  quite a hurry to get his money, too.\"    \"Schlichter gone!\" exclaimed the foreman. \"He was no good anyhow. I  think he was a sort of Anarchist; always against the government, the  way he talked. So he has left; eh? But what's the matter, Ned?\"    \"Something wrong with the powder. Tom can't shoot the cannon and turn  aside the water to save the town. Some of his enemies have been at  work. Schlichter leaving at this time, and in such hurry, makes it look  suspicious.\"    \"It sure does! And, now I recall it, I saw him yesterday near your  powder magazine. I called him down for it, for I knew Tom Swift had  given orders that only his own party was to go near it.  So the powder  is doped; eh?\"    \"Yes! It's all off now.\"    He turned to see Tom approaching on the run.    \"Any good powder left?\" asked Ned.    \"Not a pound. Did you hear anything?\"    \"Yes, one man has disappeared. Oh, Tom, we've got to fail after all! We  can't save the town!\"    \"Yes, we can, Ned. If that dam will only hold for half an hour more.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"I mean that I have another supply of good powder in the village. I  secreted some there, you remember I told you. If I can go get that, and  get back here in time, I can break down the barrier with one shot, and  save Preston.\"    \"But you never can make the trip there and back in time, with the  powder, Tom. It's impossible. The dam may hold half an hour, or it may  not. But, if it does, you can't do anything!\"    \"I can't? Well, I'm going to make a big try, Ned. You stay on the job  here. Have everything ready so that when I get back with the new  explosive, which I hope hasn't been tampered with, I can shove it into  the breech, and set it off. Have the wires, primers and button all  ready for me.\"    Then Tom set off on the run.    \"Where are you going?\" gasped his chum. \"You can never run to Preston  and back in time.\"    \"I don't intend to. I'm going in my airship. Koku, never mind bringing  the rest of the powder from the cave. It's no good. Run out the Humming  Bird. I'm going to drive her to the limit. I've just got to get that  powder here on time!\"    \"Bless my timetable!\" gasped Mr. Damon. \"That's the only way it can be  done. Lucky Tom brought the airship along!\"    The young inventor, pausing only to get some cans for the explosive,  and some straps with which to fasten them in the monoplane, leaped into  the speedy craft.    The motor was adjusted; Koku whirled the propeller blades.  There was a  staccato succession of explosions, a rushing, roaring sound, and then  the craft rose like a bird, and Tom circled about, making a straight  course for the distant town, while below him the creek rose higher and  higher as the dam continued to crumble away.          CHAPTER XIX    BLOWING DOWN THE BARRIER      \"Can you see anything of him, Ned?\"    \"Not a thing, Mr. Damon. Wait--hold on--no! It's only a bird,\" and the  lad lowered the glasses with which he had been sweeping the sky.  looking for his chum returning in his airship with the powder.    \"He'd better hurry,\" murmured the foreman. \"That dam can't last much  longer. The water is rising fast. When it does go out it will go with a  rush. Then good-bye to the village of Preston.\"    \"Bless my insurance policy!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Don't say such things,  my friend.\"    \"But they're true!\" insisted the man. \"You can see for yourself that  the cracks in the dam are getting larger. It will be a big flood when  it does come. And I'm not altogether sure that we're safe up here,\" he  added, as he looked down the sides of the hill to where the creek was  now rapidly becoming a raging torrent.    \"Bless my hat-band!\" gasped Mr. Damon. \"You--you are getting on my  nerves!\"    \"I don't want to be a calamity howler,\" went on the foreman; \"but we've  got to face this thing. We'd better get ready to vamoose if Tom Swift  doesn't reach here in time to fire that shot--and he doesn't seem to be  in sight.\"    Once more Ned swept the sky with his glasses. The roar of the water  below them could be plainly heard now.    \"I wish I could get hold of that rascally German,\" muttered the  foreman. \"I'd give him more than a piece of my mind. It will be his  fault if the town is destroyed, for Tom's plan would have saved it. I  wonder who he can be, anyhow?\"    \"Some spy,\" declared Ned. \"We've been having trouble right along, you  know, and this is part of the game. I have some suspicions, but Tom  doesn't agree with me. Certainly the fellow, whatever his object, has  made trouble enough this time.\"    \"I should say so,\" agreed the foreman.    \"Look, Ned!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Is that a bird; or is it Tom?\" and he  pointed to a speck in the sky. Ned quickly focused his glasses on it.    \"It's Tom!\" he cried a second later. \"It's Tom in the Humming Bird!\"    \"Thank Heaven for that!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, fervently, forgetting to  bless anything on this occasion. \"If only he can get here in time!\"    \"He's driving her to the limit!\" cried Ned, still watching his chum  through the glass. \"He's coming!\"    \"He'll need to,\" murmured the foreman, grimly. \"That dam can't last ten  minutes more. Look at the people fleeing from the valley!\"    He pointed to the north, and a confused mass of small black  objects--men, women and children, doubtless, who had lingered in spite  of the other warning--could be seen clambering up the sides of the  valley.    \"Is everything ready at the gun?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"Everything,\" answered Ned, whom Tom had instructed in all the  essentials. \"As soon as he lands we'll jam in the powder, and fire the  shot.\"    \"I hope he doesn't land too hard, with all that explosive on board,\"  murmured the foreman.    \"Bless my checkerboard!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Don't suggest such a thing.\"    \"I guess we can trust Tom,\" spoke Ned.    They looked up. The distant throb of the monoplane's motor could now be  heard above the roar of the swollen waters. Tom could be seen in his  seat, and beside him, in the other, was a large package.    Nearer and nearer came the monoplane. It began to descend, very gently,  for well Tom Swift knew the danger of hitting the ground too hard with  the cargo he carried.    He described a circle in the air to check his speed. Then, gently as a  bird, he made a landing not far from the gun, the craft running easily  over one of the few level places on the side of the hill. Tom yanked on  the brake, and the iron-shod pieces of wood dug into the ground,  checking the progress of the monoplane on its bicycle wheels.    \"Have you got it, Tom?\" yelled Ned.    \"I have,\" was the answer of the young inventor as he leaped from his  seat.    \"Is it good powder?\" asked the foreman, anxiously.    \"I don't know,\" spoke Tom. \"I didn't have time to look. I just rushed  up to where I had stored it, got some out and came back with the motor  at full speed. Ran into an airpocket, too, and I thought it was all up  with me when I began to fall. But I managed to get out of it. Say,  we're going to have it nip and tuck here to save the village.\"    \"That's what!\" agreed the foreman, as he helped Koku take the cans of  explosive.    \"Wait until I look at it,\" suggested Tom, as he opened one. His trained  eye and touch soon told him that this explosive had not been tampered  with.    \"It's all right!\" he shouted. \"Into the gun with it, and we'll see what  happens.\"    It was the work of only a few moments to put in the charge.  Then, once  more, the breech-block was slotted home, and the trailing electric  wires unreeled to lead to the bomb-proof.    Tom Swift took one last look through the telescope sights of his giant  cannon. He changed the range slightly by means of the hand and  worm-screw gear, and then, with the others, ran to the shelter of the  cave. For, though the gun had stood the previous tests well, Tom had  used a heavier charge this time, both in the firing chamber and in the  projectile, and he wanted to take no chances.    \"All ready?\" asked the young inventor, as he looked around at his  friends gathered in the cave.    \"I--I guess so,\" answered Ned, somewhat doubtfully.    Tom hesitated a moment, then, as his fingers stiffened to press the  electric button there sounded to the ears of all a dull, booming sound.    \"The dam! It has given way!\" cried Ned.    \"That's it!\" shouted the foreman. \"Fire!\"    Tom pressed the button. Once again was that awful tremor of the  earth--the racking shake--the terrific explosion and a shock that  knocked a couple of the men down.    \"All right!\" shouted Tom. \"The gun held together. It's safe to go out.  We'll see what happened!\"    They all rushed from the shelter of the cave. Before them was an  awe-inspiring sight. A great wall of water was coming down the valley,  from a large opening in the centre of the dam. It seemed to leap  forward like a race horse.    Tom declared afterward that he saw his projectile strike the barrier  that separated one valley from the other, but none of the others had  eyesight as keen as this--and perhaps Tom was in error.    But there was no doubt that they all saw what followed. They heard a  distant report as the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13610"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 1 (#18)"],[1," suggests that here is an origin of modesty. \"The      sexual organs must be veiled at an early period, to prevent the      dangerous effluvia which they give off from reaching the      environment. The veil is often a method of intercepting magic      action. Once constituted, the practice would be maintained and      transformed.\"        It was doubtless as a secondary and derived significance that the      veil became, as Reinach (\"Le Voile de l'Oblation,\" op. cit., pp.      299-311) shows it was, alike among the Romans and in the Catholic      Church, the sign of consecration to the gods.    At an early stage of culture, again, menstruation is regarded as a process  of purification, a dangerous expulsion of vitiated humors. Hence the term  _katharsis_ applied to it by the Greeks. Hence also the mediaeval view of  women: \"_Mulier speciosa templum aedificatum super cloacam_,\" said  Boethius. The sacro-pubic region in women, because it includes the source  of menstruation, thus becomes a specially heightened seat of taboo.  According to the Mosiac law (Leviticus, Chapter XX, v. 18), if a man  uncovered a menstruating woman, both were to be cut off.    It is probable that the Mohammedan custom of veiling the face and head  really has its source solely in another aspect of this ritual factor of  modesty. It must be remembered that this custom is not Mohammedan in its  origin, since it existed long previously among the Arabians, and is  described by Tertullian.[43] In early Arabia very handsome men also veiled  their faces, in order to preserve themselves from the evil eye, and it has  been conjectured with much probability that the origin of the custom of  women veiling their faces may be traced to this magico-religious  precaution.[44] Among the Jews of the same period, according to  Buechler,[45] the women had their heads covered and never cut their hair;  to appear in the streets without such covering would be like a prostitute  and was adequate ground for divorce; adulterous women were punished by  uncovering their heads and cutting their hair. It is possible, though not  certain, that St. Paul's obscure injunction to women to cover their heads  \"because of the angels,\" may really be based on the ancient reason, that  when uncovered they would be exposed to the wanton assaults of spirits (1  Corinthians, Ch. XI, vv. 5-6),[46] exactly as Singhalese women believe  that they must keep the vulva covered lest demons should have intercourse  with them. Even at the present day St. Paul's injunction is still observed  by Christendom, which is, however, far from accepting, or even perhaps  understanding, the folk-lore ground on which are based such injunctions.        Crawley thus summarizes some of the evidence concerning the      significance of the veil:--        \"Sexual shyness, not only in woman, but in man, is intensified at      marriage, and forms a chief feature of the dangerous sexual      properties mutually feared. When fully ceremonial, the idea takes      on the meaning that satisfaction of these feelings will lead to      their neutralization, as, in fact, it does. The bridegroom in      ancient Sparta supped on the wedding night at the men's mess, and      then visited his bride, leaving her before daybreak. This      practice was continued, and sometimes children were born before      the pair had ever seen each other's faces by day. At weddings in      the Babar Islands, the bridegroom has to hunt for his bride in a      darkened room. This lasts a good while if she is shy. In South      Africa, the bridegroom may not see his bride till the whole of      the marriage ceremonies have been performed. In Persia, a husband      never sees his wife till he has consummated the marriage. At      marriages in South Arabia, the bride and bridegroom have to sit      immovable in the same position from noon till midnight, fasting,      in separate rooms. The bride is attended by ladies, and the groom      by men. They may not see each other till the night of the fourth      day. In Egypt, the groom cannot see the face of his bride, even      by a surreptitious glance, till she is in his absolute      possession. Then comes the ceremony, which he performs, of      uncovering her face. In Egypt, of course, this has been      accentuated by the seclusion and veiling of women. In Morocco, at      the feast before the marriage, the bride and groom sit together      on a sort of throne; all the time, the poor bride's eyes are      firmly closed, and she sits amidst the revelry as immovable as a      statue. On the next day is the marriage. She is conducted after      dark to her future home, accompanied by a crowd with lanterns and      candles. She is led with closed eyes along the street by two      relatives, each holding one of her hands. The bride's head is      held in its proper position by a female relative, who walks      behind her. She wears a veil, and is not allowed to open her eyes      until she is set on the bridal bed, with a girl friend beside      her. Amongst the Zulus, the bridal party proceeds to the house of      the groom, having the bride hidden amongst them. They stand      facing the groom, while the bride sings a song. Her companions      then suddenly break away, and she is discovered standing in the      middle, with a fringe of beads covering her face. Amongst the      people of Kumaun, the husband sees his wife first after the      joining of hands. Amongst the Bedui of North East Africa, the      bride is brought on the evening of the wedding-day by her girl      friends, to the groom's house. She is closely muffled up. Amongst      the Jews of Jerusalem, the bride, at the marriage ceremony,      stands under the nuptial canopy, her eyes being closed, that she      may not behold the face of her future husband before she reaches      the bridal chamber. In Melanesia, the bride is carried to her new      home on some one's back, wrapped in many mats, with palm-fans      held about her face, because she is supposed to be modest and      shy. Among the Damaras, the groom cannot see his bride for four      days after marriage. When a Damara woman is asked in marriage,      she covers her face for a time with the flap of a headdress made      for this purpose. At the Thlinkeet marriage ceremony, the bride      must look down, and keep her head bowed all the time; during the      wedding-day, she remains hiding in a corner of the house, and the      groom is forbidden to enter. At a Yezedee marriage, the bride is      covered from head to foot with a thick veil, and when arrived at      her new home, she retires behind a curtain in the corner of a      darkened room, where she remains for three days before her      husband is permitted to see her. In Corea, the bride has to cover      her face with her long sleeves, when meeting the bridegroom at      the wedding. The Manchurian bride uncovers her face for the first      time when she descends from the nuptial couch. It is dangerous      even to see dangerous persons. Sight is a method of contagion in      primitive science, and the idea coincides with the psychological      aversion to see dangerous things, and with sexual shyness and      timidity. In the customs noticed, we can distinguish the feeling      that it is dangerous to the bride for her husband's eyes to be      upon her, and the feeling of bashfulness in her which induces her      neither to see him nor to be seen by him. These ideas explain the      origin of the bridal veil and similar concealments. The bridal      veil is used, to take a few instances, in China, Burmah, Corea,      Russia, Bulgaria, Manchuria, and Persia, and in all these cases      it conceals the face entirely.\" (E. Crawley, _The Mystic Rose_,      pp. 328 et seq.)        Alexander Walker, writing in 1846, remarks: \"Among old-fashioned      people, of whom a good example may be found in old country people      of the middle class in England, it is indecent to be seen with      the head unclothed; such a woman is terrified at the chance of      being seen In that condition, and if intruded on at that time,      she shrieks with terror, and flies to conceal herself.\" (A.      Walker, _Beauty_, p. 15.) This fear of being seen with the head      uncovered exists still, M. Van Gennep informs me, in some regions      of France, as in Brittany.    So far it has only been necessary to refer incidentally to the connection  of modesty with clothing. I have sought to emphasize the unquestionable,  but often forgotten, fact that modesty is in its origin independent of  clothing, that physiological modesty takes precedence of anatomical  modesty, and that the primary factors of modesty were certainly developed  long before the discovery of either ornament or garments. The rise of  clothing probably had its first psychical basis on an emotion of modesty  already compositely formed of the elements we have traced. Both the main  elementary factors, it must be noted, must naturally tend to develop and  unite in a more complex, though--it may well be--much less intense,  emotion. The impulse which leads the female animal, as it leads some  African women when found without their girdles, to squat firmly down on  the earth, becomes a more refined and extended play of gesture and  ornament and garment. A very notable advance, I may remark, is made when  this primary attitude of defence against the action of the male becomes a  defence against his eyes. We may thus explain the spread of modesty to  various parts of the body, even when we exclude the more special influence  of the evil eye. The breasts very early become a focus of modesty in  women; this may be observed among many naked, or nearly naked, negro  races; the tendency of the nates to become the chief seat of modesty in  many parts of Africa may probably be, in large part, thus explained, since  the full development of the gluteal regions is often the greatest  "]]]
