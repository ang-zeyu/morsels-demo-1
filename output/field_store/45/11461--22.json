Don't ask me anything until then,  dear.\"    Silence fell between them as the hotel woke to another sunlit day.    \"Something will happen to decide me,\" mused the old lady as, a little  later, she took her mail from Hobson, who moved majestically about the  room with bath-salts and towels.  \"From Ben,\" she continued, flicking a  lightning glance at the face which, went suddenly rosy pink as it  rested against her knee.  \"Written from the Oasis of Kurkur near the  First Cataract.  He hasn't seen lion yet, but has heard a lot about the  one which is causing a panic amongst the dragomen in Luxor.  Oh! how  nice for him!  Do you remember fat Sybil Sidmouth, the crack shot?\"    It seemed that jolly Sybil Sidmouth, well known at Bisley and who had  brought a thin stepmother devastated with nerves to winter in Luxor,  had also fallen a victim to lion gossip, and had wired a bet to Ben  Kelham that she would bring in the lion's skin.    \"They are meeting at Assouan to discuss plans . . .\"    \"Yes?\" said Damaris indifferently, and added vindictively, \"Knocking  about in the desert might reduce her a bit,\" and gave no thought to the  moment of that very morning when, under some uncontrollable impulse,  she had turned the stallion Sooltan and taken him back at full gallop  and to within a few yards of the Arab who, in European riding-kit and  boots from Peter Yapp, had raised his right hand as she had thundered  past standing in her stirrups.    A woman could keep a poultry-farm till the last trump, and even then  never awake to the fact that the same brand of corn is appreciated both  by the goose and the gander!    And, sure enough, something happened to decide her grace before the  setting of the sun.          CHAPTER XIV      \"_Oh! for a falconer's voice to lure    This tassel gentle back again_.\"              SHAKESPEARE.      Lunch, desultory shopping and tea with friends in Cairo had been the  order of the afternoon following the dawn which had found her grace at  the window trying to come to a decision about her god-daughter.  They  were just returning from these festivities and were negotiating the  last cross-roads of the Sharia Abbas when a native policeman, waving  his arm like a semaphore, stepped into the slowly-moving stream of  traffic.    Resulted the usual maelstrom of motors, native vehicles, stray animals  and trams, in which tossed the native pedestrian as, agile and  vociferous, he slipped in and out of the block, calling loudly upon  Allah in his extremity.    \"A native wedding, or something,\" said Damaris, who was driving.  \"What  fun!\" then blushed divinely pink.    There was one gorgeous mounted figure in the laughing, happy,  tumultuous crowd which came whirling across the road kept clear for it  by the police.    Hugh Carden Ali had gone a-hawking in a certain part of the desert near  the ancient City of On, where gazelle is sometimes seen and birds are  plentiful.    Clad in orange satin a-shine with jewels, with tight-fitting Eastern  trousers ending in perfect riding-boots, with diamond osprey glittering  in the white turban and falcon, with jesse to match the orange coat, on  gauntleted wrist, he rode serenely in the cheering throng.    His falconers with their underlings walked on either side of the roan,  which fretted and fidgeted at the slowness of the pace; the dogs of  Billi walked sedately and by themselves; grooms of the kennels led  greyhounds on the leash; behind them, almost bursting with importance,  came a Persian deftly carrying the cadge, which is a kind of padded  stand upon which, hooded and fastened by leashes, the favourite birds  are carried to and fro.    At the rear was the birds' van, in which are carted the birds which may  or may not be required, also spare parts of the paraphernalia upon  which depends the success of this sport, the sport, in truth, of kings!  In the \"days that are past\" the favourite sport of our own monarchs,  especially in the \"spacious days of great Elizabeth.\"    The bag was good considering the district, the poles on the servants'  shoulders bending under the weight of two gazelle and countless birds  of all sizes and plumage.    A couple of _siyas_ waving the customary horsehair fly-whisk ran  shouting before their master; servants surrounded the cortege, armed  with sticks which they rattled with good effect upon the shins of the  more venturesome among the spectators as the procession moved slowly,  as move all things in the East.    Shouting fiercely, the _siyas_ stopped suddenly in front of her grace's  car, arms uplifted, mouths open, then turned in their tracks and sped  back to the master who had called them.    The old lady and the girl beside her interchanged never a word as they  watched Hugh Carden Ali urge the mare who picked a dainty path through  the wondering crowds which opened a way before her.  The sun caught the  jewels on the man's breast and above his turban and upon the  saddle-cloth of the roan mare, and struck fiercely slantwise into the  proud, handsome face with the set mouth and the eyes which never once  looked in the Englishwomen's direction.    For a full minute he sat immovable, whilst the mare, freed from the  fret of the crowd, stood stock-still.  In his bearing, in the  magnificent picture he made under the flaming skies, there seemed a  subtle challenge to the two Englishwomen.  All his English nature rose  in revolt against the barriers that rose between himself and Damaris,  daughter of his mother's race; but, curbing his passion with the  self-control he had learned in British fields of sport, he remembered  that he belonged primarily to his father's land, whose people had three  thousand years before held the keys of civilisation in their powerful  hands, whilst the people of his mother's land were just about emerging  from the primitiveness of the Stone Age.    \"_I am the East_!\" he seemed to cry in his utter immobility.    Then he turned, beckoned, and gave a sharp order to the bewildered  policeman, who salaamed almost to the ground.    Hugh Carden Ali bowed, to the saddle, as the great car shot smoothly  forward.  There was a smile of welcome on the face of the old woman who  had loved his mother; a whole world of welcome in the outstretched hand  and a little feeling of thankfulness in her heart; that at last she  might get to know the man in time, and, with him, go to visit his  mother, or, better still, win his confidence, heal his hurt, and so  obviate the tedious journey.    But there was to be no drawing together of the man's wound with the  silken threads of sympathy.    He sat like a statue, with his left hand raised in salute,[1] until the  Englishwomen had passed; then, throwing his falcon, he watched the  confused bird's flight in search of the quarry which was not there.      \"_Cry aloud to Ali the worker of wonders,    From Him thou wilt find help from trouble_.\"    He quoted the first two lines from the _Ned'i Ali_, the formula used in  the East when trouble threatens a falcon, and, touching the mare,  passed down the Sharia Abbas, whilst the old lady, going in the  opposite direction, came to a sudden decision.      [1]In the East the falcon is carried on the right hand.          CHAPTER XV.      \"_When he is best he is little worse than a man;    and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast_.\"              SHAKESPEARE.      Even as the frail little old lady sat quietly looking out at the coming  of the dawn, Qatim the Ethiopian sat looking with pride round his  transformed hovel in the back reaches of the bazaar.  Having gathered  Zulannah from the gutter where she had been thrown after the dogs had  pulled her down, he carried her to his hovel and, believing her to be  dead, flung her body on the heap of filthy straw which served him as  couch, and then stole back--in fact, six times he made the journey--to  the courtesan's great house.  He did not argue with himself, he had no  theories and most certainly no moral standards: the woman was dead;  there were certain things, beautiful, gaudy, glittering things in her  house which his heart had always coveted, which had made his fingers to  itch and his mouth to water; brute instinct told him to seize the bones  before the other dogs fell upon them; and he obeyed the brutish impulse.    Hundreds of soft silken gowns; cushions of every hue; the great crimson  cover from off the divan--all of these he made into a huge bundle which  he carried to his den.  The gold and jewelled toilet accessories, the  silver basin and ewer, just because they glittered, he tied in a pair  of emerald green satin curtains; various strange knives and things with  prongs, with which on certain occasions the courtesan had conveyed food  to her mouth--she used her fingers in private--with a jewel-encrusted  _nargileh_ of marvellous workmanship, he rolled up in a bright yellow  and green Kidderminster carpet.    On his fifth journey he carried a small Milner safe upon his back,  letting it drop gently upon the hovel floor without the slightest  acceleration in his breathing.  For five minutes he played with the  knob, like a huge monkey, then grinned, rubbed his chest and bull-neck  with straw, and padded off again down the circuitous streets at a  gentle trot.    He looked at the sky and at the closed doors and windows of the packed  houses, and grinned again.  He could not tell the hour by a clock, but  he knew to a second when the first of the seething mass of humans  asleep on the beds and floors and stairs of the packed houses would  yawn, rub the sleep from their eyes and stumble, shivering, into the  street.  He had still his greatest treasure to bring, and had no wish  to be caught with it on his back; not because of the criminality of his  proceedings--that never once entered his thick skull--but because he  was scared of having the mirror reft from him.  He was almost devoid of  brain, but had a certain animal instinct which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15729"],[0,"History of the Jews in Russia and Poland, Volume 2 [of 3] (#18)"],[1,"in  those very taverns which are leased to them by the noble pans.  Lukasinski contends that the Jews will become good citizens once they  will be allowed to participate in the civil life of Poland, when that  life will be founded on democratic principles.    [Footnote 1: In the government of St. Petersburg.]    [Footnote 2: i.e., Sigismund I. (1506-1548). See on his attitude towards  the Jews Vol. I, p. 71 et seq.]    The choir of Polish voices was but faintly disturbed by the opinions  expressed by the Jews. An otherwise unknown rabbi, who calls himself  Moses ben Abraham, echoes in his pamphlet \"The Voice of the People of  Israel\" the sentiments of Jewish orthodoxy. He begs the Poles not to  meddle in the inner affairs of Judaism: \"You refuse to recognize us as  brothers; then at least respect us as fathers! Look at your genealogical  tree with the branches of the New Testament, a d you will find the roots  in us.\" Polish culture cannot be foisted upon the Jews. Barbarous as may  appear the plan of expelling the Jews from Poland, the persecuted tribe  will rather submit to this alternative than renounce its faith and its  ancestral customs.    The views of the progressive Jews of Poland were voiced by a young  pedagogue in Warsaw, subsequently the well-known champion of  assimilation, Jacob Tugenhold. In a treatise entitled \"Jerubbaal, or a  Word Concerning the Jews,\" Tugenhold contends that the Jews have already  begun to assimilate themselves to Polish culture. It was now within the  power of the Government to strengthen this movement by admitting  \"distinguished Jews to civil service.\"    While this literary feud concerning the problem of Judaism was raging,  an unhealthy movement against the Jews started among the dregs of the  Polish population. In several localities of the Kingdom there suddenly  appeared \"victims of ritual murder\" in the shape of dead bodies of  children, the discovery of which was followed by a series of legal  trials against the Jews (1815-1816). Innocent people were thrown into  prison, where they languished for years, and were subjected to  cross-examinations, though without the inquisitorial apparatus of  ancient Poland. It is impossible to say whither this orgy of  superstition might have led, had it not been stopped by a word of  command from St. Petersburg. In 1817, as a result of the energetic  representations of \"the Deputies of the Jewish People,\" [1] Sonnenberg  and his fellow-workers, the Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs,  Golitzin, gave orders that the ukase which had just been issued by him,  forbidding the arbitrary injection of a ritual element into criminal  cases, be strictly enforced in the Kingdom of Poland. This action saved  the lives of scores of prisoners, and put a stop to the obscure  agitation which endeavored to revive the medieval spectre.    [Footnote 1: Compare Vol. I, p. 394, and above, p. 74.]    The Polish Diet of 1818 reflected the same state of mind which had  previously found expression in political literature: an unmistakable  preponderance of the anti-Jewish element. Some of the deputies appealed  to Alexander I. in their speeches and openly called upon him to give  orders to lay before the next session of the Diet \"a project of Jewish  reform, with a view to saving Poland from the excessive growth of the  Hebrew tribe, which now forms a seventh of all the inhabitants, and in a  few years will surpass in numbers the Christian population of the  country.\" For the immediate future the deputies recommend the  enforcement of the suspended law barring the Jews from the liquor  traffic [1] and their subjection to military conscription.    [Footnote 1: Compare Vol. I, p. 304, and above, p. 94.]    One might have thought that the Diet had no need of extra measures to  \"curb\" the Jews. It was quite enough that it tacitly sanctioned the  prolongation of the ten years term of Jewish rightlessness which had  been fixed by the Government of the Varsovian duchy in 1808. [1] This  term ended in 1818, while the first Diet of the Kingdom of Poland was  holding its sessions, but neither the Polish Diet nor the Polish Council  of State gave any serious thought to the question whether the Government  of the province had a right to prolong the disfranchisement of the Jews.  This right was taken for granted by the Polish legislators who were  planning even harsher restrictions for the unloved tribe of Hebrews.    [Footnote 1: Compare Vol. I, p. 299.]      3. ASSIMILATIONIST TENDENCIES AMONG THE JEWS OF  POLAND    In the beginning of the third decade of the nineteenth century the noise  caused by the Jewish question had begun to subside both in Polish  political circles and in Polish literature. Instead, the agitation  within the Jewish ranks became more vigorous. That group of Jews already  assimilated or thirsting for assimilation, which on an earlier occasion,  during the existence of the Varsovian duchy, had segregated itself from  the rest of Jewry, assuming the label of \"Old Testament believers,\" [1]  occupied a very influential position within the Jewish community of the  Polish capital. It was made up of wealthy bankers and merchants and  boasted of a few men with a European education. The members of this  group were hankering after German models and were anxious to renounce  the national separatism of the Jews which was a standing rebuke in the  mouths of their enemies. To these \"Old Testament believers\" the  abolition of the Kahal and the limitation of communal self-government to  the narrow range of synagogue interests appeared the surest remedy  against anti-Semitism. Behind the abrogation of communal autonomy they  saw the smiling vision of a Jewish school-reform, leading to the  Polonization of Jewish education, while in the far-off distance they  could discern the promised land of equal citizenship.    [Footnote 1: See above, p. 96, n. 1.]    The efforts of the Jewish reformers of Warsaw were now systematically  directed towards this goal. In 1820 there appeared an anonymous pamphlet  under the title \"The Petition, or Self-defence, of the Members of the  Old Testament Persuasion in the Kingdom of Poland.\" The main purpose of  this publication is to show that the root of the evil lies in the Kahal  organization, in the elders, rabbis, and burial societies, who expend  enormous sums of taxation money without any control--i.e., without the  control of the Polish municipality--who oppress the people by their  _herems_ (excommunications), and altogether abuse their power. It is,  therefore, necessary to abolish this power of the Kahals and transfer it  to the Polish municipalities, or even, police authorities; only then  will order be established in the Jewish communities, and the Jews will  be transformed into \"useful citizens.\"    The Government spheres of Poland were greatly pleased by these  utterances of the \"Old Testament believers\" of Warsaw. They had long  contemplated the curtailment of the autonomy of the Kahals, and now \"the  very Jews\" clamored for it. In consequence, there appeared in 1821 a  series of edicts by the viceroy and various rescripts by the Commission  of Public Instruction and Religious Denominations, resulting in the  demolition of the ancient communal scheme, in which certain forms of  self-government, but by no means its underlying fundamental principles,  had become obsolete.    These measures were sanctioned by an imperial ukase dated December 20,  1821, [1] decreeing the abolition of the Kahals and their substitution by  \"Congregational Boards,\" whose scope of activity was strictly limited to  religious matters, while all civil and fiscal affairs were placed under  the jurisdiction of the local Polish administration. The Congregational  Boards were to consist of the rabbi, his assistant or substitute, and  three trustees or supervisors.    [Footnote 1: Corresponding to January 1, 1822, of the West-European  calendar.]    At first, the majority of Jewish communities in Poland were indignant at  this curtailment of their autonomy, and adopted a hostile attitude  towards the new communal organization. The \"supervisors\" elected on the  Congregational Boards often refused to serve, and the authorities were  compelled to appoint them. But in the course of time the communities  became reconciled to the new scheme of congregations, or _Gminas,_[1]  whose range of activity was gradually widened. In 1830 the suffrage of  the Polish Jews within the Jewish communities was restricted by a new  law to persons possessed of a certain amount of property. The result was  particularly noticeable in Warsaw where the new state of things helped  to strengthen the influence of the group of the \"Old Testament  believers\" and enabled them to gain control of the affairs of the  metropolitan community. The leaders of Warsaw Jewry managed soon to  establish intimate relations with the Polish Government, and co-operated  with it in bringing about the \"cultural reforms\" of the Jews of Poland.    [Footnote 1: _Gmina_ is the Polish word for community, derived from the  German _Gemeinde_.]    In 1825 the Polish Government appointed a special body to deal with  Jewish affairs. It was called \"Committee of Old Testament Believers,\"  though composed in the main of Polish officials. It was supplemented by  an advisory council consisting of five public-spirited Jews and their  alternates. Among the members of the Committee, which included several  prominent Jewish merchants of Warsaw, such as Jacob Bergson, M. Kavski,  Solomon Posner, T. Teplitz, was also the well-known mathematician  Abraham Stern, one of the few cultured Jews of that period who remained  a steadfast upholder of Jewish tradition. The \"Committee of Old  Testament Believers\" embarked upon the huge task of civilizing the Jews  of Poland and purging the Jewish religion of its superstitious  excrescences.    The first step taken by the Committee was the establishment of a  Rabbinical"]]]
