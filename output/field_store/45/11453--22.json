It is a  good thing to study out the melodic line, to build each phrase, to work  with it till you get it to suit you. Then come the larger proportions,  the big climaxes, which have to be thought out and prepared for in  advance. A composition should be so thoroughly your own that you can  play it at any time, if your hand is in condition. Or, if it has been  laid aside for a long time, a couple of days should bring it back.    \"The subject of forming a repertoire is one often overlooked or not  understood. The repertoire should be comprehensive and built on broad  lines. A pupil intending to make music a profession should know the  literature of the piano, not only the small and unimportant works of the  great composers (as is too often the case), but the big works as well.  If one is well grounded in the classics at an early age, it is of great  benefit afterwards.      POWER AND VELOCITY    \"For gaining power, heavy chords are very beneficial; combinations of  five notes that take in all the fingers are most useful.    \"The principle of velocity is the doing away with all unnecessary  movement--raising the fingers as little as possible, and so on. But in  early stages of study, and at all times for slow practise, exactness and  clearness, the fingers must be raised, Leschetizky _is a great believer  in finger action; he holds it to be absolutely necessary for finger  development_.    \"I have been concertizing for the last three years, and studying alone.  This does not mean I have learned all the masters can teach, but only  that I have come to a place where I felt I had to go alone, that I must  work out what is in me. No master can teach us that; we have to find  ourselves alone.    \"I shall probably play considerably with orchestra next season. There is  a Concerto by Rimsky-Korsakow which is quite short, only one movement.  It Is charming and brilliant, and I think has not yet been played in  America. There is also a new work by Stavenhagen for piano and  orchestra, which is a novelty on the other side. I greatly enjoy playing  with orchestra, but of course I shall play various recitals as well.\"    Miss Spencer has appeared with the best orchestras in England and on the  continent, and has everywhere received commendation for her pure,  singing tone, plastic touch, and musical temperament. She is certain to  have success in America, and to win hosts of friends there.          XX    ARTHUR HOCHMAN    HOW THE PIANIST CAN COLOR TONE WITH ACTION AND EMOTION      \"A pianist, like a painter, should have an infinitude of colors on his  palette,\" remarked Arthur Hochman, the young Russian pianist, in a  recent chat about piano playing. He should paint pictures at the  keyboard, just as the artist depicts them upon the canvas. The piano is  capable of a wonderful variety of tonal shading, and its keys will  respond most ideally to the true musician who understands how to awaken  and bring forth all this tonal beauty from the instrument.    \"The modern pianist is often lacking in two important  essentials--phrasing and shading. Inability to grasp the importance of  these two points may be the cause of artistic failure. An artist should  so thoroughly make his own the composition which he plays, and be so  deeply imbued with its spirit, that he will know the phrasing and  dynamics which best express the meaning of the piece. When he has risen  to such heights, he is a law to himself in the matter of phrasing, no  matter what marks may stand upon the printed page. As a rule the editing  of piano music is extremely inadequate, though how can it really be  otherwise? How is it possible, with a series of dots, lines, dashes and  accents, to give a true idea of the interpretation of a work of musical  art? It is _not_ possible; there are infinite shadings between _piano_  and _forte_--numberless varieties of touch which have not been tabulated  by the schools. Great editors like von Buelow, Busoni and d'Albert have  done much to make the classics clearer to the student; yet they  themselves realize there are a million gradations of touch and tone,  which can never be expressed by signs nor put into words.      FOUR REQUISITES FOR PIANISTS    \"Four things are necessary for the pianist who would make an artistic  success in public. They are: Variety of tone color; Individual and  artistic phrasing; True feeling; Personal magnetism. Colors mean so much  to me; some are so beautiful, the various shades of red, for instance;  then the golden yellows, rich, warm browns, and soft liquid blues. We  can make as wonderful combinations with them as ever the painters do.  To me dark red speaks of something tender, heart-searching, mysterious.\"  Here Mr. Hochman illustrated his words at the piano with an expressive  fragment full of deep feeling. \"On the other hand, the shades of yellow  express gaiety and brightness\"; here the illustrations were all life and  fire, in crisp, brilliant staccatos. Other colors were just as  effectively represented.    \"What I have just indicated at the keyboard,\" continued the artist,  \"gives a faint idea of what can be done with tone coloring, and why I  feel that pianists who neglect this side of their art, or do not see  this side of it, are missing just so much beauty. I could name one  pianist, a great name in the world of music--a man with an absolutely  flawless technic, yet whose playing to me, is dry and colorless; it  gives you no ideas, nothing you can carry away: it is like water--water.  Another, with great variety of tonal beauty, gives me many ideas--many  pictures of tone. His name is Gabrilowitsch; he is for me the greatest  pianist.      MAKING CLIMAXES PIANISSIMO    \"In my own playing, when I color a phrase, I do not work up to a climax  and make that the loudest note, as most pianists do, but rather the  soft note of the phrase; this applies to lyric playing. I will show you  what I mean. Here is a fragment of two measures, containing a soulful  melody. I build up the crescendo, as you see, and at the highest point,  which you might expect to be the loudest, you find instead that it is  soft: the sharpness has been taken out of it, the thing you did not  expect has happened; and so there are constant surprises, tonal  surprises--tone colors not looked for.    \"It is generally thought that a pianist should attend many recitals and  study the effects made by other pianists; I, on the contrary, feel I  gain more from hearing a great singer. The human voice is the greatest  of all instruments, and the player can have no more convincing lesson in  tone production and tone coloring, than he can obtain from listening to  a great emotional singer. The pianist should hear a great deal of opera,  for there he will learn much of color, of effect, light and shade,  action and emotion.      WE DO NOT WANT CUT-AND-DRIED PERFORMANCES    \"The third requisite for the pianist, as I have said, is true feeling. I  have no sympathy with dry, mechanical performance, where every effect  is coldly calculated beforehand, and the player always strives to do it  the same way. How can he always play the same way when he does not feel  the same? If he simply seeks for uniformity where does the inspiration  come in?    \"The true artist will never give a mechanical performance. At one time  he may be in a tender, melting mood; at another in a daring or exalted  one. He must be free to play as he feels, and he will be artist enough  never to overstep bounds. The pianist who plays with true feeling and  'heart' can never play the same composition twice exactly alike, for he  can never feel precisely the same twice. This, of course, applies more  especially to public performance and playing for others.    \"Another essential is breath control. Respiration must be easy and  natural, no matter how much physical strength is exerted. In  _fortissimo_ and all difficult passages, the lips must be kept closed  and respiration taken through the nostrils, as it always ought to be.      DISSECTION OF DETAILS    \"Yes, I do a great deal of teaching, but prefer to take only such pupils  as are intelligent and advanced. With pupils I am very particular about  hand position and touch. The ends of the fingers must be firm, but  otherwise the hand, wrist and arm, from the shoulder, are all relaxed.  In teaching a composition, I am immensely careful and particular about  each note. Everything is dissected and analyzed. When all is understood  and mastered, it is then ready for the stage setting, the actors, the  lights, and the colors!\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"I was intended for a pianist from the first. Born in Russia, I  afterward came to Berlin, studying seven or eight years with Xaver  Scharwenka, then with d'Albert, Stavenhagen and others. But when one has  all that can be learned from others, a man's greatest teacher is  himself. I have done a great deal of concert work and recital playing in  Europe, and have appeared with the leading orchestras in the largest  cities of America.\"    Mr. Hochman has done considerable work in composition. Numerous songs  have been published and doubtless larger works may be expected later.          XXI    TERESA CARRENO    EARLY TECHNICAL TRAINING      A music critic remarked, \"That ever youthful and fascinating pianist,  Teresa Carreno is with us again.\"    I well remember how fascinated I was, as a young girl, with her playing  the first time I heard it--it was so full of fire, enthusiasm,  brilliancy and charm. How I longed and labored to imitate it--to be able  to play like that! I not only loved her playing but her whole  appearance, her gracious manner as she walked across the stage, her air  of buoyancy and conscious mastery as she sat at the piano; her round  white arms and wrists, and--the red sash she wore!    During a recent talk with Mme. Carreno, I recalled the above incident,  which amused her,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1561"],[0,"Pagan and Christian Creeds: Their Origin and Meaning (#18)"],[1,"AWARE of this, and how far by  separation (which is the genius of evolution) each individual creature  has become conscious of the interior nature both of itself and of the  other creatures AND of the great whole which includes them all.    Finally, and to avoid misunderstanding, let me say that  Anthropomorphism, in man's conception of the gods, is itself of course  only a stage and destined to pass away. In so far, that is, as the  term indicates a belief in divine beings corresponding to our PRESENT  conception of ourselves--that is as separate personalities having each  a separate and limited character and function, and animated by  the separatist motives of ambition, possession, power, vainglory,  superiority, patronage, self-greed, self-satisfaction, etc.--in so far  as anthropomorphism is the expression of that kind of belief it is of  course destined, with the illusion from which it springs, to pass away.  When man arrives at the final consciousness in which the idea of such a  self, superior or inferior or in any way antagonistic to others, ceases  to operate, then he will return to his first and primal condition, and  will cease to need ANY special religion or gods, knowing himself and all  his fellows to be divine and the origin and perfect fruition of all.          VII. RITES OF EXPIATION AND REDEMPTION    There is a passage in Richard Jefferies' imperishably beautiful book  The Story of my Heart--a passage well known to all lovers of that  prose-poet--in which he figures himself standing \"in front of the Royal  Exchange where the wide pavement reaches out like a promontory,\" and  pondering on the vast crowd and the mystery of life. \"Is there any  theory, philosophy, or creed,\" he says, \"is there any system of culture,  any formulated method, able to meet and satisfy each separate item of  this agitated pool of human life? By which they may be guided, by which  they may hope, by which look forward? Not a mere illusion of the craving  heart--something real, as real as the solid walls of fact against  which, like seaweed, they are dashed; something to give each separate  personality sunshine and a flower in its own existence now; something  to shape this million-handed labor to an end and outcome that will leave  more sunshine and more flowers to those who must succeed? Something real  now, and not in the spirit-land; in this hour now, as I stand and the  sun burns.... Full well aware that all has failed, yet, side by side  with the sadness of that knowledge, there lives on in me an unquenchable  belief, thought burning like the sun, that there is yet something to  be found.... It must be dragged forth by the might of thought from the  immense forces of the universe.\"    In answer to this passage we may say \"No,--a thousand times No! there  is no theory, philosophy, creed, system or formulated method which  will meet or ever satisfy the demand of each separate item of the  human whirlpool.\" And happy are we to know there is no such thing! How  terrible if one of these bloodless 'systems' which strew the history  of religion and philosophy and the political and social paths of  human endeavor HAD been found absolutely correct and universally  applicable--so that every human being would be compelled to pass  through its machine-like maw, every personality to be crushed under  its Juggernath wheels! No, thank Heaven! there is no theory or creed or  system; and yet there is something--as Jefferies prophetically felt and  with a great longing desired--that CAN satisfy; and that, the root  of all religion, has been hinted at in the last chapter. It is the  CONSCIOUSNESS of the world-life burning, blazing, deep down within us:  it is the Soul's intuition of its roots in Omnipresence and Eternity.    The gods and the creeds of the past, as shown in the last  chapter--whatever they may have been, animistic or anthropomorphic  or transcendental, whether grossly brutish or serenely ideal and  abstract--are essentially projections of the human mind; and no doubt  those who are anxious to discredit the religious impulse generally will  catch at this, saying \"Yes, they are mere forms and phantoms of the  mind, ephemeral dreams, projected on the background of Nature, and  having no real substance or solid value. The history of Religion (they  will say) is a history of delusion and illusion; why waste time over  it? These divine grizzly Bears or Aesculapian Snakes, these cat-faced  Pashts, this Isis, queen of heaven, and Astarte and Baal and Indra  and Agni and Kali and Demeter and the Virgin Mary and Apollo and Jesus  Christ and Satan and the Holy Ghost, are only shadows cast outwards onto  a screen; the constitution of the human mind makes them all tend to  be anthropomorphic; but that is all; they each and all inevitably pass  away. Why waste time over them?\"    And this is in a sense a perfectly fair way of looking at the matter.  These gods and creeds ARE only projections of the human mind. But all  the same it misses, does this view, the essential fact. It misses the  fact that there is no shadow without a fire, that the very existence of  a shadow argues a light somewhere (though we may not directly see it) as  well as the existence of a solid form which intercepts that light.  Deep, deep in the human mind there is that burning blazing light of  the world-consciousness--so deep indeed that the vast majority of  individuals are hardly aware of its existence. Their gaze turned  outwards is held and riveted by the gigantic figures and processions  passing across their sky; they are unaware that the latter are only  shadows--silhouettes of the forms inhabiting their own minds. (1) The  vast majority of people have never observed their own minds; their own  mental forms. They have only observed the reflections cast by these.  Thus it may be said, in this matter, that there are three degrees of  reality. There are the mere shadows--the least real and most  evanescent; there are the actual mental outlines of humanity (and of  the individual), much more real, but themselves also of course slowly  changing; and most real of all, and permanent, there is the light \"which  lighteth every man that cometh into the world\"--the glorious light  of the world-consciousness. Of this last it may be said that it never  changes. Every thing is known to it--even the very IMPEDIMENTS to its  shining. But as it is from the impediments to the shining of a light  that shadows are cast, so we now may understand that the things of this  world and of humanity, though real in their degree, have chiefly a  kind of negative value; they are opaquenesses, clouds, materialisms,  ignorances, and the inner light falling upon them gradually reveals  their negative character and gradually dissolves them away till they  are lost in the extreme and eternal Splendor. I think Jefferies, when  he asked that question with which I have begun this chapter, was in some  sense subconsciously, if not quite consciously, aware of the answer. His  frequent references to the burning blazing sun throughout The Story of  the Heart seem to be an indication of his real deep-down attitude of  mind.     (1) See, in the same connection, Plato's allegory of the Cave,  Republic, Book vii.      The shadow-figures of the creeds and theogonies pass away truly like  ephemeral dreams; but to say that time spent in their study is wasted,  is a mistake, for they have value as being indications of things much  more real than themselves, namely, of the stages of evolution of the  human mind. The fact that a certain god-figure, however grotesque and  queer, or a certain creed, however childish, cruel, and illogical, held  sway for a considerable time over the hearts of men in any corner or  continent of the world is good evidence that it represented a real  formative urge at the time in the hearts of those good people, and  a definite stage in their evolution and the evolution of humanity.  Certainly it was destined to pass away, but it was a step, and a  necessary step in the great process; and certainly it was opaque and  brutish, but it is through the opaque things of the world, and not  through the transparent, that we become aware of the light.    It may be worth while to give instances of how some early rituals and  creeds, in themselves apparently barbarous or preposterous, were really  the indications of important moral and social conceptions evolving in  the heart of man. Let us take, first, the religious customs connected  with the ideas of Sacrifice and of Sin, of which such innumerable  examples are now to be found in the modern books on Anthropology. If we  assume, as I have done more than once, that the earliest state of Man  was one in which he did not consciously separate himself from the world,  animate and inanimate, which surrounded him, then (as I have also said)  it was perfectly natural for him to take some animal which bulked large  on his horizon--some food-animal for instance--and to pay respect to it  as the benefactor of his tribe, its far-back ancestor and totem-symbol;  or, seeing the boundless blessing of the cornfields, to believe in  some kind of spirit of the corn (not exactly a god but rather a magical  ghost) which, reincarnated every year, sprang up to save mankind  from famine. But then no sooner had he done this than he was bound to  perceive that in cutting down the corn or in eating his totem-bear  or kangaroo he was slaying his own best self and benefactor. In  that instant the consciousness of DISUNITY, the sense of sin in some  undefined yet no less disturbing and alarming form would come in. If,  before, his ritual magic had been concentrated on the simple purpose of  multiplying the animal or, vegetable forms of his food, now in addition  his magical endeavor would be turned to averting the just wrath of the  spirits who animated these forms--just indeed, for the rudest savage  would perceive the wrong done and the probability of its"]]]
