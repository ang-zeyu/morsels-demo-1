Semi-Deponents are verbs which have the Present System in the  Active Voice, but the Perfect System in the Passive without change of  meaning. Here belong--      audeo,     audere,    ausus sum, _to dare_.    gaudeo,    gaudere,   gavisus sum, _to rejoice_.    soleo,     solere,    solitus sum, _to be wont_.    fido,      fidere,    fisus sum, _to trust_.    2. The following verbs have a Perfect Passive Participle with Active  meaning:--      adolesco, _grow up_;  adultus, _having grown up_,    cenare, _dine_;       cenatus, _having dined_.    placere, _please_;    placitus, _having pleased_, _agreeable_.    prandere, _lunch_;    pransus, _having lunched_.    potare, _drink_;      potus, _having drunk_.    jurare, _swear_;      juratus, _having sworn_.      a. Juratus is used in a passive sense also.    3. Revertor and devertor both regularly form their Perfect in the Active  Voice; _viz_.--      revertor,  reverti (Inf.),  reverti (Perf.), _to return_.    devertor,  deverti (Inf.),  deverti (Perf.), _to turn aside_.           *       *       *       *       *    PERIPHRASTIC CONJUGATION.    115. There are two Periphrastic Conjugations,--the Active and the Passive.  The Active is formed by combining the Future Active Participle with the  auxiliary sum, the Passive by combining the Gerundive with the same  auxiliary.                          Active Periphrastic Conjugation.                                  INDICATIVE MOOD.    _Pres._     amaturus (-a, -um) sum, _I am about to love_.    _Inf._      amaturus eram, _I was about to love_.    _Fut._      amaturus ero, _I shall be about to love_.    _Perf._     amaturus fui, _I have been (was) about to love_.    _Plup._     amaturus fueram, _I had been about to love_.    _Fut. P._   amaturus fuero, _I shall have been about to love_.                                    SUBJUNCTIVE.    _Pres._     amaturus sim, _may I be about to love_.    _Imp._      amaturus essem, _I should be about to love_.    _Perf._     amaturus fuerim, _I may have been about to love_.    _Plup._     amaturus fuissem, _I should have been about to love_.

Passive Periphrastic Conjugation.                                    INDICATIVE.    _Pres._     amandus (-a, -um) sum, _I am to be loved_, _must be loved_.    _Imp._      amandus eram, _I was to be loved_.    _Fut._      amandus ero, _I shall deserve to be loved_.    _Perf._     amandus fui, _I was to be loved_.    _Plup._     amandus fueram, _I had deserved to be loved_.    _Fut.

INFINITIVE.    _Pres._     amandus esse, _to deserve to be loved_.    _Perf._     amantus fuisse, _to have deserved to be loved_.           *       *       *       *       *    PECULIARITIES OF CONJUGATION.    116. 1. Perfects in -avi, -evi, and -ivi, with the forms derived from them,  often drop the ve or vi before endings beginning with r or s. So also novi  (from nosco) and the compounds of movi (from moveo). Thus:--      amavisti      amasti            delevisti     delesti    amavisse      amasse            delevisse     delesse    amaverunt     amarunt           deleverunt    delerunt    amaverim      amarim            deleverim     delerim    amaveram      amaram            deleveram     deleram    amavero       amaro             delevero      delero    novisti       nosti             noverim       norim    novisse       nosse             noveram       noram    audivisti     audisti           audivisse     audisse    2. In the Gerund and Gerundive of the Third and Fourth Conjugations, the  endings -undus, -undi, often occur instead of -endus and -endi, as  faciundus, faciundi.    3. Dico, duco, facio, form the Imperatives, dic, duc, fac. But compounds of  facio form the Imperative in -fice, as confice. Compounds of dico, duco,  accent the ultima; as, edu'c, edi'c.    4. Archaic and Poetic forms:--      a. The ending -ier in the Present Infinitive Passive; as, amarier,    monerier, dicier, for amari, moneri, dici.      b. The ending -ibam for -iebam in Imperfects of the Fourth Conjugation,    and -ibo for -iam in Futures; as, scibam, scibo, for sciebam, sciam.      c. Instead of the fuller forms, in such words as dixisti, scripsistis,    surrexisse, we sometimes find dixti, scripstis, surrexe, etc.      d. The endings -im, -is, etc. (for -am, -as, etc.) occur in a few    Subjunctive forms; as, edim (_eat_), duint, perduint.    5. In the Future Active and Perfect Passive Infinitive, the auxiliary esse  is often omitted; as, acturum for acturum esse; ejectus for ejectus esse.           *       *       *       *       *    FORMATION OF THE VERB STEMS.    Formation of the Present Stem.    117. Many verbs employ the simple Verb Stem for the Present Stem;[39] as,  dicere, amare, monere, audire. Others modify the Verb Stem to form the  Present, as follows:--    1. By appending the vowels, a, e, i; as,--                Present Stem   Verb Stem    juvare,      juva-         juv-.    augere,      auge-         aug-.    vincire,     vinci-        vinc-.    2. By adding i, as capio, Present Stem capi- (Verb Stem cap-).    3. By the insertion of n (m before labial-mutes) before the final consonant  of the Verb Stem; as, fundo (Stem fud-), rumpo (Stem rup-).    4. By appending -n to the Verb Stem; as,--      cern-o                    pell-o (for pel-no).    5. By appending t to the Verb Stem; as,--                 flect-o.    6. By appending sc to the Verb Stem; as,--      cresc-o.                  scisc-o.    7. By Reduplication, that is, by prefixing the initial consonant of the  Verb Stem with i; as,--      gi-gn-o (root gen-),      si-st-o (root sta-).    Formation of the Perfect Stem.    118. The Perfect Stem is formed from the Verb Stem--    1. By adding v (in case of Vowel"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15673"],[0,"The Day of the Beast (#18)"],[1,"toward Lane.    \"Don't lay a hand on me,\" replied Lane. \"I don't want my uniform  soiled.\"    With that Lane turned to Dalrymple, and said quietly: \"Holt, I came here  to find you, not to play cards. That was a stall. Come away with me. You  were not cut out for a card sharp or a booze fighter.  What's got into you that you can gamble and drink with _slackers_?\"    Dalrymple jammed his hat on and stepped toward the door. \"Dare, you  said a lot. I'll beat it with you--and I'll never come back.\"    \"You bet your sweet life you won't,\" shouted Swann.    \"Hold on there, Dalrymple,\" interposed Mackay, stepping out. \"Come  across with that eighty-six bucks you owe me.\"    \"I--I haven't got it, Mackay,\" rejoined the boy, flushing deeply.    Lane ripped open his coat and jerked out his pocket-book and tore  bills out of it. \"There, Hardy Mackay,\" he said, with deliberate  scorn, throwing the money on the table. \"There are your eighty-six  dollars--_earned_ in France.... I should think it'd burn your  fingers.\"    He drew Holt out into the hall, where Pepper waited. Some one slammed  the door and began to curse.    \"That ends that,\" said Colonel Pepper, as the three moved down the dim  hall.    \"It ends us, Pepper, but you couldn't stop those guys with a crowbar,\"  retorted Dalrymple.    Lane linked arms with the boy and changed the conversation while they  walked back to the inn. Here Colonel Pepper left them, and Lane talked  to Holt for an hour. The more he questioned Holt the better he liked  him, and yet the more surprised was he at the sordid fact of the boy's  inclination toward loose living. There was something perhaps that Holt  would not confess. His health had been impaired in the service, but not  seriously. He was getting stronger all the time. His old job was waiting  for him. His mother and sister had enough to live on, but if he had been  working he could have helped them in a way to afford him great  satisfaction.    \"Holt, listen,\" finally said Lane, with more earnestness. \"We're  friends--all boys of the service are friends. We might even become  great pards, if we had time.\"    \"What's time got to do with it?\" queried the younger man. \"I'm sure  I'd like it--and know it'd help me.\"    \"I'm shot to pieces, Holt.... I won't last long....\"    \"Aw, Lane, don't say that!\"    \"It's true. And if I'm to help you at all it must be now.... You  haven't told me everything, boy--now have you?\"    Holt dropped his head.    \"I'll say--I haven't,\" he replied, haltingly. \"Lane--the trouble  is--I'm clean gone on Margie Maynard. But her mother hates the sight  of me. She won't stand for me.\"    \"Oho! So that's it?\" ejaculated Lane, a light breaking in upon him.  \"Well, I'll be darned. It _is_ serious, Holt.... Does Margie love  you?\"    \"Sure she does. We've always cared. Don't you remember how Margie and  I and Dal and you used to go to school together? And come home  together? And play on Saturdays?... Ever since then!... But lately  Margie and I are--we got--pretty badly mixed up.\"    \"Yes, I remember those days,\" replied Lane, dreamily, and suddenly he  recalled Dal's dark eyes, somehow haunting. He had to make an effort  to get back to the issue at hand.    \"If Margie loves you--why it's all right. Go back to work and marry  her.\"    \"Lane, it can't be all right. Mrs. Maynard has handed me the mitt,\"  replied Holt, bitterly. \"And Margie hasn't the courage to run off with  me.... Her mother is throwing Margie at Swann--because he's rich.\"    \"Oh Lord, no--Holt--you can't mean _it_!\" exclaimed Lane, aghast.    \"I'll say I do mean it. I _know_ it,\" returned Holt, moodily. \"So I  let go--fell into the dumps--didn't care a d---- what became of me.\"    Lane was genuinely shocked. What a tangle he had fallen upon! Once  again there seemed to confront him a colossal Juggernaut, a moving,  crushing, intangible thing, beyond his power to cope with.    \"Now, what can I do?\" queried Holt, in sudden hope his friend might  see a way out.    Despairingly, Lane racked his brain for some word of advice or  assurance, if not of solution. But he found none. Then his spirit  mounted, and with it passion.    \"Holt, don't be a miserable coward,\" he began, in fierce scorn.  \"You're a soldier, man, and you've got your life to _live_!... The sun  will rise--the days will be long and pleasant--you can work--_do_  something. You can fish the streams in summer and climb the hills in  autumn. You can enjoy. Bah! don't tell me one shallow girl means the  world. If Margie hasn't courage enough to run off and marry you--_let  her go!_ But you can never tell. Maybe Margie will stick to you. I'll  help you. Margie and I have always been friends and I'll try to  influence her. Then think of your mother and sister. Work for _them_.  Forget yourself--your little, miserable, selfish desires.... My God,  boy, but it's a strange life the war's left us to face. I _hate_ it.  So do you hate it. Swann and Mackay giving nothing and getting all!...  So it looks.... But it's false--false. God did not intend men to live  solely for their bodies. A balance _must_ be struck. They have _got_  to pay. Their time will come.... As for you, the harder this job is  the fiercer you should be. I've got to die, Holt. But if I could live  I'd show these slackers, these fickle wild girls, what they're  doing.... You can do it, Holt. It's the greatest part any man could be  called upon to play. It will prove the difference between you and  them....\"    Holt Dalrymple crushed Lane's hand in both his own. On his face was a  glow--his dark eyes flashed: \"Lane--that'll be about all,\" he burst  out with a kind of breathlessness. Then his head high, he stalked out.    The next day was bad. Lane suffered from both over-exertion and  intensity of emotion. He remained at home all day, in bed most of the  time. At supper time he went downstairs to find Lorna pirouetting in a  new dress, more abbreviated at top and bottom than any costume he had  seen her wear. The effect struck him at an inopportune time. He told  her flatly that she looked like a French grisette of the music halls,  and ought to be ashamed to be seen in such attire.    \"Daren, I don't think you're a good judge of clothes these days,\" she  observed, complacently. \"The boys will say I look spiffy in this.\"    So many times Lorna's trenchant remarks silenced Lane. She hit the  nail on the head. Practical, logical, inevitable were some of her  speeches. She knew what men wanted. That was the pith of her meaning.  What else mattered?    \"But Lorna, suppose you don't look nice?\" he questioned.    \"I _do_ look nice,\" she retorted.    \"You don't look anything of the kind.\"    \"What's nice? It's only a word. It doesn't mean much in my young  life.\"    \"Where are you going to-night?\" he asked, sitting down to the table.    \"To the armory--basketball game--and dance afterward.\"    \"With whom?\"    \"With Harry. I suppose that pleases you, big brother?\"    \"Yes, it does. I like him. I wish he'd take you out oftener.\"    \"_Take_ me! Hot dog! He'd kill himself to take me all the time. But  Harry's slow. He bores me. Then he hasn't got a car.\"    \"Lorna, you may as well know now that I'm going to stop your car  rides,\" said Lane, losing his patience.    \"You are _not_,\" she retorted, and in the glint of the eyes meeting  his, Lane saw his defeat. His patience was exhausted, his fear almost  verified. He did not mince words. With his mother standing  open-mouthed and shocked, Lane gave his sister to understand what he  thought of automobile rides, and that as far as she was concerned they  had to be stopped. If she would not stop them out of respect to her  mother and to him, then he would resort to other measures. Lorna  bounced up in a fury, and in the sharp quarrel that followed, Lane  realized he was dealing with flint full of fire. Lorna left without  finishing her supper.    \"Daren, that's not the way,\" said his mother, shaking her head.    \"What is the way, mother?\" he asked, throwing up his hands.    \"I don't know, unless it's to see her way,\" responded the mother.  \"Sometimes I feel so--so old-fashioned and ignorant before Lorna.  Maybe she is right. How can we tell? What makes all the young girls  like that?\"    What indeed, wondered Lane! The question had been hammering at his  mind for over a month. He went back to bed, weary and dejected,  suffering spasms of pain, like blades, through his lungs, and grateful  for the darkness. Almost he wished it was all over--this ordeal. How  puny his efforts! Relentlessly life marched on. At midnight he was  still fighting his pangs, still unconquered. In the night his dark  room was not empty. There were faces, shadows, moving images and  pictures, scenes of the war limned against the blackness. At last he  rested, grew as free from pain as he ever grew, and slept. In the  morning it was another day, and the past was as if it were not.    May the first dawned ideally springlike, warm, fresh, fragrant, with  birds singing, sky a clear blue, and trees budding green and white.    Lane yielded to an impulse that had grown stronger of late. His steps  drew him to the little drab house where Mel Iden lived with her aunt.  On the way, which led past a hedge, Lane gathered a bunch of violets.    \"'In the spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of  love,'\" he mused. \"It's good, even for _me_, to be alive this  morning.... These violets, the birds, the fresh smells, the bursting  green! Oh, well, regrets are idle. But just to think--I had to go  through all I've known--right down to this moment--to realize how  stingingly sweet life is....\"    Mel answered his knock, and sight of her face seemed to lift his heart  with an unwonted throb. Had he unconsciously needed that? The thought  made his greeting, and the tender of the violets, awkward for him.    \"Violets! Oh, and spring! Daren, it was good of you to gather them for  me. I remember.... But I told you not to come"]]]
