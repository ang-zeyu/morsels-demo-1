The National Institute of Oceanography, which is  responsible for monitoring the seas, observed from the  fence. Whatever the cause, changes were afoot on this  rural coastal land -- the once abundance of resources  strained as it's popularity started to mushroom.    As the clouds melted away for good, shacks started to  spring up like primroses in May. The hoteliers grumbled  -- their 'multi-cuisine' menus just weren't being read.  Politicians took sides with either faction. Some  framing the fight in favour of the shack-owning  under-dogs, others pointing to their lack of civic  responsibility with their spliced electricity wires and  overflowing rubbish out of the backs of the flimsy  beach side establishments.    On the backs of the tourists and travellers flocking to  Goa came the stories of the parties, drug deaths, Anjuna   hot-spots that managed openly flout local licences and  throb on till the early hours of the morning. Crime  also increased -- the mugging of tourists, either on  desolate stretches of beach or in their insecure  dwellings, became more and more widespread. The hotels  brought problems of their own. This being a time of  huge growth, water was sapped up beyond the limits of  the local ecology and the coastal regulation zone (the  area demarcated on the beach up to where the hotels  could be built) was debated and apparently ignored in  many instances.    The international ramifications of a sordid paedophile  ring is exposed, following the conviction of Freddy Peats,  a German national involved in the abuse and traffic  of Goa's under-age. As the grim facts unfold, including  naive support by the Catholic church, the society looks  on in repugnance, wanting to distance itself from such  heinous activities. Once again, Goa's flirtation with  other cultures in a bid to make the most of its  picturesque rural ideal is put into question.    One of the major benefits of such a small team bringing  out fortnightly publication is that we had the  opportunity to experience each of the many ingredients  that make up a well-rounded news magazine.    Towards Christmas, to lighten the load of the heavy  political wrangling, I took to the fields. The paddy  fields that is. As a Goan urban dweller, I am familiar  with the white side of rice -- as it appears in all its  culinary simplicity and elegance on the plate. I am  however completely ignorant of the involved process of  getting to that stage. An 'expose' on the inner  workings of the paddy harvest -- the cutting,  thrashing, pounding and milling -- gives me the chance  to wade through the paddy, chase frogs, and be  generally mocked by good-tempered field workers. Not  quite sure if this is in the general job descriptions  of most journalism openings.    As the season starts to draw to a close, like a hungry  tiger the news machine goes in search of whatever  morsels are on offer. Once again the rains come and  Panjim is filled with the sight of sodden journalists  speeding around in reversed raincoats.    For personal reasons, it's time for me to head home.    On return, an enthusiasm for media leads into trendy  multimedia and somehow I end up dumped in full-blown  information technology, where I am today. As such, I'm  not in the perfect position to be able to compare the  practice of journalism in Goa with that of elsewhere,  although the peculiarities of the working environment  do stand out.    From the original office on the dusty top floor, we are  eventually reshuffled into the air conditioned first  floor vault. The cool air brings a much needed respite  from the heat and dust, and the environment is  definitely less makeshift. The room does have another  feature -- low hanging beams at the end and  (particularly hazardously) in the middle of the room  level out the worst excesses of pomposity with a short  sharp shock. I'm not sure if they are part of a larger  shrewd plan of management, but over the years they have  cracked the head of a number of prominent Goan  journalists and contributors. Exactly quite how this  has affected the quality of output, I'm unsure.    And then there was the technology. Aside from the  hardcore printing machines, large metal plates and  dangerous chemicals lying around, the computers that  sponged up our picture and prose were actually more  contemporary than the ones I had left behind as a  Liverpudlian accountant. As the adoption of the  computer had come in here at a much later stage, the  Herald machines tended to be newer, faster and bigger.  There were just fewer of them. Working under such  limited resources would at time inevitably lead to  fractures. Although we worked on the computers  feverishly in the morning to make way for the daily  staff (whose strict deadline gave them precedence), as  deadline approached tempers could occasionally erupt.    This thing called the Internet had been kicking around  for a few years but towards the end of my tenure was  finally picked up by a journalist fraternity that had  viewed the Internet with scepticism and suspicion (as  did many other people at the time). For us it was just  a dial-up modem taking about two minutes for a standard  sized email, as long as nothing happened to the fragile  connection. As our publication was aimed squarely at  the Goan living abroad, this was an excellent resource  for finding out what the Goan diaspora was up to and  how Goa was perceived on the world stage (especially  important in the area of covering tourism). As an  aside, it also meant that I no longer had to write all  the letters to the editor. Other resources such as the  Goacom website appeared, with intentions sturdy enough  to keep it valid to this day (I can heartily recommend  the recipes!). I think it is safe to say that the  Internet has irrevocably changed the face of  researching, collecting and distributing news. The  availability of this service in The Herald and other  Goan papers marks Goa out as one of the more fortunate  areas of the developing world.    I often wondered how powerful the pen we were wielding  actually was. Beyond the massage of ego of seeing a  by-line in print, it was hard to work out if our  columns of verbiage could actually make a positive  meaningful difference. Covering the depletion of fish  stocks after the rains did, to my surprise, seem to  create a few ripples.    Liquor (hard and soft), was often present in the world  of Goan journalism. Anecdotal evidence from the UK and  US suggests that this is common throughout many other  parts of the world. As with many stereotypes, the one  of the hack at the bar does contain some truth. There  is a quite widely held belief that alcohol gets the  mind churning and the pen moving. A pint at lunchtime  can help be a bit more assertive and searching when the  proud owner of the new enterprise slips into pompous conceit.    There was one ritual we adhered to quite regularly --  once a fortnight, after we had put the paper to bed, we  took to the city to celebrate. A restaurant would  inevitably mean a few pegs of rum. Then onto one of the  few late night drinking establishments: a seedy  corrugated bunker alive with the chatter of civil  servants, cops and journalists. Indian rum formed the  cohesive force -- the basis for a number of nefarious  deals in shady corners. Being not so familiar with the  more subtle political machinations I felt largely sidelined.    I did get a glimpse of the more unsavoury effect if  taken to excess -- seeing the image of older  journalists whose idealism had turned to advanced  alcoholism. Exactly what were the causes remained  unclear, but it wasn't pleasant to see.    But how politically unbiased were we allowed to be? The  advertising versus editorial debate in the press is a  perennial one. Over the year I was with The Herald,  there were a few lapses where there would be direct  influence from commercial interests to have articles in  their favour. Being asked to give the owner of a  prominent luxury hotel a mouthpiece through an  extensive interview did give me the sense of being in  the pockets of big business. However, I had the  authority to go to press with quotes throwing into  question the viability of luxury tourism in a land  where the season lasts little over four months --  slightly dampening the gushing tone of the article.    Rather than being downright manipulative, in hindsight  I would describe the management style as slightly  neurotic, characteristically protecting its own  interests. This led to occasional grumbles, back-talk  and skirmishes among the editorial team; however they  say the best relationships flourish under tension.  Perhaps this was the cohesion needed to keep together  the tribe of English-language hacks who refer to  themselves as 'ex-Herald'.    Being a Goan born and raised in the West, interested in  keeping contact and learning about my more distant  roots, the attempts of The Herald to reach out to the  Goan across the globe was admirable, and I was honoured  to be a part of it. The edition has since folded and it  is a shame that the paper doesn't do more at the  international level now, perhaps utilising new  technologies available to streamline the whole process.    All in all, I feel my tenure at The Herald was a  fruitful one. That is not to deny that the paper has  its troubles, but to an extent newspapers (like  politicians) are merely mirrors of the society they  serve. The fact that it has been a part of the Goan  social and political landscape for the last twenty  years is, if nothing more, testament to its success  within the community.

Subsequently, he has shifted to working at  the prominent Bangalore-based daily, Deccan Herald.

Yours be yon dew-steep'd roses, yours be yon      Thick-clustering ivy, maids of Helicon:      Thine, Pythian Paean, that dark-foliaged bay;      With such thy Delphian crags thy front array.      This horn'd and shaggy ram shall stain thy shrine,      Who crops e'en now the feathering turpentine.          II.        To Pan doth white-limbed Daphnis offer here        (He once piped sweetly on his herdsman's flute)      His reeds of many a stop, his barbed spear,        And scrip, wherein he held his hoards of fruit.          III.          Daphnis, thou slumberest on the leaf-strown lea,          Thy frame at rest, thy springes newly spread        O'er the fell-side. But two are hunting thee:          Pan, and Priapus with his fair young head        Hung with wan ivy. See! they come, they leap      Into thy lair--fly, fly,--shake off the coil of sleep!          IV.        For yon oaken avenue, swain, you must steer,        Where a statue of figwood, you'll see, has been set:      It has never been barked, has three legs and no ear;        But I think there is life in the patriarch yet.      He is handsomely shrined within fair chapel-walls;        Where, fringed with sweet cypress and myrtle and bay,      A stream ever-fresh from the rock's hollow falls,        And the ringleted vine her ripe store doth display:      And the blackbirds, those shrill-piping songsters of spring,        Wake the echoes with wild inarticulate song:      And the notes of the nightingale plaintively ring,        As she pours from her dun throat her lay sweet and strong.      Sitting there, to Priapus, the gracious one, pray        That the lore he has taught me I soon may unlearn:      Say I'll give him a kid, and in case he says nay        To this offer, three victims to him will I burn;      A kid, a fleeced ram, and a lamb sleek and fat;      He will listen, mayhap, to my prayers upon that.          V.        Prythee, sing something sweet to me--you that can play      First and second at once. Then I too will essay      To croak on the pipes: and yon lad shall salute      Our ears with a melody breathed through his flute.      In the cave by the green oak our watch we will keep,      And goatish old Pan we'll defraud of his sleep.          VI.        Poor Thyrsis! What boots it to weep out thine eyes?        Thy kid was a fair one, I own:      But the wolf with his cruel claw made her his prize,        And to darkness her spirit hath flown.      Do the dogs cry? What boots it? In spite of their cries        There is left of her never a bone.          VII.        For a Statue of AEsculapius.        Far as Miletus travelled Paean's son;      There to be guest of Nicias, guest of one      Who heals all sickness; and who still reveres      Him, for his sake this cedarn image rears.      The sculptor's hand right well did Nicias fill;      And here the sculptor lavished all his skill.          VIII.        Ortho's Epitaph.        Friend, Ortho of Syracuse gives thee this charge:      Never venture out, drunk, on a wild winter's night.      I did so and died. My possessions were large;      Yet the turf that I'm clad with is strange to me quite.          IX.        Epitaph of Cleonicus.        Man, husband existence: ne'er launch on the sea        Out of season: our tenure of life is but frail.      Think of poor Cleonicus: for Phasos sailed he        From the valleys of Syria, with many a bale:      With many a bale, ocean's tides he would stem        When the Pleiads were sinking; and he sank with them.          X.        For a Statue of the Muses.        To you this marble statue, maids divine,      Xenocles raised, one tribute unto nine.      Your votary all admit him: by this skill      He gat him fame: and you he honours still.          XI.        Epitaph of Eusthenes.        Here the shrewd physiognomist Eusthenes lies,      Who could tell all your thoughts by a glance at your eyes.      A stranger, with strangers his honoured bones rest;      They valued sweet song, and he gave them his best.      All the honours of death doth the poet possess:      If a small one, they mourned for him nevertheless.          XII.        For a Tripod Erected by Damoteles to Bacchus.        The precentor Damoteles, Bacchus, exalts        Your tripod, and, sweetest of deities, you.      He was champion of men, if his boyhood had faults;        And he ever loved honour and seemliness too.          XIII.        For a Statue of Anacreon.        This statue, stranger, scan with earnest gaze;        And, home returning, say \"I have beheld      Anacreon, in Teos; him whose lays        Were all unmatched among our sires of eld.\"      Say further: \"Youth and beauty pleased him best;\"        And all the man will fairly stand exprest.          XIV.        Epitaph of Eurymedon.        Thou hast gone to the grave, and abandoned thy son      Yet a babe, thy own manhood but scarcely begun.      Thou art throned among gods: and thy country will take      Thy child to her heart, for his brave father's sake.          XV.        Another.        Prove, traveller, now, that you honour the brave      Above the poltroon, when he's laid in the grave,      By murmuring 'Peace to Eurymedon dead.'      The turf should lie light on so sacred a head.          XVI.        For a Statue of the Heavenly Aphrodite.        Aphrodite stands here; she of heavenly birth;      Not that base one who's wooed by the children of earth.      'Tis a goddess; bow down. And one blemishless all,      Chrysogone, placed her in Amphicles' hall:      Chrysogone's heart, as her children, was his,      And each year they knew better what happiness is.      For, Queen, at life's outset they made thee their friend;      Religion is policy too in the end.          XVII.        To Epicharmus.        Read these lines to Epicharmus. They are Dorian, as was he          The sire of Comedy.      Of his proper self bereaved, Bacchus, unto thee we rear          His brazen image here;      We in Syracuse who sojourn, elsewhere born. Thus much we can          Do for our countryman,      Mindful of the debt we owe him. For, possessing ample store          Of legendary lore,      Many a wholesome word, to pilot youths and maids thro' life, he spake:          We honour him for their sake.          XVIII.        Epitaph of Cleita, Nurse of Medeius.        The babe Medeius to his Thracian nurse        This stone--inscribed _To Cleita_--reared in the midhighway.        Her modest virtues oft shall men rehearse;      Who doubts it? is not 'Cleita's worth' a proverb to this day?          XIX.        To Archilochus.        Pause, and scan well Archilochus, the bard of elder days,          By east and west          Alike's confest        The mighty lyrist's praise.      Delian Apollo loved him well, and well the sister-choir:          His songs were fraught          With subtle thought,        And matchless was his lyre.          XX.        Under a Statue of Peisander,      WHO WROTE THE LABOURS OF HERACLES.        He whom ye gaze on was the first      That in quaint song the deeds rehearsed      Of him whose arm was swift to smite,      Who dared the lion to the fight:      That tale, so strange, so manifold,      Peisander of Cameirus told.      For this good work, thou may'st be sure,        His country placed him here,      In solid brass that shall endure      Through many a month and year.          XXI.        Epitaph of Hipponax.        Behold Hipponax' burialplace,        A true bard's grave.      Approach it not, if you're a base        And base-born knave.      But if your sires were honest men        And unblamed you,      Sit down thereon serenely then,        And eke sleep too.               *       *       *       *       *        Tuneful Hipponax rests him here.      Let no base rascal venture near.      Ye who rank high in birth and mind      Sit down--and sleep, if so inclined.          XXII.        On his own Book.        Not my namesake of Chios, but I, who belong      To the Syracuse burghers, have sung you my song.      I'm Praxagoras' son by Philinna the fair,      And I never asked praise that was owing elsewhere."]]]
