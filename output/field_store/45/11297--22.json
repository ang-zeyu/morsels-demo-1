But then we  can't have all the luxuries of life in the far West; sure to be  something lacking.\"    \"I never hear a man hanker for liquor,\" said Conajo, as he poured out  a tin cup of coffee, \"but I think of an incident my father used to  tell us boys at home. He was sheriff in Kentucky before we moved to  Texas. Was sheriff in the same county for twelve years. Counties are  very irregular back in the old States. Some look like a Mexican brand.  One of the rankest, rabid political admirers my father had lived away  out on a spur of this county. He lived good thirty miles from the  county seat. Didn't come to town over twice a year, but he always  stopped, generally over night, at our house. My father wouldn't have  it any other way. Talk about thieves being chummy; why, these two we  have here couldn't hold a candle to that man and my father. I can see  them parting just as distinctly as though it was yesterday. He would  always abuse my father for not coming to see him. 'Sam,' he would  say,--my father's name was Sam,--'Sam, why on earth is it that  you never come to see me? I've heard of you within ten miles of my  plantation, and you have never shown your face to us once. Do you  think we can't entertain you? Why, Sam, I've known you since you  weren't big enough to lead a hound dog. I've known you since you  weren't knee to a grasshopper.'    \"'Let me have a word,' my father would put in, for he was very mild  in speaking; 'let me have a word, Joe. I hope you don't think for a  moment that I wouldn't like to visit you; now do you?'    \"'No, I don't think so, Sam, but you don't come. That's why I'm  complaining. You never have come in the whole ten years you've been  sheriff, and you know that we have voted for you to a man, in our  neck of the woods.' My father felt this last remark, though I think  he never realized its gravity before, but he took him by one hand, and  laying the other on his shoulder said, 'Joe, if I have slighted you  in the past, I'm glad you have called my attention to it. Now, let me  tell you the first time that my business takes me within ten miles  of your place I'll make it a point to reach your house and stay all  night, and longer if I can.'    \"'That's all I ask, Sam,' was his only reply. Now I've learned lots  of the ways of the world since then. I've seen people pleasant to each  other, and behind their backs the tune changed. But I want to say  to you fellows that those two old boys were not throwing off on each  other--not a little bit. They meant every word and meant it deep. It  was months afterwards, and father had been gone for a week when he  came home. He told us about his visit to Joe Evans. It was winter  time, and mother and us boys were sitting around the old fireplace in  the evening. 'I never saw him so embarrassed before in my life,' said  father. 'I did ride out of my way, but I was glad of the chance. Men  like Joe Evans are getting scarce.' He nodded to us boys. 'It was  nearly dark when I rode up to his gate. He recognized me and came down  to the gate to meet me. \"Howdy, Sam,\" was all he said. There was a  troubled expression in his face, though he looked well enough, but he  couldn't simply look me in the face. Just kept his eye on the ground.  He motioned for a nigger boy and said to him, \"Take his horse.\" He  started to lead the way up the path, when I stopped him. \"Look here,  Joe,\" I said to him. \"Now, if there's anything wrong, anything likely  to happen in the family, I can just as well drop back on the pike and  stay all night with some of the neighbors. You know I'm acquainted all  around here.\" He turned in the path, and there was the most painful  look in his face I ever saw as he spoke: \"Hell, no, Sam, there's  nothing wrong. We've got plenty to eat, plenty of beds, no end of  horse-feed, but by G----, Sam, there isn't a drop of whiskey on the  place!\"'    \"You see it was hoss and cabello, and Joe seemed to think the hoss  on him was an unpardonable offense. Salt? You'll find it in an empty  one-spoon baking-powder can over there. In those panniers that belong  to that big sorrel mule. Look at Mexico over there burying his fangs  in the venison, will you?\"    Ramrod was on guard, but he was so hungry himself that he was good  enough to let the prisoners eat at the same time, although he kept  them at a respectable distance. He was old in the service, and had  gotten his name under a baptism of fire. He was watching a pass once  for smugglers at a point called Emigrant Gap. This was long before he  had come to the present company. At length the man he was waiting for  came along. Ramrod went after him at close quarters, but the fellow  was game and drew his gun. When the smoke cleared away, Ramrod had  brought down his horse and winged his man right and left. The smuggler  was not far behind on the shoot, for Ramrod's coat and hat showed he  was calling for him. The captain was joshing the prisoner about his  poor shooting when Ramrod brought him into camp and they were dressing  his wounds. \"Well,\" said the fellow, \"I tried to hard enough, but I  couldn't find him. He's built like a ramrod.\"    After breakfast was over we smoked and yarned. It would be two-hour  guards for the day, keeping an eye on the prisoners and stock, only  one man required; so we would all get plenty of sleep. Conajo had the  first guard after breakfast. \"I remember once,\" said Sergeant Smoky,  as he crushed a pipe of twist with the heel of his hand, \"we were  camped out on the 'Sunset' railway. I was a corporal at the time.  There came a message one day to our captain, to send a man up West on  that line to take charge of a murderer. The result was, I was sent by  the first train to this point. When I arrived I found that an  Irishman had killed a Chinaman. It was on the railroad, at a bridge  construction camp, that the fracas took place. There were something  like a hundred employees at the camp, and they ran their own  boarding-tent. They had a Chinese cook at this camp; in fact, quite a  number of Chinese were employed at common labor on the road.    \"Some cavalryman, it was thought, in passing up and down from Fort  Stockton to points on the river, had lost his sabre, and one of this  bridge gang had found it. When it was brought into camp no one would  have the old corn-cutter; but this Irishman took a shine to it, having  once been a soldier himself. The result was, it was presented to  him. He ground it up like a machette, and took great pride in giving  exhibitions with it. He was an old man now, the storekeeper for the  iron supplies, a kind of trusty job. The old sabre renewed his  youth to a certain extent, for he used it in self-defense shortly  afterwards. This Erin-go-bragh--his name was McKay, I think--was in  the habit now and then of stealing a pie from the cook, and taking  it into his own tent and eating it there. The Chink kept missing his  pies, and got a helper to spy out the offender. The result was they  caught the old man red-handed in the act. The Chink armed himself with  the biggest butcher-knife he had and went on the warpath. He found the  old fellow sitting in his storeroom contentedly eating the pie. The  old man had his eyes on the cook, and saw the knife just in time to  jump behind some kegs of nuts and bolts. The Chink followed him with  murder in his eye, and as the old man ran out of the tent he picked  up the old sabre. Once clear of the tent he turned and faced him,  made only one pass, and cut his head off as though he were beheading  a chicken. They hadn't yet buried the Chinaman when I got there. I'm  willing to testify it was an artistic job. They turned the old man  over to me, and I took him down to the next station, where an old  alcalde lived,--Roy Bean by name. This old judge was known as 'Law  west of the Pecos,' as he generally construed the law to suit his own  opinion of the offense. He wasn't even strong on testimony. He was a  ranchman at this time, so when I presented my prisoner he only said,  'Killed a Chinese, did he? Well, I ain't got time to try the case  to-day. Cattle suffering for water, and three windmills out of repair.  Bring him back in the morning.' I took the old man back to the hotel,  and we had a jolly good time together that day. I never put a string  on him, only locked the door, but we slept together. The next morning  I took him before the alcalde. Bean held court in an outhouse, the  prisoner seated on a bale of flint hides. Bean was not only judge but  prosecutor, as well as counsel for the defense. 'Killed a Chinaman,  did you?'    \"'I did, yer Honor,' was the prisoner's reply.    \"I suggested to the court that the prisoner be informed of his rights,  that he need not plead guilty unless he so desired.    \"'That makes no difference here,' said the court. 'Gentlemen, I'm busy  this morning. I've got to raise the piping out of a two-hundred-foot  well to-day,--something the matter with the valve at the bottom. I'll  just glance over the law a moment.'    \"He rummaged over a book or two for a few moments and then said,  'Here, I reckon this is near enough. I find in the revised statute  before me, in the killing of a nigger the offending party was fined  five dollars. A Chinaman ought to be half as good as a nigger. Stand  up and receive your sentence. What's your name?'    \"'Jerry McKay, your Honor.'    \"Just then the court noticed one of the vaqueros belonging to the  ranch standing in the door, hat in hand, and he called to him in  Spanish, 'Have my horse ready, I'll be through here just in a minute.'    \"'McKay,' said the court as he gave him a withering look, 'I'll fine  you two dollars and a half and costs. Officer, take charge of  the prisoner until it's paid!'
