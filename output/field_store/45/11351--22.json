So Sigurd, seeing her sad and in  no wise guessing the cause of her grief, strove to comfort her with  kindly words, but her mood was still unchanged.    Then Grimhild the Queen, who was a witch-wife and a woman of crafty  mind, marked the love of Gudrun for Sigurd, and marked moreover how  his power and honour in the land would soon be greater than that of  her own sons. Therefore she cast about for some shift that might bind  Sigurd to serve with the Niblungs all his life-days.    Now it befell one night that Sigurd had returned from warring and sat  on the high-seat to sup with the Niblung kings. His heart was merry  with victory and ever he thought of Hindfell and of Lymdale and the  love of Brynhild. The people waxed joyful, and the hangings whereon  glowed figures of the gods were stirred with their song and shouting  till Giuki called on Sigurd to take the harp and sing of deeds agone.  Then all men hearkened, hushed and happy, while Sigurd struck the  strings and sang of his mighty kin, of Volsung, of Signy, and of  Sigmund, their deeds and noble deaths. At last the tale was ended and  he fell silent thinking still of Brynhild.    Now came Grimhild bearing him a cup of wine and speaking fair words  of praise, but in the wine she had mingled a fatal witch-drink. So  she stood by Sigurd and said:--      \"There is none of the kings of kingdoms that may match thy goodlihead:    Lo now, thou hast sung of thy fathers; but men shall sing of thee,    And therewith shall our house be remembered, and great shall our glory be.    I beseech thee hearken a little to a faithful word of mine,    When thou of this cup hast drunken; for my love is blent with the wine.\"      He laughed and took the cup: But therein with the blood of the earth    Earth's hidden might was mingled, and deeds of the cold sea's birth,    And things that the high Gods turn from, and a tangle of strange love,    Deep guile and strong compelling, that whoso drank thereof    Should remember not his longing, should cast his love away,    Remembering dead desire but as night remembereth day.      So Sigurd looked on the horn, and he saw how fair it was scored    With the cunning of the Dwarf-kind and the masters of the sword;    And he drank and smiled on Grimhild above the beaker's rim,    And she looked and laughed at his laughter; and the soul was changed in him.    Men gazed and their hearts sank in them, and they knew not why it was,    Why the fair-lit hall was darkling, nor what had come to pass:    For they saw the sorrow of Sigurd, who had seen but his deeds erewhile,    And the face of the mighty darkened, who had known but the light of its         smile.      But Grimhild looked and was merry: and she deemed her life was great,    And her hand a wonder of wonders to withstand the deeds of Fate:    For she saw by the face of Sigurd and the token of his eyes    That her will had abased the valiant, and filled the faithful with lies.           *       *       *       *       *      But the heart was changed in Sigurd; as though it ne'er had been    His love of Brynhild perished as he gazed on the Niblung Queen:    Brynhild's beloved body was e'en as a wasted hearth,    No more for bale or blessing, for plenty or for dearth.    --O ye that shall look hereafter, when the day of Sigurd is done,    And the last of his deeds is accomplished, and his eyes are shut in the sun,    When ye look and long for Sigurd, and the image of Sigurd behold,    And his white sword still as the moon, and his strong hand heavy and cold,    Then perchance shall ye think of this even, then perchance shall ye wonder         and cry,    \"Twice over, King, are we smitten, and twice have we seen thee die.\"           *       *       *       *       *      Men say that a little after the evil of that night    All waste is the burg of Brynhild, and there springeth a marvellous light    On the desert hard by Lymdale, and few men know for why;    But there are, who say that a wildfire thence roareth up to the sky    Round a glorious golden dwelling, wherein there sitteth a Queen    In remembrance of the wakening, and the slumber that hath been;    Wherein a Maid there sitteth, who knows not hope nor rest    For remembrance of the Mighty, and the Best come forth from the Best.    Now after Sigurd took the witch-drink came a great hush upon the  feast-hall for a space. But Grimhild was fain of that hour and cried  to the scalds for music, and they hastened to strike the harp, but no  joy mingled with the sounds and no man was moved to singing.    No word spake Sigurd till the feast was over; then he strode out  alone from the hall and the folk fell back before him. So he took a  steed and all that night he rode alone in the deedless dark, and all  the morrow, very heavy at heart yet knowing no cause for grief, and  remembering all things save Brynhild.    At last he came again at sunset to the Niblung gates, and there came  forth Giuki and Grimhild and the Niblung brethren with fair words of  greeting, but in the doorway Gudrun stood and wept. So Sigurd entered  with them, yet he knew that a flood of sorrow had come on his  life-days and that no more might he feel the joy he had known  aforetime in the Niblung hall. Howbeit, when he looked on the people  and saw them in fear at his trouble, the kindness of his heart was  kindled, and thrusting the heavy sorrow aside, he lifted his head and  spake wise words of good cheer so that the folk looking on him were  comforted.      _Of the Wedding of Sigurd the Volsung._    But Gudrun knew Sigurd's heart and was sorrowful because of his grief  and her great love for him, and when Grimhild bade her carry him wine,  she arose and took the cup but could find no word to speak for  anguish. And Sigurd looking on her face saw there a kindness and a  sorrow like his own, and seeing it he knew that she loved him. Then  pity and love for her rose in his heart and comforted him, and he  took the cup from her and spake, saying:--      \"Here are glad men about us, and a joyous folk of war,    And they that have loved thee for long, and they that have cherished mine         heart;    But we twain alone are woeful, as sad folk sitting apart.    Ah, if I thy soul might gladden! if thy lips might give me peace!    Then belike were we gladdest of all; for I love thee more than these.    The cup of goodwill that thou bearest, and the greeting thou wouldst say,    Turn these to the cup of thy love, and the words of the troth-plighting day;    The love that endureth for ever, and the never-dying troth,    To face the Norns' undoing, and the Gods amid their wrath.\"           *       *       *       *       *      And his clear voice saith:                             \"O Gudrun, now hearken while I swear    That the sun shall die for ever and the day no more be fair,    Ere I forget thy pity and thine inmost heart of love!    Yea, though the Kings be mighty, and the Gods be great above,    I will wade the flood and the fire, and the waste of war forlorn,    To look on the Niblung dwelling, and the house where thou wert born.\"      Strange seemed the words to Sigurd that his gathering love compelled,    And sweet and strange desire o'er his tangled trouble welled.      But bright flashed the eyes of Gudrun, and she said: \"King, as for me,    If thou sawest the heart in my bosom, what oath might better thee?    Yet my words thy words shall cherish, as thy lips my lips have done.    --Herewith I swear, O Sigurd, that the earth shall hate the sun,    And the year desire but darkness, and the blossoms shrink from day,    Ere my love shall fail, beloved, or my longing pass away!\"    So they twain went hand in hand to stand before Giuki and Grimhild  and the swart-haired Niblung brethren, and all these were  glad-hearted when they marked their joy and goodlihead. Then Sigurd  spake noble words of thanks to Giuki for all past kindness, and bade"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13493"],[0,"The American Frugal Housewife (#18)"],[1,"      *       *      FURNITURE.    The prevailing evil of the present day is extravagance. I know very  well that the old are too prone to preach about modern degeneracy,  whether they have cause or not; but, laugh as we may at the sage  advice of our fathers, it is too plain that our present expensive  habits are productive of much domestic unhappiness, and injurious  to public prosperity. Our wealthy people copy all the foolish and  extravagant caprice of European fashion, without considering that we  have not their laws of inheritance among us; and that our frequent  changes of policy render property far more precarious here than in the  old world. However, it is not to the rich I would speak. They have an  undoubted right to spend their thousands as they please; and if they  spend them ridiculously, it is consoling to reflect that they must,  in some way or other, benefit the poorer classes. People of moderate  fortunes have likewise an unquestioned right to dispose of their  hundreds as they please; but I would ask, Is it _wise_ to risk your  happiness in a foolish attempt to keep up with the opulent? Of what  _use_ is the effort which takes so much of your time, and _all_ of  your income? Nay, if any unexpected change in affairs should deprive  you of a few yearly hundreds, you will find your expenses have  _exceeded_ your income; thus the foundation of an accumulating debt  will be laid, and your family will have formed habits but poorly  calculated to save you from the threatened ruin. Not one valuable  friend will be gained by living beyond your means, and old age will be  left to comparative, if not to utter poverty.    There is nothing in which the extravagance of the present day strikes  me so forcibly as the manner in which our young people of moderate  fortune furnish their houses.    A few weeks since, I called upon a farmer's daughter, who had lately  married a young physician of moderate talents, and destitute of  fortune. Her father had given her, at her marriage, all he ever  expected to give her: viz. two thousand dollars. Yet the lower part of  her house was furnished with as much splendor as we usually find among  the wealthiest. The whole two thousand had been expended upon Brussels  carpets, alabaster vases, mahogany chairs, and marble tables. I  afterwards learned that the more useful household utensils had been  forgotten; and that, a few weeks after her wedding, she was actually  obliged to apply to her husband for money to purchase baskets, iron  spoons, clothes-lines, &c.; and her husband, made irritable by the  want of money, pettishly demanded why she had bought so many things  they did not want. Did the doctor gain any patients, or she a single  friend, by offering their visiters water in richly-cut glass tumblers,  or serving them with costly damask napkins, instead of plain soft  towels? No; their foolish vanity made them less happy, and no more  respectable.    Had the young lady been content with Kidderminster carpets, and  tasteful vases of her own making, she might have put _one_ thousand  dollars at interest; and had she obtained six per cent., it would have  clothed her as well as the wife of any man, who depends merely upon  his own industry, ought to be clothed. This would have saved much  domestic disquiet; for, after all, human nature is human nature; and a  wife is never better beloved, because she teases for money.           *       *       *       *       *        EDUCATION OF DAUGHTERS.    There is no subject so much connected with individual happiness and  national prosperity as the education of daughters. It is a true, and  therefore an old remark, that the situation and prospects of a country  may be justly estimated by the character of its women; and we all  know how hard it is to engraft upon a woman's character habits and  principles to which she was unaccustomed in her girlish days. It is  always extremely difficult, and sometimes utterly impossible. Is the  present education of young ladies likely to contribute to their own  ultimate happiness, or to the welfare of the country? There are many  honorable exceptions; but we do think the general tone of female  education is bad. The greatest and most universal error is, teaching  girls to exaggerate the importance of getting married; and of course  to place an undue importance upon the polite attentions of gentlemen.  It was but a few days since, I heard a pretty and sensible girl say,  'Did you ever see a man so ridiculously fond of his daughters as Mr.  ----? He is all the time with them. The other night, at the party,  I went and took Anna away by mere force; for I knew she must feel  dreadfully to have her father waiting upon her all the time, while the  other girls were talking with the beaux.' And another young friend of  mine said, with an air most laughably serious, 'I don't think Harriet  and Julia enjoyed themselves at all last night. Don't you think,  nobody but their _brother_ offered to hand them to the supper-room?'    That a mother should wish to see her daughters happily married, is  natural and proper; that a young lady should be pleased with polite  attentions is likewise natural and innocent; but this undue anxiety,  this foolish excitement about showing off the attentions of somebody,  no matter whom, is attended with consequences seriously injurious. It  promotes envy and rivalship; it leads our young girls to spend their  time between the public streets, the ball room, and the toilet; and,  worst of all, it leads them to contract engagements, without any  knowledge of their own hearts, merely for the sake of being married as  soon as their companions. When married, they find themselves ignorant  of the important duties of domestic life; and its quiet pleasures  soon grow tiresome to minds worn out by frivolous excitements. If they  remain unmarried, their disappointment and discontent are, of course,  in proportion to their exaggerated idea of the eclat attendant upon  having a lover. The evil increases in a startling ratio; for these  girls, so injudiciously educated, will, nine times out of ten,  make injudicious mothers, aunts, and friends; thus follies will be  accumulated unto the third and fourth generation. Young ladies should  be taught that usefulness is happiness, and that all other things are  but incidental. With regard to matrimonial speculations, they should  be taught nothing! Leave the affections to nature and to truth, and  all will end well. How many can I at this moment recollect, who have  made themselves unhappy by marrying for the sake of the _name_ of  being married! How many do I know, who have been instructed to such  watchfulness in the game, that they have lost it by trumping their own  tricks!    One great cause of the vanity, extravagance and idleness that are  so fast growing upon our young ladies, is the absence of _domestic  education_. By domestic education, I do not mean the sending daughters  into the kitchen some half dozen times, to weary the patience of the  cook, and to boast of it the next day in the parlor. I mean two  or three years spent with a mother, assisting her in her duties,  instructing brothers and sisters, and taking care of their own  clothes. This is the way to make them happy, as well as good wives;  for, being early accustomed to the duties of life, they will sit  lightly as well as gracefully upon them.    But what time do modern girls have for the formation of quiet,  domestic habits? Until sixteen they go to school; sometimes these  years are judiciously spent, and sometimes they are half wasted;  too often they are spent in acquiring the _elements_ of a thousand  sciences, without being thoroughly acquainted with any; or in a  variety of accomplishments of very doubtful value to people of  moderate fortune. As soon as they leave school, (and sometimes  before,) they begin a round of balls and parties, and staying with  gay young friends. Dress and flattery take up all their thoughts. What  time have they to learn to be useful? What time have they to cultivate  the still and gentle affections, which must, in every situation  of life, have such an important effect on a woman's character and  happiness?    As far as parents can judge what will be a daughter's station,  education should be adapted to it; but it is well to remember that it  is always easy to know how to spend riches, and always safe to know  how to bear poverty.    A superficial acquaintance with such accomplishments as music and  drawing is useless and undesirable. They should not be attempted  unless there is taste, talent, and time enough to attain excellence. I  have frequently heard young women of moderate fortune say, 'I have not  opened my piano these five years. I wish I had the money expended upon  it. If I had employed as much time in learning useful things, I should  have been better fitted for the cares of my family.'    By these remarks I do not mean to discourage an attention to  the graces of life. Gentility and taste are always lovely in all  situations. But good things, carried to excess, are often productive  of bad consequences. When accomplishments and dress interfere with  the duties and permanent happiness of life, they are unjustifiable and  displeasing; but where there is a solid foundation in mind and heart,  all those elegancies are but becoming ornaments.    Some are likely to have more use for them than others; and they are  justified in spending more time and money upon them. But no one should  be taught to consider them valuable for mere parade and attraction.  Making the education of girls such a series of 'man-traps,' makes the  whole system unhealthy, by poisoning the motive.           *       *       *       *       *    In tracing evils of any kind, which exist in society, we must,  after all, be brought up against the great cause of all  mischief--_mismanagement in education_; and this remark applies  with peculiar force to the"]]]
