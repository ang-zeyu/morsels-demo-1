If you like it, Mr. Crockett, you an' me an' Ned, here, will  dismount, slip forward an' see what's the trouble. Obed will take  Command of the others, an' wait in the bushes till we come back with the  news, whatever it is.\"    \"I'll go with you gladly,\" said Davy Crockett. \"I'm not lookin' for  trouble with a microscope, but if trouble gets right in my path I'm not  dodgin' it. So I say once more, lead on, noble Mr. Panther, an' if Betsy  here must talk she'll talk.\"    The Panther grinned in the dusk. He and Davy Crockett had instantly  recognized congenial souls, each in the other.    \"I can't promise you that thar'll be rippin' an' t'arin' an' roarin' an'  chawin' all the time,\" he said, \"but between you an' me, Davy Crockett,  I've an' idee that we're not goin' to any sort of prayer meetin' this  time of night.\"    \"No, I'm thinkin' not,\" said Crockett, \"but if there is a scene of  turbulence before us lead on. I'm prepared for my share in it. The  debate may be lively, but I've no doubt that I'll get my chance to  speak. There are many ways to attract the attention of the Speaker.  Pardon me, Mr. Panther, but I fall naturally into the phrases of  legislative halls.\"    \"I remember that you served two terms in Congress at Washington,\" said  the Panther.    \"An' I'd be there yet if it wasn't for Andy Jackson. I wanted my way in  Tennessee politics an' he wanted his. He was so stubborn an' headstrong  that here I am ready to become a statesman in this new Texas which is  fightin' for its independence. An' what a change! From marble halls in  Washington to a night in the brush on the frontier, an' with an unknown  enemy before you.\"    They stopped talking now and, kneeling down in a thicket, began to creep  forward. The cabin was not more than four or five hundred yards away,  but a long silence had succeeded the latest shots, and after an advance  of thirty or forty yards they lay still for a while. Then they heard two  shots ahead of them, and saw little pink dots of flame from the  exploding gunpowder.    \"It cannot be Mexicans who are besieging the cabin,\" said Ned. \"They  would shout or make some kind of a noise. We have not heard a thing but  the rifle shots.\"    \"Your argyment is good,\" whispered the Panther. \"Look! Did you see that  figure passin' between us an' the cabin?\"    \"I saw it,\" said Davy Crockett, \"an' although it was but a glimpse an'  this is night it did not seem to me to be clad in full Christian  raiment. I am quite sure it is not the kind of costume that would be  admitted to the galleries of Congress.\"    \"You're right, doubly right,\" said the Panther. \"That was an Injun you  saw, but whether a Comanche or a Lipan I couldn't tell. The boys are  besieged not by Mexicans, but by Injuns. Hark to that!\"    There was a flash from the cabin, a dusky figure in the woods leaped  into the air, uttered a death cry, fell and lay still.    \"An', as you see,\" continued the Panther, in his whisper, \"the boys in  the house are not asleep, dreamin' beautiful dreams. Looks to me as if  they was watchin' mighty sharp for them fellers who have broke up their  rest.\"    Crack! went a second shot from the house, but there was no answering  cry, and they could not tell whether it hit anything. But they soon saw  more dark figures flitting through the bushes, and their own position  grew very precarious. If a band of the Indians stumbled upon them they  might be annihilated before they gave their besieged comrades any help.    \"I make the motion, Mr. Panther,\" said Crockett, \"that you form a speedy  plan of action for us, an' I trust that our young friend Ned here will  second it.\"    \"I second the motion,\" said Ned.    \"It is carried unanimously. Now, Mr. Panther, we await your will.\"    \"It's my will that we git back to the rest of the men as soon as we can.  I reckon, Mr. Crockett, that them Tennesseans of yours wouldn't head in  the other direction if a fight grew hot.\"    \"I reckon that wild horses couldn't drag 'em away,\" said Crockett dryly.    \"Then we'll go back an' j'in 'em.\"    \"To hold a caucus, so to speak.\"    \"I don't know what a cow-cuss is.\"    \"It's Congressional for a conference. Don't mind these parliamentary  expressions of mine, Mr. Panther. They give me pleasure an' they hurt  nobody.\"    They reached the Tennesseans without interruption, and the Panther  quickly laid his plan before them. They would advance within a quarter  of a mile of the cabin, tie their horses in the thickest of the brush,  leave four men to guard them, then the rest would go forward to help the  besieged.    Crockett's eyes twinkled when the Panther announced the campaign in a  few words.    \"Very good; very good,\" he said. \"A steering committee could not have  done better. That also is parliamentary, but I think you understand it.\"    They heard detached shots again and then a long yell.    \"They're Comanches,\" said the Panther. \"I know their cry, an' I guess  there's a lot of them.\"    Ned hoped that the shout did not mean the achieving of some triumph.  They reached presently a dense growth of brush, and there the horses  were tied. Four reluctant Tennesseans remained with them and the rest  crept forward. They did not hear any shot after they left the horses  until they were within three hundred yards of the house. Then an  apparition caused all to stop simultaneously.    A streak of flame shot above the trees, curved and fell. It was followed  by another and another. Ned was puzzled, but the Panther laughed low.    \"This can't be fireworks on election night,\" said Davy Crockett. \"It  seems hardly the place for such a display.\"    \"They're fireworks, all right,\" said the Panther, \"but it's not election  night. You're correct about that part of it. Look, there goes the fourth  an' the fifth.\"    Two more streaks of flame curved and fell, and Ned and Crockett were  still puzzled.    \"Them's burnin' arrers,\" said the Panther. \"It's an old trick of the  Injuns. If they had time enough they'd be sure to set the cabin on fire,  and then from ambush they'd shoot the people as they ran out. But what  we're here for is to stop that little game of theirs. The flight of the  arrers enables us to locate the spot from which they come an' there  we'll find the Comanches.\"    They crept toward the point from which the lighted arrows were flying,  and peering; from the thicket saw a score or more of Comanches gathered  in the bushes and under the trees. One of the Tennesseans, seeking a  better position, caused a loud rustling, and the alert Comanches,  instantly taking alarm, turned their attention to the point from which  the sound had come.    \"Fire, boys! Fire at once!\" cried the Panther.    A deadly volley was poured into the Comanche band. The Indians replied,  but were soon compelled to give way. The Panther, raising his voice,  shouted in tremendous tones:    \"Rescue! Rescue! We're here, boys!\"    The defenders of the cabin, hearing the volleys and the shouts of their  friends, opened the door and rushed out of the cabin, rifle in hand.  Caught between two forces, the Comanches gave up and rushed to the  plain, where they had left their ponies. Jumping upon the backs of  these, they fled like the wind.    The two victorious parties met and shook hands.    \"We're mighty glad to see you, Panther,\" said Fields, grinning. \"You  don't look like an angel, but you act like one, an' I see you've brought  a lot of new angels with you.\"    \"Yes,\" replied the Panther, with some pride in his voice, \"an' the first  of the angels is Davy Crockett. Mr. Crockett, Mr. Fields.\"    The men crowded around to shake hands with the renowned Davy. Meanwhile  a small party brought the four Tennesseans and the horses. Fortunately  the Comanches had fled in the other direction. But it was not all joy in  the Texan camp. Two silent figures covered with serapes were stretched  on the floor in the cabin, and several others had wounds, although they  had borne their part in the fighting.    \"Tell us how it happened,\" said the Panther, after they had set  sentinels in the forest.    \"They attacked us about an hour after dark,\" replied Fields. \"We knew  that no Mexicans were near, but we never thought of Indians raiding  this far to the eastward. Some of the men were outside looking after  jerked meat when they suddenly opened fire from the brush. Two of the  boys, Campbell and Hudson, were hurt so badly that they died after they  were helped into the house by the others. The Comanches tried to rush in  with our own men, but we drove them off and we could have held the cabin  against 'em forever, if they hadn't begun to shoot the burning arrows.  Then you came.\"    Campbell and Hudson were buried. Ned had been welcomed warmly by Allen,  and the two boys compared notes. Will's face glowed when he heard of  Ned's adventures within the Mexican lines.    \"I could never have done it,\" he said. \"I couldn't have kept steady  enough when one crisis after another came along. I suppose this means,  of course, that we must try to meet Santa Anna in some way. What do you  think we can do, Ned?\"    \"I don't know, but just at present I'm going to sleep. The Panther, Davy  Crockett and Obed will debate the plans.\"    Ned, who was becoming inured to war and danger, was soon asleep, but  Will could not close his eyes. He had borne a gallant part in the  defense, and the sounds of rifle shots and Indian yells still resounded  in his excited ear. He remained awake long after he heard the heavy  breathing of the men about him, but exhausted nerves gave way at last  and he, too, slept.    The next morning their news was debated gravely by all. There was not  one among them who did not understand its significance, but it was hard  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15770"],[0,"Germany, The Next Republic? (#18)"],[1,"in Europe and Hungary, even  as late as last December, was not contaminated by Prussian ideas.  I  saw Russian prisoners of war walking through the streets and mingling  with the Hungarian soldiers and people.  American Consul General Coffin  informed me that there were seven thousand Allied subjects in Budapest  who were undisturbed.  English and French are much more popular than  Germans.  One day on my first visit in Budapest I asked a policeman in  front of the Hotel Ritz in German, \"Where is the Reichstag?\"  He shook  his head and went on about his business regulating the traffic at the  street corner.  Then I asked him half in English and half in French  where the Parliament was.    With a broad smile he said: \"Ah, Monsieur, voila, this street your  right, vis a vis.\"  Not a word of German would he speak.    After the Allied offensive began on the Somme the old friends of von  Tirpitz, assisted by Prince von Buelow, started an offensive against  the Chancellor, with renewed vigour.  This time they were determined to  oust him at all costs.  They sent emissaries to the Rhine Valley, which  is dominated by the Krupp ammunition factories.  These emissaries began  by attacking the Chancellor's attitude towards the United States.  They  pointed out that Germany could not possibly win the war unless she  defeated England, and it was easy for any German to see that the only  way England could be attacked was from the seas; that as long as  England had her fleet or her merchant ships she could continue the war  and continue to supply the Allies.  It was pointed out to the  ammunition makers, also, that they were already fighting the United  States; that the United States was sending such enormous supplies to  the Entente, that unless the submarines were used to stop these  supplies Germany would most certainly be defeated on land.  And, it was  explained that a defeat on land meant not only the defeat of the German  army but the defeat of the ammunition interests.    From April to December, 1916, was also the period of pamphleteering.  Every one who could write a pamphlet, or could publish one, did so.  The censorship had prohibited so many people and so many organisations  from expressing their views publicly that they chose this method of  circulating their ideas privately.  The pamphlets could be printed  secretly and distributed through the mails so as to avoid both the  censors and the Government.  So every one in Germany began to receive  documents and pamphlets about all the ails and complaints within  Germany.  About the only people who did not do this were the  Socialists.  The \"Alt-Deutsch Verband,\" which was an organisation of  the great industrial leaders of Germany, had been bitterly attacked by  the Berlin _Tageblatt_ but when the directors wanted to publish their  reply the censors prohibited it.  So, the Alt-Deutsch Verband issued a  pamphlet and sent it broadcast throughout Germany.  In the meantime the  Chancellor and the Government realised that unless something was done  to combat these secret forces which were undermining the Government's  influence, that there would be an eruption in Germany which might  produce serious results.    Throughout this time the Socialist party was having troubles of its  own.  Liebknecht was in prison but there was a little group of radicals  who had not forgotten it.  They wanted the Socialist party as a whole  to do something to free Liebknecht.  The party had been split before  the advance of last summer so efforts were made to unite the two  factions.  At a well attended conference in the Reichstag building they  agreed to forget old differences and join forces in support of the  Government until winter, when it was hoped peace could be made.    The Socialist party at various times during the war has had a difficult  time in agreeing on government measures.  While the Socialists voted  unanimously for war credits at the beginning, a year afterward many of  them had changed their minds and had begun to wonder whether, after  all, they had not made a mistake.  This was the issue which brought  about the first split in the Socialists' ranks.  When it came time in  1916 to vote further credits to the Government the Socialists held a  caucus.  After three days of bitter wrangling the ranks split.  One  group headed by Scheidemann decided to support the Government and  another group with Herr Wolfgang Heine as the leader, decided to vote  against the war loans.    Scheidemann, who is the most capable and most powerful Socialist in  Germany, carried with him the majority of the delegates and was  supported by the greater part of public opinion.  Heine, however, had  the support of men like Dr. Haase and Eduard Bernstein who had  considerable influence with the public but who were not organisers or  men capable of aggressive action, like Scheidemann.  As far as  affecting the Government's plans were concerned the Socialist split did  not amount to much.  In Germany there is such a widespread fear of the  Government and the police that even the most radical Socialists  hesitate to oppose the Government.  In war time Germany is under  complete control of the military authorities and even the Reichstag,  which is supposed to be a legislative body, is in reality during war  times only a closed corporation which does the bidding of the  Government.  The attitude of the Reichstag on any question is not  determined at the party caucuses nor during sessions.  Important  decisions are always arrived at at Great Headquarters between the  Chancellor and the military leaders.  Then the Chancellor returns to  Berlin, summons the party leaders to his palace, explains what the  Government desires and, without asking the leaders for their support,  tells them _that_ is what _von Hindenburg_ expects.  They know there is  no choice left to them.  Scheidemann always attends these conferences  as the Socialist representative because the Chancellor has never  recognised the so-called Socialist Labour Party which is made up of  Socialist radicals who want peace and who have reached the point when  they can no longer support the Government.    One night at the invitation of an editor of one of Berlin's leading  newspapers, who is a Socialist radical, I attended a secret session of  the Socialist Labour Party.  At this meeting there were present three  members of the Reichstag, the President of one of Germany's leading  business organisations, two newspaper editors, one labour agitator who  had been travelling to industrial centres to mobilise the forces which  were opposed to a continuation of the war, and a rather well known  Socialist writer who had been inspiring some anti-Government pamphlets  which were printed in Switzerland and sent by mail to Germany.  One of  the business men present had had an audience of the Kaiser and he  reported what the monarch told him about the possibilities of peace.  The report was rather encouraging to the Socialists because the Kaiser  said he would make peace as soon as there was an opportunity.  But  these Socialists did not have much faith in the Kaiser's promises and  jokingly asked the business man if the Kaiser did not decorate him as a  result of the audience!    The real object of this meeting was to discuss means of acquainting the  German people with the American organisation entitled the League to  Enforce Peace.  An American business man, who was a charter member of  the American organisation, was there to explain the purposes of the  League.  The meeting decided upon the publication in as many German  newspapers as possible of explanatory articles.  The newspaper editor  present promised to prepare them and urged their publication in various  journals.  The first article appeared in _Die Welt Am Montag_, one of  the weekly newspapers of Berlin.  It was copied by a number of  progressive newspapers throughout the Empire but when the attention of  the military and naval authorities was called to this propaganda an  order was issued prohibiting any newspaper from making any reference to  the League to Enforce Peace.  The anti-American editorial writers were  inspired to write brief notices to the effect that the League was in  reality to be a League against Germany supported by England and the  United States.    Throughout the summer and fall there appeared in various newspapers,  including the influential _Frankfurter Zeitung_, inspired articles  about the possibilities of annexing the industrial centres and  important harbours of Belgium.  In Munich and Leipsic a book by Dr.  Schumacher, of Bonn University, was published, entitled, \"Antwerp, Its  World Position and Importance for Germany's Economic Life.\"  Another  writer named Ulrich Bauschey wrote a number of newspaper and magazine  articles for the purpose of showing that Germany would need Antwerp  after this war in order to successfully compete with Holland, England  and France in world commerce.  He figured that the difference between  the cost of transportation from the Rhine Valley industrial cities to  Antwerp and the cost of transportation from the Rhine Valley to Hamburg  and Bremen would be great enough as to enable German products to be  sold in America for less money than products of Germany's enemies.    These articles brought up the old question of the \"freedom of the  seas.\"  Obviously, if the Allies were to control the seas after the  war, as they had during the war, Germany could make no plans for the  re-establishment of her world commerce unless there were some  assurances that her merchant fleet would be as free on the high seas as  that of any other nation.  During the war Germany had talked a great  deal about the freedom of the seas.  When the _Lusitania_ was torpedoed  von Jagow said in an interview that Germany was fighting for the free  seas and that by attacking England's control, Germany was acting in the  interests of the whole world.
