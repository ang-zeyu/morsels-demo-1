In the verse a poetical liberty has been ventured. Lee is not only  represented as responding to the invitation, but also as at last  renouncing his cold reserve, doubtless the cloak to feelings more or  less poignant. If for such freedom warrant be necessary the speeches in  ancient histories, not to speak of those in Shakespeare's historic  plays, may not unfitly perhaps be cited.    The character of the original measures proposed about time in the  National Legislature for the treatment of the (as yet) Congressionally  excluded South, and the spirit in which those measures were  advocated--these are circumstances which it is fairly supposable would  have deeply influenced the thoughts, whether spoken or withheld, of a  Southerner placed in the position of Lee before the Reconstruction  Committee.          Supplement.      Were I fastidiously anxious for the symmetry of this book, it would  close with the notes. But the times are such that patriotism--not free  from solicitude--urges a claim overriding all literary scruples.    It is more than a year since the memorable surrender, but events have  not yet rounded themselves into completion. Not justly can we complain  of this. There has been an upheavel affecting the basis of things; to  altered circumstances complicated adaptations are to be made; there are  difficulties great and novel. But is Reason still waiting for Passion to  spend itself? We have sung of the soldiers and sailors, but who shall  hymn the politicians?    In view of the infinite desirableness of Re-establishment, and  considering that, so far as feeling is concerned, it depends not mainly  on the temper in which the South regards the North, but rather  conversely; one who never was a blind adherent feels constrained to  submit some thoughts, counting on the indulgence of his countrymen.    And, first, it may be said that, if among the feelings and opinions  growing immediately out of a great civil convulsion, there are any which  time shall modify or do away, they are presumably those of a less  temperate and charitable cast.    There seems no reason why patriotism and narrowness should go together,  or why intellectual impartiality should be confounded with political  trimming, or why serviceable truth should keep cloistered by a cause not  partisan. Yet the work of Reconstruction, if admitted to be feasible at  all, demands little but common sense and Christian charity. Little but  these? These are much.    Some of us are concerned because as yet the South shows no penitence.  But what exactly do we mean by this? Since down to the close of the war  she never confessed any for braving it, the only penitence now left her  is that which springs solely from the sense of discomfiture; and since  this evidently would be a contrition hypocritical, it would be unworthy  in us to demand it. Certain it is that penitence, in the sense of  voluntary humiliation, will never be displayed. Nor does this afford  just ground for unreserved condemnation. It is enough, for all practical  purposes, if the South have been taught by the terrors of civil war to  feel that Secession, like Slavery, is against Destiny; that both now lie  buried in one grave; that her fate is linked with ours; and that  together we comprise the Nation.    The clouds of heroes who battled for the Union it is needless to  eulogize here. But how of the soldiers on the other side? And when of a  free community we name the soldiers, we thereby name the people. It was  in subserviency to the slave-interest that Secession was plotted; but it  was under the plea, plausibly urged, that certain inestimable rights  guaranteed by the Constitution were directly menaced, that the people of  the South were cajoled into revolution. Through the arts of the  conspirators and the perversity of fortune, the most sensitive love of  liberty was entrapped into the support of a war whose implied end was  the erecting in our advanced century of an Anglo-American empire based  upon the systematic degradation of man.    Spite this clinging reproach, however, signal military virtues and  achievements have conferred upon the Confederate arms historic fame, and  upon certain of the commanders a renown extending beyond the sea--a  renown which we of the North could not suppress even if we would. In  personal character, also, not a few of the military leaders of the South  enforce forbearance; the memory of others the North refrains from  disparaging; and some, with more or less of reluctance, she can respect.  Posterity, sympathizing with our convictions, but removed from our  passions, may perhaps go farther here. If George IV. could out of the  graceful instinct of a gentleman, raise an honorable monument in the  great fane of Christendom over the remains of the enemy of his dynasty,  Charles Edward, the invader of England and victor in the rout at Preston  Pans--Upon whose head the king's ancestor but one reign removed has set  a price--is it probable that the grandchildren of General Grant will  pursue with rancor, or slur by sour neglect, the memory of Stonewall  Jackson?    But the South herself is not wanting in recent histories and biographies  which record the deeds of her chieftains--writings freely published at  the North by loyal houses, widely read here, and with a deep though  saddened interest. By students of the war such works are hailed as  welcome accessories, and tending to the completeness of the record.    Supposing a happy issue out of present perplexities, then, in the  generation next to come, Southerners there will be yielding allegiance  to the Union, feeling all their interests bound up in it, and yet  cherishing unrebuked that kind of feeling for the memory of the soldiers  of the fallen Confederacy that Burns, Scott, and the Ettrick Shepherd  felt for the memory of the gallant clansmen ruined through their  fidelity to the Stuarts--a feeling whose passion was tempered by the  poetry imbuing it, and which in no wise affected their loyalty to the  Georges, and which, it may be added, indirectly contributed excellent  things to literature. But, setting this view aside, dishonorable would  it be in the South were she willing to abandon to shame the memory of  brave men who with signal personal disinterestedness warred in her  behalf, though from motives, as we believe, so deplorably astray.    Patriotism is not baseness, neither is it inhumanity. The mourners who  this summer bear flowers to the mounds of the Virginian and Georgian  dead are, in their domestic bereavement and proud affection, as sacred  in the eye of Heaven as are those who go with similar offerings of  tender grief and love into the cemeteries of our Northern martyrs. And  yet, in one aspect, how needless to point the contrast.    Cherishing such sentiments, it will hardly occasion surprise that, in  looking over the battle-pieces in the foregoing collection, I have been  tempted to withdraw or modify some of them, fearful lest in presenting,  though but dramatically and by way of a poetic record, the passions and  epithets of civil war, I might be contributing to a bitterness which  every sensible American must wish at an end. So, too, with the emotion  of victory as reproduced on some pages, and particularly toward the  close. It should not be construed into an exultation misapplied--an  exultation as ungenerous as unwise, and made to minister, however  indirectly, to that kind of censoriousness too apt to be produced in  certain natures by success after trying reverses. Zeal is not of  necessity religion, neither is it always of the same essence with poetry  or patriotism.    There were excesses which marked the conflict, most of which are perhaps  inseparable from a civil strife so intense and prolonged, and involving  warfare in some border countries new and imperfectly civilized.  Barbarities also there were, for which the Southern people collectively  can hardly be held responsible, though perpetrated by ruffians in their  name. But surely other qualities--exalted ones--courage and fortitude  matchless, were likewise displayed, and largely; and justly may these be  held the characteristic traits, and not the former.    In this view, what Northern writer, however patriotic, but must revolt  from acting on paper a part any way akin to that of the live dog to the  dead lion; and yet it is right to rejoice for our triumph, so far as it  may justly imply an advance for our whole country and for humanity.    Let it be held no reproach to any one that he pleads for reasonable  consideration for our late enemies, now stricken down and unavoidably  debarred, for the time, from speaking through authorized agencies for  themselves. Nothing has been urged here in the foolish hope of  conciliating those men--few in number, we trust--who have resolved never  to be reconciled to the Union. On such hearts every thing is thrown away  except it be religious commiseration, and the sincerest. Yet let them  call to mind that unhappy Secessionist, not a military man, who with  impious alacrity fired the first shot of the Civil War at Sumter, and a  little more than four years afterward fired the last one into his own  heart at Richmond.    Noble was the gesture into which patriotic passion surprised the people  in a utilitarian time and country; yet the glory of the war falls short  of its pathos--a pathos which now at last ought to disarm all animosity.    How many and earnest thoughts still rise, and how hard to repress them.  We feel what past years have been, and years, unretarded years, shall  come. May we all have moderation; may we all show candor. Though,  perhaps, nothing could ultimately have averted the strife, and though to  treat "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1239"],[0,"The Spirit of the Border: A Romance of the Early Settlers in the Ohio Valley (#18)"],[1,"ols?\"    \"We have been years getting them here. Some came by way of the Ohio  River; others overland from Detroit. That anvil has a history. It  was lost once, and lay for years in the woods, until some Indians  found it again. It is called the Ringing Stone, and Indians come  from miles around to see and hear it.\"    The missionary pointed out wide fields of corn, now growing yellow,  and hillsides doted with browsing cattle, droves of sturdy-limbed  horses, and pens of fat, grunting pigs--all of which attested to the  growing prosperity of the Village of Peace.    On the way back to the cabin, while the others listened to and  questioned Mr. Zeisberger, Jim was silent and thoughtful, for his  thoughts reverted to his brother.    Later, as he walked with Nell by the golden-fringed stream, he spoke  of Joe.    \"Joe wanted so much to hunt with Wetzel. He will come back; surely  he will return to us when he has satisfied his wild craving for  adventure. Do you not think so?\"    There was an eagerness that was almost pleading in Jim's voice. What  he so much hoped for--that no harm had befallen Joe, and that he  would return--he doubted. He needed the encouragement of his hope.    \"Never,\" answered Nell, solemnly.    \"Oh, why--why do you say that?\"    \"I saw him look at you--a strange, intent glance. He gazed long at  me as we separated. Oh! I can feel his eyes. No; he will never come  back.\"    \"Nell, Nell, you do not mean he went away deliberately--because, oh!  I cannot say it.\"    \"For no reason, except that the wilderness called him more than love  for you or--me.\"    \"No, no,\" returned Jim, his face white. \"You do not understand. He  really loved you--I know it. He loved me, too. Ah, how well! He has  gone because--I can't tell you.\"    \"Oh, Jim, I hope--he loved--me,\" sobbed Nell, bursting into tears.  \"His coldness--his neglect those--last few days--hurt me--so. If he  cared--as you say--I won't be--so--miserable.\"    \"We are both right--you when you say he will never return, and I  when I say he loved us both,\" said Jim sadly, as the bitter  certainty forced itself into his mind.    As she sobbed softly, and he gazed with set, stern face into the  darkening forest, the deep, mellow notes of the church bell pealed  out. So thrilled, so startled were they by this melody wondrously  breaking the twilight stillness, that they gazed mutely at each  other. Then they remembered. It was the missionary's bell summoning  the Christian Indians to the evening service.        Chapter XI.    The, sultry, drowsy, summer days passed with no untoward event to  mar their slumbering tranquillity. Life for the newcomers to the  Village of Peace brought a content, the like of which they had never  dreamed of. Mr. Wells at once began active work among the Indians,  preaching to them through an interpreter; Nell and Kate, in hours  apart from household duties, busied themselves brightening their new  abode, and Jim entered upon the task of acquainting himself with the  modes and habits of the redmen. Truly, the young people might have  found perfect happiness in this new and novel life, if only Joe had  returned. His disappearance and subsequent absence furnished a theme  for many talks and many a quiet hour of dreamy sadness. The  fascination of his personality had been so impelling that long after  it was withdrawn a charm lingered around everything which reminded  them of him; a subtle and sweet memory, with perverse and half  bitter persistence, returned hauntingly. No trace of Joe had been  seen by any of the friendly Indian runners. He was gone into the  mazes of deep-shadowed forests, where to hunt for him would be like  striving to trail the flight of a swallow. Two of those he had left  behind always remembered him, and in their thoughts followed him in  his wanderings.    Jim settled down to his study of Indians with single-heartedness of  purpose. He spent part of every morning with the interpreters, with  whose assistance he rapidly acquired the Delaware language. He went  freely among the Indians, endeavoring to win their good-will. There  were always fifty to an hundred visiting Indians at the village;  sometimes, when the missionaries had advertised a special meeting,  there were assembled in the shady maple grove as many as five  hundred savages. Jim had, therefore, opportunities to practice his  offices of friendliness.    Fortunately for him, he at once succeeded in establishing himself in  the good graces of Glickhican, the converted Delaware chief. The  wise old Indian was of inestimable value to Jim. Early in their  acquaintance he evinced an earnest regard for the young minister,  and talked with him for hours.    From Glickhican Jim learned the real nature of the redmen. The  Indian's love of freedom and honor, his hatred of subjection and  deceit, as explained by the good old man, recalled to Jim Colonel  Zane's estimate of the savage character. Surely, as the colonel had  said, the Indians had reason for their hatred of the pioneers.  Truly, they were a blighted race.    Seldom had the rights of the redmen been thought of. The settler  pushed onward, plodding, as it were, behind his plow with a rifle.  He regarded the Indian as little better than a beast; he was easier  to kill than to tame. How little the settler knew the proud  independence, the wisdom, the stainless chastity of honor, which  belonged so truly to many Indian chiefs!    The redmen were driven like hounded deer into the untrodden wilds.  From freemen of the forests, from owners of the great boundless  plains, they passed to stern, enduring fugitives on their own lands.  Small wonder that they became cruel where once they had been gentle!  Stratagem and cunning, the night assault, the daylight ambush took  the place of their one-time open warfare. Their chivalrous courage,  that sublime inheritance from ancestors who had never known the  paleface foe, degenerated into a savage ferocity.    Interesting as was this history to Jim, he cared more for  Glickhican's rich portrayal of the redmen's domestic life, for the  beautiful poetry of his tradition and legends. He heard with delight  the exquisite fanciful Indian lore. From these romantic legends,  beautiful poems, and marvelous myths he hoped to get ideas of the  Indian's religion. Sweet and simple as childless dreams were these  quaint tales--tales of how the woodland fairies dwelt in  fern-carpeted dells; how at sunrise they came out to kiss open the  flowers; how the forest walks were spirit-haunted paths; how the  leaves whispered poetry to the winds; how the rocks harbored Indian  gods and masters who watched over their chosen ones.    Glickhican wound up his long discourses by declaring he had never  lied in the whole course of his seventy years, had never stolen,  never betrayed, never murdered, never killed, save in self-defence.  Gazing at the chief's fine features, now calm, yet showing traces of  past storms, Jim believed he spoke the truth.    When the young minister came, however, to study the hostile Indians  that flocked to the village, any conclusive delineation of  character, or any satisfactory analysis of their mental state in  regard to the paleface religion, eluded him. Their passive, silent,  sphinx-like secretiveness was baffling. Glickhican had taught him  how to propitiate the friendly braves, and with these he was  successful. Little he learned, however, from the unfriendly ones.  When making gifts to these redmen he could never be certain that his  offerings were appreciated. The jewels and gold he had brought west  with him went to the French traders, who in exchange gave him  trinkets, baubles, bracelets and weapons. Jim made hundreds of  presents. Boldly going up to befeathered and befringed chieftains,  he offered them knives, hatchets, or strings of silvery beads.  Sometimes his kindly offerings were repelled with a haughty stare;  at other times they would be accepted coldly, suspiciously, as if  the gifts brought some unknown obligation.    For a white man it was a never-to-be-forgotten experience to see  eight or ten of these grim, slowly stepping forest kings, arrayed in  all the rich splendor of their costume, stalking among the teepees  of the Village of Peace. Somehow, such a procession always made Jim  shiver. The singing, praying and preaching they heard unmoved. No  emotion was visible on their bronzed faces; nothing changed their  unalterable mien. Had they not moved, or gazed with burning eyes,  they would have been statues. When these chieftains looked at the  converted Indians, some of whom were braves of their nations, the  contempt in their glances betrayed that they now regarded these  Christian Indians as belonging to an alien race.    Among the chiefs Glickhican pointed out to Jim were Wingenund, the  Delaware; Tellane, the Half-King; Shingiss and Kotoxen--all of the  Wolf tribe of the Delawares.    Glickhican was careful to explain that the Delaware nation had been  divided into the Wolf and Turtle tribes, the former warlike people,  and the latter peaceable. Few of the Wolf tribe had gone over to the  new faith, and those who had were scorned. Wingenund, the great  power of the Delawares--indeed, the greatest of all the western  tribes--maintained a neutral attitude toward the Village of Peace.  But it was well known that his right-hand war-chiefs, Pipe and  Wishtonah, remained coldly opposed.    Jim turned all he had learned over and over in his mind, trying to  construct part of it to fit into a sermon that would be different  from any the Indians had ever heard. He did not want to preach far  over their heads. If possible, he desired to keep to their  ideals--for he deemed them more beautiful than his own--and to  conduct his teaching along the simple lines of their belief, so that  when he stimulated and developed their minds he could pass from what  they knew to the unknown Christianity of the white man.    His first address to "]]]
