Another method of bracing limbs together consists in running a      single bolt through them and fastening each end of the bolt with a      washer and nut. This method is preferable to the first because it      allows for the growth of the limbs in thickness.    [Illustration: FIG. 121.--Diagram Showing the Triple-bar Method of  Fastening Limbs.]        A still better method, however, consists in using a bar composed of      three parts as shown in Fig. 121. Each of the two branches has a      short bolt passed through it horizontally, and the two short bolts      are then connected by a third bar. This arrangement will shift all      the pressure caused by the swaying of the limbs to the middle      connecting-bar. In case of a windstorm, the middle bar will be the      one to bend, while the bolts which pass through the limbs will      remain intact. The outer ends of the short bolts should have their      washers and nuts slightly embedded in the wood of the tree, so that      the living tissue of the tree may eventually grow over them in such      a way as to hold the bars firmly in place and to exclude moisture      and disease. The washers and nuts on the inner side of the limbs      should also be embedded.        A chain is sometimes advantageously substituted for the middle      section of the bar and, in some cases, where more than two branches      have to be joined together, a ring might take the place of the      middle bar or chain.        Bolts on a tree detract considerably from its natural beauty and      should, therefore, be used only where they are absolutely necessary      for the safety of the tree. They should be placed as high up in the      tree as possible without weakening the limbs.          CHAPTER VII    FORESTRY        STUDY I. WHAT FORESTRY IS AND WHAT IT DOES    Although Forestry is not a new idea but, as a science and an art, has  been applied for nearly two thousand years, there are many persons who  still need an explanation of its aims and principles.    Forestry deals with the establishment, protection and utilization of  forests.    By establishment, is meant the planting of new forests and the cutting  of mature forests, in such a way as to encourage a natural growth of new  trees without artificial planting or seeding. The planting may consist  of sowing seed, or of setting out young trees. The establishment of a  forest by cutting may consist of the removal of all mature trees and  dependence upon the remaining stumps to reproduce the forest from  sprouts, or it may consist of the removal of only a portion of the  mature trees, thus giving the young seedlings on the ground room in  which to grow.    By protection, is meant the safeguarding of the forest from fire, wind,  insects, disease and injury for which man is directly responsible. Here,  the forester also prevents injury to the trees from the grazing and  browsing of sheep and goats, and keeps his forest so well stocked that  no wind can uproot the trees nor can the sun dry up the moist forest  soil.    [Illustration: FIG. 122.--A Forest of Bull Pine Cut on Forestry  Principles. (Photograph taken on the Black Hills National Forest, South  Dakota.)]    By utilization, is meant the conservative and intelligent harvesting of  the forest, with the aim of obtaining the greatest amount of product  from a given area, with the least waste, in the quickest time, and  without the slightest deterioration of the forest as a whole. The  forester cuts his mature trees, only, and generally leaves a sufficient  number on the ground to preserve the forest soil and to cast seed for  the production of a new crop. In this way, he secures an annual output  without hurting the forest itself. He studies the properties and values  of the different woods and places them where they will be most useful.  He lays down principles for so harvesting the timber and the  by-products of the forest that there will be the least waste and injury  to the trees which remain standing. He utilizes the forest, but does not  cut enough to interfere with the neighboring water-sheds, which the  forests protect.    [Illustration: 123.--A White Pine Plantation, in Rhode Island, Where the  Crowns of the Trees Have Met. The trees are fifteen years old and in  many cases every other tree had to be removed.]    Forestry, therefore, deals with a vast and varied mass of information,  comprising all the known facts relating to the life of a forest. It does  not deal with the individual tree and its planting and care,--that would  be arboriculture. Nor does it consider the grouping of trees for  aesthetic effect,--that would be landscape gardening. It concerns itself  with the forest as a community of trees and with the utilization of the  forest on an economic basis.    Each one of these activities in Forestry is a study in itself and  involves considerable detail, of which the reader may obtain a general  knowledge in the following pages. For a more complete discussion, the  reader is referred to any of the standard books on Forestry.    The life and nature of a forest: When we think of a forest we are apt to      think of a large number of individual trees having no special      relationship to each other. Closer observation, however, will reveal      that the forest consists of a distinct group of trees, sufficiently      dense to form an unbroken canopy of tops, and that, where trees grow      so closely together, they become very interdependent. It is this      interdependence that makes the forest different from a mere group of      trees in a park or on a lawn. In this composite character, the      forest enriches its own soil from year to year, changes the climate      within its own bounds, controls the streams along its borders and      supports a multitude of animals and plants peculiar to itself. This      communal relationship in the life history of the forest furnishes a      most interesting story of struggle and mutual aid. Different trees      have different requirements with regard to water, food and light.      Some need more water and food than others, some will not endure much      shade, and others will grow in the deepest shade. In the open, a      tree, if once established, can meet its needs quite readily and,      though it has to ward off a number of enemies, insects, disease and      windstorm--its struggle for existence is comparatively easy. In the      forest, the conditions are different. Here, the tree-enemies have to      be battled with, just as in the open, and in addition, instead of      there being only a few trees on a plot of ground, there are      thousands growing on the same area, all demanding the same things      out of a limited supply. The struggle for existence, therefore,      becomes keen, many falling behind and but few surviving.    [Illustration: FIG. 124.--Measuring the Diameter of a Tree and Counting  its Annual Rings.]        This struggle begins with the seed. At first there are thousands of      seeds cast upon a given area by the neighboring trees or by the      birds and the winds. Of these, only a few germinate; animals feed on      some of them, frost nips some and excessive moisture and unfavorable      soil conditions prevent others from starting. The few successful      ones soon sprout into a number of young trees that grow thriftily      until their crowns begin to meet. When the trees have thus met, the      struggle is at its height. The side branches encroach upon each      other (Fig. 123), shut out the light without which the branches      cannot live, and finally kill each other off. The upper branches vie      with one another for light, grow unusually fast, and the trees      increase in height with special rapidity. This is nature's method of      producing clear, straight trunks which are so desirable for poles      and large timber. In this struggle for dominance, some survive and      tower above the others, but many become stunted and fail to grow,      while the majority become entirely overtopped and succumb in the      struggle; see Fig. 139.        But in this strife there is also mutual aid. Each tree helps to      protect its neighbors against the danger of being uprooted by the      wind, and against the sun, which is liable to dry up the rich soil      around the roots. This soil is different from the soil on the open      lawn. It consists of an accumulation of decayed leaves mixed with      inorganic matter, forming, together, a rich composition known as      _humus_. The trees also aid each other in forming a close canopy      that prevents the rapid evaporation of water from the ground.        The intensity of these conditions will vary a great deal with the      composition of the forest and the nature and habits of the      individual trees. By composition, or type of forest, is meant the      proportion in which the various species of trees are grouped; i.e.,      whether a certain section of woodland is composed of one species or      of a mixture of species. By habit is meant the requirements of the      trees for light, water and food.    [Illustration: FIG. 125.--Mountain Slopes in North Carolina Well Covered  with Forests.]        Some trees will grow in deep shade while others will demand the      open. In the matter of water and food, the individual requirements      of different trees are equally marked.        The natural rapidity of growth of different species is also      important, and one caring for a forest must know this rate of      growth, not only as to the individual species, but also with respect      to the forest as a whole. If he knows how fast the trees in a      forest grow, both in height and diameter, he will know how much      wood, in cubic feet, the forest produces in a year, and he can"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16119"],[0,"Doctrina Christiana (#18)"],[1,"resident  of the Philippines--quite contrary to the derivation of the word--or  a Chinese of partially native blood.

[110] Schilling, p. 210, says that in his letter Cobo himself  recorded that \"Benavides wrote the first Chinese catechism in the  Philippines.\" He does not however differentiate between writing in  Chinese characters and writing transliterated Chinese, and moreover  \"hizo doctrina\" may only mean that he taught the doctrine, not  necessarily that he wrote one.

See also Beristain, _op. cit._,  I, p. 316, and Quetif and Echard, _op. cit._, II,  pp. 306-7.    [114] Aduarte, I, p. 122.    [115] Fernandez, _Historia Eclesiastica_, p. 304, \"In the Chinese  language and letters, P. Fr. Domingo de Nieva, of San Pablo of  Valladolid, printed a memorial of the Christian life; and P. Fray  Tomas Mayor, of the province of Aragon, from the Convent and College  of Orihuela, the Symbol of Faith.\" In his _Historia de los Insignes  Milagros_, f. 217, Fernandez states that both these works were printed  at Bataan. Since Mayor did not arrive in the islands until 1602 his  work is not pertinent to the present discussion. Mayor's book was seen  but inadequately described by Jose Rodriguez, _Biblioteca Valentina_,  1747, p. 406, from a copy then in the Library of the Dominican Convent  at Valencia, but now lost. Medina records it under the year 1607,  no. 6, p. 6. See also Leon Pinelo, _op. cit._, 1737--38, II, f. 919r,  and Antonio, _op. cit._, I, p. 330.    [116] Aduarte, I, p. 342.

The first year in the Philippines he was with Benavides at  Baybay; the second year he was in Pangasinan. In 1590 he was ordered  to the Chinese mission in Cobo's place by Castro before he left for  China. When Castro got back and Cobo could resume his old station,  San Pedro Martyr went to the vicariate of Bataan \"the language of  which he learned very well,\" and when Cobo left for Japan in 1592,  San Pedro Martyr went back to San Gabriel.

[123] Aduarte, II, pp. 15-18.    [124] Medina, p. xix, supposed that the Doctrina was printed in  the Hospital of San Gabriel in Minondoc, but Aduarte, I, p. 107,  says that when the village of Baybay became overcrowded, it became  necessary to spread the Chinese Christian settlement to a new site  directly across the river, where land was given them by Don Luis  Perez Dasmarinas, the son and successor of Gomez Perez Dasmarinas,  and there a second church of San Gabriel was built. According to an  inscription on a painting of Don Luis, exhibited at the St. Louis  Fair of 1904 and illustrated in B. & R., XXX, p. 228, he bought the  land from Don Antonio Velada on March 28, 1594, so that San Gabriel  of Minondoc could not have been the place where the 1593 volumes were  printed. Marin, _op. cit._, II, p. 617, says that San Gabriel was  moved several years after its foundation to Binondo at the request  of the city, and was rebuilt twice. It is apparent that San Gabriel  in the Parian was abandoned after the church in Binondo was built.    [125] Juan de Vera was probably a comparatively common name at this  time, because upon baptism the natives and Chinese assumed any Spanish  name they pleased, and since Santiago de Vera was governor from 1584 to  1590, his last name would have been very popular. Aduarte, I, p. 86,  mentions an Indian chief, Don Juan de Vera, who helped the Dominicans  in Pangasinan, and Retana, col. 23, quotes from a document sent by  the Audiencia of the Philippines to the King, August 11, 1620, the  appointments as official interpreters of one Juan de Vera on June 15,  1598, and the same or another Juan de Vera on October 9, 1613.
