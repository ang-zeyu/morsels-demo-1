For example, in this sentence, \"The young pastor's voice was  tremulously sweet, rich, deep, and broken,\" it is clear that all four  adjectives after _was_ modify the noun _voice_. But in this sentence,  \"She showed her usual prudence and her usual incomparable decision,\"  _decision_ is modified by the adjective _incomparable_; _usual_  modifies _incomparable decision_, not _decision_ alone; and the  pronoun _her_ limits _usual incomparable decision_.    Adjectives modifying the same noun are said to be of the _same rank_;  those modifying different words or word groups are said to be  adjectives of _different rank_. This distinction is valuable in a  study of punctuation.    Exercise.    In the following quotations, tell what each adjective modifies:--         1. Whenever that look appeared in her wild, bright, deeply black       eyes, it invested them with a strange remoteness and       intangibility.--HAWTHORNE.         2. It may still be argued, that in the present divided state of       Christendom a college which is positively Christian must be       controlled by some religious denomination.--NOAH PORTER.         3. Every quaking leaf and fluttering shadow sent the blood       backward to her heart.--MRS. STOWE.         4. This, our new government, is the first in the history of the       world based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral       truth.--A.H. STEPHENS         5. May we not, therefore, look with confidence to the ultimate       universal acknowledgment of the truths upon which our system       rests?--_Id._         6. A few improper jests and a volley of good, round, solid,       satisfactory, and heaven-defying oaths.--HAWTHORNE.         7. It is well known that the announcement at any private rural       entertainment that there is to be ice cream produces an immediate       and profound impression.--HOLMES.        ADVERBS USED AS ADJECTIVES.    169. By a convenient brevity, adverbs are sometimes used as  adjectives; as, instead of saying, \"the one who was then king,\" in  which _then_ is an adverb, we may say \"the _then_ king,\" making _then_  an adjective. Other instances are,--         My _then_ favorite, in prose, Richard Hooker.--RUSKIN.         Our _sometime_ sister, now our queen.--SHAKESPEARE         Messrs. Bradbury and Evans, the _then_ and _still_ owners.       --TROLLOPE.         The _seldom_ use of it.--TRENCH.         For thy stomach's sake, and thine _often_ infirmities.--_Bible._        HOW TO PARSE ADJECTIVES.      [Sidenote: _What to tell in parsing._]    170. Since adjectives have no gender, person, or case, and very few  have number, the method of parsing is simple.    In parsing an adjective, tell--    (1) The class and subclass to which it belongs.    (2) Its number, if it has number.    (3) Its degree of comparison, if it can be compared.    (4) What word or words it modifies.      MODEL FOR PARSING.    These truths are not unfamiliar to your thoughts.    _These_ points out _what_ truths, therefore demonstrative; plural  number, having a singular, _this_; cannot be compared; modifies the  word _truths_.    _Unfamiliar_ describes _truths_, therefore descriptive; not inflected  for number; compared by prefixing _more_ and _most_; positive degree;  modifies _truths_.      Exercise.    Parse in full each adjective in these sentences:--         1. A thousand lives seemed concentrated in that one moment to       Eliza.         2. The huge green fragment of ice on which she alighted pitched       and creaked.         3. I ask nothing of you, then, but that you proceed to your end       by a direct, frank, manly way.         4.

Gallantly did the lion struggle in the folds of his terrible       enemy, whose grasp each moment grew more fierce and secure, and       most astounding were those frightful yells.         7. This gave the young people entire freedom, and they enjoyed it       to the fullest extent.         8. I will be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice.         9.

There is a class of words having always an adjectival use in  general, but with such subtle functions and various meanings that they  deserve separate treatment. In the sentence, \"He passes an ordinary  brick house on the road, with an ordinary little garden,\" the words  _the_ and _an_ belong to nouns, just as adjectives do; but they cannot  be accurately placed under any class of adjectives. They are nearest  to demonstrative and numeral adjectives.    [Sidenote: _Their origin._]    172. The article the comes from an old demonstrative adjective  (_se_, _seo_, _ethat_, later _the_, _theo_, _that_) which was also an  article in Old English. In Middle English _the_ became an article, and  _that_ remained a demonstrative adjective.    An or a came from the old numeral _an_, meaning _one_.    [Sidenote: _Two relics._]    Our expressions _the one_, _the other_, were formerly _that one_,  _that other_; the latter is still preserved in the expression, in  vulgar English, _the tother_. Not only this is kept in the Scotch  dialect, but the former is used, these occurring as _the tane, the  tother_, or _the tane, the tither_; for example,--         We ca' her sometimes _the tane_, sometimes _the tother_.--SCOTT.    [Sidenote: An _before vowel sounds_, a _before consonant sounds_.]    173. Ordinarily _an_ is used before vowel sounds, and _a_ before  consonant sounds. Remember that a _vowel sound_ does not necessarily  mean beginning with a vowel, nor does _consonant sound_ mean  beginning with a consonant, because English spelling does not  coincide closely with the sound of words. Examples: \"_a_ house,\" \"_an_  orange,\" \"_a_ European,\" \"_an_ honor,\" \"_a_ yelling crowd.\"    [Sidenote: An _with consonant sounds_.]    174. Many writers use _an_ before _h_, even when not silent, when  the word is not accented on the first syllable.         _An_ historian, such as we have been attempting to describe,       would indeed be an intellectual prodigy.--MACAULAY.         The Persians were _an_ heroic people like the Greeks.--BREWER.         He [Rip] evinced _an_ hereditary disposition to attend to       anything else but his business.--IRVING.         _An_ habitual submission of the understanding to mere events and       images.--COLERIDGE.         _An_ hereditary tenure of these offices.--THOMAS JEFFERSON.    [Sidenote: _Definition._]    175. An article is a limiting word, not descriptive, which cannot  be used alone, but always joins to a substantive word to denote a  particular thing, or a group or class of things, or any individual of  a group or class.    [Sidenote: _Kinds._]    176. Articles are either definite or indefinite.    The is the definite article, since it points out a particular  individual, or group, or class.    An or a is the indefinite article, because it refers to any one of  a group or class of things.    An and a are different forms of the same word, the older _an_.

The sun beat down mercilessly out of a cloudless sky.    For a day Tarzan toiled across this now hateful land and at the  going down of the sun the distant mountains to the west seemed no  nearer than at morn. Never a sign of living thing had the ape-man  seen, other than Ska, that bird of ill omen, that had followed him  tirelessly since he had entered this parched waste.    No littlest beetle that he might eat had given evidence that life  of any sort existed here, and it was a hungry and thirsty Tarzan who  lay down to rest in the evening. He decided now to push on during  the cool of the night, for he realized that even mighty Tarzan had  his limitations and that where there was no food one could not eat  and where there was no water the greatest woodcraft in the world  could find none. It was a totally new experience to Tarzan to find  so barren and terrible a country in his beloved Africa. Even the  Sahara had its oases; but this frightful world gave no indication  of containing a square foot of hospitable ground.    However, he had no misgivings but that he would fare forth into  the wonder country of which little Manu had told him, though it  was certain that he would do it with a dry skin and an empty belly.  And so he fought on until daylight, when he again felt the need  of rest. He was at the edge of another of those terrible canyons,  the eighth he had crossed, whose precipitous sides would have taxed  to the uttermost the strength of an untired man well fortified by  food and water, and for the first time, as he looked down into the  abyss and then at the opposite side that he must scale, misgivings  began to assail his mind.    He did not fear death--with the memory of his murdered mate still  fresh in his mind he almost courted it, yet strong within him  was that primal instinct of self-preservation--the battling force  of life that would keep him an active contender against the Great  Reaper until, fighting to the very last, he should be overcome by  a superior power.    A shadow swung slowly across the ground beside him, and looking  up, the ape-man saw Ska, the vulture, wheeling a wide circle above  him. The grim and persistent harbinger of evil aroused the man  to renewed determination. He arose and approached the edge of the  canyon, and then, wheeling, with his face turned upward toward the  circling bird of prey, he bellowed forth the challenge of the bull  ape.    \"I am Tarzan,\" he shouted, \"Lord of the Jungle. Tarzan of the Apes  is not for Ska, eater of carrion. Go back to the lair of Dango  and feed off the leavings of the hyenas, for Tarzan will leave no  bones for Ska to pick in this empty wilderness of death.\"    But before he reached the bottom of the canyon he again was forced  to the realization that his great strength was waning, and when he  dropped exhausted at the foot of the cliff and saw before him the  opposite wall that must be scaled, he bared his fighting fangs and  growled. For an hour he lay resting in the cool shade at the foot  of the cliff. All about him reigned utter silence--the silence of  the tomb. No fluttering birds, no humming insects, no scurrying  reptiles relieved the deathlike stillness. This indeed was the  valley of death.  He felt the depressing influence of the horrible  place settling down upon him; but he staggered to his feet, shaking  himself like a great lion, for was he not still Tarzan, mighty  Tarzan of the Apes? Yes, and Tarzan the mighty he would be until  the last throb of that savage heart!    As he crossed the floor of the canyon he saw something lying close  to the base of the side wall he was approaching--something that  stood out in startling contrast to all the surroundings and yet  seemed so much a part and parcel of the somber scene as to suggest  an actor amid the settings of a well-appointed stage, and, as though  to carry out the allegory, the pitiless rays of flaming Kudu topped  the eastern cliff, picking out the thing lying at the foot of the  western wall like a giant spotlight.    And as Tarzan came nearer he saw the bleached skull and bones of  a human being about which were remnants of clothing and articles  of equipment that, as he examined them, filled the ape-man with  curiosity to such an extent that for a time he forgot his own  predicament in contemplation of the remarkable story suggested by  these mute evidences of a tragedy of a time long past.    The bones were in a fair state of preservation and indicated by  their intactness that the flesh had probably been picked from them  by vultures as none was broken; but the pieces of equipment bore  out the suggestion of their great age. In this protected spot where  there were no frosts and evidently but little rainfall, the bones  might have lain for ages without disintegrating, for there were  here no other forces to scatter or disturb them.    Near the skeleton lay a helmet of hammered brass and a corroded  breastplate of steel while at one side was a long, straight sword  in its scabbard and an ancient harquebus. The bones were those of  a large man--a man of wondrous strength and vitality Tarzan knew  he must have been to have penetrated thus far through the dangers  of Africa with such a ponderous yet at the same time futile armament.    The ape-man felt a sense of deep admiration for this nameless  adventurer of a bygone day. What a brute of a man he must have been  and what a glorious tale of battle and kaleidoscopic vicissitudes  of fortune must once have been locked within that whitened skull!  Tarzan stooped to examine the shreds of clothing that still lay  about the bones. Every particle of leather had disappeared, doubtless  eaten by Ska. No boots remained, if the man had worn boots, but  there were several buckles scattered about suggesting that a great  part of his trappings had been of leather, while just beneath the  bones of one hand lay a metal cylinder about eight inches long and  two inches in diameter. As Tarzan picked it up he saw that it had  been heavily lacquered and had withstood the slight ravages of  time so well as to be in as perfect a state of preservation today  as it had been when its owner dropped into his last, long sleep  perhaps centuries ago.    As he examined it he discovered that one end was closed with  a friction cover which a little twisting force soon loosened and  removed, revealing within a roll of parchment which the ape-man  removed and opened, disclosing a number of age-yellowed sheets  closely written upon in a fine hand in a language which he guessed  to be Spanish but which he could not decipher. Upon the last sheet  was a roughly drawn map with numerous reference points marked upon  it, all unintelligible to Tarzan, who, after a brief examination  of the papers, returned them to their metal case, replaced the top  and was about to toss the little cylinder to the ground beside the  mute remains of its former possessor when some whim of curiosity  unsatisfied prompted him to slip it into the quiver with his arrows,  though as he did so it was with the grim thought that possibly  centuries hence it might again come to the sight of man beside his  own bleached bones.    And then, with a parting glance at the ancient skeleton, he turned  to the task of ascending the western wall of the canyon.  Slowly  and with many rests he dragged his weakening body upwards. Again and  again he slipped back from sheer exhaustion and would have fallen  to the floor of the canyon but for merest chance. How long it took  him to scale that frightful wall he could not have told, and when  at last he dragged himself over the top it was to lie weak and  gasping, too spent to rise or even to move a few inches farther  from the perilous edge of the chasm.    At last he arose, very slowly and with evident effort gaining his  knees first and then staggering to his feet, yet his indomitable  will was evidenced by a sudden straightening of his shoulders and  a determined shake of his head as he lurched forward on unsteady  legs to take up his valiant fight for survival. Ahead he scanned  the rough landscape for sign of another canyon which he knew would  spell inevitable doom.  The western hills rose closer now though  weirdly unreal as they seemed to dance in the sunlight as though  mocking him with their nearness at the moment that exhaustion was  about to render them forever unattainable.    Beyond them he knew must be the fertile hunting grounds of which Manu  had told. Even if no canyon intervened, his chances of surmounting  even low hills seemed remote should he have the fortune to reach  their base; but with another canyon hope was dead. Above them Ska  still circled, and it seemed to the ape-man that the ill-omened  bird hovered ever lower and lower as though reading in that failing  gait the nearing of the end, and through cracked lips Tarzan growled  out his defiance.    Mile after mile Tarzan of the Apes put slowly behind him, borne up  by sheer force of will where a lesser man would have lain down to  die and rest forever tired muscles whose every move was an agony of  effort; but at last his progress became practically mechanical--he  staggered on with a dazed mind that reacted numbly to a single  urge--on, on, on! The hills were now but a dim, ill-defined blur  ahead. Sometimes he forgot that they were hills, and again he  wondered vaguely why he must go on forever through all this torture  endeavoring to overtake them--the fleeing, elusive hills. Presently  he began to hate them and there formed within his half-delirious  brain the hallucination that the hills were German hills, that they  had slain someone dear to him, whom he could never quite recall,  and that he was pursuing to slay them.    This idea, growing, appeared to give him strength--a new and  revivifying purpose--so that for a time he no longer staggered; but  went forward steadily with head erect."]]]
