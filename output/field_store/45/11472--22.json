If it  is lewd the man was right to reject it.\"    \"We love as the wind blows,\" she replied.    \"There is a thing,\" said the Philosopher, \"and it is both the biggest  and the littlest thing in the world.\"    \"What is that?\" said the girl.    \"It is pride,\" he answered. \"It lives in an empty house. The head which  has never been visited by the heart is the house pride lives in. You  are in error, my dear, and not in love. Drive out the knave pride, put a  flower in your hair and walk freely again.\"    The girl laughed, and suddenly her pale face became rosy as the dawn and  as radiant and lovely as a cloud. She shed warmth and beauty about her  as she leaned forward.    \"You are wrong,\" she whispered, \"because he does love me; but he does  not know it yet. He is young and full of fury, and has no time to look  at women, but he looked at me. My heart knows it and my head knows it,  but I am impatient and yearn for him to look at me again. His heart will  remember me to-morrow, and he will come searching for me with prayers  and tears, with shouts and threats. I will be very hard to find  to-morrow when he holds out his arms to the air and the sky, and is  astonished and frightened to find me nowhere. I will hide from him  to-morrow, and frown at him when he speaks, and turn aside when he  follows me: until the day after to-morrow when he will frighten me with  his anger, and hold me with his furious hands, and make me look at him.\"    Saying this the girl arose and prepared to go away.    \"He is in that house,\" said she, \"and I would not let him see me here  for anything in the world.\"    \"You have wasted all my time,\" said the Philosopher, smiling.    \"What else is time for?\" said the girl, and she kissed the Philosopher  and ran swiftly down the road.    She had been gone but a few moments when a man came out of the grey  house and walked quickly across the grass. When he reached the hedge  separating the field from the road he tossed his two arms in the air,  swung them down, and jumped over the hedge into the roadway. He was a  short, dark youth, and so swift and sudden were his movements that  he seemed to look on every side at the one moment although he bore  furiously to his own direction.    The Philosopher addressed him mildly.    \"That was a good jump,\" said he.    The young man spun around from where he stood, and was by the  Philosopher's side in an instant.    \"It would be a good jump for other men,\" said he, \"but it is only a  little jump for me. You are very dusty, sir; you must have travelled a  long distance to-day.\"    \"A long distance,\" replied the Philosopher. \"Sit down here, my friend,  and keep me company for a little time.\"    \"I do not like sitting down,\" said the young man, \"but I always consent  to a request, and I always accept friendship.\" And, so saying, he threw  himself down on the grass.    \"Do you work in that big house?\" said the Philosopher.    \"I do,\" he replied. \"I train the hounds for a fat, jovial man, full of  laughter and insolence.\"    \"I think you do not like your master.\"    \"Believe, sir, that I do not like any master; but this man I hate. I  have been a week in his service, and he has not once looked on me as on  a friend. This very day, in the kennel, he passed me as though I were  a tree or a stone. I almost leaped to catch him by the throat and say:  'Dog, do you not salute your fellow-man?' But I looked after him and let  him go, for it would be an unpleasant thing to strangle a fat person.\"    \"If you are displeased with your master should you not look for another  occupation?\" said the Philosopher.    \"I was thinking of that, and I was thinking whether I ought to kill him  or marry his daughter. She would have passed me by as her father did,  but I would not let a woman do that to me: no man would.\"    \"What did you do to her?\" said the Philosopher.    The young man chuckled \"I did not look at her the first time, and when  she came near me the second time I looked another way, and on the third  day she spoke to me, and while she stood I looked over her shoulder  distantly. She said she hoped I would be happy in my new home, and she  made her voice sound pleasant while she said it; but I thanked her and  turned away carelessly.\"    \"Is the girl beautiful?\" said the Philosopher.    \"I do not know,\" he replied; \"I have not looked at her yet, although  now I see her everywhere. I think she is a woman who would annoy me if I  married her.\"    \"If you haven't seen her, how can you think that?\"    \"She has tame feet,\" said the youth. \"I looked at them and they got  frightened. Where have you travelled from, sir?\"    \"I will tell you that,\" said the Philosopher, \"if you will tell me your  name.\"    \"It is easily told,\" he answered; \"my name is MacCulain.\"    \"When I came last night,\" said the Philosopher, \"from the place of Angus  Og in the cave of the Sleepers of Erinn I was bidden say to a man named  MacCulain that The Grey of Macha had neighed in his sleep and the sword  of Laeg clashed on the floor as he turned in his slumber.\"    The young man leaped from the grass.    \"Sir,\" said he in a strained voice, \"I do not understand your words, but  they make my heart to dance and sing within me like a bird.\"    \"If you listen to your heart,\" said the Philosopher, \"you will learn  every good thing, for the heart is the fountain of wisdom tossing its  thoughts up to the brain which gives them form,\"--and, so saying, he  saluted the youth and went again on his way by the curving road.    Now the day had advanced, noon was long past, and the strong sunlight  blazed ceaselessly on the world. His path was still on the high  mountains, running on for a short distance and twisting perpetually to  the right hand and to the left. One might scarcely call it a path, it  grew so narrow. Sometimes, indeed, it almost ceased to be a path, for  the grass had stolen forward inch by inch to cover up the tracks of man.  There were no hedges but rough, tumbled ground only, which was patched  by trailing bushes and stretched away in mounds and hummocks beyond the  far horizon. There was a deep silence everywhere, not painful, for where  the sun shines there is no sorrow: the only sound to be heard was the  swish of long grasses against his feet as he trod, and the buzz of an  occasional bee that came and was gone in an instant.    The Philosopher was very hungry, and he looked about on all sides to see  if there was anything he might eat. \"If I were a goat or a cow,\" said  he, \"I could eat this grass and be nourished. If I were a donkey I could  crop the hard thistles which are growing on every hand, or if I were  a bird I could feed on the caterpillars and creeping things which stir  innumerably everywhere. But a man may not eat even in the midst of  plenty, because he has departed from nature, and lives by crafty and  twisted thought.\"    Speaking in this manner he chanced to lift his eyes from the ground and  saw, far away, a solitary figure which melted into the folding earth and  reappeared again in a different place. So peculiar and erratic were the  movements of this figure that the Philosopher had great difficulty in  following it, and, indeed, would have been unable to follow, but that  the other chanced in his direction. When they came nearer he saw it  was a young boy, who was dancing hither and thither in any and every  direction. A bushy mound hid him for an instant, and the next they were  standing face to face staring at each other. After a moment's silence  the boy, who was about twelve years of age, and as beautiful as the  morning, saluted the Philosopher.    \"Have you lost your way, sir?\" said he.    \"All paths,\" the Philosopher replied, \"are on the earth, and so one can  never be lost--but I have lost my dinner.\"    The boy commenced to laugh.    \"What are you laughing at, my son?\" said the Philosopher.    \"Because,\" he replied, \"I am bringing you your dinner. I wondered what  sent me out in this direction, for I generally go more to the east.\"    \"Have you got my dinner?\" said the Philosopher anxiously.    \"I have,\" said the boy: \"I ate my own dinner at home, and I put your  dinner in my pocket. I thought,\" he explained, \"that I might be hungry  if I went far away.\"    \"The gods directed you,\" said the Philosopher.    \"They often do,\" said the boy, and he pulled a small parcel from his  pocket.    The Philosopher instantly sat down, and the boy handed him the parcel.  He opened this and found bread and cheese.    \"It's a good dinner,\" said he, and commenced to eat.    \"Would you not like a piece also, my son?\"    \"I would like a little piece,\" said the boy, and he sat down before the  Philosopher, and they ate together happily.    When they had finished the Philosopher praised the gods, and then said,  more to himself than to the boy:    \"If I had a little drink of water I would want nothing else.\"    \"There is a stream four paces from here,\" said his companion. \"I will  get some water in my cap,\" and he leaped away.    In a few moments he came back holding his cap tenderly, and the  Philosopher took this and drank the water.    \"I want nothing more in the world,\" said he, \"except to talk with you.  The sun is shining, the wind is pleasant, and the grass is soft. Sit  down beside me again for a little time.\"    So the boy sat down, and the Philosopher lit his pipe.    \"Do you live far from here?\" said he.    \"Not far,\" said the boy. \"You could see my mother's house from this  place if you were as tall as a tree, and even from the ground you can  see a shape of smoke yonder that floats over our cottage.\"    The Philosopher looked but could see nothing.    \"My eyes are not as good as yours are,\" said he, \"because I am getting  old.\"    \"What does it feel like to be old?\" said the boy.    \"It feels stiff like,\" said the Philosopher.    \"Is that all?\" said the boy.    \"I don't know,\" the Philosopher"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16059"],[0,"Modern Spanish Lyrics (#18)"],[1,"zagalas.

Do quiera Espana: en el preciado seno  10    De America, en el Asia, en los confines        Del Africa, alli Espana. El soberano        Vuelo de la atrevida fantasia        Para abarcarla se cansaba en vano;        La tierra sus mineros le rendia,        Sus perlas y coral el Oceano,  15    Y donde quier que revolver sus olas        El intentase, a quebrantar su furia        Siempre encontraba costas espanolas.          Ora en el cieno del oprobio hundida,        Abandonada a la insolencia ajena,  20    Como esclava en mercado, ya aguardaba        La ruda argolla y la servil cadena.        iQue de plagas! ioh Dios! Su aliento impuro,        La pestilente fiebre respirando,        Infesto el aire, emponzono la vida;                       page 47        La hambre enflaquecida        Tendio sus brazos lividos, ahogando        Cuanto el contagio perdono; tres veces        De Jano el templo abrimos,  5     Y a la trompa de Marte aliento dimos;        Tres veces iay!

Ceso en su dulce canto el pasajero,        Ahogo su voceria        El ronco marinero,        Terror de muerte en torno le rodea,  25    Terror de muerte silencioso y frio;        Y el va a estrellarse al aspero bajio.
