Note the Machine Gun.]    The only remedy for the present extermination of game according to law  that so rapidly and so furiously is proceeding all over the United  States, Canada, Alaska, and Africa, is ten-year close seasons on all the  species threatened with extinction, and immensely reduced open seasons  and bag limits on all the others.    Will the people who still have wild game take heed now, and clamp down  the brakes, hard and fast before it is too late, or will they have their  game exterminated?    Shall we have five-year close seasons, or close seasons of 500 years? We  must take our choice.    Shall we hand down to our children a gameless continent, with all the  shame that such a calamity will entail?    We have _got_ to answer these questions like men, or they will soon be  answered for us by the extermination of the wild life. For twenty-five  years we have been smarting under the disgrace of the extermination of  our bison millions. Let us not repeat the dose through the destruction  of other species.           *        *        *        *        *    CHAPTER VII    THE GUERRILLAS OF DESTRUCTION      We have now to deal with THE GUERRILLAS OF DESTRUCTION.    In warfare, a _guerrilla, or bushwhacker_, is an armed man who  recognizes none of the rules of civilized warfare, and very often has no  commander. In France he is called a \"franc-tireur,\" or free-shooter. The  guerrilla goes out to live on the country, to skulk, to war on the weak,  and never attack save from ambush, or when the odds clearly are on his  side. His military status is barely one remove from that of the spy.    The meat-shooters who harry the game and other wild life in order to use  it as a staple food supply; the Italians, negroes and others who shoot  song-birds as food; the plume-hunters and the hide-and-tusk hunters all  over the world are the guerrillas of the Army of Destruction. Let us  consider some of these grand divisions in detail.    Here is an inexorable law of Nature, to which there are no exceptions:    _No wild species of bird, mammal, reptile or fish can withstand  exploitation for commercial purposes_.    The men who pursue wild creatures for the money or other value there is  in them, never give up. They work at slaughter when other men are  enjoying life, or are asleep. If they are persistent, no species on  which they fix the Evil Eye escapes extermination at their hands.    Does anyone question this statement? If so let him turn backward and  look at the lists of dead and dying species.    THE DIVISION OF MEAT-SHOOTERS contains all men who sordidly shoot for  the frying-pan,--to save bacon and beef at the expense of the public, or  for the markets. There are a few wilderness regions so remote and so  difficult of access that the transportation of meat into them is a  matter of much difficulty and expense. There are a very few men in North  America who are justified in \"living off the country,\" _for short  periods_. The genuine prospectors always have been counted in this  class; but all miners who are fully located, all lumbermen and  railway-builders certainly are not in the prospector's class. They are  abundantly able to maintain continuous lines of communication for the  transit of beef and mutton.    Of all the meat-shooters, the market-gunners who prey on wild fowl and  ground game birds for the big-city markets are the most deadly to wild  life. Enough geese, ducks, brant, quail, ruffed grouse, prairie  chickens, heath hens and wild pigeons have been butchered by gunners and  netters for \"the market\" to have stocked the whole world. No section  containing a good supply of game has escaped. In the United States the  great slaughtering-grounds have been Cape Cod; Great South Bay, New  York; Currituck Sound, North Carolina; Marsh Island, Louisiana; the  southwest corner of Louisiana; the Sunk Lands of Arkansas; the lake  regions of Minnesota; the prairies of the whole middle West; Great Salt  Lake; the Klamath Lake region (Oregon) and southern California.    [Illustration: A MARKET GUNNER AT WORK ON MARSH ISLAND  Killing Mallards for the New Orleans Market. The Purchase of This Island by  Mrs. Russell Sage has now Converted it Into a Bird Sanctuary]    The output of this systematic bird slaughter has supplied the greedy  game markets of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Baltimore,  Chicago, New Orleans, St. Louis, Salt Lake City, San Francisco,  Portland, and Seattle. The history of this industry, its methods, its  carnage, its profits and its losses would make a volume, but we can not  enter upon it here. Beyond reasonable doubt, this awful traffic in dead  game is responsible for at least three-fourths of the slaughter that has  reduced our game birds to a mere remnant of their former abundance.  There is no influence so deadly to wild life as that of the market  gunner who works six days a week, from sunrise until sunset, hunting  down and killing every game bird that he can reach with a choke-bore  gun.    During the past five years, several of the once-great killing grounds  have been so thoroughly \"shot out\" that they have ceased to hold their  former rank. This is the case with the Minnesota Lakes, the Sunk Lands  of Arkansas, the Klamath Lakes of Oregon, and I think it is also true of  southern California. The Klamath Lakes have been taken over by the  Government as a bird refuge. Currituck Sound, at the northeastern corner  of North Carolina, has been so bottled up by the Bayne law of New York  State that Currituck's greatest market has been cut off. Last year only  one-half the usual number of ducks and geese were killed; and already  many \"professional\" duck and brant shooters have abandoned the business  because the commission merchants no longer will buy dead birds.    [Illustration: RUFFED GROUSE  A Common Victim of Illegal Slaughter]    Very many enormous bags of game have been made in a day by market  gunners: but rarely have they published any of their records. The  greatest kill of which I ever have heard occurred under the auspices of  the Glenn County Club, in southern California, on February 5, 1906. Two  men, armed with automatic shot-guns, fired five shots apiece, and got  ten geese out of one flock. In one hour they killed _two hundred and  eighteen geese_, and their bag for the day was _four hundred and fifty  geese!_ The shooter who wrote the story for publication (on February 12,  at Willows, Glenn County, California) said: \"It being warm weather, the  birds had to be shipped at once in order to keep them from spoiling.\" A  photograph was made of the \"one hour's slaughter\" of two hundred and  eighteen geese, and it was published in a western magazine with  \"C.H.B.'s\" story, nearly all of which will be found in Chapter XV.    The reasons why market shooting is so deadly destructive to wild life  are not obscure.    The true sportsman hunts during a very few days only each year. The  market gunners shoot early and late, six days a week, month after month.  When game is abundant, the price is low, and a great quantity must be  killed in order to make it pay well. When game is scarce, the market  prices are high, and the shooter makes the utmost exertions to find the  last of the game in order to secure the \"big money.\"    When game is protected by law, thousands of people with money desire it  for their tables, just the same, and are willing to pay fabulous prices  for what they want, when they want it. Many a dealer is quite willing to  run the risk of fines, because fines don't really hurt; they are only  annoying. The dealer wishes to make the big profit, and _retain his  customers_; \"and besides,\" he reasons, \"if I don't supply him some one  else will; so what is the difference?\"    When game is scarce, prices high and the consumer's money ready, there  are a hundred tricks to which shooters and dealers willingly resort to  ship and receive unlawful game without detection. It takes the very  best kind of game wardens,--genuine detectives, in fact,--to ferret out  these cunning illegal practices, and catch lawbreakers \"with the goods  on them,\" so that they can be punished. Mind you, convictions can not be  secured at _both_ ends of the line save by the most extraordinary good  fortune, and usually the shooter and shipper escape, even when the  dealer is apprehended and fined.    [Illustration: A PERFECTLY LAWFUL BAG OF 58 RUFFED GROUSE FOR TWO MEN  From \"Rod and Gun in Canada\"]    Here are some of the methods that have been practiced in the past in  getting illegal game into the New York market:    Ruffed grouse and quail have both been shipped in butter firkins, marked  \"butter\"; and latterly, butter has actually been packed solidly on top  of the birds.    Ruffed grouse and quail very often have been shipped in egg crates,  marked \"eggs.\" They have been shipped in trunks and suit cases,--a very  common method for illegal game birds, all over the United States. In  Oklahoma when a man refuses to open his trunk for a game warden, the  warden joyously gets out his brace and bitt, and bores an inch hole into  the lower story of the trunk. If dead birds are there, the tell-tale  auger quickly reveals them.    Three years ago, I was told that certain milk-wagons on Long Island made  daily collections of dead ducks intended for the New York market, and  the drivers kindly shipped them by express from the end of the route.    Once upon a time, a New York man gave notice that on a certain date he  would be in a certain town in St. Lawrence County, New York, with a  palace horse-car, \"to buy horses.\" Car and man appeared there as  advertised. Very ostentatiously, he bought one horse, and had it taken  aboard the car before the gaze of the admiring populace. At night, when  the A.P. had gone to bed, many men appeared, and into the horseless end  of that car, they loaded thousands of ruffed grouse.

'I am come to conclude a peace, not to claim your kingdom. By what mode  shall we conclude it?'    'How many modes be there?' asked King Silver-sides.    'Sixteen,' replied the Vulture.    'Are the alliances numbered therein?' asked the King.    'No! these be four,' answered the Vulture, 'namely--of mutual help--of  friendship--of blood--and of sacrifice.'    'You are a great diplomatist!' said the King. 'Advise us which to  choose!'    'There is no Peace like the Golden \"Sangata,\" which is made between good  men, based on friendly feeling, and preceded by the Oath of Truth,'  replied the Vulture.    'Let us make that Peace!' said the Goose. Far-sight accordingly, with  fresh presents of robes and jewels, accompanied the Goose to the camp of  the Peacock-King. The Rajah, Jewel-plume, gave the Goose a gracious  audience, accepted his terms of Peace, and sent him back to the  Swan-King, loaded with gifts and kind speeches. The revolt in Jambudwipa  was suppressed, and the Peacock-King retired to his own kingdom.    \"And now,\" said Vishnu-Sarman, \"I have told your Royal Highnesses all.

NALA AND DAMAYANTI    [_Selected from the \"Mahabharata\" Translation by Sir Edwin Arnold_]      INTRODUCTION      The \"Mahabharata\" is the oldest epic in Sanscrit literature, and is  sevenfold greater in bulk than the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" taken together.  This remarkable poem contains almost all the history of ancient India,  so far as it can be recovered, together with inexhaustible details of  its political, social, and religious life--in fact, the antique Hindoo  world stands epitomized in it. The Old Testament is not more interwoven  with the Jewish race, nor the New Testament with the civilization of  Christendom, nor even the Koran with the records and destinies of Islam,  than is this great Sanscrit poem with the unchanging and teeming  population of Hindostan. The stories, songs, and ballads, the  genealogies, the nursery tales and religious discourses, the art, the  learning, the philosophy, the creeds, the modes of thought, the very  phrases and daily ideas of the Hindoo people are taken from this poem.  Their children are named after its heroes; so are their cities, streets,  and even cattle. It is the spiritual life of the Hindoo people. It is  personified, worshipped, and cited as being something divine. To read,  or even to listen, is to the devout Hindoo sufficiently meritorious to  bring prosperity to the fireside in this world, and happiness in the  world to come.    The western world has as yet only received the \"Mahabharata\" in  fragments--mere specimens, bearing to those vast treasures of Sanscrit  literature such small proportion as cabinet samples of ore have to the  riches of a mine. Such knowledge as we have of the great Indian epics is  largely due to Sir William Jones, and the host of translators who  followed him.    In its present shape the \"Mahabharata\" contains some two hundred  thousand verses. The style is forcible, often terse and nervous: the  action is well sustained, and the whole effect produced is that of a  poem written in commemoration of actual conflict between members of  rival clans who lived somewhere southeast of the Punjab. In portrayal of  character the Hindoo poem somewhat resembles its Grecian  counterpart--the \"Iliad\"; the noble devotion and chivalric character of  its chief hero, Arjuna, reminds us of Hector--and the wily, sinful  Duryodhana, is a second Ulysses. The \"Mahabharata\" was probably begun in  the third or fourth century B.C., and completed soon after the beginning  of the Christian era.    The \"Bharata\" war is a war between rival cousins of the house of  Bharata, a race of heroes mentioned in the Rig-veda collection.  Duryodhana deprives his cousin Yudhisthira of his throne by inducing him  to squander his fortune, kingdom, family, and self--and then banishes  Yudhisthira and the latter's four brothers for twelve years. The  gambling was conducted in an unfair manner, and the cousins feel that  their banishment was the result of treachery, although pretended to be  mercy in lieu of death. When the twelve years are over they collect  armies of sympathizers, and on the Sacred Plain of the Kurus (the Holy  Land of India) the great war is fought out. The good prevails,  Duryodhana is slain, and Yudhisthira recovers his kingdom. This story is  told so graphically that the \"Mahabharata\" still has the charm that  comes from plot and action, as well as that of poetic beauty.    A concluding passage of this great poem says: \"The reading of this  'Mahabharata' destroys all sin and produces virtue, so much so that the  pronunciation of a single shloka is sufficient to wipe away much guilt.  It has bound human beings in a chain, of which one end is life and the  other death. If a man reads the 'Mahabharata' and has faith in its  doctrines, he is free from all sin and ascends to heaven after his  death.\"    The present selection is the episode of Nala and Damayanti. It is one of  the most charming of the \"Mahabharata\" stories, and its Oriental flavor  and delicacy have been well preserved by the translator, Sir Edwin  Arnold.    L.F.C.          THE MAHABHARATA      NALA AND DAMAYANTI    Part I          A prince there was, named Nala, Virasen's noble breed,      Goodly to see, and virtuous; a tamer of the steed;      As Indra 'midst the gods, so he of kings was kingliest one,      Sovereign of men, and splendid as the golden, glittering sun;      Pure, knowing scripture, gallant; ruling nobly Nishadh's lands;      Dice-loving, but a proud, true chief of her embattled bands;      By lovely ladies lauded; free, trained in self-control;      A shield and bow; a Manu on earth; a royal soul!      And in Vidarbha's city the Raja Bhima dwelled;      Save offspring, from his perfect bliss no blessing was withheld;      For offspring, many a pious rite full patiently he wrought,      Till Damana the Brahman unto his house was brought.      Him Bhima, ever reverent, did courteously entreat,      Within the Queen's pavilion led him, to rest and eat;      Whereby that sage, grown grateful, gave her--for joy of joys--      A girl, the gem of girlhood, and three brave lusty boys--      Damana, Dama, Danta, their names:--Damayanti she;      No daughter more delightful, no sons could goodlier be.      Stately and bright and beautiful did Damayanti grow;      No land there was which did not the Slender-waisted know;      A hundred slaves her fair form decked with robe and ornament--      Like Sachi's self to serve her a hundred virgins bent;      And 'midst them Bhima's daughter, in peerless glory dight,      Gleamed as the lightning glitters against the murk of night;      Having the eyes of Lakshmi, long-lidded, black, and bright--      Nay--never Gods, nor Yakshas, nor mortal men among      Was one so rare and radiant e'er seen, or sued, or sung      As she, the heart-consuming, in heaven itself desired.      And Nala, too, of princes the Tiger-Prince, admired      Like Kama was; in beauty an embodied lord of love:      And ofttimes Nala praised they all other chiefs above      In Damayanti's hearing; and oftentimes to him,      With worship and with wonder, her beauty they would limn;      So that, unmet, unknowing, unseen, in each for each      A tender thought of longing grew up from seed of speech;      And love (thou son of Kunti!) those gentle hearts did reach.        Thus Nala--hardly bearing in his heart      Such longing--wandered in his palace-woods,      And marked some water-birds, with painted plumes,      Disporting. One, by stealthy steps, he seized;      But the sky-traveller spake to Nala this:--      \"Kill me not, Prince, and I will serve thee well.      For I, in Damayanti's ear, will say      Such good of Nishadh's lord, that nevermore      Shall thought of man possess her, save of thee.\"        Thereat the Prince gladly gave liberty      To his soft prisoner, and all the swans      Flew, clanging, to Vidarbha--a bright flock--      Straight to Vidarbha, where the Princess walked;      And there, beneath her eyes, those winged ones      Lighted. She saw them sail to earth, and marked--      Sitting amid her maids--their graceful forms;      While those for wantonness 'gan chase the swans,      Which fluttered this and that way through the grove:      Each girl with tripping feet her bird pursued,      And Damayanti, laughing, followed hers;      Till--at the point to grasp--the flying prey      Deftly eluding touch, spake as men speak,      Addressing Bhima's daughter:--                            "]]]
