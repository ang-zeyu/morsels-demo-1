This is not determined by any recognizable  resemblance. It had a tail 70 deg. long; it was not all arisen when  its head reached the meridian. It is possible, from the shape of  its orbit, that it has a periodic time of nine thousand years, or  that it may have a parabolic orbit, and never return. Observations  taken two hundred years ago have not the exactness necessary to  determine so delicate a point.    On August 19th, 1682, Halley discovered a comet which he soon declared  to be one seen by Kepler in 1607. Looking back still farther, he  found that a comet was seen in 1531 having the same orbit. Still  farther, by the same exact period of seventy-five years, he found  that it was the same comet that had disturbed [Page 129] the  equanimity of Pope Calixtus in 1456. Calculations were undertaken as  to the result of all the accelerations and retardations by the  attractions of all the planets for the next seventy-five years.  There was not time to finish all the work; but a retardation of six  hundred and eighteen days was determined, with a possible error of  thirty days. The comet actually came to time within thirty-three  days, on March 12th, 1759. Again its return was calculated with more  laborious care. It came to time and passed the sun within three days  of the predicted time, on the 16th of November, 1835. It passed from  sight of the most powerful telescopes the following May, and has  never since been seen by human eye. But the eye of science sees it  as having passed its aphelion beyond the orbit of Neptune in 1873,  and is already hastening back to the warmth and light of the sun. It  will be looked for in 1911; and there is good hope of predicting,  long before it is seen, the time of its perihelion within a day.    _Biela's lost Comet._--This was a comet with a periodic time of  six years and eight months. It was observed in January, 1846, to  have separated into two parts of unequal brightness. The lesser  part grew for a month until it equalled the other, then became  smaller and disappeared, while the other was visible a month longer.  At disappearance the parts were 200,000 miles asunder. On its next  return, in 1852, the parts were 1,500,000 miles apart; sometimes  one was brighter and sometimes the other; which was the fragment  and which was the main body could not be recognized. They vanished  in September, 1852, and have never been seen since. Three revolutions  have been made since that time, but no [Page 130] trace of it could  be discovered. Probably the same influence that separated it into  parts, separated the particles till too thin and tenuous to be seen.  There is ground for believing that the earth passed through a part  of it, as before stated under the head of meteors.    _The Great Comet of_ 1843 passed nearer the sun than any known  body. It almost grazed the sun. If it ever returns, it will be in  A.D. 2373.    _Donati's Comet of_ 1858.--This was one of the most magnificent  of modern times. During the first three months it showed no tail,  but from August to October it had developed one forty degrees in  length. Its period is about two thousand years. Every reader remembers  the comet of the summer of 1875.    _Encke's Comet._--This comet has become famous for its supposed  confirmation of the theory that space was filled with a substance  infinitely tenuous, which resisted the passage of this gaseous  body in an appreciable degree, and in long ages would so retard  the motion of all the planets that gravitation would draw them  all one by one into the sun. We must not be misled by the term  retardation to suppose it means behind time, for a retarded body  is before time. If its velocity is diminished, the attraction of  the sun causes it to take a smaller orbit, and smaller orbits mean  increased speed--hence the supposed retardation would shorten its  periodic time. This comet was thought to be retarded two and a  half hours at each revolution. If it was, it would not prove the  existence of the resisting medium. Other causes, unknown to us,  might account for it. Subsequent and more exact calculations fail  to find any retardations in at least two revolutions between 1865  and [Page 131] 1871. Indications point to a retardation of one and a  half hours both before and since. But such discrepancy of result  proves nothing concerning a resisting medium, but rather is an  argument against its existence. Besides, Faye's comet, in four  revolutions of seven years each, shows no sign of retardation.    The truth may be this, that a kind of atmosphere exists around the  sun, perhaps revealed by the zodiacal light, that reaches beyond  where Encke's comet dips inside the orbit of Mercury, and thus  retards this body, but does not reach beyond the orbit of Mars,  where Faye's comet wheels and withdraws.    _Of what do Comets consist?_    The unsolved problems pertaining to comets are very numerous and  exceedingly delicate. Whence come they? Why did they not contract to  centres of nebulae? Are there regions where attractions are balanced,  and matter is left to contract on itself, till the movements of  suns and planets adds or diminishes attractive force on one side,  and so allows them to be drawn slowly toward one planet, and its  sun, or another? There is ground for thinking that the comet of  1866 and its train of meteors, visible to us in November, was thus  drawn into our system by the planet Uranus. Indeed, Leverrier has  conjecturally fixed upon the date of A.D. 128 as the time when it  occurred; but another and closer observation of its next return,  in 1899, will be needed to give confirmation to the opinion. Our  sun's authority extends at least half-way to the nearest fixed star,  one hundred thousand times farther than the orbit of the earth.  Meteoric and cometary matter lying [Page 132] there, in a spherical  shell about the solar system, balanced between the attraction of  different suns, finally feels the power that determines its destiny  toward our sun. It would take 167,000,000 years to come thence to  our system.    The conditions of matter with which we are acquainted do not cover  all the ground presented by these mysterious visitors. We know  a gas sixteen times as light as air, but hydrogen is vastly too  heavy and dense; for we see the faintest star through thousands of  miles of cometary matter; we know that water may become cloudy vapor,  but a little of it obscures the vision. Into what more ethereal,  and we might almost say spiritual, forms matter may be changed we  cannot tell. But if we conceive comets to be only gas, it would  expand indefinitely in the realms of space, where there is no force  of compression but its own. We might say that comets are composed  of small separate masses of matter, hundreds of miles apart; and,  looking through thousands of miles of them, we see light enough  reflected from them all to seem continuous. Doubtless that is sometimes  the case. But the spectroscope shows another state of things: it  reveals in some of these comets an incandescent gas--usually some  of the combinations of carbon. The conclusion, then, naturally is  that there are both gas and small masses of matter, each with an  orbit of its own nearly parallel to those of all the others, and  that they afford some attraction to hold the mass of intermingled and  confluent gas together. Our best judgment, then, is that the nucleus  is composed of separate bodies, or matter in a liquid condition,  capable of being vaporized by the heat of the sun, and driven off,  [Page 133] as steam from a locomotive, into a tail. Indications of  this are found in the fact that tails grow smaller at successive  returns, as the matter capable of such vaporization becomes  condensed. In some instances, as in that of the comet of 1843, the  head was diminished by the manufacture of a tail. On the other hand,  Professor Peirce showed that the nucleus of the comets of 1680,  1843, and 1858 must have had a tenacity equal to steel, to prevent  being pulled apart by the tidal forces caused by its terrible  perihelion sweep around the sun.    It is likely that there are great varieties of condition in different  comets, and in the same comet at times. We see them but a few days  out of the possible millions of their periodic time; we see them  only close to the sun, under the spur of its tremendous attraction  and terrible heat. This gives us ample knowledge of the path of  their orbit and time of their revolution, but little ground for  judgment of their condition, when they slowly round the uttermost  cape of their far-voyaging, in the terrible cold and darkness,  to commence their homeward flight. The unsolved problems are not  all in the distant sun and more distant stars, but one of them  is carried by us, sometimes near, sometimes far off; but our  acquaintance with the possible forms and conditions of matter is  too limited to enable us to master the difficulties.    _Will Comets strike the Earth?_    Very likely, since one or two have done so within a recent period.  What will be the effect? That depends on circumstances. There is  good reason to suppose we passed through the tail of a comet in  1861, and the only [Page 134] observable effect was a peculiar  phosphorescent mist. If the comet were composed of small meteoric  masses a brilliant shower would be the result. But if we fairly  encountered a nucleus of any considerable mass and solidity, the  result would be far more serious. The mass of Donati's comet has  been estimated by M. Faye to be 1/20000 of that of the earth. If  this amount of matter were dense as water, it would make a globe  five hundred miles in diameter; and if"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15625"],[0,"The Lookout Man (#18)"],[1,"a volcano spouting off right in your front view? And a  fire on the other side, so if you get tired looking at one, you can  turn your head and look at the other one. And for a change, you can  watch the lake, or just gaze at the scenery; and say!--does the star  spangled banner still wave?\"    \"She still waves,\" Jack assented somberly, picking up the wash basin.  Why couldn't he enter the girl's foolery? He used to be full of it  himself, and he used to consider that the natural form of  companionship. He must be getting queer like all other hermits he had  ever heard of. It occurred to him that possibly Marion Rose was not  really feather-brained, but that the trouble was in himself, because  he was getting a chronic grouch.    He was thinking while he ate. He had plenty of encouragement for  thinking, because Marion herself seemed to be absorbed in her own  thoughts. When she was filling his coffee cup the second time, she  spoke quite abruptly.    \"It would be terribly foolish for you to leave here, Jack Corey--or  whatever you would rather be called. I don't believe any one has the  faintest notion that you came up here into this country. If they had,  they would have come after you before this. But they're still on the  watch for you in other places, and I suppose every police station in  the country has your description tacked on the wall or some place.    \"I believe you'd better stay right where you are, and wait till  something turns up to clear you. Maybe that man will get well, and  then it won't be so serious; though, of course, being right through  his lungs, the doctors claim it's pretty bad. I'll know if he dies or  not, because he's a friend of Fred's, and Fred would hear right away.  And we can make up a set of signals, and flash them with glasses, like  we were doing just for fun this afternoon. Then I won't have to climb  clear up here if something happens that you ought to know about--don't  you see? I can walk out in sight of here and signal with my vanity  mirror. It will be fun.    \"And when you're through here, if I were you I'd find some nice place  here in the hills to camp. It isn't half as bad to stay right in the  mountains, as it would be to stay in town and imagine that every  strange man you see has come after you. Sometimes I wish I could get  right out where there's not a soul, and just stay there. Being in the  woods with people around is not like being in the woods with just the  woods. I've found that out. People kind of keep your mind tied down to  little things that part of you hates, don't you know? Like when I'm  with Kate, I think about facial massage and manicuring, and shows that  I'd like to see and can't, and places where I'd like to go and eat and  watch the people and dance and listen to the music, and can't; and  going to the beaches when I can't, and taking automobile trips when I  can't, and boys--and all that sort of thing. But when I'm all by  myself in the woods, I never think of those things.\"    \"I saw you down there by the hydrometer, all by yourself. And you were  using your powder puff to beat the band.\" A twinkle lived for a second  or two in the somber brown of Jack's eyes.    \"You did? Well, that was second nature. I wasn't thinking about it,  anyway.\"    \"What were you thinking about when you kept staring up here? Not the  beauties of nature, I bet.\" A perverse spirit made Jack try to push  her back into the frivolous talk he had so lately and so bitterly  deplored.    \"Well, I was wondering if you had gumption enough to appreciate being  up where you could watch the mountains all the while, and see them by  day and by night and get really acquainted with them, so that they  would tell you things they remember about the world a thousand years  ago. I wondered if you had it in you to appreciate them, and know  every little whim of a shadow and every little laugh of the sun--or  whether you just stayed up here because they pay you money for  staying. I've been so jealous of you, up here in your little glass  house! I've lain awake the last three nights, peeking through the  tree-tops at the little speck of sky I could see with stars in it, and  thinking how you had them spread out all around you--and you asleep,  maybe, and never looking!    \"I'm awful sorry you're in trouble, and about your mother and all. But  I think you're the luckiest boy I know, because you just happened to  get to this place. Sometimes when I look at you I just want to take  you by the shoulder and _shake_ you!--because you don't half know how  lucky you are. Why, all that makes the world such a rotten place to  live in is because the people are starved all the while for beauty.  Not beauty you can buy, but beauty like this around us, that you can  feast on--\"    \"And I get pretty well fed up on it, too, sometimes,\" Jack put in,  still perverse.    \"And for that I pity you. I was going to wash the dishes, but you can  do it yourself. I'm going out where I can forget there are any people  in the world. I'll never have another night like this--it would be too  much luck for one person.\"    She set down her cup, which she had been tilting back and forth in her  fingers while she spoke. She got up, pulled Jack's heavy sweater off a  nail in the corner, and went out without another word to him or a look  toward him. She seemed to be absolutely sincere in her calm disposal  of him as something superfluous and annoying. She seemed also to be  just as sincere in her desire for a close companionship with the  solitude that surrounded them.    Jack looked after her, puzzled. But he had discovered too many  contradictory moods and emotions in his own nature to puzzle long over  Marion's sudden changes. Three months ago he would have called her  crazy, or accused her of posing. Now, however, he understood well  enough the spell of that tremendous view. He had felt it too often and  too deeply to grudge her one long feast for her imagination. So he  took her at her word and let her go.    He tidied the small room and sent in another report of the headlong  rush of the fire and the direction of the wind that fanned it. He  learned that all Genessee was out, fighting to keep the flames from  sweeping down across the valley. Three hundred men were fighting it,  the supervisor told him. They would check it on the downhill slope,  where it would burn more slowly; and if the wind did not change in the  night it would probably be brought under control by morning. After  that the supervisor very discreetly inquired after the welfare of the  young lady who had telephoned. Had she found any means of getting back  to her camp, or of sending any word?    Jack replied she had not, and that there was no likelihood of her  getting away before daylight. There were too many burning trees and  stumps and brush piles on the ground in the burned strip, he  explained. It would bother a man to get down there now. But he offered  to try it, if he might be excused from the station for a few hours. He  said he would be willing to go down and tell them she was all right,  or, a little later, he might even take a chance of getting her across.  But it would take some time, he was afraid.    Ross seemed to consider the matter for a minute. Then, \"N--o, as long  as she's up there, she'd better stay. We can't spare you to go. You  might call her to the phone--\"    \"I can't. She's off somewhere on the peak, taking in the view,\" Jack  replied. \"She grabbed my sweater and beat it, an hour or so ago, and I  don't know where she went.... No, I don't think she tried that. She  knows she couldn't get there. She said she wanted to see all she could  of it while she had the chance.... What?... Oh, sure, she's got sense  enough to take care of herself, far as that goes. Seems to be one of  the independent kind.... All right. I'll call up if she comes back,  and she can talk to you herself.\"    But he did not call up the supervisor, for Marion did not come back.  At daybreak, when Jack could no longer fight down his uneasiness, and  went to look for her, he found her crouched between two boulders that  offered some shelter from the wind without obstructing the view. She  was huddled in his sweater, shivering a little with the dawn chill but  scarcely conscious of the fact that she was cold. Her lids were  red-rimmed from staring up too long, at the near stars and down at the  remote mountains--as they looked to be that night. She seemed rather  to resent interruption, but in a few minutes she became human and  practical enough to admit that she was hungry, and that she supposed  it was time to think about getting home.    When she got up to follow Jack to the station, she walked stiffly  because of her cramped muscles; but she didn't seem to mind that in  the least. She made only one comment upon her vigil, and that was when  she stopped in the door of the station and looked back at the heaving  cloud of smoke that filled the eastern sky.    \"Well, whatever happens to me from now on, I'll have the comfort of  knowing that for a few hours I have been absolutely happy.\" Then, with  the abruptness that marked her changes of mood, she became the slangy,  pert, feather-headed Marion Rose whom Jack had met first; and remained  so until she left him after breakfast to go home to Kate, who would be  perfectly wild.          CHAPTER TWELVE    KATE FINDS SOMETHING TO WORRY OVER      Kate may have been wild, but if so she managed to maintain an  admirable composure when Marion walked up to the door of the cabin.  She did not greet her best friend with hysterical rejoicings, probably  because she had been told of her best friend's safety soon after dark  the night before, and had since found much to resent in Marion's  predicament and the worry which she had suffered before Marion's  message came.    \"Well!\" she said, and continued brushing her hair. \"Have you had any  breakfast?\"    \"Ages ago. Where's everybody?\" Marion flung down her "]]]
