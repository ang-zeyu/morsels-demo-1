The pilgrims crossed over to the banks of the ninth gulf, where the  Sowers of Scandal, the Schismatics, Heretics, and Founders of False  Religions, underwent the penalties of such as load themselves with the  sins of those whom they seduce.    The first sight they beheld was Mahomet, tearing open his own bowels,  and calling out to them to mark him. Before him walked his son-in-law,  Ali, weeping, and cloven to the chin; and the divisions in the church  were punished in like manner upon all the schismatics in the place. They  all walked round the circle, their gashes closing as they went; and on  their reaching a certain point, a fiend hewed them open again with a  sword. The Arabian prophet, ere he passed on, bade the pilgrims  warn Friar Dolcino how he suffered himself to be surprised in his  mountain-hold by the starvations of winter-time, if he did not wish  speedily to follow him.[35]    Among other mangled wretches, they beheld Piero of Medicina, a sower of  dissension, exhibiting to them his face and throat all over wounds; and  Curio, compelled to shew his tongue cut out for advising Caesar to cross  the Rubicon; and Mosca de' Lamberti, an adviser of assassination, and  one of the authors of the Guelf and Ghibelline miseries, holding up  the bleeding stumps of his arms, which dripped on his face. \"Remember  Mosca,\" cried he; \"remember him, alas! who said, 'A deed done is a thing  ended.' A bad saying of mine was that for the Tuscan nation.\"    \"And death to thy family,\" cried Dante.    The assassin hurried away like a man driven mad with grief upon grief;  and Dante now beheld a sight, which, if it were not, he says, for the  testimony of a good conscience--that best of friends, which gives a  man assurance of himself under the breastplate of a spotless  innocence[36]--he should be afraid to relate without further proof. He  saw--and while he was writing the account of it he still appeared to  see--a headless trunk about to come past him with the others. It held  its severed head by the hair, like a lantern; and the head looked up  at the two pilgrims, and said, \"Woe is me!\" The head was, in fact, a  lantern to the paths of the trunk; and thus there were two separated  things in one, and one in two; and how that could be, he only can tell  who ordained it. As the figure came nearer, it lifted the head aloft,  that the pilgrims might hear better what it said. \"Behold,\" it said,  \"behold, thou that walkest living among the dead, and say if there be  any punishment like this. I am Bertrand de Born, he that incited John  of England to rebel against his father. Father and son I set at  variance--closest affections I set at variance--and hence do I bear my  brain severed from the body on which it grew. In me behold the work of  retribution.\" [37]    The eyes of Dante were so inebriate with all that diversity of bleeding  wounds, that they longed to stay and weep ere his guide proceeded  further. Something also struck them on the sudden which added to his  desire to stop. But Virgil asked what ailed him, and why he stood gazing  still on the wretched multitude. \"Thou hast not done so,\" continued he,  \"in any other portion of this circle; and the valley is twenty-two miles  further about, and the moon already below us. Thou hast more yet to see  than thou wottest of, and the time is short.\"    Dante, excusing himself for the delay, and proceeding to follow his  leader, said he thought he had seen, in the cavern at which he was  gazing so hard, a spirit that was one of his own family--and it was so.  It was the soul of Geri del Bello, a cousin of the poet's. Virgil said  that he had observed him, while Dante was occupied with Bertrand de  Born, pointing at his kinsman in a threatening manner. \"Waste not a  thought on him,\" concluded the Roman, \"but leave him as he is.\" \"O  honoured guide!\" said Dante, \"he died a violent death, which his kinsmen  have not yet avenged; and hence it is that he disdained to speak to me;  and I must needs feel for him the more on that account.\" [38]    They came now to the last partition of the circle of Evil-budget, and  their ears were assailed with such a burst of sharp wailings, that Dante  was fain to close his with his hands. The misery there, accompanied by  a horrible odour, was as if all the hospitals in the sultry marshes of  Valdichiana had brought their maladies together into one infernal ditch.  It was the place of punishment for pretended Alchemists, Coiners,  Personators of other people, False Accusers, and Impostors of all such  descriptions. They lay on one another in heaps, or attempted to crawl  about--some itching madly with leprosies--some swollen and gasping with  dropsies--some wetly reeking, like hands washed in winter-time. One  was an alchemist of Sienna, a nation vainer than the French; another a  Florentine, who tricked a man into making a wrong will; another, Sinon  of Troy; another, Myrrha; another, the wife of Potiphar. Their miseries  did not hinder them from giving one another malignant blows; and Dante  was listening eagerly to an abusive conversation between Sinon and  a Brescian coiner, when Virgil rebuked him for the disgraceful  condescension, and said it was a pleasure fit only for vulgar minds.[39]    The blushing poet felt the reproof so deeply, that he could not speak  for shame, though he manifested by his demeanour that he longed to do  so, and thus obtained the pardon he despaired of. He says he felt like a  man that, during an unhappy dream, wishes himself dreaming while he  is so, and does not know it. Virgil understood his emotion, and, as  Achilles did with his spear, healed the wound with the tongue that  inflicted it.    A silence now ensued between the companions; for they had quitted  Evil-budget, and arrived at the ninth great circle of hell, on the mound  of which they passed along, looking quietly and steadily before them.  Daylight had given place to twilight; and Dante was advancing his head  a little, and endeavouring to discern objects in the distance, when his  whole attention was called to one particular spot, by a blast of a  horn so loud, that a thunder clap was a whisper in comparison. Orlando  himself blew no such terrific blast, after the dolorous rout, when  Charlemagne was defeated in his holy enterprise.[40] The poet raised his  head, thinking he perceived a multitude of lofty towers. He asked Virgil  to what region they belonged; but Virgil said, \"Those are no towers:  they are giants, standing each up to his middle in the pit that goes  round this circle.\" Dante looked harder; and as objects clear up by  little and little in the departing mist, he saw, with alarm, the  tremendous giants that warred against Jove, standing half in and  half out of the pit, like the towers that crowned the citadel of  Monteseggione. The one whom he saw plainest, and who stood with his arms  hanging down on each side, appeared to him to have a face as huge as  the pinnacle of St. Peter's, and limbs throughout in proportion. The  monster, as the pilgrims were going by, opened his dreadful mouth, fit  for no sweeter psalmody, and called after them, in the words of some  unknown tongue, _Rafel, maee amech zabee almee_.[41] \"Dull wretch!\"  exclaimed Virgil, \"keep to thine horn, and so vent better whatsoever  frenzy or other passion stuff thee. Feel the chain round thy throat,  thou confusion! See, what a clenching hoop is about thy gorge!\" Then he  said to Dante, \"His howl is its own mockery. This is Nimrod, he through  whose evil ambition it was that mankind ceased to speak one language.  Pass him, and say nothing; for every other tongue is to him, as his is  to thee.\"    The companions went on for about the length of a sling's throw, when  they passed the second giant, who was much fiercer and linger than  Nimrod. He was fettered round and round with chains, that fixed one arm  before him and the other behind him--Ephialtes his name, the same that  would needs make trial of his strength against Jove himself. The hands  which he then wielded were now motionless, but he shook with passion;  and Dante thought he should have died for terror, the effect on the  ground about him was so fearful. It surpassed that of a tower shaken by  an earthquake. The poet expressed a wish to look at Briareus, but he was  too far off. He saw, however, Antaeus, who, not having fought against  heaven, was neither tongue-confounded nor shackled; and Virgil requested  the \"taker of a thousand lions,\" by the fame which the living poet had  it in his power to give him, to bear the travellers in his arms down the  steep descent into this deeper"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10886"],[0,"The Untamed (#18)"],[1,"Kilduff.    \"What I want to know--\" broke in Terry Jordan.    \"Go to hell with your questions,\" said Silent, \"but until you go there  you'll do what I say, understand?\"    \"Look here, Jim,\" said Hal Purvis, \"are you a king an' we jest your  slaves, maybe?\"    \"You're goin' it a pile too hard,\" said Shorty Rhinehart.    Every one of these speeches came sharply out while they glared at  Jim Silent. Hands were beginning to fall to the hip and fingers were  curving stiffly as if for the draw. Silent leaned his broad shoulders  against the side of his roan and folded his arms. His eyes went round  the circle slowly, lingering an instant on each face. Under that cold  stare they grew uneasy. To Shorty Rhinehart it became necessary to  push back his hat and scratch his forehead. Terry Jordan found a  mysterious business with his bandana. Every one of them had occasion  to raise his hand from the neighbourhood of his six-shooter. Silent  smiled.    \"A fine, hard crew you are,\" he said sarcastically at last. \"A great  bunch of long riders, lettin' a slip of a yaller-haired girl make  fools of you. You over there--you, Shorty Rhinehart, you'd cut the  throat of a man that looked crosswise at the Cumberland girl, wouldn't  you? An' you, Purvis, you're aching to get at me, ain't you? An'  you're still thinkin' of them blue eyes, Jordan?\"    Before any one could speak he poured in another volley between wind  and water: \"One slip of a girl can make fools out of five long riders?  No, you ain't long riders. All you c'n handle is hobby hosses!\"    \"What do you want us to do?\" growled swarthy Bill Kilduff.    \"Keep your face shut while I'm talkin', that's what I want you to do!\"    There was a devil of rage in his eyes. His folded arms tugged at each  other, and if they got free there would be gun play. The four men  shrank, and he was satisfied.    \"Now I'll tell you what we're goin' to do,\" he went on. \"We're goin'  out after Haines an' the girl. If they come up with this Whistlin' Dan  we're goin' to surround him an' fill him full of lead, while they're  talkin'.\"    \"Not for a million dollars!\" burst in Hal Purvis.    \"Not in a thousan' years!\" echoed Terry Jordan.    Silent turned his watchful eyes from one to the other. They were ready  to fight now, and he sensed it at once.    \"Why?\" he asked calmly.    \"It ain't playin' square with the girl,\" announced Rhinehart.    \"Purvis,\" said Silent, for he knew that the opposition centred in the  figure of the venomous little gun fighter; \"if you seen a mad dog  that was runnin' straight at you, would you be kep' from shootin' it  because a pretty girl hollered out an' asked you not to?\"    Their eyes shifted rapidly from one to another, seeking a way out, and  finding none.    \"An' is there any difference between this hero Whistlin' Dan an' a mad  dog?\"    Still they were mute.    \"I tell you, boys, we got a better chance of dodgin' lightnin' an'  puttin' a bloodhound off our trail than we have of gettin' rid of this  Whistlin' Dan. An' when he catches up with us--well, all I'm askin' is  that you remember what he done to them four dollars before they hit  the dust?\"    \"The chief's right,\" growled Kilduff, staring down at the ground.  \"It's Whistlin' Dan or us. The mountains ain't big enough to hold him  an' us!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Before Whistling Dan the great wolf glided among the trees. For a full  hour they had wandered through the willows in this manner, and Dan had  made up his mind to surrender the search when Bart, returning from  one of his noiseless detours, sprang out before his master and whined  softly. Dan turned, loosening his revolver in the holster, and  followed Bart through the soft gloom of the tree shadows and the  moonlight. His step was almost as silent as that of the slinking  animal which went before. At last the wolf stopped and raised his  head. Almost instantly Dan saw a man and a woman approaching through  the willows. The moonlight dropped across her face. He recognized  Kate, with Lee Haines walking a pace before her.    \"Stand where you are,\" he said.    Haines leaped to one side, his revolver flashing in his hand. Dan  stepped out before them while Black Bart slunk close beside him,  snarling softly.    He seemed totally regardless of the gun in Haines's hand. His manner  was that of a conqueror who had the outlaw at his mercy.    \"You,\" he said, \"walk over there to the side of the clearing.\"    \"Dan!\" cried Kate, as she went to him with extended arms.    He stopped her with a gesture, his eyes upon Haines, who had moved  away.    \"Watch him, Bart,\" said Dan.    The black wolf ran to Haines and crouched snarling at his feet. The  outlaw restored his revolver to his holster and stood with his arms  folded, his back turned. Dan looked to Kate. At the meeting of their  eyes she shrank a little. She had expected a difficult task in  persuading him, but not this hard aloofness. She felt suddenly as if  she were a stranger to him.    \"How do you come here--with him?\"    \"He is my friend!\"    \"You sure pick a queer place to go walkin' with him.\"    \"Hush, Dan! He brought me here to find you!\"    \"_He_ brought you here?\"    \"Don't you understand?\"    \"When I want a friend like him, I'll go huntin' for him myself; an'  I'll pack a gun with me!\"    That flickering yellow light played behind Dan's eyes.    \"I looked into his face--an' he stared the other way.\"    She made a little imploring gesture, but his hand remained on his  hips, and there was no softening of his voice.    \"What fetched you here?\"    Every word was like a hand that pushed her farther away.    \"Are you dumb, Kate? What fetched you here?\"    \"I have come to bring you home, Dan.\"    \"I'm home now.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"There's the roof of my house,\" he jerked his hand towards the sky,  \"the mountain passes are my doors--an' the earth is my floor.\"    \"No! no! We are waiting for you at the ranch.\"    He shrugged his shoulders.    \"Dan, this wild trail has no end.\"    \"Maybe, but I know that feller can show me the way to Jim Silent, an'  now----\"    He turned towards Haines as he spoke, but here a low, venomous snarl  from Black Bart checked his words. Kate saw him stiffen--his lips  parted to a faint smile--his head tilted back a little as if he  listened intently, though she could hear nothing. She was not a yard  from him, and yet she felt a thousand miles away. His head turned full  upon her, and she would never forget the yellow light of his eyes.    \"Dan!\" she cried, but her voice was no louder than a whisper.    \"Delilah!\" he said, and leaped back into the shade of the willows.    Even as he sprang she saw the flash of the moonlight on his drawn  revolver, and fire spat from it twice, answered by a yell of pain,  the clang of a bullet on metal, and half a dozen shots from the woods  behind her.    That word \"Delilah!\" rang in her brain to the exclusion of all the  world. Vaguely she heard voices shouting--she turned a little and saw  Haines facing her with his revolver in his hand, but prevented from  moving by the wolf who crouched snarling at his feet. The order of his  master kept him there even after that master was gone. Now men ran out  into the clearing. A keen whistle sounded far off among the willows,  and the wolf leaped away from his prisoner and into the shadows on the  trail of Dan.           *       *       *       *       *    Tex Calder prided himself on being a light sleeper. Years spent in  constant danger enabled him to keep his sense of hearing alert even  when he slept. He had never been surprised. It was his boast that he  never would be. Therefore when a hand dropped lightly on his shoulder  he started erect from his blankets with a curse and grasped his  revolver. A strong grip on his wrist paralysed his fingers. Whistling  Dan leaned above him.    \"Wake up,\" said the latter.    \"What the devil--\" breathed the marshal. \"You travel like a cloud  shadow, Dan. You make no sound.\"    \"Wake up and talk to me.\"    \"I'm awake all right. What's happened?\"    There was a moment of silence while Dan seemed to be trying for  speech.    Black Bart, at the other side of the clearing, pointed his nose at  the yellow moon and wailed. He was very close, but the sound was so  controlled that it seemed to come at a great distance from some wild  spirit wandering between earth and heaven.    Instead of speaking Dan jumped to his feet and commenced pacing up and  down, up and down, a rapid, tireless stride; at his heels the wolf  slunk, with lowered head and tail. The strange fellow was in some  great trouble, Calder could see, and it stirred him mightily to know  that the wild man had turned to him for help. Yet he would ask no  questions.    When in doubt the cattleman rolls a cigarette, and that was what  Calder did. He smoked and waited. At last the inevitable came.    \"How old are you, Tex?\"    \"Forty-four.\"    \"That's a good deal. You ought to know something.\"    \"Maybe.\"    \"About women?\"    \"Ah!\" said Calder.    \"Bronchos is cut out chiefly after one pattern,\" went on Dan.    \"They's chiefly jest meanness. Are women the same--jest cut after one  pattern?\"    \"What pattern, Dan?\"    \"The pattern of Delilah! They ain't no trust to be put in 'em?\"    \"A good many of us have found that out.\"    \"I thought one woman was different from the rest.\"    \"We all think that. Woman in particular is divine; woman in general  is--hell!\"    \"Ay, but this one--\" He stopped and set his teeth.    \"What has she done?\"    \"She--\" he hesitated, and when he spoke again his voice did not  tremble; there was a deep hurt and wonder in it: \"She double-crossed  me!\"    \"When? Do you mean to say you've met a woman tonight out here among  the willows?--Where--how----\"    \"Tex----!\"    \"Ay, Dan.\"    \"It's--it's hell!\"    \"It is now. But you'll forget her! The mountains, the desert, and  above all, time--they'll cure you, my boy.\"    \"Not in a whole century, Tex."]]]
