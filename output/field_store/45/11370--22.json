I earnestly warn you against those who, by advertisement in the  papers, offer to cure young men who are suffering from weakness of the  private parts and other ills which impurity entails. Many such  advertisers are little better than rogues, who are out to make money  by trading on the fears of their victims; their \"treatment\"--quite  apart from a far greater cost than at first appears--often does more  harm than good. In every case in which disease or weakness exists, or  is suspected, a reliable medical man should be at once consulted. If  this is done, a cure may generally be looked for. Do not write to me;  this is a doctor's business, not mine."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1377"],[0,"The Talisman (#18)"],[1,"   This chief had been exercised in almost all the wars, whether waged  betwixt England and Scotland, or amongst the various domestic factions  which then tore the former country asunder, and in all had been  distinguished, as well from his military conduct as his personal  prowess. He was, in other respects, a rude soldier, blunt and careless  in his bearing, and taciturn--nay, almost sullen--in his habits of  society, and seeming, at least, to disclaim all knowledge of policy and  of courtly art. There were men, however, who pretended to look deeply  into character, who asserted that the Lord de Vaux was not less shrewd  and aspiring than he was blunt and bold, and who thought that, while he  assimilated himself to the king's own character of blunt hardihood, it  was, in some degree at least, with an eye to establish his favour, and  to gratify his own hopes of deep-laid ambition. But no one cared to  thwart his schemes, if such he had, by rivalling him in the dangerous  occupation of daily attendance on the sick-bed of a patient whose  disease was pronounced infectious, and more especially when it was  remembered that the patient was Coeur de Lion, suffering under all the  furious impatience of a soldier withheld from battle, and a sovereign  sequestered from authority; and the common soldiers, at least in the  English army, were generally of opinion that De Vaux attended on  the King like comrade upon comrade, in the honest and disinterested  frankness of military friendship contracted between the partakers of  daily dangers.    It was on the decline of a Syrian day that Richard lay on his couch of  sickness, loathing it as much in mind as his illness made it irksome to  his body. His bright blue eye, which at all times shone with uncommon  keenness and splendour, had its vivacity augmented by fever and mental  impatience, and glanced from among his curled and unshorn locks of  yellow hair as fitfully and as vividly as the last gleams of the sun  shoot through the clouds of an approaching thunderstorm, which still,  however, are gilded by its beams. His manly features showed the  progress of wasting illness, and his beard, neglected and untrimmed,  had overgrown both lips and chin. Casting himself from side to side, now  clutching towards him the coverings, which at the next moment he flung  as impatiently from him, his tossed couch and impatient gestures showed  at once the energy and the reckless impatience of a disposition whose  natural sphere was that of the most active exertion.    Beside his couch stood Thomas de Vaux, in face, attitude, and manner  the strongest possible contrast to the suffering monarch. His stature  approached the gigantic, and his hair in thickness might have resembled  that of Samson, though only after the Israelitish champion's locks had  passed under the shears of the Philistines, for those of De Vaux were  cut short, that they might be enclosed under his helmet. The light of  his broad, large hazel eye resembled that of the autumn morn; and it was  only perturbed for a moment, when from time to time it was attracted by  Richard's vehement marks of agitation and restlessness. His features,  though massive like his person, might have been handsome before they  were defaced with scars; his upper lip, after the fashion of the  Normans, was covered with thick moustaches, which grew so long and  luxuriantly as to mingle with his hair, and, like his hair, were dark  brown, slightly brindled with grey. His frame seemed of that kind which  most readily defies both toil and climate, for he was thin-flanked,  broad-chested, long-armed, deep-breathed, and strong-limbed. He had not  laid aside his buff-coat, which displayed the cross cut on the shoulder,  for more than three nights, enjoying but such momentary repose as the  warder of a sick monarch's couch might by snatches indulge. This Baron  rarely changed his posture, except to administer to Richard the medicine  or refreshments which none of his less favoured attendants could  persuade the impatient monarch to take; and there was something  affecting in the kindly yet awkward manner in which he discharged  offices so strangely contrasted with his blunt and soldierly habits and  manners.    The pavilion in which these personages were, had, as became the time,  as well as the personal character of Richard, more of a warlike than a  sumptuous or royal character. Weapons offensive and defensive, several  of them of strange and newly-invented construction, were scattered about  the tented apartment, or disposed upon the pillars which supported it.  Skins of animals slain in the chase were stretched on the ground, or  extended along the sides of the pavilion; and upon a heap of  these silvan spoils lay three ALANS, as they were then called  (wolf-greyhounds, that is), of the largest size, and as white as snow.  Their faces, marked with many a scar from clutch and fang, showed their  share in collecting the trophies upon which they reposed; and their  eyes, fixed from time to time with an expressive stretch and yawn upon  the bed of Richard, evinced how much they marvelled at and regretted the  unwonted inactivity which they were compelled to share. These were but  the accompaniments of the soldier and huntsman; but on a small table  close by the bed was placed a shield of wrought steel, of triangular  form, bearing the three lions passant first assumed by the chivalrous  monarch, and before it the golden circlet, resembling much a ducal  coronet, only that it was higher in front than behind, which, with  the purple velvet and embroidered tiara that lined it, formed then the  emblem of England's sovereignty. Beside it, as if prompt for defending  the regal symbol, lay a mighty curtal-axe, which would have wearied the  arm of any other than Coeur de Lion.    In an outer partition of the pavilion waited two or three officers of  the royal household, depressed, anxious for their master's health, and  not less so for their own safety, in case of his decease. Their gloomy  apprehensions spread themselves to the warders without, who paced about  in downcast and silent contemplation, or, resting on their halberds,  stood motionless on their post, rather like armed trophies than living  warriors.    \"So thou hast no better news to bring me from without, Sir Thomas!\"  said the King, after a long and perturbed silence, spent in the feverish  agitation which we have endeavoured to describe. \"All our knights turned  women, and our ladies become devotees, and neither a spark of valour nor  of gallantry to enlighten a camp which contains the choicest of Europe's  chivalry--ha!\"    \"The truce, my lord,\" said De Vaux, with the same patience with which  he had twenty times repeated the explanation--\"the truce prevents us  bearing ourselves as men of action; and for the ladies, I am no great  reveller, as is well known to your Majesty, and seldom exchange steel  and buff for velvet and gold--but thus far I know, that our choicest  beauties are waiting upon the Queen's Majesty and the Princess, to a  pilgrimage to the convent of Engaddi, to accomplish their vows for your  Highness's deliverance from this trouble.\"    \"And is it thus,\" said Richard, with the impatience of indisposition,  \"that royal matrons and maidens should risk themselves, where the dogs  who defile the land have as little truth to man as they have faith  towards God?\"    \"Nay, my lord,\" said De Vaux, \"they have Saladin's word for their  safety.\"    \"True, true!\" replied Richard; \"and I did the heathen Soldan  injustice--I owe him reparation for it. Would God I were but fit  to offer it him upon my body between the two hosts--Christendom and  heathenesse both looking on!\"    As Richard spoke, he thrust his right arm out of bed naked to the  shoulder, and painfully raising himself in his couch, shook his clenched  hand, as if it grasped sword or battle-axe, and was then brandished over  the jewelled turban of the Soldan. It was not without a gentle degree of  violence, which the King would scarce have endured from another, that  De Vaux, in his character of sick-nurse, compelled his royal master  to replace himself in the couch, and covered his sinewy arm, neck, and  shoulders with the care which a mother bestows upon an impatient child.    \"Thou art a rough nurse, though a willing one, De Vaux,\" said the King,  laughing with a bitter expression, while he submitted to the strength  which he was unable to resist; \"methinks a coif would become thy  lowering features as well as a child's biggin would beseem mine. We  should be a babe and nurse to frighten girls with.\"    \"We have frightened men in our time, my liege,\" said De Vaux; \"and, I  trust, may live to frighten them again. What is a fever-fit, that we  should not endure it patiently, in order to get rid of it easily?\"    \"Fever-fit!\" exclaimed Richard impetuously; \"thou mayest think, and  justly, that it is a fever-fit with me; but what is it with all the  other Christian princes--with Philip of France, with that dull Austrian,  with him of Montserrat, with the Hospitallers, with the Templars--what  is it with all them? I will tell thee. It is a cold palsy, a dead  lethargy, a disease that deprives them of speech and action, a canker  that has eaten into the heart of all that is noble, and chivalrous, and  virtuous among them--that has made them false to the noblest vow ever  knights were sworn to--has made them indifferent to their fame, and  forgetful of their God!\"    \"For the love of Heaven, my liege,\" said De Vaux, \"take it less  violently--you will be heard without doors, where such speeches are but  too current already among the common soldiery, and engender discord and  contention in the Christian host. Bethink you that your illness mars the  mainspring of their enterprise; a mangonel will work without screw and  lever better than the Christian host without King Richard.\"    \"Thou flatterest me, De Vaux,\" said Richard, and"]]]
