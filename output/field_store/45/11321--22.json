I lastly was with Curtis among the floating batt'ries,       And there I left for witness an arm and a limb;       Yet let my country need me, with Elliot to head me,       I'd clatter on my stumps at the sound of a drum.         And now tho' I must beg, with a wooden arm and leg,       And many a tatter'd rag hanging over my bum,       I'm as happy with my wallet, my bottle, and my callet,       As when I used in scarlet to follow a drum.         What tho' with hoary locks, I must stand the winter shocks,       Beneath the woods and rocks oftentimes for a home,       When the t'other bag I sell, and the t'other bottle tell,       I could meet a troop of hell, at the sound of a drum.

But the godly old chaplain left him in the lurch;       The sword I forsook for the sake of the church:       He ventur'd the soul, and I risked the body,       'Twas then I proved false to my sodger laddie.         Full soon I grew sick of my sanctified sot,       The regiment at large for a husband I got;       From the gilded spontoon to the fife I was ready,       I asked no more but a sodger laddie.

Just as we were nearing the river, an unknown  horseman from the south overtook our herd. It was evident that he  belonged to some through herd and was looking out the crossing. He  made himself useful by lending a hand while our herd was fording, and  in a brief conversation with Flood, informed him that he was one of  the hands with a \"Running W\" herd, gave the name of Bill Mann as their  foreman, the number of cattle they were driving, and reported the herd  as due to reach the river the next morning. He wasted little time with  us, but recrossed the river, returning to his herd, while we grazed  out four or five miles and camped for the night.    I shall never forget the impression left in my mind of that first  morning after we crossed Red River into the Indian lands. The country  was as primitive as in the first day of its creation. The trail led up  a divide between the Salt and North forks of Red River. To the  eastward of the latter stream lay the reservation of the Apaches,  Kiowas, and Comanches, the latter having been a terror to the  inhabitants of western Texas. They were a warlike tribe, as the  records of the Texas Rangers and government troops will verify, but  their last effective dressing down was given them in a fight at Adobe  Walls by a party of buffalo hunters whom they hoped to surprise. As we  wormed our way up this narrow divide, there was revealed to us a  panorama of green-swarded plain and timber-fringed watercourse, with  not a visible evidence that it had ever been invaded by civilized man,  save cattlemen with their herds. Antelope came up in bands and  gratified their curiosity as to who these invaders might be, while old  solitary buffalo bulls turned tail at our approach and lumbered away  to points of safety. Very few herds had ever passed over this route,  but buffalo trails leading downstream, deep worn by generations of  travel, were to be seen by hundreds on every hand. We were not there  for a change of scenery or for our health, so we may have overlooked  some of the beauties of the landscape. But we had a keen eye for the  things of our craft. We could see almost back to the river, and  several times that morning noticed clouds of dust on the horizon.  Flood noticed them first. After some little time the dust clouds arose  clear and distinct, and we were satisfied that the \"Running W\" herd  had forded and were behind us, not more than ten or twelve miles away.    At dinner that noon, Flood said he had a notion to go back and pay  Mann a visit. \"Why, I've not seen 'Little-foot' Bill Mann,\" said our  foreman, as he helped himself to a third piece of \"fried chicken\"  (bacon), \"since we separated two years ago up at Ogalalla on the  Platte. I'd just like the best in the world to drop back and sleep in  his blankets one night and complain of his chuck. Then I'd like to  tell him how we had passed them, starting ten days' drive farther  south. He must have been amongst those herds laying over on the  Brazos.\"    \"Why don't you go, then?\" said Fox Quarternight. \"Half the outfit  could hold the cattle now with the grass and water we're in at  present.\"    \"I'll go you one for luck,\" said our foreman. \"Wrangler, rustle in  your horses the minute you're through eating. I'm going visiting.\"    We all knew what horse he would ride, and when he dropped his rope on  \"Alazanito,\" he had not only picked his own mount of twelve, but the  top horse of the entire _remuda_,--a chestnut sorrel, fifteen hands  and an inch in height, that drew his first breath on the prairies of  Texas. No man who sat him once could ever forget him. Now, when the  trail is a lost occupation, and reverie and reminiscence carry the  mind back to that day, there are friends and faces that may he  forgotten, but there are horses that never will be. There were  emergencies in which the horse was everything, his rider merely the  accessory. But together, man and horse, they were the force that made  it possible to move the millions of cattle which passed up and over  the various trails of the West.    When we had caught our horses for the afternoon, and Flood had saddled  and was ready to start, he said to us, \"You fellows just mosey along  up the trail. I'll not be gone long, but when I get back I shall  expect to find everything running smooth. An outfit that can't run  itself without a boss ought to stay at home and do the milking. So  long, fellows!\"    The country was well watered, and when rounded the cattle into the bed  ground that night, they were actually suffering from stomachs gorged  with grass and water. They went down and to sleep like tired children;  one man could have held them that night. We all felt good, and McCann  got up an extra spread for supper. We even had dried apples for  dessert. McCann had talked the storekeeper at Doan's, where we got our  last supplies, out of some extras as a _pelon_. Among them was a can  of jam. He sprung this on us as a surprise. Bob Blades toyed with the  empty can in mingled admiration and disgust over a picture on the  paper label. It was a supper scene, every figure wearing full dress.  \"Now, that's General Grant,\" said he, pointing with his finger, \"and  this is Tom Ochiltree. I can't quite make out this other duck, but I  reckon he's some big auger--a senator or governor, maybe. Them old  girls have got their gall with them. That style of dress is what you  call _lo_ and _behold_. The whole passel ought to be ashamed. And they  seem to be enjoying themselves, too.\"    Though it was a lovely summer night, we had a fire, and supper over,  the conversation ranged wide and free. As the wagon on the trail is  home, naturally the fire is the hearthstone, so we gathered and  lounged around it.    \"The only way to enjoy such a fine night as this,\" remarked Ash, \"is  to sit up smoking until you fall asleep with your boots on. Between  too much sleep and just enough, there's a happy medium which suits  me.\"    \"Officer,\" inquired Wyatt Roundtree, trailing into the conversation  very innocently, \"why is it that people who live up among those  Yankees always say 'be' the remainder of their lives?\"    \"What's the matter with the word?\" countered Officer.    \"Oh, nothing, I reckon, only it sounds a little odd, and there's a  tale to it.\"    \"A story, you mean,\" said Officer, reprovingly.    \"Well, I'll tell it to you,\" said Roundtree, \"and then you can call it  to suit yourself. It was out in New Mexico where this happened. There  was a fellow drifted into the ranch where I was working, dead broke.  To make matters worse, he could do nothing; he wouldn't fit anywhere.  Still, he was a nice fellow and we all liked him. Must have had a good  education, for he had good letters from people up North. He had worked  in stores and had once clerked in a bank, at least the letters said  so. Well, we put up a job to get him a place in a little town out on  the railroad. You all know how clannish Kentuckians are. Let two meet  who never saw each other before, and inside of half an hour they'll be  chewing tobacco from the same plug and trying to loan each other  money.\"    \"That's just like them,\" interposed Fox Quarternight.    \"Well, there was an old man lived in this town, who was the genuine  blend of bluegrass and Bourbon. If another Kentuckian came within  twenty miles of him, and he found it out, he'd hunt him up and they'd  hold a two-handed reunion. We put up the job that this young man  should play that he was a Kentuckian, hoping that the old man would  take him to his bosom and give him something to do. So we took him  into town one day, coached and fully posted how to act and play his  part. We met the old man in front of his place of business, and, after  the usual comment on the news over our way, weather, and other small  talk, we were on the point of passing on, when one of our own crowd  turned back and inquired, 'Uncle Henry, have you met the young  Kentuckian who's in the country?'    \"'No,' said the old man, brightening with interest, 'who is he and  where is he?'    \"'He's in town somewhere,' volunteered one of the boys. We pretended  to survey the street from where we stood, when one of the boys blurted  out, 'Yonder he stands now. That fellow in front of the drug store  over there, with the hard-boiled hat on.'    \"The old man started for him, angling across the street, in disregard  of sidewalks. We watched the meeting, thinking it was working all  right. We were mistaken. We saw them shake hands, when the old man  turned and walked away very haughtily. Something had gone wrong. He  took the sidewalk on his return, and when he came near enough to us,  we could see that he was angry and on the prod. When he came near  enough to speak, he said, 'You think you're smart, don't you? He's a  Kentuckian, is he? Hell's full of such Kentuckians!' And as he passed  beyond hearing he was muttering imprecations on us. The young fellow  joined us a minute later with the question, 'What kind of a crank is  that you ran me up against?'    \"'He's as nice a man as there is in this country,' said one of the  crowd. 'What did you say to him?'    \"'Nothing'; he came up to me, extended his hand, saying, \"My young  friend, I understand that you're from Kentucky.\" \"I be, sir,\" I  replied, when he looked me in the eye and said, \"You're a G---- d----  liar,\" and turned and walked away. Why, he must have wanted to insult  me. And then we all knew why our little scheme had failed. There was  food and raiment in it for him, but he would use that little word  'be.'\"    \"Did any of you notice my saddle horse lie down just after we crossed  this last creek this afternoon?\" inquired Rod Wheat.    \"No; what made him lie down?\" asked several of the boys.    \"Oh, he just found a gopher hole and stuck his forefeet into it one at  a time, and then tried to pull them both out"]]]
