Not all are called to motherhood in the literal sense, but all      are called to the great, true motherhood in some of its manifold      trusts and obligations. \"_Noblesse oblige_;\" you can not lay it      down. \"More are the children of the desolate than of her who hath      a husband.\" All the little children that are born must look to      womanhood somewhere for mothering. Do they all get it? All the      works and policies of men look back somewhere for a true \"desire\"      toward and by which only they can rule. Is the desire of the      woman--of the home, the mother-motive of the world and human      living--kept in the integrity and beauty for which it was      intrusted to her, that it might move the power of man to noble      ends?        Do you ask the governing of the nation? You have the making of      the nation. Would you choose your statesmen? First make your      statesmen.        Indeed the whole cause on trial may be summarily ended by the      proving of an alibi, an elsewhere of demand. Is woman needed at      the caucuses, conventions, polls? She is needed, at the same time,      elsewhere. Two years of time and strength, of thought and love,      from some woman, are essential for every little human being, that      he may even begin a life. When you remember that every man is once      a little child, born of a woman, trained--or needing training--at      a woman's hands; that of the little men, every one of whom takes      and shapes his life so, come at length the hand for the helm, the      voice for the law, and the arm to enforce law--what do you want      more for a woman's opportunity and control?        Which would you choose as a force, an advantage, in settling      any question of public moment, or as touching your own private      interest through the general management--the right to go upon      election day and cast one vote, or a hold beforehand upon the      individual ear and attention of each voter now qualified? The      ability to present to him your argument, to show him the real      point at issue, to convince and persuade him of the right and      lasting, instead of the weak and briefly politic way? This initial      privilege is in the hands of woman; assuming that she can be      brought to feel and act as a unit, which appears to be what is      claimed for her in the argument for her regeneration of the outer      political word.        But already and separately, if every intelligent, conscientious      woman can but reach one man, and influence him from the principle      involved--from her interior perception of it, kept pure on purpose      from bias and temptation that assail him in the outside mix and      jostle--will she not have done her work without the casting of a      ballot? And what becomes of \"taxation without representation,\"      when, from Eden down, Eve can always plead with Adam, can have the      first word instead of the last--if she knows what that first word      is, in herself and thence in its power with him--can beguile him      to his good instead of to his harm, as indeed she only meant to do      in that first ignorant experiment? Would it be any less easy to      qualify for and accomplish this than to convince and outnumber in      public gathering not only bodies of men but the mass of women that      will also have to be confronted and convinced or overborne?        Preconceived opinions, minds made up, men not so easily beguiled      to the pure good, you say? Woman quite as apt to make mistakes out      of Paradise as in? That only returns us to the primal need and      opportunity. Get the man to listen to you before his mind is made      up--before his manhood is made up; while it is in the making. That      is just the power and place that belong to you, and you must seize      and fill. It is your natural right; God gave it to you. \"The seed      of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head.\"        We can not do all in one day, and in such a day of the world as      this. We plant trees for posterity where forests have been laid      waste and the beautiful work of life is to be done over again; we      can not expect to see our fruit in souls and in the nation at less      cost of faith and time. Take care, then, of the little children:      the men children, to make men of them; the women children--oh,      yes, even above all--to make ready for future mothering--to snatch      from the evil that works over against pure womanliness. Until you      have done this let men fend for themselves in rough outsides a      little longer; except, perhaps, as wise, able women whom the      trying transition time calls forth may find fit way and place for      effort and protest--there is always room for that, and noble work      has been and is being done; but do not rear a new generation of      women to expect and desire charges and responsibilities reversive      of their own life-law, through whose perfect fulfillment alone may      the future clean place be made for all to work in.        Is there excess of female population? Can not all expect the      direct rule of a home? Is not this exactly, perhaps, just now,      for the more universal remedial mothering that in this age is the      thing immediately needed? Let her who has no child seek where she      can help the burdened mother of many; how she can best reach with      influence, and wisdom, and cherishing, the greatest number--or      most efficiently a few--of these dear, helpless, terrible little      souls, who are to make, in a few years, a new social condition; a      better and higher, happier and safer, or a lower, worse, bitterer,      more desperately complicated and distressful one.        \"Desire earnestly the best gifts,\" said Saint Paul, after      enumerating the gifts of teaching and prophecy and authority; \"and      I show you,\" he goes on, \"a yet more excellent way.\" Charity--not      mere alms, or toleration, or general benignity, out of a safe      self-provision; but _caritas_--nearness, and caring, and      loving,--the very essence of mothering; the way to and hold of      the heart of it all, the heart of the life of humanity. \"Keep thy      heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.\"      That is the first word; it charges womanhood itself, which must be      set utterly right before it can take hold to right the world. Here      are at once task and mission and rewarding sway.        Woman has got off the track; she must see that first, and replace      herself. We are mothering the world still; but we are mothering      it, in a fearfully wide measure, all wrong.        Sacrifice is the beginning of all redemption. We must give up. We      must even give up the wish and seeming to have a hand in things,      that we may work unseen in the elements, and make them fit and      healthful; that daily bread and daily life may be sweet again      in dear, old, homely ways, and plentiful with all truly blessed      opportunities. We are not to organize the world, or to conquer it,      or to queen it. We are just to take it again and mother it. If      woman would begin that, search out the cradles--of life and      character--and take care of the whole world of fifty years hence      in taking care of them, calling upon men and the state, when      needful, to authorize her action and furnish outward means for      it--I wonder what might come, as earnest of good, even in this our      day, in which we know not our visitation?        And here again come allowance and exception for what women can      always do when this world-mothering forces an appeal to the      strength and authority of man. Women have never been prevented      from doing their real errands in the world, even outside the      domestic boundary. They have defended their husbands' castles in      the old chivalrous times, when the male chivalry was away at the      crusades. They have headed armies when Heaven called them; only      Heaven never called all the women at once; but when the king was      crowned, the mission done, they have turned back with desire to      their sheltered, gentle, unobtrusive life again. There has no      business to be a standing army of women; not even a standing      political army. Women have navigated and brought home ships when      commanders have died or been stricken helpless upon the ocean;      they have done true, intelligent, patient work for science, art,      religion; and those have done the most who have never stopped to      contend first, whether a woman, as such, may do it or not.        Look at what Dorothea Dix has done, single-handed, single-mouthed,      in asylums and before legislatures. Women have sat on thrones, and      governed kingdoms well, when that was the station in life to which      God called them. If Victoria of England has been anything, she has      been the mother of her land; she has been queen and protecting      genius of its womanhood and homes. And when a woman does these      things, as called of God--not talks of them, as to whether she may      make claim to do them--she carries a weight from the very sanctity      out of which she steps, as woman, that moves men unlike the moving      of any other power. Shall she resign the chance of doing really      great things, of meeting grand crises, by making herself common in      ward-rooms and at street-corners, and abolishing the perfect idea      of home by no longer consecrating herself to it?        If individual woman, as has been said, may gain and influence      individual man, and so the man-power in affairs--a body of women,      purely as such, with cause, and plea, and reason, can always have      the ear and attention of bodies of men; but to do this they must      come straight from their home sanctities, as representing them--as      able to represent them otherwise than men, because of their "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11115"],[0,"Frank Merriwell at Yale; Or, Freshman Against Freshman (#18)"],[1,"?\" asked Browning.    \"No,\" panted Frank, who could dimly see his opponent through a thick  haze which seemed to hang before his eyes.    \"Then why don't you get up?\"    \"I--I'm going to.\"    Setting his teeth, he did so, but Rattleton caught Browning by the  collar and flung him aside as the big soph sprang at Frank.    \"You are hurt, old man!\" insisted Harry. \"I saw the fellow when he  tripped you. It wasn't a fair thing. You are in no condition to meet  Browning now. Wait till you get your wind.\"    \"I must meet him!\" cried Frank. \"He'll say he did me up if I do not.\"    \"Then he'll lie. It's all right. You do as I say.\"    Frank tried to resist, but Rattleton dragged him aside, being able to do  so because Browning found himself occupied by a little freshman who  stuffily blocked his way, declaring that Merriwell should have a show.    Frank was more than disgusted by the result of the affair. He felt that  he must have it out with Browning then and there, and he made desperate  attempts to break from Harry. Ordinarily he would have succeeded with  the greatest ease, but the fall had robbed him of his strength.    Then came the knowledge that the freshmen had been repulsed. The  sophomores were cheering wildly, and the unfortunate freshmen were  downcast.    \"They've held us out,\" muttered Harry, bitterly. \"It begins to look as  if we'll have to climb over the fence if we get inside.\"    \"What's that?\" cried Frank, bracing up a little. \"Climb the fence? Not  much!\"    \"Then how'll we get in? Will you tell me that?\"    \"We'll find a way.\"    \"Wind a fay!\" spluttered Harry excitedly. \"It's easy enough to say that,  but I don't believe we can do it.\"    \"Oh, freshies! oh, you poor freshies!\" tauntingly cried the victors.  \"Don't you wish you could? But you can't do it, you know!\"    \"That remains to be seen,\" muttered Merriwell, brushing the hair back  from his eyes. \"I didn't think we could do it in this way. But there are  others.\"    \"You'll be a dandy if you devise a way,\" declared Little.    Diamond, with his coat off, his vest ripped up the back and his shirt  torn open at the throat, was regarding the jeering sophomores with a  fierce, sullen look. Evidently he was ready for anything. He glanced at  Merriwell, but said nothing.    Frank called the freshmen around him.    \"Look here, fellows,\" he said, \"we are bound to go into that park, and  we're going through that gate.\"    \"That sounds well,\" said Dismal Jones, who wore an unusually long face,  \"but I'm inclined to believe we're not in it with that crowd.\"    \"Guess again!\" exclaimed Frank. \"Now listen to me, and I don't want one  of you to look around. You might arouse suspicion if you did. Close to  the wall there lies a long stick of timber.\"    \"Well?\"    \"We'll use it.\"    \"How?\"    \"As a battering-ram.\"    \"To batter down the gate? Why, how are we to get to the gate?\"    \"The timber will take us there, and it will open the gate. When I give  the word we will rush for it, pick it up, and sail right into the sophs.  I'll bet anything they get out of the way when they see us coming with  that. It will take them by surprise.\"    \"'Rah! 'rah! 'rah!\" yelled several of the enthusiastic freshmen.    The sophomores yelled back at them in derision.    \"They think we are beaten now,\" said Diamond, whose face had lighted up  somewhat as he listened to Merriwell's plan. \"If we only can get the  best of them that way!\"    \"We can and we will,\" assured Frank. \"Those who can't get hold of the  timber may look out that they don't hook our men away from it. That is  all.\"    The freshmen became eager for the effort, but Frank held them back till  he was certain they all understood just what was to be done.    \"Are you ready?\" he finally asked.    \"All ready,\" was the eager reply.    \"Then go!\"    The sophomores were astonished to see the freshmen suddenly whirl all  together and rush toward the wall.    \"They're going over! They're going over!\"    The sophomores shouted their satisfaction and delight, fully convinced  that they had forced the freshmen to abandon all hope of going through  the gate.    Then came a surprise for them.    The freshmen caught up the timber, and Merriwell cried:    \"Charge!\"    Like a tornado they bore down on the men near the gate, toward which the  timber was directed.    With cries of amazement the alarmed sophomores broke and scattered  before the oncoming freshmen.    Crash!    The timber struck the gate, bursting it open instantly, and the  triumphant freshmen swarmed into the park, cheering wildly.    \"Hurrah for 'Umpty-eight!\" yelled Bandy Robinson, turning a handspring.  \"We are the boys to do 'em!\"    \"Hurrah for Frank Merriwell!\" shouted Harry Rattleton, his face beaming  with joy. \"It was his scheme that did it.\"    \"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!\" roared the freshmen. \"'Rah! 'rah! 'rah!\"    Then Frank felt himself lifted to the shoulders of his enthusiastic  admirers and carried to the home plate of the ball ground, where the  freshmen cheered again and again.    The sophomores were filled with rage and chagrin.    \"That was the blamedest trick I ever heard of in all my life!\" declared  Andy Emery. \"We weren't looking for anything of the kind.\"    \"And we have Merriwell to thank for it!\" snapped Evan Hartwick. \"He's  full of tricks as an egg is full of meat.\"    \"By Jawve!\" said Willis Paulding, who had managed to keep out of harm's  way during the entire affair. \"I think somebody ought to do something to  that fellaw--I really do, don't yer know.\"    \"Suppose you try to see what you can do with him,\" grinned Tad Horner.  \"You ought to be able to do something.\"    \"Aw--really you will hawve to excuse me!\" exclaimed Willis in alarm. \"I  hawdly think I could match his low cunning, don't yer understand.\"    \"Oh, yes, I understand,\" nodded Horner, significantly. \"It takes a man  to go up against Merriwell.\"    \"I hope you don't mean to insinuate--\"    \"Oh, no!\" interrupted Tad. \"I have said it.\"    \"Eh? I hawdly think I understand, don't yer know.\"    \"Think it over,\" advised the little soph as he turned away.    It is probable that Bruce Browning was more thoroughly disgusted than  any of his friends.    \"Confound it!\" he thought. \"If I'd stuck to that fellow and done him up  anyway he wouldn't have been able to carry out this trick. If he is  given any kind of a show he is bound to take advantage of it.\"    Bruce felt like fighting.    \"I'm going in there and lick him,\" he declared. \"I will settle this  matter with Merriwell right away.\"    But some of his friends were more cautious.    \"It won't do,\" declared Puss Parker.    \"Won't do?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"It might be done under cover of a rush, but a single fight between a  soph and a fresh under such public conditions would be sure to get them  both in trouble.\"    \"I don't care a continental! I've stood him just as long as I can! If I  can give him a good square licking I'll stand expulsion, should it come  to that!\"    They saw that Browning was too heated to pause for sober thought, and so  they gathered close around him and forced him to listen to reason.    It took no small amount of argument to induce the king to give over the  idea of going onto the ball field and attacking Merriwell, but he was  finally shown the folly of such a course. However, he vowed over and  over that the settlement with Merriwell should come very soon.          CHAPTER XV.    ON THE BALL FIELD.      The sophomores went in to watch the freshmen practice and incidentally  to have sport with them.    Two nines had been selected, one being the regular freshman team and the  other picked up to give them practice.    As Merriwell had been given a place on the team as reserve pitcher, his  services were not needed at first, and so he went in to twirl for the  scrub nine.    Walter Gordon went into the box for the regular team, and he expected to  fool the irregulars with ease. He was a well-built lad, with a bang, and  it was plain to see at a glance that he was stuck on himself. He had a  trick of posing in the box, and he delivered the ball with a flourish.    The scrub team did not have many batters, and so it came about that the  first three men up were disposed of in one-two-three order, not one of  them making a safe hit or reaching first.    Rattleton had vainly endeavored to get upon the regular team. He had  played pretty fast ball on a country nine, but he was somewhat out of  practice and he had not made a first-class showing, so he had failed in  his ambition.    He went into catch for Merriwell, and they had arranged a code of  signals beforehand, so that they were all prepared.    There was no affectation about Frank's delivery, but the first man on  the list of the regulars found Merriwell's slow drop was a hard ball to  hit. He went after two of them before he saw what he was getting. Then  he made up his mind that he would get under the next one and knock the  peeling off it.    He got under it all right, for instead of being a drop it was a rise,  and the batter struck at least eighteen inches below it.    \"Well, say,\" laughed Gordon, who had been placed second on the list at  his own request. \"I'll go you something he doesn't work that on me.\"    He was full of confidence when he walked up to the plate. The watching  sophomores were doing their best to rattle Merriwell, and it seemed that  he must soon get nervous, even though he did not seem to hear any of the  jolly that was being flung at him.    The very first ball seemed to be just where Gordon wanted it, and he  swung at it with all his strength. It twisted in toward him and passed  within two inches of his fingers.    Gordon looked mildly surprised, but he was still confident that he  would be able to hit the next one with ease. He found out his mistake  later on when he went after an out drop and failed to come within six  inches of it.    Then it was Gordon who grew nervous. He did not fancy the idea of being"]]]
