Yet Lucinda never aped girlishness; good taste and  a strong sense of humour preserved her amid many temptations thereto.  She was simply a beautiful, fully developed woman, with whom Time had  declared a truce, young with a mellow youth which had nothing to do with  years.    Mrs. George liked and admired Lucinda. Now, when Mrs. George liked and  admired any person, it was a matter of necessity with her to impart her  opinions to the most convenient confidant. In this case it was Romney  Penhallow to whom Mrs. George remarked sweetly:    \"Really, don't you think our Lucinda is looking remarkably well this  fall?\"    It seemed a very harmless, inane, well-meant question. Poor Mrs. George  might well be excused for feeling bewildered over the effect. Romney  gathered his long legs together, stood up, and swept the unfortunate  speaker a crushing Penhallow bow of state.    \"Far be it from me to disagree with the opinion of a lady--especially  when it concerns another lady,\" he said, as he left the blue room.    Overcome by the mordant satire in his tone, Mrs. George glanced  speechlessly at Lucinda. Behold, Lucinda had squarely turned her back on  the party and was gazing out into the garden, with a very decided flush  on the snowy curves of her neck and cheek. Then Mrs. George looked at  her sisters-in-law. They were regarding her with the tolerant amusement  they might bestow on a blundering child. Mrs. George experienced that  subtle prescience whereby it is given us to know that we have put our  foot in it. She felt herself turning an uncomfortable brick-red. What  Penhallow skeleton had she unwittingly jangled? Why, oh, why, was it  such an evident breach of the proprieties to praise Lucinda?    Mrs. George was devoutly thankful that a summons to the tea-table  rescued her from her mire of embarrassment. The meal was spoiled for  her, however; the mortifying recollection of her mysterious blunder  conspired with her curiosity to banish appetite. As soon as possible  after tea she decoyed Mrs. Frederick out into the garden and in the  dahlia walk solemnly demanded the reason of it all.    Mrs. Frederick indulged in a laugh which put the mettle of her festal  brown silk seams to the test.    \"My dear Cecilia, it was SO amusing,\" she said, a little patronizingly.    \"But WHY!\" cried Mrs. George, resenting the patronage and the mystery.  \"What was so dreadful in what I said? Or so funny? And WHO is this  Romney Penhallow who mustn't be spoken to?\"    \"Oh, Romney is one of the Charlottetown Penhallows,\" explained Mrs.  Frederick. \"He is a lawyer there. He is a first cousin of Lucinda's and  a second of George's--or is he? Oh, bother! You must go to Uncle John  if you want the genealogy. I'm in a chronic muddle concerning Penhallow  relationship. And, as for Romney, of course you can speak to him about  anything you like except Lucinda. Oh, you innocent! To ask him if he  didn't think Lucinda was looking well! And right before her, too! Of  course he thought you did it on purpose to tease him. That was what made  him so savage and sarcastic.\"    \"But WHY?\" persisted Mrs. George, sticking tenaciously to her point.    \"Hasn't George told you?\"    \"No,\" said George's wife in mild exasperation. \"George has spent most  of his time since we were married telling me odd things about the  Penhallows, but he hasn't got to that yet, evidently.\"    \"Why, my dear, it is our family romance. Lucinda and Romney are in love  with each other. They have been in love with each other for fifteen  years and in all that time they have never spoken to each other once!\"    \"Dear me!\" murmured Mrs. George, feeling the inadequacy of mere  language. Was this a Penhallow method of courtship? \"But WHY?\"    \"They had a quarrel fifteen years ago,\" said Mrs. Frederick patiently.  \"Nobody knows how it originated or anything about it except that Lucinda  herself admitted it to us afterwards. But, in the first flush of her  rage, she told Romney that she would never speak to him again as long  as she lived. And HE said he would never speak to her until she spoke  first--because, you see, as she was in the wrong she ought to make the  first advance. And they never have spoken. Everybody in the connection,  I suppose, has taken turns trying to reconcile them, but nobody has  succeeded. I don't believe that Romney has ever so much as THOUGHT  of any other woman in his whole life, and certainly Lucinda has never  thought of any other man. You will notice she still wears Romney's ring.  They're practically engaged still, of course. And Romney said once that  if Lucinda would just say one word, no matter what it was, even if it  were something insulting, he would speak, too, and beg her pardon  for his share in the quarrel--because then, you see, he would not be  breaking his word. He hasn't referred to the matter for years, but I  presume that he is of the same mind still. And they are just as much in  love with each other as they ever were. He's always hanging about where  she is--when other people are there, too, that is. He avoids her like a  plague when she is alone. That was why he was stuck out in the blue  room with us to-day. There doesn't seem to be a particle of resentment  between them. If Lucinda would only speak! But that Lucinda will not  do.\"    \"Don't you think she will yet?\" said Mrs. George.    Mrs. Frederick shook her crimped head sagely.    \"Not now. The whole thing has hardened too long. Her pride will  never let her speak. We used to hope she would be tricked into it by  forgetfulness or accident--we used to lay traps for her--but all to no  effect. It is such a shame, too. They were made for each other. Do you  know, I get cross when I begin to thrash the whole silly affair over  like this. Doesn't it sound as if we were talking of the quarrel of two  school-children? Of late years we have learned that it does not do to  speak of Lucinda to Romney, even in the most commonplace way. He seems  to resent it.\"    \"HE ought to speak,\" cried Mrs. George warmly. \"Even if she were in the  wrong ten times over, he ought to overlook it and speak first.\"    \"But he won't. And she won't. You never saw two such determined mortals.  They get it from their grandfather on the mother's side--old Absalom  Gordon. There is no such stubbornness on the Penhallow side. His  obstinacy was a proverb, my dear--actually a proverb. What ever he said,  he would stick to if the skies fell. He was a terrible old man to swear,  too,\" added Mrs. Frederick, dropping into irrelevant reminiscence. \"He  spent a long while in a mining camp in his younger days and he never got  over it--the habit of swearing, I mean. It would have made your blood  run cold, my dear, to have heard him go on at times. And yet he was a  real good old man every other way. He couldn't help it someway. He  tried to, but he used to say that profanity came as natural to him as  breathing. It used to mortify his family terribly. Fortunately, none of  them took after him in that respect. But he's dead--and one shouldn't  speak ill of the dead. I must go and get Mattie Penhallow to do my hair.  I would burst these sleeves clean out if I tried to do it myself and I  don't want to dress over again. You won't be likely to talk to Romney  about Lucinda again, my dear Cecilia?\"    \"Fifteen years!\" murmured Mrs. George helplessly to the dahlias.  \"Engaged for fifteen years and never speaking to each other! Dear heart  and soul, think of it! Oh, these Penhallows!\"    Meanwhile, Lucinda, serenely unconscious that her love story was being  mouthed over by Mrs. Frederick in the dahlia garden, was dressing for  the wedding. Lucinda still enjoyed dressing for a festivity, since the  mirror still dealt gently with her. Moreover, she had a new dress.  Now, a new dress--and especially one as nice as this--was a rarity with  Lucinda, who belonged to a branch of the Penhallows noted for being  chronically hard up. Indeed, Lucinda and her widowed mother were  positively poor, and hence a new dress was an event in Lucinda's  existence. An uncle had given her this one--a beautiful, perishable  thing, such as Lucinda would never have dared to choose for herself, but  in which she revelled with feminine delight.    It was of pale green voile--a colour which brought out admirably the  ruddy gloss of her hair and the clear brilliance of her skin. When she  had finished dressing she looked at herself in the mirror with frank  delight. Lucinda was not vain, but she was quite well aware of the fact  of her beauty and took an impersonal pleasure in it, as if she were  looking at some finely painted picture by a master hand.    The form and face reflected in the glass satisfied her. The puffs and  draperies of the green voile displayed to perfection the full, but not  over-full, curves of her fine figure. Lucinda lifted her arm and touched  a red rose to her lips with the hand upon which shone the frosty glitter  of Romney's diamond, looking at the graceful slope of her shoulder and  the splendid line of chin and throat with critical approval.    She noted, too, how well the gown became her eyes, bringing out all the  deeper colour in them. Lucinda had magnificent eyes. Once Romney had  written a sonnet to them in which he compared their colour to ripe  blueberries. This may not sound poetical to you unless you know or  remember just what the tints of ripe blueberries are--dusky purple in  some lights, clear slate in others, and yet again in others the misty  hue of early meadow violets.    \"You really look very well,\" remarked the real Lucinda to the mirrored  Lucinda. \"Nobody would think you were an old maid. But you are. Alice  Penhallow, who is to be married to-night, was a child of five when you  thought of being married fifteen years ago. That makes you an old maid,  my dear.

The oriole possesses a peculiar, sweet, high-whistled trill,  similar to this--'La-la-la-la,' which always ends with the rising  inflection.\"    Fritz Schmidt, who had been listening intently to Mary, gravely  remarked, \"An oriole built a nest on a tall tree outside my bedroom  window, and early every morning, before the family arise, I hear it  sing over and over again what sounds exactly like 'Lais Die Beevil!'  which translated means 'Read your Bible'.\"    \"Even the birds are 'Dutch,' I believe, in Bucks County,\" said Fritz.  \"I think these must be German Mennonites, there being quite a  settlement of these honest, God-fearing people living on farms at no  great distance from our place.\"    [Illustration: THE CANAL AT THE NARROWS]    As they drove along the country road, parallel with the Delaware  River, just before reaching the Narrows. Mary was greatly attracted by  the large quantities of yellow-white \"sweet clover,\" a weed-like plant  found along the Delaware River, growing luxuriantly, with tall, waving  stems two to four feet high. The clover-like flowers, in long, loose  racemes, terminating the branches, were so fragrant that, like the  yellow evening primrose, the scent was noticeable long before one  perceived the flowers. And, strange to tell, sweet clover was never  known to grow in this locality until the seed was washed up on the  bank of the river some ten or twelve years previous to the date of my  story, when the Delaware River was higher than it was ever before  known to be.    \"The first place we shall visit,\" said Aunt Sarah, \"will be my  grandmother's old home, or rather, the ruins of the old home. It  passed out of our family many years ago; doors and windows are missing  and walls ready to tumble down. You see that old locust tree against  one side the ruined wall of the house?\" and with difficulty she broke  a branch from the tree saying, \"Look, see the sharp, needle-shaped  thorns growing on the branch! They were used by me when a child to pin  my dolls' dresses together. In those days, pins were too costly to  use; and look at that large, flat rock not far distant from the house!  At the foot of that rock, when a child of ten, I buried the 'Schild  Krote Family' dolls, made from punk (when told I was too big a girl to  play with dolls). I shed bitter tears, I remember. Alas! The sorrows  of childhood are sometimes deeper than we of maturer years realize.\"    \"Why did you give your family of dolls such an odd name, Aunt Sarah?\"  questioned Mary.    \"I do not remember,\" replied her Aunt. \"Schild Krote is the German  name for turtle. I presume the name pleased my childish fancy.\"    \"Suppose we visit my great-great-grandfather's grave in the near-by  woods. I think I can locate it, although so many years have passed  since I last visited it.\"    Passing through fields overgrown with high grass, wild flowers and  clover, they came to the woods. Surprising to say, scarcely any  underbrush was seen, but trees everywhere--stately Lebanon cedars,  spruce and spreading hemlock, pin oaks, juniper trees which later  would be covered with spicy, aromatic berries; also beech trees. Witch  hazel and hazel nut bushes grew in profusion. John Landis cut a large  branch from a sassafras tree to make a new spindle on which to wind  flax, for Aunt Sarah's old spinning wheel (hers having been broken),  remarking as he did so, \"My mother always used a branch of sassafras  wood, having five, prong-like branches for this purpose, when I was a  boy, and she always placed a piece of sassafras root with her dried  fruit.\"    The Professor's wife gathered an armful of yarrow, saying, \"This is an  excellent tonic and should always be gathered before the flowers  bloom. I wonder if there is any boneset growing anywhere around here.\"    Boneset, a white, flowering, bitter herb, dearly beloved and used by  the Professor's wife as one of the commonest home remedies in case of  sickness, and equally detested by both Fritz and Pauline.    [Illustration: THE NARROWS OR PENNSYLVANIA PALISADES]    Mary gathered a bouquet of wild carrot, or \"Queen Anne's Lace,\" with  its exquisitely fine, lace-like flowers with pale green-tinted  centres. Mary's Uncle could not agree with her in praise of the dainty  wild blossoms. He said: \"Mary, I consider it the most detested weed  with which I am obliged to contend on the farm.\"    [Illustration: TOP ROCK]    After quite a long, tiresome walk in the hot sun, they discovered the  lonely grave, covered with a slab of granite surrounded by a small  iron railing and read the almost illegible date--\"Seventeen Hundred  and Forty.\" Ralph said, \"If he ever sighed for a home in some vast  wilderness, his wish is granted.\" It certainly was a lonely grave in  the deep woods, and gave all the members of the party a sad and eerie  feeling as they wended their way out into the sunlight again, to the  waiting carriages, and were soon driving swiftly along the Narrows,  as they have been called from time immemorial by the inhabitants,  although I prefer the name of Pennsylvania Palisades, as they are  sometimes called.    Said Professor Schmidt: \"Numerous tourists visit the Narrows every  year. The Narrows are said to resemble somewhat the Palisades on the  Hudson. I have seen, the latter and think these greatly resemble them  and are quite as interesting and picturesque.\"    \"The name Narrows is derived from the fact that at this place the  Delaware River has forced itself through the rocky barrier,\" continued  the Professor, \"hedged in on one side by cliffs of perpendicular rock,  three hundred feet high, extending some distance along the river,  leaving scarcely room at some places for the river and the canal. Some  quite rare plants grow here, said to be found in few other localities  in the United States. You see the highest flat rock along the Narrows?  It is called 'Top Rock' and rises to a height of more than three  hundred feet. We shall drive around within a short distance of it;  then, after passing a small house, we are obliged to walk across a  field of ploughed ground; follow the well-beaten path between trees  and undergrowth, and 'Top Rock' is before us. Stepping upon the high  ledge of rock projecting out over the road beneath, we discover it may  also be reached by following a precipitous path and clinging to bushes  and trees, but none of the party venture. Recently the body of a man  who had been searching for rare birds' eggs on the side of this  self-same rock was found dead on the path below the rocks. What caused  his fall is not known. No wonder Aunt Sarah says it makes her dizzy  when you boys skip stones across the river while standing on the  rock.\"    The beautiful view of the Delaware River and the scenery on the  opposite side was something long to be remembered. While the party  were going into raptures over the beautiful sight, Professor Schmidt  turned to Mary and remarked: \"In those rocks which rise in  perpendicular bluffs, several hundred feet above the level of the  river, are evidence that prehistoric man may have inhabited the caves  in these same walls of rock along the Delaware. From implements and  weapons found, it does not require any great effort of imagination to  believe the 'Cave Man' dwelt here many centuries ago.\"    Fritz Schmidt was much interred in his father's conversation, and  from that time on called Ralph Jackson Mary's \"Cave Man.\"    Leaving Top Rock, the party wended their way back to the waiting  carriages in the road, and drove to the \"Ringing or Musical Rocks.\"  They had been informed that their nearest approach to the rocks was to  drive into the woods to reach them. Passing a small shanty at the  roadside, where a sign informed the passerby that soft drinks were to  be obtained, the party dismounted and found, to their surprise, a  small pavilion had been erected with bench, table and numerous seats  composed of boards laid across logs, where camp meetings had formerly  been held. As the large trees furnished shade, and a spring of fresh  water was near by, they decided to \"strike\" camp and have lunch before  going farther into the woods.    Aunt Sarah and the Professor's wife spread a snowy cloth over the  rough wooden table, quickly unpacked the hampers, and both were soon  busily engaged preparing sandwiches of bread, thinly sliced, pink cold  ham and ground peanuts, fried chicken and beef omelette; opening jars  of home-made pickles, raspberry jam and orange marmalade.    \"Oh!\" said Pauline, \"I'm so hungry for a piece of chocolate cake. Let  me help shell the eggs, so we can soon have dinner.\"    \"Here's your fresh spring water,\" called Fritz, as he joined the  party, a tin pail in his hand, \"We had such an early breakfast, I'm as  hungry as a bear.\"    The party certainly did full justice to the good things provided with  a lavish hand by Frau Schmidt and Aunt Sarah. All were in high  spirits. The Professor quoted from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam--        Here with a loaf of bread beneath the bough.      A flask of wine, a book of verse and thou,      Beside me singing in the wilderness,      And wilderness is Paradise enow.    Ralph cast a look at Marry, unnoticed by any one else, as much as to  say, \"The old tentmaker voiced my sentiments.\"    [Illustration: RINGING ROCKS OF BRIDGTON TOWNSHIP BUCKS COUNTY. PA.]    [Illustration: HIGH FALLS]    After the hampers had been repacked and stowed away in the carriages,  they with the horses were left in the shade while the party walked to  \"High Falls,\" at no great distance from the camp. \"High Falls,\" a  beautiful waterfall about thirty feet high and fifty feet wide, is  situated several hundred feet east of the Ringing Rocks. The water,  before dashing below, passes over a large, solid, level floor of rock.  After gazing at the Falls and picturesque surroundings, they"]]]
