This excavation reached bottom at a depth of 16 meters. The second touched  bottom at about 10 meters, and gave access to a subterranean canal, which  was followed for about 20 meters. The extraction of sand was effected here  by an inclined plane moved by a Gramme machine. The generatrix had to make  1,500 revolutions, and be set in motion by an overshot wheel. As time was  wanting, it became necessary to diminish to as great a degree as possible  the number of parts to be employed in the transmission of motion, and  since there was an abundance of water, a velocity of 15 revolutions was  accepted for the wheel, which, with a total fall of 4.8 meters, had to  give a power of eight horses. A three meter pulley was placed upon the  shaft of the wheel. This was made of freshly cut wood that had been  exposed to the sun. In order to give it sufficient stability and prevent  its warping, it was placed against the wheel in such a way as to rest upon  the latter's spokes. This rendered it necessary to give up the idea of  using a belt, since it was not possible to prevent its getting wet. Cords  could not be found in the country, and so it was necessary to make use of  a too heavy chain, which was in no wise intended for such a purpose, and  which at a velocity of 15 revolutions began to swing and necessarily  absorbed much power. The large pulley drove one of 0.4 m. upon an  intermediate shaft. Upon this latter a 2.6 m. wooden pulley directly  drove, through a belt, the 0.2 m. pulley of the generatrix.    From this may be judged what the country's resources are. The motor, by  means of a belt, actuated a windlass provided with suitable checking  gearings. The distance of the two machines was 116 meters. Save the  transmission by chain, the whole worked in a satisfactory manner. The  performance could only be estimated in a lump, by comparing on the one  hand the theoretical work of the fall of water, and, on the other, that of  the vertical elevation of the car; and, further, one was obliged to  estimate the weight of the latter. If we allow 1,000 kilogrammes for the  weight of a car that received 360 liters of dry sand or 300 of wet, the  performance was 19 per cent., and appeared to be satisfactory, considering  the conditions under which the installation was made. This experiment was  at all events of such a nature as to indicate the use of these machines in  cases where the arrangement of the locality absolutely necessitates a  transmission of power.    The first workmen reached Portao de Ferro December 15, 1882, and the  material shipped from France did not arrive until April 25, 1883.  Operations were suspended about the 25th of September, since, for a  fortnight already, there had no longer been any doubt as to the manner in  which the river bed had been cleaned by former operators.    As a result of this first experiment, the proof remained that it would be  easy in future exploitations to introduce into the country methods of work  that are quicker and more economical than those now in use. In fact, all  the operations were performed with natives of the country, with the  exception of a carpenter and blacksmith from Rio Janeiro.--_La Nature._           *       *       *       *       *          WHAT WE REALLY KNOW ABOUT ASIATIC CHOLERA.    NEW YORK, September 1, 1884.    _To the Editor of the New York Medical Journal_:      SIR: I have been exceedingly interested in Dr. Bartlett's suggestive  article in your issue of August 30. But a sufficient number of  well-established facts are known to account for all the peculiarities and  vagaries of cholera.    1. Cholera has existed in Hindostan for centuries. It was found there by  Vasco da Gama in 1496, and there is a perfectly authentic history of it  from that time down to the present.    2. It is never absent from India, from whence it has been conveyed  innumerable times to other countries. It has never become domiciled in any  other land, not even in China, parts of which lie in the same latitude;  nor in Arabia, to which country pilgrims go every year from India; nor in  Egypt, nor Persia, with which communication is so frequent; much less in  any other part of the world. Canton in China, Muscat and Mecca in Arabia,  lie nearly in the same degree of latitude as Calcutta, in which cholera is  always existent; yet these places only have cholera occasionally, and then  only after arrivals of it from Hindostan.    3. The arrival of cholera in other countries is often involved in some  easily removable obscurity, which is deepened only by the ignorance and  want of veracity of quarantine and other officials.    4. Cholera is almost always preceded by a premonitory diarrhoea, which  lasts from one or two to three or four or more days before urgent and  characteristic symptoms show themselves. Of 6,213 cases, no less than  5,786 had preceding diarrhoea. The sufferers from this sow the germs of  the disease in numerous, often distant and obscure, places, to which no  choleraic person is supposed to have come.    5. The discharges swarm with infective bacteria of various kinds, some of  which, especially Koch's comma bacilli, seem to be specific.    6. The disease has been reproduced in men and some few animals by their  swallowing the discharges.    7. The discharges, according to the experiments of Thiersch,  Burdon-Sanderson, and Macnamara, are not virulent and poisonous for the  first twenty-four hours; on the second day eleven per cent. of those who  swallow them will suffer; on the third day, thirty-six per cent.; on the  fourth day, ninety per cent.; on the fifth day, seventy-one per cent.; on  the sixth day, forty per cent.; and after that the discharges have no  effect--the bacteria die, and the poison becomes inert.    Professor Robin reproduced cholera in dogs, and the celebrated dog Juno  died of cholera in Egypt last year. Professor Botkin, of the University of  Dorpat, reproduced cholera in dogs by the subcutaneous injection of the  urine of cholera patients. Even if the comma bacilli are not found in the  urine, other bacteria are; and even Koch supposes that they secrete a  virulent poison similar to that of some insects, which may be absorbed  into the blood and escape from the kidneys.    8. Some of the manners and customs of the Hindoos are very peculiar. They  always defecate upon the open ground, and will not use privies or latrines  This is a matter of religious obligation with them. It is also obligatory  upon them to go to stool every morning; to use the left hand only in  wiping themselves; to wash their fundaments after stool; to wash their  whole persons and clothing every day; and, finally, also to rinse their  mouths with water, and this they often do after washing in foul tanks, or  still fouler pools of water. On steamships, where tubs of water were  provided for washing their fundaments after defecation, Surgeon-General De  Renzy saw many Hindoos rinse their mouth with the same water.    9. The population of Hindostan is nearly three hundred millions, and at  least one hundred million pounds of faecal matter is deposited on the open  ground everyday, and has been for centuries.    10. Much of this foul matter is washed by rains into their tanks and pools  of water, which they use indiscriminately for washing, cooking, and  drinking purposes.    11. The poison of cholera has repeatedly been carried in soiled clothing  packed in trunks and boxes, and conveyed to great distances.    12. Articles of food, even bread and cake, as well as apples, plums, and  other fruit, handled by persons in the incipient stages of cholera, have  been known to convey the disease.    13. The number of epidemics produced by cholera discharges getting into  drinking water are almost innumerable, and those from contaminated milk  are not few.    14. The first case of cholera is generally counted from the first fatal  one, whereas this is almost always preceded by non-fatal ones, which have  escaped notice. And each subsequent fatal case is interwoven by one, or  several, or even many, non-fatal causes. If the string of a row of beads  is broken, and the beads scattered everywhere, it would be just as  improper to say that they had never been upon a string as to say that,  because all the fatal cases of cholera cannot be traced to equally fatal  ones, no connection ever existed between them.    These points are necessarily stated categorically, but every one can be  proved, if proof is called for. The numerous and very large pilgrimages of  the Hindoos must not be forgotten.    John C.

An important and influential conference[1] upon cholera was opened in  Berlin at the Imperial Board of Health on the evening of July 26. There  were present Drs. v. Bergmann, Coler, Eulenbrg, B. Fraenkel, Gaffky,  Hirsch, Koch, Leyden, S. Neumann, Pistor, Schubert, Skreczka, Struck,  Virchow, and Wollfhuegel. The conference had been called at the instance of  the Berlin Medical Society, whose President, Prof. Virchow, explained that  it was thought advisable Dr. Koch should, in the first instance, give a  demonstration of his work before a smaller body than the whole society, so  that the proceedings might be fully reported in the medical press. He  mentioned that Herr Director Lucanus and President Sydow had expressed  their regret at being unable to be present, as well as many others,  including Drs. Von Lauer, Von Frerichs, Mehlhausen, and Kersaudt. Before  the meeting Dr. Koch exhibited microscopical specimens and drawings of the  cholera bacillus, and demonstrated the method of its preparation and  cultivation.

Mather & Pratt,  electrical engineers, Manchester; Dr. Charles A. Burghardt, lecturer in  mineralogy at Owens College.    I would also refer you to a paper recently read before the Manchester  Section of this Society by Mr Carter Bell, the borough analyst for  Salford, in whose remarks Dr. Burghardt, an independent authority,  permits me to add that he concurs. He cannot give details until his  report has gone in, which will be very shortly.    Mr. Carter Bell's report _has_ gone in, and although he is precluded  also from giving full details, he has kindly put at my disposal samples  sealed by him of the effluents produced by the electrical treatment,  which I now submit, together with the analyses in the table.    The samples are taken at random.    Whether the process will or will not be adopted by the Salford  authorities I am of course unable to say, but I think I may safely say  that the electrical process has now absolutely proved its case in regard  to the solution of the sewage problem. It is simple, efficient and, I am  sure, more economical than any other known process where duration is  taken into account.    In regard to the Salford trials it may be interesting to give the  following particulars:      ______________________________________________________________________                         |                         |              Parts in 100,000.                         |________________________________________________                         |             |           |           |                         |   May 15.   |  June 7.  |  June 30. |  July 25.                         |_____________|___________|___________|__________                         |Not filtered.|           |           |      Total solids.      |   109       |  125      |  141      |  132      Loss on ignition.  |    33       |   21      |   29      |   23      Chlorine.          |    32       |   44      |   42      |   43      Oxygen required    |             |           |           |        for 15 minutes.  |     2.56    |    0.76   |    0.27   |    0.79      Oxygen required    |             |           |           |        for three hours. |     4.27    |    0.79   |    0.50   |    1.00      Free ammonia.      |     2.20    |    0.88   |    0.50   |    0.92      Albuminoid am-     |             |           |           |        monia.           |     0.32    |    0.17   |    0.092  |    0.19    _____________________|_____________|___________|___________|__________    The electrical shoot was built in brick and contained 28 cells arranged  in series.    Each cell contained 13 cast iron plates 4 in. x 2 ft. 8 in. x 1/2 in.  thick connected in parallel.    The available electrode surface in each cell was 256 sq. ft.    The ampere hour treatment required for Salford was found to be about  0.37 ampere hours per gallon, and the I.H.P. per million gallons based  on these figures would be 37.    NOTE.--In estimating for the plant necessary for treating the whole of  the Salford sewage, a margin was allowed on above figures. The A.H.T.  was taken at 0.4 and the I.H.P. per million at 39 to 39.5.    Mr. Octavius March, electrical engineer, who has followed the process  from the commencement, and who superintended the electrical details both  at Crossness and Salford, will give you on the blackboard a rough sketch  of the above trial plant.    The Salford tanks are admirably adapted to the application of the  electrical or in fact any process of precipitation. They are 12 in  number, and it is proposed to take two end tanks for the electrical  channels, in which the iron electrodes would be placed.    The total I.H.P. required for treating the whole of the Salford and  Pendleton sewage, taken at 10,000,000 gallons per 24 hours, is  calculated at 400 I.H.P., based on the actual work done during the  trial. The electrical plant would consist of four engines and dynamos,  any three of which could do the whole work, and three boilers, each of  200 I.H.P.    The total cost of plant, including alterations, is estimated at L16,000,  to which must be added the cost of about 5,000 tons of iron  plates--ordinary cast iron--at say L4 per ton. These plates would last  for several years.    If filtration were required, there would be an extra expenditure for  this, but it will be remarked that as the treated sewage is practically  purified when it leaves the electrical channels, these filters would be  only required for complete clarification, which for most places would  not be a necessity.    The filtering material used could be gradually prepared from the sludge  obtained after electrical treatment, unless it could be more profitably  sold as a manure, and I am not a believer in the value of sewage sludge  in large quantities. This sludge, a waste product, is converted into  _magnetic oxide of iron_, of which I have here two small samples. This  magnetic oxide is a good filtering material, but, like every other  filtering material, it would of course require renewal. There would,  however, always be a supply of the waste product--sewage sludge--on the  spot, and the spent magnetic oxide recarbonized could be used  indefinitely.    The annual cost for dealing with the Salford sewage is estimated at in  round figures L2,500 for coal, labor, maintenance of engines, boilers  and dynamos. To this must be added the consumption of iron and its  replacement, which would have to be written off capital expenditure.    If a colorless effluent were required, absolutely free from suspended  matter, the additional cost is estimated at from L1,200 to L1,500.           *       *       *       *       *          LAVENDER AND ITS VARIETIES.    By J. CH. SAWER, F.L.S.      Lavender--technically _Lavandula_. This name is generally considered to  be derived from the word _lavando_, gerund of the verb _lavare_, \"to  wash\" or \"to bathe,\" and to originate from the ancient Roman custom of  perfuming baths with the flowers of this plant.    The general aspect of the various species which compose this genus of  labiate plants, although presenting very characteristic differences,  merges gradually from one species to another; all are, in their native  habitat, small ligneous undershrubs of from one to two feet in height,  with a thin bark, which detaches itself in scales; the leaves are  linear, persistent, and covered with numerous hairs, which give the  plant a hoary appearance.    The flowers, which are produced on the young shoots, approximate into  terminal simple spikes, which are, in vigorous young plants, branched at  the base and usually naked under the spikes.    As a rule, lavender is a native of the countries bordering on the great  basin of the Mediterranean--at least eight out of twelve species are  there found to be indigenous on mountain slopes.    The most commonly known species are _L. vera, L. spica_ and _L staechas_.  Commercially the _L. vera_ is the most valuable by reason of the  superior delicacy of its perfume; it is found on the sterile hills and  stony declivities at the foot of the Alps of Provence, the lower Alps of  Dauphine and Cevannes (growing in some places at an altitude of 4,500  feet above the sea level), also northward, in exposed situations, as far  as Monton, near Lyons, but not beyond the 46th degree of latitude; in  Piedmont as far as Tarantaise, and in Switzerland, in Lower Vallais,  near Nyon, in the canton of Vaud, and at Vuilly. It has been gathered  between Nice and Cosni, in the neighborhood of Limone, on the elevated  slopes of the mountains of western Liguria, and in Etruria on hills near  the sea. The _L. spica_, which is the only species besides _L. vera_  hardy in this country, was formerly considered only a variety of _L.  vera_; it is distinguished by its lower habit, much whiter color, the  leaves more congested at the base of the branches, the spikes denser and  shorter, the floral leaves lanceolate or linear, and the presence of  linear and subulate bractes.    It yields by distillation an oil termed \"oil of spike,\" or, to  distinguish it from oil of _L. staechas_, \"true oil of spike.\" It is  darker in color than the oil of _L. vera_, and much less grateful in  odor, reminding one of turpentine and rancid coker nut oil. It is used  by painters on porcelain, and in the manufacture of varnishes. It is  often largely admixed with essence of turpentine.    _L. Staechas_ (Stichas) was discovered prior to the year 50 A.D. in the  Staechades Islands (now the Islands of Hyeres), hence the name. At  present it is found wild in the South of Europe and North of Africa,  also at Teneriffe. The leaves are oblong linear, about half an inch long  (sometimes an inch long when cultivated), with revolute edges and  clothed with hoary tomentum on both surfaces; the spike is tetragonal,  compact, with a tuft of purple leaves at the top; the calyces are ovate  and slightly shorter than the tube of the corolla. The whole plant has a  strong aromatic and agreeable flavor. There is a variety of this species  (_L. macrostachya_) native of Corsica, Sicily, and Naples, which has  broader leaves and thicker octagonal spikes.    _L. staechas_ is known in Spain as \"Romero Santo\" (sacred rosemary). Its  essential oil (also that of _L. dentata_) is there obtained for  household use by suspending the fresh flowering stalks, flowers  downward, in closed bottles and exposing them for some time in the sun's  rays; a mixture of water and essential oil collects at the bottom, which  is used as a haemostatic and for cleansing wounds.    The specific gravity of Spanish oil of _L. staechas_ is 0.942 at 15 deg. C.  It boils between 180 deg. and 245 deg.. The odor of this oil is not at all  suggestive of that of lavender, but resembles more that of oil of  rosemary, possessing also the camphoraceous odor of that oil. In India  this oil is much prized as an"]]]
