We petitioned until we  were jeered at; we agitated until we--well--came here [Pretoria  Gaol]; and we know that we shall get no remedy until we have the vote  to enforce it. We are not a political but a working community, and if  we were honestly and capably governed the majority of us would be  content to wait for the franchise for a considerable time yet in  recognition of the peculiar circumstances, and of the feelings of the  older inhabitants. That is the position in a nutshell.'    [Netherlands Railway Company.]    The Netherlands Railway Company is then a very important factor. It  is unnecessary to go very fully into its history and the details of  its administration. As the holder of an absolute monopoly, as the  enterprise which has involved the State in its National Debt, and as  the sole channel through which such money has been expended, the  Company has gradually worked itself into the position of being the  financial department of the State; and the functions which are  elsewhere exercised by the heads of the Government belong here, in  practice, entirely to this foreign corporation. Petitions for the  cancellation of this concession were presented in 1888, when the  progressive element in the first Volksraad consisted of one man--Mr.  Loveday, one of the loyalists in the war. The agitation begun and  carried on by him was taken up by others, but without further result  than that of compelling the President to show his hand and step  forward as the champion of the monopoly on every occasion on which it  was assailed. During the years 1893-96 the President stoutly defended  the Company in the Volksraad, and by his influence and the solid vote  of his ignorant Dopper Party completely blocked all legislation  tending to control the Company. Indeed at the end of the Session of  1895, on receiving representations from the business communities of  the Republic as to the desirability of removing this incubus from the  overtaxed people, the President stated plainly that the Netherlands  Railway Concession was a matter of high politics and did not concern  any but the burghers of the State, and that he would receive no  representations from the Uitlanders on the subject nor would he  permit them to discuss it.    Very shortly after the granting of this railway concession came the  appointment of Dr. Leyds as State Attorney for the Republic, he  having been recommended and pushed forward by the gentlemen in  Holland to whom the concession had been granted. It is stated that he  was sent out as the agent of the concessionaires in order to protect  and advance their interests, although at the same time in the service  of the Republic. It is only necessary to add that Mr. Beelaerts van  Blokland, the Consul-General for the Republic in Holland, is the  agent of the concessionaires in that country, and the accord with  which these two gentlemen, as railway commissioners at their  respective ends, have always acted becomes intelligible. Several of  the vital conditions of the concession have been freely violated, the  first being that a certain section of the line (Nelspruit) should be  completed within four years. It was not completed for eight. The  concession really became void several times during the years prior to  1890, but always found a stalwart champion in the President, who  continued to defend the concessionaires for some two years after they  had failed to get their capital subscribed. The Company was  floated on June 21 1887 on the most peculiar terms, the capital of  L166,666 being in 2,000 shares of 1,000 guilders, or L83 6s. 8d.  each. The shares were subscribed for by the following groups:      German            819 shares, carrying 30 votes.    Hollander         581    \"        \"    76   \"    The Republic      600    \"        \"     6   \"    The trust-deed, which limited the Republic to 6 out of 112 votes,  although it subscribed about one-third of the capital, and gave to  the smallest holders, the Hollanders, twice as many votes as all the  others put together, was passed by Dr. Leyds, in his capacity of  legal adviser of the Government, having previously been prepared by  him in his other capacity. The sum of L124,000 appears to have been  expended on construction ten months before any contract was given out  for the same or any work begun, and fifteen months before any  material was shipped.    The contract for the construction of the first sixty miles compels  admiration, if only for its impudence. In the first place the  contractors, Van Hattum and Co., were to build the line at a cost to  be mutually agreed upon by them and the railway company, and they  were to receive as remuneration 11 per cent. upon the amount of the  specification. But should they exceed the contract price then the 11  per cent. was to be proportionately decreased by an arranged sliding  scale, provided, however, that Van Hattum and Co. did not _exceed the  specification by more than 100 per cent._, in which latter case the  Company would have the right to cancel the contract. By this  provision Messrs. Van Hattum and Co. could increase the cost by 100  per cent, provided they were willing to lose the 11 per cent. profit,  leaving them a net gain of 89 per cent. They did not neglect the  opportunity. Whole sections of earthworks cost L23,500 per mile,  which should not have cost L8,000. Close upon a thousand Hollanders  were brought out from Holland to work for a few months in each year  on the line and then be sent back to Holland again at the expense of  the Republic. In a country which abounded in stone the Komati Bridge  was built of dressed stone which had been quarried and worked in  Holland and exported some 7,000 miles by ship and rail.    These are a few instances out of many. The loss to the country  through the financing was of course far greater than any manipulation  of the construction could bring about. In the creating of overdrafts  and the raising of loans very large sums indeed were handled.  Three-quarters of a million in one case and a million in another  offered opportunities which the Hollander-German gentlemen who were  doing business for the country out of love for it (as was frequently  urged on their behalf in the Volksraad) were quick to perceive. The 5  per cent. debentures issued to raise the latter sum were sold at L95  15s.; but the financiers deducted L5 commission from even this, so  that the State has only benefited to the extent of L90 15s. This  transaction was effected at a time when the State loan known as the  Transvaal Fives--raised on exactly the same interest and precisely  the same guarantee--was quoted at over par. What, however, was felt  to be worse than any detail of finance was that this corporation of  foreigners had gradually obtained complete control of the finances of  the State, and through the railway system it practically dictated the  relations with the other Governments in South Africa, by such  measures for instance as the imposition of a charge of 8-1/2d. per  ton per mile on goods travelling over their lines coming from the  Cape Colony, whilst the other lines are favoured by a charge of less  than half that. The burdens placed upon the mining industry by the  excessive charges imposed for political purposes were, in the case of  the poorer mines, ruinous. The right which the Company had to collect  the Customs dues for account of the State, to retain them as security  for the payment of interest on their shares and debentures, and to  impose a charge for collection quite disproportionate to the cost,  was another serious grievance. It was hopeless, however, to deal with  the whole question. The Government had set its face against any  reform in this quarter. It was not possible to obtain even ordinary  working facilities such as any business corporation unprotected by an  absolute monopoly would be bound to concede of its own accord, in  order to catch a measure of trade.    The Government have the right, under the agreement with the  Company, to take over the railway on certain conditions, of which  the following are the most important:    (_a_) The Company shall receive one year's notice of the intention to  take over.    (_b_) The Company shall receive twenty times the amount of the  average of the last three years' dividends.    (_c_) The Company shall receive as a solatium for the unexpired  period of the concession an amount equal to one per cent. of its  nominal capital for each year up to the year of expiring (1915).    The Government can take over the Krugersdorp-Johannesburg-Boksburg  Tramway against payment of the cost of construction.    If the Volksraad should not during this Session{08} decide to  nationalize the railway no change can take place before 1898, so that  the three years 1895 to 1897 would have to be taken as a basis and  therefore the 6 per cent. for 1894, the only low dividend, would not  come into the calculation. This would of course considerably increase  the purchase price--_e.g._,      1895              9 per cent.    1896             14      \"    (estimate),    1897             14      \"         \"                     --            Total    37      \"    That is to say an average distribution of 12.33 per cent. for the  three years. The purchase price would thus be:                        12.33 X 20 = 246.66 per cent.    17 years' premium               17       \"                                   ------                   Total           263.66    \"    This has been clearly explained to the Volksraad but without avail,  the President's influence on the other side being too strong. During  the Session of 1895 it was made clear that agitation against the  Company was as futile as beating the air. When the Hollander clique  found that they could no longer convince the Boers as a whole of the  soundness of their business and the genuineness of their aims, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16523"],[0,"The Kitáb-i-Aqdas (#18)"],[1," bidding.          _Let him then raise his hands, and repeat three times the Greatest      Name.
