Neither are the processes of  inheritance well understood nor subject to much control. Often in the  making of the man Nature resorts to some \"throw-back\" which reproduces  the ancient heritage. This can be seen only in general resemblances and  behavior, for the genealogical tree of any family is very short and very  imperfectly known, and the poor have no past. In three or four  generations at the most the backward trail is lost and his family merged  with the species of which he forms but a humble part.    Enough, however, is known of ancestry and the infinite marks of  inheritance on every structure as well as enough of the reaction of the  human machine to the varied environment that surrounds it, to make it  clear that if one were all-seeing and all-wise he could account in  advance for every action of every man. More than this, he could see in  the original, fertilized cell, all its powers, defects and  potentialities and could, in the same manner, look down through the  short years during which the human organism, grown from the cell, shall  have life and movement, and could see its varied environment. If one  could see this with infinite wisdom, he could infallibly tell in advance  each step that the machine would take and infallibly predict the time  and method of its dissolution. To be all-knowing is to be  all-understanding, and this is infinitely better than to be  all-forgiving.    To get this knowledge of the past of each machine is the duty and work  of the tribunal that passes on the fate of a man. It can be done only  imperfectly at best. The law furnishes no means of making these  judgments. All it furnishes is a tribunal where the contending lawyers  can fight, not for justice, but to win. It is little better than the old  wager of battle where the parties hired fighters and the issue was  settled with swords. Oftentimes the only question settled in court is  the relative strength and cunning of the lawyers. The tribunal whose  duty it is to fix the future place and status of its fellowmen should be  wise, learned, scientific, patient and humane. It should take the time  and make its own investigation, and it can be well done in no other way.  When public opinion accepts the belief that punishment is only cruelty,  that conduct is a result of causes, and that there is no such thing as  moral guilt, investigations and sorting and placing of the unfortunate  can be done fairly well. The mistakes will be very few and easily  corrected when discovered. There will be no cruelty and suffering. The  community will be protected and the individual saved.    Neither will this task be so great as it might seem at first glance.  Trials would probably be much shorter than the endless, senseless  bickering in courts, the long time wasted in selecting juries and the  many irrelevant issues on which guilt or innocence are often determined,  make necessary now. Most of the criminal cases would likewise be  prevented if the state would undertake to improve the general social and  economic condition of those who get the least. Only a fraction of the  money spent in human destruction, in war and out, would give an  education adapted to the individual, even to the most defective. It  would make life easy by making the environment easy. Only a few of the  defective, physically and mentally, would be left for courts to place in  an environment where both they and society could live. Perhaps some time  this work will be seriously taken up. Until then, we shall muddle along,  fixing and changing and punishing and destroying; we will follow the old  course of the ages, which has no purpose, method or end, and leaves only  infinite suffering in its path.          XVII    REPEALING LAWS      It is comparatively easy to get a penal statute on the books. It is very  hard to get it repealed. Men are lazy and cowardly; politicians look for  votes; members of legislatures and Congress are not so much interested  in finding out what should be done, as they are in finding out what the  public thinks should be done. Often a law lingers on the books long  after the people, no longer believing the forbidden thing to be wrong,  have repealed it. The statute stays, to be used by mischievous people  and by those who believe in the particular law.    Often the unthinking lay hold of a catch-word or a pet phrase and repeat  and write it, as if it were the last word in social science and  philosophy. General Grant, when president, stumbled on such a silly  combination of words, and surface-thinkers have been repeating it ever  since, simply because it sounds wise and pat. Grant once said that, \"The  way to repeal a bad law is to enforce it.\" Grant was not a statesman nor  a philosopher. He was a soldier. He probably heard some one use this  phrase, and it sounded good to him. Out of that has grown the further  statement which courts and prosecutors have used to excuse themselves  for the cruelty of enforcing a law that does violence to the feelings of  the people. This statement is to the effect that so long as the law is  on the books, it is the duty of officers to enforce it. The smallest  investigation of the philosophy of law shows how silly and reactionary  such statements are.    One thing should be remembered. Laws really come from the habits,  customs and feelings of the people, as interpreted or understood by  legislative bodies. When these habits and customs are old enough they  become the folk-ways of the people. Legislatures and courts only write  them down. When the folk-ways change the laws change, even though no  legislature or judge has recorded their repeal.    Since Professor Sumner of Yale University wrote his important book,  \"_Folkways_,\" there is no excuse for any student not knowing that this  statement is true. As a matter of fact, no court ever enforced all the  written laws, or ever would, or ever could. Only a part of the discarded  criminal law is ever repealed by other laws. The rest dies from neglect  and lack of use. It is like the rudimentary parts of the human anatomy.  Man's body is filled with rudimentary muscles and nerves that, in the  past, served a purpose. These were never removed by operations, but died  from disuse. Every criminal code is filled with obsolete laws, some of  them entirely dead, others in the course of dissolution. They cannot be  repealed by statute so long as an active minority insists that they  remain on the books. When the great mass no longer wants them, it is  useless to take the trouble to repeal them. The fugitive slave law was  never believed in and never obeyed, and it was openly violated and  defied by the great mass of the people of the North. The Fourteenth and  Fifteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution, and the statutes  passed to enforce them, providing political and civil equality for the  black man, and forbidding discrimination on railroads, in hotels,  restaurants, theatres and all public places, have never really been the  law in any state in the Union. Their provisions have always been openly  violated and no court would think of enforcing them, for the simple  reason that public sentiment is against it. Laws condemning witchcraft  and sorcery both in Europe and America did their deadly work and died,  for the most part, without repeal. Sabbath laws of all sorts forbidding  work and play and amusements are dead letters on the statute books of  most states, in spite of many attempts to galvanize them into life. All  kinds of revenue laws are openly violated. Most tax-payers of  intelligence who own property violate the revenue law openly and  notoriously, and all courts and officers as well as the public know it.  Many laws which interfere with the habits, customs and beliefs of a  large number of people, like the prohibition laws, never receive the  assent of so large a percentage as to make people conscious of any wrong  in violating them, and therefore people break them when they can. Often  this class of laws is enforced upon offenders who believe the law is an  unwarrantable interference with their rights, and thus causes  convictions where no moral turpitude is felt.    Every new crusade against crime not only sweeps away a large amount of  work that has been slowly and patiently done toward a right  understanding of crime, but likewise puts new statutes on the books  which would not be placed there if the public were sane. When it does  not do this, it increases penalties which work evil in other directions  and awe courts, juries, governors and pardon boards, not only preventing  them from listening to the voice of humanity and justice, but causing  them to deny substantial rights and wreak vengeance and cruelty upon the  weak and helpless.          XVIII    IS CRIME INCREASING?      The question is often asked, Is crime increasing? Statistics of all  kinds can be gathered on this subject. In the main they seem to show  that crime is on the increase in most civilized countries. It is very  unsafe to use statistics without at the same time considering all the  questions on which conduct rests. An increase of crime, as shown by  statistics, may mean that the records are kept more completely than in  former times. It may mean temporary causes like bad times are adding to  the number of arrests and convictions. It may mean new classifications.  It may mean that figures are based on arrests instead of convictions. It  may include misdemeanors with graver offenses. It may or may not include  repeaters. Statistics in any field are useful, but usually for broad  generalizations, and they must always be interpreted by men of  experience who are not interested in the results. Still, on the whole,  it is probable that statistics show that crime is on the increase.

SECTION XXXIII    Vaisampayana said, \"Then, O Bharata, when the world was enveloped in  dust and the gloom of night, the warriors of both sides, without  breaking the order of battle, desisted for a while.[31] And then,  dispelling the darkness the moon arose illumining the night and  gladdening the hearts of the Kshatriya warriors. And when everything  became visible, the battle once more began. And it raged on so furiously  that the combatants could not distinguish one another. And then  Trigarta's lord, Susarman with his younger brother, and accompanied by  all his cars, rushed towards the king of Matsya. And descending from  their cars, those bulls among Kshatriyas, the (royal) brothers, mace in  hand, rushed furiously towards the cars of the foe. And the hostile  hosts fiercely assailed each other with maces and swords and scimitars,  battle-axes and bearded darts with keen edges and points of excellent  temper. And king Susarman, the lord of the Trigartas having by his  energy oppressed and defeated the whole army of the Matsyas, impetuously  rushed towards Virata himself endued with great energy. And the two  brothers having severally slain Virata's two steeds and his charioteer,  as also those soldiers that protected his rear, took him captive alive,  when deprived of his car. Then afflicting him sorely, like a lustful man  afflicting a defenceless damsel, Susarman placed Virata on his own car,  and speedily rushed out of the field. And when the powerful Virata,  deprived of his car, was taken captive, the Matsyas, harrassed solely by  the Trigartas, began to flee in fear in all directions. And beholding  them panic-stricken, Kunti's son, Yudhishthira, addressed that subduer  of foes, the mighty-armed Bhima, saying, 'The king of the Matsyas hath  been taken by the Trigartas. Do thou, O mighty-armed one, rescue him, so  that he may not fall under the power of the enemy. As we have lived  happily in Virata's city, having every desire of ours gratified, it  behoveth thee, O Bhimasena, to discharge that debt (by liberating the  king).' Thereat Bhimasena replied, 'I will liberate him, O king, at thy  command. Mark the feat I achieve (today) in battling with the foe,  relying solely on the might of my arms. Do thou, O king, stay aside,  along with our brothers and witness my prowess today. Uprooting this  mighty tree of huge trunk looking like a mace, I will rout the enemy.'\"        [31] The word in the original is Muhurta equal to 48 minutes.      Nilakantha points out very ingeniously that the night being the      seventh of the dark fortnight, the moon would not rise till      after 14 Dandas from the hour of sunset, a Danda being equal to      24 minutes. A Muhurta, therefore implies not 48 minutes exactly,      but some time.    Vaisampayana continued, \"Beholding Bhima casting his eyes on that tree  like a mad elephant, the heroic king Yudhishthira the just spake unto  his brother, saying, 'Do not, O Bhima, commit such a rash act. Let the  tree stand there. Thou must not achieve such feats in a super-human  manner by means of that tree, for if thou dost, the people, O Bharata,  will recognise thee and say, _This is Bhima_. Take thou, therefore, some  human weapon such as a bow (and arrows), or a dart, or a sword, or a  battle-axe. And taking therefore, O Bhima, some weapon that is human,  liberate thou the king without giving anybody the means of knowing thee  truly. The twins endued with great strength will defend thy wheels.  Fighting together, O child, liberate the king of the Matsyas!'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed, the mighty Bhimasena endued  with great speed, quickly took up an excellent bow and impetuously shot  from it a shower of arrows, thick as the downpour of a rain-charged  cloud. And Bhima then rushed furiously towards Susarman of terrible  deeds, and assuring Virata with the words--_O good king!_[32] said unto  the lord of the Trigartas,--_Stay! Stay!_ Seeing Bhima like unto Yama  himself in his rear, saying, _Stay! Stay! Do thou witness this mighty  feat,--this combat that is at hand!_--the bull among warriors, Susarman,  seriously considered (the situation), and taking up his bow turned back,  along with his brothers. Within the twinkling of an eye, Bhima destroyed  those cars that sought to oppose him. And soon again hundreds of  thousands of cars and elephants and horses and horsemen and brave and  fierce bowmen were overthrown by Bhima in the very sight of Virata. And  the hostile infantry also began to be slaughtered by the illustrious  Bhima, mace in hand. And beholding that terrible onslaught, Susarman,  irrepressible in fight, thought within himself, 'My brother seems to  have already succumbed in the midst of his mighty host. Is my army going  to be annihilated?' And drawing his bow-string to his ear Susarman then  turned back and began to shoot keen-edged shafts incessantly. And seeing  the Pandavas return to the charge on their car, the Matsya warriors of  mighty host, urging on their steeds, shot excellent weapons for grinding  the Trigarta soldiers. And Virata's son also, exceedingly exasperated  began to perform prodigious fears of valour. And Kunti's son  Yudhishthira slew a thousand (of the foe), and Bhima showed the abode of  Yama unto seven thousand. And Nakula sent seven hundred (to their last  account) by means of his shafts. And powerful Sahadeva also, commanded  by Yudhishthira, slew three hundred brave warriors. And having slain  such numbers, that fierce and mighty warrior, Yudhishthira, with weapons  upraised, rushed against Susarman. And rushing impetuously at Susarman,  that foremost of car-warriors, king Yudhishthira, assailed him with  vollies of shafts. And Susarman also, in great rage, quickly pierced  Yudhishthira with nine arrows, and each of his four steeds with four  arrows. Then, O king, Kunti's son Bhima of quick movements, approaching  Susarman crushed his steeds. And having slain also those soldiers that  protected his rear, he dragged from the car his antagonist's charioteer  to the ground. And seeing the king of Trigarta's car without a driver,  the defender of his car-wheels, the famous and brave Madiraksha speedily  came to his aid. And thereat, leaping down from Susarman's car, and  securing the latter's mace the powerful Virata ran in pursuit of him.  And though old, he moved on the field, mace in hand, even like a lusty  youth. And beholding Susarman flee Bhima addressed him, saying, 'Desist,  O Prince! This flight of thine is not proper! With this prowess of  thine, how couldst thou wish to carry off the cattle by force? How also,  forsaking thy follower, dost thou droop so amidst foes?' Thus addressed  by Pritha's son, the mighty Susarman, that lord of countless cars saying  unto Bhima, _Stay! Stay!_--suddenly turned round and rushed at him. Then  Bhima, the son of Pandu, leaping down from his car, as he alone could  do,[33] rushed forward with great coolness, desirous of taking  Susarman's life. And desirous of seizing Trigarta's king advancing  towards him, the mighty Bhimasena rushed impetuously towards him, even  like a lion rushing at a small deer. And advancing impetuously, the  mighty-armed Bhima seized Susarman by the hair, and lifting him up in  wrath, dashed him down on the ground. And as he lay crying in agony, the  mighty-armed Bhima kicked him at the head, and placing his knee on his  breast dealt him severe blows. And sorely afflicted with that kicking,  the king of Trigartas became senseless. And when the king of the  Trigartas deprived of his car, had been seized thus, the whole Trigarta  army stricken with panic, broke and fled in all directions, and the  mighty sons of Pandu, endued with modesty and observant of vows and  relying on the might of their own arms, after having vanquished  Susarman, and rescued the kine as well as other kinds of wealth and  having thus dispelled Virata's anxiety, stood together before that  monarch. And Bhimasena then said, 'This wretch given to wicked deeds  doth not deserve to escape me with life. But what can I do? The king is  so lenient!' And then taking Susarman by the neck as he was lying on the  ground insensible and covered with dust, and binding him fast, Pritha's  son Vrikodara placed him on his car, and went to where Yudhishthira was  staying in the midst of the field. And Bhima then showed Susarman unto  the monarch. And beholding Susarman in that plight, that tiger among men  king Yudhishthira smilingly addressed Bhima--that ornament of  battle,--saying, 'Let this worst of men be set free.' Thus addressed,  Bhima spoke unto the mighty Susarman, saying, 'If, O wretch, thou  wishest to live, listen to those words of mine. Thou must say in every  court and assembly of men,--_I am a slave._ On this condition only I  will grant thee thy life. Verily, this is the law about the vanquished.'  Thereupon his elder brother affectionately addressed Bhima, saying, 'If  thou regardest us as an authority, liberate this wicked wight. He hath  already become king Virata's slave.' And turning then to Susarman, he  said, 'Thou art freed. Go thou a free man, and never act again in this  way.'\"        [32] Some Vikshyainam, Nilakantha explains Sama as a word spoken      by Bhima for assuring the captive Virata, and Vikshya as      'assuring' or 'consoling by a glance.' Perhaps this is right.        [33] The adjective Bhima-sankasas as explained by Nilakantha is      in this sense, quoting the celebrated simile of Valmiki.      SECTION XXXIV    Vaisampayana said, \"Thus addressed by Yudhishthira Susarman was  overwhelmed with shame and hung down his head. And liberated (from  slavery), he went to king Virata, and having saluted the monarch, took  his departure. And the Pandavas also relying on the might of their own  arms, and endued with modesty and observant of vows, having slain their  enemies and liberated Susarman, passed that night happily on the field  of battle."]]]
