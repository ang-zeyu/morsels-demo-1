But he stated that an opportunity  had been \"created for people in the airline to get rid of documents  which might seem to implicate airline officials as being responsible for  the disaster\". And he spoke of all these matters in terms of  \"justifiable suspicion\".    The condition of Captain Collins' flight bag when it was first seen by  Mr Woodford had already been mentioned. His letter dated 5th December  1980 was written immediately after some cross-examination of Captain  Gemmell had been given widespread publicity and on Monday 8th December  1980 Captain Gemmell was still giving evidence. By then he was under  cross-examination by counsel assisting the Commission and the latter  proceeded to read into the record the text of the letter (Exhibit 266)  which reads:         \"Dear Sir,         At the time of the DC10 crash I was employed in Antarctica by       D.S.I.R. as a survival instructor/mountaineer assistant. I was one       of the three mountaineers who made the initial inspection of the       site for survivors. I was also one of the three mountaineers who       accompanied Messrs David Graham (Investigator) Ian Gemmell & Ian       Wood (Air NZ) during their initial inspection of the aircraft.       During the first six days after the accident I was at the crash       site at all times when the site was occupied.         In regard to evidence reported in the Christchurch Press today, 5       Dec 1980, I can state unequivocally that:         (1) Captain Gemmell did not spend any time inspecting the aircraft       without other people being present.         (2) Captain Collins flight bag was found by me the day after the       crash, this being three days before any Air N.Z. personnel or crash       investigators reached the site. My recollection is that it was       empty when I first inspected it. It certainly contained no diaries       or briefing material.         (3) Captain Gemmell did not remove any items from the persons of       deceased lying in the area....\"    Counsel proceeded to read from the letter which goes on to refer to  instructions concerning the crevassed area of the ice-slope.    No challenge was made to the views expressed by Mr Woodford nor was he  called to give evidence. And no evidence to any contrary effect was  given by anybody. Yet apart from the passing reference to the matter in  paragraph 349 of the Report the point of view Mr Woodford expressed  seems to have been given no attention. The extent of the evidence which  could have been given by Mr Woodford if he had been called as a witness  is indicated by his affidavit now put before this Court. The importance  of the letter seems obvious. The bag being empty when it was seen only  18 hours after the aircraft had crashed it is difficult to understand  how it could have any significance when found in that same condition  three days later. Yet in this part of the Report it is left as a central  issue. Mr Woodford's own concern about all this is indicated in the  lengthy affidavit which he prepared for the purpose of exonerating  Captain Gemmell. It was sworn by him on 21st May 1981 not very long  after the Report of the Royal Commission had been made public.    A final comment should be made about Captain Gemmell's position. It  concerns a submission made on his behalf to this Court that \"In view of  the 'not proven' verdict against Captain Gemmell and the various  critical statements made about him it is a remarkable thing that he was  given no opportunity for further comment when the Commissioner decided  to make further enquiries of the police sergeant and Mr Chippindale at  the conclusion of the hearing of evidence\". If Captain Gemmell was to be  left enveloped in \"justifiable suspicion\" this is something that  certainly should have been done. Indeed if the post-hearing  investigation had been sufficiently developed the Commissioner might  have been satisfied (as now appears from the affidavit of Mr Stanton)  that the police officer who gave information to counsel assisting the  Commission about one or two flight bags was not even in Antarctica while  Captain Gemmell was there. The affidavit indicates that the police  officer arrived to take charge of the police store only on the evening  of 6th December and by then Captain Gemmell had been back in New Zealand  for two days.      Airline's Attitude at Inquiry    This matter requires brief comment. It involves the issue as to whether  Air New Zealand adopted an uncompromising approach to the matters under  consideration by the Royal Commission so that the proceedings were  unnecessarily prolonged. Concerning the matter the Commissioner said  this in the Appendix to the Report dealing with the awards of costs,  which must be mentioned later:         \"In an inquiry of this kind, an airline can either place all its       cards on the table at the outset, or it can adopt an adversary       stance. In the present case, the latter course was decided upon.       The management of the airline instructed its counsel to deny every       allegation of fault, and to counter-attack by ascribing total       culpability to the air crew, against whom there were alleged no       less than 13 separate varieties of pilot error. All those       allegations, in my opinion, were without foundation\".    The general complaint that Air New Zealand had adopted an adversary  approach and withheld evidence until a late stage needs to be assessed  against the control exercised by counsel assisting the Commission  concerning the order in which witnesses were to be called and the way in  which the Inquiry progressed. Before the initial hearing to settle  questions of procedure he supplied the airline with a \"Memorandum as to  areas to be covered by Air New Zealand evidence\". It is dated 13th June  1980 and specifies 21 topics. Then on 19th June he circulated a  \"Memorandum to counsel engaged in the DC10 Inquiry\" advising that the  parties were to prepare initial briefs which he would then put in  sequence. And at the preliminary hearing on 23rd June it was arranged  that a basically chronological order should be followed after Mr  Chippindale had been called as the first witness. On the following day  counsel for the Civil Aviation Division took issue with the requirement  that its brief of evidence should be handed in before Mr Chippindale had  appeared and the Commissioner ruled that briefs of evidence would be  withheld until shortly before the witness was to be called. Mr  Chippindale's evidence occupied the first fortnight of the inquiry and  thereafter the actual order in which the witnesses were to be called was  arranged by counsel assisting the Commission who stated in advance the  days and times at which those concerned should come forward. Thus the  first Air New Zealand witness to give evidence was the chief engineer  who appeared before the Inquiry on 22nd July.    It was said that the airline had not been invited through its counsel to  make its position known by means of an opening address at the  commencement of the public hearing. No doubt the Commissioner would have  permitted such an address but the occasion for it did not seem to arise  and he himself did not require the matter to be dealt with on this basis  by any of the parties. And in the result witnesses were called from  among the personnel of the airline in order to deal with various  questions in an ordered fashion. Thus it was not until all evidence had  been called that counsel for the various parties made submissions to the  Commissioner.    At the conclusion of the evidence counsel for the airline invited  counsel assisting the Commission to inform him what were the main issues  upon which closing submissions were requested. However the extended  written answer to that enquiry includes no suggestion whatever that the  conduct of airline witnesses or the post-accident conduct of the  employees was in issue. And the Commissioner himself said this in  paragraph 375 about the airline's submissions:         \"... counsel for the airline adopted, in the course of their       detailed and exemplary final submissions, the very proper course of       not attributing blame to any specific quarter but leaving it to me       to assemble such contributing causes as I thought the evidence had       revealed.\"    In that regard some of the statements which were made on behalf of the  airline are not unimportant. At one point counsel said--         \"By now it should be apparent to the smallest mind that the Company       has not espoused, and does not espouse, a proposition that the       accident can be contributed to a sole cause, let alone a sole cause       of pilot error. If from the evidence adduced, there emerges or is       implicit a criticism of the Company's flight crew, that criticism       has been moderate, informed and responsible.\"    And in the same context--         \"I would, with respect, also remind Your Honour that in the very       nature of these proceedings there has not been an opportunity for a       formal opening where one might have expected just that. But I would       further suggest, Sir, that the evidence advanced by the Company,       which has been in an attempt to bring every witness who can       contribute something towards the causal factors and everything else       has been done, not selectively, and there have been witnesses who       have plainly, unequivocally, acknowledged their fault, their error.       There has not in any way been a parade of witnesses all seeking to       criticize the flight crew and thus, as it were,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16131"],[0,"Campaign Pictures of the War in South Africa (1899-1900) (#18)"],[1,"ish, but  irresistible, yellow wave, until we saw the scouts slipping from rock to  rock up the stony heights of the first line of hills. Breathlessly we  watched the intrepid \"eyes of the army\" advance until they stood  silhouetted against the sky-line on the top of the black bulwarks of the  veldt. Then we strained our ears to catch the rattle of the enemy's rifles,  but we listened in vain; and we were completely staggered. What did it  mean? Was it a trap? Was there some devilish craft behind that apparent  peacefulness? Trap or no trap, we had not long to wait. The long, yellow  wave curled inwards from both flanks, the men going forward with quick,  lithesome steps. The mounted infantry shot forward as if moved by magic,  and, before the eye could scarcely grasp the details, our fellows held the  heights, and men marvelled and wondered whether the Boers had bolted for  good. But they soon undeceived us, for the hills shook with the  far-reaching roar of their guns, and shells began to make melody which  devils love; but they did no harm. Not a man was touched. Then came the  short, sharp word of command from our lines. Officers bit their words  across the centre, and threw them at the men. The Horse Artillery moved  into position, some going at a steady trot, others sweeping along the  valleys as if they were the children of the storm. The left flank swung  forward and encircled the base of an imposing kopje. The men swarmed up  with tiger-like activity, quickly, and in broken and irregular lines; but  there was no confusion, no wretched tangle, no helpless muddle. They did  not rush madly to the top and stand on the sky-line to be a mark for their  foes. When they almost touched the summit they paused, formed their broken  lines, and carefully and wisely topped the black brow; and as they did so  the Boer rifles spoke from a line of kopjes that lay behind the first. Then  our fellows dropped to cover, and sent an answer back that a duller foe  than the Boers would not have failed to understand. The Mauser bullets  splashed on the rocks, and spat little fragments of lead in all directions;  but few of them found a resting-place under those thin yellow jackets.  By-and-by the shells began to follow the Mauser's spiteful pellets, but the  shells were less harmful even than the little hostile messengers; for,  though well directed, the shells never burst--they simply shrieked, yelled,  and buried themselves. Our gunners got the ground they wanted, and soon gun  spoke to gun in their deep-throated tones of defiance. The Boers were not  hurting us; whether we were injuring them we could not tell.    In the meantime our whole transport came safely inside a little  semi-circular valley, and arranged itself with almost ludicrous precision.  The nigger drivers chaffed one another as the shells made melody above  their heads, and made the air fairly dance with the picturesque terms of  endearment they bestowed upon their mules, between the welts they bestowed  with their long two-handed whips. When two of their leaders jibbed and  refused to budge, they howled and called them Mr. Steyn and Ole Oom Paul;  but when they got down solid to their work they laughed until even their  back teeth were showing beyond the dusky horizon of their lips, and endowed  them with the names of Cecil Rhodes and Mistah Chamberlain, which may or  may not appear complimentary to the owners of those titles--anyway, the  mules did not seem to be offended. One thing was made manifest to me then,  and confirmed later on, viz., the nigger is a game fellow; give him a  little excitement, and he is full of \"devil\"--it's the doing of deeds in  cold blood that finds him out. After seeing the way the transport was  handled, I moved along to look at the ambulance arrangements, and found  them practically perfect. The medical staff was cool and collected, the  helpers were alert and attentive to business; the waggons, with their  conspicuous red crosses, were all well and carefully placed--though in such  a fight it was a sheer impossibility to dispose them so as to render them  absolutely immune from danger, for shells have a knack of falling where  least expected, and when they burst he is a wise man who falls flat on his  face and leaves the rest to his Creator and the fortune of war. My next  move was to secure a position on the top of a kopje, to try to gather some  idea concerning the actual strength of the Boer position. It needed no  soldier's training to tell a man who knew the rugged Australian ranges  thoroughly that the enemy had chosen his ground with consummate skill. To  get at the Boers our men had either to go down the sides of the kopjes in  full view of the clever enemy, or else make their way between narrow  gullies, where shells would work havoc in their packed ranks. After they  had reached the open, level ground, they had to cross open spaces of veldt  commanded by the Boer guns and rifles, whilst the Boers themselves sat  tight in a row of ranges that ran from east to west, mile after mile, in  almost unbroken ruggedness. If we turned either flank, they could promptly  fall back upon another line of kopjes as strong as those they held. Away  behind their position the grim heights of Thaba Nchu rose towards the blue  sky, solemn and stately. Far away to the eastward, a little south of east  perhaps, I could see the hills that hid Wepener, distant about eighteen  miles from the Boer centre. There we knew, and the enemy knew, that the  Boers held a British force pinned in. They knew, and we knew, that  Commandant Olivier, with eight or nine thousand men and a lot of guns, held  the reins in his hands; and the men our force were engaging knew that  unless they could keep us in check Olivier would soon be the hunted instead  of the hunter.    By-and-by the rifle fire on our left flank grew weaker and weaker--our guns  were searching the kopjes with merciless accuracy--and before sundown it  died away altogether, and we had time to collect our wounded and ascertain  our losses, though we could not even guess how the Boers had fared Our  wounded amounted to eight men all told, none of them dangerously hurt; of  dead we had none, not one. When their fire slackened the enemy doubtless  expected to see an onward dash of troops from our position, but it was not  to be. General Rundle had decided to play \"patience\" and save his men;  there was no necessity for him to rush on and force the Boer position, and  he chose the better part. Steadily our fellows were worked into position,  until every bit of ground that could bear upon the foe was lined with  British troops. Every available point, front or flank, where a gun could be  placed to harass the foe was taken advantage of; nothing was left to  chance, nothing was rashly hurried. Carefully, methodically the work was  done. There was to be no carnival of death on our side, no trusting to the  \"luck of the British Army,\" no headlong rush into the arms of destruction,  no waving line of bayonets. The Boer was to play a hand with the cards he  loves to deal. He was to be shelled and sniped. If he wanted straight-out  fighting, he had to come out into the open and get it. He was to have no  chance to sit in safety and slaughter the British soldiers like shambled  deer, as he had so often done before. As the sun went down our men  bivouacked where they stood, and nothing was heard through the long, cold  night except at intervals the grim growling of a gun, the sentinels' swift,  curt challenge, or the neighing of horses as steed spoke to steed across  the grass-grown veldt.    At the breaking of the dawn I was aroused from sleep by the simultaneous  crashing of several of our batteries. It was Britain's morning salutation  to the Boer. I hurried up to a spot on the kopje where a regiment of  Worcesters lay amongst the broken ground, and saw that the battle was just  about to commence in deadly earnest. It was a huge, flat-topped kopje where  I located myself. The outer edges of the hill rose higher than the centre,  a little rivulet ran across tiny indentations on the crown of that rampart,  and there was ample space for an army to lie concealed from the eyes of  enemies. If the Boers were strongly posted, so were the British. Away past  our right flank Wepener range was plainly visible in the clear morning  light, and just behind Wepener lay the Basuto border, with its fringe of  mountains. About two thousand yards away, directly facing our centre, a  white farmhouse stood in a cluster of trees. This farmhouse gave the  battlefield its name, Constantia Farm. The enemy could be seen by the aid  of glasses slipping from the kopjes down towards this farm and back again  at intervals. Cattle, horses, goats, and sheep went on grazing calmly, the  roaring of the guns doubtless seeming to them but as the tumult of a storm.    Turning my eyes towards the valley behind our position, I saw that we  intended to try to turn the enemy's left flank. Little squads of mounted  men, 95 in each group, swept along the valley at a gallop. They were the  Yeomanry and mounted infantry, and numbered about 600. A more workmanlike  body of fellows it would be hard to find anywhere. They sat their horses  with easy confidence, and looked full of fight. Some of them carried their  rifles in their hands, muzzle upwards, the butt resting on the right thigh;  others had their guns slung across their shoulders. Group after group went  eastward, and the Boers knew nothing of the movement, because we were for  once employing their own tactics. I watched them out of sight, and then  turned my attention to the guns. There was very little time wasted by our  people. The gunners on our left flank poured in a heavy fire, the centre  took up the chorus, and the guns on the right repeated it. For miles along  their front the Boers must have been in deadly peril. We seldom saw them.  Now and again a group of roughly clad"]]]
