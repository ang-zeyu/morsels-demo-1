Do you remember it, papa?\" she asked, looking  smilingly at him.    \"Yes, I think I have forgotten very little that ever passed between us.  You were a remarkably honest, conscientious child--would come and confess  wrong-doing that I should never have known or suspected, even when you  thought it likely I should punish you severely for it.\"    \"Now, mamma,\" said Rosie, \"won't you go into the hall with us and show us  just where papa caught you, and kissed you, and gave you the gold thimble?  And then your room and grandpa's?\"    \"Arthur, have we your permission to roam over the house?\" Elsie asked,  turning to him.    \"Yes; provided you will let me go along, for I am as much interested as  the children.\"    \"Come, then,\" she said, rising and taking Walter's hand, Rosie, Lulu, and  Gracie keeping close to her, and Mr. Dinsmore and Arthur following.    Pausing in the hall, she pointed out the precise spot where the little  scene had been enacted between herself and him who was afterward her  husband, telling the story between a smile and a tear, then moved on up  the stairs with her little procession.    Opening a door, \"This was my room,\" she said, \"or rather my room was here  before the old house was burned down. It looks just the same, except that  the furniture is different.\"    Then passing on to another, \"This was papa's dressing-room. I have passed  many happy hours here, sitting by his side or on his knee. It was here I  opened the trunk full of finery and toys that he brought me a few days  before that Christmas.    \"Papa,\" turning smilingly to him, and pointing to a closed door on the  farther side of the room, \"do you remember my imprisonment in that  closet?\"    \"Yes,\" he answered, with a remorseful look, \"but don't speak of it. How  very ready I was to punish you for the most trifling fault.\"    \"Indeed, papa,\" she answered earnestly, \"it was no such trifle, for I had  disobeyed a plain order not to ask a second time for permission to do what  you had once forbidden.\"    \"True; but I now see that a child so sensitive, conscientious and  affectionate as you were, would have been sufficiently punished by a mild  rebuke.\"    \"A year or two later you discovered and acted upon that,\" she said, with  an affectionate look up into his face. \"But at this time you were a very  young father; and when I remember how you took me on your knee, by the  fire there, and warmed my hands and feet, petting and fondling me, and  what a nice evening I had with you afterward, I could almost wish to go  through it all again.\"    \"Hark! what was that?\" exclaimed Rosie.    Every one paused to listen.    There was a sound of sobbing as of a child in sore distress, and it  seemed to come from the closet.    \"There's somebody shut up there now,\" Walter said in a loud, excited  whisper. \"Grandpa, can't she be let out?\"    Arthur strode hastily across the room and threw the closet door wide open.    There was no one there. They glanced at each other in surprise and  perplexity.    \"Ah, ha, ah, ha! um, h'm! ah, ah! the lassie's no there, eh?\" said a voice  behind them, and turning quickly at the sound, whom should they see but  Mr. Lilburn standing in the open doorway leading to the hall.    \"But we know all about her now, sir,\" said Arthur with a laugh, in which  he was joined by every one present.          CHAPTER XIII.        \"Evil communications corrupt good manners.\"                               --1 _Cor._ 15:33.      The one drawback upon Max's perfect enjoyment of his new home was the lack  of a companion of his own age and sex; the only boys in the family  connection, or among the near neighbors, were nearly grown to manhood or  very little fellows.    Therefore, when Ralph Conly came home for the Christmas holidays, and  though four years older than himself, at once admitted him to a footing of  intimacy, Max was both pleased and flattered.    Ralph's manner, to be sure, was more condescending than was altogether  agreeable, but that seemed not inexcusable, considering his superiority in  years and knowledge of the world.    At Ion, Max played the part of host, taking Ralph up to his own bedroom to  show him his books and other treasures, to the boys' work-room, out to the  stables to see the horses, and about the grounds.    To-day, at Roselands, it was Ralph's turn to entertain. He soon drew Max  away from the company in the parlors, showed him the horses and dogs, then  invited him to take a walk.    It was near dinner time when they returned. After dinner he took him to  his room, and producing a pack of cards, invited him to play.    \"Cards!\" exclaimed Max. \"I don't know anything about playing with them,  and don't want to.\"    \"Why not? are you too pious?\" Ralph asked with a sneer, tumbling them out  in a heap upon the table.    \"I've always been taught that men gamble with cards, and that gambling is  very wicked and disgraceful, quite as bad as getting drunk.\"    \"Pooh! you're a muff!\"    \"I'd rather be a muff than a gambler, any day,\" returned Max with spirit.    \"Pshaw! 'tisn't gambling, unless you play for money, and I haven't asked  you to do that, and don't propose to. Come now, take a hand,\" urged Ralph  persuasively. \"There isn't a bit more harm in it than in a game of ball.\"    \"But I don't know how,\" objected Max.    \"I'll teach you,\" said Ralph. \"You'll soon learn and will find it good  sport.\"    At length Max yielded, though not without some qualms of conscience which  he tried to quiet by saying to himself, \"Papa never said I shouldn't play  in this way; only that gambling was very wicked, and I must never go where  it was done.\"    \"Have a cigar?\" said Ralph, producing two, handing one to Max, and  proceeding to light the other. \"You smoke, of course; every gentleman  does.\"    Max never had, and did not care to, but was so foolish as to be ashamed to  refuse after that last remark of Ralph's; beside having seen his father  smoke a cigar occasionally, he thought there could be no harm in it.    \"Thank you, I don't care if I do,\" he said, and was soon puffing away as  if quite accustomed to it.    But it was not many minutes before he began to feel sick and faint, then  to find himself trembling and growing giddy.    He tried to conceal his sensations, and fought against them as long as  possible. But at length, finding he could endure it no longer, he threw  the stump of the cigar into the fire, and rising, said, \"I--I feel sick. I  must get out into the air.\"    He took a step forward, staggered, and would have fallen, if Ralph had not  jumped up and caught him.    \"Here, I'll help you to the bed and open the window,\" he said. \"Never  smoked before? Well, don't be discouraged; I was deathly sick first time  myself.\"    \"I'm half blind and awfully sick,\" groaned Max, as he stretched himself on  the bed. \"Does it last long? can a fellow get over it without taking any  medicine?\"    \"Oh, yes; you'll be all right after a little.\"    But Max was not all right when a servant came to the door to say that he  was wanted down-stairs, as the party from Ion were about to return home.    \"Think you can get down with the help of my arm?\" asked Ralph.    \"Don't b'lieve he kin, Marse Ralph,\" remarked the servant, gazing  earnestly at Max. \"What's de mattah wid de young gentleman? He's white as  de wall, and his eyes looks like glass.\"    \"Hush, Sam! you'll frighten him,\" whispered Ralph. \"Run down and ask my  brother Arthur to come up. Don't let anybody else hear you.\"    Max had tried to rise, but only to fall back again sicker than ever.    \"Oh, but I'm sick, and how my heart beats!\" he said. \"I can't possibly sit  up, much less walk down-stairs. What will Mamma Vi and the rest say? I'm  afraid Grandpa Dinsmore will be very angry with me.\"    \"He hasn't any right to be,\" said Ralph; \"'tisn't wicked to smoke. But  I'll tell Art not to let him know what made you sick.\"    Just then the doctor came in. Sam had met him in the hall.    \"What's the matter?\" he asked; \"sick, Max? Ah, you've been smoking?\"  sniffing the air of the room and glancing at the boy's pallid face.    \"Tell him it isn't dangerous. Art,\" laughed Ralph, \"for I do believe he's  dreadfully scared.\"    \"No, I'm not!\" protested Max indignantly, \"but I'm sick, and giddy, and  half blind. I never smoked before, and didn't know it would sicken me so.\"    \"How many cigars have you smoked?\" asked Arthur, taking hold of his wrist.    \"Only half a one,\" said Ralph; \"he threw the rest of it in the fire.\"    \"The best place for it,\" said Arthur. \"Don't be alarmed, my boy, the  sickness and all the other bad effects will pass off after a while; all  the sooner if you are breathing pure air. Ralph, open the door into the  hall and the one opposite. Then ring for Sam to kindle a fire in that  room.\"    As he spoke he took Max in his arms, and, Ralph preceding them to open the  doors, carried him into an unoccupied bedroom, laid him on a couch, and  covered him up carefully to guard against his taking cold.    \"No need to ring for Sam; fire's laid all ready to kindle,\" remarked  Ralph, glancing at the open grate.    He struck a match, and in another minute the flames were leaping up right  merrily.    Meantime a report that Max was sick had reached the parlor, and Mr.  Dinsmore, his daughter, and granddaughter came up to express their  sympathy and see for themselves how serious the illness was. Their faces  were full of anxiety and concern till they learned the cause of the  sickness, when they evidently felt much relieved.    \"Dear boy, I'm sorry you are suffering,\" Violet said, leaning over him,  \"but I hope you will never try it again.\"    \"Papa smokes,\" he said, \"so I thought it was all right for me.\"    \"No,\" said Mr. Dinsmore; \"a grown person may sometimes do safely what is  dangerous for a younger one. You have my sympathy this time, Max, but "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14916"],[0,"Fairy Tales Every Child Should Know (#18)"],[1,"separate might be their place of residence from each other. The younger  brother not having received as usual his annual communication, prepared  to take a horoscope and ascertain his brother's proceedings. He, as well  as his brother, always carried a geomantic square instrument about him;  he prepared the sand, cast the points, and drew the figures. On  examining the planetary crystal, he found that his brother was no longer  living, but had been poisoned; and by another observation, that he was  in the capital of the kingdom of China; also, that the person who had  poisoned him was of mean birth, though married to a princess, a sultan's  daughter.    When the magician had informed himself of his brother's fate, he  resolved immediately to revenge his death, and at once departed for  China; where, after crossing plains, rivers, mountains, deserts, and a  long tract of country without delay, he arrived after incredible  fatigues. When he came to the capital of China, he took a lodging at a  khan. His magic art soon revealed to him that Aladdin was the person who  had been the cause of the death of his brother. He had heard, too, all  the persons of repute in the city talking of a woman called Fatima, who  was retired from the world, and of the miracles she wrought. As he  fancied that this woman might be serviceable to him in the project he  had conceived, he made more minute inquiries, and requested to be  informed more particularly who that holy woman was, and what sort of  miracles she performed.    \"What!\" said the person whom he addressed, \"have you never seen or heard  of her? She is the admiration of the whole town, for her fasting, her  austerities, and her exemplary life. Except Mondays and Fridays, she  never stirs out of her little cell; and on those days on which she comes  into the town she does an infinite deal of good; for there is not a  person who is diseased but she puts her hand on them and cures them.\"    Having ascertained the place where the hermitage of this holy woman was,  the magician went at night, and, plunging a poniard into her heart,  killed this good woman. In the morning he dyed his face of the same hue  as hers, and arraying himself in her garb, taking her veil, the large  necklace she wore round her waist, and her stick, went straight to the  palace of Aladdin.    As soon as the people saw the holy woman, as they imagined him to be,  they presently gathered about him in a great crowd. Some begged his  blessing, others kissed his hand, and others, more reserved, only the  hem of his garment; while others, suffering from disease, stooped for  him to lay his hands upon them; which he did, muttering some words in  form of prayer, and, in short, counterfeiting so well, that everybody  took him for the holy woman. He came at last to the square before  Aladdin's palace. The crowd and the noise were so great that the  princess, who was in the hall of four-and-twenty windows, heard it, and  asked what was the matter. One of her women told her it was a great  crowd of people collected about the holy woman to be cured of diseases  by the imposition of her hands.    The princess, who had long heard of this holy woman, but had never seen  her, was very desirous to have some conversation with her; which the  chief officer perceiving, told her it was an easy matter to bring her to  her, if she desired and commanded it; and the princess expressing her  wishes, he immediately sent four slaves for the pretended holy woman.    As soon as the crowd saw the attendants from the palace, they made way;  and the magician, perceiving also that they were coming for him,  advanced to meet them, overjoyed to find his plot succeed so well. \"Holy  woman,\" said one of the slaves, \"the princess wants to see you, and has  sent us for you.\" \"The princess does me too great an honour,\" replied  the false Fatima; \"I am ready to obey her command,\" and at the same time  followed the slaves to the palace.    When the pretended Fatima had made her obeisance, the princess said, \"My  good mother, I have one thing to request, which you must not refuse me;  it is, to stay with me, that you may edify me with your way of living,  and that I may learn from your good example.\" \"Princess,\" said the  counterfeit Fatima, \"I beg of you not to ask what I cannot consent to  without neglecting my prayers and devotion.\" \"That shall be no hindrance  to you,\" answered the princess; \"I have a great many apartments  unoccupied; you shall choose which you like best, and have as much  liberty to perform your devotions as if you were in your own cell.\"    The magician, who really desired nothing more than to introduce himself  into the palace, where it would be a much easier matter for him to  execute his designs, did not long excuse himself from accepting the  obliging offer which the princess made him. \"Princess,\" said he,  \"whatever resolution a poor wretched woman as I am may have made to  renounce the pomp and grandeur of this world, I dare not presume to  oppose the will and commands of so pious and charitable a princess.\"    Upon this the princess, rising up, said, \"Come with me, I will show you  what vacant apartments I have, that you may make choice of that you like  best.\" The magician followed the princess, and of all the apartments she  showed him, made choice of that which was the worst, saying that it was  too good for him, and that he only accepted it to please her.    Afterward the princess would have brought him back into the great hall  to make him dine with her; but he, considering that he should then be  obliged to show his face, which he had always taken care to conceal with  Fatima's veil, and fearing that the princess should find out that he was  not Fatima, begged of her earnestly to excuse him, telling her that he  never ate anything but bread and dried fruits, and desiring to eat that  slight repast in his own apartment. The princess granted his request,  saying, \"You may be as free here, good mother, as if you were in your  own cell: I will order you a dinner, but remember I expect you as soon  as you have finished your repast.\"    After the princess had dined, and the false Fatima had been sent for by  one of the attendants, he again waited upon her. \"My good mother,\" said  the princess, \"I am overjoyed to see so holy a woman as yourself, who  will confer a blessing upon this palace. But now I am speaking of the  palace, pray how do you like it? And before I show it all to you, tell  me first what you think of this hall.\"    Upon this question, the counterfeit Fatima surveyed the hall from one  end to the other. When he had examined it well, he said to the princess,  \"As far as such a solitary being as I am, who am unacquainted with what  the world calls beautiful, can judge, this hall is truly admirable;  there wants but one thing.\" \"What is that, good mother?\" demanded the  princess; \"tell me, I conjure you. For my part, I always believed, and  have heard say, it wanted nothing; but if it does, it shall be  supplied.\"    \"Princess,\" said the false Fatima, with great dissimulation, \"forgive me  the liberty I have taken; but my opinion is, if it can be of any  importance, that if a roc's egg were hung up in the middle of the dome,  this hall would have no parallel in the four quarters of the world, and  your palace would be the wonder of the universe.\"    \"My good mother,\" said the princess, \"what is a roc, and where may one  get an egg?\" \"Princess,\" replied the pretended Fatima, \"it is a bird of  prodigious size, which inhabits the summit of Mount Caucasus; the  architect who built your palace can get you one.\"    After the princess had thanked the false Fatima for what she believed  her good advice, she conversed with her upon other matters; but could  not forget the roc's egg, which she resolved to request of Aladdin when  next he should visit his apartments. He did so in the course of that  evening, and shortly after he entered, the princess thus addressed him:  \"I always believed that our palace was the most superb, magnificent, and  complete in the world: but I will tell you now what it wants, and that  is a roc's egg hung up in the midst of the dome.\" \"Princess,\" replied  Aladdin, \"it is enough that you think it wants such an ornament; you  shall see by the diligence which I use in obtaining it, that there is  nothing which I would not do for your sake.\"    Aladdin left the Princess Buddir al Buddoor that moment, and went up  into the hall of four-and-twenty windows, where, pulling out of his  bosom the lamp, which after the danger he had been exposed to be always  carried about him, he rubbed it; upon which the genie immediately  appeared. \"Genie,\" said Aladdin, \"I command thee, in the name of this  lamp, bring a roc's egg to be hung up in the middle of the dome of the  hall of the palace.\" Aladdin had no sooner pronounced these words, than  the hall shook as if ready to fall; and the genie said in a loud and  terrible voice, \"Is it not enough that I and the other slaves of the  lamp have done everything for you, but you, by an unheard-of  ingratitude, must command me to bring my master, and hang him up in the  midst of this dome? This attempt deserves that you, the princess, and  the palace, should be immediately reduced to ashes; but you are spared  because this request does not come from yourself. Its true author is the  brother of the African magician, your enemy whom you have destroyed. He  is now in your palace, disguised in the habit of the holy woman Fatima,  whom he has murdered; at his suggestion your wife makes this pernicious  demand. His design is to kill you, therefore take care of yourself.\"  After these words the genie disappeared.    Aladdin resolved at once what to do. He returned to the princess's  apartment, and without mentioning a word of what had happened, sat down,  and complained of a great pain which had suddenly seized his head. On  hearing this, the princess told him how "]]]
