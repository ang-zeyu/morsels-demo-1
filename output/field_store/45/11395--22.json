In obedience to orders from Vienna,  Beaulieu assumed the offensive; but he brought his chief force to bear  on the French vanguard at Voltri, which he drove in with some loss.  While he was occupying Voltri, the boom of cannon echoing across the  mountains warned his outposts that the real campaign was opening in  the broken country north of Savona.[40] There the weak Austrian centre  had occupied a ridge or plateau above the village of Montenotte,  through which ran the road leading to Alessandria and Milan.  Argenteau's attack partly succeeded: but the stubborn bravery of a  French detachment checked it before the redoubt which commanded the  southern prolongation of the heights named Monte-Legino.[41]    Such was the position of affairs when Bonaparte hurried up. On the  following day (April 12th), massing the French columns of attack  under cover of an early morning mist, he moved them to their  positions, so that the first struggling rays of sunlight revealed to  the astonished Austrians the presence of an army ready to crush their  front and turn their flanks. For a time the Imperialists struggled  bravely against the superior forces in their front; but when Massena  pressed round their right wing, they gave way and beat a speedy  retreat to save themselves from entire capture. Bonaparte took no  active share in the battle: he was, very properly, intent on the wider  problem of severing the Austrians from their allies, first by the  turning movement of Massena, and then by pouring other troops into the  gap thus made. In this he entirely succeeded. The radical defects in  the Austrian dispositions left them utterly unable to withstand the  blows which he now showered upon them. The Sardinians were too far  away on the west to help Argenteau in his hour of need: they were in  and beyond Ceva, intent on covering the road to Turin: whereas, as  Napoleon himself subsequently wrote, they should have been near enough  to their allies to form one powerful army, which, at Dego or  Montenotte, would have defended both Turin and Milan. \"United, the two  forces would have been superior to the French army: separated, they  were lost.\"    The configuration of the ground favoured Bonaparte's plan of driving  the Imperialists down the valley of the Bormida in a north-easterly  direction; and the natural desire of a beaten general to fall back  towards his base of supplies also impelled Beaulieu and Argenteau to  retire towards Milan. But that would sever their connections with the  Sardinians, whose base of supplies, Turin, lay in a north-westerly  direction.    Bonaparte therefore hurled his forces at once against the Austrians  and a Sardinian contingent at Millesimo, and defeated them, Augereau's  division cutting off the retreat of twelve hundred of their men under  Provera. Weakened by this second blow, the allies fell back on the  intrenched village of Dego. Their position was of a strength  proportionate to its strategic importance; for its loss would  completely sever all connection between their two main armies save by  devious routes many miles in their rear. They therefore clung  desperately to the six mamelons and redoubts which barred the valley  and dominated some of the neighbouring heights. Yet such was the  superiority of the French in numbers that these positions were  speedily turned by Massena, whom Bonaparte again intrusted with the  movement on the enemy's flank and rear. A strange event followed. The  victors, while pillaging the country for the supplies which  Bonaparte's sharpest orders failed to draw from the magazines and  stores on the sea-coast, were attacked in the dead of night by five  Austrian battalions that had been ordered up to support their  countrymen at Dego. These, after straying among the mountains, found  themselves among bands of the marauding French, whom they easily  scattered, seizing Dego itself. Apprised of this mishap, Bonaparte  hurried up more troops from the rear, and on the 15th recovered the  prize which had so nearly been snatched from his grasp. Had Beaulieu  at this time thrown all his forces on the French, he might have  retrieved his first misfortunes: but foresight and energy were not to  be found at the Austrian headquarters: the surprise at Dego was the  work of a colonel; and for many years to come the incompetence of  their aged commanders was to paralyze the fine fighting qualities of  the \"white-coats.\" In three conflicts they had been outmanoeuvred and  outnumbered, and drew in their shattered columns to Acqui.    The French commander now led his columns westward against the  Sardinians, who had fallen back on their fortified camp at Ceva, in  the upper valley of the Tanaro. There they beat off one attack of the  French. A check in front of a strongly intrenched position was  serious. It might have led to a French disaster, had the Austrians  been able to bring aid to their allies. Bonaparte even summoned a  council of war to deliberate on the situation. As a rule, a council of  war gives timid advice. This one strongly advised a second attack on  the camp--a striking proof of the ardour which then nerved the  republican generals. Not yet were they _condottieri_ carving out  fortunes by their swords: not yet were they the pampered minions of an  autocrat, intent primarily on guarding the estates which his favour  had bestowed. Timidity was rather the mark of their opponents. When  the assault on the intrenchments of Ceva was about to be renewed, the  Sardinian forces were discerned filing away westwards. Their general  indulged the fond hope of holding the French at bay at several  strong natural positions on his march. He was bitterly to rue his  error. The French divisions of Serurier and Dommartin closed in on  him, drove him from Mondovi, and away towards Turin.    Bonaparte had now completely succeeded. Using to the full the  advantage of his central position between the widely scattered  detachments of his foes, he had struck vigorously at their natural  point of junction, Montenotte, and by three subsequent successes--for  the evacuation of Ceva can scarcely be called a French victory--had  forced them further and further apart until Turin was almost within  his power.    It now remained to push these military triumphs to their natural  conclusion, and impose terms of peace on the House of Savoy, which was  secretly desirous of peace. The Directors had ordered Bonaparte that  he should seek to detach Sardinia from the Austrian alliance by  holding out the prospect of a valuable compensation for the loss of  Savoy and Nice in the fertile Milanese.[42] The prospect of this rich  prize would, the Directors surmised, dissolve the Austro-Sardinian  alliance, as soon as the allies had felt the full vigour of the French  arms. Not that Bonaparte himself was to conduct these negotiations. He  was to forward to the Directory all offers of submission. Nay, he was  not empowered to grant on his own responsibility even an armistice. He  was merely to push the foe hard, and feed his needy soldiers on the  conquered territory. He was to be solely a general, never a  negotiator.    The Directors herein showed keen jealousy or striking ignorance of  military affairs. How could he keep the Austrians quiet while envoys  passed between Turin and Paris? All the dictates of common sense  required him to grant an armistice to the Court of Turin before the  Austrians could recover from their recent disasters. But the King of  Sardinia drew him from a perplexing situation by instructing Colli to  make overtures for an armistice as preliminary to a peace. At once the  French commander replied that such powers belonged to the Directory;  but as for an armistice, it would only be possible if the Court of  Turin placed in his hands three fortresses, Coni, Tortona, and  Alessandria, besides guaranteeing the transit of French armies through  Piedmont and the passage of the Po at Valenza. Then, with his  unfailing belief in accomplished facts, Bonaparte pushed on his troops  to Cherasco.    Near that town he received the Piedmontese envoys; and from the pen of  one of them we have an account of the general's behaviour in his first  essay in diplomacy. His demeanour was marked by that grave and frigid  courtesy which was akin to Piedmontese customs. In reply to the  suggestions of the envoys that some of the conditions were of little  value to the French, he answered: \"The Republic, in intrusting to me  the command of an army, has credited me with possessing enough  discernment to judge of what that army requires, without having  recourse to the advice of my enemy.\" Apart, however, from this  sarcasm, which was uttered in a hard and biting voice, his tone was  coldly polite. He reserved his home thrust for the close of the  conference. When it had dragged on till considerably after noon with  no definite result, he looked at his watch and exclaimed: \"Gentlemen,  I warn you that a general attack is ordered for two o'clock, and that  if I am not assured that Coni will be put in my hands before  nightfall, the attack will not be postponed for one moment. It may  happen to me to lose battles, but no one shall ever see me lose  minutes either by over-confidence or by sloth.\" The terms of the  armistice of Cherasco were forthwith signed (April 28th); they were  substantially the same as those first offered by the victor. During  the luncheon which followed, the envoys were still further impressed  by his imperturbable confidence and trenchant phrases; as when he told  them that the campaign was the exact counterpart of what he had  planned in 1794; or described a council of war as a convenient device  for covering cowardice or irresolution in the commander; or asserted  that nothing could now stop him before"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14314"],[0,"Etiquette (#18)"],[1,"people say \"Not receiving,\" which means actually the same  thing, but the \"not at home\" is infinitely more polite; since in the  former you know she is in the house but won't see you, whereas in the  latter case you have the pleasant uncertainty that it is quite possible  she is out.    To be told \"Mrs. Jones is at home but doesn't want to see you,\" would  certainly be unpleasant. And to \"beg to be excused\"--except in a case of  illness or bereavement--has something very suggestive of a cold shoulder.  But \"not at home\" means that she is not sitting in the drawing room behind  her tea tray; that and nothing else. She may be out or she may be lying  down or otherwise occupied. Nor do people of the world find the slightest  objection if a hostess, happening to recognize the visitor as a particular  friend, calls out, \"Do come in! I _am_ at home to _you!_\" Anyone who talks  about this phrase as being a \"white lie\" either doesn't understand the  meaning of the words, or is going very far afield to look for untruth. To  be consistent, these over-literals should also exact that when a guest  inadvertently knocks over a tea cup and stains a sofa, the hostess instead  of saying \"It is nothing at all! Please don't worry about it,\" ought for  the sake of truth to say, \"See what your clumsiness has done! You have  ruined my sofa!\" And when someone says \"How are you?\" instead of answering  \"Very well, thank you,\" the same truthful one should perhaps take an hour  by the clock and mention every symptom of indisposition that she can  accurately subscribe to.    While \"not at home\" is merely a phrase of politeness, to say \"I am _out_\"  after a card has been brought to you is both an untruth and an inexcusable  rudeness. Or to have an inquiry answered, \"I don't know, but I'll see,\"  and then to have the servant, after taking a card, come back with the  message \"Mrs. Jones is out\" can not fail to make the visitor feel  rebuffed. Once a card has been admitted, the visitor _must_ be admitted  also, no matter how inconvenient receiving her may be. You may send a  message that you are dressing but will be very glad to see her if she can  wait ten minutes. The visitor can either wait or say she is pressed for  time. But if she does not wait, then _she_ is rather discourteous.    Therefore, it is of the utmost importance always to leave directions at  the door such as, \"Mrs. Jones is not at home.\" \"Miss Jones will be home at  five o'clock,\" \"Mrs. Jones will be home at 5.30,\" or Mrs. Jones \"is at  home\" in the library to intimate friends, but \"not at home\" in the  drawing-room to acquaintances. It is a nuisance to be obliged to remember  either to turn an \"in\" and \"out\" card in the hail, or to ring a bell and  say, \"I am going out,\" and again, \"I have come in.\" But whatever plan or  arrangement you choose, no one at your front door should be left in doubt  and then repulsed. It is not only bad manners, it is bad housekeeping.      =THE OLD-FASHIONED DAY AT HOME=    It is doubtful if the present generation of New Yorkers knows what a day  at home is! But their mothers, at least, remember the time when the  fashionable districts were divided into regular sections, wherein on a  given day in the week, the whole neighborhood was \"at home.\" Friday sounds  familiar as the day for Washington Square! And was it Monday for lower  Fifth Avenue? At all events, each neighborhood on the day of its own,  suggested a local fete. Ladies in visiting dresses with trains and bonnets  and nose-veils and tight gloves, holding card cases, tripped demurely into  this house, out of that, and again into another; and there were always  many broughams and victorias slowly \"exercising\" up and down, and very  smart footmen standing with maroon or tan or fur rugs over their arms in  front of Mrs. Wellborn's house or Mrs. Oldname's, or the big house of Mrs.  Toplofty at the corner of Fifth Avenue. It must have been enchanting to be  a grown person in those days! Enchanting also were the C-spring victorias,  as was life in general that was taken at a slow carriage pace and not at  the motor speed of to-day. The \"day at home\" is still in fashion in  Washington, and it is ardently to be hoped that it also flourishes in many  cities and towns throughout the country or that it will be revived, for it  is a delightful custom--though more in keeping with Europe than America,  which does not care for gentle paces once it has tasted swift. A certain  young New York hostess announced that she was going to stay home on  Saturday afternoons. But the men went to the country and the women to the  opera, and she gave it up.    There are a few old-fashioned ladies, living in old-fashioned houses, and  still staying at home in the old-fashioned way to old-fashioned friends  who for decades have dropped in for a cup of tea and a chat. And there are  two maiden ladies in particular, joint chatelaines of an imposingly  beautiful old house where, on a certain afternoon of the week, if you come  in for tea, you are sure to meet not alone those prominent in the world of  fashion, but a fair admixture of artists, scientists, authors; inventors,  distinguished strangers--in a word Best Society in its truest sense. But  days at home such as these are not easily duplicated; for few houses  possess a \"salon\" atmosphere, and few hostesses achieve either the social  talent or the wide cultivation necessary to attract and interest so varied  and brilliant a company.      =MODERN CARD LEAVING: A QUESTIONABLE ACT OF POLITENESS=    The modern New York fashion in card-leaving is to dash as fast as possible  from house to house, sending the chauffeur up the steps with cards,  without ever asking if anyone is home. Some butlers announce \"Not at home\"  from force of habit even when no question is asked. There are occasions  when the visitors _must_ ask to see the hostess (see page 88); but cards  are left without asking whether a lady is at home under the following  circumstances:    Cards are left on the mother of the bride, after a wedding, also on the  mother of the groom.    Cards are also left after any formal invitation. Having been asked to  lunch or dine with a lady whom you know but slightly you should leave your  card whether you accepted the invitation or not, within three days if  possible, or at least within a week, of the date for which you were  invited. It is not considered necessary (in New York at least) to ask if  she is at home; promptness in leaving your card is, in this instance,  better manners than delaying your \"party call\" and asking if she is at  home. This matter of asking at the door is one that depends upon the  customs of each State and city, but as it is always wiser to err on the  side of politeness, it is the better policy, if in doubt, to ask \"Is Mrs.  Blank at home?\" rather than to run the risk of offending a lady who may  like to see visitors.    A card is usually left with a first invitation to a stranger who has  brought a letter of introduction, but it is more polite--even though not  necessary--to ask to be received. Some ladies make it a habit to leave a  card on everyone on their visiting list once a season.    It is correct for the mother of a debutante to leave her card as well as  her daughter's on every lady who has invited the daughter to her house,  and a courteous hostess returns all of these pasteboard visits. But  neither visit necessitates closer or even further acquaintance.      =VISITS WHICH EVERYONE MUST PAY=    Paying visits differs from leaving cards in that you must ask to be  received. A visit of condolence should be paid at once to a friend when a  death occurs in her immediate family. A lady does not call on a gentleman,  but writes him a note of sympathy.    In going to inquire for sick people, you should ask to be received, and it  is always thoughtful to take them gifts of books or fruit or flowers.    If a relative announces his engagement, you must at once go to see his  fiancee. Should she be out, you do not ask to see her mother. You do,  however, leave a card upon both ladies and you ask to see her mother if  received by the daughter.    A visit of congratulation is also paid to a new mother and a gift  invariably presented to the baby.      =MESSAGES WRITTEN ON CARDS=    \"With sympathy\" or \"With deepest sympathy\" is written on your visiting  card with flowers sent to a funeral. This same message is written on a  card and left at the door of a house of mourning, if you do not know the  family well enough to ask to be received.    \"To inquire\" is often written on a card left at the house of a sick  person, but not if you are received.    In going to see a friend who is visiting a lady whom you do not know,  whether you should leave a card on the hostess as well as on your friend  depends upon the circumstances: if the hostess is one who is socially  prominent and you are unknown, it would be better taste not to leave a  card on her, since your card afterward found without explanation might be  interpreted as an uncalled-for visit made in an attempt for a place on her  list. If, on the other hand, she is the unknown person and you are the  prominent one, your card is polite, but unwise unless you mean to include  her name on your list. But if she is one with whom you have many interests  in common, then you may very properly leave a card for her.    In leaving a card on a lady stopping at a hotel or living in an apartment  house, you should write her name in pencil across the top of your card, to  insure its being given to her, and not to some one else.    At the house of a lady whom you know well and whom you are sorry not to  find at home, it is \"friendly\" to write \"Sorry not to see you!\" or \"So  sorry to miss you!\"    Turning down a corner of a visiting card is by many intended to convey  that the visit is meant for all the ladies in the family. Other people  mean merely to show that the card was left at the door in person"]]]
