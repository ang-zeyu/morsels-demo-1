According to Strabo, a certain city of Egypt did  worship the shrew-mouse.  The Athribitae, or dwellers in Crocodilopolis,  are the people to whom he attributes this cult, which he mentions (xvii.  813) among the other local animal-worships of Egypt. {113b}  Several  porcelain examples of the field-mouse sacred to Horus (commonly called  Apollo by the Greeks) may be seen in the British Museum.    That rats and field-mice were sacred in Egypt, then, we may believe on  the evidence of the Ritual, of Strabo, and of many relics of Egyptian  art.  Herodotus, moreover, is credited when he says that the statue 'had  a mouse on its hand.'  Elsewhere, it is certain that the story of mice  gnawing the bowstrings occurs frequently as an explanation of  mouse-worship.  One of the Trojan 'mouse-stories' ran--That emigrants had  set out in prehistoric times from Crete.  The oracle advised them to  settle 'wherever they were attacked by the children of the soil.'  At  Hamaxitus in the Troad, they were assailed in the night by mice, which  ate all that was edible of their armour and bowstrings.  The colonists  made up their mind that these mice were 'the children of the soil,'  settled there, and adored the mouse Apollo. {114a}  A myth of this sort  may either be a story invented to explain the mouse-name; or a Mouse  tribe, like the Red Indian Wolves, or Crows, may actually have been  settled on the spot, and may even have resisted invasion. {114b}  Another  myth of the Troad accounted for the worship of the mouse Apollo on the  hypothesis that he had once freed the land from mice, like the Pied Piper  of Hamelin, whose pipe (still serviceable) is said to have been found in  his grave by men who were digging a mine. {114c}    Stories like these, stories attributing some great deliverance to the  mouse, or some deliverance from mice to the god, would naturally spring  up among people puzzled by their own worship of the mouse-god or of the  mouse.  We have explained the religious character of mice as the relics  of a past age in which the mouse had been a totem and mouse family names  had been widely diffused.  That there are, and have been, mice totems and  mouse family names among Semitic stocks round the Mediterranean is proved  by Prof. Robertson Smith: {115a} 'Achbor, the mouse, is an Edomite name,  apparently a stock name, as the jerboa and another mouse-name are among  the Arabs.  The same name occurs in Judah.'  Where totemism exists, the  members of each stock either do not eat the ancestral animal at all, or  only eat him on rare sacrificial occasions.  The totem of a hostile stock  may be eaten by way of insult.  In the case of the mouse, Isaiah seems to  refer to one or other of these practices (lxvi.): 'They that sanctify  themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the  midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the _mouse_, shall  be consumed together, saith the Lord.'  This is like the Egyptian  prohibition to eat 'the abominable' (that is, tabooed or forbidden) 'Rat  of Ra.'  If the unclean animals of Israel were originally the totems of  each clan, then the mouse was a totem, {115b} for the chosen people were  forbidden to eat 'the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his  kind.'  That unclean beasts, beasts not to be eaten, were originally  totems, Prof. Robertson Smith infers from Ezekiel (viii. 10, 11), where  'we find seventy of the elders of Israel--that is, the heads of  houses--worshipping in a chamber which had on its walls the figures of  all manner of unclean' (tabooed) 'creeping things, and quadrupeds, _even  all the idols of the House of Israel_.'  Some have too hastily concluded  that the mouse was a sacred animal among the neighbouring Philistines.  After the Philistines had captured the Ark and set it in the house of  Dagon, the people were smitten with disease.  They therefore, in  accordance with a well-known savage magical practice, made five golden  representations of the diseased part, and five golden mice, as 'a  trespass offering to the Lord of Israel,' and so restored the Ark. {116}  Such votive offerings are common still in Catholic countries, and the  mice of gold by no means prove that the Philistines had ever worshipped  mice.    * * * * *    Turning to India from the Mediterranean basin, and the Aryan, Semitic,  and Egyptian tribes on its coasts, we find that the mouse was the sacred  animal of Rudra.  'The mouse, Rudra, is thy beast,' says the Yajur Veda,  as rendered by Grohmann in his 'Apollo Smintheus.'  Grohmann recognises  in Rudra a deity with most of the characteristics of Apollo.  In later  Indian mythology, the mouse is an attribute of Ganeca, who, like Apollo  Smintheus, is represented in art with his foot upon a mouse.    Such are the chief appearances of the mouse in ancient religion.  If he  really was a Semitic totem, it may, perhaps, be argued that his  prevalence in connection with Apollo is the result of a Semitic leaven in  Hellenism.  Hellenic invaders may have found Semitic mouse-tribes at  home, and incorporated the alien stock deity with their own  Apollo-worship.  In that case the mouse, while still originally a totem,  would not be an Aryan totem.  But probably the myths and rites of the  mouse, and their diffusion, are more plausibly explained on our theory  than on that of De Gubernatis: 'The Pagan sun-god crushes under his foot  the Mouse of Night.  When the cat's away, the mice may play; the shadows  of night dance when the moon is absent.' {117a}  This is one of the  quaintest pieces of mythological logic.  Obviously, when the cat (the  moon) is away, the mice (the shadows) _cannot_ play: there is no light to  produce a shadow.  As usually chances, the scholars who try to resolve  all the features of myth into physical phenomena do not agree among  themselves about the mouse.  While the mouse is the night, according to  M. de Gubernatis, in Grohmann's opinion the mouse is the lightning.  He  argues that the lightning was originally regarded by the Aryan race as  the 'flashing tooth of a beast,' especially of a mouse.  Afterwards men  came to identify the beast with his teeth, and, behold, the lightning and  the mouse are convertible mythical terms!  Now it is perfectly true that  savages regard many elemental phenomena, from eclipses to the rainbow, as  the result of the action of animals.  The rainbow is a serpent; {117b}  thunder is caused by the thunder-bird, who has actually been shot in  Dacotah, and who is familiar to the Zulus; while rain is the milk of a  heavenly cow--an idea recurring in the 'Zend Avesta.'  But it does not  follow because savages believe in these meteorological beasts that all  the beasts in myth were originally meteorological.  Man raised a serpent  to the skies, perhaps, but his interest in the animal began on earth, not  in the clouds.  It is excessively improbable, and quite unproved, that  any race ever regarded lightning as the flashes of a mouse's teeth.  The  hypothesis is a jeu d'esprit, like the opposite hypothesis about the  mouse of Night.  In these, and all the other current theories of the  Sminthian Apollo, the widely diffused worship of ordinary mice, and such  small deer, has been either wholly neglected, or explained by the first  theory of symbolism that occurred to the conjecture of a civilised  observer.  The facts of savage animal-worship, and their relations to  totemism, seem still unknown to or unappreciated by scholars, with the  exception of Mr. Sayce, who recognises totemism as the origin of the  zoomorphic element in Egyptian religion.    Our explanation, whether adequate or not, is not founded on an isolated  case.  If Apollo superseded and absorbed the worship of the mouse, he did  no less for the wolf, the ram, the dolphin, and several other animals  whose images were associated with his own.  The Greek religion was more  refined and anthropomorphic than that of Egypt.  In Egypt the animals  were still adored, and the images of the gods had bestial heads.  In  Greece only a few gods, and chiefly in very archaic statues, had bestial  heads; but beside the other deities the sculptor set the owl, eagle,  wolf, serpent, tortoise, mouse, or whatever creature was the local  favourite of the deity. {118a}  Probably the deity had, in the majority  of cases, superseded the animal and succeeded to his honours.  But the  conservative religious sentiment retained the beast within the courts and  in the suit and service of the anthropomorphic god. {118b}    The process by which the god ousted the beasts may perhaps be observed in  Samoa.  There (as Dr. Turner tells us in his 'Samoa') each family has its  own sacred animal, which it may not eat.  If this law be transgressed,  the malefactor is supernaturally punished in a variety of ways.  But,  while each family has thus its totem, four or five different families  recognise, in owl, crab, lizard, and so on, incarnations of the same god,  say of Tongo.  If Tongo had a temple among these families, we can readily  believe that images of the various beasts in which he was incarnate would  be kept within the consecrated walls.  Savage ideas like these, if they  were ever entertained in Greece, would account for the holy animals of  the different deities.  But it is obvious that the phenomena which we  have been studying may be otherwise explained.  It may be said that the  Sminthian Apollo was only revered as the enemy and opponent of mice.  St.  Gertrude (whose heart was eaten by mice) has the same role in France.  {119}  The worship of Apollo, and the badge of the mouse, would, on this  principle, be diffused by colonies from some centre of the faith.  The  images of mice in Apollo's temples would be nothing more than votive  offerings.

When first dressed the clothes  should not be put on over the head, but drawn on over the feet, for  luck. When first taken from the room in which it was born it must  be carried up stairs before going down, so that it will rise in the  world. In any case it must be carried up stairs or up the street,  the first time it is taken out. It is also considered in England and  Scotland unlucky to cut the baby's nails or hair before it is twelve  months old. The saying:         Born on Monday, fair in the face;       Born on Tuesday, full of God's grace;       Born on Wednesday, the best to be had;       Born on Thursday, merry and glad;       Born on Friday, worthily given;       Born on Saturday, work hard for a living;       Born on Sunday, shall never know want,    is known with various changes all over the Christian world; one  deviation from the original makes Friday's child \"free in giving.\"  Thursday has one very lucky hour just before sunrise.         The child that is born on the Sabbath day       Is bonny and good and gay,    While         He who is born on New Year's morn       Will have his own way as sure as you're born.    And         He who is born on Easter morn       Shall never know care, or want, or harm.      SECRET ART OF CATCHING FISH.    Put the oil of rhodium on the bait, when fishing with a hook, and you  will always succeed.      TO CATCH FISH.    Take the juice of smallage or lovage, and mix with any kind of bait.  As long as there remain any kind of fish within yards of your hook,  you will find yourself busy pulling them out.      CERTAIN CURE FOR DRUNKENNESS.    Take of sulphate of iron 5 grains, magnesia 10 grains, peppermint  water 11 drachms, spirits of nutmeg 1 drachm. Administer this twice  a day. It acts as a tonic and stimulant and so partially supplies the  place of the accustomed liquor, and prevents that absolute physical  and moral prostration that follows a sudden breaking off from the use  of stimulating drinks.

The maximum weight (140-1/2 lbs.)  of the male is attained at the age of 40; that of the female (nearly  124 lbs.) is not attained until 50; from which ages they decline  afterward, the male to 127-1/4 lbs., the female to 100 lbs., nearly a  stone. The full-grown adult is 20 times as heavy as a new-born  infant. In the first year he triples his weight, afterwards the growth  proceeds in geometrical progression, so that if 50 infants in their  first year weigh 1,000 lbs., they will in the second weigh 1,210 lbs.;  in the third 1,331: in the fourth 1464 lbs.; the term remaining very  constant up to the ages of 11-12 in females, and 12-13 in males, where  it must be nearly doubled; afterwards it may be continued, and will be  found very nearly correct up to the age of 18 or 19, when the growth  proceeds very slowly. At an equality of age the male is generally  heavier than the female. Towards the age of 12 years only an  individual of each sex has the same weight. The male attains the  maximum weight at about the age of 40, and he begins to lose it very  sensibly toward 60. At 80 he loses about 13.2328 lbs., and the stature  is diminished 2.756 inches. Females attain their maximum weight at  about 50. The mean weight of a mature man is 104 lbs., and of an  average woman 94 lbs. In old age they lose about 12 or 14 lbs. Men  weigh most at 40, women at 50, and begin to lose"]]]
