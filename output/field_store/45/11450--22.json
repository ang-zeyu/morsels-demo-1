This--the bow picked up a  trifle from the strings--throws the sixteenths into relief. As I have  already said, tone color is for the main part controlled by the bow. If  I draw the bow above the fingerboard instead of keeping it near the  bridge, I have a decided contrast in color. This color contrast may  always be established: playing near the bridge results in a clear and  sharp tone, playing near the fingerboard in a veiled and velvety one.                              SUGGESTIONS IN TEACHING    \"I find that, aside from the personal illustration absolutely necessary  when teaching, that an appeal to the pupil's imagination usually bears  fruit. In developing tone-quality, let us say, I tell the pupil his  phrases should have a golden, mellow color, the tonal equivalent of the  hues of the sunrise. I vary my pictures according to the circumstances  and the pupil, in most cases, reacts to them. In fast bowings, for  instance, I make three color distinctions or rather sound distinctions.  There is the 'color of rain,' when a fast bow is pushed gently over the  strings, while not allowed to jump; the 'color of snowflakes' produced  when the hairs of the bow always touch the strings, and the wood dances;  and 'the color of hail' (which seldom occurs in the classics), when in  the real characteristic _spiccato_ the whole bow leaves the string.\"                             THE ART AND THE SCHOOLS    In reply to another question, Mr. Letz added: \"Great violin playing is  great violin playing, irrespective of school or nationality. Of course  the Belgians and French have notable elegance, polish, finish in detail.  The French lay stress on sensuous beauty of tone. The German temperament  is perhaps broader, neglecting sensuous beauty for beauty of idea,  developing the scholarly side. Sarasate, the Spaniard, is a unique  national figure. The Slavs seem to have a natural gift for the  violin--perhaps because of centuries of repression--and are passionately  temperamental. In their playing we find that melancholy, combined with  an intense craving for joy, which runs through all Slavonic music and  literature. Yet, all said and done, Art is and remains first of all  international, and the great violinist is a great artist, no matter what  his native land.\"                                          XIII                                  DAVID MANNES                      THE PHILOSOPHY OF VIOLIN TEACHING      That David Mannes, the well-known violinist and conductor, so long  director of the New York Music School Settlement, would be able to speak  in an interesting and authoritative manner on his art, was a foregone  conclusion in the writer's mind. A visit to the educator's own beautiful  \"Music School\" confirmed this conviction. In reply to some questions  concerning his own study years Mr. Mannes spoke of his work with  Heinrich de Ahna, Karl Halir and Eugene Ysaye. \"When I came to de Ahna  in Berlin, I was, unfortunately, not yet ready for him, and so did not  get much benefit from his instruction. In the case of Halir, to whom I  went later, I was in much better shape to take advantage of what he  could give me, and profited accordingly. It is a point any student may  well note--that when he thinks of studying with some famous teacher  he be technically and musically equipped to take advantage of all that  the latter may be able to give him. Otherwise it is a case of love's  labor lost on the part of both. Karl Halir was a sincere and very  thorough teacher. He was a Spohr player _par excellence_, and I have  never found his equal in the playing of Spohr's _Gesangsscene_. With him  I studied Kreutzer, Rode, Fiorillo; and to know Halir as a teacher was  to know him at his best; since as a public performer--great violinist as  he was--he did not do himself justice, because he was too nervous and  high-strung.              [Illustration: DAVID MANNES, with hand-written note]                                 STUDYING WITH YSAYE    \"It was while sitting among the first violins in the New York Symphony  Orchestra that I first heard Ysaye. And for the first time in my life I  heard a man with whom I fervently _wanted_ to study; an artist whose  whole attitude with regard to tone and sound reproduction embodied my  ideals.    \"I worked with Ysaye in Brussels and in his cottage at Godinne. Here he  taught much as Liszt did at Weimar, a group of from ten to twenty  disciples. Early in the morning he went fishing in the Meuse, then back  to breakfast and then came the lessons: not more than three or four a  day. Those who studied drew inspiration from him as the pianists of the  Weimar circle did from their Master. In fact, Ysaye's standpoint toward  music had a good deal in common with Rubinstein's and he often said he  wished he could play the violin as Rubinstein did the piano. Ysaye is an  artist who has transcended his own medium--he has become a poet of  sound. And unless the one studying with him could understand and  appreciate this fact he made a poor teacher. But to me, in all humility,  he was and will always remain a wonderful inspiration. As an influence  in my career his marvelous genius is unique. In my own teaching I have  only to recall his tone, his playing in his little cottage on the banks  of the Meuse which the tide of war has swept away, to realize in a  cumulative sense the things he tried to make plain to me then. Ysaye  taught the technic of expression as against the expression of technic.  He gave the lessons of a thousand teachers in place of the lessons of  one. The greatest technical development was required by Ysaye of a  pupil; and given this pre-requisite, he could open up to him ever  enlarging horizons of musical beauty.    \"Nor did he think that the true beauty of violin playing must depend  upon six to eight hours of daily practice work. I absolutely believe  with Ysaye that unless a student can make satisfactory progress with  three hours of practice a day, he should not attempt to play the violin.  Inability to do so is in itself a confession of failure at the outset.  Nor do I think it possible to practice the violin intensively more than  three-quarters of an hour at a time. In order to utilize his three hours  of practice to the best advantage the student should divide them into  four periods, with intervals of rest between each, and these rest  periods might simply represent a transfer of energy--which is a rest in  itself--to reading or some other occupation not necessarily germane to  music, yet likely to stimulate interest in some other art.                      SOME INITIAL PRINCIPLES OF VIOLIN STUDY    \"The violin student first and foremost should accustom himself to  practicing purely technical exercises without notes. The scales and  arpeggios should never be played otherwise and books of scales should be  used only as a reference. Quite as important as scale practice are  broken chords. On the violin these cannot be played _solidly_, as on the  piano; but must be studied as arpeggios, in the most exhaustive way,  harmonically and technically. Their great value lies in developing an  innate musical sense, in establishing an idea of tonality and harmony  that becomes so deeply rooted that every other key is as natural to the  player as is the key of C. Work of this kind can never be done ideally  in class. But every individual student must himself come to realize the  necessity of doing technical work without notes as a matter of daily  exercise, even though his time be limited. Perhaps the most difficult of  all lessons is learning to hold the violin. There are pupils to whom  holding the instrument presents insurmountable obstacles. Such pupils,  instead of struggling in vain with a physical difficulty, might rather  take up the study of the 'cello, whose weight rests on the floor. That  many a student was not intended to be a violin player by nature is  proved by the various inventions, chin-rests, braces, intended to supply  what nature has not supplied. The study of the violin should never be  allowed if it is going to result in actual physical deformity: raising  of the left shoulder, malformation of the back, or eruptions resulting  from chin-rest pressure. These are all evidences of physical unfitness,  or of incorrect teaching.                          THE PHILOSOPHY OF VIOLIN TEACHING    \"Class study is for the advanced student, not the beginner. In the  beginning only the closest personal contact between the individual pupil  and the teacher is desirable. To borrow an analogy from nature, the  student may be compared to the young bird whose untrained wings will not  allow him to take any trial flights unaided by his natural guardian. For  the beginning violinist the principal thing to do is to learn the 'voice  placing' of the violin. This goes hand in hand with the proper--which is  the easy and natural--manner of holding the violin, bow study, and an  appreciation of the acoustics of the instrument. The student's attention  should at once be called to the marvelous and manifold qualities of the  violin tone, and he should at once familiarize himself with the  development of those contrasts of stress and pressure, ease and  relaxation which are instrumental in its production. The analogies  between the violin voice and the human voice should also be developed.  The violin itself must to all intents become a part of the player  himself, just as the vocal chords are part of the human body. It should  not be considered a foreign tone-producing instrument adjusted to the  body of the performer; but an extension, a projection of his physical  self. In a way it is easier for the violinist to get at the chords of  the violin and make them sound, since they are all exposed, which is not  the case with the singer.    \"There are two dangerous points in present-day standards of violin"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15540"],[0,"Across India; Or, Live Boys in the Far East (#18)"],[1," they are such. This excellent  map behind me, which is worthy of the highest praise as a home-made  production, will enable me to give you a better idea of my subject.\"    \"The ingenious artist has colored the different divisions so that you can  make them out. The three presidencies are the most notable divisions, and  they include all the inferior ones. The Bengal Presidency includes the  north-eastern part, from Afghanistan to Burma. The Madras, the southeastern  part, with most of the peninsula. The Bombay covers the greater part of the  west coast. The Deccan is a portion of the peninsula.\"    \"It would take me three weeks to describe all the divisions of India, and I  shall not attempt to do it. It would be better done as you travel over the  country. Eighteen of them are Directly governed by the English, and  thirteen of them are still under the nominal control of the native princes;  but all the latter have a British resident as the adviser of the reigning  rajah.    \"The English-speaking people of India are a mere bagatelle compared with  the enormous population, being only 238,499; but with the army they have  been able to hold the country in subjection. The British government takes a  fatherly interest in the native states, and they have been loyal without  exception in later years, though the history of India will show that not  all of them have always been so.\"    \"Until the year 1858 the government was in the hands of the East India  Company, of which you will learn more in the history of India. In 1877 her  majesty, the queen, assumed the title of Empress of India, and she is the  ruler of the country. The government of the highest resort in the affairs  of India is a secretary of state, residing in London. He is a member of the  cabinet, and has an under-secretary. He is assisted by a council of ten or  fifteen members.\"    \"The executive government, administered in India, is the governor-general  in council. He is the viceroy of the crown, and is assisted by six members  of the executive council, each of whom has his function in the affairs of  the state; and the commander-in-chief of the army is _ex-officio_ a  seventh member. This body is really the cabinet of the viceroy. The laws  are made by this council, with from six to a dozen members appointed by the  viceroy. This is the way the machine is operated.    \"The civil service of the government is rendered mainly by Europeans,  though the natives are eligible to office as employees. The English system  in the appointment of its officials prevails, and all candidates are  regularly examined. Those of you who have looked over Bradshaw's 'Guide to  India' will find descriptions of the several examinations for various  employments.\"    \"I wish the English system could be transferred to the United States,\" said  Uncle Moses with great unction.    \"You have made a beginning, and perhaps you will come to it in time. The  civil service prevails in the provinces and states of India as well as in  the general government, though the competition is open to the natives.    \"The soldiers of the East India Company became the military force of the  British crown when the government was assumed. The English army in India  now consists of 74,033 men of all arms, and the native army of 144,735, a  total standing army of 218,786, which is its strength at the present time.  It is a curious fact that, as the native troops are recruited by voluntary  enlistment, all castes and races, including Brahmins, are drawn in by the  good pay and the pension promised.    \"The navy of the East India Company was superseded by the royal navy in  1863; and a dozen or fifteen ships of war are stationed in these waters,  with an admiral as commander-in-chief, whose headquarters are at Bombay.  The Indian treasury contributes annually to the expense of this force. The  great steam navigation companies are available to recruit this branch of  the defence of the country.    \"The laws are made, and the institutions of India are regulated, by  Parliament; and the administration of law and justice is substantially the  same as in the United Kingdom. The regular police consists of 160,000  officers and men; and a portion of the expense of this force is defrayed by  the towns, the large cities mainly. Besides the city police, there are  560,000 in charge of the villages. The constabulary are natives, with  European officers, one to every seven square miles and 1,300 inhabitants,  indicating peaceful communities. About 12,000 of the 82,000 persons under  sentence are in the convict colonies at the Andaman Islands.    \"The educational institutions are progressive, and 400 newspapers are  published in various languages, most of them with small circulations,  20,000 being the largest in India. The post and telegraph systems are well  cared for; and 17,564 miles of railway are in operation, with others in  process of construction. The manufactures, both in metal and fibre, have  always been remarkably fine, and the quality is still kept up. Cotton  factories have been established, with native labor, which promise great  results to the industry of the country.    \"The loss of life on account of famine, caused by the failure of the  monsoon rains, has been terrific in some years. Canals and reservoirs for  irrigation as well as navigation have been built in order to remove this  evil. In 1874 L16,000,000 was expended in the relief of sufferers by the  government. Since that time a famine fund has been established; and in  years of plenty a million and a half sterling has been set aside for this  object.    \"The excessive density of the population has induced the government to  favor emigration; and over a hundred thousand have gone to British  Guiana and the West Indies, and other countries. The currency of India  will be likely to bother you a little. The silver _rupee_ is the unit;  though when you see 'R.x.' over or at the left of a column of figures,  it means tens of _rupees_. The nominal value of a _rupee_ is two  shillings, about half a dollar of your money; but it is never worth that  in gold, the standard of England in recent years. It was some years ago  at a premium of twopence, but for the last three years it has averaged  only 1_s_. 5-1/8_d_. Its value varies with the gold price of silver in  London.    \"There is also a government paper currency in circulation, amounting to  L16,000,000 sterling. The smallest copper coin is the _pie_, worth half  a farthing, equal to a quarter of a cent of your money. Three of them  make a _pice_, a farthing and a half, three-quarters of a cent. Four  _pice_ make an _anna_, a penny and a half, three cents. Sixteen _annas_  make a _rupee_. Sixteen _rupees_ make a gold _mohur_.\"    \"Those small pieces are about as insignificant as those of Egypt,\"  suggested Mr. Woolridge.    \"There are not many millionaires among the natives, and these smaller coins  are mostly used among them. They are convenient also to the stingy  Englishman when the plate is passed around in church,\" added his lordship  with a chuckle, which pleased Uncle Moses more than the remark. India has a  public debt of about L200,000,000, contracted for railways, canals, war,  and other purposes. The revenue last year was L84,932,100, and the  expenditures were L84,661,700. Not a large margin; but you must multiply  the pounds by five, or nearly that, to reduce them to dollars.    \"The poppy is extensively cultivated in India; and the export tax in  Calcutta amounts to six and a quarter millions, in Bombay, to three and a  half millions, on the manufactured opium. The producer sends his crop to  the government factory, whence it is sold to the exporter; all this to  prevent frauds on the revenue.    \"Wages and prices have gone up under British rule. The best class of  laborers get four _annas_ a day, and others not more than two,--six to  twelve cents a day. Grain for food is a penny for two pounds,--a cent a  pound. Women and children earn small wages. The clothing of the poor is  scanty and cheap; fuel costs nothing; and rent for dwellings is hardly  known. The masses in the country, not laborers, live on the land as owners  or lessees. There has never been anything like a poor-law, and ordinarily  there is no need of such.    \"It would be quite impossible for me to give the history of India in detail  in the limited time at my command, especially as we are now approaching the  land. Vasco da Gama, the Portuguese navigator, was the first to reach the  East Indies, in 1498; but his countrymen never did much trading here, being  more intent upon securing the rich treasures of the Indies. As early as  1600 the English turned their attention in this direction. Companies were  formed; but being driven by the Dutch from the islands which they still  hold, they began to make settlements on the coast of this peninsula. Madras  dates from 1639, Bombay from 1686, Calcutta from 1686. The Company said,  'Let us make a nation in India;' and they went to work at once to do it.  They accomplished their purpose, fostered by the government, raised and  borrowed money, and in the course of time had an army and a navy, and ruled  the country. They defeated the Grand Mogul, drove the French out of the  peninsula, and were generally very prosperous.    \"In 1833 Parliament revoked all the trading privileges of the company; and  their dividends to stockholders were then paid out of the taxes assessed on  the people of India. They could not trade and could not govern except under  the control of Parliament. All the wars of India have been fought by the  British nation. After the mutiny, of which more hereafter, the company was  compelled to cede its powers to the crown in 1858.    \"The native soldiers of Bengal were called Sepoys, and the name has been  applied to all native troops. Some small mutinies occurred in this arm of  the service in the presidency. Early in 1857 the garrison of Meerut, near"]]]
