The King's Own in particular distinguished itself  in taking a stubbornly contested and strongly held hill.    At dawn we were under way. We had heard reports during the night that the  Turks had evacuated Tuz--but it was not long before we found that such was  not the case. They were still there and showed every evidence of staying.  A small village five or six miles to the southwest was also bitterly  contested. Our cavalry did some excellent work, capturing small hills held  with machine-guns.    We advanced down the road beside the hills. A mile before reaching Tuz we  ran into the Aq Su, a large stream flowing through a narrow cleft in the  hills. Fortunately the river was very low, and there were several places  where it was spread out over such a wide bed that it seemed as if it might  be possible to get the cars across. I emptied a Ford van and set out to do  some prospecting. First I went up-stream, which was toward the mountains,  but I could not go far, for there was an ancient fort situated at the  mouth of the gorge, and it had not been evacuated. Finding a likely  looking place a little below, I made a cast and just succeeded in getting  through. It was easy to see that it would not be possible for the  low-swung Rolls to cross under their own power, for the fly-wheel would  throw the water up into the motor. There was nothing to do but send back  for artillery horses to pull the armored cars across.    Meanwhile, as our artillery had practically ceased firing on the town and  the Turks seemed to have entirely evacuated it, I thought that I would go  up and take over and see whether there had not been some valuable  documents left behind. I drove along past some abandoned artillery into  the main street. A number of Turkish soldiers came up to surrender and I  told them to have the Reis Beledia--the town mayor--report to me. When he  came I directed him to take me to the quarters of the Turkish commanding  general. As we drove through the covered bazaar everything was closed.  Scarcely anybody was in the streets--but I could see the inhabitants  peeping out from behind lattices. It was a good thing to have the old  mayor along, for he served as an excellent hostage, and I kept close watch  upon him. He brought me to a prosperous, neat-looking house with heavy  wooden doors. In response to his summons an old woman came and ushered us  into a large, cool room, well furnished and with beautiful Kurdish rugs.  There we found four young girls, who, it was explained to me, formed the  Turkish general's \"field harem.\" He had left in too much of a hurry to  take them with him. They were Kurds and Circassians, or Georgians--and the  general had shown no lack of taste in his selection! True to the tradition  of the Garden of Eden, this harem proved disastrous to a brother officer  who, having heard of my capture, sent me \"priority\" over the field service  lines a ribald message as to its disposition. \"Priority\" wires are sent  only on affairs of the greatest importance, and when I left the country my  friend was slated to explain matters before a court martial. There were no  papers of any great value to be found, and I told the mayor to take me to  the more important ammunition and supply dumps. By the time I had located  these some cavalry had come in, and I went back to the river to help get  the fighting cars across.    Once we had these safely over we set out in pursuit of the Turks. The next  town of importance was a ramshackle mud-walled affair called Tauq, twenty  miles beyond, on the far side of a river known as the Tauq Chai. The  leading cars pursued to within sight of the town and came in for a good  deal of shelling.    The Turks we captured were in far poorer shape than those we had recently  taken on the Euphrates front. Their shoes were worn out, they were very  ragged, and, what was of greater significance, they were badly nourished.  The length of their line of communications had evidently severely strained  them. Supplies had to come overland all the way from Nisibin, which is  more than a hundred miles beyond Mosul. The broken country made the  transportation a difficult problem to solve. It was a miracle that they  had the morale to fight as they did under such disadvantageous conditions.    Here, as throughout the campaign, it was a continual source of pride to  see the way in which our soldiers behaved to the natives. I never heard of  a case in which man, woman, or child was wrongfully treated. Minor  offenses were sometimes committed, but these were quickly righted. No  doubt there were isolated instances of wrong-doing, for in such a large  army there are bound to be degenerate individuals from whose conduct it is  unfair to judge the whole.    That night we encamped in the outskirts of Tuz, not far from the Turkish  aerodrome. Next morning one of the batteries was ordered to reconnoitre as  far as the town--pursuing a different route than that taken on the  previous day. The commanding officer asked me to go along because of my  knowledge of Arabic. The road followed the telegraph-lines, and part of  the time that was the only way in which we could distinguish it from the  surrounding country. Of course, the map was hopelessly incorrect. The  villages were not even rightly named. A great deal of reconnoitring was  called for, and in one village we had to knock the corner off a mud house  to enable us to make a sharp right-angle turn. The natives were in pitiful  condition. The Turks had not only taken all their crops, but even the  grain that should be reserved to sow for the following year. The sheep had  been killed in the lambing season, so the flocks were sadly depleted. Such  standing grain as there was left looked flourishing. The wheat waved above  the cars.    As we came out of a deep, broad ravine that had caused us much delay and  difficulty, we caught sight of an attractive town situated on a steep,  flat-topped hill. Upon drawing near, a fine-looking, white-bearded Arab  rode up on a small gray mare. He said that he was the head man of the  town; that he hated the Turks, and would like to be of any assistance  possible to us. I asked him if the enemy had evacuated Tauq. He replied  that they had. I then asked him if he were positive about it. He offered  to accompany us to prove it. The trail was so bad that we could not go  fast, and he rode along beside us at a hand-gallop.    When we came to the river in front of the town we found that it was  impossible to get the armored cars across. The Turks had evidently fallen  back, but not far, for they were dropping in shells with regularity. Our  Arab friend told us that there was a bridge six miles up-stream, but it  was too late for us to attempt it, and we turned back to Tuz after  arranging with Sheikh Muttar to meet us in the morning.    [Illustration: The Kurd and his wife]    [Illustration: Sheik Muttar and the two Kurds]    Next day we found him waiting for us as he had promised. With him were two  handsome Kurds. One of them had his wife perched behind him on the horse's  crupper. Together they undertook to guide us up to the bridge. It was  invariably difficult to find out from natives whether or not a road was  passable for motor-cars. They were accustomed to think only in terms of  horses or men, and could not realize that a bad washout might be  impassable for automobiles. Curiously enough, even those natives whom we  had taken along with us on several reconnaissances as guides could not be  trusted to give an opinion as to the feasibility of a proposed route. We  experienced no little trouble in following our guides to the bridge,  although we afterward discovered a good road that cut off from the main  trail about half-way between Tuz and Tauq.    When we reached the bridge we found it to be a solid, well-built affair of  recent construction. The retreating Turks had tried to blow it up, but the  most vital charges had failed to go off, so the damage done would not be  sufficiently serious to stop our passage, after six or seven hours'  preliminary work. We immediately sent back for the engineers, and put in  the time while waiting by taking a much-needed bath in the rapids beneath  one of the side arches. Every one who has wandered about in the waste  places of the world can recall certain swims that will always stand out in  his memory. Perhaps they have been after a long and arduous hunt--perhaps  at the end of a weary march. Our plunge in the Tauq Chai took its place  among these.    In the late afternoon we drove back to Tuz. Our camp there was anything  but cheerful, for swarms of starving townsfolk hovered on the outskirts  ready to pounce on any refuse that the men threw away. Discarded tin cans  were cleaned out until the insides shone like mirrors. The men gave away  everything they could possibly spare from their rations. As the news  spread, the starving mountain Kurds began straggling in; and the gruesome  band made one glad to leave camp early and return after dark. Our line of  communication was so extended that it was impossible to attempt any relief  work.    The following morning we crossed over the bridge with little trouble, but  ran into a lot of difficulty when we tried to make our way down to the  town. A couple of miles above the main town there is a small settlement  grouped on a hill around the mosque of Zain El Abidin. The \"mutabelli,\" or  keeper of the shrine, is an important personage in the community, so when  he appeared riding a richly caparisoned stallion and offered to accompany  us to the town, we welcomed the opportunity of going in under such good  auspices. We decided to take Seyid Mustapha, for that was his name, in one  of the Ford vans with us. It was comparatively easy to get the light car  up over the precipitous, rocky trail; and eventually one of the fighting  cars succeeded in following. I was driving, with Mustapha beside me. In  front of us on a white"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13670"],[0,"The Happy Family (#18)"],[1,"went  clattering by, and he, Andy Green, would be pointed out by the knowing  ones as a fellow that was going to ride in the contest and that stood  a good chance of winning. For Andy was but human, that he dreamed of  these things; besides, does not the jumping through blazing hoops and  over sagging bunting while one rides, whet insiduously one's appetite  for the plaudits of the crowd?    The reality was different. He was in Great Falls, but he had not  ridden vaingloriously down Central Avenue surrounded by the Happy  Family, and watched by the gaping populace. Instead, he had chosen a  side street and he had ridden alone, and no one had seemed to know or  care who he might be. His horse had not backed, wild-eyed, before an  approaching car, and he had not done any pretty riding. Instead, his  horse had scarce turned an eye toward the jangling bell when he  crossed the track perilously close to the car, and he had gone  \"side-wheeling\" decorously down the street--and Andy hated a pacing  horse. The Happy Family was in town, but he did not know where. Andy  kicked his horse into a gallop and swore bitterly that he did not  care. He did not suppose that they gave him a thought, other than  those impelled by their jeopardized pockets. And that, he assured  himself pessimistically, is friendship!    He tied the hired horse to the fence and went away to the stables and  fraternized with a hump-backed jockey who knew a few things himself  about riding and was inclined to talk unprofessionally. It was not at  all as Andy had pictured the opening day, but he got through the time  somehow until the crowd gathered and the racing began. Then he showed  himself in the crowd of \"peelers\" and their friends, as unconcernedly  as he might; and as unobtrusively. The Happy Family, he observed, was  not there, though he met Chip face to face and had a short talk with  him. Chip was the only one, aside from the Old Man, who really  understood. Billy Roberts was there, and he greeted Andy  commiseratingly, as one speaks to the sick or to one in mourning; the  tone made Andy grind his teeth, though he knew in his heart that Billy  Roberts wished him well--up to the point of losing the contest to him,  which was beyond human nature. Billy Roberts was a rider and knew--or  thought he knew--just how \"sore\" Andy must be feeling. Also, in the  kindness of his heart he tried blunderingly to hide his knowledge.    \"Going up against the rough ones?\" he queried with careful  carelessness, in the hope of concealing that he had heard the tale of  Andy's disgrace.    \"I sure am,\" Andy returned laconically, with no attempt to conceal  anything.    Billy Roberts opened his eyes wide, and his mouth a little before he  recovered from his surprise. \"Well, good luck to yuh,\" he managed to  say, \"only so yuh don't beat me to it. I was kinda hoping yuh was too  bashful to get out and ride before all the ladies.\"    Andy, remembering his days in the sawdust ring, smiled queerly; but  his heart warmed to Billy Roberts amazingly.    They were leaning elbows on the fence below the grand stand, watching  desultorily the endless preparatory manoeuvres of three men astride  the hind legs of three pacers in sulkies. \"This side-wheeling business  gives me a pain,\" Billy remarked, as the pacers ambled by for the  fourth or fifth time. \"I like _caballos_ that don't take all day to  wind 'em up before they go. I been looking over our bunch. They's  horses in that corral that are sure going to do things to us twenty  peelers!\"    \"By gracious, yes!\" Andy was beginning to feel himself again. \"That  blue hoss--uh course yuh heard how he got me, and heard it with  trimmings--yuh may think he's a man-eater; but while he's a bad hoss,  all right, he ain't the one that'll get yuh. Yuh want t' watch out,  Billy, for that HS sorrel. He's plumb wicked. He's got a habit uh  throwing himself backwards. They're keeping it quiet, maybe--but I've  seen him do it three times in one summer.\"    \"All right--thanks. I didn't know that. But the blue roan--\"    \"The blue roan'll pitch and bawl and swap ends on yuh and raise hell  all around, but he can be rode. That festive bunch up in the reserve  seats'll think it's awful, and that the HS sorrel is a lady's hoss  alongside him, but a real rider can wear him out. But that  sorrel--when yuh think yuh got him beat, Billy, is when yuh want to  watch out!\"    Billy turned his face away from a rolling dustcloud that came down the  home stretch with the pacers, and looked curiously at Andy. Twice he  started to speak and did not finish. Then: \"A man can be a sure-enough  rider, and get careless and let a horse pile him off him when he ain't  looking, just because he knows he can ride that horse,\" he said with a  certain diffidence.    \"By gracious, yes!\" Andy assented emphatically. And that was the  nearest they came to discussing a delicate matter which was in the  minds of both.    Andy was growing more at ease and feeling more optimistic every  minute. Three men still believed in him, which was much. Also, the  crowd could not flurry him as it did some of the others who were not  accustomed to so great an audience; rather, it acted as a tonic and  brought back the poise, the easy self-confidence which had belonged to  one Andre de Greno, champion bareback rider. So that, when the  rough-riding began, Andy's nerves were placidly asleep.    At the corral in the infield, where the horses and men were  foregathered, Andy met Slim and Happy Jack; but beyond his curt  \"Hello\" and an amazed \"Well, by golly!\" from Slim, no words passed.  Across the corral he glimpsed some of the others--Pink and Weary, and  farther along, Cal Emmett and Jack Bates; but they made no sign if  they saw him, and he did not go near them. He did not know when his  turn would come to ride, and he had a horse to saddle at the command  of the powers that were. Coleman, the man who had collected the  horses, almost ran over him. He said \"Hello, Green,\" and passed on,  for his haste was great.    Horse after horse was saddled and led perforce out into the open of  the infield; man after man mounted, with more or less trouble, and  rode to triumph or defeat. Billy Roberts was given a white-eyed little  bay, and did some great riding. The shouts and applause from the grand  stand rolled out to them in a great wave of sound. Billy mastered the  brute and rode him back to the corral white-faced and with beads of  sweat standing thick on his forehead.    \"It ain't going to be such damn' easy money--that two hundred,\" he  confided pantingly to Andy, who stood near. \"The fellow that gets it  will sure have to earn it.\"    Andy nodded and moved out where he could get a better view. Then  Coleman came and informed him hurriedly that he came next, and Andy  went back to his place. The horse he was to ride he had never seen  before that day. He was a long-legged brown, with scanty mane and a  wicked, rolling eye. He looked capable of almost any deviltry, but  Andy did not give much time to speculating upon what he would try to  do. He was still all eyes to the infield where his predecessor was  gyrating. Then a sudden jump loosened him so that he grabbed the  horn--and it was all over with that particular applicant, so far as  the purse and the championship belt were concerned. He was out of the  contest, and presently he was also back at the corral, explaining  volubly--and uselessly--just how it came about. He appeared to have a  very good reason for \"pulling leather,\" but Andy was not listening and  only thought absently that the fellow was a fool to make a talk for  himself.    Andy was clutching the stirrup and watching a chance to put his toe  into it, and the tall brown horse was circling backwards with  occasional little side-jumps. When it was quite clear that the horse  did not mean to be mounted, Andy reached out his hand, got a rope from  somebody--he did not know who, though, as a matter of fact, it was  Pink who gave it--and snared a front foot; presently the brown was  standing upon three legs instead of four, and the gaping populace  wondered how it was done, and craned necks to see. After that, though  the horse still circled backwards, Andy got the stirrup and put his  toe in it and went up so easily that the ignorant might think anybody  could do it. He dropped the rope and saw that it was Pink who picked  it up.    The brown at first did nothing at all. Then he gave a spring straight  ahead and ran fifty yards or so, stopped and began to pitch. Three  jumps and he ran again; stopped and reared. It was very pretty to look  at, but Happy Jack could have ridden him, or Slim, or any other range  rider. In two minutes the brown was sulking, and it took severe  spurring to bring him back to the corral. Pitch he would not. The  crowd applauded, but Andy felt cheated and looked as he felt.    Pink edged toward him, but Andy was not in the mood for reconciliation  and kept out of his way. Others of the Happy Family came near, at  divers times and places, as if they would have speech with him, but he  thought he knew about what they would say, and so was careful not to  give them a chance. When the excitement was all over for that day he  got his despised hired horse and went back to town with Billy Roberts,  because it was good to have a friend and because they wanted to talk  about the riding. Billy did not tell Andy, either, that he had had  hard work getting away from his own crowd; for Billy was kind-hearted  and had heard a good deal, because he had been talking with Happy  Jack. His sympathy was not with the Happy Family, either.    On the second afternoon, such is effect of rigid winnowing, there were  but nine men to ride. The fellow who had grabbed the saddle horn,  together with ten others, stood among the spectators and made caustic  remarks about the management, the horses, the nine who were left and  the whole business in general. Andy grinned a"]]]
