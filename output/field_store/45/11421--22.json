Mr. Travilla moved away to speak to the doctor, and Lottie seized the  opportunity to whisper to her friend, \"He's just splendid, Elsie! I don't  wonder you look so happy, or that he secured your hand and heart after  they had been refused to dukes and lords. You see Aunt Wealthy has been  telling me all about your conquests in Europe,\" she added, in answer to  Elsie's look of surprise.    \"I am, indeed, very happy, Lottie,\" Elsie replied in the same low tone; \"I  know Mr. Travilla so thoroughly, and have not more perfect confidence in  papa's goodness and love to me, than in his. It is a very restful thing to  have such a friend.\"    Dr. King's circumstances had greatly improved in the last four years, so  that he was quite able to give Lottie the pleasure of accepting Elsie's  invitation, and at once gave his cordial consent. Mrs. King at first  objected that the two weeks of our friends' intended stay in Lansdale  would not give sufficient time for the necessary additions to Lottie's  wardrobe; but this difficulty was overcome by a suggestion from Elsie. She  would spend two or three weeks in Philadelphia, attending to the  purchasing and making up of her trousseau, she said, and Lottie's dresses  could be bought and made at the same time and place.    The two weeks allotted to Lansdale of course passed very rapidly;  especially to Harry, to whom the society of these new-found relatives was  a great pleasure, and who on their departure would be left behind, with  only Phillis for his housekeeper.    The latter received so many charges from Aunt Wealthy in regard to careful  attention to \"Mr. Harry's\" health and comfort, that at length she grew  indignant, and protested that she loved \"Mr. Harry as if he was her own  child--didn't she nuss him when he was a little feller? and there was no  'casion for missus to worry an' fret as if she was leavin' him to a  stranger.\"    It was not for want of a cordial invitation to both the Oaks and Ion that  Harry was left behind; but business required his presence at home, and he  could only promise himself a week's holiday at the time of the wedding.          CHAPTER TWELFTH        \"Bring flowers, fresh flowers for the bride to wear;       They were born to blush in her shining hair;       She's leaving the home of her childhood's mirth;       She hath bid farewell to her father's hearth;       Her place is now by another's side;       Bring flowers for the locks of the fair young bride.\"                                            --MRS. HEMANS.      A fair October day is waning, and as the shadows deepen and the stars  shine out here and there in the darkening sky, the grounds at the Oaks  glitter with colored lamps, swinging from the branches of the trees that  shade the long green alleys, and dependent from arches wreathed with  flowers. In doors and out everything wears a festive look; almost the  whole house is thrown open to the guests who will presently come thronging  to it from nearly every plantation for miles around.    The grand wedding has been talked of, prepared for, and looked forward to  for months past, and few, if any, favored with an invitation, will  willingly stay away.    The spacious entrance hall is brilliantly lighted, and on either hand  wide-open doors give admission to long suites of richly, tastefully  furnished rooms, beautiful with rare statuary, paintings, articles of  vertu, and flowers scattered everywhere, in bouquets, wreaths, festoons,  filling the air with their delicious fragrance.    These apartments, waiting for the guests, are almost entirely deserted;  but in Elsie's dressing-room a bevy of gay young girls, in white tarletan  and with flowers in their elaborately dressed hair, are laughing and  chatting merrily, and now and then offering a suggestion to Aunt Chloe and  Dinah, whose busy hands are arranging their young mistress for her bridal.    \"Lovely!\" \"Charming!\" \"Perfect!\" the girls exclaim in delighted, admiring  chorus, as the tirewomen having completed their labors, Elsie stands  before them in a dress of the richest white satin, with an overskirt of  point lace, a veil of the same, enveloping her slender figure like an airy  cloud, or morning mist, reaching from the freshly gathered orange blossoms  wreathed in the shining hair to the tiny white satin slipper just peeping  from beneath the rich folds of the dress. Flowers are her only ornament  to-night, and truly she needs no other.    \"Perfect! nothing superfluous, nothing wanting,\" says Lottie King.    Rose, looking almost like a young girl herself, so sweet and fair in her  beautiful evening dress, came in at that instant to see if all was right  in the bride's attire. Her eyes grew misty while she gazed, her heart  swelling with a strange mixture of emotions: love, joy, pride, and a touch  of sadness at the thought of the partial loss that night was to bring to  her beloved husband and herself.    \"Am I all right, mamma?\" asked Elsie.    \"I can see nothing amiss,\" Rose answered, with a slight tremble in her  voice. \"My darling, I never saw you so wondrously sweet and fair,\" she  whispered, adjusting a fold of the drapery. \"You are very happy?\"    \"Very, mamma dear; yet a trifle sad too. But that is a secret between you  and me. How beautiful you are to-night.\"    \"Ah, dear child, quite ready, and the loveliest bride that ever I saw,  from the sole of your head to the crown of your foot,\" said a silvery  voice, as a quaint little figure came softly in and stood at Mrs.  Dinsmore's side--\"no, I mean from the crown of your foot to the sole of  your head. Ah, funerals are almost as sad as weddings. I don't know how  people can ever feel like dancing at them.\"    \"Well, auntie dear, there'll be no dancing at mine,\" said Elsie, smiling  slightly.    \"I must go and be ready to receive our guests,\" said Rose, hearing the  rumble of carriage wheels. \"Elsie, dear child,\" she whispered, \"keep calm.  You can have no doubts or fears in putting your future in----\"    \"No, no, mamma, not the slightest,\" and the fair face grew radiant.    As Rose passed out at one door, Miss Stanhope following, with a parting  injunction to the bride not to grow frightened or nervous, Mr. Dinsmore  entered by another.    He stood a moment silently gazing upon his lovely daughter; then a slight  motion of his hand sent all others from the room, the bridesmaids passing  into the boudoir, where the groom and his attendants were already  assembled, the tirewomen vanishing by a door on the opposite side.    \"My darling!\" murmured the father, in low, half tremulous accents, putting  his arm about the slender waist, \"my beautiful darling! how can I give you  to another?\" and again and again his lips were pressed to hers in long,  passionate kisses.    \"Papa, please don't make me cry,\" she pleaded, the soft eyes lifted to  his, filled almost to overflowing.    \"No, no, I must not,\" he said, hastily taking out his handkerchief and  wiping away the tears before they fell. \"It is shamefully selfish in me to  come and disturb your mind thus just now.\"    \"No, papa, no, no; I will not have you say that. Thank you for coming. It  would have hurt me had you stayed away. But you would not have things  different now if you could? have no desire to.\"    \"No, daughter, no; yet, unreasonable as it is, the thought will come,  bringing sadness with it, that to-night you resign my name, and my house  ceases to be your only home.\"    \"Papa, I shall never resign the name dear to me because inherited from  you: I shall only add to it; your house shall always be one of my dear  homes, and I shall be your own, own daughter, your own child, as truly as  I ever have been. Is it not so?\"    \"Yes, yes, my precious little comforter.\"    \"And you are not going to give me away--ah, papa, I could never bear that  any more than you; you are taking a partner in the concern,\" she added  with playful tenderness, smiling archly through gathering tears.    Again he wiped them hastily away. \"Did ever father have such a dear  daughter?\" he said, gazing fondly down into the sweet face. \"I ought to be  the happiest of men. I believe I am----\"    \"Except one,\" exclaimed a joyous voice, at sound of which Elsie's eyes  brightened and the color deepened on her cheek. \"May I come in?\"    \"Yes, Travilla,\" said Mr. Dinsmore; \"you have now an equal right with me.\"    Travilla thought his was superior, or would be after the ceremony, but  generously refrained from saying so. And had Mr. Dinsmore been questioned  on the subject, he could not have asserted that it had ever occurred to  him that Mr. Allison had an equal right with himself in Rose. But few  people are entirely consistent.    Mr. Travilla drew near the two, still standing together, and regarded his  bride with a countenance beaming with love and delight. The sweet eyes  sought his questioningly, and meeting his ardent gaze the beautiful face  sparkled all over with smiles and blushes.    \"Does my toilet please you, my friend?\" she asked. \"And you, papa?\"    \"The general effect is charming,\" said Mr. Travilla; \"but,\" he added, in  low, tender tones saying far more than the words, \"I've been able to see  nothing else for the dear face that is always that to me.\"    \"I can see no flaw in face or attire,\" Mr. Dinsmore said, taking a more  critical survey; \"you are altogether pleasing in your doting father's  eyes, my darling. But you must not stand any longer. You will need all  your strength for your journey.\" And he would have led her to a sofa.    But she gently declined. \"Ah, I am much too fine to sit down just now, my  dear, kind father, I should crush my lace badly. So please let me stand. I  am not conscious of weariness.\"    He yielded, saying with a smile, \"That would be a pity; for it is very  beautiful. And surely you ought to be allowed your own way to-night if  ever.\"    \"To-night and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14875"],[0,"Elsie's children (#18)"],[1,"'don't fret; don't meet trouble half way, but trust in God, our  Father, who loves us so dearly, that he will never let any real harm come  to us.'\"    \"I think our mamma is very wise,\" remarked Eddie; \"so very much wiser than  Aunt Lucy, who gets frightened at every little thing.\"    \"Oh, Eddie dear, would mamma or papa like that?\" said Elsie softly.    \"Well, it's true,\" he said reddening.    But they've both told us that unkind remarks should not be made even if  true: unless it is quite necessary.\"    \"Oh, why don't papa and mamma come?\" \"Oh, I wis dey would! I so tired  watchin' for 'em!\" burst out Harold and Herbert, nearly ready to cry.    \"Look! look!\" cried the others in chorus, \"they are coming, the carriage  is just turning in at the gate!\"    But it was growing so dark now, and the tiny flakes were coming down so  thick and fast, that none of them were quite sure the carriage was their  own, until it drew up before the door, and two dear familiar forms  alighted and came up the veranda steps.    They were greeted with as joyous a welcome as if they had been absent for  weeks or months, and returned the sweet caresses as lovingly as they were  bestowed, smiling tenderly upon each darling of their hearts.    But almost instantly little Elsie perceived something unusual in the  sweet, fair face she loved so dearly, and was wont to study with such  fond, tender scrutiny.    \"Mamma, dear mamma, what is wrong?\" she asked.    \"A sad accident, daughter,\" Elsie answered, her voice faltering with  emotion, \"poor grandpa and Aunt Enna have been badly hurt.\"    \"Our dear grandpa, mamma?\" they all asked, lips and voices tremulous with  grief.    \"No, darlings, not my own dear father,\" the mother answered, with a heart  full of gratitude that it was not he, \"but our poor old grandfather who  lives at Roselands.\"    \"My dear little wife, you are too much overcome to talk any more just  now,\" Mr. Travilla said, wheeling an easy-chair to the fire, seating her  in it, and removing her hat and cloak, with all the tender gallantry of  the days when he wooed and won his bride; \"let me tell it.\" He took a seat  near her side, lifted \"bit Herbie\" to his knee, and with the others  gathered close about him, briefly told how the accident had happened, and  that he and their mother had met a messenger coming to acquaint them with  the disaster, and summon them to Roselands; then gave the children some  idea of the present situation of their injured relations.    When he had finished, and his young hearers had expressed their sorrow and  sympathy for the sufferers, a moment of silence ensued, broken by little  Elsie.    \"Mamma, who will take care of them?\"    \"God,\" said Herbert, \"won't he, papa?\"    \"But I mean who will nurse them while they are sick,\" said Elsie.    \"My father will take care of grandpa,\" Mrs. Travilla answered, \"Uncle  Horace and papa helping when needed.\"    \"And Aunt Enna, mamma?\"    \"Well, daughter, who do you think should nurse her? Aunt Louise is away,  Aunt Lora sick herself, grandma at Ashlands with Aunt Sophie and her sick  children.\"    \"Oh, mamma, it won't have to be you, will it?\" the child asked almost  imploringly.    \"Oh, mamma, no; how could we do without you?\" chimed in the others,  Herbert adding tearfully, \"Mamma stay wis us; we tan't do wisout you.\"    They left their father to cluster about and cling to her, with caresses  and entreaties.    \"My darlings,\" she said, returning their endearments, \"can you not feel  willing to spare your mother for a little while to poor, suffering Aunt  Enna?\"    \"Mamma, they have plenty of servants\"    \"Yes, Vi, but she is so very ill that we cannot hope she will get well  without more careful, tender nursing than any servant would give her.\"    \"Mamma, it will be very hard to do without you.\"    \"And very hard for me to stay away from my dear children; but what does  the Bible say? Seek your own pleasure and profit, and let others take  care of themselves?\"    \"Oh, mamma, no! 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.'\"    \"'Do good to them that hate you,'\" quoted Eddie in an undertone.    \"But we were not speaking of enemies, my son,\" his mother said in  surprise.    \"I think Aunt Enna is your enemy, mamma; I think she hates you,\" he said,  with flashing eyes, \"for I've many a time heard her say very hateful  things to you. Mamma, don't look so sorry at me; how can I help being  angry at people that say unkind things to you?\"    \"'Forgive, and you shall be forgiven,'\" she said gently. \"'Do good and  lend.' Can't you lend your mother for a few weeks, dears?\"    \"Weeks, mamma! oh, so long!\" they cried. \"How can we? who will take care  of us, and hear our lessons and teach us to be good?\"    \"Dinah will wash and dress you, Elsie help you little ones to learn your  lessons, and I think papa,\" looking at him, \"will hear you recite.\"    \"Yes,\" he said, smiling on them, \"we will do our best, so that dear mamma  may not be anxious and troubled about us in addition to all the care and  anxiety for the suffering ones at Roselands.\"    \"Yes, papa,\" they answered, returning his smile half tearfully; then  questioned their mother as to when she must go, and whether they should  see her at all while Aunt Enna was sick.    \"I can wait only long enough to take supper with you, and have our talk  together afterward,\" she said, \"because I am needed at Roselands. Perhaps  papa will bring you there sometimes to see me for a little while if you  will be very quiet. And it may be only for a few days that I shall be  wanted there; we cannot tell about that yet.\"    She spoke cheerfully, but it cost her an effort because of the grieved,  troubled looks on the dear little faces.    \"But baby, mamma!\" cried Vi, \"baby can't do without you!\"    \"No, dear, she and mammy will have to go with me.\"    They were not the usual merry party at the tea-table, and a good many  tears were shed during the talk with mamma afterward.    They all consented to her going, but the parting with her, and the thought  of doing without her for \"so long\" were the greatest trials they had ever  known.    She saw all the younger ones in bed, kissed each one good-night, and  reminding them that their heavenly Father was always with them, and that  she would not be too far away to come at once to them if needed, she left  them to their sleep.    Elsie followed her mother to her dressing-room, watched for every  opportunity to assist in her preparations for her absence. They were not  many, and with some parting injunctions to this little daughter and the  servants, she announced herself ready to go.    Elsie clung to her with tears at the last, as they stood together in the  lower hall waiting for the others.    \"Mamma, what shall I do without you? I've never been away from you a whole  day in all my life.\"    \"No, dearest, but be my brave, helpful little girl. You must try to fill  mother's place to the little ones. I shall not be far away, you know, and  your dear father will be here nearly all the time. And don't forget,  darling, that your best Friend is always with you.\"    \"No, mamma,\" said the child, smiling through her tears; \"it is so sweet to  know that; and please don't trouble about us at home. I'll do my best for  papa and the children.\"    \"That is right, daughter, you are a very great comfort to me now and  always,\" the mother said, with a last caress, as her husband joined her  and gave her his arm to lead her to the carriage.    \"Don't come out in the cold, daughter,\" he said, seeing the child about to  follow.    Mammy had just come down with the sleeping babe in her arms, warmly  wrapped up to shield her from the cold.    Elsie sprang to her side, lifted the veil that covered the little face,  and softly touched her lips to the delicate cheek. \"Good-bye, baby  darling. Oh, mammy, we'll miss her sadly and you too.\"    \"Don't fret, honey, 'spect we all be comin' back soon,\" Aunt Chloe  whispered, readjusting the veil, and hurrying after her mistress.    Elsie flew to the window, and watched the carriage roll away down the  avenue, till lost to sight in the darkness, tears trembling in her eyes,  but a thrill of joy mingling with her grief: \"it was so sweet to be a  comfort and help to dear mamma.\"    She set herself to considering how she might be the same to her father and  brothers and sister; what she could do now.    She remembered that her father was very fond of music and that her mother  often played and sang for him in the evenings. He had said he would  probably return in an hour, and going to the piano she spent the  intervening time in the diligent practice of a new piece of music he had  brought her a day or two before.    At sound of the carriage wheels she ran to meet him, her face bright with  welcoming smiles.    \"My little sunbeam,\" he said taking her in his arms; \"you have been  nothing but a comfort and blessing to your mother and me, since the day  you were born.\"    \"Dear papa, how kind in you to tell me that!\" she said, her cheek flushing  and her eyes glistening with pleasure.    He kept her with him till after her usual hour for retiring, listening to,  and praising her music and talking with her quite as if she were fit to be  a companion for him.    Both the injured ones were very ill for some weeks, but by means of  competent medical advice and careful nursing, their lives were saved; yet  neither recovered entirely from the effects of the accident. Mr. Dinsmore  was feeble and ailing, and walked with a limp for the rest of his days,  and Enna, though her bodily health was quite restored, rose from her bed  with an impaired intellect, her memory gone, her reasoning powers scarcely  equal to those of an ordinary child of five or six.    She did not recognize her children, or indeed any one; she had everything  to relearn and went back to childish amusements, dolls, baby-houses and  other toys.    The sight was inexpressibly painful to Dick and Molly, far worse"]]]
