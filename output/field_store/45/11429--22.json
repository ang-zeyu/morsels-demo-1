Coffee was also administered by a ready method which, as a systematic  procedure, was, I believe, novel when I introduced it to the  profession in the _Medical Record,_ in 1876. I take the liberty of  referring to this, since I think it is now sometimes overlooked. It  was described as follows:        \"A simple examination which any one can make of his own buccal      cavity will show that posterior to the last molar teeth, when      the jaws are closed, is an opening bounded by the molars, the      body of the superior, and the ramus of the inferior maxilla. If      on either side the cheek is held well out from the jaw, a      pocket, or gutter, is formed, into which fluids may be poured,      and they will pass into the mouth through the opening behind the      molars, as well as through the interstices between the teeth.      When in the mouth they tend to create a disposition to swallow,      and by this method a considerable quantity of liquid may be      administered.\"    After I had worked with the patient in the open air, for four and  three-quarter hours, he was carried to a cottage near by and placed,  still unconscious, in bed. There had been an alvine evacuation during  the time in which he lay in the blankets.    Consciousness began to return in the early part of the following  morning, and with its advent it was discovered that the memory of  everything which had occurred from half an hour previous to the  accident, up to the return of consciousness, had been completely  obliterated. With this exception the convalescence was steady and  uncomplicated, and of about a week's duration. From a letter which I  recently received from my patient, I learned that the lapse of memory  still remains.    My experience with this case has taught me that, unless the data have  been taken very accurately, we cannot depend upon any statements as to  the time of submersion in cases of drowning. My first supposition was  that my patient had been from thirteen to fifteen minutes under water,  but a careful investigation reduced the supposed time by one-half.  This makes the time of submersion about six minutes, and that which  elapsed before the intelligent use of remedies about three minutes  longer.    For a long time the opinion of Sir Benjamin Brodie concerning the  presence of water in the lungs of the drowned was accepted, who says  \"that the admission of water into the lungs is prevented by a spasm of  the muscles of the glottis cannot, however, be doubted, since we are  unable to account for it in any other manner.\"    Later experiments made by a committee of the Royal Medico-Chirurgical  Society, of London, demonstrated, on the contrary, that \"in drowned  animals not only were all the air passages choked with frothy fluid,  more or less bloody, but that both lungs were highly gorged with  blood, so that they were heavy, dark colored, and pitted on pressure,  and on being cut exuded an abundance of blood-tinged fluid with many  air bubbles in it.\" Dr. R.L. Bowles[1] also holds that the lungs of  the drowned contain water, and supports his views by a list of cases.  In his words, \"These examples show very conclusively that in cases of  drowning in man, water does exist in the lungs, that the water only  very gradually and after a long time is effectually expelled, and that  it is absolutely impossible that any relief should be afforded in that  way by the Silvester method.\" Dr. Bowles believes that the method of  Dr. Marshall Hall is superior to any other in this class of cases. He  thinks that on account of the immediate adoption and continued use of  the prono-lateral position, this method is more to be trusted than any  other for keeping the pharynx clear of obstruction. \"It also empties  the stomach and gradually clears the lungs of the watery and frothy  fluids, and will surely and gently introduce sufficient air at each  inspiration to take the place of the fluid which has been expelled.\"  In the light of even my limited experience I cannot but feel that Dr.  Bowles' opinion concerning the Silvester method would admit of some  modification. This is often the case with very positive statements  concerning medical matters. In my own case the Silvester method  answered well, but I was much impressed with Dr. Bowles' claims for  the Marshall Hall method, and should bear them in mind were I called  upon to attend another case of drowning.       [Footnote 1: Resuscitation of the Apparently Drowned, by R.L.     Bowles, M.D., F.R.C.P., Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol.     lxxii., 1889.]    I think it must be admitted that pulling the tongue forward as a means  of opening the glottis, which has become a standard treatment in  asphyxia, is unscientific, and not warranted by the results of  experiments made to determine its value.[2]       [Footnote 2: Dragging on the tongue's tip would not affect its     base or the epiglottis sufficiently to make it a praiseworthy     procedure. Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. lxxii. See also     _Medical Record_, April 4, 1891. Pulling out the tongue is a     mistake, since irritation of nerves of deglutition stops the     diaphragm.--_Medical Times and Gazetteer._]    Dr. Bowles also believes that \"the safety of the patient is most  perfectly secured by keeping him on one side during the whole  treatment, one lung being thus kept quite free.\" With the account of  my case I have brought forward such views of other writers as it  seemed to me would be of practical service and throw light on a  subject which is of great importance, since the yearly record of  mortality from drowning is by no means inconsiderable. I think,  however, that a knowledge of what ought to be done in cases of  drowning should be much more generally diffused than is the case at  present. It should be one of the items of school instruction, since no  one can tell when such knowledge may be of immense importance in  saving life, and the time lost in securing medical aid would involve a  fatal result.    It is also very desirable that all doubt should be removed, by the  decision of competent medical authorities, as to which \"ready\" method  or methods are the best, since there are several in the field. With  this should be decided what is the best means for securing patency of  the air passages, and, in short, a very careful revision of the  treatment now recommended for drowning, in order that there may be no  doubt as to the course which should be adopted in such a serious  emergency.--_Medical Record._           *       *       *       *       *          THE STORY OF THE UNIVERSE.[1]    [Footnote 1: Presidential address before the British Association,  Cardiff, 1891.]    By Dr. WILLIAM HUGGINS.      The opening meeting of the British Association was held in Park Hall,  Cardiff, August 18, where a large and brilliant audience assembled,  including, in his richly trimmed official robes, the Marquis of Bute,  who this year holds office as mayor of Cardiff. At the commencement of  the proceedings Sir Frederick Abel took the chair, but this was only  _pro forma_, and in order that he might, after a few complimentary  sentences, resign it to the president-elect, Professor Huggins, the  eminent astronomer, who at once, amid applause, assumed the presidency  and proceeded to deliver the opening address.    Dr. Huggins said that the very remarkable discoveries in our knowledge  of the heavens which had taken place during the past thirty years--a  period of amazing and ever-increasing activity in all branches of  science--had not passed unnoticed in the addresses of successive  presidents; still, it seemed to him fitting that he should speak of  those newer methods of astronomical research which had led to those  discoveries, and which had become possible by the introduction into  the observatory, since 1860, of the spectroscope and the modern  photographic plate. Spectroscopic astronomy had become a distinct and  acknowledged branch of the science, possessing a large literature of  its own, and observatories specially devoted to it. The more recent  discovery of the gelatine dry plate had given a further great impetus  to this modern side of astronomy, and had opened a pathway into the  unknown of which even an enthusiast thirty years ago would scarcely  have dared to dream.      HERSCHEL'S THEORY.    It was now some thirty years since the spectroscope gave us for the  first time certain knowledge of the nature of the heavenly bodies, and  revealed the fundamental fact that terrestrial matter is not peculiar  to the solar system, but is common to all the stars which are visible  to us. Professor Rowland had since shown us that if the whole earth  were heated to the temperature of the sun, its spectrum would resemble  very closely the solar spectrum. In the nebulae, the elder Herschel saw  portions of the fiery mist or \"shining fluid,\" out of which the  heavens and the earth had been slowly fashioned. For a time this view  of the nebulae gave place to that which regarded them as external  galaxies--cosmical \"sand heaps,\" too remote to be resolved into  separate stars, though, indeed, in 1858, Mr. Herbert Spencer showed  that the observations of nebulae up to that time were really in favor  of an evolutional progress. In 1864 he (the speaker) brought the  spectroscope to bear upon them; the bright lines which flashed upon  the eye showed the source of the light to be glowing gas, and so  restored these bodies to what is probably their true place, as an  early stage of sidereal life. At that early time our knowledge of  stellar spectra was small. For this reason partly, and probably also  under the undue influence of theological opinions then widely  prevalent, he unwisely wrote in his original paper in 1864, that \"in  these objects we no longer have to do with a special modification of  our own type of sun, but find ourselves in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14992"],[0,"The Life of Froude (#18)"],[1,"4, 155 on the  disputes relating to the succession to the English Crown, and the  respective claims of the Queen of Scots, Lady Catherine Grey, Lord  Darnley, and Laqy Margaret Lennox. I noted the volumes only. I did  not take notice of the pages because as far as I could see the  volumes appeared to be given up to special subjects, and I should  wish therefore to read them through.\"    His growing admiration for Cecil appears in the following extracts:    \"I could only do real justice to such a collection by being allowed  to read through the whole of it volume by volume--and for such a  large permission as that I fear it may be dangerous to ask. Lord  Salisbury, however, whatever my faults may be, could find no one who  has a more genuine admiration for his ancestor.\"    October 16th, 1864.--\"I cannot say beforehand the papers which I wish  to examine, as I cannot tell what the collection may contain. My  object is to have everything which admits of being learnt about the  period--especially what may throw light on Lord Burleigh's  character. He, it is more and more clear to me, was the solitary  author of Elizabeth's and England's greatness.\"    \"I shall return from Simancas,\" he writes from Valladolid, \"more a  Cecil maniac than ever. In the Duke of Norfolk's conspiracy, the  Queen seems to have fairly given up the reins to him. It is  impossible to read the correspondence between Philip, Alva, the  Pope, the Duke of Norfolk, and the Queen of Scots, the deliberate  arrangements for Elizabeth's murder, without shivering to think how  near a chance it was. Cecil was the one only man they feared, and  the skill with which he dug mines below theirs, and pulled the  strings of the whole of Europe against them, was truly splendid.  Elizabeth had lost her head with it all, but she knew it and did not  interfere. There are a great many letters of the Queen of Scots at  Simancas, some of them of the deepest interest. She remains the same  as I have always thought her--brilliant, cruel, ruthless, and  perfectly unfeeling.\"    Although Froude's admiration for Elizabeth steadily diminished with  the progress of his researches, even students of his History will be  surprised by such a verdict as this:    \"I am slowly drawing to the end of my long journey through the  Records. By far the largest part of Burghley's papers is here [in  the Record Office], and not at Hatfield. The private letters which  passed between him and Walsingham about Elizabeth have destroyed  finally the prejudice that still clung to me that, notwithstanding  her many faults, she was a woman of ability. Evidently in their  opinion she had no ability at all worth calling by the name.\"    Two or three extracts will complete the part of this correspondence  which deals with the composition of the History. \"I have been  incessantly busy in the Record Office since my return to London. The  more completely I examine the MSS. elsewhere the better use I shall  be able to make of yours. I have still two months of this kind  before me, and my intention, if you did not yourself write to me  first, was to ask you to let me go to Hatfield for a week or two  about Easter.\"    \"I am now sufficiently master of the story to be able to make very  good (I daresay complete) use of the Hatfield papers in my present  condition. I feel as if there were very few dark places left in  Queen Elizabeth's proceedings anywhere. I substantially end, in a  blaze of fireworks, with the Armada. The concentrated interest of  the reign lies in the period now under my hands. It is all action,  and I shall use my materials badly if I cannot make it as  interesting as a novel.\"    Nothing was neglected by Froude which could throw light upon the  splendid and illustrious Queen who raised England from the depths of  degradation to the height of renown. It was at the zenith of  Elizabeth's career that Froude stopped. His original intention had  been to continue till her death. But the ample scale on which he had  planned his book was so much enlarged by his copious quotations from  the manuscripts at Simancas that by the time he reached his eleventh  volume he substituted for the death of Elizabeth on his title-page  the defeat of the Armada. With the year 1588, then, he closed his  labours. Even the perverse critics who had assumed to treat the  History of Henry VIII. as an anti-ecclesiastical pamphlet were  compelled to show more respect for volumes which gave so much novel  information to the world. Moreover Henry's daughter was a very  different person from her father. Scandal about Queen Elizabeth had  been chiefly confined to Roman Catholics, and few Englishmen had  forgotten who made England the mistress of the seas. The old  religion had a strong fascination for her, and every one knows how  she interrupted Dean Nowell when he preached against images. She  declined to be the head of the Church in the sense arrogated by  Henry, and yet she would by no means admit the supremacy of the  Pope. If she ever felt any inclination towards Rome, the massacre of  St. Bartholomew checked it for ever. Gregory XIII. and Catherine de Medici  were rulers to her taste. On the other hand she resisted the persecuting  tendencies of her Bishops, and spared the life even of such a wretch as  Bonner. It is possible that she believed in transubstantiation. It  is certain that she objected to the marriage of the clergy, and  showed scant courtesy to the wife of her own favourite Archbishop  Parker. Nor would she suffer the Bishops, except as Peers, to meddle  in affairs of State. A magnificent princess, every inch a queen, she  could not forget that the English people had saved her life from the  clutches of her sister, and it was for them, not for any Minister,  courtier, or lover, that she really cared.    Froude was no idolater of Elizabeth, and he became more unfavourable  to her as he proceeded. He dwells minutely upon all her intrigues,  in which she was as petty as in great matters she was grand. For her  rival, Mary Stuart, he had neither respect nor mercy. To her  intellect indeed, which was quite on a par with Elizabeth's, he does  full justice. But neither her beauty nor her wit, neither her  scholarship nor her statesmanship, neither her passion nor her  courage, could blind him to her selfishness, her immorality, and the  fact that she represented the Catholic cause. His account of her  execution certainly lacks sentiment, and Mrs. Norton accused him of  writing like a disappointed lover. His sympathies are with John  Knox, and the Regent Murray, and Maitland of Lethington. But the man  who believes that Mary was not concerned in the murder of her  husband will believe anything, even that she did not reward the  murderer of her brother, or that she would have spared Elizabeth if  Elizabeth had been in her power. And at least Froude does not, like  some more modern writers, degrade her to the level of a kitchen  wench. Froude's Elizabeth was the subject of bitter, hostile,  sometimes violent, criticism in The Saturday Review, the property of  an ardent High Churchman, Beresford Hope. In the next chapter I  shall deal with these articles at more length. It is enough to say  here that they were directed not merely at Froude's accuracy as an  historian, but at his truthfulness as a man, suggesting that the  mode in which he had manipulated authorities accessible to every one  threw grave doubts upon his version of what he read at Simancas.  Froude knew very well that he should make enemies. His belief that  history had been cericalised, and required to be laicised, was  regarded as peculiarly offensive in one who had been himself  ordained.    Mary Stuart, moreover, had stalwart champions beyond the border who  were neither clerical nor ecclesiastical. \"I fear,\" Froude wrote on  the 22nd of May, 1862, to his Scottish friend Skelton, who was  himself much interested in the subject--\"I fear my book will bring  all your people about my ears. Mary Stuart, from my point of view,  was something between Rachel and a pantheress.\"    The success of the History had been long since assured, and each  successive pair of volumes met with a cordial welcome. Many people  disagreed with Froude on many points. He expected disagreement, and  did not mind it. But no one could fail to see the evidence of  patient,  thorough research which every chapter, almost every page,  contains. Indeed, it might be said with justice, or at least with  some plausibility, that the long and frequent extracts from the  despatches of De Feria, de Quadra, de Silva, and Don Guereau,  successively Ambassadors from Philip to Elizabeth, water-log the  book, and make it too like a series of extracts with explanatory  comments. Of Froude's own style there could not be two opinions. His  bitterest antagonists were forced to admit that it was the  perfection of easy, graceful narrative, without the majestic  splendour of Gibbon, but also without the mechanical hardness of  Macaulay. Froude did not stop deliberately, as other historians have  stopped, to paint pictures or draw portraits, and there are few  writers from whom it is more difficult to make typical or  characteristic extracts. Yet, as I have already quoted from his  account of Cranmer's execution, it may not be inappropriate that I  should cite some of the thoughts suggested to him by the death of  Knox. Morton's epitaph is well known.    \"There lies one,\" said the Earl over the coffin, \"who never feared  the face of mortal man.\" \"Morton,\" says Froude, \"spoke only of what  he knew; the full measure of Knox's greatness neither he nor any man  could then estimate. It is as we look back over that stormy time,  and weigh the actors in it one against the other, that he stands out  in his full proportions. No grander figure can be found, in the  entire history of the Reformation in this island, than that of Knox.  Cromwell and Burghley rank beside him for the work which they  effected,"]]]
