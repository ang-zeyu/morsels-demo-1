But it was short, too, 'cause as soon as I did get on  the other side the big-eyed, brown-skin girl would be gone. Well, pretty  soon I saw a tall light and I remembered what the old lady had told me  about looking for that light and rowing to it. I did; and when I got up  to it, two men reached down and grabbed her; I started tremblin' all  over again, and prayin'. Then, one of the men took my arm and I just  felt down inside of me that the Lord had got ready for me. 'You hungry,  Boy?' is what he asked me, and if he hadn't been holdin' me I think I  would have fell backward into the river.\"    \"That was my first trip; it took me a long time to get over my scared  feelin', but I finally did, and I soon found myself goin' back across  the river, with two and three people, and sometimes a whole boatload. I  got so I used to make three and four trips a month.    \"What did my passengers look like? I can't tell you any more about it  than you can, and you wasn't there. After that first girl--no, I never  did see her again--I never saw my passengers. I would have to be the  \"black nights\" of the moon when I would carry them, and I would meet 'em  out in the open or in a house without a single light. The only way I  knew who they were was to ask them; \"What you say?\" And they would  answer, \"Menare.\" I don't know what that word meant--it came from the  Bible. I only know that that was the password I used, and all of them  that I took over told it to me before I took them.    \"I guess you wonder what I did with them after I got them over the  river. Well, there in Ripley was a man named Mr. Rankins; I think the  rest of his name was John. He had a regular station there on his place  for escaping slaves. You see, Ohio was a free state and once they got  over the river from Kentucky or Virginia. Mr. Rankins could strut them  all around town, and nobody would bother 'em. The only reason we used to  land quietly at night was so that whoever brought 'em could go back for  more, and because we had to be careful that none of the owners had  followed us. Every once in a while they would follow a boat and catch  their slaves back. Sometimes they would shoot at whoever was trying to  save the poor devils.    \"Mr. Rankins had a regular 'station' for the slaves. He had a big  lighthouse in his yard, about thirty feet high and he kept it burnin'  all night. It always meant freedom for slave if he could get to this  light.    \"Sometimes Mr. Rankins would have twenty or thirty slaves that had run  away on his place at the time. It must have cost him a whole lots to  keep them and feed 'em, but I think some of his friends helped him.    \"Those who wanted to stay around that part of Ohio could stay, but  didn't many of 'em do it, because there was too much danger that you  would be walking along free one night, feel a hand over your mouth, and  be back across the river and in slavery again in the morning. And nobody  in the world ever got a chance to know as much misery as a slave that  had escaped and been caught.    \"So a whole lot of 'em went on North to other parts of Ohio, or to New  York, Chicago or Canada; Canada was popular then because all of the  slaves thought it was the last gate before you got all the way _inside_  of heaven. I don't think there was much chance for a slave to make a  living in Canada, but didn't many of 'em come back. They seem like they  rather starve up there in the cold than to be back in slavery.    \"The Army soon started taking a lot of 'em, too. They could enlist in  the Union Army and get good wages, more food than they ever had, and  have all the little gals wavin' at 'em when they passed. Them blue  uniforms was a nice change, too.    \"No, I never got anything from a single one of the people I carried over  the river to freedom. I didn't want anything; after had made a few trips  I got to like it, and even though I could have been free any night  myself, I figgered I wasn't getting along so bad so I would stay on Mr.  Tabb's place and help the others get free. I did it for four years.    \"I don't know to this day how he never knew what I was doing; I used to  take some awful chances, and he knew I must have been up to something; I  wouldn't do much work in the day, would never be in my house at night,  and when he would happen to visit the plantation where I had said I was  goin' I wouldn't be there. Sometimes I think he did know and wanted me  to get the slaves away that way so he wouldn't have to cause hard  feelins' by freein 'em.    \"I think Mr. Tabb used to talk a lot to Mr. John Fee; Mr. Fee was a man  who lived in Kentucky, but Lord! how that man hated slavery! He used to  always tell us (we never let our owners see us listenin' to him, though)  that God didn't intend for some men to be free and some men be in  slavery. He used to talk to the owners, too, when they would listen to  him, but mostly they hated the sight of John Fee.    \"In the night, though, he was a different man, for every slave who came  through his place going across the river he had a good word, something  to eat and some kind of rags, too, if it was cold. He always knew just  what to tell you to do if anything went wrong, and sometimes I think he  kept slaves there on his place 'till they could be rowed across the  river. Helped us a lot.    \"I almost ran the business in the ground after I had been carrying the  slaves across for nearly four years. It was in 1863, and one night I  carried across about twelve on the same night. Somebody must have seen  us, because they set out after me as soon as I stepped out of the boat  back on the Kentucky side; from that time on they were after me.  Sometimes they would almost catch me; I had to run away from Mr. Tabb's  plantation and live in the fields and in the woods. I didn't know what a  bed was from one week to another. I would sleep in a cornfield tonight,  up in the branches of a tree tomorrow night, and buried in a haypile the  next night; the River, where I had carried so many across myself, was no  good to me; it was watched too close.    \"Finally, I saw that I could never do any more good in Mason County, so  I decided to take my freedom, too. I had a wife by this time, and one  night we quietly slipped across and headed for Mr. Rankin's bell and  light. It looked like we had to go almost to China to get across that  river: I could hear the bell and see the light on Mr. Rankin's place,  but the harder I rowed, the farther away it got, and I knew if I didn't  make it I'd get killed. But finally, I pulled up by the lighthouse, and  went on to my freedom--just a few months before all of the slaves got  their's. I didn't stay in Ripley, though; I wasn't taking no chances. I  went on to Detroit and still live there with most of 10 children and 31  grandchildren.    \"The bigger ones don't care so much about hearin' it now, but the little  ones never get tired of hearin' how their grandpa brought Emancipation  to loads of slaves he could touch and feel, but never could see.\"      REFERENCES    1.

Meineoke, E.P.: Forest tree diseases common in California and  Nevada, U.S. Forest Service, Washington, D.C., 1914.    Hartig, R.: The diseases of trees. London and New York, 1894.]    Fungi are responsible for almost all decay of wood. So far as  known, all decay is produced by living organisms, either fungi  or bacteria. Some species attack living trees, sometimes killing  them, or making them hollow, or in the case of pecky cypress and  incense cedar filling the wood with galleries like those of  boring insects. A much larger variety work only in felled or  dead wood, even after it is placed in buildings or manufactured  articles. In any case the process of destruction is the same.  The mycelial threads penetrate the walls of the cells in search  of food, which they find either in the cell contents (starches,  sugars, etc.), or in the cell wall itself. The breaking down of  the cell walls through the chemical action of so-called  \"enzymes\" secreted by the fungi follows, and the eventual  product is a rotten, moist substance crumbling readily under the  slightest pressure. Some species remove the ligneous matter and  leave almost pure cellulose, which is white, like cotton; others  dissolve the cellulose, leaving a brittle, dark brown mass of  ligno-cellulose. Fungi (such as the bluing fungus) which merely  stain wood usually do not affect its mechanical properties  unless the attacks are excessive.    It is evident, then, that the action of rot-causing fungi is to  decrease the strength of wood, rendering it unsound, brittle,  and dangerous to use. The most dangerous kinds are the so-called  \"dry-rot\" fungi which work in many kinds of lumber after it is  placed in the buildings. They are particularly to be dreaded  because unseen, working as they do within the walls or inside of  casings. Several serious wrecks of large buildings have been  attributed to this cause. It is stated[40] that in the three  years (1911-1913) more than $100,000 was required to repair  damage due to dry rot.    [Footnote 40: Dry rot in factory timbers, by Inspection Dept.  Associated Factory Mutual Fire Insurance Cos., 31 Milk Street,  Boston, 1913.]    Dry rot develops best at 75 deg.F. and is said to be killed by a  temperature of 110 deg.F.[41] Fully 70 per cent humidity is  necessary in the air in which a timber is surrounded for the  growth of this fungus, and probably the wood must be quite near  its fibre saturation condition. Nevertheless _Merulius  lacrymans_ (one of the most important species) has been found to  live four years and eight months in a dry condition.[42]  Thorough kiln-drying will kill this fungus, but will not prevent  its redevelopment. Antiseptic treatment, such as creosoting, is  the best prevention.    [Footnote 41: Falck, Richard: Die Meruliusfauele des Bauholzes,  Hausschwammforschungen, 6. Heft., Jena, 1912.]    [Footnote 42: Mez, Carl: Der Hausschwamm. Dresden, 1908, p. 63.]    All fungi require moisture and air[43] for their growth.  Deprived of either of these the fungus dies or ceases to  develop. Just what degree of moisture in wood is necessary for  the \"dry-rot\" fungus has not been determined, but it is  evidently considerably above that of thoroughly air-dry timber,  probably more than 15 per cent moisture. Hence the importance of  free circulation of air about all timbers in a building.    [Footnote 43: A culture of fungus placed in a glass jar and the  air pumped out ceases to grow, but will start again as soon as  oxygen is admitted.]    Warmth is also conducive to the growth of fungi, the most  favorable temperature being about 90 deg.F. They cannot grow in  extreme cold, although no degree of cold such as occurs  naturally will kill them. On the other hand, high temperature  will kill them, but the spores may survive even the boiling  temperature. Mould fungus has been observed to develop rapidly  at 130 deg.F. in a dry kiln in moist air, a condition under which an  animal cannot live more than a few minutes. This fungus was  killed, however, at about 140 deg. or 145 deg.F.[44]    [Footnote 44: Experiments in kiln-drying _Eucalyptus_ in  Berkeley, U.S. Forest Service.]    The fungus (_Endothia parasitica_ And.) which causes the  chestnut blight kills the trees by girdling them and has no  direct effect upon the wood save possibly the four or five  growth rings of the sapwood.[45]    [Footnote 45: See Anderson, Paul J.: The morphology and life  history of the chestnut blight fungus. Bul. No. 7, Penna.  Chestnut Tree Blight Com., Harrisburg, 1914, p. 17.]        PARASITIC PLANT INJURIES.[46]      [Footnote 46: See York, Harlan H.: The anatomy and some of the  biological aspects of the \"American mistletoe.\" Bul. 120, Sci.  Ser. No. 13, Univ. of Texas, Austin, 1909.    Bray, Wm. L.: The mistletoe pest in the Southwest. Bul. 166,  U.S. Bu. Plant Ind., Washington, 1910.    Meinecke, E.P.: Forest tree diseases common in California and  Nevada. U.S. Forest Service, Washington, 1914, pp. 54-58.]    The most common of the higher parasitic plants damaging timber  trees are mistletoes. Many species of deciduous trees are  attacked by the common mistletoe (_Phoradendron flavescens_). It  is very prevalent in the South and Southwest and when present in  sufficient quantity does considerable damage. There is also a  considerable number of smaller mistletoes belonging to the genus  _Razoumofskya (Arceuthobium)_ which are widely distributed  throughout the country, and several of them are common on  coniferous trees in the Rocky Mountains and along the Pacific  coast.    One effect of the common mistletoe is the formation of large  swellings or tumors. Often the entire tree may become stunted or  distorted. The western mistletoe is most common on the branches,  where it produces \"witches' broom.\" It frequently attacks the  trunk as well, and boards cut from such trees are filled with  long, radial holes which seriously damage or destroy the value  of the timber affected.        LOCALITY OF GROWTH      The data available regarding the effect of the locality of  growth upon the properties of wood are not sufficient to warrant  definite conclusions. The subject has, however, been kept in  mind in many of the U.S. Forest Service timber tests and the  following quotations are assembled from various reports:    \"In both the Cuban and longleaf pine the locality where grown  appears to have but little influence on weight or strength, and  there is no reason to believe that the longleaf pine from one  State is better than that from any other, since such variations  as are claimed can be found on any 40-acre lot of timber in any  State. But with loblolly and still more with shortleaf this  seems not to be the case. Being widely distributed over many  localities different in soil and climate, the growth of the  shortleaf pine seems materially influenced by location. The wood  from the southern coast and gulf region and even Arkansas is  generally heavier than the wood from localities farther north.  Very light and fine-grained wood is seldom met near the southern  limit of the range, while it is almost the rule in Missouri,  where forms resembling the Norway pine are by no means rare. The  loblolly, occupying both wet and dry soils, varies accordingly.\"  Cir. No. 12, p. 6.    \" ... It is clear that as all localities have their heavy and  their light timber, so they all share in strong and weak, hard  and soft material, and the difference in quality of material is  evidently far more a matter of individual variation than of soil  or climate.\" _Ibid._, p.22    \"A representative committee of the Carriage Builders'  Association had publicly declared that this important industry  could not depend upon the supplies of southern timber, as the  oak grown in the South lacked the necessary qualities demanded  in carriage construction. Without experiment this statement  could be little better than a guess, and was doubly unwarranted,  since it condemned an enormous amount of material, and one  produced under a great variety of conditions and by at least a  dozen species of trees, involving, therefore, a complexity of  problems difficult enough for the careful investigator, and  entirely beyond the few unsystematic observations of the members  of a committee on a flying trip through one of the greatest  timber regions of the world.    \"A number of samples were at once collected (part of them  supplied by the carriage builders' committee), and the fallacy  of the broad statement mentioned was fully demonstrated by a  short series of tests and a more extensive study into structure  and weight of these materials. From these tests it appears that  pieces of white oak from Arkansas excelled well-selected pieces  from Connecticut, both in stiffness and endwise compression (the  two most important forms of resistance).\" Report upon the  forestry investigations of the U.S.D.A. 1877-1898, p. 331. See  also Rep. of Div. of For., 1890, p. 209.    \"In some regions there are many small, stunted hickories, which  most users will not touch. They have narrow sap, are likely to  be birdpecked, and show very slow growth. Yet five of these  trees from a steep, dry south slope in West Virginia had an  average strength fully equal to that of the pignut from the  better situation, and were superior in toughness, the work to  maximum load being 36.8 as against 31.2 for pignut. The trees  had about twice as many rings per inch as others from better  situations.    \"This, however, is not very significant, as trees of the same  species, age, and size, growing side by side under the same  conditions of soil and situation, show great variation in their  technical value. It is hard to account for this difference, but  it seems that trees growing in wet or moist situations are  rather inferior to those growing on fresher soil; also, it is  claimed by many hickory users that the wood from limestone"]]]
