In this consideration of the Highest Yogi Philosophy, and its teaching,  we would again say to our students, that which we said to them in _\"The  Advanced Course\"_--that we do not attempt to teach the \"why\" of the  Manifestation of The Absolute, but rest content with delivering the  Message of the Yogi Sages, which deals with the \"how.\" As we stated in  the lessons referred to, we incline to that school of the Higher  Teachings, which holds that the \"Why\" of the Infinite Manifestation  must, of necessity, rest with the Infinite alone, and that the finite  mind cannot hope to answer the question. We hold that in all the  Universal Mind, or in any of its Mind Manifestations, there is to be  found no answer to this question! Wrapped in the Essence of the  Absolute Spirit, alone, is this Final Answer!    The Sages, and Masters, from their high spiritual points of  observation, possess many truths regarding the \"how\" side of the  question that would appear almost like Infinite Wisdom itself, compared  with our puny knowledge. But even these great souls report that they do  not possess the answer to the Final Question--the \"Why\" of the Infinite  Manifestation. And so we may be excused from attempting to answer  it--and without shame or sense of shortcoming do we still say, to this  question, \"We do not know!\"    In order that the Final Question may be fully understood let us  consider it for a moment. We find the Question arising from the  following condition:    The human Reason is compelled to admit that there is an Infinite,  Eternal, Causeless REALITY underlying all forms of manifestation in the  phenomenal world. It is likewise compelled to admit that this REALITY  must comprise All that Really Is--and that there can be nothing Real  outside of Itself. Arising from this is the Truth, that all forms of  phenomenal manifestation, must emanate _from_ the One Reality, for  there is nothing else Real from which they could emanate. And the  twin-Truth that these forms of manifestation, must also be _in_ the  Being of the One Reality, for there is nowhere outside of the All  wherein they might find a place. So this One Reality is seen to be  \"That from which All Things flow\"; and \"That in which All Things live,  and move and have their being.\"    Therefore All Things _emanate from_, and are _contained in_ the One  Reality. We shall consider \"just how\" later on, but the question which  confronts us, and which has been called the \"Final Question\"--and that  which we pronounce unanswerable--is this: \"Why has the Infinite  manifested and emanated Finite forms of being?\" You will see the nature  of the question when you stop to consider: (1) The Infinite cannot have  Desire, for that is a Finite quality; (2) It cannot lack anything, for  that would take away from its Infinity; (3) and even if it did lack  anything, from whence could it expect to acquire it; for there is  nothing outside of itself--if It lacks anything, it must continue to  always lack it, for there is no outside source from which It could  obtain anything which it does not already possess. And Desire would be,  of course, a _wanting_ for something which it lacked--so It could not  Desire unless it Lacked--and it would know that Desire would be  hopeless, even if indeed it did Lack.    So you see that if we regard the Infinite Reality as Perfect, we must  drop all ideas of It Desiring or Lacking--and of it Growing or  Improving--or of it obtaining more Power, or Knowledge. These ideas are  ridiculous, for an Absolute, Infinite Reality, must possess  All-Knowledge; All-Power; All-Presence, else it is not Absolute and  Infinite. And, if It does not possess these attributes of Being, then  It can never hope to acquire them, for there is Nowhere from whence  they could be acquired--there is no Source outside of the All-Source. A  Finite Thing, may lack, and desire, and improve and develop, for there  is the Universal Source from which it may draw. But the Infinite has no  Universal Source, for it is Its own Source. Do you see the nature of  the Final Question? If not we will again state it--it is this:    \"Why should the Infinite Reality, which possesses all that may be  possessed, and which in itself is the only Source of Things--WHY should  It Desire to manifest a Universe from and within Itself?\"    A little consideration will show you that there is no intelligent  answer to the \"Why,\" either in your own minds, or in the writings and  teachings of the greatest minds. The matter is important, to those who  are confronted every day with some of the many attempts to answer this  Final Question--it is well that our students inform them regarding the  futility of such questioning. And with this end in view, we shall  herein give a few of the wise \"guesses\" at the answer, and our reasons  for considering them inadequate. We ask the student to consider  carefully these remarks, for by so doing he will post himself, and will  be saved much tedious and perplexing wandering along the dangerous  places in the Swamp of Metaphysics, following the will-o'-the-wisp of  Finite Mind masquerading as the Infinite Wisdom! Beware of the False  Lights! They lead to the quagmire and quicksands of thought!    Let us now consider some of these \"guesses\" at the answer to the Final  Question. Some thinkers have held that the Absolute was bound by a  Divine Necessity to manifest itself as Many. The answer to this is that  the Absolute could not be _bound_ by anything, inner or outer, else it  would not be Absolute and Infinite, but would be Relative and Finite.  Another set of thinkers have held that the Absolute found within itself  a Desire to Manifest as Many. From whence could come such an  action-causing Desire? The Absolute could lack nothing, and there would  be nothing for it to desire to gain, other than that which It already  possessed. One does not desire things one already has, but only what he  lacks.    Another school would tell us that the Infinite wished to _Express_  itself in the phenomenal world. Why? Such a phenomenal world could only  be reflection of Its power, witnessed only by Itself, and could contain  nothing that was not already contained in the All. To what end would  such a wish tend? What would be accomplished or gained? The Infinite  All could not become anything more than It already was--so why the wish  for expression? Some say that the whole phenomenal world is but _Maya_,  or Illusion, and does not exist at all. Then who else than the Infinite  caused the Illusion, and why the necessity? This answer only removes  the question back one point, and does not really answer it. Some would  say that the Universe is the \"dream of the Infinite.\" Can we conceive  the Infinite Being as exercising the finite faculty of \"dreaming\"--is  not this childish?    Others would have us believe that the Absolute is indulging in a \"game\"  or \"play,\" when he makes Universes, and those inhabiting them. Can  anyone really believe this of The Absolute--playing like a child, with  men and women, worlds and suns, as Its blocks and tin-soldiers? Why  should the Infinite \"play\"?--does It need amusement and \"fun\" like a  child? Poor Man, with his attempts to read the Riddle of the Infinite!    We know of teachers who gravely instruct their pupils in the idea that  the Absolute and Infinite One manifests Universes and Universal Life,  and all that flows from them, because It wishes to \"gain experience\"  through objective existence. This idea, in many forms has been so  frequently advanced that it is worth while to consider its absurdity.  In the first place, what \"experience\" could be gained by the Absolute  and Infinite One? What could It expect to gain and learn, that it did  not already know and possess? One can gain experience only from others,  and outside things--not from oneself entirely separated from the  outside world of things. And there would be no \"outside\" for the  Infinite. These people would have us believe that The Absolute emanated  a Universe from Itself--which could contain nothing except that which  was obtained from Itself--and then proceeded to gain experience from  it. Having no \"outside\" from which it could obtain experiences and  sentences and sensations, it proceeded to make (from Itself) an  imitation one--that is what this answer amounts to. Can you accept it?    The whole trouble in all of these answers, or attempted answers, is  that the answerer first conceives of the Absolute-Infinite Being, as a  Relative-Finite Man, and then proceeds to explain what this Big Man  would do. This is but an exaggerated form of anthropomorphism--the  conception of God as a Man raised to great proportions. It is but an  extension of the idea which gave birth to the savage conceptions of  Deity as a cruel chief or mighty warrior, with human passions, hates,  and revenge; love, passions, and desires.    Arising from the same cause, and akin to the theories advanced above  are similar ones, which hold that the Absolute cannot dwell alone, but  must forever bring forth souls from Itself--this was the idea of  _Plotinus_, the Greek philosopher. Others have thought that the  Infinite was possessed of such a consuming love, that It manifested  objects upon which it could bestow Its affections. Others have thought  that It was lonesome, and desired companionship. Some have spoken of  the Absolute as \"sacrificing\" itself, in becoming Many, instead of  remaining One. Others have taught that the Infinite somehow has become  entangled in Its Manifestations, and had lost the knowledge of Its  Oneness--hence their teachings of \"I Am God.\" Others, holding to a  similar idea, tell us that the Infinite is deliberately \"masquerading\"  as the Many, in order to fool and mystify Itself--a show of Itself; by  Itself, and for Itself!

We beg our readers to observe the form of the waist (evidently  innocent of corsets and tight dresses) of this model woman, and also  that of the Greek Slave in the accompanying outlines. These forms  are such as unperverted nature and the highest art alike require.  To compress the waist, and thereby change its form, pushing the ribs  inward, displacing the vital organs, and preventing the due expansion  of the lungs, is as destructive to beauty as it is to health.             *       *       *       *       *    THE HISTORY, MYSTERY, BENEFITS AND INJURIES OF THE CORSET.      [Illustration: The Corset in the 18th Century.]      1. The origin of the corset is lost in remote antiquity. The figures  of the early Egyptian women show clearly an artificial shape of the  waist produced by some style of corset. A similar style of dress must  also have prevailed among the ancient Jewish maidens; for Isaiah, in  calling upon the women to put away their personal adornments, says:  \"Instead of a girdle there shall be a rent, and instead of a stomacher  (corset) a girdle of sackcloth.\"    2. Homer also tells us of the cestus or girdle of Venus, which was  borrowed by the haughty Juno with a view to increasing her personal  attractions, that Jupiter might be a more tractable and orderly  husband.    3. Coming down to the later times, we find the corset was used in  France and England as early as the 12th century.    4. The most extensive and extreme use of the corset occurred in the  16th century, during the reign of Catherine de Medici of France and  Queen Elizabeth of England. With Catherine de Medici a thirteen-inch  waist measurement was considered the standard of fashion, while a  thick waist was an abomination. No lady could consider her figure of  proper shape unless she could span her waist with her two hands. To  produce this result a strong rigid corset was worn night and day until  the waist was laced down to the required size. Then over this corset  was placed the steel apparatus shown in the illustration on next page.  This corset-cover reached from the hip to the throat, and produced a  rigid figure over which the dress would fit with perfect smoothness.    [Illustration: Steel Corset worn in Catherine's time.]    5. During the 18th century corsets were largely made from a species  of leather known as \"Bend,\" which was not unlike that used for shoe  soles, and measured nearly a quarter of an inch in thickness. One  of the most popular corsets of the time was the corset and stomacher  shown in the accompanying illustration.    6. About the time of the French Revolution a reaction set in against  tight lacing, and for a time there was a return to the early  classical Greek costume. This style of dress prevailed, with various  modifications, until about 1810 when corsets and tight lacing again  returned with threefold fury. Buchan, a prominent writer of this  period, says that it was by no means uncommon to see \"a mother lay her  daughter down upon the carpet, and, placing her foot upon her back,  break half a dozen laces in tightening her stays.\"    7. It is reserved to our own time to demonstrate that corsets and  tight lacing do not necessarily go hand in hand. Distortion and  feebleness are not beauty. A proper proportion should exist between  the size of the waist and the breadth of the shoulders and hips,  and if the waist is diminished below this proportion, it suggests  disproportion and invalidism rather than grace and beauty.    8. The perfect corset is one which possesses just that degree of  rigidity which will prevent it from wrinkling, but will at the same  time allow freedom in the bending and twisting of the body. Corsets  boned with whalebone, horn or steel are necessarily stiff, rigid and  uncomfortable. After a few days' wear the bones or steels become bent  and set in position, or, as more frequently happens, they break and  cause injury or discomfort to the wearer.    9. About seven years ago an article was discovered for the stiffening  of corsets, which has revolutionized the corset industry of the world.  This article is manufactured from the natural fibers of the Mexican  Ixtle plant, and is known as Coraline. It consists of straight, stiff  fibers like bristles bound together into a cord by being wound with  two strands of thread passing in opposite directions. This produces an  elastic fiber intermediate in stiffness between twine and whalebone.  It cannot break, but it possesses all the stiffness and flexibility  necessary to hold the corset in shape and prevent its wrinkling.    We congratulate the ladies of to-day upon the advantages they enjoy  over their sisters of two centuries ago, in the forms and the graceful  and easy curves of the corsets now made as compared with those of  former times.    [Illustration]    [Illustration: Forms of Corsets in the time of Elizabeth of England.]    [Illustration: EGYPTIAN CORSET.]             *       *       *       *       *    TIGHT-LACING.      It destroys natural beauty and creates an unpleasant and irritable  temper. A tight-laced chest and a good disposition cannot go  together. The human form has been molded by nature, the best shape is  undoubtedly that which she has given it. To endeavor to render it more  elegant by artificial means is to change it; to make it much smaller  below and much larger above is to destroy its beauty; to keep it cased  up in a kind of domestic cuirass is not only to deform it, but to  expose the internal parts to serious injury. Under such compression as  is commonly practiced by ladies, the development of the bones, which  are still tender, does not take place conformably to the intention  of nature, because nutrition is necessarily stopped, and they  consequently become twisted and deformed.    [Illustration: THE NATURAL WAIST. THE EFFECTS OF LACING.]    Those who wear these appliances of tight-lacing often complain that  they cannot sit upright without them--are sometimes, indeed, compelled  to wear them during all the twenty-four hours; a fact which proves to  what extent such articles weaken the muscles of the trunk. The injury  does not fall merely on the internal structure of the body, but also  on its beauty, and on the temper and feelings with which that beauty  is associated. Beauty is in reality but another name for expression  of countenance, which is the index of sound health, intelligence,  good feelings and peace of mind. All are aware that uneasy feelings,  existing habitually in the breast, speedily exhibit their signature  on the countenance, and that bitter thoughts or a bad temper spoil the  human expression of its comeliness and grace.    [Illustration: NATURAL HAIR.]             *       *       *       *       *    THE CARE OF THE HAIR.      1. THE COLOR OF THE HAIR.--The color of the hair corresponds with that  of the skin--being dark or black, with a dark complexion, and red or  yellow with a fair skin. When a white skin is seen in conjunction  with black hair, as among the women of Syria and Barbary, the apparent  exception arises from protection from the sun's rays, and opposite  colors are often found among people of one prevailing feature. Thus  red-haired Jews are not uncommon, though the nation in general have  dark complexion and hair.    2. THE IMPERISHABLE NATURE OF HAIR.--The imperishable nature of hair  arises from the combination of salt and metals in its composition. In  old tombs and on mummies it has been found in a perfect state, after  a lapse of over two thousand years. There are many curious accounts  proving the indestructibility of the human hair.    3. TUBULAR.--In the human family the hairs are tubular, the tubes  being intersected by partitions, resembling in some degree the  cellular tissue of plants. Their hollowness prevents incumbrance from  weight, while their power of resistance is increased by having their  traverse sections rounded in form.    4. CAUTIONS.--It is ascertained that a full head of hair, beard  and whiskers, are a prevention against colds and consumptions.  Occasionally, however, it is found necessary to remove the hair from  the head, in cases of fever or disease, to stay the inflammatory  symptoms, and to relieve the brain. The head should invariably be kept  cool. Close night-caps are unhealthy, and smoking-caps and coverings  for the head within doors are alike detrimental to the free growth of  the hair, weakening it, and causing it to fall out.      HOW TO BEAUTIFY AND PRESERVE THE HAIR.    1. TO BEAUTIFY THE HAIR.--Keep the head clean, the pores of the skin  open, and the whole circulatory system in a healthy condition, and you  will have no need of bear's grease (alias hog's lard). Where there  is a tendency in the hair to fall off on account of the weakness or  sluggishness of the circulation, or an unhealthy state of the skin,  cold water and friction with a tolerably stiff brush are probably the  best remedial agents.    2. BARBER'S SHAMPOOS.--Are very beneficial if properly prepared. They  should not be made too strong. Avoid strong shampoos of any kind.  Great caution should be exercised in this matter.    3. CARE OF THE HAIR.--To keep the hair healthy, keep the head clean.  Brush the scalp well with a stiff brush, while dry. Then wash with  castile soap, and rub into the roots bay rum, brandy or camphor  water. This done twice a month will prove beneficial. Brush the  scalp thoroughly twice a week. Dampen the hair with soft water at the  toilet, and do not use oil.    4. HAIR WASH.--Take one ounce of borax, half an ounce of camphor  powder--these ingredients fine--and dissolve them in one quart of  boiling water. When cool, the solution will be ready for use. Dampen  the hair frequently. This wash is said not only to cleanse and  beautify, but to strengthen the hair, preserve the color and prevent  baldness.
