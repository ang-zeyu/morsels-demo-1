Heschl[37] has reported a  case in which absence of both olfactory nerves coincided with defective  development of the sexual organs. Fere remarks that the impotent show a  repugnance for sexual odors. Dr. Kiernan informs me that in women after  ooephorectomy he has noted a tendency to diminished (and occasionally  increased) sense of smell. These questions, however, await more careful  and extended observation.    A very significant transition from the phenomena of personal odor to those  of sexual attraction by personal odor is to be found in the fact that  among the peoples inhabiting a large part of the world's surface the  ordinary salutation between friends is by mutual smelling of the person.  In some form or another the method of salutation by applying the nose to  the nose, face, or hand of a friend in greeting is found throughout a  large part of the Pacific, among the Papuans, the Eskimo, the hill tribes  of India, in Africa, and elsewhere.[38] Thus, among a certain hill tribe  in India, according to Lewin, they smell a friend's cheek: \"in their  language, they do not say, 'Give me a kiss,' but they say 'Smell me.'\" And  on the Gambia, according to F. Moore, \"When the men salute the women,  they, instead of shaking their hands, put it up to their noses, and smell  twice to the back of it.\" Here we have very clearly a recognition of the  emotional value of personal odor widely prevailing throughout the world.  The salutation on an olfactory basis may, indeed, be said to be more  general than the salutation on a tactile basis on which European  handshaking rests, each form involving one of the two most intimate and  emotional senses. The kiss may be said to be a development proceeding both  from the olfactory and the tactile bases, with perhaps some other elements  as well, and is too complex to be regarded as a phenomenon of either  purely tactile or purely olfactory origin.[39]    As the sole factor in sexual selection olfaction must be rare. It is said  that Asiatic princes have sometimes caused a number of the ladies to race  in the seraglio garden until they were heated; their garments have then  been brought to the prince, who has selected one of them solely by the  odor.[40] There was here a sexual selection mainly by odor. Any exclusive  efficacy of the olfactory sense is rare, not so much because the  impressions of this sense are inoperative, but because agreeable personal  odors are not sufficiently powerful, and the olfactory organ is too  obtuse, to enable smell to take precedence of sight. Nevertheless, in many  people, it is probable that certain odors, especially those that are  correlated with a healthy and sexually desirable person, tend to be  agreeable; they are fortified by their association with the loved person,  sometimes to an irresistible degree; and their potency is doubtless  increased by the fact, to which reference has already been made, that many  odors, including some bodily odors, are nervous stimulants.    It is possible that the sexual associations of odors have been still  further fortified by a tendency to correlation between a high development  of the olfactory organ and a high development of the sexual apparatus. An  association between a large nose and a large male organ is a very ancient  observation and has been verified occasionally in recent times. There is  normally at puberty a great increase in the septum of the nose, and it is  quite conceivable, in view of the sympathy, which, as we shall see,  certainly exists between the olfactory and sexual region, that the two  regions may develop together under a common influence.        The Romans firmly believed in the connection between a large nose      and a large penis. \"Noscitur e naso quanta sit hasta viro,\"      stated Ovid. This belief continued to prevail, especially in      Italy, through the middle ages; the physiognomists made much of      it, and licentious women (like Joanna of Naples) were, it      appears, accustomed to bear it in mind, although disappointment      is recorded often to have followed. (See e.g., the quotations and      references given by J.N. Mackenzie, \"Physiological and      Pathological Relations between the Nose and the Sexual Apparatus      in Man.\" _Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin_, No. 82, January,      1898; also Hagen, _Sexuelle Osphresiologie_, pp. 15-19.) A      similar belief as to the association between the sexual impulse      in women and a long nose was evidently common in England in the      sixteenth century, for in Massinger's _Emperor of the East_ (Act      II, Scene I) we read,            \"Her nose, which by its length assures me          Of storms at midnight if I fail to pay her          The tribute she expects.\"        At the present day, a proverb of the Venetian people still      embodies the belief in the connection between a large nose and a      large sexual member.        The probability that such an association tends in many cases to      prevail is indicated not only by the beliefs of antiquity, when      more careful attention was paid to these matters, but by the      testimony of various modern observers, although it does not      appear that any series of exact observations have yet been made.        It may be noted that Marro, in his careful anthropological study      of criminals (_I Caratteri dei Delinquenti_), found no class of      criminals with so large a proportion alike of anomalies of the      nose and anomalies of the genital organs as sexual offenders.    However this may be, it is less doubtful that there is a very intimate  relation both in men and women between the olfactory mucous membrane of  the nose and the whole genital apparatus, that they frequently show a  sympathetic action, that influences acting on the genital sphere will  affect the nose, and occasionally, it is probable, influences acting on  the nose reflexly affect the genital sphere. To discuss these  relationships would here be out of place, since specialists are not  altogether in agreement concerning the matter. A few are inclined to  regard the association as extremely intimate, so that each region is  sensitive even to slight stimuli applied to the other region, while, on  the other hand, many authorities ignore altogether the question of the  relationship. It would appear, however, that there really is, in a  considerable number of people at all events, a reflex connection of this  kind. It has especially been noted that in many cases congestion of the  nose precedes menstruation.    Bleeding of the nose is specially apt to occur at puberty and during  adolescence, while in women it may take the place of menstruation and is  sometimes more apt to occur at the menstrual periods; disorders of the  nose have also been found to be aggravated at these periods. It has even  been possible to control bleeding of the nose, both in men and women, by  applying ice to the sexual regions. In both men and women, again, cases  have been recorded in which sexual excitement, whether of coitus or  masturbation, has been followed by bleeding of the nose. In numerous cases  it is followed by slight congestive conditions of the nasal passages and  especially by sneezing. Various authors have referred to this phenomenon;  I am acquainted with a lady in whom it is fairly constant.[41] Fere  records the case of a lady, a nervous subject, who began to experience  intense spontaneous sexual excitement shortly after marriage, accompanied  by much secretion from the nose.[42] J.N. Mackenzie is acquainted with a  number of such cases, and he considers that the popular expression  \"bride's cold\" indicates that this effect of strong sexual excitement is  widely recognized.        The late Professor Hack, of Freiburg, in 1884, called general      medical attention to the intimate connection between the nose and      states of nervous hyperexcitability in various parts of the body,      although such a connection had been recognized for many centuries      in medical literature. While Hack and his disciples thus gave      prominence to this association, they undoubtedly greatly      exaggerated its importance and significance. (Sir Felix Semon,      _British Medical Journal_, November 9, 1901.) Even many workers      who have more recently further added to our knowledge have also,      as sometimes happens with enthusiasts, unduly strained their own      data. Starting from the fact that in women during menstruation      examination of the nose reveals a degree of congestion not found      during the rest of the month, Fliess (_Die Beziehungen zwischen      Nase und Weiblichen Geschlechtsorganen_, 1897), with the help of      a number of elaborate and prolonged observations, has reached      conclusions which, while they seem to be hazardous at some      points, have certainly contributed to build up our knowledge of      this obscure subject. Schiff (_Wiener klinische Wochenschrift_,      1900, p. 58, summarized in _British Medical Journal_, February      16, 1901), starting from a skeptical standpoint, has confirmed      some of Fliess's results, and in a large number of cases      controlled painful menstruation by painting with cocaine the      so-called \"genital spots\" in the nose, all possibility of      suggestion being avoided. Ries, of Chicago, has been similarly      successful with the method of Fliess (_American Gynaecology_, vol.      iii, No. 4, 1903). Benedikt (_Wiener medicinische Wochenschrift_,      No. 8, 1901, summarized in _Journal of Medical Science_, October,      1901), while pointing out that the nose is not the only organ in      sympathetic relation with the sexual sphere, suggests that the      mechanism of the relationship is involved in the larger problem      of the harmony in growth and in nutrition of the different parts      of the organism. In this way, probably, we may "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#18)"],[1,"  indicated by several of the reproductions in Fuch's _Erotsiche      Element in der Karikatur_, such as Delorme's \"La Necessite n'a      point de Loi.\" (It should be added that such a scene by no means      necessarily possesses any erotic symbolism, as we may see in      Rembrandt's etching commonly called \"Le Femme qui Pisse,\" in      which the reflected lights on the partly shadowed stream furnish      an artistic motive which is obviously free from any trace of      obscenity.) In the case which Krafft-Ebing quotes from Maschka of      a young man who would induce young girls to dance naked in his      room, to leap, and to urinate in his presence, whereupon seminal      ejaculation would take place, we have a typical example of      urolagnic symbolism in a form adequate to produce complete      gratification. A case in which the urolagnic form of scatalogic      symbolism reached its fullest development as a sexual perversion      has been described in Russia by Sukhanoff (summarized in      _Archives d'Anthropologie Criminelle_, November, 1900, and      _Annales Medico-psychologiques_, February, 1901), that of a young      man of 27, of neuropathic temperament, who when he once chanced      to witness a woman urinating experienced voluptuous sensations.      From that moment he sought close contact with women urinating,      the maximum of gratification being reached when he could place      himself in such a position that a woman, in all innocence, would      urinate into his mouth. All his amorous adventures were concerned      with the search for opportunities for procuring this difficult      gratification. Closets in which he was able to hide, winter      weather and dull days he found most favorable to success. (A      somewhat similar case is recorded in the _Archives de      Neurologie_, 1902, p. 462.)        In the case of a robust man of neuropathic heredity recorded by      Pelanda some light is shed on the psychic attitude in these      manifestations; there was masturbation up to the age of 16, when      he abandoned the practice, and up to the age of 30 found complete      satisfaction in drinking the still hot urine of women. When a      lady or girl in the house went to her room to satisfy a need of      this kind, she had hardly left it but he hastened in, overcome by      extreme excitement, culminating in spontaneous ejaculation. The      younger the woman the greater the transport he experienced. It is      noteworthy that in this, as possibly in all similar cases, there      was no sensory perversion and no morbid attraction of taste or      smell; he stated that the action of his senses was suspended by      his excitement, and that he was quite unable to perceive the odor      or taste of the fluid. (Pelanda, \"Pornopatice,\" _Archivio di      Psichiatria_, facs. iii-iv, 1889, p. 356.) It is in the emotional      symbolism that the fascination lies and not in any sensory      perversion.        Magnan records the spontaneous development of this sexual      symbolism in a girl of 11, of good intellectual development but      alcoholic heredity, who seduced a boy younger than herself to      mutual masturbation, and on one occasion, lying on the ground and      raising her clothes, asked him to urinate on her. (_International      Congress of Criminal Anthropology_, 1889.) This case (except for      the early age of the subject) illustrates sporadically occurring      urolagnic symbolism in a woman, to whom such symbolism is fairly      obvious on account of the close resemblance between the emission      of urine and the ejaculation of semen in the man, and the fact      that the same conduit serves for both fluids. (A urolagnic      day-dream of this kind is recorded in the history of a lady      contained in the third volume of these _Studies_, Appendix B,      History VIII.) The natural and inevitable character of this      symbolism is shown by the fact that among primitive peoples urine      is sometimes supposed to possess the fertilizing virtues of      semen. J.G. Frazer in his edition of Pausanias (vol. iv, p. 139)      brings together various stories of women impregnated by urine.      Hartland also (_Legend of Perseus_, vol. i, pp. 76, 92) records      legends of women who were impregnated by accidentally or      intentionally drinking urine.        The symbolic sexual significance of urolagnia has hitherto      usually been confused with the fetichistic and mainly olfactory      perversion by which the excretion itself becomes a source of      sexual excitement. Long since Tardieu referred, under the name of      \"renifleurs,\" to persons who were said to haunt the neighborhood      of quiet passages, more especially in the neighborhood of      theatres, and who when they perceived a woman emerge after      urination, would hasten to excite themselves by the odor of the      excretion. Possibly a fetichism of this kind existed in a case      recorded by Belletrud and Mercier (_Annales d'Hygiene Publique_,      June, 1904, p. 48). A weak-minded, timid youth, who was very      sexual but not attractive to women, would watch for women who      were about to urinate and immediately they had passed on would go      and lick the spot they had moistened, at the same time      masturbating. Such a fetichistic perversion is strictly analogous      to the fetichism by which women's handkerchiefs, aprons or      underlinen become capable of affording sexual gratification. A      very complete case of such urolagnic fetichism--complete because      separated from association with the person accomplishing the act      of urination--has been recorded by Moraglia in a woman. It is the      case of a beautiful and attractive young woman of 18, with thick      black hair, and expressive vivacious eyes, but sallow complexion.      Married a year previously, but childless, she experienced a      certain amount of pleasure in coitus, but she preferred      masturbation, and frankly acknowledged that she was highly      excited by the odor of fermented urine. So strong was this      fetichism that when, for instance, she passed a street urinal she      was often obliged to go aside and masturbate; once she went for      this purpose into the urinal itself and was almost discovered in      the act, and on another occasion into a church. Her perversion      caused her much worry because of the fear of detection. She      preferred, when she could, to obtain a bottle of urine--which      must be stale and a man's (this, she said, she could detect by      the smell)--and to shut herself up in her own room, holding the      bottle in one hand and repeatedly masturbating with the other.      (Moraglia, \"Psicopatie Sessuali,\" _Archivio di Psichiatria_, vol.      xiii, fasc. 6, p. 267, 1892.) This case is of especial interest      because of the great rarity of fully developed fetichism in      women. In a slight and germinal degree I believe that cases of      fetichism are not uncommon in women, but they are certainly rare      in a well-marked form, and Krafft-Ebing declared, even in the      late editions of his _Psychopathia Sexualis_, that he knew of no      cases in women.    So far we have been concerned with the urolagnic rather than the  coprolagnic variety of scatalogical symbolism. Although the two are  sometimes associated there is no necessary connection, and most usually  there is no tendency for the one to involve the other. Urolagnia is  certainly much the more frequently found; the act of urination is far more  apt to suggest erotically symbolical ideas than the idea of defecation.  It is not difficult to understand why this should be so. The act of  urination lends itself more easily to sexual symbolism; it is more  intimately associated with the genital function; its repetition is  necessary at more frequent intervals so that it is more in evidence;  moreover, its product, unlike that of the act of defecation, is not  offensive to the senses. Still coprolagnia occurs and not so very  infrequently. Burton remarked that even the normal lover is affected by  this feeling: \"immo nec ipsum amicae stercus foctet.\"[29]    Of Caligula who, however, was scarcely sane, it was said \"et quidem  stercus uxoris degustavit.\"[30] In Parisian brothels (according to Taxil  and others) provision is made for those who are sexually excited by the  spectacle of the act of defecation (without reference to contact or odor)  by means of a \"tabouret de verre,\" from under the glass floor of which the  spectacle of the defecating women may be closely observed. It may be added  that the erotic nature of such a spectacle is referred to in the Marquis  de Sade's novels.    There is one motive for the existence of coprolagnia which must not be  passed over, because it has doubtless frequently served as a mode of  transition to what, taken by itself, may well seem the least aesthetically  attractive of erotic symbols. I refer to the tendency of the nates to  become a sexual fetich. The nates have in all ages and in all parts of the  world been frequently regarded as one of the most aesthetically beautiful  parts of the feminine body.[31] It is probable that on the basis of this  entirely normal attraction more than one form of erotic symbolism is at  all events in part supported. Duehren and others have considered that the  aesthetic charm of the nates is one of the motives which prompt the desire  to inflict flagellation on women. In the same way--certainly in some and  probably in many cases--the sexual charm of the nates progressively  extends to the anal region, to the act of defecation, and finally to the  feces.        In a case of Krafft-Ebing's (_Op. cit._, p. 183) the subject,      when a child of 6, accidentally placed his hand in contact with      the nates of the little girl who sat next to him in school, and      experienced so great a pleasure in this contact that he      frequently repeated it;"]]]
