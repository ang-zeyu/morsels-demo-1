Still she kept an even keel as the reef was to leeward and she  had just sail enough to hold her up. But at high tide in the afternoon  there was a lull and she began to heel over towards the unfathomable  depths. Just then, however, a quiver ran through her from stem to stern;  an extra sail that Drake had ordered up caught what little wind there  was; and, with the last throb of the rising tide, she shook herself free  and took the water as quietly as if her hull was being launched. There  were perils enough to follow: dangers of navigation, the arrival of a  Portuguese fleet that was only just eluded, and all the ordinary risks  of travel in times when what might be called the official guide to  voyagers opened with the ominous advice, _First make thy Will_. But the  greatest had now been safely passed.    Meanwhile all sorts of rumors were rife in Spain, New Spain, and  England. Drake had been hanged. That rumor came from the hanging of John  Oxenham at Lima. The _Golden Hind_ had foundered. That tale was what  Winter, captain of the _Elizabeth_, was not altogether unwilling should  be thought after his own failure to face another great antarctic storm.  He had returned in 1578. News from Peru and Mexico came home in 1579;  but no Drake. So, as 1580 wore on, his friends began to despair, the  Spaniards and Portuguese rejoiced, while Burleigh, with all who found  Drake an inconvenience in their diplomatic way, began to hope that  perhaps the sea had smoothed things over. In August the London merchants  were thrown into consternation by the report of Drake's incredible  captures; for their own merchant fleet was just then off for Spain. They  waited on the Council, who soothed them with the assurance that Drake's  voyage was a purely private venture so far as prizes were concerned.  With this diplomatic quibble they were forced to be content.    But worse was soon to follow. The king of Portugal died. Philip's army  marched on Lisbon immediately, and all the Portuguese possessions were  added to the already overgrown empire of Spain. Worse still, this  annexation gave Philip what he wanted in the way of ships; for Portugal  had more than Spain. The Great Armada was now expected to be formed  against England, unless Elizabeth's miraculous diplomacy could once more  get her clear of the fast-entangling coils. To add to the general  confusion, this was also the year in which the Pope sent his picked  Jesuits to England, and in which Elizabeth was carrying on her last  great international flirtation with ugly, dissipated Francis of Anjou,  brother to the king of France.    Into this imbroglio sailed the _Golden Hind_ with ballast of silver and  cargo of gold. 'Is Her Majesty alive and well?' said Drake to the first  sail outside of Plymouth Sound. 'Ay, ay, she is, my Master,' answered  the skipper of a fishing smack, 'but there's a deal o' sickness here in  Plymouth'; on which Drake, ready for any excuse to stay afloat, came to  anchor in the harbor. His wife, pretty Mary Newman from the banks of  Tavy, took boat to see him, as did the Mayor, whose business was to warn  him to keep quiet till his course was clear. So Drake wrote off to the  Queen and all the Councillors who were on his side. The answer from the  Councillors was not encouraging; so he warped out quietly and anchored  again behind Drake's Island in the Sound. But presently the Queen's own  message came, commanding him to an audience at which, she said, she  would be pleased to view some of the curiosities he had brought from  foreign parts. Straight on that hint he started up to town with spices,  diamonds, pearls, and gold enough to win any woman's pardon and consent.    The audience lasted six hours. Meanwhile the Council sat without any of  Drake's supporters and ordered all the treasure to be impounded in the  Tower. But Leicester, Walsingham, and Hatton, all members of Drake's  syndicate, refused to sign; while Elizabeth herself, the managing  director, suspended the order till her further pleasure should be known.  The Spanish ambassador 'did burn with passion against Drake.' The  Council was distractingly divided. The London merchants trembled for  their fleet. But Elizabeth was determined that the blow to Philip should  hurt him as much as it could without producing an immediate war; while  down among Drake's own West-Countrymen 'the case was clear in sea  divinitie,' as similar cases had often been before. Tremayne, a  Devonshire magistrate and friend of the syndicate, could hardly find  words to express his contentment with Drake, whom he called 'a man of  great government, and that by the rules of God and His Book.'    Elizabeth decided to stand by Drake. She claimed, what was true, that he  had injured no actual place or person of the King of Spain's, nothing  but property afloat, appropriate for reprisals. All England knew the  story of Ulua and approved of reprisals in accordance with the spirit of  the age. And the Queen had a special grievance about Ireland, where the  Spaniards were entrenched in Smerwick, thus adding to the confusion of a  rebellion that never quite died down at any time. Philip explained that  the Smerwick Spaniards were there as private volunteers. Elizabeth  answered that Drake was just the same. The English tide, at all events,  was turning in his favor. The indefatigable Stowe, chronicler of London,  records that 'the people generally applauded his wonderful long  adventures and rich prizes. His name and fame became admirable in all  places, the people swarming daily in the streets to behold him, vowing  hatred to all that misliked him.'    The _Golden Hind_ had been brought round to London, where she was the  greatest attraction of the day. Finally, on the 4th of April, 1581,  Elizabeth went on board in state, to a banquet 'finer than has ever been  seen in England since King Henry VIII,' said the furious Spanish  ambassador in his report to Philip. But this was not her chief offence  in Spanish eyes. For here, surrounded by her court, and in the presence  of an enormous multitude of her enthusiastic subjects, she openly defied  the King of Spain. 'He hath demanded Drake's head of me,' she laughed  aloud, 'and here I have a gilded sword to strike it off.' With that she  bade Drake kneel. Then, handing the sword to Marchaumont, the special  envoy of her French suitor, Francis of Anjou, she ordered him to give  the accolade. This done, she pronounced the formula of immemorial fame:  _I bid thee rise, Sir Francis Drake!_          CHAPTER VIII    DRAKE CLIPS THE WINGS OF SPAIN      For three years after Drake had been dubbed Sir Francis by the Queen he  was the hero of every class of Englishmen but two: the extreme Roman  Catholics, who wanted Mary Queen of Scots, and the merchants who were  doing business with Portugal and Spain. The Marian opposition to the  general policy of England persisted for a few years longer. But the  merchants who were the inheritors of centuries of commercial intercourse  with England's new enemies were soon to receive a shock that completely  changed their minds. They were themselves one of the strongest factors  that made for war in the knotty problem now to be solved at the cannon's  mouth because English trade was seeking new outlets in every direction  and was beating hard against every door that foreigners shut in its  face. These merchants would not, however, support the war party till  they were forced to, as they still hoped to gain by other means what  only war could win.    The year that Drake came home (1580) Philip at last got hold of a  sea-going fleet, the eleven big Portuguese galleons taken when Lisbon  fell. With the Portuguese ships, sailors, and oversea possessions, with  more galleons under construction at Santander in Spain, and with the  galleons of the Indian Guard built by the great Menendez to protect New  Spain: with all this performed or promised, Philip began to feel as if  the hour was at hand when he could do to England what she had done to  him.    In 1583 Santa Cruz, the best Spanish admiral since the death of  Menendez, proposed to form the nucleus of the Great Armada out of the  fleet with which he had just broken down the last vestige of Portuguese  resistance in the Azores. From that day on, the idea was never dropped.  At the same time Elizabeth discovered the Paris Plot between Mary and  Philip and the Catholics of France, all of whom were bent on her  destruction. England stood to arms. But false ideas of naval defence  were uppermost in the Queen's Council. No attempt was made to strike a  concentrated blow at the heart of the enemy's fleet in his own waters.  Instead of this the English ships were carefully divided among the three  squadrons meant to defend the approaches to England, Ireland, and  Scotland, because, as the Queen-in-Council sagely remarked, who could be  expected to know what the enemy's point of attack would be? The fact is  that when wielding the forces of the fleet and army the Queen and most  of her non-combatant councillors never quite reached that supreme point  of view from which the greatest statesmen see exactly where civil  control ends and civilian interference begins. Luckily for England,  their mistakes were once more covered up by a turn of the international  kaleidoscope.    No sooner had the immediate danger of a great combined attack on England  passed away than Elizabeth returned to Drake's plan for a regular raid  against New Spain, though it had to be one that was not designed to  bring on war in Europe. Drake, who was a member of the Navy Board  charged with the reorganization of the fleet, was to have command. The  ships and men were ready. But the time had not yet come.    Next year (1584) Amadas and Barlow, Sir Walter Raleigh's two prospectors  for the 'plantation' of Virginia, were being delighted with the summer  lands and waters of what is now North Carolina.

It is not that  civilian love for the constitution, for this is absolutely incapable  of such action if it is founded on reason only.    Whatever may be the outcome, since governance is not unrewarded, some  one will always be found to take charge of it. Let the new ruler even  favor slavery (and in what does slavery consist except in contempt  and suppression of the individuality of a primitive people?), since  advantage may be derived from the life of slaves, from their number,  and even from their welfare, then slavery will be endurable under him  provided he is a calculator to any extent. They will at least always  find life and support. Why, then, should they thus struggle? According  to both of them, it is peace which transcends everything in their  opinion, but this is disturbed only by the continuance of the  struggle. The slave, therefore, puts forth every effort to end it  quickly; he will yield and submit--and why should he not? He never had  a higher purpose, and he has never expected anything more from life  than the continuance of his existence under endurable conditions. The  promise of a life lasting, even here, beyond the duration of earthly  life--this alone is what can inspire him to death for the fatherland.    Thus it has always been. Wheresoever real government has existed,  where serious struggles have been fought out, where victory has been  won against mighty resistance, it has been the promise of eternal  life that governed and fought and conquered. The German Protestants,  formerly mentioned in these addresses, fought with faith in this  promise. Did they not perhaps know that nations might also be governed  with the old faith and be held in legal order, and that a good  livelihood might be found under this faith also? Why, then, did  their princes thus determine upon armed resistance, and why did their  peoples lend themselves to it with enthusiasm? It was heaven and  eternal happiness for which they gladly shed their blood. Yet what  earthly power could then have penetrated into the inmost sanctuary of  their souls and have been able to eradicate the faith which had now  once sprung up within them, and on which alone they based their hope  of salvation? It was not, therefore, their own happiness for which  they struggled--of that they were already assured; it was the  happiness of their children, of their grandchildren still unborn,  and of all posterity. These, too, should be brought up in the same  doctrine which alone seemed to them to bring salvation; they, too,  should share in the salvation which had dawned for them. It was this  hope alone that was threatened by the foe; for that hope, for an order  of things which should bloom above their graves long after they were  dead, they shed their blood thus joyfully. If we grant that they were  not entirely clear to themselves, that in their designation of the  noblest they verbally mistook what was within them, and with their  mouths did injustice to their souls; if we willingly acknowledge that  their confession of faith was not the sole and exclusive means of  attaining heaven beyond the grave--yet, this, at least, is eternally  true that more heaven on this side of the grave, a more courageous and  more joyous lifting of the gaze above the earth, and a freer impulse  of spirit have come through their sacrifice into all the life of  succeeding ages; and the descendants of their opponents, as well as  we ourselves, their own descendants, enjoy the fruits of their labors  unto this day.    In this belief our oldest common ancestors, the parent nation of  civilization, the Teutons whom the Romans called Germans, boldly  opposed the advancing world-dominion of the Romans. Did they not then  see before their eyes the higher bloom of the Roman provinces near  them, the more refined enjoyments in them, and, in addition, laws,  judgment-seats, rods, and axes in superabundance? Were not the Romans  willing enough to allow them to share in all these blessings? Did they  not experience, in the case of several of their own princes who had  allowed themselves to be persuaded that war against such benefactors  of humanity was rebellion, proofs of the lauded Roman clemency,  since Rome adorned these submissive lords with kingly titles, with  generalships in their armies, and with Roman fillets, and gave  them, if, perchance, they had been driven out by their compatriots,  maintenance and a place of refuge in their colonies? Had they no  feeling for the advantages of Roman culture, as, for example, for the  better organization of their armies, in which even an Arminius did  not disdain to learn the trade of war? None of all these ignorances  or negligences is to be charged against them. Their descendents even  adopted the culture of the Romans as soon as they could do it without  loss of their freedom and in so far as it was possible without  impairment of their individuality. Why did they, then, thus struggle  for several generations in sanguinary war, ever renewed with the same  virulence? A Roman author makes their leaders ask \"whether anything  was then left for them except either to assert their freedom or to die  before they became slaves?\" Freedom meant to them that they remained  Germans, that they continued to decide their affairs independently,  in conformity with their national genius, and, likewise in conformity  with this spirit, that they continued to go forward in their  development and transmitted this independence to their posterity;  slavery meant to them all the blessings which the Romans offered them,  because in that case they must be something else than Germans--they  might be half Romans. It is self-evident, they presuppose, that every  one would rather die than become thus, and that a true German can wish  to live only that he may be and remain forever a German and may train  all that belong to him to be Germans also.    They have not all died; they have not seen slavery; they have  bequeathed liberty to their children. All the modern world owes it to  their stubborn resistance that it exists as it does. If the Romans had  succeeded in subjugating them also and, as the Roman everywhere did,  in eradicating them as a nation, then the entire future development of  mankind would have taken a direction that we cannot imagine would  have been more pleasant. We, the immediate heirs of their land, their  language, and their thought, owe it to them that we be still Germans,  that the stream of primitive and independent life still bear us on;  to them we owe everything that we have since become as a nation; and,  unless we have now perhaps come to an end, and unless the last drop  of blood inherited from them is dried up in our veins, we shall owe  to them all that we shall be in the future. Even the other Teutonic  races, among whom are our brethren, and who have now become foreigners  to us, owe to them their existence; when they conquered eternal Rome,  no one of all these nations yet existed; at that time the possibility  of their future origin was simultaneously won in the struggle.    These, and all others in universal history who have been of their type  of thought, have conquered because the eternal inspired them, and thus  this inspiration ever and of necessity prevails over him who is not  inspired. It is not the might of arms nor the fitness of weapons  that wins victories, but the power of the soul. He who sets himself  a limited goal for his sacrifices, and who can dare no further than a  certain point, surrenders resistance as soon as the danger reaches a  crisis where he cannot yield or dodge. He who has set himself no limit  whatsoever, but who hazards everything, even life--the highest  boon that can be lost on earth--never ceases to resist, and, if his  opponent has a more limited goal, he indubitably conquers. A people  that is capable, though it be only in its highest representatives and  leaders, of keeping firmly before its vision independence, the face  from the spirit world, and of being inspired with love for it, as  were our remotest forefathers, surely conquers a people that, like the  Roman armies, is used merely as a tool for foreign dominion and for  the subjugation of independent nations; for the former have everything  to lose, the latter have merely something to gain. But even a whim can  prevail over the mental attitude which regards war as a game of hazard  for temporal gain or loss, and which, even before the game starts, has  fixed the limit of the stake. Think, for example, of a Mohammed--not  the real Mohammed of history, concerning whom I confess that I have  no judgment, but the Mohammed of a distinguished French poet--who  had once become firmly convinced that he was one of the extraordinary  natures who are called to guide the obscure and common folk of earth,  and to whom, in consequence of this first presupposition, all his  whims, however meagre and limited they may really be, must necessarily  appear to be great, exalted and inspiring ideas because they are his  own, while everything that opposes them must seem obscure, common  folk, enemies of their own weal, evil-minded, and hateful. Such a man,  in order to justify this self-conceit to himself as a divine vocation,  and entirely absorbed in this thought, must stake everything upon it,  nor can he rest until he has trampled under foot all that will not  think as highly of him as he does himself, or until his own belief in  his divine mission is reflected from the whole contemporary world. I  shall not say what would be his fortunes in case a spiritual vision  that is true and clear within itself should actually come against  him on the field of battle, but he certainly wins from those limited  gamblers, for he hazards everything against those who"]]]
