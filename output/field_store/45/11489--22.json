He had not only remarkable natural talent, but came  of a family of ardent musicians, who devoted themselves to his  education. At five years of age he was nourished on the orchestral score  of _Don Juan_;[114] as a little boy        \"De dix ans, delicat, frele, le teint jaunet,      Mais confiant, naif, plein d'ardeur et de joie,\"[115]    he \"measured himself against Beethoven and Mozart\" by playing in a  public concert; at sixteen years of age he wrote his _Premiere  Symphonie_. As he grew older he soaked himself in the music of Bach and  Haendel, and was able to compose at will after the manner of Rossini,  Verdi, Schumann, and Wagner.[116] He has written excellent music in all  styles--the Grecian style, and that of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and  eighteenth centuries. His compositions are of every kind: masses, grand  operas, light operas, cantatas, symphonies, symphonic poems; music for  the orchestra, the organ, the piano, the voice, and chamber music. He is  the learned editor of Gluck and Rameau; and is thus not only an artist,  but an artist who can talk about his art. He is an unusual figure in  France--one would have thought rather to find his home in Germany.    [Footnote 114: C. Saint-Saens, _Charles Gounod et le Don Juan de  Mozart_, 1894.]    [Footnote 115:        But ten years old, slightly built and pale,      Yet full of simple confidence and joy (_Rimes familieres_).    ]    [Footnote 116: Charles Gounod, _Memoires d'un Artiste_, 1896.]    In Germany, however, they make no mistake about him. There, the name of  Camille Saint-Saens stands for the French classical spirit, and is  thought worthiest to represent us in music from the time of Berlioz  until the appearance of the young school of Cesar Franck--though Franck  himself is as yet little known in Germany. M. Saint-Saens possesses,  indeed, some of the best qualities of a French artist, and among them  the most important quality of all--perfect clearness of conception. It  is remarkable how little this learned artist is bothered by his  learning, and how free he is from all pedantry. Pedantry is the plague  of German art, and the greatest men have not escaped it. I am not  speaking of Brahms, who was ravaged with it, but of delightful geniuses  like Schumann, or of powerful ones like Bach. \"This unnatural art  wearies one like the sanctimonious salon of some little provincial town;  it stifles one, it is enough to kill one.\"[117] \"Saint-Saens is not a  pedant,\" wrote Gounod; \"he has remained too much of a child and become  too clever for that.\" Besides, he has always been too much of a  Frenchman.    [Footnote 117: Quoted from Saint-Saens by Edmond Hippeau in _Henry VIII  et L'Opera francais_, 1883. M. Saint-Saens speaks elsewhere of \"these  works, well written, but heavy and unattractive, and reflecting in a  tiresome way the narrow and pedantic spirit of certain little towns in  Germany\" (_Harmonie et Melodie_).]    Sometimes Saint-Saens reminds me of one of our eighteenth-century  writers. Not a writer of the _Encyclopedie_, nor one of Rousseau's camp,  but rather of Voltaire's school. He has a clearness of thought, an  elegance and precision of expression, and a quality of mind that make  his music \"not only noble, but very noble, as coming of a fine race and  distinguished family.\"[118]    He has also excellent discernment, of an unemotional kind; and he is  \"calm in spirit, restrained in imagination, and keeps his self-control  even in the midst of the most disturbing emotions.\"[119] This  discernment is the enemy of anything approaching obscurity of thought or  mysticism; and its outcome was that curious book, _Problemes et  Mysteres_--a misleading title, for the spirit of reason reigns there and  makes an appeal to young people to protect \"the light of a menaced  world\" against \"the mists of the North, Scandinavian gods, Indian  divinities, Catholic miracles, Lourdes, spiritualism, occultism, and  obscurantism.\"[120]    His love and need of liberty is also of the eighteenth century. One may  say that liberty is his only passion. \"I am passionately fond of  liberty,\" he wrote.[121]    [Footnote 118: Charles Gounod, _\"Ascanio\" de Saint-Saens_, 1890.]    [Footnote 119: _Id., ibid._]    [Footnote 120: C. Saint-Saens, _Problemes et Mysteres_, 1894.]    [Footnote 121: _Harmonie et Melodie_.]    And he has proved it by the absolute fearlessness of his judgments on  art; for not only has he reasoned soundly against Wagner, but dared to  criticise the weaknesses of Gluck and Mozart, the errors of Weber and  Berlioz, and the accepted opinions about Gounod; and this classicist,  who was nourished on Bach, goes so far as to say: \"The performance of  works by Bach and Haendel to-day is an idle amusement,\" and that those  who wish to revive their art are like \"people who would live in an old  mansion that has been uninhabited for centuries.\"[122] He went even  further; he criticised his own work and contradicted his own opinions.  His love of liberty made him form, at different periods, different  opinions of the same work. He thought that people had a right to change  their opinions, as sometimes they deceived themselves. It seemed to him  better boldly to admit an error than to be the slave of consistency. And  this same feeling showed itself in other matters besides art: in ethics,  as is shown by some verses which he addressed to a young friend, urging  him not to be bound by a too rigid austerity:        \"Je sens qu'une triste chimere      A toujours assombri ton ame: la Vertu....\"[123]    and in metaphysics also, where he judges religions, faith, and the  Gospels with a quiet freedom of thought, seeking in Nature alone the  basis of morals and society.    [Footnote 122: C. Saint-Saens, _Portraits et Souvenirs_, 1900.]    [Footnote 123:        I know that a vain dream of virtue      Has always cast a shadow on your soul (_Rimes familieres_).  ]    Here are some of his opinions, taken at random from _Problemes et  Mysteres_:         \"As science advances, God recedes.\"         \"The soul is only a medium for the expression of thought.\"         \"The discouragement of work, the weakening of character, the       sharing of one's goods under pain of death--this is the Gospel       teaching on the foundation of society.\"         \"The Christian virtues are not social virtues.\"         \"Nature is without aim: she is an endless circle, and leads us       nowhere.\"    His thoughts are unfettered and full of love for humanity and a sense of  the responsibility of the individual. He called Beethoven \"the greatest,  the only really great artist,\" because he upheld the idea of universal  brotherhood. His mind is so comprehensive that he has written books on  philosophy, on the theatre, on classical painting,[124] as well as  scientific essays,[125] volumes of verse, and even plays.[126]    [Footnote 124: C. Saint-Saens, _Note sur les decors de theatre dans  l'antiquite romaine_, 1880, where he discusses the mural paintings of  Pompeii.]    [Footnote 125: Lecture on the Phenomena of Mirages, given to the  Astronomical Society of France in 1905.]    [Footnote 126: C. Saint-Saens, _La Crampe des Ecrivains_, a comedy in  one act, 1892.]    He has been able to take up all sorts of things, I will not say with  equal skill, but with discernment and undeniable ability. He shows a  type of mind rare among artists and, above all, among musicians. The two  principles that he enunciates and himself follows out are: \"Keep free  from all exaggeration\" and \"Preserve the soundness of your mind's  health.\"[127] They are certainly not the principles of a Beethoven or a  Wagner, and it would be rather difficult to find a noted musician of the  last century who had applied them. They tell us, without need of  comment, what is distinctive about M. Saint-Saens, and what is defective  in him. He is not troubled by any sort of passion. Nothing disturbs the  clearness of his reason. \"He has no prejudices; he takes no  side\"[128]--one might add, not even his own, since he is not afraid to  change his views--\"he does not pose as a reformer of anything\"; he is  altogether independent, perhaps almost too much so. He seems sometimes  as if he did not know what to do with his liberty. Goethe would have  said, I think, that he needed a little more of the devil in him.    [Footnote 127: _Harmonie et Melodie_.]    [Footnote 128: Charles Gounod, _Memoires d'un Artiste_.]    His most characteristic mental trait seems to be a languid melancholy,  which has its source in a rather bitter feeling of the futility of  life;[129] and this is accompanied by fits of weariness which are not  altogether healthy, followed by capricious moods and nervous gaiety, and  a freakish liking for burlesque and mimicry. It is his eager, restless  spirit that makes him rush about the world writing Breton and Auvergnian  rhapsodies, Persian songs, Algerian suites, Portuguese barcarolles,  Danish, Russian, or Arabian caprices, souvenirs of Italy, African  fantasias, and Egyptian concertos; and, in the same way, he roams  through the ages, writing Greek tragedies, dance music of the sixteenth  and seventeenth centuries, and preludes and fugues of the eighteenth.  But in all these exotic and archaic reflections of times and countries  through which his fancy wanders, one recognises the gay, intelligent  countenance of a Frenchman on his travels, who idly follows his  inclinations, and does not trouble to enter very deeply into the spirit  of the people he meets, but gleans all he can, and then reproduces it  with a French complexion--after the manner of Montaigne in Italy, who  compared Verona to Poitiers, and Padua to Bordeaux, and who, when he was  in Florence, paid much less attention to Michelangelo than to \"a very  strangely shaped sheep, and an animal the size of a large mastiff,  shaped like a cat and striped with black and white, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16469"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume II. (#18)"],[1,"with, and was preferred  to two livings, both in the gift of the College, one of which was  happily situated near Oxford.    Much about this time King Charles I. was obliged to keep his court at  Oxford, to avoid being exposed to the resentment of the populace in  London, where tumults then prevailed, and Mr. Main was made choice of,  amongst others, to preach before his Majesty. Soon after he was  created doctor of divinity, and resided at Oxford, till the time of  the mock visitation, sent to the university, when, amongst a great  many others, equally distinguished for their loyalty and zeal for that  unfortunate Monarch, he was ejected from the college, and stript of  both his livings. During the rage of the civil war, he was patronized  by the earl of Devonshire, at whose house he resided till the  restoration of Charles II. when he was not only put in possession of  his former places, but made canon of Christ's Church, and arch-deacon  of Chichester, which preferments he enjoyed till his death. He was an  orthodox preacher, a man of severe virtue, a ready and facetious wit.  In his younger years he addicted himself to poetry, and produced two  plays, which were held in some esteem in his own time; but as they  have never been revived, nor taken notice of by any of our critics, in  all probability they are but second rate performances.    The Amorous War. a Tragedy, printed in 4to. Oxon. 1658.    The City Match, a Comedy, acted before the King and Queen in  Whitehall, and afterwards on the stage in Black Fryars, with great  applause, and printed in 4to. Oxon. 1658. These two plays have been  printed in folio, 4to, and 8vo. and are bound together.    Besides these dramatic pieces, our author wrote a Poem upon the Naval  Victory over the Dutch by the Duke of York, a subject which Dryden has  likewise celebrated in his Annus Mirabilis. He published a translation  of part of Lucian, said to be done by Mr. Francis Hicks, to which he  added some dialogues of his own, though Winstanley is of opinion, that  the whole translation is also his. In the year 1646, --47, --52, --62,  he published several sermons, and entered into a controversy with the  famous Presbyterian leader, Mr. Francis Cheynel, and his Sermon  against False Prophets was particularly levelled at him. Cheynel's  Life is written by a gentleman of great eminence in literature, and  published in some of the latter numbers of of the Student, in which  the character of that celebrated teacher is fully displayed. Dr. Main  likewise published in the year 1647 a book called The People's War  examined according to the Principles of Scripture and Reason, which he  wrote at the desire of a person of quality. He also translated Dr.  Donne's Latin Epigrams into English, and published them under the  title of, A Sheaf of Epigrams.    On the 6th of December, 1642, he died, and his remains were deposited  on the North side of the choir in Christ's Church. In his will he left  several legacies for pious uses: fifty pounds for the rebuilding of  St. Paul's; a hundred pounds to be distributed by the two vicars of  Cassington and Burton, for the use of the poor in those parishes, with  many other legacies.    He was a man of a very singular turn of humour, and though, without  the abilities, bore some resemblance to the famous dean of St.  Patrick's, and perhaps was not so subject to those capricious whims  which produced so much uneasiness to all who attended upon dean Swift.  It is said of Dr. Main, that his propension to innocent raillery was  so great, that it kept him company even after death. Among other  legacies, he bequeathed to an old servant an old trunk, and somewhat  in it, as he said, that would make him drink: no sooner did the Dr.  expire, than the servant, full of expectation, visited the trunk, in  hopes of finding some money, or other treasure left him by his master,  and to his great disappointment, the legacy, with which he had filled  his imagination, proved no other than a Red Herring.    The ecclesiastical works of our author are as follow,    1. A Sermon concerning Unity and Agreement, preached at Carfax Church  in Oxford, August 9, 1646. 1 Cor. i. 10.    2. A Sermon against False Prophets, preached in St. Mary's Church in  Oxford, shortly after the surrender of that garrison, printed in 1697.  Ezek. xxii. 28. He afterwards published a Vindication of this Sermon  from the aspersions of Mr. Cheynel.    3. A Sermon preached at the Consecration of the Right Reverend Father  in God, Herbert, Lord Bishop of Hereford, 1662. 1 Tim. iv. 14.    4. Concio ad Academiam Oxoniensem, pro more habita inchoante Jermino,  Maii 27, 1662.    As a specimen of his poetry, we present a copy of verses addressed to  Ben Johnson.

A tavern in Bread-street.                    *        *        *        *        *                                       JOHN MILTON.      The British nation, which has produced the greatest men in every  profession, before the appearance of Milton could not enter into any  competition with antiquity, with regard to the sublime excellencies of  poetry. Greece could boast an Euripides, Eschylus, Sophocles and  Sappho; England was proud of her Shakespear, Spenser, Johnson and  Fletcher; but then the ancients had still a poet in reserve superior  to the rest, who stood unrivalled by all succeeding times, and in epic  poetry, which is justly esteemed the highest effort of genius, Homer  had no rival. When Milton appeared, the pride of Greece was humbled,  the competition became more equal, and since Paradise Lost is ours; it  would, perhaps, be an injury to our national fame to yield the palm to  any state, whether ancient or modern.    The author of this astonishing work had something very singular in his  life, as if he had been marked out by Heaven to be the wonder of every  age, in all points of view in which he can be considered. He lived in  the times of general confusion; he was engaged in the factions of  state, and the cause he thought proper to espouse, he maintained with  unshaken firmness; he struggled to the last for what he was persuaded  were the rights of humanity; he had a passion for civil liberty, and  he embarked in the support of it, heedless of every consideration of  danger; he exposed his fortune to the vicissitudes of party  contention, and he exerted his genius in writing for the cause he  favoured.    There is no life, to which it is more difficult to do justice, and at  the same time avoid giving offence, than Milton's, there are some who  have considered him as a regicide, others have extolled him as a  patriot, and a friend to mankind: Party-rage seldom knows any bounds,  and differing factions have praised or blamed him, according to their  principles of religion, and political opinions.    In the course of this life, a dispassionate regard to truth, and an  inviolable candour shall be observed. Milton was not without a share  of those failings which are inseparable from human nature; those  errors sometimes exposed him to censure, and they ought not to pass  unnoticed; on the other hand, the apparent sincerity of his  intentions, and the amazing force of his genius, naturally produce an  extream tenderness for the faults with which his life is chequered:  and as in any man's conduct fewer errors are seldom found, so no man's  parts ever gave him a greater right to indulgence.    The author of Paradise Lost was descended of an ancient family of that  name at Milton, near Abingdon in Oxfordshire. He was the son of John  Milton a money-scrivener, and born the 9th of December, 1608. The  family from which he descended had been long seated there, as appears  by the monuments still to be seen in the church of Milton, 'till one  of them, having taken the unfortunate side in the contests between the  houses of York and Lancaster, was deprived of all his estate, except  what he held by his wife[1]. Our author's grandfather, whose name was  John Milton, was under-ranger, or reaper of the forest of Shotover,  near Halton in Oxfordshire: but a man of Milton's genius needs not  have the circumstance of birth called in to render him illustrious; he  reflects the highest honour upon his family, which receives from him  more glory, than the longest descent of years can give. Milton was  both educated under a domestic tutor, and likewise at St. Paul's  school under Mr. Alexander Gill, where he made, by his indefatigable  application, an extraordinary progress in learning. From his 12th year  he generally sat up all night at his studies, which, accompanied with  frequent head-aches, proved very prejudicial to his eyes. In the year  1625 he was entered into Christ's College in Cambridge, under the  tuition of Mr. William Chappel, afterwards bishop of Ross in Ireland,  and even before that time, had distinguished himself by several Latin  and English poems[2]. After he had taken the degree of master of arts,  in 1632 he left the university, and for the space of five years lived  with his parents at their house at Horton, near Colebrook in  Buckinghamshire, where his father having acquired a competent fortune,  thought proper to retire, and spend the remainder of his days. In the  year 1634 he wrote his Masque of Comus, performed at Ludlow Castle,"]]]
