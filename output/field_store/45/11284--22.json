The crowd called out \"Put down the stakes:\" so each side produced  the money and publicly announced that the owner of the animal which  should be victorious should take all the stakes. But the oilman  objected to the mahout's riding the elephant; no one was going to ride  his bullock. This was seen to be fair and the mahout had to get off;  then the fight began. The bullock snorted and blew through its nose,  and ran at the elephant with its head lowered. Then the elephant also  rushed forward but the bullock stood its ground and stamped; at this  the elephant turned tail and ran away; the bullock ran after it and  gored it from behind until it trumpeted with pain. The crowd shouted  \"The Raja's elephant is beaten.\" And the oilman took the five hundred  rupees and they all went home. From that day the oilman no longer put  the bullock to work the oil mill but fed it well and left it free to  go where it liked. But the bullock only stayed on with him for one  month and then died.          XXV. How Sabai Grass Grew.    Once upon a time there were seven brothers who had an only  sister. These brothers undertook the excavation of a large tank;  but although they spent large sums and dug very deep they could not  reach water and the tank remained dry.    One day as they were consulting what to do to get the tank to fill,  they saw a Jogi corning towards them with a lota in his hand; they at  once called to him to come and advise them, for they thought that,  as he spent his time wandering from country to country, he might  somewhere have learned some thing which would be of use to them. All  the Jogi said to them was \"You have a sister: if you sacrifice her,  the tank will fill with water.\" The brothers were fond of the girl,  but in their despair at seeing their labour wasted they agreed to give  the advice of the Jogi a trial. So they told their mother the next day  that, when their sister brought them out their midday meal, she was  to be dressed in her best and carry the rice in a new basket and must  bring a new water pot to draw their water in. At midday the girl went  down to her brothers with her best cloth and all her jewellery on; and  when they saw their victim coming they could not keep from tears. She  asked them what they were grieving for; they told her that nothing was  the matter and sent her to draw water in her new water-pot from the  dry tank. Directly the girl drew near to the bank the water began to  bubble up from the bottom; and when she went down to the water's edge  it rose to her instep. She bent down to fill her pot but the pot would  not fill though the water rose higher and higher; then she sang:--          \"The water has risen, brother,      And wetted my ankle, brother,      But still the _lota_ in my hand      Will not sink below the surface.\"      But the water rose to her knees and the pot would not fill, and  she sang:--          \"The water has risen, brother,      And wetted my knees, brother,      But still the lota in my hand      Will not sink below the surface.\"      Then the water rose to her waist and the pot would not fill, and  she sang:--          \"The water has risen, brother,      And wetted my waist, brother,      But still the lota in my hand      Will not sink below the surface.\"      Then the water reached her neck and the pot would not fill; and  she sang:--          The water has risen, brother,      And wetted my neck, brother,      But still the lota in my hand      Will not sink below the surface.\"      At last it flowed over her head and the water-pot was filled, but the  girl was drowned. The tank however remained brimful of sparkling water.    Now the unhappy girl had been betrothed and her wedding day was just  at hand. On the day fixed the marriage broker came to announce the  approach of the bridegroom; who shortly afterwards arrived at the  outskirts of the village in his palki. The seven brothers met him,  and the usual dancing began.    The bridegroom's party however wished to know why the bride did not  appear. The brothers put them off with various excuses, saying that  the girl had gone with her friends to gather firewood or to the river  to draw water. At last the bridegroom's party got tired of waiting  and turned to go home in great wrath at the way in which they had  been treated. On their way they passed by the tank in which the girl  had been sacrificed and, growing in the middle of it, they saw a most  beautiful flower. The bridegroom at once determined to possess this,  and he told his drummers to pick it for him; but whenever one of them  tried to pick it, the flower moved out of his reach and a voice came  from the flower saying:--          \"Take the flower, drummer,      But the branch you must not break.\"      and when they told him what the flower sang the bridegroom said that  he would try and pick it himself; no sooner had he reached the bank  than the flower of its own accord floated towards him and he pulled it  up by the roots and took it with him into the palki. After they had  gone a little way the palki bearers felt the palki strangely heavy:  and when they looked in they found the bride also sitting in it,  dressed in yellow garments; for the flower was really the girl who  had been drowned.    So they joyfully took the happy couple with drumming and music to  the bridegroom's house.    In a short time misfortune befel the seven brothers; they fell into  the deepest poverty and were forced to earn what they could by selling  leaves and sticks which they gathered in the jungle. As they went about  selling these, they one day came to the village where their sister  was living and as they cried their wares through the streets they were  told to go to the house where the marriage had taken place. They went  there, and as they were selling their leaf plates their sister saw  and recognised them; they had only ragged loincloths on, and their  skins were black and cracked like a crocodile's.    At the sight their sister began to cry. Her friends asked what was  the matter and she said a straw from the thatch had run into her eye,  so they pulled down some of the thatch; she still went on crying and  they again asked what was wrong; she said that she had knocked her  foot against a stone in the ground; so they dug up the stone and threw  it away. But she still went on weeping and at last confessed that the  miserable-looking leaf-sellers were her brothers. Then her husband's  parents told her to be comforted, and they gave the brothers oil and  bade them go and bathe and oil their bodies: but the brothers were  so hungry that when they got to the bathing place they drank the oil  and ate the oil cake that had been given to them; and came back with  their skins as rough as when they went. So then they were given more  oil and some of the household went with them and made them bathe and  oil themselves properly and then brought them to the house and gave  them new clothes and made them a feast of meat and rice. According to  the custom of the country they were made to sit down in order of age  and were helped in that order; when they had all been helped and had  eaten, their sister said to them \"Now brothers you come running to  me for food, and yet you sacrificed me in the tank.\" Then they were  overwhelmed with shame: they looked up at the sky but there was no  escape there; they looked down at the earth; and the earth split open  and they all ran into the chasm. The sister tried to catch the youngest  brother by the hair and pull him out, calling \"Come back, brother,  come back brother, you shall carry my baby about for me!\" but his  hair came off in her hand and the earth swallowed them all up. Their  sister planted the hair in a corner of the garden and it is said that  from that human hair, _sabai_ grass originated.          XXVI. The Merchant's Son and the Raja's Daughter.    Once a merchant's wife and a Raja's wife were both with child and one  day as they bathed together they fell into conversation, and they  agreed that if they both bore daughters then the girls should be  \"flower friends\" while if one had a son and one a daughter then the  children should marry: and they committed the agreement to writing. A  month or two later the Raja's wife bore a daughter and the merchant's  wife a son. When the children grew up a bit they were sent to school,  and as they were both very intelligent they soon learnt to read and  write. At the school the boys used to be taught in an upstairs room  and the girls on the ground floor. One day the boy wrote out a copy  of the agreement which their mothers had made and threw It down to  the girl who was below.    She read it and from that day they began to correspond with each other;  love soon followed and they decided to elope. They fixed a day and  they arranged that the boy should wait for the girl under a _turu_  tree outside the town. When the evening came the girl made haste to  cook her parents' supper and then, when they went to bed, she had  as usual to soothe them to sleep by rubbing their limbs; all this  took a long time and the merchant's son soon got tired of waiting,  so he sang to the tree:--          \"Be witness be witness for me 'Turu tree'      When the Raja's daughter comes.\"      and so singing he tied his horse to the roots of the tree and himself  climbed up into the branches, and sitting in the tree he pulled off  and threw down a number of twigs. Late at night the Raja's daughter  came; she saw the horse tied and the twigs scattered on the ground,  but no other sign of her lover. And at last she got tired of waiting  and called the _Turu_ tree to witness, singing:--          \"Be witness be witness for me 'Turu tree'      When the merchant's son comes.\"      As she finished her song the merchant's son threw down a large branch  to her, so she looked up and saw him sitting in the tree. Then she  climbed up to him and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11951"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 1 (#18)"],[1,"cus; that comes to me from Agrippa; this vase is Egyptian, it was  Antony's, Augustus took it at the battle of Actium.\"  The imperial sales  were succeeded by literary games, at which the losers had to pay the  expenses of the prizes, and celebrate, in verse or prose, the praises of  the winners; and if their compositions were pronounced bad, they were  bound to wipe them out with a sponge or even with their tongues, unless  they preferred to be beaten with a rod or soused in the Rhone.  One day,  when Caligula, in the character of Jupiter, was seated at his tribunal  and delivering oracles in the middle of the public thoroughfare, a man of  the people remained motionless in front of him, with eyes of astonishment  fixed upon him.  \"What seem I to thee?\" asked the emperor, flattered, no  doubt, by this attention of the mob.  \"A great monstrosity,\" answered the  Gaul.  And that, at the end of about four years, was the universal cry:  and against a mad emperor the only resource of the Roman world was at  that time assassination.  The captain of Caligula's guards rid Rome and  the provinces of him.    He did just one sensible and useful thing during the whole of his stay in  Gaul: he had a light-house constructed to illumine the passage between  Gaul and Great Britain.  Some traces of it, they say, have been  discovered.    His successor, Claudius, brother of the great Germanicus, and married to  his own niece, the second Agrippina, was, as has been already stated,  born at Lyons, at the very moment when his father, Drusus, was  celebrating there the erection of an altar to Augustus.  During his whole  reign he showed to the city of his birth the most lively good-will, and  the constant aim as well as principal result of this good-will was to  render the city of Lyons more and more Roman by effacing all Gallic  characteristics and memories.  She was endowed with Roman rights,  monuments, and names, the most important or the most ostentatious; she  became the colony supereminently, the great municipal town of the Gauls,  the Claudian town; but she lost what had remained of her old municipal  government, that is of her administrative and commercial independence.  Nor was she the only one in Gaul to experience the good-will of Claudius.  This emperor, the mark of scorn from his infancy, whom his mother,  Antonia, called \"a shadow of a man, an unfinished sketch of nature's  drawing,\" and of whom his grand-uncle, Augustus, used to say, \"We shall  be forever in doubt, without any certainty of knowing whether he be or be  not equal to public duties,\" Claudius, the most feeble indeed of the  Caesars, in body, mind, and character, was nevertheless he who had  intermittent glimpses of the most elevated ideas and the most righteous  sentiments, and who strove the most sincerely to make them take the form  of deeds.  He undertook to assure to all free men of \"long-haired\" Gaul  the same Roman privileges that were enjoyed by the inhabitants of Lyons;  and amongst others, that of entering the senate of Rome and holding the  great public offices.  He made a formal proposal to that effect to the  senate, and succeeded, not without difficulty, in getting it adopted.  The speech that he delivered on this occasion has been to a great extent  preserved to us, not only in the summary given by Tacitus, but also in an  inscription on a bronze tablet, which split into many fragments at the  time of the destruction of the building in which it was placed.  The two  principal fragments were discovered at Lyons, in 1528, and they are now  deposited in the Museum of that city.  They fully confirm the most  equitable, and, it may be readily allowed, the most liberal act of policy  that emanated from the earlier Roman emperors.  \"Claudius had taken it  into his head,\" says Seneca, \"to see all Greeks, Gauls, Spaniards, and  Britons clad in the toga.\"  But at the same time he took great care to  spread everywhere the Latin tongue, and to make it take the place of the  different national idioms.  A Roman citizen, originally of Asia Minor,  and sent on a deputation to Rome by his compatriots, could not answer in  Latin the emperor's questions.  Claudius took away his privileges,  saying, \"He is no Roman citizen who is ignorant of the language of Rome.\"    Claudius, however, was neither liberal nor humane towards a notable  portion of the Gallic populations, to wit, the Druids.  During his stay  in Gaul he proscribed them and persecuted them without intermission;  forbidding, under pain of death, their form of worship and every exterior  sign of their ceremonies.  He drove them away and pursued them even into  Great Britain, whither he conducted, A.D. 43, a military expedition,  almost the only one of his reign, save the continued struggle of his  lieutenants on the Rhine against the Germans.  It was evidently amongst  the corporation of Druids and under the influence of religious creeds and  traditions, that there was still pursued and harbored some of the old  Gallic spirit, some passion for national independence, and some hatred of  the Roman yoke.  In proportion as Claudius had been popular in Gaul did  his adopted son and successor, Nero, quickly become hated.  There is  nothing to show that he even went thither, either on the business of  government or to obtain the momentary access of favor always excited in  the mob by the presence and prestige of power.  It was towards Greece and  the East that a tendency was shown in the tastes and trips of Nero,  imperial poet, musician, and actor.  L. Verus, one of the military  commandants in Belgica, had conceived a project of a canal to unite the  Moselle to the Saone, and so the Mediterranean to the ocean; but  intrigues in the province and the palace prevented its execution, and in  the place of public works useful to Gaul, Nero caused a new census to be  made of the population whom he required to squeeze to pay for his  extravagance.  It was in his reign, as is well known, that a fierce fire  consumed a great part of Rome and her monuments.  The majority of  historians accuse Nero of having himself been the cause of it; but at any  rate he looked on with cynical indifference, as if amused at so grand a  spectacle, and taking pleasure in comparing it to the burning of Troy.  He did more: he profited by it so far as to have built for himself, free  of expense, that magnificent palace called \"The Palace of Gold,\" of which  he said, when he saw it completed, \"At last I am going to be housed as a  man should be.\"  Five years before the burning of Rome, Lyons had been a  prey to a similar scourge, and Seneca wrote to his friend Lucilius,  \"Lugdunum, which was one of the show-places of Gaul, is sought for in  vain to-day; a single night sufficed for the disappearance of a vast  city; it perished in less time than I take to tell the tale.\"  Nero gave  upwards of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars towards the  reconstruction of Lyons, a gift that gained him the city's gratitude,  which was manifested, it is said, when his fall became imminent.  It was,  however, J. Vindex, a Gaul of Vienne, governor of the Lyonnese province,  who was the instigator of the insurrection which was fatal to Nero, and  which put Galba in his place.    When Nero was dead there was no other Caesar, no naturally indicated  successor to the empire.  The influence of the name of Caesar had spent  itself in the crimes, madnesses, and incapacity of his descendants.  Then  began a general search for emperors; and the ambition to be created  spread abroad amongst the men of note in the Roman world.  During the  eighteen months that followed the death of Nero, three pretenders--Galba,  Otho, and Vitellius--ran this formidable risk.  Galba was a worthy old  Roman senator, who frankly said, \"If the vast body of the empire could be  kept standing in equilibrium without a head, I were worthy of the chief  place in the state.\"  Otho and Vitellius were two epicures, both indolent  and debauched, the former after an elegant, and the latter after a  beastly fashion.  Galba was raised to the purple by the Lyonnese and  Narbonnese provinces, Vitellius by the legions cantoned in the Belgic  province: to such an extent did Gaul already influence the destinies of  Rome.  All three met disgrace and death within the space of eighteen  months; and the search for an emperor took a turn towards the East, where  the command was held by Vespasian (Titus Flavius Vespasianus, of Rieti in  the duchy of Spoleto), a general sprung from a humble Italian family, who  had won great military distinction, and who, having been proclaimed first  at Alexandria, in Judea, and at Antioch, did not arrive until many  months afterwards at Rome, where he commenced the twenty-six years' reign  of the Flavian family.    Neither Vespasian nor his sons, Titus and Domitian, visited Gaul, as  their predecessors had.  Domitian alone put in a short appearance.  The  eastern provinces of the empire and the wars on the frontier of the  Danube, towards which the invasions of the Germans were at that time  beginning to be directed, absorbed the attention of the new emperors.  Gaul was far, however, from remaining docile and peaceful at this epoch.  At the vacancy that occurred after Nero and amid the claims of various  pretenders, the authority of the Roman name and the pressure of the  imperial power diminished rapidly; and the memory and desire of  independence were reawakened.  In Belgica the German peoplets, who had  been allowed to settle on the left bank of the Rhine, were very  imperfectly subdued, and kept up close communication with the independent  peoplets of the right bank.  The eight Roman legions cantoned in that  province were themselves much changed; many barbarians had been enlisted  amongst them, and did gallant service; but they were indifferent, and  always ready for a new master and a new country.  There were not wanting  symptoms, soon followed by"]]]
