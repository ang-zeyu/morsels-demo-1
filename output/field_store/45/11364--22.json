I had no idea of his death; we all loved  the handsome young man, and by his description of you were already  much interested in you before we had ever seen you.\"    The conversation now turned entirely on Hallberg. Edward related the  particulars of his death. Every one present had something to say in  his praise; and although this sudden allusion to his dearest friend  had agitated Edward in no slight degree, yet it was a consolation to  him to listen to the tribute these worthy people paid to the memory of  Ferdinand, and to see how genuine was their regret at the tidings of  his early death. The time passed swiftly away in conversation of much  interest, and the whole company were surprised to hear ten o'clock  strike, an unusually late hour for this quiet, regular family. The  chaplain read prayers, in which Edward devoutly joined, and then  he kissed the matron's hand, and felt almost as if he were in his  father's house. The Baron offered to show his guest to his room, and  the servant preceded them with lights. The way led past the staircase,  and then on one side into a long gallery, which communicated with  another wing of the castle.    The high-vaulted ceilings, the curious carving on the ponderous  doorways, the pointed gothic windows, through many broken panes of  which a sharp nightwind whistled, proved to Edward that he was in the  old part of the castle, and that the famous chamber could not be far  off.    \"Would it be possible for me to be quartered there,\" he began, rather  timidly; \"I should like it of all things.\"    \"Really!\" inquired the Baron, rather surprised; \"have not our ghost  stories alarmed you?\"    \"On the contrary,\" was the reply, \"they have excited the most earnest  wish--\"    \"Then, if that be the case,\" said the Baron, \"we will return. The room  was already prepared for you, being the most comfortable and the best  in the whole wing; only I fancied, after our conversation--\"    \"Oh, certainly not,\" exclaimed Edward; \"I could only long for such  dreams.\"    During this discourse they had arrived at the door of the famous room.  They went in. They found themselves in a lofty and spacious apartment,  so large that the two candles which the servant carried only shed a  glimmering twilight over it, which did not penetrate to the furthest  corner. A high-canopied bed, hung with costly but old-fashioned  damask, of dark green, in which were swelling pillows of snowy  whiteness, tied with green bows, and a silk coverlet of the same  color, looked very inviting to the tired traveler. Sofa and chairs  of faded needlework, a carved oak commode and table, a looking-glass  in heavy framework, a prie-dieu and crucifix above it, constituted  the furniture of the room, where, above all things, cleanliness and  comfort preponderated, while a good deal of silver plate was spread  out on the toilet-table.    Edward looked round. \"A beautiful room!\" he said. \"Answer me one  question, Baron, if you please. Did he ever sleep here?\"    \"Certainly,\" replied Friedenberg; \"it was his usual room when he  was here, and he had a most curious dream in that bed, which, as he  assured us, made a great impression on him.\"    \"And what was it?\" inquired Edward.    \"He never told us, for, as you well know, he was reserved by nature;  but we gathered from some words that he let slip, that an early and  sudden death was foretold. Alas! your narrative has confirmed the  truth of the prediction.\"    \"Wonderful! He always had a similar foreboding, and many a time has  he grieved me by alluding to it,\" said Edward; \"yet it never made  him gloomy or discontented. He went on his way firmly and calmly, and  looked forward with joy, I might almost say, to another life.\"    \"He was a superior man,\" answered the Baron. \"whose memory will ever  be dear to us. But now I will detain you no longer. Good night. Here  is the bell\"--he showed him the cord in between the curtains--\"and  your servant sleeps in the next room.\"    \"Oh, you are too careful of me,\" said Edward, smiling; \"I am used to  sleep by myself.\"    \"Still,\" replied the Baron, \"every precaution should be taken. Now  once more good night.\"    He shook him by the hand, and, followed by the servant, left the room.    Thus Edward found himself alone, in the large, mysterious-looking,  haunted room, where his deceased friend had so often reposed; where  he also was expected to see a vision. The awe which the place itself  inspired, combined with the sad and yet tender recollection of the  departed Ferdinand, produced a state of mental excitement which was  not favorable to his night's rest. He had already undressed with the  aid of his servant (whom he had then dismissed,) and had been in  bed some time, having extinguished the candles. No sleep visited his  eyelids; and the thought recurred which had so often troubled him,  why he had never received the promised token from Ferdinand, whether  his friend's spirit were among the blest--whether his silence (so to  speak) proceeded from unwillingness or incapacity to communicate with  the living. A mingled train of reflections agitated his mind; his  brain grew heated; his pulse beat faster and faster. The castle clock  tolled eleven--half-past eleven. He counted the strokes: and at  that moment the moon rose above the dark margin of the rocks which  surrounded the castle, and shed her full light into Edward's room.  Every object stood out in relief from the darkness. Edward gazed, and  thought, and speculated. It seemed to him as if something moved in the  furthest corner of the room. The movement was evident--it assumed a  form--the form of a man, which appeared to advance, or rather to float  forward. Here Edward lost all sense of surrounding objects, and found  himself once more sitting at the foot of the monument in the garden  of the academy, where he had contracted the bond with his friend.  As formerly, the moon streamed through the dark branches of the  fir-trees, and shed its pale cold light on the cold white marble of  the monument. Then the floating form which had appeared in the room of  the castle became clearer, more substantial, more earthly-looking; it  issued from behind the tombstone, and stood in the full moonlight. It  was Ferdinand, in the uniform of his regiment, earnest and pale, but  with a kind smile on his features.    \"Ferdinand, Ferdinand!\" cried Edward, overcome by joy and surprise,  and he strove to embrace the well-loved form, but it waved him aside  with a melancholy look.    \"Ah! you are dead,\" continued the speaker; \"and why then do I see you  just as you looked when living?\"    \"Edward,\" answered the apparition, in a voice that sounded as if it  came from afar, \"I am dead, but my spirit has no peace.\"    \"You are not with the blest?\" cried Edward, in a voice of terror.    \"God is merciful,\" it replied; \"but we are frail and sinful creatures;  inquire no more, but pray for me.\"    \"With all my heart,\" cried Edward, in a tone of anguish, while he  gazed with affection on the familiar features; \"but speak, what can I  do for thee?\"    \"An unholy tie still binds me to earth. I have sinned. I was cut off  in the midst of my sinful projects. This ring burns.\" He slipped a  small gold ring from his left hand. \"Only when every token of this  unholy compact is destroyed, and when I recover the ring which I  exchanged for this, only then can my spirit be at rest. Oh, Edward,  dear Edward, bring me back my ring!\"    \"With joy--but where, where am I to seek it?\"    \"Emily Varnier will give it thee herself; our engagement was contrary  to holy duties, to prior engagements, to earlier vows. God denied  his blessing to the guilty project, and my course was arrested in a  fearful manner. Pray for me, Edward, and bring me back the ring, my  ring,\" continued the voice, in a mournful tone of appeal.    Then the features of the deceased smiled sadly but tenderly; then all  appeared to float once more before Edward's eyes--the form was lost  in mist, the monument, the fir-grove, the moonlight, disappeared; a  long, gloomy, breathless pause followed. Edward lay, half sleeping,  half benumbed, in a confused manner; portions of the dream returned  to him--some images, some sounds--above all, the petition for the  restitution of the ring. But an indescribable power bound his limbs,  closed his eyelids, and silenced his voice; mental consciousness alone  was left him, yet his mind was a prey to terror.    At length these painful sensations subsided--his nerves became more  braced, his breath came more freely, a pleasing languor crept over his  limbs, and he fell into a peaceful sleep. When he awoke it was already  broad daylight; his sleep toward the end of the night had been  quiet and refreshing. He felt strong and well, but as soon as the  recollection of his dream returned, a deep melancholy took possession  of him, and he felt the traces of tears which grief had wrung from  him on his eyelashes. But what had the vision been? A mere dream  engendered by the conversation of the evening, and his affection for  Hallberg's memory, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13650"],[0,"Nonsense Books (#18)"],[1,"e, my friend!

VII.       \"Though you've such a tiny body,           And your head so large doth grow,--             Though your hat may blow away,         Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo!

That is all I have to say,        Mr. Yongby-Bonghy-Bo!        Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo!\"                          VIII.        Down the slippery slopes of Myrtle,          Where the early pumpkins blow,            To the calm and silent sea         Fled the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.      There, beyond the Bay of Gurtle,      Lay a large and lively Turtle.           \"You're the Cove,\" he said, \"for me;            On your back beyond the sea,            Turtle, you shall carry me!\"        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo,        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.                  [Illustration]                          IX.        Through the silent-roaring ocean          Did the Turtle swiftly go;            Holding fast upon his shell        Rode the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.      With a sad primaeval motion      Towards the sunset isles of Boshen            Still the Turtle bore him well.            Holding fast upon his shell,           \"Lady Jingly Jones, farewell!\"        Sang the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo,        Sang the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.                          X.        From the Coast of Coromandel          Did that Lady never go;            On that heap of stones she mourns        For the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.      On that Coast of Coromandel,      In his jug without a handle          Still she weeps, and daily moans;          On that little heap of stones          To her Dorking Hens she moans,            For the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo,            For the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.          THE POBBLE WHO HAS NO TOES.    [Illustration]                        I.        The Pobble who has no toes          Had once as many as we;      When they said, \"Some day you may lose them all;\"          He replied, \"Fish fiddle de-dee!\"      And his Aunt Jobiska made him drink      Lavender water tinged with pink;      For she said, \"The World in general knows      There's nothing so good for a Pobble's toes!\"                          II.        The Pobble who has no toes,          Swam across the Bristol Channel;      But before he set out he wrapped his nose          In a piece of scarlet flannel.      For his Aunt Jobiska said, \"No harm      Can come to his toes if his nose is warm;      And it's perfectly known that a Pobble's toes      Are safe--provided he minds his nose.\"                          III.        The Pobble swam fast and well,          And when boats or ships came near him,      He tinkledy-binkledy-winkled a bell          So that all the world could hear him.      And all the Sailors and Admirals cried,      When they saw him nearing the further side,--     \"He has gone to fish, for his Aunt Jobiska's      Runcible Cat with crimson whiskers!\"                          IV.        But before he touched the shore,--          The shore of the Bristol Channel,      A sea-green Porpoise carried away          His wrapper of scarlet flannel.      And when he came to observe his feet,      Formerly garnished with toes so neat,      His face at once became forlorn      On perceiving that all his toes were gone!                          V.        And nobody ever knew,          From that dark day to the present,      Whoso had taken the Pobble's toes,          In a manner so far from pleasant.      Whether the shrimps or crawfish gray,      Or crafty Mermaids stole them away,      Nobody knew; and nobody knows      How the Pobble was robbed of his twice five toes!                          VI.        The Pobble who has no toes          Was placed in a friendly Bark,      And they rowed him back, and carried him up          To his Aunt Jobiska's Park.      And she made him a feast, at his earnest wish,      Of eggs and buttercups fried with fish;      And she said, \"It's a fact the whole world knows,      That Pobbles are happier without their toes.\"          THE NEW VESTMENTS.        There lived an old man in the Kingdom of Tess,      Who invented a purely original dress;      And when it was perfectly made and complete,      He opened the door and walked into the street.        By way of a hat he'd a loaf of Brown Bread,      In the middle of which he inserted his head;      His Shirt was made up of no end of dead Mice,      The warmth of whose skins was quite fluffy and nice;      His Drawers were of Rabbit-skins, so were his Shoes;      His Stockings were skins, but it is not known whose;      His Waistcoat and Trowsers were made of Pork Chops;      His Buttons were Jujubes and Chocolate Drops;      His Coat was all Pancakes, with Jam for a border,      And a girdle of Biscuits to keep it in order;      And he wore over all, as a screen from bad weather,      A Cloak of green Cabbage-leaves stitched all together.        He had walked a short way, when he heard a great noise,      Of all sorts of Beasticles, Birdlings, and Boys;      And from every long street and dark lane in the town      Beasts, Birdies, and Boys in a tumult rushed down.      Two Cows and a Calf ate his Cabbage-leaf Cloak;      Four Apes seized his Girdle, which vanished like smoke;      Three Kids ate up half of his Pancaky Coat,      And the tails were devour'd by an ancient He Goat;      An army of Dogs in a twinkling tore _up_ his      Pork Waistcoat and Trowsers to give to their Puppies;      And while they were growling, and mumbling the Chops,      Ten Boys prigged the Jujubes and Chocolate Drops.      He tried to run back to his house, but in vain,      For scores of fat Pigs came again and again:      They rushed out of stables and hovels and doors;      They tore off his stockings, his shoes, and his drawers;      And now from the housetops with screechings descend      Striped, spotted, white, black, and gray Cats without end:      They jumped on his shoulders and knocked off his hat,      When Crows, Ducks, and Hens made a mincemeat of that;      They speedily flew at his sleeves in a trice,      And utterly tore up his Shirt of dead Mice;      They swallowed the last of his Shirt with a squall,--      Whereon he ran home with no clothes on at all.        And he said to himself, as he bolted the door,     \"I will not wear a similar dress any more,      Any more, any more, any more, never more!\"          MR. AND MRS. DISCOBBOLOS.                        I.        Mr. and Mrs. Discobbolos          Climbed to the top of a wall.        And they sate to watch the sunset sky,        And to hear the Nupiter Piffkin cry,          And the Biscuit Buffalo call.      They took up a roll and some Camomile tea,      And both were as happy as happy could be,              Till Mrs. Discobbolos said,--             \"Oh! W! X! Y! Z!              It has just come into my head,        Suppose we should happen to fall!!!!!                          Darling Mr. Discobbolos!                          II.       \"Suppose we should fall down flumpetty,          Just like pieces of stone,        On to the thorns, or into the moat,        What would become of your new green coat?          And might you not break a bone?      It never occurred to me before,      That perhaps we shall never go down any more!\"              And Mrs. Discobbolos said,             \"Oh! W! X! Y! Z!              What put it into your head        To climb up this wall, my own                          Darling Mr. Discobbolos?\"                          III.        Mr. Discobbolos answered,         \"At first it gave me pain,        And I felt my ears turn perfectly pink        When your exclamation made me think          We might never get down again!      But now I believe it is wiser far      To remain for ever just where we are.\"              And Mr. Discobbolos said,             \"Oh! W! X! Y! Z!              It has just come into my head        We shall never go down again,                          Dearest Mrs. Discobbolos!\"                          IV.        So Mr. and Mrs. Discobbolos          Stood up and began to sing,--       \"Far away from hurry and strife        Here we will pass the rest of life,          Ding a dong, ding dong, ding!      We want no knives nor forks nor chairs,      No tables nor carpets nor household cares;              From worry of life we've fled;              Oh! W! X! Y! Z!              There is no more trouble ahead,        Sorrow or any such thing,                          For Mr. and Mrs. Discobbolos!\"          THE QUANGLE WANGLE'S HAT.    [Illustration]                        I.        On the top of the Crumpetty Tree          The Quangle Wangle sat,      But his face you could not see,          On account of his Beaver Hat.      For his Hat was a hundred and two feet wide,      With ribbons and bibbons on every side,      And bells, and buttons, and loops, and lace,      So that nobody ever could see the face              Of the Quangle Wangle Quee.                          II.        The Quangle Wangle said          To himself on the Crumpetty Tree,      \"Jam, and jelly, and bread          Are the best of food for me!      But the longer I live on this Crumpetty Tree      The plainer than ever it seems to me      That very few people come this way      And that life on the whole is far from gay!\"              Said the Quangle Wangle Quee.                          III.        But there came to the Crumpetty Tree          Mr. and Mrs. Canary;      And they said, \"Did ever you see          Any spot so charmingly airy?      May we build a nest on your lovely Hat?      Mr. Quangle Wangle, grant us that!      O please let us come and build a nest      Of whatever material suits you best,              Mr. Quangle Wangle Quee!\"                          IV.        And besides, to the"]]]
