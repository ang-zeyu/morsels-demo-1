[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14056"],[0,"The French Impressionists (1860-1900) (#18)"],[1," have to-day almost abandoned this transitional theory  which, in spite of the undeniable talent of its adepts, has only  produced indifferent results as regards easel pictures. Besides Seurat  and Signac, mention should be made of Maurice Denis, Henri-Edmond Cross,  Angrand, and Theo Van Rysselberghe. But this last-named and Maurice  Denis have arrived at great talent by very different merits. M. Maurice  Denis has abandoned Pointillism a few years ago, in favour of returning  to a very strange conception which dates back to the Primitives, and  even to Giotto. He simplifies his drawing archaically, suppresses all  but the indispensable detail, and draws inspiration from Gothic stained  glass and carvings, in order to create decorative figures with clearly  marked outlines which are filled with broad, flat tints. He generally  treats mystic subjects, for which this special manner is suitable. One  cannot love the _parti pris_ of these works, but one cannot deny M.  Denis a great charm of naivete, an intense feeling for decorative  arrangements and colouring of a certain originality. He is almost a  French pre-Raphaelite, and his profound catholic faith inspires him  nobly.    [Illustration: THEO VAN RYSSELBERGHE    PORTRAITS OF MADAME VAN RYSSELBERGHE AND HER DAUGHTER]    M. Theo Van Rysselberghe continues to employ the Pointillist method. But  he is so strongly gifted, that one might almost say he succeeds in  revealing himself as a painter of great merit in spite of this dry and  charmless method. All his works are supported by broad and learned  drawing and his colour is naturally brilliant. M. Van Rysselberghe, a  prolific and varied worker, has painted nudes, large portraits,  landscapes with figures, seascapes, interiors and still-life, and in all  this he evinces faculties of the first order. He is a lover of light and  understands how to make it vibrate over flesh and fabrics. He is an  artist who has the sense of style. He has signed a certain number of  portraits, whose beautiful carriage and serious psychology would suffice  to make him be considered as the most significant of the  Neo-Impressionists. It is really in him that one has to see the young  and worthy heir of Monet, of Sisley, and of Degas, and that is why we  have insisted on adding here to the works of these masters the  reproduction of one of his. M. Van Rysselberghe is also a very delicate  etcher who has signed some fine works in this method, and his seascapes,  whether they revel in the pale greys of the German Ocean or in the warm  sapphire and gold harmonies of the Mediterranean, count among the finest  of the time; they are windows opened upon joyous brightness.    To these painters who have never taken part at the Salons, and are only  to be seen at the exhibitions of the _Independants_ (except M. Denis),  must be added M. Pierre Bonnard, who has given proof to his charm and  fervour in numerous small canvases of Japanese taste; and M. Edouard  Vuillard, who is a painter of intimate scenes of rare delicacy. This  artist, who stands apart and produces very little, has signed some  interiors of melancholic distinction and of a colouring which revels in  low tones. He has the precision and skill of a master. There is in him,  one might say, a reflection of Chardin's soul. Unfortunately his works  are confined to a few collections and have not become known to the  public. To the same group belong M. Ranson, who has devoted himself to  purely decorative art, tapestry, wall papers and embroideries; M.  Georges de Feure, a strange, symbolist water-colour painter, who has  become one of the best designers of the New Art in France; M. Felix  Vallotton, painter and lithographer, who is somewhat heavy, but gifted  with serious qualities. It is true that M. de Feure is Dutch, M.  Vallotton Swiss, and M. Van Rysselberghe Belgian; but they have settled  down in France, and are sufficiently closely allied to the  Neo-Impressionist movement so that the question of nationality need not  prevent us from mentioning them here. Finally it is impossible not to  say a few words about two pupils of Gustave Moreau's, who have both  become noteworthy followers of Impressionism of very personal  individuality. M. Eugene Martel bids fair to be one of the best painters  of interiors of his generation. He has the feeling of mystical life and  paints the peasantry with astonishing psychologic power. His vigorous  colouring links him to Monticelli, and his drawing to Degas. As to M.  Simon Bussy who, following Alphonse Legros's example, is about to make  an enviable position for himself in England, he is an artist of pure  blood. His landscapes and his figures have the distinction and rare tone  of M. Whistler, besides the characteristic acuteness of Degas. His  harmonies are subtle, his vision novel, and he will certainly develop  into an important painter. Together with Henri le Sidaner and Jacques  Blanche, Simon Bussy is decidedly the most personal of that young  generation of \"Intimists\" who seem to have retained the best principles  of the Impressionist masters to employ them for the expression of a  psychologic ideal which is very different from Realism.    Outside this group there are still a few isolated painters who are  difficult to classify. The very young artists Laprade and Charles Guerin  have shown for the last three years, at the exhibition of the  _Independants_, some works which are the worthy result of Manet's and  Renoir's influence. They, too, justify great expectations. The  landscapists Paul Vogler and Maxime Maufra, more advanced in years, have  made themselves known by some solid series of vigorously presented  landscapes. To them must be added M. Henry Moret, M. Albert Andre and M.  Georges d'Espagnet, who equally deserve the success which has commenced  to be their share. But there are some older ones. It is only his due,  that place should be given to a painter who committed suicide after an  unhappy life, and who evinced splendid gifts. Vincent Van Gogh, a  Dutchman, who, however, had always worked in France, has left to the  world some violent and strange works, in which Impressionism appears to  have reached the limits of its audacity. Their value lies in their naive  frankness and in the undauntable determination which tried to fix  without trickery the sincerest feelings. Amidst many faulty and clumsy  works, Van Gogh has also left some really beautiful canvases. There is a  deep affinity between him and Cezanne. A very real affinity exists, too,  between Paul Gauguin, who was a friend and to a certain extent the  master of Van Gogh, and Cezanne and Renoir. Paul Gauguin's robust talent  found its first motives in Breton landscapes, in which the method of  colour-spots can be found employed with delicacy and placed at the  service of a rather heavy, but very interesting harmony. Then the artist  spent a long time in Tahiti, whence he returned with a completely  transformed manner. He has brought back from these regions some  landscapes with figures treated in intentionally clumsy and almost wild  fashion. The figures are outlined in firm strokes and painted in broad,  flat tints on canvas which has the texture almost of tapestry. Many of  these works are made repulsive by their aspect of multi-coloured, crude  and barbarous imagery. Yet one cannot but acknowledge the fundamental  qualities, the beautiful values, the ornamental taste, and the  impression of primitive animalism. On the whole, Paul Gauguin has a  beautiful, artistic temperament which, in its aversion to virtuosoship,  has perhaps not sufficiently understood that the fear of formulas, if  exaggerated, may lead to other formulas, to a false ignorance which is  as dangerous as false knowledge. Gauguin's symbolical intentions, like  those of his pupil Emile Bernard, are sincere, but are badly served by  minds which do not agree with their technical qualities, and both  Gauguin and Emile Bernard are most happily inspired when they are  painters pure and simple.    Next to Gauguin, among the seniors of the present generation and the  successors of Impressionism, should be placed the landscapist Armand  Guillaumin who, without possessing Sisley's delicate qualities, has  painted some canvases worthy of notice; and we must, finally, terminate  this far too summary enumeration by referring to one of the most gifted  painters of the French School of the day, M. Louis Anquetin. His is a  most varied talent whose power is unquestionable. He made his _debut_  among the Neo-Impressionists and revealed the influence upon him of the  Japanese and of Degas. It may be seen that these two influences  predominate in the whole group. Then M. Anquetin became fascinated by  the breadth and superb freedom of Manet's works, and signed a series of  portraits and sketches, some of which are not far below so great a  master's. They are works which will surprise the critics, when our  contemporary painting will be examined with calm impartiality. After  these works, M. Anquetin gave way to his impetuous nature which led him  to decorative painting, and he became influenced by Rubens, Jordaens,  and the Fontainebleau School. He painted theatre curtains and  mythological scenes, in which he gave free rein to his sensual  imagination. In spite of some admirable qualities, it seems as though  the artist had strayed from his true path in painting these brilliant,  but somewhat declamatory works, and he has since returned to a more  modern and more direct painting. In all his changed conditions Anquetin  has shown a considerable talent, pleasing in its fine vigour,  impetuosity, brilliancy and sincerity. His inequality is perhaps the  cause of his relative want of success; it has put the public off, but  nevertheless in certain of this brave and serious painter's canvases can  be seen the happy influence of Manet.    It seems to us only right to sum up our impartial opinion of  Neo-Impressionism "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14060"],[0,"Mr. Britling Sees It Through (#18)"],[1,"London and Norwich high road; it is an old Roman Stane  Street and very straightforward and honest in its stretches. You can see  the cross roads half a mile away, and the low hedges give you no chance  of a surprise. Everybody is cheered by such a road, and everybody drives  more confidently and quickly, and Mr. Britling particularly was  heartened by it and gradually let out Gladys from the almost excessive  restriction that had hitherto marked the day. \"On a road like this  nothing can happen,\" said Mr. Britling.    \"Unless you broke an axle or burst a tyre,\" said Mr. Direck.    \"My man at Matching's Easy is most careful in his inspection,\" said Mr.  Britling, putting the accelerator well down and watching the speed  indicator creep from forty to forty-five. \"He went over the car not a  week ago. And it's not one month old--in use that is.\"    Yet something did happen.    It was as they swept by the picturesque walls under the big old trees  that encircle Brandismead Park. It was nothing but a slight  miscalculation of distances. Ahead of them and well to the left, rode a  postman on a bicycle; towards them, with that curious effect of  implacable fury peculiar to motor cycles, came a motor cyclist. First  Mr. Britling thought that he would not pass between these two, then he  decided that he would hurry up and do so, then he reverted to his former  decision, and then it seemed to him that he was going so fast that he  must inevitably run down the postman. His instinct not to do that pulled  the car sharply across the path of the motor cyclist. \"Oh, my God!\"  cried Mr. Britling. \"My God!\" twisted his wheel over and distributed his  feet among his levers dementedly.    He had an imperfectly formed idea of getting across right in front of  the motor cyclist, and then they were going down the brief grassy slope  between the road and the wall, straight at the wall, and still at a good  speed. The motor cyclist smacked against something and vanished from the  problem. The wall seemed to rush up at them and then--collapse. There  was a tremendous concussion. Mr. Direck gripped at his friend the  emergency brake, but had only time to touch it before his head hit  against the frame of the glass wind-screen, and a curtain fell upon  everything....    He opened his eyes upon a broken wall, a crumpled motor car, and an  undamaged motor cyclist in the aviator's cap and thin oilskin overalls  dear to motor cyclists. Mr. Direck stared and then, still stunned and  puzzled, tried to raise himself. He became aware of acute pain.    \"Don't move for a bit,\" said the motor cyclist. \"Your arm and side are  rather hurt, I think....\"      Section 8    In the course of the next twelve hours Mr. Direck was to make a  discovery that was less common in the days before the war than it has  been since. He discovered that even pain and injury may be vividly  interesting and gratifying.    If any one had told him he was going to be stunned for five or six  minutes, cut about the brow and face and have a bone in his wrist put  out, and that as a consequence he would find himself pleased and  exhilarated, he would have treated the prophecy with ridicule; but here  he was lying stiffly on his back with his wrist bandaged to his side and  smiling into the darkness even more brightly than he had smiled at the  Essex landscape two days before. The fact is pain hurts or irritates,  but in itself it does not make a healthily constituted man miserable.  The expectation of pain, the certainty of injury may make one hopeless  enough, the reality rouses our resistance. Nobody wants a broken bone or  a delicate wrist, but very few people are very much depressed by getting  one. People can be much more depressed by smoking a hundred cigarettes  in three days or losing one per cent. of their capital.    And everybody had been most delightful to Mr. Direck.    He had had the monopoly of damage. Mr. Britling, holding on to the  steering wheel, had not even been thrown out. \"Unless I'm internally  injured,\" he said, \"I'm not hurt at all. My liver perhaps--bruised a  little....\"    Gladys had been abandoned in the ditch, and they had been very kindly  brought home by a passing automobile. Cecily had been at the Dower  House at the moment of the rueful arrival. She had seen how an American  can carry injuries. She had made sympathy and helpfulness more  delightful by expressed admiration.    \"She's a natural born nurse,\" said Mr. Direck, and then rather in the  tone of one who addressed a public meeting: \"But this sort of thing  brings out all the good there is in a woman.\"    He had been quite explicit to them and more particularly to her, when  they told him he must stay at the Dower House until his arm was cured.  He had looked the application straight into her pretty eyes.    \"If I'm to stay right here just as a consequence of that little shake  up, may be for a couple of weeks, may be three, and if you're coming to  do a bit of a talk to me ever and again, then I tell you I don't call  this a misfortune. It isn't a misfortune. It's right down sheer good  luck....\"    And now he lay as straight as a mummy, with his soul filled with  radiance of complete mental peace. After months of distress and  confusion, he'd got straight again. He was in the middle of a real good  story, bright and clean. He knew just exactly what he wanted.    \"After all,\" he said, \"it's true. There's ideals. _She's_ an ideal. Why,  I loved her before ever I set eyes on Mamie. I loved her before I was  put into pants. That old portrait, there it was pointing my destiny....  It's affinity.... It's natural selection....    \"Well, I don't know what she thinks of me yet, but I do know very well  what she's _got_ to think of me. She's got to think all the world of  me--if I break every limb of my body making her do it.    \"I'd a sort of feeling it was right to go in that old automobile.    \"Say what you like, there's a Guidance....\"    He smiled confidentially at the darkness as if they shared a secret.          CHAPTER THE FOURTH    MR. BRITLING IN SOLILOQUY      Section 1    Very different from the painful contentment of the bruised and broken  Mr. Direck was the state of mind of his unwounded host. He too was  sleepless, but sleepless without exaltation. The day had been too much  for him altogether; his head, to borrow an admirable American  expression, was \"busy.\"    How busy it was, a whole chapter will be needed to describe....    The impression Mr. Britling had made upon Mr. Direck was one of  indefatigable happiness. But there were times when Mr. Britling was  called upon to pay for his general cheerful activity in lump sums of  bitter sorrow. There were nights--and especially after seasons of  exceptional excitement and nervous activity--when the reckoning would be  presented and Mr. Britling would welter prostrate and groaning under a  stormy sky of unhappiness--active insatiable unhappiness--a beating with  rods.    The sorrows of the sanguine temperament are brief but furious; the world  knows little of them. The world has no need to reckon with them. They  cause no suicides and few crimes. They hurry past, smiting at their  victim as they go. None the less they are misery. Mr. Britling in these  moods did not perhaps experience the grey and hopeless desolations of  the melancholic nor the red damnation of the choleric, but he saw a  world that bristled with misfortune and error, with poisonous thorns and  traps and swampy places and incurable blunderings. An almost  insupportable remorse for being Mr. Britling would pursue  him--justifying itself upon a hundred counts....    And for being such a Britling!...    Why--he revived again that bitter question of a thousand and one unhappy  nights--why was he such a fool? Such a hasty fool? Why couldn't he look  before he leapt? Why did he take risks? Why was he always so ready to  act upon the supposition that all was bound to go well? (He might as  well have asked why he had quick brown eyes.)    Why, for instance, hadn't he adhered to the resolution of the early  morning? He had begun with an extremity of caution....    It was a characteristic of these moods of Mr. Britling that they  produced a physical restlessness. He kept on turning over and then  turning over again, and sitting up and lying back, like a martyr on a  gridiron....    This was just the latest instance of a life-long trouble. Will there  ever be a sort of man whose thoughts are quick and his acts slow? Then  indeed we shall have a formidable being. Mr. Britling's thoughts were  quick and sanguine and his actions even more eager than his thoughts.  Already while he was a young man Mr. Britling had found his acts elbow  their way through the hurry of his ideas and precipitate humiliations.  Long before his reasons were marshalled, his resolutions were formed. He  had attempted a thousand remonstrances with himself; he had sought to  remedy the defects in his own character by written inscriptions in his  bedroom and memoranda inside his watch case. \"Keep steady!\" was one of  them. \"Keep the End in View.\" And, \"Go steadfastly, coherently,  continuously; only so can you go where you will.\" In distrusting all  impulse, scrutinising all imagination, he was persuaded lay his one  prospect of escape from the surprise of countless miseries. Otherwise he  danced among glass bombs and barbed wire.    There had been a time when he could exhort himself to such fundamental  charge and go through phases of the severest discipline. Always at last  to be taken by surprise from some unexpected quarter. At last he had  ceased to hope for any triumph so radical. He had been content to  believe that in recent years age and a gathering habit of wisdom had  somewhat slowed his leaping purpose. That if he hadn't overcome he had  at least to a certain extent minimised it. But this last folly was  surely the worst. To charge through this patient world with--how much  did the car"]]]
