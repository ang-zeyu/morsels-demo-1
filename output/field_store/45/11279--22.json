REPARTIE D'UN AMI DE VOLTAIRE    Un jour un auteur aussi celebre par son esprit que craint pour  ses epigrammes pria Voltaire de le faire inviter a un grand diner  de gala. \"Je le veux bien, dit-il, mais a la condition que vous  ne prononcerez qu'une seule phrase.--Convenu.\" Au diner, on sert  un plat de petits poissons et Voltaire, qui en etait friand, le  mange a lui tout seul. \"Ah! s'ecrie-t-il satisfait, j'ai mange  de ces petits poissons autant que Samson tua de Philistins.\"  L'autre, qui n'avait rien dit jusque la, ouvre la bouche et grogne:  \"Avec la meme machoire.\"      Redoutait-on avec raison le celebre satirique?--Ou voulait-il  se faire inviter?--A qui s'est-il adresse dans ce but?--A quelle  condition l'autre a-t-il consenti a lui faire ce service?--Le  premier est-il demeure d'accord?--A-t-il tenu parole?--Quel plat  a-t-on servi au diner?--Voltaire l'a-t-il trouve a son gout?--Comment  s'est-il exprime la-dessus?--Le satirique a-t-il continue a garder  le silence?

PLUS DE CONFIANCE EN MOINS DE MERITE    On sait que Moliere n'avait aucune confiance dans les medecins,  et qu'il s'en moqua dans quelques-unes de ses comedies, ou il  exposait leur charlatanisme. Une fois, voyageant en Auvergne, il  tomba malade a une petite distance de Clermont. On lui proposa  d'envoyer chercher un medecin celebre de cette ville. \"Non, non,  dit-il, je n'oserais m'y fier; c'est un trop grand homme pour  moi; allez me chercher le chirurgien du village voisin; il n'aura  peut-etre pas la hardiesse de me tuer.\"      Quelle opinion Moliere avait-il de la profession de medecin?--Y  avait-il en effet beaucoup de charlatanisme au XVIIe siecle?--Quel  moyen Moliere avait-il d'exposer l'exploitation de la credulite  publique?--Ou Moliere est-il tombe malade?--Qui a-t-on voulu  faire venir?--Moliere s'y est-il oppose?    Soyez pret a definir les mots les plus difficiles de cette histoire.      126. TROP TARD    Chasseur citadin: \"Vous ne vous opposez pas a ce qu'on chasse[1]  sur votre ferme?\"--Fermier: \"Plus a present.--Y a-t-il du  gibier?--Plus a present. Un chasseur de la ville etait ici la  semaine derniere, et il a tue le dernier mouton.\"    [Footnote 1: Why subjunctive?]      Quelle permission le chasseur sollicitait-il?--Le fermier y a-t-il  fait des obstacles?--Pourquoi etait-il inutile de demander la  permission de chasser sur ses terres?    Racontez plus au long cet incident.      127. MOYEN D'EVITER LES DISCUSSIONS    Un financier avait l'habitude de rassembler ses actionnaires, une  fois par an, dans une immense salle ou il n'y avait ni chaises  ni table. Il lisait son rapport; puis il ajoutait: \"Que tous  ceux qui approuvent se levent.\" Naturellement personne n'etant  assis, le brave homme s'ecriait: \"Approuve a l'unanimite!\" et  declarait la seance levee.      Quelle coutume le capitaliste avait-il?--Qu'y avait-il dans la  salle?--Comment le financier s'y prenait-il pour faire approuver  son rapport?--Sa ruse prenait-elle?      128. COMMENT FAIRE TAIRE UN COCHON    Charles-Quint, allant voir le cloitre des Dominicains a Vienne,  rencontra sur son chemin un paysan qui portait un cochon. Comme  cet animal poussait des cris fort desagreables, l'empereur demanda  au paysan s'il n'avait pas appris la methode d'empecher les cochons  de crier. Le rustre avoue ingenument que non, et ajoute qu'il  serait bien content de la savoir. \"Prends le cochon par la queue,  lui dit l'empereur, et tu verras qu'il se taira.\" Le paysan le  fit, et le pore se tut; puis, s'adressant a Charles-Quint: \"Il  faut, lui dit-il, que vous ayez[1] appris le metier plus longtemps  que moi, monsieur, car vous le savez beaucoup mieux.\"    Ce doit etre pour jouir d'aventures pareilles que les rois vont  souvent incognito.

LA BOMBE    Charles XII a ete l'un des rois de France les plus belliqueux.  Voici un episode emprunte aux oeuvres de Voltaire, a l'appui  de cette opinion:    Un jour qu'il dictait des lettres pour la Suede a un secretaire,  une bombe tomba sur la maison, perca le toit et vint eclater  pres de la chambre meme du roi. La moitie du plancher tomba en  pieces. Le cabinet ou le roi dictait, etant pratique en partie  dans une grosse muraille, ne souffrit point de l'ebranlement, et  par un bonheur etonnant, nul des eclats qui sautaient en l'air  n'entra dans ce cabinet dont la porte etait ouverte. Au bruit  de la bombe, et au fracas de la maison qui semblait tomber, la  plume echappa des mains du secretaire. \"Qu'y a-t-il done? lui  dit le roi d'un air tranquille; pourquoi n'ecrivez-vous pas?\"  Celui-ci ne put repondre que ces mots: \"Eh! sire, la bombe!--Eh  bien! Reprit le roi, qu'a de commun la bombe avec la lettre que  je vous dicte? Continuez!\"      Racontez cette histoire.      130. LE BAVARD    Un jeune fat tenta un jour de lier conversation avec Aristote. Le  philosophe cependant ne pretait guere attention a ce que l'autre  lui disait. Le babillard, apres s'etre epuise en vains propos,  voyant qu'Aristote ne lui repondit rien: \"Je vous incommode  peut-etre, lui dit-il, ces bagatelles vous detournent de quelques  pensees plus serieuses?--N'importe, repondit Aristote, vous pouvez  continuer: je n'ecoute pas.\" Moyen efficace pour se debarrasser  d'un facheux, mais dont beaucoup de gens n'auraient pas le courage  de se servir.      Comment le bavard a-t-il aborde le philosophe?--Celui-ci a-t-il  attache une grande importance aux paroles du jeune homme?--Le fat  s'en est-il apercu enfin?--A-t-il eu l'aplomb de continuer?--De"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11758"],[0,"Baldy of Nome (#18)"],[1,"'--t' lay fer a dog that didn't have a  chance agin him.\"    \"But surely Tom, after all of his years of training, would not have  attacked one of his own stable-mates. Such a thing has never occurred  before in our Kennel. I fear, Ben, it must have been Baldy.\"    But \"Scotty\" was not so confident. \"I agree with Ben; it's not like  Baldy. I have never found him quarrelsome, nor vindictive. And I hate,  too, to believe Tom guilty. You know I never punish a dog on  circumstantial evidence; so I am afraid this cold-blooded murder will  have to be passed over, unless we can be certain of the criminal. There  is always the possibility that a stray dog may have been responsible.\"    \"Well, don't saddle it onto the Yellow Peril,\" exclaimed the Big Man,  who came in to see what was the matter. \"He is popularly supposed to  start every dog fight in Nome; but this time he can prove a clear  alibi, for he slept at the foot of my bed all night.\" Thus exonerated,  the Peril passed by the line of chained dogs, bumping into them in a  perfectly unnecessary manner, and emitting supercilious growls that in  themselves would have been sufficient grounds for instant death if Pete  Bernard's huskies could have acted upon their unanimous opinion.    \"It's a terrible thing,\" sighed the Woman, \"to have a murderer in our  midst and not know who it is. It makes me feel positively creepy.\" And  again, almost unconsciously, her glance fell upon Baldy.    And so the affair was ended officially. But Baldy could not forget the  sickening suspicion that had rested upon him. In her heart the Woman  felt that he was the culprit; and even \"Scotty\" had not been absolutely  certain of his innocence. There was only Ben who _knew_.    Forlornly the boy and the dog wandered about throughout that dismal day,  which seemed interminable. Nothing interested them, even the very things  that had made the other days pass so quickly and so happily. Nothing  except gloomily watching Tom, whose actions would have plainly proved  his guilt to \"Scotty\" had the man not been too absorbed in an  improvement for his sled to take much notice of anything else.    For a brief period the wily criminal had shown a humility as deep as it  was unusual; he had sat on a pile of wood alone, not even romping with  Dick and Harry till he felt the Hour of Judgment had passed. And then,  deciding that there was no punishment forthcoming, he had leaped and  frisked, and seemed so guileless that Baldy's contempt for his own kind  made life hardly worth while.    One might look for such actions from inferior animals--from a cat that  has killed a bird for instance; for cats are only soft-footed, purring  bundles of deceit, with no standard of trail morals. But for a dog, a  racing dog, and one belonging to the Allan and Darling Team, it was  almost incredible. One would expect him at least to have the courage of  his convictions, and be willing to take the consequences of what he  regarded as a legitimate feud.    Tom's escape from all blame in this deplorable matter rankled. It made  Baldy realize the indifference or casual injustice of a world that  seldom delves below the surface of things; and while at times it plunged  him into periods of depression, more often it spurred him on in his  dogged determination to attain the goal of his recently aroused  ambitions.    Fortunately he had a forgiving nature, and realized they could not know  how deeply he had been wounded by their lack of faith. Also he was too  busy to brood very much, for when they exercised at all, the new dogs  were being tried out, and the older ones were in demand as \"trainers.\"  Most recruits are as eager for the honor of making the team as a  freshman is to get into college football; but occasionally it was thrust  upon an unwilling candidate.    \"I should not be at all surprised if I have some trouble with Fisher,\"  remarked \"Scotty,\" as he turned the dogs out one day for their usual  run. \"He has a certain malamute stubbornness that might cause me a lot  of annoyance just when I could least afford the time to correct him.\"    \"Well, after your famous victory over Jack McMillan I do not anticipate  seeing any real difficulty with Fisher,\" was the Big Man's confident  reply. \"I think you would be eligible to the position of wild beast  tamer in a menagerie as the result of your tussle with Jack; for his  strong wolf strain and his enormous strength certainly made him a  formidable opponent. Yet you never tied nor whipped him.\"    \"That had been tried constantly, with no success, and some danger. You  see, with McMillan's disposition, such treatment only made him more  defiant, without in the least breaking his spirit. I knew of course that  he would have to be conquered, and conquered completely, or become an  outlaw against whom every one would turn; but the punishment would have  to be more vital and less humiliating than a beating. It won't do to  embitter an animal any more than it will a person. You have to leave a  certain self-respect and give him a fair chance.\"    And more than a fair chance Jack had received in that thrilling moment  when the wiry little Scotchman, cool and determined, had faced the huge  brute whose nature, harking back to the wild, threw off the shackles of  generations of suppression and training, and rose to meet his hereditary  enemy--opposing fierce resentment to all efforts of control.    For an instant the man and dog had paused, each seeming to gauge the  strength of the other--then the instinct to kill, that heritage from the  past, when the timber wolf gave no quarter, rose supreme; and the dog  sprang forward, the wide open jaws revealing his sharp, white teeth and  cruelly broken tusks. Suddenly the weight of Allan's body was hurled  against him; strong supple fingers closed upon his neck, and with an  unexpected wrench Jack McMillan's head was buried in a drift of soft,  deep snow. He struggled violently to wrest himself from the iron grasp;  madly he fought for freedom; but always there was that slow, deadly  tightening at the throat. Panting and choking, he had made one last  desperate attempt to break the grip that pinned him down; and then lay  spent and inert except for an occasional hoarse gasp, or convulsive  movement of his massive frame.    At length the man had risen, and the dog, feeling himself loosed, and  able to get his breath, staggered uncertainly to his feet, turned, and  stood bravely facing his foe. There was, for a brief period, the  suggestion of a renewed conflict in the dog's attitude. With the foam  dripping from his mouth, quivering in every muscle; but still erect,  exhausted but not cowed, he waited for the next move--and when it came  McMillan had met his master. Not because of the force in the vise-like  fingers, not because of the dominating mind that controlled them, but  because of the generous spirit that treats a conquered enemy--even a  dog--as an honorable antagonist, not an abject slave.    There had seemed to be a sudden comprehension on the part of the dog,  like the clearing of a distorting mist. He realized in the tone of the  man's voice the recognition and appreciation of qualities which stand  not alone for unquenchable hatred, but for undying fidelity as well; and  when \"Scotty's\" hand fell upon his head, and gently stroked the soft  sable muzzle, Jack McMillan had not only met a master, but he had made a  friend.    \"But Fisher is quite different from Jack. There was never anything petty  about him. Even his hatred had something impressive about it, for he  fought to kill, and was never snarling and underhanded. You always knew  where you stood with him. While Fisher is not at all dangerous, he has  many undesirable traits that are difficult to overcome. He shirked all  the way up from town. That may have been the fault of his training, or  possibly he is naturally lazy; that is what I want to find out. At any  rate nagging does not seem to worry him in the least.\"    The Woman came out of the house pulling on her fur gloves. \"What do you  say,\" she asked Allan, \"to a spin over to Mary's Igloo? Father Bernard  has all sorts of native curios there that I should like to see, and the  day is right for a drive.\"    \"Fine idea,\" agreed the Big Man. \"And Ben and I will follow with as many  of Pete's huskies as we think we can manage without being slated for the  hospital. We might try the Yellow Peril in the lead.\"    \"In that case,\" the Woman responded rather grimly, \"you will probably be  slated for the cemetery instead. Why don't you get a couple of reindeer  from the camp just below? They may not be so fast, but they are surely  safe, and one feels so picturesque behind them, with all their gay felt  collars and trappings.\"    \"Scotty\" whistled for the dogs, but Fisher was not to be seen. He had  gone back into the stable to doze on the hay, his favorite pastime.  Again and again the whistle failed to gain any response. The other dogs  had all stepped into place before the sled; when at last Fisher,  reluctant in coming, meditated a moment, and then, in open rebellion,  darted down the steep banks into the overflow of the Springs. The water,  a strange freak of nature in the Arctic, was very warm, and deep enough  so that he had to swim; and he felt that he had selected an ideal place  for his Declaration of Independence.    But \"Scotty,\" shouting directions to have the other dogs unhitched,  immediately started in pursuit of the rebel.    Fisher left the hard, well-beaten track, and struck out for some small  willows and alders where the snow had drifted in feathery masses. He  broke through the crust frequently, but knew that a man would have more  difficulty still in making any headway. Finally Allan turned back to the  house, and Fisher sat down to think over his little victory. He was  tired and panting, but he felt he had scored a point; when to his  amazement he saw the man coming toward him, and now on snow-shoes."]]]
