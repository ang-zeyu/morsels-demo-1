Luxurious scenes, unprun'd, or half contriv'd;    Yet, through the mass, his native fire surviv'd:    Rough as rich oar, in mines the treasure lay,    Yet still 'twas rich, and forms at length a play.    In which the bold compiler boasts no merit,    But that his pains have sav'd you scenes of spirit.    Not scenes that would a noisy joy impart,    But such as hush the mind, and warm the heart.    From praise of hands, no sure account he draws,    But fix'd attention is, sincere applause.    If then (for hard you'll own the task) his art    Can to those Embrion scenes new life impart;    The living proudly would exclude his lays,    And to the buried bard resign the praise.    Sir John indeed appears to have been often sensible of the immorality  of his scenes; for in the year 1725 when the company of comedians was  called upon, in a manner that could not be resisted, to revive the  Provok'd Wife, the author, who was conscious how justly it was exposed  to censure, thought proper to substitute a new scene in the fourth  act, in place of another, in which, in the wantonness of his wit  and humour, he had made a Rake talk like a Rake, in the habit of a  Clergyman. To avoid which offence, he put the same Debauchee into the  Undress of a Woman of Quality; for the character of a fine lady, it  seems, is not reckoned so indelibly sacred, as that of a Churchman.  Whatever follies he exposed in the petticoat kept him at least clear  of his former imputed prophaneness, and appeared now to the audience  innocently ridiculous.    This ingenious dramatist died of a quinsey at his house in Whitehall,  on the 26th of March 1726. He was a man of a lively imagination, of  a facetious, and engaging humour, and as he lived esteemed by all his  acquaintance, so he died without leaving ons enemy to reproach his  memory; a felicity which few men of public employments, or possessed  of so distinguished a genius, ever enjoyed. He has left behind  him monuments of fame, which can never perish but with taste and  politeness.      [Footnote A: The two first were never printed from Sir John's  manuscript.]           *       *       *       *       *          Sir RICHARD STEELE, Knt.      This celebrated genius was born in Ireland. His father being a  counsellor at law, and private secretary to James duke of Ormond, he  went over with his grace to that kingdom, when he was raised to the  dignity of lord lieutenant[A]. Our author when but very young, came  over into England; and was educated at the Charter-House school  in London, where Mr. Addison was his school-fellow, and where they  contracted a friendship which continued firm till the death of that  great man.    His inclination leading him to the army, he rode for some time  privately in the guards; in which station, as he himself tells us, in  his Apology for his Writings, he first became an author, a way of  life in which the irregularities of youth are considered as a kind of  recommendation.    Mr. Steele was born with the most violent propension to pleasure, and  at the same time was master of so much good sense, as to be able  to discern the extreme folly of licentious courses, their moral  unfitness, and the many calamities they naturally produce. He  maintained a perpetual struggle between reason and appetite. He  frequently fell into indulgencies, which cost him many a pang of  remorse, and under the conviction of the danger of a vicious life,  he wrote his Christian Hero, with a design to fix upon his own mind a  strong impression of virtue and religion. But this secret admonition  to his conscience he judged too weak, and therefore in the year 1701  printed the book with his name prefixed, in hopes that a standing  evidence against himself in the eyes of the world, might the more  forcibly induce him to lay a restraint upon his desires, and make him  ashamed of vice, so contrary to his own sense and conviction.    This piece was the first of any note, and is esteem'd by some as one  of the best of Mr. Steele's works; he gained great reputation by it,  and recommended himself to the regard of all pious and good men. But  while he grew in the esteem of the religious and worthy, he sunk in  the opinion of his old companions in gaiety: He was reckoned by them  to have degenerated from the gay, sprightly companion, to the dull  disagreeable pedant, and they measured the least levity of his words  and actions with the character of a Christian Hero. Thus he found  himself slighted, instead of being encouraged for his declarations  as to religion; but happily those who held him in contempt for his  defence of piety and goodness were characters, with whom to be at  variance is virtue. But Mr. Steele, who could not be content with the  suffrage of the Good only, without the concurrence of the Gay, set  about recovering the favour of the latter by innocent means: He  introduced a Comedy on the stage, called Grief A-la-Mode, in which,  tho' full of incidents that move laughter, and inspire chearfulness,  virtue and vice appear just as they ought to do. This play was acted  at the Theatre in Drury Lane 1702, and as nothing can make the town  so fond of a man, as a successful play; so this, with some other  particulars enlarged on to his advantage, recommended him to king  William, and his name to be provided for was in the last table-book  worn by his majesty. He had before this time procured a captain's  commission in the lord Lucas's regiment, by the interest of lord  Cutts, to whom he dedicated his Christian Hero, and who likewise  appointed him his secretary: His next appearance as a writer, was in  the office of Gazetteer, in which he observes in the same apology for  himself, he worked faithfully, according to order, without ever erring  against the rule observed by all ministers, to keep that paper very  innocent, and insipid. The reproaches he heard every Gazette-day  against the writer of it, inspired him with a fortitude of being  remarkably negligent of what people said, which he did not deserve. In  endeavouring to acquire this negligence, he certainly acted a prudent  part, and gained the most important and leading advantage, with which,  every author should set out.    Whoever writes for the public, is sure to draw down envy on himself  from some quarter or other, and they who are resolved never to be  pleased, consider him as too assuming, and discover their resentment  by contempt. How miserable is the state of an author! It is his  misfortune in common with the fair sex,      To please too little, or to please too much.    If he happens to be a successful writer, his friends who become then  proud of his acquaintance, flatter him, and by soothing his vanity  teach him to overrate his importance, and while he grasps at universal  fame, he loses by too vigorous an effort, what he had acquired by  diligence and application: If he pleases too little, that is, if his  works are not read, he is in a fair way of being a great loser by his  attempt to please. Mr. Steele still continued to write plays. In the  year 1703 his Comedy, entitled the Tender Husband, or the Accomplished  Fools, was acted at the Theatre in Drury-Lane; as his Comedy of  the Lying-Lovers, or the Ladies Friendship, was likewise the year  following, both with success; so that his reputation was now fully  established.    In the year 1709 he began the Taller, the first of which was published  on Tuesday April the 12th, and the last on Tuesday January the 2d,  1710-11. This paper greatly increasing his fame, he was preferred to  be one of the commissioners of the stamp office. Upon laying down the  Tatler, he set up, in concert with Mr. Addison, the Spectator, which  was continued from March the 1st, 1710-11, to December the 6th 1712;  and resumed June 18th 1714. and continued till December the 20th, the  same year.    The Guardian was likewise published by them, in 1713, and in the  October of the same year, Mr. Steele began a political paper, entitled  the Englishman.    In the Spectator, Mr. Steele's papers are marked with the letter T.  and in them are contained the most picturesque descriptions of low  life, of which he was perfect matter. Humour was his talent, though  not so much confined to that cast of writing to be incapable of  painting very tender scenes; witness his Conscious Lovers, which never  fails to draw tears; and in some of his Spectators he has written in  so feeling a manner, that none can read them without emotion.    He had a strong inclination to find out the humours of low life, and  to make himself master of them. When he was at Edinburgh, as one of  the commissioners on the forfeited estates, he one day made a very  splendid feast, and while his servants were surprized at the great  preparations, and were expecting every moment to carry out his  invitations to the company for whom they imagined it was prepared, he  commanded them to go out to the street, and pick up whatever beggars,  and poor people they saw, and invite them to his house: The servants  obeyed, and Sir Richard soon saw himself at the head of 40 or 50  beggars, together with some poor decay'd tradesmen. After dinner he  plied them with punch and wine, and when the frolic was ended, he  declared, that besides the pleasure of feeding so many hungry persons,  he had learned from them humour enough for a good comedy.    Our author was a man of the highest benevolence; he celebrates a  generous action with a warmth that is only peculiar to a good heart;  and however he may be blamed for want of oeconomy, &c. yet was he  the most agreeable, and if we may be allowed the expression, the most  innocent rake, that ever trod the rounds of indulgence.    He wrote several poetical pieces, particularly the Englishman's thanks  to the duke of Marlborough, printed in 1711; a letter to Sir Miles  Wharton, concerning Occasional Peers, dated March 5th, 1713.

His eyes beaming, a triumphant smile on his lips, Napoleon stepped  forward to meet the little notary. \"Well, Master Ragideau,\" said he,  gayly, \"I have had you called, merely to ask you whether General  Bonaparte really possesses nothing besides his hat and his sword, or  whether you will now forgive Viscountess Beauharnais for having married  me;\" and, as Ragideau looked at him in astonishment, and Josephine asked  the meaning of his strange words, Bonaparte related how, while standing  in Ragideau's antechamber on a certain occasion, he had heard the notary  advising Josephine not to marry poor little Bonaparte; not to become the  wife of the general, who possessed nothing but his hat and his sword.    The notary's words had entered the ambitious young man's heart like a  dagger, and had wounded him deeply. But he had uttered no complaint, and  made no mention of it; but to-day, on the day of his supreme triumph,  to-day the emperor remembered that moment of humiliation, and, arrayed  with the full insignia of the highest earthly dignity, he accorded  himself the triumph of reminding the little notary that he had once  advised Josephine not to marry him, because of his poverty.    The poor General Bonaparte had now transformed himself into the mighty  Emperor Napoleon. Then he possessed nothing but his hat and his sword,  but now the Pope awaited him in the cathedral of Notre-Dame, to place  the golden imperial crown on his head.        CHAPTER VI.    NAPOLEON'S HEIR.    Hortense had not been able to take any part in the festivities of the  coronation; but another festivity had been prepared for her in the  retirement of her apartments. She had given birth to a son; and in this  child the happy mother found consolation and a new hope.    Josephine, who had assumed the imperial crown with a feeling of  foreboding sadness, received the intelligence of the birth of her  grandson with exultation. It seemed to her that the clouds that had been  gathering over her head were now dissipated, and that a day of  unclouded sunshine now smiled down upon her. Hortense had assured her  mother's future; she had given birth to a son, and had thus given a  first support to the new imperial dynasty. There was now no longer a  reason why Napoleon should entertain the thoughts of a separation, for  there was a son to whom he could one day bequeath the imperial throne  of France.    The emperor also seemed to be disposed to favor Josephine's wishes, and  to adopt his brother's son as his own. Had he not requested the Pope to  delay his departure for a few days, in order to baptize the child? The  Pope performed this sacred rite at St. Cloud, the emperor holding the  child, and Madame Letitia standing at his side as second witness.  Hortense now possessed an object upon which she could lavish the whole  wealth of love that had until now lain concealed in her heart. The  little Napoleon Charles was Hortense's first happy love; and she gave  way to this intoxicating feeling with the most intense delight.    Josephine's house was now her home in the fullest sense of the word; she  no longer shared her home with her husband, and could now bestow her  undivided love and care upon her child. Louis Napoleon, the  Grand-Constable of France, had been appointed Governor of Piedmont by  Napoleon; and Hortense, owing to her delicate health, had not been  compelled to accompany him, but had been permitted to remain in her  little house in Paris, which she could exchange when summer came for  her husband's new estate, the castle of Saint-Leu.    But the tranquillity which Josephine enjoyed with her child in this  charming country-resort was to be of short duration. The brother and  sister-in-law of the emperor could not hope to be permitted to lead a  life of retirement. They were rays of the sun that now dazzled the whole  world; they must fulfil their destiny, and contribute their light to the  ruling sun.    An order of Napoleon recalled the constable, who had returned from  Piedmont a short time before, and repaired to Saint-Leu to see his son,  to Paris. Napoleon had appointed his brother to a brilliant destiny; the  Constable of France was to become a king. Delegates of the Republic of  Batavia, the late Holland, had arrived in Paris, and requested their  mighty neighbor, the Emperor Napoleon, to give them a king, who should  unite them with the glittering empire, through the ties of blood.  Napoleon intended to fulfil their wishes, and present them with a king,  in the person of his brother Louis.    But Louis was rather appalled than dazzled by this offer, and refused to  accept the proposed dignity. In this refusal he was also in perfect  harmony with his wife, who did all in her power to strengthen his  resolution. Both felt that the crown which it was proposed to place on  their heads would be nothing more than a golden chain of dependence;  that the King of Holland could be nothing more than the vassal of  France; and their personal relations to each other added another  objection to this political consideration.    In Paris, husband and wife could forget the chain that bound them  together; there they were in the circle of their friends, and could  avoid each other. The great, glittering imperial court served to  separate and reconcile the young couple, who had never forgiven  themselves for having fettered each other in this involuntary union. In  Paris they had amusements, friends, society; while in Holland they would  live in entire dependence on each other, and hear continually the  rattling of the chain with which each had bound the other to the galley  of a union without love.    Both felt this, and both were, therefore, united in the endeavor to ward  off this new misfortune that was suspended over their heads, in the form  of a kingly crown.    But how could they resist successfully the iron will of Napoleon?  Hortense had never had the courage to address Napoleon directly on the  subject of her wishes and petitions, and Josephine already felt that her  wishes no longer exercised the power of earlier days over the emperor.  She therefore avoided interceding where she was not sure of being  successful.    At the outset, Louis had the courage to resist his brother openly; but  Napoleon's angry glance annihilated his opposition, and his gentle,  yielding nature was forced to succumb. In the presence of the deputation  of the Batavian Republic, that so ardently longed for a sceptre and  crown, Napoleon appealed to his brother Louis to accept the crown which  had been freely tendered him, and to be to his country a king who would  respect and protect its liberties, its laws, and its religion.    With emotion, Louis Bonaparte declared himself ready to accept this  crown, and to be a good and true ruler to his new country.    And to keep this oath faithfully was from this time the single and  sacred endeavor to which he devoted his every thought and energy. The  people of Holland having chosen him to be their king, he was determined  to do honor to their choice; having been compelled to give up his own  country and nationality, he determined to belong to his new country with  his whole heart and being--to become a thorough Hollander, as he could  no longer remain a Frenchman.    This heretofore so gentle and passive nature now developed an entirely  new energy; this dreamer, this pale, silent brother of the emperor, was  now suddenly transformed into a bold, self-reliant man of action, who  had fixed his gaze on a noble aim, and was ready to devote all the  powers of his being to its attainment. As King of Holland, he desired,  above all, to be beloved by his subjects, and to be able to contribute  to their welfare and happiness. He studied their language with untiring  diligence, and made himself acquainted with their manners and customs,  for the purpose of making them his own. He investigated the sources of  their wealth and of their wants, and sought to develop the former and  relieve the latter. He was restless in his efforts to provide for his  country, and to merit the love and confidence which his subjects  bestowed on him.    His wife also exerted herself to do justice to her new and glittering  position, and to wear worthily the crown which she had so unwillingly  accepted. In her drawing-rooms she brought together, at brilliant  entertainments, the old aristocracy and the new nobility of Holland, and  taught the stiff society of that country the fine, unconstrained tone,  and the vivacious intellectual conversation of Parisian society. It was  under Hortense's fostering hand that art and science first made their  way into the aristocratic parlors of Holland, giving to their social  reunions a higher and nobler importance.    And Hortense was not only the protectress of art and science, but also  the mother of the poor, the ministering angel of the unhappy, whose  tears she dried, and whose misery she alleviated--and this royal pair,  though adored and blessed by their subjects, could not find within their  palaces the least reflection of the happiness they so well knew how to  confer upon others without its walls. Between these two beings, so  gentle and yielding to others, a strange antipathy continued to exist,  and not even the birth of a second, and of a third, son could fill up  the chasm that separated them.    And this chasm was soon to be broadened by a new blow of destiny.  Hortense's eldest, the adopted son of Napoleon, the presumptive heir to  his throne, the child that Napoleon loved so dearly that he often played  with him for hours on the terraces of St. Cloud, the child Josephine  worshipped, because its existence seemed to assure her own happiness,  the child that had awakened the first feeling of motherly bliss in  Hortense's bosom, the child that had often even consoled Louis Bonaparte  for the unenjoyable present with bright hopes for the"]]]
