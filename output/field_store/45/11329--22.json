In Kansas City, where Field went from St. Louis to assume at thirty  years of age the managing editorship of the Times of that town, the  family lived in a rented house which was made the rendezvous for all  the light-hearted members of the newspaper and theatrical professions.  Perhaps I cannot give a more faithful picture of Field's life through  all this period than is contained in the following unpublished lines,  to the original manuscript of which I supplied the title, \"The Good  Knight and His Lady.\" Perhaps I should explain that it was written at  a time when Field was infatuated with the stories and style of the  early English narratives of knights and ladies:      _THE GOOD KNIGHT AND HIS LADY      Soothly there was no lady faire    In all the province could compare          With Lady Julia Field,    The noble knight's most beauteous wife    For whom at any time his life          He would righte gladly yield.      'Twas at a tourney in St. Joe    The good knight met her first, I trow,          And was enamoured, straight;    And in less time than you could say    A pater noster he did pray          Her to become his mate.      And from the time she won his heart,    She sweetly played her wifely part--          Contented with her lot!    And tho' the little knightly horde    Came faster than they could afford          The good wife grumbled not.      But when arrived a prattling son,    She simply said, \"God's will be done--          This babe shall give us joy!\"    And when a little girl appeared,    The good wife quoth: \"'Tis well--I feared          'Twould be another boy!\"      She leased her castle by the year--    Her tables groaned with sumptuous cheer,          As epicures all say;    She paid her bills on Tuesdays, when    On Monday nights that best of men--          Her husband--drew his pay.      And often, when the good knight craved    A dime wherewith he might get shaved,          She doled him out the same;    For these and other generous deeds    The good and honest knight must needs          Have loved the kindly dame.      At all events, he never strayed    From those hymeneal vows he made          When their two loves combined;    A matron more discreet than she    Or husband more devote than he          It would be hard to find.      July 4th, 1885._    And so in very sooth it would have been. Under what circumstances and  with what purpose Field wrote this I cannot now recall, if I ever  knew. Nothing like it exists among my many manuscripts of his. It is  written in pencil on what appears to be a sheet from a pad of ledger  paper, watermarked \"1879,\" a fact I mention for the benefit of his  bibliomaniac admirers. And, what is most peculiar, it is written on  both sides of the sheet--something most unusual with Field, except in  correspondence--where the economy of the old half ounce three-cent  postage and his New England training prevailed over his disposition to  be lavish with paper if not with ink. Anyway, Field's \"Good Knight and  His Lady\" gives a clearer insight into his home relations than any  other thing that has been preserved respecting them. That it was  prepared with care is witnessed by several interlineations in ink,  sealed by a blot of his favorite red ink on the corner, which for a  wonder does not bear the marks of the deliberate blemishes with which  he frequently embellished his neatest manuscripts.          CHAPTER VIII    EARLY EXPERIENCES IN JOURNALISM      Although Eugene Field made his first essay in journalism as a reporter,  there is not the shadow of a tradition that he made any more progress  along the line of news-gathering and descriptive writing than he did as  a student at Williams. He had too many grotesque fancies dancing  through his whimsical brain to make account or \"copy\" of the plain  ordinary facts that for the most part make up the sum of the news of  the average reporter's day. What he wrote for the St. Louis Journal or  Times-Journal, therefore, had little relation to the happening he was  sent out to report, but from the outset it possessed the quality that  attracted readers. The peculiarities and not the conventions of life  appealed to him and he devoted himself to them with an assiduity that  lasted while he lived. Thus when he was sent by the Journal to  Jefferson City to report the proceedings of the Missouri State  Legislature, what his paper got was not an edifying summary of that  unending grist of mostly irrelevant and immaterial legislation through  the General Assembly hopper, but a running fire of pungent comment on  the Idiosyncrasies of its officers and members. He would attach himself  to the legislators whose personal qualities afforded most profitable  ammunition for sport in print. He shunned the sessions of Senate and  House and held all night sessions of story and song with the choice  spirits to be found on the floors and in the lobbies of every western  legislature. I wonder why I wrote \"western\" when the species is as  ubiquitous in Maine as in Colorado? From such sources Field gleaned the  infinite fund of anecdote and of character-study which eventually made  him the most sought-for boon companion that ever crossed the lobby of  a legislature or of a state capital hotel in Missouri, Colorado, or  Illinois. He was a looker-on in the legislative halls, and right  merrily he lampooned everything he saw. Nothing was too trivial for  his notice, nothing so serious as to escape his ridicule or satire.    There was little about his work at this time that gave promise of  anything beyond the spicy facility of a quick-witted, light-hearted  western paragrapher. Looking back it is possible, however, to  discover something of the flavor of the inextinguishable drollery  that persisted to his last printed work in such verses as these in  the St. Louis Journal:      _THE NEW BABY      We welcome thee, eventful morn    Since to the poet there is born          A son and heir;    A fuzzy babe of rosy hue,    And staring eyes of misty blue          Sans teeth, sans hair.      Let those who know not wedded joy    Revile this most illustrious boy--          This genial child!    But let the brother poets raise    Their songs and chant their sweetest lays          To him reviled.      Then strike, O bards, your tuneful lyres,    'Awake, O rhyming souls, your fires,          And use no stint!    Bring forth the festive syrup cup--    Fill every loyal beaker up          With peppermint!      March, 1878._    In the spring of 1879 the St. Louis Times-Journal printed the following  April verses by Field, which were copied without the author's name by  London Truth, and went the rounds of the papers in this country,  credited to that misnamed paper, and attributed, much to Field's glee,  to William S. Gilbert, then at the height of his Pinafore and Bab  Ballad fame:      _APRIL VESPERS      The turtles drum in the pulseless bay,      The crickets creak in the prickful hedge,      The bull-frogs boom in the puddling sedge    And the whoopoe whoops its vesper lay                          Away    In the twilight soft and gray.      Two lovers stroll in the glinting gloam--      His hand in her'n and her'n in his--      She blushes deep--he is talking biz--    They hug and hop as they listless roam--                          They roam--    It's late when they get back home.      Down by the little wicket-gate,      Down where the creepful ivy grows,      Down where the sweet nasturtium blows,    A box-toed parent lies in wait--                          In wait    For the maiden and her mate.      Let crickets creak and bull-frogs boom,      The whoopoe wail in the distant dell--      Their tuneful throbs will ne'er dispel    The planted pain and the rooted gloom--                          The gloom    Of the lover's dismal doom._    Just by the way of illustrating in fac-simile and preserving the  character of the newspaper paragrapher's work in the last century, the  following \"Funny Fancies,\" by Field, from the St. Louis Journal of  August 3d, 1878, may be of interest:      A green Christmas--No, no, we mean a green peach makes a fat    graveyard.      A philanthropic citizen of Memphis has wedded a Miss Hoss. He doubtless    took her for wheel or whoa.      We have tried every expedient and we find that the simple legend:    \"Smallpox in this House\" will preserve the most uninterrupted bliss in    an editorial room.      There is a moment when a man's soul revolts against the dispensations    of Providence, and that is when he finds that his wife has been using    his flannel trousers to wrap up the ice in.      To the average Athenian the dearest spot on earth is the Greece spot.      Mr. Deer was hung at Atlanta. Of course he died game.      'Tis pleasant at the close of day          To play          Croquet.      And if your partner makes a miss          Why kiss          The siss.      But if she gives your chin a thwack,          Why whack          Her back!      A great many newspaper men lie awake night after night mentally    debating whether they will leave their property to some charitable    institution or spend it the next day for something with a little lemon    in it.    It was during his earlier connection with the St. Louis Journal that  Field was assigned the duty of misreporting Carl Schurz, when that  peripatetic statesman stumped Missouri in 1874 as a candidate for  re-election to the United States Senate. Field in later years paid  unstinted tribute to the logic, eloquence, and patriotic force of Mr.  Schurz's futile appeals to the rural voters of Missouri. But during the  trip his reports were in nowise conducive to the success of the  Republican and Independent candidate. Mr. Schurz's only remonstrances  were, \"Field, why will you lie so outrageously?\" It was only by the  exercise of careful watchfulness that Mr. Schurz's party was saved from  serious compromise through the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12985"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions — Volume 2 (#18)"],[1,"went to pay for their printing; and as Field started for Europe before  they were received from Cambridge, the task of numbering them, as well  as the cost of forwarding them to subscribers, fell to my lot.    These two books contained not only the best of what Field had written  up to that time, but their contents were selected with such care that  they continue to represent the best he ever wrote. Much that he  rejected at that time went to make up subsequent volumes of his works.  The popular editions from the subscription plates of \"A Little Book  of Western Verse\" and \"A Little Book of Profitable Tales\" had a  phenomenal sale, and made a handsome return in royalties to him who  sent them forth with the words:      _\"Go, little book; and if any one would speak thee ill, let him    bethink him that thou art the child of one who loves thee well.\"_          CHAPTER VI    HIS SECOND VISIT TO EUROPE      From 1889 Field's life was one long struggle with dyspepsia, an  inherited weakness which he persisted in aggravating by indulgence in  those twin enemies of health--pastry and reading in bed. During our  intimate association I had exercised a wholesome restraint on his pie  habit and reduced his hours of reading in bed to a minimum. As the  reader may remember, our pact concerned eating and walking. When we  ate, we talked, and while we walked, Field could not lie in bed  browsing amid his favorite books, burning illuminating gas and the  candle of life at the same time. So long as his study of life was  pursued among men he retained his health. As soon as he began to  retire more and more to the companionship of books and from the daily  activities and associations of the newspaper office his assimilation  of food failed to nourish his body as it did his brain. The buoyancy  went out of his step, but never out of his mind and heart.    As intimated in his letter to Mr. Gray, the publisher of the Daily  News grew so solicitous over Field's health that he proposed a three  months' European vacation, with pay, whenever he chose to take it. At  first it was not Field's intention to avail himself of this generous  offer until winter. But when his \"Little Books\" were safely under way  he changed his mind and decided to start as soon as he could arrange  his household affairs. In a letter to his friend Cowen, then in  London, under date of June 11th, 1889, Field wrote:      Trotty is delighted with the illustrated paper, and she is going to    write you a letter, I think. Melvin is on the Indiana farm again    this summer, and Pinny is visiting his Aunt Etta [Mrs. Roswell    Field] in Kansas City. The rest of us are boarding with Mr. and Mrs.    Reed, and the house is full of friends. We like our quarters very    much, but shall give them up on the first of November, as Julia,    Trotty, and I will go to Europe in December. The present plan is to    go first to London, where I wish to spend most of my time. We shall    want to put Trotty in a school near Paris, and her mother will have    to make the tour of Italy. Mary French (who reared me) will be with    us, and she will go with Julia on the Italian circuit. As for me, I    want to spend most of my time in England, with two weeks in Paris    and a few days in Holland. Wouldn't it be wise for me to live in one    of the suburbs of London? I want to get cheap but desirable    quarters--a pleasant place, not fashionable, and _not too far from    the old-book shops_. My intention is to be absent three months, but    I may deem it wise to stay six. Julia and Trotty can stay as long as    they please. I should like to have Trotty learn French.      Matters and things here in the office peg along about as usual--yes,    just the same. The new building in the alley will be ready for    occupancy by the first of September, but I suspect it will not be    much of an improvement upon the present quarters. Dr. Reilly is the    same old 2 x 4. He got $250.00 for extra work the other day, and we    have been tolerably prosperous ever since. [Here Field branched off    into personal gossip about pretty nearly every one of their mutual    friends in Denver and Chicago, having something to say about no less    than nineteen persons in fourteen lines of his diamond chirography.]    It is nearly time for Stone [who had sold out his interest in the    Daily News to Mr. Lawson] to reach Paris. I wish you'd tell him that    I propose to *%!&[see Note below] him at billiards under the shadow    of St. Paul's in London next Christmas time. Dear boy, I am    overjoyed at the prospect of seeing you so soon. We speak of you so    often, and always affectionately. You may look for a package from me    about the 1st of August; I shall send it to the care of the Herald    office in Paris. I have dedicated to you what I regard as my    tenderest bit of western dialect verse, and I will send you a copy    of the paper when it appears. Meanwhile I enclose a little bit,    which you may fancy. God bless you.    [Transcriber's Note: The *%!& stands for \"expletive deleted\" and is  intentional.]    \"Marthy's Younkit\" is the bit of western dialect verse which was  dedicated to Cowen, of which Field then and always thought so highly.  It contained, in his estimation, more of imagination, as distinct from  fancy, than any of his other verse. The poetic picture of the  mountain-side is perfect:      _Where the magpies on the sollum rocks strange            flutter'n shadders make,    An' the pines an' hemlocks wonder that the            sleeper doesn't wake:    That the mountain brook sings lonesome-like            an' loiters on its way.    Ez if it waited for a child to jine it in its            play._    In another letter to Cowen about this time I find the first intimation  Field ever gave that he might have been tempted to leave his place on  the Daily News. He wrote, \"The San Francisco Examiner is making a hot  play to get me out there. Why doesn't Mr. Bennett try to seduce me  into coming to London? How I should like to stir up the dry bones!\"    Under date of Kansas City, June 28th, 1889, Field wrote with an  illuminated initial \"M\":      MY DEAR COWEN: Your cablegram reached me last night, having been    forwarded to me here, where I have been for a week. I send you    herewith \"The Conversazzhyony,\" which is one of three mountain poems    I have recently written: it has never been in print. The others,    unpublished, are \"Prof. Vere de Blaw\" (the character who plays the    piano in Casey's restaurant) and \"Marthy's Younkit\" (pathetic,    recounting the death and burial of the first child born in the    camp). The latter is the best piece of work, but inasmuch as you    call for something humorous I send the enclosed.    This letter went on to discuss the possibility of getting a position  on the London Herald for his brother Roswell, who desired to get out  of the rut of his general newspaper work on the Kansas City Times, and  Field confided to Cowen that \"there is no telling what might come of  having my brother in London\"--the intimation being that he might be  induced to stay there. But nothing came of either suggestion.    [Illustration: ROSWELL FIELD.]    Field's health was so miserable during the summer of 1889 that it was  decided best that he should begin his vacation in October instead of  waiting for December. On the eve of his departure he wrote to his old  friend Melvin L. Gray:      DEAR MR. GRAY: Had I not been so grievously afflicted with    dyspepsia, I should certainly have visited St. Louis before starting    for Europe. The attack of indigestion with which I am suffering    began last June, resulting from irregularity in hours of eating and    sleeping and from too severe application to work. The contemplated    voyage will do me good, I think, and I hope to gather much valuable    material while I am abroad. I shall seek to acquaint myself with    such local legends as may seem to be capable of treatment in verse.    Most of my time will be spent in London, in Paris, and in Holland. I    expect to find among the Dutch much to inspire me. I carry numerous    letters of introduction--all kinds of letters, except letters of    credit. I regret that the potent name of Rothschild will not figure    in the list of my trans-Atlantic acquaintances. I am exceedingly    sorry that Roswell is not to go with us: with me he would have had    advantages at his command which he cannot have when he goes alone. I    am looking daily for my books; I rather regret now that I did not    print a larger edition, for a great many demands are coming in from    outsiders. I should like to publish a volume of my paraphrases of    Horace while I am in London, and maybe I shall do so. Do give my    love to Mrs. Gray and Mrs. Bacon. I think of you all very often, and    nothing would give me greater delight than to pop in upon you and    have a two hours' chat in that old familiar second-story back room.    It may be, Mr. Gray, that you and I shall never take one another by    the hand again, but I wish you to know that I shall always think of    you with feelings of gratitude, of affection, and of reverence. And    I feel a particular pleasure in saying these words to you upon the    eve of my departure upon a journey which is to separate me at least    temporarily from the home, the people, and the associations which    must always be foremost in my affections. God bless you.      As ever, yours,        EUGENE FIELD. Chicago, September the 30th, 1889.    When Field arrived in London Cowen was away on the Continent, much to  the disappointment of all concerned--especially the three boys, who at  the last moment had been brought along. On October 24th Field wrote:      MY DEAR COWEN: Knowing that you will be anxious to know how we are    getting along. I drop you this line to tell you that we have taken    lodgings at No. 20 Alfred Place, Bedford Square, and we are quite    contented. I have"]]]
