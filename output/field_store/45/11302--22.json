But in so far as  remission occurs in the world, it has its place only in majesty and is  due only to its arbitrary decision.      THE EXECUTIVE    The main point upon which the function of the government depends is the  division of labor. This division is concerned with the transition from  the universal to the particular and the individual; and the business is  to be divided according to the different branches. The difficulty lies  in harmonizing the superior and the inferior functions. For some time  past the main effort has been spent in organizing from above, the lower  and bulky part of the whole being left more or less unorganized; yet it  is highly important that it should become organic, for only thus is it a  power and a force; otherwise it is but a heap or mass of scattered  atoms. Authoritative power resides only in the organic state of the  particular spheres.    The State cannot count on service which is capricious and voluntary (the  administration of justice by knights-errant, for instance), precisely  because it is capricious and voluntary. Such service presupposes acting  according to subjective opinion, and also the possibility of neglect and  of the realization of private ends. The opposite extreme to the  knight-errant in reference to public service would be the State-servant  who was attached to his task solely by want, without genuine duty and  right.    The efficiency of the State depends upon individuals, who, however, are  not entitled to carry on the business of the State through natural  fitness, but according to their objective qualification. Ability, skill,  character, belong to the particular nature of the individual; for a  particular office, however, he must be specially educated and trained.  An office in the State can, therefore, be neither sold nor bequeathed.    Public service demands the sacrifice of independent self-satisfaction  and the giving up of the pursuit of private ends, but grants the right  of finding these in dutiful service, and in it only. Herein lies the  unity of the universal and the particular interests which constitutes  the concept and the inner stability of the State.    The members of the executive and the officials of the State form the  main part of the middle class which represents the educated intelligence  and the consciousness of right of the mass of a people. This middle  class is prevented by the institutions of sovereignty from above and the  rights of corporation from below, from assuming the exclusive position  of an aristocracy and making education and intelligence the means for  caprice and despotism. Thus the administration of justice, whose object  is the proper interest of all individuals, had at one time been  perverted into an instrument of gain and despotism, owing to the fact  that the knowledge of the law was hidden under a learned and foreign  language, and the knowledge of legal procedure under an involved  formalism.    In the middle class, to which the State officials belong, resides the  consciousness of the State and the most conspicuous cultivation: the  middle class constitutes therefore the ground pillar of the State in  regard to uprightness and intelligence. The State in which there is no  middle class stands as yet on no high level.      THE LEGISLATURE    The legislature is concerned with the interpretation of the laws and  with the internal affairs of the State, in so far as they have a  universal content. This function is itself a part of the constitution  and thus presupposes it. Being presupposed, the constitution lies, to  that degree, outside the direct province of the legislature, but in the  forward development of the laws and the progressive character of the  universal affairs of government, the constitution receives its  development also.    The constitution must alone be the firm ground on which the legislature  stands; hence it must not be created for purposes of legislation. But  the constitution not only is, its essence is also to _become_--that is,  it progresses with the advance of civilization. This progress is an  alteration which is imperceptible, but has not the form of an  alteration. Thus, for example, the emperor was formerly judge, and went  about the empire administering justice. Through the merely apparent  advance of civilization it has become practically necessary that the  emperor should gradually yield his judicial function to others, and thus  came about the transition of the judicial function from the person of  the prince to a body of judges; thus the progress of any condition is an  apparently calm and imperceptible one. In this way and after a lapse of  time a constitution attains a character quite different from what it had  before.    In the legislative power as a whole are operative both the monarchical  element and the executive. To the former belongs the final decision; the  latter as advisory element possesses concrete knowledge, perspective  over the whole in all its ramifications, and acquaintance with the  objective principles and wants of the power of the State. Finally, in  the legislature the different classes or estates are also active. These  classes or estates represent in the legislature the element of  subjective formal freedom, the public consciousness, the empirical  totality of the views and thought of the many.    The expression \"The Many\" [Greek: oi polloi] characterizes the empirical  totality more correctly than the customary word \"All.\" Though one may  reply that, under this \"all,\" children, women, etc., are obviously meant  to be excluded, yet it is more obvious that the definite expression  \"all\" should not be used when something quite indefinite is in question.    There are, in general, current among the public so unspeakably many  distorted and false notions and phrases about the people, the  constitution, and the classes, that it would be a vain task to mention,  explain, and correct them. The prevalent idea concerning the necessity  and utility of an assembly of estates amounts to the assumption that the  people's deputies, nay, the people itself, best understand what would  promote the common weal, and that they have indubitably the good will to  promote it. As for the first point, the case is just the reverse. The  people, in so far as this term signifies a special part of the citizens,  stands precisely for the part that does not know what it wills. To know  what one wills, and, what is more difficult, to know what the absolute  will, viz., reason, wills, is the fruit of deep knowledge and insight;  and that is obviously not a possession of the people. As for the  especially good will, which the classes are supposed to have for the  common good, the usual point of view of the masses is the negative one  of suspecting the government of a will which is evil or of little good.    The attitude of the government toward the classes must not be  essentially a hostile one. Belief in the necessity of this hostile  relation is a sad mistake. The government is not one party in opposition  to another, so that both are engaged in wresting something from each  other. When the State is in such a situation it is a misfortune and not  a mark of health. Furthermore, the taxes, for which the classes vote,  are not to be looked upon as gifts, but are consented to for the best  interests of those consenting. What constitutes the true meaning of the  classes is this--that through them the State enters into the subjective  consciousness of the people and thus the people begin to share in the  State.    In despotic countries, where there are only princes and people, the  people assert themselves, whenever they act, as a destructive force  directed against the organization, but the masses, when they become  organically related to the State, obtain their interests in a lawful and  orderly way. When this organic relation is lacking, the self-expression  of the masses is always violent; in despotic States the despot shows,  therefore, indulgence for his people, and his rage is always felt by  those surrounding him. Moreover, the people of a despotic State pay  light taxes, which in a constitutional State are increased through the  very consciousness of the people. In no other country are taxes so heavy  as they are in England.    There exists a current notion to the effect that, since the private  class is raised in the legislature to a participation in the universal  cause, it must appear in the form of individuals--either that  representatives are chosen for the function, or that every individual  exercises a vote. This abstract atomic view prevails neither in the  family nor in civic society, in both of which the individual appears  only as a member of a universal. The State, however, is in essence an  organization of members, and these members are themselves spheres; in it  no element shall show itself as an unorganized mass. The many, as  individuals, whom one chooses to call the people, are indeed a  collection, but only as a multitude, a formless mass, whose movement and  action would be elemental, irrational, savage, and terrible.    The concrete State is the whole, organized into its particular spheres,  and the member of the State is a member of such a particular class.  Only in this objective determination can the individual find recognition  in the State. Only in his cooeperate capacity, as member of the community  and the like, can the individual first find a real and vital place in  the universal. It remains, of course, open to him to rise through his  skill to any class for which he can qualify himself, including even the  universal class.    It is a matter of great advantage to have among the delegates  representatives of every special branch of society, such as trade,  manufacture, etc.--individuals thoroughly familiar with their branch and  belonging to it.

Barring the fact that the  roads were soft in places, the afternoon's ride was delightful,  the roads being generally very good.    It was about five o'clock when we came to the top of the hills  overlooking Geneva and the silvery lake beyond. It was a sight not  to be forgotten by the American traveller, for this country has  few towns so happily situated as the village of Geneva,--a cluster  of houses against a wooded slope with the lake like a mirror  below.    The little hotel was almost new and very good; the rooms were  large and comfortable. There was but one objection, and that the  location at the very corner of the busiest and noisiest streets.  But Geneva goes to bed early,--even on Saturday nights,--and by  ten or eleven o'clock the streets were quiet, while on Sunday  mornings there is nothing to disturb one before the bells ring for  church.    We were quite content to rest this first Sunday out.    It was so delightfully quiet all the morning that we lounged about  and read until dinner-time. In the afternoon a walk, and in the  evening friends came to supper with us. In a moment of ambitious  emulation of metropolitan customs the small hotel had established  a roof garden, with music two or three evenings a week, but the  innovation had not proven profitable; the roof remained with some  iron framework that once supported awnings, several disconsolate  tables, and some lonesome iron chairs; we visited this scene of  departed glory and obtained a view of the lake at evening.    The irregular outlines of the long shadows of the hills stretched  far out over the still water; beyond these broken lines the  slanting rays of the setting sun fell upon the surface of the  lake, making it to shine like a mass of burnished silver.    Some white sails glimmered in the light far across; near by we  caught the sound of church-bells; the twilight deepened, the  shadows lengthened, the luminous stretch of water grew narrower  and narrower until it disappeared entirely and all was dark upon  the lake, save here and there the twinkle of lights from moving  boats,--shifting stars in the void of night.    The morning was bright as we left Geneva, but the roads, until we  struck the State road, were rough and still muddy from the recent  rains.    It was but a short run to Auburn, and from there into Syracuse the  road is a fine gravel.    The machine had developed a slight pounding and the rear-axle  showed signs of again parting at the differential.    After luncheon the machine was run into a machine shop, and three  hours were spent in taking up the lost motion in the eccentric  strap, at the crank-pin, and in a loose bushing.    On opening up the differential gear case both set-screws holding  the axles were found loose. The factory had been most emphatically  requested to put in larger keys so as to fit the key-ways snugly  and to lock these set-screws in some way--neither of these things  had been done; and both halves of the rear-axle were on the verge  of working out.    Small holes were bored through the set-screws, wires passed  through and around the shoulders of the gears, and we had no  further trouble from this source.    It was half-past five before we left Syracuse for Oneida. The road  is good, and the run of twenty-seven miles was made in little over  two hours, arriving at the small, old-fashioned tavern in Oneida  at exactly seven forty-five.    A number of old-timers dropped into the hotel office that evening  to see what was going on and hear about the strange machine. Great  stories were exchanged on all sides; the glories of Oneida quite  eclipsed the lesser claims of the automobile to fame and  notoriety, for it seemed that some of the best known men of New  York and Chicago were born in the village or the immediate  vicinity; the land-marks remain, traditions are intact, the men  departed to seek their fortunes elsewhere, but their successes are  the town's fame.    The genial proprietor of the hotel carried his seventy-odd years  and two hundred and sixty pounds quite handily in his  shirt-sleeves, moving with commendable celerity from office to  bar-room, supplying us in the front room with information and  those in the back with refreshment.    \"So you never heard that those big men were born in this locality.  That's strange; tho't ev'rybody knew that. Why 'Neida has produced  more famous men than any town same size in 'Merika,--Russell Sage,  General New,--comin'\" (to those in the bar-room); \"say, you  fellers, can't you wait?\" As he disappeared in the rear we heard  his rotund voice, \"What'll you take? Was jest tellin' that chap  with the threshin'-machine a thing or two about this country. Rye?  no, thet's Bourbon--the reel corn juice--ten years in wood--\"    \"Mixed across the street at the drug store--ha! ha! ha!\"  interrupted some one.    \"Don't be faceshus, Sam; this ain't no sody-fountin.\"    \"Where'd that feller cum frum with his steam pianer,--Syr'cuse?\"    \"Naw! Chicago.\"    \"Great cranberries! you don't say so,--all the way from Chicago!  When did he start?\"    \"Day 'fore yesterday,\" replied the old man, and we could hear him  putting back the bottles; a chorus of voices,--    \"What!\"    \"Holy Mo--\"    \"Day afore yester--say, look here, you're jokin'.\"    \"Mebbe I am, but if you don't believe it, ask him.\"    \"Why Chicago is further'n Buf'lo--an' that's faster'n a train.\"    \"Yes,\" drawled the old man; \"he passed the Empire Express th'  other side Syr'cuse.\"    \"Get out.\"    \"What do you take us fer?\"    \"Wall, when you cum in, I took you fer fellers who knowed the  diff'rence betwixt whiskey and benzine, but I see my mistake. You  fellers shud buy your alc'hol across the way at the drug store; it  don't cost s' much, and burns better.\"    \"Thet's one on us. Your whiskey is all right, grandpa, the reel  corn juice--ten year in wood--too long in bottl'spile if left over  night, so pull the stopper once more.\"          CHAPTER TEN THE MOHAWK VALLEY  IN THE VALLEY    On looking over the machine the next morning, Tuesday, the 27th,  the large cap-screws holding the bearings of the main-shaft were  found slightly loose. The wrench with the machine was altogether  too light to turn these screws up as tight as they should be; it  was therefore necessary to have a wrench made from tool steel;  that required about half an hour, but it was time well spent.    The road from Oneida to Utica is very good; rolling but no steep  grades; some sand, but not deep; some clay, but not rough; for the  most part gravel.    The run of twenty miles was quickly made. We stopped only for a  moment to inquire for letters and then on to Herkimer by the road  on the north side of the valley. Returning some weeks later we  came by the south road, through Frankford, between the canal and  the railroad tracks, through Mohawk and Ilion. This is the better  known and the main travelled road; but it is far inferior to the  road on the north; there are more hills on the latter, some of the  grades being fairly steep, but in dry weather the north road is  more picturesque and more delightful in every way, while in wet  weather there is less deep mud.    At Herkimer, eighteen and one-half miles from Utica and  thirty-eight from Oneida, we had luncheon, then inquired for  gasoline. Most astonishing! in the entire village no gasoline to be  had. A town of most respectable size, hotel quite up to date, large  brick blocks of stores, enterprise apparent--but no gasoline. Only  one man handled it regularly, an old man who drove about the country  with his tank-wagon distributing kerosene and gasoline; he had no  place of business but his house, and he happened to be entirely out  of gasoline. In two weeks the endurance run of the Automobile Club  of America would be through there; at Herkimer those in the contest  were to stop for the night,--and no gasoline.    In the entire pilgrimage of over two thousand miles through nine  States and the province of Ontario, we did not find a town or  village of any size where gasoline could not be obtained, and  frequently we found it at cross-road stores,--but not at Herkimer.    Happily there was sufficient gasoline in the tank to carry us on;  besides, we always had a gallon in reserve. At the next village we  found all we needed.    When we returned through Herkimer some weeks later nearly every  store had gasoline.    If hotels, stables, and drug stores, wherever automobiles are apt  to come, would keep a five-gallon can of gasoline on hand, time  and trouble would be saved, and drivers of automobiles would be  only too glad to pay an extra price for the convenience.    The grades of gasoline sold in this country vary from the common  so-called \"stove gasoline,\" or sixty-eight, to seventy-four.    The country dealers are becoming wise in their generation, and all  now insist they keep only seventy-four. As a matter of fact nearly  all that is sold in both"]]]
