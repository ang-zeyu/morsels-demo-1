But  foreign _chefs_ limit their efforts to those who can afford to pay  them for their services. The middle classes do not fall within the  pale of their beneficence. The poor know them not. So it happens that  even as I write, the greater part of the community not only cannot  afford professional assistance in the preparation of their meals,  which goes without saying, but from ignorance expend on their larder  twice as much as a Parisian or an Italian in the same rank of life,  with a very indifferent result. There are handbooks of instruction,  it is true, both for the middle and for the lower classes. These books  are at everybody's command. But they are either left unread, or if  read, they are not understood. I have before me the eleventh edition  of Esther Copley's \"Cottage Comforts,\" 1834; it embraces all the  points which demand attention from such as desire to render a humble  home comfortable and happy. The leaves have never been opened. I will  not say, _ex hoc disce omnes_; but it really appears to be the  case, that these works are not studied by those for whom they are  written--not studied, at all events, to advantage.    Dr. Kitchener augmented this department of our literary stores in  1821 with his \"Cook's Oracle,\" which was very successful, and passed  through a series of editions.    In the preface to that of 1831, the editor describes the book as  greatly enlarged and improved, and claims the \"rapid and steady sale  which has invariably attended each following edition\" as a proof  of the excellence of the work. I merely mention this, because in  Kitchener's own preface to the seventh issue, l2mo, 1823, he says:  \"This last time I have found little to add, and little to alter.\" Such  is human fallibility!    The \"Cook's Oracle\" was heralded by an introduction which very few  men could have written, and which represents the Doctor's method  of letting us know that, if we fancy him an impostor, we are much  mistaken. \"The following Recipes,\" says he, \"are not a mere marrowless  collection of shreds and patches, of cuttings and pastings--but a  bona-fide register of practical facts--accumulated by a perseverance,  not to be subdued or evaporated by the igniferous Terrors of a  Roasting Fire in the Dog-days:--in defiance of the odoriferous  and calefaceous repellents of Roasting, Boiling,--Frying, and  Broiling;--moreover, the author has submitted to a labour no preceding  Cookery-Book-maker, perhaps, ever attempted to encounter,--having  eaten each Receipt before he set it down in his Book.\"    What could critics say, after this? One or two large editions must  have been exhausted before they recovered their breath, and could  discover how the learned Kitchener set down the receipts which he had  previously devoured. But the language of the Preface helps to console  us for the loss of Johnson's threatened undertaking in this direction.    Dr. Kitchener proceeded on different lines from an artist who closely  followed him in the order of publication; and the two did not probably  clash in the slightest degree. The cooking world was large enough to  hold Kitchener and the _ci-devant chef_ to the most Christian King  Louis XVI. and the Right Honourable the Earl of Sefton, Louis Eustache  Ude. Ude was steward to the United Service Club, when he printed his  \"French Cook\" in 1822. A very satisfactory and amusing account of this  volume occurs in the \"London Magazine\" for January 1825. But whatever  may be thought of Ude nowadays, he not only exerted considerable  influence on the higher cookery of his day, but may almost be said to  have been the founder of the modern French school in England.    Ude became _chef_ at Crockford's Club, which was built in 1827, the  year in which his former employer, the Duke of York, died. There is a  story that, on hearing of the Duke's illness, Ude exclaimed, \"Ah, mon  pauvre Duc, how much you shall miss me where you are gone!\"    About 1827, Mrs. Johnstone brought out her well-known contribution  to this section of literature under the title of \"The Cook and  Housewife's Manual,\" veiling her authorship under the pseudonym of  Mistress Margaret Dods, the landlady in Scott's tale of \"St. Ronan's  Well,\" which appeared three years before (8vo, 1824).    Mrs. Johnstone imparted a novel feature to her book by investing it  with a fictitious history and origin, which, like most inventions of  the kind, is scarcely consistent with the circumstances, however it  may tend to enliven the monotony of a professional publication.    After three prefaces in the fourth edition before me (8vo, 1829) we  arrive at a heading, \"Institution of the Cleikum Club,\" which narrates  how Peregrine Touchwood, Esquire, sought to cure his _ennui_ and  hypochondria by studying Apician mysteries; and it concludes with the  syllabus of a series of thirteen lectures on cookery, which were to  be delivered by the said Esquire. One then enters on the undertaking  itself, which can be readily distinguished from an ordinary manual by  a certain literary tone, which certainly betrays a little the hand or  influence of Scott.    But though the present is a Scottish production, there is no narrow  specialism in its scheme. The title-page gives a London publisher as  well as an Anglo-Athenian one, and Mrs. Johnstone benevolently adapted  her labours to her countrywomen and the unworthier Southrons alike.    I imagine, however, that of all the latter-day master-cooks, Alexis  Soyer is most remembered. His \"Gastronomic Regenerator,\" a large and  handsome octavo volume of between 700 and 800 pages, published in  1846, lies before me. It has portraits of the compiler and his wife,  and many other illustrations, and is dedicated to a Royal Duke. It was  produced under the most influential patronage and pressure, for Soyer  was overwhelmed with engagements, and had scruples against appearance  in print. He tells us that in some library, to which he gained access,  he once found among the works of Shakespeare and other _chefs_ in a  different department, a volume with the words \"Nineteenth Edition\"  upon it, and when he opened it, he saw to his great horror \"A receipt  for Ox-tail Soup!\" Why this revelation exercised such a terrifying  effect he proceeds to explain. It was the incongruity of a cookery  book in the temple of the Muses. But nevertheless, such is the frailty  of our nature, that he gradually, on regaining his composure, and at  such leisure intervals as he could command, prepared the \"Gastronomic  Regenerator,\" in which he eschewed all superfluous ornaments of  diction, and studied a simplicity of style germane to the subject;  perchance he had looked into Kitchener's Preface. He lets us know that  he had made collections of the same kind at an earlier period of his  career, but had destroyed them, partly owing to his arduous duties  at the Reform Club, and partly to the depressing influence of the  nineteenth edition of somebody else's cookery book--probably, by  the way, Ude's. The present work occupied some ten months, and was  prepared amid the most stupendous interruptions from fair visitors to  the Club (15,000), dinners for the members and their friends (25,000),  dinner parties of importance (38), and the meals for the staff (60).  He gives a total of 70,000 dishes; but it is not entirely clear  whether these refer to the 38 dinner parties of importance, or to  the 25,000 of inferior note, or to both. The feeling of dismay at the  nineteenth edition of somebody must have been sincere, for he winds  up his preface with an adjuration to his readers (whom, in the  \"Directions for Carving,\" he does not style Gentle, or Learned, or  Worshipful, but HONOURABLE) not to place his labours on the same shelf  with \"Paradise Lost.\"    Soyer had also perhaps certain misgivings touching too close an  approximation to other _chefs_ besides Milton and Shakespeare, for he  refers to the \"profound ideas\" of Locke, to which he was introduced,  to his vast discomfort, \"in a most superb library in the midst of a  splendid baronial hall.\" But the library of the Reform Club probably  contained all this heterogeneous learning. Does the \"Gastronomic  Regenerator,\" out of respect to the fastidious sentiments of its  author, occupy a separate apartment in that institution with a  separate curator?    It seems only the other day to me, that Soyer took Gore Lodge, and  seemed in a fair way to make his removal from the Reform Club a  prosperous venture. But he lost his wife, and was unfortunate in other  ways, and the end was very sad indeed. \"Soyez tranquille,\" was the  epitaph proposed at the time by some unsentimental wagforpoor Madame  Soyer; it soon served for them both.    But nearly concurrent with Soyer's book appeared one of humble  pretensions, yet remarkable for its lucidity and precision, Eliza  Acton's \"Modern Cookery in all its Branches reduced to an easy  practice,\" 16mo, 1845. I have heard this little volume highly  commended by competent judges as exactly what it professes to be; and  the quantities in the receipts are particularly reliable.    The first essay to bring into favourable notice the produce of  Colonial cattle was, so far as I can collect, a volume published  in 1872, and called \"Receipts for Cooking Australian Meat, with  Directions for preparing Sauces suitable for the same.\" This  still remains a vexed question; but the consumption of the meat  is undoubtedly on the increase, and will continue to be, till the  population of Australasia equalises supply and demand.

There the balance on salaries was  paid and we carried with us only enough money for our daily needs.    Before we left Yün-nan Fu we were assured by the Foreign Office that we  would be furnished with a guard of soldiers--an honor few foreigners  escape! The first day out we had four, all armed with umbrellas! These  accompanied us to the first camp where they delivered their official  message to the _yamen_ and intrusted us to the care of others for our next  day's journey.    Sometimes they were equipped with guns of the vintage of 1872, but their  cartridges were seldom of the same caliber as the rifles and in most cases  the ubiquitous umbrella was their only weapon. Just what good they would be  in a real attack it is difficult to imagine, except to divert attention by  breaking the speed limits in running away.    Several times in the morning we believed we had escaped them but they  always turned up in an hour or two. They were not so much a nuisance as an  expense, for custom requires that each be paid twenty cents (Mexican) a day  both going and returning. They are of some use in lending an official  aspect to an expedition and in requisitioning anything which may be needed;  also they act as an insurance policy, for if a caravan is robbed a claim  can be entered against the government, whereas if the escort is refused the  traveler has no redress.    It is amusing and often irritating to see the cavalier way in which these  men treat other caravans or the peasants along the road. Waving their arms  and shouting oaths they shoo horses, mules or chairs out of the way  regardless of the confusion into which the approaching caravan may be  thrown. They must also be closely watched for they are none too honest and  are prone to rely upon the moral support of foreigners to take whatever  they wish without the formality of payment.    We were especially careful to respect the property on which we camped and  to be just in all our dealings with the natives, but it was sometimes  difficult to prevent the _mafus_ or soldiers from tearing down fences for  firewood or committing similar depredations. Wherever such acts were  discovered we made suitable payment and punished the offenders by deducting  a part of their wages. Foreigners cannot respect too carefully the rights  of the peasants, for upon their conduct rests the reception which will be  accorded to all others who follow in their footsteps.          CHAPTER XI      TA-LI FU    On Friday, September 23, we were at Chou Chou and camped in a picturesque  little temple on the outskirts of the town. As the last stage was only six  hours we spent half the morning in taking moving pictures of the caravan  and left for Ta-li at eleven-thirty after an early _tiffin_.    About two o'clock in the afternoon we reached Hsia-kuan, a large commercial  town at the lower end of the lake. Its population largely consists of  merchants and it is by all means the most important business place of  interior Yün-nan; Ta-li, eight miles away, is the residence and official  city.    At Hsia-kuan we called upon the salt commissioner, Mr. Lui, to whom Mr.  Bode, the salt inspector at Yün-nan Fu, had very kindly telegraphed money  for my account, and after the usual tea and cigarettes we went on to Ta-li  Fu over a perfectly level paved road, which was so slippery that it was  well-nigh impossible for either horse or man to move over it faster than a  walk.    This was the hottest day of our experience in Northern Yün-nan, the  thermometer registering 85°+ in the shade, which is the usual mid-summer  temperature, but the moment the sun dropped behind the mountains it was  cool enough for one to enjoy a fire. Even in the winter it is never very  cold and its delightful summer should make Northern Yün-nan a wonderful  health resort for the residents of fever-stricken Burma and Tonking.    We rode toward Ta-li with the beautiful lake on our right hand and on the  other the Ts'ang Shan mountains which rise to a height of fourteen thousand  feet. As we approached the city we could see dimly outlined against the  foothills the slender shafts of three ancient pagodas. They were erected to  the _feng-shui_, the spirits of the \"earth, wind, and water,\" and for  fifteen hundred years have stood guard over the stone graves which, in  countless thousands, are spread along the foot of the mountains like a vast  gray blanket. In the late afternoon sunlight the walls of the city seemed  to recede before us and the picturesque gate loomed shadowy and unreal even  when we passed through its gloomy arch and clattered up the stone-paved  street.    We soon discovered the residence of Mr. H.G. Evans, agent of the British  American Tobacco Company, to whose care our first caravan had been  consigned, and he very hospitably invited us to remain with him while we  were in Ta-li Fu. This was only the beginning of Mr. Evans' assistance to  the Expedition, for he acted as its banker throughout our stay in Yün-nan,  cashing checks and transferring money for us whenever we needed funds.    The British American Tobacco Company and the Standard Oil Company of New  York are veritable \"oases in the desert\" for travelers because their  agencies are found in the most out-of-the-way spots in Asia and their  employees are always ready to extend the cordial hospitality of the East to  wandering foreigners.    Besides Mr. Evans the white residents of Ta-li Fu include the Reverend  William J. Hanna, his wife and two other ladies, all of the China Inland  Mission. Mr. Hanna is doing a really splendid work, especially along  educational and medical lines. He has built a beautiful little chapel, a  large school, and a dispensary in connection with his house, where he and  his wife are occupied every morning treating the minor ills of the natives,  Christian and heathen alike.    Ta-li Fu was the scene of tremendous slaughter at the time of the  Mohammedan war, when the Chinese captured the city through the treachery of  its commander and turned the streets to rivers of blood. The Mohammedans  were almost exterminated, and the ruined stone walls testify to the  completeness of the Chinese devastation.    The mandarin at Ta-li Fu was good-natured but dissipated and corrupt. He  called upon us the evening of our arrival and almost immediately asked if  we had any shotgun cartridges. He remarked that he had a gun but no shells,  and as we did not offer to give him any he continued to hint broadly at  every opportunity.    The mandarins of lower rank often buy their posts and depend upon what they  can make in \"squeeze\" from the natives of their district for reimbursement  and a profit on their investment. In almost every case which is brought to  them for adjustment the decision is withheld until the magistrate has  learned which of the parties is prepared to offer the highest price for a  settlement in his favor. The Chinese peasant, accepting this as the  established custom, pays the bribe without a murmur if it is not too  exorbitant and, in fact, would be exceedingly surprised if \"justice\" were  dispensed in any other way.    My personal relations with the various mandarins whom I was constantly  required to visit officially were always of the pleasantest and I was  treated with great courtesy. It was apparent wherever we were in China that  there was a total lack of antiforeign feeling in both the peasant and  official classes and except for the brigands, who are beyond the law,  undoubtedly white men can travel in perfect safety anywhere in the  republic. Before my first official visit Wu gave me a lesson in etiquette.  The Chinese are exceedingly punctilious and it is necessary to conform to  their standards of politeness for they do not realize, or accept in excuse,  the fact that Western customs differ from their own.    At the end of the reception room in every _yamen_ is a raised platform on  which the visitor sits at the _left hand_ of the mandarin; it would be  exceedingly rude for a magistrate to seat the caller on his right hand. Tea  is always served immediately but is not supposed to be tasted until the  official does so himself; the cup must then be lifted to the lips with both  hands. Usually when the magistrate sips his tea it is a sign that the  interview is ended. When leaving, the mandarin follows his visitor to the  doorway of the outer court, while the latter continually bows and protests  asking him not to come so far.    Ta-li Fu and Hsia-kuan are important fur markets and we spent some time  investigating the shops. One important find was the panda (_Aelurus  fulgens_). The panda is an aberrant member of the raccoon family but looks  rather like a fox; in fact the Chinese call it the \"fire fox\" because of  its beautiful, red fur. Pandas were supposed to be exceedingly rare and we  could hardly believe it possible when we saw dozens of coats made from  their skins hanging in the fur shops.    Skins of the huge red-brown flying squirrel, _Petaruista yunnanensis_, were  also used for clothing and the abundance of this animal was almost as great  a surprise as the finding of the pandas. This is often true in the case of  supposedly rare species. A few specimens may be obtained from the extreme  limits of its range, or from a locality where it really is rare, and for  years it may be almost unique in museum collections but eventually the  proper locality may be visited and the animals found to be abundant.    We saw several skins of the beautiful cat (_Felis temmicki_) which, with  the snow leopard (_Felis uncia_), it was said came from Tibet. Civets,  bears, foxes, and small cats were being used extensively for furs and  pangolins could be"]]]
