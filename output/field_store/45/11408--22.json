Dubury (_Mem. Soc. Phys. de  Geneve_, tom. ii. p. 406) has often found individuals in Cyclamen  hederaefolium, in which the base of the ovary was connected for a third  part of its length with the inferior part of the calyx.\"    \"M. Aug. St. Hilaire (Sur la Gynobase, _Mem. des Mus. d'Hist. Nat._,  tom. x. p. 134), speaking of some bushes of the Gomphia oleaefolia,  which he at first thought formed a quite distinct species, says: 'Voila  donc dans un meme individu des loges et un style qui se rattachent  tantot a un axe vertical, et tantot a un gynobase; donc celui-ci n'est  qu'un axe veritable; mais cet axe est deprime au lieu d'etre vertical.\"  He adds (p. 151), 'Does not all this indicate that nature has tried, in  a manner, in the family of Rutaceae to produce from a single  multilocular ovary, one-styled and symmetrical, several unilocular  ovaries, each with its own style.' And he subsequently shows that, in  Xanthoxylum monogynum, 'it often happens that on the same plant, on the  same panicle, we find flowers with one or with two ovaries;' and that  this is an important character is shown by the Rutaceae (to which  Xanthoxylum belongs), being placed in a group of natural orders  characterised by having a solitary ovary.\"    \"De Candolle has divided the Cruciferae into five sub-orders in  accordance with the position of the radicle and cotyledons, yet Mons. T.  Gay (_Ann. des Scien. Nat._, ser. i. tom. vii. p. 389) found in sixteen  seeds of Petrocallis Pyrenaica the form of the embryo so uncertain that  he could not tell whether it ought to be placed in the sub-orders  'Pleurorhizee' or 'Notor-hizee'; so again (p. 400) in Cochlearia  saxatilis M. Gay examined twenty-nine embryos, and of these sixteen were  vigorously 'pleurorhizees,' nine had characters intermediate between  pleuro-and notor-hizees, and four were pure notor-hizees.\"    \"M. Raspail asserts (_Ann. des Scien. Nat._, ser. i. tom. v. p. 440)  that a grass (Nostus Borbonicus) is so eminently variable in its floral  organisation, that the varieties might serve to make a family with  sufficiently numerous genera and tribes--a remark which shows that  important organs must be here variable.\"      _Species which vary little._    The preceding statements, as to the great amount of variation occurring  in animals and plants, do not prove that all species vary to the same  extent, or even vary at all, but, merely, that a considerable number of  species in every class, order, and family do so vary. It will have been  observed that the examples of great variability have all been taken from  common species, or species which have a wide range and are abundant in  individuals. Now Mr. Darwin concludes, from an elaborate examination of  the floras and faunas of several distinct regions, that common, wide  ranging species, as a rule, vary most, while those that are confined to  special districts and are therefore comparatively limited in number of  individuals vary least. By a similar comparison it is shown that species  of large genera vary more than species of small genera. These facts  explain, to some extent, why the opinion has been so prevalent that  variation is very limited in amount and exceptional in character. For  naturalists of the old school, and all mere collectors, were interested  in species in proportion to their rarity, and would often have in their  collections a larger number of specimens of a rare species than of a  species that was very common. Now as these rare species do really vary  much less than the common species, and in many cases hardly vary at all,  it was very natural that a belief in the fixity of species should  prevail. It is not, however, as we shall see presently, the rare, but  the common and widespread species which become the parents of new forms,  and thus the non-variability of any number of rare or local species  offers no difficulty whatever in the way of the theory of evolution.      _Concluding Remarks._    We have now shown in some detail, at the risk of being tedious, that  individual variability is a general character of all common and  widespread species of animals or plants; and, further, that this  variability extends, so far as we know, to every part and organ, whether  external or internal, as well as to every mental faculty. Yet more  important is the fact that each part or organ varies to a considerable  extent independently of other parts. Again, we have shown, by abundant  evidence, that the variation that occurs is very large in  amount--usually reaching 10 or 20, and sometimes even 25 per cent of the  average size of the varying part; while not one or two only, but from 5  to 10 per cent of the specimens examined exhibit nearly as large an  amount of variation. These facts have been brought clearly before the  reader by means of numerous diagrams, drawn to scale and exhibiting the  actual variations in inches, so that there can be no possibility of  denying either their generality or their amount. The importance of this  full exposition of the subject will be seen in future chapters, when we  shall frequently have to refer to the facts here set forth, especially  when we deal with the various theories of recent writers and the  criticisms that have been made of the Darwinian theory.    A full exposition of the facts of variation among wild animals and  plants is the more necessary, because comparatively few of them were  published in Mr. Darwin's works, while the more important have only been  made known since the last edition of _The Origin of Species_ was  prepared; and it is clear that Mr. Darwin himself did not fully  recognise the enormous amount of variability that actually exists. This  is indicated by his frequent reference to the extreme slowness of the  changes for which variation furnishes the materials, and also by his use  of such expressions as the following: \"A variety when once formed must  again, _perhaps after a long interval of time_, vary or present  individual differences of the same favourable nature as before\"  (_Origin_, p. 66). And again, after speaking of changed conditions  \"affording a better chance of the occurrence of favourable variations,\"  he adds: \"_Unless such occur natural selection can do nothing_\"  (_Origin_, p. 64). These expressions are hardly consistent with the fact  of the constant and large amount of variation, of every part, in all  directions, which evidently occurs in each generation of all the more  abundant species, and which must afford an ample supply of favourable  variations whenever required; and they have been seized upon and  exaggerated by some writers as proofs of the extreme difficulties in the  way of the theory. It is to show that such difficulties do not exist,  and in the full conviction that an adequate knowledge of the facts of  variation affords the only sure foundation for the Darwinian theory of  the origin of species, that this chapter has been written.

Having so fully discussed variation under nature it will be unnecessary  to devote so much space to domesticated animals and cultivated plants,  especially as Mr. Darwin has published two remarkable volumes on the  subject where those who desire it may obtain ample information. A  general sketch of the more important facts will, however, be given, for  the purpose of showing how closely they correspond with those described  in the preceding chapter, and also to point out the general principles  which they illustrate. It will also be necessary to explain how these  variations have been increased and accumulated by artificial selection,  since we are thereby better enabled to understand the action of natural  selection, to be discussed in the succeeding chapter.      _The facts of Variation and Artificial Selection._    Every one knows that in each litter of kittens or of puppies no two are  alike. Even in the case in which several are exactly alike in colours,  other differences are always perceptible to those who observe them  closely. They will differ in size, in the proportions of their bodies  and limbs, in the length or texture of their hairy covering, and notably  in their disposition.

Such image model is able to make a prediction but there  is no proof or reason for it (because an image model generates image-truths!).  There is just a feeling that such information is true. The symbolic model can  use this information to solve its problems. In this case, we speak about  intuition.    The intuition is similar to the extra-sensorial perceptions: we gain some  information without any explanation about the source of it and there is no  proof to support it. The difference is that an illegal model generates the  extra-sensorial information, and a normal image model, which is activated in a  normal symbolic frame, generates the intuition.    Note: everything which is associated to the consciousness is generated by the  local-ZM. In the case of intuition, the ZM is a symbolic one. When an image  model generates information, it is just transmitted to a symbolic local-ZM.  Because the consciousness is generated by the local-ZM, that ZM is not able to  find the source of the information, and the proof for it because it was not  generated by the ZM or by any normal model.    15. Consciousness    The consciousness is associated to the facility of a brain to make and operate  a model, which contains the being itself as an element.    Two types of consciousness exist: image consciousness and symbolic  consciousness. The absolute majority of the population has only image  consciousness. Also, on animal level, at least the mammals have some level of  image consciousness.    Level-1 of consciousness: on this level, the being is able to predict the  evolution of the external reality, based also on its activity in that external  reality. This facility ensures the success of the defense or attack activities  in interaction with the external reality.    Level-1 consciousness is generated by short-range models.    Level-2 of consciousness: this level occurs only in a group (some packs of  mammals, any human group...). To be accepted by that group, any being must  assimilate and operate a long-range model associated to that group. Such  beings must communicate with one another to meet the above requirements. For  humans only, long-range models generate the rules, the laws, the methods and  the aims of the group.    Level-3 of conciousness: on this level, a human being is able to predict the  evolution of the group, based on a model which contains the group as an  element, while he is a member of that group. The appartenence to the group is  a basic condition here.    There are few persons, which are able to reach this level. The effort of the  brain to stay on level-3 is huge. The persons who are able to stay on level 3  are the elite of the group. There are few direct personal advantages from  being on level-3, but without an elite, the group is a low quality group.    The advance of a society is given by the power given to the actual elite. It  is important to note that there are some positions in a society, which must  belong to the elite. Many times such positions are occupied by level-2  persons. This happens usually in a low quality group or society.      ETA 5: NULL model    Let's consider that an M-model transmits no information (e.g. our eyes are  closed). A local-ZM takes the information from that M-model. Because the M-  model transmits no information, the ZM must receive no information. What is  really received is called NULL-model. For a normal brain, in the above  condition, the local-ZM must receive a completely dark surface. What is really  received is an indication about the overall status of the brain.    For instance, in the above conditions, we can receive a dark surface with some  randomly moving points. That is, the local-ZM detects a bright point in a  place, but at the second scan the point is not there anymore. This means that  there is a noise, but no important hardware problems. A stable image is  generated by a hardware problem of M or ZM models.    Application: In the first seconds after wake up, with closed eyes, look  towards a moderately bright surface. Usually, one should perceive a dark  surface full of grey points moving randomly. After a few seconds, the surface  becomes a uniform dark-grey one. This is a typical situation for a brain in a  normal status.    It is also possible, in the first moments, to see big bright points or shapes,  moving randomly. They evolve to dark and small grey points, and then to a  uniform grey surface. In such a situation, the brain is not in a good shape  (maybe the person did not sleep enough...)    Anyways, if the final status of the NULL model is a uniform grey surface, the  brain is OK.    This case has been illustrated for the eyes, but NULL models exist for all  senses.      ETA 6: Time    Excepting when specified otherwise, the subject is the same for human and  animal beings.    Based on MDT, time is not a parameter for the functions of the brain. This is  a basic deficiency.    But there is a problem: as the brain predicts on and on the evolution of the  external reality, how often is this activity done?    Of course, this problem is associated to the technological implementation of  every type of brain, so it is outside the field covered by MDT. Even so, based  on MDT, we can make some assumptions.    Because the brain is an optimized device as to its energy consumption, we  assume that the predictions about the evolution of the external reality are  done at a speed which depends on the changing speed of the external reality.    That is, the brain time flows with variable speed. This is also our feeling  based on our own experience. For instance, when we are involved in a complex  activity, time seems to flow too fast and when we have nothing to do, time  seems to flow very slowly.    This is a big design drawback. Without time, the long-range models could be  inefficient or unusable. So, the brain is forced to compensate, somehow, this  drawback.    One method is to use story-type models. They are not able to keep the control  of time, but they are able to record the order of occurence of some  information. Even so, this method is not very efficient. A story-type model  could fragment. Once it is fragmented, the correlation between the primary  information is lost.    Note: when a story-type model is fragmented, there is the tendency to  reconnect the fragments, based on logic. Many times this reconstruction is  wrong, but the impression could be good.    The fragmentation of the story-type models can be seen when a person describes  a complex situation. During this activity, one could change the order of some  facts.    Another method, used by the brain to keep track of time, is to use some  rhythm-models. Such models are specialized models, which try to guess when  something will happen, based on what has already happened before.    For instance, if the brain receives a sequence of two sounds, a rhythm model  tries to guess when a third sound will occur. The supposition is that such  models try to find an algorithm, which will generate the sequence. Such  algorithm must be changed on and on, in a fast dynamical way, to predict  better and better when the next sound will occur.    Such rhythm-models can be used, e.g. to recognize the speech or to understand  music.    The rhythm-models are not able either to solve the time problem, but they are  able to solve some time-related problems associated to fast changing external  reality in the field of sounds.    Let's analyze a bit this problem. First of all, the rhythm-models are very  well developed for human beings, and they are of very low quality for animals.  One assumption would be that, compared to animals, the human brain has a very  high capacity to make and operate image models, and, due to this, the rhythm-  models are so good.    But, there are some other facts: the European civilization invented the  polyphonic music (the most advanced music). But the European civilization is  developing based on symbolic models. It is fair to suppose that symbolic  models support the rhythm image-models.    We can take into account another idea as well: as MDT considers that the  capacity to make and operate symbolic models is generated by a specialized  hardware (thus it cannot be produced by a normal evolution process), it is  possible that the capacity to make and operate rhythm models was added in the  same way. This supposition is supported by the fact that, while some animals  are able to make and operate some image models above the level of human  beings, their capacity to make rhythm models is unusually low.    The problem of the origin of the rhythm models is left open for the moment.    Another method to compensate for the time keeping deficiency is to record some  pattern-models of the external reality. That is, to record some information  based on many M-type models, to build a pattern-model at a specific moment of  time, and to recognize the pattern later.    Such a pattern could be associated with the function of different organs of  the being, or with some other information from outside the being.    The time problem is a big one for the brain. The brain will use any external  reference to keep the time as the day/night cycle, the movement of the sun and  moon and for humans only, clocks.      ETA 7: Music    Music is a long-range image model, which exists only for human beings. As a  newborn baby grows, firstly, speech appears (a symbolic model) and only later,  the qualities associated to understanding music. As music understanding  capabilities appear after the brain aquires the ability to build and operate  symbolic models, it is reasonable to suppose that the symbolic models support  the development of music. This idea is supported also by the fact that  European music (the most advanced in the construction of symbolic models) is  superior compared to any other music from the point of view of its complexity  (polyph"]]]
