Good-night, my angel. The clock is striking twelve; I want to go to  bed and read chap. ii. of the Second Epistle of St. Peter. I am now  doing that in a systematic way, and, when I have finished St. Peter,  at your recommendation I shall read the He-brews, which I do not know  at all as yet. May God's protection and blessing be with you all.    Your most faithful v.B.      Frankfort, July 3, 1851.    _My Pet_,--Day before yesterday I very thankfully received your letter  and the tidings that you are all well. But do not forget when you  write to me that the letters are opened not by me alone, but by all  sorts of postal spies, and don't berate particular persons so much in  them, for all that is immediately reported and debited to my account;  besides, you do people injustice. Concerning my appointment or  non-appointment I know nothing as yet, except what was told me when I  left; everything else is possibilities and surmises. The only  crookedness about the matter us far has been the government's silence  towards me, for it would have been only fair to let me know by this,  and officially at that, whether during next month I to live here or in  Pomerania with wife and child. Be careful in your remarks to every one  there, without exception, not to Massow alone; particularly in your  criticisms of individuals, for you have no idea what one experiences  in this respect after once becoming an object of surveillance; be  prepared to see warmed up with sauce, here or at Sans Souci, what you  may perhaps whisper to Charlotte[17] or Annie in the boscages or the  bathing-house. Forgive me for being so admonitory, but after your last  letter I have to take the diplomatic pruning-knife in hand a bit. Do  not write me anything that the police may not read and communicate to  King, ministers, or Rochow. If the Austrians and many other folks can  succeed in sowing distrust in our camp, they will thereby attain one  of the principal objects of their letter-pilfering. Day before  yesterday I took dinner at Wiesbaden, with Dewitz, and, with a mixture  of sadness and knowing wisdom, I inspected the scenes of past  foolishness. Would that it might please God to fill with His clear and  strong wine this vessel, in which at that time the champagne of  twenty-two-year-old youth sparkled uselessly away, leaving stale dregs  behind. Where and how may Isabella Loraine and Miss Russel be living  now? How many of those with whom I then flirted, tippled, and played  dice are now dead and buried! How many transformations has my view of  the world undergone in the fourteen years which have since elapsed,  while I always considered the existing one as alone correct! and how  much is now small to me which then appeared great, how much now  deserving of respect which I then ridiculed! How many a green bud  within us may still come to mature blossom and wither worthlessly away  before another period of fourteen years is over, in 1865, if we are  then still alive! I cannot realize how a person who is thoughtful and,  nevertheless, knows nothing or wishes to know nothing of God, can  endure giving a despised and tedious life, a life which is fleeting as  a stream, as a sleep, even as a blade of grass that soon withers; we  spend our years as in a babble of talk.    I do not know how I endured it in the past; if I should live now as I  did then, without God, without you, without children, I should, in  fact, be at a loss to know why I should not cast off this life like a  soiled shirt; and yet most of my acquaintances are thus, and they  live. If in the case of some one individual I ask myself what reason  he can have, in his own mind, for continuing to live, to toil, to  fret, to intrigue, and to spy--verily I do not know. Do not conclude  from this scribbling that I happen to be in a particularly black mood;  on the contrary, I feel as when, on a beautiful September day, one  contemplates the yellowing foliage; healthy and gay, but a little  sadness, a little homesickness, a longing for woods, lake, meadow, you  and the children, all mingled with the sunset and a Beethoven  symphony. Instead of that I must now call upon tiresome serene  Highnesses and read endless figures about German sloops of war and  cannon-yawls which are rotting at Bremerhaven and devouring  cash. * * * Farewell, my beloved heart. Much love to our parents, and  God keep you all.    Your most faithful v.B.      Frankfort, July 8, 1851.    _My Darling_,--Yesterday and today I wished very much to write to you,  but owing to a hurly burly of business I have not been able to do so  till now, late in the evening, after returning from a walk during  which, in the charming summer-night's air, with moonlight and the  rustling of poplar-leaves, I have brushed off the dust of the day's  documents. On Saturday, in the afternoon, I went with Rochow and Lynar  to Ruedesheim, hired a boat there, rowed out on the Rhine, and swam in  the moonlight, nothing but nose and eyes over the tepid water, as far  as the Mouse Tower near Bingen, where the wicked bishop met his death.  There is something strangely dreamlike in thus lying in the water on a  quiet, warm night, carried gently along by the tide, seeing only the  sky with moon and stars, and, alongside, the wooded hill-tops and the  castle battlements in the moonlight, hearing nothing but the gentle  purling of one's own motion. I should like to swim thus every evening.  Then I drank some very nice wine, and sat for a long time smoking,  with Lynar, on the balcony, the Rhine beneath us. My little Testament  and the starry firmament caused our conversation to turn on Christian  topics, and I hammered for a long time at the Rousseau-like chastity  of his soul, with no other effect than to cause him to remain silent.  He was ill-treated while a child by nurses and private tutors, without  having really learned to know his parents, and by reason of a similar  bringing-up he has retained from his youthful days opinions similar to  my own, but has always been more satisfied with them than I ever was.  Next morning we went by steamer to Coblentz, breakfasted there for an  hour, and returned by the same route to Frankfort, where we arrived in  the evening. I really undertook the expedition with the object of  visiting old Metternich at Johannisberg; he had invited me, but the  Rhine pleased me so much that I preferred to take a pleasure ride to  Coblentz, and postponed the call. You and I saw him that time on our  trip directly after the Alps, and in bad weather; on this summer  morning, and after the dusty tedium of Frankfort, he again rose high  in my esteem. I promise myself much relish from spending a few days  with you at Ruedesheim, the place is so quiet and country-like, good  people and low-priced, and then we shall hire a little rowboat, ride  leisurely down, climb the Niederwald, and this and that castle, and  return by the steamer. One can leave here early in the morning, remain  for eight hours at Ruedesheim, Bingen, Rheinstein, etc., and be here  again at night. My appointment at this place does not appear to be  certain, and Hans is going to Coblentz as Lord-Lieutenant; will live  there in a stately palace, with the finest view in all Prussia. By  leaving here early, one reaches Coblentz by half past ten, and is back  in the evening; that is easier than from Reinfeld to Reddentin, and a  prettier road. You see we are not forsaken here; but who would have  thought, when we went to the wedding in Kiekow, that both of us should  be removed from our innocent Pomeranian solitude and hurled to the  summits of life, speaking in worldly fashion, to political outposts on  the Rhine? The ways of the Lord are passing strange. May He likewise  take our souls out of their darkness and lift them to the bright  summits of His grace. _That_ position would be more secure. But He has  certainly taken us visibly into His hand, and will not let me fall,  even though I sometimes make myself a heavy weight. The interview with  Lynar the other day has truly enabled me to cast a grateful (but not  pharisaical) glance over the distance which lies between me and my  previous unbelief; may it increase continually, until it has attained  the proper measure. * * * I am already beginning to look about here  for a house, preferably outside of the city, with a garden; there my  darling will have to play a very stiff, self-contained part, see much  tedious society, give dinners and balls, and assume terribly  aristocratic airs. What do you say to having dancing at your house  until far into the night? Probably it cannot be avoided, my beloved  heart--that is part of the \"service.\" I can see mother's blue eyes  grow big with wonder at the thought. I am going to bed, to read  Corinthians i., 3, and pray God to preserve you all to me, and grant  you a quiet night and health and peace. Dearest love to your parents.    Your most faithful    v.B.      Frankfort, April 4, '52.    _Dear Mother_,--I wished to write you today at length, but I do not  know how far I shall progress in it after having given myself up for  so long to enjoyment of Sunday leisure, by taking a long, loitering  walk in the woods, that hardly an hour remains before the closing of  the mail. I found such pretty, solitary paths, quite narrow, between  the greening hazel and thorn-bushes, where only the thrush and the  glede-kite were heard, and quite far off the bell of the church to  which I was playing truant, that I could not find my way home again.  Johanna is somewhat exhausted, in connection with her condition, or I  should have had her in the woods, too, and perhaps we should still be  there. * * * She has presented me with an exquisite anchor watch, of  which I was much in need, because I always wore her small one. In the  Vincke matter I cannot, with you, sufficiently praise God's mercy that  no misfortune has occurred from any side.

The most complicated wheels in the administrative  machine would have to be set in motion, and a decree obtained from the  Council of State.    \"Now it would seem that M. Valenglay, the Prime Minister, together with  the Prefect of Police, is opposed to making any too minute inquiries  capable of opening up a scandal which the authorities are anxious to  avoid. Bring Arsene Lupin back to life? Recommence the struggle with  that accursed scoundrel? Risk a fresh defeat and fresh ridicule? No, no,  and again no!    \"And thus is brought about this unprecedented, inadmissible,  inconceivable, disgraceful situation, that Arsene Lupin, the hardened  thief, the impenitent criminal, the robber-king, the emperor of burglars  and swindlers, is able to-day, not clandestinely, but in the sight and  hearing of the whole world, to pursue the most formidable task that he  has yet undertaken, to live publicly under a name which is not his own,  but which he has incontestably made his own, to destroy with impunity  four persons who stood in his way, to cause the imprisonment of an  innocent woman against whom he himself has accumulated false evidence,  and at the end of all, despite the protests of common sense and thanks  to an unavowed complicity, to receive the hundred millions of the  Mornington legacy.    \"There is the ignominious truth in a nutshell. It is well that it should  be stated. Let us hope, now that it stands revealed, that it will  influence the future conduct of events.\"    \"At any rate, it will influence the conduct of the idiot who wrote that  article,\" said Lupin, with a grin.    He dismissed Mlle. Levasseur and rang up Major d'Astrignac on the  telephone.    \"Is that you, Major? Perenna speaking.\"    \"Yes, what is it?\"    \"Have you read the article in the _Echo de France_?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Would it bore you very much to call on that gentleman and ask for  satisfaction in my name?\"    \"Oh! A duel!\"    \"It's got to be, Major. All these sportsmen are wearying me with their  lucubrations. They must be gagged. This fellow will pay for the rest.\"    \"Well, of course, if you're bent on it--\"    \"I am, very much.\"           *       *       *       *        *    The preliminaries were entered upon without delay. The editor of the  _Echo de France_ declared that the article had been sent in without a  signature, typewritten, and that it had been published without his  knowledge; but he accepted the entire responsibility.    That same day, at three o'clock, Don Luis Perenna, accompanied by Major  d'Astrignac, another officer, and a doctor, left the house in the Place  du Palais-Bourbon in his car, and, followed by a taxi crammed with the  detectives engaged in watching him, drove to the Parc des Princes.    While waiting for the arrival of the adversary, the Comte d'Astrignac  took Don Luis aside.    \"My dear Perenna, I ask you no questions. I don't want to know how much  truth there is in all that is being written about you, or what your real  name is. To me, you are Perenna of the Legion, and that is all I care  about. Your past began in Morocco. As for the future, I know that,  whatever happens and however great the temptation, your only aim will be  to revenge Cosmo Mornington and protect his heirs. But there's one thing  that worries me.\"    \"Speak out, Major.\"    \"Give me your word that you won't kill this man.\"    \"Two months in bed, Major; will that suit you?\"    \"Too long. A fortnight.\"    \"Done.\"    The two adversaries took up their positions. At the second encounter, the  editor of the _Echo de France_ fell, wounded in the chest.    \"Oh, that's too bad of you, Perenna!\" growled the Comte d'Astrignac. \"You  promised me--\"    \"And I've kept my promise, Major.\"    The doctors were examining the injured man. Presently one of them  rose and said:    \"It's nothing. Three weeks' rest, at most. Only a third of an inch more,  and he would have been done for.\"    \"Yes, but that third of an inch isn't there,\" murmured Perenna.    Still followed by the detectives' motor cab, Don Luis returned to the  Faubourg Saint-Germain; and it was then that an incident occurred which  was to puzzle him greatly and throw a most extraordinary light on the  article in the _Echo de France_.    In the courtyard of his house he saw two little puppies which belonged to  the coachman and which were generally confined to the stables. They were  playing with a twist of red string which kept catching on to things, to  the railings of the steps, to the flower vases. In the end, the paper  round which the string was wound, appeared. Don Luis happened to pass at  that moment. His eyes noticed marks of writing on the paper, and he  mechanically picked it up and unfolded it.    He gave a start. He had at once recognized the opening lines of the  article printed in the _Echo de France_. And the whole article was there,  written in ink, on ruled paper, with erasures, and with sentences added,  struck out, and begun anew.    He called the coachman and asked him:    \"Where does this ball of string come from?\"    \"The string, sir? Why, from the harness-room, I think. It must have been  that little she-devil of a Mirza who--\"    \"And when did you wind the string round the paper?\"    \"Yesterday evening, Monsieur.\"    \"Yesterday evening. I see. And where is the paper from?\"    \"Upon my word, Monsieur, I can't say. I wanted something to wind my  string on. I picked this bit up behind the coach-house where they fling  all the rubbish of the house to be taken into the street at night.\"    Don Luis pursued his investigations. He questioned or asked Mlle.  Levasseur to question the other servants. He discovered nothing; but one  fact remained: the article in the _Echo de France_ had been written, as  the rough draft which he had picked up proved, by somebody who lived in  the house or who was in touch with one of the people in the house.    The enemy was inside the fortress.    But what enemy? And what did he want? Merely Perenna's arrest?    All the remainder of the afternoon Don Luis continued anxious, annoyed by  the mystery that surrounded him, incensed at his own inaction, and  especially at that threatened arrest, which certainly caused him no  uneasiness, but which hampered his movements.    Accordingly, when he was told at about ten o'clock that a man who gave  the name of Alexandre insisted on seeing him, he had the man shown in;  and when he found himself face to face with Mazeroux, but Mazeroux  disguised beyond recognition and huddled in an old cloak, he flung  himself on him as on a prey, hustling and shaking him.    \"So it's you, at last?\" he cried. \"Well, what did I tell you? You can't  make head or tail of things at the police office and you've come for me!  Confess it, you numskull! You've come to fetch me! Oh, how funny it all  is! Gad, I knew that you would never have the cheek to arrest me, and  that the Prefect of Police would manage to calm the untimely ardour of  that confounded Weber! To begin with, one doesn't arrest a man whom one  has need of. Come, out with it! Lord, how stupid you look! Why don't you  answer? How far have you got at the office? Quick, speak! I'll settle the  thing in five seconds. Just tell me about your inquiry in two words, and  I'll finish it for you in the twinkling of a bed-post, in two minutes by  my watch. Well, you were saying--\"    \"But, Chief,\" spluttered Mazeroux, utterly nonplussed.    \"What! Must I drag the words out of you? Come on! I'll make a start. It  has to do with the man with the ebony walking-stick, hasn't it? The one  we saw at the Cafe du Pont-Neuf on the day when Inspector Verot was  murdered?\"    \"Yes, it has.\"    \"Have you found his traces?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, come along, find your tongue!\"    \"It's like this, Chief. Some one else noticed him besides the waiter.  There was another customer in the cafe; and this other customer, whom I  ended by discovering, went out at the same time as our man and heard  him ask somebody in the street which was the nearest underground  station for Neuilly.\"    \"Capital, that. And, in Neuilly, by asking questions on every side, you  ferreted him out?\"    \"And even learnt his name, Chief: Hubert Lautier, of the Avenue du Roule.  Only he decamped from there six months ago, leaving his furniture behind  him and taking nothing but two trunks.\"    \"What about the post-office?\"    \"We have been to the post-office. One of the clerks recognized the  description which we supplied. Our man calls once every eight or ten days  to fetch his mail, which never amounts to much: just one or two letters.  He has not been there for some time.\"    \"Is the correspondence in his name?\"    \"No, initials.\"    \"Were they able to remember them?\"    \"Yes: B.R.W.8.\"    \"Is that all?\"    \"That is absolutely all that I have discovered. But one of my fellow  officers succeeded in proving, from the evidence of two detectives, that  a man carrying a silver-handled ebony walking-stick and a pair of  tortoise-shell glasses walked out of the Gare d'Auteuil on the evening of  the double murder and went toward Renelagh. Remember the presence of Mme.  Fauville in that neighbourhood at the same hour. And remember that the  crime was committed round about midnight. I conclude from this--\"    \"That will do; be off!\"    \"But--\"    \"Get!\"    \"Then I don't see you again?\"    \"Meet me in half an hour outside our man's place.\"    \"What man?\"    \"Marie Fauville's accomplice.\"    \"But you don't know--\"    \"The address? Why, you gave it to me yourself: Boulevard Richard-Wallace,  No. 8. Go! And don't look such a fool.\"    He made him spin round on his heels, took him by the shoulders, pushed  him to the door, and handed him over, quite flabbergasted, to a footman.    He himself went out a few minutes later, dragging in his wake the  detectives attached to his person, left them posted on sentry duty  outside a block of flats with a double entrance,"]]]
