COOKING OF GRAINS.--All grains, with the exception of rice, and the  various grain meals, require prolonged cooking with gentle and  continuous heat, in order to so disintegrate their tissues and change  their starch into dextrine as to render them easy of digestion. Even the  so-called \"steam-cooked\" grains, advertised to be ready for use in five  or ten minutes, require a much longer cooking to properly fit them for  digestion. These so-called quickly prepared grains are simply steamed  before grinding, which has the effect to destroy any low organisms  contained in the grain. They are then crushed and shredded. Bicarbonate  of soda and lime is added to help dissolve the albuminoids, and  sometimes diastase to aid the conversion of the starch into sugar; but  there is nothing in this preparatory process that so alters the chemical  nature of the grain as to make it possible to cook it ready for easy  digestion in five or ten minutes. An insufficiently cooked grain,  although it may be palatable, is not in a condition to be readily acted  upon by the digestive fluids, and is in consequence left undigested to  act as a mechanical irritant.    [Illustration: A Double Boiler.]    For the proper cooking of grains the double boiler is the best and most  convenient utensil for ordinary purposes. If one does not possess a  double boiler, a very fair substitute may be improvised by using a  covered earthen crock placed within a kettle of boiling water, or by  using two pails, a smaller within a larger one containing boiling water.    A closed steamer or steam-cooker is also valuable for the cooking of  grains. Grains may be cooked in an ordinary kettle, but the difficulties  to be encountered, in order to prolong the cooking sufficiently and  prevent burning, make it the least desirable utensil for this purpose.    Water is the liquid usually employed for cooking grains, but many of  them are richer and finer flavored when milk is mixed with the  water,--one part to two of water. Especially is this true of rice,  hominy, and farina. When water is used, soft water is preferable to  hard. No salt is necessary, but if used at all, it is generally added to  the water before stirring in the grain or meal.    The quantity of liquid required varies with the different grains, the  manner in which they are milled, the method by which they are cooked,  and the consistency desired for the cooked grain, more liquid being  required for a porridge than for a mush. The following table gives the  time necessary for cooking and the quantity of liquid required for the  various grains, with the exception of rice, when cooked in a double  boiler or closed steamer, to produce a mush of ordinary consistency. If  an ordinary kettle is used for cooking the grains, a larger quantity of  water will be needed:--      TABLE SHOWING PROPORTION OF GRAIN AND LIQUID REQUIRED, WITH APPROXIMATE  TIME, WHEN A DOUBLE BOILER IS USED.

In the cooking of grains, the following points should be observed:--    1. Measure both liquid and grain accurately with the same utensil, or  with two of equal size.    2. Have the water boiling when the grain is introduced, but do not  allow it to boil for a long time previous, until it is considerably  evaporated, as that will change the proportion of water and grain  sufficiently to alter the consistency of the mush when cooked. Introduce  the grain slowly, so as not to stop the sinking to the bottom, and the  whole becomes thickened. If the grain is cooked in a double boiler, this  first boiling should be done with the inner dish directly over the fire,  and when the grain has thickened or become \"set,\" as it is termed, the  dish should at once be placed in the outer boiler, the water in which  should be boiling. It will then require no further care during the  entire cooking, safe to keep the outer boiler filled and the water  boiling. If the grain is to be cooked in a steam-cooker, as soon as set  it may be turned into a china or an earthen dish, suitable for use on  the table, and placed at once in the steamer to complete the cooking. If  an ordinary kettle is used, it is well to place it upon an iron ring or  brick on some part of the range were it will just simmer, for the  remainder of the cooking.    3. Stir the grain continuously until it has set, but not at all  afterward. Grains are much more appetizing if, while properly softened,  they can still be made to retain their original form. Stirring renders  the preparation pasty, and destroys its appearance. Grains cooked in a  double boiler will require no stirring, and there will be little danger  of their being lumpy, underdone on top, and scorched at the bottom, as  is so often the case when cooked in a single boiler.    4. Cook continuously. If it be necessary to replenish the water in the  outer boiler at anytime, let it be done with water of boiling  temperature. If it is desired to have the mush quite thick and dry, the  boiler should be left uncovered during the latter part of the cooking.  If preferred moist, keep the cover on.    In the preparation of all mushes with meal or flour, it is a good plan  to make the material into a batter with a portion of the liquid retained  from the quantity given, before introducing it into the boiling water.  This prevents the tendency to cook in lumps, so frequent when dry meal  is scattered into boiling liquid. Care must be taken, however, to add  the moistened portion very slowly, stirring vigorously meantime, so that  the boiling will not be checked. Use warm water for moistening. The  other directions given for the whole or broken grains are applicable to  the ground products.    GRAINS FOR BREAKFAST.--Since hasty preparation will not suffice for  the grains, they cannot be conveniently cooked in the morning in time  for breakfast. This difficulty may be obviated by cooking the day  previous, and reheating in the following way:--    Place the grain, when sufficiently cooked, in the refrigerator or in  some place where it will cool quickly (as slow cooling might cause  fermentation), to remain overnight. If cooked in a porcelain-lined or  granite-ware double boiler, it may be left undisturbed, if uncovered. If  cooked in tin or iron, turn the grain into a large earthen or china  dish. To heat in the morning, fill the outer boiler with boiling water,  place the inner dish containing the grain therein, and steam until  thoroughly heated. No stirring and no additional liquid will be  necessary, and if placed upon the stove when beginning the preparations  for breakfast, it will be ready for serving in good season. If the grain  has been kept in an earthen dish, it may best be reheated by placing  that inside the steam cooker or an ordinary steamer over a kettle of  boiling water.    Cracked wheat, pearl wheat, oatmeal, and other course grain preparations  to be reheated, require for cooking a half cup of water in addition to  the quantity given in the table. For rolled wheat, rolled oats, rolled  rye, and other crushed grains, no more is needed. Grains may be used for  breakfast without reheating, if served with hot milk or cream. If one  has an Aladdin oven, the problem of grains for breakfast may be easily  solved by cooking them all night, and if started late in the evening,  they may be thus cooked over a single burner oil stove with the flame  turned low.    GRAINS AN ECONOMICAL FOOD.--While grains are pre-eminently among  the most nutritious of foods, they are also among the most economical,  the average price being from five to seven cents a pound, and even less  when purchased in bulk. If it be objected that they require much fuel to  secure the prolonged cooking necessary, we would say that a few cents'  worth of oil a week and a small lamp stove will accomplish the cooking  in a most efficient manner. For a hot-weather food there are few  articles which give greater satisfaction and require less time and labor  on the part of the housewife than grains, cooked by the aid of a small  lamp stove.    WHEAT.    DESCRIPTION.--Wheat is the most important of the grain foods. It is  probably a native of Southwestern Asia, though like most grains  cultivated from the earliest periods, its history is extremely obscure.    Wheat is of two principal kinds, characterized as soft and hard wheat,  though there are hundreds of named varieties of the grain. The  distinction between many of these is due to variation in the relative  proportions of starch and nitrogenous matter. Some contain not more than  eight per cent of nitrogenous elements, while others contain eighteen or  twenty per cent, with a corresponding decrease in carbonaceous elements.  This difference depends upon the soil, cultivation, season, climate, and  other conditions under which the grain is produced.    The structure of the wheat"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242"],[0,"Poems (#18)"],[1,"hen, that we have followed them    We more than half suspect,  So intimate have we become    With their dear retrospect.            XII.    How dare the robins sing,    When men and women hear  Who since they went to their account    Have settled with the year! --  Paid all that life had earned    In one consummate bill,  And now, what life or death can do    Is immaterial.  Insulting is the sun    To him whose mortal light,  Beguiled of immortality,    Bequeaths him to the night.  In deference to him    Extinct be every hum,  Whose garden wrestles with the dew,    At daybreak overcome!            XIII.    DEATH.    Death is like the insect    Menacing the tree,  Competent to kill it,    But decoyed may be.    Bait it with the balsam,    Seek it with the knife,  Baffle, if it cost you    Everything in life.    Then, if it have burrowed    Out of reach of skill,  Ring the tree and leave it, --    'T is the vermin's will.            XIV.    UNWARNED.    'T is sunrise, little maid, hast thou    No station in the day?  'T was not thy wont to hinder so, --    Retrieve thine industry.    'T is noon, my little maid, alas!    And art thou sleeping yet?  The lily waiting to be wed,    The bee, dost thou forget?    My little maid, 't is night; alas,    That night should be to thee  Instead of morning! Hadst thou broached    Thy little plan to me,  Dissuade thee if I could not, sweet,    I might have aided thee.            XV.    Each that we lose takes part of us;    A crescent still abides,  Which like the moon, some turbid night,    Is summoned by the tides.            XVI.    Not any higher stands the grave    For heroes than for men;  Not any nearer for the child    Than numb three-score and ten.    This latest leisure equal lulls    The beggar and his queen;  Propitiate this democrat    By summer's gracious mien.            XVII.    ASLEEP.    As far from pity as complaint,    As cool to speech as stone,  As numb to revelation    As if my trade were bone.    As far from time as history,    As near yourself to-day  As children to the rainbow's scarf,    Or sunset's yellow play    To eyelids in the sepulchre.    How still the dancer lies,  While color's revelations break,    And blaze the butterflies!            XVIII.    THE SPIRIT.    'T is whiter than an Indian pipe,    'T is dimmer than a lace;  No stature has it, like a fog,    When you approach the place.    Not any voice denotes it here,    Or intimates it there;  A spirit, how doth it accost?    What customs hath the air?    This limitless hyperbole    Each one of us shall be;  'T is drama, if (hypothesis)    It be not tragedy!            XIX.    THE MONUMENT.    She laid her docile crescent down,    And this mechanic stone  Still states, to dates that have forgot,    The news that she is gone.    So constant to its stolid trust,    The shaft that never knew,  It shames the constancy that fled    Before its emblem flew.            XX.    Bless God, he went as soldiers,    His musket on his breast;  Grant, God, he charge the bravest    Of all the martial blest.    Please God, might I behold him    In epauletted white,  I should not fear the foe then,    I should not fear the fight.            XXI.    Immortal is an ample word    When what we need is by,  But when it leaves us for a time,    'T is a necessity.    Of heaven above the firmest proof    We fundamental know,  Except for its marauding hand,    It had been heaven below.            XXII.    Where every bird is bold to go,    And bees abashless play,  The foreigner before he knocks    Must thrust the tears away.            XXIII.    The grave my little cottage is,    Where, keeping house for thee,  I make my parlor orderly,    And lay the marble tea,    For two divided, briefly,    A cycle, it may be,  Till everlasting life unite    In strong society.            XXIV.    This was in the white of the year,    That was in the green,  Drifts were as difficult then to think    As daisies now to be seen.    Looking back is best that is left,    Or if it be before,  Retrospection is prospect's half,    Sometimes almost more.            XXV.    Sweet hours have perished here;    This is a mighty room;  Within its precincts hopes have played, --    Now shadows in the tomb.            XXVI.    Me! Come! My dazzled face  In such a shining place!    Me! Hear! My foreign ear  The sounds of welcome near!    The saints shall meet  Our bashful feet.    My holiday shall be  That they remember me;    My paradise, the fame  That they pronounce my name.            XXVII.    INVISIBLE.    From us she wandered now a year,    Her tarrying unknown;  If wilderness prevent her feet,    Or that ethereal zone    No eye hath seen and lived,    We ignorant must be.  We only know what time of year    We took the mystery.              XXVIII.    I wish I knew that woman's name,    So, when she comes this way,  To hold my life, and hold my ears,    For fear I hear her say    She's 'sorry I am dead,' again,    Just when the grave and I  Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep, --    Our only lullaby.            XXIX.    TRYING TO FORGET.    Bereaved of all, I went abroad,    No less bereaved to be  Upon a new peninsula, --    The grave preceded me,    Obtained my lodgings ere myself,    And when I sought my bed,  The grave it was, reposed upon    The pillow for my head.    I waked, to find it first awake,    I rose, -- it followed me;  I tried to drop it in the crowd,    To lose it in the sea,    In cups of artificial drowse    To sleep its shape away, --  The grave was finished, but the spade    Remained in memory.            XXX.    I felt a funeral in my brain,    And mourners, to and fro,  Kept treading, treading, till it seemed    That sense was breaking through.    And when they all were seated,    A service like a drum  Kept beating, beating, till I thought    My mind was going numb.    And then I heard them lift a box,    And creak across my soul  With those same boots of lead, again.    Then space began to toll    As all the heavens were a bell,    And Being but an ear,  And I and silence some strange race,    Wrecked, solitary, here.            XXXI.    I meant to find her when I came;    Death had the same design;  But the success was his, it seems,    And the discomfit mine.    I meant to tell her how I longed    For just this single time;  But Death had told her so the first,    And she had hearkened him.    To wander now is my abode;    To rest, -- to rest would be  A privilege of hurricane    To memory and me.            XXXII.    WAITING.    I sing to use the waiting,    My bonnet but to tie,  And shut the door unto my house;    No more to do have I,    Till, his best step approaching,    We journey to the day,  And tell each other how we sang    To keep the dark away.            XXXIII.    A sickness of this world it most occasions    When best men die;  A wishfulness their far condition    To occupy.    A chief indifference, as foreign    A world must be  Themselves forsake contented,    For Deity.            XXXIV.    Superfluous were the sun    When excellence is dead;  He were superfluous every day,    For every day is said    That syllable whose faith    Just saves it from despair,  And whose 'I'll meet you' hesitates    If love inquire, 'Where?'    Upon his dateless fame    Our periods may lie,  As stars that drop anonymous    From an abundant sky.            XXXV.    So proud she was to die    It made us all ashamed  That what we cherished, so unknown    To her desire seemed.    So satisfied to go    Where none of us should be,  Immediately, that anguish stooped    Almost to jealousy.            XXXVI.    FAREWELL.    Tie the strings to my life, my Lord,    Then I am ready to go!  Just a look at the horses --    Rapid! That will do!    Put me in on the firmest side,    So I shall never fall;  For we must ride to the Judgment,    And it's partly down hill.    But never I mind the bridges,    And never I mind the sea;  Held fast in everlasting race    By my own choice and thee.    Good-by to the life I used to live,    And the world I used to know;  And kiss the hills for me, just once;    Now I am ready to go!            XXXVII.    The dying need but little, dear, --    A glass of water's all,  A flower's unobtrusive face    To punctuate the wall,    A fan, perhaps, a friend's regret,    And certainly that one  No color in the rainbow    Perceives when you are gone.            XXXVIII.    DEAD.    There's something quieter than sleep    Within this inner room!  It wears a sprig upon its breast,    And will not tell its name.    Some touch it and some kiss it,    Some chafe its idle hand;  It has a simple gravity    I do not understand!    While simple-hearted neighbors    Chat of the 'early dead,'  We, prone to periphrasis,    Remark that birds have fled!            XXXIX.    The soul should always stand ajar,    That if the heaven inquire,  He will not be obliged to wait,    Or shy of troubling her.    Depart, before the host has slid    The bolt upon the door,  To seek for the accomplished guest, --    Her visitor no more.            XL.    Three weeks passed since I had seen her, --    Some disease had vexed;  'T was with text and village singing    I beheld her next,    And a company -- our pleasure    To discourse alone;  Gracious now to me as any,    Gracious unto none.    Borne, without dissent of either,    To the parish night;  Of the separated people    Which are out of sight?            XLI.    I breathed enough to learn the trick,    And now, removed from air,  I simulate the breath so well,    That one, to be quite sure    The lungs are stirless, must descend    Among the cunning cells,  And touch the pantomime himself.    How cool the bellows feels!            XLII.    I wonder if the sepulchre    Is not a lonesome way,  When men and boys, and larks and June    Go down the fields to hay!            XLIII.    JOY IN DEATH.    If tolling bell I ask the cause.    'A soul has gone to God,'  I'm answered "]]]
