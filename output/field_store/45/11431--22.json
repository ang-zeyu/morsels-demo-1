In his favorite author he is not shocked with the continual breaches of  probability, the confusion of times, the offences against manners, the  trampling upon geography; for he knows nothing of geography and  chronology, and he has never examined the grounds of probability. He  perhaps reads of a shipwreck on the coast of Bohemia: wholly taken up  with so interesting an event, and only solicitous for the fate of his  hero, he is not in the least troubled at this extravagant blunder. For  why should he be shocked at a shipwreck on the coast of Bohemia, who  does not know but that Bohemia may be an island in the Atlantic ocean?  and after all, what reflection is this on the natural good taste of the  person here supposed?    So far then as taste belongs to the imagination, its principle is the  same in all men; there is no difference in the manner of their being  affected, nor in the causes of the affection; but in the _degree_ there  is a difference, which arises from two causes principally; either from a  greater degree of natural sensibility, or from a closer and longer  attention to the object. To illustrate this by the procedure of the  senses, in which the same difference is found, let us suppose a very  smooth marble table to be set before two men; they both perceive it to  be smooth, and they are both pleased with it because of this quality. So  far they agree. But suppose another, and after that another table, the  latter still smoother than the former, to be set before them. It is now  very probable that these men, who are so agreed upon what is smooth, and  in the pleasure from thence, will disagree when they come to settle  which table has the advantage in point of polish. Here is indeed the  great difference between tastes, when men come to compare the excess or  diminution of things which are judged by degree and not by measure. Nor  is it easy, when such a difference arises, to settle the point, if the  excess or diminution be not glaring. If we differ in opinion about two  quantities, we can have recourse to a common measure, which may decide  the question with the utmost exactness; and this, I take it, is what  gives mathematical knowledge a greater certainty than any other. But in  things whose excess is not judged by greater or smaller, as smoothness  and roughness, hardness and softness, darkness and light, the shades of  colors, all these are very easily distinguished when the difference is  any way considerable, but not when it is minute, for want of some common  measures, which perhaps may never come to be discovered. In these nice  cases, supposing the acuteness of the sense equal, the greater attention  and habit in such things will have the advantage. In the question about  the tables, the marble-polisher will unquestionably determine the most  accurately. But notwithstanding this want of a common measure for  settling many disputes relative to the senses, and their representative  the imagination, we find that the principles are the same in all, and  that there is no disagreement until we come to examine into the  pre-eminence or difference of things, which brings us within the  province of the judgment.    So long as we are conversant with the sensible qualities of things,  hardly any more than the imagination seems concerned; little more also  than the imagination seems concerned when the passions are represented,  because by the force of natural sympathy they are felt in all men  without any recourse to reasoning, and their justness recognized in  every breast. Love, grief, fear, anger, joy, all these passions have, in  their turns, affected every mind; and they do not affect it in an  arbitrary or casual manner, but upon certain, natural, and uniform  principles. But as many of the works of imagination are not confined to  the representation of sensible objects, nor to efforts upon the  passions, but extend themselves to the manners, the characters, the  actions, and designs of men, their relations, their virtues and vices,  they come within the province of the judgment, which is improved by  attention, and by the habit of reasoning. All these make a very  considerable part of what are considered as the objects of taste; and  Horace sends us to the schools of philosophy and the world for our  instruction in them. Whatever certainty is to be acquired in morality  and the science of life; just the same degree of certainty have we in  what relates to them in works of imitation. Indeed it is for the most  part in our skill in manners, and in the observances of time and place,  and of decency in general, which is only to be learned in those schools  to which Horace recommends us, that what is called taste, by way of  distinction, consists: and which is in reality no other than a more  refined judgment. On the whole, it appears to me, that what is called  taste, in its most general acceptation, is not a simple idea, but is  partly made up of a perception of the primary pleasures of sense, of the  secondary pleasures of the imagination, and of the conclusions of the  reasoning faculty, concerning the various relations of these, and  concerning the human passions, manners, and actions. All this is  requisite to form taste, and the groundwork of all these is the same in  the human mind; for as the senses are the great originals of all our  ideas, and consequently of all our pleasures, if they are not uncertain  and arbitrary, the whole groundwork of taste is common to all, and  therefore there is a sufficient foundation for a conclusive reasoning on  these matters.    Whilst we consider taste merely according to its nature and species, we  shall find its principles entirely uniform; but the degree in which  these principles prevail, in the several individuals of mankind, is  altogether as different as the principles themselves are similar. For  sensibility and judgment, which are the qualities that compose what we  commonly call a _taste_, vary exceedingly in various people. From a  defect in the former of these qualities arises a want of taste; a  weakness in the latter constitutes a wrong or a bad one. There are some  men formed with feelings so blunt, with tempers so cold and phlegmatic,  that they can hardly be said to be awake during the whole course of  their lives. Upon such persons the most striking objects make but a  faint and obscure impression. There are others so continually in the  agitation of gross and merely sensual pleasures, or so occupied in the  low drudgery of avarice, or so heated in the chase of honors and  distinction, that their minds, which had been used continually to the  storms of these violent and tempestuous passions, can hardly be put in  motion by the delicate and refined play of the imagination. These men,  though from a different cause, become as stupid and insensible as the  former; but whenever either of these happen to be struck with any  natural elegance or greatness, or with these qualities in any work of  art, they are moved upon the same principle.    The cause of a wrong taste is a defect of judgment. And this may arise  from a natural weakness of understanding (in whatever the strength of  that faculty may consist), or, which is much more commonly the case, it  may arise from a want of a proper and well-directed exercise, which  alone can make it strong and ready. Besides, that ignorance,  inattention, prejudice, rashness, levity, obstinacy, in short, all those  passions, and all those vices, which pervert the judgment in other  matters, prejudice it no less in this its more refined and elegant  province. These causes produce different opinions upon everything which  is an object of the understanding, without inducing us to suppose that  there are no settled principles of reason. And indeed, on the whole, one  may observe, that there is rather less difference upon matters of taste  among mankind, than upon most of those which depend upon the naked  reason; and that men are far better agreed on the excellence of a  description in Virgil, than on the truth or falsehood of a theory of  Aristotle.    A rectitude of judgment in the arts, which may be called a good taste,  does in a great measure depend upon sensibility; because if the mind has  no bent to the pleasures of the imagination, it will never apply itself  sufficiently to works of that species to acquire a competent knowledge  in them. But though a degree of sensibility is requisite to form a good  judgment, yet a good judgment does not necessarily arise from a quick  sensibility of pleasure; it frequently happens that a very poor judge,  merely by force of a greater complexional sensibility, is more affected  by a very poor piece, than the best judge by the most perfect; for as  everything now, extraordinary, grand, or passionate, is well calculated  to affect such a person, and that the faults do not affect him, his  pleasure is more pure and unmixed; and as it is merely a pleasure of the  imagination, it is much higher than any which is derived from a  rectitude of the judgment; the judgment is for the greater part employed  in throwing stumbling-blocks in the way of the imagination, in  dissipating the scenes of its enchantment, and in tying us down to the  disagreeable yoke of our reason: for almost the only pleasure that men  have in judging better than others, consists in a sort of conscious  pride and superiority, which arises from thinking rightly; but then this  is an indirect pleasure, a pleasure which does not immediately result  from the object which is under contemplation. In the morning of our  days, when the senses are unworn and tender, when the whole man is awake  in every part, and the gloss of novelty fresh upon all the objects that  surround us, how lively at that time are our sensations, but how false  and inaccurate the judgments we form of things!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15100"],[0,"The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay (#18)"],[1,"live chiefly on  the high grounds: their hair is of a reddish cast, and the head is  shorter than in the larger sort. Young kanguroos which have been taken,  have in a few days grown very tame, but none have lived more than two or  three weeks. Yet it is still possible that when their proper food shall  be better known, they may be domesticated. Near some water, in this  journey, was found the dung of an animal that fed on grass, which, it was  supposed, could not have been less than a horse. A kanguroo, so much  above the usual size, would have been an extraordinary phaenomenon,  though no larger animal has yet been seen, and the limits of growth in  that species are not ascertained. The tail of the kanguroo, which is very  large, is found to be used as a weapon of offence, and has given such  severe blows to dogs as to oblige them to desist from pursuit. Its flesh  is coarse and lean, nor would it probably be used for food, where there  was not a scarcity of fresh provisions. The disproportion between the  upper and lower parts of this animal is greater than has been shown in  any former delineations of it, but is well expressed in the plate  inserted here.    The dimensions of a stuffed kanguroo in the possession of Mr. Nepean,  are these,                                                              f. in.

The natives of New South Wales, though in so rude and uncivilized a state  as not even to have made an attempt towards clothing themselves,  notwithstanding that at times they evidently suffer from the cold and  wet, are not without notions of sculpture. In all these excursions of  Governor Phillip, and in the neighbourhood of Botany Bay and Port  Jackson, the figures of animals, of shields, and weapons, and even of  men, have been seen carved upon the rocks, roughly indeed, but  sufficiently well to ascertain very fully what was the the object  intended. Fish were often represented, and in one place the form of a  large lizard was sketched out with tolerable accuracy. On the top of one  of the hills, the figure of a man in the attitude usually assumed by them  when they begin to dance, was executed in a still superior style. That  the arts of imitation and amusement, should thus in any degree precede  those of necessity, seems an exception to the rules laid down by theory  for the progress of invention. But perhaps it may better be considered as  a proof that the climate is never so severe as to make the provision of  covering or shelter a matter of absolute necessity. Had these men been  exposed to a colder atmosphere, they would doubtless have had clothes and  houses, before they attempted to become sculptors.    In all the country hitherto explored, the parties have seldom gone a  quarter of a mile without seeing trees which had been on fire. As violent  thunder storms are not uncommon on this coast, it is possible that they  may have been burnt by lightning, which the gum-tree is thought  particularly to attract; but it is probable also that they may have been  set on fire by the natives. The gum-tree is highly combustible, and it is  a common practice with them to kindle their fires at the root of one of  these trees. When they quit a place they never extinguish the fire they  have made, but leave it to burn out, or to communicate its flames to the  tree, as accidental circumstances may determine.    Governor Phillip, on his return from this excursion, had the  mortification to find that five ewes and a lamb had been killed very near  the camp, and in the middle of the day. How this had happened was not  known, but it was conjectured that they must have been killed by dogs  belonging to the natives. The loss of any part of the stock of cattle was  a serious misfortune, since it must be a considerable time before it  could be replaced. Fish affords, in this place, only an uncertain  resource: on some days great quantities are caught, though not sufficient  to save any material part of the provisions; but at times it is very  scarce. An account of the live stock at this time in the settlement is  subjoined to this chapter.    The three transports bound to China, sailed the 5th, 6th, and 8th of May;  and the Supply having been caulked, sailed on the 6th to Lord Howe Island  for turtle, in hopes of giving some check to the scurvy, with which the  people were still so much affected that near two hundred were incapable  of work.    From the great labour which attended the clearing of the ground it proved  to be impracticable to sow at present more than eight or ten acres with  wheat and barley*: and it was apprehended that even this crop would  suffer from the depredations of ants and field mice. In the beginning of  May it was supposed, as it had been once or twice before, that the rainy  season was set in; but in about a week the weather became fine again.

Chapter XII.    May 1788 to June 1788    The Supply returns from Lord Howe Island--Some convicts assaulted by the  natives--excursion of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay by Land--interview  with many natives--the fourth of June celebrated--some account of the  climate.    25 May 1788    On the 25th of May, the Supply tender returned from Lord Howe Island, but  unfortunately without having been able to procure any turtle. She had met  with squally weather, and had been obliged to cut away her best bower  anchor, but suffered no other damage. The three transports bound for  China had all appeared off the island while the Supply remained there.    About this time one of the convicts who, in searching for vegetables, had  gone a considerable way from the camp, returned very dangerously wounded  in the back. He said, that another man who had gone out for the same  purpose, had been carried off by the natives in his sight, after having  been wounded in the head. A shirt and hat were afterwards found, both  pierced with spears, in one of the huts of the natives; but no  intelligence of the man could be gained. There could be little doubt that  the convicts had been the aggressors, though the man who returned  strongly denied having given any kind of provocation.    30 May 1788    On the thirtieth of May, two men who had been employed in collecting  rushes for thatch at some distance from the camp, were found dead. One of  them had four spears in his body, one of which had pierced entirely  through it: the other had not any marks of violence upon him. In this  case it was clearly proved that the first injury had been offered by the  unfortunate men, who paid so dearly for their dishonesty and disobedience  of orders; for they had been seen with a canoe, which they had taken from  one of the fishing places. These events were much regretted by Governor  Phillip, as tending entirely to the frustration of the plan he had so  much at heart, of conciliating the affections of the natives, and  establishing a friendly intercourse with them.    As the rush-cutters tools had been carried away, the Governor thought it  might be possible to discover the natives who had been concerned in this  unfortunate affray; and to make them understand that the conduct of their  assailants had been entirely unwarranted, and was very highly  disapproved. He judged the attempt to be at least worth making, as it  seemed the only way to restore that confidence which must have been  interrupted by this affair. The next day, therefore, he went out with a  small party, consisting altogether of twelve persons, and landed at the  place where the men were killed. After traversing the country for more  than twenty miles, they arrived at the north shore of Botany Bay, without  having met with one of the natives.    In this place, at length, they saw about twenty canoes employed in  fishing: and when the fires were made, and the party encamped to pass the  night upon the beach, it was fully expected that some of those in the  canoes would have joined them, but not one appeared. The next morning,  though fifty canoes were drawn up on the beach, not a single person could  be found belonging to them. Governor Phillip had now determined to return  to Port Jackson; but as he went, keeping for"]]]
