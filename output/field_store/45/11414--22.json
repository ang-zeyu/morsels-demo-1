With the view of paving the way for the removal from power of  Mirza Najaf, they next addressed themselves to creating  disturbances in the country around Dehli. For they knew that this  would at once alarm the Emperor and involve the Mirza in  difficulty and danger; and they foresaw in the result of such  intrigues an easy method of ruining one whom they justly regarded  as an obstacle to the recall to office of their protege Zabita.  They accordingly instigated Ranjit Singh, the ruler of the  Bhartpur Jats, to prefer a claim to the fief of Balamgarh, held  by a petty chieftain of his own nation. This chief solicited aid  from the Emperor against his powerful rival; and in the end of  the year 1772 Mirza Najaf Khan, who henceforth figures in the  native histories by his newly-acquired title of  Zulfikar-ud-daulah, sent a force under a Biloch leader to the aid  of the Balamgarh man. The Mahrattas, on the other hand, sent a  force from Agra, which joining with the Bhartpur Jats, forced the  Imperialists to retreat towards the capital; but the Patel,  disapproving of the Rohilla element contributed to this  confederacy by the presence of Zabita Khan, retired towards  Jaipur, where he occupied himself in plundering the Rajputs.  Takuji Holkar and the other Mahratta chiefs, feeling strong  enough to dispense with his aid, and anxious, for reasons of  their own, to fulfil their promise to Zabita, advanced towards  Dehli, but were met at a place called Baddarpur, ten miles south  of the city, by a force under the minister himself. In the action  which ensued, the Moghul force which, though well disciplined and  well led by Mirza Najaf, seconded by M. Medoc and some efficient  native officers, was numerically weak, fell back upon Humayun's  tomb, within four miles of the palace of New Dehli. Here ensued a  series of skirmishes, which lasted four days; till the Mirza  having had a nephew slain, retreated to the new town by way of  Daryaoganj, followed by a strong detachment of the enemy. He  still obstinately defended the palace and its environs; but  Hissam-ud-daulah (whose backstair influence has been already  mentioned) went in person to the Mahratta camp the following day,  and informed them, as from his master, that the brave minister  would be sacrificed by his weak and ungrateful master. Holkar and  his train of black and unkempt pygmies swarmed insolently into  the palace, where they dictated their own terms. The Mahrattas,  who were anxious to return to the Deccan, were not disposed to  make difficulties; their main terms were the restoration to the  office of premier noble of Zabita Khan, and the cession of those  provinces in the Lower Doab which had been under the direct sway  of the Emperor, while he enjoyed British protection. These terms  being granted, they picked a quarrel with Mirza Najaf Khan, about  a payment which he was alleged to have guaranteed them during the  Sukhartal campaign, and obtained an order from the Emperor  banishing him the court. These events occurred at the end of  December, just a twelvemonth after the unfortunate monarch's  restoration.    1773 Â— Finding Zabita Khan in office, and the pander Hisam in  high favour, the heroic ax-minister, having still with him a  strong and faithful escort of Moghul horse, together with the  remains of the trained infantry, and having sent to Saharanpur  for his adopted son, Afrasyab Khan, who had some squadrons with  him for the protection of that district, threw himself into a  fortified house outside the Kabul Gate of the city. The forces of  the new Minister surrounded him, while the Mahrattas looked on  with curiosity, which seems to have been tempered by admiration  for his heroism; and the next day he formed one of those  desperate resolutions which have so often been known to influence  the course of Asiatic politics. Putting on all his armour, and  wearing over it a sort of shroud of green, in the fashion used  for the grave-clothes of a descendant of the Prophet, Najaf Khan  rode out at the head of his personal guards. As the small band  approached the Mahratta camp, shouting their religious war-cries  of \"Allah Ho Akbar,\" and \"Ya Hossain,\" they were met by a  peaceful deputation of the unbelievers who courteously saluted  them, and conducted them to camp in friendly guise.    It can only be supposed that the news of the Peshwa's death,  which had recently arrived from Punah, and the unsettled state of  the Rohilla quarrel combined to render the Mahrattas indisposed  to push matters to extremity against a man of Najaf Khan's  character and influence, and thus gave rise to this extraordinary  scene. The result was that the ex-minister's excitement was  calmed, and he agreed to Join the Mahrattas in an attack on  Rohilkand. One cannot but remark the tortuous policy of these  restless rievers. First they move the Emperor upon the Rohillas;  then they move the Rohilla, Zabita Khan, upon the Emperor; and  then, having united these enemies, they make use of a fresh  instrument to renew the original attack. With this new ally they  marched upon Rohilkand by way of Ramghat, below Anupshahar, where  the Ganges is fordable during the winter months; and at the same  time parties of their troops devastated the Doab.    Meanwhile the British, finding that the Emperor was unable to  protect the provinces about Allahabad, which they had put into  his charge, made them over to the Viceroy of Audh, to whose  management they had been attached previous to the negotiations  that followed the battle of Buxar, and between whose dominions  and those of the British they formed the connecting link. They  had been abandoned by the Emperor when he proceeded to Dehli,  contrary to the remonstrance of the Bengal Council, and though  his own lieutenant had reported, and with perfect accuracy, that  he could not regard the order to give them up to the Mahrattas as  a free act of his master's. It would, indeed, have been an easy  step towards the ruin of the British to have allowed the  Mahrattas to take possession of this tract, and so form a  permanent lodgement upon the borders of the possessions in Bihar  and the Eastern Subahs which the British held by the indefeasible  and twofold tenure of conquest, and of an Imperial grant. And it  so happened that the necessary transfer could not be carried out  without an armed demonstration for the expulsion or coercion of  the usurping Mahrattas. The expenses of this expedition were  naturally met by the Viceroy. Judged even by modern standards,  this cannot but be regarded as a perfectly legitimate act of  self-defence. It is, however, thus characterized by Macaulay:  \"The provinces which had been torn from the Mogul were made over  to the government of Audh for about half a million sterling.''  The British having joined their forces to those of the  Vazir-Viceroy Shujaa, accordingly marched to meet the invaders.  Hafiz Rahmat, whom we have lately seen treating with those  powers, now became anxious about the money-payments for which he  had engaged, in the usual reckless Oriental way, and entered into  negotiations with the Mahrattas. In this scheme, the sudden  arrival of the British and Audh armies surprised him and he was  forced to abandon it for the present and join the allies in an  advance against the Mahrattas, who precipitately retired on  Etawa, and thence to their own country in May, 1773.    It has been already seen that Mirza Najaf Khan was a family  connection of Shujaa-ud-daulah, and an old friend of the British  general; and, on the retreat of his Mahratta supporters, he came  over to the allied camp, where he met the reception due to his  merits.    The allied armies moved on to Anupshahar, accompanied by the  ex-minister, who was attended by his faithful Moghuls. This town,  which had, as we have seen, been a cantonment of Ahmad the  Abdali, was particularly well situated for the advanced post of a  power like the British, seeking to hold the balance among the  native states of Hindustan. To the north were the fords of  Sukhartal, by which the Najibabad Rohillas passed from one part  of their dominions to another; to the south was the ford of  Ramghat, leading from Aligarh to Bareilly. It remained a British  cantonment from this time until some time subsequent to the  occupation of the country in general, in 1806; after which the  town of Meerut was found more central, and Anupshahar ceased to  be a station for troops. It is a thriving commercial entrepot in  our days, though much menaced by the Ganges, on whose right bank  it stands. The only memorial of the long-continued presence of a  British force is now to be found in two cemeteries, containing  numbers of tombs from which the inscriptions have disappeared.    At this station Najaf Khan took leave of his patrons, having  received from Shujaa-ud-daulah the portfolio (or, to use the  Eastern phrase, the pencase), of Deputy Vazir, and from the  British General a warm letter of recommendation to the Emperor.  It was especially magnanimous on the part of the Vazir to let  bygones be bygones, since they included the murder, by himself,  of his new Deputy's kinsman and former patron Mohammad Kuli Khan,  the former Governor of Allahabad; and it was not an impolitic,  though probably unintentional, stroke on the part of Sir R.  Barker to lend his assistance towards introducing into the  direction of the Imperial councils a chief who was as strongly  opposed to the Rohillas as to the Mahrattas.    Armed with these credentials, and accompanied by a small but  compact and faithful force, the Mirza proceeded to Court to  assume his post. The newly-created premier noble, Zabita Khan,  took refuge with the Jats; but Hisam-ud-daulah, who had been for  some time in charge of the local revenue (Diwan-i-Khalsa) "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14721"],[0,"Speeches & Letters of Abraham Lincoln, 1832-1865 (#18)"],[1,"and passed. \"A house divided against itself  cannot stand.\" I believe this government cannot endure permanently, half  slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved,--I do  not expect the house to fall; but I do expect it will cease to be  divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either the  opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it  where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course  of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will push it forward till it  shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North  as well as South.    Have we no tendency to the latter condition? Let any one who doubts,  carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination--piece  of machinery, so to speak--compounded of the Nebraska doctrine and the  Dred Scott decision. Let him consider not only what work the machinery  is adapted to do, and how well adapted; but also let him study the  history of its construction, and trace, if he can, or rather fail, if he  can, to trace the evidences of design and concert of action among its  chief architects from the beginning.    The new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half the  States by State constitutions, and from most of the national territory  by congressional prohibition. Four days later commenced the struggle  which ended in repealing that congressional prohibition. This opened all  the national territory to slavery, and was the first point gained.    But so far, Congress only had acted; and an indorsement by the people,  real or apparent, was indispensable to save the point already gained and  give chance for more.    This necessity had not been overlooked, but had been provided for, as  well as might be, in the notable argument of _Squatter Sovereignty_,  otherwise called _sacred right of self-government_, which latter phrase,  though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government, was so  perverted in this attempted use of it, as to amount to just this: That  if any one man choose to enslave another, no third man shall be allowed  to object. That argument was incorporated into the Nebraska bill itself,  in the language which follows: \"It being the true intent and meaning of  this act, not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to  exclude it therefrom; but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to  form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject  only to the Constitution of the United States.\" Then opened the roar of  loose declamation in favour of _Squatter Sovereignty_ and _sacred right  of self-government_. \"But,\" said opposition members, \"let us amend the  bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the Territory may  exclude slavery.\" \"Not we,\" said the friends of the measure, and down  they voted the amendment.    While the Nebraska bill was passing through Congress, a _law case_,  involving the question of a negro's freedom, by reason of his owner  having voluntarily taken him first into a free State and then into a  Territory covered by the congressional prohibition, and held him as a  slave for a long time in each, was passing through the United States  Circuit Court for the District of Missouri; and both Nebraska bill and  law-suit were brought to a decision, in the same month of May, 1854. The  negro's name was \"Dred Scott,\" which name now designates the decision  finally rendered in the case. Before the then next presidential  election, the law case came to, and was argued, in the Supreme Court of  the United States; but the decision of it was deferred until after the  election. Still, before the election, Senator Trumbull, on the floor of  the Senate, requested the leading advocate of the Nebraska bill to state  _his opinion_ whether the people of a Territory can constitutionally  exclude slavery from their limits, and the latter answers: \"That is a  question for the Supreme Court.\"    The election came. Mr. Buchanan was elected, and the indorsement, such  as it was, secured. That was the second point gained. The indorsement,  however, fell short of a clear popular majority by nearly four hundred  thousand votes, and so, perhaps, was not overwhelmingly reliable and  satisfactory. The outgoing President, in his last annual message, as  impressively as possible echoed back upon the people the weight and  authority of the indorsement. The Supreme Court met again; did not  announce their decision, but ordered a reargument. The presidential  inauguration came, and still no decision of the Court; but the incoming  President in his inaugural address fervently exhorted the people to  abide by the forthcoming decision, whatever it might be. Then, in a few  days, came the decision.    The reputed author of the Nebraska bill finds an early occasion to make  a speech at this capitol, indorsing the Dred Scott decision, and  vehemently denouncing all opposition to it. The new President, too,  seizes the early occasion of the Silliman letter to indorse and strongly  construe that decision, and to express his astonishment that any  different view had ever been entertained!    At length a squabble springs up between the President and the author of  the Nebraska bill, on the mere question of _fact_ whether the Lecompton  constitution was, or was not, in any just sense, made by the people of  Kansas; and in that quarrel, the latter declares that all he wants is a  fair vote for the people, and that he cares not whether slavery be voted  _down_ or _voted up_. I do not understand his declaration that he cares  not whether slavery be voted down or voted up, to be intended by him  other than as an apt definition of the policy he would impress upon the  public mind,--the principle for which he declares he has suffered so  much, and is ready to suffer to the end. And well may he cling to that  principle. If he has any parental feeling, well may he cling to it. That  principle is the only shred left of his original Nebraska doctrine.  Under the Dred Scott decision, \"squatter sovereignty\" squatted out of  existence, tumbled down like temporary scaffolding; like the mould at  the foundry, it served through one blast, and fell back into loose  sand,--helped to carry an election, and then was kicked to the winds.  His late joint struggle with the Republicans against the Lecompton  constitution, involves nothing of the original Nebraska doctrine. That  struggle was made on a point--the right of the people to make their own  constitution--upon which he and the Republicans have never differed.    The several points of the Dred Scott decision in connection with Senator  Douglas's \"care not\" policy, constitute the piece of machinery in its  present state of advancement. This was the third point gained. The  working points of that machinery are:    _First._ That no negro slave, imported as such from Africa, and no  descendant of such slave, can ever be a citizen of any State, in the  sense of that term as used in the Constitution of the United States.  This point is made in order to deprive the negro, in every possible  event, of the benefit of that provision of the United States  Constitution which declares that \"citizens of each State shall be  entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several  States.\"    _Secondly._ That \"subject to the Constitution of the United States,\"  neither Congress nor a territorial legislature can exclude slavery from  any United States Territory. This point is made in order that individual  men may fill up the Territories with slaves, without danger of losing  them as property, and thus enhance the chances of permanency to the  institution through all the future.    _Thirdly._ That whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a free  State makes him free as against the holder, the United States Courts  will not decide, but will leave to be decided by the courts of any slave  State the negro may be forced into by the master. This point is made,  not to be pressed immediately; but if acquiesced in for a while, and  apparently indorsed by the people at an election, then to sustain the  logical conclusion that what Dred Scott's master might lawfully do with  Dred Scott in the free State of Illinois, every other master may  lawfully do, with any other one, or one thousand slaves in Illinois, or  in any other free State.    Auxiliary to all this, and working hand-in-hand with it, the Nebraska  doctrine, or what is left of it, is to educate and mould public opinion  not to care whether slavery is voted down or voted up. This shows  exactly where we now are, and partially, also, whither we are tending.    It will throw additional light on the latter, to go back, and run the  mind over the string of historical facts already stated. Several things  will now appear less dark and mysterious than they did when they were  transpiring. The people were to be left \"perfectly free,\" \"subject only  to the Constitution.\" What the Constitution had to do with it, outsiders  could not then see. Plainly enough now: it was an exactly fitted niche  for the Dred Scott decision to afterwards come in, and declare the  perfect freedom of the people to be just no freedom at all. Why was the  amendment expressly declaring the right of the people voted down?  Plainly enough now: the adoption of it would have spoiled the niche for  the Dred Scott decision. Why was the Court decision held up? Why even a  Senator's individual opinion withheld till after the presidential  election? Plainly enough now: the speaking out then would have damaged  the perfectly free argument upon which the election was to be carried.  Why the outgoing President's felicitation on the indorsement? Why the  delay of a reargument? Why the incoming President's advance exhortation  in favour of the decision? These things look like the cautious patting  and petting of a spirited horse, preparatory to mounting him, when it is "]]]
