Many a delightful evening have I passed in       this pretty thatched house with the famous _Larrey Grogan_, who       played on the bagpipes extreme well; dear _Jack Lattin_,       matchless on the fiddle, and the most agreeable of companions;       that ever charming young fellow, _Jack Wall_ ... and many other       delightful fellows; who went in the days of their youth to the       shades of eternity. When I think of them and their evening       songs--_We will go to Johnny Macklean's--to try if his ale be       good or no_, etc., and that years and infirmities begin to       oppress me--What is life!    There is a fine, easy, mellow manner of writing, worthy the subject.  And we--we conclude with honest regret. Even to write down the  names of all the inns where we have been happy would be the  pleasantest possible way of spending an afternoon. But we advise you  to be cautious in adopting our favourites as stopping places. Some  of them are very humble.            [Illustration]        THE CLUB IN HOBOKEN      The advertisement ran as follows:              Schooner _Hauppauge_            FOR SALE            By U.S. Marshal,            April 26, 1 P.M.,            Pier G, Erie R.R.,            Weehawken, N.J.            Built at Wilmington, N.C., 1918; net            tonnage 1,295; length 228; equipped with            sails, tackle, etc.    This had taken the eye of the Three Hours for Lunch Club. The club's  interest in nautical matters is well known and it is always looking  forward to the day when it will be able to command a vessel of its  own. Now it would be too much to say that the club expected to be  able to buy the _Hauppauge_ (the first thing it would have done, in  that case, would have been to rename her). For it was in the slack  and hollow of the week--shall we say, the bight of the week?--just  midway between pay-days. But at any rate, thought the club, we can  look her over, which will be an adventure in itself; and we can see  just how people behave when they are buying a schooner, and how  prices are running, so that when the time comes we will be more  experienced. Besides, the club remembered the ship auction scene in  \"The Wrecker\" and felt that the occasion might be one of most  romantic excitement.    It is hard, it is very hard, to have to admit that the club was  foiled. It had been told that at Cortlandt Street a ferry bound for  Weehawken might be found; but when Endymion and the Secretary  arrived there, at 12:20 o'clock, they learned that the traffic to  Weehawken is somewhat sparse. Next boat at 2:40, said a sign. They  hastened to the Lackawanna ferry at Barclay Street, thinking that by  voyaging to Hoboken and then taking a car they might still be in  time. But it was not to be. When the _Ithaca_ docked, just south of  the huge red-blotched profile of the rusty rotting _Leviathan_, it  was already 1 o'clock. The _Hauppauge_, they said to themselves, is  already on the block, and if we went up there now to study her, we  would be regarded as impostors.    But the club is philosophic. One Adventure is very nearly as good as  another, and they trod ashore at Hoboken with light hearts. It was a  day of tender and untroubled sunshine. They had a queer sensation of  being in foreign lands. Indeed, the tall tragic funnels of the  _Leviathan_ and her motionless derelict masts cast a curious shadow  of feeling over that region. For the great ship, though blameless  herself, seems a thing of shame, a remembrance of days and deeds  that soiled the simple creed of the sea. Her great shape and her  majestic hull, pitiably dingy and stark, are yet plainly conscious  of sin. You see it in every line of her as she lies there, with the  attitude of a great dog beaten and crouching. You wonder how she  would behave if she were towed out on the open bright water of the  river, under that clear sky, under the eyes of other ships going  about their affairs with the self-conscious rectitude and pride that  ships have. For ships are creatures of intense caste and  self-conscious righteousness. They rarely forgive a fallen  sister--even when she has fallen through no fault of her own.  Observe the _Nieuw Amsterdam_ as she lies, very solid and spick, a  few piers above. Her funnel is gay with bright green stripes; her  glazed promenade deck is white and immaculate. But, is there not  just a faint suggestion of smugness in her mien? She seems thanking  the good old Dutch Deity of cleanliness and respectability that she  herself is not like this poor trolloping giantess, degraded from the  embrace of ocean and the unblemished circle of the sea.    That section of Hoboken waterfront, along toward the green  promontory crowned by Stevens Institute, still has a war-time  flavour. The old Hamburg-American line piers are used by the Army  Transport Service, and in the sunshine a number of soldiers, off  duty, were happily drowsing on a row of two-tiered beds set outdoors  in the April pleasantness. There was a racket of bugles, and a squad  seemed to be drilling in the courtyard. Endymion and the Secretary,  after sitting on a pier-end watching some barges, and airing their  nautical views in a way they would never have done had any pukka  seafaring men been along, were stricken with the very crisis of  spring fever and lassitude. They considered the possibility of  hiring one of the soldiers' two-tiered beds for the afternoon.  Perhaps it is the first two syllables of Hoboken's name that make it  so desperately debilitating to the wayfarer in an April noonshine.  Perhaps it was a kind of old nostalgia, for the Secretary remembered  that sailormen's street as it had been some years ago, when he had  been along there in search of schooners of another sort.    But anatomizing their anguish, these creatures finally decided that  it might not be spring fever, but merely hunger. They saw the statue  of the late Mr. Sloan of the Lackawanna Railroad--Sam Sloan, the  bronze calls him, with friendly familiarity. The aspiring forelock  of that statue, and the upraised finger of Samuel Sullivan Cox (\"The  Letter Carriers' Friend\") in Astor Place, the club considers two of  the most striking things in New York statuary. Mr. Pappanicholas,  who has a candy shop in the high-spirited building called Duke's  House, near the ferry terminal, must be (Endymion thought) some  relative of Santa Claus. Perhaps he _is_ Santa Claus, and the club  pondered on the quite new idea that Santa Claus has lived in Hoboken  all these years and no one had guessed it. The club asked a friendly  policeman if there were a second-hand bookstore anywhere near. \"Not  that I know of,\" he said. But they did find a stationery store where  there were a number of popular reprints in the window, notably \"The  Innocence of Father Brown,\" and Andrew Lang's \"My Own Fairy Book.\"    But lunch was still to be considered. The club is happy to add The  American Hotel, Hoboken, to its private list of places where it has  been serenely happy. Consider corned beef hash, with fried egg,  excellent, for 25 cents. Consider rhubarb pie, quite adequate, for  10 cents. Consider the courteous and urbane waiter. In one corner of  the dining room was the hotel office, with a large array of push  buttons communicating with the bedrooms. The club, its imagination  busy, conceived that these were for the purpose of awakening  seafaring guests early in the morning, so as not to miss their ship.  If we were, for instance, second mate of the _Hauppauge_, and came  to port in Hoboken, The American Hotel would be just the place where  we would want to put up.    That brings us back to the _Hauppauge_. We wonder who bought her,  and how much he paid; and why she carries the odd name of that Long  Island village? If he would only invite us over to see her--and tell  us how to get there!            [Illustration]        THE CLUB AT ITS WORST      A barbecue and burgoo of the Three Hours for Lunch Club was held,  the club's medical adviser acting as burgoomaster and Mr. Lawton  Mackall, the managing director, as jest of honour. The news that  Lawton was at large spread rapidly through the city, and the club  was trailed for some distance by an infuriated agent of the Society  for the Deracination of Puns. But Lawton managed to kick over his  traces, and the club safely gained the quiet haven of a Cedar Street  chophouse. Here, when the members were duly squeezed into a stall,  the Doctor gazed cheerfully upon Endymion and the Secretary who held  the inward places. \"Now is my chance,\" he cried, \"to kill two bards  with one stone.\"    Lawton, says the stenographic report, was in excellent form, and  committed a good deal of unforgivable syntax. He was somewhat  apprehensive when he saw the bill of fare inscribed \"Ye Olde Chop  House,\" for he asserts that the use of the word \"Ye\" always involves  extra overhead expense--and a quotation from Shakespeare on the back  of the menu, he doubted, might mean a couvert charge. But he was  distinctly cheered when the kidneys and bacon arrived--a long strip  of bacon gloriously balanced on four very spherical and  well-lubricated kidneys. Smiling demurely, even blandly, Lawton  rolled his sheave of bacon to and fro upon its kidneys. \"This is the  first time I ever saw bacon with ball bearings,\" he ejaculated. He  gazed with the eye of a connoisseur upon the rather candid works of  art hanging over the club's corner. He said they reminded him of Mr.  Coles Phillips's calf-tones. The Doctor was speaking of having  read an interesting dispatch by Mr. Grasty in the _Times_. \"I  understand,\" said Lawton, \"that he is going to collect some of his  articles in a book, to be called 'Leaves of Grasty'.\"    Duly ambered with strict and cloudy cider, the meal progressed,  served with humorous comments by the waitress whom the club calls  the Venus of Mealo. The motto"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15795"],[0,"The Rover Boys in Camp; or, The Rivals of Pine Island (#18)"],[1,"are twins,\" said the proprietor of the establishment.    \"Twins!\" cried Rockley. \"They didn't look it--not by their difference in  sizes.\"    \"But they did in looks,\" said Pender.    \"What are their names?\"    \"The tall one is Alice Staton and the other is Helen Staton. Their  father is the local constable, although he runs a big farm for a  living.\"    \"Do they come here often?\"    \"Pretty often. But they are very shy girls and don't hardly speak to  anybody. They are both studying to be school-teachers.\"    In the meantime Helen Staton and her sister Alice were hurrying down  the main street of Oakville with flushed cheeks.    \"I don't think those cadets were very nice,\" said Helen.    \"Certainly they were not very good-looking,\" replied Alice. \"And I  thought they smelt a little of liquor.\"    \"The idea of their saying they would show us the way to the camp! I  guess papa can drive us there if we want to go.\"    \"I'd like to see it. But I shouldn't want to go with those boys,\" went  on Alice.    \"Perhaps papa can take us,\" said Helen. \"But come, we promised mamma  we'd hurry back as soon as we could.\"    To get home the two girls had to walk for a considerable distance along  the road leading to Bass Lake.    On the way they passed the farm of one Isaac Klem, a man who took great  pride in his poultry and his cattle. Klem had forty cows, and two bulls  which were worth a good deal of money.    One of the bulls, a black, vicious looking fellow, was tied up in a  small lot at the corner of the farm.    The girls were just walking past this lot when Helen happened to glance  over her shoulder and set up a cry of alarm.    \"Oh, Alice, Mr. Klem's black bull is loose!\"    \"Where, Helen?\" queried her twin sister.    \"There he is, at the fence. See, he is trying to get over!\"    The fence she mentioned was of stones piled loosely, one on top of the  other. The bull was striking at the stones with his front hoofs. Soon  some came down, and then the animal leaped out into the roadway. Then  he gave a snort and looked at the girls curiously.    Now as ill luck would have it, each of the twins wore a red  shirt-waist. This color enraged the bull, and with a wild snort, he  lowered his horns and rushed at the pair, as if to gore them through  and through.          CHAPTER XX    THE ROVER BOYS AND THE BULL      About an hour after Lew Flapp and his cronies left camp, Dick Rover and  his brothers received permission to do likewise.    \"Let us go to the village,\" suggested Tom. \"I want to buy some cough  drops. My throat is raw from the wet weather.\"    \"And I want to get some reading matter,\" added Sam. \"A good story of  some sort would just suit me.\"    \"I wouldn't mind a magazine or two myself,\" came from Dick. \"But I  don't know if Oakville can supply them.\"    They were soon on the way, each in the best of spirits. Tom began to  whistle and his brothers joined in.    \"Feelin' putty good,\" queried a farmer, who chanced to be leaning over  his garden gate as they passed.    \"Why not?\" retorted Tom. \"It's better to whistle than to cry.\"    \"Right you are, young man. When one of my hands is whistling I always  know he is pitchin' in.\"    The way lay over a hill and around a bend where a number of apple trees  lined the road. The apples were within easy reach, and soon each was  chewing on the juicy fruit to his heart's content.    \"Wonder where Flapp and his crowd went,\" came presently from Tom.    \"If they went to Oakville they most likely visited the tavern,\"  answered Dick.    \"It's a shame!\" declared Tom. \"Drinking and smoking and playing cards  will never do them any good.\"    Another bend in the road was passed and they came within sight of Isaac  Klem's farm.    \"Hullo!\" ejaculated Sam, pointing ahead. \"What's the matter?\"    \"Those girls are running for all they are worth!\" said Dick.    \"A bull is after them!\" came from Tom. \"My stars! but he seems to mean  business!\"    Tom was right, Helen and Alice Staton were running along the highway at  all the speed they could command. Behind them, less than fifty feet  distant, was the enraged black bull, bent on doing all the mischief  possible.    \"Those girls will be hurt!\" said Dick, running forward.    \"Can't we do something?\" asked Sam.    \"We can try,\" said Tom. \"Get a rock, or something,\" and he picked up a  sharp stone which lay handy. Sam did likewise.    By this time the twins were almost upon the boys.    \"Chase the bull away!\" panted Helen, who was ready to drop from  exhaustion.    \"Yes! yes!\" gasped Alice. \"Please don't let him touch us!\"    \"Jump the fence!\" said Dick. \"Quick, I'll help you over!\"    He caught each girl by the hand and turned toward the low stone fence.  At the same time Tom and Sam let fly the two sharp stones. One took the  bull in the nose and the other struck the creature in the eye.    With a snort the animal came to a halt and viewed the boys curiously.  He had evidently not expected the attack, and the wound in the eye hurt  not a little. Tom and Sam lost no time in providing themselves with  more stones.    By this time Dick was at the wall and in another moment he had  assisted the girls over. Both had lost their hats and also dropped the  market basket filled with things from the store.    \"Oh, be careful,\" said Alice. \"That bull will try to kill you.\"    \"We'll look out for ourselves,\" answered Dick, and picked up a bit of  fence rail lying near. \"Did he chase you far?\"    \"From that lot yonder,\" answered Helen.    The bull had turned toward the fence, and watching his chance, Dick  struck out with the bit of rail. His aim was good and the animal  received a sharp blow directly across the nostrils. Then Sam and Tom  let fly more stones, and the bull was hit in the mouth, the leg, and  the side. He stood his ground for a moment and then began to retreat.    \"Hurrah! we've got him on the run!\" cried Tom. \"Give it to him!\" and he  let go another stone, which hit the bull in the tail and made him throw  up his rear hoofs in a most alarming fashion.    \"You had better come over into the lot!\" said one of the girls. \"He may  come back.\"    \"Here comes Mr. Klem with a pitchfork,\" said the other.    A farmer was rushing down the road, with a pitchfork in one hand and a  rope in the other. He ran up to the bull and slipped the rope over the  animal's neck. Then he tied the creature to a tree.    \"Pretty savage animal you've got,\" observed Tom as he came up.    \"Is them gals hurt?\" demanded the farmer.    \"I don't think so. But they are pretty well out of breath and scared.\"    \"Don't know how the pesky critter got loose,\" said Isaac Klem. \"First  thing I see he was after them gals lickety-split. I was out hayin', and  I didn't wait, but picked up a pitchfork and a rope and run.\"    \"The girls lost their hats,\" said Sam, who had also come up.    \"Yes, they're in the road up yonder, along with a basket o' stuff they  had.\"    \"Let us get the things,\" said Sam, and he and Tom started after the  hats and the basket. The things which had been in the basket were  scattered in all directions, and the boys picked them up.    Dick remained with the girls, doing what he could to quiet them. They  were so exhausted they could not stand and each sat on a rock panting  for breath.    \"It was simply dreadful!\" declared Helen. \"I thought every moment the  bull would catch me and toss me up into the air.\"    \"He didn't like the sight of your red shirt-waists,\" was Dick's  comment.    \"That must be it,\" put in Alice. \"After this, I don't think I'll go  near him when I have a red waist on.\"    \"Perhaps the farmer will be more careful and keep him roped up.\"    When Tom and Sam came up with the hats and the basket Isaac Klem  accompanied them.    \"All right, Helen?\" he asked. \"And you too, Alice?\"    \"Yes, Mr. Klem,\" said the tall girl. \"But it was a narrow escape. The  bull would have gored us if it hadn't been for these young gentlemen.\"    The girls thanked Tom and Sam for what they had brought.    \"Who be you young fellows?\" asked Isaac Klem curiously.    \"I am Dick Rover, and these are my brothers Tom and Sam. We belong to  the cadets of Putnam Hall.\"    \"The young sodgers up to Bass Lake?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I see. Well, it was gritty o' you to face my bull, and I give ye  credit for it. My name's Isaac Klem, and thet's my farm over yonder.  These gals is Helen and Alice Staton, and they live down the road a  piece.\"    The boys tipped their caps and the girls smiled.    \"We are very thankful to you,\" said Alice and Helen, almost in a  breath.    \"You are welcome to the little I did,\" returned Dick.    \"It was fun to pelt the old bull with rocks,\" put in Tom. \"I'll do as  much for you any time,\" and this caused a laugh.    Isaac Klem went off to drive his bull home and the girls also prepared  to depart.    \"When you are coming back this way you can stop at our house if you  wish,\" said Alice Staton. \"It's the yellow one with honeysuckle growing  over the porch.\"    \"I remember it,\" said Sam. \"Thank you,\" and the others also gave thanks  for the invitation. A moment later the two parties separated.    \"What a difference between those cadets and the ones we met at the  store,\" said Helen to her twin sister when they were out of hearing.    \"Yes, indeed,\" said Alice. \"The Rovers are gentlemen, while those at  the store were--were rude.\"    \"Two nice girls,\" declared Tom. \"How much alike their faces are!\"    \"Tom is smitten,\" cried Sam. \"Going to forget all about Nellie Laning,  Tom?\" he went on quizzically.    \"Oh, you needn't talk!\" cried Tom, growing red in the face. \"You were  just as attentive as a dancing master yourself.\"    \"Don't quarrel about it,\" put in Dick good naturedly. \"You can be  pleasant to them without forgetting all about Grace and Nellie Laning,  I think.\"    \"Or Dora Stanhope either,\" put in Sam slyly. \"Shall we stop at the  house on the way back?\"    \"Why not? They may offer us a piece of pie,\" said Tom.    \"I don't know. We can"]]]
