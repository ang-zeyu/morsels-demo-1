He threw himself down on the grass and began to eat with the  big bag of food in front of him.    But the enemy would not wait, and commenced to fire at him at once, till  it rained and hailed around him with bullets.    \"I don't mind these crowberries a bit,\" said the youngster, and went on  eating harder than ever. Neither lead nor iron took any effect upon him,  and his bag with food in front of him guarded him against the bullets as  if it were a rampart.    So they commenced throwing bomb-shells and firing cannons at him. He  only grinned a little every time he felt them.    \"They don't hurt me a bit,\" he said. But just then he got a bomb-shell  right down his windpipe.    \"Fy!\" he shouted, and spat it out again; but then a chain-shot made its  way into his butter-can, and another carried away the piece of food he  held between his fingers.    That made him angry; he got up and took his big club and struck the  ground with it, asking them if they wanted to take the food out of his  mouth, and what they meant by blowing crowberries at him with those  pea-shooters of theirs. He then struck the ground again till the hills  and rocks rattled and shook, and sent the enemy flying in the air like  chaff. This finished the war.    When he came home again, and asked for more work, the king was taken  quite aback, for he thought he should have got rid of him in the war. He  knew of nothing else but to send him on a message to the devil.    \"You had better go to the devil and ask him for my ground-rent,\" he  said. The youngster took his bag on his back, and started at once. He  was not long in getting there, but the devil was gone to court, and  there was no one at home but his mother, and she said that she had never  heard talk of any ground-rent. He had better call again another time.    \"Yes, call again to-morrow is always the cry,\" he said; but he was not  going to be made a fool of, he told her. He was there, and there he  would remain till he got the ground-rent. He had plenty of time to wait.  But when he had finished all the food in his bag, the time hung heavy on  his hands, and then he asked the old lady for the ground-rent again.  She had better pay it now, he said.    \"No, she was going to do nothing of the sort,\" she said. Her words were  as firm as the old fir tree just outside the gates, which was so big  that fifteen men could scarcely span it.    But the youngster climbed right up in the top of it and twisted and  turned it as if it was a willow, and then he asked her if she was going  to pay the ground-rent now.    Yes, she dared not do anything else, and scraped together as much money  as he thought he could carry in his bag. He then set out for home with  the ground-rent, but as soon as he was gone the devil came home. When he  heard that the youngster had gone off with his bag full of money, he  first of all gave his mother a hiding, and then he started after him,  thinking he would soon overtake him.    He soon came up to him, for he had nothing to carry, and now and then he  used his wings; but the youngster had, of course, to keep to the ground  with his heavy bag. Just as the devil was at his heels, he began to jump  and run as fast as he could. He kept his club behind him to keep the  devil off, and thus they went along, the youngster holding the handle  and the devil trying to catch hold of the other end of it, till they  came to a deep valley. There the youngster made a jump across from the  top of one hill to the other, and the devil was in such a hurry to  follow him that he ran his head against the club and fell down into the  valley and broke his leg, and there he lay.    \"There is the ground-rent,\" said the youngster when he came to the  palace, and threw the bag with the money to the king with such a crash  that you could hear it all over the hall.    The king thanked him, and appeared to be well pleased, and promised him  good pay and leave of absence if he wished it, but the youngster wanted  only more work.    \"What shall I do now?\" he said.    As soon as the king had had time to consider, he told him that he must  go to the hill-troll, who had taken his grandfather's sword. The troll  had a castle by the sea, where no one dared to go.    The youngster put some cartloads of food into his bag and set out again.  He travelled both long and far, over woods and hills and wild moors,  till he came to the big mountains where the troll, who had taken the  sword of the king's grandfather, was living.    But the troll seldom came out in the open air, and the mountain was well  closed, so the youngster was not man enough to get inside.    So he joined a gang of quarrymen who were living at a farm on top of the  hill, and who were quarrying stones in the hills about there. They had  never had such help before, for he broke and hammered away at the rocks  till the mountain cracked, and big stones of the size of a house rolled  down the hill. But when he rested to get his dinner, for which he was  going to have one of the cartloads in his bag, he found it was all eaten  up.    \"I have generally a good appetite myself,\" said the youngster; \"but the  one who has been here can do a trifle more than I, for he has eaten all  the bones as well.\"    Thus the first day passed; and he fared no better the second. On the  third day he set out to break stones again, taking with him the third  load of food, but he lay down behind the bag and pretended to be asleep.  All of a sudden, a troll with seven heads came out of the mountain and  began to eat his food.    \"It's all ready for me here, and I will eat,\" said the troll.    \"We will see about that,\" said the youngster, and hit the troll with his  club, so the heads rolled down the hill.    So he went into the mountain which the troll had come out of, and in  there stood a horse eating out of a barrel of glowing cinders, and  behind it stood a barrel of oats.    \"Why don't you eat out of the barrel of oats?\" asked the youngster.    \"Because I cannot turn round,\" said the horse.    \"But I will soon turn you round,\" said the youngster.    \"Rather cut my head off,\" said the horse.    So he cut its head off, and the horse turned into a fine handsome  fellow. He said he had been bewitched, and taken into the mountain and  turned into a horse by the troll. He then helped the youngster to find  the sword, which the troll had hidden at the bottom of the bed, and in  the bed lay the old mother of the troll, asleep and snoring hard.    So they set out for home by water, but when they had got some distance  out to sea the old mother came after them. As she could not overtake  them, she lay down and began to drink the sea, and she drank till the  water fell; but she could not drink the sea dry, and so she burst.    When they came to land, the youngster sent word that the king must come  and fetch the sword. He sent four horses, but no, they could not move  it; he sent eight, and he sent twelve; but the sword remained where it  was. They were not able to stir it from the spot. But the youngster took  it and carried it up to the palace alone.    The king could not believe his eyes when he saw the youngster back  again. He appeared, however, to be pleased to see him, and promised him  land and riches. When the youngster wanted more work, the king said he  might set out for an enchanted castle he had, where no one dared to  live, and he would have to stop there till he had built a bridge over  the sound, so that people could get across to the castle.    If he was able to do this he would reward him handsomely, yes, he would  even give him his daughter in marriage, said he.    \"Well, I think I can do it,\" said the youngster.    No one had ever got away alive; those who had got as far as the castle,  lay there killed and torn to pieces as small as barley, and the king  thought he should never see him any more if he would go thither.    But the youngster started on his expedition; he took with him the bag of  food, a crooked, twisted block of a fir tree, an axe, a wedge, and some  chips of the fir root, and the small pauper boy at the palace.    When he came to the sound, he found the river full of ice, and the  current ran as strong as in a waterfall; but he stuck his legs to the  bottom of the river and waded until he got safe across.    When he had warmed himself and had something to eat, he wanted to go to  sleep; but before long he heard such a terrible noise, as if they were  turning the castle upside down. The door burst wide open, and he saw  nothing but a gaping jaw extending from the threshold up to the lintel.    \"There is a mouthful for you,\" said the youngster and threw the pauper  boy into the swallow: \"taste that! But let me see now who you are!  Perhaps you are an old acquaintance?\"    And so it was; it was the devil who was about again.    They began to play cards, for the devil wanted to try and win back some  of the ground-rent which the youngster had got out of his mother by  threats, when he was sent by the king to collect it; but the youngster  was always the fortunate one, for he put a cross on the back of all the  good cards, and when he had won all the money which the devil had upon  him, the devil had to pay him out of the gold and silver which was in  the castle.    Suddenly the fire went out, so they could not tell the one card from the  other.    \"We must chop some wood now,\" said the youngster, who drove the axe into  the fir block, and forced the wedge in; but the twisted, knotty block  would not split, although the youngster worked as hard as he could with  the axe.    \"They say you are strong,\" he said to the devil; \"just spit on your  hands, stick your claws in, and tear away, and let me see what you are  made of.\"    The devil did so, and put both his fists into the split and pulled as  hard as he could, when the youngster suddenly struck the wedge out, and  the devil stuck fast in the block and the youngster let"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15170"],[0,"The Child's World: Third Reader (#18)"],[1,"w;    I have watched them and I know:      First, above the ground is seen    A tiny blade of purest green,    Reaching up and peeping forth    East and west, and south and north.

WISE MEN OF GOTHAM      Once upon a time there were some wise men who lived in Gotham. Listen  and you will hear how wise they were.    Twelve of these wise men went fishing one day. Some went into the stream  and some stayed on dry ground. They caught many fish and had a good  time.    As they came home, one of the men said, \"We have risked much wading in  that stream. I pray God no one of us is drowned.\"    \"Why, one of us might be! Who knows?\" cried another. \"Let's see about  it. Twelve of us went fishing this morning. We must count and see if  twelve are returning.\"    So one man counted, \"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,  nine, ten, eleven.\" And he did not count himself!    \"Alas! One of us is drowned!\" he cried.    \"Woe be unto us! Let me count,\" said another. And he did not count  himself.    \"Alas! alas!\" he wailed; \"truly one of us is drowned!\"    Then every man counted, and each one failed to count himself.    \"Alas! alas!\" they all cried; \"one of us is drowned! Which one is it?\"    They went back to the shore, and they looked up and down for him that  was drowned. All the time they were lamenting loudly.    A courtier came riding by. \"What are you seeking?\" he asked, \"and why  are you so sorrowful?\"    \"Oh,\" said they, \"this day we came to fish in the stream. There were  twelve of us, but one is drowned.\"    \"Why,\" said the courtier, \"count yourselves and see how many there be.\"    Again they counted, and again each man failed to count himself.    \"Well, this is sad,\" said the courtier, who saw how the mistake had been  made. \"What will you give me if I find the twelfth man?\"    \"Sir,\" cried all together, \"you may have all the money we own.\"    \"Give me the money,\" said the courtier.    Then he began to count. He gave the first man a whack over the shoulders  and said, \"There is one.\"    He gave the next a whack and said, \"There is two.\" And so he counted  until he came to the last man. He gave this one a sounding blow, saying,  \"And here is the twelfth.\"    \"God bless you!\" cried all the company. \"You have found our neighbor.\"    --OLD ENGLISH STORY.          THE MILLER'S GUEST    I      A hunter who had ridden ahead in the chase was lost. The sun went down,  and darkness fell upon the forest. The hunter blew his horn, but no  answer came. What should he do?    At last he heard the sound of horse's hoofs. Some one was coming. Was it  friend or foe? The hunter stood still, and soon a miller rode out into  the moonlight.    \"Pray, good fellow, be so kind as to tell me the way to Nottingham,\"  said the hunter.    \"Nottingham? Why should you be going to Nottingham? The king and his  court are there. It is not a place for the like of you,\" replied the  miller.    \"Well, well, perhaps you are right, good miller,\" said the hunter. \"And  yet who knows? I'll wager that the king is no better man than I am.  However, it is getting late, and lodging I must have. Will you give me  shelter for the night?\"    \"Nay, nay, not so fast,\" said the miller. \"Stand forth and let me see if  you are a true man. Many thieves wear fine clothes these days.\"    The hunter stepped forward. \"Well, and what do you think of me?\" he  asked gayly. \"Will you not give a stranger lodging?\"    \"How do I know that you have one penny in your purse?\" asked the miller.  \"You may carry your all on your back, for aught I know. I've heard of  lords who are like that.\"    \"True, good miller, but I have gold. If it be forty pence, I will pay  it,\" said the hunter.    \"If you are a true man, and have the pence, then lodging you may have.  My good wife may not like it, but we'll see,\" said the miller.    \"Good!\" cried the hunter. \"And here's my hand on it.\"    \"Nay, nay, not so fast,\" replied the miller. \"I must know you better  before I shake hands. None but an honest man's hand will I take.\"    \"Some day, my good miller,\" replied the hunter, \"I hope to have you take  my hand in yours. Proud will I be when the day comes.\"      II      And so to the miller's house they went. The miller again looked at the  stranger and said, \"I like his face well. He may stay with us, may he  not, good wife?\"    \"Yes, he is a handsome youth, but it's best not to go too fast,\" said  the good wife. \"He may be a runaway servant. Let him show his passport,  and all shall be well.\"    The hunter bowed low, and said, \"I have no passport, good dame, and I  never was any man's servant. I am but a poor courtier who has lost his  way. Pray give me lodging for the night. Your kindness I will surely  repay.\"    Then the wife whispered to the miller, \"The youth is of good manners and  to turn him out would be sin.\"    \"Yea, a well-mannered youth--and one who knows his betters when he sees  them,\" the miller replied. \"Let the lad stay.\"    \"Well, young man,\" said the wife, \"you are welcome here; and well lodged  you shall be, though I do say it myself. You shall have a fresh bed with  good brown sheets.\"    \"Aye,\" said the miller, \"and you shall sleep with our own son Richard.\"    Then they all sat down to supper--such a supper: pudding, apple pie, and  good things of all kinds. Then at a wink from the miller, the wife  brought out a venison pasty.    \"Eat!\" said the miller. \"This is dainty food.\"    \"Faith!\" cried the hunter, \"I never before ate such meat.\"    \"Pshaw!\" said Richard. \"We eat this every day.\"    \"Every day? Where do you buy it?\"    \"Oh, never a penny pay we. In merry Sherwood Forest we find it. Now and  then, you see, we make bold with the king's deer.\"    \"Then I think that it is venison,\" said the hunter.    \"To be sure. Any fool would know that,\" replied Richard; \"but say  nothing about it. We would not have the king hear of it.\"    \"I'll keep your secret,\" said the hunter. \"Don't fear. The king shall  never know more than he knows now.\"    And so the evening passed merrily. It was late when the guest sought his  bed, but right soundly did he sleep.    The next morning the miller, the good wife, and Richard came out to see  the hunter on his way. Just then a party of nobles rode up.    \"There's the king!\" cried one.    \"Pardon, your majesty!\" cried another, and all fell upon their knees  before the hunter.    The miller stood shaking and quaking, and for once his wife could not  speak. The king, with a grave face, drew his sword, but not a word did  he say.    The terrified miller threw himself at his ruler's feet, crying out for  mercy. Again the sword was raised, and down it fell, but lightly, upon  the miller's shoulder, and the king said:    [Illustration: The king knights the miller]    \"Your kind courtesy I will repay; so I here dub thee Knight. Rise, Sir  John of Mansfield.\"    For many a day the miller and his wife told of the night the king spent  with them. And for many a day the king told of the time he was taken for  a thief and ate of his own deer in the miller's house.    --ENGLISH BALLAD (Adapted).          SADDLE TO RAGS    I        This story I'm going to sing,      I hope it will give you content,    Concerning a silly old man      That was going to pay his rent,    With a till-a-dill, till-a-dill-dill,      Till-a-dill, dill-a-dill, dee,    Sing fol-de-dill, dill-de-dill, dill,      Fol-de-dill, dill-de-dill, dee.    A silly old man said to his wife one day, \"Well, 'tis time I paid my  rent. The landlord has been away for a year and a day, but now he is  back, and I must pay for twelve months.\"    \"Yes, it's twice forty pounds that is due, and it should be paid,\" said  the good wife. \"So much money in the house keeps me from sleeping at  night.\"    \"Well, I'll bridle old Tib, and away we shall go,\" said the old man.  \"Right glad I'll be, too, to be rid of the gold.\"    The silly old man bridled old Tib and saddled her too. And away they  started. As he was jogging along, a stranger came riding up on a fine  horse with fine saddle bags.    \"Good morning, old man,\" said the stranger.    \"Good morning,\" said the old man.    \"How far are you going?\"    \"To tell the truth, kind sir, I am going just two miles,\" said the old  man.    \"And where are you going?\" asked the stranger.    \"I am going to pay my rent, kind sir,\" said the old man. \"I am but a  silly old man who farms a piece of ground. My rent for a half year is  forty pounds; but my landlord has been away for a year, and now I owe  him eighty pounds. Right glad I am to pay it.\"    \"Eighty pounds! That is indeed a large sum,\" cried the stranger, \"and  you ought not to tell anybody you carry so much. There are many thieves  about, and you might be robbed.\"    \"Oh, never mind!\" said the old man. \"I do not fear thieves. My money is  safe in my saddle bags, on which I ride.\"    So they rode along most pleasantly.    When they came to a thick wood, the stranger pulled out a pistol and  said, \"Stand still, and give me your money.\"    \"Nay,\" said the old man. \"The money is for my landlord. I will not give  it to you.\"    \"Your money or your life!\"    \"Well, if you will have it, you can go for it,\" cried the old man, as he  threw his old saddle bags over a hedge.    The thief dismounted and said, \"Stand here and hold my horse while I go  over the hedge. You are silly, but surely you can do that.\"    The thief climbed through the hedge. When he was on the other side, the  old man got on the thief's horse, and away he galloped.    \"Stop, stop!\" cried the thief. \"And half of my share "]]]
