Take half a quartern of dough, one gill of the best Florence oil,  half a pound of currants, half a pound of moist sugar, and a little  cinnamon; mix all well together, make it up in the form of a twist,  and bake it.           *       *       *       *       *    CINNAMON CAKES.    Rub half a pound of fresh butter into a pound of flour; work it well  together, then add half a pound of sifted sugar, and a tea-spoonful of  pounded cinnamon, and make it into a paste, with three eggs; roll it,  and cut into small cakes, with tin cutters.           *       *       *       *       *    RICH PLUM CAKE.    Beat to a cream one pound of butter, to which add the same quantity of  sifted loaf sugar and of fine flour, the whites of ten eggs beaten to  a froth, and the yolks of the same also beaten till quite smooth  and thin, and half a nutmeg grated; lastly, work in one pound of  well-washed currants, half a pound of mixed candied peels, cut small,  and a glass of brandy; bake for two hours.           *       *       *       *       *    DIET-BREAD CAKE.    Beat together five eggs and half a pound of white sugar, then add six  ounces of flour well dried and sifted, a little lemon-juice and grated  lemon-peel; bake in a moderate oven.           *       *       *       *       *    DROP CAKES.    Mix one pound of flour with the same quantity of butter, sugar, and  currants; make these into a paste with a couple of eggs, add a little  orange flower-water and a little white wine; if the paste is likely  to be too thin when two eggs are used, omit the white of one; drop the  mixture when ready on a tin plate, and bake.           *       *       *       *       *    A COMMON CAKE.    Rub in with one pound of flour six ounces of butter, and two  tea-spoonsful of yeast, to a paste; set it to rise, then mix in five  eggs, half a pound of sugar, and a quarter of a pint of milk; add  currants or carraways, and beat well together. If required to  be richer, put more butter and eggs, and add candied citron and  lemon-peel.           *       *       *       *       *    A SODA CAKE.    Mix with the above ingredients one drachm of soda, which should be  rubbed in with the flour. This is reckoned a wholesome cake, and half  the quantity of eggs are required, or it may be rendered a fine rich  cake by increasing the quantity of eggs, butter, and fruit.           *       *       *       *       *    A PLAIN CAKE.    Work into two pounds of dough a quarter of a pound of sugar, the same  of butter; add a couple of eggs, and bake in a tin.           *       *       *       *       *    A POUND CAKE.    Beat to cream a pound of butter and a pound of sifted loaf sugar; add  eight beaten eggs, stir in lightly three quarters of a pound of flour,  beat well together, and bake for one hour in a brisk oven; currants  may be added if, approved.           *       *       *       *       *    BUTTER CAKES.    Take equal quantities of butter and sugar, say half a pound of each,  grate the rind of a lemon, add a little cinnamon, and as much flour  as will form it into a paste, with spice and eggs; roll it out, cut  it into two small cakes, and bake. A piece of candied orange or  lemon-peel may be put on the top of each cake.           *       *       *       *       *    LITTLE SHORT CAKES.    Rub into a pound of flour four ounces of butter, four ounces of white  powdered sugar, and two eggs; make it into a paste, roll it thin, and  cut into small cakes with tin cutters. A little orange flower-water or  sweet wine improve the flavour of these cakes.           *       *       *       *       *    MATSO CAKES.    Make a stiff paste with biscuit powder and milk and water; add a  little butter, the yolk of an egg, and a little white sugar; cut into  pieces, and mould with the hand, and bake in a brisk oven. These cakes  should not be too thin.           *       *       *       *       *    ANOTHER SORT.    Warm a quarter of a pint of water flavoured with a little salt, in  which mix four beaten eggs; then mix half a pound of matso flour, and  a couple of lumps of white sugar, and half a teacup of milk; mix all  well together, and bake in a tin.           *       *       *       *       *    FRIED MATSOS.    Soak some of the thickest matsos in milk, taking care they do not  break; then fry in boiling fresh butter. This is a very nice method of  preparing them for breakfast or tea.           *       *       *       *       *    MATSO DIET BREAD.    Simmer one pound of white sugar in a quarter of a pint of water, which  pour hot upon eight well-beaten eggs; beat till cold, when add one  pound of matso flour, a little grated lemon-peel, and bake in a  papered tin, or in small tins; the cake must be removed while hot.           *       *       *       *       *    A CAKE WITHOUT BUTTER.    Beat well five eggs, to which add six ounces of flour; flavour with  beaten almonds, and add, if liked, thin slices of citron; bake in a  mould in a moderate oven.           *       *       *       *       *    SPONGE CAKES.    Mix six eggs, half the whites, half a pound of lump sugar, half a  pound of flour, and a quarter of a pint of water, which should be  strongly flavoured by lemon peel having been in it for some hours;  the sugar and water should boil up together, and poured over the eggs  after they have been well whisked, which must be continued while the  liquid is being poured over them, and until they become quite thick  and white, then stir in the flour, which must be warm and dry. Pour  the mixture into a couple of cake tins, and bake in a gentle oven.           *       *       *       *       *    A NICE BREAKFAST CAKE.    Make a paste of half a pound of flour, one ounce of butter, a very  little salt, two eggs, and a table-spoonful of milk, roll it out, but  first set it to rise before the fire; cut it into cakes the size of  small cheese plates, sprinkle with flour, and bake on a tin in a brisk  oven, or they may be fried in a clean frying pan; they should be cut  in half, buttered hot, and served quickly.           *       *       *       *       *    ICING FOR CAKES.    Whisk half a pound of sifted white sugar, with one wine glass of  orange flower-water, and the whites of two eggs, well beaten and  strained; it must be whisked until it is quite thick and white; and  when the cake is almost cold, dip a soft camel's hair brush into it,  and cover the cake well, and set it in a cool oven to harden.           *       *       *       *       *    TO CLARIFY SUGAR.    Take the proportion of one pound of sugar to half a pint of water,  with the whites of a couple of eggs; boil it up twice, then set it by  for the impurities to rise to the top, and skim it carefully.          CHAPTER VIII.      Preserving and Bottling.    Attention and a little practice will ensure excellence in such  preserves as are in general use in private families; and it will  always be found a more economical plan to purchase the more rare and  uncommon articles of preserved fruits than to have them made at home.    The more sugar that is added to fruit the less boiling it requires.    If jellies be over-boiled, much of the sugar will become candied, and  leave the jelly thin.    Every thing used for the purpose of preserving should be clean and  very dry, particularly bottles for bottled fruit.    Fruit should boil rapidly _before_ the sugar is added, and quietly  afterwards--when preserves seem likely to become mouldy, it is  generally a sign they have not been sufficiently boiled, and it will  be requisite to boil them up again--fruit for bottling should not be  too ripe, and should be perfectly fresh; there are various methods  adopted by different cooks: the fruit may be placed in the bottles,  and set in a moderate oven until considerably shrunken, when the  bottles should be removed and closely corked; or the bottles may be  set in a pan with cold water up to the necks, placed over the fire;  when the fruit begins to sink remove them, and when cold fill up each  bottle with cold spring water, cork the bottles, and lay them on their  sides in a dry place.    To bottle red currants--pick them carefully from the stalk, and add,  as the currants are put in, sifted white sugar; let the bottles  be well filled and rosin the corks, and keep them with their necks  downwards.           *       *       *       *       *    BRANDIED CHERRIES.    Put into a large wide mouthed bottle very ripe black cherries, add to  them two pounds of loaf sugar, a quart of brandy, and a few cloves,  then bruise a few more cherries, and simmer with sugar, strain and add  the juice to the cherries in the bottle, cork closely, and keep in a  warm dry place.           *       *       *       *       *    QUINCE MARMALADE.    Peel, cut into quarters, and core two pounds of sharp apples, and the  same quantity of quinces; put them into a jar, with one pound of white  sugar powdered and sprinkled over them; cover them with half a pint  of water, and put in also a little bruised cochineal tied in a muslin.  Set them in a slack oven till tender, take out the cochineal, and pulp  the fruit to a marmalade.    Some cooks prefer boiling the sugar and water first and scalding the  fruit till tender, and then adding them to the syrup.           *       *       *       *       *    DAMSON MARMALADE.    Is made in the same manner as quince, as also apricot marmalade, which  is very fine; the fruit must be stoned, and some of the kernels put in  with the fruit, which are peeled, and apricots are cut in pieces; they  should be carefully pulped through a clean sieve.           *       *       *       *       *    PRESERVED APRICOTS.    Halve and pare ripe apricots, or if not quite ripe, boil them till the  skin can easily be removed. Lay them in a dish hollow downwards,  sift over them their own weight of white sugar, let them lay for some  hours, then put the fruit, with the sugar and juice"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1233"],[0,"The Origin and Nature of the Emotions; Miscellaneous Papers (#18)"],[1,"the distance ceptors control these activities, one would expect to  find that they control also those organs whose function is the production  of energizing internal secretions.  Over these organs--the thyroid,  the adrenals, the hypophysis--the contact ceptors have no control.  Prolonged laboratory experimentation seems to prove this postulate.  According to our observations, no amount of physical trauma inflicted upon  animals will cause hyperthyroidism or increased adrenalin in the blood,  while fear and rage do produce hyperthyroidism and increased adrenalin  (Fig. 44) (Cannon). This is a statement of far-reaching importance  and is the key to an explanation of many chronic diseases--  diseases which are associated with the intense stimulation of  the distance ceptors in human relations.    Stimuli of the contact ceptors differ from stimuli of the distance  ceptors in still another important particular.  The adequacy of stimuli  of the contact ceptors depends upon their number and intensity,  while the adequacy of the stimuli of the distance ceptors depends  upon the EXPERIENCE of the species and of the individual.  That is, according to phylogeny and ontogeny this or that sound,  this or that smell, this or that sight, through association  recapitulates the experience of the species and of the individual--  awakens the phylogenetic and ontogenetic memory.  In other words, sights,  sounds, and odors are symbols which awaken phylogenetic association.  If a species has become adapted to make a specific response to a  certain object, then that response will occur automatically in an  individual of that species when he hears, sees, or smells that object.  Suppose, for example, that the shadow of a hawk were to fall  simultaneously on the eyes of a bird, a rabbit, a cow, and a boy.  That shadow would at once activate the rabbit and the bird to an  endeavor to escape, each in a specific manner according to its  phylogenetic adaptation; the cow would be indifferent and neutral;  while the boy, according to his personal experience or ontogeny,  might remain neutral, might watch the flight of the hawk with interest  or might try to shoot it.    Each phylogenetic and each ontogenetic experience by an indirect  method develops its own mechanism of adaptation in the brain;  and the brain threshold is raised or lowered to stimuli by  the strength and frequency of repetition of the experience.  Thus through the innumerable symbols supplied by environment the distance  ceptors drive this or that animal according to the type of brain  pattern and the particular state of threshold which has been developed  in that animal by its phylogenetic and ontogenetic experiences.  The brain pattern depends upon his phylogeny, the state of threshold  upon his ontogeny.  Each BRAIN PATTERN is created by some particular  element in the environment to which an adaptation has been made  for the good of the species.  The _*state of threshold_ depends  upon the effect made upon the individual by his personal contacts  with that particular element in his environment.  The presence  of that element produces in the individual an associative recall  of the adaptation of his species--that is, the brain pattern developed  by his phylogeny becomes energized to make a specific response.  The intensity of the response depends upon the state of threshold--  that is, upon the associative recall of the individual's  own experience--his ontogeny.    If the full history of the species and of the individual  could be known in every detail, then every detail of that  individual's conduct in health and disease could be predicted.  Reaction to environment is the basis of conduct, of moral standards,  of manners and conventions, of work and play, of love and hate,  of protection and murder, of governing and being governed, in fact,  of all the reactions between human beings--of the entire web of life.  To quote Sherrington once more:  \"Environment drives the brain,  the brain drives the various organs of the body.\"    By what means are these adaptations made?  What is the mechanism through  which adequate responses are made to the stimuli received by the ceptors?  We postulate that in the brain there are innumerable patterns  each the mechanism for the performance of a single kind of action,  and that the brain-cells supply the energy--electric or otherwise--  by which the act is performed; that the energy stored in the brain-cells  is in some unknown manner released by the force which activates  the brain pattern; and that through an unknown property of these brain  patterns each stimulus causes such a change that the next stimulus  of the same kind passes with greater facility.    Each separate motor action presumably has its own mechanism--  brain pattern--which is activated by but one ceptor and by  that ceptor only when physical force of a certain intensity  and rate of motion is applied.  This is true both of the visible  contacts affecting the nociceptors and of the invisible contacts  by those intangible forces which affect the distance ceptors.  For example, each variation in speed of the light-producing  waves of ether causes a specific reaction in the brain.  For one speed of ether waves the reaction is the perception  of the color blue; for another, yellow; for another, violet.  Changes in the speed of air waves meet with specific response  in the brain patterns tuned to receive impressions through the  aural nerves, and so we distinguish differences in sound pitch.  If we can realize the infinite delicacy of the mechanisms adapted  to these infinitesimal variations in the speed and intensity of  invisible and intangible stimuli, it will not be difficult to conceive  the variations of brain patterns which render possible the specific  responses to the coarser contacts of visible environment.    Each brain pattern is adapted for but one type of motion,  and so the specific stimuli of the innumerable ceptors play  each upon its own brain pattern only.  In addition, each brain  pattern can react to stimuli applied only within certain limits.  Too bright a light blinds; too loud a sound deafens.  No mechanism  is adapted for waves of light above or below a certain rate of speed,  although this range varies in different individuals and in different  species according to the training of the individual and the need  of the species.    We have already referred to the fact that there is no receptive  mechanism adapted to the stimuli from the _x_-ray, from the  high-speed bullet, from electricity.  So, too, there are innumerable  forces in nature which can excite in man no adaptive response,  since there exist in man no brain patterns tuned to their waves,  as in the case of certain ethereal and radioactive forces.    On this mechanistic basis the emotions may be explained as activations  of the entire motor mechanism for fighting, for escaping, for copulating.  The sight of an enemy stimulates in the brain those patterns formed  by the previous experiences of the individual with that enemy, and also  the experiences of the race whenever an enemy had to be met and overcome.  Each of these many brain patterns in turn activates that part of  the body through which lies the path of its own adaptive response--  those parts including the special energizing or activating organs.  Laboratory experiments show that in an animal driven strongly  by emotion the following changes may be seen:  (1) A mobilization  of the energy-giving compound in the brain-cells, evidenced by a  primary increase of the Nissl substance and a later disappearance  of this substance and the deterioration of the cells (Figs. 5 and 13);  (2) increased output of adrenalin (Cannon), of thyroid secretion,  of glycogen, and an increase of the power of oxidation in the muscles;  (3) accelerated circulation and respiration with increased  body temperature; (4) altered metabolism.  All these are adaptations  to increase the motor efficiency of the mechanism.  In addition,  we find an inhibition of the functions of every organ and tissue that  consumes energy, but does not contribute directly to motor efficiency.  The mouth becomes dry; the gastric and pancreatic secretions are  lessened or are completely inhibited; peristaltic action stops.  The obvious purpose of all these activations and inhibitions is  to mass every atom of energy upon the muscles that are conducting  the defense or attack.    So strong is the influence of phylogenetic experience that though  an enemy to-day may not be met by actual physical attack,  yet the decks are cleared for action, as it were, and the weapons  made ready, the body as a result being shaken and exhausted.  The type of emotion is plainly declared by the activation  of the muscles which would be used if the appropriate physical  action were consummated.  In anger the teeth are set, the fists  are clenched, the posture is rigid; in fear the muscles collapse,  the joints tremble, and the running mechanism is activated  for flight; in sexual excitement the mimicry is as obvious.  The emotions, then, are the preparations for phylogenetic activities.  If the activities are consummated, the fuel--glycogen--and the activating  secretions from the thyroid, the adrenals, the hypophysis are consumed.  In the activation without action, these products must be eliminated  as waste products and so a heavy strain is put upon the organs  of elimination.  It is obvious that the body under emotion might be  clarified by active muscular exercise, but the subject of the emotion  is so strongly integrated thereby that it is difficult for him  to engage in diverting, clarifying exertion.  The person in anger  does not want to be saved from the ill effects of his own emotion;  he wants only to fight; the person in fear wants only to escape;  the person under sexual excitement wants only possession.    All the lesser emotions--worry, jealousy, envy, grief, disappointment,"]]]
