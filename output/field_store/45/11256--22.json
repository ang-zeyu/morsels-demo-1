On our return we only came eight miles out of our way.        CHAPTER V.  THE VOYAGE ROUND CAPE HORN.        DEPARTURE FROM RIO JANEIRO--SANTOS AND ST. PAULO--CIRCUMNAVIGATION  OF CAPE HORN--THE STRAITS OF MAGELLAN--ARRIVAL IN VALPARAISO--8TH  DECEMBER, 1846, TO 2ND MARCH, 1847.    When I paid 25 pounds for my place in the fine English barque, \"John  Renwick,\" Captain Bell, the latter promised me that he would be  ready to sail on the 25th of November at the latest, and would stop  at no intermediate port, but shape his course direct to Valparaiso.  The first part of this promise I believed, because he assured me  that every day he stopped cost him 7 pounds; and the second,  because, as a general rule, I willingly believe every one, even ship  captains.  In both particulars, however, was I deceived; for it was  not until the 8th of December that I received a notice to go on  board that evening and then for the first time the captain informed  me that he must run into Santos, to lay in a stock of provisions,  which were there much cheaper than in Rio Janeiro; that he also  intended clearing out a cargo of coal and taking in another of  sugar.  He did not tell me till we arrived in Santos itself, where  he also assured me that all these different matters would not take  him more than three or four days.    I took leave of my friends and went on board in the evening; Count  Berchthold and Messrs. Geiger and Rister accompanying me to the  ship.    Early in the morning of the 9th of December we weighed anchor, but  the wind was so unfavourable that we were obliged to tack the whole  day in order to gain the open sea, and it was not until about 10  A.M. that we lost sight of land.    There were eight passengers besides myself; five Frenchmen, one  Belgian, and two citizens of Milan.  I looked upon the latter as  half countrymen of mine, and we were soon very good friends.    It was the second time this year that the two Italians were making  the voyage round Cape Horn.  Their first had not been fortunate;  they reached Cape Horn in winter, which in those cold southern  latitudes lasts from April till about November. {53}  They were  unable to circumnavigate the Cape, being driven back by violent  contrary winds and storms, against which they strove for fourteen  weary days without making the least progress.  The crew now lost  courage, and affirmed that it would be advisable to turn back and  wait for more favourable winds.  The captain, however, was not of  this opinion, and succeeded so well in working upon the pride of the  crew that they once more engaged in their conflict with the  elements.  It was, however, for the last time, for the very same  night a tremendous sea broke over the ship, tearing away all her  upper works, and sweeping the captain and six of the sailors  overboard.  The water poured in torrents into the cabins, and drove  every one from the berths.  The bulwarks, boats, and binnacle were  carried clean off, and the mainmast had to be cut away.  The sailors  then turned the ship about, and after a long and dangerous voyage,  succeeded in bringing her, dismasted as she was, into Rio Janeiro.    This story was not very encouraging, but the fine weather and our  good ship relieved us of all anxiety.  With regard to the vessel, we  could not have chosen a better.  It had large, comfortable cabins,  an exceedingly good-natured and obliging captain, and a bill of fare  which must have contented the most dainty palate.  Every day we had  roast or stewed fowls, ducks, or geese, fresh mutton or pork, eggs  variously prepared, plum-pudding and tarts; to all this were added  side dishes of ham, rice, potatoes, and other vegetables; and for  dessert, dried fruit, nuts, almonds, cheese, etc.  There was also  plenty of bread, fresh baked every day, and good wine.  We all  unanimously acknowledged that we had never been so well treated, or  had so good a table in any sailing vessel before; and we could,  therefore, in this respect, look forward to our voyage without any  apprehension.    On the 12th of December we hove in sight of the mountain ranges of  Santos, and at 9 o'clock the same evening we reached a bay which the  captain took for that of the same name.  Lighted torches were  repeatedly held over the vessel's side to summon a pilot; no pilot,  however, made his appearance, and we were therefore obliged to trust  to chance, and anchor at the mouth of the bay.    On the morning of the 13th a pilot came on board, and astonished us  with the intelligence that we had anchored before the wrong bay.  We  had some trouble in working our way out, and anchoring about noon in  the right one.  A pretty little chateau-like building immediately  attracted our attention.  We took it for some advanced building of  the town, and congratulated one another on having reached our  temporary destination so quickly.  On approaching nearer, however,  we could perceive no signs of the town, and learned that the  building was a small fort, and that Santos was situated in a second  bay, communicating with the first by a small arm of the sea.  Unluckily, the wind had by this time fallen, and we were obliged to  be at anchor all day, and it was not until the 14th that a slight  breeze sprang up and wafted us into port.    Santos is most charmingly situated at the entrance of a large  valley.  Picturesque hills, adorned with chapels and detached  houses, rise on each side, and immediately beyond are considerable  mountain ranges, spreading in a semi-circle round the valley, while  a lovely island forms a most beautiful foreground to the whole.    We had scarcely landed before the captain informed us that we must  stop for at least five days.  The Italians, one of the Frenchmen,  and myself determined that we would take advantage of this delay to  make an excursion to St. Paulo, the largest inland town of the  Brazils, and about forty miles from Santos.  The same evening we  hired mules, for which we paid five milreis (10s. 10d.) each, and  set out upon our trip.    15th December.  Early in the morning, we armed ourselves with well-  charged double-barrelled pistols, having been alarmed by accounts of  the Maroon negroes, {55} about a hundred of whom were said to be at  that time lurking in the mountains, and to be so daring that they  extended their inroads as far as the vicinity of Santos itself.    The first eight miles led through the valley to the lofty range of  mountains which we had to cross.  The road was good, and more  frequented than any I had yet seen in the Brazils.  Handsome wooden  bridges traverse the rivers Vicente and Cubatao; one of these  bridges is actually covered, but then every one is charged a pretty  high toll.    In one of the vendas at the foot of the mountain we fortified  ourselves with some excellent pan-cakes, laid in a stock of sugar-  canes, the juice of which is excessively refreshing in the great  heat, and then proceeded to scale the Serra, 3,400 feet high.  The  road was execrable; full of holes, pits, and puddles, in which our  poor beasts often sank above their knees.  We had to skirt chasms  and ravines, with torrents rolling loudly beneath, yet not visible  to us, on account of the thick underwood which grew over them.  Some  part of the way, too, lay through virgin forests, which, however,  were not nearly so beautiful or thick as some I had traversed on my  excursion to the Puris.  There were hardly any palm-trees, and the  few there were, reminded us, from their thin stems and scanty  foliage, of those of a colder climate.    The prospect from the Serra struck us all with astonishment.  The  entire valley with its woods and prairies was spread far and wide  before our sight as far as the bays, the little detached huts being  quite indistinguishable, while only a part of the town and a few  masts of ships were perceptible in the distance.    A turning in the road soon shut out this charming picture from our  gaze; we then left the Serra and entered upon a woody, uneven tract,  alternating with large level grass-plots, covered with low  brushwood, and innumerable mole-hills, two feet high.    Half way from Santos to St. Paulo is a place called Rio Grande, the  houses of which lie, after the Brazilian fashion, so far apart, that  no one would suppose they had any connection with each other.  The  owner of the mules used on this journey resides here, and here,  likewise, the money for their hire is paid.  If the traveller  desires to proceed immediately he has fresh mules given him, but,  should he prefer stopping the afternoon or night, he finds very good  victual and clean rooms, for which he has nothing to pay, as they  are included in the five milreis (10s. 10d.), charged for the mules.    We snatched a hasty morsel or two, and then hurried on, in order to  complete the second half of the road before sunset.  The plain  became broader and broader the nearer we approached the town; the  beauty of the scenery falls off very much, and for the first time  since I left Europe, did I see fields and hills of sand.  The town  itself, situated upon a hill, presents a tolerable appearance; it  contains about 22,000 inhabitants, and is a place of considerable  importance for the internal commerce of the country.  In spite of  this, however, it has neither an inn nor any other place where  strangers can alight.    After inquiring for a long time in vain for lodgings, we were  directed to a German and a Frenchman, with the remark that both  received lodgers out of pure politeness.  We first went to the  German, who very bluntly cut us short by saying that he had no room.  From him we proceeded to the Frenchman, who sent us to a Portuguese,  and on visiting the latter we received the same answer we had  obtained from the German.    We were now"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11074"],[0,"The Damned (#18)"],[1,"I remembered her riches, and how gladly a  Society would gobble them.    \"The layers I told you about,\" she continued calmly, shrugging her  shoulders slightly--\"the deposits that are left behind by strong  thinking and real belief--but especially by ugly, hateful belief,  because, you see--unfortunately there's more vital passion in that  sort--\"    \"Frances, I don't understand a bit,\" I said out loud, but said it a  little humbly, for the impression the man had left was still strong upon  me and I was grateful for the steady sense of peace and comfort he had  somehow introduced. The horrors had been so dreadful. My nerves,  doubtless, were more than a little overstrained. Absurd as it must  sound, I classed him in my mind with the robins, the happy, confiding  robins who believed in everybody and thought no evil! I laughed a moment  at my ridiculous idea, and my sister, encouraged by this sign of  patience in me, continued more fluently.    \"Of course you don't understand, Bill? Why should you? You've never  thought about such things. Needing no creed yourself, you think all  creeds are rubbish.\"    \"I'm open to conviction--I'm tolerant,\" I interrupted.    \"You're as narrow as Sam Franklyn, and as crammed with prejudice,\" she  answered, knowing that she had me at her mercy.    \"Then, pray, what may be his, or his Society's beliefs?\" I asked,  feeling no desire to argue, \"and how are they going to prove your  Mabel's salvation? Can they bring beauty into all this aggressive hate  and ugliness?\"    \"Certain hope and peace,\" she said, \"that peace which is understanding,  and that understanding which explains all creeds and therefore tolerates  them.\"    \"Toleration! The one word a religious man loathes above all others! His  pet word is damnation--\"    \"Tolerates them,\" she repeated patiently, unperturbed by my explosion,  \"because it includes them all.\"    \"Fine, if true\" I admitted, \"very fine. But how, pray, does it include  them all?\"    \"Because the key-word, the motto, of their Society is, 'There is no  religion higher than Truth,' and it has no single dogma of any kind.  Above all,\" she went on, \"because it claims that no individual can be  'lost.' It teaches universal salvation. To damn outsiders is  uncivilized, childish, impure. Some take longer than others--it's  according to the way they think and live--but all find peace, through  development, in the end. What the creeds call a hopeless soul, it  regards as a soul having further to go. There is no damnation--\"    \"Well, well,\" I exclaimed, feeling that she rode her hobby horse too  wildly, too roughly over me, \"but what is the bearing of all this upon  this dreadful place, and upon Mabel? I'll admit that there is this  atmosphere--this--er--inexplicable horror in the house and grounds, and  that if not of damnation exactly, it is certainly damnable. I'm not too  prejudiced to deny that, for I've felt it myself.\"    To my relief she was brief. She made her statement, leaving me to take  it or reject it as I would.    \"The thought and belief its former occupants--have left behind. For  there has been coincidence here, a coincidence that must be rare. The  site on which this modern house now stands was Roman, before that Early  Britain, with burial mounds, before that again, Druid--the Druid stones  still lie in that copse below the field, the Tumuli among the ilexes  behind the drive. The older building Sam Franklyn altered and  practically pulled down was a monastery; he changed the chapel into a  meeting hall, which is now the music room; but, before he came here, the  house was occupied by Manetti, a violent Catholic without tolerance or  vision; and in the interval between these two, Julius Weinbaum had it,  Hebrew of most rigid orthodox type imaginable--so they all have left  their--\"    \"Even so,\" I repeated, yet interested to hear the rest, \"what of it?\"    \"Simply this,\" said Frances with conviction, \"that each in turn has left  his layer of concentrated thinking and belief behind him; because each  believed intensely, absolutely, beyond the least weakening of any doubt  --the kind of strong belief and thinking that is rare anywhere today, the  kind that wills, impregnates objects, saturates the atmosphere, haunts,  in a word. And each, believing he was utterly and finally right, damned  with equally positive conviction the rest of the world. One and all  preached that implicitly if not explicitly. It's the root of every  creed. Last of the bigoted, grim series came Samuel Franklyn.\"    I listened in amazement that increased as she went on. Up to this point  her explanation was so admirable. It was, indeed, a pretty study in  psychology if it were true.    \"Then why does nothing ever happen?\" I enquired mildly. \"A place so  thickly haunted ought to produce a crop of no ordinary results!\"    \"There lies the proof,\" she went on in a lowered voice, \"the proof of  the horror and the ugly reality. The thought and belief of each occupant  in turn kept all the others under. They gave no sign of life at the  time. But the results of thinking never die. They crop out again the  moment there's an opening. And, with the return of Mabel in her negative  state, believing nothing positive herself the place for the first time  found itself free to reproduce its buried stores.    \"Damnation, hell-fire, and the rest--the most permanent and vital  thought of all those creeds, since it was applied to the majority of the  world--broke loose again, for there was no restraint to hold it back.  Each sought to obtain its former supremacy. None conquered. There  results a pandemonium of hate and fear, of striving to escape, of  agonized, bitter warring to find safety, peace--salvation. The place is  saturated by that appalling stream of thinking--the terror of the  damned. It concentrated upon Mabel, whose negative attitude furnished  the channel of deliverance. You and I, according to our sympathy with  her, were similarly involved. Nothing happened, because no one layer  could ever gain the supremacy.\"    I was so interested--I dare not say amused--that I stared in silence  while she paused a moment, afraid that she would draw rein and end the  fairy tale too soon.    \"The beliefs of this man, of his Society rather, vigorously thought and  therefore vigorously given out here, will put the whole place straight.  It will act as a solvent. These vitriolic layers actively denied, will  fuse and disappear in the stream of gentle, tolerant sympathy which is  love. For each member, worthy of the name, loves the world, and all  creeds go into the melting-pot; Mabel, too, if she joins them out of  real conviction, will find salvation--\"    \"Thinking, I know, is of the first importance,\" I objected, \"but don't  you, perhaps, exaggerate the power of feeling and emotion which in  religion are au fond always hysterical?\"    \"What is the world,\" she told me, \"but thinking and feeling? An  individual's world is entirely what that individual thinks and believes  --interpretation. There is no other. And unless he really thinks and  really believes, he has no permanent world at all. I grant that few  people think, and still fewer believe, and that most take ready-made  suits and make them do. Only the strong make their own things; the  lesser fry, Mabel among them, are merely swept up into what has been  manufactured for them. They get along somehow. You and I have made for  ourselves, Mabel has not. She is a nonentity, and when her belief is  taken from her, she goes with it.\"    It was not in me just then to criticize the evasion, or pick out the  sophistry from the truth. I merely waited for her to continue.    \"None of us have Truth, my dear Frances,\" I ventured presently, seeing  that she kept silent.    \"Precisely,\" she answered, \"but most of us have beliefs. And what one  believes and thinks affects the world at large. Consider the legacy of  hatred and cruelty involved in the doctrines men have built into their  creeds where the sine qua non of salvation is absolute acceptance of one  particular set of views or else perishing everlastingly--for only by  repudiating history can they disavow it--\"    \"You're not quite accurate,\" I put in. \"Not all the creeds teach  damnation, do they? Franklyn did, of course, but the others are a bit  modernized now surely?\"    \"Trying to get out of it,\" she admitted, \"perhaps they are, but  damnation of unbelievers--of most of the world, that is--is their rather  favorite idea if you talk with them.\"    \"I never have.\"    She smiled. \"But I have,\" she said significantly, \"so, if you consider  what the various occupants of this house have so strongly held and  thought and believed, you need not be surprised that the influence they  have left behind them should be a dark and dreadful legacy. For thought,  you know, does leave--\"    The opening of the door, to my great relief, interrupted her, as the  Grenadier led in the visitor to see the room. He bowed to both of us  with a brief word of apology, looked round him, and withdrew, and with  his departure the conversation between us came naturally to an end. I  followed him out. Neither of us in any case, I think, cared to argue  further.    And, so far as I am aware, the curious history of The Towers ends here  too. There was no climax in the story sense. Nothing ever really  happened. We left next morning for London. I only know that the Society  in question took the house and have since occupied it to their entire  satisfaction, and that Mabel, who became a member shortly afterwards,  now stays there frequently when in need of repose from the arduous and  unselfish labors she took upon herself under its aegis. She dined with  us only the other night, here in our tiny Chelsea flat, and a jollier,  saner, more interesting and happy guest I could hardly wish for. She was  vital--in the best sense; the lay figure had come to life. I found it  difficult to believe she was the same woman whose"]]]
