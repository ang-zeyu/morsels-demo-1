There was nothing to do but to give in--and I was  about to accept it weakly, as we too often treat other illusions of  darkness and necessity, for the time being, when I became aware of some  other annoyance that had been forcing itself upon me for the last few  moments. How quiet the driver was!    Was there any driver? Had I any reason to suppose that he was not lying  gagged and bound on the roadside, and the highwayman with blackened face  who did the thing so quietly driving me--whither? The thing is perfectly  feasible. And what is this fancy now being jolted out of me? A story?  It's of no use to keep it back--particularly in this abysmal vehicle,  and here it comes: I am a Marquis--a French Marquis; French, because  the peerage is not so well known, and the country is better adapted to  romantic incident--a Marquis, because the democratic reader delights in  the nobility. My name is something LIGNY. I am coming from Paris to my  country seat at St. Germain. It is a dark night, and I fall asleep  and tell my honest coachman, Andre, not to disturb me, and dream of an  angel. The carriage at last stops at the chateau. It is so dark that  when I alight I do not recognize the face of the footman who holds the  carriage door. But what of that?--PESTE! I am heavy with sleep. The same  obscurity also hides the old familiar indecencies of the statues on the  terrace; but there is a door, and it opens and shuts behind me smartly.  Then I find myself in a trap, in the presence of the brigand who has  quietly gagged poor Andre and conducted the carriage thither. There  is nothing for me to do, as a gallant French Marquis, but to say,  \"PARBLEU!\" draw my rapier, and die valorously! I am found a week or two  after outside a deserted cabaret near the barrier, with a hole through  my ruffled linen and my pockets stripped. No; on second thoughts, I  am rescued--rescued by the angel I have been dreaming of, who is the  assumed daughter of the brigand but the real daughter of an intimate  friend.    Looking from the window again, in the vain hope of distinguishing the  driver, I found my eyes were growing accustomed to the darkness. I  could see the distant horizon, defined by India-inky woods, relieving a  lighter sky. A few stars widely spaced in this picture glimmered sadly.  I noticed again the infinite depth of patient sorrow in their serene  faces; and I hope that the vandal who first applied the flippant  \"twinkle\" to them may not be driven melancholy-mad by their reproachful  eyes. I noticed again the mystic charm of space that imparts a sense  of individual solitude to each integer of the densest constellation,  involving the smallest star with immeasurable loneliness. Something of  this calm and solitude crept over me, and I dozed in my gloomy cavern.  When I awoke the full moon was rising. Seen from my window, it had an  indescribably unreal and theatrical effect. It was the full moon of  NORMA--that remarkable celestial phenomenon which rises so palpably to  a hushed audience and a sublime andante chorus, until the CASTA DIVA is  sung--the \"inconstant moon\" that then and thereafter remains fixed in  the heavens as though it were a part of the solar system inaugurated  by Joshua. Again the white-robed Druids filed past me, again I saw that  improbable mistletoe cut from that impossible oak, and again cold chills  ran down my back with the first strain of the recitative. The thumping  springs essayed to beat time, and the private-box-like obscurity of  the vehicle lent a cheap enchantment to the view. But it was a vast  improvement upon my past experience, and I hugged the fond delusion.    My fears for the driver were dissipated with the rising moon. A familiar  sound had assured me of his presence in the full possession of at least  one of his most important functions. Frequent and full expectoration  convinced me that his lips were as yet not sealed by the gag of  highwaymen, and soothed my anxious ear. With this load lifted from my  mind, and assisted by the mild presence of Diana, who left, as when  she visited Endymion, much of her splendor outside my cavern--I looked  around the empty vehicle. On the forward seat lay a woman's hairpin. I  picked it up with an interest that, however, soon abated. There was no  scent of the roses to cling to it still, not even of hair oil. No  bend or twist in its rigid angles betrayed any trait of its wearer's  character. I tried to think that it might have been \"Mariar's.\" I tried  to imagine that, confining the symmetrical curls of that girl, it might  have heard the soft compliments whispered in her ears which provoked the  wrath of the aged female. But in vain. It was reticent and unswerving in  its upright fidelity, and at last slipped listlessly through my fingers.    I had dozed repeatedly--waked on the threshold of oblivion by  contact with some of the angles of the coach, and feeling that I was  unconsciously assuming, in imitation of a humble insect of my childish  recollection, that spherical shape which could best resist those  impressions, when I perceived that the moon, riding high in the heavens,  had begun to separate the formless masses of the shadowy landscape.  Trees isolated, in clumps and assemblages, changed places before  my window. The sharp outlines of the distant hills came back, as  in daylight, but little softened in the dry, cold, dewless air of a  California summer night. I was wondering how late it was, and thinking  that if the horses of the night traveled as slowly as the team before  us, Faustus might have been spared his agonizing prayer, when a sudden  spasm of activity attacked my driver. A succession of whip-snappings,  like a pack of Chinese crackers, broke from the box before me. The stage  leaped forward, and when I could pick myself from under the seat, a long  white building had in some mysterious way rolled before my window.  It must be Slumgullion! As I descended from the stage I addressed the  driver:    \"I thought you changed horses on the road?\"    \"So we did. Two hours ago.\"    \"That's odd. I didn't notice it.\"    \"Must have been asleep, sir. Hope you had a pleasant nap. Bully place  for a nice quiet snooze--empty stage, sir!\"          THE MAN OF NO ACCOUNT      His name was Fagg--David Fagg. He came to California in '52 with us,  in the SKYSCRAPER. I don't think he did it in an adventurous way. He  probably had no other place to go to. When a knot of us young fellows  would recite what splendid opportunities we resigned to go, and how  sorry our friends were to have us leave, and show daguerreotypes and  locks of hair, and talk of Mary and Susan, the man of no account used to  sit by and listen with a pained, mortified expression on his plain face,  and say nothing. I think he had nothing to say. He had no associates  except when we patronized him; and, in point of fact, he was a good deal  of sport to us. He was always seasick whenever we had a capful of wind.  He never got his sea legs on, either. And I never shall forget how  we all laughed when Rattler took him the piece of pork on a string,  and--But you know that time-honored joke. And then we had such a  splendid lark with him. Miss Fanny Twinkler couldn't bear the sight of  him, and we used to make Fagg think that she had taken a fancy to him,  and send him little delicacies and books from the cabin. You ought  to have witnessed the rich scene that took place when he came up,  stammering and very sick, to thank her! Didn't she flash up grandly and  beautifully and scornfully? So like \"Medora,\" Rattler said--Rattler knew  Byron by heart--and wasn't old Fagg awfully cut up? But he got over it,  and when Rattler fell sick at Valparaiso, old Fagg used to nurse him.  You see he was a good sort of fellow, but he lacked manliness and  spirit.    He had absolutely no idea of poetry. I've seen him sit stolidly by,  mending his old clothes, when Rattler delivered that stirring apostrophe  of Byron's to the ocean. He asked Rattler once, quite seriously, if he  thought Byron was ever seasick. I don't remember Rattler's reply, but I  know we all laughed very much, and I have no doubt it was something good  for Rattler was smart.    When the SKYSCRAPER arrived at San Francisco we had a grand \"feed.\"  We agreed to meet every year and perpetuate the occasion. Of course we  didn't invite Fagg. Fagg was a steerage passenger, and it was necessary,  you see, now we were ashore, to exercise a little discretion. But Old  Fagg, as we called him--he was only about twenty-five years old, by the  way--was the source of immense amusement to us that day. It appeared  that he had conceived the idea that he could walk to Sacramento, and  actually started off afoot. We had a good time, and shook hands with one  another all around, and so parted. Ah me! only eight years ago, and yet  some of those hands then clasped in amity have been clenched at each  other, or have dipped furtively in one another's pockets. I know that  we didn't dine together the next year, because young Barker swore  he wouldn't put his feet under the same mahogany with such a very  contemptible scoundrel as that Mixer; and Nibbles, who borrowed money  at Valparaiso of young Stubbs, who was then a waiter in a restaurant,  didn't like to meet such people.    When I bought a number of shares in the Coyote Tunnel at Mugginsville,  in '54, I thought I'd take a run up there and see it. I stopped at the  Empire Hotel, and after dinner I got a horse and rode round the town and  out to the claim. One of those individuals whom newspaper correspondents  call \"our intelligent informant,\" and to whom in all small communities  the right of answering questions is tacitly yielded, was quietly pointed  out to me. Habit had enabled him to work and talk at the same time, and  he never pretermitted either. He gave me a history of the claim, and  added: \"Y"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13121"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 2 (#18)"],[1,"Isles, where the shoals form a natural harbour,  and at the entrance of the opening near Upper Head, in which is a small  islet of sand and rock, not covered with mangroves nor surrounded with  mud flats. The pines of Port Bowen, Shoal-water Bay, and the  Northumberland Isles, would furnish the necessary spars and lighter  planking; and there is no reason to think that the _eucalyptus_, which  grows all over the country, should not be as fit for timbers, etc., as it  is found to be further southward. No iron ore was seen in the  neighbourhood; but were a colony established and the back ridge of  mountains well examined, this and other metallic productions might be  found. The attraction which the mountains seemed to have upon the needle,  is in favour of this probability; but the iron work might be prepared at  Port Jackson where the ore exists, and in whose vicinity there are plenty  of coals.    Fresh water was scarce at this time, none being any where discovered near  the sea side, except a small rill at the back of Upper Head, little more  than adequate to the supply of the tents; it can however be scarcely  doubted, that fresh water for domestic purposes would be found in most  parts of the country; and there is a season of the year, most probably  the height of summer, when rain falls abundantly, as was demonstrated by  the torrent-worn marks down the sides of the hills.    Not a single native was seen, either on the shores of Thirsty, or Broad  Sounds, during the whole time of our stay.    There are kangaroos in the woods, but not in numbers. The shoals all over  the sound are frequented by flocks of ducks and curlews; and we saw in  the upper part, some pelicans, an individual of a large kind of crane,  and another of a white bird, in form resembling a curlew. Many turtle  were seen in the water about Long Island, and from the bones scattered  around the deserted fire places, this animal seemed to form the principal  subsistence of the natives; but we had not the address to obtain any.  Hump-backed whales frequent the entrance of the sound, and would present  an object of interest to a colony. In fishing, we had little success with  hook and line; and the nature of the shores did not admit of hauling the  seine.    The climate here, being one degree within the tropic, was warm at this  season, which may be considered as the spring and the driest time of the  year. On board the ship, the height of the thermometer did not exceed  76 deg., with the warm winds from the northward, but at the tents it averaged  at noon somewhat above 90 deg.; and the musketoes and sand flies were very  troublesome at all places near the mangroves. We did not see any snakes  or other venemous reptiles or insects.    The _latitude_ of Upper Head, from six meridian observations in the  artificial horizon, is 22 deg. 23' 24\" S.    _Longitude_ from fifty sets of distances of the sun and moon, given in  Table II of the second Appendix to this Volume, 149 deg. 46' 53\" E.    The errors of the time keepers from mean Greenwich time, at noon there  Sept. 26, and their mean rates of going during seven days, of which four  were before and three after they had been let down the second time, were  as under:      Earnshaw's No. 543 slow 2h  3' 37.23\" and losing  9.62\" per day.  Earnshaw's No. 520 slow 3h 29' 15.57\" and losing 21.41\" per day.      These errors and rates were found by lieutenant Flinders, from equal  altitudes taken with a sextant on a stand, and using an artificial  horizon of quicksilver.    The longitudes given by the time keepers on Sept. 12 a.m. at Upper Head,  with the Port-Jackson rates, were these:    No. 543, 149 deg. 54' 27\"  east.  No. 520, 149 deg. 53' 47.5\" east.    The mean is 7' 14\" to the east of the lunars; but on using rates equally  accelerated from those at Port Jackson to the above at Upper Head, and  commencing the acceleration on Aug. 15, at Keppel Bay, where the time  keepers were found to be keeping their former rates, the mean longitude  will be 149 deg. 48' 56.6\", or 2' 3.6\" from the lunar observations; which is  therefore the presumable sum of their irregularities after August 15, or  in 27.7 days.    In fixing the positions of places along the East Coast, I have made use  of the time keepers from Port Jackson to Port Curtis, without any  correction. From Port Curtis to Broad Sound, the coast and islands are  laid down from theodolite bearings taken on shore, combined with the  observed latitudes; and consequently the accuracy in longitude of the  first portion depends upon that of Port Jackson and the time keepers, and  of the last, upon Upper Head and the survey. These two unconnected  longitudes meet at Port Curtis, and the difference between them is there  no more than 5\".    From observations with the theodolite upon the top of Upper Head, the  _variation_ was 8 deg. 37' east; but on moving the instrument ten yards to  the south-west, it was 45' less. At two other stations on the west side  of the sound, it was 8 deg. 15', and 8 deg. 0'; and on board the ship 7 deg. 17' and  7 deg. 46', corrected. On the east side of the sound it differed at six  stations on shore, from 8 deg. to 6 deg.; and on board the ship was 6 deg. 44'  corrected. As general results, therefore, but subject to many small  deviations, the variation may be taken,      On the west side of Broad Sound at 8 deg. 0' E.  On the east side                   7  0  At the head of the sound it was,  at one station 12 deg., at another 10 deg.;  the mean,                         11  0      The differences between the two sides of the sound, both on shore and on  board, are nearly similar to what took place in Shoal-water Bay.    The rise of _tide_ and time of high water have been mentioned; but it may  be proper to say what I conceive to be the cause of the extraordinary  rise in Broad Sound. From Cape Howe, at the southern extremity of the  East Coast, to Port Curtis at the edge of the tropic, the time of high  water falls between seven and nine hours after the moon's passage, and  the rise does not exceed nine feet; but from thence to the northward,  commencing with Keppel Bay, the time becomes later, and the rise  augments, till, at Broad Sound, they reach eleven hours, and between  thirty and thirty-five feet. The principal flood tide upon the coast is  supposed to come from the south-east, and the ebb from the north, or  north-west; but from the particular formation of Keppel and Shoal-water  Bays, and of Broad Sound, whose entrances face the north, or north-west,  this ebb tide sets into them, and accumulates the water for some time,  becoming to them a flood. This will, in some degree, account for the  later time and greater rise of the tide; and is conformable to what  captain Cook says upon the same subject (Hawkesworth, III. 244); but I  think there is still a super-adding cause. At the distance of about  thirty leagues to the N. N. W. from Break-sea Spit, commences a vast mass  of reefs, which lie from twenty to thirty leagues from the coast, and  extend past Broad Sound. These reefs, being mostly dry at low water, will  impede the free access of the tide; and the greater proportion of it will  come in between Break-sea Spit and the reefs, and be late in reaching the  remoter parts; and if we suppose the reefs to terminate to the north, or  north-west of the Sound, or that a large opening in them there exist,  another flood tide will come from the northward, and meet the former; and  the accumulation of water from this meeting, will cause an extraordinary  rise in Broad Sound and the neighbouring bays, in the same manner as the  meeting of the tides in the English and Irish Channels causes a great  rise upon the north coast of France and the west coast of England.    That an opening exists in the reefs will hereafter appear; and captain  Cook's observations prove, that for more than a degree to the north-west  of Broad Sound, the flood came from the northward. I found, when at  anchor off Keppel Bay, and again off Island Head, that the flood there  came from the east or south-east; but when lying three miles out from  Pier Head, there was no set whatever; and I am disposed to think that it  is at the entrance of Broad Sound, where the two floods meet each other.

PERCY ISLES.]    TUESDAY 28 SEPTEMBER 1802    On quitting Broad Sound, we steered for the north-easternmost of the  Northumberland Islands., which I intended to visit in the way to Torres'  Strait. These are no otherwise marked by captain Cook, than as a single  piece of land seen indistinctly, of three leagues in extent; but I had  already descried from Mount Westall and Pier Head a cluster of islands,  forming a distinct portion of this archipelago; and in honour of the  noble house to which Northumberland gives the title of duke, I named them  _Percy Isles_.    (Atlas, Plate XI.)    At noon, the observed latitude on both sides was 21 deg. 51' 20\"; the west  end of the largest North-point Isle bore S. 18 deg. W. three or four leagues,  and the Percy Isles were coming in sight ahead. The weather was hazy; and  the wind at E. S. E. preventing us from fetching No. 2, the largest isle,  we tacked at five o'clock, when it bore S. 31 deg. to 54 deg. E, two or three  leagues; No. 5, the north-westernmost of the cluster, bearing N. 24 deg. W.,  two miles and a half. At dusk the anchor was dropped in"]]]
