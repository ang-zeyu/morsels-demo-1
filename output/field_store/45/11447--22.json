Will the French push through the line? Will a hole be made, or is the  enemy like a badger, who digs himself in rather faster than you can dig  him out? I cannot tell; it would indeed be an astonishing measure of  success for a first attempt, and the enemy may require a great deal more  hammering at many points before he has definitely had enough at any one  point. But these operations have brought the day closer, and turn our  thoughts to the time when we shall be able to move forward, and one  finds the cavalrymen wondering whether perhaps they, too, will get their  chance.          The Germans Concrete Trenches    By F.H. Gailor, American Rhodes Scholar of New College, Oxford    [From The London Daily Mail, March 24, 1915.]      At the kind invitation of General Longchamps, German Military Governor  of the Province of Namur, I spent two days with him going along the  country in and behind the firing line in Northern France from near  Rheims to the small village of Monthois, near Vouziers, on the Aisne.    About five miles out of Monthois we came to the artillery positions of  the Germans. We could see the flashes of the guns long before we reached  the hills where they were placed, but when we came up and dismounted the  position was most cleverly concealed by a higher hill in front and the  heavy woods which served as a screen for the artillery. I noticed many  holes where the French shells had burst, and the valley to the north  looked as if some one had been experimenting with a well digger. One  21-centimeter shell had cut a swath about 100 yards long out of the  woods on the hill where we dismounted. The trees were twisted from their  stumps as if a small cyclone had passed, and one could realize the  damage the shells could do merely by the displaced air.    We went on forward into the valley on foot and stopped about two hundred  yards in front and to the left of where the German guns were firing.  There, although of course we could not see the French position, we could  hear and see their shells as they exploded. They were firing short, one  of the officers told me, because they thought the Germans were on the  forward hill. He could see one of the French aeroplanes directing their  fire, but I could not make it out. We stayed there listening to the  shells and watching the few movements of German batteries that were  taking place. A party of officers hidden by the trees were taking  observations and telephoning the results of the German fire and, no  doubt, of the French fire in the German trenches. There was no  excitement; but for the noise the whole scene reminded me of some kind  of construction work, such as building a railroad.    After about an hour, when nothing had happened, one began to realize  that even such excitement may become monotonous and be taken as a matter  of course. One of the officers told me that the Germans had been there  since the beginning of October and that even the trenches were in the  same position as when they first came.    Certainly the trenches seem permanent enough for spending many Winters.  A number of them have now been built of concrete, especially in that  swampy part near the Aisne where they strike water about three feet  underground. The difficulty is in draining out the water when it rains.    Some of the trenches have two stories, and at the back of many of them  are subterranean rest houses built of concrete and connected with the  trenches by passages. The rooms are about seven feet high and ten feet  square, and above the ground all evidence of the work is concealed by  green boughs and shrubbery so that they may escape the attention of the  enemy's aeroplanes.    With the noise and the fatigue, the men say it is impossible to sleep  naturally, but they become so used to the firing and so weary that they  become oblivious of everything even when shells are falling within a  dozen yards of them. They stay in the trenches five days and then get  five days' rest. In talking to the men one feels the influence on them  of a curious sort of fatalism--they have been lucky so far and will come  through all right. One sees and feels everywhere the spirit of a great  game. The strain of football a thousand times magnified. The joy of  winning and boyish pleasure in getting ahead of the other fellows side  by side with the stronger passions of hatred and anger and the sight of  agony and death.    We talked to some of the little groups of men along the road who were  going back to their five days in the trenches. Of course all large units  are split up so as not to attract attention. They were all the same, all  sure of winning, and all bearded, muddy, and determined. I could not  help thinking of American football players at the end of the first half.  These men seemed all the same. I have no recollection of a single  individual. The \"system\" and its work has made a type not only of  clothes but of face. Their answers to the usual questions were all the  same, and one felt in talking to them that their opinions were  machine-made. Three points stood out--Germany is right and will win;  England is wrong and will knuckle under; we hate England because we are  alike in religion, custom, and opinion, and it is the war of kindred  races. Everywhere one met the arguments and stories of unfairness and  cruelty in fighting that have appeared in the English papers, but with  the names reversed. English soldiers had surrendered and then fired; had  shot from beneath a Red Cross flag or had killed prisoners. The stories  were simple and as hackneyed as most of those current in England.    The concrete rest houses were interesting. Most of them have furniture  made from trees \"to amuse us and pass the time.\" Both officers and men  use the same type of house, though discipline forbids that the same  house be used by both officers and men. The light in these houses is bad  and the ventilation not all that it should be, but they are extremely  careful about sanitation, and everywhere one smells disinfectants and  sees evidence of scrupulous guarding against disease. Oil and candles  are scarce and the \"pocket electric\" that all the men and officers carry  does not last long enough for much reading. There are always telephone  connections, but in most cases visits are impossible save by way of the  underground passages and the trenches.    One officer described the life as entirely normal; another said, in  speaking of a Louis XV. couch which had been borrowed from a near-by  chateau and was the pride of a regiment, \"Oh! we are cave-dwellers, but  we have some of the luxuries of at least the nineteenth century.\"    The Major Commandant at Rethel showed me a letter from a friend  demanding \"some easy chairs and a piano for his trench house,\" and the  Major said, \"I hear they have music up on the Yser, but the French are  too close to us here!\"    All that I saw of the German Red Cross leads me to believe that it is  adequate and efficient. At Rethel we saw a Red Cross train of thirty-two  cars perfectly equipped. The cars are made specially with open  corridors, so that stretchers or rubber-wheeled trucks may be rolled  from one car to another. The berths are in two tiers, much like an  American sleeping car, and each car when full holds twenty-eight men.  There is an operating car fully equipped for the most delicate and  dangerous cases; in fact, when we saw the train at Rethel it had stopped  on its way to Germany for an operation on a man's brain.          The Spirits of Mankind    By Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States           The conviction that great spiritual forces will assert       themselves at the end of the European war to enlighten the       judgment and steady the spirits of mankind was expressed by       President Wilson in an address of welcome delivered at the       Maryland annual conference of the Methodist Protestant Church       at Washington on April 8, 1915. The text of his address       appears below.    These are days of great perplexity, when a great cloud of trouble hangs  and broods over the greater part of the world. It seems as if great,  blind, material forces had been released which had for long been held in  leash and restraint. And yet underneath that you can see the strong  impulses of great ideals.    It would be impossible for men to go through what men are going through  on the battlefields of Europe and struggle through the present dark  night of their terrible struggle if it were not that they saw, or  thought that they saw, the broadening of light where the morning should  come up and believed that they were standing each on his side of the  contest for some eternal principle for right.    Then all about them, all about us, there sits the silent, waiting  tribunal which is going to utter the ultimate judgment upon this  struggle, the great tribunal of the opinion of the world; and I fancy I  see, I hope that I see, I pray that it may be that I do truly see, great  spiritual forces lying waiting for the outcome of this thing to assert  themselves, and are asserting themselves even now to enlighten our  judgment and steady our spirits.    No man is wise enough to pronounce judgment, but we can all hold our  spirits in readiness to accept the truth when it dawns on us and is  revealed to us in the outcome of this titanic struggle.    It is of infinite benefit that in assemblages like this and in every  sort of assemblage we should constantly go back to the sources of our  moral inspiration and question ourselves as to what principle it is that  we are acting on.

Already, prior to the last Order in Council, the shipment of conditional  contraband, especially foodstuffs, to Germany was practically  impossible. In fact, prior to the protest which the American Government  made in London on Dec. 28, 1914, not a single shipment of such goods for  Germany has been effected from the United States.    Also, after the lodging of the protest, and as far as is known to the  German Embassy, only one such shipment has been attempted by an American  skipper. Ship and cargo were immediately seized by the British, and are  still detained at a British port. As a pretext for this unwarranted  action the British Government referred to a decree of the German Federal  Council concerning the wheat trade, although this decree only covered  wheat and flour and no other foodstuffs, although imported foodstuffs  were especially exempt from this decree, and although the German  Government had given all necessary guarantees to the United States  Government, and had even proposed a special organization in order to  secure these foodstuffs for the exclusive consumption of the civilian  population.    The seizure of an American ship under these circumstances was in  contradiction with the recognized principles of international law.  Nevertheless the United States Government has not yet obtained the  release of the ship, nor has it after eight months of war succeeded in  safeguarding the legitimate American trade with Germany. Such a delay,  especially when the supply of foodstuffs is concerned, seems equivalent  to complete failure. It is therefore to be assumed that the United  States Government has accepted England's violations of international  law.    Furthermore has to be considered the attitude of the Government of the  United States concerning the question of the exportation of war  material. The Imperial Embassy hopes to agree with the Government of the  United States in assuming that, with regard to the question of  neutrality, there is not only the formal side to be considered, but also  the spirit in which neutrality is enforced.    Conditions in the present war are different from those in any former  wars. For this reason it is not justified to point at the fact that  perhaps in former wars Germany furnished belligerents with war material,  because in those former cases the question was not whether any war  material was to be furnished to the belligerents but merely which one of  the competing countries would furnish it. In the present war, with the  exception of the United States, all the countries capable of a  noteworthy production of war material are either at war themselves or  completing their armaments, and have accordingly prohibited the  exportation of war material. Therefore the United States of America is  the only country in a position to export war material. This fact ought  to give a new meaning to the idea of neutrality, independent of the  formal law.    Instead of that, and in contradiction with the real spirit of  neutrality, an enormous new industry of war materials of every kind is  being built up in the United States, inasmuch as not only the existing  plants are kept busy and enlarged, but also new ones are continually  founded.    The international agreements for the protection of the right of neutrals  originate in the necessity of protecting the existing industries of the  neutral countries. They were never intended to encourage the creation of  entirely new industries in neutral States, as, for instance, the new war  industry in the United States, which supplies only one party of the  belligerents.    In reality the American industry is supplying only Germany's enemies. A  fact which is in no way modified by the purely theoretical willingness  to furnish Germany as well, if it were possible.    If the American people desire to observe true neutrality, they will find  means to stop the exclusive exportation of arms to one side, or at  least to use this export trade as a means to uphold the legitimate trade  with Germany, especially the trade in foodstuffs. This spirit of  neutrality should appear the more justified to the United States as it  has been maintained toward Mexico.    According to the declaration of a Congressman, made in the House  Committee for Foreign Relations Dec. 30, 1914, President Wilson is  quoted as having said on Feb. 4, 1914, when the embargo on arms for  Mexico was lifted:         \"We should stand for genuine neutrality, considering the       surrounding facts of the case.\" He then held in that case,       because Carranza had no ports, while Huerta had them and was       able to import these materials, that \"it was our duty as a       nation to treat them (Carranza and Huerta) upon an equality if       we wished to observe the true spirit of neutrality as compared       with a mere paper neutrality.\"    This conception of \"the true spirit of neutrality,\" if applied to the  present case, would lead to an embargo on arms.          The American Reply      _The following note, which contains a vigorous rebuke to the German  Ambassador for the freedom of his remarks on the course taken by the  United States toward the belligerent powers, was made public at  Washington on April 21, 1916. It was then reported that the note was  finally drafted by President Wilson himself and written by him on his  own typewriter at the White House, although it is signed by Mr. Bryan as  Secretary of State:_    I have given thoughtful consideration to your Excellency's note of the  4th of April, 1915, inclosing a memorandum of the same date, in which  your Excellency discusses the action of this Government with regard to  trade between the United States and Germany, and the attitude of this  Government with regard to the exportation of arms from the United States  to the nations now at war with Germany.    I must admit that I am somewhat at a loss how to interpret your  Excellency's treatment of these matters. There are many circumstances  connected with these important subjects to which I would have expected  your Excellency to advert but of which you make no mention, and there  are other circumstances to which you do refer which I would have  supposed to be hardly appropriate for discussion between the Government  of the United States and the Government of Germany.    I shall take the liberty, therefore, of regarding your Excellency's  references to the course, pursued by the Government of the United  States, with regard to interferences with trade from this country such  as the Government of Great Britain have attempted, as intended merely to  illustrate more fully the situation to which you desire to call our  attention, and not as an invitation to discuss that course.    Your Excellency's long experience in international affairs will have  suggested to you that these relations of the two Governments with one  another cannot wisely be made a subject of discussion with a third  Government, which cannot be fully informed as to the facts, and which  cannot be fully cognizant of the reasons for the course pursued.    I believe, however, that I am justified in assuming that what you desire  to call forth is a frank statement of the position of this Government in  regard to its obligations as a neutral power.    The general attitude and course of policy of this Government in the  maintenance of its neutrality I am particularly anxious that your  Excellency should see in their true light. I had hoped that this  Government's position in these respects had been made abundantly clear,  but I am, of course, perfectly willing to state it again.    This seems to me the more necessary and desirable because, I regret to  say, the language, which your Excellency employs in your memorandum, is  susceptible of being construed as impugning the good faith of the United  States in the performance of its duties as a neutral.    I take it for granted that no such implication was intended, but it is  so evident that your Excellency is laboring under certain false  impressions that I cannot be too explicit in setting forth the facts as  they are, when fully reviewed and comprehended.    In the first place, this Government has at no time and in no manner  yielded any one of its rights as a neutral to any one of the present  belligerents.    It has acknowledged, as a matter of course, the right of visit and  search and the right to apply the rules of contraband of war to articles  of commerce. It has, indeed, insisted upon the use of visit and search  as an absolutely necessary safeguard against mistaking neutral vessels  for vessels owned by any enemy and against mistaking legal cargoes for  illegal. It has admitted also the right of blockade if actually  exercised and effectively maintained.    These are merely the well-known limitations which war places upon  neutral commerce on the high seas. But nothing beyond these has it  conceded.    I call your Excellency's attention to this, notwithstanding it is  already known to all the world as a consequence of the publication of  our correspondence in regard to these matters with several of the  belligerent nations, because I cannot assume that you have official  cognizance of it.    In the second place, this Government attempted to secure from the German  and British Governments mutual concessions with regard to the measures  those Governments respectively adopted for the interruption of trade on  the high seas. This it did, not of right, but merely as exercising the  privileges of a sincere friend of both parties and as indicating its  impartial good-will.    The attempt was unsuccessful, but I regret that your Excellency did not  deem it worthy of mention in modification of the impressions you  expressed. We had hoped that this act on our part had shown our spirit  in these times of distressing war, as our diplomatic correspondence had  shown our steadfast refusal to acknowledge the right of any"]]]
