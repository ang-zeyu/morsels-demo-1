She  promised to pay the loan that very day and to deduct it gradually from  Barefoot's wages.    Now at last Barefoot was allowed to look at herself. The mistress  herself held the glass before her, and both of their faces glowed and  gleamed with mutual joy.    \"I don't know myself! I don't know myself!\" Barefoot kept repeating,  feeling her face with both hands. \"Good heavens, if my mother could only  see me now! But she will certainly bless you from heaven for being so  good to me, and she will stand by you in the heavy hour--you need fear  nothing.\"    \"But now you must make another kind of face,\" said her mistress, \"not  such a pitiful one. But that will come when you hear the music.\"    \"I fancy I hear it already,\" replied Barefoot. \"Yes, listen, there it  is!\"    And, in truth, a large wagon decorated with green boughs was just  driving through the village. Seated in the wagon were all the musicians;  in the midst of them stood Crappy Zachy blowing his trumpet as if he  were trying to wake the dead.    And now there was no more staying in the village; every one was  hastening to be up and away. Light, Bernese carriages, with one and two  horses, some from the village itself and some from the neighboring  villages, were chasing each other as if they were racing. Rose mounted  to her brother's side on the front seat of their chaise, and Barefoot  climbed up into the basket-seat behind. So long as they were passing  through the village, she kept her eyes looking down--she felt so  ashamed. Only when she passed the house that had been her parents' did  she venture to look up; Black Marianne waved her hand from the window,  the red cock crowed on the wood-pile, and the old tree seemed to nod and  wish her good luck.    Now they drove through the valley where Manz was breaking stones, and  now over the Holderwasen where an old woman was keeping the geese.  Barefoot gave her a friendly nod.    \"Good heavens!\" she thought. \"How does it happen that I sit here so  proudly driving along in festive attire? It is a good hour's ride to  Endringen, and yet it seems as if we had only just started.\"    The word was now given to alight, and Rose was immediately surrounded by  all kinds of friends. Several of them asked:    \"Is that not a sister of your brother's wife?\"    \"No, she's only our maid,\" answered Rose.    Several beggars from Haldenbrunn who were here, looked at Barefoot in  astonishment, evidently not recognizing her; and not until they had  stared at her for a long time did they cry out: \"Why, it's Little  Barefoot!\"    \"She is only our maid.\" That little word \"only\" smote painfully on the  girl's heart. But she recovered herself quickly and smiled; for a voice  within her said:    \"Don't let your pleasure be spoiled by a single word. If you begin  anything new, you are sure to step on thorns at first.\"    Rose took Barefoot aside and said: \"You may go for the present to the  dancing-room, or wherever you like, if you have any acquaintances in the  place. When the music begins I shall want to see you again.\"    And so Barefoot stood forsaken, as it were, and feeling as if she had  stolen the clothes she had on, and did not belong to the company at all,  as if she were an intruder.    \"How comes it that thou goest to such a wedding?\" she asked herself; and  she would have liked to go home again. She decided to take a walk  through the village. She passed by the beautiful house built for Brosi,  where there was plenty of life today, too; for the wife of that high  official was spending the summer here with her sons and daughters.  Barefoot turned back toward the village again, looking neither to the  right nor to the left, and yet wishing that somebody would accost her  that she might have a companion. On the outskirts of the village she  encountered a smart-looking young man riding a white horse. He was  attired in farmer's dress, but of a strange kind, and looked very proud.  He pulled up his horse, rested his right hand with the whip in it on his  hip, and patting the animal's neck with his left, called out:    \"Good morning, pretty mistress! Tired of dancing already?\"    \"I'm tired of idle questions already,\" was the reply.    The horseman rode on. Barefoot sat for a long time behind a hedge, while  many thoughts flitted through her mind. Her cheeks glowed with a flush  caused by anger at herself for having made so sharp a reply to a  harmless question, by bashfulness, and by a strange, inward emotion. And  involuntarily she began to hum the old song:      \"There were two lovers in Allgau    Who loved each other so dear.\"    She had begun the day in expectation of joy, and now she wished that she  were dead. She thought to herself: \"How good it would be to fall asleep  here behind this hedge and never to awake again. You are not to have any  joy in this life, why should you run about so long? The grasshoppers  are chirping in the grass, a warm fragrance is rising from the earth, a  linnet is singing incessantly and seems to dive into himself with his  voice and to bring up finer and finer notes, and yet seems to be unable  to say with his whole heart what he has to say. Up in the air the larks,  too, are singing, every one for himself--no one listens to the others or  joins in with the others--and yet everything is--\"    Never in her life had Amrei fallen asleep in broad daylight, or if ever,  not in the morning. She had now drawn her handkerchief over her eyes,  and the sunbeams were kissing her closed lips, which, even in sleep,  were pressed together defiantly, and the redness of her chin had become  deeper. She had slept about an hour, when she awoke with a start. The  smart-looking young man on the white horse was riding toward her, and  the horse had just lifted up his fore feet to bring them down on her  chest. It was only a dream, and Amrei gazed around her as if she had  fallen from the sky. She saw with astonishment where she was, and looked  at herself in wonder. But the sound of music from the village soon  aroused the spirit of life within her, and with new strength she walked  back and found that everything had become more lively. She noticed that  she felt more rested after the many things that she had experienced that  day. And now let only the dancing begin! She would dance until the next  morning, and never rest, and never get tired!    The fresh glow following the sleep of childhood was on her face, and  everybody looked at her in astonishment. She went to the dancing-room;  the music was playing, but in an empty room--for no dancers had come  yet. Only the girls who had been hired to wait upon the guests were  dancing with one another. Crappy Zachy looked at Barefoot for a  longtime, and then shook his head; evidently he did not know her. Amrei  crept along close to the wall, and so out of the room again. She ran  across Farmer Dominic, whose face was radiant with joy today.    \"Beg pardon,\" said he; \"does the mistress belong to the wedding guests?\"    \"No, I am only a maid. I came with Farmer Rodel's daughter, Rose.\"    \"Good! Then go out to the kitchen and tell the mistress that I sent you,  and that you are to help her. We can't have hands enough in my house  today.\"    \"Because it's you I'll gladly go,\" said Amrei, and she set out at once.  On the way she thought how Dominic himself had once been a servant,  and--\"Yes, such things happen only once in a century. It cost him many a  pang before he came to the farm--and that's a pity.\"    Ameile, Dominic's wife, gave a friendly welcome to the new comer, who  offered her services and at the same time took off her jacket, asking if  she might borrow a large apron with a bib on it. But the farmer's wife  insisted that Amrei should satisfy her own hunger and thirst before she  set about serving others. Amrei consented without much ceremony, and won  Ameile's heart by the first words she spoke; for she said:    \"I will fall to at once, for I must confess that I am hungry, and I  don't want to put you to the trouble of having to urge me.\"    Amrei now remained in the kitchen and handed the dishes to the  waitresses in such a knowing way, and managed and arranged everything so  well, that the mistress said:    \"You two Amreis, you and my brother's daughter, can manage all this, and  I will stay with the guests.\"    Amrei of Siebenhofen, who was nicknamed the \"Butter Countess,\" and who  was known far and wide as proud and stubborn, was very friendly with  Barefoot. Once, indeed, the mistress said to the latter:    \"It's a pity that you are not a boy; I believe that Amrei would marry  you on the spot, and not send you home, as she does all of her suitors.\"    \"I have a brother who's still single--but he's in America,\" replied  Barefoot, laughing.    \"Let him stay there,\" said the Butter Countess; \"it would be better if  we could send all the men folk away and be here by ourselves.\"    Amrei did not leave the kitchen until everything had been put back in  its proper place; and when she took off her apron it was still as white  and unruffled as when she had put it on.    \"You'll be tired and not able to dance,\" said the farmer's wife, when  Amrei, with a present, finally took her leave.    \"Why should I be tired? This was only play; and, believe me, I feel much  better for having done something today. A whole day devoted to pleasure!  I shouldn't know how to spend it, and I've "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259"],[0,"Twenty Years After (#18)"],[1,"ho,  since the death of Cardinal Richelieu, is of all parties or any party;  so that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to  me.\"    \"I have no doubt of it,\" said D'Artagnan.    \"Now, my dear friend, look upon all I tell you as merely the statement  of a monk--of a man who resembles an echo--repeating simply what he  hears. I understand that Mazarin is at this very moment extremely uneasy  as to the state of affairs; that his orders are not respected like those  of our former bugbear, the deceased cardinal, whose portrait as you see  hangs yonder--for whatever may be thought of him, it must be allowed  that Richelieu was great.\"    \"I will not contradict you there,\" said D'Artagnan.    \"My first impressions were favorable to the minister; I said to myself  that a minister is never loved, but that with the genius this one was  said to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make  himself feared, which in my opinion is much more to be desired than to  be loved----\"    D'Artagnan made a sign with his head which indicated that he entirely  approved that doubtful maxim.    \"This, then,\" continued Aramis, \"was my first opinion; but as I am very  ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which I profess  obliges me not to rest on my own judgment, but to ask the opinion of  others, I have inquired--Eh!--my friend----\"    Aramis paused.    \"Well? what?\" asked his friend.    \"Well, I must mortify myself. I must confess that I was mistaken.  Monsieur de Mazarin is not a man of genius, as I thought, he is a man of  no origin--once a servant of Cardinal Bentivoglio, and he got on by  intrigue. He is an upstart, a man of no name, who will only be the tool  of a party in France. He will amass wealth, he will injure the king's  revenue and pay to himself the pensions which Richelieu paid to others.  He is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling, but a sort of  buffoon, a punchinello, a pantaloon. Do you know him? I do not.\"    \"Hem!\" said D'Artagnan, \"there is some truth in what you say.\"    \"Ah! it fills me with pride to find that, thanks to a common sort of  penetration with which I am endowed, I am approved by a man like you,  fresh from the court.\"    \"But you speak of him, not of his party, his resources.\"    \"It is true--the queen is for him.\"    \"Something in his favor.\"    \"But he will never have the king.\"    \"A mere child.\"    \"A child who will be of age in four years. Then he has neither the  parliament nor the people with him--they represent the wealth of the  country; nor the nobles nor the princes, who are the military power of  France.\"    D'Artagnan scratched his ear. He was forced to confess to himself that  this reasoning was not only comprehensive, but just.    \"You see, my poor friend, that I am sometimes bereft of my ordinary  thoughtfulness; perhaps I am wrong in speaking thus to you, who have  evidently a leaning to Mazarin.\"    \"I!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"not in the least.\"    \"You spoke of a mission.\"    \"Did I? I was wrong then, no, I said what you say--there is a crisis at  hand. Well! let's fly the feather before the wind; let us join with that  side to which the wind will carry it and resume our adventurous life. We  were once four valiant knights--four hearts fondly united; let us unite  again, not our hearts, which have never been severed, but our courage  and our fortunes. Here's a good opportunity for getting something better  than a diamond.\"    \"You are right, D'Artagnan; I held a similar project, but as I had not  nor ever shall have your fruitful, vigorous imagination, the idea was  suggested to me. Every one nowadays wants auxiliaries; propositions have  been made to me and I confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made  me speak out.\"    \"Monsieur de Gondy! the cardinal's enemy?\"    \"No; the king's friend,\" said Aramis; \"the king's friend, you  understand. Well, it is a question of serving the king, the gentleman's  duty.\"    \"But the king is with Mazarin.\"    \"He is, but not willingly; in appearance, not heart; and that is exactly  the snare the king's enemies are preparing for the poor child.\"    \"Ah! but this is, indeed, civil war which you propose to me, dear  Aramis.\"    \"War for the king.\"    \"Yet the king will be at the head of the army on Mazarin's side.\"    \"But his heart will be in the army commanded by the Duc de Beaufort.\"    \"Monsieur de Beaufort? He is at Vincennes.\"    \"Did I say Monsieur de Beaufort? Monsieur de Beaufort or another.  Monsieur de Beaufort or Monsieur le Prince.\"    \"But Monsieur le Prince is to set out for the army; he is entirely  devoted to the cardinal.\"    \"Oh oh!\" said Aramis, \"there are questions between them at this very  moment. And besides, if it is not the prince, then Monsieur de  Gondy----\"    \"But Monsieur de Gondy is to be made a cardinal; they are soliciting the  hat for him.\"    \"And are there no cardinals that can fight? Come now, recall the four  cardinals that at the head of armies have equalled Monsieur de Guebriant  and Monsieur de Gassion.\"    \"But a humpbacked general!    \"Under the cuirass the hump will not be seen. Besides, remember that  Alexander was lame and Hannibal had but one eye.\"    \"Do you see any great advantage in adhering to this party?\" asked  D'Artagnan.    \"I foresee in it the aid of powerful princes.\"    \"With the enmity of the government.\"    \"Counteracted by parliament and insurrections.\"    \"That may be done if they can separate the king from his mother.\"    \"That may be done,\" said Aramis.    \"Never!\" cried D'Artagnan. \"You, Aramis, know Anne of Austria better  than I do. Do you think she will ever forget that her son is her  safeguard, her shield, the pledge for her dignity, for her fortune and  her life? Should she forsake Mazarin she must join her son and go over  to the princes' side; but you know better than I do that there are  certain reasons why she can never abandon Mazarin.\"    \"Perhaps you are right,\" said Aramis, thoughtfully; \"therefore I shall  not pledge myself.\"    \"To them or to us, do you mean, Aramis?\"    \"To no one. I am a priest,\" resumed Aramis. \"What have I to do with  politics? I am not obliged to read any breviary. I have a jolly little  circle of witty abbes and pretty women; everything goes on smoothly, so  certainly, dear friend, I shall not meddle in politics.\"    \"Well, listen, my dear Aramis,\" said D'Artagnan; \"your philosophy  convinces me, on my honor. I don't know what devil of an insect stung me  and made me ambitious. I have a post by which I live; at the death of  Monsieur de Treville, who is old, I may be a captain, which is a very  snug berth for a once penniless Gascon. Instead of running after  adventures I shall accept an invitation from Porthos; I shall go and  shoot on his estate. You know he has estates--Porthos?\"    \"I should think so, indeed. Ten leagues of wood, of marsh land and  valleys; he is lord of the hill and the plain and is now carrying on a  suit for his feudal rights against the Bishop of Noyon!\"    \"Good,\" said D'Artagnan to himself. \"That's what I wanted to know.  Porthos is in Picardy.\"    Then aloud:    \"And he has taken his ancient name of Vallon?\"    \"To which he adds that of Bracieux, an estate which has been a barony,  by my troth.\"    \"So that Porthos will be a baron.\"    \"I don't doubt it. The 'Baroness Porthos' will sound particularly  charming.\"    And the two friends began to laugh.    \"So,\" D'Artagnan resumed, \"you will not become a partisan of Mazarin's?\"    \"Nor you of the Prince de Conde?\"    \"No, let us belong to no party, but remain friends; let us be neither  Cardinalists nor Frondists.\"    \"Adieu, then.\" And D'Artagnan poured out a glass of wine.    \"To old times,\" he said.    \"Yes,\" returned Aramis. \"Unhappily, those times are past.\"    \"Nonsense! They will return,\" said D'Artagnan. \"At all events, if you  want me, remember the Rue Tiquetonne, Hotel de la Chevrette.\"    \"And I shall be at the convent of Jesuits; from six in the morning to  eight at night come by the door. From eight in the evening until six in  the morning come in by the window.\"    \"Adieu, dear friend.\"    \"Oh, I can't let you go so! I will go with you.\" And he took his sword  and cloak.    \"He wants to be sure that I go away,\" said D'Artagnan to himself.    Aramis whistled for Bazin, but Bazin was asleep in the ante-chamber, and  Aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake him.    Bazin stretched his arms, rubbed his eyes, and tried to go to sleep  again.    \"Come, come, sleepy head; quick, the ladder!\"    \"But,\" said Bazin, yawning portentously, \"the ladder is still at the  window.\"    \"The other one, the gardener's. Didn't you see that Monsieur d'Artagnan  mounted with difficulty? It will be even more difficult to descend.\"    D'Artagnan was about to assure Aramis that he could descend easily, when  an idea came into his head which silenced him.    Bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder.  Presently a good, solid, wooden ladder was placed against the window.    \"Now then,\" said D'Artagnan, \"this is something like; this is a means of  communication. A woman could go up a ladder like that.\"    Aramis's searching look seemed to seek his friend's thought even at the  bottom of his heart, but D'Artagnan sustained the inquisition with an  air of admirable simplicity. Besides, at that moment he put his foot on  the first step of the ladder and began his descent. In a moment he was  on the ground. Bazin remained at the window.    \"Stay there,\" said Aramis; \"I shall return immediately.\"    The two friends went toward the shed. At their approach Planchet came  out leading the two horses.    \"That is good to see,\" said Aramis. \"There is a servant active and  vigilant, not like that lazy fellow Bazin, who is no longer good for  anything since he became connected with the church. Follow us, Planchet;  we shall continue our conversation to the end of the village.\"    They"]]]
