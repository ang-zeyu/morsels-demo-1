I knew she had been talking to her father.    \"Russ, he hates the Ranger,\" she said. \"That's what I fear. It'll bring  trouble on us. Besides, like everybody here, he's biased. He can't see  anything good in Steele. Yet he says: 'More power to him!' I'm  mystified, and, oh, I'm between two fires!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Steele's next noteworthy achievement was as new to me as it was strange  to Linrock. I heard a good deal about it from my acquaintances, some  little from Steele, and the concluding incident I saw and heard myself.    Andy Vey was a broken-down rustler whose activity had ceased and who  spent his time hanging on at the places frequented by younger and better  men of his kind. As he was a parasite, he was often thrown out of the  dens.    Moreover, it was an open secret that he had been a rustler, and the men  with whom he associated had not yet, to most of Linrock, become known as  such.    One night Vey had been badly beaten in some back room of a saloon and  carried out into a vacant lot and left there. He lay there all that  night and all the next day. Probably he would have died there had not  Steele happened along.    The Ranger gathered up the crippled rustler, took him home, attended to  his wounds, nursed him, and in fact spent days in the little adobe house  with him.    During this time I saw Steele twice, at night out in our rendezvous. He  had little to communicate, but was eager to hear when I had seen Jim  Hoden, Morton, Wright, Sampson, and all I could tell about them, and the  significance of things in town.    Andy Vey recovered, and it was my good fortune to be in the Hope So when  he came in and addressed a crowd of gamesters there.    \"Fellers,\" he said, \"I'm biddin' good-by to them as was once my friends.  I'm leavin' Linrock. An' I'm askin' some of you to take thet good-by an'  a partin' word to them as did me dirt.    \"I ain't a-goin' to say if I'd crossed the trail of this Ranger years  ago thet I'd of turned round an' gone straight. But mebbe I  would--mebbe. There's a hell of a lot a man doesn't know till too late.  I'm old now, ready fer the bone pile, an' it doesn't matter. But I've  got a head on me yet, an' I want to give a hunch to thet gang who done  me. An' that hunch wants to go around an' up to the big guns of Pecos.    \"This Texas Star Ranger was the feller who took me in. I'd of died like  a poisoned coyote but fer him. An' he talked to me. He gave me money to  git out of Pecos. Mebbe everybody'll think he helped me because he  wanted me to squeal. To squeal who's who round these rustler diggin's.  Wal, he never asked me. Mebbe he seen I wasn't a squealer. But I'm  thinkin' he wouldn't ask a feller thet nohow.    \"An' here's my hunch. Steele has spotted the outfit. Thet ain't so much,  mebbe. But I've been with him, an' I'm old figgerin' men. Jest as sure  as God made little apples he's a goin' to put thet outfit through--or  he's a-goin' to kill them!\"          Chapter 6    ENTER JACK BLOME      Strange that the narrating of this incident made Diane Sampson unhappy.    When I told her she exhibited one flash of gladness, such as any woman  might have shown for a noble deed and then she became thoughtful, almost  gloomy, sad. I could not understand her complex emotions. Perhaps she  contrasted Steele with her father; perhaps she wanted to believe in  Steele and dared not; perhaps she had all at once seen the Ranger in his  true light, and to her undoing.    She bade me take Sally for a ride and sought her room. I had my  misgivings when I saw Sally come out in that trim cowgirl suit and look  at me as if to say this day would be my Waterloo.    But she rode hard and long ahead of me before she put any machinations  into effect. The first one found me with a respectful demeanor but an  internal conflict.    \"Russ, tighten my cinch,\" she said when I caught up with her.    Dismounting, I drew the cinch up another hole and fastened it.    \"My boot's unlaced, too,\" she added, slipping a shapely foot out of the  stirrup.    To be sure, it was very much unlaced. I had to take off my gloves to  lace it up, and I did it heroically, with bent head and outward calm,  when all the time I was mad to snatch the girl out of the saddle and  hold her tight or run off with her or do some other fool thing.    \"Russ, I believe Diane's in love with Steele,\" she said soberly, with  the sweet confidence she sometimes manifested in me.    \"Small wonder. It's in the air,\" I replied.    She regarded me doubtfully.    \"It was,\" she retorted demurely.    \"The fickleness of women is no new thing to me. I didn't expect Waters  to last long.\"    \"Certainly not when there are nicer fellows around. One, anyway, when he  cares.\"    A little brown hand slid out of its glove and dropped to my shoulder.    \"Make up. You've been hateful lately. Make up with me.\"    It was not so much what she said as the sweet tone of her voice and the  nearness of her that made a tumult within me. I felt the blood tingle to  my face.    \"Why should I make up with you?\" I queried in self defense. \"You are  only flirting. You won't--you can't ever be anything to me, really.\"    Sally bent over me and I had not the nerve to look up.    \"Never mind things--really,\" she replied. \"The future's far off. Let it  alone. We're together. I--I like you, Russ. And I've got to be--to be  loved. There. I never confessed that to any other man. You've been  hateful when we might have had such fun. The rides in the sun, in the  open with the wind in our faces. The walks at night in the moonlight.  Russ, haven't you missed something?\"    The sweetness and seductiveness of her, the little luring devil of her,  irresistible as they were, were no more irresistible than the  naturalness, the truth of her.    I trembled even before I looked up into her flushed face and arch eyes;  and after that I knew if I could not frighten her out of this daring  mood I would have to yield despite my conviction that she only trifled.  As my manhood, as well as duty to Steele, forced me to be unyielding,  all that was left seemed to be to frighten her.    The instant this was decided a wave of emotion--love, regret,  bitterness, anger--surged over me, making me shake. I felt the skin on  my face tighten and chill. I grasped her with strength that might have  need to hold a plunging, unruly horse. I hurt her. I held her as in a  vise.    And the action, the feel of her, her suddenly uttered cry wrought  against all pretense, hurt me as my brutality hurt her, and then I spoke  what was hard, passionate truth.    \"Girl, you're playing with fire!\" I cried out hoarsely. \"I love  you--love you as I'd want my sister loved. I asked you to marry me. That  was proof, if it was foolish. Even if you were on the square, which  you're not, we couldn't ever be anything to each other. Understand?  There's a reason, besides your being above me. I can't stand it. Stop  playing with me or I'll--I'll...\"    Whatever I meant to say was not spoken, for Sally turned deathly white,  probably from my grasp and my looks as well as my threat.    I let go of her, and stepping back to my horse choked down my emotion.    \"Russ!\" she faltered, and there was womanliness and regret trembling  with the fear in her voice. \"I--I am on the square.\"    That had touched the real heart of the girl.    \"If you are, then play the game square,\" I replied darkly.    \"I will, Russ, I promise. I'll never tease or coax you again. If I do,  then I'll deserve what you--what I get. But, Russ, don't think me a--a  four-flush.\"    All the long ride home we did not exchange another word. The traveling  gait of Sally's horse was a lope, that of mine a trot; and therefore, to  my relief, she was always out in front.    As we neared the ranch, however, Sally slowed down until I caught up  with her; and side by side we rode the remainder of the way. At the  corrals, while I unsaddled, she lingered.    \"Russ, you didn't tell me if you agreed with me about Diane,\" she said  finally.    \"Maybe you're right. I hope she's fallen in love with Steele. Lord knows  I hope so,\" I blurted out.    I bit my tongue. There was no use in trying to be as shrewd with women  as I was with men. I made no reply.    \"Misery loves company. Maybe that's why,\" she added. \"You told me Steele  lost his head over Diane at first sight. Well, we all have company. Good  night, Russ.\"    That night I told Steele about the singular effect the story of his  treatment of Vey had upon Miss Sampson. He could not conceal his  feelings. I read him like an open book.    If she was unhappy because he did something really good, then she was  unhappy because she was realizing she had wronged him.    Steele never asked questions, but the hungry look in his eyes was enough  to make even a truthful fellow exaggerate things.    I told him how Diane was dressed, how her face changed with each  emotion, how her eyes burned and softened and shadowed, how her voice  had been deep and full when she admitted her father hated him, how much  she must have meant when she said she was between two fires. I divined  how he felt and I tried to satisfy in some little measure his craving  for news of her.    When I had exhausted my fund and stretched my imagination I was rewarded  by being told that I was a regular old woman for gossip.    Much taken back by this remarkable statement I could but gape at my  comrade. Irritation had followed shortly upon his curiosity and  pleasure, and then the old sane mind reasserted itself, the old stern  look, a little sad now, replaced the glow, the strange eagerness of  youth on his face.    \"Son, I beg your pardon,\" he said, with his hand on my shoulder. \"We're  Rangers, but we can't help being human. To speak right out, it seems two  sweet and lovable girls have come, unfortunately for us all, across the  dark trail we're on. Let us find what solace we can in the hope"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15586"],[0,"India, Old and New (#18)"],[1,"impetus, was  to be the diffusion of Western education. \"The great object of the  British Government,\" he declared, \"ought to be the promotion of English  literature and science, and all the funds appropriated for the purpose  of education would be best employed in English education alone.\"    India seemed for the next twenty years to respond enthusiastically to  the new call. Not only were the new Government schools as well as the  older missionary schools thronged with Indian students who displayed no  less intelligence than industry in the acquisition of Western learning,  but the rapid assimilation of Western ideas amongst the upper classes,  especially in Bengal, was reflected in the social and religious reform  movements initiated by Western-educated Indians touched with the spirit  of the West. Already in 1829 Lord William Bentinck had been supported by  a considerable body of Indian public opinion in prohibiting the  barbarous custom of _Sati_, _i.e._ the self-immolation of Hindu widows  on the funeral pyre of their husbands. Government, however, rightly felt  that, except in regard to practices of which it could not tolerate the  continuance without surrendering the principles of humanity for which it  stood, it was for the Indians themselves and not for their alien rulers  to take the lead in bringing their religious and social customs and  beliefs into harmony with Western standards. Nor was there any lack of  Indians to give their countrymen that lead--amongst them several  high-caste Brahmans, Ram Mohun Roy first and foremost. They were  resolved to cleanse Hinduism of the superstitious and idolatrous  impurities which, as they believed, were only morbid growths on the pure  kernel of Hindu philosophy. The Brahmo Somaj, the most vital of all  these reform movements, professed even to reconcile Hinduism with  theism, though without importing into the new creed the belief in any  personal God. British administrators watched and fostered the moral and  intellectual progress of India with increasing confidence in the results  of Western education, and none with more conviction than Lord Dalhousie,  a high-minded and dour Scotsman, who was the last Governor-General to  serve out his time under the East India Company. Other aspects of his  policy may have been less wise. The extension of British rule to the  Punjab became inevitable after a Sikh rising compelled him to complete  what his predecessor, Lord Hardinge, had begun, and break once and for  all the aggressive power of the Sikh Confederacy; but the rigorous  application to the native States of the doctrine of lapse or escheat  whenever the ruler died without a recognised heir, and the forcible  annexation of the kingdom of Oudh as a penalty incurred by the sins,  however gross, of the reigning dynasty have been often condemned as  grave errors of judgment. They were not, in any case, errors that can be  ascribed to the lust of mere dominion. Dalhousie was convinced that  Indian progress would always be hampered by the continuance of native  administration under such rulers as the kings of Oudh. If he was bent on  extending the area of British dominion, it was in order to extend the  area within which Britain was to be free to discharge her civilising  mission without let or hindrance, and not least by the furtherance of  education. If he took a legitimate pride in the introduction into India  under his auspices of the two great discoveries of applied science which  were just beginning to revolutionise the Western world, viz. railways  and telegraphs, together with unified postage, it was because he  regarded them as powerful instruments of education. The impulse given by  him to public instruction even in the new provinces recently brought  under British control prepared the way for the great educational  measures of 1854 which marked a tremendous stride forward on the road  upon which Macaulay's Minute had started India just two decades before.  It was to Dalhousie that Sir Charles Wood addressed his memorable  despatch which contained, as the Governor-General frankly acknowledged,  \"a scheme of education for all India far wider and more comprehensive  than the local or Supreme Governments could have ventured to suggest.\"  Its main features were the establishment of a department of Public  Instruction in every province to emphasise the importance attached by  Government to the educational purpose of British rule; the creation of  Universities in each of the three Presidency cities, and of Government  colleges of a higher grade, and training colleges for teachers, and the  bestowal of grants-in-aid on private educational institutions. The  claims of vernacular education were not forgotten, nor the vital  importance of promoting female education, by which \"a far greater  proportional impulse is imported to the educational and moral tone of  the people than by the education of men.\" The despatch mapped out a  really national system of education worthy of the faith which the  British generation of that day had in the establishment of an  intellectual and spiritual communion between India and the West. The  initial steps immediately taken by Dalhousie to carry the provisions of  that despatch into execution are enumerated in the masterly Report drawn  up by him on his way home in 1856, reviewing every aspect of his  administration during his eight years' tenure of office--an  administration which virtually closed, and not unworthily, perhaps the  noblest period of British rule in India, when men of the intellectual  and moral elevation of Bentinck and Munro and Metcalfe and Elphinstone  and Thomason, and Dalhousie himself, humbly but firmly believed that in  trying to found \"British greatness on Indian happiness\" they were  carrying out the mission which it had pleased Providence to entrust to  the British people. Dalhousie's parting hope and prayer, when he left  India, broken in health but not in spirit, after eight years of  intensely strenuous service, was that \"in all time to come these reports  from the Presidencies and provinces under our rule may form in each  successive year a happy record of peace, prosperity, and progress.\" His  immediate successor, Lord Canning, was moved to utter some strangely  prophetic words before he left England: \"I wish for a peaceful term of  office. But I cannot forget that in the sky of India, serene as it is, a  small cloud may arise, no larger than a man's hand, but which, growing  larger and larger, may at last threaten to burst and overwhelm us with  ruin.\" Within less than a year the cloud arose and burst, and he had to  face the outbreak of the Mutiny and see all the foundations of  co-operation between Indians and British rudely shaken, which a broad  and liberal policy of \"peace, prosperity, and progress\" seemed to have  so well and truly laid.          CHAPTER V    THE MUTINY AND FIFTY YEARS AFTER      Many different causes, much more clearly apprehended to-day than at the  time, contributed to provoke the great storm which burst over India in  1857. On the surface it was a military and mainly Mahomedan  insurrection, but it was far more than that. It was a violent upheaval  not so much against the political supremacy of Britain as against the  whole new order of things which she was importing into India. The  greased cartridges would not have sufficed to provoke such an explosion,  nor would even Mahomedans, let alone Hindus, have rallied round a  phantom King of Delhi in mere revenge for the annexation of Oudh or the  enforcement of the doctrine of lapse. The cry of \"Islam in danger\" was  quick to stir the Mahomedans, but the brains that engineered and  directed the Mutiny were Hindu, and the Mutiny itself was the  counter-revolution arraying in battle against the intellectual and moral  as well as against the material and military forces of Western  civilisation that was slowly but steadily revolutionising India, all the  grievances and all the fears, all the racial and religious antagonism  and bitterness aroused by the disintegration under its impact of ancient  social and religious systems. Western education was to yield other  fruits later on, but before the Mutiny it was rapidly familiarising the  mind of India with Western ideals which imperilled not only the worship  of the old gods but also the worship of the Brahman as their mouthpiece  and \"the guardian of the treasury of civil and religious duties.\"  Modern schools and colleges threatened to undermine his ascendancy just  as Western competition had by more dubious methods undermined Indian  domestic industries. No man's caste was said to be safe against the  hidden defilement of all the strange inventions imported from beyond the  seas. Prophecy, vague but persuasive, hinted that British rule, which  dated in the Indian mind from the battle of Plassey in 1757, was doomed  not to outlive its centenary. All the vested interests connected with  the old order of things in the religious as well as in the political  domain felt the ground swaying under their feet, and the peril with  which they were confronted came not only from their alien rulers but  from their own countrymen, often of their own caste and race, who had  fallen into the snares and pitfalls of an alien civilisation. The spirit  of fierce reaction that lay behind the Mutiny stands nowhere more  frankly revealed than in the _History of the War of Independence of  1857_, written by Vinayak Savarkar, one of the most brilliant apostles  of a later school of revolt, who, as a pious Hindu, concludes his  version of the Cawnpore massacre with the prayer that \"Mother Ganges,  who drank that day of the blood of Europeans, may drink her fill of it  again.\"    The revolt failed except in one respect. It failed as a military  movement. It had appealed to the sword and it perished by the sword. But  it is well to remember that the struggle, which was severe, would have  been, to say"]]]
