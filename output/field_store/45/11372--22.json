Ramin and Bonelle still live on. For a  house which would have been dear at fifty thousand francs, the draper  has already handed over seventy thousand.    The once red-faced, jovial Ramin is now a pale haggard man, of sour  temper and aspect. To add to his anguish he sees the old man thrive on  that money which it breaks his heart to give. Old Marguerite takes a  malicious pleasure in giving him an exact account of their good cheer,  and in asking him if he does not think Monsieur looks better and  better every day. Of one part of this torment Ramin might get rid, by  giving his old master notice to quit, and no longer having him in his  house. But this he cannot do; he has a secret fear that Bonelle would  take some Excellent Opportunity of dying without his knowledge, and  giving some other person an Excellent Opportunity of persecuting him,  and receiving the money in his stead.    The last accounts of the victim of Excellent Opportunities represent  him as being gradually worn down with disappointment. There seems  every probability of his being the first to leave the world; for  Bonelle is heartier than ever.           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM HOUSEHOLD WORDS.]    THE OLD CHURCHWARD TREE.    A PROSE POEM.    There is an old yew tree which stands by the wall in a dark quiet  corner of the churchyard.    And a child was at play beneath its wide-spreading branches, one fine  day in the early spring. He had his lap full of flowers, which the  fields and lanes had supplied him with, and he was humming a tune to  himself as he wove them into garlands.    And a little girl at play among the tombstones crept near to listen;  but the boy was so intent upon his garland, that he did not hear the  gentle footsteps, as they trod softly over the fresh green grass. When  his work was finished, and all the flowers that were in his lap were  woven together in one long wreath, he started up to measure its length  upon the ground, and then he saw the little girl, as she stood with  her eyes fixed upon him. He did not move or speak, but thought to  himself that she looked very beautiful as she stood there with her  flaxen ringlets hanging down upon her neck. The little girl was so  startled by his sudden movement, that she let fall all the flowers she  had collected in her apron, and ran away as fast as she could. But the  boy was older and taller than she, and soon caught her, and coaxed her  to come back and play with him, and help him to make more garlands;  and from that time they saw each other nearly every day, and became  great friends.    Twenty years passed away. Again, he was seated beneath the old yew  tree in the churchyard.    It was summer now; bright, beautiful summer, with the birds singing,  and the flowers covering the ground, and scenting the air with their  perfume.    But he was not alone now, nor did the little girl steal near on  tiptoe, fearful of being heard. She was seated by his side, and his  arm was round her, and she looked up into his face, and smiled as she  whispered: \"The first evening of our lives we were ever together was  passed here; we will spend the first evening of our wedded life in the  same quiet, happy place.\" And he drew her closer to him as she spoke.    The summer is gone; and the autumn; and twenty more summers and  autumns have passed away since that evening, in the old churchyard.    A young man, on a bright moonlight night, comes reeling through the  little white gate, and stumbling over the graves. He shouts and he  sings, and is presently followed by others like unto himself, or  worse. So, they all laugh at the dark solemn head of the yew tree, and  throw stones up at the place where the moon had silvered the boughs.    Those same boughs are again silvered by the moon, and they droop  over his mother's grave. There is a little stone which bears this  inscription:--    \"HER HEART BRAKE IN SILENCE.\"    But the silence of the churchyard is now broken by a voice--not of the  youth--nor a voice of laughter and ribaldry.    \"My son!--dost thou see this grave? and dost thou read the record in  anguish, whereof may come repentance?\"    \"Of what should I repent?\" answers the son; \"and why should my young  ambition for fame relax in its strength because my mother was old and  weak?\"    \"Is this indeed our son?\" says the father, bending in agony over the  grave of his beloved.    \"I can well believe I am not;\" exclaimeth the youth. \"It is well  that you have brought me here to say so. Our natures are unlike; our  courses must be opposite. Your way lieth here--mine yonder!\"    So the son left the father kneeling by the grave.    Again a few years are passed. It is winter, with a roaring wind and a  thick gray fog. The graves in the Church-yard are covered with snow,  and there are great icicles in the Church-yard. The wind now carries  a swathe of snow along the tops of the graves as though the \"sheeted  dead\" were at some melancholy play; and hark! the icicles fall with  a crash and jingle, like a solemn mockery of the echo of the unseemly  mirth of one who is now coming to his final rest.    There are two graves near the old yew tree; and the grass has  overgrown them. A third is close by; and the dark earth at each side  has just been thrown up. The bearers come; with a heavy pace they  move along; the coffin heaveth up and down, as they step over the  intervening graves.    Grief and old age had seized upon the father, and worn out his life;  and premature decay soon seized upon the son, and gnawed away his vain  ambition, and his useless strength, till he prayed to be borne, not  the way yonder that was most opposite to his father and his mother,  but even the same way they had gone--the way which leads to the Old  Churchyard Tree.           *       *       *       *       *    In dreamy hours the dormant imagination looks out and sees vague  significances in things which it feels can at an after time be vividly  conceived and expressed; the most familiar objects have a strange  double meaning in their aspects; the very chair seems to be  patiently awaiting there the expounder of its silent, symbolical  language.--_Boston Morning Post_.           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM BENTLEY'S MISCELLANY.]    GREECE AND TURKEY.[2]    Whatever Mr. AUBREY DE VERE sees, he picturesquely describes; and  so far as words can do so, he makes pictures of all the subjects he  writes upon; and had he painted as he has written, or used his pencil  equally well with his pen, two more delightful volumes, to any lover  of Greece, it would be difficult to name. With an evidently refined  taste, and a perfect acquaintance with the ancient history of the  country he traveled through, and the ever famous characters that  made its history what it is, his descriptions combine most pleasingly  together, the past with the present. He peoples the scenery with the  men whose deeds give to that scenery all its interest; and whether on  the plain of Marathon, or the site of Delphi or the Acropolis, he has  a store of things to say of their past glories, and links together,  with great artistic skill, that which is gone with that which remains.    [Footnote 2: Picturesque Sketches of Greece and Turkey. By Aubrey De  Vere, 2 vols. [Philadelphia: A. Hart.]]    By the scholar and the man of taste the volumes will be read with no  little delight, as they abound much more with reflections and sensible  observations, than with the commonplace incidents of travel. Indeed,  the author has left but small space for his accidents at sea and his  hardships on shore, since all the chapters but four are devoted to  Athens, Delphi, and Constantinople. The classical reader will prefer  the chapters on the two first-named places; the general reader will  find perhaps more interesting his sketches of the city of the Sultan,  and an anecdote which he gives of the present Sultan, and which  declares him to possess more of decision, and firmness of character,  and good sense, than the world gives him credit for. His description  of the Bosphorus will create in many a desire to see what he has seen,  and to look upon some, at least, of the fifty-seven palaces which the  sultans have raised upon its banks; and upon the hundreds of others,  which, while the Commander of the Faithful permits it, are the  property of his subjects.    It argued far more of a wild spirit of adventure than of a sober  understanding in Aubrey de Vere, to go with that clever Frenchman to  the Turk's house, and to play off all those tricks in the presence of  its master and his ten unvailed wives. Rarely indeed, if ever before,  has an Englishman passed an hour so comfortably with the whole of  a rich man's harem, and seen them as de Vere saw them in all their  artlessness and beauty. We live, indeed, in strange times, when the  once scorned and loathed Giaours contrive to possess themselves  of such extraordinary privileges, and to escape unharmed from such  hitherto unheard-of enjoyments.    Where one thought was given to Constantinople a hundred years since  from the west of the Dalmatian coast, ten thousand eyes are now  constantly directed to it, and with continually increasing anxiety.  The importance of that city is now understood by all the European  powers, and its future fate has become a subject of deep interest to  all the western states, in consequence of the determined set made upon  it by its powerful northern neighbor. With the Cossacks at Istamboul  instead of Turks, we should be very ill satisfied, and the whole charm  of this city on its seven hills would have departed: already is it on  the wane. Sultan Mahmoud's hostility to beards and to flowing robes,  to the turban and the jherid, has deprived his capital city of much  of its picturesqueness and peculiarity; but still enough remains of  eastern manners and costumes to make it one of the most interesting  cities in the world "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13797"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#18)"],[1,"of the estates was a mere excuse.\"    \"I beg your pardon,\" observed the captain, in a decided tone of voice;  \"I have already told you that it was I who informed him of the place  where his friend lies buried.\"    \"That may be, but it was owing to his friendship, to the wish to learn  something further of his fate, that we are indebted for the visit of  this romantic knight-errant.\"    \"That does not appear likely,\" replied the captain, who thought it  better to avert, if possible, the rising storm of his companion's  fury. \"Why should he seek for news of Hallberg here, when he comes  from the place where he was quartered for a long time, and where all  his comrades now are.\"    \"Well, I don't know,\" cried D'Effernay, whose passion was increasing  every moment. \"Perhaps you have heard what was once gossiped about  the neighborhood, that Hallberg was an admirer of my wife before she  married.\"    \"Oh yes, I have heard that report, but never believed it. Hallberg was  a prudent, steady man, and every one knew that Mademoiselle Varnier's  hand had been promised for some time.\"    \"Yes! yes! but you do not know to what lengths passion and avarice may  lead: for Emily was rich. We must not forget that, when we discuss  the matter; an elopement with the rich heiress would have been a fine  thing for a poor, beggarly lieutenant.\"    \"Shame! shame! M. D'Effernay. How can you slander the character  of that upright young man? If Hallberg were so unhappy as to love  Mademoiselle Varnier--\"    \"That he did! you may believe me so far, I had reason to know it, and  I did know it.\"    \"We had better change the conversation altogether, as it has taken  so unpleasant a turn, Hallberg is dead; his errors, be they what they  may, lie buried with him. His name stands high with all who knew him  Even you, M. D'Effernay--you were his friend.\"    \"I his friend? I hated him!--I loathed him!\" D'Effernay could not  proceed; he foamed at the mouth with rage.    \"Compose yourself!\" said the Captain, rising as he spoke; \"you look  and speak like a madman.\"    A madman! Who says I am mad? Now I see it all--the connection of the  whole--the shameful conspiracy.\"    \"Your conduct is perfectly incomprehensible to me,\" answered the  captain, with perfect coolness. \"Did you not attend Hallberg in his  last illness, and give him his medicines with your own hand?\"    \"I!\" stammered D'Effernay. \"No! no! no!\" he cried, while the  captain's growing suspicions increased every moment, on account of  the perturbation which his companion displayed. \"I never gave his  medicines; whoever says that is a liar.\"    \"I say it!\" exclaimed the officer, in a loud tone, for his patience  was exhausted. \"I say it, because I know that it was so, and I will  maintain that fact against any one at any time. If you choose to  contradict the evidence of my senses, it is you who are a liar!\"    \"Ha! you shall give me satisfaction for this insult. Depend upon it,  I am not one to be trifled with, as you shall find. You shall retract  your words.\"    \"Never! I am ready to defend every word I have uttered here on this  spot, at this moment, if you please. You have your pistols in the  carriage, you know.\"    D'Effernay cast a look of hatred on the speaker, and then dashing  down the little hill, to the surprise of the servants, he dragged  the pistols from the sword-case, and was by the captain's side in a  moment. But the loud voices of the disputants had attracted Edward to  the spot, and there he stood on D'Effernay's return; and by his side a  venerable old man, who carried a large bunch of keys in his hand.    \"In heaven's name, what has happened?\" cried Wensleben.    \"What are you about to do?\" interposed the rector, in a tone of  authority, though his countenance was expressive of horror. \"Are you  going to commit murder on this sacred spot, close to the precincts of  the church?\"    \"Murder! who speaks of murder?\" cried D'Effernay. \"Who can prove it?\"  and as he spoke, the captain turned a fierce, penetrating look upon  him, beneath which he quailed.    \"But, I repeat the question,\" Edward began once more, \"what does all  this mean? I left you a short time ago in friendly conversation. I  come back and find you both armed--both violently agitated--and M.  D'Effernay, at least, speaking incoherently. What do you mean by  'proving it?'--to what do you allude?\" At this moment, before any  answer could be made, a man came out of the house with a pick-axe  and shovel on his shoulder, and advancing toward the rector, said  respectfully, \"I am quite ready, sir, if you have the key of the  churchyard.\"    It was now the captain's turn to look anxious: \"What are you going  to do, you surely don't intend--?\" but as he spoke, the rector  interrupted him.    \"This gentleman is very desirous to see the place where his friend  lies buried.\"    \"But these preparations, what do they mean?\"    \"I will tell you,\" said Edward, in a voice and tone that betrayed  the deepest emotion, \"I have a holy duty to perform. I must cause the  coffin to be opened.\"    \"How, what!\" screamed D'Effernay, once again. \"Never--I will never  permit such a thing.\"    \"But, sir,\" the old man spoke, in a tone of calm decision, contrasting  wonderfully with the violence of him whom he addressed, \"you have no  possible right to interfere. If this gentleman wishes it, and I accede  to the proposition, no one can prevent us from doing as we would.\"    \"I tell you I will not suffer it,\" continued D'Effernay, with the same  frightful agitation. \"Stir at your peril,\" he cried, turning sharply  round upon the grave-digger, and holding a pistol to his head; but the  captain pulled his arm away, to the relief of the frightened peasant.    \"M. D'Effernay,\" he said, \"your conduct for the last half-hour has  been most unaccountable--most unreasonable.\"    \"Come, come,\" interposed Edward, \"Let us say no more on the subject;  but let us be going,\" he addressed the rector; \"we will not detain  these gentlemen much longer.\"    He made a step toward the churchyard, but D'Effernay clutched his arm,  and, with an impious oath, \"you shall not stir,\" he said; \"that grave  shall not be opened.\"    Edward shook him off, with a look of silent hatred, for now indeed all  his doubts were confirmed.    D'Effernay saw that Wensleben was resolved, and a deadly pallor spread  itself over his features, and a shudder passed visibly over his frame.    \"You are going!\" he cried, with every gesture and appearance of  insanity. \"Go, then;\" ... and he pointed the muzzle of the pistol to  his mouth, and before any one could prevent him, he drew the trigger,  and fell back a corpse. The spectators were motionless with surprise  and horror; the captain was the first to recover himself in some  degree. He bent over the body with the faint hope of detecting some  sign of life. The old man turned pale and dizzy with a sense of  terror, and he looked as if he would have swooned, had not Edward led  him gently into his house, while the two others busied themselves with  vain attempts to restore life.    The spirit of D'Effernay had gone to its last account!    It was, indeed, an awful moment. Death in its worst shape was before  them, and a terrible duty still remained to be performed.    Edward's cheek was blanched; his eye had a fixed look, yet he moved  and spoke with a species of mechanical action, which had something  almost ghastly in it. Causing the body to be removed into the house,  he bade the captain summon the servants of the deceased, and then  motioning with his hand to the awe-struck sexton, he proceeded with  him to the churchyard. A few clods of earth alone were removed ere the  captain stood by his friend's side.    Here we must pause. Perhaps it were better altogether to emulate the  silence that was maintained then and afterward by the two comrades.  But the sexton could not be bribed to entire secrecy, and it was a  story he loved to tell, with details we gladly omit, of how Wensleben  solemnly performed his task--of how no doubt could any longer exist  as to the cause of Hallberg's death. Those who love the horrible must  draw on their own imaginations to supply what we resolutely withhold.    Edward, we believe, never alluded to D'Effernay's death, and all the  awful circumstances attending it, but twice--once, when, with every  necessary detail, he and the captain gave their evidence to the legal  authorities; and once, with as few details as possible, when he had an  interview with the widow of the murderer, the beloved of the victim.  The particulars of this interview he never divulged, for he considered  Emily's grief too sacred to be exposed to the prying eyes of the  curious and the unfeeling. She left the neighborhood immediately,  leaving her worldly affairs in Wensleben's hands, who soon disposed  of the property for her. She returned to her native country, with the  resolution of spending the greater part of her wealth in relieving  the distresses of others, wisely seeking, in the exercise of piety  and benevolence, the only possible alleviation of her own deep  and many-sided griefs. For Edward, he was soon pronounced to have  recovered entirely from the shock of these terrible events. Of a  courageous and energetic disposition, he pursued the duties of his  profession with a firm step, and hid his mighty sorrow deep in the  recesses of his heart. To the superficial observer, tears, groans, and  lamentations are the only proofs of sorrow: and when they subside,  the sorrow is said to have passed away also. Thus the captive, immured  within the walls of his prison-house, is as one dead to the outward  world, though the gaoler be a daily witness to the vitality of  affliction.           *       *       *       *       *    Paris has been again emptied of its citizens to see M.
