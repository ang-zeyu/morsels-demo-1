Virtue hath her heroes too,  As well as fame and fortune.--To Vienna  Hence--to the Emperor--kneel before the throne  Take a full coffer with thee--say aloud,  Thou didst but wish to prove thy fealty;  Thy whole intention but to dupe the Swede.    ILLO.    For that too 'tis too late. They know too much;  He would but bear his own head to the block.    COUNTESS.    I fear not that. They have not evidence  To attaint him legally, and they avoid  The avowal of an arbitrary power.  They'll let the Duke resign without disturbance.  I see how all will end. The King of Hungary  Makes his appearance, and 'twill of itself  Be understood that then the Duke retires.  There will not want a formal declaration;  The young King will administer the oath  To the whole army; and so all returns  To the old position. On some morrow morning  The Duke departs; and now 'tis stir and bustle  Within his castles. He will hunt, and build,  And superintend his horses' pedigrees;  Creates himself a court, gives golden keys,  And introduces strictest ceremony  In fine proportions, and nice etiquette;  Keeps open table with high cheer: in brief,  Commences mighty King--in miniature.  And while he prudently demeans himself,  And gives himself no actual importance,  He will be let appear whate'er he likes;  And who dares doubt that Friedland will appear  A mighty Prince to his last dying hour?  Well now, what then? Duke Friedland is as others,  A fire-new Noble, whom the war hath raised  To price and currency, a Jonah's gourd,  An over-night creation of court-favor,  Which with an undistinguishable ease  Makes Baron or makes Prince.

Canst thou  Consent to bear thyself to thy own grave,  So ignominiously to be dried up?  Thy life, that arrogated such an height  To end in such a nothing! To be nothing,  When one was always nothing, is an evil  That asks no stretch of patience, a light evil;  But to become a nothing, having been--    WALLENSTEIN (_starts up in violent agitation_).    Show me a way out of this stifling crowd,  Ye powers of Aidance! Show me such a way  As _I_ am capable of going. I  Am no tongue-hero, no fine virtue-prattler;  I cannot warm by thinking; cannot say  To the good luck that turns her back upon me,  Magnanimously: \"Go; I need thee not.\"  Cease I to work, I am annihilated.  Dangers nor sacrifices will I shun,  If so I may avoid the last extreme;  But ere I sink down into nothingness,  Leave off so little, who began so great,  Ere that the world confuses me with those  Poor wretches whom a day creates and crumbles,  This age and after ages[25] speak my name  With hate and dread; and Friedland be redemption  For each accursed deed.    COUNTESS.                        What is there here, then,  So against nature? Help me to perceive it!  O let not Superstition's nightly goblins  Subdue thy clear bright spirit! Art thou bid  To murder?--with abhorr'd, accursed poinard,  To violate the breasts that nourish'd thee?  That _were_ against our nature, that might aptly  Make thy flesh shudder, and thy whole heart sicken,[26]  Yet not a few, and for a meaner object,  Have ventured even this, ay, and perform'd it.  What is there in thy case so black and monstrous?  Thou art accused of treason--whether with  Or without justice is not now the question--  Thou art lost if thou dost not avail thee quickly  Of the power which thou possessest--Friedland! _Duke!_  Tell me where lives that thing so meek and tame,  That doth not all his living faculties  Put forth in preservation of his life?  What deed so daring, which necessity  And desperation will not sanctify?    WALLENST.    Once was this Ferdinand so gracious to me;  He loved me; he esteem'd me; I was placed  The nearest to his heart. Full many a time  We like familiar friends, both at one table,  Have banqueted together. He and I--  And the young kings themselves held me the basin  Wherewith to wash me--and is't come to this?    COUNTESS.    So faithfully preserves thou each small favor,  And hast no memory for contumelies?  Must I remind thee, how at Regensburg  This man repaid thy faithful services?  All ranks and all conditions in the empire  Thou hadst wronged, to make him great,--hadst loaded on thee,  On _thee_, the hate, the curse of the whole world.  No friend existed for thee in all Germany,  And why? because thou hadst existed only  For the Emperor. To the Emperor alone  Clung Friedland in that storm which gather'd round him  At Regensburg in the Diet--and he dropp'd thee!  He let thee fall! he let thee fall a victim  To the Bavarian, to that insolent!  Deposed, stript bare of all thy dignity  And power, amid the taunting of thy foes,  Thou wert let drop into obscurity.--  Say not the restoration of thy honor  Has made atonement for that first injustice.  No honest good-will was it that replaced thee;  The law of hard necessity replaced thee,  Which they had fain opposed, but that they could not.    WALLENST.    Not to their good wishes, that is certain,  Nor yet to his affection I'm indebted  For this high office: and if I abuse it,  I shall therein abuse no confidence.    COUNTESS.    Affection! confidence!--they _needed_ thee.  Necessity, impetuous remonstrant!  Who not with empty names, or shows of proxy,  Is served, who'll have the thing and not the symbol,  Ever seeks out the greatest and the best,  And at the rudder places _him_, e'en though  She had been forced to take him from the rabble--  She, this Necessity, it was that placed thee  In this high office; it was she that gave thee  Thy letters patent of inauguration.  For, to the uttermost moment that they can,  This race still help themselves at cheapest rate  With slavish souls, with puppets! At the approach  Of extreme peril, when a hollow image  Is found a hollow image and no more,  Then falls the power into the mighty hands  Of Nature, of the spirit giant-born,  Who listens only to himself, knows nothing  Of stipulations, duties, reverences,  And, like the emancipated force of fire,  Unmaster'd scorches, ere it reaches them,  Their fine-spun webs, their artificial policy.    WALLENST.    'Tis true! they saw me always as I am--  Always! I did not cheat them in the bargain.  I never held it worth my pains to hide  The bold all-grasping habit of my soul.    COUNTESS.    Nay rather--thou hast ever shown thyself  A formidable man, without restraint;  Hast exercised the full prerogatives  Of thy impetuous nature, which had been  Once granted to thee. Therefore, Duke, not _thou_  Who hast still remained consistent with thyself;  But _they_ are in the wrong, who fearing thee,  Intrusted such a power in hand they fear'd.  For, by the laws of Spirit, in the right  Is every individual character  That acts in strict consistence with itself.  Self-contradiction is the only wrong.  Wert thou another being, then, when thou  Eight years ago pursuedst thy march with fire,  And sword, and desolation, through the Circles  Of Germany, the universal scourge,  Didst mock all ordinances of the empire,  The fearful rights of strength alone exertedst,  Trampledst to earth each rank, each magistracy,  All to extend thy Sultan's domination?  Then was the time to break thee in, to curb  Thy haughty will, to teach thee ordinance.  But no, the Emperor felt no touch of conscience;  What served him pleased him, and without a murmur  He stamp'd his broad seal on these lawless deeds.  What at that time was right, because thou didst it  _For him_, today is all at once become  Opprobrious, foul, because it is directed  _Against him_.--O most flimsy superstition!    WALLENSTEIN (_rising_).    I never saw it in this light before;  'Tis even so. The Emperor perpetrated  Deeds through my arm, deeds most unorderly.  And even this prince's mantle, which I wear,  I owe to what were services to him,  But most high misdemeanors 'gainst the empire.    COUNTESS.    Then betwixt thee and him (confess it Friedland!)  The point can be no more of right and duty,  Only of power and the opportunity.  That opportunity, lo! it comes yonder  Approaching with swift steeds; then with a swing  Throw thyself up into the chariot-seat,  Seize with firm hand the reins, ere thy opponent  Anticipate thee, and himself make conquest  Of the now empty seat. The moment comes;  It is already here, when thou must write  The absolute total of thy life's vast sum.  The constellations stand victorious o'er thee,  The planets shoot good fortune in fair junctions,  And tell thee, \"Now's the time!\" The starry courses  Hast thou thy life long measured to no purpose?  The quadrant and the circle, were they play-things?    [_Pointing to the different objects in the room_.]    The zodiacs, the rolling orbs of heaven,  Hast pictured on these walls, and all around thee  In dumb, foreboding symbols hast thou placed  These seven presiding Lords of Destiny--  For toys? Is all this preparation nothing?  Is there no marrow in this hollow art,  That even to thyself it doth avail  Nothing, and has no influence over thee  In the great moment of decision?--    WALLENSTEIN. (_during this last speech walks up and down with  inward struggles, laboring with passion; stops suddenly,  stands still, then interrupting the_ COUNTESS).    Send Wrangel to me--I will instantly  Dispatch three couriers--    ILLO (_hurrying out_).                   God in heaven be praised!    WALLENST.    It is _his_ evil genius and _mine_.  Our evil genius! It chastises _him_  Through me, the instrument of his ambition;  And I expect no less than that Revenge  E'en now is whetting for _my_ breast the poinard.

The number of centres of national life,  Serbia proper, Bosnia, Hercogovina, and Montenegro, to take them in the  chronological order of their conquest by the Turks, had been notoriously a  source of weakness to the Serbian state, as is still the case to-day, but  at the same time made it more difficult for the Turks to stamp out the  national consciousness. What still further contributed to this difficulty  was the fact that many Serbs escaped the oppression of Turkish rule by  emigrating to the neighbouring provinces, where they found people of their  own race and language, even though of a different faith. The tide of  emigration flowed in two directions, westwards into Dalmatia and  northwards into Slavonia and Hungary. It had begun already after the final  subjection of Serbia proper and Bosnia by the Turks in 1459 and 1463, but  after the fall of Belgrade, which was the outpost of Hungary against the  Turks, in 1521, and the battle of Mohacs, in 1526, when the Turks  completely defeated the Magyars, it assumed great proportions. As the  Turks pushed their conquests further north, the Serbs migrated before them;  later on, as the Turks receded, large Serb colonies sprang up all over  southern Hungary, in the Banat (the country north of the Danube and east  of the Theiss), in Syrmia (or Srem, in Serbian, the extreme eastern part  of Slavonia, between the Save and the Danube), in Ba[)c]ka (the country  between the Theiss and Danube), and in Baranya (between the Danube and the  Drave). All this part of southern Hungary and Croatia was formed by the  Austrians into a military borderland against Turkey, and the Croats and  immigrant Serbs were organized as military colonists with special  privileges, on the analogy of the Cossacks in southern Russia and Poland.  In Dalmatia the Serbs played a similar role in the service of Venice,  which, like Austria-Hungary, was frequently at war with the Turks. During  the sixteenth century Ragusa enjoyed its greatest prosperity; it paid  tribute to the Sultan, was under his protection, and never rebelled. It  had a quasi monopoly of the trade of the entire Balkan peninsula. It was a  sanctuary both for Roman Catholic Croats and for Orthodox Serbs, and  sometimes acted as intermediary on behalf of its co-religionists with the  Turkish authorities, with whom it wielded great influence. Intellectually  also it was a sort of Serb oasis, and the only place during the Middle  Ages where Serbian literature was able to flourish.    Montenegro during the sixteenth century formed part of the Turkish  province of Scutari. Here, as well as in Serbia proper, northern Macedonia  (known after the removal northwards of the political centre, in the  fourteenth century, as Old Serbia), Bosnia, and Hercegovina, the Turkish  rule was firmest, but not harshest, during the first half of the sixteenth  century, when the power of the Ottoman Empire was at its height. Soon  after the fall of Smederevo, in 1459, the Patriarchate of Pe['c] (Ipek)  was abolished, the Serbian Church lost its independence, was merged in the  Greco-Bulgar Archbishopric of Okhrida (in southern Macedonia), and fell  completely under the control of the Greeks. In 1557, however, through the  influence of a Grand Vizier of Serb nationality, the Patriarchate of  Pe['c] was revived. The revival of this centre of national life was  momentous; through its agency the Serbian monasteries were restored,  ecclesiastical books printed, and priests educated, and more fortunate  than the Bulgarian national Church, which remained under Greek management,  it was able to focus the national enthusiasms and aspirations and keep  alive with hope the flame of nationality amongst those Serbs who had not  emigrated.    Already, in the second half of the sixteenth century, people began to  think that Turkey's days in Europe were numbered, and they were encouraged  in this illusion by the battle of Lepanto (1571). But the seventeenth  century saw a revival of Turkish power; Krete was added to their empire,  and in 1683 they very nearly captured Vienna. In the war which followed  their repulse, and in which the victorious Austrians penetrated as far  south as Skoplje, the Serbs took part against the Turks; but when later  the Austrians were obliged to retire, the Serbs, who had risen against the  Turks at the bidding of their Patriarch Arsen III, had to suffer terrible  reprisals at their hands, with the result that another wholesale  emigration, with the Patriarch at its head, took place into the  Austro-Hungarian military borderland. This time it was the very heart of  Serbia which was abandoned, namely, Old Serbia and northern Macedonia,  including Pe['c] and Prizren. The vacant Patriarchate was for a time  filled by a Greek, and the Albanians, many of whom were Mohammedans and  therefore Turcophil, spread northwards and eastwards into lands that had  been Serb since the seventh century. From the end of the seventeenth  century, however, the Turkish power began unmistakably to wane. The Treaty  of Carlowitz (1699) left the Turks still in possession of Syrmia (between  the Danube and Save) and the Banat (north of the Danube), but during the  reign of the Emperor Charles VI their retreat was accelerated. In 1717  Prince Eugen of Savoy captured Belgrade, then, as now, a bulwark of the  Balkan peninsula against invasion from the north, and by the Treaty of  Passarowitz (Po[)z]arevac, on the Danube), in 1718, Turkey not only  retreated definitively south of the Danube and the Save, but left a large  part of northern Serbia in Austrian hands. By the same treaty Venice  secured possession of the whole of Dalmatia, where it had already gained  territory by the Treaty of Curlowitz in 1699.    But the Serbs soon found out that alien populations fare little better  under Christian rule, when they are not of the same confession as their  rulers, than under Mohammedan. The Orthodox Serbs in Dalmatia suffered  thenceforward from relentless persecution at the hands of the Roman  Catholics. In Austria-Hungary too, and in that part of Serbia occupied by  the Austrians after 1718, the Serbs discovered that the Austrians, when  they had beaten the Turks largely by the help of Serbian levies, were very  different from the Austrians who had encouraged the Serbs to settle in  their country and form military colonies on their frontiers to protect  them from Turkish invasion. The privileges promised them when their help  had been necessary were disregarded as soon as their services could be  dispensed with. Austrian rule soon became more oppressive than Turkish,  and to the Serbs' other woes was now added religious persecution. The  result of all this was that a counter-emigration set in and the Serbs  actually began to return to their old homes in Turkey. Another war between  Austria-Hungary and Turkey broke out in 1737, in which the Austrians were  unsuccessful. Prince Eugen no longer led them, and though the Serbs were  again persuaded by their Patriarch, Arsen IV, to rise against the Turks,  they only did so half-heartedly. By the Treaty of Belgrade, in 1739,  Austria had to withdraw north of the Save and Danube, evacuating all  northern Serbia in favour of the Turks. From this time onwards the lot of  the Serbs, both in Austria-Hungary and in Turkey, went rapidly from bad to  worse. The Turks, as the power of their empire declined, and in return for  the numerous Serb revolts, had recourse to measures of severe repression;  amongst others was that of the final abolition of the Patriarchate of Pee  in 1766, whereupon the control of the Serbian Church in Turkey passed  entirely into the hands of the Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople.    The Austrian Government similarly, perceiving now for the first time the  elements of danger which the resuscitation of the Serbian nationality  would contain for the rule of the Hapsburgs, embarked on a systematic  persecution of the Orthodox Serbs in southern Hungary and Slavonia. During  the reign of Maria Theresa (1740-80), whose policy was to conciliate the  Magyars, the military frontier zone was abolished, a series of repressive  measures was passed against those Serbs who refused to become Roman  Catholics, and the Serbian nationality was refused official recognition.  The consequence of this persecution was a series of revolts which were all  quelled with due severity, and finally the emigration of a hundred  thousand Serbs to southern Russia, where they founded New Serbia in  1752-3.    During the reigns of Joseph II (1780-90) and Leopold II (1790-2) their  treatment at the hands of the Magyars somewhat improved. From the  beginning of the eighteenth century Montenegro began to assume greater  importance in the extremely gradual revival of the national spirit of the  Serbs. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it had formed part  of the Turkish dominions, though, thanks to the inaccessible nature of its  mountain fastnesses, Turkish authority was never very forcibly asserted.  It was ruled by a prince-bishop, and its religious independence thus  connoted a certain secular freedom of thought if not of action. In the  seventeenth century warlike encounters between the Turks and the  Montenegrins increased in frequency, and the latter tried to enlist the  help of Venice on their side but with indifferent success. The fighting in  Montenegro was often rather civil in character, being caused by the  ill-feeling which existed between the numerous Montenegrins who had become  Mohammedans and those who remained faithful to their national Church. In  the course of the eighteenth century the role which fell to Montenegro  became more important. In all the other Serb countries the families which  naturally took a leading part in affairs were either extinct or in exile,  as in Serbia, or had become Mohammedan, and therefore to "]]]
