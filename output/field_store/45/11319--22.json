I was compelled to work over my straw bed to reach the window, but this  window was in the gable end, and the view from it was magnificent, both  town and country being spread out before me.    I could see the cats walking gravely in the gutters; the storks, their  beaks filled with frogs, carrying nourishment to their ravenous brood;  the pigeons, springing from their cotes, their tails spread like fans,  hovering over the streets.    In the evening, when the bells called the world to the Angelus, with my  elbows upon the edge of the roof, I listened to their melancholy  chimes; I watched the windows as, one by one, they were lighted up; the  good burghers smoking their pipes on the sidewalks; the young girls in  their red skirts, with their pitchers under their arms, laughing and  chatting around the fountain \"Saint Sebalt.\" Insensibly all this faded  away, the bats commenced their rapid course, and I retired to my  mattress in sweet peace and tranquillity.    The old curiosity seller, Toubac, knew the way to my little lodging as  well as I did, and was not afraid to climb the ladder. Every week his  ugly head, adorned with a reddish cap, raised the trapdoor, his fingers  grasped the ledge, and he cried out in a nasal tone:    \"Well, well, Master Christian, have you anything?\"    To which I replied:    \"Come in. Why in the devil don't you come in? I am just finishing a  little landscape, and you must tell me what you think of it.\"    Then his great back, seeming to elongate, grew up, even to the roof,  and the good man laughed silently.    I must do justice to Toubac: he never haggled with me about prices; he  bought all my paintings at fifteen florins, one with the other, and  sold them again for forty each. \"This was an honest Jew!\"    I began to grow fond of this mode of existence, and to find new charms  in it day by day.    Just at this time the city of Nuremberg was agitated by a strange and  mysterious event. Not far from my dormer window, a little to the left,  stood the Inn Boeuf-Gras, an old _auberge_ much patronized throughout  the country. Three or four wagons, filled with sacks or casks, were  always drawn up before the door, where the rustic drivers were in the  habit of stopping, on their way to the market, to take their morning  draught of wine.    The gable end of the inn was distinguished by its peculiar form. It was  very narrow, pointed, and, on two sides, cut-in teeth, like a saw. The  carvings were strangely grotesque, interwoven and ornamenting the  cornices and surrounding the windows; but the most remarkable fact was  that the house opposite reproduced exactly the same sculptures, the  same ornaments; even the signboard, with its post and spiral of iron,  was exactly copied.    One might have thought that these two ancient houses reflected each  other. Behind the inn, however, was a grand old oak, whose somber  leaves darkened the stones of the roof, while the other house stood out  in bold relief against the sky. To complete the description, this old  building was as silent and dreary as the Inn Boeuf-Gras was noisy and  animated.    On one side, a crowd of merry drinkers were continually entering in and  going out, singing, tripping, cracking their whips; on the other,  profound silence reigned.    Perhaps, once or twice during the day, the heavy door seemed to open of  itself, to allow a little old woman to go out, with her back almost in  a semicircle, her dress fitting tight about her hips, an enormous  basket on her arm, and her hand contracted against her breast.    It seemed to me that I saw at a glance, as I looked upon her, a whole  existence of good works and pious meditations.    The physiognomy of this old woman had struck me more than once: her  little green eyes, long, thin nose, the immense bouquets of flowers on  her shawl, which must have been at least a hundred years old, the  withered smile which puckered her cheeks into a cockade, the lace of  her bonnet falling down to her eyebrows--all this was fantastic, and  interested me much. Why did this old woman live in this great deserted  house? I wished to explore the mystery.    One day as I paused in the street and followed her with my eyes, she  turned suddenly and gave me a look, the horrible expression of which I  know not how to paint; made three or four hideous grimaces, and then,  letting her palsied head fall upon her breast, drew her great shawl  closely around her, and advanced slowly to the heavy door, behind which  I saw her disappear.    \"She's an old fool!\" I said to myself, in a sort of stupor. My faith,  it was the height of folly in me to be interested in her!    However, I would like to see her grimace again; old Toubac would  willingly give me fifteen florins if I could paint it for him.    I must confess that these pleasantries of mine did not entirely  reassure me.    The hideous glance which the old shrew had given me pursued me  everywhere. More than once, while climbing the almost perpendicular  ladder to my loft, feeling my clothing caught on some point, I trembled  from head to foot, imagining that the old wretch was hanging to the  tails of my coat in order to destroy me.    Toubac, to whom I related this adventure, was far from laughing at it;  indeed, he assumed a grave and solemn air.    \"Master Christian,\" said he, \"if the old woman wants you, take care!  Her teeth are small, pointed, and of marvelous whiteness, and that is  not natural at her age. She has an 'evil eye.' Children flee from her,  and the people of Nuremberg call her 'Fledermausse.'\"    I admired the clear, sagacious intellect of the Jew, and his words gave  me cause for reflection.    Several weeks passed away, during which I often encountered  Fledermausse without any alarming consequences. My fears were  dissipated, and I thought of her no more.    But an evening came, during which, while sleeping very soundly, I was  awakened by a strange harmony. It was a kind of vibration, so sweet, so  melodious, that the whispering of the breeze among the leaves can give  but a faint idea of its charm.    For a long time I listened intently, with my eyes wide open, and  holding my breath, so as not to lose a note. At last I looked toward  the window, and saw two wings fluttering against the glass. I thought,  at first, that it was a bat, caught in my room; but, the moon rising at  that instant, I saw the wings of a magnificent butterfly of the night  delineated upon her shining disk. Their vibrations were often so rapid  that they could not be distinguished; then they reposed, extended upon  the glass, and their frail fibers were again brought to view.    This misty apparition, coming in the midst of the universal silence,  opened my heart to all sweet emotions. It seemed to me that an airy  sylph, touched with a sense of my solitude, had come to visit me, and  this idea melted me almost to tears.    \"Be tranquil, sweet captive, be tranquil,\" said I; \"your confidence  shall not be abused. I will not keep you against your will. Return to  heaven and to liberty.\" I then opened my little window. The night was  calm, and millions of stars were glittering in the sky. For a moment I  contemplated this sublime spectacle, and words of prayer and praise  came naturally to my lips; but, judge of my amazement, when, lowering  my eyes, I saw a man hanging from the crossbeam of the sign of the  Boeuf-Gras, the hair disheveled, the arms stiff, the legs elongated to  a point, and casting their gigantic shadows down to the street!    The immobility of this figure under the moon's rays was terrible. I  felt my tongue freezing, my teeth clinched. I was about to cry out in  terror when, by some incomprehensible mysterious attraction, my glance  fell below, and I distinguished, confusedly, the old woman crouched at  her window in the midst of dark shadows, and contemplating the dead man  with an air of diabolic satisfaction.    Then I had a vertigo of terror. All my strength abandoned me, and,  retreating to the wall of my loft, I sank down and became insensible.    I do not know how long this sleep of death continued. When restored to  consciousness, I saw that it was broad day. The mists of the night had  penetrated to my garret, and deposited their fresh dew upon my hair,  and the confused murmurs of the street ascended to my little lodging. I  looked without. The burgomaster and his secretary were stationed at the  door of the inn, and remained there a long time; crowds of people came  and went, and paused to look in; then recommenced their course. The  good women of the neighborhood, who were sweeping before their doors,  looked on from afar, and talked gravely with each other.    At last a litter, and upon this litter a body, covered with a linen  cloth, issued from the inn, carried by two men. They descended to the  street, and the children, on their way to school, ran behind them.    All the people drew back as they advanced.    The window opposite was still open; the end of a rope floated from the  crossbeam.    I had not dreamed. I had, indeed, seen the butterfly of the night; I  had seen the man hanging, and I had seen Fledermausse.    That day Toubac made me a visit, and, as his great nose appeared on a  level with the floor, he exclaimed:    \"Master Christian, have you nothing to sell?\"    I did not hear him. I was seated upon my one chair, my hands clasped  upon my knees, and my eyes fixed before me.    Toubac, surprised at my inattention, repeated in a louder voice:    \"Master Christian, Master Christian!\" Then, striding over the sill, he  advanced and struck me on the shoulder.    \"Well, well, what is the matter now?\"    \"Ah, is that you, Toubac?\"    \"Eh, _parbleu_! I rather think so; are you ill?\"    \"No, I am only thinking.\"    \"What in the devil are you thinking about?\"    \"Of the man who was hanged.\"    \"Oh, oh!\" cried the curiosity vender. \"You have seen him, then? The  poor boy! What a singular history!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12774"],[0,"Dave Darrin's First Year at Annapolis (#18)"],[1,"ajar,  and stood in such a position that I could glance down the corridor  and keep Mr. Darrin's room door constantly within my range of  vision.\"    \"As a matter of vital fact, Mr. Farley,\" interrupted the commandant  of midshipmen, \"did you at any time relax such vigilance, even for a  few seconds?\"    \"Not even for a few seconds, sir.\"    \"After the inspection that Mr. Page and yourself made, who was the  first person that you saw enter Mr. Darrin's room?\"    \"Mr. Henkel!    \"Was he Alone?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Did you then immediately send Mr Page to the officer in charge?\"    \"I did, sir.\"    \"And yourself?\"    \"Without allowing my glance to turn from Mr. Darrin's door, sir, I  stepped out into the corridor, walked close to Mr. Darrin's room  door, and then stood there until Lieutenant Nettleson and Mr.  Hawkins arrived.\"    \"Then, Mr. Farley, you are certain that there was no disorder in  Mr. Darrin's room at the time when he and Mr. Dalzell left to  recite in mathematics?    \"I am absolutely positive, sir.\"    \"And you are also certain that none but Mr. Henkel entered that room  up to the time when the disorder was discovered by Lieutenant  Nettleson?\"    \"I am certain, sir.\"    Midshipman Page was then questioned.  He bore out the testimony  just given by Farley in every particular.    The manner of the commandant of midshipmen was still gentle when he  turned again to Henkel.    \"Mr. Henkel, do you wish to modify your previous statements in  any way?\"    \"No, sir,\" replied Henkel.  \"In all my answers I have told the  whole and exact truth, as I know it.  I am eager, sir, to answer  any further questions that you may wish to put to me on the subject.\"    \"Gentlemen, you may all withdraw, save Lieutenant Nettleson and  Mr. Henkel,\" announced the commandant, after a few moments of  seemingly mild thought.  \"Mr. Hawkins, of course you understand  that what you know of this matter you know officially, and that  you are not to mention or discuss it until such time as official  action shall have been taken.  As for you other midshipmen, I  see no harm, gentlemen, in your discussing it among yourselves,  but you will see to it that information does not, for the present,  spread through the brigade.  You may go, gentlemen.\"    Once outside Farley and Page walked so rapidly that Dave and Dan  did not attempt to overtake them in the corridors.  But they found  Farley and Page waiting outside Dave's room door.    \"May we come in?\" asked Farley.    \"If anyone on earth may,\" replied Dave heartily, throwing open the  door, then stepping back to allow the others to enter.    \"I'm afraid we've cooked a goose for some one,\" cried Farley,  with grim satisfaction.    \"Great Scott, yes,\" breathed Dan Dalzell, in devout thankfulness.    \"Is it fair, Farley, for me to ask you whether you suspected Henkel  before you caught him?\" queried Dave Darrin.    \"Yes; and the commandant knows that.  Henkel came here one night,  weeks ago, and mysteriously tried to interest us in putting up  a job to get you dropped from the Navy rolls.  When Page and I  really tumbled that an enemy working against you, it didn't take  us two minutes to guess who that enemy was.  Then we started on  the warpath.\"    \"I wonder,\" asked Dave Darrin huskily, \"whether it is really necessary  for me to assure you of the tremendous burden of obligation that  you've put upon me?\"    \"It isn't necessary, any way that you can look at the question,\"  retorted Farley promptly.  \"What we did for you, Darrin, is no  more than we'd stand ready to do for any man in the brigade who  was being ground down and out by a mean trickster.\"    \"Wouldn't I like to take peep in on Henkel, now, while the commandant  is grilling him in that gentle way the commandant has?\" mocked  Midshipman Page.    \"David, little giant, the matter is cleared and as good as squared,\"  cried Dalzell.  \"And now I know this is the first time in my life  that I've ever been really and unutterably happy!\"    During the nest two days it was known through the brigade at large  that Midshipman Henkel was in close arrest.  The brigade did not  at once learn the cause.  Yet, in such appearances as Henkel was  permitted to make, it was noted that he bore himself cheerfully  and confidently.    Then, one day, just before the dinner formation, Darrin was ordered  to report at the commandant's office.    \"Mr. Darrin,\" announced Commander Jephson, when the midshipman  had reported and saluted, \"I am glad to be able to announce that  we have been able to pile up so much evidence against Mr Henkel  that young man finally confessed that it was he, and he alone,  who created all the disorders with your equipment, and in your  room for which so many demerits have been inflicted upon you.  At the dinner formation.  Therefore, when the orders of the day  are published by the brigade adjutant, you will again hear that  your demerits, given for the offenses unjustly charged against  you, have been remitted by order of the superintendent.  You will  also learn that you have been restored to the first conduct grade,  with all the privileges belonging to the midshipmen of that grade.\"    It was with a light heart that Dave Darrin left the commandant's  office, though the young man had been expecting that very decision.    Yet, despite the fact that he knew it was coming, Dave's heart  thrilled with exultation and gratitude as he heard the order read  out in the brigade adjutant's quick, monotonous tones.    Then, immediately following, came another order.    Midshipman Henkel, for dishonorable conduct, was dropped from  the rolls!    \"Fours right, march!\"    By companies the brigade wheeled and marched into the mess hall--the  air resounding with the quick, martial tread of eight hundred or  more of the pick of young American manhood!    As the command \"march\" was given one man fell out of the ranks.  Henkel, from the moment of the publications of the order, was no  longer a midshipman!    He had fallen deservedly, as one not fit to associate with gentlemen,  or to figure among the future defenders of his country of honorable  men.    As the brigade marched indifferently off, and left him there,  Henkel gazed, for a few moments at the solid ranks of blue and  gold, and a great sob welled up within him.  In this supreme moment  he realized all that he had lost--his place among honest men!    Then, crushing down any feeling of weakness, he turned on his heel,  a sneer darkening his face.    Then, recalling himself, Henkel sprang up the steps and hastened to  the room that had been partly his.  Here he discarded his uniform  substituting for it the citizen's clothes which had been brought to  him from the midshipmen's store.  His own few belongings that he  cared about taking with him he packed hastily in a dress-suit case.    Yet the task required time.  His roommate, Brimmer, was back before  Henkel was ready to depart.    \"You'd better wait, now, until the coast is clear,\" whispered  Brimmer.  \"Hosts of the fellows are hanging about outside.\"    \"They won't see me,\" jeered Henkel harshly.  \"I'll wait until  they're off at afternoon duties.  But see here, Brimmer, don't  you dare forget that I might have said much about you, and that  I didn't.  Don't dare forget that I leave to you the task of humbling  that fellow, Darrin.  If you fail me, Brimmer, it won't be too  late for me to do some talking.\"    \"Oh, I'll get Darrin out of here,\" grimaced Brimmer.  \"But I won't  try to do it the way you did.  You went in for enmity.  I'm going  to undo Darrin by being his friend.\"    \"Well, I'm through and ready to leave,\" muttered Henkel.  \"But  I'm not going until the coast is clear.\"    Seating himself by the window, he stared moodily out, thinking  of the life which had strongly appealed to him, and from which  he had exiled himself.  While he was so occupied knock sounded  at the door; then the cadet officer of the day stepped in:    \"I see you are ready to go, Mr. Henkel,\" announced the cadet officer.  \"The published order was to the effect that you leave the Naval  Academy immediately.  The officer in charge has sent me to see that  you comply with the order at once.\"    \"Oh, well,\" muttered Henkel bitterly.  He turned, holding out his  hand to his late roommate.    \"Goodby, Brimmer; good luck!\"    \"The same to you,\" replied Brimmer, as their hands met.  That  was all that was said with the cadet officer of the day looking  on, but both of the late roommates understood the compact of dishonor  that lay between them concerning Dave Darrin's coming fate.    With his derby hat pulled low over his eyes and gripping his suit  case, Henkel slunk through the corridors of Bancroft Hall.  Now  he faced the hardest ordeal of all in going out through the entrance  of the great white building, beyond which stood many groups of  midshipmen.    Now these young men of the Navy caught sight of Henkel.  No goodbyes  were called out to him.  Instead, as his feet struck the flagging  of the walk scores of lips were puckered.  The midshipmen gave  the departing one a whistled tune and furnished the drum part with  their hands.  That tune was--    \"The Rogue's March.\"          CHAPTER XVI    BRIMMER MAKES A NEW FRIEND      \"Darrin, I hope you don't hold me in any way responsible for that  fellow Henkel's actions.    \"Why should I?\" asked Dave, turning and looking into the eyes of  Midshipman Brimmer.    \"I know that, for a while, there was hard feeling between us,\"  continued Brimmer seriously.  \"It took me a long time to get it out  of my stubborn head that you were the one responsible for having our  crowd ragged by the watchman the night of the spread in Annapolis.  Even after Farley changed his mind it took me a long time to believe  that he was right.\"    \"I forgot that whole matter long ago,\" replied Darrin.    \"Then will you accept my tardy apology, and let us be friends?\"  urged Brimmer, holding out his hand.    It was not Dave"]]]
