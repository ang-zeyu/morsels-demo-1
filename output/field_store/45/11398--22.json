The result of sojourning in the woods does not, as might be expected,  have the effect of making these men unsociable, and they embrace every  opportunity of attending a race meeting or dance. When the men are  excited by drink quarrels are frequent, and the police search them for  arms before admitting them to a Re-union.    Arms are carried ostensibly as a precaution against meeting with  Indians and bad characters in the lonely recesses of the forest, and the  men like to carry a knife and a good revolver, or, better still, a  Winchester, to enable them to get a shot at any wild animal they may  come across, the skins of these being much prized. They take a pleasure  in presenting a visitor with a puma skin or other trophy of the chase.    Among these people one looks for, and finds, the primitive idea of  hospitality, an unaffected welcome and willingness to give of the best  they have. Here are men independent by virtue of their labour, which  gives them sufficient for their daily wants. They have no thought for  the morrow or what will be their lot when too feeble to work.    The axemen, who are natives of Italy and Austria, are very good workmen,  but compare unfavourably with natives of the country, being extremely  dirty in their persons, to such a degree that it is a disagreeable  experience to have to interview them in an office, whereas the Argentine  native puts on his best apparel when he goes to an estancia.    The forest workers are nomads, and, as the woods get cut out, move on to  fresh camping grounds, leaving the woods to revert to their former  solitude, a haunt for the wild animals, who creep back once silence has  returned.          CACHAPES, AND OTHER THINGS.          CACHAPES, AND OTHER THINGS.      To a man coming from the Southern Camps to the forest belt of Santa Fe,  the cachape must appeal as something peculiar to the district, and most  essentially local. He has had a surfeit of carts with two wheels, each  12 feet high, and dragged by anything from sixteen to twenty-eight  horses; Russian carts, like Thames punts on four wheels, no longer amuse  him, while American spring carts are much too European to warrant  unslinging the Kodak. But the cachape--here is something not to be  lightly passed over. Lying idle it may not strike him at first sight as  a cart, but rather as a remnant of some revolution, when, tired of  waging light operatic war, the army disbanded, leaving their  gun-carriages to serve more peaceful purposes.    Two pairs of short, squat, enormously powerful wheels; between, and  joining them, a roughly hewn pole and various chains in an apparently  hopeless tangle. Yet see them in work--every niche doing its work, every  chain taking ten per cent, more strain than it was ever intended to  take, creaking, groaning, crashing into holes, crawling laboriously over  snaps and trunks to fall again with its load of four tons with a  jerking, swaying, and straining as though struggling to free itself from  its load, and you recognise the _raison d'etre_ of the queer little  cart.    The capache is not without its humorous moments. Supposing the cartmen  find a log too heavy to load in the ordinary way; they do not return and  inform the boss that the log must be hoisted by mechanical means or  propose high-priced cranes. Seeing that obviously they can't put the log  on the cart, they accept the alternative and put the cart on the log,  chain it on securely, then haul everything right side up again with the  bullocks and proceed to the unloading station. Once there, it might be  supposed that they would tumble the cart over again, but here the  intelligent foreigner is misled. The correct proceeding now is for the  cartmen to lie on their backs and push with their feet, after the manner  of the gentlemen in music halls, who, reclining on sawed-off sofas,  twiddle gold-spangled spheres with their toes; only our cartmen lie in  water and mud and the gold-spangled sphere is changed for a three-ton  log. The force the men can exert in this position is little short of  marvellous. Out one crawls, reviews the situation, then back again  under, a creak, a combined push, and over the wheels comes the log,  throwing up the mud and water for 50 feet around. Then back they go  again for another load six miles through the forest. Wet through, their  clothes hanging in ribbons from shoulders and belt, one day's mud caking  on another's, and with a long sword stuck through their belt in front,  they present a figure comical enough were it not that one knew the other  side of the picture.    Reeking with inherited consumption, they live the one life which is  certain to kill them before they are forty. Wet through and chilled,  they are called upon again and again to suddenly exert enormous  strength, since no man can desert his cart. He must \"get there.\" He must  get out of his trouble. He eats largely when and how he can, and when he  has saved any money the merry \"Taba\" bone charms it from him in a way  too universal perhaps to call for any remark. Sometimes he finishes his  carting days through too decided opinions as to the other man's  integrity in playing \"Taba\"; sometimes on his canvas bed in a hut of mud  and branches, his browny yellow face and sunken eyes asking no pity,  betraying no emotion; in either case he is rarely over thirty-five and  often leaves a wife and children.    I say \"wife and children,\" since it sounds the usual thing; but, as a  matter of strict fact, the ceremony of getting married is deprecated  among them, as it signifies \"Putting on side,\" and is only resorted to  when they are in a village and there is a chance that the presents that  are given will more than compensate the tremendous expense they have to  go to. Speaking to a gentleman of this kidney, I was informed that when  the cross-eyed blacksmith Strike got married, it cost him three dollars  and a-half (say 5s.) in fire crackers alone, and my informant went on to  say that the only case he knew of where marriage had been really  successful was that of the fair-haired carpenter, who was married and  asked all the bosses on the place, who each gave something, with which  he was able to buy a sewing machine for the eldest girl, then aged six.    But, mark you, lest you should judge them lightly, remember that their  unwritten pact is just as binding to them as our formal marriage tie is  to us, and that in their way they are probably better husbands and  fathers than your Balham clerk. In their young days they may chop and  change, which changes are generally marked by little iron crosses in the  woods, but, once they have settled down, desertion is far rarer than in  civilised countries. I have seen a native workman with his shoulder  blade in his arm-pit, his face cut to ribbons, and with pieces of  casting sticking to his back through the carrying away of a crane, cavil  against the idea of being taken into the township where the doctor was,  lest his old woman, unused to a town life, should find the surroundings  uncongenial. This in a broken, muttered whisper, twelve hours after the  accident had happened, during which time every new arrival had been  called upon to witness the peculiar nature of his injuries.    Much has been said about the terrible wickedness of the lower-class  native, his gambling, his immorality, his almost fanatical desire to  murder everyone he sees; and for complete and detailed lists of crimes  and monstrosities appeal to any newcomer, who will be delighted to hold  forth on the subject; but when one has lived with them and worked with  them under varying conditions, and has suffered in some degree what they  suffer, one hesitates to condemn them offhand.    Blackguards they are--but manly, humorous blackguards. Immoral, one must  confess them to be, according to our lights, but even in England \"Custom  from time immemorial\" is held as law.    The vast majority will steal raw hide gear as a cat steals fish, but  will not touch your money, much as in a community of young men property  is common to all with the same exception. They will lie if scared, or  rather will substitute for the truth something they think you would like  to hear, and they will do as little work as you will let them.    But, have a bad case of sickness in the house and ask a man to go out at  midnight with the carriage to get the doctor, or to go on horseback on  his own horse twenty miles for medicine, and he goes as quietly and  pleasantly as though he were going about the most commonplace work. He  expects no tip, no extra wage, nor is he lauded as a hero. He may have  come down, horse and all, in the dark, but is happy if he has not  smashed the bottle of medicine, and he resumes his work on return, just  as if he hadn't been up all night riding at a hard canter over broken  ground full of holes and snags.    No, he is by no means an ideal worker, neither is he half so bad as he's  painted, and I'd rather meet him in the next world than lots of men who  boss him in this.          MY FRIEND THE AXEMAN.        MY FRIEND THE AXEMAN.      Eighty square leagues of dense forest. One is inclined to feel a trifle  small and overcome when this fraction of Mother Earth is put into one's  hands (metaphorically), with orders to know all about it and to be able  to answer all questions as to what is going on in it.    The work is like most other occupations: not quite so romantic as it  sounds at first, but as interesting as one cares to make it.    One's main employment can best be illustrated by a leaf out of a mental  diary.    Fulano de Tal, axeman, wants credit for provisions at the almacen or  general store--Has he sufficient wood cut to warrant it? It is the  Mayor-domo's business to find out.    With this end in view, he rides along \"The Mangy\" watercourse till he  comes to the lowland of \"The Blind Cow.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14368"],[0,"Hebraic Literature; Translations from the Talmud, Midrashim and Kabbala (#18)"],[1,"the  birthright.    _Bava Bathra_, fol. 16, col. 2.    There are five celebrated idolatrous temples, and these are the names of  them:--The Temple of Bel in Babylon, the Temple of Nebo in Chursi, the  Temple of Thretha in Maphog, the Temple of Zeripha in Askelon, and the  Temple of Nashra in Arabia. When Rabbi Dimmi came from Palestine to  Babylon he said there were others, viz, the Temple of Yarid in Ainbechi,  and that of Nadbacha in Accho.    _Avodah Zarah_, fol. 11, col. 2.    \"And they also transgressed my covenant, which I have commanded them;  and they also have taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen,  and dissembled also, and have also put it among their own stuff\" (Josh.  vii. 11). Rav Illaa says, in the name of Rav Yehudah ben Mispartha, the  fivefold repetition of the particle also shows that Achan had trespassed  against all the five books of Moses. The same Rabbi further adds that  Achan had obliterated the sign of the covenant, for it is said in  relation to him, \"And they have also transgressed my covenant;\" and with  reference to circumcision, \"He hath broken my covenant.\"    _Sanhedrin_, fol. 44, col. 1.    He who eats an ant is flogged five times with forty stripes save one.    _Maccoth_, fol. 16, col. 2.    Rabbi Akiva used to say there are five judgments on record each of  twelve months' duration:--That of the deluge, that of Job, that of the  Egyptians, that of Gog and Magog, and that of the wicked in hell. This  last is said of those whose demerits outweigh their virtues, or those  who have sinned against their bodies.    _Edioth_, chap. 2, mish. 10.    Five possessions hath the Holy One--blessed be He!--purchased for  Himself in this world:--(1.) The law is one possession (Prov. viii. 22);  (2.) Heaven and earth is one possession (Isa. lxvi. 1, Ps. civ. 24);  (3.) Abraham is one possession (Gen. xiv. 9); (4.) Israel is one  possession (Exod. xv. 16); (5.) the Temple is one possession, as it is  said (Exod. xv. 17), \"The sanctuary, O Lord, Thy hands have  established.\" And it is also said (Ps. lxxviii. 54), \"And He brought  them to the border of His sanctuary, even to this mountain, which His  right hand had purchased.\"    _Avoth_, chap. 6.    Rabbi Akiva says he who marries a woman not suited to him violates five  precepts:--(1.) Thou shalt not avenge; (2.) thou shalt not bear a  grudge; (3.) thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart; (4.) thou  shalt love thy neighbor as thyself; (5.) and that thy brother may live  with thee. For if he hates her he wishes she were dead, and thus he  diminishes the population.    _Avoth d'Rab. Nathan_, chap. 26.    Five have no forgiveness of sins:--(1.) He who keeps on sinning and  repenting alternately; (2.) he who sins in a sinless age; (3.) he who  sins on purpose to repent; (4.) he who causes the name of God to be  blasphemed. The fifth is not given in the Talmud.    Ibid., chap. 39.    He who has no fringes to his garment transgresses five positive commands  (see Num. xv. 38. etc.; Deut. xxii. 12).    _Menachoth_, fol. 44, col. 1.    A learner who, after five years, sees no profit in studying, will never  see it. Rabbi Yossi says, after three years, as it is written (Dan. i.  4, 5), \"That they should be taught the literature and the language of  the Chaldeans,\" so educating them in three years.    _Chullin_, fol. 24, col. 1.    Any one who doeth any of these things sinneth against himself, and his  blood is upon his own head:--He that (1.) eats garlic, onions, or eggs  which were peeled the night before; (2.) or drinks water drawn over  night; (3.) or sleeps all night in a burying-place; (4.) or pares his  nails and throws the cuttings into the public street.    _Niddah_, fol. 17, col. 1.    Rabbi Yossi said:--\"Never once in all my life have the walls of my house  seen the hem of my shirt; and I have planted five cedars (sons are  figuratively so termed, see Ps. xcii. 12) in Israel--namely, Rabbis  Ishmael, Eliezar, Chalafta, Artilas, and Menachem. Never once in my life  have I spoken of my wife by any other name than house, and of my ox by  any other name than field.\"    _Shabbath_, fol. 118, col. 2.    Six things are a disgrace to a disciple of the wise:--To walk abroad  perfumed, to walk alone by night, to wear old clouted shoes, to talk  with a woman in the street, to sit at table with illiterate men, and to  be late at the synagogue. Some add to these, walking with a proud step  or a haughty gait.    _Berachoth_, fol. 43, col. 2.    A soft-boiled egg is better than six ounces of fine flour.    Ibid., fol. 44, col. 2.    Six things are a certain cure for sickness:--Cabbage, beetroot, water  distilled from dry moss, honey, the maw and the matrix of an animal, and  the edge of the liver.    Ibid.    These six things are good symptoms in an invalid:--Sneezing,  perspiration, evacuation, seminal emission, sleep, and dreaming.    Ibid., fol. 57, col. 2.    Six things bear interest in this world and the capital remaineth in the  world to come:--Hospitality to strangers, visiting the sick, meditation  in prayer, early attendance at the school of instruction, the training  of sons to the study of the law, and judging charitably of one's  neighbors.    _Shabbath_, fol. 127, col. 1.    There are six sorts of tears, three good and three bad:--Those caused by  smoke, or grief, or constipation are bad; and those caused by fragrant  spices, laughter, and aromatic herbs are good.    Ibid., fol. 151, col. 2; fol. 152, col. 1.    Six things are said respecting the illiterate:--No testimony is to be  borne to them, none is to be accepted from them; no secret is to be  disclosed to them; they are not to be appointed guardians over orphans,  nor keepers of the charity-box, and there should be no fellowship with  them when on a journey. Some say also no public notice is to be given of  their lost property.    _P'sachim_, fol. 49, col. 2.        The expression here rendered \"illiterate\" means literally      \"people of the land,\" and was, there is reason to believe,      originally applied to the primitive inhabitants of Canaan,      traces of whom may still be found among the fellahin of Syria.      They appear, like the aboriginal races in many countries of      Christendom in relation to Christianity, to have remained      generation after generation obdurately inaccessible to Jewish      ideas, and so to have given name to the ignorant and untaught      generally. This circumstance may account for the harshness of      some of the quotations which are appended in reference to them.    He who aspires to be a fellow of the learned must not sell fruit, either  green or dry, to an illiterate man, nor may he buy fresh fruit of him.  He must not be the guest of an ignorant man, nor receive such an one as  his guest.    _Demai_, chap. 2, mish. 2.    Our Rabbis teach, Let a man sell all that he has and marry the daughter  of a learned man. If he cannot find the daughter of a learned man, let  him marry the daughter of one of the great men of his day. If he does  not find such a one, let him marry the daughter of one of the heads of  the congregation, or, failing this, the daughter of a charity collector,  or even the daughter of a schoolmaster; but let him not marry the  daughter of an illiterate man, for the unlearned are an abomination, as  also their wives and their daughters.    _P'sachim_, fol. 49, col. 2.    It is said that Rabbi (the Holy) teaches that it is illegal for an  unlearned man to eat animal food, for it is said (Lev. xi. 46), \"This is  the law of the beast and the fowl;\" therefore he who studies the law may  eat animal food, but he who does not study the law may not. Rabbi  Eliezar said, \"It is lawful to split open the nostrils of an unlearned  man, even on the Day of Atonement which happens to fall on a Sabbath.\"  To which his disciples responded, \"Rabbi, say rather to slaughter him.\"  He replied, \"Nay, that would require the repetition of the usual  benediction; but in tearing open his nostrils no benedictory formula is  needed.\" Rabbi Eliezar has also said, \"It is unlawful to travel with  such a one, for it is said (Deut. xxx. 30), 'For it is thy life and the  length of thy days.' The unlearned does not ensure his own life (since  he has no desire to study the law, which would prolong life), how much  less then will he regard the life of his neighbor?\" Rabbi Samuel, son of  Nachman, says on behalf of Rabbi Yochanan, that it is lawful to split  open an unlearned man like a fish. \"Aye,\" adds Rabbi Samuel, \"and that  from his back.\"    _P'sachim_, fol. 49, col. 2.    Rav Yehudah says it is good to eat the pulp of a pumpkin with beetroot  as a remedy, also the essence of hemp seed in Babylonian broth; but it  is not lawful to mention this in the presence of an illiterate man,  because he might derive a benefit from the knowledge not meant for him.    _Nedarim_, fol. 49, col. 1.    No contribution or heave-offering should be given to an ignorant priest.    _Sanhedrin_, fol. 90, col. 2.    No boor can be pious, nor an ignorant man a saint.    _Avoth_, chap. 2, mish. 6.    Sleep in the morning, wine at mid-day, the idle talk of inexperienced  youth, and attending the conventicles of the ignorant drive a man out of  the world.    Ibid., chap. 3, mish. 16.    Rabbi Jonathan says, \"Where do we learn that no present is to be made to  an ignorant priest?\" In 2 Chron. xxxi. 4, for there it is said Hezekiah  \"commanded that all the people that dwelt in Jerusalem should give a  portion to the priests and to the Levites, that they might be strong in  the law of the Lord.\" He who firmly lays hold of the law has a claim to  a portion, otherwise he has none.    _Chullin_, fol. 130, col. 2.    The aged, if ignorant, grow weaker in intellect the older they become in  years, for it is written (Job xii. 20), \"He removeth away the speech of  the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.\" But it is  not so with them that are old in the"]]]
