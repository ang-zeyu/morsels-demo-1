So back we flew to the General at Grembergen. I waited outside  until my companions emerged from the office waving passes.  They were in a gleeful, bantering mood. That evening they  apprised me of the fact that all day I had been traveling as a rich  American with my private photographers securing pictures for the  Belgian Relief Fund.    Leaving our automobile in charge of the chauffeur, we cautiously  made our way over the bridge into the city of Termonde, or what  was once Termonde, for it is difficult to dignify with the name of city  a heap of battered buildings and crumbling brick--an ugly scar  upon the landscape.    I was glad to enter the ruins with my companions instead of alone.  It was not so much fear of stray bullets from a lurking enemy as  the suggestion of the spirits of the slain lingering round these  tombs. For Termonde appeared like one vast tomb. As we first  entered its sepulchral silences we were greatly relieved that the  three specter-like beings who sat huddled up over a distant ruin  turned out not to be ghosts, but natives hopelessly and pathetically  surveying this wreck that was once called home, trying to rake out  of the embers some sort of relic of the past.    A regiment of hungry dogs came prowling up the street, and,  remembering the antics of the past week, they looked at us as if  speculating what new species of crazy human being we were. To  them the world of men must suddenly have gone quite insane, and  if there had been an agitator among them he might well have  asked his fellow-dogs why they had acknowledged a race of  madmen as their masters. Indeed, one could almost detect a  sense of surprise that we didn't use the photographic apparatus to  commit some new outrage. They stayed with us for a while, but at  the sight of our cinema man turning the crank like a machine gun,  they turned and ran wildly down the street.    Emptied bottles looted from winecellars were strung along the  curbs. To some Germans they had been more fatal than the  Belgian bullets, for while one detachment of the German soldiers  had been setting the city blazing with petrol from the petrol flasks,  others had set their insides on fire with liquors from the wine flasks,  and, rolling through the town in drunken orgy, they had fallen  headlong into the canal.    There is a relevant item for those who seek further confirmation as  to the reality of the atrocities in Belgium. If men could get so  drunken and uncontrolled as to commit atrocities on themselves (i.e.,  self-destruction), it is reasonable to infer that they could commit  atrocities on others--and they undoubtedly did. The surprise lies  not in the number of such crimes, but the fewness of them.    Three boys who had somehow managed to crawl across the  bridge were prodding about in the canals with bamboo poles.    \"What are you doing?\" we inquired.    \"Fishing,\" they responded.    \"What for?\" we asked.    \"Dead Germans,\" they replied.    \"What do you do with them--bury them?\"    \"No!\" they shouted derisively. \"We just strip them of what they've  got and shove 'em back in.\"    Their search for these hapless victims was not motivated by any  sentimental reasons, but simply by their business interest as local  dealers in helmets, buttons and other German mementos.    We took pictures of these young water-ghouls; a picture of the  Hotel de Ville, the calcined walls standing like a shell, the inside a  smoking mass of debris; then a picture of a Belgian mitrailleuse  car, manned by a crowd of young and jaunty dare-devils. It came  swinging into the square, bringing a lot of bicycles from a German  patrol which had just been mowed down outside the city. After  taking a shot at an aeroplane buzzing away at a tremendous  distance overhead, they were off again on another scouting trip.    I got separated from my party and was making my way alone  when a sharp \"Hello!\" ringing up the street, startled me. I turned to  see, not one of the photographers, but a fully-armed, though  somewhat diminutive, soldier in Belgian uniform waving his hand  at me.    \"Hello!\" he shouted; \"are you an American?\"    I could hardly believe my eyes or my ears, but managed to shout  back, \"Yes, yes, I'm an American. Are you?\" I asked dubiously.    \"You betcha I'm a 'Merican,\" he replied, coming quickly up to me. It  was my turn again.    \"What are you doing down here--fighting?\" I put in fatuously.    \"What the hell you think I'm doing?\" he rejoined.    I now felt quite sure that he was an American. Further offerings of  similar \"language of small variety but great strength\" testified to his  sojourn in the States.    \"You betcha I'm a 'Merican,\" he reiterated, \"though I was over  there but two years. My name is August Bidden. I worked in a  lumber-mill in Wagner, Wisconsin. Came back here to visit my  family. The war broke out. I was a Reservist and joined my  regiment. I'm here on scout-duty. Got to find out when the  Germans come back into the city.\"    \"Been in any battles?\"    \"You betcha,\" he replied.    \"Kill any Germans?\"    \"You betcha.\"    \"Did you enjoy it?\"    \"You betcha.\"    \"Any around here now?\"    \"You betcha. A lot of them down in the bushes over the brook.\"  Then his eyes flashed a sudden fire as though an inspired idea  had struck him. \"There's no superior officer around,\" he exclaimed  confidentially. \"Come right down with me and you can take a pot-  shot at the damned Boches with my rifle.\" He said it with the air of  a man offering a rare treat to his best friend. I felt that it devolved  on me to exhibit a proper zest for this little shooting-party and save  my reputation without risking my skin. So I said eagerly:    \"Now are you dead sure that the Germans are down there!\"  implying that I couldn't afford any time unless the shooting was  good.    \"You betcha they're down there,\" was his disconcerting reply. \"You  can see their green-gray uniforms. I counted sixteen or seventeen  of them.\"    The thought of that sixteen-to-one shot made my cheeks take on  the color of the German uniforms. The naked truth was my last  resort. It was the only thing that could prevent my zealous friend  from dragging me forcibly down to the brookside. He may have  heard the chattering of my teeth. At any rate he looked up and  exclaimed, \"What's the matter? You 'fraid?\"    I replied without any hesitation, \"You betcha.\"    The happy arrival of the photographer at this juncture, however,  redeemed my fallen reputation; for a soldier is always peculiarly  amenable to the charms of the camera and is even willing to quit  fighting to get his picture taken.    This photograph happens to hit off our little episode exactly. It  shows Ridden serene, smiling, confident, and my sort of evasive  hangdog look as though, in popular parlance, I had just \"got one  put over me.\"    Then, while seated on a battered wall, Ridden poured out his story  of the last two months of hardships and horrors. It was the single  individual's share in the terrific gruelling that the Belgian army had  received while it was beaten back from the eastern frontier to its  stand on the river Scheldt. Always being promised aid by the Allies  if they would hold out just a little longer, they were led again and  again frantically to pit their puny strength against the overwhelming  tide out of the North. For the moment they would stay it. Eagerly  they would listen for sounds of approaching help, asking every  stranger when it was coming. It never came. From position to  position they fell back, stubbornly fighting, a flaming pillar of sparks  and clouds of smoke marking the path of their retreat.    Though smashed and broken that army was never crushed. Its  spirit was incarnate in this cheerful and undaunted Ridden. He  recounted his privations as nonchalantly as if it was just the way  that he had planned to spend his holiday. As a farewell token he  presented me with an epaulet from an officer he had killed, and a  pin from a German woman spy he had captured.    \"Be sure to visit me when you get back to America,\" I cried out  down the street to him.    He stood waving his hand in farewell as in greeting, the same  happy ingenuous look upon his face and sending after me in reply  the same old confident standby, \"You betcha.\" But I do not cherish  a great hope of ever seeing Ridden again. The chances are that,  like most of the Belgian army, he is no longer treading the gray  streets of those demolished cities, but whatever golden streets  there may be in the City Celestial. War is race suicide. It kills the  best and leaves behind the undermuscled and the under-brained  to propagate the species.    Striking farther into the heart of the ruins, we beheld in a section all  burned and shattered to the ground a building which stood straight  up like a cliff intact and undamaged amidst the general wreckage.  As we stumbled over the debris, imagine our surprise when an old  lady of about seventy thrust her head out of a basement window.  She was the owner of the house, and while the city had been the  fighting ground for the armies she had, through it all, bravely stuck  to her home.    \"I was born here, I have always lived here, and I am going to die  here,\" she said, with a look of pride upon her kindly face.    Madame Callebaut-Ringoot was her name. During the  bombardment of the town she had retired to the cellar; but when  the Germans entered to burn the city she stood there at the door  watching the flames rolling up from the warehouses and factories  in the distance. Nearer and nearer came the billowing tide of fire. A  fountain of sparks shooting up from a house a few hundred yards  away marked the advance of the firing squad into her street, but  she never wavered. Down the street came the spoilers, relentless,  ruthless, and remorseless, sparing nothing."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11431"],[0,"Character Sketches of Romance, Fiction and the Drama, Vol. 1 (#18)"],[1,"the charming Annabel his bride.

The song of _Annie Laurie_ was written by William Douglas,  of Fingland, in the stewardry of Kirkcud'bright, hero of the song  _Willie was a Wanton Wag_. (See WHISTLE.)    Bayard Taylor has used the ballad with thrilling effect in his poem  _The Song of the Camp_.

One day Cor'malo, a neighboring  chief, came and begged the honor of a tournament. Argon granted the  request, and overthrew him, which so vexed Cormalo that during a hunt  he shot both the brothers secretly with his bow. Their dog Runa ran  to the palace, and howled so as to attract attention; whereupon Annir  followed the hound, and found both his sons dead, and on his return he  further found that Cormalo had carried off his daughter.

Valere was picked up by a Spanish captain, who  adopted him; Mariane fell into the hands of a corsair, who kept her  a captive for ten years, when she effected her escape; and Anselme  wandered from place to place for ten years, when he settled in Paris,  and intended to marry. At the expiration of sixteen years they all met  in Paris at the house of Har'pagon, the miser. Valere was in love  with Elise (2 _syl_.), the miser's daughter, promised by Harpagon in  marriage to Anselme; and Mariane, affianced to the miser's son Cleante  (2 _syl_.), was sought in marriage by Harpagon, the old father. As  soon as Anselme discovered that Valere and Mariane were his own  children, matters were soon amicably arranged, the young people  married, and the old ones retired from the unequal contest.--Moliere,  _L'Avare_ (1667).    ANSELMO, a noble cavalier of Florence, the friend of Lothario. Anselmo  married Camilla, and induced his friend to try to corrupt her, that  he might rejoice in her incorruptible fidelity. Lothario unwillingly  undertook the task, and succeeded but too well. For a time Anselmo  was deceived, but at length Camilla eloped, and the end of the silly  affair was that Anselmo died of grief, Lothario was slain in battle,  and Camilla died in a convent.--Cervantes, _Don Quixote_, I. iv. 5, 6;  _Fatal Curiosity_ (1605).

Milton, _Paradise Regained_, iv. (563).

N.B.--The only vulnerable part of Orlando was the sole of his foot.    ANTE'NOR, a traitorous Trojan prince, related to Priam. He advised  Ulysses to carry away the palladium from Troy, and when the wooden  horse was built it was Antenor who urged the Trojans to make a breach  in the wall and drag the horse into the city.--Shakespeare has  introduced him in _Troilus and Cressida_ (1602).    ANTHEA, beautiful woman to whom Herrick addresses several poems.    ANTHI'A, the lady beloved by Abroc'omas in the Greek romance called  _De Amoribus Anthiae et Abrocomae_, by Xenophon of Ephesus, who lived  in the fourth Christian century. (This is not Xenophon the historian,  who lived B.C. 444-359.)    ANTHONIO, \"the merchant of Venice,\" in Shakespeare's drama so called  (1598). Anthonio borrows of Shylock, a Jew, 3000 ducats for three  months, to lend to his friend Bassanio. The conditions of the loan  were these: if the money was paid within the time, only the principal  should be returned; but if not, the Jew should be allowed to cut from  Anthonio's body \"a pound of flesh.\" As the ships of Anthonio were  delayed by contrary winds, he was unable to pay within the three  months, and Shylock demanded the forfeiture according to the bond.  Portia, in the dress of a law-doctor, conducted the case, and when the  Jew was about to cut the flesh, stopped him, saying--(1) the bond gave  him no drop of blood; and (2) he must take neither more nor less than  an exact pound. If he shed one drop of blood or if he cut more or  less than an exact pound, his life would be forfeit. As it was quite  impossible to comply with these restrictions, the Jew was nonsuited,  and had to pay a heavy fine for seeking the life of a citizen.    _Antho'nio_, the ursuping duke of Milan, and brother of Pros'pero (the  rightful duke, and father of Miranda).--Shakespeare, _The Tempest_  (1609).    _Antho'nio_, father of Protheus, and suitor of Julia.--Shakespeare,  _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ (1594).
