This  alliance will be in effect a world congress perpetually restraining  aggressive secession, and obviously it must regard all the No-Man's  Lands--and particularly that wild waste, the ocean--as its highway. The  fleets and marines of the allied world powers must become the police of  the wastes and waters of the earth.      VI.    Now, such a collective control of belligerence and international  relations is the obvious common sense settlement of the present world  conflict, it is so manifest, so straight-forward that were it put  plainly to them it would probably receive the assent of nineteen sane  men out of twenty in the world. This, or some such thing as this, they  would agree, is far better than isolations and the perpetual threat of  fresh warfare.    But against it there work forces, within these people and without, that  render the attainment of this generally acceptable solution far less  probable than a kind of no-solution that will only be a reopening of all  our hostilities and conflicts upon a fresh footing. Some of these forces  are vague and general, and can only be combated by a various and  abundant liberal literature, in a widely dispersed battle in which each  right-thinking man must do as his conscience directs him. There are the  vague national antagonisms, the reservations in favor of one's own  country's righteousness, harsh religious and social and moral cant of  the Carlyle type, greed, resentment, and suspicion. The greatest of  these vague oppositions is that want of faith which makes man say war  has always been and must always be, which makes them prophesy that  whatever we do will become corrupted and evil, even in the face of  intolerable present evils and corruptions.    When at the outbreak of the war I published an article headed \"The War  That Will End War,\" at once Mr. W.L. George hastened to reprove my  dreaming impracticability. \"War there has always been.\" Great is the  magic of a word! He was quite oblivious to the fact that war has changed  completely in its character half a dozen times in half a dozen  centuries; that the war we fought in South Africa and the present war  and the wars of mediaeval Italy and the wars of the Red Indians have  about as much in common as a cat and a man and a pair of scissors and a  motor car--namely, that they may all be the means of death.    If war can change its character as much as it has done it can change it  altogether; if peace can be kept indefinitely in India or North America,  it can be kept throughout the world. It is not I who dream, but Mr.  George and his like who are not yet fully awake, and it is their  somnolence that I dread more than anything else when I think of the  great task of settlement before the world.    It is this rather hopeless, inert, pseudo-sage mass of unbelievers who  render possible the continuation of war dangers. They give scope for  the activities of the evil minority which hates, which lives by pride  and grim satisfactions, and which is therefore anxious to have more war  and more. And it is these inert half-willed people who will obstruct the  disentanglement of the settlement from diplomatic hands. \"What do we  know about the nuance of such things?\" they will ask, with that laziness  that apes modesty. It is they who will complain when we seek to buy out  the armaments people. Probably all the private armament firms in the  world could be bought up for seventy million pounds, but the unbelievers  will shake their heads and say: \"Then there will only be something else  instead.\"    Yet there are many ungauged forces on the side of the greater  settlement. Cynicism is never more than a half-truth, and because man is  imperfect it does not follow that he must be futile. Russia is a land of  strange silences, but it is manifest that whatever the innermost quality  of the Czar may be, he is no clap-trap vulgar conqueror of the  Wilhelm-Napoleon pattern. He began his reign, and he may yet crown his  reign, with an attempt to establish peace on a newer, broader  foundation. His religion, it would seem, is his master and not his  servant. There has been no Russian Bernhardi.    And there has been much in America, much said and much done, since the  war broke out that has surprised the world. I may confess for myself,  and I believe that I shall speak for many other Europeans in this  matter, that what we feared most in the United States was levity. We  expected mere excitement, violent fluctuations of opinion, a confused  irresponsibility, and possibly mischievous and disastrous interventions.  It is no good hiding an open secret. We judged America by the peace  headline. It is time we began to offer our apologies to America and  democracy. The result of reading endless various American newspapers and  articles, of following the actions of the American Government, of  talking to representative Americans, is to realize the existence of a  very clear, strong national mentality, a firm, self-controlled,  collective will, far more considerable in its totality than the world  has ever seen before.    We thought the United States would be sentimentally patriotic and  irresponsible, that they would behave as though the New World was,  indeed, a separate planet, and as though they had neither duties nor  brotherhood in Europe. It is quite clear, on the contrary, that the  people of the United States consider this war as their affair also, and  that they have the keenest sense of their responsibility for the general  welfare of mankind.    So that as a second chance, after the possibility of a broad handling of  the settlement by the Czar, and as a very much bigger probability, is  the insistence by America upon her right to a voice in the ultimate  settlement and an initiative from the Western Hemisphere that will lead  to a world congress. There are the two most hopeful sources of that  great proposal. It is the tradition of British national conduct to be  commonplace to the pitch of dullness, and all the stifled intelligence  of Great Britain will beat in vain against the national passion for the  ordinary. Britain, in the guise of Sir Edward Grey, will come to the  congress like a family solicitor among the Gods. What is the good of  shamming about this least heroic of Fatherlands? But Britain would  follow a lead; the family solicitor is honest and well-meaning. France  and Belgium and Italy are too deeply in the affair, or without  sufficient moral prestige, for a revolutionary initiative in  international relationship.    There is, however, a possible third source from which the proposal for a  world congress might come, with the support of both neutrals and  belligerents, and that is The Hague. Were there a man of force and  genius at The Hague now, a man speaking with authority and not as the  scribes, he might thrust enormous benefits upon the world.    It is from these three sources that I most hope for leading now. Of the  new Pope and his influence I know nothing. But in the present situation  of the world's affairs it behooves us ill to wait idle until leaders  clear the way for us. Every man who realizes the broad conditions of the  situation, every one who can talk or write or echo, can do his utmost to  spread his realization of the possibilities of a world congress and the  establishment of world law and world peace that lie behind the monstrous  agonies and cruelties and confusions of this catastrophic year. Given an  immense body of opinion initiatives may break out effectively anywhere;  failing it, they will be fruitless everywhere.          SMALL BUT GREAT-SOULED.    By EMMELINE PANKHURST.    [From King Albert's Book.]      The women of Great Britain will never forget what Belgium has done for  all that women hold most dear.    In the days to come mothers will tell their children how a small but  great-souled nation fought to the death against overwhelming odds and  sacrificed all things to save the world from an intolerable tyranny.    The story of the Belgian people's defense of freedom will inspire  countless generations yet unborn.          Zeppelin Raids on London    By the Naval Correspondent of The London Times    [From The London Times, Jan. 22, 1915.]      Some doubt has been thrown by correspondents upon the ability of the  Zeppelins to reach London from Cuxhaven, the place from which the  raiders of Tuesday night appear to have started. The distance which the  airships traveled, including their manoeuvres over the land, must have  been quite 650 miles. This is not nearly as far as similar airships have  traveled in the past. One of the Zeppelins flew from Friedrichshafen, on  Lake Constance, to Berlin, a continuous flight of about 1,000 miles, in  thirty-one hours. Our naval officers will also recall the occasion of  the visit of the First Cruiser Squadron to Copenhagen in September,  1912, when the German passenger airship Hansa was present. The Hansa  made the run from Hamburg to Copenhagen, a distance of 198 miles, in  seven hours, and Count Zeppelin was on board her. Supposing an airship  left Cuxhaven at noon on some day when the conditions were favorable and  traveled to London, she could not get back again by noon next day if she  traveled at the half-power speed which the vessels on Tuesday appear to  have used. But if she did the run at full speed--that is to say, at  about fifty miles an hour--she could reach London by 9 o'clock the same  evening, have an hour to manoeuvre over the capital, and return by 7  o'clock next morning. With a favorable wind for her return journey, she  might make an even longer stay. Given suitable conditions, therefore, as  on Tuesday, there appears to be no reason why, as far as speed and fuel"]]]
