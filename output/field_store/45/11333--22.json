Our stock of provisions  could not be too carefully preserved and such followers, when beyond  their beat, might have had claims on it not to be resisted. There then  remained with us, besides Piper and his gin, two intelligent native boys,  each being named Tommy, together with The Widow and her child. The two  Tommies obtained new chronometrical surnames, being known in the party as  Tommy Came-first and Tommy Came-last. The former had been told plainly to  go back, upon which he was heard to say he should follow the party,  notwithstanding Majy's orders, as he could always find opossums in the  trees. I was pleased with his independence on being told this, and  allowed him to accompany the party as well as his friend Tommy Came-last,  whom he had picked up somehow in the woods.    A FAMILY OF NATIVES FROM THE MURRUMBIDGEE.    Our female guide maintained that there was a waterhole some miles onward  at Pomabil; and we accordingly proceeded in that direction, regaining  first the firm plains outside the trees growing on the river margin. We  reached the part to which she had pointed and she went forward to look  for the water but, on her calling out soon after that natives were there,  we advanced into the wood, when we observed smoke arising and natives  running away, pursued by The Widow. At length, perceiving that she stood  talking to them, we went up. The strangers consisted of a family just  come from the Murrumbidgee, and presented such a picture of the wild and  wonderful that I felt a strong desire to make a sketch of the whole  group. One man who was rather old being in mourning, as I was told, for  the death of a brother, had his face, head and breast so bedaubed with  white that he resembled a living skeleton; the others had large sticks,  snakes and other reptiles in their hands, but they were perfectly naked  and, crowding around him, presented a strange assemblage.    INCONVENIENT FORMALITY OF NATIVES MEETING.    I was anxious to learn from the principal personage the situation of the  water; but on this first meeting it was necessary, as usual on all such  occasions, to continue for some time patient and silent. This formality  was maintained very remarkably by the old man and Piper. In vain did I  desire the latter to ask him a question; each stood silent for a full  quarter of an hour about eight yards apart, neither looking at the other.  The female however became the intermediate channel of communication, for  both spoke alternately in a low tone to her. At length Piper addressed  the old man, raising his voice a little but with his head averted; and  the other answered him in the same way; until at length by slow degrees  they got into conversation. We were then informed that water was to be  found a mile or two on, and the old man agreed to guide overseer Burnett  and Piper to the place. I conducted the wheel-carriages along the firm  plain outside and, after proceeding more than 2 1/2 miles, I heard a shot  from Burnett, announcing his arrival at the water. I accordingly  proceeded with the party in that direction, and we encamped near the  river, amid the finest verdure that we had yet seen and after a journey  of nine miles. We were informed that the Lachlan contained water in more  abundance one or two days' journey lower down, and that the Murrumbidgee  was not far to the southward.    May 8.    This day being Sunday I gave the cattle rest; but Mr. Stapylton went down  the river with two men to make sure of water at our next stage. They  found a pond at the distance of about eleven miles; the way to it being  over a fine hard plain covered with mesembryanthemum and salsolae. The  party saw a large kangaroo, the first observed on the banks of the  Lachlan during this journey. The old man and his family had proceeded  across to Waljeers in order to procure mussels, the object, as I  understood, of his journey from the Murrumbidgee.    May 9.    We moved to the pond above-mentioned, named Yambarenga, and found near it  a number of large huts similar to those of the Darling. The water was  very green and muddy but the taste was good. The plain we traversed this  day exactly resembled the best of the ground on the Darling; and in some  places I observed the Quandang bushes,* having their branches covered  with a parasitical plant whose bright crimson flowers were very  ornamental.**    (*Footnote. Fusanus acuminatus.)    (**Footnote. Loranthus quandang, Lindley manuscripts; incanus, foliis  oppositis lineari-oblongis obsolete triplinerviis obtusis, pedunculis  axillaribus folio multo bevioribus apice divaricato-bifidis 6-floris,  floribus pentameris aequalibus, petalis linearibus, antheris linearibus  basi insertis. Next L. gaudichaudi.)    THE MURRUMBIDGEE SEEN FROM THE LACHLAN.    South of the spot where we now encamped the ground, which consisted of  firm red clay, gradually rose; and from a tree Burnett observed the tall  yarras of the Murrumbidgee at a distance of about eight miles. The  latitude observed was 34 degrees 14 minutes 37 seconds South, longitude  144 degrees 25 minutes East.    May 10.    A thick fog prevented the men from getting the cattle together as early  as usual. In the meantime I made a drawing of the native female and the  scenery around; and we finally left the encamping ground at a quarter  before eleven. The first part of this day's journey was over a rising  ground, on leaving which the country seemed as if it descended westward  into a lower basin, so that I took the river Lachlan which lay below to  be already the Murrumbidgee.    RICH TINTS ON THE SURFACE.    We next travelled over a fine hard plain covered very generally with  small bushes of a beautiful orange-flowered, spreading under-shrub, with  broad thin-winged fruit;* but the Mesembryanthemum aequilaterale grew  almost everywhere and seemed to take the place of grass. It crept over  the light red earth, ornamenting it with a rich variety of bright green,  light red, purple, and scarlet tints which, when contrasted with the dead  portions that were all of a pale grey colour, produced a fine harmonious  foreground, fit for any landscape. The plains were intersected by a small  wood of goborro (dwarf box) and after crossing this and keeping the lofty  yarra trees in view we found these trees at length growing on ground  which was intersected by hollows full of reeds, other parts of the  surface bearing a green crop of grass.

The banks of the river bore here a very different aspect from any parts  which we had seen above; and I supposed that we were at length  approaching its junction with the Murrumbidgee. The bed was broader but  not so deep, and contained abundance of water at every turning. Ducks,  pigeons, cockatoos and parrots were numerous; and we had certainly  reached a better country than any we had yet traversed.    INHABITED TOMB.    On a corner of the plain, just as we approached the land of reedy  hollows, I perceived at some distance a large, lonely hut of peculiar  construction, and I accordingly rode to examine it. On approaching it I  observed that it was closed on every side, the materials consisting of  poles and large sheets of bark, and that it stood in the centre of a plot  of bare earth of considerable extent, but enclosed by three small ridges,  the surface within the area having been made very level and smooth. I had  little doubt that this was a tomb but, on looking through a crevice, I  perceived that the floor was covered with a bed of rushes which had been  recently occupied. On removing a piece of bark and lifting the rushes, I  ascertained, on thrusting my sabre into the hollow loose earth under  them, that this bed covered a grave.    Tommy Came-first, who was with me, pronounced this to be the work of a  white man; but by the time I had finished a sketch of it The Widow had  hailed him from the woods and told him that it was a grave, after which I  could not prevail on him to approach the spot. I carefully replaced the  bark, anxious that no disturbance of the repose of the dead should  accompany the prints of the white man's feet. I afterwards learnt from  The Widow that the rushes within that solitary tomb were actually the  nightly bed of some near relative or friend of the deceased (probably a  brother) and that the body was thus watched and attended in the grave  through the process of corruption or, as Piper interpreted her account,  until no flesh remains on the bones; \"and then he yan (i.e. goes) away!\"  No fire, the constant concomitant of places of shelter, had ever been  made within this abode alike of the living and the dead, although remains  of several recent fires appeared on the heath outside.    DEAD TREES AMONG THE REEDS.    In the afternoon we came upon the river where rich weeds and lofty reeds  enveloped a soft luxuriant soil. The yarra, or bluegum, not only grew on  its banks, but spread over the flats; but I remarked that where the reeds  grew thickest most of the trees were dead; and that almost all bore on  their trunks the marks of inundation. These dead trees among reeds  suggest several questions: Were they killed by the frequent burning of  the reeds in summer? If so, how came they to grow first to such a size  among them? Or did excess of moisture or its long continuance kill them?  Are seasons now different from those which must have admitted of the  growth of these trees for half a century? Or have changes in the levels  of the deposits"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13053"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art, and Science — Volume 1, No. (#18)"],[1," the little table or  wooden settle on which her lace-pillow rests. Whilst the mother's busy  fingers are thus profitably employed, her eyes keep watch over the  movements of her little ones, and she can at the same time spare an  attentive thought for some one of her humble household duties.    Dressmakers, milliners, and other females employed in the various  occupations which minister to the exigencies of fashion, are confined  to close rooms, surrounded by masses of silk, muslin, &c. They are  debarred the healthful practice of working in the open air, and can  scarcely venture even to sit at an open window, because a drop of  rain or a puff of wind may be fatal to their work and its materials.  The lace-maker, on the contrary, whose work requires only her thread  and her fingers, is not disturbed by a refreshing breeze or a light  shower; and even when the weather is not particularly fine, she  prefers sitting at her street-door or in her garden, where she enjoys  a brighter light than within doors.    In most of the principal towns of the Netherlands there is one  particular locality which is the focus of lace-making industry; and  there, in fine weather, the streets are animated by the presence of  the busy work-women. In each of these districts there is usually one  wide open street which the _Speldewerkers_ prefer to all others, and  in which they assemble and form themselves into the most picturesque  groups imaginable. It is curious to observe them, pouring out  of narrow lanes and alleys, carrying with them their chairs and  lace-pillows, to take their places in the wide open street, where they  can enjoy more of bright light and fresh air than in their own places  of abode.    \"I could not help contrasting,\" says Kohl, \"the pleasing aspect of  these streets with the close and noisy workrooms in woolen and cotton  manufactories. There the workpeople are all separated and classified  according to age and sex, and marshaled like soldiers. Their domestic  and family ties are rudely broken. There chance or exigency separates  the young factory girl from her favorite companions, and dooms her to  association with strangers. There social conversation and the merry  song are drowned in that stunning din of machinery, which in the end  paralyzes even the power of thought.\"    Our German friend is a little hard upon factory life. Though not  so picturesque, it does not, if candidly viewed, offer so very  unfavorable a contrast to that passed by the Belgian Lace Workers.           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM BENTLEY'S MISCELLANY.]    THE TOMB OF LADY BLESSINGTON.    BY MRS. ROMER.      \"[Greek: Eudeis all ou seio lelasmenoi esmen]!\"    \"Thou sleepest, but we do not forget thee!\"    It is too much the way of the world in this our civilized Europe  to neglect the receptacles of the dead. Those loved ones even,  whose dwellings, while living, were thronged by admiring friends,  are deserted when laid in their last narrow home. The breath once  gone,--the last sad offices performed,--the funeral pomp over,--and  the sepulchre closed,--all the requisites of affection and respect  appear to have been fulfilled, and the spot that holds the dust once  so doted upon, is forever abandoned! Witness the damp graves overgrown  with rank nettles and thorns, the degraded tombstones, the illegible  moss-covered epitaphs of our church-yards! Witness the dreary oblivion  of our over-crowded vaults, where the eye of affection has never  shed a tear, the hand of friendship never scattered a flower over  the mouldering relics they inclose! It is not that the dead are  forgotten--it is not that their memory has ceased to be dear and  sacred to their friends--but it is that the gay and the worldly-minded  shrink from the dark images called forth by the aspect of the grave;  they recoil from the idea of familiarizing themselves with the  inevitable spot where they must one day lie in \"cold obstruction's  apathy;\" they deem it fond folly to nourish grief by keeping before  their eyes that which perpetually reminds them of the loss they have  sustained, and thus they fly from the dwellings of the dead, and  abandon what was once dearest to them to darkness and the worm.    A tenderer and more reverent spirit prevails in the East. There the  Cities of the Dead are the constant resort of the living. The tombs of  friends and kindred are as carefully tended, as regularly visited as  their habitations were while yet they were dwellers upon earth. The  grave of a departed relative is a spot consecrated to sweet and solemn  recollections, where the followers of Mohammed love to meditate and to  pray. In the mausoleum of the Viceroys of Egypt carpets and cushions  are spread around the various tombs it contains, and once in every  week the wives and daughters of the dead repair thither and pass the  greater part of the day in contemplation and self-communion. In the  public cemeteries alms are distributed at the graves of the pious:  even the winged wanderers of the air find refreshment there, for on  each sepulchral stone a small receptacle is hollowed out to collect  the dews of heaven, where the birds, as they flutter past, may slake  their thirst. On each succeeding Sabbath fresh green branches adorn  the headstones, and vailed mourners, seated by them, keep silent  watch, in the fond belief that the lifeless occupant of the tomb is  conscious of their presence there.[4]    The loftier, purer character of our faith leads us to reject such  fancies as gross superstitions; and yet there is something touching  in them! We treasure a lock of hair--a glove--a ribbon--a flower, once  worn by an absent loved one; why should we not more tenderly treasure  the dust that has once been ennobled by enshrining the immortal  spirit of a departed friend, or deem it weakness to watch over these  mouldering relics as fondly as though they were still conscious of  our care? And surely if the enfranchised spirit is permitted to be  cognisant of that which passes upon earth--if, from those blessed  abodes whither it has winged its course, a care can be bestowed upon  the earthly coil it has thrown off, or upon the creatures of clay  who still toil and grovel here below, may we not suppose that it  contemplates with pitying complacency the clinging tenderness which  binds the hearts of the living to the ashes of the dead, the desperate  affection with which we look our last upon the lifeless form which  never more can respond to all our love and all our sorrow, and the  fond fidelity which leads us to hover round the tomb that has forever  shut it from our view?    I love to think that such may be the case; nor can I separate the  idea, weak and idle though it may be, that the souls of the departed  mourn over the neglect and abandonment of their earthly remains, _as  the first step toward forgetfulness of their memory._ To me, the  grave of a friend possesses an attraction, which, although tinged with  deepest sadness, is wholly distinct from the horror with which the  imagination so often invests it. My heart yearns to look upon the last  resting-place of those I have loved.    I would shelter those sacred spots from the beating rain, screen them  from the wintry winds, plant around them the flowers that were once  preferred by their unconscious tenants, and inscribe over the entrance  of every cemetery the beautiful line of Koerner's      \"Vergiss die treuen Todten nicht!\"    \"Forget not the faithful dead!\"    It was in this spirit that, one day during my recent visit to Paris,  I escaped from the busy idleness of that gay and ever-bustling city,  to make a pilgrimage to the tomb of one whose surpassing qualities  of mind, and heart, and person, had endeared her to all who knew  her--whose brilliant career had been closed with awful suddenness--and  whose lamented death has left a void in the circle over which she  presided with such graceful urbanity, which no other can hope to  fill. By a strange coincidence, it was precisely on that day, the year  before, that she had paid me her farewell visit in London; little did  either of us then foresee how and where that visit would be returned  by me! The regret of parting was then softened by our mutual  conviction that many meetings were in store for us in the new home she  had chosen for herself in a foreign land. Alas! before many weeks had  elapsed she was suddenly summoned to her eternal home! In the midst of  health, and hope, and enjoyment, Death insidiously laid his icy grasp  upon her; but so gently was the blow dealt, that neither sigh nor  struggle marked her passage from life to immortality; and before her  stunned friends could bring themselves to believe that her warm heart  had indeed grown cold, the vaults of the Madeleine had received all  that was left on earth of the once beautiful and gifted Marguerite  Blessington.    But not to remain there. A tomb was constructed for her, far from  the crowded cemeteries of the capital, in a spot which she herself  would have selected, could her wishes have been consulted. On  the confines of the quiet village of Chambourey, a league beyond  St. Germain-en-Laye, a green eminence, crowned with luxuriant  chestnut-trees, divides the village church-yard from the grounds  of the Duke de Gramont. On that breezy height, overlooking the  magnificent plain that stretches between St. Germain and Paris, a  mausoleum has been erected worthy of containing the mortal remains of  her whom genius and talent had delighted to honor--      \"Whom Lawrence painted and whom Byron sung!\"    A pyramid composed of large blocks of white stone, and similar in  form to the ancient monuments of Egypt, rises from a platform of solid  black granite, which has been completely isolated from the surrounding  surface by a deep dry moat, whose precipitous slopes are clothed with  softest greenest turf.
