This, be it keenly marked, has ever  been the one simple condition in every age and in every part of the earth.    Abraham _believed_ God and it was reckoned to him for righteousness. The  devout Hebrew, reverently, penitently standing with his hand on the head  of his sacrifice, at the tabernacle door, _believed_ God and it was  reckoned to _him_ for righteousness. The devout heathen with face turned  up to the hill top, and feet persistently toiling up, patiently seeking  glory and honor and incorruption _believes_ God, though he may not know  His name, and it is reckoned to _him_ for righteousness. The devout  Christian, with his hand in Christ's, _believes_ God, and it is counted to  _him_ for righteousness.    The devout Hebrew, the earnest heathen, and the more enlightened believer  in Jesus group themselves here by the common purpose that grips them  alike. The Hebrew with his sacrifice, the heathen with his patient  continuance, and the Christian who _knows_ more in knowing Jesus, stand  together under the mother wing of God.          Some Surprising Results of the Tragic Break        <u>The Surprised Jew.</u>      God proposes. Man disposes. God proposed a king, and a world-wide kingdom  with great prosperity and peace. Man disposed of that plan for the bit of  time and space controlled by his will, and in its place interposed for the  king, a cross. Out of such a radical clashing of two great wills have come  some most surprising results.    The first surprise was for the Jew. Within a few weeks after Jesus' final  departure, Jerusalem, and afterward Palestine, was filled with thousands  of people believing in Him. A remarkable campaign of preaching starts up  and sweeps everything before it. Jesus' name was on every tongue as never  before. But there were earnest Jews who could not understand how Jesus  could be the promised Messiah. He had not set up a kingdom. Their  Scriptures were full of a kingdom.    The Jew, whether in their largest colony in Babylon, or in Jerusalem, or  in Rome, or Alexandria, or the smaller colonies everywhere, was full of  the idea, the hope, of a kingdom. He was absorbed with more or less  confused and materialized, unspiritual ideas of a coming glory for his  nation through a coming king. But among the followers of this Jesus there  is something else coming into being, a new organization never even hinted  at in their Scriptures. It is called the church. It is given a name that  indicates that it is to be made up of persons taken out from among all  nations.    There comes to be now a three-fold division of all men. There had been  with the Jews, always, a two-fold division, the Jew and the Gentiles, or  outside nations. Now three, the Jew, the outsiders, and the church. The  church is an eclectic society, a chosen out body. Its principle of  organization is radically different from that of the Hebrew nation. There  membership was by birthright. Here it is by individual choice and belief.    Foreigners coming in were not required to become Jews, as under the old,  but remained essentially as they have been in all regards, except the one  thing of relationship to Jesus in a wholly spiritual sense. There is  constant talk about \"the _gospel_ of the kingdom,\" but the kingdom itself  _seems_ to have quite slipped away, and the church is in its place. Such a  situation must have been very puzzling to any Jew. His horizon was full of  a kingdom--a _Jew_ kingdom. Anything else was unthinkable. These intense  Orientals could not conceive of anything else. It had taken a set of  visions to swing Peter and the other church leaders into line even on  letting outsiders into the church.    This Jesus does not fill out this old Hebrew picture of a king and a  kingdom. How _can_ He be the promised Messiah? This was to thousands a  most puzzling question, and a real hinderance to their acceptance of  Jesus, even by those profoundly impressed with the divine power being  seen.    This was the very question that had puzzled John the Baptist those weary  months, till finally he sends to Jesus for some light on his puzzle. Jesus  fills out part of the plan, and splendidly, but only part, and may be what  seems to some the smaller part. Can it be, John asks, that there is to be  another one coming to complete the picture? To him Jesus does not give an  answer, except that he must wait and trust. He would not in words  anticipate the nation's final rejection, though so well He knew what was  coming. Their chance was not yet run out for the acceptance of Jesus that  would fill out John's picture. God never lets His foreknowledge influence  one whit man's choice. It was a most natural and perplexing difficulty,  both for John and later for these thousands.    The answer to all this has its roots down in that tragic break. In the old  picture of the Messiah there are two distinct groups of characteristics of  the coming king, _personal_ and _official_. He was to have a direct  personal relation to men and an official relation to the nation, and  through it to the world. The personal had in it such matters as healing  the sick, relieving the distressed, raising the dead, feeding the hungry,  easing heart strains, teaching and preaching. It was wholly a personal  service. The official had, of course, to do with establishing the great  kingdom and bringing all other nations into subjection. Now, it was a bit  of the degeneracy of the people and of the times, that when Jesus came the  blessings to the individual had slipped from view, and that the national  conception, grown gross and coarse, had seized upon the popular  imagination, and was to the fore.    Jesus filled in perfectly with marvellous fulness the individual details  of the prophetic picture. Of course filling in the national depended upon  national acceptance, and failure there meant failure for that side. And,  of course, He could not fill out the national part except through the  nation's acceptance of Him as its king. Rejection there meant a breaking,  a hindering of that part. And so Jesus _does not_ fill out the old Hebrew  picture of the Messiah. He could not without the nation's consent. Man  would have used force to seize the national reins. But, of course, God's  man could not do that. It would be against God's plan for man. Everything  must be through man's consent.    Out of this perplexity there came to be the four Gospels. They grew up out  of the needs of the people. Mark seems to have written his first. He makes  a very simple recital, setting down the group of facts and sayings as He  had heard Peter telling them in many a series of talks. It is the  simplest of the four, aiming to tell what he had gotten from another. But  it offers no answer to these puzzling questions.    Matthew writes his account of the gospel for these great numbers of  perplexed, earnest Jewish questioners. They are Palestinian Jews,  thoroughly familiar with Jewish customs and places. Sitting backward on  the edge of the Hebrew past, thoroughly immersed in its literature and  atmosphere, but with his face fastened on Jesus, he composes out of the  facts about Jesus and the old prophetic scriptures a perfect bit of  mosaic. There is the fascination of a serpent's eye in turning from the  prophetic writings to the Gospel of Matthew. Let a man become immersed and  absorbed in the vision of the Hebrew prophetic books and then turn to  Matthew to get the intense impression that this promised One _has_ come,  at last has actually come, _and_--tragedy of tragedies--_is being  rejected_.    This is the gap gospel. It bridges the gap between the prophetic books and  the book of Acts, between the kingdom which has slipped out and the church  which has come in. It explains the adjournment of the kingdom for a  specified time, the church filling a sort of interregnum in the kingdom.  The kingdom is to come later when the church mission is complete. It tells  with great care and with convincing power that Jesus filled perfectly the  prophecy of the Messiah in every detail _personally_, and did not fill out  the _national_ features because of the nation's unwillingness. That is  the Matthew Gospel.    Paul was the apostle to the outside nations. His great work was outside of  Palestine. He dealt with three classes, Jews, outsiders who in religious  matters had allied themselves with the Jews, but without changing their  nationality, and then the great outside majority, chiefly the great crowds  of other nationalities. These people needed a gospel of their own. Their  standpoint is so wholly different from the Jews' that Matthew's gospel  does not suit, nor Mark's. Paul, through Peter and Barnabas and others,  has absorbed the leading facts and teachings of those three years, and  works them over for his non-Jewish crowds. He omits much that would appeal  peculiarly to Jews, and gives the setting and coloring that would be most  natural to his audiences.    His studious companion, Doctor Luke, undertakes to write down this account  of Jesus' life as Paul tells it, and for Paul's audience and territory,  especially these great outside non-Jewish crowds of people. He goes to  Palestine, and carefully studies and gathers up all the details and facts  available. He adds much that the two previous writers had not included.  One can easily understand his spending several days with Mary, the now  aged mother of Jesus, in John's home in Jerusalem, and from her lips  gleaning the exquisite account of the nativity of her divinely conceived  Son. He largely omits names of places, for they would be unknown and not  of value or interest. When needed, he gives explanation about places.    These three gospels follow one main line; they tell the story of the  _rejection_ of Jesus. Then there arose a generation that did not know  Jesus, the Jesus that had tramped Jerusalem's streets and Galilee's roads.  Some were wondering, possibly, how it was that these "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12814"],[0,"Philippine Folk Tales (#18)"],[1,"of it. This  revived him and he proceeded to cook the rice. As he did so, however,  he heard someone laugh near by, and turning he beheld an old woman  watching him. As he greeted her, she drew near and talked with him  while he ate the rice.    Of all the people in the land, the old woman told him, only a very  few were still alive, and they hid in a cave in the ground from whence  they never ventured. As for herself and her old husband, she went on,  they had hidden in a hollow tree, and this they had never dared leave  until after Sulayman killed the voracious bird, Pah.    At Indarapatra's earnest request, the old woman led him to the cave  where he found the headman with his family and some of his people. They  all gathered about the stranger, asking many questions, for this  was the first they had heard about the death of the monsters. When  they found what Indarapatra had done for them, they were filled  with gratitude, and to show their appreciation the headman gave his  daughter to him in marriage, and she proved to be the beautiful girl  whom Indarapatra had seen at the mouth of the cave.    Then the people all came out of their hiding-place and returned to  their homes where they lived in peace and happiness. And the sea  withdrew from the land and gave the lowlands to the people.        The Story of Bantugan    _Moro_      Before the Spaniards occupied the island of Mindanao,  there lived  in the valley of the Rio Grande a very strong man, Bantugan, whose  father was the brother of the earthquake and thunder. [146]    Now the Sultan of the Island [147] had a beautiful daughter whom  Bantugan wished to marry, but the home of the Sultan was far off,  and whoever went to carry Bantugan's proposal would have a long and  hazardous journey. All the head men consulted together regarding who  should be sent, and at last it was decided that Bantugan's own son,  Balatama, was the one to go. Balatama was young but he was strong and  brave, and when the arms of his father were given him to wear on the  long journey his heart swelled with pride. More than once on the way,  however, his courage was tried, and only the thought of his brave  father gave him strength to proceed.    Once he came to a wooden fence which surrounded a stone in the form of  a man, and as it was directly in his path he drew his fighting knife  to cut down the fence. Immediately the air became as black as night  and stones rained down as large as houses. This made Balatama cry, but  he protected himself with his father's shield and prayed, calling on  the winds from the homeland until they came and cleared the air again.    Thereupon Balatama encountered a great snake [148] in the road,  and it inquired his errand. When told, the snake said:    \"You cannot go on, for I am guard of this road and no one can pass.\"    The animal made a move to seize him, but with one stroke of his  fighting knife the boy cut the snake into two pieces, one of which  he threw into the sea and the other into the mountains.    After many days the weary lad came to a high rock in the road,  which glistened in the sunlight. From the top he could look down  into the city for which he was bound. It was a splendid place with  ten harbors. Standing out from the other houses was one of crystal  and another of pure gold. Encouraged by this sight he went on, but  though it seemed but a short distance, it was some time before he at  last stood at the gate of the town.    It was not long after this, however, before Balatama had made known his  errand to the Sultan, and that monarch, turning to his courtiers, said:    \"You, my friends, decide whether or not I shall give the hand of my  daughter to Bantugan in marriage.\"    The courtiers slowly shook their heads and began to offer objections.    Said one, \"I do not see how Bantugan can marry the Sultan's daughter  because the first gift must be a figure of a man or woman in pure  gold.\"    \"Well,\" said the son of Bantugan, \"I am here to learn what you want  and to say whether or not it can be given.\"    Then a second man spoke: \"You must give a great yard with a floor of  gold, which must be three feet thick.\"    \"All this can be given,\" answered the boy.    And the sister of the Princess said: \"The gifts must be as many as  the blades of grass in our city.\"    \"It shall be granted,\" said Balatama.    \"You must give a bridge built of stone to cross the great river,\"  said one.    And another: \"A ship of stone you must give, and you must change into  gold all the cocoanuts and leaves in the Sultan's grove.\"    \"All this can be done,\" said Balatama. \"My uncles will give all save  the statue of gold, and that I shall give myself. But first I must  go to my father's town to secure it.\"    At this they were angry and declared that he had made sport of them  and unless he produced the statue at once they would kill him.    \"If I give you the statue now,\" said he, \"there will come dreadful  storms, rain, and darkness.\"    But they only laughed at him and insisted on having the statue,  so he reached in his helmet and drew it forth.    Immediately the earth began to quake. A great storm arose, and stones  as large as houses rained until the Sultan called to Balatama to put  back the statue lest they all be killed.    \"You would not believe what I told you,\" said the boy; \"and now I am  going to let the storm continue.\"    But the Sultan begged him and promised that Bantugan might marry his  daughter with no other gifts at all save the statue of gold. Balatama  put back the statue into his helmet, and the air became calm again  to the great relief of the Sultan and his courtiers. Then Balatama  prepared to return home, promising that Bantugan would come in three  months for the wedding.    All went well with the boy on the way home until he came to the fence  surrounding the stone in the form of a man, and there he was detained  and compelled to remain four months.    Now about this time a Spanish general heard that Bantugan was preparing  to marry the Sultan's daughter, whom he determined to wed himself. A  great expedition was prepared, and he with all his brothers embarked on  his large warship which was followed by ten thousand other ships. They  went to the Sultan's city, and their number was so great that they  filled the harbor, frightening the people greatly.    Then the General's brother disembarked and came to the house of the  Sultan. He demanded the Princess for the General, saying that if the  request were refused, the fleet would destroy the city and all its  people. The Sultan and his courtiers were so frightened that they  decided to give his daughter to the General, the next full moon being  the date set for the wedding.    In the meantime Bantugan had been preparing everything for the  marriage which he expected to take place at the appointed time. But  as the days went by and Balatama did not return, they became alarmed,  fearing he was dead. After three months had passed, Bantugan prepared  a great expedition to go in search of his son, and the great warship  was decorated with flags of gold.    As they came in sight of the Sultan's city, they saw the Spanish  fleet in the harbor, and one of his brothers advised Bantugan not  to enter until the Spaniards left They then brought their ship to  anchor. But all were disappointed that they could not go farther, and  one said, \"Why do we not go on? Even if the blades of grass turn into  Spaniards we need not fear.\" Another said: \"Why do we fear? Even if  the cannon-balls come like rain, we can always fight.\" Finally some  wanted to return to their homes and Bantugan said: \"No, let us seek  my son. Even though we must enter the harbor where the Spaniards are,  let us continue our search.\" So at his command the anchors were lifted,  and they sailed into the harbor where the Spanish fleet lay.    Now at this very time the Spanish general and his brother were with  the Sultan, intending to call upon the Princess. As the brother talked  with one of the sisters of the Princess they moved toward the window,  and looking down they saw Bantugan's ships entering the harbor. They  could not tell whose flags the ships bore. Neither could the Sultan  when he was called. Then he sent his brother to bring his father who  was a very old man, to see if he could tell. The father was kept in  a little dark room by himself that he might not get hurt, and the  Sultan said to his brother:    \"If he is so bent with age that he cannot see, talk, or walk, tickle  him in the ribs and that will make him young again; and, my Brother,  carry him here yourself lest one of the slaves should let him fall  and he should hurt himself.\"    So the old man was brought, and when he looked out upon the ships  he saw that the flags were those of the father of Bantugan who had  been a great friend of his in his youth. And he told them that he and  Bantugan's father years ago had made a contract that their children  and children's children should intermarry, and now since the Sultan  had promised his daughter to two people, he foresaw that great trouble  would come to the land. Then the Sultan said to the General:    \"Here are two claimants to my daughter's hand. Go aboard your ships  and you and Bantugan make war on each other, and the victor shall  have my daughter.\"    So the Spaniards opened fire upon Bantugan, and for three days the  earth was so covered with smoke from the battle that neither could  see his enemy. Then the Spanish general said:    \"I cannot see Bantugan or the fleet anywhere, so let us go and claim  the Princess.\"    But the Sultan said: \"We must wait until the smoke rises to make sure  that Bantugan is gone.\"    When the smoke rose, the ships of Bantugan were apparently unharmed  and the Sultan said:    \"Bantugan has surely won, for his fleet is uninjured while yours is  badly damaged. You have lost.\"    \"No,\" said the General, \"we will fight it out on dry land.\"    So they both"]]]
