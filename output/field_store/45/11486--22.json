Not yet, but if ye'll look through this window  (_he indicates window_) presently, ye'll see him gotten ready for  death.

(_The girl is sobbing, her head on her arms._)    MARY STEWART. Och! be quiet now; I would be listening till the  last sound of it passes into the great hills and over all the  wide world.--It is fitting for you to be crying, a child that  cannot understand; but water shall never wet eye of mine for  Dugald Stewart. Last night I was but the mother of a lad that  herded sheep on the Athole hills: this morn it is I that am the  mother of a man who is among the great ones of the earth. All  over the land they will be telling of Dugald Stewart. Mothers  will teach their children to be men by him. High will his name be  with the teller of fine tales.--The great men came, they came in  their pride, terrible like the storm they were, and cunning with  words of guile were they. Death was with them.... He was but a  lad, a young lad, with great length of days before him, and the  grandeur of the world. But he put it all from him. \"Speak,\" said  they, \"speak, and life and great riches will be for yourself.\"  But he said no word at all! Loud was the swelling of their wrath!  Let the heart of you rejoice, Morag Cameron, for the snow is red  with his blood. There are things greater than death. Let them  that are children shed the tears.

[CURTAIN]          THE SUN[1]    John Glasworthy      SCENE: A GIRL sits crouched over her knees on a stile close to a  river. A MAN with a silver badge stands beside her clutching the  worn top plank. THE GIRL'S level brows are drawn together; her  eyes see her memories. THE MAN'S eyes see THE GIRL; he has a  dark, twisted face. The bright sun shines; the quiet river flows;  the cuckoo is calling; the mayflower is in bloom along the hedge  that ends in the stile on the towing-path.    [Footnote 1: From _Scribner's Magazine_, May, 1919.  Copyright by Charles Scribner's Sons; included by special  permission of the writer and publishers.]    THE GIRL. God knows what 'e'll say, Jim.    THE MAN. Let 'im. 'E's come too late, that's all.    THE GIRL. He couldn't come before. I'm frightened. 'E was fond o'  me.    THE MAN. And aren't I fond of you? My Gawd!    THE GIRL. I ought to 'a' waited, Jim; with 'im in the fightin'.    THE MAN (_passionately_). And what about me? Aren't I been in the  fightin'--earned all I could get?    THE GIRL (_touching him_). Ah!    THE MAN. Did you--    (_He cannot speak the words._)    THE GIRL. Not like you, Jim--not like you.    THE MAN. 'Ave a spirit, then.    THE GIRL. I promised 'im.    THE MAN. One man's luck'a another's poison. I've seen it.    THE GIRL. I ought to 'a' waited. I never thought 'e'd come back  from the fightin'.    THE MAN (_grimly_). Maybe 'e'd better not 'ave.    THE GIRL (_looking back along the tow-path_). What'll 'e be like, I  wonder?    THE MAN (_gripping her shoulder_). Daise, don't you never go back  on me, or I should kill you, and 'im too.    (THE GIRL _looks at him, shivers, and puts her lips to his._)    THE GIRL. I never could.    THE MAN. Will you run for it? 'E'd never find us.    (THE GIRL _shakes her head._)    THE MAN (_dully_). What's the good o' stayin'? The world's wide.    THE GIRL. I'd rather have it off me mind, with him 'ome.    THE MAN (_clenching his hands_). It's temptin' Providence.    THE GIRL. What's the time, Jim?    THE MAN (_glancing at the sun_). 'Alf past four.    THE GIRL (_looking along the towing-path_). 'E said four o'clock.  Jim, you better go.    THE MAN. Not I. _I've_ not got the wind up. I've seen as  much of hell as he has, any day. What like is he?    THE GIRL (_dully_). I dunno, just. I've not seen 'im these three  years. I dunno no more, since I've known you.    THE MAN. Big, or little chap?    THE GIRL. 'Bout your size. Oh! Jim, go along!    THE MAN. No fear! What's a blighter like that to old Fritz's  shells? We didn't shift when they was comin'. If you'll go, I'll  go; not else.    (_Again she shakes her head._)    THE GIRL. Jim, do you love me true? (_For answer_, THE MAN _takes  her avidly in his arms._) I ain't ashamed--I ain't ashamed. If 'e  could see me 'eart.    THE MAN. Daise! If I'd known you out there I never could 'a'  stuck it. They'd 'a' got me for a deserter. That's 'ow I love  you!    THE GIRL. Jim, don't lift your 'and to 'im. Promise!    THE MAN. That's according.    THE GIRL. Promise!    THE MAN. If 'e keeps quiet, I won't. But I'm not accountable--not  always, I tell you straight--not since I've been through that.    THE GIRL (_with a shiver_). Nor p'r'aps 'e isn't.    THE MAN. Like as not. It takes the lynchpins out, I tell you.    THE GIRL. God 'elp us!    THE MAN (_grimly_). Ah! We said that a bit too often. What we want,  we take, now; there's no one to give it us, and there's no  fear'll stop us; we seen the bottom o' things.    THE GIRL. P'r'aps 'e'll say that too.    THE MAN. Then it'll be 'im or me.    THE GIRL. I'm frightened.    THE MAN (_tenderly_). No, Daise, no! (_He takes out a knife._) The  river's 'andy. One more or less. 'E shan't 'arm you; nor me  neither.    THE GIRL (_seizing his hand_). Oh! no! Give it to me, Jim!    THE MAN (_smiling_). No fear! (_He puts it away._) Shan't 'ave no  need for it, like as not. All right, little Daise; you can't be  expected to see things like what we do. What's a life, anyway?  I've seen a thousand taken in five minutes. I've seen dead men on  the wires like flies on a fly-paper; I've been as good as dead  meself an 'undred times. I've killed a dozen men. It's nothin'.  'E's safe, if 'e don't get my blood up. If 'e does, nobody's  safe; not 'im, nor anybody else; not even you. I'm speakin'  sober.    THE GIRL (_softly_). Jim, you won't go fightin', wi' the sun out  and the birds all callin'?    THE MAN. That depends on 'im. I'm not lookin' for it. Daise, I  love you. I love your eyes. I love your hair. I love you.    THE GIRL. And I love you, Jim. I don't want nothin' more than you  in the whole world.    THE MAN. Amen to that, my dear. Kiss me close!    (_The sound of a voice singing breaks in on their embrace._ THE  GIRL _starts from his arms and looks behind her along the  towing-path._ THE MAN _draws back against the hedge, fingering his  side, where the knife is hidden. The song comes nearer._)      I'll be right there to-night    Where the fields are snowy white;    Banjos ringin', darkies singin'--    All the world seems bright.    THE GIRL. It's 'im!    THE MAN. Don't get the wind up, Daise. I'm here!    (_The singing stops. A man's voice says: Christ! It's Daise; it's  little Daise 'erself_! THE GIRL _stands rigid. The figure of a  soldier appears on the other side of the stile. His cap is tucked  into his belt, his hair is bright in the sunshine; he is lean,  wasted, brown, and laughing._)    SOLDIER. Daise! Daise! Hallo, old pretty girl!    (THE GIRL _does not move, barring the way, as it were._)    THE GIRL. Hallo, Jack! (_Softly_) I got things to tell you.    SOLDIER. What sort o' things, this lovely day? Why, I got things  that'd take me years to tell. 'Ave you missed me, Daise?    THE GIRL. You been so long.    SOLDIER. So I 'ave. My Gawd! It's a way they 'ave in the Army. I  said when I got out of it I'd laugh. Like as the sun itself I  used to think of you, Daise, when the crumps was comin' over, and  the wind was up. D' you remember that last night in the wood?  \"Come back, and marry me quick, Jack!\" Well, 'ere I am--got me  pass to 'eaven. No more fightin', an' trampin,' no more sleepin\"  rough. We can get married now, Daise. We can live soft an' 'appy.  Give us a kiss, old pretty.    THE GIRL (_drawing back_). No.    SOLDIER (_blankly_). Why not?    (THE MAN, _with a swift movement, steps along the hedge to_ THE  GIRL'S _side._)    THE MAN. That's why, soldier.    SOLDIER (_leaping over the stile_). 'Oo are you, Pompey? The sun  don't shine in your inside, do it? 'Oo is 'e, Daise?    THE GIRL. My man.    SOLDIER. Your--man! Lummy! \"Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a  thief\"! Well, soldier? So you've been through it, too. I'm  laughin' this mornin', as luck will 'ave it. Ah! I can see your  knife.    THE MAN (_who has half drawn his knife_). Don't laugh at _me_,  I tell you.    SOLDIER. Not at you, soldier, not at you. (_He looks from one to  the other._) I'm laughin' at things in general. Where did you get  it, soldier?    THE MAN (_watchfully_). Through the lung.    SOLDIER. Think o' that! An' I never was touched. Four years an'  never was"]]]
