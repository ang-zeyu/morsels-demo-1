This laudable practice has grown out of necessity, and if it has its  disadvantages, such for instance as being called upon at an inconvenient  season for a return of help, by those who have formerly assisted you,  yet it is so indispensable to you that the debt of gratitude ought to be  cheerfully repaid. It is, in fact, regarded in the light of a debt of  honour; you cannot be forced to attend a bee in return, but no one that  can does refuse, unless from urgent reasons; and if you do not find it  possible to attend in person you may send a substitute in a servant or  in cattle, if you have a yoke.    In no situation, and under no other circumstance, does the equalizing  system of America appear to such advantage as in meetings of this sort.  All distinctions of rank, education, and wealth are for the time  voluntarily laid aside. You will see the son of the educated gentleman  and that of the poor artisan, the officer and the private soldier, the  independent settler and the labourer who works out for hire, cheerfully  uniting in one common cause. Each individual is actuated by the  benevolent desire of affording help to the helpless, and exerting  himself to raise a home for the homeless.    At present so small a portion of the forest is cleared on our lot, that  I can give you little or no description of the spot on which we are  located, otherwise than that it borders on a fine expanse of water,  which forms one of the Otanabee chain of Small Lake. I hope, however, to  give you a more minute description of our situation in my next letter.    For the present, then, I bid you adieu.          LETTER VIII.    Inconveniences of first Settlement.--Difficulty of obtaining Provisions  and other necessaries.--Snow-storm and Hurricane.--Indian Summer, and  setting-in of Winter.--Process of clearing the Land.    November the 20th, 1832.    OUR log-house is not yet finished, though it is in a state of  forwardness. We are still indebted to the hospitable kindness of S------  and his wife for a home. This being their first settlement on their land  they have as yet many difficulties, in common with all residents in the  backwoods, to put up with this year. They have a fine block of land,  well situated; and S------ laughs at the present privations, to which he  opposes a spirit of cheerfulness and energy that is admirably calculated  to effect their conquest. They are now about to remove to a larger and  more commodious house that has been put up this fall, leaving us the use  of the old one till our own is ready.    We begin to get reconciled to our Robinson Crusoe sort of life, and the  consideration that the present evils are but temporary, goes a great way  towards reconciling us to them.    One of our greatest inconveniences arises from the badness of our roads,  and the distance at which we are placed from any village or town where  provisions are to be procured.    Till we raise our own grain and fatten our own hogs, sheep, and poultry,  we must be dependent upon the stores for food of every kind. These  supplies have to be brought up at considerable expense and loss of time,  through our beautiful bush roads; which, to use the words of a poor  Irish woman, \"can't be no worser.\" \"Och, darlint,\" she said, \"but they  are just bad enough, and can't be no worser. Och, but they aren't like  to our iligant roads in Ireland.\"    You may send down a list of groceries to be forwarded when a team comes  up, and when we examine our stores, behold rice, sugar, currants,  pepper, and mustard all jumbled into one mess. What think you of a rice-  pudding seasoned plentifully with pepper, mustard, and, may be, a little  rappee or prince's mixture added by way of sauce. I think the recipe  would cut quite a figure in the Cook's Oracle or Mrs. Dalgairn's  Practice of Cookery, under the original title of a \"bush pudding.\"    And then woe and destruction to the brittle ware that may chance to  travel through our roads. Lucky, indeed, are we if, through the superior  carefulness of the person who packs them, more than one-half happens to  arrive in safety. For such mishaps we have no redress. The storekeeper  lays the accident upon the teamster, and the teamster upon the bad  roads, wondering that he himself escapes with whole bones after a  journey through the bush.    This is now the worst season of the year;--this, and just after the  breaking up of the snow. Nothing hardly but an ox-cart can travel along  the roads, and even that with difficulty, occupying two days to perform  the journey; and the worst of the matters is, that there are times when  the most necessary articles of provisions are not to be procured at any  price. You see, then, that a settler in the bush requires to hold  himself pretty independent, not only of the luxuries and delicacies of  the table, but not unfrequently even of the very necessaries.    One time no pork is to be procured; another time there is a scarcity of  flour, owing to some accident that has happened to the mill, or for the  want of proper supplies of wheat for grinding; or perhaps the weather  and bad roads at the same time prevent a team coming up, or people from  going down. Then you must have recourse to a neighbour, if you have the  good fortune to be near one, or fare the best you can on potatoes. The  potatoe is indeed a great blessing here; new settlers would otherwise be  often greatly distressed, and the poor man and his family who are  without resources, without the potatoe must starve.    Once our stock of tea was exhausted, and we were unable to procure more.  In this dilemma milk would have been an excellent substitute, or coffee,  if we had possessed it; but we had neither the one nor the other, so we  agreed to try the Yankee tea--hemlock sprigs boiled. This proved, to my  taste, a vile decoction; though I recognized some herb in the tea that  was sold in London at five shillings a pound, which I am certain was  nothing better than dried hemlock leaves reduced to a coarse powder.    S------ laughed at our wry faces, declaring the potation was excellent;  and he set us all an example by drinking six cups of this truly sylvan  beverage. His eloquence failed in gaining a single convert; we could not  believe it was only second to young hyson. To his assurance that to its  other good qualities it united medicinal virtues, we replied that, like  all other physic, it was very unpalatable.    \"After all,\" said S------, with a thoughtful air, \"the blessings and the  evils of this life owe their chief effect to the force of contrast, and  are to be estimated by that principally. We should not appreciate the  comforts we enjoy half so much did we not occasionally feel the want of  them. How we shall value the conveniences of a cleared farm after a few  years, when we can realize all the necessaries and many of the luxuries  of life.\"    \"And how we shall enjoy green tea after this odious decoction of  hemlock,\" said I.    \"Very true; and a comfortable frame-house, and nice garden, and pleasant  pastures, after these dark forests, log-houses, and no garden at all.\"    \"And the absence of horrid black stumps,\" rejoined I. \"Yes, and the  absence of horrid stumps. Depend upon it, my dear, your Canadian farm  will seem to you a perfect paradise by the time it is all under  cultivation; and you will look upon it with the more pleasure and pride  from the consciousness that it was once a forest wild, which, by the  effects of industry and well applied means, has changed to fruitful  fields. Every fresh comfort you realize around you will add to your  happiness; every improvement within-doors or without will raise a  sensation of gratitude and delight in your mind, to which those that  revel in the habitual enjoyment of luxury, and even of the commonest  advantages of civilization, must in a great degree be strangers. My  pass-words are, 'Hope! Resolution! and Perseverance!'\"    \"This,\" said my husband, \"is true philosophy; and the more forcible,  because you not only recommend the maxim but practise it also.\"    I had reckoned much on the Indian summer, of which I had read such  delightful descriptions, but I must say it has fallen far below my  expectations. Just at the commencement of this month (November) we  experienced three or four warm hazy days, that proved rather close and  oppressive. The sun looked red through the misty atmosphere, tinging the  fantastic clouds that hung in smoky volumes, with saffron and pale  crimson light, much as I have seen the clouds above London look on a  warm, sultry spring morning.    Not a breeze ruffled the waters, not a leaf (for the leaves had not  entirely fallen) moved. This perfect stagnation of the air was suddenly  changed by a hurricane of wind and snow that came on without any  previous warning. I was standing near a group of tall pines that had  been left in the middle of the clearing, collecting some beautiful  crimson lichens, S------ not being many paces distant, with his oxen  drawing fire-wood. Suddenly we heard a distant hollow rushing sound that  momentarily increased, the air around us being yet perfectly calm. I  looked up, and beheld the clouds, hitherto so motionless, moving with  amazing rapidity in several different directions. A dense gloom  overspread the heavens. S------, who had been busily engaged with the  cattle, had not noticed my being so near, and now called to me to use  all the speed I could to gain the house, or an open part of the  clearing, distant from the pine-trees. Instinctively I turned towards  the house, while the thundering shock of trees falling in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13575"],[0,"How to Observe in Archaeology (#18)"],[1,"99, Athens, [Greek] 1889.    All antiquities found are the property of the Government and are  controlled by an Archaeological Commission, consisting of the Ephor  General of Antiquities and the ephors of the archaeological  collections in Athens. Fixed antiquities must be reported by the  discoverer to the Ephor General or one of the ephors of antiquities  or other official. Damaging of ruins or remains of monuments is  forbidden. Owners of the land on which portable antiquities desirable  for the National Museums are found are compensated to the extent of  half their value. Any person who finds antiquities on his land must  report them within five days, on pain of confiscation. The same  applies to any one who finds antiquities on another person's land, or  in any other way comes into possession of antiquities. Informers  against breaches of the law are rewarded by the amount of the  compensation due to those who keep the law. Objects not considered  worth keeping by the Museums are returned to the owner of the land.  Excavations, even on private property, must be authorized by the  Ministry of Education. The Government has the right of expropriating  land for purposes of excavation. In Government excavations, the owner  of the land receives one-third of the value of the objects considered  worth keeping by the Museums. Secret excavation is punished by  confiscation of the finds, imprisonment and temporary loss of civil  rights. In authorized excavations by a landowner or his  representative the excavator receives half the value of the finds  taken by the Museums. Any one attempting to excavate on another man's  land is punished by imprisonment. Antiquities found in the country  may not be exported (on pain of imprisonment or fine and temporary  loss of civil rights) without permission, which is only granted for  objects not considered by the Archaeological Commission to be of use  to the Museums. Such objects on export are subject to a tax of 10  percent. _ad valorem_ unless declared entirely valueless by the  Commission. Antiquities imported into the country must be declared in  the Customs House and reported to the Ephor General of Antiquities, a  descriptive catalogue in duplicate being sent, and cannot be re-  exported without permission, which is obtained by producing the  articles with the original catalogue to the Ephor General; if not  reported they are regarded as having been found in the country.

Constantinople,  Imprimerie du _Levant Herald,_ Pera, 1906.    Antiquities are controlled by the Director-General of the Imperial  Museums and a Commission, the Directors of Public Instruction in the  provinces acting as agents. All ancient monuments and objects  (including those of Islamic date) are the property of the Government.  Any fixed antiquities discovered must be reported under pain of fine  within 15 days to the official in charge of antiquities, or in his  absence to the nearest civil or military official. Punishment by fine  and imprisonment is inflicted for destroying or injuring monuments,  measuring or making impressions without authorization.    Transportable antiquities found on a man's land must be reported by  him within a week. The landowner receives half the value of objects  thus reported and bought by the State; objects not reported are  confiscated, and the landowner fined. This clause applies to those  who find antiquities on land belonging to other private persons or to  the State. Excavation is the exclusive privilege of the Museums, but  firmans may be obtained by scientific societies and specialists.  Unauthorized excavation is punished by imprisonment and confiscation.  The State has the right of making preliminary soundings and of  expropriation. Applications for leave to excavate must be made to the  Minister of Public Instruction. All finds belong to the State.  Unauthorized dealing in antiquities is punishable by fine,  imprisonment, and confiscation. Exportation of antiquities found in  the Empire is forbidden. Antiquities imported must be reported to the  directorate of antiquities, and may not be sent from one part of the  Empire to another, or re-exported, without permission from the  Director-General.    The Cypriote Law of Antiquities.    To Consolidate and Amend the Law relating to Ancient Monuments and  Antiquities, and to provide Museums. Law no. IV of 1905. See Sir J.  T. Hutchinson and S. Fisher, _The Statute Laws of Cyprus,_ 1878-1906  (London, 1906), pp. 595-608.    Objects later than the Turkish conquest, and coins of Byzantine or  later times, are not deemed to be antiquities. All undiscovered  antiquities of movable character are the property of the Government;  all immovable antiquities are also the property of the Government,  unless some person shall be the owner of them. All antiquities must  be reported by the person in possession of them to the Museum  Committee, on pain of confiscation; antiquities found except in the  course of authorized excavations must be reported within five days to  the District Commissioner, One-third of such movable antiquities is  taken by the Government, one-third by the finder, and one-third by  the owner of the land. Damage to ancient monuments is punished by  fine or imprisonment or both. Unauthorized excavation, even on land  belonging to the excavator, and the purchasing of objects illegally  excavated, are punished by fine or imprisonment or both. Application  for leave to excavate must be made to the Chief Secretary for  Government. All antiquities found in excavation belong to the  Government; only duplicates, and objects not required by the Museum,  are given to the excavator. The Government has the right to  expropriate land for the purpose of excavations. The Museum Committee  may acquire the interests of any private person in an antiquity on  payment of compensation. If the sum agreed on is not paid within six  months, the Museum Committee loses all right to its acquisition.  Export of antiquities is forbidden except with the permission of the  High Commissioner, which is granted only for objects not required by  the Museum or for antiquities the interests in which the Museum  Committee has failed to acquire in the manner described.

Transportable  antiquities when found must be reported to nearest administrative  authority or agents of the Service of Antiquities: the finder  receives half the objects thus reported or their value. Excavation,  dealing in antiquities, and exportation are forbidden unless under  authorization. Destruction of and damage to antiquities is punishable  by fine and imprisonment. Applications for leave to export or to  excavate should be made to the Director-General of Service of  Antiquities. A tax of 1 1/2 per cent. is levied on the declared value  of objects passed for export. Leave to excavate is granted only to  savants recommended by Governments or learned societies, or to  private persons presenting proper guarantees. The excavator pays the  cost of guarding the site. The Government takes half the portable  objects found.      General Principles of a Model Law of Antiquities for the Near and  Middle East.    The following statement of Principles which should form the  foundation of the Laws of Antiquities to be enacted for the various  Provinces formerly under Turkish rule was drawn up by an  International Committee in Paris and recommended to the Commission  for regulating the Mandates under the League of Nations. It follows  closely the Recommendations of the Archaeological Joint Committee on  the same subject. It was proposed at the same time that the Treaty  with Turkey should enjoin the adoption by that Power of a Law of  Antiquities on the same lines:    Principes du reglement devant etre adopte par chacune des Puissances  mandataires.    1. 'ANTIQUITY' signifie toute construction, tout produit de  l'activite humaine, anterieur a l'annee 1700.    2, Toute personne qui, ayant decouvert une antiquite, la signalera a  un employe du Departement des Antiquites du pays, sera recompensee  suivant la valeur de l'objet, le principe a adopter devant etre  d'agir par encouragement plutot que par menace.    3. Aucun objet antique ne pourra etre vendu sauf au Departement des  Antiquites du pays, mais si ce Departement renonce a l'acquerir la  vente en deviendra libre. Aucune antiquite ne pourra sortir du pays  sans un permis d'exportation dudit Departement.    4. Toute personne qui, expres ou par negligence, detruira ou  deteriorera un objet ou une construction antique, devra etre passible  d'une peine a fixer par l'autorite du pays.    5. Aucun deblaiement ni aucune fouille ayant pour objet la recherche  d'antiquites ne seront permis sous peine d'amendc, sauf aux personnes  autorisees par le Departement des Antiquites du pays.    6. Des conditions equitables devront etre fixees par chaque Puissance  mandataire pour l'expropriation temporaire ou permanente des terrains  qui pourraient offrir un interet historique ou archeologique.    7. Les autorisations pour les fouilles ne devront etre accordees  qu'aux personnes qui offrent des garanties suffisantes d'experience  archeologique. Aucune des Puissances mandataires ne devra, en  accordant ces autorisations, agir de facon a ecarter, sans motif  valable, les savants des autres nations.     8. Les produits des fouilles pourront etre divises entre le  fouilleur et le Departement des Antiquites de chaque pays dans une  proportion fixee par ce Departement. Si, pour des "]]]
