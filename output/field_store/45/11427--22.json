Quocirca et sensibus utitur et artis  efficit, quasi sensus alteros, et usque eo philosophiam ipsam corroborat,  ut virtutem efficiat, ex qua re una vita omnis apta sit. Ergo ii, qui  negant quicquam posse comprehendi, haec ipsa eripiunt vel instrumenta vel  ornamenta vitae vel potius etiam totam vitam evertunt funditus ipsumque  animal orbant animo, ut difficile sit de temeritate eorum, perinde ut causa  postulat, dicere.    32. Nec vero satis constituere possum quod sit eorum consilium aut quid  velint. Interdum enim cum adhibemus ad eos orationem eius modi: 'Si ea,  quae disputentur, vera sint, tum omnia fore incerta,' respondent: 'Quid  ergo istud ad nos? num nostra culpa est? naturam accusa, quae in profundo  veritatem, ut ait Democritus, penitus abstruserit.' Alii autem elegantius,  qui etiam queruntur, quod eos insimulemus omnia incerta dicere, quantumque  intersit inter incertum et id, quod percipi non possit, docere conantur  eaque distinguere. Cum his igitur agamus, qui haec distinguunt: illos, qui  omnia sic incerta dicunt, ut stellarum numerus par an impar sit, quasi  desperatos aliquos relinquamus. Volunt enim--et hoc quidem vel maxime vos  animadvertebam moveri--probabile aliquid esse et quasi veri simile, eaque  se uti regula et in agenda vita et in quaerendo ac disserendo.    XI. 33. Quae ista regula est veri et falsi, si notionem veri et falsi,  propterea quod ea non possunt internosci, nullam habemus? Nam si habemus,  interesse oportet ut inter rectum et pravum, sic inter verum et falsum. Si  nihil interest, nulla regula est nec potest is, cui est visio veri falsique  communis, ullum habere iudicium aut ullam omnino veritatis notam. Nam cum  dicunt hoc se unum tollere, ut quicquam possit ita videri, ut non eodem  modo falsum etiam possit videri, cetera autem concedere, faciunt  pueriliter. Quo enim omnia iudicantur sublato reliqua se negant tollere: ut  si quis quem oculis privaverit, dicat ea, quae cerni possent, se ei non  ademisse. Ut enim illa oculis modo agnoscuntur, sic reliqua visis, sed  propria veri, non communi veri et falsi nota. Quam ob rem, sive tu  probabilem visionem sive probabilem et quae non impediatur, ut Carneades  volebat, sive aliud quid proferes quod sequare, ad visum illud, de quo  agimus, tibi erit revertendum. 34. In eo autem, si erit communitas cum  falso, nullum erit iudicium, quia proprium in communi signo notari non  potest. Sin autem commune nihil erit, habeo quod volo: id enim quaero, quod  ita mihi videatur verum, ut non possit item falsum videri. Simili in errore  versantur, cum convicio veritatis coacti perspicua a perceptis volunt  distinguere et conantur ostendere esse aliquid perspicui, verum illud  quidem impressum in animo atque mente, neque tamen id percipi atque  comprehendi posse. Quo enim modo perspicue dixeris album esse aliquid, cum  possit accidere ut id, quod nigrum sit, album esse videatur? aut quo modo  ista aut perspicua dicemus aut impressa subtiliter, cum sit incertum vere  inaniterne moveatur? Ita neque color neque corpus nec veritas nec  argumentum nec sensus neque perspicuum ullum relinquitur. 35. Ex hoc illud  iis usu venire solet, ut, quidquid dixerint, a quibusdam interrogentur:  'Ergo istuc quidem percipis?' Sed qui ita interrogant, ab iis irridentur.  Non enim urguent, ut coarguant neminem ulla de re posse contendere neque  adseverare sine aliqua eius rei, quam sibi quisque placere dicit, certa et  propria nota. Quod est igitur istuc vestrum probabile? Nam si, quod cuique  occurrit et primo quasi adspectu probabile videtur, id confirmatur, quid eo  levius? 36. Sin ex circumspectione aliqua et accurata consideratione, quod  visum sit, id se dicent sequi, tamen exitum non habebunt: primum quia iis  visis, inter quae nihil interest, aequaliter omnibus abrogatur fides:  deinde, cum dicant posse accidere sapienti ut, cum omnia fecerit  diligentissimeque circumspexerit, exsistat aliquid quod et veri simile  videatur et absit longissime a vero, ne si magnam partem quidem, ut solent  dicere, ad verum ipsum aut quam proxime accedant, confidere sibi poterunt.  Ut enim confidant, notum iis esse debebit insigne veri, quo obscurato et  oppresso quod tandem verum sibi videbuntur attingere? Quid autem tam  absurde dici potest quam cum ita locuntur: 'Est hoc quidem illius rei  signum aut argumentum et ea re id sequor, sed fieri potest ut id, quod  significatur, aut falsum sit aut nihil sit omnino.' Sed de perceptione  hactenus. Si quis enim ea, quae dicta sunt, labefactare volet, facile etiam  absentibus nobis veritas se ipsa defendet.    XII. 37. His satis cognitis, quae iam explicata sunt, nunc de adsensione  atque approbatione, quam Graeci [Greek: synkatathesin] vocant, pauca  dicemus, non quo non latus locus sit, sed paulo ante iacta sunt fundamenta.  Nam cum vim, quae esset in sensibus, explicabamus, simul illud aperiebatur,  comprehendi multa et percipi sensibus, quod fieri sine adsensione non  potest. Deinde cum inter inanimum et animal hoc maxime intersit, quod  animal agit aliquid--nihil enim agens ne cogitari quidem potest quale  sit--, aut ei sensus adimendus est aut ea, quae est in nostra potestate  sita, reddenda adsensio. 38. At vero animus quodam modo eripitur iis, quos  neque sentire neque adsentiri volunt. Ut enim necesse est lancem in libra  ponderibus impositis deprimi, sic animum perspicuis cedere. Nam quo modo  non potest animal ullum non appetere id, quod accommodatum ad naturam  appareat--Graeci id [Greek: oikeion] appellant--, sic non potest obiectam  rem perspicuam non approbare. Quamquam, si illa, de quibus disputatum est,  vera sunt, nihil attinet de adsensione omnino loqui. Qui enim quid  percipit, adsentitur statim. Sed haec etiam secuntur, nec memoriam sine  adsensione posse constare nec notitias rerum nec artis, idque, quod maximum  est, ut sit aliquid in nostra potestate, in eo, qui rei nulli adsentietur,  non erit. 39. Ubi igitur virtus, si nihil situm est in ipsis nobis? Maxime  autem absurdum vitia in ipsorum esse potestate neque peccare quemquam nisi  adsensione: hoc idem in virtute non esse, cuius omnis constantia et  firmitas ex iis rebus constat, quibus adsensa est et quas approbavit,  omninoque ante videri aliquid quam agamus necesse est, eique, quod visum  sit, adsentiatur. Qua re qui aut visum aut adsensum tollit, is omnem  actionem tollit e vita.    XIII. 40. Nunc ea videamus, quae contra ab his disputari solent. Sed prius  potestis totius eorum rationis quasi fundamenta cognoscere. Componunt  igitur primum artem quandam de iis, quae visa dicimus, eorumque et vim et  genera definiunt, in his, quale sit id, quod percipi et comprehendi possit,  totidem verbis quot Stoici. Deinde illa exponunt duo, quae quasi contineant  omnem hanc quaestionem: quae ita videantur, ut etiam alia eodem modo videri  possint nec in iis quicquam intersit, non posse eorum alia percipi, alia  non percipi: nihil interesse autem, non modo si omni ex parte eiusdem modi  sint, sed etiam si discerni non possint. Quibus positis unius argumenti  conclusione tota ab his causa comprehenditur. Composita ea conclusio sic  est: 'Eorum, quae videntur, alia vera sunt, alia falsa, et quod falsum est,  id percipi non potest: quod autem verum visum est, id omne tale est, ut  eiusdem modi etiam falsum possit videri.' Et, 'quae visa sint eius modi, ut  in iis nihil intersit, non posse accidere ut eorum alia percipi possint,  alia non possint. 41. Nullum igitur est visum quod percipi possit.' Quae  autem sumunt, ut concludant id, quod volunt, ex his duo sibi putant  concedi: neque enim quisquam repugnat. Ea sunt haec: 'Quae visa falsa sint,  ea percipi non posse,' et alterum: 'Inter quae visa nihil intersit, ex iis  non posse alia talia esse, ut percipi possint, alia ut non possint:'  reliqua vero multa et varia oratione defendunt, quae sunt item duo, unum:  'quae videantur, eorum alia vera esse, alia falsa,' alterum: 'omne visum,  quod sit a vero, tale esse, quale etiam a falso possit esse.' 42. Haec duo  proposita non praetervolant, sed ita dilatant, ut non mediocrem curam  adhibeant et diligentiam. Dividunt enim in partis et eas quidem magnas:  primum in sensus, deinde in ea, quae ducuntur a sensibus et ab omni  consuetudine, quam obscurari volunt. Tum perveniunt ad eam partem, ut ne  ratione quidem et coniectura ulla res percipi possit. Haec autem universa  concidunt etiam minutius. Ut enim de sensibus hesterno sermone vidistis,  item faciunt de reliquis, in singulisque rebus, quas in minima dispertiunt,  volunt efficere iis omnibus, quae visa sint, veris adiuncta esse falsa,  quae a veris nihil differant: ea cum talia sint, non posse comprehendi.    XIV. 43. Hanc ego subtilitatem philosophia quidem dignissimam iudico, sed  ab eorum causa, qui ita disserunt, remotissimam. Definitiones enim et  partitiones et horum luminibus utens oratio, tum similitudines  dissimilitudinesque et earum tenuis et acuta distinctio fidentium est  hominum illa vera et firma et certa esse quae tutentur, non eorum qui  clament nihilo magis vera illa esse quam falsa. Quid enim agant, si, cum  aliquid definierint, roget eos quispiam, num illa definitio possit in aliam  rem transferri quamlubet? Si posse dixerint, quid dicere habeant cur illa  vera definitio sit? si_n_ negaverint, fatendum sit, quoniam vel illa vera  definitio transferri non possit in falsum, quod ea definitione explicetur,  id percipi posse: quod minime illi volunt. Eadem dici poterunt in omnibus  partibus. 44. Si enim dicent ea, de quibus disserent, se dilucide  perspicere nec ulla communione visorum impediri, comprehendere ea se  fatebuntur. Sin autem negabunt vera visa a falsis posse distingui, qui  poterunt longius progredi? Occurretur enim, sicut occursum est. Nam  concludi argumentum non potest nisi iis, quae"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14977"],[0,"The Red Record (#18)"],[1," would have the English public believe her to be,    why was she silent when five minutes were given me to speak last June at    Princes' Hall, and in Holborn Town Hall this May? I should say it was as    President of the Women's Christian Temperance Union of America she is    timid, because all these unions in the South emphasize the hatred of the    Negro by excluding him. There is not a single colored woman admitted to    the Southern W.C.T.U., but still Miss Willard blames the Negro for the    defeat of Prohibition in the South. Miss Willard quotes from    _Fraternity_, but forgets to add my immediate recognition of her    presence on the platform at Holborn Town Hall, when, amidst many other    resolutions on temperance and other subjects in which she is interested,    time was granted to carry an anti-lynching resolution. I was so thankful    for this crumb of her speechless presence that I hurried off to the    editor of _Fraternity_ and added a postscript to my article blazoning    forth that fact.      Any statements I have made concerning Miss Willard are confirmed by the    Hon. Frederick Douglass (late United States minister to Hayti) in a    speech delivered by him in Washington in January of this year, which has    since been published in a pamphlet. The fact is, Miss Willard is no    better or worse than the great bulk of white Americans on the Negro    questions. They are all afraid to speak out, and it is only British    public opinion which will move them, as I am thankful to see it has    already begun to move Miss Willard. I am, etc.,      May 21      IDA B. WELLS    Unable to deny the truth of these assertions, the charge has been made  that I have attacked Miss Willard and misrepresented the W.C.T.U. If to  state facts is misrepresentation, then I plead guilty to the charge.    I said then and repeat now, that in all the ten terrible years of  shooting, hanging and burning of men, women and children in America, the  Women's Christian Temperance Union never suggested one plan or made one  move to prevent those awful crimes. If this statement is untrue the  records of that organization would disprove it before the ink is dry. It  is clearly an issue of fact and in all fairness this charge of  misrepresentation should either be substantiated or withdrawn.    It is not necessary, however, to make any representation concerning the  W.C.T.U. and the lynching question. The record of that organization speaks  for itself. During all the years prior to the agitation begun against  Lynch Law, in which years men, women and children were scourged, hanged,  shot and burned, the W.C.T.U. had no word, either of pity or protest; its  great heart, which concerns itself about humanity the world over, was,  toward our cause, pulseless as a stone. Let those who deny this speak by  the record. Not until after the first British campaign, in 1893, was even  a resolution passed by the body which is the self-constituted guardian for  \"God, home and native land.\"    Nor need we go back to other years. The annual session of that  organization held in Cleveland in November, 1894, made a record which  confirms and emphasizes the silence charged against it. At that session,  earnest efforts were made to secure the adoption of a resolution of  protest against lynching. At that very time two men were being tried for  the murder of six colored men who were arrested on charge of barn burning,  chained together, and on pretense of being taken to jail, were driven into  the woods where they were ambushed and all six shot to death. The six  widows of the butchered men had just finished the most pathetic recital  ever heard in any court room, and the mute appeal of twenty-seven orphans  for justice touched the stoutest hearts. Only two weeks prior to the  session, Gov. Jones of Alabama, in his last message to the retiring state  legislature, cited the fact that in the two years just past, nine colored  men had been taken from the legal authorities by lynching mobs and  butchered in cold blood--and not one of these victims was even charged  with an assault upon womanhood.    It was thought that this great organization, in face of these facts, would  not hesitate to place itself on record in a resolution of protest against  this awful brutality towards colored people. Miss Willard gave assurance  that such a resolution would be adopted, and that assurance was relied on.  The record of the session shows in what good faith that assurance was  kept. After recommending an expression against Lynch Law, the President  attacked the antilynching movement, deliberately misrepresenting my  position, and in her annual address, charging me with a statement I never  made.    Further than that, when the committee on resolutions reported their work,  not a word was said against lynching. In the interest of the cause I  smothered the resentment. I felt because of the unwarranted and unjust  attack of the President, and labored with members to secure an expression  of some kind, tending to abate the awful slaughter of my race. A  resolution against lynching was introduced by Mrs. Fessenden and read, and  then that great Christian body, which in its resolutions had expressed  itself in opposition to the social amusement of card playing, athletic  sports and promiscuous dancing; had protested against the licensing of  saloons, inveighed against tobacco, pledged its allegiance to the  Prohibition party, and thanked the Populist party in Kansas, the  Republican party in California and the Democratic party in the South,  wholly ignored the seven millions of colored people of this country whose  plea was for a word of sympathy and support for the movement in their  behalf. The resolution was not adopted, and the convention adjourned.    In the _Union Signal_ Dec. 6, 1894, among the resolutions is found this  one:      Resolved, That the National W.C.T.U, which has for years counted among    its departments that of peace and arbitration, is utterly opposed to all    lawless acts in any and all parts of our common lands and it urges these    principles upon the public, praying that the time may speedily come    when no human being shall be condemned without due process of law; and    when the unspeakable outrages which have so often provoked such    lawlessness shall be banished from the world, and childhood, maidenhood    and womanhood shall no more be the victims of atrocities worse than    death.    This is not the resolution offered by Mrs. Fessenden. She offered the one  passed last year by the W.C.T.U. which was a strong unequivocal  denunciation of lynching. But she was told by the chairman of the  committee on resolutions, Mrs. Rounds, that there was already a lynching  resolution in the hands of the committee. Mrs. Fessenden yielded the floor  on that assurance, and no resolution of any kind against lynching was  submitted and none was voted upon, not even the one above, taken from the  columns of the _Union Signal_, the organ of the national W.C.T.U!    Even the wording of this resolution which was printed by the W.C.T.U.,  reiterates the false and unjust charge which has been so often made as an  excuse for lynchers. Statistics show that less than one-third of the  lynching victims are hanged, shot and burned alive for \"unspeakable  outrages against womanhood, maidenhood and childhood;\" and that nearly a  thousand, including women and children, have been lynched upon any pretext  whatsoever; and that all have met death upon the unsupported word of white  men and women. Despite these facts this resolution which was printed,  cloaks an apology for lawlessness, in the same paragraph which affects to  condemn it, where it speaks of \"the unspeakable outrages which have so  often provoked such lawlessness.\"    Miss Willard told me the day before the resolutions were offered that the  Southern women present had held a caucus that day. This was after I, as  fraternal delegate from the Woman's Mite Missionary Society of the A.M.E.  Church at Cleveland, O., had been introduced to tender its greetings. In  so doing I expressed the hope of the colored women that the W.C.T.U. would  place itself on record as opposed to lynching which robbed them of  husbands, fathers, brothers and sons and in many cases of women as well.  No note was made either in the daily papers or the _Union Signal_ of that  introduction and greeting, although every other incident of that morning  was published. The failure to submit a lynching resolution and the wording  of the one above appears to have been the result of that Southern caucus.    On the same day I had a private talk with Miss Willard and told her she  had been unjust to me and the cause in her annual address, and asked that  she correct the statement that I had misrepresented the W.C.T.U, or that I  had \"put an imputation on one-half the white race in this country.\" She  said that somebody in England told her it was a pity that I attacked the  white women of America. \"Oh,\" said I, \"then you went out of your way to  prejudice me and my cause in your annual address, not upon what you had  heard me say, but what somebody had told you I said?\" Her reply was that I  must not blame her for her rhetorical expressions--that I had my way of  expressing things and she had hers. I told her I most assuredly did blame  her when those expressions were calculated to do such harm. I waited for  an honest an unequivocal retraction of her statements based on \"hearsay.\"  Not a word of retraction or explanation was said in the convention and I  remained misrepresented before that body through her connivance and  consent.    The editorial notes in the _Union Signal_, Dec. 6, 1894, however, contains  the following:      In her repudiation of the charges brought by Miss Ida Wells against    white women as having taken the initiative in nameless crimes between    the races, Miss Willard said in her annual address that this statement    \"pu"]]]
