[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15240"],[0,"A Journal of a Tour in the Congo Free State (#18)"],[1," At length smooth  water is reached and on we go quietly for an hour or two, when another  rapid is reached and the struggle commences again. The work is intensely  hard and dangerous, but the Sangos are expert boatmen and seem anxious  to finish their task as soon as possible. In rough water or smooth, the  crews race along, singing, shouting and encouraging each other to make  one more effort. After an exciting and tiring day we reach a village and  having seen the crews rationed, pitch our tents.    On again at 6.30. a.m. in a heavy river mist which however, is soon  dispersed as the sun rises. The rapids, which at first had the  excitement of novelty, began to pall for it was tiresome not being able  to read or sleep without being disturbed by the possibility of a bath in  a current running, at the rate of perhaps fifteen miles an hour, between  rocks. Towards sunset we reach the site of Bokanda, a village now  deserted, for some years ago the Chief with his people migrated across  the river to the French side. We decide therefore, to sleep in the new  village and proceed to cross, but are still in mid stream when we see  the majority of the people running away into the forest behind, the  women gathering up their children and household utensils, while the men  followed more leisurely. The Chief however, and a few braves appear on  the beach with guns and for a moment it looks as though they mean  mischief. They evidently however think better of it, for we land  unmolested and send interpreters to say we are hunters and only desire a  place for our camp and food for our men. The Chief at once advances and  gives us chickens and eggs while the soldiers pitch the tents in the  square of the village.    On again at daybreak, the journey being still more tiring, for it is  impossible to force the canoes heavily laden up some of the cataracts.  We have therefore to land three times and while the baggage is carried  along the bank, the empty canoes are hauled up with ropes. At length the  elephant rapids are safely negotiated and an hour or two afterwards  Mokoangai is reached but in three long days' hard work, we have ascended  only about thirty miles of the river.    At Mokoangai is a large plantation and farm and well built houses for  the one or two white men who live there. Next day I start before  daybreak hunting. The country is open and hilly, covered generally with  grass eight or ten feet high. Still there are many places where the  ground is almost bare and it is an ideal spot for stalking game. After  walking a few miles in a mist, we see several antelopes and endeavour to  stalk them. While still nearly a hundred yards away, they commence to  walk slowly towards cover but it is possible to get a fair side shot and  one falls heavily hit in the shoulder. Soon after an elephant suddenly  appears about two hundred yards ahead walking along the crest of a hill.  Sending the native hunter to pick up the antelope, Chikaia and I follow  the elephant's spoor for some hours, but do not come up with it or find  other game. We were now high up on the range of hills behind Mokoangai  and the view was magnificent. The great river could be seen winding its  way between the hills covered with the vivid greens only to be found in  damp tropical countries. Otherwise the picture somewhat recalled  central Wales with a Wye magnified a hundred times. Chikaia had walked a  long way carrying a heavy rifle, and now showed signs of fatigue so he  was encouraged by being allowed to shoot a monkey on the way home.    Next day being Sunday, we rest quietly in the Post and prepare to leave  next morning in the _Aia_ which is one of the first launches Stanley  took to Africa and is therefore, somewhat ancient. Since she is too  small to carry much baggage, she tows a large open iron boat nearly the  same size alongside. In this the camp is slowed and the boys and  soldiers take their places sitting on the bales and cases, and we make a  start on Monday September 19th for Banzyville. Fortunately there are no  rapids in this stretch of the river and it is at least possible to stand  up comfortably in the launch, whereas in the canoes, it was necessary to  sit still in a long hammock chair for practically twelve hours each day.    The people and villages now change much in appearance for the huts are  shaped like beehives and are made of frameworks of wood covered with  grass. The entrance is only about three feet high and the dome of the  roof perhaps four times that height. In some of them a kind of platform  is erected which seems to be an attempt to make a two storey building of  the hut. The women are here either quite nude or wear a small piece of  cloth or grass below the waist; the men however all have a loin cloth.  All the people seem to be of fine physique and the proportion of  children is abnormally high. The first night we stop at a trading post  of the Dutch Company on the French side of the river and are hospitably  received by the agents there.    Next day we reach the Catholic Mission of Sainte Famille also on French  territory. The Fathers have laid out a large plantation and farm;  horses, cattle, sheep, goats and poultry all doing well. Indeed modern  American ploughs and carts give the farm quite a home-like appearance.  Maize, oranges, bananas, pineapples and many vegetables are here in  abundance. Sleeping Sickness is not known, which immunity is attributed  by the priests to the fact that the natives have plenty of fresh meat  and eat little kwanga. Apparently the disease is due to a bacillus. It  is however, at least possible that the new diet of the civilised native  may be a predisposing factor. The savage is naturally carnivorous and  before the advent of the white man, had little to eat but animal flesh.  Now his chief article of diet in the western parts of the Congo is  kwanga, which consists chiefly of starch, and he has only a little meat  and fish. Along the Congo where the native is civilised, there is much  sleeping sickness, but along the Ubangi where he is more savage, there  is practically none. The Fathers give us some spirits distilled from the  papye and pineapple which are very good and beer made from maize which  is not. They then show us round the grounds and before we leave load us  with eggs and fresh vegetables which are very acceptable. At sunset we  tie up to the bank and make a camp. It is wonderful how quickly the  grass is cut down, the tents erected, fires lighted and dinner cooked,  for when the native knows he has to perform a certain definite task, he  works hard, so that he can eat his dinner and get to sleep as soon as  possible. Chikaia apparently has a fine sense of satire or humour. A  table was broken and when I asked how it was done, Chikaia instead of  answering \"it has been done a long time\" as an European servant would,  went one better and said \"it has always been like that.\" \"I suppose it  was made so,\" I replied. \"Yes, Sir\" was the answer and there was no more  to be said.    The banks of the river are here lined with villages and each time we  stop crowds run to see the steamer, while the Chief comes on board,  shakes hands solemnly and presents eggs, chicken or a goat. In return we  hand back a good value in cloth, beads or salt. Mitakos are not seen  here at all, for beads are used instead. The natives always seemed  grateful and satisfied with their presents, which was rarely the case on  the Congo where the people generally grumble even when they receive many  times the value of the article they sell. We camp at the village of Dru,  where we find it very difficult to pitch tents owing to the rocky nature  of the soil.    On September 22nd we reach the Kuangu river where is situated the chief  post of a French Trading Company. The buildings are as usual of bricks,  the mortar being made of the shells of river oysters and sand. Soon  after our arrival, a poor native was brought in whose hand had been  terribly mangled in a circular saw. We dressed it as carefully as  possible and fixed it on a splint until he could reach a post with a  hospital. In the night however, weird chanting was heard and next day we  discovered that his friends had been exorcising the evil spirits--i.e.  the perchloride of mercury in which the hand had been washed--had torn  off all the bandages and sent the boy a way in a canoe to avoid the  white medicine man. The hand will almost certainly fall off and the  further history of the boy will perhaps be interesting. One of the  traders, Mr. Constantine, a Swiss, said he had been stationed in the  interior and had heard no news since January. We are only able to bring  him up to June, three months behind date. This gentleman has had an  interesting career. He fought for England in the Matabele war and then  settled in the Orange Free State where he was commandeered by Cronje and  forced into the trenches at Magersfontein, but to his own great  satisfaction was soon taken prisoner by the British and was very well  treated. He now lives absolutely alone, without a guard of any sort,  some days' journey from the river and feels quite safe, for the natives  here look upon a white man as a protection from the Arabs. This Company  trades in rubber with the natives, paying in beads at the rate of 40  centimes a kilogramme. It is therefore, unlikely that many natives  migrate to the French Congo where they receive no more pay for their  work than in the State, and are besides taxed. The country behind the  station is flat veldt and only a few small elephants are occasionally  found. The usual heavy tornado bursts in the afternoon nearly filling  the launch and boat with water in a very short time. Having bought some  wine and other stores, from the Company we next day continue up the  river past many villages all densely populated. The architecture has  again changed, the huts now being tent shaped and rising to a point in  the centre which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15250"],[0,"Myths and Legends of China (#18)"],[1," bones of an Immortal, and wished to  marry him.    Ma P'o, her neighbour, introduced him one day into the Crystal  Palace for an interview with his future wife. The Princess gave him  the choice of three careers: to live in the Dragon Prince's Palace,  with the guarantee of immortal life, to enjoy immortality among the  people on the earth, or to have the honour of becoming a minister of  the Empire. Lu Ch'i first answered that he would like to live in the  Crystal Palace. The young lady, overjoyed, said to him: \"I am Princess  T'ai Yin. I will at once inform Shang Ti, the Supreme Ruler.\" A moment  later the arrival of a celestial messenger was announced. Two officers  bearing flags preceded him and conducted him to the foot of the flight  of steps. He then presented himself as Chu I, the envoy of Shang Ti.    Addressing himself to Lu Ch'i, he asked: \"Do you wish to live in the  Crystal Palace?\" The latter did not reply. T'ai Yin urged him to give  his answer, but he persisted in keeping silent. The Princess in despair  retired to her apartment, and brought out five pieces of precious  cloth, which she presented to the divine envoy, begging him to have  patience a little longer and wait for the answer. After some time,  Chu I repeated his question. Then Lu Ch'i in a firm voice answered:  \"I have consecrated my life to the hard labour of study, and wish to  attain to the dignity of minister on this earth.\"    T'ai Yin ordered Ma P'o to conduct Lu Ch'i from the palace. From that  day his face became transformed: he acquired the lips of a dragon,  the head of a panther, the green face of an Immortal, etc. He took  his degree, and was promoted to be Director of the Censorate. The  Emperor, appreciating the good sense shown in his advice, appointed  him a minister of the Empire.    From this legend it would seem that Chu I is the purveyor of official  posts; however, in practice, he is more generally regarded as the  protector of weak candidates, as the God of Good Luck for those who  present themselves at the examinations with a somewhat light equipment  of literary knowledge. The special legend relating to this _role_  is known everywhere in China. It is as follows:      Mr Redcoat nods his Head    An examiner, engaged in correcting the essays of the candidates,  after a superficial scrutiny of one of the essays, put it on one  side as manifestly inferior, being quite determined not to pass the  candidate who had composed it. The essay, moved by some mysterious  power, was replaced in front of his eyes, as if to invite him to  examine it more attentively. At the same time a reverend old man,  clothed in a red garment, suddenly appeared before him, and by a nod  of his head gave him to understand that he should pass the essay. The  examiner, surprised at the novelty of the incident, and fortified by  the approval of his supernatural visitor, admitted the author of the  essay to the literary degree.    Chu I, like K'uei Hsing, is invoked by the _literati_ as a powerful  protector and aid to success. When anyone with but a poor chance of  passing presents himself at an examination, his friends encourage  him by the popular saying: \"Who knows but that Mr Redcoat will nod  his head?\"      Mr Golden Cuirass    Chu I is sometimes accompanied by another personage, named Chin Chia,  'Mr Golden Cuirass.' Like K'uei Hsing and Chu I he has charge of the  interests of scholars, but differs from them in that he holds a flag,  which he has only to wave in front of a house for the family inhabiting  it to be assured that among their descendants will be some who will  win literary honours and be promoted to high offices under the State.    Though Chin Chia is the protector of scholars, he is also the  redoubtable avenger of their evil actions: his flag is saluted as a  good omen, but his sword is the terror of the wicked.      The God of War    Still another patron deity of literature is the God of War. \"How,\"  it may be asked, \"can so peaceful a people as the Chinese put so  peaceful an occupation as literature under the patronage of so warlike  a deity as the God of War?\" But that question betrays ignorance of the  character of the Chinese Kuan Ti. He is not a cruel tyrant delighting  in battle and the slaying of enemies: he is the god who can _avert  war and protect the people from its horrors_.    A youth, whose name was originally Chang-sheng, afterward changed to  Shou-chang, and then to Yuen-chang, who was born near Chieh Liang,  in Ho Tung (now the town of Chieh Chou in Shansi), and was of an  intractable nature, having exasperated his parents, was shut up in a  room from which he escaped by breaking through the window. In one of  the neighbouring houses he heard a young lady and an old man weeping  and lamenting. Running to the foot of the wall of the compound, he  inquired the reason of their grief. The old man replied that though  his daughter was already engaged, the uncle of the local official,  smitten by her beauty, wished to make her his concubine. His petitions  to the official had only been rejected with curses.    Beside himself with rage, the youth seized a sword and went and killed  both the official and his uncle. He escaped through the T'ung Kuan, the  pass to Shensi. Having with difficulty avoided capture by the barrier  officials, he knelt down at the side of a brook to wash his face;  when lo! his appearance was completely transformed. His complexion  had become reddish-grey, and he was absolutely unrecognizable. He  then presented himself with assurance before the officers, who asked  him his name. \"My name is Kuan,\" he replied. It was by that name that  he was thereafter known.      The Meat-seller's Challenge    One day he arrived at Chu-chou, a dependent sub-prefecture of Peking,  in Chihli. There Chang Fei, a butcher, who had been selling his meat  all the morning, at noon lowered what remained into a well, placed  over the mouth of the well a stone weighing twenty-five pounds, and  said with a sneer: \"If anyone can lift that stone and take my meat,  I will make him a present of it!\" Kuan Yue, going up to the edge of  the well, lifted the stone with the same ease as he would a tile,  took the meat, and made off. Chang Fei pursued him, and eventually  the two came to blows, but no one dared to separate them. Just then  Liu Pei, a hawker of straw shoes, arrived, interposed, and put a stop  to the fight. The community of ideas which they found they possessed  soon gave rise to a firm friendship between the three men.      The Oath in the Peach-orchard    Another account represents Liu Pei and Chang Fei as having entered  a village inn to drink wine, when a man of gigantic stature pushing  a wheelbarrow stopped at the door to rest. As he seated himself,  he hailed the waiter, saying: \"Bring me some wine quickly, because  I have to hasten to reach the town to enlist in the army.\"    Liu Pei looked at this man, nine feet in height, with a beard two feet  long. His face was the colour of the fruit of the jujube-tree, and  his lips carmine. Eyebrows like sleeping silkworms shaded his phoenix  eyes, which were a scarlet red. Terrible indeed was his bearing.    \"What is your name?\" asked Liu Pei. \"My family name is Kuan, my own  name is Yue, my surname Yuen Chang,\" he replied. \"I am from the Ho Tung  country. For the last five or six years I have been wandering about  the world as a fugitive, to escape from my pursuers, because I killed  a powerful man of my country who was oppressing the poor people. I  hear that they are collecting a body of troops to crush the brigands,  and I should like to join the expedition.\"    Chang Fei, also named Chang I Te, is described as eight feet in  height, with round shining eyes in a panther's head, and a pointed  chin bristling with a tiger's beard. His voice resembled the rumbling  of thunder. His ardour was like that of a fiery steed. He was a native  of Cho Chuen, where he possessed some fertile farms, and was a butcher  and wine-merchant.    Liu Pei, surnamed Hsuean Te, otherwise Hsien Chu, was the third member  of the group.    The three men went to Chang Fei's farm, and on the morrow met together  in his peach-orchard, and sealed their friendship with an oath. Having  procured a black ox and a white horse, with the various accessories  to a sacrifice, they immolated the victims, burnt the incense of  friendship, and after twice prostrating themselves took this oath:    \"We three, Liu Pei, Kuan Yu, and Chang Fei, already united by mutual  friendship, although belonging to different clans, now bind ourselves  by the union of our hearts, and join our forces in order to help each  other in times of danger.    \"We wish to pay to the State our debt of loyal citizens and give peace  to our black-haired compatriots. We do not inquire if we were born  in the same year, the same month, or on the same day, but we desire  only that the same year, the same month, and the same day may find us  united in death. May Heaven our King and Earth our Queen see clearly  our hearts! If any one of us violate justice or forget benefits,  may Heaven and Man unite to punish him!\"    The oath having been formally taken, Liu Pei was saluted as elder  brother, Kuan Yue as the second, and Chang Fei as the youngest. Their  sacrifice to Heaven and earth ended, they killed an ox and served  a feast, to which the soldiers of the district were invited to the  number of three hundred or more. They all drank copiously until they  were intoxicated. Liu Pei enrolled the peasants; Chang Fei procured  for them horses and arms; and then they set out to make war on the  Yellow Turbans (Huang Chin Tsei). Kuan Yue proved himself worthy  of the affection which Liu Pei showed him; brave and generous, he  never turned aside from danger. His fidelity was shown especially  on one occasion when, having been taken prisoner by Ts'ao Ts'ao,  together with two of Liu Pei's wives, and having been allotted a common"]]]
