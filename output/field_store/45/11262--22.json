Mirsky,\" I said, 'with a confidential  letter----'    \"'Oh, yas, yas,' he answered hastily; 'I know--I know. Excuse me one  minute.' And he rushed off down-stairs with his parcel.    \"Here was a noble chance. For a moment I thought of following him, in case  there might be something interesting in the parcel. But I had to decide in  a moment, and I decided on trying the room. I slipped inside the door,  and, finding the key on the inside, locked it. It was a confused sort of  room, with a little iron bedstead in one corner and a sort of rough  boarded inclosure in another. This I rightly conjectured to be the  photographic dark-room, and made for it at once.    \"There was plenty of light within when the door was left open, and I made  at once for the drying-rack that was fastened over the sink. There were a  number of negatives in it, and I began hastily examining them one after  another. In the middle of this our friend Mirsky returned and tried the  door. He rattled violently at the handle and pushed. Then he called.    \"At this moment I had come upon the first of the negatives you have just  smashed. The fixing and washing had evidently only lately been completed,  and the negative was drying on the rack. I seized it, of course, and the  others which stood by it.    \"'Who are you, there, inside?' Mirsky shouted indignantly from the  landing. 'Why for you go in my room like that? Open this door at once, or  I call the police!'    \"I took no notice. I had got the full number of negatives, one for each  drawing, but I was not by any means sure that he had not taken an extra  set; so I went on hunting down the rack. There were no more, so I set to  work to turn out all the undeveloped plates. It was quite possible, you  see, that the other set, if it existed, had not yet been developed.    \"Mirsky changed his tune. After a little more banging and shouting I could  hear him kneel down and try the key-hole. I had left the key there, so  that he could see nothing. But he began talking softly and rapidly through  the hole in a foreign language. I did not know it in the least, but I  believe it was Russian. What had led him to believe I understood Russian I  could not at the time imagine, though I have a notion now. I went on  ruining his stock of plates. I found several boxes, apparently of new  plates, but, as there was no means of telling whether they were really  unused or were merely undeveloped, but with the chemical impress of your  drawings on them, I dragged every one ruthlessly from its hiding-place and  laid it out in the full glare of the sunlight--destroying it thereby, of  course, whether it was unused or not.    \"Mirsky left off talking, and I heard him quietly sneaking off. Perhaps  his conscience was not sufficiently clear to warrant an appeal to the  police, but it seemed to me rather probable at the time that that was what  he was going for. So I hurried on with my work. I found three dark  slides--the parts that carried the plates in the back of the camera, you  know--one of them fixed in the camera itself. These I opened, and exposed  the plates to ruination as before. I suppose nobody ever did so much  devastation in a photographic studio in ten minutes as I managed.    \"I had spoiled every plate I could find, and had the developed negatives  safely in my pocket, when I happened to glance at a porcelain washing-well  under the sink. There was one negative in that, and I took it up. It was  _not_ a negative of a drawing of yours, but of a Russian twenty-ruble  note!\"    This _was_ a discovery. The only possible reason any man could have for  photographing a bank-note was the manufacture of an etched plate for the  production of forged copies. I was almost as pleased as I had been at the  discovery of _your_ negatives. He might bring the police now as soon as he  liked; I could turn the tables on him completely. I began to hunt about  for anything else relating to this negative.    \"I found an inking-roller, some old pieces of blanket (used in printing  from plates), and in a corner on the floor, heaped over with newspapers  and rubbish, a small copying-press. There was also a dish of acid, but not  an etched plate or a printed note to be seen. I was looking at the press,  with the negative in one hand and the inking-roller in the other, when I  became conscious of a shadow across the window. I looked up quickly, and  there was Mirsky hanging over from some ledge or projection to the side of  the window, and staring straight at me, with a look of unmistakable terror  and apprehension.    \"The face vanished immediately. I had to move a table to get at the  window, and by the time I had opened it there was no sign or sound of the  rightful tenant of the room. I had no doubt now of his reason for carrying  a parcel down-stairs. He probably mistook me for another visitor he was  expecting, and, knowing he must take this visitor into his room, threw the  papers and rubbish over the press, and put up his plates and papers in a  bundle and secreted them somewhere down-stairs, lest his occupation should  be observed.    \"Plainly, my duty now was to communicate with the police. So, by the help  of my friend the barber down-stairs, a messenger was found and a note sent  over to Scotland Yard. I awaited, of course, for the arrival of the  police, and occupied the interval in another look round--finding nothing  important, however. When the official detective arrived, he recognized at  once the importance of the case. A large number of forged Russian notes  have been put into circulation on the Continent lately, it seems, and it  was suspected that they came from London. The Russian Government have been  sending urgent messages to the police here on the subject.    \"Of course I said nothing about your business; but, while I was talking  with the Scotland Yard man, a letter was left by a messenger, addressed to  Mirsky. The letter will be examined, of course, by the proper authorities,  but I was not a little interested to perceive that the envelope bore the  Russian imperial arms above the words 'Russian Embassy.' Now, why should  Mirsky communicate with the Russian Embassy? Certainly not to let the  officials know that he was carrying on a very extensive and lucrative  business in the manufacture of spurious Russian notes. I think it is  rather more than possible that he wrote--probably before he actually got  your drawings--to say that he could sell information of the highest  importance, and that this letter was a reply. Further, I think it quite  possible that, when I asked for him by his Russian name and spoke of 'a  confidential letter,' he at once concluded that _I_ had come from the  embassy in answer to his letter. That would account for his addressing me  in Russian through the key-hole; and, of course, an official from the  Russian Embassy would be the very last person in the world whom he would  like to observe any indications of his little etching experiments. But,  anyhow, be that as it may,\" Hewitt concluded, \"your drawings are safe now,  and if once Mirsky is caught, and I think it likely, for a man in his  shirt-sleeves, with scarcely any start, and, perhaps, no money about him,  hasn't a great chance to get away--if he is caught, I say, he will  probably get something handsome at St. Petersburg in the way of  imprisonment, or Siberia, or what not; so that you will be amply avenged.\"    \"Yes, but I don't at all understand this business of the drawings even  now. How in the world were they taken out of the place, and how in the  world did you find it out?\"    \"Nothing could be simpler; and yet the plan was rather ingenious. I'll  tell you exactly how the thing revealed itself to me. From your original  description of the case many people would consider that an impossibility  had been performed. Nobody had gone out and nobody had come in, and yet  the drawings had been taken away. But an impossibility is an  impossibility, after all, and as drawings don't run away of themselves,  plainly somebody had taken them, unaccountable as it might seem. Now, as  they were in your inner office, the only people who could have got at them  besides yourself were your assistants, so that it was pretty clear that  one of them, at least, had something to do with the business. You told me  that Worsfold was an excellent and intelligent draughtsman. Well, if such  a man as that meditated treachery, he would probably be able to carry away  the design in his head--at any rate, a little at a time--and would be  under no necessity to run the risk of stealing a set of the drawings. But  Ritter, you remarked, was an inferior sort of man. 'Not particularly  smart,' I think, were your words--only a mechanical sort of tracer. _He_  would be unlikely to be able to carry in his head the complicated details  of such designs as yours, and, being in a subordinate position, and  continually overlooked, he would find it impossible to make copies of the  plans in the office. So that, to begin with, I thought I saw the most  probable path to start on.    \"When I looked round the rooms, I pushed open the glass door of the  barrier and left the door to the inner office ajar, in order to be able to  see any thing that _might_ happen in any part of the place, without  actually expecting any definite development. While we were talking, as it  happened, our friend Mirsky (or Hunter--as you please) came into the outer  office, and my attention was instantly called to him by the first thing he  did. Did you notice anything peculiar yourself?\"    \"No, really, I can't say I did. He seemed to behave much as any traveler  or agent might.\"    \"Well, what I noticed was the fact that as soon as he entered the place he  put his walking-stick into the umbrella-stand over there by the door,  close by where he stood, a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11255"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#18)"],[1,"  \"I heard my mother talk about their dances and frolics then.

I don't know nothing about slavery. I was too young  to remember anything about slavery. But I tell you this much, times  ain't like they used to be. There was easy living back in the 18 hundred  years. People wore homemade clothes, what I mean homespun and lowell  clothes. My ma spun and weaved all of her cloth. We wore our dresses  down to our ankles in length and my dresses was called mother hubbards.  The skirts had about three yards circumference and we wore plenty of  clothes under our dress. We did not go necked like these folks do now.  Folk did not know how we was made. We did not show our shape, we did not  disgrace ourself back in 1800. We wore our hair wrapped and head rags  tied on our head. I went barefooted until I was a young missie then I  wore shoes in the winter but I still went barefooted in the summer. My  papa was a shoemaker so he made our shoes. We raised everything that we  ate when I was a chap. We ate a plenty. We raised plenty of whippowell  peas. That was the only kind of peas there was then. We raised plenty  Moodie sweet potatoes they call them nigger chokers now. We had cows so  we had plenty of milk and butter. We cooked on the fireplace. The first  stove I cooked on was a white woman's stove, that was 1890.    I never chanced to go to school because where we lived there wasn't no  school. I worked all of the time. In fact that was all we knew. White  people did not see where negroes needed any learning so we had to work.  We lived on a place with some white people by the name of Dunn. They  were good people but they taken all that was made because we did not  know. I ain't never been sick in my life and I have never had a doctor  in my life. I am in good health now.    We traveled horseback in the years of 1800. We did not ride straddle the  horse's back we rode sideways. The old folks wore their dreses dragging  the ground. We chaps called everybody old that married. We respected  them because they was considered as being old. Time has made a change.      --Dina Beard, Douglas Addition.
