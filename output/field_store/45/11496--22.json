The political parties meet in  numerous conventions; the greater the concourse, and with each new  uproar of announcement, The delegation from Essex![276] The Democrats  from New Hampshire! The Whigs of Maine! the young patriot feels  himself stronger than before by a new thousand of eyes and arms. In  like manner the reformers summon conventions, and vote and resolve in  multitude. Not so, O friends! will the god deign to enter and inhabit  you, but by a method precisely the reverse. It is only as a man puts  off all foreign support, and stands alone, that I see him to be strong  and to prevail. He is weaker by every recruit to his banner. Is not a  man better than a town? Ask nothing of men, and in the endless  mutation, thou only firm column must presently appear the upholder of  all that surrounds thee. He who knows that power is inborn, that he is  weak because he has looked for good out of him and elsewhere, and so  perceiving, throws himself unhesitatingly on his thought, instantly  rights himself, stands in the erect position, commands his limbs,  works miracles; just as a man who stands on his feet is stronger than  a man who stands on his head.    So use all that is called Fortune.[277] Most men gamble with her, and  gain all, and lose all, as her wheel rolls. But do thou leave as  unlawful these winnings, and deal with Cause and Effect, the  chancelors of God. In the Will work and acquire, and thou hast chained  the wheel of Chance, and shalt sit hereafter out of fear from her  rotations. A political victory, a rise of rents, the recovery of your  sick, or the return of your absent friend, or some other favorable  event, raises your spirits, and you think good days are preparing for  you. Do not believe it. Nothing can bring you peace but yourself.  Nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles.          FRIENDSHIP.[278]      1. We have a great deal more kindness than is ever spoken. Barring all  the selfishness that chills like east winds the world, the whole human  family is bathed with an element of love like a fine ether. How many  persons we meet in houses, whom we scarcely speak to, whom yet we  honor, and who honor us! How many we see in the street, or sit with in  church, whom, though silently, we warmly rejoice to be with! Read the  language of these wandering eyebeams. The heart knoweth.    2. The effect of the indulgence of this human affection is a certain  cordial exhilaration. In poetry, and in common speech, the emotions of  benevolence and complacency which are felt toward others, are likened  to the material effects of fire; so swift, or much more swift, more  active, more cheering are these fine inward irradiations. From the  highest degree of passionate love, to the lowest degree of good will,  they make the sweetness of life.    3. Our intellectual and active powers increase with our affection. The  scholar sits down to write, and all his years of meditation do not  furnish him with one good thought or happy expression; but it is  necessary to write a letter to a friend, and, forthwith, troops of  gentle thoughts invest themselves, on every hand, with chosen words.  See in any house where virtue and self-respect abide, the palpitation  which the approach of a stranger causes. A commended stranger is  expected and announced, and an uneasiness between pleasure and pain  invades all the hearts of a household. His arrival almost brings fear  to the good hearts that would welcome him. The house is dusted, all  things fly into their places, the old coat is exchanged for the new,  and they must get up a dinner if they can. Of a commended stranger,  only the good report is told by others, only the good and new is heard  by us. He stands to us for humanity. He is, what we wish. Having  imagined and invested him, we ask how we should stand related in  conversation and action with such a man, and are uneasy with fear. The  same idea exalts conversation with him. We talk better than we are  wont. We have the nimblest fancy, a richer memory, and our dumb devil  has taken leave for the time. For long hours we can continue a series  of sincere, graceful, rich communications, drawn from the oldest,  secretest experience, so that they who sit by, of our own kinsfolk and  acquaintance, shall feel a lively surprise at our unusual powers. But  as soon as the stranger begins to intrude his partialities, his  definitions, his defects, into the conversation, it is all over. He  has heard the first, the last and best, he will ever hear from us. He  is no stranger now. Vulgarity, ignorance, misapprehension, are old  acquaintances. Now, when he comes, he may get the order, the dress,  and the dinner, but the throbbing of the heart, and the communications  of the soul, no more.    4. What is so pleasant as these jets of affection which relume[279] a  young world for me again? What is so delicious as a just and firm  encounter of two, in a thought, in a feeling? How beautiful, on their  approach to this beating heart, the steps and forms of the gifted and  the true! The moment we indulge our affections, the earth is  metamorphosed; there is no winter, and no night; all tragedies, all  ennuis vanish; all duties even; nothing fills the proceeding eternity  but the forms all radiant of beloved persons. Let the soul be assured  that somewhere in the universe it should rejoin its friend, and it  would be content and cheerful alone for a thousand years.    5. I awoke this morning with devout thanksgiving for my friends, the old  and the new. Shall I not call God, the Beautiful, who daily showeth  himself so to me in his gifts? I chide society, I embrace solitude, and  yet I am not so ungrateful as not to see the wise, the lovely, and the  noble-minded, as from time to time they pass my gate.[280] Who hears me,  who understands me, becomes mine,--a possession for all time. Nor is  nature so poor, but she gives me this joy several times, and thus we  weave social threads of our own, a new web of relations; and, as many  thoughts in succession substantiate themselves, we shall by-and-by stand  in a new world of our own creation, and no longer strangers and pilgrims  is a traditionary globe. My friends have come[281] to me unsought. The  great God gave them to me. By oldest right, by the divine affinity of  virtue with itself, I find them, or rather, not I, but the Deity in me  and in them, both deride and cancel the thick walls of individual  character, relation, age, sex and circumstance, at which he usually  connives, and now makes many one. High thanks I owe you, excellent  lovers, who carry out the world for me to new and noble depths, and  enlarge the meaning of all my thoughts. These are new poetry of the  first Bard[282]--poetry without stop--hymn, ode and epic,[283] poetry  still flowing, Apollo[284] and the Muses[285] chanting still. Will these  two separate themselves from me again, or some of them? I know not, but  I fear it not; for my relation to them is so pure, that we hold by  simple affinity, and the Genius[286] of my life being thus social, the  same affinity will exert its energy on whomsoever is as noble as these  men and women, wherever I may be.    6. I confess to an extreme tenderness of nature on this point. It is  almost dangerous to me to \"crush the sweet poison,[287] of misused  wine\" of the affections. A new person is to me a great event, and  hinders me from sleep. I have had such fine fancies lately about two  or three persons, as have given me delicious hours, but the joy ends  in the day: it yields no fruit. Thought is not born of it; my action  is very little modified. I must feel pride in my friend's  accomplishments as if they were mine, and a property in his virtues.  I feel as warmly when he is praised, as the lover when he hears  applause of his engaged maiden. We over-estimate the conscience of our  friend. His goodness seems better than our goodness, his nature finer,  his temptations less. Everything that is his,--his name, his form, his  dress, books and instruments,--fancy enhances. Our own thought sounds  new and larger from his mouth.    7. Yet the systole and diastole[288] of the heart are not without  their analogy in the ebb and flow of love. Friendship, like the  immortality[289] of the soul, is too good to be believed. The lover,  beholding his maiden, half knows that she is not verily that which he  worships; and in the golden hour of friendship, we are surprised with  shades of suspicion and unbelief. We doubt that we bestow on our hero  the virtues in which he shines, and afterward worship the form to  which we have ascribed this divine inhabitation. In strictness, the  soul does not respect men as it respects itself. In strict science,  all persons underlie the same condition of an infinite remoteness.  Shall we fear to cool our love by mining for the metaphysical  foundation of this Elysian temple?[290] Shall I not be as real as the  things I see? If I am, I shall not fear to know them for what they  are. Their essence is not less beautiful than their appearance, though  it needs finer organs for its apprehension. The root of the plant is  not unsightly to science, though for chaplets and festoons we cut the  stem short. And I must hazard the production of the bald fact amid  these pleasing reveries, though it should prove an Egyptian skull at  our banquet.[291] A man who stands united with his thought, conceives  magnificently to himself. He is conscious of a universal success,[292]  even though bought by uniform particular failures.

Adapa,  however, appeared in garments of mourning and was forgiven. Anu  offered him the water of life and the bread of life which would have  made him immortal, but Ea's son refused to eat or drink, believing, as  his father had warned him, that the sky god desired him to partake of  the bread of death and to drink of the water of death.    Another terrible atmospheric demon was the south-west wind, which  caused destructive storms and floods, and claimed many human victims  like the Icelandic \"corpse swallower\". She was depicted with lidless  staring eyes, broad flat nose, mouth gaping horribly, and showing  tusk-like teeth, and with high cheek bones, heavy eyebrows, and low  bulging forehead.    In Scotland the hag of the south-west wind is similarly a bloodthirsty  and fearsome demon. She is most virulent in the springtime. At  Cromarty she is quaintly called \"Gentle Annie\" by the fisher folks,  who repeat the saying: \"When Gentle Annie is skyawlan (yelling) roond  the heel of Ness (a promontory) wi' a white feather on her hat (the  foam of big billows) they (the spirits) will be harrying (robbing) the  crook\"--that is, the pot which hangs from the crook is empty during  the spring storms, which prevent fishermen going to sea. In England  the wind hag is Black Annis, who dwells in a Leicestershire hill cave.  She may be identical with the Irish hag Anu, associated with the \"Paps  of Anu\". According to Gaelic lore, this wind demon of spring is the  \"Cailleach\" (old wife). She gives her name in the Highland calendar to  the stormy period of late spring; she raises gale after gale to  prevent the coming of summer. Angerboda, the Icelandic hag, is also a  storm demon, but represents the east wind. A Tyrolese folk tale tells  of three magic maidens who dwelt on Jochgrimm mountain, where they  \"brewed the winds\". Their demon lovers were Ecke, \"he who causes  fear\"; Vasolt, \"he who causes dismay\"; and the scornful Dietrich in  his mythical character of Donar or Thunor (Thor), the thunderer.    Another Sumerian storm demon was the Zu bird, which is represented  among the stars by Pegasus and Taurus. A legend relates that this  \"worker of evil, who raised the head of evil\", once aspired to rule  the gods, and stole from Bel, \"the lord\" of deities, the Tablets of  Destiny, which gave him his power over the Universe as controller of  the fates of all. The Zu bird escaped with the Tablets and found  shelter on its mountain top in Arabia. Anu called on Ramman, the  thunderer, to attack the Zu bird, but he was afraid; other gods appear  to have shrunk from the conflict. How the rebel was overcome is not  certain, because the legend survives in fragmentary form. There is a  reference, however, to the moon god setting out towards the mountain  in Arabia with purpose to outwit the Zu bird and recover the lost  Tablets. How he fared it is impossible to ascertain. In another  legend--that of Etana--the mother serpent, addressing the sun god,  Shamash, says:        Thy net is like unto the broad earth;      Thy snare is like unto the distant heaven!      Who hath ever escaped from thy net?      Even Zu, the worker of evil, who raised the head          of evil [did not escape]!                _L.W. King's Translation._    In Indian mythology, Garuda, half giant, half eagle, robs the Amrita  (ambrosia) of the gods which gives them their power and renders them  immortal. It had assumed a golden body, bright as the sun. Indra, the  thunderer, flung his bolt in vain; he could not wound Garuda, and only  displaced a single feather. Afterwards, however, he stole the moon  goblet containing the Amrita, which Garuda had delivered to his  enemies, the serpents, to free his mother from bondage. This Indian  eagle giant became the vehicle of the god Vishnu, and, according to  the _Mahabharata_, \"mocked the wind with his fleetness\".    It would appear that the Babylonian Zu bird symbolized the summer  sandstorms from the Arabian desert. Thunder is associated with the  rainy season, and it may have been assumed, therefore, that the  thunder god was powerless against the sandstorm demon, who was chased,  however, by the moon, and finally overcome by the triumphant sun when  it broke through the darkening sand drift and brightened heaven and  earth, \"netting\" the rebellious demon who desired to establish the  rule of evil over gods and mankind.    In the \"Legend of Etana\" the Eagle, another demon which links with the  Indian Garuda, slayer of serpents, devours the brood of the Mother  Serpent. For this offence against divine law, Shamash, the sun god,  pronounces the Eagle's doom. He instructs the Mother Serpent to slay a  wild ox and conceal herself in its entrails. The Eagle comes to feed  on the carcass, unheeding the warning of one of his children, who  says, \"The serpent lies in this wild ox\":        He swooped down and stood upon the wild ox,      The Eagle ... examined the flesh;      He looked about carefully before and behind him;      He again examined the flesh;      He looked about carefully before and behind him,      Then, moving swiftly, he made for the hidden parts.      When he entered into the midst,      The serpent seized him by his wing.    In vain the Eagle appealed for mercy to the Mother Serpent, who was  compelled to execute the decree of Shamash; she tore off the Eagle's  pinions, wings, and claws, and threw him into a pit where he perished  from hunger and thirst.[100] This myth may refer to the ravages of a  winged demon of disease who was thwarted by the sacrifice of an ox.  The Mother Serpent appears to be identical with an ancient goddess of  maternity resembling the Egyptian Bast, the serpent mother of  Bubastis. According to Sumerian belief, Nintu, \"a form of the goddess  Ma\", was half a serpent. On her head there is a horn; she is \"girt  about the loins\"; her left arm holds \"a babe suckling her breast\":        From her head to her loins      The body is that of a naked woman;      From the loins to the sole of the foot      Scales like those of a snake are visible.                _R.C. Thompson's Translation._    The close association of gods and demons is illustrated in an obscure  myth which may refer to an eclipse of the moon or a night storm at the  beginning of the rainy season. The demons go to war against the high  gods, and are assisted by Adad (Ramman) the thunderer, Shamash the  sun, and Ishtar. They desire to wreck the heavens, the home of Anu:        They clustered angrily round the crescent of the moon god,      And won over to their aid Shamash, the mighty, and Adad, the          warrior,      And Ishtar, who with Anu, the King,      Hath founded a shining dwelling.    The moon god Sin, \"the seed of mankind\", was darkened by the demons  who raged, \"rushing loose over the land\" like to the wind. Bel called  upon his messenger, whom he sent to Ea in the ocean depths, saying:  \"My son Sin ... hath been grievously bedimmed\". Ea lamented, and  dispatched his son Merodach to net the demons by magic, using \"a  two-coloured cord from the hair of a virgin kid and from the wool of a  virgin lamb\".[101]    As in India, where Shitala, the Bengali goddess of smallpox, for  instance, is worshipped when the dreaded disease she controls becomes  epidemic, so in Babylonia the people sought to secure immunity from  attack by worshipping spirits of disease. A tablet relates that Ura, a  plague demon, once resolved to destroy all life, but ultimately  consented to spare those who praised his name and exalted him in  recognition of his bravery and power. This could be accomplished by  reciting a formula. Indian serpent worshippers believe that their  devotions \"destroy all danger proceeding from snakes\".[102]    Like the Ancient Egyptians, the Babylonians also had their kindly  spirits who brought luck and the various enjoyments of life. A good  \"labartu\" might attend on a human being like a household fairy of  India or Europe: a friendly \"shedu\" could protect a household against  the attacks of fierce demons and human enemies. Even the spirits of  Fate who served Anu, god of the sky, and that \"Norn\" of the  Underworld, Eresh-ki-gal, queen of Hades, might sometimes be  propitious: if the deities were successfully invoked they could cause  the Fates to smite spirits of disease and bringers of ill luck. Damu,  a friendly fairy goddess, was well loved, because she inspired  pleasant dreams, relieved the sufferings of the afflicted, and  restored to good health those patients whom she selected to favour.    In the Egyptian _Book of the Dead_ the kindly spirits are overshadowed  by the evil ones, because the various magical spells which were put on  record were directed against those supernatural beings who were  enemies of mankind. Similarly in Babylonia the fragments of this class  of literature which survive deal mainly with wicked and vengeful  demons. It appears probable, however, that the highly emotional  Sumerians and Akkadians were on occasion quite as cheerful a people as  the inhabitants of ancient Egypt. Although they were surrounded by  bloodthirsty furies who desired to shorten their days, and their  nights were filled with vague lowering phantoms which inspired fear,  they no doubt shared, in their charm-protected houses, a comfortable  feeling of security after performing magical ceremonies, and were  happy enough when they gathered round flickering lights to listen to  ancient song and story and gossip about crops and traders, the members  of the royal house, and the family affairs of their acquaintances.    The Babylonian spirit world, it will be seen, was of complex  character. Its inhabitants were numberless, but often vaguely defined,  and one class of demons linked with another. Like the European fairies  of folk belief, the Babylonian spirits were extremely hostile and  irresistible at certain seasonal periods; and they were fickle and  perverse and difficult to "]]]
