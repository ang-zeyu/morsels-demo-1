The extreme heat and the fatigue of travelling  could not have been borne much longer. One man (Woods) had been left  behind at his own request, being unable even to ride, from violent pains  in his stomach; another was also so ill that he could not walk; the  bullocks still drew, but with their tongues protruding most piteously. I  sent a man on horseback back with a kettleful of water to Woods. The  cattle being unyoked rushed to the stream, and in half an hour we were  all comfortably encamped, with good grass beside us for the cattle. The  bottom of this small river-channel was in no part gravelly, but consisted  of soft earth, in which however the cattle did not sink very deep.  Fragments of flint, basalt, and quartz, apparently not worn by attrition,  abound in the adjacent soil. The general direction of the watercourse  appeared to be about 36 degrees north of west.    DUCKS.    At a pond above our camp the carpenter shot two ducks of a kind not  previously seen by us, having a purple speck on the head, behind the ear.    We had now arrived in the country beyond the mountains which we had in  vain attempted to cross, having found an open and accessible way round  them; it remained to be ascertained whether the large river, as described  by The Bushranger, was near; according to him it was the first river to  be met with after crossing the range north-east by north of Tangulda.    At four P.M. the thermometer stood at 101 degrees. The latitude was  ascertained in the evening to be 29 degrees 50 minutes 29 seconds South.    WHEEL PONDS.    January 6.    The morning was rather cool, with clouds and distant thunder. We now  proceeded in a northerly direction until we were impeded by scrub, about  three miles from the camp. Through this we cut our way, keeping as  closely in the northern direction as the openings would allow. At length  the wheels of one of the carts, and the axle of another, became  unserviceable, and could not be repaired, unless we halted for two days.  As they could only be dragged a few miles further, I went forward as soon  as we got clear of the scrubs, which extended three miles, in search of  water for an encampment. I came upon a slight hollow and followed it  down, but it disappeared on a level plain, bounded on each side by rising  grounds. One dry pond encouraged my hopes, and I continued my search  along a narrow flat, where the grass had been recently on fire. From this  point, and while pursuing a kangaroo, I came upon a well marked  watercourse with deep holes, but all these were dry. Tracing the line of  these holes downwards to where the other flat united with it I found,  exactly in the point of junction, as I had reason to expect, a deep pool  of water. Once more therefore we could encamp, especially as two very  large ponds on a rocky bed were found a little lower than that water  first discovered. This element was daily becoming more precious in our  estimation, and I had reason to be very anxious about it, on account of  Mr. Finch, who was following in our track. The spot on which we encamped  was covered with rich grass, and enclosed by shady casuarinae and thick  brush. The prospect of two days' repose for the cattle on that verdure,  and under these shades, was most refreshing to us all. It was, indeed, a  charming spot, enlivened by numbers of pigeons, and the songs of little  birds, in strange, but very pleasing notes.    Here I again remarked that among these casuarinae scrubs the eucalyptus,  so common in the colony, was only to be seen near water; so that its  white shining bark and gnarled branches, while they reminded us of home  at Sydney, also marked out the spots for fixing our nightly home in the  bush.    EXCESSIVE HEAT AND DROUGHT.    January 7.    The night had been unusually hot, the thermometer having stood at 90  degrees, and there had not been a breath of wind. Few of the men had  slept. Thus even night, which had previously afforded us some protection  from our great enemy, the heat, no longer relieved us from its effects;  and this incessant high temperature which weakened the cattle, dried up  the waters, destroyed our wheels, and nourished the fires that covered  the country with smoke, made humidity appear to us the very essence of  existence, and water almost an object of adoration. No disciple of  Zoroaster could have made proselytes of us. The thermometer ranged from  96 to 101 degrees during the day, and during the last five nights had  stood as high as 90 degrees between sunset and sunrise. From the time the  party left Sydney rain had fallen on only one day. We left each friendly  waterhole in the greatest uncertainty whether we should ever drink again,  and it may be imagined with what interest, under such circumstances, I  watched the progress of a cloudy sky. It was not uncommon for the heavens  to be overcast, but the clouds seemed to consist more of smoke than moist  vapour. The wind, from the time of our first arrival in the country, had  blown from the north or north-west, and the bent of trees, at all  exposed, showed that these were the prevailing winds.    DESCRIPTION OF THE WOODS.    The country when seen from an eminence appeared to be very generally  wooded, but the lower parts were perfectly clear, or thinly strewed with  bushes, and slender trees, chiefly varieties of acacia. The principal  wood consisted of casuarinae which grew in thick clumps, or scrubs, and  very much impeded, as has already been stated, our progress in any given  direction. I found that these scrubs of casuarinae grew generally on  rising grounds, and chiefly on their northern or eastern slopes. We saw  little of the callitris tribe, after we had crossed the first hill beyond  our last camp on the Namoi. On the contrary, these casuarinae scrubs and  grassy plains seemed to characterise the country to the westward and  northward of the Nundewar range, as far, at least, as we had yet  penetrated. The course of this chain of ponds appeared to be parallel to  that on which we had previously encamped, 36 degrees North of West. A  yellow, highly calcareous sandstone occurred in the bed and banks of this  stream, forming a stratum from two or three feet in thickness, and in  parts of the upper surface nodules of ironstone were embedded.    On examining our wheels, we found that the heat had damaged them very  much, some of the spokes having shrunk more than an inch. The carpenter  managed however to repair them this day.    January 8.    The morning was cool and pleasant, with a breeze from the west. We left  the ponds (named Wheel Ponds) exactly at six A.M., and, after travelling  a mile, entered a scrub through which we were compelled to cut a lane  with axes, for three miles; when at length the wood opened, and some  trees of that species of eucalyptus called box grew on the flats. At five  miles from our camp I shot a kangaroo.    MEET WITH NATIVES.    At seven miles, as we entered a forest,* we heard the sound of the  natives' hatchets, and we saw soon after their fires at a distance. We at  length came unawares upon a native in a tree, for he was so busy at work  cutting out an opossum, that he did not see us, until we were very near  him. A gin and child gave the alarm, upon which he stared at the strange  assemblage with a look of horror, and immediately calling to the female  in an authoritative tone, she disappeared in the woods. He then threw a  club, or nulla-nulla, to the foot of the tree, and ascended to the  highest branch. I called to him, and made such signs as I thought most  likely to give him confidence and remove his apprehensions of harm; but  apparently to no purpose, for his reply was \"Ogai!\" pronounced in a loud  imperative tone. I thought it best to proceed quietly on our way;  whereupon he descended and ran off, having picked up two spears which lay  near the tree. We heard calls in various directions, and witefellow  pronounced very loudly and distinctly. Witefellow, or wite ma, appears to  be their name (of course derived from us) for our race, and this  appellation probably accompanies the first intelligence of such strangers  to the most remote, interior regions.    (*Footnote. A forest means in New South Wales, an open wood, with grass.  The common bush or scrub consists of trees and saplings, where little  grass is to be found.)    CROSS THE DRY BED OF A RIVER.    We soon after came upon the bank of a river-course, in the bed of which,  although deep, broad, and gravelly, there was no water; its general  direction was westward. At eight miles we entered upon an extensive, open  plain, which reached to the horizon in the direction of 10 degrees West  of North. We crossed it, continuing our journey northward, until a thick  scrub obliged me to turn to the east.    A FRIENDLY NATIVE WITH HIS FAMILY.    At thirteen miles, being again in a wood, we heard the native axe at  work, and, naturally eager to communicate with or even see the faces of  fellow-creatures in these dismal solitudes, I allowed Dawkins to go  towards them unarmed, that he might, at least by signs, ascertain where  water was to be found. A considerable time having elapsed without his  reappearance, I went after him, and found him in communication (by signs)  with a very civil native, who had just carried a quantity of wild honey  to his gin and child, having first offered some to Dawkins. This man  betrayed no signs of fear, neither had he any offensive weapons, but he  refused to accompany Dawkins to the rest of the party, rather inviting  the latter, by signs, to accompany him. For water, he pointed both to the  north-east and south-west, and all around, as if it had been abundant;  numerous pigeons and kangaroos also showed that there was some at no  great distance; nevertheless we were doomed to pass another night without  any, after a long day's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12929"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 1 (#18)"],[1,"to a strait, separating Terra  Australis into two or more islands, or led into a mediterranean sea, as  some thought; or whether it were the entrance of a large river, there  was, in either case, a great geographical question to be settled,  relative to the parts behind Rosemary Island.    If Tasman's chart were defective at De Witt's Land, it was likely to be  so in other parts of the same coast; where there was no account, or  belief, that it had been examined by any other person further north than  the latitude 161/2 deg.. An investigation of the whole North-west Coast, with  its numerous islands and shoals, was, therefore, required, before it  could enter into the present improved systems of geography and  navigation.    The chart of the West Coast, as far south as Rottenest, was founded upon  much better authority; but for its formation from thence to Cape Leeuwin  there were no good documents. In this part, there was room even for  discovery; and the whole coast required to be laid down with more  accuracy than had been attainable by the Dutch navigators.    As to the soil and vegetable productions upon several points near the  sea, from Rottenest, northward to 161/2, there was tolerably good general  information; the inhabitants, also, had been seen; and, at one place,  communication with them had been obtained. The accounts did, certainly,  not give any flattering prospect, that much interesting knowledge was  likely to be acquired under these heads, unless a strait, or inland sea,  were found; but the accounts were not only confined as to place, but,  with the exception of Dampier's, were very imperfect; and the great  extent of the coasts, in the richest climates of the world, excited hopes  that a close investigation would not only be of advantage to natural  history, but would bring to light something useful in the mineral or  vegetable kingdoms.    In the case of penetrating the interior of Terra Australis, whether by a  great river, or a strait leading to an inland sea, a superior country,  and perhaps a different people, might be found, the knowledge of which  could not fail to be very interesting, and might prove advantageous to  the nation making the discovery.    PRIOR DISCOVERIES IN TERRA AUSTRALIS.    SECTION III.    SOUTH COAST.    Discovery of Nuyts.  Examination of Vancouver:  of D'Entrecasteaux.  Conclusive Remarks.    NUYTS. 1627. (Atl. Pl. I.)    No historical fact seems to be less disputed, than that the South Coast  of New Holland was first discovered in January 1627: whether it were the  26th, according to _De Hondt_, or the 16th, as is expressed on  _Thevenot's_ chart, is of very little import. It is generally said, that  the ship was commanded by PIETER NUYTS; but as Nuyts, on his arrival at  Batavia, was sent ambassador to Japan, and afterwards made governor of  Formosa, it seems more probable that he was a civilian, perhaps Company's  first merchant on board, rather than captain of the ship: the land  discovered has, however, always borne his name.    The Dutch recital says--\"In the year 1627, the South Coast of the  _Great_ SOUTH LAND was accidentally discovered by the ship the _Gulde  Zeepaard_, outward-bound from Fatherland, for the space of a thousand  miles.\"    This discovery has always been considered as of importance. A memoir was  published at Amsterdam in 1718, \"to prove, that NUYTS' LAND, being in the  fifth climate, between 34 deg. and 36 deg. of latitude; it ought to be, like all  other countries so situated, one of the most habitable, most rich, and  most fertile parts of the world.\" * The journal of this discovery seems to  have been lost; or possibly was either suppressed or destroyed, according  to what is thought to have been the Dutch policy of that time. It was,  therefore, from the chart, and the above passage in the recital, alone,  that any particulars could be drawn. If the extent of a _thousand miles_  were taken to be in a straight line, and to commence at Cape Leeuwin, the  end of Nuyts' Land would reach nearly to the longitude of 135 deg. east of  Greenwich; but if, as was probable, the windings of the shore were  included, and a deduction made of one-sixth to one-seventh in the  distance, then the Isles of St. Francis and St. Peter might be expected  to be found between the 132nd and 133rd degrees of east longitude.    [* _Hist. des Nav. aux Terres Australes_. Tome I. page 429.]    VANCOUVER. 1791.    With the exception of Mons. de St. Alouarn, who is said to have anchored  near Cape Leeuwin in 1772, the south coast of Terra Australis, though  occupying much attention from geographers, seems to have been left  unvisited from 1627 to 1791. In this year, captain GEORGE VANCOUVER,  being on his way to North-west America, made the South Coast on Sept. 26,  at _Cape Chatham_, in latitude 35 deg. 3' south, and longitude 116 deg. 35' east,  not many leagues beyond where Nuyts appears to have commenced his  discovery. He sailed eastward, from thence, along the shore, till the  28th; when he anchored in a sound, to which was given the name of KING  GEORGE THE III.    The country in the neighbourhood of the Sound, and of its two harbours,  was found to be agreeably variegated in form; to be clothed with grass  and wood; and, though generally more barren than fertile, yet affording  many spots capable of cultivation. No considerable river was discovered;  but fresh water was every where abundant for domestic purposes; and the  climate was judged to be as healthy as the temperature was found to be  agreeable. Kangaroos did not appear to be scarce; nor were the woods ill  tenanted by the feathered tribes; and reptiles and other noxious animals  were not numerous. Amongst the aquatic birds, black swans and wild ducks  held a distinguished place; but, like the land animals, were very shy:  sea and shell fish were in tolerable abundance.    None of the inhabitants were seen; but from the appearance of their  deserted huts, they were judged to be the same miserable race as those of  the North-west and East Coasts. No marks of canoes, nor the remains of  fish, even shell fish, were found near their habitations; and this  circumstance, with the shyness of the birds and quadrupeds, induced a  belief that the natives depended principally upon the woods for their  subsistence.    Captain Vancouver quitted King George's Sound on Oct. 11, and proceeded  eastward in the examination of the coast; but unfavourable winds  prevented him from doing this so completely as he wished, and some parts  were passed unseen; and the impediments to his progress at length caused  the examination to be quitted, in favour of prosecuting the main design  of his voyage. The last land seen was _Termination Island_, in latitude  34 deg. 32' and longitude 122 deg. 8'. The coast to the north of this island  appeared much broken; but, although in Nuyts' chart a considerable group  of islands were laid down in about that situation, captain Vancouver  rather supposed it to be a continued main land.*    [* For captain Vancouver's account of his proceedings and observations on  the South Coast, see his _Voyage round the World_, Vol. I. page 28-57.]    So far as this examination extended, the general form of the coast was  found to correspond with that of the old chart; nor was any material  error found in Nuyts' latitude. A further, and more extended confirmation  of the Dutch navigator's discovery, and of its having been well laid  down, considering the period at which it was done, was obtained in the  following year.    D'ENTRECASTEAUX. 1792.    The French rear-admiral BRUNY D'ENTRECASTEAUX, having been sent out with  the ships _La Recherche_ and _L'Esperance_ in search of the unfortunate  La Perouse made the south coast of New Holland on Dec. 5, 1792, about  twenty-eight leagues to the north-west of Cape Chatham.* The coast, from  the South-west Cape to the longitude of Termination Island, was explored  by the admiral, with all the minuteness that the state of the weather  could permit; and he was, generally, able to keep the shore closer abord  than captain Vancouver had done, and to supply the deficiencies in his  chart. The broken land to the north of Termination Island was found to be  conformable to what Nuyts had laid down: it made part of a very extensive  group of islands, one of which afforded timely shelter to the French  ships on Dec. 9, from a gale which had arisen at south-west.    [*When the Investigator sailed, the journal of _M. Labillardiere_,  naturalist in D'Entrecasteaux's expedition, was the sole account of the  voyage made public: but M. DE ROSSEI one of the principal officers, has  since published the voyage from the journals of the rear-admiral and it  is from this last that what follows is extracted.]    They remained a week at this anchorage, whilst the naturalists explored  the surrounding country, and the surveyors examined such of the islands  as were visible from the ships. Seals, penguins, and some kangaroos were  seen; but no fresh water, accessible to shipping, could any where be  found; the country within their reach being sandy and sterile. From Dec.  17 to 24, the ships were occupied in coasting eastward, along the  outskirt of the group of islands, and then found it to terminate at 21/2 deg.  of longitude from its commencement. The main land at the back of the  islands had been generally visible, but at too great a distance for the  precise form of the coast to be ascertained, or to allow of fixing the  positions of, or even seeing, many of the inner islands and reefs.    This group is the first of the two marked upon the chart of Nuyts; and  admiral D'Entrecasteaux praises the general accuracy of the Dutch  navigator, in that \"the latitude of Point Leeuwin, and of the coast of  Nuyts' Land, were laid down with an exactness, surprising for the remote  period in which they had been discovered.\" This liberal acknowledgment  renders it the more"]]]
