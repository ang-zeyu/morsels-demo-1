He wished to be informed of the disposition and economy of the  wind-chamber....    \"The wind-chamber!\" he called, in an agony lest the knowledge  almost within his grasp should be lost. \"I would know about the  wind-chamber....\"    Like an echo, there came back the words, uncomprehendingly uttered, \"_The  wind-chamber_?...\"    \"... that driveth the vessel--perchance 'tis not wind--a steel bow that  is bent also conserveth force--the force you store, to move at will  through calm and storm....\"    \"Can you make out what it's driving at?\"    \"Oh, we shall all wake up in a minute....\"    \"Quiet, I have it; the engines; it wants to know about our engines.  It'll be wanting to see our papers presently. Rye Port!... Well, no harm  in humouring it; let's see what it can make of this. Ahoy there!\" came  the voice to Abel Keeling, a little more strongly, as if a shifting wind  carried it, and speaking faster and faster as it went on. \"Not wind, but  steam; d'you hear? Steam, steam. Steam, in eight Yarrow water-tube  boilers. S-t-e-a-m, steam. Got it? And we've twin-screw triple expansion  engines, indicated horse-power four thousand, and we can do 430  revolutions per minute; savvy? Is there anything your phantomhood would  like to know about our armament?...\"    Abel Keeling was muttering fretfully to himself. It annoyed him that  words in his own vision should have no meaning for him. How did words  come to him in a dream that he had no knowledge of when wide awake? The  _Seapink_--that was the name of this ship; but a pink was long and  narrow, low-carged and square-built aft....    \"_And as for our armament,_\" the voice with the tones that so profoundly  troubled Abel Keeling's memory continued, \"_we've two revolving Whitehead  torpedo-tubes, three six-pounders on the upper deck, and that's a  twelve-pounder forward there by the conning-tower. I forgot to mention  that we're nickel steel, with a coal capacity of sixty tons in most  damnably placed bunkers, and that thirty and a quarter knots is about our  top. Care to come aboard?_\"    But the voice was speaking still more rapidly and feverishly, as if to  fill a silence with no matter what, and the shape that was uttering it  was straining forward anxiously over the rail.    \"_Ugh! But I'm glad this happened in the daylight,_\" another voice was  muttering.    \"I wish I was sure it was happening at all.... Poor old spook!\"    \"I suppose it would keep its feet if her deck was quite vertical. Think  she'll go down, or just melt?\"    \"Kind of go down ... without wash....\"    \"Listen--here's the other one now--\"    For Bligh was singing again:    \"For, Lord, Thou know'st our nature such    If we great things obtain,  And in the getting of the same    Do feel no grief or pain,    \"We little do esteem thereof;    But, hardly brought to pass,  A thousand times we do esteem    More than the other was.\"    _\"But oh, look--look--look at the other!... Oh, I say, wasn't he a grand  old boy! Look!\"_    For, transfiguring Abel Reeling's form as a prophet's form is  transfigured in the instant of his rapture, flooding his brain with the  white eureka-light of perfect knowledge, that for which he and his dream  had been at a standstill had come. He knew her, this ship of the future,  as if God's Finger had bitten her lines into his brain. He knew her as  those already sinking into the grave know things, miraculously,  completely, accepting Life's impossibilities with a nodded \"Of course.\"  From the ardent mouths of her eight furnaces to the last drip from her  lubricators, from her bed-plates to the breeches of her quick-firers, he  knew her--read her gauges, thumbed her bearings, gave the ranges from her  range-finders, and lived the life he lived who was in command of her. And  he would not forget on the morrow, as he had forgotten on many morrows,  for at last he had seen the water about his feet, and knew that there  would be no morrow for him in this world....    And even in that moment, with but a sand or two to run in his glass,  indomitable, insatiable, dreaming dream on dream, he could not die until  he knew more. He had two questions to ask, and a master-question; and but  a moment remained. Sharply his voice rang out.    \"Ho, there!... This ancient ship, the _Mary of the Tower_, cannot steam  thirty and a quarter knots, but yet she can sail the waters. What  more does your ship? Can she soar above them, as the fowls of the air  soar?\"    \"_Lord, he thinks we're an aeroplane!... No, she can't...._\"    \"And can you dive, even as the fishes of the deep?\"    \"_No.... Those are submarines ... we aren't a submarine...._\"    But Abel Keeling waited for no more. He gave an exulting chuckle.    \"Oho, oho--thirty knots, and but on the face of the waters--no more than  that? Oho!... Now _my_ ship, the ship I see as a mother sees full-grown  the child she has but conceived--_my_ ship, I say--oho!--_my_ ship  shall.... Below there--trip that gun!\"    The cry came suddenly and alertly, as a muffled sound came from below and  an ominous tremor shook the galleon.    \"_By Jove, her guns are breaking loose below--that's her finish_--\"    \"Trip that gun, and double-breech the others!\" Abel Keeling's voice rang  out, as if there had been any to obey him. He had braced himself within  the belfry frame; and then in the middle of the next order his voice  suddenly failed him. His ship-shape, that for the moment he had  forgotten, rode once more before his eyes. This was the end, and his  master-question, apprehension for the answer to which was now torturing  his face and well-nigh bursting his heart, was still unasked.    \"Ho--he that spoke with me--the master,\" he cried in a voice that ran  high, \"is he there?\"    \"_Yes, yes!_\" came the other voice across the water, sick with suspense.  \"_Oh, be quick!_\"    There was a moment in which hoarse cries from many voices, a heavy thud  and rumble on wood, and a crash of timbers and a gurgle and a splash were  indescribably mingled; the gun under which Abel Keeling had lain had  snapped her rotten breechings and plunged down the deck, carrying Bligh's  unconscious form with it. The deck came up vertical, and for one instant  longer Abel Keeling clung to the belfry.    \"I cannot see your face,\" he screamed, \"but meseems your voice is a voice  I know. _What is your name_?\"    In a torn sob the answer came across the water:    \"_Keeling--Abel Keeling.... Oh, my God!_\"    And Abel Keeling's cry of triumph, that mounted to a victorious \"Huzza!\"  was lost in the downward plunge of the _Mary of the Tower_, that left  the strait empty save for the sun's fiery blaze and the last smoke-like  evaporation of the mists.          ROOUM      For all I ever knew to the contrary, it was his own name; and something  about him, name or man or both, always put me in mind, I can't tell you  how, of negroes. As regards the name, I dare say it was something  huggermugger in the mere sound--something that I classed, for no  particular reason, with the dark and ignorant sort of words, such as  \"Obi\" and \"Hoodoo.\" I only know that after I learned that his name was  Rooum, I couldn't for the life of me have thought of him as being called  anything else.    The first impression that you got of his head was that it was a patchwork  of black and white--black bushy hair and short white beard, or else the  other way about. As a matter of fact, both hair and beard were piebald,  so that if you saw him in the gloom a dim patch of white showed down one  side of his head, and dark tufts cropped up here and there in his beard.  His eyebrows alone were entirely black, with a little sprouting of hair  almost joining them. And perhaps his skin helped to make me think of  negroes, for it was very dark, of the dark brown that always seems to  have more than a hint of green behind it. His forehead was low, and  scored across with deep horizontal furrows.    We never knew when he was going to turn up on a job. We might not have  seen him for weeks, but his face was always as likely as not to appear  over the edge of a crane-platform just when that marvellous mechanical  intuition of his was badly needed. He wasn't certificated. He wasn't even  trained, as the rest of us understood training; and he scoffed at the  drawing-office, and laughed outright at logarithms and our laborious  methods of getting out quantities. But he could set sheers and tackle in  a way that made the rest of us look silly. I remember once how, through  the parting of a chain, a sixty-foot girder had come down and lay under  a ruck of other stuff, as the bottom chip lies under a pile of  spellikins--a hopeless-looking smash. Myself, I'm certificated twice or  three times over; but I can only assure you that I wanted to kick myself  when, after I'd spent a day and a sleepless night over the job, I saw the  game of tit-tat-toe that Rooum made of it in an hour or two. Certificated  or not, a man isn't a fool who can do that sort of thing. And he was  one of these fellows, too, who can \"find water\"--tell you where water is  and what amount of getting it is likely to take, by just walking over the  place. We aren't certificated up to that yet.    He was offered good money to stick to us--to stick to our firm--but he  always shook his black-and-white piebald head. He'd never be able to keep  the bargain if he were to make it, he told us quite fairly. I know there  are these chaps who can't endure to be clocked to their work with a  patent time-clock in the morning and released of an evening with a  whistle--and it's one of the things no master can ever understand. So  Rooum came and went erratically, showing up maybe in Leeds or Liverpool,  perhaps next on Plymouth breakwater, and once he turned up in an  out-of-the-way place in Glamorganshire just when I was wondering what had  become of him.    The way I got to know him (got to know him, I mean, more than just to  nod) was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14209"],[0,"The Kybalion (#18)"],[1,"ctricity. The process of detachment  or separation of the Feminine electrons is called \"ionization.\" These  electrons, or corpuscles, are the most active workers in Nature's field.  Arising from their unions, or combinations, manifest the varied  phenomena of light, heat, electricity, magnetism, attraction,  repulsion, chemical affinity and the reverse, and similar phenomena. And  all this arises from the operation of the Principle of Gender on the  plane of Energy.    The part of the Masculine principle seems to be that of directing a  certain inherent energy toward the Feminine principle, and thus starting  into activity the creative processes. But the Feminine principle is the  one always doing the active creative work-and this is so on all planes.  And yet, each principle is incapable of operative energy without the  assistance of the other. In some of the forms of life, the two  principles are combined in one organism. For that matter, everything in  the organic world manifests both genders--there is always the Masculine  present in the Feminine form, and the Feminine form.  The Hermetic  Teachings include much regarding the operation of the two principles of  Gender in the production and manifestation of various forms of energy,  etc., but we do not deem it expedient to go into detail regarding the  same at this point, because we are unable to back up the same with  scientific proof, for the reason that science has not as yet progressed  thus far. But the example we have given you of the phenomena of the  electrons or corpuscles will show you that science is on the right path,  and will also give you a general idea of the underlying principles.    Some leading scientific investigators have announced their belief that  in the formation of crystals there was to be found something that  corresponded to \"sex-activity\" which is another straw showing the  direction the scientific winds are blowing. And each year will bring  other facts to corroborate the correctness of the Hermetic Principle of  Gender. It will be found that Gender is in constant operation and  manifestation in the field of inorganic matter, and in the field of  Energy or Force. Electricity is now generally regarded as the  \"Something\" into which all other forms of energy seem to melt or  dissolve. The \"Electrical Theory of the Universe\" is the latest  scientific doctrine, and is growing rapidly in popularity and  general acceptance. And it thus follows that if we are able to discover  in the phenomena of electricity-even at the very root and source of its  manifestations a clear and unmistakable evidence of the presence of  Gender and its activities, we are justified in asking you to believe  that science at last has offered proofs of the existence in all  universal phenomena of that great Hermetic Principle-the Principle of  Gender.    It is not necessary to take up your time with the well known phenomena  of the \"attraction and repulsion\" of the atoms; chemical affinity; the  \"loves and hates\" of the atomic particles; the attraction or cohesion  between the molecules of matter. These facts are too well known to need  extended comment from us. But, have you ever considered that all of  these things are manifestations of the Gender Principle? Can you not see  that the phenomena is \"on all fours\" with that of the corpuscles or  electrons? And more than this, can you not see the reasonableness of the  Hermetic Teachings which assert that the very Law of Gravitation-that  strange attraction by reason of which all particles and bodies of matter  in the universe tend toward each other is but another manifestation of  the Principle of Gender, which operates in the direction of attracting  the Masculine to the Feminine energies, and vice versa? We cannot offer  you scientific proof of this at this time-but examine the phenomena in  the light of the Hermetic Teachings on the subject, and see if you have  not a better working hypothesis than any offered by physical science.  Submit all physical phenomena to the test, and you will discern the  Principle of Gender ever in evidence.    Let us now pass on to a consideration of the operation of the Principle  on the Mental Plane. Many interesting features are there awaiting  examination.        CHAPTER XIV    MENTAL GENDER    Students of psychology who have followed the modern trend of thought  along the lines of mental phenomena are struck by the persistence of the  dual-mind idea which has manifested itself so strongly during the past  ten or fifteen years, and which has given rise to a number of plausible  theories regarding the nature and constitution of these \"two minds.\" The  late Thomson J. Hudson attained great popularity in 1893 by advancing  his well-known theory of the \"objective and subjective minds\" which he  held existed in every individual. Other writers have attracted almost  equal attention by the theories regarding the \"conscious and  subconscious minds\"; the \"voluntary and involuntary minds\"; \"the active  and passive minds,\" etc., etc. The theories of the various writers  differ from each other, but there remains the underlying principle of  \"the duality of mind.\"    The student of the Hermetic Philosophy is tempted to smile when he reads  and hears of these many \"new theories\" regarding the duality of mind,  each school adhering tenaciously to its own pet theories, and each  claiming to have \"discovered the truth.\" The student turns back the  pages of occult history, and away back in the dim beginnings of occult  teachings he finds references to the ancient Hermetic doctrine of the  Principle of Gender on the Mental Plane-the manifestation of Mental  Gender. And examining further he finds that the ancient philosophy took  cognizance of the phenomenon of the \"dual mind,\" and accounted for it by  the theory of Mental Gender. This idea of Mental Gender may be explained  in a few words to students who are familiar with the modern theories  just alluded to. The Masculine Principle of Mind corresponds to the  so-called Objective Mind; Conscious Mind; Voluntary Mind; Active Mind,  etc. And the Feminine Principle of Mind corresponds to the so-called  Subjective Mind; Sub-conscious Mind; Involuntary Mind; Passive Mind,  etc. Of course the Hermetic Teachings do not agree with the many modern  theories regarding the nature of the two phases of mind, nor does it  admit many of the facts claimed for the two respective aspects--some of  the said theories and claims being very far-fetched and incapable of  standing the test of experiment and demonstration.  We point to the  phases of agreement merely for the purpose of helping the student to  assimilate his previously acquired knowledge with the teachings of the  Hermetic Philosophy. Students of Hudson will notice the statement at the  beginning of his second chapter of \"The Law of Psychic Phenomena,\" that:  \"The mystic jargon of the Hermetic philosophers discloses the same  general idea\" i.e., the duality of mind. If Dr. Hudson had taken  the time and trouble to decipher a little of \"the mystic jargon of the  Hermetic Philosophy,\" he might have received much light upon the subject  of \"the dual mind\"--but then, perhaps, his most interesting work might  not have been written. Let us now consider the Hermetic Teachings  regarding Mental Gender.    The Hermetic Teachers impart their instruction regarding this subject by  bidding their students examine the report of their consciousness  regarding their Self. The students are bidden to turn their attention  inward upon the Self dwelling within each. Each student is led to see  that his consciousness gives him first a report of the existence of his  Self-the report is \"I Am.\" This at first seems to be the final words  from the consciousness, but a little further examination discloses the  fact that this \"I Am\" may be separated or split into two distinct parts,  or aspects, which while working in unison and in conjunction, yet,  nevertheless, may be separated in consciousness.    While at first there seems to be only an \"I\" existing, a more careful  and closer examination reveals the fact that there exists an \"I\" and a  \"Me.\" These mental twins differ in their characteristics and nature, and  an examination of their nature and the phenomena arising from the same  will throw much light upon many of the problems of mental influence.    Let us begin with a consideration of the Me, which is usually mistaken  for the I by the student, until he presses the inquiry a little further  back into the recesses of consciousness. A man thinks of his Self (in  its aspect of Me) as being composed of certain feelings, tastes likes,  dislikes, habits, peculiar ties, characteristics, etc., all of which go  to make up his personality, or the \"Self\" known to himself and others.  He knows that these emotions and feelings change; are born and die away;  are subject to the Principle of Rhythm, and the Principle of Polarity,  which take him from one extreme of feeling to another. He also thinks of  the \"Me\" as being certain knowledge gathered together in his mind, and  thus forming a part of himself. This is the \"Me\" of a man.    But we have proceeded too hastily. The \"Me\" of many men may be said to  consist largely of their consciousness of the body and their physical  appetites, etc. Their consciousness being largely bound up with their  bodily nature, they practically \"live there.\" Some men even go so far as  to regard their personal apparel as a part of their \"Me\" and actually  seem to consider it a part of themselves. A writer has humorously said  that \"men consist of three parts--soul, body and clothes.\" These  \"clothes conscious\" people would lose their personality if divested of  their clothing by savages upon the occasion of a shipwreck. But even  many who are not so closely bound up with the idea of personal raiment  stick closely to the consciousness of their bodies being their \"Me\" They  cannot conceive of a Self"]]]
