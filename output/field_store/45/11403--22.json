On the contrary, the possession of  magical knowledge was an especial attribute of Odin himself; and to  intrude themselves upon a deity, and compel him to instruct them in what  they desired to know, was accounted not an act of impiety, but of  gallantry and high courage, among those sons of the sword and the spear.  Their matrons possessed a high reputation for magic, for prophetic  powers, for creating illusions; and, if not capable of transformations  of the human body, they were at least able to impose such fascination on  the sight of their enemies as to conceal for a period the objects of  which they were in search.    There is a remarkable story in the Eyrbiggia Saga (\"Historia  Eyranorum\"), giving the result of such a controversy between two of  these gifted women, one of whom was determined on discovering and  putting to death the son of the other, named Katla, who in a brawl had  cut off the hand of the daughter-in-law of Geirada. A party detached to  avenge this wrong, by putting Oddo to death, returned deceived by the  skill of his mother. They had found only Katla, they said, spinning flax  from a large distaff. \"Fools,\" said Geirada, \"that distaff was the man  you sought.\" They returned, seized the distaff, and burnt it. But this  second time, the witch disguised her son under the appearance of a tame  kid. A third time he was a hog, which grovelled among the ashes. The  party returned yet again; augmented as one of Katla's maidens, who kept  watch, informed her mistress, by one in a blue mantle. \"Alas!\" said  Katla, \"it is the sorceress Geirada, against whom spells avail not.\"  Accordingly, the hostile party, entering for the fourth time, seized on  the object of their animosity, and put him to death.[15] This species of  witchcraft is well known in Scotland as the _glamour,_ or _deceptio  visus_, and was supposed to be a special attribute of the race of  Gipsies.    [Footnote 15: Eyrbiggia Saga, in \"Northern Antiquities.\"]    Neither are those prophetesses to be forgotten, so much honoured among  the German tribes, that, as we are assured by Tacitus, they rose to the  highest rank in their councils, by their supposed supernatural  knowledge, and even obtained a share in the direction of their armies.  This peculiarity in the habits of the North was so general, that it was  no unusual thing to see females, from respect to their supposed views  into futurity, and the degree of divine inspiration which was vouchsafed  to them, arise to the degree of HAXA, or chief priestess, from which  comes the word _Hexe_, now universally used for a witch; a circumstance  which plainly shows that the mythological system of the ancient natives  of the North had given to the modern language an appropriate word for  distinguishing those females who had intercourse with the spiritual  world.[16]    [Footnote 16: It may be worth while to notice that the word Haxa is  still used in Scotland in its sense of a druidess, or chief priestess,  to distinguish the places where such females exercised their ritual.  There is a species of small intrenchment on the western descent of the  Eildon hills, which Mr. Milne, in his account of the parish of Melrose,  drawn up about eighty years ago, says, was denominated _Bourjo_, a word  of unknown derivation, by which the place is still known. Here an  universal and subsisting tradition bore that human sacrifices were of  yore offered, while the people assisting could behold the ceremony from  the elevation of the glacis which slopes inward. With this place of  sacrifice communicated a path, still discernible, called the  _Haxell-gate_, leading to a small glen or narrow valley called the  _Haxellcleuch_--both which words are probably derived from the Haxa or  chief priestess of the pagans.]    It is undeniable that these Pythonesses were held in high respect while  the pagan religion lasted; but for that very reason they became odious  so soon as the tribe was converted to Christianity. They were, of  course, if they pretended to retain their influence, either despised as  impostors or feared as sorceresses; and the more that, in particular  instances, they became dreaded for their power, the more they were  detested, under the conviction that they derived it from the enemy of  man. The deities of the northern heathens underwent a similar  metamorphosis, resembling that proposed by Drawcansir in the  \"Rehearsal,\" who threatens \"to make a god subscribe himself a devil.\"    The warriors of the North received this new impression concerning the  influence of their deities, and the source from which it was derived,  with the more indifference, as their worship, when their mythology was  most generally established, was never of a very reverential or  devotional character. Their idea of their own merely human prowess was  so high, that the champions made it their boast, as we have already  hinted, they would not give way in fight even to the immortal gods  themselves. Such, we learn from Caesar, was the idea of the Germans  concerning the Suevi, or Swabians, a tribe to whom the others yielded  the palm of valour; and many individual stories are told in the Sagas  concerning bold champions, who had fought, not only with the sorcerers,  but with the demigods of the system, and come off unharmed, if not  victorious, in the contest. Hother, for example, encountered the god  Thor in battle, as Diomede, in the Iliad, engages with Mars, and with  like success. Bartholsine[17] gives us repeated examples of the same  kind. \"Know this,\" said Kiartan to Olaus Trigguasen, \"that I believe  neither in idols nor demons. I have travelled through various strange  countries, and have encountered many giants and monsters, and have never  been conquered by them; I therefore put my sole trust in my own strength  of body and courage of soul.\" Another yet more broad answer was made to  St. Olaus, King of Norway, by Gaukater. \"I am neither Pagan nor  Christian. My comrades and I profess no other religion than a perfect  confidence in our own strength and invincibility in battle.\" Such  chieftains were of the sect of Mezentius--    \"Dextra mihi Deus, et telum, quod missile libro,   Nunc adsint!\"[18]    And we cannot wonder that champions of such a character, careless of  their gods while yet acknowledged as such, readily regarded them as  demons after their conversion to Christianity.    [Footnote 17: \"De causis contemptae necis,\" lib. i. cap 6.]    [Footnote 18: \"AEneid,\" lib. x. line 773.]    To incur the highest extremity of danger became accounted a proof of  that insuperable valour for which every Northman desired to be famed,  and their annals afford numerous instances of encounters with ghosts,  witches, furies, and fiends, whom the Kiempe, or champions, compelled to  submit to their mere mortal strength, and yield to their service the  weapons or other treasures which they guarded in their tombs.    The Norsemen were the more prone to these superstitions, because it was  a favourite fancy of theirs that, in many instances, the change from  life to death altered the temper of the human spirit from benignant to  malevolent; or perhaps, that when the soul left the body, its departure  was occasionally supplied by a wicked demon, who took the opportunity to  enter and occupy its late habitation.    Upon such a supposition the wild fiction that follows is probably  grounded; which, extravagant as it is, possesses something striking to  the imagination. Saxo Grammaticus tells us of the fame of two Norse  princes or chiefs, who had formed what was called a brotherhood in arms,  implying not only the firmest friendship and constant support during all  the adventures which they should undertake in life, but binding them by  a solemn compact, that after the death of either, the survivor should  descend alive into the sepulchre of his brother-in-arms, and consent to  be buried alongst with him. The task of fulfilling this dreadful compact  fell upon Asmund, his companion, Assueit, having been slain in battle.  The tomb was formed after the ancient northern custom in what was called  the age of hills, that is, when it was usual to bury persons of  distinguished merit or rank on some conspicuous spot, which was crowned  with a mound. With this purpose a deep narrow vault was constructed, to  be the apartment of the future tomb over which the sepulchral heap was  to be piled. Here they deposited arms, trophies, poured forth, perhaps,  the blood of victims, introduced into the tomb the war-horses of the  champions, and when these rites had been duly paid, the body of Assueit  was placed in the dark and narrow house, while his faithful  brother-in-arms entered and sat down by the corpse, without a word or  look which testified regret or unwillingness to fulfil his fearful  engagement. The soldiers who had witnessed this singular interment of  the dead and living, rolled a huge stone to the mouth of the tomb, and  piled so much earth and stones above the spot as made a mound visible  from a great distance, and then, with loud lamentation for the loss of  such undaunted leaders, they dispersed themselves like a flock which has  lost its shepherd.    Years passed away after years, and a century had elapsed ere a noble  Swedish rover, bound upon some high adventure and supported by a gallant  band of followers, arrived in the valley which took its name from the  tomb of the brethren-in-arms. The story was told to the strangers, whose  leader determined on opening the sepulchre, partly because, as already  hinted, it was reckoned a heroic action to brave the anger of departed  heroes by violating their tombs; partly to attain the arms and swords of  proof with which the deceased had done their great actions. He set his  soldiers to work, and soon removed the earth and stones from one side of  the mound, and laid bare the entrance. But the stoutest of the rovers  started back when, instead of the silence of a tomb,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14466"],[0,"South African Memories (#18)"],[1,"impossible I could stand such a man dogging my  footsteps much longer. He promised to report the matter, and insisted on  shaking hands with great cordiality.    It was fortunate I had not accompanied De Koker, for that very evening  back came Mr. Keeley, who had luckily succeeded in satisfying the  suspicions of General Snyman, and who had received a permit to reside on  his farm during the war. He brought me a letter in Dutch from the same  authority, refusing, \"owing to the disturbed state of the country,\" to  give me a pass to Mafeking, and requesting me to remain where I was,  under the \"surveillance of his burghers.\" It was exactly the  surveillance of one of his said burghers I wished to avoid; but there  seemed no possibility of getting rid of Dietrich, who evidently  preferred his comfortable quarters at the hotel to roughing it in the  laager. I was exceedingly disappointed, and also somewhat indignant with  Mr. Keeley, who firmly believed, and was much cast down by, some  telegrams he had read out in the laager, relating the utter defeat of  15,000 English at the Modder River;[31] 1,500 Boers, he stated, had  surrounded this force, of which they had killed 2,000. I stoutly refused  to credit it till I had seen it in an English despatch. But all this was  enough to subdue the bravest spirit; we had received practically nothing  but Dutch information during the last six weeks, telling of their  successes and English disasters; we had seen nobody but our enemies.  Even if one did not allow oneself to believe their tales, there was  always a sort of uncomfortable feeling that these must contain some  element of truth. Fortunately, however, I was reading an account of the  Franco-German War in 1870, and there I found that the same system of  inventing successes was carried on by the French press right up to, and  even after, the Emperor's capitulation at Sedan. So it was comforting to  think that, if it had been necessary to keep up the spirits of paid and  regular soldiers, it must be a thousand times more essential for the  Transvaal authorities to do so, as regards their unpaid mixed army, who  had no encouragement to fight but knowledge of successes and hopes of  future loot. All the same, it was a great trial of patience.    FOOTNOTES:    [31] This news must have been a garbled account of the fighting with  Lord Methuen's column.          CHAPTER IX         HOW I WAS MADE A PRISONER--IN A BOER LAAGER         \"Ah, there, Piet! be'ind 'is stony kop,       With 'is Boer bread an' biltong, an' 'is flask of awful dop;       'Is mauser for amusement an' 'is pony for retreat,       I've known a lot o' fellers shoot a dam' sight worse than       Piet.\"--KIPLING.      Provisions at Setlagoli and in the surrounding districts were now fast  running out, and Mrs. Fraser announced to me one morning she had only  full allowance of meal for another week. In that colony no meal meant no  bread, and it was, in fact, the most important factor in the housewife's  mind when thinking of supplies. While on this subject, I must remark  what very excellent bread is that made by the Dutch; no matter how poor  or dilapidated the farmhouses, large loaves of beautiful, slightly  browned bread are always in evidence, baked by the mother or daughters.  The non-existence of the railway was beginning to cause much distress,  Dutch and English suffering alike. In fact, if it had not been for the  locusts, unusually numerous that year, and always a favourite food with  the natives, these latter would also have been starving. As every mouth  to feed was a consideration, I determined to see if I could personally  induce the Boer General to pass me into Mafeking. Under Mrs. Fraser's  charge I left my maid, as I did not wish to expose her to any hardships  in the laager; and to her I gave the custody of my pony Dop, to whom I  had become much attached. After detaining me a prisoner, the Boers  returned to Setlagoli specially to secure this animal; they had heard  the natives speak of her in terms of high appreciation, and describe her  as \"not a horse, but lightning.\" Metelka, with much spirit, declared the  pony to be her property, having been given her, she said, in lieu of  wages. She further stated she was a German subject, and that if her  horse were not returned in three days she should write to the Kaiser.  All this was repeated to General Snyman by the awestruck _Veldtcornet_.  After a week spent with the Boers, Dop arrived back at Setlagoli,  carefully led, as if she were a sacred beast, and bringing a humble  letter of apology from the Commandant.    But I am anticipating, and must return to my solitary drive to the  laager, accompanied only by Vellum and another black boy. I took the  precaution of despatching a nigger with a note to Mafeking, telling  Colonel Baden-Powell of my plan, and that, having heard a Dutch woman  called Mrs. Delpoort, in Mafeking, wished to join her friends in the  Transvaal, I intended asking General Snyman to exchange me for her. The  distance we had to drive was forty-five miles, along villainous sandy  roads and under a burning African sun. We outspanned for the second time  at the house of De Koker, who had been the first to advise me to visit  the laager. His dwelling was situated close to the railway-line, or,  rather, to where the railway-line had been. Here there was a great stir  and bustle; men were hurrying in and out, nearly all armed; horses were  tethered before the door; and, on hearing my cart drive up, the  _Veldtcornet_ himself came out to meet me, and gravely invited me to  descend. I now saw the interior of a typical Dutch house, with the  family at home. The _vrow_ came forward with hand outstretched in the  awkward Boer fashion. The Dutch do not shake hands; they simply extend a  wooden member, which you clasp, and the greeting is over. I had to go  through this performance in perfect silence with about seven or eight  children of various ages, a grown-up daughter, and eight or ten men,  most of whom followed us into the poky little room which appeared to  serve as a living-room for the whole family. Although past ten o'clock,  the remains of breakfast were still on the table, and were not  appetizing to look at. We sat down on chairs placed in a circle, the  whole party commencing to chatter volubly, and scarcely a word being  intelligible to me. Presently the _vrow_ brought me a cup of coffee in a  cracked cup and saucer. Not wishing to give offence, I tried to swallow  it; the coffee was not bad, if one could only have dissociated it from  that dreadful breakfast-table. I then produced some cigarettes, and  offered them to the male element. They were enchanted, laid aside their  pipes, and conversed with more animation than ever; but it was only  occasionally that I caught a word I could understand; the sentence \"twee  tozen Engelman dood\"[32] recurred with distressing frequency, and  enabled me to grasp their conversation was entirely about the war. I  meanwhile studied the room and its furniture, which was of the poorest  description; the chairs mostly lacked legs or backs, and the floor was  of mud, which perhaps was just as well, as they all spat on it in the  intervals of talk, and emptied on to it the remains of whatever they  were drinking. After a short time a black girl came in with a basin of  water, with which she proceeded to plentifully sprinkle the floor,  utterly disregarding our dresses and feet. Seeing all the women tuck  their feet under their knees, I followed their example, until this  improvised water-cart had finished its work. The grown-up daughter had a  baby in her arms, as uncared for as the other children, all of whom  looked as if soap and water never came their way. The men were fine,  strong-looking individuals, and all were very affable to me, or meant to  be so, if I could but have understood them. Finally four or five more  women came into this tiny overcrowded room, evidently visitors. This was  the finishing stroke, and I decided that, rested or not, the mules must  be inspanned, that I might leave this depressing house. One of the young  burghers brought me the pass to General Snyman, the caligraphy of which  he was evidently very proud of; and having taken leave of all the ladies  and men in the same peculiar stiff manner as that in which I had greeted  them, I drove off, devoutly thankful to be so far on my journey. About  four in the afternoon we came to a rise, and, looking over it, saw the  white roofs of Mafeking lying about five miles away in the glaring  sunlight. Then we arrived at the spot where General Cronje's laager had  been before he trekked South, marked by the grass being worn away for  nearly a square mile, by broken-down waggons, and by sundry aas-vogels  (the scavengers of South Africa) hovering over carcasses of horses or  cattle. Mafeking was now only three miles distant, and, seeing not a  solitary soul on the flat grass plains, I felt very much tempted to  drive in to the native stadt; but the black boys resolutely declined to  attempt it, as they feared being shot, and they assured me that many  Boer sharpshooters lay hidden in the scrub. Thinking discretion the  better part of valour, I regretfully turned away from Mafeking by the  road leading up an incline to the laager, still several miles distant.  The cart was suddenly brought to a standstill by almost driving into a  Boer outpost, crouched under a ruined wall, from which point of vantage  they were firing with their rifles at the advance trenches of the town.  The officer in charge of this party told me I must stay here till  sundown, when he and his men would accompany me to headquarters, as he  averred the road I was now pursuing was not safe from the Mafeking  gun-range. I therefore waited their good pleasure for an hour, during  which time the firing from all round the town went on in a desultory  sort of way, occasionally followed by a boom from a "]]]
