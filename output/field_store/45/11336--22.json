And the queen, while  Emilia led a dance, called for a song from Dioneo, who at once came out  with:--'Monna Aldruda, come perk up thy mood, a piece of glad tidings I  bring thee.' Whereat all the ladies fell a laughing, and most of all the  queen, who bade him give them no more of that, but sing another. Quoth  Dioneo:--\"Madam, had I a tabret, I would sing:--'Up with your smock,  Monna Lapa!' or:--'Oh! the greensward under the olive!' Or perchance you  had liefer I should give you:--'Woe is me, the wave of the sea!' But no  tabret have I: wherefore choose which of these others you will have.  Perchance you would like:--'Now hie thee to us forth, that so it may be  cut, as May the fields about.'\" \"No,\" returned the queen, \"give us  another.\" \"Then,\" said Dioneo, \"I will sing:--'Monna Simona, embarrel,  embarrel. Why, 'tis not the month of October.'\"(1) \"Now a plague upon  thee,\" said the queen, with a laugh; \"give us a proper song, wilt thou?  for we will have none of these.\" \"Never fear, Madam,\" replied Dioneo;  \"only say which you prefer. I have more than a thousand songs by heart.  Perhaps you would like:--'This my little covert, make I ne'er it overt';  or:--'Gently, gently, husband mine'; or:--'A hundred pounds were none too  high a price for me a cock to buy.'\" The queen now shewed some offence,  though the other ladies laughed, and:--\"A truce to thy jesting, Dioneo,\"  said she, \"and give us a proper song: else thou mayst prove the quality  of my ire.\" Whereupon Dioneo forthwith ceased his fooling, and sang on  this wise:--    So ravishing a light    Doth from the fair eyes of my mistress move    As keeps me slave to her and thee, O Love.    A beam from those bright orbs did radiate    That flame that through mine own eyes to my breast    Did whilom entrance gain.    Thy majesty, O Love, thy might, how great    They be, 'twas her fair face did manifest:    Whereon to brood still fain,    I felt thee take and chain    Each sense, my soul enthralling on such wise    That she alone henceforth evokes my sighs.    Wherefore, O dear my Lord, myself I own    Thy slave, and, all obedience, wait and yearn,    Till thy might me console.    Yet wot I not if it be throughly known    How noble is the flame wherewith I burn,    My loyalty how whole    To her that doth control    Ev'n in such sort my mind that shall I none,    Nor would I, peace receive, save hers alone.    And so I pray thee, sweet my Lord, that thou    Give her to feel thy fire, and shew her plain    How grievous my disease.    This service deign to render; for that now    Thou seest me waste for love, and in the pain    Dissolve me by degrees:    And then the apt moment seize    My cause to plead with her, as is but due    From thee to me, who fain with thee would sue.    When Dioneo's silence shewed that his song was ended, the queen accorded  it no stinted meed of praise; after which she caused not a few other  songs to be sung. Thus passed some part of the night; and then the queen,  taking note that its freshness had vanquished the heat of the day, bade  all go rest them, if they would, till the morning.    (1) The song is evidently amoebean.      --  Endeth here the fifth day of the Decameron, beginneth the sixth, wherein,  under the rule of Elisa, discourse is had of such as by some sprightly  sally have repulsed an attack, or by some ready retort or device have  avoided loss, peril or scorn.  --    Still in mid heaven, the moon had lost her radiance, nor was any part of  our world unillumined by the fresh splendour of the dawn, when, the queen  being risen and having mustered her company, they hied them, gently  sauntering, across the dewy mead some distance from the beautiful hill,  conversing now of this, now of the other matter, canvassing the stories,  their greater or less degree of beauty, and laughing afresh at divers of  their incidents, until, the sun being now in his higher ascendant, they  began to feel his heat, and turning back by common consent, retraced  their steps to the palace, where, the tables being already set, and  fragrant herbs and fair flowers strewn all about, they by the queen's  command, before it should grow hotter, addressed themselves to their  meal. So, having blithely breakfasted, they first of all sang some dainty  and jocund ditties, and then, as they were severally minded, composed  them to sleep or sat them down to chess or dice, while Dioneo and  Lauretta fell a singing of Troilus and Cressida.    The hour of session being come, they took their places, at the queen's  summons, in their wonted order by the fountain; but, when the queen was  about to call for the first story, that happened which had not happened  before; to wit, there being a great uproar in the kitchen among the maids  and men, the sound thereof reached the ears of the queen and all the  company. Whereupon the queen called the seneschal and asked him who  bawled so loud, and what was the occasion of the uproar. The seneschal  made answer that 'twas some contention between Licisca and Tindaro; but  the occasion he knew not, having but just come to quiet them, when he  received her summons. The queen then bade him cause Licisca and Tindaro  to come thither forthwith: so they came, and the queen enquired of them  the cause of the uproar. Tindaro was about to make answer, when Licisca,  who was somewhat advanced in years, and disposed to give herself airs,  and heated to the strife of words, turned to Tindaro, and scowling upon  him said:--\"Unmannerly varlet that makest bold to speak before me; leave  me to tell the story.\" Then, turning to the queen, she said:--\"Madam,  this fellow would fain instruct me as to Sicofante's wife, and--neither  more or less--as if I had not known her well--would have me believe that,  the first night that Sicofante lay with her, 'twas by force and not  without effusion of blood that Master Yard made his way into Dusky Hill;  which I deny, averring that he met with no resistance, but, on the  contrary, with a hearty welcome on the part of the garrison. And such a  numskull is he as fondly to believe that the girls are so simple as to  let slip their opportunities, while they wait on the caprice of father or  brothers, who six times out of seven delay to marry them for three or  four years after they should. Ay, ay indeed, doubtless they were well  advised to tarry so long! Christ's faith! I should know the truth of what  I swear; there is never a woman in my neighbourhood whose husband had her  virginity; and well I know how many and what manner of tricks our married  dames play their husbands; and yet this booby would fain teach me to know  women as if I were but born yesterday.\"    While Licisca thus spoke, the ladies laughed till all their teeth were  ready to start from their heads. Six times at least the queen bade her be  silent: but all in vain; she halted not till she had said all that she  had a mind to. When she had done, the queen turned with a smile to Dioneo  saying:--\"This is a question for thee to deal with, Dioneo; so hold  thyself in readiness to give final judgment upon it, when our stories are  ended.\" \"Madam,\" replied Dioneo forthwith, \"I give judgment without more  ado: I say that Licisca is in the right; I believe that 'tis even as she  says, and that Tindaro is a fool.\" Whereupon Licisca burst out laughing,  and turning to Tindaro:--\"Now did I not tell thee so?\" quoth she. \"Begone  in God's name: dost think to know more than I, thou that art but a  sucking babe? Thank God, I have not lived for nothing, not I.\" And had  not the queen sternly bade her be silent, and make no more disturbance,  unless she had a mind to be whipped, and sent both her and Tindaro back  to the kitchen, the whole day would have been spent in nought but  listening to her. So Licisca and Tindaro having withdrawn, the queen  charged Filomena to tell the first story: and gaily thus Filomena began.      NOVEL I.    --  A knight offers to carry Madonna Oretta a horseback with a story, but  tells it so ill that she prays him to dismount her.  --    As stars are set for an ornament in the serene expanse of heaven, and  likewise in springtime flowers and leafy shrubs in the green meadows, so,  damsels, in the hour of rare and excellent discourse, is wit with its  bright sallies. Which, being brief, are much more proper for ladies than  for men, seeing that prolixity of speech, where brevity is possible, is  much less allowable to them. But for whatever cause, be it the sorry  quality of our understanding, or some especial enmity that heaven bears  to our generation, few ladies or none are left to-day that, when occasion  prompts, are able to meet it with apt speech, ay, or if aught of the kind  they hear, can understand it aright: to our common shame be it spoken!  But as, touching this matter, enough has already been said by  Pampinea,(1) I purpose not to enlarge thereon; but, that you may know  what excellence resides in speech apt for the occasion, I am minded to  tell you after how courteous a fashion a lady imposed silence upon a  gentleman.    'Tis no long time since there dwelt in our city a lady, noble, debonair  and of excellent discourse, whom not a few of you may have seen or heard  of, whose name--for such high qualities merit not oblivion--was Madonna  Oretta, her husband being Messer Geri Spina. Now this lady, happening to  be, as we are, in the country, moving from place to place for pleasure  with a company of ladies and gentlemen, whom she had entertained the day  before at breakfast at her house, and the place of their next sojourn,  whither they were to go afoot, being some considerable distance off, one  of the gentlemen of the company said to her:--\"Madonna Oretta, so please  you, I will carry you great part of the way a horseback with one of the  finest stories in the world.\" \"Indeed, Sir,\" replied the lady, \"I pray  you do so; and I shall deem it the greatest of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13117"],[0,"The Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds, Volume 1 (#18)"],[1,"  moderately deep cup, composed almost entirely of dry, coarser and  finer, tendrils of creepers, and is lined with a some black moss-roots  and a few scraps of dead leaves. It contained three fresh eggs.    Numerous nests of this species subsequently sent me from Sikhim are  all of the same type, all moderately deep cups composed entirely of  creeper-tendrils, the cavity only being lined with fine black roots.  They appear from the specimens before me to be quite _sui generis_ and  unlike those of any of its congeners. No grass, no dead leaves, no  moss seems to be employed; nothing but the tendrils of some creeper.  The nests appear to be always placed at the fork, where three, four,  or more shoots diverge, and to be generally more or less like inverted  cones, measuring say 4 to 5 inches in height, and about the same in  breadth at the top, while the cavities are about 3 inches in diameter  and 1.5 to 2 in depth. The nests appear to have been found at very  varying heights from the ground from 5 to 15 feet, and at elevations  of from 3000 to 5000 feet. They appear to have contained three fresh  or more or less incubated eggs.    The eggs were found in Sikhim on different dates between 25th May and  8th September.    Exceptional as the coloration of the eggs of this species may seem,  there is no doubt that they are pure white. The shell is thin and  fragile, but has generally a decided gloss, and the eggs are  typically elongated ovals, obtuse-ended, and more or less pyriform or  cylindrical. The eggs vary from 0.92 to 1.13 in length, and from 0.75  to 0.8 in breadth, but the average of eleven eggs is 1.06 by 0.77  nearly.      82. Trochalopterum erythrocephalum (Vig.). _The Red-headed  Laughing-Thrush_.    Trochalopteron erythrocephalum (_Vig.), Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 43;  _Hume, Rough Draft N. & E._ no. 415.    From Kumaon westwards, at any rate as far as the valley of the Beas,  the Red-headed Laughing-Thrush is, next to _T. lineatum_, the most  common species of the genus. It lays in May and June, at elevations of  from 4000 to 7000 feet, building on low branches of trees, at a height  of from 3 to 10 feet from, the ground.    The nests are composed chiefly of dead leaves bound round into a deep  cup with delicate fronds of ferns and coarse and fine grass, the  cavities being scantily lined with fine grass and moss-roots. It is  difficult by any description to convey an adequate idea of the beauty  of some of these nests--the deep red-brown of the withered ferns,  the black of the grass- and moss-roots, the pale yellow of the broad  flaggy grass, and the straw-yellow of some of the finer grass-stems,  all blended together into an artistic wreath, in the centre of which  the beautiful sky-blue and maroon-spotted eggs repose. Externally the  nests may average about 6 inches in diameter, but the egg-cavity is  comparatively large and very regular, measuring about 31/2 inches across  and fully 21/4 inches in depth. Some nests of course are less regular  and artistic in their appearance, but, as a rule, those of this  species are particularly beautiful.    The eggs vary from two to four in number.    Sir E.C. Buck sent me the following note:--    \"I found a nest of this species near Narkunda (about 30 miles north of  Simla) on the 26th June. It was placed on the branch of a banj tree,  some 8 feet from the ground, and contained two eggs, half set. Nest  and eggs forwarded.\"    Dr. Jerdon says that Shore, as quoted by Gould in his 'Century,' says  that \"it is by no means uncommon in Kumaon, where it frequents shady  ravines, building in hollows and their precipitous sides, and making  its nest of small sticks and grasses, the eggs being five in number,  of a sky-blue colour.\" But Shore, as the showman would say, is, so far  as eggs and nests are concerned, \"a fabulous writer,\" and the eggs  are always more or less spotted, and no nest that I ever saw of this  species was composed of \"small sticks.\"    Mr. Blyth says:--\"Mr. Hodgson figures a green egg, spotted much like  that of _Turdus musicus_, as that of the present species;\" but in all  Hodgson's drawings this _green_ represents a _greenish blue_, as I  have tested in dozens of cases.    Colonel G.F.L. Marshall remarks:--\"I found a nest of this species on  the 15th May at Nynee Tal on the top of Ayar Pata, at an elevation of  about 7500 feet above the sea. The nest was a rather deep cup, neatly  made and placed about 5 feet from the ground amongst the outer twigs  of a thick barberry bush, the leaves of which entirely concealed it.  It was composed of a thick layer of dead oak- and rhododendron-leaves,  bound round outside with just enough of grass-stems and moss to  keep the leaves in place; it had no lining of any description. The  egg-cavity was 31/2 inches broad by nearly 21/2 inches deep. The eggs, two  in number, were blue, with a few spots, streaks, and scrawls of brown  tending to form a zone at the larger end. They were large for the  size of the bird. The ground-colour was like that of the eggs of a  Song-Thrush in England.    \"Several more nests found subsequently with eggs up to 4th June were  similar in structure, but placed in small oak trees from 5 to 15 or 18  feet from the ground.    \"I found a nest of this species containing a single hard-set egg on  the 17th August; both parent-birds were by the nest; this is unusually  late, the chief breeding-month being June.\"    The eggs are very long ovals, of a delicate pale greenish-blue  ground-colour, with a few spots, streaks, and streaky blotches of a  very rich though slightly brownish red at the large end. These eggs,  though somewhat longer in shape and less freely marked, are exactly  of the same type as those of _T. cachinnans_ and _T. variegatum_. The  texture of the shell is very fine and compact, and they have a slight  gloss. In some eggs the spottings are more numerous, and, besides the  primary markings already mentioned, a few purple spots and blotches,  mostly very pale, are intermingled with the darker markings. In almost  all the eggs that I have seen the markings were absolutely confined to  the larger end.    In length the eggs vary from 1.15 to 1.22, and in breadth from 0.8 to  0.86; but the average is about 1.2 by 0.82.      85. Trochalopterum nigrimentum, Hodgs. _The Western Yellow-winged  Laughing-Thrush_.    Trochalopteron chrysopterum (_Gould), apud Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 43;  _Hume, Rough Draft N. & E._ no. 416.    The Western Yellow-winged Laughing-Thrush breeds, so far as is yet  known, only in Nepal, Sikhim, and Bhootan, from all which localities  we have quite young birds, but no eggs.    Dr. Jerdon says:--\"The eggs are greenish blue, in a nest neatly made  with roots and moss.\" This, of course, is wrong, as the eggs are now  well known to be spotted.    From Sikhim, Mr. Gammie writes:--\"The Yellow-winged Laughing-Thrush  breeds from April to June at elevations from 5500 feet upwards. It  prefers scrubby jungle, and places its nest in bushes about six feet  or so from the ground. It is a broad, cup-shaped structure, neatly and  strongly made of fine twigs and dry grass-leaves, lined with roots and  with a few strings of green moss wound round the outside. Externally,  it measures about 6 inches wide, and 41/2 deep; internally 31/4 by 21/2.    \"The eggs are usually three in number.\"    Six nests of this species found between the 4th May and 2nd July in  Native and British Sikhim were sent me by Mr. Mandelli. They were  placed in small trees or dense bushes at heights of from 3 to 8 feet,  and contained in some cases two, and in others three fresh or fully  incubated eggs, so that sometimes the bird only lays two eggs. Three  nests were also sent me by Mr. Gammie, taken in the neighbourhood of  the Sikhim Cinchona-Plantations. All are precisely of the same type,  all constructed with the same materials, but owing to the different  proportions in which these are used some of the nests at first sight  seem to differ widely from others. Some also are a good deal bigger  than others, but all are massive, deep cups, varying from 5.25 to 6.5  inches in diameter, and from 3 to fully 4 in height externally; the  cavities vary from 3 to 3.5 in diameter, and from 2 to 2.5 in depth.  The body of the nests is composed of grass; the cavity is lined first  with dry leaves, and then thickly or thinly with black fibrous roots.  Externally the nest is more or less bound together by creepers and  stems of herbaceous plants. Sometimes only a few strings of moss and a  few sprays of _Selaginella_ are to be seen on the outside of the nest;  while, on the other hand, in some nests the entire outer surface is  completely covered over with green moss, not only on the sides, but  on the upper margin, so as to conceal completely the rest of the  materials of the nest, and in all the nine nests before me the extent  to which the moss is used varies.    The eggs of this species are typically somewhat elongated ovals, some  are much pointed towards the small end, others are somewhat pyriform,  and others again are subcylindrical. The shell is fine and soft, but  has only a moderate amount of gloss. The ground-colour, which varies  very little in shade, is a delicate pale, slightly greenish blue,  almost precisely the same colour as that of _Trochalopterum  erythrocephalum_. The eggs are sparingly (in fact, almost exclusively  about the large end) marked with deep chocolate. These markings are  in some spots and blotches, but in many assume the form of thicker or  thinner hieroglyphic lines. As a rule, three fourths of the egg is  spotless, occasionally a single speck or spot occurs towards the small  end of the egg. One or two eggs are almost spotless. In length the  eggs vary from 1.1 to 1.23, and in breadth from 0.73 to 0.87, but the  average of sixteen eggs is 1.17 nearly by 0.82.      87.
