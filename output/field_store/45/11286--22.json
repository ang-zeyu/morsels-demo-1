On the other hand, if the imperial army put off fighting, they could not  help breaking up; they had exhausted their victuals, and the leaders  their money; they were keeping the field without receiving pay, and were  subsisting, so to speak, without resources.  The prudent Marquis of  Pescara himself was for bringing on a battle, which was indispensable.  \"A hundred years in the field,\" said he, in the words of an old Italian  proverb, \"are better than one day of fighting, for one may lose in a  doubtful melley what one was certain of winning by skilful manoeuvres;  but when one can no longer keep the field, one must risk a battle, so as  not to give the enemy the victory without a fight.\"  The same question  was being discussed in the French camp.  The veteran captains, La  Tremoille and Chabannes, were of opinion that by remaining in the strong  position in which they were encamped they would conquer without fighting.  Bonnivet and De Montmorency were of the contrary opinion.  \"We French,\"  said Bonnivet, \"have not been wont to make war by means of military  artifices, but handsomely and openly, especially when we have at our head  a valiant king, who is enough to make the veriest dastards fight.  Our  kings bring victory with them, as our little king Charles VIII. did at  the Taro, our king Louis XII. at Agnadello, and our king who is here  present at Melegnano.\"  Francis I. was not the man to hold out against  such sentiments and such precedents; and he decided to accept battle as  soon as it should be offered him.  The imperial leaders, at a council  held on the 23d of February, determined to offer it next day.  Bourbon  vigorously supported the opinion of Pescara.    Antony de Leyva was notified the same evening of their decision, and was  invited to make, as soon as he heard two cannon-shots, a sortie which  would place the French army between two fires.  Pescara, according to his  custom, mustered the Spaniards; and, \"My lads,\" said he, \"fortune has  brought you to such extremity that on the soil of Italy you have for your  own only that which is under your feet.  All the emperor's might could  not procure for you to-morrow morning one morsel of bread.  We know not  where to get it, save in the Frenchman's camp, which is before your eyes.  There they have abundance of everything, bread, meat, trout and carp from  the Lake of Garda.  And so, my lads, if you are set upon having anything  to eat tomorrow, march we down on the Frenchmen's camp.\"  Freundsberg  spoke in the same style to the German lanzknechts.  And both were  responded to with cheers.  Eloquence is mighty powerful when it speaks in  the name of necessity.    The two armies were of pretty equal strength: they had each from twenty  to five and twenty thousand infantry, French, Germans, Spaniards,  lanzknechts, and Swiss.  Francis I. had the advantage in artillery and in  heavy cavalry, called at that time the gendarmerie, that is to say, the  corps of men-at-arms in heavy armor with their servants; but his troops  were inferior in effectives to the Imperialists, and Charles V.'s two  generals, Bourbon and Pescara, were, as men of war, far superior to  Francis I. and his favorite Bonnivet.  In the night between the 23d and  24th of February they opened a breach of forty or fifty fathoms in the  wall around the park of Mirabello, where the French camp was situated; a  corps immediately passed through it, marching on Pavia to re-enforce the  garrison, and the main body of the imperial army entered the park to  offer the French battle on that ground.  The king at once set his army in  motion; and his well-posted artillery mowed down the corps of Germans and  Spaniards who had entered the park.  \"You could see nothing,\" says a  witness of the battle, \"but heads and arms flying about.\"  The action  seemed to be going ill for the Imperialists; Pescara urged the Duke of  Bourbon and Lannoy, the Viceroy of Naples, to make haste and come up;  Lannoy made the sign of the cross, and said to his men, \"There is no hope  but in God; follow me and do every one as I do.\"  Francis I., on his  side, advanced with the pick of his men-at-arms, burst on the  advance-guard of the enemy, broke it, killed with his own hand the  Marquis of Civita-San-Angelo, and dispersed the various corps he found in  his way.  In the confidence of his joy he thought the victory decided,  and, turning to Marshal de Foix, who was with him, \"M. de Lescun,\" said  he, \"now am I fain to call myself Duke of Milan.\"  But Bourbon and  Pescara were not the men to accept a defeat so soon; they united all  their forces, and resumed the offensive at all points; the French  batteries, masked by an ill-considered movement on the part of their own  troops, who threw themselves between them and the enemy, lost all  serviceability; and Pescara launched upon the French gendarmerie fifteen  hundred Basque arquebusiers, whom he had exercised and drilled to  penetrate into the midst of the horses, shoot both horses and riders, and  fall back rapidly after having discharged their pieces.  Being attacked  by the German lanzknechts of Bourbon and Freundsberg, the Swiss in the  French service did not maintain their renown, and began to give way.  \"My  God, what is all this!\" cried Francis I., seeing them waver, and he  dashed towards them to lead them back into action; but neither his  efforts, nor those of John of Diesbach and the Lord of Fleuranges, who  were their commanders, were attended with success.  The king was only  the more eager for the fray; and, rallying around him all those of his  men-at-arms who would neither recoil nor surrender, he charged the  Imperialists furiously, throwing himself into the thickest of the melley,  and seeking in excess of peril some chance of victory; but Pescara,  though wounded in three places, was none the less stubbornly fighting on,  and Antony de Leyva, governor of Pavia, came with the greater part of the  garrison to his aid.  At this very moment Francis I.  heard that the  first prince of the blood, his brother-in-law the Duke of Alencon, who  commanded the rear-guard, had precipitately left the field of battle.  The oldest and most glorious warriors of France, La Tremoille, Marshal de  Chabannes, Marshal de Foix, the grand equerry San Severino, the Duke of  Suffolk, Francis of Lorraine, Chaumont, Bussy d'Amboise, and Francis de  Duras fell, here and there, mortally wounded.  At this sight Admiral  Bonnivet in despair exclaimed, \"I can never survive this fearful havoc;\"  and raising the visor of his helmet, he rushed to meet the shots which  were aimed at him, and in his turn fell beside his comrades in arms.  Bourbon had expressly charged his men to search everywhere in the melley  for the admiral, and bring him in a prisoner.  When, as he passed along  that part of the battle-field, he recognized the corpse, \"Ah! wretch,\" he  cried, as he moved away, \"it is thou who hast caused the ruin of France  and of me!\"  Amidst these dead and dying, Francis still fought on;  wounded as he was in the face, the arms, and the legs, he struck right  and left with his huge sword, and cut down the nearest of his assailants;  but his horse, mortally wounded, dragged him down as it fell; he was up  again in an instant, and, standing beside his horse, he laid low two more  Spaniards who were pressing him closely; the ruck of the soldiers crowded  about him; they did not know him, but his stature, his strength, his  bravery, his coat of mail studded with golden lilies, and his helmet  overshadowed by a thick plume of feathers pointed him out to all as the  finest capture to make; his danger was increasing every minute, when one  of Bourbon's most intimate confidants, the Lord of Pomperant, who, in  1523, had accompanied the constable in his flight through France, came up  at this critical moment, recognized the king, and, beating off the  soldiers with his sword, ranged himself at the king's side, represented  to-him the necessity of yielding, and pressed him to surrender to the  Duke of Bourbon, who was not far off.  \"No,\" said the king, \"rather die  than pledge my faith to a traitor where is the Viceroy of Naples?\"  It  took some time to find Lannoy; but at last he arrived and put one knee on  the ground before Francis I., who handed his sword to him.  Lannoy took  it with marks of the most profound respect, and immediately gave him  another.  The battle was over, and Francis I. was Charles V.'s prisoner.    [Illustration: Capture of Francis I.----91]    He had shown himself an imprudent and unskilful general, but at the same  time a hero.  His conquerors, both officers and privates, could not help,  whilst they secured his person, showing their admiration for him.  When  he sat down to table, after having had his wounds, which were slight,  attended to, Bourbon approached him respectfully and presented him with a  dinner-napkin; and the king took it without embarrassment and with frigid  and curt politeness.  He next day granted him an interview, at which an  accommodation took place with due formalities on both sides, but nothing  more.  All the king's regard was for the Marquis of Pescara, who came to  see him in a simple suit of black, in order, as it were, to share his  distress.  \"He was a perfect gentleman,\" said Francis I., \"both in peace  and in war.\"  He heaped upon him marks of esteem and almost of  confidence.  \"How do you think,\" he asked, \"the emperor will behave to  me?\"  \"I think,\" replied Pescara, \"I can answer for the emperor's  moderation; I am sure that he will make a generous use of his victory.  If, however, he were capable of forgetting what is due to your rank, your  merits, and your misfortunes, I would never cease to remind him of it,  and I would lose what little claim upon him my services may have given  me, or you should be satisfied with his behavior.\"  The king embraced him  warmly.  He asked to be excused"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11956"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 6 (#18)"],[1,", that he  was excused from serving against Spain, and he contented himself with  superintending at Bordeaux the service of the commissariat.  The French  army, however, crossed the frontier in the month of March, 1719.  \"The  Regent may send a French army whenever he pleases,\" wrote Alberoni, on  the 21st November, 1718; \"proclaim publicly that there will not be a shot  fired, and that the king our master will have provisions ready to receive  them.\"  He had brought the king, the queen, and the prince of the  Asturias into the camp; Philip V. fully expected the desertion of the  French army in a mass.  Not a soul budged; some refugees made an attempt  to tamper with certain officers of their acquaintance; their messenger  was hanged in the middle of Marshal Berwick's camp.  Fontarabia, St.  Sebastian, and the Castle of Urgel fell before long into the power of the  French; another division burned, at the port of Los Pasages, six vessels  which chanced to be on the stocks; an English squadron destroyed those at  Centera and in the port of Vigo.  Everywhere the depots were committed to  the flames: this cruel and destructive war against an enemy whose best  troops were fighting far away, and who was unable to offer more than a  feeble resistance, gratified the passions and the interests of England  rather than of France.  \"It was, of course, necessary,\" said Berwick,  \"that the English government should be able to convince the next  Parliament that nothing had been spared to diminish the navy of Spain.\"  During this time the English fleet and the emperor's troops were keeping  up an attack in Sicily upon the Spanish troops, who made a heroic  defence, but were without resources or re-enforcements, and were  diminishing, consequently, every day.  The Marquis of Leyden no longer  held anything but Palermo and the region round AEtna.    Alberoni had attempted to create a diversion by hurling into the midst  of France the brand of civil war.  Brittany, for a long time past  discontented with its governor, the Marquis of Montesquiou, and lately  worked upon by the agents of the Duchess of Maine, was ripe for revolt;  a few noblemen took up arms, and called upon the peasants to enter the  forest with them, that is, to take the field.  Philip V. had promised the  assistance of a fleet, and had supplied some money.  But the peasants did  not rise, the Spanish ships were slow to arrive, the enterprise attempted  against the Marquis of Montesquiou failed, the conspirators were  surrounded in the forest of Noe, near Rennes; a great number were made  prisoners and taken away to Nantes, where a special chamber inquired into  the case against them.  Three noblemen and one priest perished on the  scaffold.    Insurrection, as well as desertion and political opposition, had been a  failure; Philip V. was beaten at home as well as in Sicily.  The Regent  succeeded in introducing to the presence of the King of Spain an unknown  agent, who managed to persuade the monarch that the cardinal was shirking  his responsibility before Europe, asserting that the king and queen had  desired the war, and that he had confined himself to gratifying their  passions.  The Duke of Orleans said, at the same time, quite openly, that  he made war not against Philip V. or against Spain, but against Alberoni  only.  Lord Stanhope declared, in the name of England, that no peace was  possible, unless its preliminary were the dismissal of the pernicious  minister. The fall of Alberoni was almost as speedy as that which he had  but lately contrived for his enemy the Princess des Ursins.  On the 4th  of December, 1719, he received orders to quit Madrid within eight days  and Spain under three weeks.  He did not see the king or queen again, and  retired first to Genoa, going by France, and then finally to Rome.  He  took with him an immense fortune.  It was discovered, after his  departure, that he had placed amongst the number of his treasures, the  authentic will of Charles II., securing the throne of Spain to Philip V.  He was pursued, his luggage ransacked, and the precious document  recovered.  Alberoni had restored order in the internal administration  of Spain; he had cleared away many abuses; Italian as he was, he had  resuscitated Spanish ambition.  \"I requickened a corpse,\" he used to say.  His views were extensive and daring, but often chimerical; he had reduced  to a nullity the sovereign whom he governed for so long, keeping him shut  up far away from the world, in a solitude which he was himself almost the  only one to interrupt.  \"The queen has the devil in her,\" he used to say;  \"if she finds a man of the sword who has some mental resources and is a  pretty good general, she will make a racket in France and in Europe.\"  The queen did not find a general; and on the 17th of February, 1720,  peace was signed at the Hague between Spain and the powers in coalition  against her, to the common satisfaction of France and Spain, whom so many  ties already united.  The haughty Elizabeth Farnese looked no longer to  anybody but the Duke of Orleans for the elevation of her children.    So great success in negotiation, however servile had been his bearing,  had little by little increased the influence of Dubois over his master.  The Regent knew and despised him, but he submitted to his sway and  yielded to his desires, sometimes to his fancies.  Dubois had for a long  while comprehended that the higher dignities of the church could alone  bring him to the grandeur of which he was ambitious; yet everything about  him seemed to keep them out of his reach, his scandalous life, his  perpetual intrigues, the baseness, not of his origin, but of his  character and conduct; nevertheless, the see of Cambrai having become  vacant by the death of Cardinal de la Tremoille, Dubois conceived the  hope of obtaining it.  \"Impudent as he was,\" says St. Simon, \"great as  was the sway he had acquired over his master, he found himself very much  embarrassed, and masked his effrontery by ruse; he told the Duke of  Orleans that he had dreamed a funny dream, that he was Archbishop of  Cambrai.  The Regent, who saw what he was driving at, answered him in a  tone of contempt, 'Thou, Archbishop of Cambrai! thou hast no thought of  such a thing?'  And the other persisting, he bade him think of all the  scandal of his life.  Dubois had gone too far to stop on so fine a road,  and quoted to him precedents, of which there were, unfortunately, only  too many.  The Duke of Orleans, less moved by such bad reasons than put  to it how to resist the suit of a man whom he was no longer wont to dare  gainsay in anything, sought to get out of the affair.  'Why! who would  consecrate thee?'  'Ah! if that's all,' replied Dubois, cheerfully, 'the  thing is done.  I know well who will consecrate me; but is that all, once  more?'  'Well! who?' asked the Regent.  'Your premier almoner; there he  is, outside; he will ask nothing better.'  And he embraces the legs of  the Duke of Orleans,--who remains stuck and caught without having the  power to refuse,--goes out, draws aside the Bishop of Nantes, tells him  that he himself has got Cambrai, begs him to consecrate him,--who  promises immediately,--comes in again, capers, returns thanks, sings  praises, expresses wonder, seals the matter more and more surely by  reckoning it done, and persuading the Regent that it is so, who never  dared say no.  That is how Dubois made himself Archbishop of Cambrai.\"    He was helped, it is said, by a strange patron.  Destouches, charge  d'affaires in London, who was kept well informed by Dubois, went to see  George I., requesting him to write to the Regent, recommending to him the  negotiator of the treaties.  The king burst out laughing.  \"How can you  ask a Protestant prince,\" said he, \"to mix himself up with the making of  an archbishop in France?  The Regent will laugh at the idea, as I do, and  will do nothing of the sort.\"  \"Pardon me, sir,\" rejoined Destouches, \"he  will laugh, but he will do it, first out of regard for your Majesty, and  then because he will think it a good joke.  I beseech your Majesty to be  pleased to sign the letter I have here already written.\"  King George  signed, and the adroit Dubois became Archbishop of Cambrai.  He even  succeeded in being consecrated, not only by the Bishop of Nantes, but  also by Cardinal Rohan and by Massillon, one of the glories of the French  episcopate, a timid man and a poor one, in despite of his pious  eloquence.  The Regent, as well as the whole court, was present at the  ceremony, to the great scandal of the people attached to religion.  Dubois received all the orders on the same day; and, when he was joked  about it, he brazen-facedly called to mind the precedent of St. Ambrose.  Dubois henceforth cast his eyes upon the cardinal's hat, and his  negotiations at Rome were as brisk as those of Alberoni had but lately  been with the same purpose.    Amidst so much defiance of decency and public morality, in the presence  of such profound abuse of sacred things, God did not, nevertheless,  remain without testimony, and his omnipotent justice had spoken.  On the  21st of July, 1719, the Duchess of Berry, eldest daughter of the Regent,  had died at the Palais-Royal, at barely twenty-four years of age; her  health, her beauty, and her wit were not proof against the irregular life  she had led.  Ere long a more terrible cry arose from one of the chief  cities of the kingdom.  \"The plague,\" they said, \"is at Marseilles,  brought, none knows how, on board a ship from the East.\"  The terrible  malady had by this time been brooding for a month in the most populous  quarters without anybody's daring to give it its real name.  \"The public  welfare demands,\" said Chancellor d'Aguesseau, \"that the people should be  persuaded that the plague is not contagious, and that the ministry should  behave as if it were persuaded of the contrary.\"  Meanwhile emigration  was"]]]
