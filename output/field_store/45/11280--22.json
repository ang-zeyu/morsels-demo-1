The Moors have signs, which they have agreed upon among themselves, to  inform each other at a distance when they have found water. As the sands of  the desert lie in undulations, and the surface of these plains has the  appearance of a sea, broken in large waves, which, by some sudden  enchantment, had been fixed and suspended before they could fall back; it  is on the ridges of these motionless waves, that the Moors in general  travel, unless they run in a direction too different from that of their  intended route, in which case they are obliged to traverse them; but  besides, as these ridges themselves are not always ranged parallel to each  other, but frequently cross each other, the Moors always have some of their  party before, to serve as guides, and to point out by signs with their  hands, at every crossing, on which side they ought to go; and also every  thing which prudence requires they should know before hand, as well as the  water, or rather the moisture and verdure which are to be perceived. In  general, these people who approach the sea-coast during the winds and  hurricanes of the summer solstice, rarely keep on the breach properly so  called, because they and their cattle are too much tormented by myriads of  flies which never quit the sea-coast. In this same season the appearance of  the gnats, or mosquitoes, induces them to remove from the Senegal, for  their cattle being incessantly stung by these animals, become mad and sick.    Our people met with some of these Moors, and in some measure forced them to  serve as guides; after continuing their march along the sea-coast, they  perceived on the morning of the 11th, the Argus brig, which was cruising to  assist those who had landed; as soon as the brig perceived them, it  approached very near to the coast, lay-to, and sent a boat on shore with  biscuit and wine.    On the 11th, in the evening, they met with more of the natives, and an  Irish captain of a merchant ship, who, of his own accord, had come from St.  Louis with the intention of assisting the sufferers: he spoke the language  of the country, and had put on the same dress as the Moors. We are sorry  that we cannot recollect the name of this foreign officer, which we should  take particular pleasure in publishing; but since time has effaced it from  our memory, we will at least publish his zeal and noble efforts, which are  an unquestionable title to the gratitude of every man of feeling. At last,  after the most cruel sufferings and privations, the unfortunate men who  composed the crews of the great-boat, and of that which we called the  Senegal boat, twenty-five men from the long-boat, and fifteen persons from  the pirogue, arrived at Saint Louis, on the 13th of July, at seven o'clock  in the evening, after having wandered above five whole days, in the midst  of these frightful deserts, which on all sides presented to their eyes only  the most profound solitude, and the prospect of inevitable destruction.    During their progress, they had to struggle with the most dreadful extremes  of hunger and thirst; the latter was such, that the first time that several  of them discovered water in the desert, such selfishness was manifested  that those who had found these beneficent springs, knelt down four or five  together, near the hole which they had just dug, and there, with their eyes  fixed on the water, made signs to their comrades not to approach them; that  they had found the springs, and that they alone had a right to drink at  them; it was not till after the most urgent supplications that they granted  a little water to their wretched companions, who were consumed by a raging  thirst. When they met with any Moors, they obtained some assistance from  them; but these barbarians carried their inhumanity so far as to refuse to  shew them the springs which are scattered along the shore: sordid avarice  made them act in this manner to these unhappy people; for when the latter  had passed a well, the Moors drew water from it, which they sold to them at  a gourd for a glass; they exacted the same price for a small handful of  millet. When the brig approached the coast, to assist these unfortunate  men, a great many of the natives of the country immediately crowned the  heights; their number was so great, that it caused some fear in the French,  who immediately formed, in order of battle, under the command of a captain  of infantry. Two officers went to ask the chiefs of the Moors what were  their intentions? whether they desired peace or war? They gave the officers  to understand that far from wishing to act as enemies, they were willing to  afford the shipwrecked people all the assistance in their power; but these  barbarians shewed, on all occasions, a perfidiousness which is peculiar to  the inhabitants of these climates; when the brig had sent biscuit on shore,  they seized the half of it, and a few moments after, sold it at an  exorbitant price, to those from whom they had stolen it. If they met with  any soldiers or sailors who had had the imprudence to stray from the main  body, they stripped them entirely, and then ill treated them; it was only  numbers united, which, inspiring them with fear, that did not receive any  insult from them; besides, there exists between the chiefs of these tribes  and the government of the Isle of St. Louis, a treaty, in which it is  stipulated that a large reward shall be given to the Moors, who meet in the  desert with persons that have been shipwrecked, and bring them to the  European factory: these barbarians were therefore induced by their  interest, and if they brought back those who went astray, it was only in  hope of obtaining a reward.    The women and young children inspired the greatest pity. These feeble  beings could not put their delicate feet on the burning sands, and were  besides incapable of walking for any length of time. The officers  themselves assisted the children, and carried them in turn: their example  induced others to imitate them; but having met with some Moors, who never  travel in these deserts without having their camels and their asses with  them, all that were not able to walk, mounted these animals: to obtain this  indulgence, it was necessary to pay two gourds for a day; so that it was  impossible for Mr. Picard, who had a numerous family, to bear so great an  expence: his respectable young ladies were therefore obliged to walk.    One day at noon, which was the hour for halting, the eldest of these young  ladies, exhausted with fatigue, withdrew to a solitary place to take some  moments rest. She fell asleep upon the beach; to guard herself from the  mosquitoes, she had covered her breast and face with a large shawl. While  every body was sleeping, one of the Moors who served as guides, either from  curiosity, or some other motive, approached her softly, attentively  examined her appearance, and not content with this, lifting up the shawl,  looked at her with fixed eyes, remained for a few moments like one  profoundly astonished, approached her then very near, but did not venture  to touch her. After having looked at her for some time, he let fall the  veil, and returned to his place, where he joyfully related to his comrades  what he had just seen. Several Frenchmen who had perceived the Moor,  informed Mr. Picard, who resolved, on the obliging offers of the officers,  to dress these ladies in a military dress, which, for the future, prevented  all attempts of the inhabitants of the desert.    Before they arrived at the Senegal, the Irish officer, of whom we have  already spoken, bought an ox: it was immediately killed; they collected  such combustibles as they could find, and when the animal was divided into  as many portions as there were persons, each fixed his portion to the end  of his sabre or bayonet, and thus they prepared a repast which they found  delicious.    During the whole time they remained in the desert, biscuit, wine and  brandy, in very small quantities, had been their principal nourishment;  sometimes they procured by money, from the Moors, milk and millet; but what  most distressed them was, that in the midst of these sandy plains, it was  absolutely impossible for them to shelter themselves from the rays of a  burning sun, which inflames the atmosphere of these desert regions.  Scorched by insupportable heat, almost destitute of the first necessaries  of life, some of them partly lost their senses; a spirit of mutiny even  shewed itself for some moments, and two officers, whose conduct is,  however, irreproachable, were marked as the first victims: happily they did  not proceed to open violence. Many of those who crossed the desert, have  assured us that there were moments when they were quite beside themselves.    An officer of the army in particular, gave signs of the most violent  despair; he rolled himself in the sand, begging his comrades to kill him,  because he could no longer bear up against so many sufferings. They  succeeded in calming him; he arrived at St. Louis with the caravan.[B10]    The sixty-three who embarked near the Moles of Angel, had a longer series  of fatigue to endure: they had to go between eighty and ninety leagues, in  the immense desert of Zaara. After their landing, they had to cross downs  that were extremely elevated, in order to reach the plain, in which they  had the good fortune to meet with a vast pond of fresh water, where they  quenched their thirst, and near which they lay down to rest. Having met  with some Moors, they took them for guides, and after long marches, and the  most cruel privations, they arrived at the Senegal, on the 23d of July, in  the evening. Some of them perished for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1182"],[0,"Dope (#18)"],[1,"very indiscreet to be out alone at three o'clock in  the morning,\" he answered gently. \"I was recalled to London by urgent  business, and returned by road--fortunately, since I have met you.\"    \"How can I explain--\"    \"I don't ask you to explain--Miss Dresden. I have no right and no desire  to ask. But I wish I had the right to advise you.\"    \"How good you are,\" she began, \"and I--\"    Her voice failed her completely, and her sensitive lips began to  tremble. Monte Irvin drew her arm under his own and led her back to meet  the car, which the chauffeur had turned and which was now approaching.    \"I will drive you home,\" he said, \"and if I may call in the morning. I  should like to do so.\"    Rita nodded. She could not trust herself to speak again. And having  placed her in the car, Monte Irvin sat beside her, reclaiming her hand  and grasping it reassuringly and sympathetically throughout the short  drive. They parted at her door.    \"Good night,\" said Irvin, speaking very deliberately because of an  almost uncontrollable desire which possessed him to take Rita in his  arms, to hold her fast, to protect her from her own pathetic self and  from those influences, dimly perceived about her, but which intuitively  he knew to be evil.    \"If I call at eleven will that be too early?\"    \"No,\" she whispered. \"Please come early. There is a matinee tomorrow.\"    \"You mean today,\" he corrected. \"Poor little girl, how tired you will  be. Good night.\"    \"Good night,\" she said, almost inaudibly.    She entered, and, having closed the door, stood leaning against it for  several minutes. Bleakness and nausea threatened to overcome her anew,  and she felt that if she essayed another step she must collapse upon  the floor. Her maid was in bed, and had not been awakened by Rita's  entrance. After a time she managed to grope her way to her bedroom,  where, turning up the light, she sank down helplessly upon the bed.    Her mental state was peculiar, and her thoughts revolved about the  journey from Oxford Street homeward. A thousand times she mentally  repeated the journey, speaking the same words over and over again, and  hearing Monte Irvin's replies.    In those few minutes during which they had been together her sentiments  in regard to him had undergone a change. She had always respected Irvin,  but this respect had been curiously compounded of the personal and the  mercenary; his well-ordered establishment at Prince's Gate had loomed  behind the figure of the man forming a pleasing background to the  portrait. Without being showy he was a splendid \"match\" for any woman.  His wife would have access to good society, and would enjoy every luxury  that wealth could procure. This was the picture lovingly painted and  constantly retouched by Rita's mother.    Now it had vanished. The background was gone, and only the man remained;  the strong, reserved man whose deep voice had spoken so gently, whose  devotion was so true and unselfish that he only sought to shield and  protect her from follies the nature of which he did not even seek to  learn. She was stripped of her vanity, and felt loathsome and unworthy  of such a love.    \"Oh,\" she moaned, rocking to and fro. \"I hate myself--I hate myself!\"    Now that the victory so long desired seemed at last about to be won, she  hesitated to grasp the prize. One solacing reflection she had. She would  put the errors of the past behind her. Many times of late she had found  herself longing to be done with the feverish life of the stage. Envied  by those who had been her companions in the old chorus days, and any one  of whom would have counted ambition crowned could she have played The  Maid of the Masque, Rita thought otherwise. The ducal mansions and  rose-bowered Riviera hotels through which she moved nightly had no charm  for her; she sighed for reality, and had wearied long ago of the canvas  palaces and the artificial Southern moonlight. In fact, stage life had  never truly appealed to her--save as a means to an end.    Again and yet again her weary brain reviewed the episodes of the night  since she had left Cyrus Kilfane's flat, so that nearly an hour had  elapsed before she felt capable of the operation of undressing. Finally,  however, she undressed, shuddering although the room was warmed by an  electric radiator. The weakness and sickness had left her, but she was  quite wide awake, although her brain demanded rest from that incessant  review of the events of the evening.    She put on a warm wrap and seated herself at the dressing-table,  studying her face critically. She saw that she was somewhat pale and  that she had an indefinable air of dishevelment. Also she detected  shadows beneath her eyes, the pupils of which were curiously contracted.  Automatically, as a result of habit, she unlocked her jewel-case and  took out a tiny phial containing minute cachets. She shook several out  on to the palm of her hand, and then paused, staring at her reflection  in the mirror.    For fully half a minute she hesitated, then:    \"I shall never close my eyes all night if I don't!\" she whispered, as if  in reply to a spoken protest, \"and I should be a wreck in the morning.\"    Thus, in the very apogee of her resolve to reform, did she drive one  more rivet into the manacles which held her captive to Kazmah and  Company.    Upon a little spirit-stove stood a covered vessel containing milk, which  was placed there nightly by Rita's maid. She lighted the burner and  warmed the milk. Then, swallowing three of the cachets from the phial,  she drank the milk. Each cachet contained three decigrams of malourea,  the insidious drug notorious under its trade name of Veronal.    She slept deeply, and was not awakened until ten o'clock. Her breakfast  consisted of a cup of strong coffee; but when Monte Irvin arrived at  eleven Rita exhibited no sign of nerve exhaustion. She looked bright and  charming, and Irvin's heart leapt hotly in his breast at sight of her.    Following some desultory and unnatural conversation:    \"May I speak quite frankly to you?\" he said, drawing his chair nearer to  the settee upon which Rita was seated.    She glanced at him swiftly. \"Of course,\" she replied. \"Is it--about my  late hours?\"    He shook his head, smiling rather sadly.    \"That is only one phase of your rather feverish life, little girl,\" he  said. \"I don't mean that I want to lecture you or reproach you. I only  want to ask you if you are satisfied?\"    \"Satisfied?\" echoed Rita, twirling a tassel that hung from a cushion  beside her.    \"Yes. You have achieved success in your profession.\" He strove in  vain to banish bitterness from his voice. \"You are a 'star,' and your  photograph is to be seen frequently in the smartest illustrated papers.  You are clever and beautiful and have hosts of admirers. But--are you  satisfied?\"    She stared absently at the silk tassel, twirling it about her white  fingers more and more rapidly. Then:    \"No,\" she answered softly.    Monte Irvin hesitated for a moment ere bending forward and grasping her  hands.    \"I am glad you are not satisfied,\" he whispered. \"I always knew you had  a soul for something higher--better.\"    She avoided his ardent gaze, but he moved to the settee beside her and  looked into the bewitching face.    \"Would it be a great sacrifice to give it all up?\" he whispered in a yet  lower tone.    Rita shook her head, persistently staring at the tassel.    \"For me?\"    She gave him a swift, half-frightened glance, pressing her hands against  his breast and leaning, back.    \"Oh, you don't know me--you don't know me!\" she said, the good that was  in her touched to life by the man's sincerity. \"I--don't deserve it.\"    \"Rita!\" he murmured. \"I won't hear you say that!\"    \"You know nothing about my friends--about my life--\"    \"I know that I want you for my wife, so that I can protect you from  those 'friends.'\" He took her in his arms, and she surrendered her lips  to him.    \"My sweet little girl,\" he whispered. \"I cannot believe it--yet.\"    But the die was cast, and when Rita went to the theatre to dress for the  afternoon performance she was pledged to sever her connection with the  stage on the termination of her contract. She had luncheon with Monte  Irvin, and had listened almost dazedly to his plans for the future.  His wealth was even greater than her mother had estimated it to be, and  Rita's most cherished dreams were dwarfed by the prospects which Monte  Irvin opened up before her. It almost seemed as though he knew and  shared her dearest ambitions. She was to winter beneath real Southern  palms and to possess a cruising yacht, not one of boards and canvas like  that which figured in The Maid of the Masque.    Real Southern palms, she mused guiltily, not those conjured up by  opium. That he was solicitous for her health the nature of his schemes  revealed. They were to visit Switzerland, and proceed thence to a villa  which he owned in Italy. Christmas they would spend in Cairo, explore  the Nile to Assouan in a private dahabiyeh, and return home via the  Riviera in time to greet the English spring. Rita's delicate, swiftly  changing color, her almost ethereal figure, her intense nervous energy  he ascribed to a delicate constitution.    She wondered if she would ever dare to tell him the truth; if she ought  to tell him.    Pyne came to her dressing-room just before the performance began. He  had telephoned at an early hour in the morning, and had learned from her  maid that Rita had come home safely and was asleep. Rita had expected  him; but the influence of Monte Irvin, from whom she had parted at the  stage-door, had prevailed until she actually heard Sir Lucien's voice  in the corridor. She had resolutely refrained from looking at the little  jewelled casket, engraved \"From Lucy to Rita,\" which lay in her make-up  box upon the table. But the imminence of an ordeal which she dreaded  intensely weakened her resolution. She"]]]
