The  Baron was evidently incog.: for he had on the same short dirty-white  waistcoat, Chinese boots, and conical hat, that he travelled down in,  and being a stranger in the land, of course he was uncommonly glad to  pick up Jorrocks, so after he had hugged him a little, called him a \"bon  garcon,\" and a few other endearing terms, he run his great long arm  through his, and walked him down street, the whole peregrinations of  Newmarket being comprised in the words \"up street\" and \"down.\" He then  communicated in most unrepresentable language, that he was on his way  to buy \"an 'oss,\" and Jorrocks informing him that he was a perfect  connoisseur in the article, the Baron again assured him of his  distinguished consideration. They were met by Joe Rogers the trainer  with a ring-key in his hand, who led the way to the stable, and having  unlocked a box in which was a fine slapping four-year old, according to  etiquette he put his hat in a corner, took a switch in one hand, laid  hold of the horse's head with the other, while the lad in attendance  stripped off its clothes. The Baron then turned up his wrists, and  making a curious noise in his throat, proceeded to pass his hand down  each leg, and along its back, after which he gave it a thump in the  belly and squeezed its throat, when, being as wise as he was at  starting, he stuck his thumb in his side, and took a mental survey of  the whole.--\"Ah,\" said he at length--\"foin 'oss,--foin 'oss; vot ears he  has?\" \"Oh,\" said Rogers, \"they show breeding.\" \"Non, non, I say vot ears  he has?\" \"Well, but he carries them well,\" was the answer. \"Non, non,\"  stamping, \"I say vot ears (years) he has?\" \"Oh, hang it, I twig--four  years old.\" Then the Baron took another long look at him. At length he  resumed, \"I vill my wet.\" \"What's that?\" inquired Rogers of Jorrocks.  \"His wet--why, a drink to be sure,\" and thereupon Rogers went to the  pump and brought a glass of pure water, which the Baron refused with  becoming indignation. \"Non, non,\" said he stamping, \"I vill my wet.\"  Rogers looked at Jorrocks, and Jorrocks looked at Rogers, but neither  Rogers nor Jorrocks understood him. \"I vill my wet,\" repeated the Baron  with vehemence. \"He must want some brandy in it,\" observed Mr. Jorrocks,  judging of the Baron by himself, and thereupon the lad was sent for  three-penn'orth. When it arrived, the Baron dashed it out of his hand  with a prolonged sacre-e-e-e--! adding \"I vill von wet-tin-nin-na-ary  surgeon.\" The boy was dispatched for one, and on his arrival the  veterinary surgeon went through the process that the Baron had  attempted, and not being a man of many words, he just gave the Baron a  nod at the end. \"How moch?\" inquked the Baron of Rogers. \"Five hundred,\"  was the answer. \"Vot, five hundred livre?\" \"Oh d----n it, you may take  or leave him, just as you like, but you won't get him for less.\" The  \"vet\" explained that the Baron wished to know whether it was five  hundred francs (French ten-pences), or five hundred guineas English  money, and being informed that it was the latter, he gave his conical  hat a thrust on his brow, and bolted out of the box.    But race hour approaches, and people begin to assemble in groups before  the \"rooms,\" while tax-carts, pony-gigs, post-chaises, the usual  aristocratical accompaniments of Newmarket, come dribbling at intervals  into the town. Here is old Sam Spring in a spring-cart, driven by a  ploughboy in fustian, there the Earl of---- on a ten-pound pony, with  the girths elegantly parted to prevent the saddle slipping over its  head, while Miss----, his jockey's daughter, dashes by him in a phaeton  with a powdered footman, and the postilion in scarlet and leathers, with  a badge on his arm. Old Crockey puts on his greatcoat, Jem Bland draws  the yellow phaeton and greys to the gateway of the \"White Hart,\" to take  up his friend Crutch Robinson; Zac, Jack and another, have just driven  on in a fly. In short, it's a brilliant meeting! Besides four coronetted  carriages with post-horses, there are three phaetons-and-pair; a  thing that would have been a phaeton if they'd have let it; General  Grosvenor's dog-carriage, that is to say, his carriage with a dog upon  it; Lady Chesterfield and the Hon. Mrs. Anson in a pony phaeton with an  out-rider (Miss---- will have one next meeting instead of the  powdered footman); Tattersall in his double carriage driving without  bearing-reins; Old Theobald in leather breeches and a buggy; five Bury  butchers in a tax-cart; Young Dutch Sam on a pony; \"Short-odds Richards\"  on a long-backed crocodile-looking rosinante; and no end of pedestrians.    But where is Mr. Jorrocks all this time? Why eating brawn in the  \"Rutland Arms\" with his friend the Baron, perfectly unconscious that  all these passers-by were not the daily visables of the place. \"Dash  my vig,\" said he, as he bolted another half of the round, \"I see no  symptoms of a stir. Come, my lord, do me the honour to take another  glass of sherry.\" His lordship was nothing loath, so by mutual  entreaties they finished the bottle, besides a considerable quantity  of porter. A fine, fat, chestnut, long-tailed Suffolk punch cart  mare--fresh from the plough--having been considerately provided by the  Yorkshireman for Mr. Jorrocks, with a cob for himself, they proceeded  to mount in the yard, when Mr. Jorrocks was concerned to find that the  Baron had nothing to carry him. His lordship, too, seemed disconcerted,  but it was only momentary; for walking up to the punch mare, and resting  his elbow on her hind quarter to try if she kicked, he very coolly  vaulted up behind Mr. Jorrocks. Now Jorrocks, though proud of the  patronage of a lord, did not exactly comprehend whether he was in  earnest or not, but the Baron soon let him know; for thrusting his  conical hat on his brow, he put his arm round Jorrocks's waist, and  gave the old mare a touch in the flank with the Chinese boot, crying  out--\"Along me, brave _garcon_, along _ma cher_,\" and the owner of the  mare living at Kentford, she went off at a brisk trot in that direction,  while the Yorkshireman slipped down the town unperceived. The sherry had  done its business on them both; the Baron, and who, perhaps was the most  \"cut\" of the two, chaunted the _Marsellaise_ hymn of liberty with  as much freedom as though he were sitting in the saddle. Thus they  proceeded laughing and singing until the Bury pay-gate arrested their  progress, when it occurred to the steersman to ask if they were going  right. \"Be this the vay to Newmarket races?\" inquired Jorrocks of the  pike-keeper. The man dived into the small pocket of his white apron for  a ticket and very coolly replied, \"Shell out, old 'un.\" \"How much?\" said  Jorrocks. \"Tuppence,\" which having got, he said, \"Now, then, you may  turn, for the heath be over yonder,\" pointing back, \"at least it was  there this morning, I know.\" After a volley of abuse for his impudence,  Mr. Jorrocks, with some difficulty got the old mare pulled round, for  she had a deuced hard mouth of her own, and only a plain snaffle in it;  at last, however, with the aid of a boy to beat her with a furze-bush,  they got her set a-going again, and, retracing their steps, they trotted  \"down street,\" rose the hill, and entered the spacious wide-extending  flat of Newmarket Heath. The races were going forward on one of the  distant courses, and a slight, insignificant, black streak, swelling  into a sort of oblong (for all the world like an overgrown tadpole),  was all that denoted the spot, or interrupted the verdant aspect of  the quiet extensive plain. Jorrocks was horrified, having through life  pictured Epsom as a mere drop in the ocean compared with the countless  multitude of Newmarket, while the Baron, who was wholly indifferent to  the matter, nearly had old Jorrocks pitched over the mare's head by  applying the furze-bush (which he had got from the boy) to her tail  while Mr. Jorrocks was sitting loosely, contemplating the barrenness  of the prospect. The sherry was still alive, and being all for fun, he  shuffled back into the saddle as soon as the old mare gave over kicking;  and giving a loud tally-ho, with some minor \"hunting noises,\" which were  responded to by the Baron in notes not capable of being set to music,  and aided by an equally indescribable accompaniment from the old mare at  every application of the bush, she went off at score over the springy  turf, and bore them triumphantly to the betting-post just as the ring  was in course of formation, a fact which she announced by a loud neigh  on viewing her companion of the plough, as well as by unpsetting some  half-dozen black-legs as she rushed through the crowd to greet her.  Great was the hubbub, shouting, swearing, and laughing,--for though the  Newmarketites are familiar with most conveyances, from a pair of horses  down to a pair of shoes, it had not then fallen to their lot to see two  men ride into the ring on the same horse,--certainly not with such a hat  between them as the Baron's.    The gravest and weightiest matters will not long distract the attention  of a black-leg, and the laughter having subsided without Jorrocks or the  Baron being in the slightest degree disconcerted, the ring was again  formed; horses' heads again turn towards the post, while carriages,  gigs, and carts form an outer circle. A solemn silence ensues. The legs  are scanning the list. At length one gives tongue. \"What starts? Does  Lord Eldon start?\" \"No, he don't,\" replies the owner. \"Does Trick, by  Catton?\" \"Yes, and Conolly rides--but mind, three pounds over.\" \"Does  John Bull?\" \"No John's struck out.\" \"Polly Hopkins does, so does  Talleyrand, also O, Fy! out of Penitence; Beagle and"]]]
