This Government was  badgered out of its life with Chamberlain's despatches--such despatches.  And then look how we have been lied about in your papers, and called  barbarians and savages.'    _Self_. 'I think you have certainly been abused unjustly. Indeed, when I  was taken prisoner the other day, I thought it quite possible I should  be put to death, although I was a correspondent' (great laughter, 'Fancy  that!' etc.). 'At the best I expected to be held in prison as a kind of  hostage. See how I have been mistaken.'    I pointed at the sentry who stood in the doorway, for even members of  the Government could not visit us alone. Grobelaar flushed. 'Oh, well,  we will hope that the captivity will not impair your spirits. Besides,  it will not last long. The President expects peace before the New Year.'    'I shall hope to be free by then.'    And with this the interview came to an end, and my visitors withdrew.  The actual conversation had lasted more than an hour, but the dialogue  above is not an inaccurate summary.    About ten days after my arrival at Pretoria I received a visit from the  American Consul, Mr. Macrum. It seems that some uncertainty prevailed at  home as to whether I was alive, wounded or unwounded, and in what light  I was regarded by the Transvaal authorities. Mr. Bourke Cockran, an  American Senator who had long been a friend of mine, telegraphed from  New York to the United States representative in Pretoria, hoping by this  neutral channel to learn how the case stood. I had not, however, talked  with Mr. Macrum for very long before I realised that neither I nor any  other British prisoner was likely to be the better for any efforts which  he might make on our behalf. His sympathies were plainly so much with  the Transvaal Government that he even found it difficult to discharge  his diplomatic duties. However, he so far sank his political opinions  as to telegraph to Mr. Bourke Cockran, and the anxiety which my  relations were suffering on my account was thereby terminated.    I had one other visitor in these dull days, whom I should like to  notice. During the afternoon which I spent among the Boers in their camp  behind Bulwana Hill I had exchanged a few words with an Englishman whose  name is of no consequence, but who was the gunner entrusted with the  aiming of the big 6-inch gun. He was a light-hearted jocular fellow  outwardly, but I was not long in discovering that his anxieties among  the Boers were grave and numerous. He had been drawn into the war, so  far as I could make out, more by the desire of sticking to his own  friends and neighbours than even of preserving his property. But besides  this local spirit, which counterbalanced the racial and patriotic  feelings, there was a very strong desire to be upon the winning side,  and I think that he regarded the Boers with an aversion which increased  in proportion as their successes fell short of their early  anticipations. One afternoon he called at the States Model Schools  prison and, being duly authorised to visit the prisoners, asked to see  me. In the presence of Dr. Gunning, I had an interesting interview. At  first our conversation was confined to generalities, but gradually, as  the other officers in the room, with ready tact, drew the little  Hollander Professor into an argument, my renegade and I were able to  exchange confidences.    I was of course above all things anxious to get true news from the outer  world, and whenever Dr. Gunning's attention was distracted by his  discussion with the officers, I managed to get a little.    'Well, you know,' said the gunner, 'you English don't play fair at  Ladysmith at all. We have allowed you to have a camp at Intombi Spruit  for your wounded, and yet we see red cross flags flying in the town, and  we have heard that in the Church there is a magazine of ammunition  protected by the red cross flag. Major Erasmus, he says to me \"John, you  smash up that building,\" and so when I go back I am going to fire into  the church.' Gunning broke out into panegyrics on the virtues of the  Afrikanders: my companion dropped his voice. 'The Boers have had a  terrible beating at Belmont; the Free Staters have lost more than 200  killed; much discouraged; if your people keep on like this the Free  State will break up.' He raised his voice, 'Ladysmith hold out a month?  Not possible; we shall give it a fortnight's more bombardment, and then  you will just see how the burghers will scramble into their trenches.  Plenty of whisky then, ha, ha, ha!' Then lower, 'I wish to God I could  get away from this, but I don't know what to do; they are always  suspecting me and watching me, and I have to keep on pretending I want  them to win. This is a terrible position for a man to be in: curse the  filthy Dutchmen!'    I said, 'Will Methuen get to Kimberley?'    'I don't know, but he gave them hell at Belmont and at Graspan, and they  say they are fighting again to-day at Modder River. Major Erasmus is  very down-hearted about it. But the ordinary burghers hear nothing but  lies; all lies, I tell you. _(Crescendo)_ Look at the lies that have  been told about us! Barbarians! savages! every name your papers have  called us, but you know better than that now; you know how well we have  treated you since you have been a prisoner; and look at the way your  people have treated our prisoners--put them on board ship to make them  sea-sick! Don't you call that cruel?' Here Gunning broke in that it was  time for visitors to leave the prison. And so my strange guest, a  feather blown along by the wind, without character or stability, a  renegade, a traitor to his blood and birthplace, a time-server, had to  hurry away. I took his measure; nor did his protestations of alarm  excite my sympathy, and yet somehow I did not feel unkindly towards him;  a weak man is a pitiful object in times of trouble. Some of our  countrymen who were living in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State at  the outbreak of the war have been placed in such difficult positions and  torn by so many conflicting emotions that they must be judged very  tolerantly. How few men are strong enough to stand against the  prevailing currents of opinion! Nor, after the desertion of the British  residents in the Transvaal in 1881, have we the right to judge their  successors harshly if they have failed us, for it was Great and Mighty  Britain who was the renegade and traitor then.    No sooner had I reached Pretoria than I demanded my release from the  Government, on the grounds that I was a Press correspondent and a  non-combatant. So many people have found it difficult to reconcile this  position with the accounts which have been published of what transpired  during the defence of the armoured train, that I am compelled to  explain. Besides the soldiers of the Dublin Fusiliers and Durban Light  Infantry who had been captured, there were also eight or ten civilians,  including a fireman, a telegraphist, and several men of the breakdown  gang. Now it seems to me that according to international practice and  the customs of war, the Transvaal Government were perfectly justified in  regarding all persons connected with a military train as actual  combatants; indeed, the fact that they were not soldiers was, if  anything, an aggravation of their case. But the Boers were at that time  overstocked with prisoners whom they had to feed and guard, and they  therefore announced that the civilians would be released as soon as  their identity was established, and only the military retained as  prisoners.    In my case, however, an exception was to be made, and General Joubert,  who had read the gushing accounts of my conduct which appeared in the  Natal newspapers, directed that since I had taken part in the fighting I  was to be treated as a combatant officer.    Now, as it happened, I had confined myself strictly to the business of  clearing the line, which was entrusted to me, and although I do not  pretend that I considered the matter in its legal aspect at the time,  the fact remains that I did not give a shot, nor was I armed when  captured. I therefore claimed to be included in the same category as the  civilian railway officials and men of the breakdown gang, whose  declared duty it was to clear the line, pointing out that though my  action might differ in degree from theirs, it was of precisely the same  character, and that if they were regarded as non-combatants I had a  right to be considered a non-combatant too.    To this effect I wrote two letters, one to the Secretary of War and one  to General Joubert; but, needless to say, I did not indulge in much hope  of the result, for I was firmly convinced that the Boer authorities  regarded me as a kind of hostage, who would make a pleasing addition to  the collection of prisoners they were forming against a change of  fortune. I therefore continued to search for a path of escape; and  indeed it was just as well that I did so, for I never received any  answer to either of my applications while I was a prisoner, although I  have since heard that one arrived by a curious coincidence the very day  _after_ I had departed.    While I was looking about for means, and awaiting an opportunity to  break out of the Model Schools, I made every preparation to make a  graceful exit when the moment should arrive. I gave full instructions to  my friends as to what was to be done with my clothes and the effects I  had accumulated during my stay; I paid my account to date with the  excellent Boshof; cashed a cheque on him for 20_l_.; changed some of the  notes I had always concealed on my person since my capture into gold;  and lastly, that there might be no unnecessary unpleasantness, I wrote  the following letter to the Secretary of State:           States Model Schools Prison: December 10, 1899.         Sir,--I have the honour to inform you that as I do not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14431"],[0,"International Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science, Vol. 1, (#18)"],[1,"a weakness which is (or, by  the blessing of God, was) a calamity, although those who did not know me  intimately had little reason to regard it otherwise than a crime. For,  indeed, had my pride, or that of my family permitted, there was  much--very much--there was everything to be offered in extenuation.  Perhaps, even, there was an epoch at which it might not have been wrong  in me to hint--what by the testimony of Dr. Francis and other medical  men I might have demonstrated, had the public, indeed, cared for the  demonstration--that the irregularities so profoundly lamented were the  _effect_ of a terrible evil rather than its cause.--And now let me thank  God that in redemption from the physical ill I have forever got rid of  the moral.\"    Dr. Francis never gave any such testimony. On one occasion Poe borrowed  fifty dollars from a distinguished literary woman of South Carolina,  promising to return it in a few days, and when he failed to do so, and  was asked for a written acknowledgment of the debt that might be  exhibited to the husband of the friend who had thus served him, he denied  all knowledge of it, and threatened to exhibit a correspondence which he  said would make the woman infamous, if she said any more on the subject.  Of course there had never been any such correspondence, but when Poe  heard that a brother of the slandered party was in quest of him for the  purpose of taking the satisfaction supposed to be due in such cases, he  sent for Dr. Francis and induced him to carry to the gentleman his  retraction and apology, with a statement which seemed true enough for the  moment, that Poe was \"out of his head.\" It is an ungracious duty to  describe such conduct in a person of Poe's unquestionable genius and  capacities of greatness, but those who are familiar with the career of  this extraordinary creature can recall but too many similar anecdotes;  and as to his intemperance, they perfectly well understand that its  pathology was like that of ninety-nine of every hundred cases of the  disease.      [Footnote C: This lady was the late Mrs. Osgood, and a fragment of what  she wrote under these circumstances may be found in the last edition of  her works under the title of \"Lullin, or the Diamond Fay.\"]      As the autumn of 1846 wore on, Poe's habits of frequent intoxication and  his inattention to the means of support reduced him to much more than  common destitution. He was now living at Fordham, several miles from the  city, so that his necessities were not generally known even among his  acquaintances; but when the dangerous illness of his wife was added to  his misfortunes, and his dissipation and accumulated causes of anxiety  had prostrated all his own energies, the subject was introduced into the  journals. The _Express_ said:    \"We regret to learn that Edgar A. Poe and his wife are both dangerously  ill with the consumption, and that the hand of misfortune lies heavy  upon their temporal affairs. We are sorry to mention the fact that they  are so far reduced as to be barely able to obtain the necessaries of  life. This is indeed a hard lot, and we hope that the friends and  admirers of Mr. Poe will come promptly to his assistance in his bitterest  hour of need.\"    Mr. Willis, in an article in the _Home Journal_ suggesting a hospital for  disabled laborers with the brain, said--    \"The feeling we have long entertained on this subject, has been freshened  by a recent paragraph in the _Express_, announcing that Mr. Edgar A. Poe  and his wife were both dangerously ill, and suffering for want of the  common necessaries of life. Here is one of the finest scholars, one of  the most original men of genius, and one of the most industrious of the  literary profession of our country, whose temporary suspension of labor,  from bodily illness, drops him immediately to a level with the common  objects of public charity. There was no intermediate stopping-place-no  respectful shelter where, with the delicacy due to genius and culture, he  might secure aid, unadvertised, till, with returning health, he could  resume his labors and his unmortified sense of independence. He must  either apply to individual friends--(a resource to which death is  sometimes almost preferable)--or _suffer down_ to the level where Charity  receives claimants, but where Rags and Humiliation are the only  recognized Ushers to her presence. Is this right? Should there not be, in  all highly civilized communities, an Institution designed expressly for  educated and refined objects of charity--a hospital, a retreat, a home of  seclusion and comfort, the sufficient claims to which would be such  susceptibilities as are violated by the above mentioned appeal in a daily  newspaper.\"    The entire article from which this paragraph is taken, was an ingenious  apology for Mr. Poe's infirmities; but it was conceived and executed in a  generous spirit, and it had a quick effect in various contributions,  which relieved the poet from pecuniary embarrassments. The next week he  published the following letter:    \"_My Dear Willis_:--The paragraph which has been put in circulation  respecting my wife's illness, my own, my poverty, etc., is now lying  before me; together with the beautiful lines by Mrs. Locke and those by  Mrs. ----, to which the paragraph has given rise, as well as your kind  and manly comments in _The Home Journal_. The motive of the paragraph I  leave to the conscience of him or her who wrote it or suggested it. Since  the thing is done, however, and since the concerns of my family are thus  pitilessly thrust before the public, I perceive no mode of escape from a  public statement of what is true and what erroneous in the report alluded  to. That my wife is ill, then, is true; and you may imagine with what  feelings I add that this illness, hopeless from the first, has been  heightened and precipitated by her reception at two different periods, of  anonymous letters,--one inclosing the paragraph now in question; the  other, those published calumnies of Messrs. ----, for which I yet hope to  find redress in a court of justice.    \"Of the facts, that I myself have been long and dangerously ill, and that  my illness has been a well-understood thing among my brethren of the  press, the best evidence is afforded by the innumerable paragraphs of  personal and literary abuse with which I have been latterly assailed.  This matter, however, will remedy itself. At the very first blush of my  new prosperity, the gentlemen who toadied me in the old, will recollect  themselves and toady me again. You, who know me, will comprehend that I  speak of these things only as having served, in a measure, to lighten the  gloom of unhappiness, by a gentle and not unpleasant sentiment of mingled  pity, merriment and contempt. That, as the inevitable consequence of so  long an illness, I have been in want of money, it would be folly in me to  deny--but that I have ever materially suffered from privation, beyond the  extent of my capacity for suffering, is not altogether true. That I am  'without friends' is a gross calumny, which I am sure _you_ never could  have believed, and which a thousand noble-hearted men would have good  right never to forgive me for permitting to pass unnoticed and undenied.  Even in the city of New York I could have no difficulty in naming a  hundred persons, to each of whom--when the hour for speaking had  arrived--I could and would have applied for aid with unbounded  confidence, and with absolutely _no_ sense of humiliation. I do not  think, my dear Willis, that there is any need of my saying more. I am  getting better, and may add--if it be any comfort to my enemies--that I  have little fear of getting worse. The truth is, I have a great deal to  do; and I have made up my mind not to die till it is done. Sincerely  yours,    \"December 30th, 1846. EDGAR A. POE.\"    This was written for effect. He had not been ill a great while, nor  dangerously at all; there was no literary or personal abuse of him in the  journals; and his friends in town had been applied to for money until  their patience was nearly exhausted. His wife, however, was very sick,  and in a few weeks she died. In a letter to a lady in Massachusetts, who,  upon the appearance of the newspaper articles above quoted, had sent him  money and expressions of sympathy, he wrote, under date of March 10,  1847:    \"In answering your kind letter permit me in the first place to absolve  myself from a suspicion which, under the circumstances, you could  scarcely have failed to entertain--a suspicion of discourtesy toward  yourself, in not having more promptly replied to you.... I could not help  feeling that should you see my letter to Mr. Willis--in which a natural  pride, which I feel you could not blame, impelled me to shrink from  public charity, even _at the cost of truth, in denying those necessities  which were but too real_--I could not help fearing that, should you see  this letter, you would yourself feel pained at having caused me pain-at  having been the means of giving further publicity to an unfounded  report--at all events to the report of a wretchedness which I had thought  it prudent (since the world regards wretchedness as a crime) so publicly  to disavow. In a word, venturing to judge your noble nature by my own, I  felt grieved lest my published denial might cause you to regret what you  had done; and my first impulse was to write you, and assure you, even at  the risk of doing so too warmly, of the sweet emotion, made up of respect  and gratitude alone, with which my heart was filled to overflowing. While  I was hesitating, however, in regard to the propriety of this step, I was  overwhelmed by a sorrow so poignant as to deprive me for several weeks of  all power of thought or action. Your letter, now lying before me, tells  me that I had not been mistaken in your nature, and that I should not  have hesitated to address you; "]]]
