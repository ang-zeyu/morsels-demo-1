They put them into dungeons wherein were adders and snakes and toads,  and thus wore them out. Some they put into a crucet-house, that is,  into a chest that was short and narrow and not deep, and they put  sharp stones in it, and crushed the man therein so that they broke all  his limbs. There were hateful and grim things called Sachenteges in  many of the castles, and which two or three men had enough to do to  carry. The Sachentege was made thus: it was fastened to a beam, having  a sharp iron to go round a man's throat and neck, so that he might  noways sit, nor lie, nor sleep, but that he must bear all the iron.  Many thousands they exhausted with hunger. I cannot, and I may not,  tell of all the wounds and all the tortures that they inflicted upon  the wretched men of this land; and this state of things lasted the  nineteen years that Stephen was king, and ever grew worse and worse.  They were continually levying an exaction from the towns, which they  called Tenserie,[18] and when the miserable inhabitants had no more to  give, then plundered they and burnt all the towns, so that well  mightest thou walk a whole day's journey nor ever shouldest thou find  a man seated in a town or its lands tilled.\"      [18] A payment to the superior lord for protection.    More than a thousand of these abodes of infamy are said to have been  built. Possibly many of them were timber structures only. Countless  small towns and villages boast of once possessing a fortress. The name  Castle Street remains, though the actual site of the stronghold has  long vanished. Sometimes we find a mound which seems to proclaim its  position, but memory is silent, and the people of England, if the  story of the chronicler be true, have to be grateful to Henry II, who  set himself to work to root up and destroy very many of these  adulterine castles which were the abodes of tyranny and oppression.  However, for the protection of his kingdom, he raised other  strongholds, in the south the grand fortress of Dover, which still  guards the straits; in the west, Berkeley Castle, for his friend  Robert FitzHarding, ancestor of Lord Berkeley, which has remained in  the same family until the present day; in the north, Richmond,  Scarborough, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne; and in the east, Orford Keep.  The same stern Norman keep remains, but you can see some changes in  the architecture. The projection of the buttresses is increased, and  there is some attempt at ornamentation. Orford Castle, which some  guide-books and directories will insist on confusing with Oxford  Castle and stating that it was built by Robert D'Oiley in 1072, was  erected by Henry II to defend the country against the incursions of  the Flemings and to safeguard Orford Haven. Caen stone was brought for  the stone dressings to windows and doors, parapets and groins, but  masses of septaria found on the shore and in the neighbouring marshes  were utilized with such good effect that the walls have stood the  attacks of besiegers and weathered the storms of the east coast for  more than seven centuries. It was built in a new fashion that was made  in France, and to which our English eyes were unaccustomed, and is  somewhat similar in plan to Conisborough Castle, in the valley of the  Don. The plan is circular with three projecting towers, and the keep  was protected by two circular ditches, one fifteen feet and the other  thirty feet distant from its walls. Between the two ditches was a  circular wall with parapet and battlements. The interior of the castle  was divided into three floors; the towers, exclusive of the turrets,  had five, two of which were entresols, and were ninety-six feet high,  the central keep being seventy feet.[19] The oven was at the top of  the keep. The chapel is one of the most interesting chambers, with its  original altar still in position, though much damaged, and also  piscina, aumbrey, and ciborium. This castle nearly vanished with other  features of vanishing England in the middle of the eighteenth century,  Lord Hereford proposing to pull it down for the sake of the material;  but \"it being a necessary sea-mark, especially for ships coming from  Holland, who by steering so as to make the castle cover or hide the  church thereby avoid a dangerous sandbank called the Whiting,  Government interfered and prevented the destruction of the  building.\"[20]      [19] Cf. _Memorials of Old Suffolk_, p. 65.      [20] Grose's _Antiquities._    In these keeps the thickness of the walls enabled them to contain  chambers, stairs, and passages. At Guildford there is an oratory with  rude carvings of sacred subjects, including a crucifixion. The first  and second floors were usually vaulted, and the upper ones were of  timber. Fireplaces were built in most of the rooms, and some sort of  domestic comfort was not altogether forgotten. In the earlier  fortresses the walls of the keep enclosed an inner court, which had  rooms built up to the great stone walls, the court afterwards being  vaulted and floors erected. In order to protect the entrance there  were heavy doors with a portcullis, and by degrees the outward  defences were strengthened. There was an outer bailey or court  surrounded by a strong wall, with a barbican guarding the entrance,  consisting of a strong gate protected by two towers. In this lower or  outer court are the stables, and the mound where the lord of the  castle dispenses justice, and where criminals and traitors are  executed. Another strong gateway flanked by towers protects the inner  bailey, on the edge of which stands the keep, which frowns down upon  us as we enter. An immense household was supported in these castles.  Not only were there men-at-arms, but also cooks, bakers, brewers,  tailors, carpenters, smiths, masons, and all kinds of craftsmen; and  all this crowd of workers had to be provided with accommodation by the  lord of the castle. Hence a building in the form of a large hall was  erected, sometimes of stone, usually of wood, in the lower or upper  bailey, for these soldiers and artisans, where they slept and had  their meals.    Amongst other castles which arose during this late Norman and early  English period of architecture we may mention Barnard Castle, a mighty  stronghold, held by the royal house of Balliol, the Prince Bishops of  Durham, the Earls of Warwick, the Nevilles, and other powerful  families. Sir Walter Scott immortalized the Castle in _Rokeby_. Here  is his description of the fortress:--            High crowned he sits, in dawning pale,          The sovereign of the lovely vale.          What prospects from the watch-tower high          Gleam gradual on the warder's eye?          Far sweeping to the east he sees          Down his deep woods the course of Tees,          And tracks his wanderings by the steam          Of summer vapours from the stream;          And ere he pace his destined hour          By Brackenbury's dungeon tower,          These silver mists shall melt away          And dew the woods with glittering spray.          Then in broad lustre shall be shown          That mighty trench of living stone.          And each huge trunk that from the side,          Reclines him o'er the darksome tide,          Where Tees, full many a fathom low,          Wears with his rage no common foe;          Nor pebbly bank, nor sand-bed here,          Nor clay-mound checks his fierce career,          Condemned to mine a channelled way          O'er solid sheets of marble grey.    This lordly pile has seen the Balliols fighting with the Scots, of  whom John Balliol became king, the fierce contests between the warlike  prelates of Durham and Barnard's lord, the triumph of the former, who  were deprived of their conquest by Edward I, and then its surrender in  later times to the rebels of Queen Elizabeth.    Another northern border castle is Norham, the possession of the Bishop  of Durham, built during this period. It was a mighty fortress, and  witnessed the gorgeous scene of the arbitration between the rival  claimants to the Scottish throne, the arbiter being King Edward I of  England, who forgot not to assert his own fancied rights to the  overlordship of the northern kingdom. It was, however, besieged by the  Scots, and valiant deeds were wrought before its walls by Sir William  Marmion and Sir Thomas Grey, but the Scots captured it in 1327 and  again in 1513. It is now but a battered ruin. Prudhoe, with its  memories of border wars, and Castle Rising, redolent with the memories  of the last years of the wicked widow of Edward II, belong to this age  of castle-architecture, and also the older portions of Kenilworth.    Pontefract Castle, the last fortress that held out for King Charles in  the Civil War, and in consequence slighted and ruined, can tell of  many dark deeds and strange events in English history. The De Lacys  built it in the early part of the thirteenth century. Its area was  seven acres. The wall of the castle court was high and flanked by  seven towers; a deep moat was cut on the western side, where was the  barbican and drawbridge. It had terrible dungeons, one a room  twenty-five feet square, without any entrance save a trap-door in the  floor of a turret. The castle passed, in 1310, by marriage to Thomas  Earl of Lancaster, who took part in the strife between Edward II and  his nobles, was captured, and in his own hall condemned to death. The  castle is always associated with the murder of Richard II, but  contemporary historians, Thomas of Walsingham and Gower the poet,  assert that he starved himself to death; others contend that his  starvation was not voluntary; while there are not wanting those who  say that he escaped to Scotland, lived there many years, and died in  peace in the castle of Stirling, an honoured guest of Robert III of  Scotland, in 1419.
