Impersonal verbs are those which are only conjugated in the 3rd pers.  sing, of all the tenses.[129]    [Footnote 129: They are so called because they have no person or thing  as their subject.]    The principal =Impersonal Verbs= are--    Llover-llueve (to rain, it rains)  Granizar (to hail)  Helar-hiela (to freeze, it freezes)  Lloviznar (to drizzle)  Nevar-nieva (to snow, it snows)  Relampaguear (to lighten)  Tronar-truena (to thunder, it thunders)  Alborear (to dawn)  Amanecer (to dawn)  Anochecer (to grow dark)    The subject (generally understood) of Impersonal verbs is _ello_.  Sometimes we find the words _Dios_ or _el dia_ expressed as subjects,  as--    Amanecera Dios y veremos: Let us wait for the morning and then we shall  see.    Amanecio el dia: The day dawned.    _Amanecer_ and _anochecer_ may be used as personal verbs, as--    Amanecimos en Madrid y anochecimos en Guadalajara: We were in Madrid at  daybreak and at nightfall in Guadalajara.    Tu anocheciste bueno y amaneciste malo: You passed the night well, but  you had a bad morning.    Many ordinary verbs are used sometimes impersonally, as--      Bastar (to suffice).  Convenir (to suit).  Parecer (to appear).  Faltar[130] (to be wanting).  Hacer falta (to be wanted).  Suceder[131] (to happen).    [Footnote 130: As a personal verb, it means also \"to fail.\"]    [Footnote 131: As a personal verb, it means also \"to succeed.\"]      EXAMPLES--    Basta ganar la vida: It is enough to earn a living.    No conviene explotar esta mina: It does not pay to exploit this mine.    No parece justo que se aprovechen de este modo: It does not seem right  that they should take advantage in this way.    Falta hacer algunos arreglos: Some arrangements are still wanting.    Sucedio que se declaro en quiebra: It happened that he filed his  petition in bankruptcy.      In the sentences:    Me bastan diez libras: L10 are enough for me.  Me parecen justas sus razones: His reasons seem to me to be right.  Le sucedieron muchas desgracias: Many misfortunes happened to him.    the verb is =personal=, and this accounts for its being in the plural.  In \"me bastan diez libras,\" \"diez libras\" is the subject.    The verb is impersonal when referring to a whole statement, as--    (Ello) es necesario: It is necessary.    Of _Haber_ and _Hacer_ as impersonal verbs, we have treated in Lesson  VIII and Lesson XVI.    We add here that _Hacer_ is used impersonally before certain nouns to  denote the state of the weather or of the temperature, as--    Hace calor, frio, lluvia, viento, sol, etc.: It is warm, cold, rainy,  windy, sunny, etc.    _Valer_ used impersonally = \"to be better,\" as--    Mas vale asi: It is better so.    Expressions like \"?Que se dira?\" or \"?que diran?\" (What will people  say?) may also be called impersonal uses of the verb.      +--------------------+----------------------------------------+  |             =Irregular Verbs= (_contd._).                   |  +--------------------+----------------------------------------+  |              =Andar= (to walk, to go).                      |  |_Past Def._,   |  Anduve,-iste,-uvo,-uvimos-uvisteis-uvieron.|  +--------------------+----------------------------------------+  |              =Dar= (to give).                               |  |_Pres.

[Footnote 133: Lit.: to throw the rope after the pail.]                                        LESSON XXI.                       (Leccion vigesima primera.)                       DEFECTIVE AND PRONOMINAL VERBS.      =Defective Verbs= are those only certain parts of which are in use, the  rest having never existed in the language or having died out of it.    The principal ones are--    _Soler_. \"To be wont,\" \"to be accustomed to.\" Used in the pres. indic.,  Suelo, sueles, suele, solemos, soleis, suelen; in the imperf. indic.,  Solia, solias, etc.; and in the pres. perf., He solido, has solido,  etc., as--    En su juventud solia trabajar con ahinco--ahora ya ha aflojado un poco:  When he was young he used to work with fervour, now he begins to flag a  little.    _Yacer_. \"To lie\"; generally on tombstones, as: Aqui yace: Here lies.    (In poetry, but seldom in prose, it is found conjugated throughout.)    _Salve_ and _Vale_ used in the Imperative for \"Hail!\" and \"Farewell!\"    _Placer_ (to please). Generally used in \"Plegue a Dios\" (may it please  God) and \"Pluguiera (pluguiese) a Dios\" (might it please God).    It is still used also in the 3rd pers. of Pres. Indic., Imperf. Indic,  and Past Def. (the Past Def. is \"Plugo\").      EXAMPLES--    Mucho me place: It pleases me much.    Plegue a Dios que no se declare la huelga: May it please God that a  strike is not declared.    _Abolir_ (to abolish) is irregular like \"mover\" (viz., changes _o_ into  _ue_ when stressed). Its irregular parts are however never used, and are  substituted by giving a different turn to the sentence, as--    Digo que =se debe abolir= _instead of_ =se "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15145"],[0,"My Book of Favourite Fairy Tales (#18)"],[1,"r, \"Take the money, father, and let them have me;  I'll soon come back to you.\"    [Illustration]    So the woodman at last agreed to sell Thumbling to the strangers for  a large piece of gold. \"Where do you like to sit?\" said one of them.  \"Oh! put me on the rim of your hat, that will be a nice gallery for  me; I can walk about there, and see the country as we go along.\"  So they did as he wished; and when Thumbling had taken leave of his  father, they carried him away with them. They journeyed on till it  began to be dusky, and then the little man said, \"Let me get down,  I'm tired.\" So the man took off his hat and set him down on a clod of  earth in a ploughed field by the side of the road, But Thumbling ran  about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into a mouse-hole.  \"Good-night, masters,\" said he, \"I'm off! mind and look sharp after me  the next time.\" They ran directly to the place, and poked the ends  of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain; Thumbling only  crawled further and further in, and at last it became quite dark, so  they were obliged to go their way without their prize, as sulky as you  please.    [Illustration]    When Thumbling found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place.  \"What dangerous walking it is,\" said he, \"in this ploughed field! If  I were to fall from one of these great clods, I should certainly break  my neck.\" At last, by good chance, he found a large empty snail-shell.  \"This is lucky,\" said he, \"I can sleep here very well,\" and in he  crept. Just as he was falling asleep he heard two men passing, and one  said to the other, \"How shall we manage to steal that rich parson's  silver and gold?\" \"I'll tell you,\" cried Thumbling. \"What noise was  that?\" said the thief, frightened. \"I am sure I heard some one speak.\"  They stood still listening, and Thumbling said, \"Take me with you,  and I'll soon show you how to get the parson's money.\" \"But where are  you?\" said they. \"Look about on the ground,\" answered he, \"and listen  where the sound comes from.\" At last the thieves found him out, and  lifted him up in their hands. \"You little urchin!\" said they, \"what  can you do for us?\" \"Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of  the parson's house, and throw you out whatever you want.\" \"That's a  good thought,\" said the thieves: \"come along, we shall see what you  can do.\"    When they came to the parson's house, Thumbling slipped through the  window-bars into the room, and then called out as loudly as he could  bawl, \"Will you have all that is here?\" At this the thieves were  frightened, and said \"Softly, softly, speak low that you may not  awaken anybody.\" But Thumbling pretended not to understand them, and  bawled out again, \"How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?\"  Now the cook lay in the next room, and hearing a noise she raised  herself in her bed and listened. Meanwhile the thieves were  frightened, and ran off to a little distance; but at last they plucked  up courage, and said, \"The little urchin is only trying to make fools  of us.\" So they came back and whispered softly to him, saying, \"Now,  let us have no more of your jokes, but throw out some of the money.\"  Then Thumbling called out as loudly as he could, \"Very well; hold out  your hands, here it comes.\" The cook heard this quite plainly, so she  sprang out of bed and ran to open the door. The thieves rushed off as  if a wolf were at their heels; and the maid, having groped about  and found nothing, went away for a light. By the time she returned,  Thumbling had slipped off into the barn; and when the cook had looked  about and searched every hole and corner, and found nobody, she went  to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her eyes open. The  little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a glorious  place to finish his night's rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning  to sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and  mother. But, alas! how cruelly was he disappointed! what crosses and  sorrows happen in this world! The cook got up early, before daybreak,  to feed the cows: she went straight to the hay loft, and carried away  a large bundle of hay with the little man in the middle of it fast  asleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not wake till he found  himself in the mouth of the cow, who had taken him up with a mouthful  of hay: \"Good lack-a-day!\" said he, \"how did I manage to tumble into  the mill?\" But he soon found out where he really was, and was obliged  to have all his wits about him in order that he might not get between  the cow's teeth, and so be crushed to death. At last she swallowed him  down. \"It is rather dark here,\" said he; \"they forgot to build windows  in this room to let the sun in; a candle would be no bad thing.\"    [Illustration]    Though he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters  at all; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always  coming down, and the space in which he was became smaller and smaller.  At last he cried out as loudly as he could, \"Don't bring me any more  hay! Don't bring me any more hay!\" The maid happened to be just then  milking the cow, and hearing someone speak and seeing nobody, and  yet being quite sure it was the same voice that she had heard in the  night, she was so much frightened that she fell off her stool and  overset the milk-pail. She ran off as fast as she could to her master,  the parson, and said, \"Sir, sir, the cow is talking!\" But the parson  said, \"Woman, thou art surely mad!\" However, he went with her into the  cow-house to see what was the matter. Scarcely had they set their feet  on the threshold when Thumbling called out, \"Don't bring me any more  hay!\" Then the parson himself was frightened; and thinking the cow was  surely bewitched, ordered that she should be killed directly. So the  cow was killed, and the part in which Thumbling lay was thrown away.    Thumbling soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very  easy task; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head  through, a new misfortune befell him: a hungry wolf passed by  and swallowed Thumbling and all, at a single gulp, and ran away.  Thumbling, however, was not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would  not dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called  out, \"My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.\" \"Where's that?\"  said the wolf. \"In such and such a house,\" said Thumbling, describing  his father's house, \"you can crawl through the drain into the kitchen,  and there you will find cakes, ham, beef, and everything your heart  can desire.\" The wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very  night he went to the house and crawled through the drain into the  kitchen, and ate and drank there to his heart's content. As soon as he  was satisfied, he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that  he could not get out the same way that he came in. This was just what  Thumbling had reckoned upon; and he now began to set up a great shout,  making all the noise he could. \"Will you be quiet?\" said the wolf,  \"you'll awaken everybody in the house.\" \"What's that to me?\" said the  little man, \"you have had your frolic, now I've a mind to be merry  myself;\" and he began again singing and shouting as loudly as he  could.    [Illustration: \"THE WOODMAN AND HIS WIFE, BEING AWAKENED BY THE NOISE,  PEEPED THROUGH A CRACK IN THE DOOR.\"]    The woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through  a crack in the door; but when they saw that the wolf was there, you  may well suppose that they were terribly frightened; and the woodman  ran for his axe, and gave his wife a scythe. \"Now do you stay behind,\"  said the woodman; \"and when I have knocked him on the head, do you  cut him open with the scythe.\" Thumbling heard all this, and said,  \"Father, father! I am here; the wolf has swallowed me;\" and his father  said, \"Heaven be praised! we have found our dear child again;\" and  he told his wife not to use the scythe, for fear she should hurt  him. Then he aimed a great blow, and struck the wolf on the head, and  killed him on the spot; and when he was dead they cut open his body  and set Thumbling free. \"Ah!\" said the father, \"what fears we have had  for you!\" \"Yes, father,\" answered he, \"I have travelled all over the  world, since we parted, in one way or other; and now I am very glad to  get fresh air again.\" \"Why, where have you been?\" said the father. \"I  have been in a mouse-hole, in a snail-shell, down a cow's throat, and  inside the wolf; and yet here I am again safe and sound.\" \"Well,\" said  they, \"we will not sell you again for all the riches in the world.\" So  they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty to  eat and drink, and fetched new clothes for him, for his old ones were  quite spoiled on his journey.
