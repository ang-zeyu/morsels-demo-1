This style was followed by the Louis Quinze,  inferior to it in every respect, and in which symmetry, at least in detail,  seems to be carefully avoided. It still further degenerated into the  Rococo, the most extravagant and exaggerated of all the historic styles,  and which prevailed in the latter part of the 18th and the beginning of the  19th century.    The present century cannot boast of any great characteristic style in  either architecture or ornament. Whether it is only in a course of  development, and what will be the results, time only can show. All styles  are now in vogue, hence the importance of accurate knowledge on the  subject. To be able to judge of and appreciate the best, and to profit by  the labors of those gone before us, at the same time imparting  individuality and character to our own design, should be the aim and object  of the study of decoration, and it should enter into any scheme of general  education and culture.--_Journal of Education_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE MONTAUD ACCUMULATOR.      This accumulator is of the Plante type, and is modified so as to obtain a  more rapid formation, a larger surface, and a symmetrical distance of the  plates from each other. If into an alkaline bath saturated with litharge  (added in excess) we plunge two lead electrodes and pass in a current of  suitable tension and intensity, there is deposited upon the anode a layer  of peroxide of lead varying in thickness with the intensity of the current,  and more or less rich in oxygen according to the intensity of the bath,  while the cathode is covered with a stratum of reduced lead. The liquid of  the bath supplies material for both deposits, while in galvanoplastic  operations the anode supplies it to the cathode. The principle of the  formation consists in introducing in an efficacious manner currents of a  great intensity, and thus abridging its duration.    Of two plates thus treated, the one becomes positive, and is covered with a  thick layer of peroxide of lead. On leaving the bath it undergoes various  preparations and several washings, and is then fit to be mounted along with  others to form an accumulator ready to be charged and to work. The second,  or negative, plate is covered with a thick sponge of lead. It is carefully  washed, preserved in water with exclusion of air, and submitted to a very  considerable pressure. After this operation it presents the appearance of  ordinary sheet lead, but though the physical porosity has disappeared, the  chemical porosity is intact, and this alone comes into play in  accumulators. When a negative plate is constructed in this manner, it is  ready to be combined with the positives to form an accumulator.    The inventor has sometimes put into the bath at the positive pole negative  plates prepared as just described. They become very easily peroxidized, but  they have the grave defect of requiring two preparations in place of one.  To secure an accumulator against any leakage from plate, the solderings and  the entire plates must be submerged in the liquid, so that nothing projects  up out of the acidulated water except two strong rods for making contact.  These rods are covered with an insulating varnish from their origin to  above the point where they issue from the liquid. The plates are of a  rectangular form (Fig. 1). They are sloped out at one corner, and as two  plates in juxtaposition are cut together, when they are separated the  sloping out of the one serves for the handle of the other. This handle is  doubled back on the plate which is suspended in the bath, so that the part  which has to be soldered does not undergo any preparation. A hole pierced  in this corner of the plate serves to receive a square rod of lead, which  connects the plates together and supports one of the poles or contacts of  the accumulator. At the point of soldering the doubled-down handle gives a  double thickness, and the margins of the plate are folded in such a manner  as to insure their solidity.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    The sloped out corner affords the free space necessary for the rod of the  opposite pole, and one and the same plate may be indifferently connected  either to the + or the - at the right or the left. The plates are made of  four different sizes: No. 1, 19 of which serve for an accumulator of 1  square meter; No. 2, 21, 25, or 29 of which serve for accumulators of 2, 3,  and 4 square meters; No. 3, which with 21, 25, or 29 plates composes  accumulators of 5, 6, and 7 square meters; and No. 4, which with 21, 23,  25, 27 or 29 plates forms accumulators of 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 square  meters.    As the plates are entirely submerged in the liquid their entire surface is  active, and the entire surface being absolutely flat, it is sufficient to  preserve their respective distance at any one point in order to have it  everywhere alike. The weight of the plate depends on the intended duration  of the plate and its capacity. As for the negative plate, its thickness is  the most important factor of its capacity. The proportion has yet to be  established for daily practice. The inventor uses in practice positive  plates of 0.002 meter in thickness. On the other hand, the negative plates  have a body of only 0.001 meter in thickness, their greater thickness being  due only to the deposit of compressed lead. The rod which fixes the plate  to each pole (Fig. 2) is formed of a special alloy of lead and antimony,  not attacked by acid. This gives rigidity to the rod, and hinders it from  binding when the accumulator is taken out of its case. The copper piece  which surmounts it is fitted at its base with an iron cramp, which is fixed  in the lead, and above which is a wide furrow with two grooved parts, which  being immersed in the lead hinders the copper from slipping round under the  action of the screw. The rod is square, and is cast in a single piece.  Against one of its surfaces the ends of the connected plates press flatly  up. A square form has been selected to give more surface for soldering. The  soldering is autogenous (as in the lead chambers at vitriol works). The  soldering, as well as the entire plates, is entirely immersed in the  liquid, and to prevent any leakage an insulating varnish, perfectly proof  against the acid and the current, is laid over the rod from the part  soldered upward.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    If it is wished to lift the accumulator from its chest for any  verification, hooks passing between the plates seize hold of the rods, and  thanks to the rigidity of the antimony lead, they effect the removal of the  apparatus without bending the rods in the least. All the parts of the  plates must be kept at exactly the same reciprocal distances, and a  difference of only 0.001 meter between two points is sufficient to affect  the yield considerably. For an insulating material, wood, when plunged in  dilute acid, is preferred by the inventor. He makes a comb of wood, the  teeth of which vary according to the thickness of the plates to be lodged  between them. Fig. 3 represents a comb having 15/10 of a millimeter for the  negative plates and 25/10 for the positive plates.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    This appliance, which is 0.01 meter in thickness and 0.02 meter in width in  the back, is made very cheaply by machinery. The weight of the accumulator  bears entirely upon the back of the combs, which are all placed back  downward, and the number of which varies according to the size of the  plates. Small combs of wood clasp the plates at their extremities, and make  the entire accumulator quite compact and manageable. The entire accumulator  is shut up in a wooden chest, which the outer teeth of the comb serve to  insulate from the leaden chest, and to prevent any loss of electricity  along the sides.    Fig. 4 shows the arrangement of the side combs. A single glance at this  figure shows that it would be difficult to have more surface without having  recourse to curved, undulated, or folded plates, in which the distances are  variable, and consequently defective. In the Montaud accumulator, the  weight is simply proportional to the intended duration. For the notion, \"So  much capacity and so much yield per kilo.,\" Montaud substitutes the notion,  \"So much capacity or yield per square meter, the weight not being taken  into consideration.\" These Montaud accumulators are classified as follows:  They have from 1 to 12 square meters of surface, and the number  corresponding to the surface indicates its weight of useful lead, its  manner of charging, its capacity, and its manner of discharge.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    According to the inventor's experiments, the square meter of active surface  can receive a charging current of 10 amperes, and furnish on discharging a  current of the intensity of 20 amperes. For a \"No. 10\" accumulator we have  an active surface of 10 square meters, a charging current of 100 amperes,  and on discharging a current of 200 amperes. A square meter of lead of the  thickness of 0.001 meter weighs about 11 kilos.    As both surfaces of the lead are utilized, their weight is reduced to 51/2  kilos. A No. 10 therefore requires 55 kilos. of useful lead. It will be  seen that to increase the thickness of the sheet of lead merely augments  the duration of the accumulator, without affecting its capacity or its  manner of charging and discharging. Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 may be placed in  vessels of stoneware, glass, or ebonite, or in boxes of pitch pine, painted  with three coats of gum lac and lined with sheet lead. Nos. 5 to 12 are  only sent out in pitch pine boxes lined with lead. The box is supported on  feet of porcelain of the shape of a mushroom. If a drop of water falls upon  this foot, it cannot give a communication with the earth, since, falling  upon the broad part of the mushroom, it will glide off without"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1167"],[0,"A Strange Disappearance (#18)"],[1,"\"The words were no sooner out of her mouth than her father and brother  rushed by.    \"'They will follow the light,' whispered she; and seizing me again by  the hand, she hurried me away in the direction opposite to that  which the horse had taken. 'If you will trust me, I will bring you to  shelter,' she murmured, bending her slight form to the gusty wind but  relaxing not a whit of her speed.    \"'You are too kind,' I murmured in return. 'Why should you expose  yourself to such an extent for a stranger?'    \"Her hand tightened on mine, but she did not reply, and we hastened  on as speedily as the wind and rain would allow. After a short but  determined breasting of the storm, during which my breath had nearly  failed me, she suddenly stopped.    \"'Do you know,' she exclaimed in a low impressive tone, 'that we are on  the verge of a steep and dreadful precipice? It runs along here for a  quarter of a mile and it is not an uncommon thing for a horse and rider  to be dashed over it in a night like this.'    \"There was something in her manner that awakened a chill in my veins  almost as if she had pointed out some dreadful doom which I had  unwittingly escaped.    \"'This is, then, a dangerous road,' I murmured.    \"'Very,' was her hurried and almost incoherent reply.    \"How far we travelled through the mud and tangled grasses of that  horrible road I do not know. It seemed a long distance; it was probably  not more than three quarters of a mile. At last she paused with a short  'Here we are;' and looking up, I saw that we were in front of a small  unlighted cottage.    \"No refuge ever appeared more welcome to a pair of sinking wanderers I  am sure. Wet to the skin, bedrabbled with mud, exhausted with breasting  the gale, we stood for a moment under the porch to regain our breath,  then with her characteristic energy she lifted the knocker and struck a  smart blow on the door.    \"'We will find shelter here,' said she.    \"She was not mistaken. In a few moments we were standing once more  before a comfortable fire hastily built by the worthy couple whose  slumbers we had thus interrupted. As I began to realize the sweetness of  conscious safety, all that this young, heroic creature had done for me  swept warmly across my mind. Looking up from the fire that was beginning  to infuse its heat through my grateful system, I surveyed her as she  slowly undid her long braids and shook them dry over the blaze, and  almost started to see how young she was. Not more than sixteen I should  say, and yet what an invincible will shone from her dark eyes and  dignified her slender form; a will gentle as it was strong, elevated  as it was unbending. I bowed my head as I watched her, in grateful  thankfulness which I presently put into words.    \"At once she drew herself erect. 'I did but my duty,' said she quietly.  'I am glad I was prospered in it.' Then slowly. 'If you are grateful,  sir, will you promise to say nothing of--of what took place at the inn?'    \"Instantly I remembered a suspicion which had crossed my mind while  there, and my hand went involuntarily to my vest pocket. The roll of  bills was gone.    \"She did not falter. 'I would be relieved if you would,' continued she.    \"I drew out my empty hand, looked at it, but said nothing.    \"'Have you lost anything?' asked she. 'Search in your overcoat pockets.'    \"I plunged my hand into the one nearest her and drew it out with  satisfaction; the roll of bills was there. 'I give you my promise,' said  I.    \"'You will find a bill missing,' she murmured; 'for what amount I do not  know; the sacrifice of something was inevitable.'    \"'I can only wonder over the ingenuity you displayed, as well as express  my appreciation for your bravery,' returned I with enthusiasm. 'You are  a noble girl.'    \"She put out her hand as if compliments hurt her. 'It is the first time  they have ever attempted anything like that,' cried she in a quick low  tone full of shame and suffering. 'They have shown a disposition to--to  take money sometimes, but they never threatened life before. And they  did threaten yours. They saw you take out your money, through a hole  pierced in the wall of the room you occupied, and the sight made them  mad. They were going to kill you and then tumble you and your horse over  the precipice below there. But I overheard them talking and when they  went out to saddle the horse, I hurried up to your room to wake you. I  had to take possession of the bills; you were not safe while you held  them. I took them quietly because I hoped to save you without betraying  them. But I failed in that. You must remember they are my father and my  brother.'    \"'I will not betray them,' said I.    \"She smiled. It was a wintry gleam but it ineffably softened her face. I  became conscious of a movement of pity towards her.    \"'You have a hard lot,' remarked I. 'Your life must be a sad one.'    \"She flashed upon me one glance of her dark eye. 'I was born for  hardship,' said she, 'but--' and a sudden wild shudder seized her, 'but  not for crime.'    \"The word fell like a drop of blood wrung from her heart.    \"'Good heavens!' cried I, 'and must you--'    \"'No,' rang from her lips in a clarion-like peal; 'some things cut the  very bonds of nature. I am not called upon to cleave to what will drag  me into infamy.' Then calmly, as if speaking of the most ordinary matter  in the world, 'I shall never go back to that house we have left behind  us, sir.'    \"'But,' cried I, glancing at her scanty garments, 'where will you go?  What will you do? You are young--'    \"'And very strong,' she interrupted. 'Do not fear for me.' And her smile  was like a burst of sudden sunshine.    \"I said no more that night.    \"But when in the morning I stumbled upon her sitting in the kitchen  reading a book not only above her position but beyond her years,  a sudden impulse seized me and I asked her if she would like to be  educated. The instantaneous illumining of her whole face was sufficient  reply without her low emphatic words,    \"'I would be content to study on my knees to know what some women do,  whom I have seen.'    \"It is not necessary for me to relate with what pleasure I caught at  the idea that here was a chance to repay in some slight measure the  inestimable favor she had done me; nor by what arguments I finally won  her to accept an education at my hands as some sort of recompense for  the life she had saved. The advantage which it would give her in her  struggle with the world she seemed duly to appreciate, but that so  great a favor could be shown her without causing me much trouble and an  unwarrantable expense, she could not at once be brought to comprehend,  and till she could, she held out with that gentle but inflexible will of  hers. The battle, however, was won at last and I left her in that little  cottage, with the understanding that as soon as the matter could be  arranged, she was to enter a certain boarding-school in Troy with the  mistress of which I was acquainted. Meanwhile she was to go out to  service at Melville and earn enough money to provide herself with  clothes.    \"I was a careless fellow in those days but I kept my promise to that  girl. I not only entered her into that school for a course of three  years, but acting through its mistress who had taken a great fancy to  her, supplied her with the necessities her position required. It was so  easy; merely the signing of a check from time to time, and it was  done. I say this because I really think if it had involved any personal  sacrifice on my part, even of an hour of my time, or the labor of a  thought, I should not have done it. For with my return to the city my  interest in my cousin revived, absorbing me to such an extent that any  matter disconnected with her soon lost all charm for me.    \"Two years passed; I was the slave of Evelyn Blake, but there was no  engagement between us. My father's determined opposition was enough to  prevent that. But there was an understanding which I fondly hoped would  one day open for me the way of happiness. But I did not know my father.  Sick as he was--he was at that time laboring under the disease which in  a couple of months later bore him to the tomb--he kept an eye upon my  movements and seemed to probe my inmost heart. At last he came to a  definite decision and spoke.    \"His words opened a world of dismay before me. I was his only child, as  he remarked, and it had been and was the desire of his heart to leave  me as rich and independent a man as himself. But I seemed disposed  to commit one of those acts against which he had the most determined  prejudice; marriage between cousins being in his eyes an unsanctified  and dangerous proceeding, liable to consequences the most unhappy. If I  persisted, he must will his property elsewhere. The Blake estate should  never descend with the seal of his approbation to a race of probable  imbeciles.    \"Nor was this enough. He not only robbed me of the woman I loved,  but with a clear insight into the future, I presume, insisted upon  my marrying some one else of respectability and worth before he died.  'Anyone whose appearance will do you credit and whose virtue is beyond  reproach,' said he. 'I don't ask her to be rich or even the offspring of  one of our old families. Let her be good and pure and of no connection  to us, and I will bless her and you with my dying breath.'    \"The idea had seized upon him with great force, and I soon saw he was  not to be shaken out of it. To all my objections he returned but the one  word,    \"'I don't restrict your choice and I give you a month in which to  make it. If at the end of that time you cannot bring your bride to my  bedside, I must look around for an heir who will not thwart my dying  wishes.'\"    \"A month! I surveyed the fashionable belles that nightly thronged the  parlors of my friends and felt my heart sink within me. Take one of them  for my wife, loving another"]]]
