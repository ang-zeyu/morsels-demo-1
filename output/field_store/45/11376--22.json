I hasten not to publish; perishing I       would prevent. And I am forced to respect as well my times as the       matter. For with me it is thus, and I think with all men in my       case, if I bind myself to an argument, it loadeth my mind; but if I       rid my mind of the present cogitation, it is rather a recreation.       This hath put me into these miscellanies, which I purpose to       suppress, if God give me leave to write a just and perfect volume       of philosophy, which I go on with, though slowly. I send not your       Lordship too much, lest it may glut you. Now let me tell you what       my desire is. If your Lordship be so good now as when you were the       good Dean of Westminster, my request to you is, that not by pricks,       but by notes, you would mark unto me whatsoever shall seem unto you       either not current in the style, or harsh to credit and opinion, or       inconvenient for the person of the writer; for no man can be judge       and party, and when our minds judge by reflection of ourselves,       they are more subject to error. And though for the matter itself my       judgement be in some things fixed, and not accessible by any man's       judgement that goeth not my way, yet even in those things the       admonition of a friend may make me express myself diversly. I would       have come to your Lordship, but that I am hastening to my house in       the country. And so I commend your Lordship to God's goodness.\"    There was yet another production of this time, of which we have a  notice from himself in a letter to Toby Matthews, the curious and  ingenious little treatise on the _Wisdom of the Ancients_, \"one of the  most popular of his works,\" says Mr. Spedding, \"in his own and in the  next generation,\" but of value to us mainly for its quaint poetical  colour, and the unexpected turns, like answers to a riddle, given to the  ancient fables. When this work was published, it was the third time that  he had appeared as an author in print. He thus writes about it and  himself:         \"MR. MATTHEWS,--I do heartily thank you for your letter of the 24th       of August from Salamanca; and in recompense thereof I send you a       little work of mine that hath begun to pass the world. They tell me       my Latin is turned into silver, and become current. Had you been       here, you should have been my inquisitor before it came forth; but       I think the greatest inquisitor in Spain will allow it.... My great       work goeth forward, and, after my manner, I alter ever when I add.       So that nothing is finished till all be finished.         \"From Gray's Inn, the 17th of February, 1610.\"    In the autumn of 1611 the Attorney-General was ill, and Bacon reminded  both the King and Salisbury of his claim. He was afraid, he writes to  the King, with an odd forgetfulness of the persistency and earnestness  of his applications, \"that _by reason of my slowness to sue_, and  apprehend occasions upon the sudden, keeping one plain course of painful  service, I may _in fine dierum_ be in danger to be neglected and  forgotten.\" The Attorney recovered, but Bacon, on New Year's Tide of  1611/12, wrote to Salisbury to thank him for his good-will. It is the  last letter of Bacon's to Salisbury which has come down to us.         \"IT MAY PLEASE YOUR GOOD LORDSHIP,--I would entreat the new year to       answer for the old, in my humble thanks to your Lordship, both for       many your favours, and chiefly that upon the occasion of Mr.       Attorney's infirmity I found your Lordship even as I would wish.       This doth increase a desire in me to express my thankful mind to       your Lordship; hoping that though I find age and decays grow upon       me, yet I may have a flash or two of spirit left to do you service.       And I do protest before God, without compliment or any light vein       of mind, that if I knew in what course of life to do you best       service, I would take it, and make my thoughts, which now fly to       many pieces, be reduced to that center. But all this is no more       than I am, which is not much, but yet the entire of him that is--\"    In the following May (May 24, 1612) Salisbury died. From this date James  passed from government by a minister, who, whatever may have been his  faults, was laborious, public-spirited, and a statesman, into his own  keeping and into the hands of favourites, who cared only for themselves.  With Cecil ceased the traditions of the days of Elizabeth and Burghley,  in many ways evil and cruel traditions, but not ignoble and sordid ones;  and James was left without the stay, and also without the check, which  Cecil's power had been to him. The field was open for new men and new  ways; the fashions and ideas of the time had altered during the last ten  years, and those of the Queen's days had gone out of date. Would the new  turn out for the better or the worse? Bacon, at any rate, saw the  significance of the change and the critical eventfulness of the moment.  It was his habit of old to send memorials of advice to the heads of the  Government, apparently without such suggestions seeming more intrusive  or officious than a leading article seems now, and perhaps with much the  same effect. It was now a time to do so, if ever; and he was in an  official relation to the King which entitled him to proffer advice. He  at once prepared to lay his thoughts before the King, and to suggest  that he could do far better service than Cecil, and was ready to take  his place. The policy of the \"Great Contract\" had certainly broken  down, and the King, under Cecil's guidance, had certainly not known how  to manage an English parliament. In writing to the King he found it hard  to satisfy himself. Several draft letters remain, and it is not certain  which of them, if any, was sent. But immediately on Salisbury's death he  began, May 29th, a letter in which he said that he had never yet been  able to show his affection to the King, \"having been as a hawk tied to  another's fist;\" and if, \"as was said to one that spake great words,  _Amice, verba tua desiderant civitatem_, your Majesty say to me, _Bacon,  your words require a place to speak them_,\" yet that \"place or not  place\" was with the King. But the draft breaks off abruptly, and with  the date of the 31st we have the following:         \"Your Majesty hath lost a great subject and a great servant. But if       I should praise him in propriety, I should say that he was a fit       man to keep things from growing worse, but no very fit man to       reduce things to be much better. For he loved to have the eyes of       all Israel a little too much upon himself, and to have all business       still under the hammer, and like clay in the hands of the potter,       to mould it as he thought good; so that he was more _in operatione_       than _in opere_. And though he had fine passages of action, yet the       real conclusions came slowly on. So that although your Majesty hath       grave counsellors and worthy persons left, yet you do as it were       turn a leaf, wherein if your Majesty shall give a frame and       constitution to matters, before you place the persons, in my simple       opinion it were not amiss. But the great matter and most instant       for the present, is the consideration of a Parliament, for two       effects: the one for the supply of your estate, the other for the       better knitting of the hearts of your subjects unto your Majesty,       according to your infinite merit; for both which, Parliaments have       been and are the antient and honourable remedy.         \"Now because I take myself to have a little skill in that region,       as one that ever affected that your Majesty mought in all your       causes not only prevail, but prevail with satisfaction of the inner       man; and though no man can say but I was a perfect and peremptory       royalist, yet every man makes me believe that I was never one hour       out of credit with the Lower House; my desire is to know whether       your Majesty will give me leave to meditate and propound unto you       some preparative remembrances touching the future Parliament.\"    Whether he sent this or not, he prepared another draft. What had  happened in the mean while we know not, but Bacon was in a bitter mood,  and the letter reveals, for the first time, what was really in Bacon's  heart about the \"great subject and great servant,\" of whom he had just  written so respectfully, and with whom he had been so closely connected  for most of his life. The fierceness which had been gathering for years  of neglect and hindrance under that placid and patient exterior broke  out. He offered himself as Cecil's successor in business of State. He  gave his reason for being hopeful of success. Cecil's bitterest enemy  could not have given it more bitterly.         \"My principal end being to do your Majesty service, I crave leave       to make at this time to your Majesty this most humble oblation of       myself. I may truly say with the psalm, _Multum incola fuit anima       mea_, for my life hath been conversant in things wherein I take       little pleasure. Your Majesty may have heard somewhat that my       father was an honest man, and somewhat you may have seen of myself,       though not to make any true judgement by, because I have hitherto       had only _potestatem verborum_, nor that neither. I was three of my       young years bred with an ambassador in France, and since I have       been an old truant in the school-house of your council-chamber,       though on the second form, yet longer than any that now sitteth"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13893"],[0,"Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents: William McKinley; (#18)"],[1,"of this country in Central America was neither  recommended by the Executive nor initiated by Congress, thus leaving one  of our envoys accredited, as heretofore, separately to two States of the  Greater Republic, Nicaragua and Salvador, and to a third State, Costa  Rica, which was not a party to the compact, while our other envoy was  similarly accredited to a union State, Honduras, and a nonunion State,  Guatemala. The result has been that the one has presented credentials  only to the President of Costa Rica, the other having been received only  by the Government of Guatemala.    Subsequently the three associated Republics entered into negotiations  for taking the steps forecast in the original compact. A convention of  their delegates framed for them a federal constitution under the name of  the United States of Central America, and provided for a central federal  government and legislature. Upon ratification by the constituent States,  the 1st of November last was fixed for the new system to go into  operation. Within a few weeks thereafter the plan was severely tested  by revolutionary movements arising, with a consequent demand for unity  of action on the part of the military power of the federal States to  suppress them. Under this strain the new union seems to have been  weakened through the withdrawal of its more important members. This  Government was not officially advised of the installation of the  federation and has maintained an attitude of friendly expectancy, while  in no wise relinquishing the position held from the outset that the  responsibilities of the several States toward us remained unaltered by  their tentative relations among themselves.    The Nicaragua Canal Commission, under the chairmanship of Rear-Admiral  John G. Walker, appointed July 24, 1897, under the authority of a  provision in the sundry civil act of June 4 of that year, has nearly  completed its labors, and the results of its exhaustive inquiry into the  proper route, the feasibility, and the cost of construction of an  interoceanic canal by a Nicaraguan route will be laid before you. In the  performance of its task the commission received all possible courtesy  and assistance from the Governments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, which  thus testified their appreciation of the importance of giving a speedy  and practical outcome to the great project that has for so many years  engrossed the attention of the respective countries.    As the scope of the recent inquiry embraced the whole subject, with the  aim of making plans and surveys for a canal by the most convenient  route, it necessarily included a review of the results of previous  surveys and plans, and in particular those adopted by the Maritime Canal  Company under its existing concessions from Nicaragua and Costa Rica, so  that to this extent those grants necessarily hold as essential a part  in the deliberations and conclusions of the Canal Commission as they  have held and must needs hold in the discussion of the matter by the  Congress. Under these circumstances and in view of overtures made to the  Governments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica by other parties for a new canal  concession predicated on the assumed approaching lapse of the contracts  of the Maritime Canal Company with those States, I have not hesitated  to express my conviction that considerations of expediency and  international policy as between the several governments interested in  the construction and control of an interoceanic canal by this route  require the maintenance of the _status quo_ until the Canal  Commission shall have reported and the United States Congress shall have  had the opportunity to pass finally upon the whole matter during the  present session, without prejudice by reason of any change in the  existing conditions.    Nevertheless, it appears that the Government of Nicaragua, as one  of its last sovereign acts before merging its powers in those of the  newly formed United States of Central America, has granted an optional  concession to another association, to become effective on the expiration  of the present grant. It does not appear what surveys have been made  or what route is proposed under this contingent grant, so that an  examination of the feasibility of its plans is necessarily not embraced  in the report of the Canal Commission. All these circumstances suggest  the urgency of some definite action by the Congress at this session  if the labors of the past are to be utilized and the linking of the  Atlantic and Pacific oceans by a practical waterway is to be realized.  That the construction of such a maritime highway is now more than ever  indispensable to that intimate and ready intercommunication between our  eastern and western seaboards demanded by the annexation of the Hawaiian  Islands and the prospective expansion of our influence and commerce in  the Pacific, and that our national policy now more imperatively than  ever calls for its control by this Government, are propositions which  I doubt not the Congress will duly appreciate and wisely act upon.    A convention providing for the revival of the late United States and  Chilean Claims Commission and the consideration of claims which were  duly presented to the late commission, but not considered because of the  expiration of the time limited for the duration of the commission, was  signed May 24, 1897, and has remained unacted upon by the Senate. The  term therein fixed for effecting the exchange of ratifications having  elapsed, the convention falls unless the time be extended by amendment,  which I am endeavoring to bring about, with the friendly concurrence of  the Chilean Government.    The United States has not been an indifferent spectator of the  extraordinary events transpiring in the Chinese Empire, whereby portions  of its maritime provinces are passing under the control of various  European powers; but the prospect that the vast commerce which the  energy of our citizens and the necessity of our staple productions for  Chinese uses has built up in those regions may not be prejudiced through  any exclusive treatment by the new occupants has obviated the need of  our country becoming an actor in the scene. Our position among nations,  having a large Pacific coast and a constantly expanding direct trade  with the farther Orient, gives us the equitable claim to consideration  and friendly treatment in this regard, and it will be my aim to subserve  our large interests in that quarter by all means appropriate to the  constant policy of our Government. The territories of Kiao-chow, of  Wei-hai-wei, and of Port Arthur and Talienwan, leased to Germany,  Great Britain, and Russia, respectively, for terms of years, will,  it is announced, be open to international commerce during such alien  occupation; and if no discriminating treatment of American citizens and  their trade be found to exist or be hereafter developed, the desire of  this Government would appear to be realized.    In this relation, as showing the volume and value of our exchanges with  China and the peculiarly favorable conditions which exist for their  expansion in the normal course of trade, I refer to the communication  addressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives by the  Secretary of the Treasury on the 14th of last June, with its  accompanying letter of the Secretary of State, recommending an  appropriation for a commission to study the commercial and industrial  conditions in the Chinese Empire and report as to the opportunities  for and obstacles to the enlargement of markets in China for the  raw products and manufactures of the United States. Action was not  taken thereon during the late session. I cordially urge that the  recommendation receive at your hands the consideration which its  importance and timeliness merit.    Meanwhile there may be just ground for disquietude in view of the unrest  and revival of the old sentiment of opposition and prejudice to alien  people which pervades certain of the Chinese provinces. As in the case  of the attacks upon our citizens in Szechuen and at Kutien in 1895, the  United States minister has been instructed to secure the fullest measure  of protection, both local and imperial, for any menaced American  interests, and to demand, in case of lawless injury to person or  property, instant reparation appropriate to the case. War ships have  been stationed at Tientsin for more ready observation of the disorders  which have invaded even the Chinese capital, so as to be in a position  to act should need arise, while a guard of marines has been sent to  Peking to afford the minister the same measure of authoritative  protection as the representatives of other nations have been constrained  to employ.    Following close upon the rendition of the award of my predecessor as  arbitrator of the claim of the Italian subject Cerruti against the  Republic of Colombia, differences arose between the parties to the  arbitration in regard to the scope and extension of the award, of which  certain articles were contested by Colombia, while Italy claimed their  literal fulfillment. The award having been made by the President of the  United States, as an act of friendly consideration and with the sole  view to an impartial composition of the matter in dispute, I could  not but feel deep concern at such a miscarriage, and while unable to  accept the Colombian theory that I, in my official capacity, possessed  continuing functions as arbitrator, with power to interpret or revise  the terms of the award, my best efforts were lent to bring the parties  to a harmonious agreement as to the execution of its provisions.    A naval demonstration by Italy resulted in an engagement to pay  the liabilities claimed upon their ascertainment; but this apparent  disposition of the controversy was followed by a rupture of diplomatic  intercourse between Colombia and Italy, which still continues, although,  "]]]
