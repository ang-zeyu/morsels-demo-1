He used to work for my father. He isn't half so  foolish as he looks, either. As for that wagon you used as a life  preserver, I am proud to say that it was once mine.\"    \"It must have been made especially strong,\" observed Reddy.    \"It was. Hickory and iron were the materials used, I believe. I played  with it when but a toddling che-ild,\" continued Hippy, \"and also smashed  three before my father had this one made to order. ''Twas ever thus from  childhood's earliest hour,'\" he added mournfully. \"I always had to have  things made to order.\"    There was a shout of laughter at Hippy's last remark. From infancy Hippy  had been the prize fat boy of Oakdale.    \"It's only seven o'clock,\" said David. I move that we hunt up the girls  and have a party. That is, if Grace is willing.\"    \"That will be fine,\" cried Grace.    Hippy and Reddy were despatched to find Nora and Jessica. While David took  upon himself the pleasant task of going for Anne. Tom remained with  Grace. He had a boyish admiration for this straightforward, gray-eyed girl  and made no secret of his preference for her.    Inside of an hour the sound of girls' voices outside proclaimed the fact  that the boys' mission had not been in vain. The girls had been informed  by their escorts of the afternoon's happenings, but Grace and Tom were  obliged to tell the story all over again.    \"I hope Julia Crosby's ice bath will have a subduing effect upon her,\"  said Nora. \"I am glad, of course, that she didn't lose her life, but I'm  not sorry she got a good ducking. She deserved something for the way she  dragged Anne into that game of crack the whip.\"    \"Let's talk about something pleasant,\" proposed Reddy.    \"Me, for instance,\" said Hippy, with a Cheshire cat grin. \"I am a thing of  beauty, and, consequently, a joy forever.\"    \"Smother him with a sofa pillow!\" commanded Tom. \"He is too conceited to  live.\"    Reddy seized the unfortunate Hippy by the back of the neck, while David  covered the fat youth with pillows until only his feet were visible and  the smothering process was carried on with great glee until Nora  mercifully came to his rescue.          CHAPTER XV    A BELATED REPENTANCE      The following Monday as Grace Harlowe was about to leave the schoolroom,  Julia Crosby's younger sister, one of the freshman class, handed her a  note. It was from Julia, and read as follows:        \"DEAR GRACE:        \"Will you come and see me this afternoon when school is over? I      have a severe cold, and am unable to be out of bed. I have      something I must say to you that cannot wait until I get back to      school.        \"Your sincere friend,                          \"JULIA\"    \"Oh, dear!\" thought Grace. \"I don't want to go up there. Her mother will  fall upon my neck and weep, and tell me I saved Julia's life. I know her  of old. She's one of the weeping kind. I suppose it's my duty to go,  however.\"    Grace's prognostication was fulfilled to the letter. Mrs. Crosby clasped  her in a tumultuous embrace the moment she entered the hall. Grace finally  escaped from her, and was shown up to Julia's room.    She looked about her with some curiosity. It was a light airy room,  daintily furnished. Julia was lying on the pretty brass bed in one corner  of the room. She wore a dressing gown of pale blue eiderdown, and Grace  thought she had never seen her old enemy look better.    \"How do you do, Julia?\" she said, walking over to the bed and holding out  her hand to the invalid.    \"Not very well,\" responded Julia hoarsely. \"I have a bad cold and am too  weak to be up.\"    \"I'm sorry,\" said Grace, \"the wetting didn't hurt me in the least. But, of  course, I wasn't in the water like you were. It didn't hurt Tom, either.\"    \"I'm glad you are both all right,\" said Julia.    She looked solemnly at Grace, and then said hesitatingly, \"Grace, I didn't  deserve to be rescued the other day. I've been awfully mean to you.\" She  buried her face in the bed clothing and sobbed convulsively.    \"Julia, Julia, please don't cry,\" said Grace, her quick sympathy aroused  by the distress of another. \"Did you think we would leave you to drown?  You would have done the same for me. Don't you know that people never  think of petty differences when real trouble arises?\"    She laid her hand upon the head of the weeping girl. After a little the  sobs ceased and Julia sat up and wiped her eyes.    \"Bring that chair over and sit down beside me, Grace. I want to tell you  everything,\" she said. \"Last year I was perfectly horrid to you and that  little Pierson girl, for no earthly reason either, I thought it was smart  to annoy you and torment you. After we had the quarrel that day in the  gymnasium, I was really angry with you, and determined to pay you back.    \"You know, of course, that I purposely tripped you the day of the  basketball game. I was awfully shocked when I found you had sprained your  ankle, but I was too cowardly to confess that I did it. Miss Thompson  would have suspended me from school. I didn't know whether you knew that I  had done it until I met you that day in the corridor, and the way you  looked at me made me feel miserable. Then we got hold of your signals.\"    She paused.    Grace leaned forward in her chair in an agony of suspense.    \"Julia,\" she said, \"I don't care what you did to me; but won't you please  say that Anne didn't give you those signals?\"    \"Miss Pierson did not give them to me,\" was the quick reply.    \"I'm so glad to hear you say it,\" Grace answered. \"I knew she was  innocent, but the girls have distrusted her all year. She lost the list  accidentally, you know, but they wouldn't believe that she did.\"    \"Yes, I heard that she did,\" said Julia. \"The list was given to me, but I  am not at liberty to tell who gave it. It was not your Anne, although I  was too mean to say so, even when I knew that she had been accused. I'll  write you a statement to that effect if you want me to do so. That will  clear her.\"    \"Oh, Julia, will you truly? I want it more than anything else in the whole  world. A statement from you will carry more weight with the girls than  anything I could possibly tell them. It will convince the doubters, you  know. There are sure to be some who will insist on being skeptical.\"    Acting under Julia's direction, Grace brought a little writing case from a  nearby table, Julia opened it, selected a sheet of paper and wrote in a  firm, clear hand:    \"To the members of the sophomore class, and to all those whom it may  concern:    \"The accusation made against Anne Pierson last fall regarding the betrayal  of the basketball signals to the junior team is false. Our knowledge of  these signals came from an entirely different source.            \"JULIA CROSBY,       Capt. Junior Team.\"    \"And now,\" concluded Julia, \"I have done something toward straightening  out the mischief I made. Will you forgive me, Grace, and try to think of  me as your friend?\"    \"With all my heart,\" replied Grace, kissing her warmly. \"And I am so happy  to-day. Just think, the junior and sophomore classes will be at peace at  last.\"    The two girls looked into each other's eyes, and both began to laugh.    \"After two years' war the hatchet will be buried,\" said Julia a little  tremulously.    \"Oh, Julia!\" exclaimed Grace, hopping about, \"I've a perfectly splendid  idea!\"    \"What is it?\" asked Julia breathlessly.    \"Let's have a grand blow out and bury the hatchet with pomp and ceremony.  We'll have speeches from both classes, and a perfectly gorgeous feed  afterwards. You break the news to your class and I'll endeavor to get my  naughty children under control once more. I believe some of them love me a  little yet,\" she smiled.    \"Of course, they do,\" said Julia stoutly. \"I must say I don't see why they  were so hateful to you, even if Anne Pierson were under suspicion. I know  I am to blame for helping the grudge along,\" she added remorsefully, \"but  I am, not the only one.\"    \"I know,\" said Grace quickly. \"There are lots of things I'd like to say,  but for certain reasons of my own I shall not say them. You understand, I  think.\"    Julia nodded. She did, indeed, understand, and the full beauty of Grace  Harlowe's nobility of spirit was revealed to her.    \"You are the finest, squarest girl I ever knew, Grace,\" she said  admiringly.    \"Nonsense,\" laughed Grace, flushing a little at the tribute paid her by  the once arrogant junior captain. \"You don't know me at all. I have just  as many faults as other girls, with a few extra ones thrown in. I have no  claim to a pedestal. I hope we shall be friends for the rest of our  schooldays and forever after. You will be a senior next year, and I shall  be a junior. It's time we put by childish quarrels, and assumed the high  and mighty attitude of the upper classes. It is our duty to become a  living example to erring freshmen.\"    Both girls laughed merrily; then Grace rose to go. She kissed Julia  good-bye and walked out of the house as though on air. Her cup of  happiness was full to the brim. She carefully tucked the precious paper  away in her bag and sped down the street on winged feet.    The incredible had come to pass. Her old-time enemy had become her friend.  She wondered if it could have ever come about by any other means. She  doubted it. She had always heard that \"Desperate cases require desperate  remedies.\" The happenings of the past week seemed conclusive proof of the  truth of the saying. Furthermore, she believed in the sincerity of Julia  Crosby's repentance. It was more than skin deep. She felt that  henceforward Julia would be different. Best of all, she had the reward of  her own conscience. In being true to Anne she had been true to herself.
