All that  the poets have sung of the actions of men is now received as  revelation from heaven; though nothing can be more monstrous than the  actions attributed to the best incarnation, Krishna, of the best of  their gods, Vishnu.[6]    'No doubt', said Salamat Ali; 'and had they ever had a real prophet  among them he would have revealed better things to them. Strange  people! when their women go on pilgrimages to Gaya, they have their  heads shaved before the image of their god; and the offering of the  hair is equivalent to the offer of their heads;[7] for heads, thank  God, they dare no longer offer within the Company's territories.'    'Do you. Mir Sahib, think that they continue to offer up human  sacrifices anywhere?'    'Certainly I do. There is a Raja at Ratanpur, or somewhere between  Mandla and Sambalpur, who has a man offered up to Devi every year,  and that man must be a Brahman. If he can get a Brahman traveller,  well and good; if not, he and his priests offer one of his own  subjects. Every Brahman that has to pass through this territory goes  in disguise.[8] With what energy did our emperor Aurangzeb apply  himself to put down iniquities like this in the Rajputana states, but  all in vain. If a Raja died, all his numerous wives burnt themselves  with his body--even their servants, male and female, were obliged to  do the same; for, said his friends, what is he to do in the next  world without attendants? The pile was enormous. On the top sat the  queen with the body of the prince; the servants, male and female,  according to their degree, below; and a large army stood all round to  drive into the fire again or kill all who should attempt to  escape.'[9]    'This is all very true, Mir Sahib, but you must admit that, though  there is a great deal of absurdity in their customs and opinions,  there is, on the other hand, much that we might all take an example  from. The Hindoo believes that Christians and Musalmans may be as  good men in all relations of life as himself, and in as fair a way to  heaven as he is; for he believes that my Bible and your Koran are as  much revelations framed by the Deity for our guidance, as the  Shastras are for his. He doubts not that our Christ was the Son of  God, nor that Muhammad was the prophet of God; and all that he asks  from us is to allow him freely to believe in his own gods, and to  worship in his own way. Nor does one caste or sect of Hindoos ever  believe itself to be alone in the right way, or detest any other for  not following in the same path, as they have as much of toleration  for each other as they have for us.[10]    'True,' exclaimed Salamat Ali, 'too true! we have ruined each other;  we have cut each other's throats; we have lost the empire, and we  deserve to lose it. You won it, and you preserved it by your _union_-  -ten men with one heart are equal to a hundred men with different  hearts. A Hindoo may feel himself authorized to take in a Musalman,  and might even think it _meritorious_ to do so; but he would never  think it meritorious to take in one of his own religion. There are no  less than seventy-two sects of Muhammadans; and every one of these  sects would not only take in the followers of every other religion on  earth, but every member of every one of the other seventy-one sects;  and the nearer that sect is to its own, the greater the merit in  taking in its members.'[11]    'Something has happened of late to annoy you, I fear, Mir Sahib?'    'Something happens to annoy us every day, sir, where we are more than  one sect of us together; and wherever you find Musalmans you will  find them divided into sects.'    It is not, perhaps, known to many of my countrymen in India that in  every city and town in the country the right of sweeping the houses  and streets is one of the most intolerable of monopolies, supported  entirely by the pride of caste among the scavengers, who are all of  the lowest class. The right of sweeping within a certain range is  recognized by the caste to belong to a certain member; and, if any  other member presumes to sweep within that range, he is  excommunicated--no other member will smoke out of his pipe, or drink  out of his jug; and he can get restored to caste only by a feast to  the whole body of sweepers. If any housekeeper within a particular  circle happens to offend the sweeper of that range, none of his filth  will be removed till he pacifies him, because no other sweeper will  dare to touch it; and the people of a town are often more tyrannized  over by these people than by any other.[12]    It is worthy of remark that in India the spirit of combination is  always in the inverse ratio to the rank of the class; weakest in the  highest, and strongest in the lowest class. All infringements upon  the rules of the class are punished by fines. Every fine furnishes a  feast at which every member sits and enjoys himself. Payment is  enforced by excommunication--no one of the caste will eat, drink, or  smoke with the convicted till the fine is paid; and, as every one  shares in the fine, every one does his best to enforce payment. The  fines are imposed by the elders, who know the circumstances of the  culprit, and fix the amount accordingly. Washermen will often at a  large station combine to prevent the washermen of one gentleman from  washing the clothes of the servants of any other gentleman, or the  servants of one gentleman from getting their clothes washed by any  other person than their own master's washerman. This enables them  sometimes to raise the rate of washing to double the fair or ordinary  rate; and at such places the washermen are always drunk with one  continued routine of feasts from the fines levied.[13] The cost of  these fees falls ultimately upon the poor servants or their masters.  This combination, however, is not always for bad or selfish purposes.  I was once on the staff of an officer commanding a brigade on  service, whose elephant driver exercised an influence over him that  was often mischievous and sometimes dangerous;[14] for in marching  and choosing his ground, this man was more often consulted than the  quarter-master-general. His bearing was most insolent, and became  intolerable, as well to the European gentlemen as to the people of  his caste.[15] He at last committed himself by saying that he would  spit in the face of another gentleman's elephant driver with whom he  was disputing. All the elephant drivers in our large camp were  immediately assembled, and it was determined in council to refer the  matter to the decision of the Raja of Darbhanga's driver, who was  acknowledged the head of the class. We were all breakfasting with the  brigadier after muster when the reply came-the distance to Darbhanga  from Nathpur on the Kusi river, where we then were, must have been a  hundred and fifty miles.[16] We saw men running in all directions  through the camp, without knowing why, till at last one came and  summoned the brigadier's driver. With a face of terror he came and  implored the protection of the brigadier; who got angry, and fumed a  good deal, but seeing no expression of sympathy on the faces of his  officers, he told the man to go and hear his sentence. He was  escorted to a circle formed by all the drivers in camp, who were  seated on the grass. The offender was taken into the middle of the  circle and commanded to stand on one leg[17] while the Raja's  driver's letter was read. He did so, and the letter directed him to  apologize to the offended party, pay a heavy fine for a feast, and  pledge himself to the offended drivers never to offend again. All the  officers in camp were delighted, and some, who went to hear the  sentence explained, declared that in no court in the world could the  thing have been done with more solemnity and effect. The man's  character was quite altered by it, and he became the most docile of  drivers. On the same principle here stated of enlisting the community  in the punishment of offenders, the New Zealanders, and other savage  tribes who have been fond of human flesh, have generally been found  to confine the feast to the body of those who were put to death for  offences against the state or the individual. I and all the officers  of my regiment were at one time in the habit of making every servant  who required punishment or admonition to bring immediately, and give  to the first religious mendicant we could pick up, the fine we  thought just. All the religionists in the neighbourhood declared that  justice had never been so well administered in any other regiment; no  servant got any sympathy from them--they were all told that their  masters were far too lenient.    We crossed the Hiran river[18] about ten miles from our last ground  on the 22nd,[19] and came on two miles to our tents in a mango grove  close to the town of Katangi,[20] and under the Vindhya range of  sandstone hills, which rise almost perpendicular to the height of  some eight hundred feet over the town. This range from Katangi skirts  the Nerbudda valley to the north, as the Satpura range skirts it to  the south; and both are of the same sandstone formation capped with  basalt upon which here and there are found masses of laterite, or  iron clay. Nothing has ever yet been found reposing upon this iron  clay.[21] The strata of this range have a gentle and almost  imperceptible dip to the north, at right angles to its face which  overlooks the valley, and this face has everywhere the appearance of  a range of gigantic round bastions projecting into what was perhaps a  lake, and is now a well-peopled, well-cultivated, and very happy  valley, about twenty miles wide. The river crosses and recrosses it  diagonally.

CHAPTER III    COLONIAL WOMAN AND THE HOME      _I. The Charm of the Colonial Home_    After all, it is in the home that the soul of the colonial woman is  fully revealed. We may say in all truthfulness that there never was a  time when the home wielded a greater influence than during the colonial  period of American history. For the home was then indeed the center and  heart of social life. There were no men's clubs, no women's societies,  no theatres, no moving pictures, no suffrage meetings, none of the  hundred and one exterior activities that now call forth both father and  mother from the home circle. The home of pre-revolutionary days was far  more than a place where the family ate and slept. Its simplicity, its  confidence, its air of security and permanence, and its atmosphere of  refuge or haven of rest are characteristics to be grasped in their true  significance only through a thorough reading of the writings of those  early days. The colonial woman had never received a diploma in domestic  science or home economics; she had never heard of balanced diets; she  had never been taught the arrangement of color schemes; but she knew the  secret of making from four bare walls the sacred institution with all  its subtle meanings comprehended under the one word, home.    All home life, of course, was not ideal. There were idle, slovenly  women, misguided female fanatics, as there are to-day. Too often in  considering the men and women who made colonial history we are liable to  think that all were of the stamp of Winthrop, Bradford, Sewall, Adams,  and Washington. Instead, they were people like the readers of this book,  neither saints nor depraved sinners. In later chapters we shall see that  many broke the laws of man and God, enforced cruel penalties on their  brothers and sisters, frequently disobeyed the ten commandments, and  balanced their charity with malice. Then, too, there was an ungentle,  rough, coarse element in the under-strata of society--an element  accentuated under the uncouth pioneer conditions. But, in the main, we  may believe that the great majority of citizens of New England, the  substantial traders and merchants of the middle colonies, and the  planters of the South, were law-abiding, God-fearing people who believed  in the sanctity of their homes and cherished them. We shall see that  these homes were well worth cherishing.      _II. Domestic Love and Confidence_    In this discussion of the colonial home, as in previous discussions, we  must depend for information far more upon the writings by men than upon  those by women. Yet, here and there, in the diaries and letters of wives  and mothers we catch glimpses of what the institution meant to  women--glimpses of that deep, abiding love and faith that have made the  home a favorite theme of song and story. In the correspondence between  husband and wife we have conclusive evidence that woman was held in high  respect, her advice often asked, and her influence marked. The letters  of Governor Winthrop to his wife Margaret might be offered as striking  illustrations of the confidence, sympathy, and love existing in colonial  home life. Thus, he writes from England: \"My Dear Wife: Commend my Love  to them all. I kisse & embrace thee, my deare wife, & all my children, &  leave thee in His armes who is able to preserve you all, & to fulfill  our joye in our happye meeting in His good time. Amen. Thy faithfull  husband.\" And again just before leaving England he writes to her: \"I  must begin now to prepare thee for our long parting which growes very  near. I know not how to deal with thee by arguments; for if thou wert as  wise and patient as ever woman was, yet it must needs be a great trial  to thee, and the greater because I am so dear to thee. That which I must  chiefly look at in thee for thy ground of contentment is thy godliness.\"    Nor were the wife's replies less warm and affectionate. Hear this bit  from a letter of three centuries ago: \"MY MOST SWEET HUSBAND:--How  dearely welcome thy kinde letter was to me I am not able to expresse.  The sweetnesse of it did much refresh me. What can be more pleasinge to  a wife, than to heare of the welfayre of her best beloved, and how he is  pleased with hir pore endevors.... I wish that I may be all-wayes  pleasinge to thee, and that those comforts we have in each other may be  dayly increced as far as they be pleasinge to God.... I will doe any  service whearein I may please my good Husband. I confess I cannot doe  ynough for thee....\"    Is it not evident that passionate, reverent love, amounting almost to  adoration, was fairly common in those early days? Numerous other  writings of the colonial period could add their testimony. Sometimes  the proof is in the letters of men longing for home and family;  sometimes in the messages of the wife longing for the return of her  \"goodman\"; sometimes it is discerned in bits of verse, such as those by  Ann Bradstreet, or in an enthusiastic description of a woman, such as  that by Jonathan Edwards about his future wife. Note the fervor of this  famous eulogy by the \"coldly logical\" Edwards; can it be excelled in  genuine warmth by the love letters of famous men in later days?    \"They say there is a young lady in New Haven who is beloved of that  Great Being, who made and rules the world, and that there are certain  seasons in which this Great Being, in some way or other invisible, comes  to her and fills her mind with exceeding sweet delight and that she  hardly cares for anything, except to meditate on him--that she expects  after a while to be received up where he is, to be raised up out of the  world and caught up into heaven; being assured that he loves her too  well to let her remain at a distance from him always.... Therefore, if  you present all the world before her, with the richest of its treasures,  she disregards it and cares not for it, and is unmindful of any pain or  affliction. She has a strange sweetness in her mind and singular purity  in her affections; is most just and conscientious in all her conduct;  and you could not persuade her to do anything wrong or sinful, if you  would give her all the world, lest she offend this Great Being. She is  of a wonderful sweetness, calmness and universal benevolence of mind....  She will sometimes go about from place to place, singing sweetly; and  seems to be always full of joy and pleasure.... She loves to be alone,  walking in the fields and groves, and seems to have some one invisible  always conversing with her.\"    In several poems Ann Bradstreet, daughter of Gov. Thomas Dudley, and  wife of Simon Bradstreet, mother of eight children, and first of the  women poets of America, expressed rather ardently for a Puritan dame,  her love for her husband. Thus:        \"I crave this boon, this errand by the way:      Commend me to the man more lov'd than life,      Show him the sorrows of his widow'd wife,               *       *       *       *       *        \"My sobs, my longing hopes, my doubting fears,      And, if he love, how can he there abide?\"    Again, we note the following:        \"If ever two were one, then surely we;      If ever man were loved by wife, then thee;      If ever wife was happy in a man,      Compare with me, ye women, if you can.\"[75]        \"I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,      Or all the riches that the East doth hold,      My love is such that rivers cannot quench,      Nor aught but love from thee give recompense.      My love is such I can no way repay;      The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray,      Then while we live in love let's persevere,      That when we live no more we may live ever.\"    The letters of Abigail Adams to her husband might be offered as further  evidence of the affectionate relationships existing between man and wife  in colonial days. Our text books on history so often leave the  impression that the fear of God utterly prevented the colonial home from  being a place of confident love; but it is possible that the social  restraints imposed by the church outside the home reacted in such a  manner as to compel men and women to express more fervently the  affections otherwise repressed. When we read such lines as the following  in Mrs. Adams' correspondence, we may conjecture that the years of  necessary separation from her husband during the Revolutionary days,  must have meant as much of longing and pain as a similar separation  would mean to a modern wife:  "]]]
