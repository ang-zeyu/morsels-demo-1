He had hoped to obtain the command of an army in the wars that broke out  from time to time; it was, indeed, universally admitted that he was in  every respect qualified for such a post. The courtiers and others,  however, jealous, as is ever the case, of ability and real talent,  debarred him by their intrigues from attaining his object. Pride  prevented him from acquiescing in this defeat; he strove by display and  extravagance to keep himself well to the front, flaunting himself before  the eyes of all. This course could not last long; he was obliged to  retire to his estate, which narrowly escaped forfeiture to his  creditors.    So ignominious an end after such worthy service was, however, prevented  by the personal interference of the old Prince, who, from his private  resources, paid off the most pressing creditors. To the last, the old  Prince received him as a friend, and listened to his counsel. Thyma was  ever in hopes that some change in the balance of parties would give him  his opportunity. When the young Prince succeeded, he was clever enough  to see that the presence of such men about his Court gave it a  stability, and he, too, invited Thyma to tender his advice. The Baron's  hopes now rose higher than ever, but again he was disappointed.    The new Prince, himself incapable, disliked and distrusted talent. The  years passed, and the Baron obtained no appointment. Still he strained  his resources to the utmost to visit the Court as often as possible;  still he believed that sooner or later a turn of the wheel would elevate  him.    There had existed between the houses of Thyma and Aquila the bond of  hearth-friendship; the gauntlets, hoofs, and rings were preserved by  both, and the usual presents passed thrice a year, at midsummer,  Christmas, and Lady-day. Not much personal intercourse had taken place,  however, for some years, until Felix was attracted by the beauty of the  Lady Aurora. Proud, showy, and pushing, Thyma could not understand the  feelings which led his hearth-friend to retire from the arena and busy  himself with cherries and water-wheels. On the other hand, Constans  rather looked with quiet derision on the ostentation of the other. Thus  there was a certain distance, as it were, between them.    Baron Thyma could not, of course, be ignorant of the attachment between  his daughter and Felix; yet as much as possible he ignored it. He never  referred to Felix; if his name was incidentally mentioned, he remained  silent. The truth was, he looked higher for Lady Aurora. He could not in  courtesy discourage even in the faintest manner the visits of his  friend's son; the knightly laws of honour would have forbidden so mean a  course. Nor would his conscience permit him to do so, remembering the  old days when he and the Baron were glad companions together, and how  the Baron Aquila was the first to lead troops to his assistance in the  gipsy war. Still, he tacitly disapproved; he did not encourage.    Felix felt that he was not altogether welcome; he recognised the sense  of restraint that prevailed when he was present. It deeply hurt his  pride, and nothing but his love for Aurora could have enabled him to  bear up against it. The galling part of it was that he could not in his  secret heart condemn the father for evidently desiring a better alliance  for his child. This was the strongest of the motives that had determined  him to seek the unknown.    If anything, the Baron would have preferred Oliver as a suitor for his  daughter; he sympathized with Oliver's fiery spirit, and admired his  feats of strength and dexterity with sword and spear. He had always  welcomed Oliver heartily, and paid him every attention. This, to do  Oliver justice, was one reason why he determined to accompany his  brother, thinking that if he was there he could occupy attention, and  thus enable Felix to have more opportunity to speak with Aurora.    The two rode forth from the courtyard early in the morning, and passing  through the whole length of the enclosure within the stockade, issued at  the South Barrier and almost immediately entered the forest. They rather  checked their horses' haste, fresh as the animals were from the stable,  but could not quite control their spirits, for the walk of a horse is  even half as fast again while he is full of vigour. The turn of the  track soon shut out the stockade; they were alone in the woods.    Long since, early as they were, the sun had dried the dew, for his beams  warm the atmosphere quickly as the spring advances towards summer. But  it was still fresh and sweet among the trees, and even Felix, though  bound on so gloomy an errand, could not choose but feel the joyous  influence of the morning. Oliver sang aloud in his rich deep voice, and  the thud, thud of the horses' hoofs kept time to the ballad.    The thrushes flew but a little way back from the path as they passed,  and began to sing again directly they were by. The whistling of  blackbirds came from afar where there were open glades or a running  stream; the notes of the cuckoo became fainter and fainter as they  advanced farther from the stockade, for the cuckoo likes the woodlands  that immediately border on cultivation. For some miles the track was  broad, passing through thickets of thorn and low hawthorn-trees with  immense masses of tangled underwood between, brambles and woodbine  twisted and matted together, impervious above but hollow beneath; under  these they could hear the bush-hens running to and fro and scratching at  the dead leaves which strewed the ground. Sounds of clucking deeper in  betrayed the situation of their nests.    Rushes, and the dead sedges of last year, up through which the green  fresh leaves were thrusting themselves, in some places stood beside the  way, fringing the thorns where the hollow ground often held the water  from rainstorms. Out from these bushes a rabbit occasionally started and  bounded across to the other side. Here, where there were so few trees,  and the forest chiefly consisted of bush, they could see some distance  on either hand, and also a wide breadth of the sky. After a time the  thorn bushes were succeeded by ash wood, where the trees stood closer to  the path, contracting the view; it was moister here, the hoofs cut into  the grass, which was coarse and rank. The trees growing so close  together destroyed themselves, their lower branches rubbed together and  were killed, so that in many spots the riders could see a long way  between the trunks.    Every time the wind blew they could hear a distant cracking of branches  as the dead boughs, broken by the swaying of the trees, fell off and  came down. Had any one attempted to walk into the forest there they  would have sunk above the ankle in soft decaying wood, hidden from sight  by thick vegetation. Wood-pigeons rose every minute from these ash-trees  with a loud clatter of wings; their calls resounded continually, now  deep in the forest, and now close at hand. It was evident that a large  flock of them had their nesting-place here, and indeed their nests of  twigs could be frequently seen from the path. There seemed no other  birds.    Again the forest changed, and the track, passing on higher ground,  entered among firs. These, too, had killed each other by growing so  thickly; the lower branches of many were dead, and there was nothing but  a little green at the tops, while in many places there was an open space  where they had decayed away altogether. Brambles covered the ground in  these open places, brambles and furze now bright with golden blossom.  The jays screeched loudly, startled as the riders passed under them, and  fluttered away; rabbits, which they saw again here, dived into their  burrows. Between the first the track was very narrow, and they could not  conveniently ride side by side; Oliver took the lead, and Felix  followed.          CHAPTER VII    THE FOREST TRACK CONTINUED      Once as they trotted by a pheasant rose screaming from the furze and  flew before them down the track. Just afterwards Felix, who had been  previously looking very carefully into the firs upon his right hand,  suddenly stopped, and Oliver, finding this, pulled up as quickly as he  could, thinking that Felix wished to tighten his girth.    \"What is it?\" he asked, turning round in his saddle.    \"Hush!\" said Felix, dismounting; his horse, trained to hunting, stood  perfectly still, and would have remained within a few yards of the spot  by the hour together. Oliver reined back, seeing Felix about to bend and  string his bow.    \"Bushmen,\" whispered Felix, as he, having fitted the loop to the horn  notch, drew forth an arrow from his girdle, where he carried two or  three more ready to hand than in the quiver on his shoulder. \"I thought  I saw signs of them some time since, and now I am nearly sure. Stay here  a moment.\"    He stepped aside from the track in among the firs, which just there were  far apart, and went to a willow bush standing by some furze. He had  noticed that one small branch on the outer part of the bush was snapped  off, though green, and only hung by the bark. The wood cattle, had they  browsed upon it, would have nibbled the tenderest leaves at the end of  the bough; nor did they usually touch willow, for the shoots are bitter  and astringent. Nor would the deer touch it in the spring, when they had  so wide a choice of food.    Nothing could have broken the branch in that manner unless it was the  hand of a man, or a blow with a heavy stick wielded by a human hand. On  coming to the bush he saw that the fracture was very recent, for the  bough was perfectly green; it had not turned brown, and the bark was  still soft with sap. It had not been cut with a knife or any sharp  instrument; it had been broken by rude violence, and not divided.

The deep and extensive depositions which I now attempt to describe  attracted the early attention of the mining adventurers, and were called  \"hill diggings,\" but not being properly understood were therefore not  immediately operated upon, and remained in abeyance, while the lower,  richer, and more manifest alluvials endured. They were designated \"blue  gravel,\" the color being due to the action of sulphuret of iron and other  salts, the cementing auxiliaries requisite to form the hard conglomerate,  and on exposure to the atmosphere changes color to yellow and violet,  losing also its firmness by oxidation.    The \"great blue lead\" is another important mining term and designates the  alluvium found reposing in a well-defined channel on the bed rock, being  the well-worn path of an ancient river; and it is obvious that the  material in these channels should be richer than the general mass beyond  their limits.    \"Rim rock\" is the boundary line of the banks of the old channel, and, like  the bottom, is well worn and corrugated by the running water into cavities  and \"pot holes,\" where the force of the stream eddied. The width of these  channels varies from 60 to 400 feet, and the cement near the rim and  bottom is always richer than elsewhere. The wider and deeper channels  generally course from N. to N.W. The richest and most explored belt of  gold-bearing alluvium in California lies between the South and Middle Yuba  Rivers, commencing near Eureka, in Nevada county, and extends downwards to  Smartsville and Timbuctoo, in Yuba county, a distance of 40 miles; and  from among snowy mountains the country falls gradually from where the  ravines or canons are cut by the actual rivers, which are 2,000 feet  beneath the auriferous gravel and region near Smartsville, and 2,000 feet  above the Yuba River, where snow is unknown, and near its terminus the  ancient river bed courses more westerly than it does above it, and crosses  Yuba below Timbuctoo, where the auriferous depositions disappear. The  whole distance of 40 miles has been ransacked by the earlier adventurers,  and around the village of Timbuctoo was a center famed for its wonderful  yield of gold, obtained chiefly in the ravines, in holes, and depressions  in the bed rock. These hollows detained the concentrations of the  denudated alluvium from the altitudes, and were generally closely beneath  the surface, and by such guidance and means of discovery the miners traced  the gold up the ravines to their sources in the lofty mounds and deposits,  or hills of cemented conglomerate, near Eureka in Nevada county; and by  constructing canals from a higher level began the new system of \"hydraulic  mining\" and washing, and gradually extended their operations over the area  of the metallic zone mentioned, of 40 miles long by 20 wide, using the  Yuba River below Timbuctoo to receive and discharge the tailings, or  refuse from their operations. The result in gold was considerable, but the  system is from its violent nature difficult to control, by presuming to  handle and remove such huge depositions in order to collect the richest  material. The idea was bold, being an anticipation of Nature's operations;  but the equitable disposal of the \"tailings\" in a cultivated country is  impossible, as the silt runs down the rivers, creating banks and bars in  their channels, obstructing navigation and agricultural arrangements.    _General Description of Hydraulic Mining._    The first work to be accomplished, after calculating that the amount or  value of the material to be operated upon is sufficient to guarantee the  cost of the undertaking in general, is the construction of a canal or  canals, to convey the requisite volume of water from the fountain-head,  and of sufficient elevation to command the ground to be worked upon,  having also in view the levels of the necessary tunnels and shafts as  outlets for the discharge of the gravel through them, these being  engineering operations requiring much skill and labor to avoid useless  after-cost.    Aqueducts of considerable elevation have to be constructed across deep  valleys, and the speculation is at all times problematical, as the ground  cannot be properly tested until the water arrives upon it, and disputes  may arise between the shareholders of the canal and the mining company,  ending frequently in the one devouring the other, unless the two interests  be quickly amalgamated.    The starting point should be the lowest level, or \"bed rock,\" on the white  cement in the ancient channel, which is probably the original silt  collected in it, and is harder than the conglomerate above it, which is  more easily removed. The courses of these beds can be easily traced by  landmarks and undulations, and occasional exposures of the bed rock at low  levels; also trial shafts are sunk in various places in search of it, to a  depth of 100 feet, passing through blue gravel. The grades of these beds  are not steep, being from 10 to 40 feet per mile as of an ordinary river,  and the calculated thickness of the alluvial conglomerate is about 600  feet in many places across the ridge between the South and Middle Yuba  River across the Columbia.    The power of the water for the operation is dependent on a given volume  deposited in a reservoir, and at sufficient elevation above the points of  discharge, as on this depends effectivity to tear down the gravel. It is  delivered to the miner by huge pipes made of wrought iron, and laid down  to follow the curvatures of the surface of the ground; and the pipe I now  treat of, belonging to the Excelsior Water Company, has a diameter of 40  inches on a length of 6,000 feet, and 20 inches on the rest of its length  of 8,000 feet, being 9,000 feet in all; and this large pipe forms an  inverted siphon across a valley, following on the gravel, to the top of  the hill into the reservoir.    These pipes offer advantages over wooden aqueducts for spanning chasms,  and also to avoid coursing the sides of valleys; being also cheaper to  construct in general, and less liable to accidents from fire and storms,  and have the convenience for conveying the water from point to point, as  the work of excavation advances, necessitating the removal of portions of  the aqueduct forward. The watershed, or reservoir, of the Excelsior  Company embraces the valley of the South Yuba and its affluents, and the  entire cost of its eight amalgamated canals was 750,000 dollars.    The rainfall during three years in the mountains averaged 49 inches  annually, while the medium in the same period did not exceed 20 inches in  the plains beneath. The height of the reservoir above the tailing, or Yuba  River, is 393 feet: and the height of the head above the floor, or outlet  sluice-tunnel, of the Blue Gravel Mining Company was 197 feet.    The exact quantity of water required to wash every class of gravel is  difficult to estimate, but no quantity or pressure would be excessive if  properly arranged. The measurement of water is effected by miner's  inches, by allowing it to flow from the reservoir of the seller to the  purchaser through a box 10 or 12 feet square, with divisions to obtain a  quiet head, with a slide or opening capable of adjustment to any required  measure; thus an opening of 25 inches by 2 inches, with a quiet head of 6  inches above the middle of the orifice, would give 50 inches, or about  89,259 cubic feet of water, flowing during ten hours per day, being an  amount necessary for a first-class operation. The capability of the  Excelsior Canal in rainy seasons reached to a delivery in twenty-four  hours, to the various mining companies, of 21,120,000 cubic feet of water,  or 8,000 miner's inches, and the value of the water paid for by the Blue  Gravel Company in forty-three months ending November 9, 1867, was 157,261  dollars, being at the rate of 15 cents of a dollar per miner's inch; and  the proportion of water used to wash down 989,165 cubic yards of gravel  was 17,074,758 cubic yards, or 171/4 cubic yards of water to 1 cubic yard of  gravel; and when at work the quantity of gravel daily moved was 1,298  cubic yards, and the estimated cost to move one cubic yard of gravel was 5  and 7/10 cents of a dollar. But in the face of contingencies the Blue  Gravel Company moved 1,000,000 cubic yards of gravel in four years, or at  the rate of 250,000 cubic yards per annum, and the cost of washing each  cubic yard stands thus:                                                     Cents.    Cost of water, at 15 cents per miner's inch     5.77    Cost of labor, gunpowder, sluices, and        superintendence                            16.10                                                   -----                                                   21.87      Or 213/4 cents of a dollar per cubic yard.    Thus the gravel should contain gold to the value of 22 cents of a dollar  per cubic yard to cover cost, and the value of the gravel referred to  ranged from 20 to 45 cents per cubic yard; and the cost of work done in  shafts and tunnels, in the said Blue Gravel Company's Mining claim,  reached 100,000 dollars. But with the cost of the necessary canals paid  for by the Excelsior Water Company apart, the total cost amounted to about  1,000,000 dollars, and we must note that the latter company sold water to  other mining companies.    The gross yield in gold of the Blue Gravel Company in four years was  837,399 dollars, and in the year 1866 the returns from the Blue Gravel  Company paid all the costs of the developments; but in 1867 assessments  were paid by the owners to meet the deficiency arising from the cost of  sinking two new shafts, and driving fresh tunnels on the lowest levels,  which evidently contain on the bed rock the richest concentrations.    In smaller mining adventures of this description, involving less capital,  large profits have been made in "]]]
