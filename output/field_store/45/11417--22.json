[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/148"],[0,"The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (#18)"],[1," myself in Pennsylvania, there was not a good  bookseller's shop in any of the colonies to the southward of Boston.  In New York and Philad'a the printers were indeed stationers; they sold  only paper, etc., almanacs, ballads, and a few common school-books.  Those who lov'd reading were oblig'd to send for their books from  England; the members of the Junto had each a few.  We had left the  alehouse, where we first met, and hired a room to hold our club in.  I  propos'd that we should all of us bring our books to that room, where  they would not only be ready to consult in our conferences, but become  a common benefit, each of us being at liberty to borrow such as he  wish'd to read at home.  This was accordingly done, and for some time  contented us.    Finding the advantage of this little collection, I propos'd to render  the benefit from books more common, by commencing a public subscription  library.  I drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would be  necessary, and got a skilful conveyancer, Mr. Charles Brockden, to put  the whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed, by which  each subscriber engag'd to pay a certain sum down for the first  purchase of books, and an annual contribution for increasing them.  So  few were the readers at that time in Philadelphia, and the majority of  us so poor, that I was not able, with great industry, to find more than  fifty persons, mostly young tradesmen, willing to pay down for this  purpose forty shillings each, and ten shillings per annum.  On this  little fund we began.  The books were imported; the library was opened  one day in the week for lending to the subscribers, on their promissory  notes to pay double the value if not duly returned.  The institution  soon manifested its utility, was imitated by other towns, and in other  provinces.  The libraries were augmented by donations; reading became  fashionable; and our people, having no publick amusements to divert  their attention from study, became better acquainted with books, and in  a few years were observ'd by strangers to be better instructed and more  intelligent than people of the same rank generally are in other  countries.    When we were about to sign the above-mentioned articles, which were to  be binding upon us, our heirs, etc., for fifty years, Mr. Brockden, the  scrivener, said to us, \"You are young men, but it is scarcely probable  that any of you will live to see the expiration of the term fix'd in  the instrument.\"  A number of us, however, are yet living; but the  instrument was after a few years rendered null by a charter that  incorporated and gave perpetuity to the company.    The objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting the  subscriptions, made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting one's  self as the proposer of any useful project, that might be suppos'd to  raise one's reputation in the smallest degree above that of one's  neighbors, when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that  project.  I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight, and  stated it as a scheme of a number of friends, who had requested me to  go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading.  In  this way my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever after practis'd it  on such occasions; and, from my frequent successes, can heartily  recommend it.  The present little sacrifice of your vanity will  afterwards be amply repaid.  If it remains a while uncertain to whom  the merit belongs, some one more vain than yourself will be encouraged  to claim it, and then even envy will be disposed to do you justice by  plucking those assumed feathers, and restoring them to their right  owner.    This library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study,  for which I set apart an hour or two each day, and thus repair'd in  some degree the loss of the learned education my father once intended  for me.  Reading was the only amusement I allow'd myself.  I spent no  time in taverns, games, or frolicks of any kind; and my industry in my  business continu'd as indefatigable as it was necessary.  I was  indebted for my printing-house; I had a young family coming on to be  educated, and I had to contend with for business two printers, who were  established in the place before me.  My circumstances, however, grew  daily easier.  My original habits of frugality continuing, and my  father having, among his instructions to me when a boy, frequently  repeated a proverb of Solomon, \"Seest thou a man diligent in his  calling, he shall stand before kings, he shall not stand before mean  men,\" I from thence considered industry as a means of obtaining wealth  and distinction, which encourag'd me, tho' I did not think that I  should ever literally stand before kings, which, however, has since  happened; for I have stood before five, and even had the honor of  sitting down with one, the King of Denmark, to dinner.    We have an English proverb that says, \"He that would thrive, must ask  his wife.\"  It was lucky for me that I had one as much dispos'd to  industry and frugality as myself.  She assisted me cheerfully in my  business, folding and stitching pamphlets, tending shop, purchasing old  linen rags for the papermakers, etc., etc.  We kept no idle servants,  our table was plain and simple, our furniture of the cheapest.  For  instance, my breakfast was a long time bread and milk (no tea), and I  ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer, with a pewter spoon.  But  mark how luxury will enter families, and make a progress, in spite of  principle:  being call'd one morning to breakfast, I found it in a  China bowl, with a spoon of silver!  They had been bought for me  without my knowledge by my wife, and had cost her the enormous sum of  three-and-twenty shillings, for which she had no other excuse or  apology to make, but that she thought her husband deserv'd a silver  spoon and China bowl as well as any of his neighbors.  This was the  first appearance of plate and China in our house, which afterward, in a  course of years, as our wealth increas'd, augmented gradually to  several hundred pounds in value.    I had been religiously educated as a Presbyterian; and tho' some of the  dogmas of that persuasion, such as the eternal decrees of God,  election, reprobation, etc., appeared to me unintelligible, others  doubtful, and I early absented myself from the public assemblies of the  sect, Sunday being my studying day, I never was without some religious  principles.  I never doubted, for instance, the existence of the Deity;  that he made the world, and govern'd it by his Providence; that the  most acceptable service of God was the doing good to man; that our  souls are immortal; and that all crime will be punished, and virtue  rewarded, either here or hereafter.  These I esteem'd the essentials of  every religion; and, being to be found in all the religions we had in  our country, I respected them all, tho' with different degrees of  respect, as I found them more or less mix'd with other articles, which,  without any tendency to inspire, promote, or confirm morality, serv'd  principally to divide us, and make us unfriendly to one another.  This  respect to all, with an opinion that the worst had some good effects,  induc'd me to avoid all discourse that might tend to lessen the good  opinion another might have of his own religion; and as our province  increas'd in people, and new places of worship were continually wanted,  and generally erected by voluntary contributions, my mite for such  purpose, whatever might be the sect, was never refused.    Tho' I seldom attended any public worship, I had still an opinion of  its propriety, and of its utility when rightly conducted, and I  regularly paid my annual subscription for the support of the only  Presbyterian minister or meeting we had in Philadelphia.  He us'd to  visit me sometimes as a friend, and admonish me to attend his  administrations, and I was now and then prevail'd on to do so, once for  five Sundays successively.  Had he been in my opinion a good preacher,  perhaps I might have continued, notwithstanding the occasion I had for  the Sunday's leisure in my course of study; but his discourses were  chiefly either polemic arguments, or explications of the peculiar  doctrines of our sect, and were all to me very dry, uninteresting, and  unedifying, since not a single moral principle was inculcated or  enforc'd, their aim seeming to be rather to make us Presbyterians than  good citizens.    At length he took for his text that verse of the fourth chapter of  Philippians, \"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, honest,  just, pure, lovely, or of good report, if there be any virtue, or any  praise, think on these things.\"  And I imagin'd, in a sermon on such a  text, we could not miss of having some morality.  But he confin'd  himself to five points only, as meant by the apostle, viz.: 1.  Keeping  holy the Sabbath day.  2.  Being diligent in reading the holy  Scriptures.  3.  Attending duly the publick worship.  4.  Partaking of  the Sacrament.  5.  Paying a due respect to God's ministers.  These  might be all good things; but, as they were not the kind of good things  that I expected from that text, I despaired of ever meeting with them  from any other, was disgusted, and attended his preaching no more.  I  had some years before compos'd a little Liturgy, or form of prayer, for  my own private use (viz., in 1728), entitled, Articles of Belief and  Acts of Religion.  I return'd to the use of this, and went no more to  the public assemblies.  My conduct might be blameable, but I leave it,  without attempting further to excuse it; my present purpose being to  relate facts, and not to make apologies for them.    It was about this time I conceiv'd the bold and arduous project of  arriving at moral perfection.  I wish'd to live without committing any  fault at any time; I would conquer all that either natural"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1480"],[0,"Tom Brown's School Days (#18)"],[1,"School goal-posts, quarters  scattering before them. One after another the bull-dogs go down, but  young Brooke holds on. \"He is down.\" No! a long stagger, but the danger  is past. That was the shock of Crew, the most dangerous of dodgers. And  now he is close to the School goal, the ball not three yards before  him. There is a hurried rush of the School fags to the spot, but no  one throws himself on the ball, the only chance, and young Brooke has  touched it right under the School goal-posts.    The School leaders come up furious, and administer toco to the wretched  fags nearest at hand. They may well be angry, for it is all Lombard  Street to a china orange that the School-house kick a goal with the ball  touched in such a good place. Old Brooke, of course, will kick it  out, but who shall catch and place it? Call Crab Jones. Here he comes,  sauntering along with a straw in his mouth, the queerest, coolest fish  in Rugby. If he were tumbled into the moon this minute, he would just  pick himself up without taking his hands out of his pockets or turning  a hair. But it is a moment when the boldest charger's heart beats quick.  Old Brooke stands with the ball under his arm motioning the School back;  he will not kick out till they are all in goal, behind the posts. They  are all edging forwards, inch by inch, to get nearer for the rush at  Crab Jones, who stands there in front of old Brooke to catch the ball.  If they can reach and destroy him before he catches, the danger is over;  and with one and the same rush they will carry it right away to the  School-house goal. Fond hope! it is kicked out and caught beautifully.  Crab strikes his heel into the ground, to mark the spot where the ball  was caught, beyond which the school line may not advance; but there they  stand, five deep, ready to rush the moment the ball touches the ground.  Take plenty of room. Don't give the rush a chance of reaching you. Place  it true and steady. Trust Crab Jones. He has made a small hole with his  heel for the ball to lie on, by which he is resting on one knee, with  his eye on old Brooke. \"Now!\" Crab places the ball at the word, old  Brooke kicks, and it rises slowly and truly as the School rush forward.    Then a moment's pause, while both sides look up at the spinning ball.  There it flies, straight between the two posts, some five feet above the  cross-bar, an unquestioned goal; and a shout of real, genuine joy rings  out from the School-house players-up, and a faint echo of it comes over  the close from the goal-keepers under the Doctor's wall. A goal in the  first hour--such a thing hasn't been done in the School-house match  these five years.    \"Over!\" is the cry. The two sides change goals, and the School-house  goal-keepers come threading their way across through the masses of  the School, the most openly triumphant of them--amongst whom is Tom, a  School-house boy of two hours' standing--getting their ears boxed in  the transit. Tom indeed is excited beyond measure, and it is all the  sixth-form boy, kindest and safest of goal-keepers, has been able to do,  to keep him from rushing out whenever the ball has been near their  goal. So he holds him by his side, and instructs him in the science of  touching.    At this moment Griffith, the itinerant vender of oranges from Hill  Morton, enters the close with his heavy baskets. There is a rush of  small boys upon the little pale-faced man, the two sides mingling  together, subdued by the great goddess Thirst, like the English and  French by the streams in the Pyrenees. The leaders are past oranges and  apples, but some of them visit their coats, and apply innocent-looking  ginger-beer bottles to their mouths. It is no ginger-beer though, I  fear, and will do you no good. One short mad rush, and then a stitch in  the side, and no more honest play. That's what comes of those bottles.    But now Griffith's baskets are empty, the ball is placed again midway,  and the School are going to kick off. Their leaders have sent their  lumber into goal, and rated the rest soundly, and one hundred and twenty  picked players-up are there, bent on retrieving the game. They are to  keep the ball in front of the School-house goal, and then to drive it in  by sheer strength and weight. They mean heavy play and no mistake, and  so old Brooke sees, and places Crab Jones in quarters just before the  goal, with four or five picked players who are to keep the ball away to  the sides, where a try at goal, if obtained, will be less dangerous than  in front. He himself, and Warner and Hedge, who have saved themselves  till now, will lead the charges.    \"Are you ready?\" \"Yes.\" And away comes the ball, kicked high in the air,  to give the School time to rush on and catch it as it falls. And here  they are amongst us. Meet them like Englishmen, you Schoolhouse boys,  and charge them home. Now is the time to show what mettle is in you;  and there shall be a warm seat by the hall fire, and honour, and lots of  bottled beer to-night for him who does his duty in the next half-hour.  And they are well met. Again and again the cloud of their players-up  gathers before our goal, and comes threatening on, and Warner or Hedge,  with young Brooke and the relics of the bull-dogs, break through  and carry the ball back; and old Brooke ranges the field like Job's  war-horse. The thickest scrummage parts asunder before his rush, like  the waves before a clipper's bows; his cheery voice rings out over the  field, and his eye is everywhere. And if these miss the ball, and it  rolls dangerously in front of our goal, Crab Jones and his men  have seized it and sent it away towards the sides with the unerring  drop-kick. This is worth living for--the whole sum of school-boy  existence gathered up into one straining, struggling half-hour, a  half-hour worth a year of common life.    The quarter to five has struck, and the play slackens for a minute  before goal; but there is Crew, the artful dodger, driving the ball in  behind our goal, on the island side, where our quarters are weakest. Is  there no one to meet him? Yes; look at little East! The ball is just at  equal distances between the two, and they rush together, the young man  of seventeen and the boy of twelve, and kick it at the same moment. Crew  passes on without a stagger; East is hurled forward by the shock, and  plunges on his shoulder, as if he would bury himself in the ground;  but the ball rises straight into the air, and falls behind Crew's back,  while the \"bravoes\" of the School-house attest the pluckiest charge of  all that hard-fought day. Warner picks East up lame and half stunned,  and he hobbles back into goal, conscious of having played the man.    And now the last minutes are come, and the School gather for their last  rush, every boy of the hundred and twenty who has a run left in him.  Reckless of the defence of their own goal, on they come across the level  big-side ground, the ball well down amongst them, straight for our goal,  like the column of the Old Guard up the slope at Waterloo. All former  charges have been child's play to this. Warner and Hedge have met them,  but still on they come. The bull-dogs rush in for the last time; they  are hurled over or carried back, striving hand, foot, and eyelids. Old  Brooke comes sweeping round the skirts of the play, and turning short  round, picks out the very heart of the scrummage, and plunges in. It  wavers for a moment; he has the ball. No, it has passed him, and his  voice rings out clear over the advancing tide, \"Look out in goal!\" Crab  Jones catches it for a moment; but before he can kick, the rush is upon  him and passes over him; and he picks himself up behind them with his  straw in his mouth, a little dirtier, but as cool as ever.    The ball rolls slowly in behind the School-house goal, not three yards  in front of a dozen of the biggest School players-up.    There stands the School-house praepostor, safest of goal-keepers, and Tom  Brown by his side, who has learned his trade by this time. Now is  your time, Tom. The blood of all the Browns is up, and the two rush in  together, and throw themselves on the ball, under the very feet of the  advancing column--the praepostor on his hands and knees, arching his  back, and Tom all along on his face. Over them topple the leaders of the  rush, shooting over the back of the praepostor, but falling flat on Tom,  and knocking all the wind out of his small carcass. \"Our ball,\" says the  praepostor, rising with his prize; \"but get up there; there's a little  fellow under you.\" They are hauled and roll off him, and Tom is  discovered, a motionless body.    Old Brooke picks him up. \"Stand back, give him air,\" he says; and then  feeling his limbs, adds, \"No bones broken.--How do you feel, young un?\"    \"Hah-hah!\" gasps Tom, as his wind comes back; \"pretty well, thank  you--all right.\"    \"Who is he?\" says Brooke.    \"Oh, it's Brown; he's a new boy; I know him,\" says East, coming up.    \"Well, he is a plucky youngster, and will make a player,\" says Brooke.    And five o'clock strikes. \"No side\" is called, and the first day of the  School-house match is over.        CHAPTER VI--AFTER THE MATCH.         \"Some food we had.\"--Shakespeare.       [Greek text]--Theocr. Id.    As the boys scattered away from the ground, and East, leaning on Tom's  arm, and limping along, was beginning to consider what luxury they  should go and buy for tea to celebrate that glorious victory, the two  Brookes came striding by. Old Brooke caught sight of East, and stopped;  put his hand kindly on his shoulder, and said, \"Bravo, youngster; you  played famously. Not much the matter, I hope?\"    \"No, nothing at all,\" said East--\"only a little twist from that  charge.\"    \"Well, mind and get all right for next Saturday.\" And the leader passed  on, leaving East better for those few words than all the opodeldoc in  England would have made him, and Tom ready to give one of his"]]]
