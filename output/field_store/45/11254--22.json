The noble Marquess the other day, in a very courteous manner,  administered to me an exhortation and an admonition--I had almost said  a lecture--as to the propriety of deferring to the man on the spot,  and the danger of quarrelling with the man on the spot. I listened  with becoming meekness and humility, but then it occurred to me that  the language of the noble Marquess was not original. Those noble Lords  who share the Bench with him, gave deep murmurs of approval to the  homily that was administered to me. They forgot that they once had a  man on the spot, the man then being that eminent and distinguished  personage whom I may be allowed to congratulate upon his restoration  to health and to his place in this Assembly. He said this, which  the noble Marquess will see is a fair original for his own little  discourse; it was said after the noble Lord had thrown up the reins--        \"What I wish to say to high officers of State and members of      Government is this, as far as you can trust the man on the spot.      Do not weary or fret or nag him with your superior wisdom. They      claim no immunity from errors of opinion or judgment, but their      errors are nothing compared with yours.\"    The remonstrance, therefore, of Lord Curzon, addressed to the noble  Lords sitting near him, is identical with the warning which I have  laid to heart from the noble Marquess.    The House will pardon me if for a moment I dwell upon what by  application is an innuendo conveyed in the admonition of the noble  Marquess. I have a suspicion that he considered his advice was needed;  he expressed the hope that all who were responsible for administration  in India would have all the power for which they had a right to ask.  Upon that I can--though I am half reluctant to do it--completely  clear my character. In December last, shortly before I addressed your  Lordships, Lord Minto, having observed there was some talk of my  interference with him and his Council, telegraphed these words, and  desired that I should make use of them whenever I thought fit--        \"I hope you will say from me in as strong language as you may      choose to use, that in all our dealings with sedition I could not      be more strongly supported than I have been by you. The question      of the control of Indian administration by the Secretary of State,      mixed up as it is with the old difficulties of centralisation, we      may very possibly look at from different points of view. But that      has nothing to do with the support the Secretary of State gives      to the Viceroy, and which you have given to me in a time of great      difficulty, and for which I shall always be warmly grateful.\"    The MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE: I think the noble Viscount will see from  the report of my speech, that the part he has quoted had reference to  measures of repression, and that what I said was that justice should  be prompt, that it was undesirable that there should be appeals from  one Court to another, or from provincial Governments to the Government  in Calcutta, or from the Government at Calcutta to the Secretary of  State for India. I did not mean to imply merely the Viceroy, but the  men responsible for local government.    VISCOUNT MORLEY: I do not think that when the noble Marquess refers to  the report of his speech he will find I have misrepresented him. At  all events, he will, I do believe, gladly agree that, in dealing with  sedition, I have on the whole given all the support the Government of  India or anybody else concerned had a right to ask for.    I will now say a word about the Indian Civil Service. Three years  ago, when we began these operations, I felt that a vital condition of  success was that we should carry the Indian Civil Service with us, and  that if we did not do this, we should fail. But human nature being  what it is, and temperaments varying as they do, it is natural  to expect a certain amount of criticism, minute criticism, and  observation, I have had that, but will content myself with one  quotation from the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, well known to the  noble Lord opposite. What did he say, addressing the Legislative  Council a few weeks ago?--        \"I hold that a solemn duty rests upon the officers of Government      in all branches, and more particularly upon the officers of the      Civil Service, so to comport themselves in the inception and      working of the new measures as to make the task of the people and      their leaders easy. It is incumbent upon them loyally to accept      the principle that these measures involve the surrender of some      portion of the authority and control which they now exercise, and      some modifications of the methods of administration. If that task      is approached in a grudging or reluctant spirit, we shall be      sowing the seeds of failure, and shall forfeit our claim to      receive the friendly co-operation of the representatives of the      people. We must be prepared to support, defend, and carry through      the administrative policy, and in a certain degree even the      executive acts of the Government in the Council, in much the same      way as is now prescribed in regard to measures of legislation; and      we must further be prepared to discharge this task without the aid      of a standing majority behind us. We will have to resort to the      more difficult arts of persuasion and conciliation, in the place      of the easier methods of autocracy. This is no small demand to      make on the resources of a service whose training and traditions      have hitherto led its members rather to work for the people, than      through the people or their representatives. But I am nevertheless      confident that the demand will not be made in vain. For more than      a hundred years, in the time of the Company and under the rule of      the Crown, the Indian Civil Service has never failed to respond      to whatever call has been made upon it or to adapt itself to the      changing environment of the time. I feel no doubt that officers      will be found who possess the natural gifts, the loyalty, the      imagination, and the force of character which will be requisite      for the conduct of the administration under the more advanced form      of government to which we are about to succeed.\"    These words I commend to your Lordships. They breathe a fine and high  spirit; they admirably express the feeling of a sincere man; and I do  not believe anybody who is acquainted with the Service doubts that  this spirit, so admirably expressed, will pervade the Service in the  admittedly difficult task that now confronts them.    The Bill is a short one, and will speak for itself. I shall be brief  in referring to it, for in December last I made what was practically  a Second-Reading speech. I may point out that there are two rival  schools, and that the noble Lord opposite (Lord Curzon) may be said  to represent one of them. There are two rival schools, one of which  believes that better government of India depends on efficiency, and  that efficiency is in fact the main end of our rule in India. The  other school, while not neglecting efficiency, looks also to what is  called political concession. I think I am doing the noble Lord no  injustice in saying that, during his remarkable Vice-royalty, he did  not accept the necessity for political concession, but trusted to  efficiency. I hope it will not be bad taste to say in the noble Lord's  presence, that you will never send to India, and you have never sent  to India, a Viceroy his superior, if, indeed, his equal, in force of  mind, in unsparing and remorseless industry, in passionate and devoted  interest in all that concerns the well-being of India, with an  imagination fired by the grandeur of the political problem that India  presents--you never sent a man with more of all these attributes than  when you sent Lord Curzon. But splendidly designed as was his work  from the point of view of efficiency, he still left in India a state  of things, when we look back upon it, that could not be held a  satisfactory crowning of a brilliant and ambitious career.    I am as much for efficiency as the noble Lord, but I do not  believe--and this is the difference between him and myself--that you  can now have true, solid, endurable efficiency without what are called  political concessions. I know the risks. The late Lord Salisbury,  speaking on the last Indian Councils Bill, spoke of the risk of  applying occidental machinery in India. Well, we ought to have thought  of that before we applied occidental education; we applied that, and a  measure of occidental machinery must follow. Legislative Councils once  called into existence, then it was inevitable that you would have  gradually, in Lord Salisbury's own phrase, to popularise them, so as  to bring them into harmony with the dominant sentiments of the  people in India. The Bill of 1892 admittedly contained the elective  principle, and our Bill to-day extends that principle. The noble Lord  (Viscount Cross) will remember the Bill of 1892, of which he had  charge in the House of Commons. I want the House to be good enough to  follow the line taken by Mr. Gladstone, because I base myself on that.  There was an amendment moved"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10985"],[0,"The Infant System (#18)"],[1,"a deaf ear to the charmer, charm he ever so wisely.\" I am  satisfied, from the experience I have had, that an amount of good  is attainable from early and judicious culture, which far, very far  surpasses all that has heretofore been accomplished; and on which not  a few are even unprepared to calculate.    It was a Christian-like wish expressed by King George III., that every  child in his dominions should be able to read the bible; and from the  increased facility of doing so from gratuitous education, the number  of those who cannot is much less than formerly; but in many cases the  necessitous circumstances of the parents prevent them from allowing  their children, except during their infant years, the advantage of  instruction, even though it cost them nothing. The time for the  children of the poor to receive instruction, is between the ages  of two and eight; after that period many are sent out to work, or  detained at home, for they then become useful to their parents, and  cannot be sent to school. There are many little girls who, having  left the infant school, go out to work for a shilling a week, and the  mothers have declared to me, when I have endeavoured to persuade them  to send them to the National School, for at least one year, that they  could not do it, for they were so poor, that every shilling was a  great help; they have, however, promised me that they would send them  to the Sunday school. This may account, in some measure, for there  being so many more boys than girls in almost every school in London,  and chews that great good has been done, and is doing, by those  valuable institutions.[A]    [Footnote A: It is to be observed here, that the children do not come  to or schools on Sundays, but many of them, between five and six years  old, who have brothers and sisters in the national school, go with  them to church, and others of the same age go to a Sunday school in  the neighbourhood. In short, I may venture to say, that almost all the  children that are able, go either to a Sunday school or to church: but  to take them all in a body, at the early age that they are admitted  into an infant school, to any place of worship, and to keep them there  for two or three hours, with a hope to profit them, and not to  disturb the congregation, is, according to my view, injurious if not  impracticable.]    Many of my readers, who have been in the habit of noticing and pitying  the poor, may think the detail into which I have entered superfluous,  but I can assure them the want of information on the subject is but  too general, and is sufficient to account for the indifference which  has so long been exhibited.    The objection, that education is altogether improper for poor people  is not quite obsolete. There are not wanting persons who still  entertain the most dreadful apprehensions of the _\"march of  intellect,\"_ as it has been termed; who see no alternative but that it  must over-turn every thing that is established, and subvert the whole  order of society. I would willingly impart comfort to the minds of  those who are afflicted with such nervous tremours, but I fear, if the  demonstration of experience has not quieted them, the voice of reason  never will. It cannot fail to remind us of the apprehensions of the  popish clergy in former times, who decried the art of printing,  then recently introduced, as a branch of the black art, which, if  encouraged, must eventually demolish the social fabric, and introduce  civil wars and discord into every country. Time, that test of truth,  has shewn us how groundless their apprehensions were. Instead of  injuring that fabric, it has strengthened its foundation so that it  cannot be shaken, and has surrounded it with defences, which bid  defiance to assaults.    Oh! that the time were come when every heart, being imbued with truly  christian principles, would see that the noblest and highest object  that could be set before us, would be to rear up the minds of the  young in knowledge, virtue, and piety; to train them to intelligence  and usefulness in this life, and for happiness and immortality in the  life to come. On such labours the blessing of God would inevitably  rest, and His promise of their success is positive and unconditional.  \"Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will  not depart from it.\"    To the furtherance of the infant system I have devoted for many years  my utmost energies and resources, and to it I purpose to give them, so  long as I am permitted by the gracious Providence of God. I shall be  happy to render it any aid, either by supplying information to those  who need it, or by personal exertions, the expenses of so doing  being defrayed; on application to my Publisher, 22, Portugal Street,  Lincoln's Inn, London, or to myself', at Moor Cottage, Wakefield.    In order to urge the necessity, and explain the design of infant  schools, I have for some years been accustomed to deliver a course of  lectures, of which the following is an outline:--    FIRST LECTURE.--Affecting state of the children of the  poor--Lamentable condition of young delinquents--What are the  causes?--The question answered--Bodily and mental injuries now  sustained by children of all ranks, described and prevented--What is  the best remedy for existing evils?--Answer given--Origin and history  of the Infant System--Its progress in Scotland, where it might least  have been expected--What are the objections to the system?--Practical  refutation of them--Modes of instruction: The alphabet, spelling,  reading, arithmetic--Moral cultivation enforced, and the means  explained.    SECOND LECTURE.--A play-ground made not only delightful, but _mentally  and morally_ improving--The class-room adapted to produce and confirm  religious impressions--Music, its application to improve the feelings  and memory--Representations of natural objects and scriptural  subjects--Variety and extent of information attainable--Lying,  dishonesty, injustice, and cruelty corrected.    THIRD LECTURE.--New plans of reward and punishment--Influence of fear  and love--Great difference in the result--Infant system more fully  explained--Appeals to conscience--Emulation unnecessary--Elliptical  plan of teaching described--Trials by jury--Effect of  sympathy--Infants the instruments of improving one another.    FOURTH LECTURE.--Methods of teaching the elements of grammar,  geography, and geometry--Gallery described, and its application to  many useful purposes--Qualifications of instructors--Injury sustained  from their deficiencies and errors--The system contrasted with former  methods--Ultimate effects of its diffusion--Servants prepared to  become blessings to families--Hints to parents, and the application of  the whole system to children of every grade.    These lectures I am ready to deliver wherever it may be deemed  desirable, and to follow up the effect by the organization of schools.  The necessary apparatus may be obtained of myself.          CHAPTER V.    PRINCIPLES OF INFANT EDUCATION.    _Moral treatment--Importance of exercise--Play-ground  indispensable--The education of nature and human education should  be joined--Mental development, children should think for  themselves--Intellectual food adapted for children--A spirit  of inquiry should be excited--Gradual development of the young  mind--Neglect of moral treatment--Inefficacy of maxims learned by  wrote--Influence of love--The play-ground a field of observation--The  natural propensities there shew themselves--Respect of  private property inculcated--Force of conscience on the  alert--Anecdote--Advantages of a strict regard for truth--The simple  truths of the Bible fit for children_.           *       *       *       *       *    \"The business of education, in respect of knowledge, is not, as I  think to perfect a learner in all or any one of the sciences, but to  give his mind that disposition, and those habits, that may enable  him to attain any part of knowledge he shall stand in need of in the  future coarse of his life.\"--_Locke_.    \"When the obligations of morality are taught, let the sanctions of  Christianity, never be forgotten; by which it will be shewn not that  they give lustre and strength to each other: religion will appear to  be the voice of reason, and morality the will of God.\"--_Johnson_.           *       *       *       *       *      When Agesilaus, king of Sparta, was asked, \"What should boys be  taught?\" he answered, \"What they ought to do when they become  men.\" Such a declaration was worthy of later times, since the most  intelligent now admit that the great end of all education is the  formation of solid, useful, and virtuous character. This work should  be, doubtless, commenced at the earliest possible period, to it the  system explained in this volume is considered to be adapted, and the  principles on which it proceeds are now to be illustrated. And here it  ought to be particularly observed that nothing is admissible, except  what is appropriate to the state of infancy, calculated to exercise  the physical energies, and likely, by their invigoration, to lay the  basis of a sound and powerful intellect. And yet all this is too often  forgotten. Look at the infant, the very embodying of vivacity and  activity, and its confinement to a particular posture, or the  requirement of a peculiar expression of countenance, is manifestly  unnatural. An inactive and healthy child under six years of age is  never seen. Whatever compels it to be otherwise consequently produces  what is artificial in character. A parent or a teacher may keep his  children quiet, and in what he terms order; but it does not follow  that this is a good preparation for after years. On the contrary,  bondage may issue in excess. The feelings and propensities which,  instead of being corrected, are unduly restrained, will be manifested  in some other ways, and under less favourable"]]]
