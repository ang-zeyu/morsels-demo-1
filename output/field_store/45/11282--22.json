Here, then, we have  simply an enormously deep well-hole.  The door of the room was massive,  and was fastened with a lock nearly a foot square.  It was evidently  intended for some kind of protection to someone or something; but no one  in those days had ever heard of anyone having been allowed even to see  the room.  All this is _a propos_ of a suggestion on my part that the  well-hole was a way by which the White Worm (whatever it was) went and  came.  At that time I would have had a search made--even excavation if  necessary--at my own expense, but all suggestions were met with a prompt  and explicit negative.  So, of course, I took no further step in the  matter.  Then it died out of recollection--even of mine.\"    \"Do you remember, sir,\" asked Adam, \"what was the appearance of the room  where the well-hole was?  Was there furniture--in fact, any sort of thing  in the room?\"    \"The only thing I remember was a sort of green light--very clouded, very  dim--which came up from the well.  Not a fixed light, but intermittent  and irregular--quite unlike anything I had ever seen.\"    \"Do you remember how you got into the well-room?  Was there a separate  door from outside, or was there any interior room or passage which opened  into it?\"    \"I think there must have been some room with a way into it.  I remember  going up some steep steps; they must have been worn smooth by long use or  something of the kind, for I could hardly keep my feet as I went up.  Once  I stumbled and nearly fell into the well-hole.\"    \"Was there anything strange about the place--any queer smell, for  instance?\"    \"Queer smell--yes!  Like bilge or a rank swamp.  It was distinctly  nauseating; when I came out I felt as if I had just been going to be  sick.  I shall try back on my visit and see if I can recall any more of  what I saw or felt.\"    \"Then perhaps, sir, later in the day you will tell me anything you may  chance to recollect.\"    \"I shall be delighted, Adam.  If your uncle has not returned by then,  I'll join you in the study after dinner, and we can resume this  interesting chat.\"          CHAPTER XVII--THE MYSTERY OF \"THE GROVE\"      That afternoon Adam decided to do a little exploring.  As he passed  through the wood outside the gate of Diana's Grove, he thought he saw the  African's face for an instant.  So he went deeper into the undergrowth,  and followed along parallel to the avenue to the house.  He was glad that  there was no workman or servant about, for he did not care that any of  Lady Arabella's people should find him wandering about her grounds.  Taking advantage of the denseness of the trees, he came close to the  house and skirted round it.  He was repaid for his trouble, for on the  far side of the house, close to where the rocky frontage of the cliff  fell away, he saw Oolanga crouched behind the irregular trunk of a great  oak.  The man was so intent on watching someone, or something, that he  did not guard against being himself watched.  This suited Adam, for he  could thus make scrutiny at will.    The thick wood, though the trees were mostly of small girth, threw a  heavy shadow, so that the steep declension, in front of which grew the  tree behind which the African lurked, was almost in darkness.  Adam drew  as close as he could, and was amazed to see a patch of light on the  ground before him; when he realised what it was, he was determined, more  than ever to follow on his quest.  The nigger had a dark lantern in his  hand, and was throwing the light down the steep incline.  The glare  showed a series of stone steps, which ended in a low-lying heavy iron  door fixed against the side of the house.  All the strange things he had  heard from Sir Nathaniel, and all those, little and big, which he had  himself noticed, crowded into his mind in a chaotic way.  Instinctively  he took refuge behind a thick oak stem, and set himself down, to watch  what might occur.    After a short time it became apparent that the African was trying to find  out what was behind the heavy door.  There was no way of looking in, for  the door fitted tight into the massive stone slabs.  The only opportunity  for the entrance of light was through a small hole between the great  stones above the door.  This hole was too high up to look through from  the ground level.  Oolanga, having tried standing tiptoe on the highest  point near, and holding the lantern as high as he could, threw the light  round the edges of the door to see if he could find anywhere a hole or a  flaw in the metal through which he could obtain a glimpse.  Foiled in  this, he brought from the shrubbery a plank, which he leant against the  top of the door and then climbed up with great dexterity.  This did not  bring him near enough to the window-hole to look in, or even to throw the  light of the lantern through it, so he climbed down and carried the plank  back to the place from which he had got it.  Then he concealed himself  near the iron door and waited, manifestly with the intent of remaining  there till someone came near.  Presently Lady Arabella, moving  noiselessly through the shade, approached the door.  When he saw her  close enough to touch it, Oolanga stepped forward from his concealment,  and spoke in a whisper, which through the gloom sounded like a hiss.    \"I want to see you, missy--soon and secret.\"    \"What do you want?\"    \"You know well, missy; I told you already.\"    She turned on him with blazing eyes, the green tint in them glowing like  emeralds.    \"Come, none of that.  If there is anything sensible which you wish to say  to me, you can see me here, just where we are, at seven o'clock.\"    He made no reply in words, but, putting the backs of his hands together,  bent lower and lower till his forehead touched the earth.  Then he rose  and went slowly away.    Adam Salton, from his hiding-place, saw and wondered.  In a few minutes  he moved from his place and went home to Lesser Hill, fully determined  that seven o'clock would find him in some hidden place behind Diana's  Grove.    At a little before seven Adam stole softly out of the house and took the  back-way to the rear of Diana's Grove.  The place seemed silent and  deserted, so he took the opportunity of concealing himself near the spot  whence he had seen Oolanga trying to investigate whatever was concealed  behind the iron door.  He waited, perfectly still, and at last saw a  gleam of white passing soundlessly through the undergrowth.  He was not  surprised when he recognised the colour of Lady Arabella's dress.  She  came close and waited, with her face to the iron door.  From some place  of concealment near at hand Oolanga appeared, and came close to her.  Adam  noticed, with surprised amusement, that over his shoulder was the box  with the mongoose.  Of course the African did not know that he was seen  by anyone, least of all by the man whose property he had with him.    Silent-footed as he was, Lady Arabella heard him coming, and turned to  meet him.  It was somewhat hard to see in the gloom, for, as usual, he  was all in black, only his collar and cuffs showing white.  Lady Arabella  opened the conversation which ensued between the two.    \"What do you want?  To rob me, or murder me?\"    \"No, to lub you!\"    This frightened her a little, and she tried to change the tone.    \"Is that a coffin you have with you?  If so, you are wasting your time.  It would not hold me.\"    When a nigger suspects he is being laughed at, all the ferocity of his  nature comes to the front; and this man was of the lowest kind.    \"Dis ain't no coffin for nobody.  Dis box is for you.  Somefin you lub.  Me give him to you!\"    Still anxious to keep off the subject of affection, on which she believed  him to have become crazed, she made another effort to keep his mind  elsewhere.    \"Is this why you want to see me?\"  He nodded.  \"Then come round to the  other door.  But be quiet.  I have no desire to be seen so close to my  own house in conversation with a--a--a nigger like you!\"    She had chosen the word deliberately.  She wished to meet his passion  with another kind.  Such would, at all events, help to keep him quiet.  In  the deep gloom she could not see the anger which suffused his face.  Rolling eyeballs and grinding teeth are, however, sufficient signs of  anger to be decipherable in the dark.  She moved round the corner of the  house to her right.  Oolanga was following her, when she stopped him by  raising her hand.    \"No, not that door,\" she said; \"that is not for niggers.  The other door  will do well enough for you!\"    Lady Arabella took in her hand a small key which hung at the end of her  watch-chain, and moved to a small door, low down, round the corner, and a  little downhill from the edge of the Brow.  Oolanga, in obedience to her  gesture, went back to the iron door.  Adam looked carefully at the  mongoose box as the African went by, and was glad to see that it was  intact.  Unconsciously, as he looked, he fingered the key that was in his  waistcoat pocket.  When Oolanga was out of sight, Adam hurried after Lady  Arabella.          CHAPTER XVIII--EXIT OOLANGA      The woman turned sharply as Adam touched her shoulder.    \"One moment whilst we are alone.  You had better not trust that nigger!\"  he whispered.    Her answer was crisp and concise:    \"I don't.\"    \"Forewarned is forearmed.  Tell me if you will--it is for your own  protection.  Why do you mistrust him?\"    \"My friend, you have no idea of that man's impudence.  Would you believe  that he wants me to marry him?\"    \"No!\" said Adam incredulously, amused in spite of himself.    \"Yes, and wanted to bribe me to do it by sharing a chest of treasure--at  least, he thought it was--stolen from Mr. Caswall.  Why do you distrust  him, Mr. Salton?\"    \"Did you notice that box he had slung on his shoulder?  That belongs to  me.  I left it in the gun-room "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11880"],[0,"Ronicky Doone (#18)"],[1,"than ever, yet she knew perfectly well that John Mark  had not allowed her to be gone so long without keeping watch over her.  Somewhere from the blank faces of those houses across the street his  spies kept guard over her movements. Here she glanced sharply over her  shoulder, and it seemed to her that a shadow flitted into the door of a  basement, farther up the street.    At that she fled and did not stop running until she was at the door of  the house of Mark. Since all was quiet, up and down the street, she  paused again, her hand upon the knob. To enter meant to step back into  the life which she hated. There had been a time when she had almost  loved the life to which John Mark introduced her; there had been a time  when she had rejoiced in the nimbleness of her fingers which had enabled  her to become an adept as a thief. And, by so doing, she had kept the  life of her brother from danger, she verily believed. She was still  saving him, and, so long as she worked for John Mark, she knew that her  brother was safe, yet she hesitated long at the door.    It would be only the work of a moment to flee back to the man she loved,  tell him that she could not and dared not stay longer with the master  criminal, and beg him to take her West to a clean life. Her hand fell  from the knob, but she raised it again immediately.    It would not do to flee, so long as John Mark had power of life or death  over her brother. If Ronicky Doone, as he promised, was able to inspire  her brother with the courage to flee from New York, give up his sporting  life and seek refuge in some far-off place, then, indeed, she would go  with Bill Gregg to the ends of the earth and mock the cunning fiend who  had controlled her life so long.    The important thing now was to disarm him of all suspicion, make him  feel that she had only visited Bill Gregg in order to say farewell to  him. With this in her mind she opened the front door and stepped into  the hall, always lighted with ominous dimness. That gloom fell about her  like the visible presence of John Mark.    A squat, powerful figure glided out of the doorway to the right. It was  Harry Morgan, and the side of his face was swathed in bandages, so that  he had to twist his mouth violently in order to speak.    \"The chief,\" he said abruptly. \"Beat it quick to his room. He wants  you.\"    \"Why?\" asked Caroline, hoping to extract some grain or two of  information from the henchman.    \"Listen, kid,\" said the sullen criminal. \"D'you think I'm a nut to blow  what I know? You beat it, and he'll tell you what he wants.\"    The violence of this language, however, had given her clues enough to  the workings of the chief's mind. She had always been a favored member  of the gang, and the men had whistled attendance on her hardly less than  upon Ruth Tolliver herself. This sudden harshness in the language of  Harry Morgan told her that too much was known, or guessed.    A sudden weakness came over her. \"I'm going out,\" she said, turning to  Harry Morgan who had sauntered over to the front door.    \"Are you?\" he asked.    \"I'm going to take one turn more up the block. I'm not sleepy yet,\" she  repeated and put her hand on the knob of the door.    \"Not so you could notice it, you ain't,\" retorted Morgan. \"We've taken  lip enough from you, kid. Your day's over. Go up and see what the chief  has to say, but you ain't going through this door unless you walk over  me.\"    \"Those are orders?\" she asked, stepping back, with her heart turning  cold.    \"Think I'm doing this on my own hook?\"    She turned slowly to the stairs. With her hand on the balustrade she  decided to try the effect of one personal appeal. Nerving herself she  whirled and ran to Harry Morgan. \"Harry,\" she whispered, \"let me go out  till I've worked up my courage. You know he's terrible to face when he's  angry. And I'm afraid, Harry--I'm terribly afraid!\"    \"Are you?\" asked Morgan. \"Well, you ain't the first. Go and take your  medicine like the rest of us have done, time and time running.\"    There was no help for it. She went wearily up the stairs to the room of  the master thief. There she gave the accustomed rap with the proper  intervals. Instantly the cold, soft voice, which she knew and hated so,  called to her to enter.    She found him in the act of putting aside his book. He was seated in a  deep easy-chair; a dressing gown of silk and a pair of horn-rimmed  spectacles gave him a look of owlish wisdom, with a touch of the owl's  futility of expression, likewise. He rose, as usual, with all his  courtesy. She thought at first, as he showed her to a chair, that he was  going to take his usual damnable tack of pretended ignorance in order to  see how much she would confess. However, tonight this was not his plan  of battle.    The moment she was seated, he removed his spectacles, drew a chair close  to hers and sat down, leaning far forward. \"Now, my dear, foolish girl,\"  said the master thief, smiling benevolently upon her, \"what have you  been doing tonight to make us all miserable?\"    She knew at once that he was aware of every move she had made, from the  first to the last. It gave her firmness to tell the lie with suavity.  \"It's a queer yarn, John,\" she said.    \"I'm used to queer yarns,\" he answered. \"But where have you been all  this time? It was only to take five minutes, I thought.\"    She made herself laugh. \"That's because you don't know Ronicky Doone,  John.\"    \"I'm getting to know him, however,\" said the master. \"And, before I'm  done, I hope to know him very well indeed.\"    \"Well, he has a persuasive tongue.\"    \"I think I noticed that for myself.\"    \"And, when he told me how poor Bill Gregg had come clear across the  continent--\"    \"No wonder you were touched, my dear. New Yorkers won't travel so far,  will they? Not for a girl, I mean.\"    \"Hardly! But Ronicky Doone made it such a sad affair that I promised I'd  go across and see Bill Gregg.\"    \"Not in his room?\"    \"I knew you wouldn't let him come to see me here.\"    \"Never presuppose what I'll do. But go on--I'm interested--very. Just as  much as if Ronicky Doone himself were telling me.\"    She eyed him shrewdly, but, if there were any deception in him, he hid  it well. She could not find the double meaning that must have been  behind his words. \"I went there, however,\" she said, \"because I was  sorry for him, John. If you had seen you'd have been sorry, too, or else  you would have laughed; I could hardly keep from it at first.\"    \"I suppose he took you in his arms at once?\"    \"I think he wanted to. Then, of course, I told him at once why I had  come.\"    \"Which was?\"    \"Simply that it was absurd for him to stay about and persecute me; that  the letters I wrote him were simply written for fun, when I was doing  some of my cousin's work at the correspondence schools; that the best  thing he could do would be to take my regrets and go back to the West.\"    \"Did you tell him all that?\" asked John Mark in a rather changed voice.    \"Yes; but not quite so bluntly.\"    \"Naturally not; you're a gentle girl, Caroline. I suppose he took it  very hard.\"    \"Very, but in a silly way. He's full of pride, you see. He drew himself  up and gave me a lecture about deceiving men.\"    \"Well, since you have lost interest in him, it makes no difference.\"    \"But in a way,\" she said faintly, rising slowly from her chair, \"I can't  help feeling some interest.\"    \"Naturally not. But, you see, I was worried so much about you and this  foolish fellow that I gave orders for him to be put out of the way, as  soon as you left him.\"    Caroline Smith stood for a moment stunned and then ran to him.    \"No, no!\" she declared. \"In the name of the dear mercy of Heaven, John,  you haven't done that?\"    \"I'm sorry.\"    \"Then call him back--the one you sent. Call him back, John, and I'll  serve you the rest of my life without question. I'll never fail you,  John, but for your own sake and mine, for the sake of everything fair in  the world, call him back!\"    He pushed away her hands, but without violence. \"I thought it would be  this way,\" he said coldly. \"You told a very good lie, Caroline. I  suppose clever Ronicky Doone rehearsed you in it, but it needed only the  oldest trick in the world to expose you.\"    She recoiled from him. \"It was only a joke, then? You didn't mean it,  John? Thank Heaven for that!\"    A savagery which, though generally concealed, was never far from the  surface, now broke out in him, making the muscles of his face tense and  his voice metallic. \"Get to your room,\" he said fiercely, \"get to your  room. I've wasted time enough on you and your brat of a brother, and now  a Western lout is to spoil what I've done? I've a mind to wash my hands  of all of you--and sink you. Get to your room, and stay there, while I  make up my mind which of the two I shall do.\"    She went, cringing like one beaten, to the door, and he followed her,  trembling with rage.    \"Or have you a choice?\" he asked. \"Brother or lover, which shall it be?\"    She turned and stretched out her hands to him, unable to speak; but the  man of the sneer struck down her arms and laughed in her face. In mute  terror she fled to her room.          Chapter Seventeen      _Old Scars_    In his room Bill Gregg was striding up and down, throwing his hands  toward the ceiling. Now and then he paused to slap Ronicky Doone on the  back.    \"It's fate, Ronicky,\" he said, over and over again. \"Thinking of waking  up and finding the girl that you've loved and lost standing waiting for  you! It's the dead come to life. I'm the happiest man in the world.  Ronicky, old boy, one of these days I'll be able--\" He paused, stopped  by the solemnity of Doone's face. \"What's wrong, Ronicky?\"    \"I don't know,\" said the other gloomily. He rubbed his arms slowly, as  if to bring back the circulation to numbed limbs.    \"You act like you're sick, Ronicky.\"    \"I'm getting bad-luck signs, Bill."]]]
