[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3785"],[0,"In the Reign of Terror: The Adventures of a Westminster Boy (#14)"],[1," a prolonged talk with M. du Tillet the marquis sent for  Ernest. As soon as he entered the lad said:    \"Of course, sir, I shall obey your commands; but it seems to me an  unworthy part for your son to play, to be flying the country and  leaving a stranger here to look after your daughters.\"      \"He is hardly a stranger, Ernest,\" the marquis replied. \"He has been  with us as one of the family for two years, and he risked his life  for your sisters. You could not stay here without extreme risk, for  if your name is not already included in the warrant for arrest it  speedily will be so, and when they once taste blood these wolves  will hunt down every one of us. He, on the other hand, might proceed  openly through the streets without danger; nevertheless, I would  not have kept him if he would have gone; but I have no power  of controlling him, and as he chooses to devote himself to us I  thankfully accept his devotion.    \"And now, my son, it may be that after our parting to-morrow we  shall not meet again, for God alone knows what fate is in store for  us. I have, therefore, some serious advice to give you. If anything  happens to me, you will, I know, never forget that you are the  head of the family, and that the honour of a great name is in your  keeping; but do not try to strive against the inevitable. Adapt  yourself to the new circumstances under which you will be placed,  and lay aside that pride which has had much to do with the misfortunes  which are now befalling us.    \"As to your sisters, Marie is already provided for, that is if  De Gisons is not included in the order for arrest. I have already  sent off a message to him to warn him; and as it has already been  arranged between us that while his father will stay and face whatever  will come, it is his duty, like yours, to escape the danger which  threatens our class, I trust that he will at once endeavour to  leave the country; but I imagine that he will stop in Paris until  some means are devised for getting your sisters away.    \"As to the others, if you all reach England and settle down there  do not keep up the class distinctions which have prevailed here.  Marry your sisters to men who will protect and make them happy.  That these must be gentlemen goes without saying; but that is  sufficient.  For example, if in future time a gentleman of the rank  of our English friend here, of whose character you can entirely  approve, asks for the hand of either of your younger sisters, do  not refuse it. Remember that such a suit would have the cordial  approval of your mother and myself.\"    A look of great surprise passed over Ernest's face. It had seemed  to him so much a matter of course that the ladies of his house should  marry into noble families that the idea of one of them being given  to a gentleman belonging to the professional class was surprising  indeed.    \"Do you really mean, sir, that if my friend Harry were some day to  ask for Jeanne's hand you would approve of the match?\"    \"That is exactly what I do mean, Ernest. In the stormy times in  which we are living I could wish no better protector for her. Were  he a Frenchman, in the same position of life, I own that I might  view the matter in a different light; but, as I have said, in  England the distinction of classes is much less marked than here;  and, moreover, in England there is little fear of such an outbreak  of democracy as that which is destroying France.\"    A few minutes later Monsieur du Tillet entered with the clothes which  had been prepared for the boys. They were such as would be worn by  the sons of workmen; he himself was attired in a blue blouse and  trousers. Jules was aroused from the couch on which he had for the  last hour been asleep, and he and Ernest retired to dress themselves  in their new costume, M. du Tillet accompanying them to assist in  their toilet. Both boys had the greatest repugnance to the change,  and objected still further when M. du Tillet insisted it was  absolutely necessary that they should cut their hair and smear  their faces and hands with dirt.    \"My dear Monsieur Ernest,\" he said, \"it would be worse than useless  for you to assume that attire unless at the same time you assumed  the bearing and manners appropriate to it. In your own dress we  might for a short time walk the street without observation; but if  you sallied out in that blouse with your white hands and your head  thrown back, and a look of disdain and disgust on your face, the  first gamin who met you would cry out, 'There is an aristocrat in  disguise!'    \"You must behave as if you were acting in a comedy. You are  representing a lad of the lower orders. You must try to imitate  his walk and manner. Shove your hands deep in your pockets, shuffle  your feet along carelessly; let your head roll about as if it were  uneasy on your neck, round your shoulders, and slouch your head  forward.  As to you Jules, your role should be impertinence. Put  your cap on the wrong way; hold your nose in the air; pull your  short hair down over your forehead, and let some of it  spurt  out through that hole in your cap. To be quite correct, you ought  to address jeering remarks to every respectable man and woman you  meet in the streets; but as you know nothing of Parisian slang,  you must hold your tongue. See how thoroughly I have got myself  up. You would take me for an idle out-of-elbows workman wherever  you met me. I do not like it; but, as I have to disguise myself,  I try to do it thoroughly.\"    It was, however, with a feeling of humiliation that the boys presented  themselves before the marquis. He looked at them scrutinizingly.    \"You will do, my boys,\" he said gravely. \"I should have passed  you in the street without knowing you. Now come in with me and say  good-bye to your mother and sisters. The sooner you are out of this  house the better, for there is no saying at what hour the agents  of the canaille may present themselves.\"    The parting was a sad one indeed, but it was over at last, and  Monsieur du Tillet hurried the two boys away as soon as their father  returned with them.    \"God bless you, du Tillet!\" the marquis said as he embraced his  friend. \"Should aught happen to us, you will, I know, be a father  to them.\"    \"Now, Harry,\" the marquis said when he had mastered the emotion  caused by the parting, which he felt might be a final one, \"since  you have chosen to throw in your lot with ours, I will give you a  few instructions. In the first place, I have hidden under a plank  beneath my bed a bag containing a thousand crowns. It is the middle  plank. Count an even number from each leg and the centre one covers  the bag.    \"You will find the plank is loose and that you can raise it easily  with a knife; but wax has been run in, and dust swept over it, so  that there is no fear of its being noticed by any who may pillage  the house, which they will doubtless do after we are arrested. I  have already sent an equal sum to Louise Moulin. Here is her address;  but it is possible that you may need money, and may be unable to  communicate with my daughters at her house; at any rate do you keep  the bag of money in your charge.    \"You had best attire yourself at once in the oldest suit of clothes  you have got. My daughters will be ready in a few minutes. They are  already dressed, so that they can slip out at the back entrance.  Should we be disturbed before morning I shall place them under your  escort; for although I hope that all the servants are faithful, one  can answer for no one in these times. I would send them off now,  but that the sight of females moving through the streets at this  time of night would be likely to attract attention on the part of  drunken men, or of fellows returning from these rascally clubs,  which are the centre and focus of all the mischief that is going  on.    \"I can give you no further advice. You must be guided by  circumstances. If, as I trust, the girls can live undisturbed and  unsuspected with their mother's old nurse, it were best that they  should remain there until the troubles are finally over, and France  comes to her senses again. If not, I must leave it to you to act for  the best. It is a great trust to place in the hands of a youth of  your age; but it is your own choosing, and we have every confidence  in you.    \"I will do my best to deserve it, sir,\" Harry said quietly; \"but I  trust that you and madame la marquise will soon be able to resume  your guardianship. I cannot believe that although just at present  the populace are excited to fury by agitators, they can in cold  blood intend to wreak their vengeance upon all the classes above  them.\"    \"I hope you may be right,\" the marquis said; \"but I fear that it  is not so. The people are mad so far. All that has been done has  in no way mitigated their sufferings, and they gladly follow the  preachings of the arch scoundrels of the Jacobin Club. I fear that  before all this is over France will be deluged with blood. And  now, when you have changed your clothes, lie down, ready to rise  at a moment's notice.  Should you hear a tumult, run at once to  the long gallery. There my daughters will join you prepared for  flight. Lead them instantly to the back entrance, avoiding, if  possible, any observation from the domestics. As these sleep on  the floor above, and know nothing of the dangers which threaten us,  they will not awake so quickly, and I trust that you will be able  to get out without being seen by any of them. In that case, however  closely questioned no one will be able to afford a clue by which  you can be traced.\"    When he had changed his clothes Harry extinguished all the lights in  the salon, for the marquis had long before ordered all the servants  to retire to rest. Then he opened the window looking into the street  and took his place close to it. Sleep under the circumstances was  impossible.    As the hours passed he thought over the events of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37856"],[0,"The Determined Angler and the Brook Trout (#14)"],[1,"of wet flies there are experimentations galore that will serve as  well as any of the standard regulation flies. I can sit down and  construct offhand a fly to be used as wet or submerged that I feel  sure I can use with as much success as with the miller, gnat, or any  other fly that is no doubt much on the order of an imitation of the  natural. Perhaps in writing the article I was thinking too deeply of  the eccentric nondescripts that do not imitate nature. Yet these  nondescripts (flies tied anyway to suit the fancy), yet having hackle  wings, etc., will get the fish; they are drawn in the water gently  back and forth, thus purporting to be some insect drowning; yet I  doubt very much if the fish can tell what sort of a fly, living fly,  it should be. I do not care; it is the motion, the apparent endeavor  of the fly to get out of that watery prison that arouses the fish's  blood. However, Halford says: 'The modern theory is that these  patterns (the wet flies) are taken by the fish for the nymphae or  pupae--these being the scientific names of the immature insects at the  stage immediately preceding the winged form.... Candidly, however, the  presence of the wings in the sunk fly pattern has puzzled me, because  in my experience I have never seen the winged insects submerged by the  action of the stream. Sedges do at times descend to oviposit and so do  certain spinners, but the appearance under this condition, with an air  bubble between their wings, resembles nothing so much as a globe of  mercury--an appearance which bears no resemblance to the ordinary sunk  fly patterns.' I have been strictly a devotee to the wet-fly form, and  always hold that it is the better fly for our swift Western streams;  in the wet form certainly it is the better fly two thirds of the time.  Still, glassy pools, even smooth waters, come few and far between,  but, where they are, there the dry fly is a valuable addition to the  Angler's outfit. You might change my article (in the paragraph in  question) to read thus: 'The wide range of difference between some wet  flies and the dry fly lies in the fact that a good number of wet flies  are an imitation of no special thing active and living, while the  majority of the dry flies purport to be an imitation of natural  flies.' This would exclude the wet flies that make good dry flies,  namely the suggested millers, gnats, etc. It would be interesting to  know the number of captures made with wet flies as they fall lightly  to water and for a moment ride the brim. Captures have been made  wherein two thirds of the time the wet fly has lain on the surface  but a scant moment before it was seized. In my great number of  articles printed in the universal outdoor press I have always  suggested that the fly be cast easily to water, expecting, first, a  rise as it lies on the surface; second, failing at this, then the fly  submerges and is drawn in the water, to assure the opening and closing  of hackles, thus purporting to imitate the drowning, struggling  insect.\"    Charles Hallock, author of _The Sportsman's Gazetteer_, _The Salmon  Fisher_, etc.: \"I have nothing more to say. I hung up my trout rod  last summer at Chesterfield. Mass., in my eighty-second year. So, my  fly-book is closed. Let younger Anglers do the talking and discuss _ad  infinitum_. Flies are not on my line. Good-bye.\"        \"To frame the little animal      Let nature guide thee.\"                          --GAY.        TROUT TAKING THE FLY    \"You will observe when casting the wet fly ... that trout seldom rise  to the fly when it first strikes the water ... after years of  experience I am prepared to state as my opinion that such a thing does  not happen once in thirty casts.\"--Charles Zibeon Southard, _Trout  Fly-Fishing in America_.    This has not been my experience with _fontinalis_ in the streams and  ponds of Long Island, N. Y., and the mountain brooks of Pennsylvania,  where many of my trout took the fly almost before it touched the  water. I have seen trout catch large live flies in the air a few  inches over the surface. I think large trout in clear, still ponds  easily see the cast fly before it alights. The trout in rapid streams  may not be so alert, but I have certainly caught many a specimen on  the fly the instant the lure touched the water.    Mr. William M. Carey, who is responsible for the frontispiece in this  volume, is positive trout often jump out of the water in taking the  fly. I, too, have seen trout do so. It is not a regular practice of  the species, but I easily recall many instances of the trout leaping  clear of the surface and taking the fly in the descent. Trout of all  sizes will often strike both living and artificial flies with their  tails, this either in play or to disable the insect. A writer in  _Forest and Stream_ (January 9, 1901) says: \"In fishing a trout stream  in northern Michigan I was using a cast of a Parmachenee belle and a  brown hackle. I was wading downstream, and I came to a place where a  tree had fallen into the stream, and after several casts I noticed  some small trout following my flies. I cast again, and while my flies  were five or six inches from the water a trout four or five inches  long jumped clear out of the water, grabbed my Parmachenee belle and  immediately dove with it in its mouth. I believe the same trout did  the same thing several times while I was fishing there. These were  brook trout and they were not jumping except when they jumped at my  flies.\"    The foregoing comments were submitted to Mr. Southard, and he writes  me:    \"What you say about catching trout in Long Island waters and the  mountain brooks of Pennsylvania is entirely true. During the early  spring season I have caught, at times, many small trout on such waters  in precisely the same way, and in addition there have been days on  many different waters where occasionally during the whole of the open  season I have caught trout when they rose the moment the fly alighted  upon the water. These experiences of ours alone, however, do not  establish as a fact nor as a general proposition that trout rise to a  fly more often when it first alights upon the water than after the fly  has been fished or played by the Angler; nor that my statement as a  general proposition is not a correct one.    \"The statement was perhaps poorly worded and thus misleading, and I  should have said that on _an average_ trout do not rise to a fly once  in thirty casts when it first alights upon the water. My opinion was  based, _first_, upon trout fly-fishing on all kinds of fishable waters  wherever found; _second_, upon all sizes of trout from the minimum of  six inches to the maximum of thirty inches whether or not they were  indigenous or planted fish; _third_, upon my own experience of over  twenty-five years as well as the opinion of many Anglers and guides  with an experience covering a longer period than my own; _fourth_,  upon my knowledge of the habits and habitats of trout under the many  varying conditions which govern their lives and actions.    \"Unfortunately most Anglers have given almost no thought to studying  and analyzing 'the art of fly-fishing' to the end that they may become  better and more successful fishermen and thus enjoy to a greater  extent the pleasures of the clean, dignified, and delightful sport of  angling. It is not surprising then that an Angler upon first thought,  even an experienced one, might think that trout rise to flies when  they first alight upon the water more often than once in thirty casts  because he remembers only the rises and his successes, but pays very  little attention to the lack of either. How many Anglers know  approximately the number of casts they make in an hour? How many know  the number of rises they have and when? How many know the number of  trout that rise and strike and are hooked and landed? The answer is  'Few indeed'; and those who hazard a guess are usually far from the  facts.    \"The average fly-fishing Angler casts his fly or flies, _on most  waters_, from five to seven times a minute and the less experienced  Angler from seven to ten times. With the more experienced Angler this  means that he casts from 300 to 420 times in an hour and in five hours  from 1500 to 2100 times. Let us take the lesser number as a basis of  reasoning; in one hour, if once in thirty casts a trout rose, struck,  and was hooked when the fly first alighted upon the water, the  Angler's creel would be richer by ten fish and in five hours by fifty  fish. Then to this number should be added the trout that rise, strike,  and are hooked _after_ the fly has alighted upon the water and has  been fished or played by the Angler. Would it not be a fair  proposition to say that at least as many trout would be caught under  the latter circumstances as the former? To my mind it would. The  Angler then would have creeled one hundred fish in five hours. As some  trout, even with the most expert of Anglers, are bound to be lost let  us be liberal and place the loss at fifty per cent., thus making the  Angler's net catch fifty instead of one hundred fish. Think this over  and think over what your experience has been, day after day and season  after season, and ask yourself if a catch of this size is not very  unusual on the best of trout fishing waters. So far as my own  experience goes it certainly is most unusual, and I fish on many fine  waters each year and for at least one hundred days.    \"There are some places, especially in the State of Maine, and notably  'The Meadow Grounds' of 'The Seven Ponds,' Franklin County, where at  times large numbers of small trout, running from five to seven or  eight inches, can be caught in a fishing day of five hours and I have  known of Anglers catching, though not killing, from three hundred to  seven hundred trout and most of them rose to the flies when they first  alighted upon the water.
