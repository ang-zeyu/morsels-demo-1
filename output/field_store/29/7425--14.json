Again and again, when watching these gatherings at Savernake and at  other places where jays abound, I have been reminded of the  description given by Alfred Russel Wallace of the bird of paradise  assemblies in the Malayan region. Our jay in some ways resembles his  glorious Eastern relation; and although his lustre is so much less, he  is at his very best not altogether unworthy of being called the  British Bird of Paradise.          CHAPTER V    A WOOD WREN AT WELLS      East of Wells Cathedral, close to the moat surrounding the bishop's  palace, there is a beautifully wooded spot, a steep slope, where the  birds had their headquarters. There was much to attract them there:  sheltered by the hill behind, it was a warm corner, a wooded angle,  protected by high old stone walls, dear to the redstart, masses of  ivy, and thickets of evergreens; while outside the walls were green  meadows and running water. When going out for a walk I always passed  through this wood, lingering a little in it; and when I wanted to  smoke a pipe, or have a lazy hour to myself among the trees, or  sitting in the sun, I almost invariably made for this favourite spot.  At different hours of the day I was a visitor, and there I heard the  first spring migrants on their arrival--chiff-chaff, willow wren,  cuckoo, redstart, blackcap, white-throat. Then, when April was drawing  to an end, I said, There are no more to come. For the wryneck, lesser  white-throat, and garden warbler had failed to appear, and the few  nightingales that visit the neighbourhood had settled down in a more  secluded spot a couple of miles away, where the million leaves in  coppice and brake were not set a-tremble by the melodious thunder of  the cathedral chimes.    Nevertheless, there was another still to come, the one I perhaps love  best of all. On the last day of April I heard the song of the wood  wren, and at once all the other notes ceased for a while to interest  me. Even the last comer, the mellow blackcap, might have been singing  at that spot since February, like the wren and hedge-sparrow, so  familiar and workaday a strain did it seem to have compared with this  late warbler. I was more than glad to welcome him to that particular  spot, where if he chose to stay I should have him so near me.    It is well known that the wood wren can only be properly seen  immediately after his arrival in this country, at the end of April or  early in May, when the young foliage does not so completely hide his  slight unresting form, as is the case afterwards. For he,  too, is green in colour; like Wordsworth's green linnet,       A brother of the leaves he seems.    There is another reason why he can be seen so much better during the  first days of his sojourn with us: he does not then keep to the higher  parts of the tall trees he frequents, as his habit is later, when the  air is warm and the minute winged insects on which he feeds are  abundant on the upper sun-touched foliage of the high oaks and  beeches. On account of that ambitious habit of the wood wren there is  no bird with us so difficult to observe; you may spend hours at a  spot, where his voice sounds from the trees at intervals of half a  minute to a minute, without once getting a glimpse of his form. At the  end of April the trees are still very thinly clad; the upper foliage  is but an airy garment, a slight golden-green mist, through which the  sun shines, lighting up the dim interior, and making the bed of old  fallen beech-leaves look like a floor of red gold. The small-winged  insects, sun-loving and sensitive to cold, then hold their revels near  the surface; and the bird, too, prefers the neighbourhood of the  earth. It was so in the case of the wood wren I observed at Wells,  watching him on several consecutive days, sometimes for an hour or two  at a stretch, and generally more than once a day. The spot where he  was always to be found was quite free from underwood, and the trees  were straight and tall, most of them with slender, smooth boles.  Standing there, my figure must have looked very conspicuous to all the  small birds in the place; but for a time it seemed to me that the wood  wren paid not the slightest attention to my presence; that as he  wandered hither and thither in sunlight and shade at his own sweet  will, my motionless form was no more to him than a moss-grown stump or  grey upright stone. By and by it became apparent that the bird knew me  to be no stump or stone, but a strange living creature whose  appearance greatly interested him; for invariably, soon after I had  taken up my position, his careless little flights from twig to twig  and from tree to tree brought him nearer, and then nearer, and finally  near me he would remain for most of the time. Sometimes he would  wander for a distance of forty or fifty yards away, but before long he  would wander back and be with me once more, often perching so near  that the most delicate shadings of his plumage were as distinctly seen  as if I had had him perched on my hand.    The human form seen in an unaccustomed place always excites a good  deal of attention among the birds; it awakes their curiosity,  suspicion, and alarm. The wood wren was probably curious and nothing  more; his keeping near me looked strange only because he at the same  time appeared so wholly absorbed in his own music. Two or three times  I tried the experiment of walking to a distance of fifty or sixty  yards and taking up a new position; but always after a while he would  drift thither, and I would have him near me, singing and moving, as  before.    I was glad of this inquisitiveness, if that was the bird's motive  (that I had unconsciously fascinated him I could not believe); for of  all the wood wrens I have seen this seemed the most beautiful, most  graceful in his motions, and untiring in song. Doubtless this was  because I saw him so closely, and for such long intervals. His fresh  yellowish-green upper and white under plumage gave him a wonderfully  delicate appearance, and these colours harmonised with the tender  greens of the opening leaves and the pale greys and silvery whites of  the slender boles.    Seebohm says of this species: \"They arrive in our woods in  marvellously perfect plumage. In the early morning sun they look  almost as delicate a yellowish-green as the half-grown leaves amongst  which they disport themselves. In the hand the delicate shading of the  eye-stripe, and the margin of the feathers of the wings and tail, is  exquisitely beautiful, but is almost all lost under the rude handling  of the bird-skinner.\"    The concluding words sound almost strange; but it is a fact that this  sylph-like creature is sometimes shattered with shot and its poor  remains operated on by the bird-stuffer. Its beauty \"in the hand\"  cannot compare with that exhibited when it lives and moves and sings.  Its appearance during flight differs from that of other warblers on  account of the greater length and sharpness of the wings. Most  warblers fly and sing hurriedly; the wood wren's motions, like its  song, are slower, more leisurely, and more beautiful. When moved by  the singing passion it is seldom still for more than a few moments at  a time, but is continually passing from branch to branch, from tree to  tree, finding a fresh perch from which to deliver its song on each  occasion. At such times it has the appearance of a delicately coloured  miniature kestrel or hobby. Most lovely is its appearance when it  begins to sing in the air, for then the long sharp wings beat time to  the first clear measured notes, the prelude to the song. As a rule,  however, the flight is silent, and the song begins when the new perch  is reached--first the distinct notes that are like musical strokes,  and fall faster and faster until they run and swell into a long  passionate trill--the woodland sound which is like no other.    Charming a creature as the wood wren appears when thus viewed closely  in the early spring-time, he is not my favourite among small birds  because of his beauty of shape and colour and graceful motions, which  are seen only for a short time, but on account of his song, which  lasts until September; though I may not find it very easy to give a  reason for the preference.    It comforts me a little in this inquiry to remember that Wordsworth  preferred the stock-dove to the nightingale--that \"creature of  ebullient heart.\" The poet was a little shaky in his ornithology at  times; but if we take it that he meant the ring-dove, his preference  might still seem strange to some. Perhaps it is not so very strange  after all.    If we take any one of the various qualities which we have agreed to  consider highest in bird-music, we find that the wood wren compares  badly with his fellow-vocalists--that, measured by this standard, he  is a very inferior singer. Thus, in variety, he cannot compare with  the thrush, garden-warbler, sedge-warbler, and others; in brilliance  and purity of sound with the nightingale, blackcap, etc.; in strength  and joyousness with the skylark; in mellowness with the blackbird; in  sprightliness with the goldfinch and chaffinch; in sweetness with the  wood-lark, tree-pipit, reed-warbler, the chats and wagtails, and so on  to the end of all the qualities which we regard as important. What,  then, is the charm of the wood wren's song? The sound is unlike any  other, but that is nothing, since the same can be said of the wryneck  and cuckoo and grasshopper warbler. To many persons the wood wren's  note is a bird-sound and nothing more, and it may even surprise them  to hear it called a song. Indeed, some ornithologists have said that  it is not a song, but a call or cry, and it has also been described as  \"harsh.\"    I here recall a lady who sat next to me on the coach that took me from  Minehead to Lynton. The lady resided at Lynton, and finding that I was  visiting the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37814"],[0,"The Story of Magellan and The Discovery of the Philippines (#14)"],[1,"em; and he gave them himself every day the  water of this said fruit, the cocho, which comforted them much.\"    Pigafetta tells us that near this isle is another where there is a kind  of people \"who wear holes in their ears so large that they can pass  their arms through them\"--a very remarkable statement--\"and these people  go naked, except that round their middles they wear cloth made of the  bark of trees. But there are some of the more remarkable of them who  wear cotton stuff, and at the end of it there is some work of silk done  with a needle. These people are tawny, fat, and painted, and they anoint  themselves with the oil of cocoanuts and sesame to preserve them from  the sun and the wind. Their hair is very black and long, reaching to the  waist, and they carry small daggers and knives, ornamented with gold.\"    Pigafetta fell into the sea here, and he gives a vivid account of the  personal accident:    \"The Monday of Passion week, the 25th of March, and feast of our Lady,  in the afternoon, and being ready to depart from this place, I went to  the side of our ship to fish, and putting my feet on a spar to go down  to the storeroom, my feet slipped, because it had rained, and I fell  into the sea, without any one seeing me; and being near drowning, by  luck I found at my left hand the sheet of the large sail which was in  the sea, I caught hold of it and began to cry out till some came to help  and pick me up with the boat. I was assisted not by my merits, but by  the mercy and grace of the Fountain of Pity. That same day we took the  course between west and southwest, and passed amid four small islands;  that it to say, Cenalo, Huinanghar, Ibusson, and Abarien.\"    The Italian describes in an interesting way the visit of the King of one  of the islands to the ships. He says of this first visit of a Philippine  King to the Europeans:    \"Thursday, the 28th of March, having seen the night before fire upon an  island, at the morning we came to anchor at this island, where we saw a  small boat which they call boloto, with eight men inside, which  approached the ship of the Captain General. Then a slave of the  Captain's, who was from Sumatra, otherwise named Traprobana, spoke from  afar to these people, who understood his talk, and came near to the side  of the ship, but they withdrew immediately, and would not enter the ship  from fear of us.    \"So the Captain, seeing that they would not trust to us, showed them a  red cap and other things, which he had tied and placed on a little  plank, and the people in the boat took them immediately and joyously,  and then returned to advise their King. Two hours afterward, or  thereabout, we saw come two long boats, which they call ballanghai, full  of men.    \"In the largest of them was their King sitting under an awning of mats;  when they were near the ship of the Captain General, the said slave  spoke to the King, who understood him well, because in these countries  the kings know more languages than the common people. Then the King  ordered some of his people to go to the Captain's ship, while he would  not move from his boat, which was near enough to us.    \"This was done, and when his people returned to the boat, he went away  at once. The Captain made a good entertainment to the men who came to  his ship, and gave them all sorts of things, on which account the King  wished to give the Captain a rather large bar of solid gold, and a chest  full of ginger. However, the Captain thanked him very much, but would  not accept the present. After that, when it was late, he went with the  ships near to the houses and abode of the King.\"    The Captain in refusing the offer of gold and ginger from his guest,  showed indeed a true sense of hospitality. The incident pictures the  life of Magellan. He obeyed his moral sense and his heart was true. He  was a Portuguese gentleman of the old type, and presented an example  worthy of imitation in any age.          CHAPTER XVI.    THE VISIT OF THE KING.--PIGAFETTA VISITS THE KING.      They were ready to meet the King now, when all was so friendly and  promising. The good soul of Pigafetta felt that these islands of fruits  and spiceries were indeed an earthly paradise. He alone had not been  sick in all of the long monotonous voyage across the Pacific. His  strength had never abated and his faith in the Admiral had never  faltered.    Night after night he had watched the lantern swinging in the unknown  air, and had said his prayers. He had had ever a cheering word to say to  the Admiral on all occasions. His heart was true to the lantern, the  stars, the Admiral, and the Divine Power which he believed was leading  him.    He was now in the sea gardens of palms and spices. He thus continues his  narrative (we follow in part the translation of the Hakluyt Society in  the work of Lord Stanley Alderley).    He tells us that on \"the next day, which was Good Friday, the Captain  sent on shore a slave, who was an interpreter, to the King to beg him to  give him for money some provisions for his ships, sending him word that  he had not come to his country as an enemy, but as a friend. The King on  hearing this came with seven or eight men in a boat, and entered the  ship, and embraced the Captain, and gave him three China dishes covered  with leaves full of rice, and two _dorades_, which are rather large  fish. The Captain gave this King a robe of red and yellow cloth, made in  the Turkish fashion, and a very fine red cap, and to his people he gave  knives and mirrors. After that refreshments were served up to them. The  Captain told the King, through the interpreter, that he wished to be  with him, as _cassi cassi_; that is to say, brothers. To which the King  answered that he desired to be the same toward him. After that the  Captain showed him cloths of different colors, linen, coral, and much  other merchandise, and all the artillery, of which he had some pieces  fired before him, at which the King was much astonished; after that the  Captain had one of his soldiers armed with white armor, and placed him  in the midst of three comrades, who struck him with swords and daggers.    \"The King thought this very strange, and the Captain told him, through  the interpreter, that a man thus in white armor was worth many common  men; he answered that it was true; he was further informed that there  were in each ship two hundred like that man.    \"After that the Captain showed him a great number of swords, cuirasses,  and helmets, and made two of the men play with their swords before the  King; he then showed him the sea chart and the ship compass, and  informed him how he had found a strait, and of the time which he had  spent on the voyage; also of the time he had been without seeing any  land, at which the King was astonished. At the end the Captain asked if  he would be pleased that two of his people should go with him to the  places where they lived to see some of the things of his country. This  the King granted, and I went with another.\"    The Italian was again in his element, and he gives a graphic account of  his visit to the natives:    \"When I had landed, the King raised his hands to the sky, and turned to  us two, and we did the same as he did; after that he took me by the  hand, and one of his principal people took my companion, and led us  under a place covered with canes, where there was a ballanghai; that is  to say, a boat, eighty feet long or thereabouts, resembling a fusta. We  sat with the King upon its stern, always conversing with him by signs,  and his people stood up around us, with their swords, spears, and  bucklers. Then the King ordered to be brought a dish of pig's flesh and  wine. Their fashion of drinking is in this wise: they first raise their  hands to Heaven, then take the drinking vessel in their right hand, and  extend the left hand closed toward the people. This the King did, and  presented to me his fist, so that I thought that he wanted to strike me;  I did the same thing toward him; so with this ceremony, and other signs  of friendship, we banqueted, and afterward supped with him.\"    The Italian was a pious man, but he says:    \"I ate flesh on Good Friday, not being able to do otherwise, and before  the hour of supper, I gave several things to the King, which I had  brought. There I wrote down several things as they name them in their  language, and when the King and the others saw me write, and I told them  their manner of speech, they were all astonished.    \"When the hour for supper had come, they brought two large China dishes,  one of which was full of rice, and the other of pig's flesh, with its  broth and sauce. We supped with the same signs and ceremonies, and then  went to the King's palace, which was made and built like a hay grange,  covered with fig and palm leaves.\"    Here the two found delightful hospitality; the house was \"built on great  timbers high above the ground, and it was necessary to go up steps and  ladders to it. Then the King made us sit on a cane mat, with our legs  doubled as was the custom; after half an hour there was brought a dish  of fish roast in pieces, and ginger fresh gathered that moment and some  wine. The eldest son of the King, who was a Prince, came where we were,  and the King told him to sit down near us, which he did; then two dishes  were brought, one of fish, with its sauce, and the other of rice, and  this was done for us to eat with the Prince. My companion enjoyed the  food and drank so much that he got drunk. They use for candles or  torches the gum of a tree which is named anime, wrapped up in leaves of  palms or fig trees. The King made a sign that he wished to go to rest,  and left us with the Prince, with whom we slept on a cane mat, with some  cushions and pillows of leaves. Next morning the King came and took me  by the hand, and so we went to the place where we had supped, to  breakfast, but the boat came to fetch us. The King,"]]]
