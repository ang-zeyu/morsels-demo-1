See my notes on the Manx cat. Mr. Young had also  noted this peculiarity in \"the Royal cat of Siam.\"    Mrs. Vyvyan further remarks:    \"They are very affectionate and personally attached to their human  friends, not liking to be left alone, and following us from room to room  more after the manner of dogs than cats.    \"They are devoted parents, the old father taking the greatest interest  in the young ones.    \"They are friendly with the dogs of the house, occupying the same  baskets; but the males are very strong, and fight with great persistency  with strange dogs, and conquer all other tom-cats in their  neighbourhood. We lost one, however, a very fine cat, in China in this  way, as he returned to the house almost torn to pieces and in a dying  condition, from an encounter with some animal which we think was one of  the wild cats of the hills.    \"We feed them on fresh fish boiled with rice, until the two are nearly  amalgamated; they also take bread and milk _warm_, the milk having been  boiled, and this diet seems to suit them better than any other. They  also like chicken and game. We have proved the fish diet is not  essential, as two of our cats (in Cornwall) never get it.    \"Rather a free life seems necessary to their perfect acclimatisation,  where they can go out and provide themselves with raw animal food,  'feather and fur.'    \"We find these cats require a great deal of care, unless they live in  the country, and become hardy through being constantly out of doors. The  kittens are difficult to rear unless they are born late in the spring,  thus having the warm weather before them. Most deaths occur before they  are six months old.    \"We have lost several kittens from worms, which they endeavour to vomit;  as relief we give them raw chicken heads, with _the feathers on_, with  success. We also give cod-liver oil, if the appetite fails and weight  diminishes.    \"When first born the colour is nearly pure white, the only trace of  'points' being a fine line of dark gray at the edge of the ears; a  gradual alteration takes place, the body becoming creamy, the ears,  face, tail, and feet darkening, until, about a year old, they attain  perfection, when the points should be the deepest brown, nearly black,  and the body ash or fawn colour, eyes opal or blue, looking red in the  dark. After maturity they are apt to darken considerably, though not in  all specimens.    \"They are most interesting and delightful pets. But owing to their  delicacy and the great care they require, no one, unless a real cat  _lover_, should attempt to keep them; they cannot with safety to their  health be treated as common cats.    \"During 'Susan's' (one of the cats) illness, the old he-cat came daily  to condole with her, bringing delicate 'attentions' in the form of  freshly-caught mice. 'Loquat' also provided this for a young family for  whom she had no milk.    \"Another, 'Saiwan,' is very clever at undoing the latch of the window in  order to let himself out; tying it up with string is of no use, and he  has even managed to untwist wire that has been used to prevent his going  out in the snow. We have at present two males, four adult females, and  five kittens.\" One of our kittens sent to Scotland last August, has done  well.    Mrs. Lee, of Penshurst, also has some fine specimens of the breed, and  of the same colours as described. I take it, therefore, that the true  breed, by consensus of opinion, is that of the dun, fawn, or  ash-coloured ground, with black points. Other colours should be shown in  the variety classes.    The head should be long from the ears to the eyes, and not over broad,  and then rather sharply taper off towards the muzzle, the forehead flat,  and receding, the eyes somewhat aslant downwards towards the nose, and  the eyes of a pearly, yet bright blue colour, the ears usual size and  black, with little or no hair on the inside, with black muzzle, and  round the eyes black. The form should be slight, graceful, and  delicately made, body long, tail rather short and thin, and the legs  somewhat short, slender, and the feet oval, not so round as the ordinary  English cat. The body should be one bright, uniform, even colour, not  clouded, either rich fawn, dun, or ash. The legs, feet, and tail black.  The back slightly darker is allowable, if of a rich colour, and the  colour softened, _not clouded_.    [Illustration: PROPERLY MARKED SIAMESE CAT.]      [Illustration]          THE MANX CAT.      The Manx cat is well known, and is by no means uncommon. It differs  chiefly from the ordinary domestic cat in being tailless, or nearly so,  the best breeds not having any; the hind legs are thicker and rather  longer, particularly in the thighs. It runs more like a hare than a cat,  the action of the legs being awkward, nor does it seem to turn itself so  readily, or with such rapidity and ease; the head is somewhat small for  its size, yet thick and well set on a rather long neck; the eyes large,  round, and full, ears medium, and rather rounded at the apex. In colour  they vary, but I do not remember to have seen a white or many black,  though one of the best that has come under my notice was the latter  colour. I have examined a number of specimens sent for exhibition at the  Crystal Palace and other cat shows, and found in some a very short,  thin, twisted tail, in others a mere excrescence, and some with an  appendage more like a knob. These I have taken as having been operated  upon when young, the tail being removed, but this may not be the case,  as Mr. St. George Mivart in his very valuable book on the cat, mentions  a case where a female cat had her tail so injured by the passage of a  cart-wheel over it, that her master judged it best to have it cut off  near the base. Since then she has had two litters of kittens, and in  each litter one or more of the kittens had a _stump of tail_, while  their brothers and sisters had tails of the usual length. But were there  no Manx cats in the neighbourhood, is a query. This case is analogous to  the statement that the short-tailed sheep-dog was produced from parents  that had had their tails amputated; and yet this is now an established  breed. Also a small black breed of dogs from the Netherlands, which is  now very fashionable. They are called \"Chipperkes,\" and have no tails,  at least when exhibited. Mr. St. George Mivart further states that Mr.  Bartlett told him, as he has so stated to myself, that in the Isle of  Man the cats have tails of different lengths, from nothing up to ten  inches. I have also been informed on good authority that the Fox Terrier  dogs, which invariably have (as a matter of fashion) their tails cut  short, sometimes have puppies with much shorter tails than the original  breed; but this does not appear to take effect on sheep, whose tails are  generally cut off. I cannot, myself, come to the same conclusion as to  the origin of the Manx cat. Be this as it may, one thing is certain:  that cross-bred Manx with other cats often have young that are tailless.  As a proof of this, Mr. Herbert Young, of Harrogate, has had in his  possession a very fine red female long-haired tailless cat, that was  bred between the Manx and a Persian. Another case showing the strong  prepotency of the Manx cat. Mr. Hodgkin, of Eridge, some time ago had a  female Manx cat sent to him. Not only does she produce tailless cats  when crossed with the ordinary cat, but the progeny again crossed also  frequently have some tailless kittens in each litter. I have also been  told there is a breed of tailless cats in Cornwall. Mr. Darwin states in  his book on \"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,\"  vol. i. p. 47, that \"throughout an immense area, namely, the Malayan  Archipelago, Siam, Pequan, and Burmah, all the cats have truncated tails  about half the proper length, often with a sort of knob at the end.\"  This description tallies somewhat with the appearance of some of the  Siamese cats that have been imported, several of which, though they have  fairly long and thin tails, and though they are much pointed at the end,  often have a break or kink. In a note Mr. Darwin says, \"The Madagascar  cat is said to have a twisted tail.\" (See Desmares, in Encyclop. Nat.  Mamm., 1820, p. 233, for some other breeds.) Mr. St. George Mivart also  corroborates the statement, so far as the Malay cat is concerned. He  says the tail is only half the ordinary length, and often contorted into  a sort of knot, so that it cannot be straightened. He further states,  \"Its contortion is due to deformity of the bones of the tail,\" and there  is a tailless breed of cats in the Crimea. Some of the Manx cats I have  examined have precisely the kind of tail here described--thin, very  short, and twisted, that cannot be straightened. Is it possible that the  Manx cat originated from the Malayan? Or rather is it a freak of nature  perpetuated by selection? Be this as it may, we have the Manx cat now as  a distinct breed, and, when crossed with others, will almost always  produce some entirely tailless kittens, if not all. Many of the Siamese  kittens bred here have kinks in their tails.    The illustration I give is that of a prize winner at the Crystal Palace  in 1880, 1881, 1882, and is the property of Mr. J. M. Thomas, of  Parliament Street. In colour it is a brindled tortoiseshell. It is eight  years old. At the end of this description I also give a portrait of one  of its kittens, a tabby; both are true Manx, and neither have a particle  of tail, only a very small tuft of hair which is boneless. The hind  quarters are very square and deep, as contrasted with other cats, and  the flank deeper, giving an appearance of great strength, the hind legs  being longer, and thicker in proportion to the fore legs, which are much  slighter and tapering; even the toes are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35470"],[0,"Key to the Science of Theology (#14)"],[1,"a sinful course of life; must deny himself  of every impure or unlawful indulgence; must do right with his fellow  creatures, and determine to keep the commandments of Jesus Christ.    With these qualifications he comes to the Apostle, Elder, or Priest of  the Church of the Saints, who, after a covenant on the part of the  candidate to forsake his sins, and keep the commandments of Jesus  Christ, goes down into the water with him, and there buries him, in  the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, for remission of sins,  and then raises him from his watery grave.    This ordinance is to represent the death, burial and resurrection of  Jesus Christ, and is called Baptism.    Having passed through this ordinance, the hands of some one, or more,  of the authorised Priesthood, are next laid upon the head of the  candidate, in the same sacred names, and the gift of the Holy Spirit  is confirmed upon him. This baptism of water and of the Spirit is  called a new birth; and it is in reality a repetition of the natural  birth, or entrance into the elements of a new existence.    To realise this, the student must be indoctrinated in the philosophy  of his natural birth, which involves three principles; viz.--\"_The  spirit, the water and the blood_.\"    The embryo formation of the human body, is commenced and sustained by  blood and spirit, in the womb of nature, where, until the period of  birth, it floats in the element of water. At birth, then, it is  literally born of water, that is, it emerges from that element in  which it has been so long immersed, into a different element, called  the atmosphere, which then becomes a necessary element of existence.    To be born again, then, is to enter into the same element, suspend the  breath in the watery womb, and emerge from that element into the  atmosphere, and again gasp the first breath in the new creation;  while, at the same time, the blood of Atonement is applied to the  individual, for remission of sins, and is followed by the outpouring  of the Holy Spirit of promise. As it is written--\"_There are three  that bear record on the earth; the spirit, the water, and the blood_.\"    The things of this visible creation, are the patterns of things in the  invisible world; and are so arranged as to exactly correspond--the one  answering to the other, as face to face in a mirror.    The immersion in water, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy  Spirit, for remission of sins; and the baptism of the Holy Spirit,  which follows according to promise, by the laying on of the hands of  the holy Priesthood; were instituted from before the foundation of the  world, as a pattern of the birth, death, resurrection and new life of  man.    The candidate is now initiated into the first principles of the  science of Divine Theology. His mind is quickened, his intellectual  faculties are aroused to intense activity. He is, as it were,  illuminated. He learns more of divine truth in a few days, than he  could have learned in a life time in the best merely human  institutions in the world.    His affections are also purified, exalted, and increased in  proportion. He loves his heavenly Father, and Jesus Christ, with a  perfect love. He also loves the members of the Church, or the body of  Christ, as he loves his own soul; while his bosom swells with the  tenderest sympathies, and emotions of good will and benevolence, for  all mankind. He would make any sacrifice which might be expedient, to  do good. He would lay down his life most cheerfully, without one  moment's hesitation, or regret, if required of him by the cause of  truth.    He also feels the spirit of prayer and watchfulness continually, and  pours out his soul in the same, and finds he is answered in all things  which are expedient. He is now in a fit capacity to exercise some one  or more of the spiritual gifts.    He may perhaps speak in power, in the word of wisdom, in the word of  knowledge, in prophecy, or in other tongues. He may see a vision,  dream an inspired dream, or possess the gift to be healed, or to heal  others, by the laying on of hands in the name of Jesus Christ.    To impart a portion of the Holy Spirit by the touch, or by the laying  on of hands; or to impart a portion of the element of life, from one  animal body to another, by an authorized agent who acts in the name of  God, and who is filled therewith, is as much in accordance with the  laws of nature, as for water to seek its own level; air, its  equilibrium; or heat, and electricity, their own mediums of  conveyance.    This law of spiritual fluid, its communicative properties, and the  channel by which it is imparted from one person to another, bear some  resemblance, or analogy, to the laws and operations of electricity.  Like electricity, it is imparted by the contact of two bodies, through  the channel of the nerves.    But the two fluids differ very widely. The one is a property nearly  allied to the grosser elements of matter; not extensively endowed with  the attributes of intelligence, wisdom, affection, or moral  discrimination. It can therefore be imparted from one animal body to  another, irrespective of the intellectual or moral qualities of the  subject or recipient. The other is a substance endowed with the  attributes of intelligence, affection, moral discrimination, love,  charity, and benevolence pure as the emotions which swell the bosom,  thrill the nerves, or vibrate the pulse of the Father of all.    An agent filled with this heavenly fluid cannot impart of the same to  another, unless that other is justified, washed, cleansed from all his  impurities of heart, affections, habits or practices, by the blood of  atonement, which is generally applied in connexion with the baptism of  remission.    A man who continues in his sins, and who has no living faith in the  Son of God, cannot receive the gift of the Holy Spirit through the  ministration of any agent, however holy he may be. The impure spirit  of such a one will repulse the pure element, upon the natural laws of  sympathetic affinity, or of attraction and repulsion.    An intelligent being, in the image of God, possesses every organ,  attribute, sense, sympathy, affection, of will, wisdom, love, power  and gift, which is possessed by God Himself.    But these are possessed by man, in his rudimental state, in a  subordinate sense of the word. Or, in other words, these attributes  are in embryo; and are to be gradually developed. They resemble a  bud--a germ, which gradually developes into bloom, and then, by  progress, produces the mature fruit, after its own kind.    The gift of the Holy Spirit adapts itself to all these organs or  attributes. It quickens all the intellectual faculties, increases,  enlarges, expands and purifies all the natural passions and  affections; and adapts them, by the gift of wisdom, to their lawful  use. It inspires, developes, cultivates and matures all the fine toned  sympathies, joys, tastes, kindred feelings and affections of our  nature. It inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness  and charity. It developes beauty of person, form and features. It  tends to health, vigour, animation and social feeling. It developes  and invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual  man. It strengthens, invigorates, and gives tone to the nerves. In  short, it is, as it were, marrow to the bone, joy to the heart, light  to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole being.    In the presence of such persons, one feels to enjoy the light of their  countenances, as the genial rays of a sunbeam. Their very atmosphere  diffuses a thrill, a warm glow of pure gladness and sympathy, to the  heart and nerves of others who have kindred feelings, er sympathy of  spirit. No matter if the parties are strangers, entirely unknown to  each other in person or character; no matter if they have never spoken  to each other, each will be apt to remark in his own mind, and perhaps  exclaim, when referring to the interview--\"O what an atmosphere  encircles that stranger! How my heart thrilled with pure and holy  feelings in his presence! What confidence and sympathy he inspired!  His countenance and spirit gave me more assurance, than a thousand  written recommendations, or introductory letters.\" Such is the gift of  the Holy Spirit, and such are its operations, when received through  the lawful channel--the divine, eternal Priesthood.          CHAPTER XI.    PHILOSOPHY OF MIRACLES.          Trembling with awe and fear, the mind inquires--      \"What master spirit, now, the bard inspires;      What bold philosophy shall dare assign      A law to govern miracles divine--      Tell how effects transpire without a cause,      And how kind nature breaks kind nature's laws?\"    Among the popular errors of modern times, an opinion prevails that  miracles are events which transpire contrary to the laws of nature,  that they are effects without a cause.    If such is the fact, then, there never has been a miracle, and there  never will be one. The laws of nature are the laws of _truth_. Truth  is unchangeable, and independent in its own sphere. A law of nature  never has been broken. And it is an absolute impossibility that such  law ever should be broken.    That which, at first sight, appears to be contrary to the known laws  of nature, will always be found, on investigation, to be in perfect  accordance with those laws. For instance, had a sailor of the last  century been running before the wind, and met with a vessel running at  a good rate of speed, directly in opposition to the wind and current,  this sight would have presented, to his understanding, a miracle in  the highest possible sense of the term, that is, an event entirely  contrary to the laws of nature, as known to him. Or if a train of  cars, loaded with hundreds of passengers, or scores of tons of  freight, had been seen passing over the surface of the earth, at the  rate of"]]]
