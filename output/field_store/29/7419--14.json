When he gets you there, he will tear this skin off  you. You must then drive him away and push down the precious stones  you will find there. When they are all down, I will get you down.\"    \"'So he put me in the skin; the bird carried me to the top of the  mountain and was about to eat me, when I jumped up, scared him away,  and then pushed down many precious stones. Then I called out to the  man to take me down, but he never answered me, and went away.    \"'I gave myself up for a dead man, but went wandering about, until at  last, after passing many days in a great forest, I came to a house,  all by itself; the old man who lived in it gave me food and drink,  and I was revived.    \"'I remained there a long time, and that old man loved me as if I  were his own son.    \"'One day he went away, and giving me the keys, told me I could open  the door of every room except one which he pointed out to me.    \"'Of course, when he was gone, this was the first door I opened. I  saw a large garden, through which a stream flowed. Just then three  birds came and alighted by the side of the stream. Immediately they  changed to three most beautiful women. When they had finished bathing,  they put on their clothes, and, as I stood watching them, they changed  into birds again and flew away.    \"'I locked the door, and went away; but my appetite was gone, and I  wandered about aimlessly. When the old man came back, he saw there  was something wrong with me, and asked me what was the matter. Then  I told him I had seen those beautiful maidens, that I loved one of  them very much, and that if I could not marry her I should die.    \"'The old man told me I could not possibly have my wish. He said the  three lovely beings were the daughters of the sultan of the genii, and  that their home was a journey of three years from where we then were.    \"'I told him I couldn't help that. He must get her for my wife, or I  should die. At last he said, \"Well, wait till they come again, then  hide yourself and steal the clothes of the one you love so dearly.\"    \"'So I waited, and when they came again I stole the clothes of the  youngest, whose name was Sayadaa'tee Shems.    \"'When they came out of the water, this one could not find her  clothes. Then I stepped forward and said, \"I have them.\" \"Ah,\" she  begged, \"give them to me, their owner; I want to go away.\" But I said  to her, \"I love you very much. I want to marry you.\" \"I want to go  to my father,\" she replied. \"You cannot go,\" said I.    \"'Then her sisters flew away, and I took her into the house, where the  old man married us. He told me not to give her those clothes I had  taken, but to hide them; because if she ever got them she would fly  away to her old home. So I dug a hole in the ground and buried them.    \"'But one day, when I was away from home, she dug them up and put  them on; then, saying to the slave I had given her for an attendant,  \"When your master returns tell him I have gone home; if he really  loves me he will follow me,\" she flew away.    \"'When I came home they told me this, and I wandered, searching for  her, many years. At last I came to a town where one asked me, \"Who  are you?\" and I answered, \"I am Jan Shah.\" \"What was your father's  name?\" \"Taaeeghamus.\" \"Are you the man who married our mistress?\" \"Who  is your mistress?\" \"Sayadaatee Shems.\" \"I am he!\" I cried with delight.    \"'They took me to their mistress, and she brought me to her father  and told him I was her husband; and everybody was happy.    \"'Then we thought we should like to visit our old home, and her  father's genii carried us there in three days. We stayed there a  year and then returned, but in a short time my wife died. Her father  tried to comfort me, and wanted me to marry another of his daughters,  but I refused to be comforted, and have mourned to this day. That is  my story.'    \"Then Bolookeea went on his way, and wandered till he died.\"    Next Sultaanee Waa Neeoka said to Hasseeboo, \"Now, when you go home  you will do me injury.\"    Hasseeboo was very indignant at the idea, and said, \"I could not be  induced to do you an injury. Pray, send me home.\"    \"I will send you home,\" said the king; \"but I am sure that you will  come back and kill me.\"    \"Why, I dare not be so ungrateful,\" exclaimed Hasseeboo. \"I swear I  could not hurt you.\"    \"Well,\" said the king of the snakes, \"bear this in mind: when you go  home, do not go to bathe where there are many people.\"    And he said, \"I will remember.\" So the king sent him home, and he  went to his mother's house, and she was overjoyed to find that he  was not dead.    Now, the sultan of the town was very sick; and it was decided that  the only thing that could cure him would be to kill the king of the  snakes, boil him, and give the soup to the sultan.    For a reason known only to himself, the vizir had placed men at the  public baths with this instruction: \"If any one who comes to bathe  here has a mark on his stomach, seize him and bring him to me.\"    When Hasseeboo had been home three days he forgot the warning of  Sultaanee Waa Neeoka, and went to bathe with the other people. All of  a sudden he was seized by some soldiers, and brought before the vizir,  who said, \"Take us to the home of the king of the snakes.\"    \"I don't know where it is,\" said Hasseeboo.    \"Tie him up,\" commanded the vizir.    So they tied him up and beat him until his back was all raw, and being  unable to stand the pain he cried, \"Let up! I will show you the place.\"    So he led them to the house of the king of the snakes, who, when he  saw him, said, \"Didn't I tell you you would come back to kill me?\"    \"How could I help it?\" cried Hasseeboo. \"Look at my back!\"    \"Who has beaten you so dreadfully?\" asked the king.    \"The vizir.\"    \"Then there's no hope for me. But you must carry me yourself.\"    As they went along, the king said to Hasseeboo, \"When we get to your  town I shall be killed and cooked. The first skimming the vizir will  offer to you, but don't you drink it; put it in a bottle and keep  it. The second skimming you must drink, and you will become a great  physician. The third skimming is the medicine that will cure your  sultan. When the vizir asks you if you drank that first skimming say,  'I did.' Then produce the bottle containing the first, and say, 'This  is the second, and it is for you.' The vizir will take it, and as soon  as he drinks it he will die, and both of us will have our revenge.\"    Everything happened as the king had said. The vizir died, the sultan  recovered, and Hasseeboo was loved by all as a great physician."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3751"],[0,"The Psychology of Beauty (#14)"],[1," themselves again to give the sensations of black,  green, and blue.  The dissimilating process seems to bring  about stronger reactions on the physiological side, as if it  were a more exciting process.  Thus it is found<1> that as  measured by the increase in strength of the hand grip under  the stimulation of the respective colors, red has particularly  exciting qualities, but the other colors have an analogous  effect, lessening, however, with the descent from red to  violet.  The pleasure in bright red, or yellow, for instance,  may thus well be the feeling-tone arising in the purely  physiological effect of the color.  If red works like a trumpet  call, while blue calms and cools, and if red is preferred to  blue, it is because a sharp stimulation is so felt, and so  preferred.    <1> Ch. Fere, _Sensation et Mouvement_, 1887, p. 80.    The question of the demands of the eye in color combination is  still more complicated.  It has been traditional to consider  the complementaries black-white, red-green, blue-yellow, and  the other pairs resulting from the mixtures of these as the  best combinations.  The physiological explanation is of course  found in the relief and refreshment to the organs in successive  alternation of the processes of assimilation and dissimilation,  and objectively in the reinforcement, through this stronger  functioning of the retina, of the complementary colors  themselves.  This tendency to mutual aid is shown in the  familiar experiment of fixating for some moments a colored  object, say red, and then transferring the gaze to a white or  gray expanse.  The image of the object appears thereon in the  complementary green.  Per contra, the most complete lack of  contrast makes the most unpleasing combination, because instead  of a refreshing alternation of processes in the retina, a  fatiguing repetition results.  Red and orange (red-yellow), or  red and purple (red-blue), successively stimulate the red-  process with most evil effect.    This contrast theory should, however, not be interpreted too  narrowly.  There are pairs of so-called complementaries which  make a very crude, harsh, even painful impression.  The theory  is happily supplemented by showing<1> that the ideal combination  involves all three contrast factors, hue, saturation, and  brightness.  Contrast of saturation or brightness within the  same hue is also pleasant.  For any two qualities of the color  circle, in fact, there can be found degrees of saturation and  brightness in which they will form an agreeable combination,  and this pleasing effect will be based on some form of contrast.  But the absolute and relative extension and the space-form of  the components have also a great influence on the pleasurableness  of combinations.    <1> A. Kirschmann, \"Die psychol.-aesthet. Bedeutung des Licht  und Farbencontrastes,\" _Philos. Studien_, vol. vii.    Further rules can hardly be given; but the results of various  observers<1> seem to show that the best combinations lie, as  already said, among the complementaries, or among those pairs  nearer together in the color circle than complementaries, which  are \"warmer.\"  The reason for this last is that, in Chevreul's  phraseology, combinations of cold colors change each other's  peculiar hue the most, and of warm colors the least; because  the complementaries of these cold colors are \"warm,\" i.e.  bright, and each, appearing on the field of the neighboring  cold color, seems to fade it out; while the complementaries  of the juxtaposed warm colors are not bright, and do not have  sufficient strength to affect their neighbors at all.  With a  combination of blue and green for instance, a yellow shade  would appear in the green and a red in the blue.  Such a  result fails to satisfy the demand, already touched on, for  purity and homogeneity of color,--that is, for unimpeded seeing  of color.    <1> Chevreul, _De la Loi du Contraste Simultane des Couleurs_.  E.S. Banker, op. Cit.    What significance have these abstract principles of beauty in  the combination of colors for representative art?  In the  choice of objects with a definite local color, of course, these  laws will be found operative.  A scheme of blues and yellows  is likely to be more effective than one of reds and violets.  If we analyze the masterpiece of coloring, we shall find that  what we at first supposed to be the wonderful single effects of  color is really the result of juxtapositions which bring out  each color to its highest power.      III    While all this may be true, however, the most important question  has not yet been asked.  Is truth of color in representative art  the same thing as beauty of color?  It might be said that the  whole procedure of the so-called Impressionist school, in fact  the whole trend of the modern treatment of color, took their  identity for granted.  Yet we must discriminate.  Truth of color  may be truth to the local color of the given objects, alone or  together; in this case we should have to say that beauty did or  did not exist in the picture, according as it did or did not  exist in the original combination.  A red hat on a purple chair  would set one's teeth on edge, in model or picture.  Secondly,  truth of color may be truth to the modifications of the  enveloping light, and in this case truth would make for beauty.  For the colors of any given scene are in general not colors  which the objects themselves, if isolated, would have, but the  colors which the eye itself is forced to see.  The bluish  shadow of an object in bright sunlight (yellowish light) is only  an expression of the law that in the neighborhood of a colored  object we see its complementary color.  If such an effect is  reproduced in a picture, it gives the same relief to the eye  which the original effect showed the need of.  The eye fatigued  with yellow sees blue; so if the blue is really supplied in the  picture, it is not only true, but on the road to beauty, because  meting the eye's demand.  The older methods of painting gave the  local color of an object, with an admixture of white for the  lights, and a warm dark for the shadows; the modern--which had  been touched on, indeed, sporadically, by Perugino and Vermeer,  for instance,--gives in the shadow the complementary color of  the object combined with that of the light falling upon it--all  conditions of favorable stimulation.    Further favorable stimulation of the eye is given in the method  of the Impressionists in treating \"values,\" that is, comparative  relations of light and shade.  The real tones of objects  including the sky, light, etc., can never be reproduced.  The  older schools, conscious of this, were satisfied to paint in a  scale of correspondence, in which the relative values were  fairly kept.  But even by that means, the great differences of  intensity could not be given, for the brightest spot of any  painting is never more than sixty-six times brighter than the  darkest, while the gray sky on a dull rainy day is four hundred  and twenty times brighter than a white painted cross-bar of a  window seen against the sky as background.<1>  There were  various ways of combating this difficulty.  Rembrandt, for  instance, as Kirschmann tells us, chose the sombre brown tone,  \"not out of caprice or an inclination for mystic dreaming  (Fromentin), but because the yellow and orange side of the  color-manifold admits of the greatest number of intervals  between full saturation and the darkest shade.\"  The precursors  of the Impressionists, on the other hand, succeeded in painting  absolute values, confining themselves to a very limited gamut;  for this reason the first landscapes of the school were all  gray-green, dull, cloudy.  But Monet did not stop there.  He  painted the ABSOLUTE VALUES of objects IN SHADE on a sunny day,  which of course demands the brightest possibilities of the  palette, and got the lighted objects themselves as nearly as  he could,--thus destroying the relative values, but getting an  extraordinary joyous and glowing effect; and one, too, of  unexpected verisimilitude, for it would seem that in a sunlit  scene we are really attentive to the shaded objects alone, and  what becomes of the others does not so much matter.  This effect  was made still more possible by the so-called dissociation of  colors,--i.e. the juxtaposing of tints, the blending of which  by the eye gives the desired color, without the loss of  brightness which a mixing of pigments would involve.  Thus by  putting touches of black and white side by side, for instance,  a gray results much brighter than could have been otherwise  reached by mixing; or blue and red spots are blended by the  eye to an extraordinarily vivid purple.  Thus, by these  methods, using the truth of color in the sense of following  the nature of retinal functioning, Monet and his followers  raised the color scale many degrees in brightness.  Now we  have seen that the eye loves light, warmth, strong color-effects,  related to each other in the way that the eye must see them.  Impressionism, as the name of the method just described, makes  it more possible than it had been before to meet the demands  of the eye for light and color, to recover \"the innocence of  the eye,\" in Ruskin's phrase.  Truth to the local color of  objects is relatively indifferent, unless that color is  beautiful in itself; truth to the reciprocal relations and  changes of hue is beauty, because it allows for the eye's own  adaptations of its surroundings in the interest of its own  functioning.  Thus in this case, and to sum up, truth is  synonymous with beauty, in so far as beauty is constituted by  favorable stimulation of an organ.  The further question, how  far this vivid treatment of light is of importance for the  realization of depth and distance, is not here entered on.    <1> Kirschmann, _Univ. of Toronto Studies, Psychol.
