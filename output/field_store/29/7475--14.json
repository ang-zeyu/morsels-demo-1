In the most casual way the  author reveals his impressionable and poetic nature. They are not  profound or epoch-making thoughts. They are merely the thoughts of a  sane, healthy, artistic mind bathing and refreshing itself in the  beauties of nature and contrasting them with the ugliness of most of  man's handiwork.    Then came two books about the outgrowth of the military life. \"Kubilek\"  is named after a hill on the Bainsizza Tableland where the author fought  and was wounded. It gives a picture of the Italian as a soul which will  be recognized as true to life by every one who has had to do with him.  No one can read it without feeling an admiration and an affection for  that extraordinarily loyal being the Italian soldier who tolerates  hardship with equanimity and without complaint and who is so  appreciative of anything done for his comfort or welfare. \"La Ritirata  del Friuli\" (\"The Retreat from Friuli\") is not up to the author's  standard.    The next book, a very small one, \"La Giostra dei Sensi\" (\"The Joust of  the Senses\"), is a portrayal of the capacity shown by a \"lost soul\" for  radiating unselfish love upon an individual who comes to her for  meretricious contact but who stays to add to his spiritual stature. The  scene is laid in Naples and the author utilizes the sheer beauty of the  place and picturesqueness of the people to give an artistic setting for  the description of the jousts. It could not possibly be published in  England unless the publisher aspired to \"languish\" in prison.    Of the many questions I have asked in Italy none has been so  unsatisfactorily answered as \"Do you let your young folk read that book  and what effect does it have?\" No one could think of calling Soffici a  pornographic writer. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that he is one  of the most respected and admired of all the young school of Italian  writers, and yet there are passages in the book now under discussion  coarser and more vulgar than any in the \"Satyricon.\" Despite this it is  not a circumstance to the recent book of a seventeen-year-old girl of  Rome, Margherita Emplosi Gherardi, entitled \"Il Nudo nelle Anime.\" It is  dedicated to all those who deny that the youthful mind has not the  capacity, discernment, liberty, and daring to envisage and interpret the  painful mysteries of the human soul. There are few things more  disgusting in literature, \"Gamiana\" excluded, than the sketch entitled  \"The Impure Hour,\" for women only.    His remaining books, \"Statue e Fantocci\" (\"Statues and Dolls\"), are made  up chiefly of critical reviews, many of which have appeared in journals.  They show that the writer has a mastery of literary technic and an  understanding of modern art and literature creditable to himself and to  his country. He can be satirical, caustic, sarcastic, but he is never  brutal. He can be an ardent admirer, a valorous champion, a sympathetic  interpreter, a critical friend, and a prejudiced judge, but he is never  an implacable, insensate enemy, nor a literary fiend. Moreover, one does  not gather from his writings that he is what is called the \"whole thing\"  from the literary standpoint.    Signor Soffici has got some bad habits from Papini. Among these are:  saying old things as if they never had been said before; taking on an  air of complacency after the delivery of a sentiment or a conviction in  no wise epoch-making; believing that all his geese are swans and the  geese of others decoys; that his every thought is a jewel which people  are frenzied to possess unless they are too stupid; and saying trivial  things with the subtly conveyed insinuation that the reader should, if  he is perspicacious and cultured, find a deep significance in them.    He is yet a long way from his full stature, but he is growing.    Aldo Palazzeschi (1885-) is one of the youngest of the Futuristic group  who has gained enduring fame as a poet. His first volume of verses,  \"Cavalli Bianchi\" (\"White Horses\"), which was published when he was  twenty years old, showed him to be a youth of sensibility and  originality, with capacity for tuneful verse and for dainty sentiment  daintily expressed. The publication of a second volume, entitled  \"Lanterna\" (\"The Lantern\"), two years later, fully justified the  expectations of those who were attracted by the little gems of his early  verse. But it was not until 1909, on the publication of a volume  entitled \"The Poems of Aldo Palazzeschi,\" that it was realized that  there had come upon the scene a poet who might quite easily get a fame  equal to that of Carducci or Pascoli.    His poems not only showed the influence of Apollinaire and Marinetti,  but also of Whitman, of Mallarme, of Rimbaud, of Laforgue, and of other  French writers. The dyed-in-the-wool critics saw in much of his work  clownishness and infantilism, especially in such productions as \"E  lasciatemi divertire.\" They thought it should be construed: \"And let me  divert myself with insane-asylum poetry.\" They were quite right from  their standpoint, but a fellow poet whose emotional mechanism is not so  equilibrated as that of the sort of man called normal, would be likely  to see in it something of beauty and of merit which the latter could not  see, and ask: \"Why should not the poet divert himself?\" It is to him  what exercise is to the average man, and he speaks of it, in fact is  proud of it, just as the average man is proud of his golf score when he  gets it in that Elysian field, \"under ninety.\"    Those who do not see in Palazzeschi's poetry an adhesion to a certain  school of philosophy, an advocacy of certain ethical systems, a  restatement of others' thoughts and teachings, miss the very essence of  his contribution. This is his capacity to present the world around us in  colors which, if not new, at least have been recognized only since the  advent of the impressionistic painter. So illuminated, it presents  facets of beauty that make appeal to that which within us mediates and  interprets pleasure.    In addition to this, he has an extraordinary sense of the fantastic, the  grotesque, the panoplied. His eye is microscopic and his mind is  telescopic, and his soul waves tend to a rhythm which is akin to that of  genius when he reveals them and describes them to others, as he does,  for instance, in the \"Villa Celeste\" (\"The Celestial House\"); the  average man (who is attuned to interpret some poetic waves) realizes  that the soul of this young man is the generating station of genuine  poetical energy. He puts a reflector before his soul and it reflects the  waves in our direction.        \"Io metto una lente      dinanzi al mio cuore,      per farlo vedere alla gente.\"    Among the youngest of the Italian litterateurs who are giving great  promise is Alberto Savinio, who is not only an interesting writer but an  accomplished musician, composer, and performer. Of Sicilian origin, he  was born in Tuscany and has lived in various parts of central Europe. He  first came to conspicuous notice through his articles in _Les Soirees de  Paris_. To the average reader he is known as a traveller and a narrator  of his observations and experiences in the form of comments and short  stories. Latterly, however, he has published a queer book entitled  \"Hermaphrodito,\" which is difficult briefly to characterize without  doing it injustice. It is a book that a clever man might write in the  early stages of delirium tremens, providing he returned to it after  recovery and added the chapters \"Isabella Hasson\" and \"La Partenza dell'  Argonauti.\" In the latter especially he shows himself capable of writing  temperate, vivacious, robust prose, of making inviting descriptions of  places, and of revealing man's conduct and his motives.    When the war broke out he returned to Italy and his contributions soon  began to appear in different journals, more particularly in the _Voce_  of Florence and the _Brigati_ of Bologna. Since then he has received  even greater praise than was meted out to him in Paris, and he gives  promise, should his development continue, of getting a place amongst the  modern writers.    Another young writer of the same kidney, though by no means of such  promise, is Mario Venditti. He is a type of juvenile writer in Italy who  excites a curiosity to know how he succeeds in getting some of his  writings published. He appears to have a writing formula: take of  substantives whose meaning is known to few save dictionary experts,  archaic or uncommon adjectives, adverbs, or adverbial phrases taken from  other languages, excerpts from scientific writings, especially  philosophy and medicine, and string them together so that when they are  read aloud there will be a certain sonorous, musical effect, and at the  same time suggest a color accompaniment. He reminds of a properly  brought-up and well-educated boy who, when he reaches the age of  puberty, insists upon wearing what are called \"outlandish\" clothes, a  combination of the apparel of the clown and that of the fashion-plate,  to which he attaches ornate trimmings and incongruous decoration. In  such costume he struts about with a nonchalance and swagger of  self-appreciation which is more irritating even than his sartorial  affectations. Many modern literary youths seem to have to go through a  period of this kind, just as the children of \"First Families,\"  unfortunately, must have mumps and measles. Like the victims of those  diseases the majority of them go through unscathed, but every now and  then one of them is intellectually enfeebled and genetically sterilized.    Signor Venditti has not assured us by the publication of \"Il Burattino e  la Pialla\" that he is not a victim.    When is a Futurist not a Futurist? A very difficult question that, for  readers answer it one way and writers another. Some writers are  Futuristic on alternate days, or "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41990"],[0,"The Cid Campeador: A Historical Romance (#14)"],[1,"whilst she was addressing the  king; and then she felt her impotence in trying to conquer love with  feelings of revenge. What would she not have given, at that moment, to  be able to tear from her heart that undying affection which, in her  mind, was a crime against the dead body of her father, whose wounds were  still dropping blood and crying for vengeance!    That exclamation was also a revelation to the king, who, not being  ignorant of the love which had formerly united Rodrigo and Ximena,  doubted whether it could have been completely extinguished in her, and  changed to hatred, as the demand she made of him seemed to testify. Don  Fernando, however, knew human hearts, especially the hearts of women,  too well, to openly oppose her feelings, especially when he felt almost  sure that they were but transitory; he knew very well that when a  sentiment is rooted in the core of the heart, it goes on increasing, of  itself, until it is powerful enough to drive away all others which had  been pressing it down, in the same way that the sun drives off the  clouds that for a time obscure his brightness, showing himself soon  again with the glory of the conqueror. The wise monarch also knew that  the weakest and most superficial caprices change, when strongly opposed,  into strong and deep determinations, and for that reason he resolved to  temporise with Ximena, trusting that time would make her desist from her  complaints. He knew the Count of Gormaz and Rodrigo well enough to feel  certain on whose side was the right, and he had not forgotten the grave  offence by which the former had given the latter just excuse to kill  him, even if the fight had been with equal arms, much more so when  perfidy was resorted to, for Don Gome had acted in a perfidious manner,  striking on the face an honourable and feeble old man who had held out  his hand generously to him.    \"Ximena,\" he said to the maiden, \"I repeat that you shall receive  justice from me; if Rodrigo acted treacherously he shall be punished,  and you know that in my realm there is justice for all, and no one can  escape it, be he ever so powerful.\"    Ximena returned to her dwelling. Notwithstanding the promise that the  king had given her to punish Rodrigo if he were guilty, her inquietude,  her grief, and her despair had increased rather than diminished. That  night her sleep was a delirium in which was epitomised an eternity of  torments; a horrible nightmare pressed on her for long hours; she saw a  man, exhaling his last breath, and calling out her name, the name of  Ximena.    And that man was not he whom she had seen during the nightmares of  preceding nights, that man was not her father.    He was Rodrigo Diaz!    When she awoke, when she succeeded in shaking off that terrible  nightmare, at the very instant in which she was struggling to get near  the dying man, in order to infuse new life into him with her breath,  calling him by the sweet names which she had lavished on him in other  times, when they wandered through the fields of Gormaz, or those of  Vivar, happy and joyful as the birds and butterflies, then,--ah! then,  she became enraged with herself, tore her hair in terrible despair, and  rushed to the window of her chamber in order to throw herself from it;  and she would have done so, if Lambra, who watched constantly by her  side, disconsolate and despairing like herself, had not pulled her back,  despite her struggles, which were but feeble, as her strength had been  much reduced by grief and by fever.    And when she recognised her impotence, not alone to crush down her love,  but also to find death as an end to her sufferings, she fell on her  knees, and, raising her eyes and hands to heaven, she exclaimed--    \"O my father, pardon, pardon! Mother, why did you not smother me in your  arms when you brought me into the world?\"    She then fell on the floor, like an inert mass, and the voice of Lambra  resounded through the mansion, summoning assistance for her mistress.           *       *       *       *       *    On the following morning Ximena rose from her bed very early,  notwithstanding her strength being so reduced that she could scarcely  walk a step without stumbling, and began to make preparations for a  journey.    \"But, my lady,\" said Lambra, \"would you not be better at Gormaz, where  all love you, and where you would have your own house and the  recollections of your childhood?\"    \"It is from those very recollections that I desire to fly, for you well  know that Rodrigo and I passed our childhood partly at Gormaz and partly  at Vivar.\"    \"You are right; I did not think of that; but, however it may be, it  would be a sad life in a desert like\"--    \"My life must be a sad one wherever I may be; and as my only hope is  now of heaven, I desire to make myself deserving of it whilst I live on  earth. If the king will not do me justice, the friends of my father will  do so; but I have not courage to hunt down him who shed my father's  blood.... I will not persecute him, but I shall forget him for ever.\"    Ximena and Lambra continued to get together all the articles necessary  for a long journey.    \"Do you intend to bring these trifles with you?\" asked the due[~n]a,  showing to her mistress a casket which, with other things, she had taken  from a drawer.    \"Yes,\" answered Ximena; \"for that casket contains many souvenirs of my  mother.... But oh!\" she added, \"it also contains some of Rodrigo. Give  it to me, give it to me. I will keep for ever those of my mother, but I  shall burn those of that traitor.\"    And taking the case in her hand, she began to turn over the things which  it contained. They were, for the most part, ribbons, flowers, rings, and  children's toys. The first she drew out was a wreath of flowers. \"Ah!\"  she said, \"with this wreath he adorned my brow on my fifteenth  birthday!\"    She was about to pull it to pieces with her hands, but she feared to  touch the flowers, as if they were covered with thorns. She then drew  forth a black curl bound with green ribbon, and said, \"Here is a lock of  his hair which he gave me the last time we were together at Gormaz, as a  pledge of a love which he himself has destroyed!\" And she raised her  hand to cast it far from her; but she stopped, pensive, and apparently  struggling with opposing feelings. Suddenly tears gushed from her eyes,  and she cried out, placing the wreath and the curl again in the casket,  \"Leave them there, Lambra, leave them there; and let this wreath and  this curl be the haircloth to torture me in my solitude.\"    The maiden remained motionless for a short time, during which she ran  over in her imagination the story of her love--the story of her  life--for they were both but one. The purest love,--ardent, surrounded  with heavenly illusions, with gilded dreams, with light, with  flowers,--the beauty of which can only be understood by certain  enamoured souls,--had entirely made up the life of Ximena. And at seeing  her hopes blasted, at seeing parched up, never to sprout forth again,  that flower of paradise which perfumed and inebriated her soul, she felt  her heart torn with the profoundest sadness, with an immense despair,  with an agony that cannot be described. The youth or the maiden who has  consecrated entire years to a love which holds its mastery in dreams as  well as in waking hours, always sweet, always beautiful, always  surrounded by an enchantment superior to all other enchantments of this  world, and in a day, in a few hours, loses, without hope of recovering  it, the object of that love--such a youth or maiden only can comprehend  the grief of Ximena. In those moments of terrible despair the sole  comfort that can be found is to have a mother, a father, a brother, a  friend--some being sufficiently good and sensible not to laugh at our  tears, so that we may cast ourselves into his arms and weep on his  breast, saying, \"My heart is pierced; give me, for the sake of God, a  little love, with which I may calm my grief; fill up, as much as is in  your power, that deep void which is left in my soul; make less bitter  the transition state from hope to despair!\"    And it was granted to Ximena to enjoy that comfort: she had Lambra  beside her, plain and homely, perhaps, but affectionate and good, and  she threw herself into her arms and solaced herself with copious tears.    On that same day the disconsolate girl set out for Castile, accompanied  by the due[~n]a and a few of her servants; and tradition affirms that,  after them, a youth went out from Leon, who stopped on an eminence near  the city, and followed with his gaze the daughter of Don Gome, until a  distant turn of the road removed her from his view.          CHAPTER IX    HOW A MOORISH PRINCESS WAS CONVERTED, AND HOW A SOLITARY CEASED TO BE  SUCH      At that time the Moor Almenon was King of Toledo, and with him Don  Fernando the Great, King of Castile and Leon, kept up a cordial  friendship. This Moorish monarch had a daughter, very beautiful and  tender-hearted, named Casilda.    In the vicinity of the gardens which surrounded the Alcazar of Almenon,  there were gloomy dungeons in which wept, half-starved and loaded with  chains, many Christian captives.    One day, when Casilda was walking in her father's gardens, she heard the  sad wailings of those captives: her kind heart caused her to weep for  their sufferings, for she liked Christians from the time when, in her  girlhood, a Castilian female slave told her that the Christians loved  God, their king, and their families; that amongst them the weak and  oppressed were protected; that they rewarded the good and punished  evil-doers.    The princess then returned to the palace, with her heart full of  sadness, and knelt at the feet of her father, saying--    \"My father, in the dungeons near your gardens a large number of captives  are suffering. Remove their chains from them, open the doors of their  prisons, and "]]]
