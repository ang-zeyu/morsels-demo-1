This is accompanied by a translation of Mark's Gospel into the Kikamba  dialect, and a short grammar of the Kisuaheli. The author of these works  is the Protestant minister Krap, who has been for fifteen years in  Ethiopia, and has collected and presented to the University at Tubingen  a considerable number of most valuable Ethiopian manuscripts.           *       *       *       *       *    A notable and interesting book is BEHSE'S _Geschichte des preussischen  Hofes und Adels_ (History of the Prussian Court and Nobility) of which  the two first volumes have just been published at Hamburg by Hoffman &  Campe. The whole work will contain from thirty to forty small volumes,  and will treat all the states of Germany, only some half dozen volumes  being devoted to Prussia. The two now published bring the history down  to the reign of Frederic William II. They abound in most curious  historic details. For instance, the acquisition of the title of King of  Prussia by the Elector of Brandenburgh, Frederic III., is narrated at  length. It seems that this prince, who was deformed in body, but as  politic as he was ambitious in spirit, after many fruitless efforts  obtained from the Emperor at Vienna the grant of the royal dignity, by a  bribe of two hundred thousand thalers, paid to the Jesuit Father Wolff,  as a compensation for the influence of the Society, whose members were  flattered that the most powerful of the Protestant princes of Germany  should solicit their assistance. The whole cost of the grant was six  millions of thalers, an enormous sum for these times. The Papal Court  refused to recognize the new king, and did not until Frederic the Great.           *       *       *       *       *    We believe a general _Biographical Dictionary of Illustrious Women_, now  in course of publication in Berlin, is to be reproduced here, with  suitable additions. We need, while discussions of the sphere and  capacities of women are so common among us, a work of real learning and  authority, in which the part which the sex has borne and is capable of  bearing in the business of civilizing, shall be carefully and honestly  exhibited. There are fifteen or twenty volumes of short biographies of  women now in print in this country, with prospects of others--all  worthless except this extensive German work, which is considerably  advanced, and for its literary merit as well as for the interest of its  materials, will command an unusual degree of attention.           *       *       *       *       *    Countess Ida Hahn Hahn is writing a work to be called _My Way from  Darkness to Light, from Error to Truth_. She has became a Catholic, and  this book is intended to tell why. A cheap edition of her works is  publishing at Berlin. We presume they are no longer in her control, but  belong to her publishers, as she could scarcely consent to reprint some  of them.           *       *       *       *       *    A new work bearing as its title the single word _Italia_, is about to be  published at Frankfort on the Main. It is a complete artistic, historic  and poetic manual for travellers in that lovely peninsula.           *       *       *       *       *    The Cologne Musical Society lately offered a prize for the best  symphony. Eighty-three have been offered, of which one only seems to be  a pure plagiarism.           *       *       *       *       *    A book just published in Germany under the title of _Berlin und die  Berliner_ contains some exceedingly interesting details concerning the  great naturalist ALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT, from which the _International_  translates the following: \"When, in the years 1834-5, we young students  thronged into lecture room No. VIII., at eight o'clock on winter  mornings, to hear Boeckh on Greek literature and antiquities, we used to  see in the crowd of students in the dark corridor a small, white-haired,  old, and happy-looking man, dressed in a long brown coat. This man was  the _studiosus philologiae_, Alexander von Humboldt, who came, as he  said, to go through again what he had neglected in his youth. When we  met him in the lecture-room we respectfully made way for him; for though  we had no respect for any body, especially professors, Humboldt was an  exception, for he knew 'a hellish deal.' To his own honor, the German  student still respects this quality. During the lecture Humboldt sat on  the fourth or fifth bench near the window, where he drew a piece of  paper from a portfolio in his pocket, and took notes. In going home he  liked to accompany Boeckh, so as in conversation to build some logical  bridge or other from the old world to the new, after his ingenious  fashion. There was then in the class a man who has since distinguished  himself in political literature, but whom we had nicknamed 'Mosherosh,'  that is Calves'-head, on account of his stupid appearance. As Mosherosh  generally came in late, it was the fashion to receive him with a  magnificent round of stamping. One day, Humboldt came too late, and just  at the usual time of Mosherosh, and without looking up we gave the  regular round, while Humboldt, blushing and embarrassed, made his way to  his place. In a moment the mistake was seen, and a good-natured laugh  succeeded. Humboldt also attended the evening lectures of Ritter on  universal geography, and let the weather be as bad as it might, the  gray-haired man never failed. If for a rarity he chanced not to come, we  said among ourselves in students' jargon, 'Alexander cuts the college  to-day, because he's gone to King's to tea.' Once, on occasion of  discussing an important problem of physical geography, Ritter quoted  him, and every body looked up at him. Humboldt bowed to us, with his  usual good nature, which put the youngsters into the happiest humor. We  felt ourselves elevated by the presence of this great thinker and most  laborious student. We seemed to be joined with him in the pursuit of  great scientific ends.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The rewards of Authors, we suspect, are greatest in France. In Germany,  England and the United States they are about the same. Cooper, Irving  and Prescott, in this country, have each received for copyrights more  than one hundred thousand dollars. In England, Dickens has probably  received more than any other living author--and in France Lamartine,  Victor Hugo, Dumas, Scribe, Thiers, and many others, have obtained large  fortunes by writing. In Germany Dieffenbach received for his book on  Operative Surgery some $3,500; and Perthes of Hamburg, paid to Neander  on a single work, more than $20,000, exclusive of the interest his heirs  still have in it. Poets like Uhland, Freiligrath, Geibel, have also  received as much as $6,000 or $12,000 on the sales of a single volume.  Long ago in Boston, Robert Treat Paine received $1,500 for a song. Of  our living poets, Longfellow has been most liberally paid.           *       *       *       *       *    George Stephens, the learned translator of the _Frithiof's Saga_ of  BISHOP TEGNER, in a letter to _The International_ states that he is now  printing at Copenhagen three Anglo-Saxon poems of the eleventh century,  namely: _The Old Testament Story, On the Sixth Day's Work_, and _The New  Testament Story_, by Aelfric, Archbishop of York, now just translated  into the metre and alliteration of the original. The three poems will  make a quarto volume of about thirty sheets, and copies may be ordered  (price three dollars), through the Hon. H. W. Ellsworth, late United  States _Charge d'Affaires_ in Sweden, at New-York, or Dr. S. H. Smith,  of Cincinnati. Of the ability and fidelity with which the work will be  executed, the readers of the Frithiof's Saga need no other assurance.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Etherization,\" after all, is not a modern discovery, and Wells,  Jackson, and Morton, are alike undeserving of the praise they have  received on account of it. The Paris _Siecle_ states that a manuscript,  written by Papin, known, for his experiments connected with the motive  power of steam, has been discovered near Marburg in Electoral Hesse;  that the work bears the name of _Traite des Operations sans Douleur_,  and that in it are examined the different means that might be employed  to deaden, or altogether nullify, sensibility when surgical operations  are being performed on the human body, Papin composed this work in 1681,  but his contemporaries treated it with ridicule, and he abandoned the  medical profession.           *       *       *       *       *    A new five-act play, tragic of course, has just appeared at Berlin,  founded on the history of Philip Augustus of France. It is by a lady of  the aristocratic circles of the Prussian capital, who now makes her  debut in literature. It is praised as excellent by those who are not in  the habit of being satisfied with the writings of ladies. A collection  of poems from the same pen is shortly to appear.           *       *       *       *       *    M. Bianchi's _Turkish and French Dictionary_, in two large octavos, has  reached a second edition at Paris. It is all that could be desired for  the use of diplomatic and consular agents, traders, navigators, and  other travellers in the Levant, but not designed for critics in the  language or its literature.           *       *       *       *       *    The students of geography and foreign modes of life, owe a debt to the  French General DAUMAS, for his three works on north-western Africa. The  first entitled, _Le Sahara Algerien_, is an exact and thorough and  scientific account of the desert in Algiers, given, however, with a flow  of manly, soldatesque imagination, which imparts life and charm to the  narrative, and even adorned with frequent quotations from the Arab  poets, who have sung the various localities he describes.

He had no option but  to order a retreat.    Dealing with the combined action of the French and British in this  critical period a French military writer says:    \"The French armies of the center--that is to say, the Third and Fourth  Armies--had as their mission the duty of attacking the German army in  Belgian Luxembourg, of attempting to put it to flight and of crumpling  it up against the left flank of the German main body at the north. This  offensive on the part of the French center began on August 21, 1914. The  Third Army (General Ruffey) followed from the east to the west the  course of the Semoy, a tributary on the right of the Meuse. The Fourth  Army operated between the Meuse and the Lesse. The Germans occupied the  plateau which extends from Neufchateau to Paliseul. It is uncertain  territory, covered with heaths and thick woods, and lends itself poorly  to the reconnaissance work of aviators or cavalry patrols. There are no  targets for the artillery. The Germans had strongly fortified the  ground. The infantry of the Fourth Army which hurled itself against  these positions was thrown back; still fighting it fell back over the  Meuse. The pursuit by the Germans was punctuated by strong  counterattacks, which inflicted great losses on them. The Third Army was  similarly checked in its march on Neufchateau by the superior forces of  the crown prince and was thrown back on the Semoy. Thus the offensive  actions undertaken by the armies of the French center miscarried. Not  only were they unable to lend their aid to the armies of the left, but  they saw themselves obliged to retreat.    \"The situation could only be reestablished by a victory on the part of  the Fifth French Army operating in conjunction with the army of General  French. This army, however, found itself in the presence of German  forces of great strength, consisting of the crack corps of the German  army. On the 22d the Germans at the cost of considerable losses  succeeded in passing the Sambre, and General Lanrezac fell back on  Beaumont-Givet, being apprehensive of the danger which threatened his  right. On the 24th the British army retreated, in the face of a German  attack, on to the Maubeuge-Valenciennes line. It appeared at first that  the British had in front of them at most an army corps, with perhaps a  corps of cavalry. They were apprised, however, about five o'clock in the  evening that three army corps were advancing against them, while a  fourth was marching against their left along the road from Tournai in a  turning movement. General French effected his retreat during the night  behind the salient of Mons. Threatened on August 24 by the strength of  the whole German army, he fled backward in the direction of Maubeuge.\"          CHAPTER X    THE GREAT RETREAT BEGINS      The German hosts now stood at the gates of France. It was a mighty  spectacle. The soldiery of the Kaiser which had swept their way into  Belgium, there to meet the unexpected resistance of the defenders of  King Albert, had reached their goal--the French frontier.    About the middle of August, 1914, General Joffre, assigned to the  British Expeditionary Force, commanded by Sir John French, the task of  holding Mons against the powerful German advance. The British force  formed the left wing of the line of front that stretched for some two  hundred miles close to the Belgian frontier. Extending from Arras  through the colliery towns of Mons and Charleroi, the extreme western  front of the armies was held by General D'Amade at Arras, with about  40,000 reserve territorial troops; by General French, with 80,000  British regulars, at Mons; by the Fifth French Army of 200,000  first-line troops, under General Lanrezac, near Charleroi; and by a  force of 25,000 Belgian troops at Namur. The total Allied troops in this  field of battle were thus about 345,000 men.    Opposed to them, on the north, were about 700,000 German troops, General  von Kluck farthest to the west, Generals von Buelow and von Hausen around  the Belgian fortress of Namur, Grand Duke Albrecht of Wuerttemberg in the  neighborhood of Maubeuge, and finally, on the extreme left of the German  line, the Army of the Moselle, under Crown Prince Wilhelm.    The position of the Allied armies was based on the resisting power of  Namur. It was expected that Namur would delay the German advance as long  as Liege had done. Then the French line of frontier fortresses--Lille,  with its half-finished defenses; Maubeuge, with strong forts and a large  garrison; and other strongholds--would form a still more useful system  of fortified points for the Allies.    The German staff, however, had other plans. At Liege they had rashly  endeavored to storm a strong fortress by a massed infantry attack, which  had failed disastrously until their new Krupp siege guns had been  brought up. These quickly demolished the defenses. These siege guns,  therefore, which had thus fully demonstrated their value against  fortifications soon brought about the total defeat of the French  offensive, and compelled the Allies to retreat from Belgium and northern  France. The Germans lost no time in investing Namur, and on Saturday, as  noted above, August 22, 1914, the fortress fell into the invaders'  hands.    On the same day, August 22, 1914, the Fifth French Army, under the lead  of General Lanrezac, was enduring the double stress of Von Buelow's army  thundering against its front, and Von Hausen's two army corps pressing  hard upon its right flank and rear, threatening its line of retreat.  Against such terrific odds the French line at Dinant and Givet broke,  exposing the flank and rear of the whole army; and by the evening of  that day, August 22, the passages of the River Sambre, near Charleroi,  had been forced, and the Fifth Army was falling back, contesting every  mile of the ground with desperate rear-guard action. The British,  meanwhile, defending the Mons position, were in grave danger of being  cut off, enveloped, and destroyed.    Sir John French had put his two army corps into battle array. He had  about thirty miles of front to defend, with Mons nearly in the center.    On Sunday afternoon, August 23, 1914, the full weight of the German  onset fell for the first time upon the British.    All that night the British were under the fire of German artillery.    Sir John French realized the danger of his Maubeuge-Jenlain position,  and on Monday evening, August 24, 1914, realizing the importance of  putting a substantial barrier, such as the Somme or the Oise, between  his force and the enemy, gave orders for the retirement to be continued  at five o'clock the next morning, August 25, 1914. He had decided upon a  new position about the town of Le Cateau, east of Cambrai. Before dawn,  August 25, 1914, the southward march over rough, hilly country was  resumed, and toward evening of August 25, 1914, after a long, hard day's  fighting march over the highroads, in midsummer heat and thundershowers,  the Guards Brigade and other regiments of the Second Corps, wet and  weary, arrived at the little market town of Landrecies. From Landrecies,  after an encounter with a German column, they marched south toward  Wassigny on Guise.    [Illustration: Battle of Mons and Retreat of Allied Armies.]    While the night attack on Landrecies was raging, the Germans, taxing  their men to the uttermost, marched four other corps through the tract  of country between the west side of the forest and the road from  Valenciennes to Cambrai. These corps were in a position along  Smith-Dorrien's front before dawn of Wednesday, August, 26, 1914, and in  the earliest hours of the morning it became apparent that the Germans  were determined to throw the bulk of their strength against the British  battalions which had moved up to a position south of the small town of  Solesmes, extending to the south of Cambrai. Thus placed, this force  could shield the Second Corps, now beginning its retreat under pressure  of the German army advancing from Tournai. These troops under General  Snow were destined to play an important part in the impending battle of  Le Cateau.    By sunrise the guns of the four German corps were firing from positions  facing the British left, and gray-green masses of infantry were pressing  forward in dense firing lines. In view of this attack, General  Smith-Dorrien judged it impossible to continue his retreat at daybreak.  The First Corps was at that moment scarcely out of difficulty, and  General Sordet--whose troops had been fighting hard on the flank of the  Fifth French Army, with General Lanrezac, against General von Buelow's  hosts--was unable to help the British, owing to the exhausted state of  his cavalry. The situation was full of peril; indeed, Wednesday bade  fair to become the most critical day of the retreat.    As the day of August 26, 1914, wore on, General von Kluck, abandoning  frontal attacks, began to use his superior numbers in a great enveloping  move on both flanks, and some of his batteries secured positions from  which they could enfilade the British line. Smith-Dorrien, having no  available reserves, was thus virtually ringed by enemy guns on one side  and by hostile infantry on all sides. \"It became apparent,\" says Sir  John French's dispatch, \"that if complete annihilation was to be  avoided, a retirement must be attempted; and the order was given to  commence it about 3.30 p. m. The movement was covered with the most  devoted intrepidity and determination by the artillery, which had  suffered heavily, and the fine work done by the cavalry in the farther  retreat from the position assisted materially in the completion of this  difficult and dangerous operation. The saving of the left wing could  never have been accomplished unless a commander\" (Sir Horace  Smith-Dorrien) \"of rare coolness had been present to personally conduct  the operation.\"    This retirement foreshadowed the end of the"]]]
