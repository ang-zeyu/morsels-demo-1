The motor-cycle was tied on behind the big touring car, and  with the unconscious form of Tom in the tonneau, beside Morse, who  stroked his mustache nervously, the auto started off. The storm had  passed, and the sun was shining brightly, but Tom could not see it.          CHAPTER XV.    A VAIN SEARCH      Several hours later Tom had a curious dream. He imagined he was  wandering about in the polar regions, and that it was very cold. He  was trying to reason with himself that he could not possibly be on  an expedition searching for the North Pole, still he felt such a  keen wind blowing over his scantily-covered body that he shivered.  He shivered so hard, in fact, that he shivered himself awake, and  when he tried to pierce the darkness that enveloped him he was  startled, for a moment, with the idea that perhaps, after all, he  had wandered off to some unknown country.    For it was quite dark and cold. He was in a daze, and there was a  curious smell about him--an odor that he tried to recall. Then, all  at once, it came to him what it was--chloroform. Once his father had  undergone an operation, and to deaden his pain chloroform had been  used.    \"I've been chloroformed!\" exclaimed the young inventor, and his  words sounded strange in his ears. \"That's it. I've met with an  accident riding my motor-cycle. I must have hit my head, for it  hurts fearful. They picked me up, carried me to a hospital and have  operated on me. I wonder if they took off an arm or leg? I wonder  what hospital I'm in? Why is it so dark and cold?\"    As he asked himself these questions his brain gradually cleared from  the haze caused by the cowardly blow, and from the chloroform that  had been administered by Featherton.    Tom's first act was to feel first of one arm, then the other. Having  satisfied himself that neither of these members were mutilated he  reached down to his legs.    \"Why, they're all right, too,\" he murmured. \"I wonder what they did  to me? That's certainly, chloroform I smell, and my head feels as if  some one had sat on it. I wonder--\"    Quickly he put up his hands to his head. There appeared to be  nothing the matter with it, save that there was quite a lump on the  back, where the club had struck.    \"I seem to be all here,\" went on Tom, much mystified. \"But where am  I? That's the question. It's a funny hospital, so cold and dark--\"    Just then his hands came in contact with the cold ground on which he  was lying.    \"Why, I'm outdoors!\" he exclaimed. Then in a flash it all came back  to him--how he had gone to wait under the church shed until the rain  was over.    \"I fell asleep, and now it's night,\" the youth went on. \"No wonder I  am sore and stiff. And that chloroform--\" He could not account for  that, and he paused, puzzled once more. Then he struggled to a  sitting position. His head was strangely dizzy, but he persisted,  and got to his feet. He could see nothing, and groped around in the  dark, until he thought to strike a match. Fortunately he had a  number in his pocket. As the little flame flared up Tom started in  surprise.    \"This isn't the church shed!\" he exclaimed. \"It's much smaller! I'm  in a different place! Great Scott! but what has happened to me?\"    The match burned Tom's fingers and he dropped it. The darkness  closed in once more, but Tom was used to it by this time, and  looking ahead of him he could make out that the shed was an open  one, similar to the one where he had taken shelter. He could see the  sky studded with stars, and could feel the cold night wind blowing  in.    \"My motor-cycle!\" he exclaimed in alarm. \"The model of dad's  invention--the papers!\"    Our hero thrust his hand into his pocket. The papers were gone!  Hurriedly he lighted another match. It took but an instant to glance  rapidly about the small shed. His machine was not in sight!    Tom felt his heart sink. After all his precautions he had been  robbed. The precious model was gone, and it had been his proposition  to take it to Albany in this manner. What would his father say?    The lad lighted match after match, and made a rapid tour of the  shed. The motor-cycle was not to be seen. But what puzzled Tom more  than anything else was how he had been brought from the church shed  to the one where he had awakened from his stupor.    \"Let me try to think,\" said the boy, speaking aloud, for it seemed  to help him. \"The last I remember is seeing that automobile, with  those mysterious men in, approaching. Then it disappeared in the  rain. I thought I heard it again, but I couldn't see it. I was  sitting on the log, and--and--well, that's all I can remember. I  wonder if those men--\"    The young inventor paused. Like a flash it came to him that the men  were responsible for his predicament. They had somehow made him  insensible, stolen his motor-cycle, the papers and the model, and  then brought him to this place, wherever it was. Tom was a shrewd  reasoner, and he soon evolved a theory which he afterward learned  was the correct one. He reasoned out almost every step in the crime  of which he was the victim, and at last came to the conclusion that  the men had stolen up behind the shed and attacked him.    \"Now, the next question to settle,\" spoke Tom, \"is to learn where I  am. How far did those scoundrels carry me, and what has become of my  motor-cycle?\"    He walked toward the point of the shed where he could observe the  stars gleaming, and there he lighted some more matches, hoping he  might see his machine. By the gleam of the little flame he noted  that he was in a farmyard, and he was just puzzling his brain over  the question as to what city or town he might be near when he heard  a voice shouting:    \"Here, what you lightin' them matches for? You want to set the place  afire? Who be you, anyhow--a tramp?\"    It was unmistakably the voice of a farmer, and Tom could hear  footsteps approaching on the run.    \"Who be you, anyhow?\" the voice repeated. \"I'll have the constable  after you in a jiffy if you're a tramp.\"    \"I'm not a tramp,\" called Tom promptly. \"I've met with an accident.  Where am I?\"    \"Humph! Mighty funny if you don't know where you are,\" commented the  farmer. \"Jed, bring a lantern until I take a look at who this is.\"    \"All right, pop,\" answered another voice, and a moment later Tom saw  a tall man standing in front of him.    \"I'll give you a look at me without waiting for the lantern,\" said  Tom quickly, and he struck a match, holding it so that the gleam  fell upon his face.    \"Salt mackerel! It's a young feller!\" exclaimed the farmer. \"Who be  you, anyhow, and what you doin' here?\"    \"That's just what I would like to know,\" said Tom, passing his hand  over his head, which was still paining him. \"Am I near Albany?  That's where I started for this morning.\"    \"Albany? You're a good way from Albany,\" replied the farmer. \"You're  in the village of Dunkirk.\"    \"How far is that from Centreford?\"    \"About seventy miles.\"    \"As far as that?\" cried Tom. \"They must have carried me a good way  in their automobile.\"    \"Was you in that automobile?\" demanded the farmer.    \"Which one?\" asked Tom quickly.    \"The one that stopped down the road just before supper. I see it,  but I didn't pay no attention to it. If I'd 'a' knowed you fell out,  though, I'd 'a' come to help you.\"    \"I didn't fall out, Mr.--er--\" Tom paused.    \"Blackford is my name; Amos Blackford.\"    \"Well, Mr. Blackford, I didn't fall out. I was drugged and brought  here.\"    \"Drugged! Salt mackerel! But there's been a crime committed, then.  Jed, hurry up with that lantern an' git your deputy sheriff's badge  on. There's been druggin' an' all sorts of crimes committed. I've  caught one of the victims. Hurry up! My son's a deputy sheriff,\" he  added, by way of an explanation.    \"Then I hope he can help me catch the scoundrels who robbed me,\"  said Tom.    \"Robbed you, did they? Hurry up, Jed. There's been a robbery! We'll  rouse the neighborhood an' search for the villains. Hurry up, Jed!\"    \"I'd rather find my motor-cycle, and a valuable model which was on  it, than locate those men,\" went on Tom. \"They also took some papers  from me.\"    Then he told how he had started for Albany, adding his theory of how  he had been attacked and carried away in the auto. The latter part  of it was borne out by the testimony of Mr. Blackford.    \"What I know about it,\" said the farmer, when his son Jed had  arrived on the scene with a lantern and his badge, \"is that jest  about supper time I saw an automobile stop down the road a bit, It  was gittin' dusk, an' I saw some men git out. I didn't pay no  attention to them, 'cause I was busy about the milkin'. The next I  knowed I seen some one strikin' matches in my wagon shed, an' I come  out to see what it was.\"    \"The men must have brought me all the way from the church shed near  Centreford to here,\" declared Tom. \"Then they lifted me out and put  me in your shed. Maybe they left my motor-cycle also.\"    \"I didn't see nothin' like that,\" said the farmer. \"Is that what you  call one of them two-wheeled lickity-split things that a man sits on  the middle of an' goes like chain-lightning?\"    \"It is,\" said Tom. \"I wish you'd help me look for it.\"    The farmer and his son agreed, and other lanterns having been  secured, a search was made. After about half an hour the motor-cycle  was discovered in some bushes at the side of the road, near where  the automobile had stopped. But the model was missing from it, and a  careful search near where the machine had been hidden did not reveal  it. Nor did as careful a hunt as they could make in the darkness  disclose any clues to the scoundrels who had drugged and robbed Tom.          CHAPTER XVI.    BACK HOME      \"We've got to organize a regular searchin' party,\" declared Jed  Blackford, after he and his father, together with Tom and the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324"],[0,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus (#14)"],[1,"secluded me from the  intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but  Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me  to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.  Excellent friend! how sincerely did you love me, and endeavour to  elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own! A selfish pursuit  had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection warmed  and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years  ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care. When happy,  inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful  sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. The  present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the  hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I was undisturbed by  thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me,  notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible  burden.    Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings:  he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that  filled his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly  astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often,  in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of  wonderful fancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite  poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great  ingenuity.    We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were  dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits  were high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and  hilarity.          CHAPTER VII.    On my return, I found the following letter from my father:--    \"My dear Victor,    \"You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of  your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines,  merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But that would  be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be your surprise,  my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the  contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can I relate our  misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and  griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent son? I wish to  prepare you for the woful news, but I know it is impossible; even now  your eye skims over the page, to seek the words which are to convey to  you the horrible tidings.    \"William is dead!--that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed  my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!    \"I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the  circumstances of the transaction.    \"Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to  walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged  our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of  returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone  on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until  they should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen  his brother: he said, that he had been playing with him, that William  had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and  afterwards waited for him a long time, but that he did not return.    \"This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him  until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned  to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with torches; for I  could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and  was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered  extreme anguish. About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy,  whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health,  stretched on the grass livid and motionless: the print of the murderer's  finger was on his neck.    \"He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my  countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to  see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her; but she persisted,  and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the  victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, 'O God! I have murdered my  darling child!'    \"She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again  lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same evening  William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that  she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and was doubtless  the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We have no trace  of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are  unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!    \"Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps  continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her  words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an  additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter? Your  dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live to  witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!    \"Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,  but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of  festering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my  friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not  with hatred for your enemies.    \"Your affectionate and afflicted father,    \"ALPHONSE FRANKENSTEIN.    \"Geneva, May 12th, 17--.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was  surprised to observe the despair that succeeded to the joy I at first  expressed on receiving news from my friends. I threw the letter on the  table, and covered my face with my hands.    \"My dear Frankenstein,\" exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with  bitterness, \"are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend, what has  happened?\"    I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the  room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of  Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.    \"I can offer you no consolation, my friend,\" said he; \"your disaster is  irreparable. What do you intend to do?\"    \"To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.\"    During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;  he could only express his heart-felt sympathy. \"Poor William!\" said he,  \"dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had  seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his  untimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer's grasp! How  much more a murderer, that could destroy such radiant innocence! Poor  little fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep,  but he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for  ever. A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no  longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable  survivors.\"    Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words  impressed themselves on my mind, and I remembered them afterwards in  solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a  cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.    My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I  longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends;  but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could  hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I  passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for  nearly six years. How altered every thing might be during that time! One  sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little  circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which,  although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive.  Fear overcame me; I dared not advance, dreading a thousand nameless  evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them.    I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I  contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and  the snowy mountains, \"the palaces of nature,\" were not changed. By  degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my  journey towards Geneva.    The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I  approached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides  of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a child.  \"Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your  wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid.  Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?\"    I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on  these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative  happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved  country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding  thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake!    Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also  closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt  still more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil,  and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched  of human beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single  circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not  conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.    It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of"]]]
