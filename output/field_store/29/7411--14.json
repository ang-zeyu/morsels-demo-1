Probably the warmth of the soil, and the purity  of the air, may make Surrey ponds prolific in microscopic life; but of  this we do not know enough to make a fair comparison, although our own  dips into them were tolerably lucky.    Walking one day down a lane leading towards Reigate, where the trees  arched overhead, ferns grew plentifully in the sandy banks, and the  sunlight flitted through the branches, and chequered the path, we came  to a shallow pond, or great puddle, which crossed the way, and near the  edge of the water the eye was struck with patches of crimson colour. On  attempting to take up a portion of one of these patches the whole  disappeared, although when the disturbance ceased the rich colour again  clothed the dingy mud. The appearance was caused by thousands of little  worms, belonging to the genus _Tubifex_, not uncommon in such  situations, who thrust themselves out to enjoy the light and air, and  retreat the moment an alarm is given. Probably both actions belong to  the class described in the last chapter, as \"reflex;\" but it would be  interesting to know whether creatures so humble have any sense of fear.  These worms will repay observation, but in these pages we eschew all  their tribe--unless the rotifers be assigned to them--and take ourselves  once more to our especial subjects.    [Illustration: Cryptomonad--Euglena.]    Knowing that farm-ponds are usually well stocked with microscopic game,  we made a dip into one more especially assigned to ducks, and obtained  wondrous little for our pains. We were not, however, discouraged, but  made an examination of the circumstances, which determined a particular  course of action. Our piece of water was simply a dirty duck-pond, in  which no large plants were growing, and which did not even exhibit the  little disks of duckweed that are common to such situations. There was,  however, on the surface, in parts, an exceedingly fine scum of pale  yellow green, and this, armed with a teaspoon, we proceeded to attack.  By careful skimming, a small bottle was half-filled with minute organic  particles, which were likely to be interesting in themselves, and pretty  sure to be the food for something else. A small drop was placed on a  tablet of the live-box, flattened out by the application of the cover,  and viewed with a power of two hundred linear, which disclosed swarms of  brilliant green globes, amongst which were a good sprinkle of minute  creatures, like the _Euglenae_ already described, and whose little red  eyes contrasted vividly with the prevailing emerald hue.    [Illustration: Cryptomonad.]    One of the higher infusoria, whose species I could not identify, was  devouring them like a porpoise among sprats. It did not, however,  exhibit any sense in its hungry career; it moved about in all  directions, gulping down what came in its way, but often permitting the  escape of the little green things that were almost in its mouth. The  little globes rolled and whirled about without the faintest indication  of a purpose, and without exhibiting any instrument with which their  locomotion was effected. To find out how this was done, a higher power  was used, and from their extreme minuteness an amplification of seven  hundred and twenty linear was conveniently employed, although a lower  one (three or four hundred) disclosed the secret by showing that a  little whip was flourished about through the neck, which the lower power  revealed. When highly magnified, each little globe was seen to consist  of an outer case of a reddish orange colour, which was noticeable on  looking at the edges, although in the centre it was transparent enough  to show the brilliant green contents, that resembled the chlorophyll, or  green colouring matter of plants. From a short neck proceeded the  whip-like filament, which was lashed and twisted about in all  directions. These little creatures belong to the monad family, but  whether they are to be called _Trachelomonads_, or by some other hard  name, the learned must decide.    The 'Micrographic Dictionary' puts a note of interrogation to the  assertion of some writers that _Trachelomonads_ have no necks, and draws  some with such an appendage.    Pritchard's last edition is against necks, and whether the necks or no  necks are to win, is a mighty question equal at least to the famous  controversy, which divided the world into \"big and little endians in the  matter of breaking eggs.\"    A discussion of more importance is, whether these _Cryptomonads_--that  name will do whatever comes of the neck controversy--are animals or  vegetables. Lachmann and Mr. Carter affirm that they have detected a  contractile vesicle, which would assimulate them to the animal series,  but their general behaviour is vegetable; and the 'Micrographic  Dictionary' is in favour of referring them to the _Algae_--that great  family of simple plants, of which the sea-weeds are the most important  representatives.    [Illustration: Triarthra.]    When any of the monads swarm, there are sure to be plenty of other  creatures to eat them up, and in this instance the predaceous  animalcule, already described, was not the only enemy the little green  globes had to suffer from, as two sorts of rotifer were frequently met  with. One of these was a very handsome and singular creature, which in  some positions had the general contour of a cockatoo, only that the legs  were wanting, and the head exhibited a monkey face. The \"wheels\" were  represented by ciliary tufts, and two bright red eyes twinkled with a  knowing look. From each shoulder proceeded a long curved spine, and  about two thirds down the body, and lying between the two long spines, a  shorter one was articulated, which followed the same curve. A gizzard  was busy in the breast, and the body terminated in two short toes, which  grasped a large round egg. Whenever the cilia were drawn in, the three  spines were thrown up; but they had an independent motion of their own,  and every now and then were jerked suddenly and violently back, which  occasioned a rapid change in the creature's position. The gizzard  appeared to consist of two rounded masses, having several ridges of  teeth, which worked against each other something like the prominences of  a coffee-mill. From the three spines, this animal was a _Triarthra_, or  Three-limbed Rotifer, but the position of the spines, and the toes, made  it differ from any species described in the 'Micrographic Dictionary,'  or in Pritchard.    Whether or not this species is to be regarded as having a lorica or not,  must depend upon the precise meaning attached to that word. At any rate  the integument was much firmer than in many of the rotifers, and gave an  efficient support to the spines which a mere skin could not do. As Mr.  Gosse remarks of an allied genus, the _Polyarthra_, or Many-limbed  Rotifer, this creature could not be investigated without coming to the  conclusion \"Here again we have true jointed limbs;\" a fact of great  importance in determining the zoological rank of the family, and in  supporting Mr. Gosse's view some at least bore a strong affinity with  the group of _Arthropoda_, of which the insects are the principal  representatives.    [Illustration: Brachionus urceolaris. This drawing has been accidentally  reversed by the engraver, which alters the relative place of the  internal organs.]    Another rotifer of even greater interest, which was busy among the  Cryptomonads, was the Brachion, or \"Pitcher Rotifer\" (Brachionus). The  members of this genus will frequently reward the searcher into  pond-life. Their main characteristic is a cup or pitcher-shaped lorica,  which is cut or notched at the top into several horns or projections,  the number of which indicates the species; while two or more similar  projections ornament the bottom. This lorica is like the shell of a  tortoise open at both ends; from the top an extremely beautiful wreath  of cilia is protruded, and also some longer and stiff cilia, or slender  spines, which do not exhibit the rotatory movement. The ciliary  apparatus is in reality continuous, but it more often presents the  appearance of several divisions, and the lateral cilia frequently hang  over the sides. From the large size of each cilium they are very  favorable creatures for exhibiting the real nature of the action, which  gives rise to the rotatory appearance, and which can be easier studied  than described. By movements, partly from their base, and partly arising  from the flexibility of their structure, the cilia come alternately in  and out of view, and when set in a circular pattern, the effect is  amazingly like the spinning round of a wheel. The internal arrangements  of the Brachiones are finely displayed, and they have a most aldermanic  allowance of gizzard, which extends more than half way across each side  of the median line, and shows all the portions described by Mr. Gosse.  As the joints of this machine move, and the teeth are brought together,  one could fancy a sound of mill-work was heard, and the observer is  fully impressed with a sense of mechanical power.    When the creature is obliging enough to present a full front view, her  domestic economy is excellently displayed. The prey that is caught in  her whirlpool is carried down by a strong ciliary current to the  gizzard, which may be often seen grappling with objects that appear much  too big for its grasp; and Mr. Gosse was lucky in witnessing an attempt  to chew up a morsel that did actually prove too large and too tough, and  which, after many ineffectual efforts, was suddenly cast out. As soon as  food has passed the gizzard, it is assisted in its journey by more  ciliary currents, which "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36922"],[0,"Antarctic Penguins: A Study of Their Social Habits (#14)"],[1,"is developed.  The individual care of the chicks by their parents is abandoned, and in  place of this, colonies start to \"pool\" their offspring, which are  herded together into clumps or \"creches,\" each of which is guarded by a  few old birds, the rest being free to go and forage.      (6) Fig. 62.      [Illustration: Fig. 60. A TASK BECOMING IMPOSSIBLE (Page 95)]    It is quite likely that if a chick which has escaped from its own creche  joins another creche it will get fed there, as it seems hardly possible  for the adults to recognize the individuals of so large a gathering and  to detect a stranger should one turn up, but there is good reason to  believe that the old birds work for their own creches only, and remain  faithful to them for the rest of the season, because, as they make their  way across the rookery, laden with the food they are bringing from the  sea, it is sadly common to see them pursued by strayed and starving  youngsters, plaintively piping their prayers for a meal; and these  appeals are always made in vain, the old birds turning a deaf ear to the  youngsters, who at last, weary and weak, give up the pursuit, and in the  end fall a prey to the ever-watchful skuas. Further evidence is found in  the fact that the chicks at the very back of the rookery and up at the  top of the Cape are just as well nourished as those nearer the water,  who are constantly passed by a stream of food-laden parents.    Twice already I have mentioned that strayed chicks fall a prey to  \"hooligan\" cocks. These hang about the rookery often in little bands. At  the beginning of the season there are very few of them, but later they  increase greatly, do much damage, and cause a great deal of annoyance to  the peaceful inhabitants. The few to be found at first probably are  cocks who have not succeeded in finding mates, and consequently are \"at  a loose end.\" Later on, as their numbers are so greatly increased, they  must be widowers, whose mates have lost their lives in one way or  another.    Many of the colonies, especially those nearer the water, are plagued by  little knots of \"hooligans,\" who hang about their outskirts, and should  a chick go astray it stands a good chance of losing its life at their  hands. The crimes which they commit are such as to find no place in this  book, but it is interesting indeed to note that, when nature intends  them to find employment, these birds, like men degenerate in idleness.    Some way back I made some allusion to the way in which many of the  penguins were choosing sites up the precipitous sides of the Cape at the  back of the rookery. Later I came to the conclusion that this was purely  the result of their love of climbing. There was one colony at the very  summit of the Cape,(7) whose inhabitants could only reach their nests by  a long and trying climb to the top and then a walk of some hundred yards  across a steep snow slope hanging over the very brink of a sheer drop of  seven hundred feet on to the sea-ice.      (7) Fig. 70.      [Illustration: Fig. 61. ADELIE WITH CHICK TWELVE DAYS OLD (Page 96)]    During the whole of the time when they were rearing their young, these  mountaineers had to make several journeys during each twenty-four hours  to carry their enormous bellyfuls of euphausia all the way from the sea  to their young on the nests--a weary climb for their little legs and  bulky bodies. The greater number who had undertaken this did so at a  time when there were ample spaces unoccupied in the most eligible parts  of the rookery.    I have mentioned that large masses of ice were stranded by the sea along  the shores of the rookery. These fragments of bergs, some of them  fifteen to twenty feet in height, formed a miniature mountain range  along the shore. All day parties of penguins were to be seen assiduously  climbing the steep sides of this little range. Time after time, when  half way up, they would descend to try another route, and often when  with much pains one had scaled a slippery incline, he would come sliding  to the bottom, only to pick himself up and have another try. (Fig. 63.)    Generally, this climbing was done by small parties who had clubbed  together, as they generally do, from social inclination. It was not  unusual for a little band of climbers to take as much as an hour or more  over climbing to the summit. Arrived at the top they would spend a  variable period there, sometimes descending at once, sometimes spending  a considerable time there, gazing contentedly about them, or peering  over the edge to chatter with other parties below.    Again, about half a mile from the beach, a large berg some one hundred  feet in height was grounded in fairly deep water, accessible at first  over the sea-ice, but later, when this had gone, surrounded by open  water. Its sides were sheer except on one side, which sloped steeply  from the water's edge to the top.    From the time when they first went to the sea to feed until the end of  the season, there was a continual stream of penguins ascending and  descending the berg. As I watched them through glasses I saw that they  had worn deep paths in the snow from base to summit. They had absolutely  nothing to gain by going to all this trouble but the pleasure they  seemed to derive from the climb, and when at the top, merely had a good  look round and came down again.      [Illustration: Fig. 62. A COUPLE WITH THEIR CHICKS (Page 96)]    When the birds were arriving at the rookery I watched for those who were  to nest up the cliff, and several times saw birds on arriving at the  rookery make for the heights without any hesitation, threading their way  almost in a straight line through the nests to the screes at the bottom  of the cliff, and up these to one or other of the paths leading up its  side. Probably these had been hatched there, or had nested there before,  and were making their way to their old haunts, but my notes on their  nesting habits go to show that the cocks, at any rate, cannot keep to  the same spot during successive years. It is the hen who chooses the  site, and stays on it, as I have shown, until a mate comes to her, and  wins her, very often only after defeating many other competitors.    The waste of life in an Adelie rookery is very great, and is due to the  following causes:      The eggs.        Skuas.        Cocks fighting among the nests.        Floods from thaw water.        Death of parents.        Snow-drifts.        Landslides.      The young chicks.        Skuas.        Landslides.        \"Hooligan\" cocks.        Getting lost.        Death of parents.      Adults.        Sea-leopards.        Landslides.        Snow-drifts.    In the above lists I have made no mention of the wanton depredations  committed--owing to the licence given to ignorant seamen--by expeditions  which visit the Antarctic from time to time, but as these visits are  made at rare intervals, they cannot greatly affect the population.      [Illustration: Fig. 63. ADELIE PENGUINS HAVE A STRONG LOVE OF CLIMBING    FOR ITS OWN SAKE (Page 99)]    Some of the items in my list require explanation. The screes at the foot  of the cliff at Cape Adare are perhaps the most thickly populated part  of the rookery. As the thaw proceeds, boulders of different sizes are  continually falling down the cliff, some of them for many hundreds of  feet before they finally plunge in among the nests on the screes, doing  terrible damage, and often rolling some distance out into the rookery.  At other times, owing to the bursting out of thaw water which has been  dammed up at the top of the cliff, large landslides are caused which  bury many hundreds of nests beneath them. In fact, these screes on which  the nests are built have been formed by these landslides taking place  from year to year, and no doubt form the graves of thousands upon  thousands of former generations. One of these slides took place whilst  we were at the rookery, doing terrible damage. A crowded colony of  Adelies were nesting just below, and the avalanche passed right through  and over them, causing the most sad havoc. We found hundreds of injured  and dying, some of them in a pitiable condition. Several were completely  disembowelled, others had the whole skin of their backs torn down and  hanging behind them in a flap, exposing the bare flesh. Dozens had  broken or dislocated legs and flippers.    The worst feature was that many were buried alive beneath the snow, or  pinned down to the ground by masses of basalt. Twice I saw one flipper  sticking out of the snow, moving dismally, and dug out in each case a  badly injured bird which would have lingered perhaps for days, because  loose snow does not always suffocate, owing to the amount of air  contained in its interstices, and to the fact that diffusion takes place  through it very readily. Several of us spent a long time in killing with  ice-axes those that seemed too badly injured to recover.    It was remarkable to see the way in which all the nests which had  escaped the avalanche, however narrowly, were still sat upon by their  occupants, as if nothing had happened. Also I saw several badly injured  birds sitting on their eggs, some of them soaked in blood, so that they  looked like crimson parrots. The amount of bloodshed must have been  great, as the snow was dyed with blood in all directions. As a cascade  of water followed the avalanche, and continued for some hours, spreading  out into little rivers among the nests, many were being deluged, and  some of the penguins actually were sitting in the running water, in a  vain attempt to keep warm their drowned chicks and spoiled eggs.    Sometimes, digging at hazard in the drifted snow, I came on birds that  had been deeply buried, and though they were held down and kept  motionless by the weight of the snow covering them, most of them were  alive, and I have no doubt many dozens died a lingering death in this  way.
