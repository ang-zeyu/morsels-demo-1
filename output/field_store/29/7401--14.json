Gray was also provided with a sea letter signed by George Washington,  then President, which ran as follows:      \"To all Emperors, Kings, Sovereign princes, State and Regents and to    their respective officers, civil and military and to all others whom    it may concern.      \"I, George Washington, President of the United States of America do    make known that Robert Gray, Captain of a ship called the Columbia of    the burden of about 230 tons, is a citizen of the United States and    that the said ship which he commands belongs to the citizens of the    United States; and as I wish that the said Robert Gray may prosper in    his lawful affairs, I do request all the before mentioned, and of each    of them separately, when the said Robert Gray shall arrive with his    vessel and cargo, that they will be pleased to receive him with    kindness and treat him in a becoming manner &c. and thereby I shall    consider myself obliged.      \"September 16, 1790--New York City      (Seal U. S.)      \"GEO. WASHINGTON,        _President_.      \"THOMAS JEFFERSON,        \"_Secy of State_.\"    He further was provided with a similar letter from John Hancock, the  Governor of Massachusetts.    [Illustration: On the Shores of the Pacific.]    His letter of instructions from the owners, signed by Joseph Barrell,  enjoins, in similar and even stronger terms than those given Kendrick  three years before, friendly treatment, strict honesty, honorable  conduct, and the avoidance of unjust advantage in trade with the  natives, the shunning of Spanish ports, tender treatment of his crew,  urgency of despatch in reaching the northwest coast, and the refraining  from all unnecessary connections with foreigners or Americans. It  further speaks of Gray's rising reputation, and expresses the belief  that a regard for his own honor, and a respect for the sea letter with  which the President had honored and indulged him, would cause Gray to  doubly exert himself for the success of the voyage.    Gray used such despatch and was so fortunate that he reached Cape  Flattery, at the mouth of the Straits of Fuca, June 5, 1791, his voyage  of eight months having been devoid of any occurrence worthy of note.  Proceeding northward to Queen Charlotte Island for trade, he there fell  in with Ingraham, formerly mate of the Columbia, but now, July 23, 1791,  in command of the Hope. The autumn was spent in trading and exploring  among the islands and along the coast to the east and north of Queen  Charlotte Island. During one trip Gray penetrated an inlet near 55 deg. N.  latitude, probably the northern extension of Vancouver Strait, to a  distance of one hundred miles to the northeastward without reaching the  end of the passage, which he supposed to be the Rio de Reyes of Admiral  Fonte. Gray's visit was most unfortunate, for a portion of his crew  landing at a port on the mainland in 55 deg. N., on August 22d, a large band  of savages fell on the party and killed Joshua Caswell, his second mate,  and seamen Joseph Barns and Job Folgier. This fatal spot was therefore  named Massacre Cove.    The attitude of the Indians was a matter of constant anxiety, so that  Gray and his crew were obliged to exercise the greatest caution in all  their intercourse with such tribes as they fell in with. In Pintard  Sound, 51 deg. 30' N., near the entrance, an attack was attempted on the  Columbia, which obliged Gray to fire on the Indians, whereby two of the  chiefs were killed, but it did not excite lasting resentment, as these  savages traded with him later as though nothing had happened.    Returning to Clyoquot, Port Cox, Vancouver Island, with the Columbia,  Gray went into winter quarters. The owners had sent out the frames for a  sloop of about thirty tons, with three carpenters to build the vessel. A  fortified habitation, called Fort Defiance, was constructed for  occupancy by the working party, which finished and launched the sloop  that winter, christening her as the Adventurer.    In the spring of 1792, while the crews of the Columbia and Adventurer  were preparing for sea they were visited by many Indians, who, through  their chiefs, established such relations with a Sandwich Islander, who  was one of the crew of the Columbia, as to excite Gray's suspicions. The  Islander on being closely questioned by Gray confessed that the Indians  had formed a plan to murder the whole party and seize the vessels, the  Hawaiian to aid them by wetting the priming of all the guns, and in  return be made a chief among the Indians. Gray took immediate steps to  keep his crew on their guard during their remaining stay, and thus  completely baffled the design of the savages without bloodshed.    In April, 1792, Gray, sending the Adventurer northward under command of  Haswell, his first mate, turned himself southward, and on the 29th fell  in with Vancouver, who was approaching the northwest coast on a voyage  of exploration in the English ship Discovery, with the Rambler under  Broughton as a consort.    Vancouver eagerly sought information from Gray as to his knowledge of  the coast, which the American gave fully and cheerfully. Gray set forth  his voyages in the Straits of Fuca, around Queen Charlotte Island, and  further, that in 1788 he had \"been off the mouth of a river, in the  latitude of 46 deg. 10', where the outset or reflux was so strong as to  prevent his entering for nine days.\" This latter information was most  surprising and distasteful to Vancouver, who, fitted out at great  expense with two vessels for exploration alone, found the accuracy of  his own observations of the coast, as recorded in his journal two days  earlier, thrown in doubt by the statements of this American trader.    Vancouver had written before meeting Gray: \"The several large rivers and  capacious inlets that have been described as discharging their contents  into the Pacific, between the fortieth and forty-eighth degrees of north  latitude, were reduced to brooks insufficient for our vessels to  navigate, or to bays inaccessible as harbors. Under the most fortunate  and favorable circumstances of wind and weather, so minutely has this  extensive coast been inspected, that the surf has been constantly seen  to break on its shores from the mast-head.\" After hearing Gray's  relation Vancouver wrote: \"If any inlet should be found, it must be a  very intricate one, and inaccessible to vessels of our burden.... I was  thoroughly convinced, as were also most persons of observation on  board, that we could not possibly have passed any safe navigable opening  harbor or place of security for shipping on this coast.\" Later Broughton  by Vancouver's orders entered and surveyed a part of the Columbia in the  latter part of October, 1792, when very much to his surprise he found  himself preceded by another American trader, Captain Baker, master of  the brig Jenny, of Bristol, R.I. Vancouver's report of the Columbia is  scarcely creditable to that great navigator, for he attempted to prove  that the mouth of the Columbia is an inlet separate from the main river,  and that Gray is consequently not entitled to the credit of discovering  the main river, a misstatement that cannot stand either in light of  Gray's journal or the hydrography of the river.    Doubtless Gray was sufficiently irritated by Vancouver's doubts and  criticisms as to the existence and navigability of the unknown river, to  cause him to again venture the dangers which had so nearly caused the  loss of his vessel on his previous visit. Of it Wilkes wrote: \"Mere  description can give little idea of the terrors of the bar of the  Columbia. All who have seen it have spoken of the wildness of the scene,  the incessant war of the waters, representing it as one of the most  fearful sights that can possibly meet the eye of the sailor.\"    Gray pursued the even tenor of his way to the southward, and within two  weeks justified his previous statements by not only entering and  navigating the Columbia, but also discovered a haven (Bulfinch or Gray  Harbor) affording safe anchorage and shelter for small vessels.    The following extracts from the log-book of the ship Columbia give the  account of Gray's discoveries in his own words:      \"1792, May 7. 10 A.M. Being within six miles of the land, saw an    entrance in land which had a very good appearance of an harbour.... At    half-past three bore away and ran in N.E. by E. sounding from 4 to 5    fathoms, sandy bottom, and as we drew nearer in between the bars had    from 10 to 12 fathoms. Having a very strong tide of ebb to stem, many    canoes came alongside, and at 5 P.M. came to in 5 fathoms of water,    sandy bottom, in a safe harbour well sheltered from the sea by long    sand-bars and spits. Our latitude observed this day 46 deg. 58' N.\" This    harbor, called Bulfinch by Gray, now properly bears the name of its    discoverer.      \"10 (May). Fresh breezes and pleasant weather. Many natives alongside,    at noon all the canoes left. At 1 P.M. began to unmoor, took up the    best bower anchor and hove short on the small anchor; at half-past    four being high water hove up the anchor and came to sail and a    beating down the harbour.      \"11. At half-past 7 we were out clear of the bar and directed our    course to the southward along shore.

With these he could pursue him through every       variety of joy and sorrow, difficulty and triumph, and, as       they were evidently written for none but her to whom they       were addressed, he could be sure that the writer spoke from       his own heart. On the literary productions of Steele, Mr.       Thackeray dwelt very little, but he pointed out in them this       peculiarity, that the author showed a reverence for woman       unknown to his contemporaries. Swift hated women just as he       hated men; Congreve regarded them as so many fortresses to       be conquered by a superior general; even Addison sneered at       them with a gentle sneer; but Steele really spoke of them in       a tone of affectionate respect, and this gives a charm to       his comedies not to be found in more brilliant productions.         \"Mr. Thackeray took occasion to illustrate by these extracts       the characteristic differences of Swift, Addison, and       Steele. He had already drawn a ludicrous picture of the       relative positions of Steele and Addison, remarking that the       latter had been through life to the former what a 'head boy'       is to an inferior boy at school. Now by Swift's poem on the       'Day of Judgment'--an extract from the _Spectator_,       containing Addison's reflections in Westminster Abbey--and a       passage from Steele, he showed how the subject of Death was       treated by the three writers. Swift's poem savagely treats       as fools all who pretend to know any thing beyond the grave,       including the teachers of the several sects. Addison's tone       was kinder, but, while he was benevolent in his skepticism,       he came to nearly the same result as the ferocious Dean.       Steele, on the other hand, was content to remember, as his       first grief, the death of his father, when he was five years       old, and the dignified sorrow of his mother.         \"By way of an additional comical apology for the foibles of       Steele, Mr. Thackeray concluded his lecture by remarking on       the atrocities of the age when poor Dick lived,--an age when       young ladies, at dinner, actually put their knives into       their mouths. The social peculiarities of the period he       illustrated by a sort of summary of Swift's _Polite       Conversation_, which led up to an ironical praise of the       nineteenth century, as a century whose anomalies are       unknown.\"    The fourth lecture on the humorists was of Prior, Gay, and Pope, Mr.  Thackeray choosing to consider Pope, who was not a humorist, but a  wit, the greatest humorist of all:         MATHEW PRIOR.         \"Prior he characterizes as the foremost of lucky wits,       abounding in good nature and acuteness. He loved--he       drank--he sang. Some verses at Cambridge first rendered him       an object of notice, and by the 'City Mouse and Country       Mouse,' which, jointly with Montague, he wrote against       Dryden, and which, Mr. Thackeray ironically asserted, all       his hearers knew, of course, by heart, he gained the post of       Secretary to the Embassy at the Hague, in accordance with       the usage then prevalent of rewarding a talent for correct       alcaics or biting epigrams with important diplomatic       appointments. However, his fortune was but transient, since       he fell with his patron Montague. As a poet, Mr. Thackeray       praised Prior highly, calling him the most charming of       English lyrists, and comparing him with Horace on one side       and Moore on the other. At the same time he referred to a       certain statement that Prior, after he had spent the evening       with the first men of the day, would retire to Long-acre to       smoke a pipe with two very intimate acquaintances--a soldier       and his wife--adding that many of his writings seemed to be       under the influence of his Long-acre friends.\"           JOHN GAY.         \"Gay was pointed out as a remarkable instance of kindliness       and good humor, gaining the love even of the most savage       wits of the day, and incurring the hatred of none. The       ferocious giant Swift loved him as the Brobdignag loved       Gulliver, and was afraid to open the packet which contained       the tidings of his death. This kindliness is an especial       feature in Gay's writings, even in his _Beggars' Opera_, and       as Rubini was said to have, 'une larme dans la voix,' so was       there in all that Gay produced a tone of the gentlest       pathos. This peculiarity he illustrated by reading the well       known story of the two devoted lovers struck dead by       lightning. As for Gay's life, it was easy enough. He failed,       indeed, to make his fortune, but he led a comfortable       existence with his noble patrons the Duke and Duchess of       Queensbury, living like a little round French _abbe_, eating       and drinking well and growing more melancholy as he       increased in fat.\"           ALEXANDER POPE.         \"For a guaranty of Pope's merits, Mr. Thackeray especially       referred to the _Rape of the Lock_ and the _Dunciad_. He       insisted on his claims to admiration as a great literary       artist, always bent on the perfection of his work and gladly       adopting the thoughts of others if they would serve to       complete his own. This peculiarity of carefulness was early       shown in the fact that Pope began by imitation. The five       happiest years of his life were devoted to the study of the       best authors, especially poets, and the intellectual       enjoyment was heightened by the feeling that genius was       throbbing in his heart and awakening within him dreams of       future glory. He too should sing--he too should love. Of       love, indeed, Pope did not make a great deal, and as his       addresses to Lady Wortley Montague were a failure, so was       his first amour a sham love for a sham mistress. A       particular pleasure in reading the works of Pope consists in       the fact that they bring the reader into the very best       company--a company whose manners are, to be sure, a little       stiff and stately, and whose voices are pitched somewhat       beyond the ordinary conversation key, but there is something       ennobling about them. _Apropos_ of this peculiarity, Mr.       Thackeray took occasion to dwell with great unction on the       advantages of high society, and said, for the benefit of any       young hearer who might be present, 'Young hearer, keep       company with your betters.' Addison, as we have seen, is Mr.       Thackeray's moral hero. He considers, however, that he has       one great blemish in his dislike of Alexander Pope. The       young poet was too conscious of his own powers to be a mere       attendant at the Court of King Joseph, and King Joseph did       not like this independence. The support given by the Addison       _clique_ to Tickell's translation of Homer might naturally       enough be construed by the Pope faction as proceeding from       an ungenerous wish to depreciate their chieftain's version,       and they might easily suppose that what was emulation in       Tickell was envy in Addison. The verses which Pope wrote on       this occasion and sent to Addison, had the satisfactory       effect that the great Joseph was civil ever afterwards. But       still Mr. Thackeray surmised that their sting was never       forgotten, and that the saintly Addison might be painted as       a Sebastian, with this one arrow sticking in him.         \"The causes that led to the writing of the _Dunciad_ were       laid down, chiefly with a view of justifying the author,       though Mr. Thackeray admitted that Pope's arrows are so       sharp, and his slaughter so wholesale, that the reader's       sympathies are often enlisted on the side of the devoted       inhabitants of Grub-street. The vile jokes and libels that       were aimed against the illustrious poet, and the paltry       allusions to his personal defects, were brought forward as       sufficient motives; and the lecturer dwelt with admiration       on the personal courage which the \"gallant little cripple\"       displayed when the indignant dunces threatened him with       corporeal chastisement. At the same time, he declared it his       conviction that the _Dunciad_ had done the greatest possible       harm to the literary profession. Prior to its publication       there were great prizes for literary men in the shape of       government appointments and the like; but Pope, a lover of       high society--a man so refined that he kept thin while his       friends grew fat--hated the rank and file of literature, and       if there was one point in his assailants on which he dwelt       with savage partiality, it was their abject poverty. He it       was who brought the notion of a vile Grub-street before the       minds of the general public; he it was who created such       associations as author and rags--author and dirt--author and       gin. The occupation of authorship became ignoble through his       graphic descriptions of misery, and the literary profession       was for a long time destroyed.         \"Pope's well known affection for his mother, on which Mr.       Thackeray feelingly expatiated, and the love which his       friends entertained for him, were introduced as a       sentimental relief in describing the character of a man       whose career Mr. Thackeray compared to that of a great       general, obtaining his end by a series of brilliant       conquests.\"           HOGARTH, SMOLLETT, AND FIELDING.         \"In his fifth lecture,\" says the _Leader_, \"Mr."]]]
