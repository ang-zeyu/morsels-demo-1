But slowly departing, my face growing sadder,      At leaving old favorites behind me so far,    A feminine voice from the foot of the ladder      Cried, \"Bring down my Cook-Book and Harper's Bazar!\"    It has been hereinbefore intimated that women may be classed among the  enemies of books. There is at least one time of the year when every  Book-Worm thinks so, and that is the dread period of  house-cleaning--sometimes in the spring, sometimes in the autumn, and  sometimes, in the case of excessively finical housewives, in both. That  is the time looked forward to by him with apprehension and looked back  upon with horror, because the poor fellow knows what comes of      CLEANING THE LIBRARY.      With traitorous kiss remarked my spouse,      \"Remain down town to lunch to-day,    For we are busy cleaning house,      And you would be in Minnie's way.\"      When I came home that fateful night,      I found within my sacred room    The wretched maid had wreaked her spite      With mop and pail and witch's broom.      The books were there, but oh how changed!      They startled me with rare surprises,    For they had all been rearranged,      And less by subjects than by sizes.      Some volumes numbered right to left,      And some were standing on their heads,    And some were of their mates bereft,      And some behind for refuge fled.      The women brave attempts had made      At placing cognate books together;--    They looked like strangers close arrayed      Under a porch in stormy weather.      She watched my face--that spouse of mine--      Some approbation there to glean,    But seeing I did not incline      To praise, remarked, \"I've got it clean.\"      And so she had--and also wrong;      She little knew--she was but thirty--    I entertained a preference strong      To have it right, though ne'er so dirty.      That wife of mine has much good sense,      To chide her would have been inhuman,    And it would be a great expense      To graft the book-sense on a woman.    Such are my reflections when I consider a fire in my own little library.  But when I regard the great and growing mass of books with which the earth  groans, and reflect how few of them are necessary or original, and how  little the greater part of them would be missed, I sometimes am led to  believe that a general conflagration of them might in the long run be a  blessing to mankind, by the stimulation of thought and the deliverance of  authors from the influence of tradition and the habit of imitation. When I  am in this mood I incline to think that much is      ODE TO OMAR.      Omar, who burned (or did not burn)      The Alexandrian tomes,    I would erect to thee an urn      Beneath Sophia's domes.      So many books I can't endure--      The dull and commonplace,    The dirty, trifling and obscure,      The realistic race.      Would that thy exemplary torch      Could bravely blaze again,    And many manufactories scorch      Of book-inditing men.      The poets who write \"dialect,\"      Maudlin and coarse by turns,    Most ardently do I expect      Thou'lt wither up with Burns.      All the erratic, yawping class      Condemn with judgment stern,    Walt Whitman's awful \"Leaves of Grass\"      With elegant Swinburne.      Of commentators make a point,      The carping, blind, and dry;    Rend the \"Baconians\" joint by joint,      And throw them on to fry.      Especially I'd have thee choke      Law libraries in sheep    With fire derived from ancient Coke,      And sink in ashes deep.      Destroy the sheep--don't save my own--      I weary of the cram,    The misplaced diligence I've shown--      But kindly spare my Lamb.      Fear not to sprinkle on the pyre      The woes of \"Esther Waters\";    They'll only make the flame soar higher,      And warn Eve's other daughters.      But 'ware of Howells and of James,      Of Trollope and his rout;    They'd dampen down the fiercest flames      And put your fire out.          XVIII.    LIBRARY COMPANIONS.      As a rule I do not care for any constant human companion in my library,  but I do not object to a cat or a small dog. That picture of Montaigne,  drawn by himself, amusing his cat with a garter, or that other one of  Doctor Johnson feeding oysters to his cat Hodge, is a very pleasing one.  In my library hangs Durer's picture of St. Jerome in his cell, busy with  his writing, and a dog and a lion quietly dozing together in the  foreground. As I am no saint I have never been able to keep a lion in my  library for any great length of time, but I have maintained a dog there.  Lamb even contended that his books were the better for being dog's-eared,  but I do not go so far as that. Nor do I pretend that his presence will  prevent the books from becoming foxed. Here is a portrait of      MY DOG.      He is a trifling, homely beast,    Of no use, or the very least;    To shake imaginary rat    Or bark for hours at china cat;    To lie at head of stairs and start,    Like animated, woolly dart,    Upon a non-existent foe;    Or on hind legs like monkey go,    To beg for sugar or for bone;    Never content to be alone;    To bask for hours in the sun.    Rolled up till head and tail are one;    Usurping all the softest places    And keeping them with doggish graces;    To sneak between the housemaid's feet    And scour unnoticed on the street;    Wag indefatigable tail;    Cajole with piteous human wail;    To dance with dainty dandy air    When nicely parted is his hair,    And look most ancient and dejected    When it has been too long neglected;    To sleep upon my book-den rug    And dream of battle with a pug;    To growl with counterfeited rabies;    To be more trouble than twin babies;--    These are the qualities and tricks    That in my heart his image fix;    And so in cursory, doggerel rhyme    I celebrate him in his time,    Nor wait his virtues to rehearse    In cold obituary verse.    There is one other speaking companion that I would tolerate in my library,  and that is a clock. I have a number of clocks in mine, and if it were not  for their unanimous and warning voice I might forget to go to bed.  Perhaps my reader would like to hear an account of      MY CLOCKS.      Five clocks adorn my domicile      And give me occupation,    For moments else inane I fill      With their due regulation.      Four of these clocks, on each Lord's Day,      As regular as preaching,    I wind and set, so that they may      The flight of time be teaching.      My grandfather's old clock is chief,      With foolish moon-faced dial;    Procrastination is a thief      It always brings to trial.      Its height is as the tallest men,      Its pendulum beats slow,    And when its awful bell booms ten,      Young men get up and go.      Another clock is bronze and gilt,      Penelope sits on it,    And in her fingers holds a quilt--      How strange 'tis not a bonnet!      Memorial of those weary years      When she the web unravelled,    While Ithacus choked down his fears      And slow from Ilium travelled.      Ceres upon the third, with spray      Of grain, in classic gown,    Seems sadly to recall the day      Proserpine sank down,      With scarcely time to say good-bye,      Unto the world of Dis;    And keeps account, with many a sigh,      Of harvest time in this.      Another clock is rococo,      Of Louis Sept or Seize,    With many a dreadful furbelow      An artist's hair to raise,      Suggestions of a giddy court,      With fan and boufflant bustle,    When silken trains made gallant sport      And o'er the floor did rustle.      The fourth was brought, in foolish trust      From Alpland far away,    A baby clock, and so it must      Be tended every day.      Importunate and trivial thing!      Thou katydid of clocks!    Defying all my skill to bring      Right time from out thy box.      With works of wood and face of brass      On which queer cherubs play,    The tedious hours thou well dost pass,      And none thy chirp gainsay.    Among the silent companions in my study are the effigies of the four  greatest geniuses of modern times in the realms of literature, art, music  and war--a print of Shakespeare; one of Michael Angelo's corrugated face  with its broken nose; a bust of Beethoven, resembling a pouting lion; and  a print of Napoleon at St. Helena, representing him dressed in a white  duck suit, with a broad-brimmed straw hat, and sitting looking seaward,  with those unfathomable eyes, a newspaper lying in his lap. Unhappy  faces all except the first--his cheerful, probably because he has effected  an arrangement with an otherwise idle person, named Bacon, to do all his  work for him. But there is another portrait, at which I look oftener, the  original of which probably takes more interest in me, but is unknown to  every visitor to my study. I myself have not seen her in half a century.  I call it simply      A PORTRAIT.      A gentle face is ever in my room,      With features fine and melancholy eyes,    Though young, a little past life's freshest bloom,      And always with air of sad surmise.      A great white cap almost conceals her hair,      A collar broad falls o'er her shoulders slender;    The fashion of a bygone age an air      Of quaintness to her simple garb doth render.      Those hazel eyes pursue me as I move      And seem to watch my busy toiling pen;    They hold me with an anxious yearning love,      As if she dwelt upon the earth again.      My mother's portrait! fifty years ago,      When I was but a heedless happy boy,    The influence of her being ceased to flow,      And she laid down life's burden and its joy.      And now as I sit"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36844"],[0,"In New England Fields and Woods (#14)"],[1,"knolls, logs, stumps, mud holes, brambles and all the inanimate  enemies that lie in wait for man when he hastens in the dark, combine to  trip, bump, bruise, sprain, scratch, and bemire the hurrying hunters.    Then when all have gathered at the centre of attraction, where the  excited hounds are raving about the boll of some great tree, the best  and boldest climber volunteers to go aloft into the upper darkness and  shake the quarry down or shoot him if may be. If he succeeds in  accomplishing the difficult task, what a melee ensues when the coon  crashes through the branches to the ground and becomes the erratic  centre of the wild huddle of dogs and men.    Fewer voices never broke the stillness of night with sounds more  unearthly than the medley of raging, yelping, growling, cheering, and  vociferous orders given forth by dogs, coon, and hunters, while hillside  and woodland toss to and fro a more discordant badinage of echo. The  coon is not a great beast, but a tough and sharp-toothed one, who  carries beneath his gray coat and fat ribs a stout heart and wonderful  vitality; and a tussle with a veteran of the tribe of cornfield robbers  tests the pluck of the dogs.    If the coon takes refuge in a tree too tall and limbless for his  pursuers to climb, there is nothing for them but to keep watch and ward  till daylight discovers him crouched on his lofty perch. A huge fire  enlivens the long hours of guard keeping. A foraging party repairs to  the nearest cornfield for roasting ears, and the hunters shorten the  slow nighttide with munching scorched corn, sauced by joke and song and  tales of the coon hunts of bygone years.    The waning moon throbs into view above a serrated hill-crest, then  climbs the sky, while the shadows draw eastward, then pales in the dawn,  and when it is like a blotch of white cloud in the zenith, a sunrise gun  welcomes day and brings the coon tumbling to earth. Or perhaps not a  coon, but some vagrant house cat is the poor reward of the long watch.  Then the weary hunters plod homeward to breakfast and to nail their  trophies to the barn door.    When the sweet acorns, dropping in the frosty night, tempt the coon to a  later feast, there is as good sport and primer peltry. In any of the  nights wherein this sport may be pursued, the man of lazy mould and  contemplative mind loves best the hunt deemed unsuccessful by the more  ardent hunters, when the hounds strike the trail of a wandering fox and  carry a tide of wild music, flooding and ebbing over valley and hilltop,  while the indolent hunter reclines at ease, smoking his pipe and  listening, content to let more ambitious hunters stumble over ledges and  wallow through swamps.    When winter begins, the coon retires for a long and comfortable sleep,  warmly clothed in fur and fat. A great midwinter thaw awakens him,  fooled out of a part of his nap by the siren song of the south wind, and  he wanders forth in quest of something. If food, he never finds it, and  as far as I have been able to determine, does not even seek it. I should  imagine, reading the record of his journey as he prints it in his course  from hollow tree or hollow ledge to other hollow trees and hollow  ledges, that he had been awakened to a sense of loneliness and was  seeking old friends in familiar haunts, with whom to talk over last  year's cornfield raids and frogging parties in past summer  nights--perchance to plan future campaigns. Or is it an inward fire and  no outward warmth that has thawed him into this sudden activity? Has he,  like many of his biggers and betters, gone a-wooing in winter nights?    At such times the thrifty hunter who has an eye more to profit and prime  peltry than to sport, goes forth armed only with an axe. Taking the  track of the wanderers, he follows it to their last tarrying place. If  it be a cave, they are safe except from the trap when they come forth to  begin another journey; but if it is a hollow tree, woe betide the poor  wretches. The hunter saps the foundation of their castle, and when it  crashes to its fall he ignominiously knocks the dazed inmates on the  head. It is fashionable for others to wear the coat which becomes the  raccoon much better than them and which once robbed of he can never  replace.    During the spring and early summer little is seen of the raccoon. His  tracks may be found on a sandy shore or margin of a brook and  occasionally his call can be heard, if indeed it be his, but beyond  these he gives little evidence of his existence. There must be nocturnal  excursions for food, but for the most part old and young abide in their  rocky fortress or wooden tower. They are reported to be a playful  family, and the report is confirmed by the pranks of domesticated  members of it. Sometimes there will be found in one of their ravaged  homes a rounded gnarl worn smooth with much handling or pawing, the  sole furniture of the house and evidently a plaything.    This little brother of the bear is one of the few remaining links that  connect us with the old times, when there were trees older than living  men, when all the world had not entered for the race to gain the prize  of wealth, or place, or renown; when it was the sum of all happiness for  some of us to \"go a-coonin'.\" It is pleasant to see the track of this  midnight prowler, this despoiler of cornfields, imprinted in the mud of  the lane or along the soft margin of the brook, to know that he  survives, though he may not be the fittest. When he has gone forever,  those who outlive him will know whether it was his quavering note that  jarred the still air of the early fall evenings or if it was only the  voice of the owl--if he too shall not then have gone the inevitable way  of all the wild world.          XXIX    THE RELUCTANT CAMP-FIRE      The depressing opposite of the fire that is the warm heart of the camp  is the pile of green or rain-soaked fuel that in spite of all coaxing  and nursing refuses to yield a cheerful flame. Shavings from the  resin-embalmed heart of a dead pine and scrolls of birch bark fail to  enkindle it to more than flicker and smoke, while the wet and hungry  campers brood forlornly over the cheerless centre of their temporary  home, with watery eyes and souls growing sick of camp life.    Night is falling, and the shadows of the woods thicken into solid gloom  that teems with mysterious horrors, which stretch their intangible claws  through the darkness to chill the backs of the timid with an icy touch,  and the silence is terrible with unuttered howlings of imaginary beasts.    Each one is ready to blame the other for the common discomfort, and all,  the high priest, who so far fails to kindle the altar fire. He is an  impostor, who should be smothered in the reek of his own failure. Yet,  as the group regard him with unkind glances and mutterings of  disapproval, he perseveres, feeding the faint flame with choice morsels  of fat wood and nursing it with his breath, his bent face and puffed  cheeks now a little lightened, now fading into gloom, till suddenly the  sullenness of the reluctant fuel is overcome, wings of flame flutter up  the column of smoke, and the black pile leaps into a lurid tower of  light, from whose peak a white banner of smoke flaunts upward, saluted  by the waving boughs that it streams among.    Tent and shanty, familiar trees, and moving figures with their circle of  grotesque, dancing shadows, spring into sudden existence out of the  blank darkness. The magic touch of the firelight dispels every sullen  look, warms every heart to genial comradeship; jokes flash back and  forth merrily, and the camp pulses again with reawakened cheerful life.  Verily, fire worketh wonders in divers ways.          XXX    SEPTEMBER DAYS      September days have the warmth of summer in their briefer hours, but in  their lengthening evenings a prophetic breath of autumn. The cricket  chirps in the noontide, making the most of what remains of his brief  life; the bumblebee is busy among the clover blossoms of the aftermath;  and their shrill cry and dreamy hum hold the outdoor world above the  voices of the song birds, now silent or departed.    What a little while ago they were our familiars, noted all about us in  their accustomed haunts--sparrow, robin, and oriole, each trying now and  then, as if to keep it in memory, a strain of his springtime love song,  and the cuckoo fluting a farewell prophecy of rain. The bobolinks, in  sober sameness of traveling gear, still held the meadowside thickets of  weeds; and the swallows sat in sedate conclave on the barn ridge.  Then, looking and listening for them, we suddenly become aware they are  gone; the adobe city of the eave-dwellers is silent and deserted; the  whilom choristers of the sunny summer meadows are departed to a less  hospitable welcome in more genial climes. How unobtrusive was their  exodus. We awake and miss them, or we think of them and see them not,  and then we realize that with them summer too has gone.    This also the wafted thistledown and the blooming asters tell us, and,  though the woods are dark with their latest greenness, in the lowlands  the gaudy standard of autumn is already displayed. In its shadow the  muskrat is thatching his winter home, and on his new-shorn watery lawn  the full-fledged wild duck broods disport in fullness of feather and  strength of pinion. Evil days are these of September that now befall  them. Alack, for the callow days of peaceful summer, when no honest  gunner was abroad, and the law held the murderous gun in abeyance, and  only the keel of the unarmed angler rippled the still channel.  Continual unrest and abiding fear are their lot now and henceforth, till  spring brings the truce of close time to their persecuted race.    More silently than the fisher's craft the skiff of the sportsman now  invades the rush-paled thoroughfares. Noiseless as ghosts, paddler and  shooter glide along the even"]]]
