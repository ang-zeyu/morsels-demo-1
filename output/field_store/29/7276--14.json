Abandon the first floor, acid bombs can't reach.\"    \"If we hold we'll be cut off, but salient is past us on the west flank.  Request support.\"    \"DON'T MERVV ... IT'S USELESS!\"    \"... And the napalm tanks are almost gone. Orders?\"    \"The truck is still there, get it to the supply warehouse, you'll find  replacements ...\"           *       *       *       *       *    Out of the welter of talk, only the last two fragments made any sense.  Jason had noticed the signs below when he came in. The first two floors  of the building below him were jammed with military supplies. This was  his chance to get into the act.    Just sitting and watching was frustrating. Particularly when it was a  desperate emergency. He didn't overvalue his worth, but he was sure  there was always room for another gun.    By the time he had dragged himself down to the street level a  turbo-truck had slammed to a stop in front of the loading platform. Two  Pyrrans were rolling out drums of napalm with reckless disregard for  their own safety. Jason didn't dare enter that maelstrom of rolling  metal. He found he could be of use tugging the heavy drums into position  on the truck while the others rolled them up. They accepted his aid  without acknowledgment.    It was exhausting, sweaty work, hauling the leaden drums into place  against the heavy gravity. After a minute Jason worked by touch through  a red haze of hammering blood. He realized the job was done only when  the truck suddenly leaped forward and he was thrown to the floor. He lay  there, his chest heaving. As the driver hurled the heavy vehicle along,  all Jason could do was bounce around in the bottom. He could see well  enough, but was still gasping for breath when they braked at the  fighting zone.    To Jason, it was a scene of incredible confusion. Guns firing, flames,  men and women running on all sides. The napalm drums were unloaded  without his help and the truck vanished for more. Jason leaned against a  wall of a half-destroyed building and tried to get his bearings. It was  impossible. There seemed to be a great number of small animals: he  killed two that attacked him. Other than that he couldn't determine the  nature of the battle.    A Pyrran, tan face white with pain and exertion, stumbled up. His right  arm, wet with raw flesh and dripping blood, hung limply at his side. It  was covered with freshly applied surgical foam. He held his gun in his  left hand, a stump of control cable dangling from it. Jason thought the  man was looking for medical aid. He couldn't have been more wrong.    Clenching the gun in his teeth, the Pyrran clutched a barrel of napalm  with his good hand and hurled it over on its side. Then, with the gun  once more in his hand, he began to roll the drum along the ground with  his feet. It was slow, cumbersome work, but he was still in the fight.    Jason pushed through the hurrying crowd and bent over the drum. \"Let me  do it,\" he said. \"You can cover us both with your gun.\"    The man wiped the sweat from his eyes with the back of his arm and  blinked at Jason. He seemed to recognize him. When he smiled it was a  grimace of pain, empty of humor. \"Do that. I can still shoot. Two half  men--maybe we equal one whole.\" Jason was laboring too hard to even  notice the insult.           *       *       *       *       *    An explosion had blasted a raw pit in the street ahead. Two people were  at the bottom, digging it even deeper with shovels. The whole thing  seemed meaningless. Just as Jason and the wounded man rolled up the drum  the diggers leaped out of the excavation and began shooting down into  its depths. One of them turned, a young girl, barely in her teens.    \"Praise Perimeter!\" she breathed. \"They found the napalm. One of the new  horrors is breaking through towards Thirteen, we just found it.\" Even as  she talked she swiveled the drum around, kicked the easy-off plug, and  began dumping the gelid contents into the hole. When half of it had  gurgled down, she kicked the drum itself in. Her companion pulled a  flare from his belt, lit it, and threw it after the drum.    [Illustration]    \"Back quick. They don't like heat,\" he said.    This was putting it very mildly. The napalm caught, tongues of flame and  roiling, greasy smoke climbed up to the sky. Under Jason's feet the  earth shifted and moved. _Something_ black and long stirred in the heart  of the flame, then arched up into the sky over their heads. In the midst  of the searing heat it still moved with alien, jolting motions. It was  immense, at least two meters thick and with no indication of its length.  The flames didn't stop it at all, just annoyed it.    Jason had some idea of the thing's length as the street cracked and  buckled for fifty meters on each side of the pit. Great loops of the  creature began to emerge from the ground. He fired his gun, as did the  others. Not that it seemed to have any effect. More and more people were  appearing, armed with a variety of weapons. Flame-throwers and grenades  seemed to be the most effective.    \"_Clear the area ... we're going to saturate it. Fall back._\"    The voice was so loud it jarred Jason's ear. He turned and recognized  Kerk, who had arrived with truckloads of equipment. He had a power  speaker on his back, the mike hung in front of his lips. His amplified  voice brought an instant reaction from the crowd. They began to move.    There was still doubt in Jason's mind what to do. Clear the area? But  what area? He started towards Kerk, before he realized that the rest of  the Pyrrans were going in the opposite direction. Even under two  gravities they _moved_.    Jason had a naked feeling of being alone on the stage. He was in the  center of the street, and the others had vanished. No one remained.  Except the wounded man Jason had helped. He stumbled towards Jason,  waving his good arm. Jason couldn't understand what he said. Kerk was  shouting orders again from one of the trucks. They had started to move  too. The urgency struck home and Jason started to run.    It was too late. On all sides the earth was buckling, cracking, as more  loops of the underground thing forced its way into the light. Safety lay  ahead. Only in front of it rose an arch of dirt-encrusted gray.           *       *       *       *       *    There are seconds of time that seem to last an eternity. A moment of  subjective time that is grabbed and stretched to an infinite distance.  This was one of those moments. Jason stood, frozen. Even the smoke in  the sky hung unmoving. The high-standing loop of alien life was before  him, every detail piercingly clear.    Thick as a man, ribbed and gray as old bark. Tendrils projected from all  parts of it, pallid and twisting lengths that writhed slowly with  snakelike life. Shaped like a plant, yet with the motions of an animal.  And cracking, splitting. This was the worst.    Seams and openings appeared. Splintering, gaping mouths that vomited out  a horde of pallid animals. Jason heard their shriekings, shrill yet  remote. He saw the needlelike teeth that lined their jaws.    The paralysis of the unknown held him there. He should have died. Kerk  was thundering at him through the power speaker, others were firing into  the attacking creature. Jason knew nothing.    Then he was shot forward, pushed by a rock-hard shoulder. The wounded  man was still there, trying to get Jason clear. Gun clenched in his jaws  he dragged Jason along with his good arm. Towards the creature. The  others stopped firing. They saw his plan and it was a good one.    A loop of the thing arched into the air, leaving an opening between its  body and the ground. The wounded Pyrran planted his feet and tightened  his muscles. One-handed, with a single thrust, he picked Jason off the  ground and sent him hurtling under the living arch. Moving tendrils  brushed fire along his face, then he was through, rolling over and over  on the ground. The wounded Pyrran leaped after him.    It was too late. There had been a chance for one person to get out. The  Pyrran could have done it easily--instead he had pushed Jason first. The  thing was aware of movement when Jason brushed its tendrils. It dropped  and caught the wounded man under its weight. He vanished from sight as  the tendrils wrapped around him and the animals swarmed over. His  trigger must have pulled back to full automatic because the gun kept  firing a long time after he should have been dead.    Jason crawled. Some of the fanged animals ran towards him, but were  shot. He knew nothing about this. Then rude hands grabbed him up and  pulled him forward. He slammed into the side of a truck and Kerk's face  was in front of his, flushed and angry. One of the giant fists closed on  the front of Jason's clothes and he was lifted off his feet, shaken like  a limp bag of rags. He offered no protest and could not have even if  Kerk had killed him.    When he was thrown to the ground, someone picked him up and slid him  into the back of the truck. He did not lose consciousness as the truck  bounced away, yet he could not move. In a moment the fatigue would go  away and he would sit up. That was all he was, just a little tired. Even  as he thought this he passed out.          XIII.      \"Just like old times,\" Jason said when Brucco came into the room with a  tray of food. Without a word Brucco served Jason and the wounded men in  the other beds, then left. \"Thanks,\" Jason called after his retreating  back.    A joke, a twist of a grin, like it always was. Sure. But even as he  grinned and his lips shaped a joke, Jason felt them like a veneer on  the outside. Something plastered on with a life of its own. Inside he  was numb and immovable. His body was stiff as his eyes still watched  that arch of alien flesh descend and smother the one-armed Pyrran with  its million burning fingers.    He could feel himself"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28402"],[0,"The Sexual Life of the Child (#14)"],[1,"of masturbation. Nurses sometimes touch, stroke, and stimulate the  external genital organs of the children entrusted to their care--boys  and girls alike--either to keep them quiet, or for the gratification of  their own lustful feelings. In this way the child, who in the case of  all agreeable sensations has a natural desire for their repetition, is  gradually led to imitate the manipulations which have given rise to the  voluptuous sensations, and is thus seduced to the practice of  masturbation.    In the preceding passages I have spoken of all kinds of mechanical  stimulation of the genital organs, and also of erections[25] occurring  in small children. I now pass on to consider ejaculation. Whereas during  normal intercourse in the sexually mature man and woman a fluid  secretion is expelled, nothing of the kind is possible in children, at  least such is the general opinion. Frequently, indeed, as regards the  male sex, the end of childhood, properly speaking, is supposed to be  indicated by the first ejaculation of semen. Matters are, however, by no  means so simple as this. We have seen that the testicular secretion, the  most important constituent of the semen, consists, as Fuerbringer[26] has  pointed out, almost entirely of spermatozoa. But how is it in the case  of children? The spermatozoa may be first formed at very varying ages.  According to the investigations of Mantegazza,[27] they rarely make  their appearance earlier than the eighteenth year of life. Fuerbringer  does not unconditionally accept this view; but he has himself, as he has  personally informed me, examined boys at ages of fifteen to sixteen in  whom the ejaculation was entirely devoid of spermatozoa. But, on the  other hand, he has found spermatozoa in the semen of a boy aged only  twelve or thirteen years. I have myself examined the emissions of boys  in a considerable number of cases, and have repeatedly found that, even  in the case of boys of sixteen, the ejaculated secretions contained no  spermatozoa. The reports of other investigators also show that as  regards this point very wide individual variations occur. Hofmann[28]  has contributed some data to this discussion. A case published by Klose,  in which pregnancy is alleged to have resulted from intercourse with a  boy aged nine years, is, indeed, regarded by Hofmann as probably  apocryphal. But he had personal knowledge of a case in which a woman was  impregnated by a boy fourteen years of age. He assumes that when a boy's  general development is advanced (masculine habit of body, large penis,  &c.), his reproductive capacity will also make its appearance at an  earlier age. But he has met with exceptions to this generalisation.  Thus, in the post-mortem examination of the body of a boy aged fourteen,  whose physique was still quite infantile, he found well-developed  spermatozoa both in the testicles and in the seminal vesicles. In the  case of two boys aged fifteen years, in whom the genital organs were  powerfully developed, he found in one abundant spermatozoa, but in the  other none at all. In two other boys, also fifteen years of age, in whom  the pubic hair had not yet appeared, spermatozoa were present. They were  absent, again, in a young man of eighteen years. Similar variations were  found by Haberda. Thus, for example, in two boys aged fifteen and  seventeen years, respectively, he found no spermatozoa, notwithstanding  the fact that in both the pubic hair had grown. On the other hand, in a  boy aged 13-3/4 years, with an abundance of pubic hair, numerous  well-developed spermatozoa were present. Haberda is of opinion that,  speaking generally, the first formation of the spermatozoa is associated  with the appearance of the other indications of puberty. The earliest  authenticated age at which spermotozoa have been known to appear is  13-1/2 years; they have been found at this age by two separate  investigators, one in Paris, the other in Berlin. Notwithstanding the  fact that, as we have seen, such extensive variations occur, we are  justified in making the general statement that in the case of children  in our own country no spermatozoa are developed; if exceptions ever  occur, they can relate only to the last year or year and a half of the  second period of childhood.    We must now proceed to ask whether it is possible for ejaculation to  occur in children at a time of life when the formation of spermatozoa in  the testicles has not yet begun; this question must be answered with an  unconditional affirmative. We have seen that the secretions of several  other glands intermingle with the secretion of the testicles. These  glands are the following: the prostate gland, the glands of the vesiculae  seminales and the vasa deferentia, the glands of Cowper, and the glands  of Littre. It is certain that these glands begin to secrete at different  times, and, above all, that some of them begin to secrete before  spermatozoa have appeared in the testicles. Hence it is rightly believed  that the capacity for coitus (_potentia coeundi_) develops much earlier  than the capacity for procreation (_potentia generandi_)--a fact which  was well known to Zacchias.[29] _Quae enim hanc juventutem vel praecedunt  aetates, vel sequuntur aut plane semen non effundunt aut certe  infoecundum aut male foecundum effundunt._ Strassmann[30] considers  that in our climate the capacity for procreation begins at the earliest  at the end of the fifteenth year, and the capacity for coitus at the end  of the thirteenth year. In a number of cases in which in children I  found stains on the underclothing, or in some other way obtained  specimens of the ejaculated fluid, the results of the examination for  spermatozoa were entirely negative. In a case which came under my notice  a long time ago, that of a child seven years of age, I had assumed that  the fluid with which the underclothing was stained was produced by  inflammatory irritation of the urethra consequent upon masturbation.  Subsequent experience, however, in conjunction with the observations of  other investigators, has led me to the firm conviction that even in our  climate we do not need to invoke the idea of such inflammatory  irritation of the urethra in order to account for the ejaculation of  fluid by children--at any rate when these are approaching the end of the  second period of childhood. In the case of twelve-year-old boys, I  believe that such ejaculations of fluid occur in quite a large number of  cases. One instance, which did not come under my own observation, but  was communicated to me by one of our best-known educationalists, relates  to a boy only ten years of age. This boy, endeavouring to climb over a  fence, repeatedly slipped back; while thus engaged, he experienced his  first seminal emission. In this way he then masturbated several  times.[31]    Let us now consider whence the ejaculated fluid can be derived prior to  the age at which it comes to contain spermatozoa. In the first place, it  is possible that the testicles themselves, before they begin to form the  spermatozoa, may yet furnish an indifferent secretion, although in the  adult the secretion of the testicles consists chiefly of the  spermatozoa. We have also to consider the glands previously enumerated,  whose secretions normally form constituents of the semen. We possess,  however, hardly any trustworthy information regarding the time at which  the glands of the vasa deferentia begin to secrete. The glands of  Cowper, as Henle[32] showed many years ago, begin to secrete within a  few weeks after birth. He believed that these glands secreted  continuously, but that the secretion was retained for a time in the  ducts, and was discharged intermittently with the urine. For this reason  he believed that the glands of Cowper did not form a part of the  reproductive system. Subsequent investigations, however, have led us to  believe that the secretion of Cowper's glands is one of the constituents  of the semen. Another constituent is the secretion of the glands of  Littre, and these glands also perhaps begin to secrete at a much earlier  age than the testicles. We may regard it as certain that the seminal  vesicles may contain secretion before any spermatozoa are formed in the  testicles. As regards the prostate gland, it is supposed that this  first begins to secrete at the commencement of the age of puberal  development or even later. According to the data collected by Frisch,  the prostate gland, comparatively small in childhood, first begins to  grow quickly at the epoch of the puberal development. During childhood,  the gland tissue is comparatively scanty, although it already contains  concretions. Only during the puberal development does the prostate gland  attain its full size; according to the researches of Englisch, who  observed 1282 instances, this does not occur until after the full  development of the testicles. Beyond question we are justified, from the  information at our disposal, in concluding that the prostate gland  begins to secrete comparatively late. But, on the other hand, it is  equally clear that certain glands whose secretion in the adult forms  part of the semen, begin to secrete long before any spermatozoa have  been formed in the testicles, and may in this way give rise to the  formation of a semen incapable of fertilising the ovum.    In respect of the extrusion of the fluid, we have to recognise two  different ways in which this is effected: first, ejaculation, due to a  rhythmical expulsive movement; and secondly, the _urethrorrhoea ex  libidine_ met with in adults, of which an account was given in the  second chapter (p. 22). In my own investigations on the subject, I have  been able to learn nothing regarding the occurrence in children of any  _urethrorrhoea ex libidine_; and my information relates only to the  true ejaculation of a fluid, I have seen a few cases in which such  ejaculation occurred in boys"]]]
