In form it approaches nearest to _Conus vitulinus_ of Bruguiere, having the  spire not quite depressed, each volution being slightly raised above the  last, gradually to the apex; the upper margin of the body whorl is convex:  each volution of the spire has a broad and deep groove nearest the upper  edge, which thus becomes elevated, while the convexity of the lower part of  the whorl forms a channel round the suture, which separates it from the  next; this formation of the spire is very remarkable, and unlike what I  have seen in any other Cone. Another distinguishing character is, that the  whole shell is crossed by very faint, broad, and almost imperceptible  punctured lines, very near each other; in some parts discernible with the  naked eye, in others almost obliterated by the longitudinal lines of  growth: the granulations towards the base are very sharp and nearly white,  and the base itself crossed with rough, thick-set, elevated striae. No  doubt the colour of this species will be found to vary, when more specimens  are discovered. The only one I have ever seen, came with some other very  rare shells from Amboyna, and is in my own collection.    If the descriptions of _C. canaliculatus_ (Malacanus Brug.) be correct,  (for it is a shell I have not seen), it must be quite distinct.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 115    [Illustration]    PLATYRHYNCHUS cancromus. fem.    _Short-tailed Flatbill._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Platyrhinchos_, Temminck. _Sw.

Though a native of  Brazil, I never met with it during my travels in that country; and the only  specimen I have yet seen belongs to Mr. Leadbeater. The figure of _P.  cancromus_ of Professor Temminck, differing only from this bird in having a  yellow crest, leads me to believe they are sexes of the same species; this  being the female bird. The tail in the male appears to be somewhat longer,  but this may be an error of delineation, and the description has not yet  been published.    The figure is of the natural size, and below is an outline of the bill and  nostrils; these latter are depressed, and the base covered with thickset  feathers; the aperture is naked, round, and piercing the membrane in a  lateral direction, midway between the ridge and margin of the bill, and at  the end of the nasal membrane. The plumage above fulvous brown: darker, and  tinged with reddish on the margin of the quills and tips of the wing  covers: spurious quills and stripe beneath the eyes black: the upper part  of the ears are also black, the lower half whitish yellow; chin and throat  whitish; breast and body beneath pale fulvous brown; tail remarkably short,  and not projecting beyond the wings; upper mandible black, lower white.    Since the publication of the remarks on this genus at Plate 14, a further  consideration of the subject induces me to adopt the opinion of Professor  Temminck, in placing the _Todus Platyrhynchos_, Gm., and its allies, under  a distinct genus; or, in other words, of detaching from this group the  second division annexed to my former definition of this genus. Still,  however, the close affinities I have there pointed out, render the generic  situation of several of these birds very doubtful; because the transition  from one to the other is so gradual that even the most accurate set of  generic characters, founded on the bill, will not clearly define the limits  between the genera _Platyrhynchus_ and _Muscipeta_. Their anatomy might do  so, but on this subject we are quite ignorant.    I can gather nothing from the characters which Dr. Horsfield has given in  the Linnaean Transactions of his new genus _Eurylaimos_; which does not  perfectly agree with those of _Platyrhynchus_. It appears to have precisely  the same formation of bill, nostrils, legs, &c. as _P. cancromus_, but in a  higher state of development; thus strengthening the opinion I have above  expressed.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 116    [Illustration]    MUSCIPETA barbata,    _Whiskered Flycatcher._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Rostrum latum, valde depressum, lateribus aliquando dilatatis, culmine      prominente, mandibulae superioris apice adunco, plerumque emarginato,      marginibus mandibulae planae inferioris margines superplicantibus.

The same bird appears, however, more  frequent in Cayenne, according to the older ornithologists. But whether the  bird described by them as the female be really such, admits of great doubt,  because Dr. Latham (probably on the authority of Buffon) describes it as  having a smaller bill, and a few short hairs, instead of long bristles, at  the base; the crown with a spot of yellow, a longer tail, &c. None of these  are, in general, sexual distinctions, and, moreover, are at complete  variance with the female here figured. The sexes I ascertained by  dissection. It follows, therefore, that either the bird found in Cayenne is  a distinct species, or that the bird described as its female is not such in  reality. This latter supposition I apprehend is nearest the truth.    The figures are of the natural size, the upper representing the female, and  the lower the male bird: the head of the former is entirely destitute of  the crest which distinguishes the latter; in every other respect the  resemblance is uniform. This crest, when not erected, is concealed, being  nearly covered by the olive feathers around it. When erected, however, it  discloses a stripe down the middle of the head of deep straw-coloured  feathers, some of which are tipped with olive. The upper mandible of the  bill is triangular, and much hooked, notched, and depressed; the colour is  black, the perforations of the nostrils are rather large, and would be  naked, were they not partially covered by numerous stiff bristles, which  spring from the base of the bill and angle of the mouth; between the eye  and bill a pale stripe. The plumage above is dull olive green, with a broad  band of very pale yellow across the rump.

Startled by  the cars, the dogs were scampering in all directions, when a powerful  chicken-hawk shot down among them with such wonderful rapidity of flight  that his shadow, which fell like that from a flying fragment of cloud,  scarcely seemed to reach the earth before him. Some hundreds of the  little brown fellows were running for dear life, and plunging wildly  into their holes without any manifestations of their usual curiosity.  The hawk's shadow fell on one fat, burgher-like dog, perhaps the mayor  of the town, and in an instant the robber of the air was over him and  the talons fastened in his back. Then the bird of prey beat heavily with  its pinions, rising a few feet, but, finding the prize too heavy, came  down. He was evidently frightened at the noise of the cars and we hoped  the prisoner would escape. But the bird, clutching firmly for an instant  the animal in its talons, drew back his head to give force to the blow,  and down clashed the hooked beak into one of the victim's eyes. A sharp  pull, and the eyeball was plucked out. Back went the beak a second time,  and the remaining eye was torn from its socket, and the sightless body  was then left squirming on the ground, while the hawk flew hastily away  a short distance, evidently to return when we had passed on. It was  pitiful to see the dog raise up on its haunches and for an instant sit  facing us with its empty sockets, then make two or three short runs to  find a path, in its sudden darkness, to some hole of refuge, but  fruitlessly, of course.    A few days afterward, at Hays City, we witnessed an affair in which the  air-pirate got worsted. While sitting before the office of the village  doctor, a powerful hawk pounced upon his favorite kitten, which lay  asleep on the grass, and started off with it. The two had reached an  elevation of fifty feet, when puss recovered from her surprise and went  to work for liberty. She had always been especially addicted to dining  on birds, and the sensation of being carried off by one excited the  feline mind to astonishment and wrath. Twisting herself like a weasel  her claws came uppermost, and to our straining gaze there was a sight  presented very much as if a feather-bed had been ripped open. The  surprised hawk had evidently received new light on the subject; it let  go on the instant, and went off with the appearance of a badly plucked  goose, while the cat came safely to earth and sought the nearest way  home.

WE SEE BUFFALO--ARRIVAL AT HAYS--GENERAL SHERIDAN AT THE       FORT--INDIAN MURDERS--BLOOD-CHRISTENING OF THE PACIFIC       RAILROAD--SURPRISED BY A BUFFALO HERD--A BUFFALO BULL IN A       QUANDARY--GENTLE ZEPHYRS--HOW A CIRCUS WENT OFF--BOLOGNA TO LEAN       ON--A CALL UPON SHERIDAN.      As we passed out of the dog village, the engine gave several short,  sharp whistles, and numberless heads were at once thrust out to  ascertain the cause. \"Buffalo!\" was the cry, and with this there was a  rush to the windows for a view of the noblest of American game. Even  sleepy elderly gentlemen jostled rudely, and Sachem forgot his liver so  far as to crowd into a favorable position beside a young woman.    \"There they go!\" \"Oh, my, what monsters!\" \"What beards!\" \"What horns!\"  \"Beats a steeplechase!\" \"Uncanny beasts, lookin' and gangin' like Nick!\"  \"Sure, they're going home from a divil's wake!\" and similar ejaculations  filled the car, as they do a race-stand when the horses are off. Two  huge bulls had crossed just ahead of the engine, and one of them,  apparently deeming escape impossible, was standing at bay close to the  track, head down for a charge. He was furious with terror, the hissing  steam and cow-catcher having been close at his heels for a hundred  yards. As we flew past he was immediately under our windows, and we were  obliged to look down to get a view of his immense body, with the back  curving up gradually from the tail into an uncouth hump over the fore  shoulders.    These two solitary old fellows were the only buffalo we saw from the  train, the herds at large having not yet commenced their southern  journey. At certain seasons, however, they cover the plains on each side  of the road for fifty or sixty miles in countless multitudes. These wild  cattle of Uncle Samuel's, if called upon, could supply the whole Yankee  nation with meat for an indefinite period.    About noon we arrived at Hays City, two hundred and eighty miles from  the eastern border of the State, and eighty miles out upon the plains. A  stream tolerably well timbered, known as Big Creek, runs along the  southern edge of the town, and just across it lies Fort Hays, town and  fort being less than a mile apart.    The post possessed considerable military importance, being the base of  operations for the Indian country. We found Sheridan there, an officer  who won his fame gallantly and on the gallop. During the summer our red  brethren had been gathering a harvest of scalps, and, in return, our  army was now preparing to gather in the gentle savage.    We had read accounts in the newspapers, some time before, of the capture  of Fort Wallace and of attacks on military posts. Such stories were not  only untrue, but exceedingly ridiculous as well. Lo is not sound on the  assault question. His chivalrous soul warms, however, when some forlorn  Fenian, with spade on shoulder and thoughts far off with Biddy in  Erin's Isle, crosses his vision. Being satisfied that Patrick has no  arms, his only defense being utter harmlessness, and well knowing that  the sight of a painted skin, rendered sleek by boiled dog's meat, will  make him frantic with terror, the soul of the noble savage expands. No  more shall the spade, held so jauntily, throw Kansas soil on the bed of  the Pacific Railroad; and the scalp, yet tingling with the boiling of  incipient Fenian revolutions underneath, on the pole of a distant wigwam  will soon gladden the eyes of the traditionally beautiful Indian bride,  as with dirty hands she throws tender puppies into the pot for her  warrior's feast. The savage hand, crimson since childhood, descends with  defiant ring upon the tawny breast, and, with a cry of, \"Me big Indian,  ha, whoop!\" down sweeps Lo upon the defenseless Hibernian. A startled  stare, a shriek of wild agony, a hurried prayer to \"our Mary mother,\"  and Erin's son christens those far-off points of the Pacific Railroad  with his blood. A rapid circle of hunting-knife and the scalp is lifted,  a few twangs of the bow fills the body with arrows, there is a rapid  vault into the saddle, and a mutilated corpse, with feathered tips, like  pins in a cushion, dotting its surface, alone remains to tell the tale  of horror.    [Illustration: \"And Erin's son christens those far-off points of the  Pacific Railroad with his blood.\"]    Blood had been every-where on the railroad, which reached across the  plains like a steel serpent spotted with red. There was now a cessation  of hostilities, and Indian agents were reported to be on the way from  Washington to pacify the tribes. As they had been a long time in coming,  the inference was irresistible that the popping of champagne corks was  a much more pleasant experience than that of Indian guns would have  been. The harvest of scalps had reached high noon some time before. Far  off, south of the Arkansas, the savages had their home, and from thence,  like baleful will-o'-the-wisps, they would suddenly flash out, and then  flash back when pursued, and be lost in those remote regions. Lately,  United States troops have been so placed that the Indian villages may be  struck, if necessary, and retaliation had; and this, together with the  pacificatory efforts of the Quaker agents, is doing much to bring about  a condition of things which promises permanent peace.    Here our party was at Hays, the objective point of our journey, and our  base of operations against the treasures of the past and present, which  alike covered the country around. This little town is in the midst of  the great buffalo range. Away upon every side of it stretch those vast  plains where the short, crisp grass curls to the ridges, like an  African's kinky hair to his skull. Bison and wild horse, antelope and  wolf, for weeks were now to be our neighbors, appearing and vanishing  over the great expanse like large and small piratical crafts on an  ocean. We were kindly received at the Big Creek Land Company's office,  on the outskirts of the town, and there deposited our guns and baggage.  Our horses were expected on the morrow.    Twilight found us, after a busy afternoon, sitting around the office  door, with that tired feeling which a traveler has when mind and body  are equally exhausted. Our very tongues were silent, those useful  members having wagged until even they were grateful for the rest. The  hour of dusk, of all others, is the time for musing, and almost  involuntarily our minds wandered back a twelve-month, when the plains  were a solitude. No railroad, no houses, no tokens of civilization save  only a few solitary posts, garrisoned with corporal's guards, and  surrounded by red fiends thirsty for blood. Such was the picture then;  now, the clangor of a city echoed through Big Creek Valley.    While wondering at the change, away on the hills to our right there rose  a thundering tread, like the marching of a mighty multitude. Shamus, who  sat directly facing the hill, saw something which chilled the Dobeen  blood, and caused that noble Irishman to plunge behind us. Mr. Colon,  who had given a startled turn of the head over his right shoulder,  exclaimed, \"Bless me, what's that?\" The glance of Muggs froze that  Briton so completely that he failed to tell us of ever having seen a  more \"hextraordinary thing in Hingland.\" I am in doubt whether even our  grave professor did not imagine for the moment that the mammalian age  was"]]]
