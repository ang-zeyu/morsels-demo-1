In either case we are led to the conclusion that, from  the first, Muhammad had formed the plan of promulging a written book. Comp.  Sura xx. 112.    4 In the death-struggle.    5 Or, Therefore woe to thee, woe! And, again, woe to thee, woe. Thus Sale,  Ullm.

SURA LXXXIII.-THOSE WHO STINT [XLI.]    MECCA.-36 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    Woe to those who STINT the measure:    Who when they take by measure from others, exact the full;    But when they mete to them or weigh to them, minish-    What! have they no thought that they shall be raised again    For the great day?    The day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.    Yes! the register of the wicked is in Sidjin.1    And who shall make thee understand what Sidjin is?    It is a book distinctly written.    Woe, on that day, to those who treated our signs as lies,    Who treated the day of judgment as a lie!    None treat it as a lie, save the transgressor, the criminal,    Who, when our signs are rehearsed to him, saith, \"Tales of the Ancients!\"    Yes; but their own works have got the mastery over their hearts.    Yes; they shall be shut out as by a veil from their Lord on that day;    Then shall they be burned in Hell-fire:    Then shall it be said to them, \"This is what ye deemed a lie.\"    Even so. But the register of the righteous is in Illiyoun.    And who shall make thee understand what Illiyoun is?    A book distinctly written;    The angels who draw nigh unto God attest it.    Surely, among delights shall the righteous dwell!    Seated on bridal couches they will gaze around;    Thou shalt mark in their faces the brightness of delight;    Choice sealed wine shall be given them to quaff,    The seal of musk. For this let those pant who pant for bliss-    Mingled therewith shall be the waters of Tasnim-2    Fount whereof they who draw nigh to God shall drink.    The sinners indeed laugh the faithful to scorn:    And when they pass by them they wink at one another,-    And when they return to their own people, they return jesting,    And when they see them they say, \"These are the erring ones.\"    And yet they have no mission to be their guardians.    Therefore, on that day the faithful shall laugh the infidels to scorn,    As reclining on bridal couches they behold them.    Shall not the infidels be recompensed according to their works?      _______________________    1 Sidjin is a prison in Hell which gives its name to the register of actions  there kept, as Illiyoun, a name of the lofty apartments of Paradise, is  transferred to the register of the righteous.    2 Derived from the root sanima, to be high: this water being conveyed to the  highest apartments in the Pavilions of Paradise.      SURA LXIX.-THE INEVITABLE [XLII.]    MECCA.-52 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    The INEVITABLE!    And who shall make thee comprehend what the Inevitable is?    Themoud and Ad treated the day of Terrors1 as a lie.    So as to Themoud,2 they were destroyed by crashing thunder bolts;    And as to Ad, they were destroyed by a roaring and furious blast.    It did the bidding of God3 against them seven nights and eight days together,  during which thou mightest have seen the people laid low, as though they had  been the trunks of hollow palms;    And couldst thou have seen one of them surviving?    Pharaoh also, and those who flourished before him, and the overthrown cities,  committed sin,-    And disobeyed the Sent one of their Lord; therefore did he chastise them with  an accumulated chastisement.    When the Flood rose high, we bare you in the Ark,    That we might make that event a warning to you, and that the retaining ear  might retain it.    But when one blast shall be blown on the trumpet,    And the earth and the mountains shall be upheaved, and shall both be crushed  into dust at a single crushing,    On that day the woe that must come suddenly shall suddenly come,4    And the heaven shall cleave asunder, for on that day it shall be fragile;    And the angels shall be on its sides, and over them on that day eight shall  bear up the throne of thy Lord.    On that day ye shall be brought before Him: none of your hidden deeds shall  remain hidden:    And he who shall have his book given to him in his right hand, will say to  his friends, \"Take ye it; read ye my book;    I ever thought that to this my reckoning I should come.\"    And his shall be a life that shall please him well,    In a lofty garden,    Whose clusters shall be near at hand:    \"Eat ye and drink with healthy relish, as the meed of what ye sent on  beforehand in the days which are past.\"    But he who shall have his book given into his left hand, will say, \"O that my  book had never been given me!    And that I had never known my reckoning!    O that death had made an end of me!    My wealth hath not profited me!    My power hath perished from me!\"    \"Lay ye hold on him and chain him,    Then at the Hell-fire burn him,    Then into a chain whose length is seventy cubits thrust him;    For he believed not in God, the Great,    And was not careful to feed the poor;    No friend therefore shall he have here this day,    Nor food, but corrupt sores,    Which none shall eat but the sinners.\"    It needs not that I swear by what ye see,    And by that which ye see not,    That this verily is the word of an apostle worthy of all honour!    And that it is not the word of a poet-how little do ye believe!    Neither is it the word of a soothsayer (Kahin)-how little do ye receive  warning!    It is a missive from the Lord of the worlds.    But if Muhammad had fabricated concerning us any sayings,    We had surely seized him by the right hand,    And had cut through the vein of his neck.5    Nor would We have withheld any one of you from him.    But, verily, It (the Koran) is a warning for the God-fearing;    And we well know that there are of you who treat it as a falsehood.    But it shall be the despair of infidels,    For it is the very truth of sure knowledge.    Praise, then, the name of thy Lord, the Great.      _______________________    1 Thus Beidh., Sale, etc. But with reference to another sense of the root  karaa, it may be rendered the day of decision, the day on which man's lot  shall be decided.    2 On Ad and Themoud. See Sura vii. 63-77.    3 Lit. God subjected it to himself, availed himself of it against them.    4 El-wakia, the sudden event, the calamity; the woe that must break in upon  Heaven and Earth. The same word is used, Sura lvi. 1, and ci. 1, for the  Resurrection and Day of Judgment.    5 In allusion to the mode of executing criminals in many eastern countries.      SURA LI.-THE SCATTERING [XLIII.]    MECCA.-60 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    By the clouds1 which scatter with SCATTERING,    And those which bear their load,    And by those which speed lightly along,    And those which apportion by command!    True, indeed, is that with which ye are threatened,    And lo! the judgment will surely come.2    By the star-tracked heaven!    Ye are discordant in what ye say;    But whose turneth him from the truth, is turned from it by a divine decree.    Perish the liars,    Who are bewildered in the depths of ignorance!    They ask, \"When this day of judgment?\"    On that day they shall be tormented at the fire.    \"Taste ye of this your torment, whose speedy coming ye challenged.\"    But the God-fearing shall dwell amid gardens and fountains,    Enjoying what their Lord hath given them, because, aforetime they were well-  doers:    But little of the night was it that they slept,    And at dawn they prayed for pardon,    And gave due share of their wealth to the suppliant and the outcast.    On Earth are signs for men of firm belief,    And also in your own selves: Will ye not then behold them?    The Heaven hath sustenance for you, and it containeth that which you are  promised.    By the Lord then of the heaven and of the earth, I swear that this is the  truth, even as ye speak yourselves.3    Hath the story reached thee of Abraham's honoured guests?4    When they went in unto him and said, \"Peace!\" he replied, \"Peace:-they are  strangers.\"    And he went apart to his family, and brought a fatted calf,    And set it before them. He said, \"Eat ye not?\"    And he conceived a fear of them. They said to him, \"Fear not;\" and announced  to him a wise son.    His wife came up with outcry: she smote her face and said, \"What I, old and  barren!\"    They said, \"Thus saith thy Lord. He truly is the Wise, the Knowing.\"    Said he, \"And what, O messengers, is your errand?\"    They said, \"To a wicked people are we sent,    To hurl upon them stones of clay,    Destined5 by thy Lord for men guilty of excesses.\"    And we brought forth the believers who were in the city:    But we found not in it but one family of Muslims.    And signs we left in it for those who dread the afflictive chastisement,-    And in Moses: when we sent him to Pharaoh with manifest power:    But relying on his forces6 he turned his back and said, \"Sorcerer, or  Possessed.\"    So we seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea; for of all blame  was he worthy.    And in Ad: when we sent against them the desolating blast:    It touched not aught over which it came, but it turned it to dust.    And in Themoud:7 when it was said to them, \"Enjoy yourselves for yet a  while.\"    But they rebelled against their Lord's command: so the tempest took them as  they watched its coming.8    They were not able to stand upright, and could not help themselves.    And we destroyed the people of Noah, before them; for an impious people were  they.    And the Heaven-with our hands have we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28019"],[0,"Birds in the Bush (#14)"],[1,"cold. But we intend no such foolish  recantation. These hardships are real enough, and serious enough. What  we maintain is that evils of this kind are not necessarily inconsistent  with enjoyment, and may even give to life an additional zest. It is a  matter of every-day observation that the people who have nothing to do  except to \"live well\" (as the common sarcasm has it) are not always the  most cheerful; while there are certain diseases, like pessimism and the  gout, which seem appointed to wait on luxury and idleness,--as though  nature were determined to have the scales kept somewhat even. And surely  this divine law of compensation has not left the innocent birds  unprovided for,--the innocent birds of whom it was said, \"Your heavenly  Father feedeth them.\" How must the devoted pair exult, when, in spite  of owls and hawks, squirrels and weasels, small boys and full-grown  oologists, they have finally reared a brood of offspring! The long  uncertainty and the thousand perils only intensify the joy. In truth, so  far as this world is concerned, the highest bliss is never to be had  without antecedent sorrow; and even of heaven itself we may not scruple  to say that, if there are painters there, they probably feel obliged to  put some shadows into their pictures.    But of course (and this is what we have been coming to through this long  introduction),--of course our friends of the air are happiest in the  season of mating; happiest, and therefore most attractive to us who find  our pleasure in studying them. In spring, of all times of the year, it  seems a pity that everybody should not turn ornithologist. For \"all  mankind love a lover;\" and the world, in consequence, has given itself  up to novel-reading, not knowing, unfortunately, how much better that  _role_ is taken by the birds than by the common run of story-book  heroes.    People whose notions of the subject are derived from attending to the  antics of our imported sparrows have no idea how delicate and beautiful  a thing a real feathered courtship is. To tell the truth, these  foreigners have associated too long and too intimately with men, and  have fallen far away from their primal innocence. There is no need to  describe their actions. The vociferous and most unmannerly importunity  of the suitor, and the correspondingly spiteful rejection of his  overtures by the little vixen on whom his affections are for the moment  placed,--these we have all seen to our hearts' discontent.    The sparrow will not have been brought over the sea for nothing,  however, if his bad behavior serves to heighten our appreciation of our  own native songsters, with their \"perfect virtues\" and \"manners for the  heart's delight.\"    The American robin, for instance, is far from being a bird of  exceptional refinement. His nest is rude, not to say slovenly, and his  general deportment is unmistakably common. But watch him when he goes  a-wooing, and you will begin to feel quite a new respect for him. How  gently he approaches his beloved! How carefully he avoids ever coming  disrespectfully near! No sparrow-like screaming, no dancing about, no  melodramatic gesticulation. If she moves from one side of the tree to  the other, or to the tree adjoining, he follows in silence. Yet every  movement is a petition, an assurance that his heart is hers and ever  must be. The action is extremely simple; there is nothing of which to  make an eloquent description; but I should pity the man who could  witness it with indifference. Not that the robin's suit is always  carried on in the same way; he is much too versatile for that. On one  occasion, at least, I saw him holding himself absolutely motionless, in  a horizontal posture, staring at his sweetheart as if he would charm her  with his gaze, and emitting all the while a subdued hissing sound. The  significance of this conduct I do not profess to have understood; it  ended with his suddenly darting at the female, who took wing and was  pursued. Not improbably the robin finds the feminine nature somewhat  fickle, and counts it expedient to vary his tactics accordingly; for it  is getting to be more and more believed that, in kind at least, the  intelligence of the lower animals is not different from ours.    I once came unexpectedly upon a wood thrush, who was in the midst of a  performance very similar to this of the robin standing on the dead  branch of a tree, with his crown feathers erect, his bill set wide open,  and his whole body looking as rigid as death. His mate, as I perceived  the next moment, was not far away, on the same limb. If he was  attempting fascination, he had gone very clumsily about it, I thought,  unless his mate's idea of beauty was totally different from mine; for I  could hardly keep from laughing at his absurd appearance. It did not  occur to me till afterwards that he had perhaps heard of Othello's  method, and was at that moment acting out a story                        \"of most disastrous chances,      Of moving accidents by flood and field,      Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,      Of being taken by the insolent foe      And sold to slavery.\"    How much depends upon the point of view! Here was I, ready to laugh;  while poor Desdemona only thought, \"'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous  pitiful.\" Dear sympathetic soul! Let us hope that she was never called  to play out the tragedy.    Two things are very noticeable during the pairing season,--the scarcity  of females and their indifference. Every one of them seems to have at  least two admirers dangling after her,[16] while she is almost sure to  carry herself as if a wedding were the last thing she would ever consent  to think of; and that not because of bashfulness, but from downright  aversion. The observer begins to suspect that the fair creatures have  really entered into some sort of no-marriage league, and that there are  not to be any nests this year, nor any young birds. But by and by he  discovers that somehow, he cannot surmise how,--it must have been when  his eyes were turned the other way,--the scene is entirely changed, the  maidens are all wedded, and even now the nests are being got ready.    I watched a trio of cat-birds in a clump of alder bushes by the  roadside; two males, almost as a matter of course, \"paying attentions\"  to one female. Both suitors were evidently in earnest; each hoped to  carry off the prize, and perhaps felt that he should be miserable  forever if he were disappointed; and yet, on their part, everything was  being done decently and in order. So far as I saw, there was no  disposition to quarrel. Only let the dear creature choose one of them,  and the other would take his broken heart away. So, always at a modest  remove, they followed her about from bush to bush, entreating her in  most loving and persuasive tones to listen to their suit. But she, all  this time, answered every approach with a snarl; she would never have  anything to do with either of them; she disliked them both, and only  wished they would leave her to herself. This lasted as long as I stayed  to watch. Still I had little doubt she fully intended to accept one of  them, and had even made up her mind already which it should be. She  knew enough, I felt sure, to calculate the value of a proper maidenly  reluctance. How could her mate be expected to rate her at her worth, if  she allowed herself to be won too easily? Besides, she could afford not  to be in haste, seeing she had a choice of two.    What a comfortably simple affair the matrimonial question is with the  feminine cat-bird! Her wooers are all of equally good family and all  equally rich. There is literally nothing for her to do but to look into  her own heart and choose. No temptation has she to sell herself for the  sake of a fashionable name or a fine house, or in order to gratify the  prejudice of father or mother. As for a marriage settlement, she knows  neither the name nor the thing. In fact, marriage in her thought is a  simple union of hearts, with no taint of anything mercantile about it.  Happy cat-bird! She perhaps imagines that human marriages are of the  same ideal sort!    I have spoken of the affectionate language of these dusky lovers; but it  was noticeable that they did not sing, although, to have fulfilled the  common idea of such an affair, they certainly should have been doing so,  and each trying his best to outsing the other. Possibly there had  already been such a tournament before my arrival; or, for aught I know,  this particular female may have given out that she had no ear for  music.    In point of fact, however, there was nothing peculiar in their conduct.  No doubt, in the earlier stages of a bird's attachment he is likely to  express his passion musically; but later he is not content to warble  from a tree-top. There are things to be said which cannot appropriately  be spoken at long range; and unless my study of novels has been to  little purpose, all this agrees well with the practices of human  gallants. Do not these begin by singing under the lady's window, or by  sending verses to her? and are not such proceedings intended to prepare  the way, as speedily as possible, for others of a more satisfying,  though it may be of a less romantic nature?    Bearing this in mind, we may be able to account, in part at least, for  the inexperienced observer's disappointment when, fresh from the perusal  of (for example) the thirteenth chapter of Darwin's \"Descent of Man,\" he  goes into the woods to look about for himself. He expects to find here  and there two or three songsters, each in turn doing his utmost to  surpass the brilliancy and power of the other's music; while a feminine  auditor sits in full view, preparing to render her verdict, and reward  the successful competitor with her own precious self. This would be a  pretty picture. Unfortunately, it is looked for in vain. The two or  three singers may be found, likely"]]]
