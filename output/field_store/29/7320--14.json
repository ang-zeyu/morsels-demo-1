[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30754"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 1 (of 3) (#14)"],[1,"ver, take the  form of walls, but of railings; and, like all other metal constructions,  must be left out of our present investigation; as may be also walls  composed merely of light planks or laths for purposes of partition or  inclosure. Substantial walls, whether of wood or earth (I use the word  earth as including clay, baked or unbaked, and stone), have, in their  perfect form, three distinct members;--the Foundation, Body or Veil, and  Cornice.    Sec. III. The foundation is to the wall what the paw is to an animal. It  is a long foot, wider than the wall, on which the wall is to stand, and  which keeps it from settling into the ground. It is most necessary that  this great element of security should be visible to the eye, and  therefore made a part of the structure above ground. Sometimes, indeed,  it becomes incorporated with the entire foundation of the building, a  vast table on which walls or piers are alike set: but even then, the  eye, taught by the reason, requires some additional preparation or foot  for the wall, and the building is felt to be imperfect without it. This  foundation we shall call the Base of the wall.    Sec. IV. The body of the wall is of course the principal mass of it,  formed of mud or clay, of bricks or stones, of logs or hewn timber; the  condition of structure being, that it is of equal thickness everywhere,  below and above. It may be half a foot thick, or six feet thick, or  fifty feet thick; but if of equal thickness everywhere, it is still a  wall proper: if to its fifty feet of proper thickness there be added so  much as an inch of thickness in particular parts, that added thickness  is to be considered as some form of buttress or pier, or other  appliance.[33]    In perfect architecture, however, the walls are generally kept of  moderate thickness, and strengthened by piers or buttresses; and the  part of the wall between these, being generally intended only to secure  privacy, or keep out the slighter forces of weather, may be properly  called a Wall Veil. I shall always use this word \"Veil\" to signify the  even portion of a wall, it being more expressive than the term Body.    Sec. V. When the materials with which this veil is built are very loose,  or of shapes which do not fit well together, it sometimes becomes  necessary, or at least adds to security, to introduce courses of more  solid material. Thus, bricks alternate with rolled pebbles in the old  walls of Verona, and hewn stones with brick in its Lombard churches. A  banded structure, almost a stratification of the wall, is thus produced;  and the courses of more solid material are sometimes decorated with  carving. Even when the wall is not thus banded through its whole height,  it frequently becomes expedient to lay a course of stone, or at least of  more carefully chosen materials, at regular heights; and such belts or  bands we may call String courses. These are a kind of epochs in the  wall's existence; something like periods of rest and reflection in human  life, before entering on a new career. Or else, in the building, they  correspond to the divisions of its stories within, express its internal  structure, and mark off some portion of the ends of its existence  already attained.    Sec. VI. Finally, on the top of the wall some protection from the weather  is necessary, or some preparation for the reception of superincumbent  weight, called a coping, or Cornice. I shall use the word Cornice for  both; for, in fact, a coping is a roof to the wall itself, and is  carried by a small cornice as the roof of the building by a large one.  In either case, the cornice, small or large, is the termination of the  wall's existence, the accomplishment of its work. When it is meant to  carry some superincumbent weight, the cornice may be considered as its  hand, opened to carry something above its head; as the base was  considered its foot: and the three parts should grow out of each other  and form one whole, like the root, stalk, and bell of a flower.    These three parts we shall examine in succession; and, first, the Base.    Sec. VII. It may be sometimes in our power, and it is always expedient,  to prepare for the whole building some settled foundation, level and  firm, out of sight. But this has not been done in some of the noblest  buildings in existence. It cannot always be done perfectly, except at  enormous expense; and, in reasoning upon the superstructure, we shall  never suppose it to be done. The mind of the spectator does not  conceive it; and he estimates the merits of the edifice on the  supposition of its being built upon the ground. Even if there be a vast  table land of foundation elevated for the whole of it, accessible by  steps all round, as at Pisa, the surface of this table is always  conceived as capable of yielding somewhat to superincumbent weight, and  generally is so; and we shall base all our arguments on the widest  possible supposition, that is to say, that the building stands on a  surface either of earth, or, at all events, capable of yielding in some  degree to its weight.    [Illustration: Fig. II.]    Sec. VIII. Now, let the reader simply ask himself how, on such a surface,  he would set about building a substantial wall, that should be able to  bear weight and to stand for ages. He would assuredly look about for the  largest stones he had at his disposal, and, rudely levelling the ground,  he would lay these well together over a considerably larger width than  he required the wall to be (suppose as at _a_, Fig. II.), in order to  equalise the pressure of the wall over a large surface, and form its  foot. On the top of these he would perhaps lay a second tier of large  stones, _b_, or even the third, _c_, making the breadth somewhat less  each time, so as to prepare for the pressure of the wall on the centre,  and, naturally or necessarily, using somewhat smaller stones above than  below (since we supposed him to look about for the largest first), and  cutting them more neatly. His third tier, if not his second, will  probably appear a sufficiently secure foundation for finer work; for if  the earth yield at all, it will probably yield pretty equally under the  great mass of masonry now knit together over it. So he will prepare for  the wall itself at once by sloping off the next tier of stones to the  right diameter, as at _d_. If there be any joints in this tier within  the wall, he may perhaps, for further security, lay a binding stone  across them, _e_, and then begin the work of the wall veil itself,  whether in bricks or stones.    Sec. IX. I have supposed the preparation here to be for a large wall,  because such a preparation will give us the best general type. But it is  evident that the essential features of the arrangement are only two,  that is to say, one tier of massy work for foundation, suppose _c_,  missing the first two; and the receding tier or real foot of the wall,  _d_. The reader will find these members, though only of brick, in most  of the considerable and independent walls in the suburbs of London.    Sec. X. It is evident, however, that the general type, Fig. II., will  be subject to many different modifications in different circumstances.  Sometimes the ledges of the tiers _a_ and _b_ may be of greater width;  and when the building is in a secure place, and of finished masonry,  these may be sloped off also like the main foot _d_. In Venetian  buildings these lower ledges are exposed to the sea, and therefore left  rough hewn; but in fine work and in important positions the lower ledges  may be bevelled and decorated like the upper, or another added above  _d_; and all these parts may be in different proportions, according to  the disposition of the building above them. But we have nothing to do  with any of these variations at present, they being all more or less  dependent upon decorative considerations, except only one of very great  importance, that is to say, the widening of the lower ledge into a stone  seat, which may be often done in buildings of great size with most  beautiful effect: it looks kind and hospitable, and preserves the work  above from violence. In St. Mark's at Venice, which is a small and low  church, and needing no great foundation for the wall veils of it, we  find only the three members, _b_, _c_, and _d_. Of these the first rises  about a foot above the pavement of St. Mark's Place, and forms an  elevated dais in some of the recesses of the porches, chequered red and  white; _c_ forms a seat which follows the line of the walls, while its  basic character is marked by its also carrying certain shafts with  which we have here no concern; _d_ is of white marble; and all are  enriched and decorated in the simplest and most perfect manner possible,  as we shall see in Chap. XXV. And thus much may serve to fix the type of  wall bases, a type oftener followed in real practice than any other we  shall hereafter be enabled to determine: for wall bases of necessity  must be solidly built, and the architect is therefore driven into the  adoption of the right form; or if he deviate from it, it is generally in  meeting some necessity of peculiar circumstances, as in obtaining  cellars and underground room, or in preparing for some grand features or  particular parts of the wall, or in some mistaken idea of  decoration,--into which errors we had better not pursue him until we  understand something more of the rest of the building: let us therefore  proceed to consider the wall veil.      FOOTNOTES:      [33] Many walls are slightly sloped or curved towards their tops,      and have buttresses added to them (that of the Queen's Bench Prison      is a curious instance of the vertical buttress and inclined wall);      but in all such instances the slope of the wall is properly to be      considered a condition of incorporated buttress.          CHAPTER V.      THE WALL VEIL.      Sec. I. The summer of the year 1849 was spent by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30755"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 2 (of 3), (#14)"],[1," scale; and, with  the assistance of Byzantine architects, the fabric was carried on under  successive Doges for nearly a hundred years; the main building being  completed in 1071, but its incrustation with marble not till  considerably later. It was consecrated on the 8th of October, 1085,[25]  according to Sansovino and the author of the \"Chiesa Ducale di S.  Marco,\" in 1094 according to Lazari, but certainly between 1084 and  1096, those years being the limits of the reign of Vital Falier; I  incline to the supposition that it was soon after his accession to the  throne in 1085, though Sansovino writes, by mistake, Ordelafo instead of  Vital Falier. But, at all events, before the close of the eleventh  century the great consecration of the church took place. It was again  injured by fire in 1106, but repaired; and from that time to the fall of  Venice there was probably no Doge who did not in some slight degree  embellish or alter the fabric, so that few parts of it can be  pronounced boldly to be of any given date. Two periods of interference  are, however, notable above the rest: the first, that in which the  Gothic school, had superseded the Byzantine towards the close of the  fourteenth century, when the pinnacles, upper archivolts, and window  traceries were added to the exterior, and the great screen, with various  chapels and tabernacle-work, to the interior; the second, when the  Renaissance school superseded the Gothic, and the pupils of Titian and  Tintoret substituted, over one half of the church, their own  compositions for the Greek mosaics with which it was originally  decorated;[26] happily, though with no good will, having left enough to  enable us to imagine and lament what they destroyed. Of this irreparable  loss we shall have more to say hereafter; meantime, I wish only to fix  in the reader's mind the succession of periods of alteration as firmly  and simply as possible.    Sec. VI. We have seen that the main body of the church may be broadly  stated to be of the eleventh century, the Gothic additions of the  fourteenth, and the restored mosaics of the seventeenth. There is no  difficulty in distinguishing at a glance the Gothic portions from the  Byzantine; but there is considerable difficulty in ascertaining how  long, during the course of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,  additions were made to the Byzantine church, which cannot be easily  distinguished from the work of the eleventh century, being purposely  executed in the same manner. Two of the most important pieces of  evidence on this point are, a mosaic in the south transept, and another  over the northern door of the facade; the first representing the  interior, the second the exterior, of the ancient church.    Sec. VII. It has just been stated that the existing building was  consecrated by the Doge Vital Falier. A peculiar solemnity was given to  that act of consecration, in the minds of the Venetian people, by what  appears to have been one of the best arranged and most successful  impostures ever attempted by the clergy of the Romish church. The body  of St. Mark had, without doubt, perished in the conflagration of 976;  but the revenues of the church depended too much upon the devotion  excited by these relics to permit the confession of their loss. The  following is the account given by Corner, and believed to this day by  the Venetians, of the pretended miracle by which it was concealed.    \"After the repairs undertaken by the Doge Orseolo, the place in which  the body of the holy Evangelist rested had been altogether forgotten; so  that the Doge Vital Falier was entirely ignorant of the place of the  venerable deposit. This was no light affliction, not only to the pious  Doge, but to all the citizens and people; so that at last, moved by  confidence in the Divine mercy, they determined to implore, with prayer  and fasting, the manifestation of so great a treasure, which did not now  depend upon any human effort. A general fast being therefore proclaimed,  and a solemn procession appointed for the 25th day of June, while the  people assembled in the church interceded with God in fervent prayers  for the desired boon, they beheld, with as much amazement as joy, a  slight shaking in the marbles of a pillar (near the place where the  altar of the Cross is now), which, presently falling to the earth,  exposed to the view of the rejoicing people the chest of bronze in which  the body of the Evangelist was laid.\"    Sec. VIII. Of the main facts of this tale there is no doubt. They were  embellished afterwards, as usual, by many fanciful traditions; as, for  instance, that, when the sarcophagus was discovered, St. Mark extended  his hand out of it, with a gold ring on one of the fingers, which he  permitted a noble of the Dolfin family to remove; and a quaint and  delightful story was further invented of this ring, which I shall not  repeat here, as it is now as well known as any tale of the Arabian  Nights. But the fast and the discovery of the coffin, by whatever means  effected, are facts; and they are recorded in one of the best-preserved  mosaics of the north transept, executed very certainly not long after  the event had taken place, closely resembling in its treatment that of  the Bayeux tapestry, and showing, in a conventional manner, the  interior of the church, as it then was, filled by the people, first in  prayer, then in thanksgiving, the pillar standing open before them, and  the Doge, in the midst of them, distinguished by his crimson bonnet  embroidered with gold, but more unmistakably by the inscription \"Dux\"  over his head, as uniformly is the case in the Bayeux tapestry, and most  other pictorial works of the period. The church is, of course, rudely  represented, and the two upper stories of it reduced to a small scale in  order to form a background to the figures; one of those bold pieces of  picture history which we in our pride of perspective, and a thousand  things besides, never dare attempt. We should have put in a column or  two of the real or perspective size, and subdued it into a vague  background: the old workman crushed the church together that he might  get it all in, up to the cupolas; and has, therefore, left us some  useful notes of its ancient form, though any one who is familiar with  the method of drawing employed at the period will not push the evidence  too far. The two pulpits are there, however, as they are at this day,  and the fringe of mosaic flower-work which then encompassed the whole  church, but which modern restorers have destroyed, all but one fragment  still left in the south aisle. There is no attempt to represent the  other mosaics on the roof, the scale being too small to admit of their  being represented with any success; but some at least of those mosaics  had been executed at that period, and their absence in the  representation of the entire church is especially to be observed, in  order to show that we must not trust to any negative evidence in such  works. M. Lazari has rashly concluded that the central archivolt of St.  Mark's _must_ be posterior to the year 1205, because it does not appear  in the representation of the exterior of the church over the northern  door;[27] but he justly observes that this mosaic (which is the other  piece of evidence we possess respecting the ancient form of the  building) cannot itself be earlier than 1205, since it represents the  bronze horses which were brought from Constantinople in that year. And  this one fact renders it very difficult to speak with confidence  respecting the date of any part of the exterior of St. Mark's; for we  have above seen that it was consecrated in the eleventh century, and yet  here is one of its most important exterior decorations assuredly  retouched, if not entirely added, in the thirteenth, although its style  would have led us to suppose it had been an original part of the fabric.  However, for all our purposes, it will be enough for the reader to  remember that the earliest parts of the building belong to the eleventh,  twelfth, and first part of the thirteenth century; the Gothic portions  to the fourteenth; some of the altars and embellishments to the  fifteenth and sixteenth; and the modern portion of the mosaics to the  seventeenth.    Sec. IX. This, however, I only wish him to recollect in order that I may  speak generally of the Byzantine architecture of St. Mark's, without  leading him to suppose the whole church to have been built and decorated  by Greek artists. Its later portions, with the single exception of the  seventeenth century mosaics, have been so dexterously accommodated to  the original fabric that the general effect is still that of a Byzantine  building; and I shall not, except when it is absolutely necessary,  direct attention to the discordant points, or weary the reader with  anatomical criticism. Whatever in St. Mark's arrests the eye, or affects  the feelings, is either Byzantine, or has been modified by Byzantine  influence; and our inquiry into its architectural merits need not  therefore be disturbed by the anxieties of antiquarianism, or arrested  by the obscurities of chronology.    Sec. X. And now I wish that the reader, before I bring him into St.  Mark's Place, would imagine himself for a little time in a quiet English  cathedral town, and walk with me to the west front of its cathedral. Let  us go together up the more retired street, at the end of which we can  see the pinnacles of one of the towers, and then through the low grey  gateway, with its battlemented top and small latticed window in the  centre, into the inner private-looking road or close, where nothing  goes in but the carts of the tradesmen who supply the bishop and the  chapter, and where there are little shaven grass-plots, fenced in by  neat rails, before old-fashioned groups of somewhat diminutive and  excessively trim houses, with little oriel and bay windows jutting out  here and"]]]
