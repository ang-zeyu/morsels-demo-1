Each stage of the cycle from infancy  to old age leaves, as we have seen, its characteristic records in  the forms sculptured on the land, such as the shapes of valleys  and the contours of hills and plains. The geologist is thus able  to determine by the land forms of any region the stage in the  erosion cycle to which it now belongs, and knowing what are the  earlier stages of the cycle, to read something of the geological  history of the region.    INTERRUPTED CYCLES. So long a time is needed to reduce a land mass  to baselevel that the process is seldom if ever completed during a  single uninterrupted cycle of erosion. Of all the various  interruptions which may occur the most important are gradual  movements of the earth's crust, by which a region is either  depressed or elevated relative to sea level.    The DEPRESSION of a region hastens its old age by decreasing the  gradient of streams, by destroying their power to excavate their  beds and carry their loads to a degree corresponding to the amount  of the depression, and by lessening the amount of work they have  to do. The slackened river currents deposit their waste in Hood  plains which increase in height as the subsidence continues. The  lower courses of the rivers are invaded by the sea and become  estuaries, while the lower tributaries are cut off from the trunk  stream.    ELEVATION, on the other hand, increases the activity of all  agencies of weathering, erosion, and transportation, restores the  region to its youth, and inaugurates a new cycle of erosion.  Streams are given a steeper gradient, greater velocity, and  increased energy to carry their loads and wear their beds. They  cut through the alluvium of their flood plains, leaving it on  either bank as successive terraces, and intrench themselves in the  underlying rock. In their older and wider valleys they cut narrow,  steep-walled inner gorges, in which they flow swiftly over rocky  floors, broken here and there by falls and rapids where a harder  layer of rock has been discovered. Winding streams on plains may  thus incise their meanders in solid rock as the plains are  gradually uplifted. Streams which are thus restored to their youth  are said to be REVIVED.    As streams cut deeper and the valley slopes are steepened, the  mantle of waste of the region undergoing elevation is set in more  rapid movement. It is now removed particle by particle faster than  it forms. As the waste mantle thins, weathering attacks the rocks  of the region more energetically until an equilibrium is reached  again; the rocks waste rapidly and their waste is as rapidly  removed.    DISSECTED PENEPLAINS. When a rise of the land brings one cycle to  an end and begins another, the characteristic land forms of each  cycle are found together and the topography of the region is  composite until the second cycle is so far advanced that the land  forms of the first cycle are entirely destroyed. The contrast  between the land surfaces of the later and the earlier cycles is  most striking when the earlier had advanced to age and the later  is still in youth. Thus many peneplains which have been elevated  and dissected have been recognized by the remnants of their  ancient erosion surfaces, and the length of time which has elapsed  since their uplift has been measured by the stage to which the new  cycle has advanced.    THE PIEDMONT BELT. As an example of an ancient peneplain uplifted  and dissected we may cite the Piedmont Belt, a broad upland lying  between the Appalachian Mountains and the Atlantic coastal plain.  The surface of the Piedmont is gently rolling. The divides, which  are often smooth areas of considerable width, rise to a common  plane, and from them one sees in every direction an even sky line  except where in places some lone hill or ridge may lift itself  above the general level (Fig. 62). The surface is an ancient one,  for the mantle of residual waste lies deep upon it, soils are  reddened by long oxidation, and the rocks are rotted to a depth of  scores of feet.    At present, however, the waste mantle is not forming so rapidly as  it is being removed. The streams of the upland are actively  engaged in its destruction. They flow swiftly in narrow, rock-  walled valleys over rocky beds. This contrast between the young  streams and the aged surface which they are now so vigorously  dissecting can only be explained by the theory that the region  once stood lower than at present and has recently been upraised.  If now we imagine the valleys refilled with the waste which the  streams have swept away, and the upland lowered, we restore the  Piedmont region to the condition in which it stood before its  uplift and dissection,--a gently rolling plain, surmounted here  and there by isolated hills and ridges.    The surface of the ancient Piedmont plain, as it may be restored  from the remnants of it found on the divides, is not in accordance  with the structures of the country rocks. Where these are exposed  to view they are seen to be far from horizontal. On the walls of  river gorges they dip steeply and in various directions and the  streams flow over their upturned edges. As shown in Figure 67, the  rocks of the Piedmont have been folded and broken and tilted.    It is not reasonable to believe that when the rocks of the  Piedmont were thus folded and otherwise deformed the surface of  the region was a plain. The upturned layers have not always  stopped abruptly at the even surface of the Piedmont plain which  now cuts across them. They are the bases of great folds and tilted  blocks which must once have risen high in air. The complex and  disorderly structures of the Piedmont rocks are those seen in  great mountain ranges, and there is every reason to believe that  these rocks after their deformation rose to mountain height.    The ancient Piedmont plain cuts across these upturned rocks as  independently of their structure as the even surface of the sawed  stump of some great tree is independent of the direction of its  fibers. Hence the Piedmont plain as it was before its uplift was  not a coastal plain formed of strata spread in horizontal sheets  beneath the sea and then uplifted; nor was it a structural plain,  due to the resistance to erosion of some hard, flat-lying layer of  rock. Even surfaces developed on rocks of discordant structure,  such as the Piedmont shows, are produced by long denudation, and  we may consider the Piedmont as a peneplain formed by the wearing  down of mountain ranges, and recently uplifted.    THE LAURENTIAN PENEPLAIN. This is the name given to a denuded  surface on very ancient rocks which extends from the Arctic Ocean  to the St. Lawrence River and Lake Superior, with small areas also  in northern Wisconsin and New York. Throughout this U-shaped area,  which incloses Hudson Bay within its arms, the country rocks have  the complicated and contorted structures which characterize  mountain ranges. But the surface of the area is by no means  mountainous. The sky line when viewed from the divides is unbroken  by mountain peaks or rugged hills. The surface of the arm west of  Hudson Bay is gently undulating and that of the eastern arm has  been roughened to low-rolling hills and dissected in places by  such deep river gorges as those of the Ottawa and Saguenay. This  immense area may be regarded as an ancient peneplain truncating  the bases of long-vanished mountains and dissected after  elevation.    In the examples cited the uplift has been a broad one and to  comparatively little height. Where peneplains have been uplifted  to great height and have since been well dissected, and where they  have been upfolded and broken and uptilted, their recognition  becomes more difficult. Yet recent observers have found evidences  of ancient lowland surfaces of erosion on the summits of the  Allegheny ridges, the Cascade Mountains (Fig. 69), and the western  slope of the Sierra Nevadas.    THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. We have here an example of an  area the latter part of whose geological history may be deciphered  by means of its land forms. The generalized section of Figure 70,  which passes from west to east across a portion of the region in  eastern Tennessee, shows on the west a part of the broad  Cumberland plateau. On the east is a roughened upland platform,  from which rise in the distance the peaks of the Great Smoky  Mountains. The plateau, consisting of strata but little changed  from their original flat-lying attitude, and the platform,  developed on rocks of disordered structure made crystalline by  heat and pressure, both stand at the common level of the line AB.  They are separated by the Appalachian valley, forty miles wide,  cut in strata which have been folded and broken into long narrow  blocks. The valley is traversed lengthwise by long, low ridges,  the outcropping edges of the harder strata, which rise to about  the same level,--that of the line cd. Between these ridges stretch  valley lowlands at the level ef excavated in the weaker rocks,  while somewhat below them lie the channels of the present streams  now busily engaged in deepening their beds.    THE VALLEY LOWLANDS. Were they planed by graded or ungraded  streams? Have the present streams reached grade? Why did the  streams cease widening the floors of the valley lowlands? How long  since? When will they begin anew the work of lateral planation?  What effect will this have on the ridges if the present cycle of  erosion continues long uninterrupted?    THE RIDGES OF THE APPALACHIAN VALLEY. Why do they stand above the  valley lowlands? Why do their summits lie in about the same plane?  Refilling the valleys intervening between these ridges with the  material removed by the streams, what is the nature of the surface  thus restored? Does this surface cd accord with the rock  structures on which' it has been developed? How may it have been  made?

By this, I made sure they were coming on again, and told Alan.    \"It's what we have to pray for,\" said he. \"Unless we can give them a  good distaste of us, and done with it, there'll be nae sleep for either  you or me. But this time, mind, they'll be in earnest.\"    By this, my pistols were ready, and there was nothing to do but listen  and wait. While the brush lasted, I had not the time to think if I was  frighted; but now, when all was still again, my mind ran upon nothing  else. The thought of the sharp swords and the cold steel was strong in  me; and presently, when I began to hear stealthy steps and a brushing  of men's clothes against the round-house wall, and knew they were taking  their places in the dark, I could have found it in my mind to cry out  aloud.    All this was upon Alan's side; and I had begun to think my share of the  fight was at an end, when I heard some one drop softly on the roof above  me.    Then there came a single call on the sea-pipe, and that was the signal.  A knot of them made one rush of it, cutlass in hand, against the door;  and at the same moment, the glass of the skylight was dashed in a  thousand pieces, and a man leaped through and landed on the floor.  Before he got his feet, I had clapped a pistol to his back, and might  have shot him, too; only at the touch of him (and him alive) my whole  flesh misgave me, and I could no more pull the trigger than I could have  flown.    He had dropped his cutlass as he jumped, and when he felt the pistol,  whipped straight round and laid hold of me, roaring out an oath; and at  that either my courage came again, or I grew so much afraid as came to  the same thing; for I gave a shriek and shot him in the midst of the  body. He gave the most horrible, ugly groan and fell to the floor. The  foot of a second fellow, whose legs were dangling through the skylight,  struck me at the same time upon the head; and at that I snatched another  pistol and shot this one through the thigh, so that he slipped through  and tumbled in a lump on his companion's body. There was no talk of  missing, any more than there was time to aim; I clapped the muzzle to  the very place and fired.    I might have stood and stared at them for long, but I heard Alan shout  as if for help, and that brought me to my senses.    He had kept the door so long; but one of the seamen, while he was  engaged with others, had run in under his guard and caught him about the  body. Alan was dirking him with his left hand, but the fellow clung like  a leech. Another had broken in and had his cutlass raised. The door was  thronged with their faces. I thought we were lost, and catching up my  cutlass, fell on them in flank.    But I had not time to be of help. The wrestler dropped at last; and  Alan, leaping back to get his distance, ran upon the others like a  bull, roaring as he went. They broke before him like water, turning, and  running, and falling one against another in their haste. The sword  in his hands flashed like quicksilver into the huddle of our fleeing  enemies; and at every flash there came the scream of a man hurt. I was  still thinking we were lost, when lo! they were all gone, and Alan was  driving them along the deck as a sheep-dog chases sheep.    Yet he was no sooner out than he was back again, being as cautious as he  was brave; and meanwhile the seamen continued running and crying out as  if he was still behind them; and we heard them tumble one upon another  into the forecastle, and clap-to the hatch upon the top.    The round-house was like a shambles; three were dead inside, another  lay in his death agony across the threshold; and there were Alan and I  victorious and unhurt.    He came up to me with open arms. \"Come to my arms!\" he cried, and  embraced and kissed me hard upon both cheeks. \"David,\" said he, \"I love  you like a brother. And O, man,\" he cried in a kind of ecstasy, \"am I no  a bonny fighter?\"    Thereupon he turned to the four enemies, passed his sword clean through  each of them, and tumbled them out of doors one after the other. As he  did so, he kept humming and singing and whistling to himself, like a man  trying to recall an air; only what HE was trying was to make one. All  the while, the flush was in his face, and his eyes were as bright as a  five-year-old child's with a new toy. And presently he sat down upon the  table, sword in hand; the air that he was making all the time began to  run a little clearer, and then clearer still; and then out he burst with  a great voice into a Gaelic song.    I have translated it here, not in verse (of which I have no skill) but  at least in the king's English.    He sang it often afterwards, and the thing became popular; so that I  have heard it and had it explained to me, many's the time.      \"This is the song of the sword of Alan; The smith made it, The fire set  it; Now it shines in the hand of Alan Breck.    \"Their eyes were many and bright, Swift were they to behold, Many the  hands they guided: The sword was alone.    \"The dun deer troop over the hill, They are many, the hill is one; The  dun deer vanish, The hill remains.    \"Come to me from the hills of heather, Come from the isles of the sea. O  far-beholding eagles, Here is your meat.\"      Now this song which he made (both words and music) in the hour of our  victory, is something less than just to me, who stood beside him in  the tussle. Mr. Shuan and five more were either killed outright or  thoroughly disabled; but of these, two fell by my hand, the two that  came by the skylight. Four more were hurt, and of that number, one (and  he not the least important) got his hurt from me. So that, altogether,  I did my fair share both of the killing and the wounding, and might have  claimed a place in Alan's verses. But poets have to think upon their  rhymes; and in good prose talk, Alan always did me more than justice.    In the meanwhile, I was innocent of any wrong being done me. For not  only I knew no word of the Gaelic; but what with the long suspense of  the waiting, and the scurry and strain of our two spirts of fighting,  and more than all, the horror I had of some of my own share in it, the  thing was no sooner over than I was glad to stagger to a seat. There was  that tightness on my chest that I could hardly breathe; the thought  of the two men I had shot sat upon me like a nightmare; and all upon a  sudden, and before I had a guess of what was coming, I began to sob and  cry like any child.    Alan clapped my shoulder, and said I was a brave lad and wanted nothing  but a sleep.    \"I'll take the first watch,\" said he. \"Ye've done well by me, David,  first and last; and I wouldn't lose you for all Appin--no, nor for  Breadalbane.\"    So I made up my bed on the floor; and he took the first spell, pistol  in hand and sword on knee, three hours by the captain's watch upon the  wall. Then he roused me up, and I took my turn of three hours; before  the end of which it was broad day, and a very quiet morning, with a  smooth, rolling sea that tossed the ship and made the blood run to and  fro on the round-house floor, and a heavy rain that drummed upon the  roof. All my watch there was nothing stirring; and by the banging of the  helm, I knew they had even no one at the tiller. Indeed (as I learned  afterwards) there were so many of them hurt or dead, and the rest in so  ill a temper, that Mr. Riach and the captain had to take turn and turn  like Alan and me, or the brig might have gone ashore and nobody the  wiser. It was a mercy the night had fallen so still, for the wind had  gone down as soon as the rain began. Even as it was, I judged by the  wailing of a great number of gulls that went crying and fishing round  the ship, that she must have drifted pretty near the coast or one of  the islands of the Hebrides; and at last, looking out of the door of the  round-house, I saw the great stone hills of Skye on the right hand, and,  a little more astern, the strange isle of Rum.          CHAPTER XI    THE CAPTAIN KNUCKLES UNDER    Alan and I sat down to breakfast about six of the clock. The floor was  covered with broken glass and in a horrid mess of blood, which took away  my hunger. In all other ways we were in a situation not only agreeable  but merry; having ousted the officers from their own cabin, and having  at command all the drink in the ship--both wine and spirits--and all the  dainty part of what was eatable, such as the pickles and the fine sort  of bread. This, of itself, was enough to set us in good humour, but the  richest part of it was this, that the two thirstiest men that ever came  out of Scotland (Mr. Shuan being dead) were now shut in the fore-part of  the ship and condemned to what they hated most--cold water.    \"And depend upon it,\" Alan said, \"we shall hear more of them ere long.  Ye may keep a man from the fighting, but never from his bottle.\"    We made good company for each other. Alan, indeed, expressed himself  most lovingly; and taking a knife from the table, cut me off one of the  silver buttons from his coat.    \"I had them,\" says he, \"from my father, Duncan Stewart; and now give ye  one of them to be a keepsake for last night's work. And wherever ye go  and show that button, the friends of Alan Breck will come around you.\"    He said this as if he had been Charlemagne, and commanded armies; and  indeed, much as I admired his courage, I was always in danger of smiling  at his vanity: in danger, I say, for had I not kept my countenance, I  would be afraid to think what a quarrel might have followed.    As soon as we were through with our meal he rummaged in the captain's  locker till he found a clothes-brush; and then taking off his coat,  began to visit his suit and brush away the stains, with such care and  labour as I supposed to have been only usual with women. To be sure, he  had no other; and, besides (as he said), it belonged to a king and so  behoved to be"]]]
