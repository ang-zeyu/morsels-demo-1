Here,  and here alone carriages can spank along, very slowly, officers can  ride, and the people can promenade \"en masse.\"    We were amazed at the sudden crowd we found ourselves amongst--like a  short, dense river of people streaming slowly in a mass. There is  practically no vehicular traffic--only the steady dense streams of human  beings of all sorts, all on a human footing. It must have been something  like this in the streets of imperial Rome, where no chariots might drive  and humanity was all on foot.    Little bunches of maskers, and single maskers danced and strutted along  in the thick flow under the trees. If you are a mask you don't walk like  a human being: you dance and prance along extraordinarily like the  life-size marionettes, conducted by wires from above. That is how you  go: with that odd jauntiness as if lifted and propelled by wires from  the shoulders. In front of me went a charming coloured harlequin, all in  diamond-shaped colours, and beautiful as a piece of china. He tripped  with the light, fantastic trip, quite alone in the thick crowd, and  quite blithe. Came two little children hand in hand in brilliant scarlet  and white costumes, sauntering calmly. They did not do the mask trip.  After a while a sky-blue girl with a high hat and full skirts, very  short, that went flip-flip-flip, as a ballet dancer's, whilst she  strutted; after her a Spanish grandee capering like a monkey. They  threaded among the slow stream of the crowd. Appeared Dante and  Beatrice, in Paradise apparently, all in white sheet-robes, and with  silver wreaths on their heads, arm in arm, and prancing very slowly and  majestically, yet with the long lilt as if hitched along by wires from  above. They were very good: all the well-known vision come to life,  Dante incorporate, and white as a shroud, with his tow-haired,  silver-crowned, immortal Beatrice on his arm, strutting the dark  avenues. He had the nose and cheek-bones and banded cheek, and the  stupid wooden look, and offered a modern criticism on the Inferno.           *       *       *       *       *    It had become quite dark, the lamps were lighted. We crossed the road to  the Cafe Roma, and found a table on the pavement among the crowd. In a  moment we had our tea. The evening was cold, with ice in the wind. But  the crowd surged on, back and forth, back and forth, slowly. At the  tables were seated mostly men, taking coffee or vermouth or aqua vitae,  all familiar and easy, without the modern self-consciousness. There was  a certain pleasant, natural robustness of spirit, and something of a  feudal free-and-easiness. Then arrived a family, with children, and  nurse in her native costume. They all sat at table together, perfectly  easy with one another, though the marvellous nurse seemed to be seated  below the salt. She was bright as a poppy, in a rose-scarlet dress of  fine cloth, with a curious little waistcoat of emerald green and purple,  and a bodice of soft, homespun linen with great full sleeves. On her  head she had a rose-scarlet and white head-dress, and she wore great  studs of gold filigree, and similar ear-rings. The feudal-bourgeois  family drank its syrup-drinks and watched the crowd. Most remarkable is  the complete absence of self-consciousness. They all have a perfect  natural \"sang-froid,\" the nurse in her marvellous native costume is as  thoroughly at her ease as if she were in her own village street. She  moves and speaks and calls to a passer-by without the slightest  constraint, and much more, without the slightest presumption. She is  below the invisible salt, the invisible but insuperable salt. And it  strikes me the salt-barrier is a fine thing for both parties: they both  remain natural and human on either side of it, instead of becoming  devilish, scrambling and pushing at the barricade.           *       *       *       *       *    The crowd is across the road, under the trees near the sea. On this side  stroll occasional pedestrians. And I see my first peasant in costume.  He is an elderly, upright, handsome man, beautiful in the  black-and-white costume. He wears the full-sleeved white shirt and the  close black bodice of thick, native frieze, cut low. From this sticks  out a short kilt or frill, of the same black frieze, a band of which  goes between the legs, between the full loose drawers of coarse linen.  The drawers are banded below the knee into tight black frieze gaiters.  On his head he has the long black stocking cap, hanging down behind. How  handsome he is, and so beautifully male! He walks with his hands loose  behind his back, slowly, upright, and aloof. The lovely  unapproachableness, indomitable. And the flash of the black and white,  the slow stride of the full white drawers, the black gaiters and black  cuirass with the bolero, then the great white sleeves and white breast  again, and once more the black cap--what marvellous massing of the  contrast, marvellous, and superb, as on a magpie.--How beautiful  maleness is, if it finds its right expression.--And how perfectly  ridiculous it is made in modern clothes.    There is another peasant too, a young one with a swift eye and hard  cheek and hard, dangerous thighs. He has folded his stocking cap, so  that it comes forward to his brow like a phrygian cap. He wears close  knee breeches and close sleeved waistcoat of thick brownish stuff that  looks like leather. Over the waistcoat a sort of cuirass of black, rusty  sheepskin, the curly wool outside. So he strides, talking to a comrade.  How fascinating it is, after the soft Italians, to see these limbs in  their close knee-breeches, so definite, so manly, with the old  fierceness in them still. One realises, with horror, that the race of  men is almost extinct in Europe. Only Christ-like heroes and  woman-worshipping Don Juans, and rabid equality-mongrels. The old,  hardy, indomitable male is gone. His fierce singleness is quenched. The  last sparks are dying out in Sardinia and Spain. Nothing left but the  herd-proletariat and the herd-equality mongrelism, and the wistful  poisonous self-sacrificial cultured soul. How detestable.    But that curious, flashing, black-and-white costume! I seem to have  known it before: to have worn it even: to have dreamed it. To have  dreamed it: to have had actual contact with it. It belongs in some way  to something in me--to my past, perhaps. I don't know. But the uneasy  sense of blood-familiarity haunts me. I _know_ I have known it before.  It is something of the same uneasiness I feel before Mount Eryx: but  without the awe this time.           *       *       *       *       *    In the morning the sun was shining from a blue, blue sky, but the  shadows were deadly cold, and the wind like a flat blade of ice. We went  out running to the sun. The hotel could not give us coffee and milk:  only a little black coffee. So we descended to the sea-front again, to  the Via Roma, and to our cafe. It was Friday: people seemed to be  bustling in from the country with huge baskets.    The Cafe Roma had coffee and milk, but no butter. We sat and watched the  movement outside. Tiny Sardinian donkeys, the tiniest things ever seen,  trotted their infinitesimal little paws along the road, drawing little  wagons like handcarts. Their proportion is so small, that they make a  boy walking at their side look like a tall man, while a natural man  looks like a Cyclops stalking hugely and cruelly. It is ridiculous for a  grown man to have one of these little creatures, hardly bigger than a  fly, hauling his load for him. One is pulling a chest of drawers on a  cart, and it seems to have a whole house behind it. Nevertheless it  plods bravely, away beneath the load, a wee thing.    They tell me there used to be flocks of these donkeys, feeding half wild  on the wild, moor-like hills of Sardinia. But the war--and also the  imbecile wantonness of the war-masters--consumed these flocks too, so  that few are left. The same with the cattle. Sardinia, home of cattle,  hilly little Argentine of the Mediterranean, is now almost deserted. It  is war, say the Italiana.--And also the wanton, imbecile, foul  lavishness of the war-masters. It was not alone the war which exhausted  the world. It was the deliberate evil wastefulness of the war-makers in  their own countries. Italy ruined Italy.           *       *       *       *       *    Two peasants in black-and-white are strolling in the sun, flashing. And  my dream of last evening was not a dream. And my nostalgia for something  I know not what was not an illusion. I feel it again, at once, at the  sight of the men in frieze and linen, a heart yearning for something I  have known, and which I want back again.    It is market day. We turn up the Largo Carlo-Felice, the second wide gap  of a street, a vast but very short boulevard, like the end of something.  Cagliari is like that: all bits and bobs. And by the side of the  pavement are many stalls, stalls selling combs and collar-studs, cheap  mirrors, handkerchiefs, shoddy Manchester goods, bed-ticking,  boot-paste, poor crockery, and so on. But we see also Madame of Cagliari  going marketing, with a servant accompanying her, carrying a huge  grass-woven basket: or returning from marketing, followed by a small  boy supporting one of these huge grass-woven baskets--like huge  dishes--on his head, piled with bread, eggs, vegetables, a chicken, and  so forth. Therefore we follow Madame going marketing, and find ourselves  in the vast market house, and it fairly glows with eggs: eggs in these  great round dish-baskets of golden grass: but eggs in piles, in mounds,  in heaps, a Sierra Nevada of eggs, glowing warm white. How they glow! I  have never noticed it before. But they give off a warm, pearly  effulgence into the air, almost a warmth. A pearly-gold heat seems to  come out of them. Myriads of eggs, glowing avenues of eggs.    And they are marked--60 centimes, 65 centimes.

No longer in dread of the Spaniards, the colonists saluted the  new-comers with the cannon by which a moment before they had hoped to  blow them out of the water. Laudonniere issued from his stronghold to  welcome them, and regaled them with what cheer he could. Ribaut was  present, conspicuous by his long beard, an astonishment to the Indians;  and here, too, were officers, old friends of Laudonniere. Why, then,  had they approached in the attitude of enemies? The mystery was soon  explained; for they expressed to the commandant their pleasure at  finding that the charges made against him had proved false. He begged  to know more; on which Ribaut, taking him aside, told him that the  returning ships had brought home letters filled with accusations  of arrogance, tyranny, cruelty, and a purpose of establishing an  independent command,--accusations which he now saw to be unfounded, but  which had been the occasion of his unusual and startling precaution.  He gave him, too, a letter from Admiral Coligny. In brief but courteous  terms, it required him to resign his command, and requested his return  to France to clear his name from the imputations cast upon it. Ribaut  warmly urged him to remain; but Laudonniere declined his friendly  proposals.    Worn in body and mind, mortified and wounded, he soon fell ill again. A  peasant woman attended him, who was brought over, he says, to nurse the  sick and take charge of the poultry, and of whom Le Moyne also speaks  as a servant, but who had been made the occasion of additional charges  against him, most offensive to the austere Admiral.    Stores were landed, tents were pitched, women and children were sent on  shore, feathered Indians mingled in the throng, and the borders of the  River of May swarmed with busy life. \"But, lo, how oftentimes misfortune  doth search and pursue us, even then when we thinke to be at rest!\"  exclaims the unhappy Laudonniere. Amidst the light and cheer of  renovated hope, a cloud of blackest omen was gathering in the east.    At half-past eleven on the night of Tuesday, the fourth of September,  the crew of Ribaut's flag-ship, anchored on the still sea outside the  bar, saw a huge hulk, grim with the throats of cannon, drifting towards  them through the gloom; and from its stern rolled on the sluggish air  the portentous banner of Spain.          CHAPTER VII. 1565.    MENENDEZ.    The monk, the inquisitor, and the Jesuit were lords of  Spain,--sovereigns of her sovereign, for they had formed the dark and  narrow mind of that tyrannical recluse. They had formed the minds of her  people, quenched in blood every spark of rising heresy, and given over  a noble nation to a bigotry blind and inexorable as the doom of fate.  Linked with pride, ambition, avarice, every passion of a rich, strong  nature, potent for good and ill, it made the Spaniard of that day a  scourge as dire as ever fell on man.    Day was breaking on the world. Light, hope, and freedom pierced with  vitalizing ray the clouds and the miasma that hung so thick over the  prostrate Middle Age, once noble and mighty, now a foul image of decay  and death. Kindled with new life, the nations gave birth to a progeny of  heroes, and the stormy glories of the sixteenth century rose on awakened  Europe. But Spain was the citadel of darkness,--a monastic cell, an  inquisitorial dungeon, where no ray could pierce. She was the bulwark of  the Church, against whose adamantine wall the waves of innovation beat  in vain. [19] In every country of Europe the party of freedom and  reform was the national party, the party of reaction and absolutism was  the Spanish party, leaning on Spain, looking to her for help. Above all,  it was so in France; and, while within her bounds there was for a time  some semblance of peace, the national and religious rage burst forth  on a wilder theatre. Thither it is for us to follow it, where, on the  shores of Florida, the Spaniard and the Frenchman, the bigot and the  Huguenot, met in the grapple of death.    In a corridor of his palace, Philip the Second was met by a man who had  long stood waiting his approach, and who with proud reverence placed a  petition in the hand of the pale and sombre King.    The petitioner was Pedro Menendez de Aviles, one of the ablest and most  distinguished officers of the Spanish marine. He was born of an ancient  Asturian family. His boyhood had been wayward, ungovernable, and fierce.  He ran off at eight years of age, and when, after a search of six  months, he was found and brought back, he ran off again. This time he  was more successful, escaping on board a fleet bound against the  Barbary corsairs, where his precocious appetite for blood and blows had  reasonable contentment. A few years later, he found means to build a  small vessel, in which he cruised against the corsairs and the French,  and, though still hardly more than a boy, displayed a singular address  and daring. The wonders of the New World now seized his imagination.  He made a voyage thither, and the ships under his charge came back  freighted with wealth. The war with France was then at its height. As  captain-general of the fleet, he was sent with troops to Flanders; and  to their prompt arrival was due, it is said, the victory of St. Quentin.  Two years later, he commanded the luckless armada which bore back Philip  to his native shore. On the way, the King narrowly escaped drowning in  a storm off the port of Laredo. This mischance, or his own violence and  insubordination, wrought to the prejudice of Menendez. He complained  that his services were ill repaid. Philip lent him a favoring ear, and  despatched him to the Indies as general of the fleet and army. Here he  found means to amass vast riches; and, in 1561, on his return to Spain,  charges were brought against him of a nature which his too friendly  biographer does not explain. The Council of the Indies arrested him. He  was imprisoned and sentenced to a heavy fine; but, gaining his release,  hastened to court to throw himself on the royal clemency. His petition  was most graciously received. Philip restored his command, but remitted  only half his fine, a strong presumption of his guilt.    Menendez kissed the royal hand; he had another petition in reserve. His  son had been wrecked near the Bermudas, and he would fain go thither  to find tidings of his fate. The pious King bade him trust in God, and  promised that he should be despatched without delay to the Bermudas and  to Florida, with a commission to make an exact survey of the neighboring  seas for the profit of future voyagers; but Menendez was not content  with such an errand. He knew, he said, nothing of greater moment to his  Majesty than the conquest and settlement of Florida. The climate was  healthful, the soil fertile; and, worldly advantages aside, it was  peopled by a race sunk in the thickest shades of infidelity. \"Such  grief,\" he pursued, \"seizes me, when I behold this multitude of wretched  Indians, that I should choose the conquest and settling of Florida above  all commands, offices, and dignities which your Majesty might bestow.\"  Those who take this for hypocrisy do not know the Spaniard of the  sixteenth century.    The King was edified by his zeal. An enterprise of such spiritual and  temporal promise was not to be slighted, and Menendez was empowered  to conquer and convert Florida at his own cost. The conquest was to be  effected within three years. Menendez was to take with him five hundred  men, and supply them with five hundred slaves, besides horses, cattle,  sheep, and hogs. Villages were to be built, with forts to defend them,  and sixteen ecclesiastics, of whom four should be Jesuits, were to  form the nucleus of a Floridan church. The King, on his part, granted  Menendez free trade with Hispaniola, Porto Rico, Cuba, and Spain, the  office of Adelantado of Florida for life, with the right of naming his  successor, and large emoluments to be drawn from the expected conquest.    The compact struck, Menendez hastened to his native Asturias to raise  money among his relatives. Scarcely was he gone, when tidings reached  Madrid that Florida was already occupied by a colony of French  Protestants, and that a reinforcement, under Ribaut, was on the point  of sailing thither. A French historian of high authority declares that  these advices came from the Catholic party at the French court, in whom  every instinct of patriotism was lost in their hatred of Coligny and the  Huguenots. Of this there can be little doubt, though information also  came about this time from the buccaneer Frenchmen captured in the West  Indies.    Foreigners had invaded the territory of Spain. The trespassers, too,  were heretics, foes of God, and liegemen of the Devil. Their doom was  fixed. But how would France endure an assault, in time of peace, on  subjects who had gone forth on an enterprise sanctioned by the Crown,  and undertaken in its name and under its commission?    The throne of France, in which the corruption of the nation seemed  gathered to a head, was trembling between the two parties of the  Catholics and the Huguenots, whose chiefs aimed at royalty. Flattering  both, caressing both, playing one against the other, and betraying both,  Catherine de Medicis, by a thousand crafty arts and expedients of the  moment, sought to retain the crown on the head of her weak and vicious  son. Of late her crooked policy had led her towards the Catholic party,  in other words the party of Spain; and she had already given ear to the  savage Duke of Alva, urging her to the course which, seven years later,  led to the carnage of St. Bartholomew. In short, the Spanish policy was  in the ascendant, and no thought of the national interest or honor  could restrain that basest of courts from abandoning by hundreds to  the national enemy those whom it was itself meditating to immolate by  thousands.
