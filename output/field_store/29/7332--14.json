[Illustration: _A table mat made from carpet wool_]    [Sidenote: _Purses, or chatelaine bags_]    Purses, or chatelaine bags, are made of knitting-silk. Beads can be  added, if desired. Adjust the loom for the required size, and string a  continuous warp, if necessary. One can obtain the silver or nickel tops,  which open and close, at the department stores.    [Illustration: _Borders for rugs or squares_]    [Sidenote: _Shopping and school bags_]    [Sidenote: _Opera glass bags_]    It will be better to use heavier material for shopping and school bags.  Raffia makes a strong bag; silk strips are serviceable, and leather  strips are good for school bags. For opera-glass bags, make two mats and  lace or weave them together, or string a continuous warp. Use rope silk,  chenille, or knitting silk with beads.    [Illustration: _Borders for rugs or squares_]    When one has mastered the mysteries of weaving thoroughly enough to make  a _good_ mat, it is very easy to \"turn them into\" various articles.  There is no sleight of hand about it.    [Sidenote: _Panels of silk canvas for boxes_]    Silk canvas panels are made by adjusting the loom for the required size  of the sides of the box, and weaving a plain mat for the top. A number  of suggestions have been given on page 52, under the head of Materials.    Pretty neckties of fine knitting silk can be made on the loom by using a  continuous warp of the same material.    [Illustration: _A square of silk canvas with cross-stitched pattern of  chenille_]    [Sidenote: _Sofa pillows, cushions, sachet cases and veil cases_]    The accompanying illustration, and another on page 98, and also the  vignette on the title page, show squares of silk canvas, and will give  one many ideas of how they may be used. One has a cross-stitched pattern  of chenille, and in another the chenille was alternated with silk in the  warp, and both chenille and silk were used in the woof. The squares can  be made up in cushion and box covers, sachet cases, sofa pillows, or the  larger squares can be used as veil cases. A number of them can be joined  for large sofa pillows. In the latter case they can be made of wool, and  many of them could be crocheted together for an afghan or slumber robe.    [Illustration: _Pattern for rugs or squares_]    The design in the illustration is a pattern which may be used for  either a Wilton or Axminster rug, or for mats, sachet cases, cushion or  box covers, or cross-stitch embroidery on burlap, or silk, or wool  canvas. The patterns given on pages 120, 125, 130, and 134 will be found  adaptable for rugs or squares.    [Sidenote: _Slumber robes or afghans_]    [Sidenote: _Portieres_]    Slumber robes or afghans have been previously mentioned on page 54,  under the head of Materials. It will be found very easy, after a little  experience with a continuous warp, to make strips of any length. It is  better to wind the extra lengths of warp upon spools, as has been  suggested, or around the tops of the rods. Large portieres can be made  of long strips of silk or silkoline cut bias. Fasten the long strips  together horizontally in imitation of Bagdad curtains.    [Illustration: _Borders for rugs or squares_]    [Sidenote: _Hair receivers_]    Hair receivers are easily made from raffia. Make a square mat and fold  it in cornucopia form.          Chapter Twelve    ORIENTAL RUGS      [Sidenote: _Rugs and draperies_]    To be quite up to date, Miss Dolly should have oriental rugs and  draperies in her house beautiful. These are easily made on the loom, and  the little girl or boy, who has first copied a pattern and then seen it  grow under patient fingers, has a thing of beauty and a joy forever.  What could give more pleasure than to be able to say fifty years from  now: \"I wove that, my dear, when I went to school\"? Truly the  grandchildren would reply: \"How I wish I could have gone to grandma's  school!\"--only they may have something equally beautiful which will take  its place in that far-off time--who knows?    [Illustration: _Border for rugs or squares_]    [Illustration: _Borders for rugs or squares_]    [Sidenote: _Patterns_]    [Sidenote: _Oriental colors_]    The patterns for oriental rugs familiar in the East have descended  through hundreds of years, and the exquisite colors, produced by  vegetable dyes, and increasing in richness and beauty with age, are only  to be seen in old rugs. We have nothing in our modern dyes to compare  with the old color. One is soon interested in the study of these Eastern  treasures, and it becomes second nature in a short time not only to chat  familiarly of Kermans, Serebends, Khivas, Bokharas, and Kiz-Kilims, _ad  infinitum_, but to jot down now and then in one's notebook, or still  better in one's design book (made of the kindergarten squared paper,  one-eighth inch), a pretty border or centerpiece for the rug which is to  grace some doll house. The patterns of Turkish rugs (see page 127) are  of geometrical or arabesque designs--an edict from the Koran having  prohibited the reproduction of living things. The Persians, however,  weave animals, birds, etc., as their ancestors did in days gone by.    [Sidenote: _Inscriptions on Persian rugs_]    There is some very interesting reading in \"Oriental Rug Weaving,\" by V.  Kurdji, on the subject of inscriptions often found on Persian rugs. He  says: \"If the possessors of some of the rare pieces that are sold in  this country knew the meaning of the inscriptions woven in their rugs,  the knowledge would add a charm and interest which would make them more  valuable than the harmonious colors so beautifully blended.\"    [Illustration: _Pattern for border of Persian rug_]    [Sidenote: _Bokkara rugs_]    [Sidenote: _Khiva rugs_]    Oriental rugs take their names from the countries or provinces in which  they are made. Bokhara rugs are made in mountainous districts of  Turkestan, and have never been successfully imitated, because the dyes  used are made from a plant grown only in that district. The designs are  geometrical, and the colors deep maroon or blue. The pile is woven as  close as velvet. They are noted for the superior quality of their dyes.  Khiva rugs, sometimes called afghan, are made in Turkestan. They  resemble the Bokhara rugs, but are coarser in texture and heavier in  pile, and they differ from them in having a wide selvage at each end.  Some Khivas have a small pattern in red mosaic over the surface with a  circle in the center. One often sees a rug made of a rich golden yellow  with a background of dark red.    [Illustration: _A Kiz-Kilim rug pattern_]    [Illustration: _Pattern for a Kiz-Kilim stripe_]    [Sidenote: _Kiz-Kilim rugs_]    The Kiz-Kilim rugs have no nap, and are woven with a needle. They are  thin and almost alike on both sides. The larger sizes are woven in two  strips fastened together so that they can be taken apart and used for  curtains. \"These Kiz-Kilims are woven by Armenians and Turks in Anatolia  (the land of sunrise, and the Greek name for Asia Minor). The literal  translation of the word Kiz-Kilim is bride's rug, it being a custom in  that country for a bride to present to her husband one of these rugs,  which she has woven during her engagement to him. The quality of the rug  is supposed to measure the quality of the husband's affection for his  bride, consequently we have many beautiful specimens of this class, the  brilliant hues and intricate designs of which could only have been  inspired by the whisperings of Cupid. They are in open-work  patterns--called perforated--and often have long tufts of colored silk  tied to the rugs with blue beads, in order to keep them from the effects  of the Evil Eye.\" The Kiz-Kilim rug in the illustration was copied from  a genuine rug. The filling is a deep blue and the borders are in  oriental colors. The center figure is white, with red, brown, and yellow  inside. There are four kinds of Kilims. Much interesting and valuable  information can be found in John Kimberley Mumford's \"Oriental Rugs\";  New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1900, where directions for weaving  Kiz-Kilims, Khivas, and Bokharas are given, with a few patterns.    [Illustration: _A Kiz-Kilim rug_]    [Sidenote: _Materials used_]    [Sidenote: _Perforations_]    [Illustration: _Pattern for a Turkish rug_]    Oriental wools or carpet ravelings are used for these rugs. Copy your  figures and colors from genuine rugs. The accompanying patterns were  obtained in this way. See directions on page 47 for stringing a double  warp with fringe at each end. First fasten the pattern under the warp;  then weave about one-quarter inch at each end with carpet thread like  the warp. This will make it look like a \"truly\" Kiz-Kilim. Next to  this, weave a very narrow strip of several colors each twice across,  regarding the double strings as one. Then weave each part of the narrow  border. To make the perforations, take up one thread of the double warp  for one side of the pattern, and the other thread for weaving the  pattern next to it. For instance, the \"steps,\" as the children call  them, of triangle No. 1, when finished, will stand close to the steps of  triangle No. 2, with a little slit between. These perforations occur  only where one pattern joins another of a different color, or the dark  filling. For instance, in the white figure in the center, where three or  five squares come together, the slits occur at each end, the part  between being woven over the double strings as if they were only one. In  this way the perforations of other parts are closed top and bottom. Use  a tape needle and weave each section of the pattern separately. Weave  the filling last. As this peculiar tone of blue could not be obtained in  carpet ravelings, an eighth of a yard of terry was raveled for the  purpose. Take care not to draw any part of the pattern too tight, or the  perforations will be too "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3165"],[0,"Rashi (#14)"],[1,"shi's geographical  knowledge, it will suffice to recall how he represented the  configuration of Palestine and Babylonia, or rather how he tried  to guess it from the texts.[33] His ignorance of geography is  apparent in his commentaries, which contain a rather large number  of mistakes.  In addition, Rashi was not always familiar with  natural products, or with the creations of art, or with the  customs and usages of distant countries.  Still less was a rabbi  of the eleventh century likely to have an idea of what even  Maimonides was unacquainted with, the local color and the spirit  of dead civilizations.  Rashi-to exemplify this ignoranceexplained  Biblical expressions by customs obtaining in his own day: \"to  put into possession,\" the Hebrew of which is \"to fill the hand,\"  he thinks he explains by comparing it with a feudal ceremony and  discovering in it something analagous [analogous sic] to the act  of putting on gauntlets.  In general, the authors of Rashi's  time, paying little regard to historic setting, explained  ancient texts by popular legends, or by Christian or feudal  customs.  Therefore, one need not scruple to point out this  defect in Rashi's knowledge.  Like his compatriots he did not  know the profane branches of learning.  He was subject to the  same limitations as nearly the entire body of clergy of his day.  While the Arabs so eagerly and successfully cultivated  philosophy, medicine, astronomy, and physics, Christian Europe  was practically ignorant of these sciences.  Finally, one will  judge still less severely of Rashi's knowledge-or lack of  knowledge-if one remembers what science was in the Christian  world of the middle ages-it was childish, tinged with  superstition, extravagantly absurd, and fantastically naive.  Rashi believed that the Nile flooded its banks once every forty  years; but Joinville, who lived two centuries later, and who was  in Egypt, tells even more astonishing things than this about the  marvellous [marvelous sic] river, which has its source in the  terrestrial Paradise.    Besides French, the only profane language Rashi knew was German.  The explanations he gives according to the Greek, the Arabic, and  the Persian, he obtains from secondary sources.  Indeed, they are  sometimes faulty, and they reveal the ignorance of the man who  reproduced without comprehending them.  No great interest  attaches to the mention of his chronological mistakes and his  confusion of historical facts.  His astronomic knowledge is very  slight, and resolves itself into what he borrowed from the  Italian Sabbatai Donnolo, of Oria (about 950).    But limited as his knowledge was to Biblical, Talmudic, and  Rabbinical literature, it was for that reason all the greater in  the province he had explored in its inmost recesses.  This is  shown by his numerous citations, the sureness of his touch, and  his mastery of all the subjects of which he treats.    Thanks to the citations, we can definitely ascertain what we  might call his library.    Needless to say, the first place was held by the Bible, which, as  will be seen, he knew perfectly.  He wrote commentaries upon the  Bible almost in its entirety, besides frequently referring to it  in his Talmudic commentaries.  His favorite guide for the  explanation of the Pentateuch is the Aramaic version by Onkelos.  For the Prophets he used the Targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel.[34]  He was entirely ignorant of the Apocryphal books.  The Wisdom of  Ben Sira, for instance, like the <I>Megillat Taanit,</I> or Roll  of Fasts,[35] were known to him only through the citations of the  Talmud.    On the other hand Rashi was thoroughly conversant with the whole  field of Talmudic literature-first of all the treatises on  religious jurisprudence, the <I>Mishnah,</I>[36]  <I>Tosefta,</I>[37] the Babylonian and, in part, the Palestinian  <I>Gemara;</I>[36] then, the Halakic Midrashim, such as the  <I>Mekilta,</I> the <I>Sifra,</I> the <I>Sifre,</I>[38] and  Haggadic compilations, such as the <I>Rabbot,</I>[39] the Midrash  on the Song of Songs, on Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, the Psalms,  and Samuel, the <I>Pesikta,</I>[40] the <I>Tanhuma,</I>[41] and  the <I>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer.</I>[42]    According to tradition, Rashi has set the Talmudic period as the  date of composition of two works which modern criticism has  placed in the period of the Geonim.  These works are the historic  chronicle <I>Seder Olam</I>[43] and the gnostic or mystic treatise  on the Creation, the <I>Sefer Yezirah;</I> the forerunner of  the Kabbalah.  Besides these anonymous works, Rashi knew the  Responsa of the Geonim, which he frequently cites, notably those  of Sherira[44] and his son Hai,[45] the <I>Sheeltot</I> of R.  Aha,[46] and the <I>Halakot Gedolot,</I> attributed by the French  school to Yehudai Gaon.[47] In the same period must be placed two  other writers concerning whom we are not wholly enlightened,  Eleazar ha-Kalir and the author of the Jewish chronicle entitled  <I>Yosippon.</I>  Eleazar, who lived in the eighth or ninth  century, was one of the first liturgical poets both as to time  and as to merit.  The author of the <I>Yosippon</I> undoubtedly  lived in Italy in the tenth century.  Rashi, like all his  contemporaries, confounded the two respectively with the Tanna R.  Eleazar and the celebrated Josephus.  They were considered  authorities by all the rabbis of the middle ages, the first for  his language and his Midrashic traditions, the second for his  historical knowledge.[48]    So far as the literature contemporary, or nearly contemporary,  with Rashi is concerned, it must be stated that Rashi had read  all the works written in Hebrew, while the whole of Arabic  literature was inaccessible to him.  Without doubt he knew the  grammarian Judah Ibn Koreish[49] only by the citations from him.  On the other hand he made much use of the works of the two  Spanish grammarians, Menahem ben Saruk and Dunash ben  Labrat,[50] likewise the works of Moses haDarshan, of Narbonne.  Naturally, he was still better versed in all the rabbinical  literature of Northern France and of Germany.  He frequently cites  R. Gershom, whom he once called \"Father and Light of the  Captivity,\" as well as his contemporaries Joseph Tob Elem,  Eliezer the Great, and Meshullam ben Kalonymos, of Mayence.  I  have already mentioned-and will repeat further on how much he  owed his teachers.    For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to add to this list  all the contemporaries from whom Rashi learned either directly or  indirectly.  For information concerning the Talmud, Isaac ben  Menahem the Great, of Orleans, may be mentioned among these; and  for information concerning the Bible, Menahem ben Helbo, whom  Rashi probably cited through the medium of one of his pupils or  his writings, for he himself was not known to Rashi, his younger  contemporary.    If one also takes into consideration the less important and the  anonymous persons whose books or oral teachings Rashi cited, one  will be convinced that he had what is called a well-stocked  brain, and that his knowledge in his special domain was as vast  as it was profound, since it embraced the entire field of  knowledge which the Jews of Northern France of that time could  possibly cultivate.  His learning was not universal; far from it;  but he was master of all the knowledge his countrymen possessed.    Thanks to this erudition, he could fill, at least in part, the  gaps in his scientific education.  In fact, an understanding of  Talmudic law presupposes a certain amount of information-geometry  and botany for questions concerning land, astronomy for the  fixation of the calendar, zoology for dietary laws, and so on.  Rashi's knowledge, then, was less frequently defective than one  is led to suppose, although sometimes he lagged behind the Talmud  itself.  It has been noted that of 127 or 128 French glosses  bearing upon the names of plants, 62 are absolutely correct.  In  history Rashi preserved some traditions which we can no longer  verify, but which seem to be derived from sources worthy of  confidence; and if it had not been for Rashi, we would not have  become acquainted with them.    What he knew, therefore, he knew chiefly through reading and  through the instruction of his teachers, to whom he often  appealed; for he possessed that most precious quality in a  scholar, conscience, scientific probity.  One example will  suffice to give an idea of his method.  Once, when he was  searching for a text in his copy of the Talmud, he found it  corrected.  But he did not remember if he himself or his teacher  had made the correction.  So he consulted a manuscript in which  he had noted down the variants of his teacher Isaac of Mayence.  Not being able to determine from this, he begged his  correspondent to look up the manuscript of Isaac and to let him  know the reading.    This characteristic leads us back to a consideration of Rashi's  nature, upon which one likes to dwell, because it makes him a  sage in the most beautiful and the largest meaning of the word,  because it makes him one of the most sympathetic personalities in  all Jewish history.  If Rashi had left nothing but the remembrance  of an exemplary life and of spotless virtue, his name would have  merited immortality.    But Rashi bequeathed more than this to posterity; he left one,  nay, two monuments to awaken admiration and call forth gratitude.  They assure him fame based on a solid foundation.  What matter if  we Jews fail to honor our great men with statues of marble and  bronze, if they themselves establish their glory on pedestals  that defy the ravages of time? Statues raised by the hand of man  are perishable as man himself; the works constructed by a genius  are immortal as the genius himself.
