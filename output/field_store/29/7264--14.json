The invention of the  printing press acted as a wonderful stimulus to the development of  Jewish literature. The first products of the new machine were Hebrew  works issued in Italy and Spain. Among the promoters of the Renaissance,  and one of the most thorough students of religio-philosophical systems,  was Elias del Medigo, the friend of Pico della Mirandola, and the umpire  chosen by the quarrelling factions in the University of Padua. John  Reuchlin, chief of the humanists, was taught Hebrew by Obadiah Sforno,  a _savant_ of profound scholarship, who dedicated his \"Commentary on  Ecclesiastes\" to Henry II. of France. Abraham de Balmes was a teacher at  the universities of Padua and Salerno, and physician in ordinary to  Cardinal Dominico Grimani. The Kabbala was made accessible to the heroes  of the Renaissance by Jochanan Alemanno, of Mantua, and there is pathos  in the urgency with which Reuchlin entreats Jacob Margoles, rabbi of  Nuremberg, to send him Kabbalistic writings in addition to those in his  possession. Reuchlin's good offices to the Jews--his defense of them  against the attacks of obscurantists--are a matter of general knowledge.  Among the teachers of the humanists who revealed to them the treasures  of biblical literature the most prominent was Elias Levita, the  introducer, through his disciples Sebastian Muenster and Paul Fagius, of  Hebrew studies into Germany. He may be accounted a true humanist, a  genuine exponent of the Renaissance. His Jewish coadjutors were Judah  Abrabanel (Leo Hebraeus), whose chief work was _Dialoghi di Amore_, an  exposition of the Neoplatonism then current in Italy; Jacob Mantino,  physician to Pope Paul III.; Bonet di Lattes, known as a writer on  astronomical subjects, and the inventor of an astronomical instrument;  and a number of others.    While in Italy the Spanish-Jewish exiles fell into line in the  Renaissance movement, the large numbers of them that sought refuge in  Portugal turned their attention chiefly to astronomical research and to  voyages of discovery and adventure, the national enterprises of their  protectors. Joao II. employed Jews in investigations tending to make  reasonably safe the voyages, on trackless seas, under unknown skies, for  the discovery of long and ardently sought passages to distant lands. In  his commission charged with the construction of an instrument to  indicate accurately the course of a vessel, the German knight Martin  Behaim was assisted by Jews--astronomers, metaphysicians, and  physicians--chief among them Joseph Vecinho, distinguished for his part  in the designing of the artificial globe, and Pedro di Carvallho,  navigator, whose claim to praise rests upon his improvement of Leib's  _Astrologium_, and to censure, upon his abetment of the king when he  refused the request of the bold Genoese Columbus to fit out a squadron  for the discovery of wholly unknown lands. But when Columbus's plans  found long deferred realization in Spain, a Jewish youth, Luis de  Torres, embarked among the ninety adventurers who accompanied him. Vasco  da Gama likewise was aided in his search for a waterway to the Indies by  a Jew, the pilot Gaspar, the same who later set down in writing the  scientific results of the voyage, and two Jews were despatched to  explore the coasts of the Red Sea and the island of Ormus in the Persian  Gulf. Again, Vasco da Gama's plans were in part made with the valuable  assistance of a Jew, a profound scholar, Abraham Zacuto, sometime  professor of astronomy at the University of Salamanca, and after the  banishment of Jews from Spain, astronomer and chronographer to Manuel  the Great, of Portugal. It was he that advised the king to send out Da  Gama's expedition, and from the first the explorer was supported by his  counsel and scientific knowledge.    Meritorious achievements, all of them, but they did not shield the Jews  against impending banishment. The exiles found asylums in Italy and  Holland, and in each country they at once projected themselves into the  predominant intellectual movement. A physician, Abraham Portaleone,  distinguished himself on the field of antiquarian research; another,  David d'Ascoli, wrote a defense of Jews; and a third, David de Pomis, a  defense of Jewish physicians. The most famous was Amatus Lusitanus, one  of whose important discoveries is said to have brought him close up to  that of the circulation of the blood. Before the banishment of Jews from  Spain took effect, Antonio di Moro, a Jewish peddler of Cordova,  flourished as the last of Spanish troubadours, and Rodrigo da Cota, a  neo-Christian of Seville, as the first of Spanish dramatists, the  supposed author of _Celestina_, one of the most celebrated of old  Spanish dramatic compositions.    The proscribed, in the guise of Marranos, and under the hospitable  shelter of their new homes, could not be banished from literary Spain,  even in its newest departures. Indeed, for a long time Spanish and  Italian literatures were brought into contact with each other only  through the instrumentality of Jews. Not quite half a century after the  expulsion of Jews from Portugal and their settlement in Italy, a Jew,  Solomon Usque, made a Spanish translation of Petrarch (1567), dedicated  to Alessandro Farnese, duke of Parma, and wrote Italian odes, dedicated  to Cardinal Borromeo.    At the zenith of the Renaissance, Jews won renown as Italian poets, and  did valiant work as translators from Latin into Hebrew and Italian. In  the later days of the movement, in the Reformation period, illustrious  Christian scholars studied Hebrew under Jewish tutorship, and gave it a  place on the curriculum of the universities. Luther himself submitted to  rabbinical guidance in his biblical studies.    In great numbers the Spanish exiles turned to Turkey, where numerous new  communities rapidly arose. There, too, in Constantinople and elsewhere,  Jews, like Elias Mizrachi and Elias Kapsali, were the first to pursue  scientific research.    We have now reached the days of deepest misery for Judaism. Yet, in the  face of unrelenting oppression, Jews win places of esteem as diplomats,  custodians and advocates of important interests at royal courts. From  the earliest period of their history, Jews manifested special talent for  the arts of diplomacy. In the Arabic-Spanish period they exercised great  political influence upon Mohammedan caliphs. The Fatimide and Omayyad  dynasties employed Jewish representatives and ministers, Samuel ibn  Nagdela, for instance, being grand vizir of the caliph of Granada.  Christian sovereigns also valued their services: as is well known,  Charlemagne sent a Jewish ambassador to Haroun al Rashid; Pope  Alexander III. appointed Yechiel ben Abraham as minister of finance; and  so late as in the fifteenth century the wise statesman Isaac Abrabanel  was minister to Alfonso V., of Portugal, and, wonderful to relate, for  eight years to Ferdinand and Isabella, of Spain. At this time Jewish  literature was blessed with a patron in the person of Joseph Nasi, duke  of Naxos, whom, it is said, Sultan Selim II. wished to crown king of  Cyprus. His rival was Solomon Ashkenazi, Turkish ambassador to the  Venetian republic, who exercised decisive influence upon the election of  a Polish king. And this is not the end of the roll of Jewish diplomats  and ministers.    Unfortunately, the Kabbala, whose spell was cast about even the most  vigorous of Jewish minds, was the leading intellectual current of those  sad days, the prevailing misery but serving to render her allurements  more fascinating. But in the hands of such men as Abraham Herrera, who  influenced Benedict Spinoza, even Kabbalistic studies were informed with  a scientific spirit, and brought into connection with Neoplatonic  philosophy.    Mention of Spinoza suggests Holland where Jews were kindly received, and  shortly after their arrival they interested themselves in the  philosophical pursuits in vogue. The best index to their position in  Holland is furnished by Manasseh ben Israel's prominent role in the  politics and the literary ventures of Amsterdam, and by his negotiations  with Oliver Cromwell. We may pardon the pride which made him say, \"I  have enjoyed the friendship of the wisest and the best of Europe.\" Uriel  Acosta and Baruch Spinoza, though children of the Amsterdam  _Judengasse_, were ardent patriots.    The last great Spanish poet was Antonio Enrique de Gomez, the Jewish  Calderon, burnt in effigy at Seville; while the last Portuguese poet of  note was Antonio Jose de Silva, who perished at the stake for his faith,  leaving his dramas as a precious possession to Portuguese literature.    Even in the dreariest days of decadence, when the study of the Talmud  seemed to engross their attention, Jews prosecuted scientific inquiries,  as witness Moses Isserles's translation of _Theorica_, an astronomical  treatise by Peurbach, the Vienna humanist.    With the migration of Jews eastward, _Judendeutsch_, a Jewish-German  dialect, with its literature, was introduced into Slavic countries. It  is a fact not generally known that this jargon is the depository of  certain Middle High German expressions and elements no longer used in  the modern German, and that philologists are forced to resort to the  study of the Polish-Jewish patois to reconstruct the old idiom. In 1523,  the year of Luther's Pentateuch translation, a Jewish-German Bible  dictionary was published at Cracow, and in 1540 appeared the first  Jewish-German translation of the Pentateuch. The Germans strongly  influenced the popular literature of the Jews. The two nationalities  seized the same subjects, often imitating the same models, or using the  same translations. The German \"Till Eulenspiegel\" was printed in 1500,  the Jewish-German in 1600. Besides incorporating German folklore,  Jewish-German writings borrowed from German romances,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27911"],[0,"The Giraffe Hunters (#14)"],[1," alarm; threw up their heads, snorted, and galloped  to and fro, as if uncertain which way to retreat.    Next moment, from among the moving trees, emerged a herd of elephants,  each or most of them uttering trumpet-like cries as they entered upon  the open plain.    The horses galloped off the ground; and the hunters, believing that  their lives depended on recovering them, started in pursuit.    Almost on the instant, this purpose had to be relinquished.  One of the  elephants, in advance of its fellows, was charging upon them; and they  would have enough to do to secure their own retreat.  The others went  after the horses, and all seemed to have gone mad with the exception of  three or four that remained by the pool.    The situation of the hunters was now one of imminent danger.  A  well-directed volley might stop the charge of the elephant rushing  towards them, and put the others to flight.  This seemed to be the idea  of all three; for each took aim at the same instant of time and fired in  the same direction.  The volley was delivered in vain.  The elephant,  with louder rear and longer strides, came thundering on, only infuriated  by their attempt to check its course.    There was no time to reload; and all three retreated, with a terrible  apprehension of being overtaken, and that one or two others of them  should fall a victim to the gigantic pursuer.  They ran towards the  stream.  To have gone in any other direction would have been to impale  themselves upon the trunks of the other elephants, now also coming  towards them, aroused to rage by the cry of their wounded companion.    They succeeded in reaching the bank, and thought of throwing themselves  into the water; when a shout from Arend counselled them to a different  course.    \"Follow me,\" cried he, and the next instant he was seen upon the trunk  of a cotton-tree that had fallen across the stream.    So close was the enraged elephant by this time, that Groot Willem, who  was hindmost, felt the tip of its trunk touching the calf of one of his  legs, as he scrambled on to the tree.    The top of the tree was several feet lower than the bank of the river  where its roots still adhered; and in descending the trunk, they had, as  Hendrik said, to \"climb downwards.\"    The branches had lodged on some rocks in the middle of the stream, which  had prevented the tree from being carried away by the current that ran  rapidly past the spot.    For a while, they considered themselves safe; and, although their  situation would have been far from agreeable under ordinary  circumstances, they experienced the indescribable emotions of happiness  that are felt after a narrow escape from some great peril.    The elephant was tearing at the upturned roots of the tree, and making  other impotent attempts to get at them.  They were besieged, but in no  danger for the time of a closer acquaintance with the besieger.    On examining their place of refuge, they saw that the rock on which the  tops of the tree rested, was not more than thirty feet in circumference  at the water's edge; and not half that at the top, which was about ten  feet in diameter.    There was but little more than room for them to stand upon it; but, as  the branches were large and long, they had plenty of room to move about,  proceeding in much the same manner as monkeys would have done in a  similar situation.    From the behaviour of the enemy, he seemed to have come to a perfect  understanding of the position in which they were placed; and, for a  minute or two, he appeared to be meditating whether he should abandon  the siege, or continue it.    Meanwhile, the hunters, after resting for a few moments from their late  severe exertion, commenced reloading their rifles and preparing for  further hostilities.    As though aware of their intention, the elephant quietly walked away.    \"He is off now,\" said Groot Willem, \"but we had better not be in any  hurry to follow him.  I can endure a little more rest.\"    \"I hope we shall not have to make a longer stay than will be agreeable,\"  remarked Hendrik.  \"But we must not leave here until the whole herd has  taken its departure.  Unlike any we have seen before, these elephants do  not seem to be the least afraid of us.\"    The position in which our hunters were placed was several feet below the  level of the river's bank, so that they were unable to see anything of  the plain above.    Arend proposed returning up the trunk of the tree and giving the enemy a  parting shot, should the animal be still within range.    To this, Groot Willem and Hendrik objected.  They were willing the  elephant should depart, if so inclined, without further molestation from  them.    A few minutes passed and Arend again proposed going up to see if their  enemy was near.  This was also opposed by the others.    \"No, not yet,\" said Willem.  \"Let us not show ourselves on any account.  He may be still watching for us, and, seeing you, may think we are  impatient to get away.  That would encourage him to remain.  We must be  as cautious as if we were dealing with a human enemy.\"    Half an hour passed, and then Groot Willem ascended the tree, until his  head was on a level with the bank.  One glance was sufficient, and, with  a grave countenance, he looked back to his companions.    \"It is as I thought,\" said he, \"the brute is still there.  He is  watching for us.  He wants revenge; and I believe that he'll have it.  We shall be hungry before we get away from here.\"    \"Where is he?\" asked Hendrik.    \"At the pool close by, giving himself a shower-bath; but I can see that  he keeps constantly turning his eye in this direction.\"    \"Is he alone?\" inquired Arend.    \"Yes; the others appear to have gone off.  There is only himself by the  pool.  We have wounded him; but, for all that, he is able to move  rapidly about; and we shall have to kill him outright before we can pass  him upon the plain.\"    To this there was no answer, and, Groot Willem again returning to the  rock, all three laid hold of their guns, and prepared to attack the  enemy.        CHAPTER TWENTY ONE.    A CREATURE HARD TO KILL.    Groot Willem again ascended the tree, this time armed with his roer, and  followed by his two companions.  The elephant was still at the pool;  and, to make him leave it and draw nearer, Willem showed himself on the  bank.  This plan did not succeed.  The elephant saw him, but with reason  or instinct that seemed almost human, it was evidently waiting until  they should leave their retreat before again commencing hostilities.    \"It's of no use my firing from here,\" said Willem, \"I must endeavour to  get nearer.  Don't be in my way, for in all probability, there may be  another chase.\"    The distance from the tree to the pool was close upon a hundred yards;  and, after walking from the bank about one third of that distance,  Willem came to a halt.    The elephant, coolly and philosophically, awaited his approach,  apparently satisfied to let him come as near as he pleased.    The position in which the animal stood was unfavourable for Willem to  make his favourite shot; but, as it would not move, he was obliged to  fire at its head.  The report of his gun was answered by a roar and an  impetuous charge.    Willem instantly made for the tree, and secured his retreat, with the  elephant but a few paces in his rear.    At the same time--and without evincing the slightest acknowledgment--the  huge beast received two further shots from Hendrik and Arend.    While the guns were being reloaded, the monster again retired to the  pool.  There it was saluted by seven more balls without even once  attempting to approach its tormentors in their place of retreat.    It now wanted but two hours to sunset, and dark heavy clouds were  descried rolling up from the south-west.  Thirteen shots had been  expended on the elephant, and to all appearance it was still uninjured.  There was a prospect of compulsory confinement before them.  They might  have to remain in their aqua-arboreal retirement the whole night under  the pelting of a pitiless storm.  Three more shots were fired, without  any apparent result.  The rain soon came down,--not in drops, but  dishfuls.    Often as they had been exposed to heavy showers, none of them could  remember witnessing anything like that.  All their care was devoted to  keeping the ammunition and the locks of their guns dry; and any attempts  at breaking the blockade to which they were subjected, was, for a time,  relinquished.    By the last light of day, Groot Willem made another reconnaissance and  found the elephant still patiently waiting and watching.    A night so dark that they could not distinguish each other by sight now  mantled the river, and the heavens above continued pouring forth their  unabated wrath.  They might now have stolen away unknown to the  besieger; but they had no longer the desire to do so.  Confident that  the animal could not keep its feet till morning, after the rough  handling it had received, they resolved upon staying till it fell, and  securing its fine tusks.    Two or three hours passed, and still the rain kept falling, though not  quite so heavily as at first.    \"I don't like this sort of thing,\" said Hendrik.  \"Swart and Cong, in  the pits, could not have been much unhappier than we are.  I should like  to know if the enemy is still on guard.  What do you say to our going  off?\"    \"We mustn't think of it,\" counselled Arend.  \"Even if the elephant be  gone, we cannot find our horses in such a dark night.  If it be still  waiting for us, we could not see it five paces off, while it might see  us.  We had better stay when we are till morning.\"    \"Your advice is good, Arend,\" said Willem.  I don't believe that we have  a gun among us that could be discharged; if attacked, as we are now, we  should be defenceless.    Arend's suggestion was adopted, and they resolved to remain upon the  rock till morning.    During the"]]]
