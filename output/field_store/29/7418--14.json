The King arrived on the appointed day, and was received by the  lady with great and ceremonious cheer. Fair and noble and gracious seemed  she in the eyes of the King beyond all that he had conceived from the  knight's words, so that he was lost in admiration and inly extolled her to  the skies, his passion being the more inflamed in proportion as he found the  lady surpass the idea which he had formed of her. A suite of rooms furnished  with all the appointments befitting the reception of so great a king, was  placed at his disposal, and after a little rest, breakfast-time being come,  he and the Marchioness took their places at the same table, while his suite  were honourably entertained at other boards according to their several  qualities. Many courses were served with no lack of excellent and rare  wines, whereby the King was mightily pleased, as also by the extraordinary  beauty of the Marchioness, on whom his eye from time to time rested.  However, as course followed course, the King observed with some surprise,  that, though the dishes were diverse, yet they were all but variations of  one and the same fare, to wit, the pullet. Besides which he knew that the  domain was one which could not but afford plenty of divers sorts of game,  and by forewarning the lady of his approach, he had allowed time for  hunting; yet, for all his surprise, he would not broach the question more  directly with her than by a reference to her hens; so, turning to her with a  smile, he said:--\"Madam, do hens grow in this country without so much as a  single cock?\" The Marchioness, who perfectly apprehended the drift of the  question, saw in it an opportunity, sent her by God, of evincing her  virtuous resolution; so casting a haughty glance upon the King she answered  thus:--\"Sire, no; but the women, though they may differ somewhat from others  in dress and rank, are yet of the same nature here as elsewhere.\" The  significance of the banquet of pullets was made manifest to the King by  these words, as also the virtue which they veiled. He perceived that on a  lady of such a temper words would be wasted, and that force was out of the  question. Wherefore, yielding to the dictates of prudence and honour, he was  now as prompt to quench, as he had been inconsiderate in conceiving, his  unfortunate passion for the lady; and fearing her answers, he refrained from  further jesting with her, and dismissing his hopes devoted himself to his  breakfast, which done, he disarmed suspicion of the dishonourable purpose of  his visit by an early departure, and thanking her for the honour she had  conferred upon him, and commending her to God, took the road to Genoa.      NOVEL VI.    --  A worthy man by an apt saying puts to shame the wicked hypocrisy of the  religious.  --    When all had commended the virtue of the Marchioness and the spirited  reproof which she administered to the King of France, Emilia, who sate next  to Fiammetta, obeyed the queen's behest, and with a good courage thus  began:--    My story is also of a reproof, but of one administered by a worthy man, who  lived the secular life, to a greedy religious, by a jibe as merry as  admirable. Know then, dear ladies, that there was in our city, not long ago,  a friar minor, an inquisitor in matters of heresy, who, albeit he strove  might and main to pass himself off as a holy man and tenderly solicitous for  the integrity of the Christian Faith, as they all do, yet he had as keen a  scent for a full purse as for a deficiency of faith. Now it so chanced that  his zeal was rewarded by the discovery of a good man far better furnished  with money than with sense, who in an unguarded moment, not from defect of  faith, but rather, perhaps from excess of hilarity, being heated with wine,  had happened to say to his boon companions, that he had a wine good enough  for Christ Himself to drink. Which being reported to the inquisitor, he,  knowing the man to be possessed of large estates and a well-lined purse, set  to work in hot haste, \"cum gladiis et fustibus,\" to bring all the rigour of  the law to bear upon him, designing thereby not to lighten the load of his  victim's misbelief, but to increase the weight of his own purse by the  florins, which he might, as he did, receive from him. So he cited him to his  presence, and asked him whether what was alleged against him were true. The  good man answered in the affirmative, and told him how it had happened.  \"Then,\" said our most holy and devout inquisitor of St. John Goldenbeard,  (1) \"then hast thou made Christ a wine-bibber, and a lover of rare vintages,  as if he were a sot, a toper and a tavern-haunter even as one of you. And  thinkest thou now by a few words of apology to pass this off as a light  matter? It is no such thing as thou supposest. Thou hast deserved the fire;  and we should but do our duty, did we inflict it upon thee.\" With these and  the like words in plenty he upbraided him, bending on him meanwhile a  countenance as stern as if Epicurus had stood before him denying the  immortality of the soul. In short he so terrified him that the good man was  fain to employ certain intermediaries to anoint his palms with a liberal  allowance of St. John Goldenmouth's grease, an excellent remedy for the  disease of avarice which spreads like a pestilence among the clergy, and  notably among the friars minors, who dare not touch a coin, that he might  deal gently with him. And great being the virtue of this ointment, albeit no  mention is made thereof by Galen in any part of his Medicines, it had so  gracious an effect that the threatened fire gave place to a cross, which he  was to wear as if he were bound for the emprise over seas; and to make the  ensign more handsome the inquisitor ordered that it should be yellow upon a  black ground. Besides which, after pocketing the coin, he kept him dangling  about him for some days, bidding him by way of penance hear mass every  morning at Santa Croce, and afterwards wait upon him at the breakfast-hour,  after which he was free to do as he pleased for the rest of the day. All  which he most carefully observed; and so it fell out that one of these  mornings there were chanted at the mass at which he assisted the following  words of the Gospel:--You shall receive an hundredfold and shall possess  eternal life. With these words deeply graven in his memory, he presented  himself, as he was bidden, before the inquisitor, where he sate taking his  breakfast, and being asked whether he had heard mass that morning, he  promptly answered:--\"Yes, sir.\" And being further asked:--\"Heardest thou  aught therein, as to which thou art in doubt, or hast thou any question to  propound?\" the good man responded:--\"Nay indeed, doubt have I none of aught  that I heard; but rather assured faith in the verity of all. One thing,  however, I heard, which caused me to commiserate you and the rest of you  friars very heartily, in regard of the evil plight in which you must find  yourselves in the other world.\" \"And what,\" said the inquisitor, \"was the  passage that so moved thee to commiserate us?\" \"Sir,\" rejoined the good man,  \"it was that passage in the Gospel which says:--\"You shall receive an  hundredfold.\" \"You heard aright,\" said the inquisitor; \"but why did the  passage so affect you?\" \"Sir,\" replied the good man, \"I will tell you. Since  I have been in attendance here, I have seen a crowd of poor folk receive a  daily dole, now of one, now of two, huge tureens of swill, being the refuse  from your table, and that of the brothers of this convent; whereof if you  are to receive an hundredfold in the other world, you will have so much that  it will go hard but you are all drowned therein.\" This raised a general  laugh among those who sat at the inquisitor's table, whereat the inquisitor,  feeling that their gluttony and hypocrisy had received a home-thrust, was  very wroth, and, but that what he had already done had not escaped censure,  would have instituted fresh proceedings against him in revenge for the  pleasantry with which he had rebuked the baseness of himself and his brother  friars; so in impotent wrath he bade him go about his business and shew  himself there no more.    (1) The fiorino d'oro bore the effigy of St. John.      NOVEL VII.    --  Bergamino, with a story of Primasso and the Abbot of Cluny, finely censures  a sudden access of avarice in Messer Cane della Scala.  --    Emilia's charming manner and her story drew laughter and commendation from  the queen and all the company, who were much tickled by her new type of  crusader. When the laughter had subsided, and all were again silent,  Filostrato, on whom the narration now fell, began on this wise:--    A fine thing it is, noble ladies, to hit a fixed mark; but if, on the sudden  appearance of some strange object, it be forthwith hit by the bowman, 'tis  little short of a miracle. The corrupt and filthy life of the clergy offers  on many sides a fixed mark of iniquity at which, whoever is so minded, may  let fly, with little doubt that they will reach it, the winged words of  reproof and reprehension. Wherefore, though the worthy man did well to  censure in the person of the inquisitor the pretended charity of the friars  who give to the poor what they ought rather to give to the pigs or throw  away, higher indeed is the praise which I accord to him, of whom, taking my  cue from the last story, I mean to speak; seeing that by a clever apologue  he rebuked a sudden and unwonted access of avarice in Messer Cane della  Scala, conveying in a figure what he had at heart to say touching Messer  Cane and himself; which apologue is to follow.    Far and wide, almost to the ends of the earth, is borne the most illustrious  renown of Messer Cane della Scala, in many ways the favoured child of  fortune, a lord almost without a peer among the notables and magnificoes of  Italy since the time of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],[0,"The Domestic Cat (#14)"],[1," not permitted  to accompany them; but, whatever time they returned, by night or by day,  wet weather or dry, poor Tom always met them nearly a mile from their  own house.    Tom was remarkably fond of the schoolchildren, and every day, as  regularly as the clock struck twelve, at which hour the school was  released for the forenoon, Tom presented himself all ready for a romp.  The family dinner-hour was one o'clock, and Tom never failed to attend.  There was a knocker on the door, and whenever pussy found the door  closed, he used to _jump up and knock_, just as he had seen strangers  do.    Tom knew the days of the week, for he was never known to set out for  school on Saturdays or Sundays, for the simple reason that he knew the  school was closed.    Another strange trait in Tom's character was his fondness for poultry.  \"He would feed with _very young_ chickens, and with the ducks and hens,  never attempting to molest the weakest of them, but would even yield to  them, and frequently leave the choicest bits for them.\"  Tom's life was  a very happy one until his owners removed to Leamington.  Here, in the  same house with him, were a parcel of rude, badly-bred children, who  persistently ill-treated the poor cat, till at last Tom was missing; and  it was found he had taken up his abode in a fowl-house among his old  friends.  This was rather a down-come for the poor cat, and he must have  felt as wretched as a human being whom, after living for years in  luxury, misfortune had at last condemned to the poor-house.  Being  removed back to his owner's house, and the children still continuing  their persecutions, Tom fled to the woods and became a bandit, and no  doubt met with a bandit cat's death, and died in a trap.  So we leave  him.    Tom Brandy was an Australian miner's cat.  The miners baptised him in  _aguardiente_, and hence his name.  He was a beautiful large black cat,  with one white spot on his chest, invaluable as a hunter, and came down  like a whirlwind on every dog he saw.  He was a good example of the  travelling cat; he would follow his master every Sunday in Melbourne to  church, hide in a neighbouring garden till the preaching was over, and  then trot home behind him.  He would lead like a dog in a string.  Tom's  travelling carriage was an old gin case.  Into this Tom would jump  whenever he saw preparations made for striking the tent, and lie there  without ever appearing, at times for a whole day, until the new  camping-ground was reached.  Yes, a wild life Tom led of it in the  Australian bush.  When Tom's master left for \"merrie England,\" Tom  proved himself just as good a ship cat as he had been a miner's puss.  Only, mind you, Tom liked his comforts when he could get them.  It was  no business of his if his master and family chose to be intermediate  passengers.  He knew better, and attached himself to the cabin,  although, to show he did not forget his owners, he used to pay them a  visit every evening, to see, I suppose, if they had everything they  wanted.  On the arrival of the ship at Birkenhead, the purser, after  offering two pounds for Tom in vain, stole Tom Brandy; but Tom was at  his master's house that night, nevertheless.    Tom's future home was Montrose, where he lived for two years happy  enough, after which he mysteriously disappeared, and was not seen again  for nineteen months.  Where had he been?  What had he been doing?  How  had he lived?  _N'importe_!  Tom Brandy turned up again very thin and  very angry, and wanted to fight everybody save his own master.  Tom  lived happy ever after--that is, for three years, when he laid down upon  a shelf and died like a Christian.  And the days and years of Tom  Brandy's life were sixteen and over, and he weighed a little under  seventeen pounds.    Timby is also a Tom cat, and lives at Dunbeath Castle, Caithness; a  pretty black-and-white animal, weighing about ten pounds.  Timby is the  coachman's cat; and as his master lives in a retired part of the  country, the two are naturally very much attached to each other.  Timby  follows his master round the grounds and policies just like a dog.  When  little more than a kitten he proved himself a perfect Nimrod among cats,  brought down birds from the highest trees, tore up moles from their  tunnels, and was death upon rats and mice wherever he saw them.    Since he has grown up to years of discretion, Timby has learned to  despise such paltry game as mice or rats.  The Highlands of Scotland, as  the reader doubtless knows, are infested with rabbits, and many a poor  farmer is ruined by them; and these Timby makes his special quarry.  It  is his habit to stay out all night, and he seldom appears without a  coney in the morning.  If his master will accept the rabbit, Timby is  very much pleased.  If his master won't, and pushes it away with his  foot, \"Oh, very well,\" says Timby, \"I'll have the rabbit; you have that  herring of yours--I question if it will keep another day;\" and he trots  off with his prey.    Three years ago his master got a nice retriever dog, and to this dog  Timby was at first exceedingly cruel, but latterly he grew very much  attached to it; and as often as he can spare a rabbit he brings it to  the dog's kennel, and seems pleased to see him devour it.    Like my own cat or cats, Timby will defend his master with his heart's  blood.  One day when Mr McKenzie, Timby's master, was trying a new  terrier with a rabbit, Timby, who had followed unperceived, as soon as  he heard the rabbit scream, doubtless came to the conclusion that his  master was in danger, and sprang fiercely on another dog which Mr  McKenzie was holding.  The battle was short and bloody, and the poor dog  had to retire very much worsted.  Another day, when the coachman and his  cat were lying together on the grass, a friend came up, and was just in  the act of throwing himself on the turf likewise, when Timby flew upon  him and lacerated his face very severely, and it was with some  difficulty his master got him off.    Timby goes regularly to the sea with his master to swim the dogs, but  does not himself take the water.  But in coming home a rabbit is often  started.  Then away go the dogs, and away goes Timby, and, strange as it  may seem in rabbit-coursing, Timby would gain as many, if not more,  points than the terriers.  However, there is no sort of spirit of  rivalry betwixt them, and if the dogs choose to beat a field for  rabbits, Timby stands by to catch them; again, when the dogs prefer to  \"lay by,\" Timby with pleasure goes and beats the field for them.    If Timby knows there is any vermin in a burrow, he has patience enough  to wait till he secures it! and he has been known to lie near a hole  _for nine hours_ in a stormy day, before his patience was rewarded.    CHAPTER SIXTEEN.    SOME TRAITS OF FELINE CHARACTER.    We all know that almost any dog that has lived a reasonable number of  years, and isn't a kennel dog, but one of the family, as it were,  understands pretty nearly all that is said in his presence, if it at all  concerns him.  My Theodore Nero is exceedingly 'cute in this respect.  When I have to go out without taking him along with me, he will lie  listening attentively, with just half an eye open, till he finds out in  what particular direction I mean to go.  After I leave home he tries  every trick and wile to get round the servant, and generally succeeds;  so that, on turning a corner of the road, ten to one I find the  identical dog I left asleep in the parlour, coolly waiting for me.  Indeed, I have often to leave my orders about him in bad French, as my  wife doesn't understand good Gaelic.  I get to windward of the dog that  way, and, I fear, sometimes to windward of the wife too; the haziness of  my French leaving the one just as wise as the other.    Till very recently, some people wouldn't even admit that a cat could  know its own name; some people get wiser every day, and I, for one,  believe that cats know fully as much of what we say as dogs do.  As an  instance of this, I give you the following anecdote, which may be  entitled:    _A Cat with a Conscience_.--A certain Mr Coutts, of Newhills, Aberdeen,  is very fond of both cats and poultry, and studies the tricks and  manners of both.  He recently had a hen with a large brood of chickens,  the number of which day after day became lessened by one at least.  The  place was always searched, but not the slightest trace of a dead one  could be discovered.  The poor cock was blamed, ravens were suspected,  and hawks deemed guilty; but still there was some mystery about it, and  the chicks went on getting fewer and fewer.  About this time it was  observed that whenever the subject was brought up, the favourite cat  seemed all at once to grow exceedingly uneasy and restless, and finally  bolted off through the nearest open door.  This naturally aroused  suspicion.  Pussy was watched, and found one day in the very act of  walking away with a chicken.    I have another anecdote, something similar, of a cat called Polly.  Polly had one failing, although otherwise a virtuous cat, and extremely  honest--she could not resist the temptation of stealing a bit of cheese,  whenever she could do so unperceived.  But note the slyness of this  pussy: she could never be prevailed upon to touch cheese, even if  offered to her in the presence of any one of the family, evidently  reasoning thus with herself: \"If I pretend I can't eat cheese because it  disagrees with me, they will never blame me for stealing it, and I shall  often find myself locked in the same room--glorious thought!--with a  whole Cheddar.\"    It is a well-known fact that dogs often take particular dislikes to  certain people.  They appear, in many cases, to be much better judges of  character than we ourselves are.  I believe this instinct, or whatever  else it is, is not confined to dogs alone, but is equally shared by  other animals.  Cats, I know,"]]]
