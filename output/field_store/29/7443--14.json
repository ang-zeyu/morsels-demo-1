As to the intimate connection between crime and ignorance, most striking  confirmation is obtained from investigations made in England and Wales in  1842-44, in the case of 69,616 criminals, of whom 21,799 or 31.3 per cent.  could neither read nor write, 41,620 or 59.8 per cent. could read and  write imperfectly, 5909 or 8.5 per cent. could read and write well, and  only 308 or 0.4 per cent. had received a good education.    The present population of New South Wales, despite all their burdens and  difficulties, furnish an instructive and cheering example of what may be  made of even hordes of fallen man under certain conditions, if they can be  afforded the opportunity of working and showing their powers.    Confined in gloomy cells between high walls, chained hand and foot with  heavy iron fetters, condemned in their wretched state to life-long  inaction, the convicts sent out to Botany Bay during fifty years would  have cost the State directly, and society indirectly, an enormous sum;  while their existence would have passed in silent brooding over their  fate, and speculations as to the means of avenging themselves on mankind.    Placed on a remote, healthy, fertile shore, with the cheering prospect of  inaugurating for themselves a new era of existence by labour and industry,  and thus being enabled to attain competency and respectability, these very  same men raise themselves, at but little cost, to the position of valuable  subjects to the state and to society, by causing to smile, under the gold  crop of agriculture, lands hitherto all but unknown, and thus becoming the  founders of a community, which bears within itself the germ of such a  marvellous development in the future, that political seers even now  designate it as \"THE GREAT BRITAIN OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE.\"    A system which, despite the many serious deficiencies caused by individual  selfish short-sightedness, has produced such results, cannot be considered  by any unprejudiced inquirer as altogether objectionable or aimless;--on  the contrary, it seems to us it has proved its utility in founding new  oversea colonies in portions of the earth as yet little visited, the  first colonization of which is attended with local difficulties. We have  but to avail ourselves of the experience acquired at Botany Bay, avoiding  the canker under which the system has hitherto been worked in the British  colonies (with the exception perhaps of that pattern convict settlement at  Singapore, which we have already described), and draw up such regulations,  keeping in view the sole object of transportation, viz. PUNISHMENT BY  EXILE, AND REFORMATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL THROUGH LABOUR, as shall  facilitate its being carried out in an efficient manner, and suffer  ourselves neither to be diverted from our course by the selfish warnings  of interested administrators, nor by the objections of ill-advised  philanthropists.    With respect to the carrying out of a system of transportation, such as  formerly existed in the British colonies, especially Australia and Van  Diemen's Land, the following modifications seem to be advisable:--    1. The abandonment of the convict to the employer, i. e. the \"assignment  system,\" must be entirely given up, as the prisoner by such an arrangement  degenerates into an article for speculation, out of which it must be the  task-master's interest to get as much as he can, so as to be able to  return him upon the hands of the State so soon as his capacity for labour  begins to fail. The convicts who were thus \"assigned\" in New South Wales,  stood to their employers in the same position as negro slaves in the  Southern States of North America, or the island of Cuba. They were fed  like beasts of burden, without the slightest remuneration for the heaviest  work. The State had, it is true, a right to punish the criminal, but it  seems to us unjust in the extreme to make him the slave of his fellow-man.  Accordingly this practice was the source of unutterable mischief, and was  followed by most deplorable results as regards the moral development of  the colony.    2. The case is very different when the labour of the criminal, instead of  being devoted to the aggrandizement of a private individual, finds its  expansion in forwarding parochial or national public works, in clearing  and cultivating tracts of land, and preparing them for the future labour  of free colonists, in the laying out of roads, in the erection of  churches, schools, hospitals, and barracks, in the construction of docks,  quays, &c. &c. So soon as private interest disappears,--so soon as the  energies of the criminal are no longer made available to put money in the  pockets of private speculators, but are utilized for the general good, by  far the greater number of those minor drawbacks will disappear, which  press with all the more force on the compulsory labourer, in proportion as  he feels conscious that he is regarded by him who has purchased his labour  not as a FELLOW-MAN, but as a CHATTEL, to be employed while he is of any  value, and then to be cast aside, as one might throw a dried twig into the  fire. What may be accomplished in this direction, even in colonies of  comparatively recent foundation, is evidenced by the splendid roads of  Cape Colony, traversing mountain passes 6000 to 8000 feet high, the  numerous public buildings in Singapore, Hong-kong, Sydney, &c. Edifices,  which in consequence of the high price of free labour, might not have been  erected under the lapse of many years, actually at present rear their  imposing forms like so many ornamental memorials, now of the worship of  the loving Saviour, now of our charitable duties to the sick and  afflicted, but all serving to instruct and civilize the rising generation!    3. As to the subsistence of the criminals, we do not believe that the  principle of giving them the same descriptions of rations, no matter  whether they worked much or little, would be found conducive to the  attainment of the great object of making them feel an interest in their  labour. We would rather see the present system departed from in this  particular, and a marked difference made in the food provided for the  industrious, as compared with their more indolent companions.    4. Of great importance in penal colonies, as tending to produce a lasting  and decided improvement of the individual, is the FAMILY TIE. What is  independence or even affluence to the exile, if he has no one to care for,  or think of, but himself? His slow and laborious earnings would greatly  tend to plunge him once more into excesses, till he quickly sank back into  his former state of war with civilization.    5. It seems to us imperatively necessary in the interests of this great  design of a penal colony, that provision should be made for a certain  proportion of female population, which might consist partly of female  criminals, and partly of the wives of such of the male criminals as  should, after a sufficient probation, be permitted to have their wives and  children conveyed at the cost of Government to their place of exile.  Lastly, the nucleus of a female population thus already formed might be  added to from time to time, by sending out such discharged female  criminals as had no visible means of making an honest livelihood in the  mother country. It were a noble object for Christian activity and  religious harmony to provide the means for sending these wretched outcasts  to the new home that was thus being formed.    6. The importation of spirituous liquors, that fruitful cause of so much  crime, must be confined within the narrowest limits. One cannot believe  that even in unhealthy places, where the water frequently is very impure  and unhealthy, owing to vegetable matters held in solution, the use of  strong spirituous liquors must needs be unavoidable. Tea and coffee will  in such places, as I experienced myself during several years' residence in  unhealthy climates, be found excellent substitutes.    7. No official of the colony, civil or military, should be permitted to  trade in any article except the natural products of the soil. On the other  hand, it would be advisable that each _employe_ should have assigned him  by Government, a tract of land for cultivation corresponding to his rank.    There can be little doubt, and it may well be advanced as an argument on  the other side, when the rapid progress made by the Australian colonies  under the influence of this transportation system is adduced as an example  in point, that nowhere probably on the earth would external circumstances,  position of the country, and development of the colony to such a pitch of  prosperity, combine so wonderfully to produce such a result, as was the  case with New South Wales. But even the clumsy method of carrying out this  form of punishment, and the immense use made of it for selfish ends by men  who had every opportunity for studying close at hand the influence it  might have been made to exercise upon the development of the Australian  colonies, could not weaken the conviction that, under more judicious  management, it would have answered every anticipation that could  reasonably be formed of any mode of punishment, and that it is better  calculated than any other to prove conducive to the amelioration of the  criminal himself. We might, while upon this subject, specially refer to  the valuable and comprehensive work of Dr. Holtzendorf upon transportation  as a means of punishment,[26] which embraces all that can be said on  either side of the question, all put together in an attractive and  exhaustive manner, and who, contemplating the great example presented to  the world by Australia, has arrived at a similar conclusion, \"that the  working power of the criminal may, under proper management, be made to  produce results, able to accelerate the progress of a generation, while  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38480"],[0,"Scientific American, Vol. XXXIX.—No. 24.

The general make up of the volume  before us leaves little to be desired; the arrangement of the types  is extremely tasty, the imprint is clean, sharp, and clear, the  paper good, the margins of the pages broad, and the illustrations  exceedingly well executed.

For as yet, we know but  comparatively little about the geology of Mexico, and a great deal is  yet to be learned, too, about her natural productions.           *       *       *       *       *          CORRESPONDENCE.           *       *       *       *       *          ALUM IN BREAD.--A REPLY TO DR. MOTT'S ARTICLE IN SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN  OF NOVEMBER 16, ENTITLED \"DELETERIOUS USE OF ALUM IN BAKING POWDER.\"    By W. P. CLOTWORTHY, BALTIMORE, MD.      On August 13, 1878, I obtained letters patent for the exclusive right  to use exsiccated ammonia alum in baking powders. This fact I state  that the public may know the reason that elicits this reply to  the remarkable article on adulterations in baking powders, in the  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN of Nov. 16th, emanating from the pen of Henry A.  Mott, Jr. I wish the Professor had been equally candid in stating his  reasons for contributing the article. It is rare for a chemist to turn  philanthropist without some consideration. The analysis of forty-two  baking powders requires no little labor; twenty-one were examined  at the expense of the government for the benefit of the Indian  Department, the others, no doubt, at the expense and for the benefit  of the Royal Baking Powder Company. I hope his services have been  liberally requited. The public certainly owe him nothing for his labor  or opinions. An excuse can be made for the prejudice existing against  the use of alum in any form for baking purposes; it is an inheritance  from a preceding age; but no apology can be offered for a practical  chemist in this day, who labors to keep alive and foster a prejudice  by the suppression of truths and facts. Professor Mott, in attempting  to prove a fraud in food, has perpetrated a fraud in facts. That this  opinion may not be unwarranted, I will state the facts about alum,  which may be new to the public, but familiar to every chemist. Alum  was formerly a compound of sulph. alumina and sulph. potash. In the  past ten years nearly all manufacturers of alum have substituted  sulph. ammonia for the sulph. potash; this change removes from alum  a dangerous and objectionable ingredient, and adds a healthful  one. Professor Mott recommends the use of ammonia in the form of a  carbonate--carbonate of ammonia is one of the results in baking powder  of the decomposition which takes place between alum and bicarbonate of  soda; in the complete decomposition which takes place pure alumina is  eliminated, highly recommended as an antacid. During the process  of baking, alum is completely decomposed through the liberation of  carbonic acid. Professor Mott must have known this, yet with this  knowledge warns the public on the deleterious effect of alum in bread.    About the first of last October I determined to vindicate the use  of exsiccated ammonia alum as a substitute for cream of tartar, and  accordingly issued a circular to the trade; from this circular I now  give the following extract, which enters minutely into the subject:    \"To claim that an experience of 35 years in compounding medicines  should entitle my opinion on chemicals and chemical compounds to a  respectful consideration, is neither presumptuous nor unreasonable.  With this simple introduction I now avow myself the originator  and patentee of exsiccated ammonia alum baking powder. The use of  exsiccated ammonia alum has been declared unhealthful by the advocates  of other baking powders, and every manufacturer using it has been held  up for public reprobation. This has been done by rival manufacturers,  either through ignorance or malice; if from the former they are to be  pitied, if from the latter they are contemptible. These opinions have  been promulgated by kitchen chemists, whose circle of knowledge begins  and ends with cream tartar and soda; and even of these articles they  only know that cream tartar is in some way derived from grapes. In  this circular I propose to state a few facts in relation to cream  tartar and exsiccated alum, and the combinations they form with  bicarbonate of soda, and allow you to form your own opinion of their  respective merits. Crude tartar is the incrustation found in wine  casks. It contains coloring matter and about 15 per cent of lime.  This article is purified and called the cream of tartar, but it is  impossible to extract all the lime. Commercially pure cream tartar  contains at least 5 per cent of lime. When cream tartar is used in  proportion of two parts to one of bicarbonate of soda, you will have  an average of 3 to 4 per cent of lime. In using cream tartar and soda  in baking, a chemical change commences as soon as water is added; the  cream tartar unites with the soda, setting free the carbonic acid gas,  which lightens the bread, and the residue is Rochelle salts. This  is what you eat in your bread, the cream tartar and soda entirely  disappearing in the process of baking, by forming this salt. Any  doctor or chemist will confirm the above statement. When I undertook  to manufacture baking powder, I labored to improve the quality and  cheapen the cost. The first I accomplished by retaining the carbonic  acid until heat was applied, the latter, by manufacturing a more  economical acid than foreign cream tartar. After more than a  thousand experiments covering a period of six months, I discovered by  exsiccating ammonia alum I provided an article that would possess the  necessary qualities. This article no more resembles the ordinary  alum than charcoal resembles wood--it is light, porous, friable, and  without taste. This article, under the influence of heat, combines  with the soda and forms Glauber salts. In baking, the alum unites  with the soda, just as cream tartar unites. In using the baking powder  prepared according to my formula, you have in your bread Glauber  instead of Rochelle salts. To your physician apply for his opinion  of these salts; I will bow to his decision. Another false impression  these zealous guardians of the public health have made is, that I  used the exsiccated alum because it was cheap. The fact is that when I  commenced its use it cost by the thousand pounds 12 per cent. more  than the best cream tartar is worth to-day, and 33 per cent. more than  average price of that article for the past year. I have since reduced  the cost of manufacturing, and as I did so, correspondingly reduced  the price of powder to the public. I regard the quantity of soda in  cream tartar baking powders as very objectionable; they generally  contain about 33 per cent. In my powder only 20 per cent. The  prejudice in the public mind against alum, originated in the habit of  the English bakers buying damaged flour, and by the addition of crude  alum, made their bread in appearance equal to that made from best  flour. Against this practice laws were enacted, not so much against  the qualities of alum, as against its use in covering up a fraud  in flour. This was the common potash alum and uncombined with any  carbonated alkali, and it passed into the stomach unchanged. It is  a trick--for it deserves no better name--of our rivals to show by  chemical analysis that my powder contains alum, but are careful  neither to state the kind nor the change it undergoes in baking. The  manufacturer who knowingly misrepresents the goods of a rival, may  well be doubted when he speaks of the quality of his own.    \"Great stress is laid on the fact that cream tartar is a vegetable  acid, the product of the grape, hence it must be healthy. They forget  that cream tartar is not entirely vegetable, but principally second  handed minerals. It is a compound of tartaric acid, potash, and lime;  the last two are minerals, which the grape takes up from the earth,  but redeposits them as crude tartar when fermentation converts the  grape into wine. In 1807 Sir Humphry Davy from this crude tartar first  made the metal potassium. Of lime it is unnecessary to speak. The  potash and lime form the bulk of cream tartar. In ammonia alum there  is no more mineral substance than in cream tartar. The chemistry  of nature is wonderful. Vegetation lives on minerals--wheat, corn,  potatoes, are all mineral compounds. Lime, soda, potash, magnesia,  sulphur, iron, etc., are all found abundantly in water and grain, and  all these minerals are essential in food.\"    Professor Mott has given the Royal Baking Powder the benefit of his  indorsement; it may be all that he claims for it. But baking powders  are now judged by constituent ingredients and chemical analysis; to  this test I propose to bring the Royal. It is now in the hands of a  competent chemist, and when the analysis is complete I will give  the public the benefit of a comparison between that powder and the  Patapsco. I will take Professor Mott's analysis "]]]
