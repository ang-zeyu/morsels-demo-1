The compassionate old man and his child wept with  her.  Then said he, \"Come with us, and despise not our humble  roof; so may your daughter be restored to you in safety.\"  \"Lead  on,\" said she, \"I cannot resist that appeal!\"  So she rose from  the stone and went with them.  As they walked he told her that  his only son, a little boy, lay very sick, feverish and  sleepless.  She stooped and gathered some poppies.  As they  entered the cottage they found all in great distress, for the boy  seemed past hope of recovery.  Metanira, his mother, received her  kindly, and the goddess stooped and kissed the lips of the sick  child.  Instantly the paleness left his face, and healthy vigor  returned to his body.  The whole family were delighted   that is,  the father, mother, and little girl, for they were all; they had  no servants. They spread the table, and put upon it curds and  cream, apples, and honey in the comb.  While they ate, Ceres  mingled poppy juice in the milk of the boy.  When night came and  all was still, she arose, and taking the sleeping boy, moulded  his limbs with her hands, and uttered over him three times a  solemn charm, then went and laid him in the ashes.  His mother,  who had been watching what her guest was doing, sprang forward  with a cry and snatched the child from the fire.  Then Ceres  assumed her own form, and a divine splendor shone all around.  While they were overcome with astonishment, she said, \"Mother,  you have been cruel in your fondness to your son.  I would have  made him immortal, but you have frustrated my attempt.  Nevertheless, he shall be great and useful.  He shall teach men  the use of the plough, and the rewards which labor can win from  the cultivated soil.\"  So saying, she wrapped a cloud about her,  and mounting her chariot rode away.    Ceres continued her search for her daughter, passing from land to  land, and across seas and rivers, till at length she returned to  Sicily, whence she at first set out, and stood by the banks of  the River Cyane, where Pluto made himself a passage with his  prize to his own dominions.    The river-nymph would have told the goddess all she had  witnessed, but dared not, for fear of Pluto; so she only ventured  to take up the girdle which Proserpine had dropped in her flight,  and waft it to the feet of the mother.  Ceres, seeing this, was  no longer in doubt of her loss, but she did not yet know the  cause, and laid the blame on the innocent land.  \"Ungrateful  soil,\" said she, \"which I have endowed with fertility and clothed  with herbage and nourishing grain, No more shall you enjoy my  favors\" Then the cattle died, the plough broke in the furrow, the  seed failed to come up; there was too much sun, there was too  much rain; the birds stole the seeds,   thistles and brambles  were the only growth.  Seeing this, the fountain Arethusa  interceded for the land.  \"Goddess,\" said she, \"blame not the  land; it opened unwillingly to yield a passage to your daughter.  I can tell you of her fate, for I have seen her.  This is not my  native country; I came hither from Elis.  I was a woodland nymph,  and delighted in the chase.  They praised my beauty, but I cared  nothing for it, and rather boasted of my hunting exploits.  One  day I was returning from the wood, heated with exercise, when I  came to a stream silently flowing, so clear that you might count  the pebbles on the bottom.  The willows shaded it, and the grassy  bank sloped down to the water's edge.  I approached, I touched  the water with my foot.  I stepped in knee-deep, and not content  with that, I laid my garments on the willows and went in.  While  I sported in the water, I heard an indistinct murmur coming up as  out of the depths of the stream; and made haste to escape to the  nearest bank.  The voice said, 'Why do you fly, Arethusa?  I am  Alpheus, the god of this stream.'  I ran, he pursued; he was not  more swift than I, but he was stronger, and gained upon me, as my  strength failed.  At last, exhausted, I cried for help to Diana.  'Help me, goddess!  Help your votary!'  The goddess heard, and  wrapped me suddenly in a thick cloud.  The river-god looked now  this way and now that, and twice came close to me, but could not  find me.  'Arethusa!  Arethusa!' he cried.  Oh, how I trembled,  like a lamb that hears the wolf growling outside the fold.  A  cold sweat came over me, my hair flowed down in streams; where my  foot stood there was a pool.  In short, in less time than it  takes to tell it I became a fountain.  But in this form Alpheus  knew me, and attempted to mingle his stream with mine.  Diana  cleft the ground, and I, endeavoring to escape him, plunged into  the cavern, and through the bowels of the earth came out here in  Sicily.  While I passed through the lower parts of the earth, I  saw your Proserpine.  She was sad, but no longer showing alarm in  her countenance.  Her look was such as became a queen,   the  queen of Erebus; the powerful bride of the monarch of the realms  of the dead.\"    When Ceres heard this, she stood for a while like one stupefied;  then turned her chariot towards heaven, and hastened to present  herself before the throne of Jove.  She told the story of her  bereavement, and implored Jupiter to interfere to procure the  restitution of her daughter.  Jupiter consented on one condition,  namely, that Proserpine should not during her stay in the lower  world have taken any food; otherwise, the Fates forbade her  release.  Accordingly, Mercury was sent, accompanied by Spring,  to demand Proserpine of Pluto.  The wily monarch consented; but  alas! the maiden had taken a pomegranate which Pluto offered her,  and had sucked the sweet pulp from a few of the seeds.  This was  enough to prevent her complete release; but a compromise was  made, by which she was to pass half the time with her mother, and  the rest with her husband Pluto.    Ceres allowed herself to be pacified with this arrangement, and  restored the earth to her favor.  Now she remembered Celeus and  his family, and her promise to his infant son Triptolemus.  When  the boy grew up, she taught him the use of the plough, and how to  sow the seed.  She took him in her chariot, drawn by winged  dragons, through all the countries of the earth, imparting to  mankind valuable grains, and the knowledge of agriculture.  After  his return, Triptolemus build a magnificent temple to Ceres in  Eleusis, and established the worship of the goddess, under the  name of the Eleusinian mysteries, which, in the splendor and  solemnity of their observance, surpassed all other religious  celebrations among the Greeks.    There can be little doubt but that this story of Ceres and  Proserpine is an allegory.  Proserpine signifies the seed-corn,  which, when cast into the ground, lies there concealed,   that  is, she is carried off by the god of the underworld; it  reappears,   that is, Proserpine is restored to her mother.  Spring leads her back to the light of day.    Milton alludes to the story of Proserpine in Paradise lost, Book  IV.:      \"Not that fair field    Of Enna where Proserpine gathering flowers,    Herself a fairer flower, by gloomy Dis (a name for Pluto)    Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain    To seek her through the world,    . . . . might with this Paradise    Of Eden strive.\"    Hood, in his Ode to Melancholy, uses the same allusion very  beautifully:      \"Forgive, if somewhile I forget,    In woe to come the present bliss;    As frightened Proserpine let fall    Her flowers at the sight of Dis.\"    The River Alpheus does in fact disappear under ground, in part of  its course, finding its way through subterranean channels, till  it again appears on the surface.  It was said that the Sicilian  fountain Arethusa was the same stream, which, after passing under  the sea, came up again in Sicily.  Hence the story ran that a cup  thrown into the Alpheus appeared again in Arethusa.  It is this  fable of the underground course of Alpheus that Coleridge alludes  to in his poem of Kubla Khan:      \"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan    A stately pleasure-dome decree,    Where Alph, the sacred river, ran    Through caverns measureless to man,    Down to a sunless sea.\"    In one of Moore's juvenile poems he alludes to the same story,  and to the practice of throwing garlands, or other light objects  on the stream to be carried downward by it, and afterwards thrown  out when the river comes again to light.      \"Oh, my beloved, how divinely sweet    Is the pure joy when kindred spirits meet!    Like him the river-god, whose waters flow,    With love their only light, through caves below,    Wafting in triumph all the flowery braids    And festal rings, with which Olympic maids    Have decked his current, as an offering meet    To lay at Arethusa's shining feet.    Think, when he meets at last his fountain bride,    What perfect love must thrill the blended tide!    Each lost in each, till mingling into one,    Their lot the same for shadow or for sun,    A type of true love, to the deep they run.\"    The following extract from Moore's Rhymes on the Road gives an  account of a celebrated picture by Albano at Milan, called a  Dance of Loves:      \"'Tis for the theft of Enna's flower from earth    These urchins celebrate their dance of mirth,    Round the green tree, like fays upon a heath,    Those that are nearest linked in order bright,    Cheek after cheek, like rosebuds in a wreath;    And those more distant showing from beneath    The others' wings their little eyes of light.    While see! Among the clouds, their eldest brother,    But just flown up, tells with a smile of bliss,    This prank of Pluto to his charmed mother,    Who turns to greet the tidings with a kiss.\"        GLAUCUS AND SCYLLA    Glaucus was a fisherman.  One day he had drawn his nets to land,  and had taken a great many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33407"],[0,"Bee and Butterfly: A Tale of Two Cousins (#14)"],[1,"his mother. \"I would like to hear  the little boy play.\"    \"By all means,\" said the lady graciously. \"Percival does better when he  has an audience. Are you Doctor Raymond's daughter?\"    \"Yes;\" answered Beatrice, availing herself of the permission to enter  the garden. \"I am Beatrice Raymond.\"    \"Percival said that he had met you,\" continued the lady. \"He has been  watching you for some weeks, and wishing that he could make your  acquaintance.\"    \"Why don't you tell her our names?\" broke in the boy excitedly. \"That's  what she has come for. I told her yesterday that she would have to come  over to find out, and she can't know us unless we tell her what to call  us. I am Percival Medulla, and this is Mrs. Medulla. 'Course that isn't  our real name, but when you're before the public you have to be called  something high sounding.\"    \"Percival!\" cried his mother, provoked.    \"Isn't it true?\" demanded Percival in matter of fact tones.    \"The truth when it refers to private matters is not always to be  spoken,\" reproved Mrs. Medulla. \"Miss Beatrice, (she pronounced Bee's  name after the Italian manner), he is to play one hour longer. I know  that I can depend upon you to keep him at his task. You show that you  are trustworthy. Percival, be very nice to your friend,\" and she swept  into the house.    So, much to the girl's wonder, she was left as mentor to the boy  musician. He looked at her quizzically as he saw her dismay, and began  to laugh.    \"I am glad that she is gone,\" he remarked. \"I want to have you all to  myself.\"    \"Hush, hush!\" implored Beatrice, shocked. \"You must not speak of your  mother that way.\"    \"Mustn't one? Not even when she bores one?\"    \"No; no, indeed!\" replied the girl earnestly. \"Now do practice. There's  a good little boy!\"    \"How old are you?\" he asked abruptly.    \"Fifteen. Why?\"    \"Well, don't you call me little boy any more. I am thirteen.\"    \"You don't look it,\" remarked Bee with a critical glance at him. \"I  thought you were not more than ten. Your--\"    \"Yes; my clothes,\" interrupted he, frowning darkly. \"I just hate them!\"    \"What makes you wear them then?\" asked she, surprised.    \"Because I am an Infant Prodigy. Grown people think that I am more of a  genius if I dress like a silly. If I wore clothes like a decent boy they  wouldn't come to hear me play. So I have to wear these things--\" with a  gesture of disgust. \"I've worn them for ages and ages. I suppose that  I'll die wearing them, and being an Infant Prodigy. And these curls! Do  you think a real fellow likes to go around like a girl? Well, I guess  not. Whenever old Heinrich, he's my tutor, says: 'We must have a new  Fauntleroy suit for de boy, madam,' I just wish Fauntleroy had never  been born.\"    \"But he wasn't,\" spoke Bee. \"He's just a character in a book, Percival.\"    \"'Mounts to the same thing,\" answered Percival, \"if I have to dress like  him. But just you wait. When I'm a little older, you'll see. Your hair  looks funny too,\" turning the subject suddenly. \"What makes it so dark  at the roots, and so yellow everywhere else? Did you bleach it?\"    \"Yes;\" said Bee humbly, her face flushing. \"You see I have a cousin who  is very beautiful, and I wished to look like her, so I had my hair  bleached. I am sorry that I did it now, and I am letting it grow out.  Just as soon as it gets long enough to look well, I will have the yellow  part cut off. Now do play, or your mother will be sorry that I came.\"    \"Oh, she knows that I will play an hour longer,\" said the Prodigy  easily, adjusting his violin. \"I told her that I would, and I always do  what I say I will.\"    Beatrice made no reply, and the lad began to play some snatches of march  music which grew wilder and more barbarous, changing at last to a wild  mad waltz of wonderful rhythm. He was indeed a prodigy. His tone was  marvelously pure, his technique fluent and delicate. He touched the  secret feelings of the heart, and brought into play all the emotions.  The girl paled under the influence, and listened in rapturous silence.  Presently the boy stopped, turned toward her expectantly, and drew  himself up in a stiff, martial attitude. Beatrice gazed at him in  wonderment, her breath coming quickly through her parted lips.    \"Well?\" he said impatiently. \"Hurry up, and let's have it over with.\"    \"Hurry up?\" echoed Bee, rousing herself. \"Hurry up what?\"    \"The kissing, of course. Get it over with quick! I want to go on  playing. I'm in the mood.\"    \"Go on playing then,\" cried Bee, a thread of indignation in her tone.  \"I'm not going to kiss you.\"    \"You're not?\" The boy stared at her incredulously. \"Why, you're a girl!  They all do it.\"    \"Nonsense! I don't kiss boys.\"    \"Not even if they are Infant Prodigies?\"    \"No; not even then,\" she returned. \"I never heard of anything so absurd  in my life.\"    \"You haven't, eh? Let me tell you that I have. Wait! you'll be as bad  as the rest of them.\"    He began to play again, watching her with curious half-shut eyes to note  the effect. Nocturnes, obligatos, and finally the wonderful music of  Chopin, followed in quick succession. The girl did not move, but sat  like one entranced. All at once he paused, and bent toward her with an  inviting smile.    \"Now,\" he said in a winsome voice.    Bee did not stir, but gazed at him uncomprehendingly, too much absorbed  to realize what he meant.    \"Now,\" he repeated commandingly.    The girl roused herself.    \"Oh,\" she breathed. \"Are you going to stop? I think the angels must play  like that!\"    With an angry motion the lad thrust his bow into his left hand, and held  out his right toward her.    \"See that hand?\" he demanded. Bee looked at it in perplexity.    \"Yes; why?\"    \"That's the hand that made that music.\"    \"Yes, I know,\" she answered gently. \"It's ever so much smaller than  mine, and whiter too.\" She held out her own slim brown hand and  compared the two.    \"Aren't they little bits of fingers?\" went on the Prodigy. \"Who would  think that such little things could make such divine music? See the  dimples at the knuckles! Aren't they dear?\"    \"Don't,\" cried Bee in disgust. \"I was entranced with the music, and now  you are spoiling it all by saying such foolish things.\"    \"And don't you intend to kiss that hand?\" ejaculated Percival in  astonishment.    \"Of course not,\" answered Bee, rising. \"I must go, Percival. Your  playing is marvelous, and I do hope that you will let me listen to you  again. Come over and see me. And I want you to meet my father. I wish  you would play for him.\"    \"Well, you are a funny girl! If I had played like that before an  audience, the women and girls would have smothered me with kisses.\"    \"I shouldn't think you would like it,\" exclaimed Bee.    \"I wouldn't mind you,\" spoke Percival. \"I wonder if it is because of  the butterflies that you are so different? Never mind! I'll fetch you  yet. See if I don't.\"    \"Good-bye,\" called Bee with a laugh, and darted through the opening in  the hedge.          Chapter XII    The Arrival of Guests        \"The thistles show beyond the brook        Dust on their down and bloom,      And out of many a weed-grown nook      The aster flowers look        With eyes of tender gloom.\"        --_W. D. Howells._      Master Percival returned Bee's visit the very next day.    \"What did you do with that butterfly that you caught?\" he asked as he  seated himself. \"Why did you catch it anyway?\"    \"Father thought it an unusually fine one, and wished it for his  collection,\" replied Bee. \"You cannot see it now because it is not ready  to set up yet, but I can show you some others, if you care to see them.\"    \"I do care,\" he answered. \"I never noticed those things until I saw you  catching them.\"    \"You didn't?\" asked Bee in surprise, as she led the way to the  laboratory. \"How could you help noticing them?\"    \"I don't know. Maybe it's because I have not been in the country very  much. What makes you like them?\"    \"They are so beautiful, Percival, for one thing. Then my father likes  them. They are his specialty.\"    Percival gave a cry of delight as they entered the laboratory, and some  butterflies rose from the thistles upon which they were resting. Like  autumn leaves released from their moorings they floated about, brilliant  bits of color. Soaring, curving, dropping into the depths of the corners  of the room, the butterflies rose and fell, rose and circled higher,  higher, up to the very ceiling; then they came tumbling down among the  thistles, settling and unsettling themselves airily, noiselessly, making  their selection of resting places slowly and daintily.    \"This is the very last one to burst its chrysalis,\" remarked Bee,  indicating a queenly Swallowtail whose flutterings denoted weakness.  \"Soon it will circle about in its first flight. See the lustre of its  wings, Percival. Did you ever see anything more beautiful?\"    \"They are like flowers,\" cried the boy enthusiastically, all the artist  in him revelling in the beauty and daintiness of the insects. \"Flying  flowers! They--Gee! Look at the worms!\"    \"They are not worms; they are caterpillars,\" explained Bee. \"See how  they are feeding upon the leaves? When the time comes that they have  eaten enough they will spin a bed for themselves like this,\" showing him  a cocoon. \"After a short sleep they burst forth into beautiful  butterflies.\"    \"Do they feed on the different colored plants so as to have different  colors?\" he queried.    \"Why, Percival, that is a sweet fancy,\" she cried. \"I never thought of  that. I'll ask father if that is what makes them the pretty colors. You  like them too, don't you?\"    \"I like the butterflies, but I don't like those creepy, crawly things  from which they come.\"    \"That is the most beautiful part of it, father says,\" said Bee. \"They  are humble, earth-bound creatures at first; then after a period of  preparation they become beautiful winged insects, basking in the  sunshine and "]]]
