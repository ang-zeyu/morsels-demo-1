A gentleman who resided some time on one of the West India Islands  informs us that while he was once travelling along the bed of a deep  ravine overhung with thick vines, he was actually startled by the  immense numbers of humming birds which hovered over and about him.  They hovered about him as if actuated by curiosity alone. They were of  various kinds and colors, some of them being nearly as large as  sparrows, while others were but little larger than a bee. Some were of  a dingy green, or a light brown, while others seemed gaudily arrayed  in plumage as brilliant and variegated as the rainbow. They would  approach within arms length of his face, and pausing in their flight,  with their little wings, in rapid motion, would stare at him as if  they wondered what possible business he could have in those remote  wilds; but they exhibited no symptoms of terror, not having been  taught by experience to fear the cruelty of man.           *       *       *       *       *          THE NEW YORK  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:    _Published Weekly at_ 128 _Fulton Street_., (_Sun Building_,) _New York_.    BY MUNN & COMPANY.    The SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN is the Advocate of Industry and Journal of  Mechanical and other Improvements: as such its contents are probably  more varied and interesting, than those of any other weekly newspaper in  the United States, and certainly more useful. It contains as much  interesting Intelligence as six ordinary daily papers, while for _real  benefit_, it is unequalled by any thing yet published. Each number  regularly contains from THREE to SIX ORIGINAL ENGRAVINGS, illustrated  by NEW INVENTIONS, American and Foreign,--SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES and  CURIOSITIES,--Notices of the progress of Mechanical and other  Scientific Improvements, Scientific Essays on the principles of the  Sciences of MECHANICS, CHEMISTRY and ARCHITECTURE,--Catalogues of  American Patents,--INSTRUCTION in various ARTS and TRADES, _with  engravings_,--Curious Philosophical Experiments,--the latest RAIL ROAD  INTELLIGENCE in EUROPE and AMERICA,--Valuable information on the Art  of GARDENING, &c. &c.    This paper is especially entitled to the patronage of MECHANICS and  MANUFACTURERS, being devoted to the interests of those classes. It is  particularly useful to FARMERS, as it will not only apprise them of  IMPROVEMENTS in AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS, but INSTRUCT them in various  MECHANICAL TRADES, and guard against impositions. As a FAMILY  NEWSPAPER, it will convey more USEFUL Intelligence to children and  young people, than five times its cost in school instruction.    Being published in QUARTO FORM, it is conveniently adapted to  PRESERVATION and BINDING.

I have seen them keep absolutely quiet on  fragments of an Anthophora on a thorax long since nibbled and emptied  by the Mites. By what sense then can they distinguish the thorax of an  Anthophora from a velvety pellet, when sight and touch are out of the  question? The sense of smell remains. But in that case what exquisite  subtlety must we not take for granted? Moreover, what similarity of  smell can we admit between all the insects which, dead or alive, whole  or in pieces, fresh or dried, suit the Meloes, while anything else  does not suit them? A wretched louse, a living speck, leaves us  mightily perplexed as to the sensibility which directs it. Here is yet  one more riddle added to all the others.    After the observations which I have described, it remained for me to  search the earthen surface inhabited by the Anthophorae: I should then  have followed the Meloe-larva in its transformations. It was certainly  _cicatricosus_ whose larvae I had been studying; it was certainly this  insect which ravaged the cells of the Mason-bee, for I found it dead  in the old galleries which it had been unable to leave. This  opportunity, which did not occur again, promised me an ample harvest.  I had to give it all up. My Thursday was drawing to a close; I had to  return to Avignon, to resume my lessons on the electrophorus and the  Toricellian tube. O happy Thursdays! What glorious opportunities I  lost because you were too short!    We will go back a year to continue this history. I collected, under  far less favourable conditions, it is true, enough notes to map out  the biography of the tiny creature which we have just seen migrating  from the camomile-flowers to the Anthophora's back. From what I have  said of the Sitaris-larvae, it is plain that the Meloe-larvae perched,  like the former, on the back of a Bee, have but one aim: to get  themselves conveyed by this Bee to the victualled cells. Their object  is not to live for a time on the body that carries them.    Were it necessary to prove this, it would be enough to say that we  never see these larvae attempt to pierce the skin of the Bee, or else  to nibble at a hair or two, nor do we see them increase in size so  long as they are on the Bee's body. To the Meloes, as to the Sitares,  the Anthophora serves merely as a vehicle which conveys them to their  goal, the victualled cell.    It remains for us to learn how the Meloe leaves the down of the Bee  which has carried it, in order to enter the cell. With larvae  collected from the bodies of different Bees, before I was fully  acquainted with the tactics of the Sitares, I undertook, as Newport  had done before me, certain investigations intended to throw light on  this leading point in the Oil-beetle's history. My attempts, based  upon those which I had made with the Sitares, resulted in the same  failure. The tiny creatures, when brought into contact with  Anthophora-larvae or -nymphs, paid no attention whatever to their  prey; others, placed near cells which were open and full of honey, did  not enter them, or at most ventured to the edge of the orifice;  others, lastly, put inside the cell, on the dry wall or on the surface  of the honey, came out again immediately or else got stuck and died.  The touch of the honey is as fatal to them as to the young Sitares.    Searches made at various periods in the nests of the Hairy-footed  Anthophora had taught me some years earlier that _Meloe cicatricosus_,  like the Sitares, is a parasite of that Bee; indeed I had at different  times discovered adult Meloes, dead and shrivelled, in the Bee's  cells. On the other hand, I knew from Leon Dufour that the little  yellow animal, the Louse found in the Bee's down, had been recognized,  thanks to Newport's investigations, as the larva of the Oil-beetle.  With these data, rendered still more striking by what I was learning  daily on the subject of the Sitares, I went to Carpentras, on the 21st  of May, to inspect the nests of the Anthophorae, then building, as I  have described. Though I was almost certain of succeeding, sooner or  later, with the Sitares, who were excessively abundant, I had very  little hope of the Meloes, which on the contrary are very scarce in  the same nests. Circumstances, however, favoured me more than I dared  hope and, after six hours' labour, in which the pick played a great  part, I became the possessor, by the sweat of my brow, of a  considerable number of cells occupied by Sitares and two other cells  appropriated by Meloes.    While my enthusiasm had not had time to cool at the sight, momentarily  repeated, of a young Sitaris perched upon an Anthophora's egg floating  in the centre of the little pool of honey, it might well have burst  all restraints on beholding the contents of one of these cells. On the  black, liquid honey a wrinkled pellicle is floating; and on this  pellicle, motionless, is a yellow louse. The pellicle is the empty  envelope of the Anthophora's egg; the louse is a Meloe-larva.    The story of this larva becomes self-evident. The young Meloe leaves  the down of the Bee at the moment when the egg is laid; and, since  contact with the honey would be fatal to the grub, it must, in order  to save itself, adopt the tactics followed by the Sitaris, that is to  say, it must allow itself to drop on the surface of the honey with the  egg which is in the act of being laid. There, its first task is to  devour the egg which serves it for a raft, as is attested by the empty  envelope on which it still remains; and it is after this meal, the  only one that it takes so long as it retains its present form, that it  must commence its long series of transformations and feed upon the  honey amassed by the Anthophora. This was the reason of the complete  failure both of my attempts and of Newport's to rear the young  Meloe-larvae. Instead of offering them honey, or larvae, or nymphs, we  should have placed them on the eggs recently laid by the Anthophora.    On my return from Carpentras, I meant to try this method, together  with that of the Sitares, with which I had been so successful; but, as  I had no Meloe-larvae at my disposal and could not obtain any save by  searching for them in the Bees' fleece, the Anthophora-eggs were all  discovered to have hatched in the cells which I brought back from my  expedition, when I was at last able to find some. This lost experiment  is little to be regretted, for, since the Meloes and the Sitares  exhibiting the completest similarity not only in habits but also in  their method of evolution, there is no doubt whatever that I should  have succeeded. I even believe that this method may be attempted with  the cells of various Bees, provided that the eggs and the honey do not  differ too greatly from the Anthophora's. I should not, for example,  count on being successful with the cells of the three-horned Osmia,  who shares the Anthophora's quarters: her egg is short and thick; and  her honey is yellow, odourless, solid, almost a powder and very  faintly flavoured.          CHAPTER V  HYPERMETAMORPHOSIS      By a Machiavellian stratagem the primary larva of the Oil-beetle or  the Sitaris has penetrated the Anthophora's cell; it has settled on  the egg, which is its first food and its life-raft in one. What  becomes of it once the egg is exhausted?    Let us, to begin with, go back to the larva of the Sitaris. By the end  of a week the Anthophora's egg has been drained dry by the parasite  and is reduced to the envelope, a shallow skiff which preserves the  tiny creature from the deadly contact of the honey. It is on this  skiff that the first transformation takes place, whereafter the larva,  which is now organized to live in a glutinous environment, drops off  the raft into the pool of honey and leaves its empty skin, split along  the back, clinging to the pellicle of the egg. At this stage we see  floating motionless on the honey a milk-white atom, oval, flat and a  twelfth of an inch long. This is the larva of the Sitaris in its new  form. With the aid of a lens we can distinguish the fluctuations of  the digestive canal, which is gorging itself with honey; and along the  circumference of the flat, elliptical back we perceive a double row of  breathing-pores which, thanks to their position, cannot be choked by  the viscous liquid. Before describing the larva in detail we will wait  for it to attain its full development, which cannot take long, for the  provisions are rapidly diminishing.    The rapidity however is not to be compared with that with which the  gluttonous larvae of the Anthophora consume their food. Thus, on  visiting the dwellings of the Anthophorae for the last time, on the  25th of June, I found that the Bee's larvae had all finished their  rations and attained their full development, whereas those of the  Sitares, still immersed in the honey, were, for the most part, only  half the size which they must finally attain. This is yet another  reason why the Sitares should destroy an egg which, were it to  develop, would produce a voracious larva, capable of starving them in  a very short time. When rearing the larvae myself in test-tubes, I  have found that the Sitares take thirty-five to forty days to finish  their mess of honey and that the larvae of the Anthophora spend less  than a fortnight over the same meal.    It is in the first half of July that the Sitaris-grubs reach their  full dimensions. At this period the cell usurped by the parasite  contains nothing beyond a full-fed larva and, in a corner, a heap of  reddish droppings. This larva is soft and white, about half an inch in  length and a quarter of an inch wide at its broadest part. Seen from  above as it floats on the honey, it is elliptical in form, tapering  gradually towards the front and more suddenly towards the rear. Its  ventral surface is"]]]
