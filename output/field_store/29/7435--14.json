[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38077"],[0,"British Birds in Their Haunts (#14)"],[1," his time  set the example, competent observers of birds were rare. It differs  externally from the preceding, in its smaller size, and the darker  colour of its beak, upper plumage, and feet, and resembles it closely  in its habits, though I have never observed that it indulges in the  eccentric perpendicular flights, which have gained for its congener,  the Greater Whitethroat, the quaint sobriquet of 'singing skyrocket.'  It feeds, too, on insects, and is not found wanting when raspberries  and cherries are ripe. But no matter what number of these it consumes,  it ought with its companions to be welcomed by the gardener as one of  his most valuable friends. For it should be borne in mind, that these  birds, by consuming a portion of a crop of ripe fruit, do not at all  injure the trees, but that the countless aphides and caterpillars  which they devoured at an earlier period of the year, would, if they  had been allowed to remain, have feasted on the leaves and young  shoots, and so not only have imperilled the coming crop, but damaged  the tree so materially as to impair its fertility for some time to  come. Those birds, therefore, which in spring feed on insects and  nourish their young on the same diet, may be considered as necessary  to protect from injury the trees which are destined to supply them  with support when insect food becomes scarce. Consider what would be  the result if the proper food of birds were leaves, or if insects were  permitted to devour the foliage unchecked! our woods would be  leafless, our gardens would become deserts.        THE GARDEN WARBLER     SYLVIA HORTENSIS        Upper parts greyish brown, slightly tinged with olive; orbits      white; below the ear a patch of ash-grey; throat dull white;      breast and flanks grey, tinged with rust colour; rest of the      under parts dull white. Length five inches and three-quarters;      breadth eight and a half. Eggs greenish white, speckled with      two shades of greenish brown.    Though tolerably well dispersed throughout England, this bird is by no  means so abundant as the Blackcap, which it resembles in size and  habits, but it arrives later, coming early in May. It is very local.  Its song is little if at all inferior to that of the bird just named,  and it is far from improbable that some of the sweet strains for which  the Blackcap gets credit, particularly late in the summer, may be  produced by the Garden Warbler; I have heard its song so late as the  fifth of October. By some authors it is called the Greater Pettychaps,  by others the _Fauvette_, which latter name is by some French  ornithologists applied to the group containing this bird and several  allied species. Its nest and eggs are so like those of the Blackcap as  to be discriminated with difficulty.        THE BLACKCAP     SYLVIA ATRICAPILLA        Top and back of the head black, in the _female_ chocolate      colour; upper parts, wings, and tail ash-grey, slightly tinged      with olive; neck light grey passing into greyish white; bill      and feet black. Length five inches and a half; breadth eight      and a half. Eggs pale greenish white, variously mottled with      several shades of brown; sometimes pinkish, mottled with light      purple, and speckled with dark purple.    Whatever difference of opinion there may be as to the character of the  Nightingale's song--whether it partakes more of joyousness or of  melancholy--the gladsomeness of the Blackcap's warble is beyond all  dispute. Conceding to the Nightingale the first place among the  warblers which visit England, we do not hesitate to claim the second  for the Blackcap. Its song is inferior in power and compass to that of  the bird of night, but there is about it a delicious eloquence which  makes it irresistibly charming. White of Selborne describes it as  \"full, sweet, deep, loud and wild\"; high but not unmerited praise. If  there are no vocal efforts to astonish, there are no piteous wailings  to distress, and though the bird retires to rest at a reasonable hour,  it continues its song until a late period of the season, long after  that of the Nightingale has degenerated to a croak. It has been  compared to that of the Redbreast, but it is more mellow and  flute-like; to that of the Thrush, but it is softer and of more  compass; to that of the Lark, but it is more varied. A practised ear  will confound it with neither of these, though, strange to say, many  persons who have lived all their lives in the country and who take  much interest in its pleasant sights and sounds, habitually confound  it with the song of one or other of these birds, not knowing to whom  they are indebted for one of the principal charms of their gardens.  The Blackcap, like several other of the migratory warblers, returns  again and again to its old haunts. For six successive years it has  been known to build its nest in a bramble which hung down from a rock  in a public garden; and for even a longer period my own garden has  been annually visited by a pair who, from unfailingly resorting to the  same bushes, must, I have little doubt, be the same pair, though I  cannot say that I have found or even searched for their nest. On its  first arrival in April, the Blackcap is in the habit of what  bird-fanciers call 'recording'--that is, practising over its song in a  low tone. During this season of rehearsal it does not care to be seen,  but hides away in a thick bush. It is nevertheless by no means shy of  being heard, as it will allow the listener to approach within a few  yards of its hiding-place without stopping its song, and if disturbed  will remove to a very little distance and recommence. After a few days  it acquires its full powers of voice.    Its song is now remarkable among the full choir for sweetness,  loudness, and long continuance. Its food at this time consists of  aphides, caterpillars, and other small insects which infest roses and  fruit-trees; it rarely captures flies on the wing or descends to feed  on the ground. In June it begins to sing shorter strains, but with no  diminished power. It may then be observed flying from branch to branch  of an apple-tree, resting for a few seconds only in the same spot, and  busily occupied in collecting grubs or aphides, then indulging in a  short strain. In July, when the raspberries ripen, the Blackcap  becomes chary of its song, and introduces its young brood to the  choicest and juiciest fruit; in their attentions to which both old and  young birds are exceedingly pertinacious, holding scarecrows in  extreme contempt, and heeding clapping of hands or the discharge of a  gun as little. The young of the first year resemble the adult female  in having a chocolate-coloured crown. The song of the Blackcap may be  heard occasionally late in the summer; in September or October both  old and young take their departure, and the Redbreast is left without  a rival to assert his superiority as a warbler, until the return of  spring. The nest is usually placed in a hedge or low bush, a few feet  from the ground, and is constructed of bents, and lined with fibrous  roots and hair. The male bird assists the female in performing the  office of incubation, and is said to relieve the monotony of his  occupation by singing, thus often betraying a well-concealed nest.        THE DARTFORD WARBLER     SYLVIA UNDATA        Upper parts blackish brown; under, purplish red; middle of the      abdomen white; tail long, dark brown, the outer feather tipped      with white; wings very short; quills ash-grey on the inner      web, dark brown on the outer; feet yellowish; bill yellowish      white, with a black tip. Length five inches and a half. Eggs      greenish white, speckled all over, and especially at the      larger end, with brown and ash-grey.    This species received its name from having been first shot on Bexley  Heath, near Dartford in 1773. It has since been observed on furzy  commons in several of the southern and western counties, but is local  and nowhere abundant. In its habits it resembles the Stone and Furze  Chats, perching on the upper sprays of the furze and whitehorn, but  never still for a minute, throwing itself into various attitudes,  erecting its crest and tail at intervals, frequently rising into the  air with most fantastic movements, catching insects on the wing, and  either returning to the same twig, or making a short flight to some  other convenient bush. The syllables '_cha cha cha_' are several times  repeated when the bird is irritated. Its note is commonly _Pitchou_,  hence its French name. It keeps quite aloof from human habitations,  and is so timid that on the approach of an observer, it creeps into a  bush, and remains concealed until the danger is past. The nest of  goose grass and soft bits of furze, wool and moss is placed in the  fork of a furze-bush selected for its thickness and difficulty of  access. It is somewhat wandering, but may be called a resident in the  South, gradually extending northwards. Many specimens have been  observed in mid-winter, and Rennie states that he has seen one as  early as the end of February hovering over furze and singing like a  Whitethroat.        THE REED WARBLER     ACROCA%PHALUS STRA%PERUS        Upper parts of a uniform reddish brown, without spots;      wing-feathers brown, edged with olive; a white streak between      (not over) the eye and bill; throat white; under plumage      yellowish white, the sides tinged with reddish; tail long,      rounded. Length five and a half inches; breadth seven and a      half. Eggs dull greenish white, speckled with olive and light      brown, especially towards the larger end.    Both the Sedge and the Reed warblers are _jaseuses_, or chatterers,  with rounded tails; but the Sedge Warbler has its upper plumage  spotted with dark brown, and a white line above its eye, while the  upper plumage of the Reed Warbler is of a uniform pale brown, and the  light mark is absent "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3810"],[0,"The Man-Eaters of Tsavo, and Other East African Adventures (#14)"],[1,"animals which had  died from the bite of the tsetse fly were placed in likely spots, but  the wily man-eaters would not touch them, and much preferred live men  to dead donkeys.) Poison may have been used early in the history of  man, for its powers are employed with strange skill by the men in the  tropical forest, both in American and West Central Africa. But there is  no evidence that the old inhabitants of Europe, or of Assyria or Asia  Minor, ever killed lions or wolves by this means. They looked to the  King or chief, or some champion, to kill these monsters for them. It  was not the sport but the duty of. Kings, and was in itself a title to  be a ruler of men. Theseus, who cleared the roads of beasts and  robbers; Hercules, the lion killer; St. George, the dragon-slayer, and  all the rest of their class owed to this their everlasting fame. From  the story of the Tsavo River we can appreciate their services to man  even at this distance of time. When the jungle twinkled with hundreds  of lamps, as the shout went on from camp to camp that the first lion  was dead, as the hurrying crowds fell prostrate in the midnight forest,  laying their heads on his feet, and the Africans danced savage and  ceremonial dances of thanksgiving, Mr. Patterson must have realised in  no common way what it was to have been a hero and deliverer in the days  when man was not yet undisputed lord of the creation, and might pass at  any moment under the savage dominion of the beasts.\"    Well had the two man-eaters earned all this fame; they had devoured  between them no less than twenty-eight Indian coolies, in addition to  scores of unfortunate African natives of whom no official record was  kept.          CHAPTER X    THE COMPLETION OF THE TSAVO BRIDGE      When all the excitement had died down and there was no longer any dread  of the man-eaters, work went on briskly, and the bridge over the Tsavo  rapidly neared completion. As the piers and abutments progressed in  height, the question of how to lift the large stones into their  positions had to be solved. We possessed no cranes for this purpose, so  I set to work and improvised a shears made of a couple of thirty-foot  rails. These were bolted together at the top, while the other ends were  fixed at a distance of about ten feet apart in a large block of wood.  This contrivance acted capitally, and by manipulation of ropes and  pulleys the heavy stones were swung into position quickly and without  difficulty, so that in a very short time the masonry of the bridge was  completed.    The next business was to span the sixty-foot distance between the piers  with iron girders. As I had neither winches nor sufficient blocks and  tackle to haul these over into position, I was driven to erect  temporary piers in the middle of each span, built up crib-shape of  wooden sleepers. Great wooden beams were stretched across from the  stone piers to these cribs, and laid with rails; and the girder was run  over its exact place, while still on the trucks in which it had been  brought up from the coast. It was next \"jacked\" up from the trucks,  which were hauled away empty, the temporary bridge was dismantled, and  the girder finally lowered gently into position. When the last girder  was thus successfully placed, no time was lost in linking up the  permanent way, and very soon I had the satisfaction of seeing the first  train cross the finished work.    Curiously enough, only a day or so after the bridge had been completed  and the intermediate cribs cleared away, a tremendous rain-storm broke  over the country. The river started to rise rapidly, soon flooding its  banks and becoming a raging murky torrent, tearing up trees by the  roots and whirling them along like straws. Steadily higher and higher  rose the flood, and standing on my bridge, I watched expectantly for  the two temporary trolley bridges--which, it will be remembered, we had  built across the stream in order to bring stone and sand to the main  work--to give way before the ever-rising volume of water. Nor had I  long to wait; for I soon caught sight of a solid mass of palm stems and  railway sleepers sweeping with almost irresistible force round the bend  of the river some little distance above the bridge. This I knew was the  debris of the trolley crossing furthest up the river. On it came, and  with it an additional bank of stormy-looking water. I held my breath  for the space of a moment as it actually leaped at the second frail  structure; there was a dull thud and a rending and riving of timbers,  and then the flood rolled on towards me, leaving not a vestige of the  two bridges behind it. The impact, indeed, was so great that the rails  were twisted round the broken tree-trunks as if they had been so much  ordinary wire. The double tier of wreckage now swept forward, and  hurled itself with a sullen plunge against the cutwaters of my stone  piers. The shock was great, but to my immense satisfaction the bridge  took it without a tremor, and I saw the remnant of the temporary  crossings swirl through the great spans and quickly disappear on its  journey to the ocean. I confess that I witnessed the whole occurrence  with a thrill of pride.    We were never long without excitement of some kind or another at Tsavo.  When the camp was not being attacked by man-eating lions, it was  visited by leopards, hyenas, wild dogs, wild cats, and other  inhabitants of the jungle around us. These animals did a great deal of  damage to the herds of sheep and goats which were kept to supply the  commissariat, and there was always great rejoicing when a capture was  made in one of the many traps that were laid for them.    Leopards especially are most destructive, often killing simply for  pleasure and not for food: and I have always harboured animosity  towards them since the night when one wantonly destroyed a whole herd  of mine. I happened at the time to have a flock of about thirty sheep  and goats which I kept for food and for milk, and which were secured at  sundown in a grass hut at one corner of my boma. One particularly dark  night we were startled by a tremendous commotion in this shed, but as  this was before the man-eaters were killed, no one dared stir out to  investigate the cause of the disturbance. I naturally thought that the  intruder was one of the \"demons,\" but all I could do was to fire  several shots in the direction of the hut, hoping to frighten him away.  In spite of these, however, it was some time before the noise died down  and everything became still again. As soon as it was dawn I went to the  shed to see what had happened, and there, to my intense anger, I found  every one of my sheep and goats lying stretched dead, on the ground  with its throat bitten through. A hole had been made through the frail  wall of the shed, and I saw from this and from the tracks all round  that the author of the wholesale slaughter had been a leopard. He had  not eaten one of the flock, but had killed them all out of pure love of  destruction.    I hoped that he would return the next night to make a meal; and should  he do so, I determined to have my revenge. I accordingly left the  carcases exactly as they lay, and having a very powerful steel  trap--like an enormous rat-trap, and quite strong enough to hold a  leopard if he should put his foot in it--I placed this in the opening  into the shed and secured it by a stout chain to a long stake driven  into the ground outside. Darkness found everyone in my boma on the  alert and listening anxiously to hear the noise the leopard would make  the moment he was caught in the trap. Nor were we disappointed, for  about midnight we heard the click of the powerful spring, followed  immediately by frantic roaring and plunging. I had been sitting all  evening with my rifle by my side and a lantern lighted, so I  immediately rushed out, followed by the chaukidar (watchman) carrying  the lamp. As we approached the shed, the leopard made a frantic spring  in our direction as far as the chain would allow him, and this so  frightened the chaukidar that he fled in terror, leaving me in utter  darkness. The night was as black as had been the previous one, and I  could see absolutely nothing; but I knew the general direction in which  to fire and accordingly emptied my magazine at the beast. As far as I  could make out, he kept dodging in and out through the broken wall of  the goat-house; but in a short time my shots evidently told, as his  struggles ceased and all was still. I called out that he was dead, and  at once everyone in the boma turned out, bringing all the lanterns in  the place. With the others came my Indian overseer, who shouted that he  too wanted revenge, as some of the goats had belonged to him. Whereupon  he levelled his revolver at the dead leopard, and shutting his eyes  tightly, fired four shots in rapid succession. Naturally not one of  these touched the beast, but they caused considerable consternation  amongst the onlookers, who scattered rapidly to right and left. Next  morning a party of starving Wa Kamba happened to be passing just as I  was about to skin the leopard, and asked by means of signs to be  allowed to do the job for me and then to take the meat. I of course  assented to this proposal, and in a very few minutes the skin had been  neatly taken off, and the famishing natives began a ravenous meal on  the raw flesh.    Wild dogs are also very destructive, and often caused great losses  among our sheep and goats. Many a night have I listened to these  animals hunting and harrying some poor creature of the wilds round my  camp; they never relinquish a chase, and will attack anything, man or  beast, when really driven by hunger. I was at Tsavo Station one  day--unfortunately without my rifle--when one of these dogs came up and  stood within about thirty yards of me. He was a fine-looking beast,  bigger than a collie, with jet-black hair and a white-tipped bushy"]]]
