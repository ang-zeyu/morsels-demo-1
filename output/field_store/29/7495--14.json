To the south was the mountain stream before mentioned, and back of that  the range of foot-hills.  The plaza in the centre of the city was the  citadel, properly speaking.  All the streets leading from it were swept  by artillery, cannon being intrenched behind temporary parapets. The  house-tops near the plaza were converted into infantry fortifications by  the use of sand-bags for parapets.  Such were the defences of Monterey  in September, 1847.  General Ampudia, with a force of certainly ten  thousand men, was in command.    General Taylor's force was about six thousand five hundred strong, in  three divisions, under Generals Butler, Twiggs and Worth.  The troops  went into camp at Walnut Springs, while the engineer officers, under  Major Mansfield--a General in the late war--commenced their  reconnoissance.  Major Mansfield found that it would be practicable to  get troops around, out of range of the Black Fort and the works on the  detached hills to the north-west of the city, to the Saltillo road.  With this road in our possession, the enemy would be cut off from  receiving further supplies, if not from all communication with the  interior. General Worth, with his division somewhat reinforced, was  given the task of gaining possession of the Saltillo road, and of  carrying the detached works outside the city, in that quarter. He  started on his march early in the afternoon of the 20th.  The divisions  under Generals Butler and Twiggs were drawn up to threaten the east and  north sides of the city and the works on those fronts, in support of the  movement under General Worth. Worth's was regarded as the main attack on  Monterey, and all other operations were in support of it.  His march  this day was uninterrupted; but the enemy was seen to reinforce heavily  about the Bishop's Palace and the other outside fortifications on their  left.  General Worth reached a defensible position just out of range of  the enemy's guns on the heights north-west of the city, and bivouacked  for the night.  The engineer officers with him--Captain Sanders and  Lieutenant George G. Meade, afterwards the commander of the victorious  National army at the battle of Gettysburg--made a reconnoissance to the  Saltillo road under cover of night.    During the night of the 20th General Taylor had established a battery,  consisting of two twenty-four-pounder howitzers and a ten inch mortar,  at a point from which they could play upon Black Fort.  A natural  depression in the plain, sufficiently deep to protect men standing in it  from the fire from the fort, was selected and the battery established on  the crest nearest the enemy.  The 4th infantry, then consisting of but  six reduced companies, was ordered to support the artillerists while  they were intrenching themselves and their guns.  I was regimental  quartermaster at the time and was ordered to remain in charge of camp  and the public property at Walnut Springs.  It was supposed that the  regiment would return to its camp in the morning.    The point for establishing the siege battery was reached and the work  performed without attracting the attention of the enemy.  At daylight  the next morning fire was opened on both sides and continued with, what  seemed to me at that day, great fury.  My curiosity got the better of my  judgment, and I mounted a horse and rode to the front to see what was  going on.  I had been there but a short time when an order to charge was  given, and lacking the moral courage to return to camp--where I had been  ordered to stay--I charged with the regiment As soon as the troops were  out of the depression they came under the fire of Black Fort.  As they  advanced they got under fire from batteries guarding the east, or lower,  end of the city, and of musketry. About one-third of the men engaged in  the charge were killed or wounded in the space of a few minutes.  We  retreated to get out of fire, not backward, but eastward and  perpendicular to the direct road running into the city from Walnut  Springs.  I was, I believe, the only person in the 4th infantry in the  charge who was on horseback.  When we got to a lace of safety the  regiment halted and drew itself together--what was left of it.  The  adjutant of the regiment, Lieutenant Hoskins, who was not in robust  health, found himself very much fatigued from running on foot in the  charge and retreat, and, seeing me on horseback, expressed a wish that  he could be mounted also.  I offered him my horse and he accepted the  offer.  A few minutes later I saw a soldier, a quartermaster's man,  mounted, not far away.  I ran to him, took his horse and was back with  the regiment in a few minutes.  In a short time we were off again; and  the next place of safety from the shots of the enemy that I recollect of  being in, was a field of cane or corn to the north-east of the lower  batteries.  The adjutant to whom I had loaned my horse was killed, and I  was designated to act in his place.    This charge was ill-conceived, or badly executed.  We belonged to the  brigade commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Garland, and he had received  orders to charge the lower batteries of the city, and carry them if he  could without too much loss, for the purpose of creating a diversion in  favor of Worth, who was conducting the movement which it was intended  should be decisive.  By a movement by the left flank Garland could have  led his men beyond the range of the fire from Black Fort and advanced  towards the northeast angle of the city, as well covered from fire as  could be expected.  There was no undue loss of life in reaching the  lower end of Monterey, except that sustained by Garland's command.    Meanwhile Quitman's brigade, conducted by an officer of engineers, had  reached the eastern end of the city, and was placed under cover of the  houses without much loss.  Colonel Garland's brigade also arrived at the  suburbs, and, by the assistance of some of our troops that had reached  house-tops from which they could fire into a little battery covering the  approaches to the lower end of the city, the battery was speedily  captured and its guns were turned upon another work of the enemy.  An  entrance into the east end of the city was now secured, and the houses  protected our troops so long as they were inactive.  On the west General  Worth had reached the Saltillo road after some fighting but without  heavy loss.  He turned from his new position and captured the forts on  both heights in that quarter.  This gave him possession of the upper or  west end of Monterey.  Troops from both Twiggs's and Butler's divisions  were in possession of the east end of the town, but the Black Fort to  the north of the town and the plaza in the centre were still in the  possession of the enemy.  Our camps at Walnut Springs, three miles away,  were guarded by a company from each regiment.  A regiment of Kentucky  volunteers guarded the mortars and howitzers engaged against Black Fort.  Practically Monterey was invested.    There was nothing done on the 22d by the United States troops; but the  enemy kept up a harmless fire upon us from Black Fort and the batteries  still in their possession at the east end of the city.  During the night  they evacuated these; so that on the morning of the 23d we held  undisputed possession of the east end of Monterey.    Twiggs's division was at the lower end of the city, and well covered  from the fire of the enemy.  But the streets leading to the plaza--all  Spanish or Spanish-American towns have near their centres a square  called a plaza--were commanded from all directions by artillery.  The  houses were flat-roofed and but one or two stories high, and about the  plaza the roofs were manned with infantry, the troops being protected  from our fire by parapets made of sand-bags.  All advances into the city  were thus attended with much danger.  While moving along streets which  did not lead to the plaza, our men were protected from the fire, and  from the view, of the enemy except at the crossings; but at these a  volley of musketry and a discharge of grape-shot were invariably  encountered.  The 3d and 4th regiments of infantry made an advance  nearly to the plaza in this way and with heavy loss.  The loss of the 3d  infantry in commissioned officers was especially severe.  There were  only five companies of the regiment and not over twelve officers  present, and five of these officers were killed.  When within a square  of the plaza this small command, ten companies in all, was brought to a  halt.  Placing themselves under cover from the shots of the enemy, the  men would watch to detect a head above the sand-bags on the neighboring  houses.  The exposure of a single head would bring a volley from our  soldiers.    We had not occupied this position long when it was discovered that our  ammunition was growing low.  I volunteered to go back (*2) to the point  we had started from, report our position to General Twiggs, and ask for  ammunition to be forwarded.  We were at this time occupying ground off  from the street, in rear of the houses.  My ride back was an exposed  one.  Before starting I adjusted myself on the side of my horse furthest  from the enemy, and with only one foot holding to the cantle of the  saddle, and an arm over the neck of the horse exposed, I started at full  run.  It was only at street crossings that my horse was under fire, but  these I crossed at such a flying rate that generally I was past and  under cover of the next block of houses before the enemy fired.  I got  out safely without a scratch.    At one place on my ride, I saw a sentry walking in front of a house, and  stopped to inquire what he was doing there.  Finding that the house was  full of wounded American officers and soldiers, I dismounted and went  in.  I found there Captain Williams, of the Engineer Corps, wounded in  the head, probably fatally, and Lieutenant Territt, also badly wounded  his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4376"],[0,"Sowing Seeds in Danny (#14)"],[1,"their pace.    \"I don't care how cross she is,\" Pearl said, \"if I can come for the  cows every night. Look at that fluffy white cloud! Say, wouldn't that  make a hat trimming that would do your heart good. The body of the hat  blue like that up there, edged 'round with that cloud over there, then  a blue cape with white fur on it just to match. I kin just feel that  white stuff under my chin.\"    Then Pearl began to cake-walk and sing a song she had heard Camilla  sing. She had forgotten some of the words, but Pearl never was at a  loss for words:       The wild waves are singing to the shore     As they were in the happy days of yore.    Pearl could not remember what the wild waves were singing, so she sang  what was in her own heart:       She can't take the ripple from the breeze,     And she can't take the rustle from the trees;     And when I am out of the old girl's sight     I can-just-do-as-I-please.    \"That's right, I think the same way and try to act up to it,\" a man's  voice said slowly. \"But don't let her hear you say so.\"    Pearl started at the sound of the voice and found herself looking into  such a good-natured face that she laughed too, with a feeling of  good-fellowship.    The old dog ran to the stranger with every sign of delight at seeing  him.    \"I am one of the neighbours,\" he said. \"I live over there\"--pointing to  a little car-roofed shanty farther up the creek. \"Did I frighten you? I  am sorry if I did, but you see I like the sentiment of your song so  much I could not help telling you. You need not think it strange if you  find me milking one of the cows occasionally. You see, I believe in  dealing directly with the manufacturer and thus save the middleman's  profit, and so I just take what milk I need from So-Bossie over there.\"    \"Does she know?\" Pearl asked, nodding toward the house.    \"Who? So-Bossie?\"    \"No, Mrs. Motherwell.\"    \"Well, no,\" he answered slowly. \"You haven't heard of her having a fit,  have you?\"    \"No,\" Pearl answered wonderingly.    \"Then we're safe in saying that the secret has been kept from her.\"    \"Does it hurt her, though?\" Pearl asked.    \"It would, very much, if she knew it,\" the young man replied gravely.    \"Oh, I mean the cow,\" Pearl said hastily.    \"It doesn't hurt the cow a bit. What does she care who gets the milk?  When did you come?\"    \"To-night,\" Pearl said. \"I must hurry. She'll have a rod in steep for  me if I'm late. My name's Pearl Watson. What's yours?\"    \"Jim Russell,\" he said. \"I know your brother Teddy.\"    Pearl was speeding down the hill. She shouted back:    \"I know who you are now. Good-bye!\" Pearl ran to catch up to the cows,  for the sun was throwing long shadows over the pasture, and the  plaintive lowing of the hungry calves came faintly to her ears.    A blond young man stood at the bars with four milk pails.    He raised his hat when he spoke to Pearl.    \"Madam says you are to help me to milk, but I assure you it is quite  unnecessary. Really, I would much prefer that you shouldn't.\"    \"Why?\" Pearl asked in wonder.    \"Oh, by Jove! You see it is not a woman's place to work outside like  this, don't you know.\"    \"That's because ye'r English,\" Pearl said, a sudden light breaking in  on her. \"Ma says when ye git a nice Englishman there's nothing nicer,  and pa knowed one once that was so polite he used to say 'Haw Buck' to  the ox and then he'd say, 'Oh, I beg yer pardon, I mean gee.' It wasn't  you, was it?\"    \"No,\" he said smiling, \"I have never driven oxen, but I have done a  great many ridiculous things I am sure.\"    \"So have I,\" Pearl said confidentially, as she sat down on a little  three-legged stool to milk So-Bossie. \"You know them fluffy white  things all made of lace and truck like that, that is hung over the beds  in rich people's houses, over the pillows, I mean?\"    \"Pillow-shams?\" he asked.    \"Yes, that's them! Well, when I stayed with Camilla one night at Mrs.  Francis's didn't I think they were things to pull down to keep the  flies off ye'r face. Say, you should have heard Camilla laugh, and ma  saw a girl at a picnic once who drank lemonade through her veil, and  she et a banana, skin and all.\"    Pearl laughed heartily, but the Englishman only smiled faintly.  Canadian ways were growing stranger all the time.    \"Say,\" Pearl began after a pause, \"who does the cow over there with the  horns bent down look like? Someone we both know, only the cow looks  pleasanter.\"    \"My word!\" the Englishman exclaimed, \"you're a rum one.\"    Pearl looked disappointed.    \"Animals often look like people,\" she said. \"We have two cows at home,  one looks like Mrs. White, so good and gentle, wouldn't say boo to a  goose; the other one looks just like Fred Miller. He works in the mill,  and his hair goes in a roll on the top; his mother did it that way with  a hair-pin too long, I guess, and now it won't go any other way, and I  know an animal that looks like you; he's a dandy, too, you bet. It is  White's dog, and he can jump the fence easy as anything.\"    \"Oh, give over, give over!\" the Englishman said stiffly.    Pearl laughed delightedly.    \"It's lots of fun guessing who people are like,\" she said. \"I'm awful  smart at it and so is Mary, four years younger'n me. Once we could not  guess who Mrs. Francis was like, and Mary guessed it. Mrs. Francis  looks like prayer--big bug eyes lookin' away into nothin', but hopin'  it's all for the best. Do you pray?\"    \"I am a rector's son,\" he answered.    \"Oh, I know, minister's son, isn't that lovely? I bet you know prayers  and prayers. But it isn't fair to pray in a race is it? When Jimmy  Moore and my brother Jimmy ran under twelve, Jimmie Moore prayed, and  some say got his father to pray, too; he's the Methodist minister, you  know, and, of course, he won it; but our Jimmy could ha' beat him easy  in a fair race, and no favours; but he's an awful snoopie kid and prays  about everything. Do you sing?\"    \"I do--a little,\" the Englishman said modestly.    \"Oh, my, I am glad,\" Pearl cried rapturously. \"When I was two years old  I could sing 'Hush my babe lie,' all through--I love singin'--I can  sing a little, too, but I don't care much for my own. Have they got an  organ here?\"    \"I don't know,\" he answered, \"I've only been in the kitchen.\"    \"Say, I'd like to see a melodeon. Just the very name of it makes me  think of lovely sounds, religious sounds, mountin' higher and higher  and swellin' out grander and grander, rollin' right into the great  white throne, and shakin' the streets of gold. Do you know the 'Holy  City,'\" she asked after a pause.    The Englishman began to hum it in a rich tenor.    \"That's it, you bet,\" she cried delightedly. \"Just think of you coming  all the way across the ocean and knowing that just the same as we do. I  used to listen at the keyhole when Mrs. Francis had company, and I was  there helping Camilla. Dr. Clay sang that lots of times.\"    The Englishman had not sung since he had left his father's house. He  began to sing now, in a sweet, full voice, resonant on the quiet  evening air, the cows staring idly at him. The old dog came down to the  bars with his bristles up, expecting trouble.    Old Sam and his son Tom coming in from work stopped to listen to these  strange sounds.    \"Confound them English!\" old Sam said. \"Ye'd think I was payin' him to  do that, and it harvest-time, too!\"    When Dr. Clay, with Danny Watson gravely perched beside him, drove  along the river road after saying good-bye to Pearl, they met Miss  Barner, who had been digging ferns for Mrs. McGuire down on the river  flat.    The doctor drew in his horse.    \"Miss Barner,\" he said, lifting his hat, \"if Daniel Mulcahey Watson and  I should ask you to come for a drive with us, I wonder what you would  say?\"    Miss Barner considered for a moment and then said, smiling:    \"I think I would say, 'Thank you very much, Mr. Watson and Dr. Clay, I  shall be delighted to come if you have room for me.'\"    Life had been easier for Mary Barner since Dr. Clay had come to  Millford. It was no longer necessary for her to compel her father to go  when he was sent for, and when patients came to the office, if she  thought her father did not know what he was doing, she got Dr. Clay to  check over the prescriptions.    It had been rather hard for Mary to ask him to do this, for she had a  fair share of her father's Scotch pride; but she had done too many hard  things in her life to hesitate now. The young doctor was genuinely glad  to serve her, and he made her feel that she was conferring, instead of  asking, a favour.    They drove along the high bank that fell perpendicularly to the river  below and looked down at the harvest scene that lay beneath them. The  air was full of the perfume of many flowers and the chatter of birds.    The Reverend Hugh Grantley drove swiftly by them, whereupon Danny made  his presence known for the first time by the apparently irrelevant  remark:    \"I know who Miss Barner's fellow is! so I do.\"    Now if Dr. Clay had given Danny even slight encouragement, he would  have pursued the subject, and that might have saved complications in  the days to come.        CHAPTER XII    FROM CAMILLA'S DIARY    It is nearly six months since I came to live with Mrs. Francis, and I  like housework so well and am so happy at it, that it shows clearly  that I am not a disguised heiress. My proud spirit does not chafe a bit  at having to serve meals and wear a cap (you should see how sweet I  look in a cap). I haven't got the fear on my heart all day that I will  make a mistake in a figure that will rise up and condemn me at the end  of the month as I used to be when I was book-keeping on a high stool,  for the Western Hail and Fire Insurance Company (peace to its ashes!).  \"All work is expression,\" Fra Elbertus says, so why may I not express  myself in blueberry pie and tomato soup?    Mrs. Francis is an appreciative mistress, and she is not so"]]]
