After seeking for  some time, Thor saw through the fog the uncertain outline of what  looked like a strangely-shaped house. Its open portal was so wide and  high that it seemed to take up all one side of the house. Entering  and finding neither fire nor light, Thor and his companions flung  themselves wearily down on the floor to sleep, but were soon disturbed  by a peculiar noise, and a prolonged trembling of the ground beneath  them. Fearing lest the main roof should fall during this earthquake,  Thor and his companions took refuge in a wing of the building, where  they soon fell sound asleep. At dawn, the god and his companions  passed out, but they had not gone very far ere they saw the recumbent  form of a sleeping giant, and perceived that the peculiar sounds  which had disturbed their rest were produced by his snores. At that  moment the giant awoke, arose, stretched himself, looked about him  for his missing property, and a second later picked up the object  which Thor and his companions had mistaken in the darkness for a  house. They then perceived with amazement that this was nothing more  than a huge mitten, and that the wing in which they had all slept  was the separate place for the giant's great thumb! Learning that  Thor and his companions were on their way to Utgard, as the giants'  realm was also called, Skrymir, the giant, proposed to be their guide;  and after walking with them all day, he brought them at nightfall to  a spot where he proposed to rest. Ere he composed himself for sleep,  however, he offered them the provisions in his wallet. But, in spite  of strenuous efforts, neither Thor nor his companions could unfasten  the knots which Skrymir had tied.          \"Skrymir's thongs      Seemed to thee hard,      When at the food thou couldst not get,      When, in full health, of hunger dying.\"                Saemund's Edda (Thorpe's tr.).        Utgard-loki    Angry because of his snoring, which kept them awake, Thor thrice  dealt him fearful blows with his hammer. These strokes, instead of  annihilating the monster, merely evoked sleepy comments to the effect  that a leaf, a bit of bark, or a twig from a bird's nest overhead had  fallen upon his face. Early on the morrow, Skrymir left Thor and his  companions, pointing out the shortest road to Utgard-loki's castle,  which was built of great ice blocks, with huge glittering icicles  as pillars. The gods, slipping between the bars of the great gate,  presented themselves boldly before the king of the giants, Utgard-loki,  who, recognising them, immediately pretended to be greatly surprised  at their small size, and expressed a wish to see for himself what  they could do, as he had often heard their prowess vaunted.    Loki, who had fasted longer than he wished, immediately declared  he was ready to eat for a wager with any one. So the king ordered  a great wooden trough full of meat to be brought into the hall, and  placing Loki at one end and his cook Logi at the other, he bade them  see which would win. Although Loki did wonders, and soon reached the  middle of the trough, he found that, whereas he had picked the bones  clean, his opponent had devoured both them and the trough.    Smiling contemptuously, Utgard-loki said that it was evident they  could not do much in the eating line, and this so nettled Thor that  he declared if Loki could not eat like the voracious cook, he felt  confident he could drain the biggest vessel in the house, such was  his unquenchable thirst. Immediately a horn was brought in, and,  Utgard-loki declaring that good drinkers emptied it at one draught,  moderately thirsty persons at two, and small drinkers at three,  Thor applied his lips to the rim. But, although he drank so deep  that he thought he would burst, the liquid still came almost up to  the rim when he raised his head. A second and third attempt to empty  this horn proved equally unsuccessful. Thialfi then offered to run  a race, but a young fellow named Hugi, who was matched against him,  soon outstripped him, although Thialfi ran remarkably fast.    Thor proposed next to show his strength by lifting weights, and was  challenged to pick up the giant's cat. Seizing an opportunity to  tighten his belt Megin-gioerd, which greatly enhanced his strength,  he tugged and strained but was able only to raise one of its paws  from the floor.          \"Strong is great Thor, no doubt, when Megingarder      He braces tightly o'er his rock-firm loins.\"                Viking Tales of the North (R. B. Anderson).      A last attempt on his part to wrestle with Utgard-loki's old nurse  Elli, the only opponent deemed worthy of such a puny fellow, ended  just as disastrously, and the gods, acknowledging they were beaten,  were hospitably entertained. On the morrow they were escorted to the  confines of Utgard, where the giant politely informed them that he  hoped they would never call upon him again, as he had been forced  to employ magic against them. He then went on to explain that he  was the giant Skrymir, and that had he not taken the precaution  to interpose a mountain between his head and Thor's blows, while  he seemingly lay asleep, he would have been slain, as deep clefts  in the mountain side, to which he pointed, testified to the god's  strength. Next he informed them that Loki's opponent was Logi (wild  fire); that Thialfi had run a race with Hugi (thought), than which no  swifter runner exists; that Thor's drinking horn was connected with  the ocean, where his deep draughts had produced a perceptible ebb;  that the cat was in reality the terrible Midgard snake encircling the  world, which Thor had nearly pulled out of the sea; and that Elli,  his nurse, was old age, whom none can resist. Having finished these  explanations and cautioned them never to return or he would defend  himself by similar delusions, Utgard-loki vanished, and although Thor  angrily brandished his hammer, and would have destroyed his castle,  such a mist enveloped it that it could not be seen, and the thunder  god was obliged to return to Thrud-vang without having administered  his purposed salutary lesson to the race of giants.              \"The strong-armed Thor      Full oft against Jotunheim did wend,      But spite his belt celestial, spite his gauntlets,      Utgard-Loki still his throne retains;      Evil, itself a force, to force yields never.\"                Viking Tales of the North (R. B. Anderson).        Thor and Hrungnir    Odin himself was once dashing through the air on his eight-footed steed  Sleipnir, when he attracted the attention of the giant Hrungnir,  who proposed a race, declaring that Gullfaxi, his steed, could  rival Sleipnir in speed. In the heat of the race, Hrungnir did not  notice the direction in which they were going, until, in the vain  hope of overtaking Odin, he urged his steed to the very gates of  Valhalla. Discovering then where he was, the giant grew pale with  fear, for he knew he had jeopardised his life by venturing into the  stronghold of the gods, his hereditary foes.    The AEsir, however, were too honourable to take even an enemy at a  disadvantage, and, instead of doing him harm, they asked him into their  banqueting-halls, where he proceeded to indulge in liberal potations  of the heavenly mead set before him. He soon grew so excited that he  began to boast of his power, declaring he would come some day and take  possession of Asgard, which he would destroy, together with the gods,  save only Freya and Sif, upon whom he gazed with an admiring leer.    The gods, knowing he was not responsible, let him talk unmolested;  but Thor, coming home just then from one of his journeys, and  hearing his threat to carry away the beloved Sif, flew into a  terrible rage. He furiously brandished his hammer, with intent to  annihilate the boaster. This the gods would not permit, however, and  they quickly threw themselves between the irate Thunderer and their  guest, imploring Thor to respect the sacred rights of hospitality,  and not to desecrate their peace-stead by shedding blood.    Thor was at last induced to bridle his wrath, but he demanded that  Hrungnir should appoint a time and place for a holmgang, as a Northern  duel was generally called. Thus challenged, Hrungnir promised to meet  Thor at Griottunagard, the confines of his realm, three days later,  and departed somewhat sobered by the fright he had experienced. When  his fellow giants heard how rash he had been, they chided him sorely;  but they took counsel together in order to make the best of a bad  situation. Hrungnir told them that he was to have the privilege of  being accompanied by a squire, whom Thialfi would engage in fight,  wherefore they proceeded to construct a creature of clay, nine  miles long, and proportionately wide, whom they called Mokerkialfi  (mist wader). As they could find no human heart big enough to put in  this monster's breast, they secured that of a mare, which, however,  kept fluttering and quivering with apprehension. The day of the duel  arrived. Hrungnir and his squire were on the ground awaiting the  arrival of their respective opponents. The giant had not only a flint  heart and skull, but also a shield and club of the same substance,  and therefore deemed himself well-nigh invincible. Thialfi came  before his master and soon after there was a terrible rumbling and  shaking which made the giant apprehensive that his enemy would come  up through the ground and attack him from underneath. He therefore  followed a hint from Thialfi and stood upon his shield.    A moment later, however, he saw his mistake, for, while Thialfi  attacked Mokerkialfi with a spade, Thor came with a rush upon the scene  and flung his hammer full at his opponent's head. Hrungnir, to ward  off the blow, interposed his stone club, which was shivered into pieces  that flew all "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2850"],[0,"The Wars of the Jews; Or, The History of the Destruction of Jerusalem (#14)"],[1,"fell upon the rest of the  city, and plundered it, having found the houses full of all sorts of  good things. So the king left a garrison at Jericho, and came back, and  sent the Roman army into those cities which were come over to him, to  take their winter quarters there, viz. into Judea, [or Idumea,] and  Galilee, and Samaria. Antigonus also by bribes obtained of Silo to let a  part of his army be received at Lydda, as a compliment to Antonius.              CHAPTER 16.           Herod Takes Sepphoris And Subdues The Robbers That Were In       The Caves; He After That Avenges Himself Upon Machaerus, As       Upon An Enemy Of His And Goes To Antony As He Was Besieging       Samosata.    1. So the Romans lived in plenty of all things, and rested from war.  However, Herod did not lie at rest, but seized upon Idumea, and kept it,  with two thousand footmen, and four hundred horsemen; and this he did by  sending his brother Joseph thither, that no innovation might be made by  Antigonus. He also removed his mother, and all his relations, who had  been in Masada, to Samaria; and when he had settled them securely, he  marched to take the remaining parts of Galilee, and to drive away the  garrisons placed there by Antigonus.    2. But when Herod had reached Sepphoris, 23 in a very great snow, he  took the city without any difficulty; the guards that should have kept  it flying away before it was assaulted; where he gave an opportunity  to his followers that had been in distress to refresh themselves, there  being in that city a great abundance of necessaries. After which he  hasted away to the robbers that were in the caves, who overran a great  part of the country, and did as great mischief to its inhabitants as  a war itself could have done. Accordingly, he sent beforehand three  cohorts of footmen, and one troop of horsemen, to the village Arbela,  and came himself forty days afterwards 24 with the rest of his forces  Yet were not the enemy affrighted at his assault but met him in arms;  for their skill was that of warriors, but their boldness was the  boldness of robbers: when therefore it came to a pitched battle,  they put to flight Herod's left wing with their right one; but Herod,  wheeling about on the sudden from his own right wing, came to their  assistance, and both made his own left wing return back from its flight,  and fell upon the pursuers, and cooled their courage, till they could  not bear the attempts that were made directly upon them, and so turned  back and ran away. 3. But Herod followed them, and slew them as he  followed them, and destroyed a great part of them, till those that  remained were scattered beyond the river [Jordan;] and Galilee was  freed from the terrors they had been under, excepting from those that  remained, and lay concealed in caves, which required longer time ere  they could be conquered. In order to which Herod, in the first place,  distributed the fruits of their former labors to the soldiers, and gave  every one of them a hundred and fifty drachmae of silver, and a great  deal more to their commanders, and sent them into their winter quarters.  He also sent to his youngest brother Pheroas, to take care of a good  market for them, where they might buy themselves provisions, and to  build a wall about Alexandrium; who took care of both those injunctions  accordingly.    4. In the mean time Antony abode at Athens, while Ventidius called for  Silo and Herod to come to the war against the Parthians, but ordered  them first to settle the affairs of Judea; so Herod willingly dismissed  Silo to go to Ventidius, but he made an expedition himself against those  that lay in the caves. Now these caves were in the precipices of craggy  mountains, and could not be come at from any side, since they had only  some winding pathways, very narrow, by which they got up to them; but  the rock that lay on their front had beneath it valleys of a vast depth,  and of an almost perpendicular declivity; insomuch that the king  was doubtful for a long time what to do, by reason of a kind of  impossibility there was of attacking the place. Yet did he at length  make use of a contrivance that was subject to the utmost hazard; for he  let down the most hardy of his men in chests, and set them at the mouths  of the dens. Now these men slew the robbers and their families, and when  they made resistance, they sent in fire upon them [and burnt them]; and  as Herod was desirous of saving some of them, he had proclamation made,  that they should come and deliver themselves up to him; but not one of  them came willingly to him; and of those that were compelled to come,  many preferred death to captivity. And here a certain old man, the  father of seven children, whose children, together with their mother,  desired him to give them leave to go out, upon the assurance and right  hand that was offered them, slew them after the following manner: He  ordered every one of them to go out, while he stood himself at the  cave's mouth, and slew that son of his perpetually who went out. Herod  was near enough to see this sight, and his bowels of compassion were  moved at it, and he stretched out his right hand to the old man, and  besought him to spare his children; yet did not he relent at all upon  what he said, but over and above reproached Herod on the lowness of  his descent, and slew his wife as well as his children; and when he had  thrown their dead bodies down the precipice, he at last threw himself  down after them.    5. By this means Herod subdued these caves, and the robbers that were  in them. He then left there a part of his army, as many as he thought  sufficient to prevent any sedition, and made Ptolemy their general, and  returned to Samaria; he led also with him three thousand armed footmen,  and six hundred horsemen, against Antigonus. Now here those that used  to raise tumults in Galilee, having liberty so to do upon his departure,  fell unexpectedly upon Ptolemy, the general of his forces, and slew him;  they also laid the country waste, and then retired to the bogs, and  to places not easily to be found. But when Herod was informed of this  insurrection, he came to the assistance of the country immediately, and  destroyed a great number of the seditions, and raised the sieges of all  those fortresses they had besieged; he also exacted the tribute of a  hundred talents of his enemies, as a penalty for the mutations they had  made in the country.    6. By this time [the Parthians being already driven out of the country,  and Pacorus slain] Ventidius, by Antony's command, sent a thousand  horsemen, and two legions, as auxiliaries to Herod, against Antigonus.  Now Antigonus besought Machaerus, who was their general, by letter, to  come to his assistance, and made a great many mournful complaints about  Herod's violence, and about the injuries he did to the kingdom; and  promised to give him money for such his assistance; but he complied not  with his invitation to betray his trust, for he did not contemn him that  sent him, especially while Herod gave him more money [than the other  offered]. So he pretended friendship to Antigonus, but came as a spy to  discover his affairs; although he did not herein comply with Herod, who  dissuaded him from so doing. But Antigonus perceived what his intentions  were beforehand, and excluded him out of the city, and defended himself  against him as against an enemy, from the walls; till Machaerus was  ashamed of what he had done, and retired to Emmaus to Herod; and as he  was in a rage at his disappointment, he slew all the Jews whom he met  with, without sparing those that were for Herod, but using them all as  if they were for Antigonus.    7. Hereupon Herod was very angry at him, and was going to fight against  Machaerus as his enemy; but he restrained his indignation, and marched  to Antony to accuse Machaerus of maladministration. But Machaerus was  made sensible of his offenses, and followed after the king immediately,  and earnestly begged and obtained that he would be reconciled to him.  However, Herod did not desist from his resolution of going to Antony;  but when he heard that he was besieging Samosata 25 with a great army,  which is a strong city near to Euphrates, he made the greater haste;  as observing that this was a proper opportunity for showing at once his  courage, and for doing what would greatly oblige Antony. Indeed, when he  came, he soon made an end of that siege, and slew a great number of the  barbarians, and took from them a large prey; insomuch that Antony, who  admired his courage formerly, did now admire it still more. Accordingly,  he heaped many more honors upon him, and gave him more assured hopes  that he should gain his kingdom; and now king Antiochus was forced to  deliver up Samosata.              CHAPTER 17.           The Death Of Joseph [Herod's Brother] Which Had Been       Signified To Herod In Dreams. How Herod Was Preserved Twice       After A Wonderful Manner. He Cuts Off The Head Of Pappus,       Who Was The Murderer Of His Brother And Sends That Head To       [His Other Brother] Pheroras, And In No Long Time He       Besieges Jerusalem And Marries Mariamne.    1. In the mean time, Herod's affairs in Judea were in an ill state. He  had left his brother Joseph with full power, but had charged him to make  no attempts against Antigonus till his return; for that Machaerus would  not be such an assistant as he could depend on, as it appeared by what  he had done already; but as soon as Joseph heard that his brother was  at a very great distance, he neglected the charge he had received, and  marched towards Jericho with five cohorts, which Machaerus sent with  him. This movement was intended for seizing on the corn, as it was  now in the midst of summer; but when his enemies attacked him in the  mountains, and in places which were difficult to pass, he was both  killed himself, as he was very bravely fighting in the "]]]
