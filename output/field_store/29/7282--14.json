To change the metaphor--Mr. West's       was a magnificent repository, Mr. Ratcliffe's a choice       cabinet of gems.]    Thirty years have been considered by Addison (somewhere in his  Spectator) as a pretty accurate period for the passing away of one  generation and the coming on of another. We have brought down our  researches to within a similar period of the present times; but, as  Addison has not made out the proofs of such assertion, and as many of  the relatives and friends of those who have fallen victims to the  BIBLIOMANIA, since the days of Ratcliffe, may yet be alive; moreover,  as it is the part of humanity not to tear open wounds which have been  just closed, or awaken painful sensibilities which have been well nigh  laid to rest; so, my dear Sir, in giving you a further account of this  fatal disorder, I deem it the most prudent method _not to expatiate_  upon the subsequent examples of its mortality. We can only mourn over  such names as BEAUCLERK, CROFTS, PEARSON, LORT, MASON, FARMER,  STEEVENS, WOODHOUSE, BRAND, and REED! and fondly hope that the list  may not be increased by those of living characters!    We are, in the SECOND place, to describe the SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE.    The ingenious Peignot, in the first volume of his 'Dictionnaire  Bibliologie,' p. 51, defines the Bibliomania[48] to be \"a passion for  possessing books; not so much to be instructed by them, as to gratify  the eye by looking on them. He who is affected by this mania knows  books only by their titles and dates, and is rather seduced by the  exterior than interior\"! This is, perhaps, too general and vague a  definition to be of much benefit in the knowledge, and consequent  prevention, of the disease: let us, therefore, describe it more  certainly and intelligibly.         [Footnote 48: There is a short, but smart and interesting,       article on this head in Mr. D'Israeli's _Curiosities of       Literature_, vol. 1. 10. \"Bruyere has touched on this mania       with humour; of such a collector (one who is fond of superb       bindings only) says he, as soon as I enter his house, I am       ready to faint on the stair-case from a strong smell of       morocco leather. In vain he shows me fine editions, gold       leaves, Etruscan bindings, &c.--naming them one after       another, as if he were showing a gallery of pictures!\"       Lucian has composed a biting invective against an ignorant       possessor of a vast library. \"One who opens his eyes, with       an hideous stare, at an old book, and, after turning over       the pages, chiefly admires the _date_ of its publication.\"]    Symptoms of this disease are instantly known by a passion for I.  _Large Paper Copies_: II. _Uncut Copies_: III. _Illustrated Copies_:  IV. _Unique Copies_: V. _Copies printed upon Vellum_: VI. _First  Editions_: VII. _True Editions_: VIII. _A general desire for the Black  Letter_. We will describe these symptoms more particularly.    I. _Large Paper Copies._ These are a certain set or limited number of  the work printed in a superior manner, both in regard to ink and press  work, on paper of a larger size, and better quality, than the ordinary  copies. Their price is enhanced in proportion to their beauty and  rarity. In the note below[49] are specified a few works which have  been published in this manner, that the sober collector may avoid  approaching them.         [Footnote 49: 1. _Lord Bacon's Essays_, 1798, 8vo., of which       it is said only five copies were struck off on royal folio.       In Lord Spencer's and the Cracherode, collection I have seen       a copy of this exquisitely printed book; the text of which,       surrounded by such an amplitude of margin, in the language       of Ernesti [see his Critique on Havercamp's Sallust] \"natut       velut cymba in oceano.\"         2. _Twenty Plays of Shakespeare_ published by Steevens from       the old quarto editions, 1766, 8vo. 6 vols. Of this edition       there were only twelve copies struck off on large paper. See       Bibl. Steevens, No. 1312.         3. _Dodsley's Collection of Old Plays_, 1780, 8vo., 12 vols.       only six copies printed on large paper. See Bibl. Woodhouse,       No. 198.         4. _The Grenville Homer._ Graece, 1800. 4to. 4 vols. Fifty       copies with plates were struck off on large paper, in royal       quarto. A copy of this kind was purchased at a sale in 1804,       for L99 15s.         5. _Sandford's Genealogical History_, etc. 1707, fol. Mr.       Arch of Cornhill purchased a copy of this work on large       paper, at the late sale of Baron Smyth's books, for L46. If       the largest paper of Clarke's Caesar be excepted, this is the       highest priced single volume on large paper, that I just now       recollect.         6. _Hearne's Works_ on large paper.         Something relating to Hearne will be found in the note at       page 7 ante. Here it will be only necessary to observe that       the Hernean rage for Large Paper is quite of recent growth,       but it promises to be giant-like. When the duplicates of a       part of Mr. Woodhull's library, in 1803, were sold, there       was a fine set of copies of this kind; but the prices,       comparatively with those now offered, were extremely       moderate. Mr. Otridge, the bookseller, told me an amusing       story of his going down to Liverpool, many years ago, and       accidentally purchasing from the library of the late Sir       Thomas Hanmer, a _magnificent set of Large Paper Hearnes_       for about 40 Guineas. Many of these are now in the choice       library of his Grace the Duke of Grafton. The copies were       catalogued as _small_ paper. Was there ever a more provoking       blunder?!]    This[50] symptom of the Bibliomania is, at the present day, both  general and violent, and threatens to extend still more widely. Even  modern publications are not exempt from its calamitous influence; and  when Mr. Miller, the bookseller, told me with what eagerness the large  paper copies of Lord Valentia's Travels were bespoke, and Mr. Evans  shewed me that every similar copy of his new edition of \"Burnett's  History of his own Times\" was disposed of, I could not help elevating  my eyes and hands, in token of commiseration at the prevalence of  this Symptom of the BIBLIOMANIA!         [Footnote 50: Analogous to Large Paper Copies are _tall       Copies_; that is, copies of the work published on the       ordinary size paper and not much cut down by the binder. The       want of _margin_ is a serious grievance complained of by       book-collectors; and when there is a contest of       margin-measuring, with books never professedly published on       large paper, the anxiety of each party to have the largest       copy is better conceived than described! How carefully, and       how adroitly, are the golden and silver rules then       exercised!]    II. _Uncut Copies._ Of all the symptoms of the Bibliomania, this is  probably the most extraordinary. It may be defined as a passion to  possess books of which the edges have never been sheared by the  binder's tools. And here, my dear Sir, I find myself walking upon  doubtful ground;--your UNCUT HEARNES rise up in \"rough majesty\" before  me, and almost \"push me from my stool.\" Indeed, when I look around in  my book-lined tub, I cannot but be conscious that this symptom of the  disorder has reached my own threshold; but when it is known that a few  of my bibliographical books are left with the edges uncut _merely to  please my friends_ (as one must sometimes study their tastes and  appetites as well as one's own), I trust that no very serious  conclusions will be drawn about the probable fatality of my own case.  As to uncut copies, although their inconvenience [an uncut lexicon to  wit!] and deformity must be acknowledged, and although a rational man  can want for nothing better than a book _once well bound_, yet we find  that the extraordinary passion for collecting them not only obtains  with full force, but is attended with very serious consequences to  those \"qui n'ont point des pistoles\" (to borrow the language of  Clement; vol. vi. p. 36). I dare say an uncut _first Shakspeare_, as  well as an uncut _first Homer_[51] would produce a little annuity!         [Footnote 51: \"Un superbe exemplaire de cette edition       _princeps_ a ete vendu, chez M. de Cotte, en 1804, la somme       de 3601 livres; mais il faut ajouter que cet exemplaire       tres-precieux est de la plus belle conservation; on dirait       qu'il sort dessous presse. De plus, il est peut-etre       _l'unique dont les marges n'ont pas ete rognees ni       coupees_!\"         Peignot's _Curiosites Bibliographiques_, lxv-vi.]    III. _Illustrated Copies._ A passion for books illustrated or adorned  with numerous prints, representing characters or circumstances  mentioned in the work, is a very general and violent symptom of the  Bibliomania, which has been known chiefly within the last half  century. The origin, or first appearance, of this symptom has been  traced by some to the publication of Granger's \"Biographical History  of England;\" but whoever will be at the pains of reading the preface  of this work will see that Granger sheltered himself under the  authorities of Evelyn, Ashmole, and others; and that he alone is not  to be considered as responsible for all the mischief which this  passion for collecting prints has occasioned. Granger, however, was  the first who introduced it in the form of a treatise, and surely \"in  an evil hour\" was this treatise published--although its amiable author  must be acquitted of \"malice prepense.\" His History of England[52]  seems to have sounded the tocsin for a general rummage after, and  slaughter of, old prints: venerable philosophers and veteran heroes,  who had long reposed in unmolested dignity within the magnificent  folio volumes which recorded their achievements, were instantly  dragged from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28553"],[0,"How it Works (#14)"],[1,"to install, so that in quite the  early days of telegraphy efforts were made to use the ether in the place  of wire as one conductor.    When a hammer strikes an anvil the air around is violently disturbed.  This disturbance spreads through the molecules of the air in much the  same way as ripples spread from the splash of a stone thrown into a  pond. When the sound waves reach the ear they agitate the tympanum, or  drum membrane, and we \"hear a noise.\" The hammer is here the  transmitter, the air the conductor, the ear the receiver.    In wireless telegraphy we use the ether as the conductor of electrical  disturbances.[13] Marconi, Slaby, Branly, Lodge, De Forest, Popoff, and  others have invented apparatus for causing disturbances of the requisite  kind, and for detecting their presence.    The main features of a wireless telegraphy outfit are shown in Figs. 59  and 61.      THE TRANSMITTER APPARATUS.    We will first consider the transmitting outfit (Fig. 59). It includes a  battery, dispatching key, and an induction coil having its secondary  circuit terminals connected with two wires, the one leading to an  earth-plate, the other carried aloft on poles or suspended from a kite.  In the large station at Poldhu, Cornwall, for transatlantic signalling,  there are special wooden towers 215 feet high, between which the aerial  wires hang. At their upper and lower ends respectively the earth and  aerial wires terminate in brass balls separated by a gap. When the  operator depresses the key the induction coil charges these balls and  the wires attached thereto with high-tension electricity. As soon as the  quantity collected exceeds the resistance of the air-gap, a discharge  takes place between the balls, and the ether round the aerial wire is  violently disturbed, and waves of electrical energy are propagated  through it. The rapidity with which the discharges follow one another,  and their travelling power, depends on the strength of the induction  coil, the length of the air-gap, and the capacity of the wires.[14]    [Illustration: FIG. 59.--Sketch of the transmitter of a wireless  telegraphy outfit.]    [Illustration: FIG. 60.--A Marconi coherer.]      RECEIVING APPARATUS.    The human body is quite insensitive to these etheric waves. We cannot  feel, hear, or see them. But at the receiving station there is what may  be called an \"electric eye.\" Technically it is named a _coherer_. A  Marconi coherer is seen in Fig. 60. Inside a small glass tube exhausted  of air are two silver plugs, P P, carrying terminals, T T, projecting  through the glass at both ends. A small gap separates the plugs at the  centre, and this gap is partly filled with nickel-silver powder. If the  terminals of the coherer are attached to those of a battery, practically  no current will pass under ordinary conditions, as the particles of  nickel-silver touch each other very lightly and make a \"bad contact.\"  But if the coherer is also attached to wires leading into the earth and  air, and ether waves strike those wires, at every impact the particles  will cohere--that is, pack tightly together--and allow battery current  to pass. The property of cohesion of small conductive bodies when  influenced by Hertzian waves was first noticed in 1874 by Professor D.E.  Hughes while experimenting with a telephone.    [Illustration: FIG. 61.--Sketch of the receiving apparatus in a  wireless telegraphy outfit.]    We are now in a position to examine the apparatus of which a coherer  forms part (Fig. 61). First, we notice the aerial and earth wires, to  which are attached other wires from battery A. This battery circuit  passes round the relay magnet R and through two choking coils, whose  function is to prevent the Hertzian waves entering the battery. The  relay, when energized, brings contact D against E and closes the circuit  of battery B, which is much more powerful than battery A, and operates  the magnet M as well as the _tapper_, which is practically an electric  bell minus the gong. (The tapper circuit is indicated by the dotted  lines.)    We will suppose the transmitter of a distant station to be at work. The  electric waves strike the aerial wire of the receiving station, and  cause the coherer to cohere and pass current. The relay is closed, and  both tapper and Morse inker begin to work. The tapper keeps striking the  coherer and shakes the particles loose after every cohesion. If this  were not done the current of A would pass continuously after cohesion  had once taken place. When the key of the transmitter is pressed down,  the waves follow one another very quickly, and the acquired conductivity  of the coherer is only momentarily destroyed by the tap of the hammer.  During the impression of a dot by the Morse inker, contact is made and  broken repeatedly; but as the armature of the inker is heavy and slow to  move it does not vibrate in time with the relay and tapper. Therefore  the Morse instrument reproduces in dots and dashes the short and long  depressions of the key at the transmitting station, while the tapper  works rapidly in time with the relay. The Morse inker is shown  diagrammatically. While current passes through M the armature is pulled  towards it, the end P, carrying an inked wheel, rises, and a mark is  made on the tape W, which is moved continuously being drawn forward off  reel R by the clockwork--or electrically-driven rollers R^1 R^2.      SYNTONIC TRANSMISSION.    If a number of transmitting stations are sending out messages  simultaneously, a jumble of signals would affect all the receivers  round, unless some method were employed for rendering a receiver  sensitive only to the waves intended to influence it. Also, if  distinction were impossible, even with one transmitter in action its  message might go to undesired stations.    There are various ways of \"tuning\" receivers and transmitters, but the  principle underlying them all is analogous to that of mechanical  vibration. If a weight is suspended from the end of a spiral spring, and  given an upward blow, it bobs up and down a certain number of times per  minute, every movement from start to finish having exactly the same  duration as the rest. The resistance of the air and the internal  friction of the spring gradually lessen the amplitude of the movements,  and the weight finally comes to rest. Suppose that the weight scales 30  lbs., and that it naturally bobs twenty times a minute. If you now take  a feather and give it a push every three seconds you can coax it into  vigorous motion, assuming that every push catches it exactly on the  rebound. The same effect would be produced more slowly if 6 or 9 second  intervals were substituted. But if you strike it at 4, 5, or 7 second  intervals it will gradually cease to oscillate, as the effect of one  blow neutralizes that of another. The same phenomenon is witnessed when  two tuning-forks of equal pitch are mounted near one another, and one is  struck. The other soon picks up the note. But a fork of unequal pitch  would remain dumb.    Now, every electrical circuit has a \"natural period of oscillation\" in  which its electric charge vibrates. It is found possible to \"tune,\" or  \"syntonize,\" the aerial rod or wire of a receiving station with a  transmitter. A vertical wire about 200 feet in length, says Professor  J.A. Fleming,[15] has a natural time period of electrical oscillation of  about one-millionth of a second. Therefore if waves strike this wire a  million times a second they will reinforce one another and influence the  coherer; whereas a less or greater frequency will leave it practically  unaffected. By adjusting the receiving circuit to the transmitter, or  _vice versa_, selective wireless telegraphy becomes possible.      ADVANCE OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.    The history of wireless telegraphy may be summed up as follows:--    1842.--Professor Morse sent aerial messages across the Susquehanna  River. A line containing a battery and transmitter was carried on posts  along one bank and \"earthed\" in the river at each end. On the other bank  was a second wire attached to a receiver and similarly earthed. Whenever  contact was made and broken on the battery side, the receiver on the  other was affected. Distance about 1 mile.    1859.--James Bowman Lindsay transmitted messages across the Tay at  Glencarse in a somewhat similar way. Distance about 1/2 mile.    1885.--Sir William Preece signalled from Lavernock Point, near Cardiff,  to Steep Holm, an island in the Bristol Channel. Distance about 5-1/2  miles.    In all these electrical _induction_ of current was employed.    1886.--Hertzian waves discovered.    1895.--Professor A. Popoff sent Hertzian wave messages over a distance  of 3 miles.    1897.--Marconi signalled from the Needles Hotel, Isle of Wight, to  Swanage; 17-1/2 miles.    1901.--Messages sent at sea for 380 miles.    1901, Dec. 17.--Messages transmitted from Poldhu, Cornwall, to Hospital  Point, Newfoundland; 2,099 miles.    Mr. Marconi has so perfected tuning devices that his transatlantic  messages do not affect receivers placed on board ships crossing the  ocean, unless they are purposely tuned. Atlantic liners now publish  daily small newspapers containing the latest news, flashed through space  from land stations. In the United States the De Forest and Fessenden  systems are being rapidly extended to embrace the most out-of-the-way  districts. Every navy of importance has adopted wireless telegraphy,  which, as was proved during the Russo-Japanese War, can be of the  greatest help in directing operations.
