Sec. XXXVII. II. PRIDE OF STATE. It was noticed in the second volume of  \"Modern Painters,\" p. 122, that the principle which had most power in  retarding the modern school of portraiture was its constant expression  of individual vanity and pride. And the reader cannot fail to have  observed that one of the readiest and commonest ways in which the  painter ministers to this vanity, is by introducing the pedestal or  shaft of a column, or some fragment, however simple, of Renaissance  architecture, in the background of the portrait. And this is not merely  because such architecture is bolder or grander than, in general, that of  the apartments of a private house. No other architecture would produce  the same effect in the same degree. The richest Gothic, the most massive  Norman, would not produce the same sense of exaltation as the simple  and meagre lines of the Renaissance.    Sec. XXXVIII. And if we think over this matter a little, we shall soon  feel that in those meagre lines there is indeed an expression of  aristocracy in its worst characters; coldness, perfectness of training,  incapability of emotion, want of sympathy with the weakness of lower men,  blank, hopeless, haughty self-sufficiency. All these characters are  written in the Renaissance architecture as plainly as if they were graven  on it in words. For, observe, all other architectures have something in  them that common men can enjoy; some concession to the simplicities of  humanity, some daily bread for the hunger of the multitude. Quaint fancy,  rich ornament, bright color, something that shows a sympathy with men of  ordinary minds and hearts; and this wrought out, at least in the Gothic,  with a rudeness showing that the workman did not mind exposing his own  ignorance if he could please others. But the Renaissance is exactly the  contrary of all this. It is rigid, cold, inhuman; incapable of glowing,  of stooping, of conceding for an instant. Whatever excellence it has is  refined, high-trained, and deeply erudite; a kind which the architect  well knows no common mind can taste. He proclaims it to us aloud. \"You  cannot feel my work unless you study Vitruvius. I will give you no gay  color, no pleasant sculpture, nothing to make you happy; for I am a  learned man. All the pleasure you can have in anything I do is in its  proud breeding, its rigid formalism, its perfect finish, its cold  tranquillity. I do not work for the vulgar, only for the men of the  academy and the court.\"    Sec. XXXIX. And the instinct of the world felt this in a moment. In the  new precision and accurate law of the classical forms, they perceived  something peculiarly adapted to the setting forth of state in an  appalling manner: Princes delighted in it, and courtiers. The Gothic was  good for God's worship, but this was good for man's worship. The Gothic  had fellowship with all hearts, and was universal, like nature: it could  frame a temple for the prayer of nations, or shrink into the poor man's  winding stair. But here was an architecture that would not shrink, that  had in it no submission, no mercy. The proud princes and lords rejoiced  in it. It was full of insult to the poor in its every line. It would not  be built of the materials at the poor man's hand; it would not roof  itself with thatch or shingle, and black oak beams; it would not wall  itself with rough stone or brick; it would not pierce itself with small  windows where they were needed; it would not niche itself, wherever  there was room for it, in the street corners. It would be of hewn stone;  it would have its windows and its doors, and its stairs and its pillars,  in lordly order, and of stately size; it would have its wings and its  corridors, and its halls and its gardens, as if all the earth were its  own. And the rugged cottages of the mountaineers, and the fantastic  streets of the laboring burgher were to be thrust out of its way, as of  a lower species.    Sec. XL. It is to be noted also, that it ministered as much to luxury as to  pride. Not to luxury of the eye, that is a holy luxury; Nature ministers  to that in her painted meadows, and sculptured forests, and gilded  heavens; the Gothic builder ministered to that in his twisted traceries,  and deep-wrought foliage, and burning casements. The dead Renaissance  drew back into its earthliness, out of all that was warm and heavenly;  back into its pride, out of all that was simple and kind; back into its  stateliness, out of all that was impulsive, reverent, and gay. But it  understood the luxury of the body; the terraced and scented and grottoed  garden, with its trickling fountains and slumbrous shades; the spacious  hall and lengthened corridor for the summer heat; the well-closed  windows, and perfect fittings and furniture, for defence against the  cold; and the soft picture, and frescoed wall and roof, covered with the  last lasciviousness of Paganism;--this is understood and possessed to  the full, and still possesses. This is the kind of domestic architecture  on which we pride ourselves, even to this day, as an infinite and  honorable advance from the rough habits of our ancestors; from the time  when the king's floor was strewn with rushes, and the tapestries swayed  before the searching wind in the baron's hall.    Sec. XLI. Let us hear two stories of those rougher times.    At the debate of King Edwin with his courtiers and priests, whether he  ought to receive the Gospel preached to him by Paulinus, one of his  nobles spoke as follows:    \"The present life, O king! weighed with the time that is unknown, seems  to me like this. When you are sitting at a feast with your earls and  thanes in winter time, and the fire is lighted, and the hall is warmed,  and it rains and snows, and the storm is loud without, there comes a  sparrow, and flies through the house. It comes in at one door and goes  out at the other. While it is within, it is not touched by the winter's  storm; but it is but for the twinkling of an eye, for from winter it  comes and to winter it returns. So also this life of man endureth for a  little space; what goes before or what follows after, we know not.  Wherefore, if this new lore bring anything more certain, it is fit that  we should follow it.\"[13]    That could not have happened in a Renaissance building. The bird could  not have dashed in from the cold into the heat, and from the heat back  again into the storm. It would have had to come up a flight of marble  stairs, and through seven or eight antechambers; and so, if it had ever  made its way into the presence chamber, out again through loggias and  corridors innumerable. And the truth which the bird brought with it,  fresh from heaven, has, in like manner, to make its way to the  Renaissance mind through many antechambers, hardly, and as a despised  thing, if at all.    Sec. XLII. Hear another story of those early times.    The king of Jerusalem, Godfrey of Bouillon, at the siege of Asshur, or  Arsur, gave audience to some emirs from Samaria and Naplous. They found  him seated on the ground on a sack of straw. They expressing surprise,  Godfrey answered them: \"May not the earth, out of which we came, and  which is to be our dwelling after death, serve us for a seat during  life?\"    It is long since such a throne has been set in the reception chambers  of Christendom, or such an answer heard from the lips of a king.    Thus the Renaissance spirit became base both in its abstinence and its  indulgence. Base in its abstinence; curtailing the bright and playful  wealth of form and thought, which filled the architecture of the earlier  ages with sources of delight for their hardy spirit, pure, simple, and  yet rich as the fretwork of flowers and moss, watered by some strong and  stainless mountain stream: and base in its indulgence; as it granted to  the body what it withdrew from the heart, and exhausted, in smoothing  the pavement for the painless feet, and softening the pillow for the  sluggish brain, the powers of art which once had hewn rough ladders into  the clouds of heaven, and set up the stones by which they rested for  houses of God.    Sec. XLIII. And just in proportion as this courtly sensuality lowered  the real nobleness of the men whom birth or fortune raised above their  fellows, rose their estimate of their own dignity, together with the  insolence and unkindness of its expression, and the grossness of the  flattery with which it was fed. Pride is indeed the first and the last  among the sins of men, and there is no age of the world in which it has  not been unveiled in the power and prosperity of the wicked. But there  was never in any form of slavery, or of feudal supremacy, a  forgetfulness so total of the common majesty of the human soul, and of  the brotherly kindness due from man to man, as in the aristocratic  follies in the Renaissance. I have not space to follow out this most  interesting and extensive subject; but here is a single and very curious  example of the kind of flattery with which architectural teaching was  mingled when addressed to the men of rank of the day.    Sec. XLIV. In St. Mark's library there is a very curious Latin manuscript  of the twenty-five books of Averulinus, a Florentine architect, upon the  principles of his art. The book was written in or about 1460, and  translated into Latin, and richly illuminated for Corvinus, king of  Hungary, about 1483. I extract from the third book the following passage  on the nature of stones. \"As there are three genera of men,--that is to  say, nobles, men of the middle classes, and rustics,--so it appears that  there are of stones. For the marbles and common stones of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30775"],[0,"Elements of Chemistry, (#14)"],[1,"attraction, or affinity, for phosphorus than for caloric; that, in  consequence of this, the phosphorus attracts the base of oxygen gas from  the caloric, which, being set free, spreads itself over the surrounding  bodies. But, though this experiment be so far perfectly conclusive, it  is not sufficiently rigorous, as, in the apparatus described, it is  impossible to ascertain the weight of the flakes of concrete acid which  are formed; we can therefore only determine this by calculating the  weights of oxygen and phosphorus employed; but as, in physics, and in  chemistry, it is not allowable to suppose what is capable of being  ascertained by direct experiment, I thought it necessary to rep at this  experiment, as follows, upon a larger scale, and by means of a different  apparatus.    I took a large glass baloon (A. Pl. iv. fig. 4.) with an opening three  inches diameter, to which was fitted a crystal stopper ground with  emery, and pierced with two holes for the tubes yyy, xxx. Before  shutting the baloon with its stopper, I introduced the support BC,  surmounted by the china cup D, containing 150 grs. of phosphorus; the  stopper was then fitted to the opening of the baloon, luted with fat  lute, and covered with slips of linen spread with quick-lime and white  of eggs: When the lute was perfectly dry, the weight of the whole  apparatus was determined to within a grain, or a grain and a half. I  next exhausted the baloon, by means of an air pump applied to the tube  XXX, and then introduced oxygen gas by means of the tube yyy, having a  stop cock adapted to it. This kind of experiment is most readily and  most exactly performed by means of the hydro-pneumatic machine described  by Mr Meusnier and me in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1782, pag. 466.  and explained in the latter part of this work, with several important  additions and corrections since made to it by Mr Meusnier. With this  instrument we can readily ascertain, in the most exact manner, both the  quantity of oxygen gas introduced into the baloon, and the quantity  consumed during the course of the experiment.    When all things were properly disposed, I set fire to the phosphorus  with a burning glass. The combustion was extremely rapid, accompanied  with a bright flame, and much heat; as the operation went on, large  quantities of white flakes attached themselves to the inner surface of  the baloon, so that at last it was rendered quite opake. The quantity  of these flakes at last became so abundant, that, although fresh oxygen  gas was continually supplied, which ought to have supported the  combustion, yet the phosphorus was soon extinguished. Having allowed the  apparatus to cool completely, I first ascertained the quantity of oxygen  gas employed, and weighed the baloon accurately, before it was opened. I  next washed, dried, and weighed the small quantity of phosphorus  remaining in the cup, on purpose to determine the whole quantity of  phosphorus consumed in the experiment; this residuum of the phosphorus  was of a yellow ochrey colour. It is evident, that by these several  precautions, I could easily determine, 1st, the weight of the phosphorus  consumed; 2d, the weight of the flakes produced by the combustion; and,  3d, the weight of the oxygen which had combined with the phosphorus.  This experiment gave very nearly the same results with the former, as it  proved that the phosphorus, during its combustion, had absorbed a little  more than one and a half its weight of oxygen; and I learned with more  certainty, that the weight of the new substance, produced in the  experiment, exactly equalled the sum of the weights of the phosphorus  consumed, and oxygen absorbed, which indeed was easily determinable _a  priori_. If the oxygen gas employed be pure, the residuum after  combustion is as pure as the gas employed; this proves that nothing  escapes from the phosphorus, capable of altering the purity of the  oxygen gas, and that the only action of the phosphorus is to separate  the oxygen from the caloric, with which it was before united.    I mentioned above, that when any combustible body is burnt in a hollow  sphere of ice, or in an apparatus properly constructed upon that  principle, the quantity of ice melted during the combustion is an exact  measure of the quantity of caloric disengaged. Upon this head, the  memoir given by M. de la Place and me, A(masculine ordinal). 1780, p. 355,  may be consulted. Having submitted the combustion of phosphorus to this  trial, we found that one pound of phosphorus melted a little more than  100 pounds of ice during its combustion.    The combustion of phosphorus succeeds equally well in atmospheric air as  in oxygen gas, with this difference, that the combustion is vastly  slower, being retarded by the large proportion of azotic gas mixed with  the oxygen gas, and that only about one-fifth part of the air employed  is absorbed, because as the oxygen gas only is absorbed, the proportion  of the azotic gas becomes so great toward the close of the experiment,  as to put an end to the combustion.    I have already shown, that phosphorus is changed by combustion into an  extremely light, white, flakey matter; and its properties are entirely  altered by this transformation: From being insoluble in water, it  becomes not only soluble, but so greedy of moisture, as to attract the  humidity of the air with astonishing rapidity; by this means it is  converted into a liquid, considerably more dense, and of more specific  gravity than water. In the state of phosphorus before combustion, it had  scarcely any sensible taste, by its union with oxygen it acquires an  extremely sharp and sour taste: in a word, from one of the class of  combustible bodies, it is changed into an incombustible substance, and  becomes one of those bodies called acids.    This property of a combustible substance to be converted into an acid,  by the addition of oxygen, we shall presently find belongs to a great  number of bodies: Wherefore, strict logic requires that we should adopt  a common term for indicating all these operations which produce  analogous results; this is the true way to simplify the study of  science, as it would be quite impossible to bear all its specifical  details in the memory, if they were not classically arranged. For this  reason, we shall distinguish this conversion of phosphorus into an acid,  by its union with oxygen, and in general every combination of oxygen  with a combustible substance, by the term of _oxygenation_: from which  I shall adopt the verb to _oxygenate_, and of consequence shall say,  that in _oxygenating_ phosphorus we convert it into an acid.    Sulphur is likewise a combustible body, or, in other words, it is a body  which possesses the power of decomposing oxygen gas, by attracting the  oxygen from the caloric with which it was combined. This can very easily  be proved, by means of experiments quite similar to those we have given  with phosphorus; but it is necessary to premise, that in these  operations with sulphur, the same accuracy of result is not to be  expected as with phosphorus; because the acid which is formed by the  combustion of sulphur is difficultly condensible, and because sulphur  burns with more difficulty, and is soluble in the different gasses. But  I can safely assert, from my own experiments, that sulphur in burning  absorbs oxygen gas; that the resulting acid is considerably heavier than  the sulphur burnt; that its weight is equal to the sum of the weights of  the sulphur which has been burnt, and of the oxygen absorbed; and,  lastly that this acid is weighty, incombustible, and miscible with water  in all proportions: The only uncertainty remaining upon this head, is  with regard to the proportions of sulphur and of oxygen which enter into  the composition of the acid.    Charcoal, which, from all our present knowledge regarding it, must be  considered as a simple combustible body, has likewise the property of  decomposing oxygen gas, by absorbing its base from the caloric: But the  acid resulting from this combustion does not condense in the common  temperature; under the pressure of our atmosphere, it remains in the  state of gas, and requires a large proportion of water to combine with  or be dissolved in. This acid has, however, all the known properties of  other acids, though in a weaker degree, and combines, like them, with  all the bases which are susceptible of forming neutral salts.    The combustion of charcoal in oxygen gas, may be effected like that of  phosphorus in the bell-glass, (A. Pl. IV. fig. 3.) placed over mercury:  but, as the heat of red hot iron is not sufficient to set fire to the  charcoal, we must add a small morsel of tinder, with a minute particle  of phosphorus, in the same manner as directed in the experiment for the  combustion of iron. A detailed account of this experiment will be found  in the memoirs of the academy for 1781, p. 448. By that experiment it  appears, that 28 parts by weight of charcoal require 72 parts of oxygen  for saturation, and that the aeriform acid produced is precisely equal  in weight to the sum of the weights of the charcoal and oxygen gas  employed. This aeriform acid was called fixed or fixable air by the  chemists who first discovered it; they did not then know whether it was  air resembling that of the atmosphere, or some other elastic fluid,  vitiated and corrupted by combustion; but since it is now ascertained to  be an acid, formed like all others by the oxygenation of its peculiar  base, it is obvious that the name of fixed air is quite ineligible[11].    By burning charcoal in the apparatus mentioned p. 60, Mr de la Place and  I found that one lib. of charcoal melted 96 libs. 6 oz. of ice;  that, during the combustion, 2 libs. 9 oz. 1 gros. 10 grs. of  oxygen were absorbed, and that 3 libs. 9 oz. 1 gros. 10 grs. of  acid gas were formed. This gas weighs 0.695 parts of a grain for each "]]]
