Rubber moulds are now largely used for making these goods; being much  cleaner and very much easier used than starch moulds, and for new  beginners are very much better than starch. These moulds are now to be  bought much cheaper than they were a few years ago, the price now being  about $1.40 per lb. These moulds weigh about two pounds each and hold  ninety chocolate drops and can be refilled every half hour. We would  strongly advise the purchase of rubber moulds, as besides the saving of  time, neither starch boards, starch, plaster moulds or bellows are  required. Fletcher Manfg Co., carry a full line of moulds for chocolates  and creams.      CHOCOLATE FOR DIPPING.    This mixing is so often required by confectioners for so many purposes  that a good general recipe will not be out of place. If the instructions  are followed and a little discretion used with the colors, a light  glossy chocolate coating will be the result.      1 lb. Pure Chocolate.    3 oz. White Wax.    Chocolate Brown Color.    Cochineal.    PROCESS.--Put the chocolate in a saucepan; stand on the furnace plate or  near a fire; break up the wax into little pieces and stir it in until  all is melted; then add the brown color, with a little liquid cochineal,  stirring the whole until thoroughly mixed; it is then ready for use. For  cheap common goods, more wax may be used. When mixing in the color try a  little on a piece of white paper until satisfied with the blend.      GELATINE COCOANUT BARS (YELLOW).      8 lbs. White Sugar.    6 lbs. Glucose.    2-1/2 lbs. Gelatine.    3 lbs. Cocoanut sliced.    1 oz. Acid Tartaric.    3 pints Water.    Saffron Color.    Lemon Flavor.    PROCESS.--Soak the gelatine in cold water for twelve hours, boil the  sugar, glucose and water to a stiff ball, 255; remove the pan from the  fire; stir in the gelatine till dissolved; let it stand for a few  minutes and remove the scum from the top, then add the acid, flavor and  cocoanut; gently stir the whole until well mixed; tinge a bright yellow  with saffron; pour into oiled tins, making the sheet 1/2 inch thick;  when set, cut up in sticks to sell two or four for a cent.    N.B.--This boil may be divided into two lots, one half colored red and  flavored, raspberry, or a second boil may be made precisely as this one  altering the color and flavor only.      PATENT RUBBER CANDY MOULDS      New Patterns.      The best process in the world for making moulded Bon-bons or French    Creams and grained work, is by using Patent Rubber Candy Moulds. They    will entirely supplant the use of starch as a mould for manufacturing    such candies for the following reasons.      I.--Not alone can all the patterns at present made in starch be    reproduced in these moulds but also a large variety of others with a    perfection not before known, and which it would be impossible to use    in starch.      II.--A much superior quality of goods is produced, in as much as the    candies show as perfect a pattern as the moulds themselves.      III.--A saving at least 33 per cent is accomplished in labor.      IV.--No starch boards or starch is required, consequently the filling,    printing, sifting and blowing off are dispensed with--six items of    expense.      V.--The moulds specially facilitate the making of cream walnuts, cream    almonds and cream jellies and other combinations, because the nuts,    etc., can be pressed on the candy as soon as it has been poured into    the moulds. This cannot be done with starch moulds, as any pressure on    those will destroy the pattern.      VI.--Casting into starch moulds requires considerable experience and    skill in order to do work well, while any workman can turn out the    most perfect work with the rubber moulds, without any previous    experience in such work.      VII.--A saving of room is effected, as a starch room is not required    and the capacity of the rubber moulds is so much greater than starch    boards of equal size that a comparatively less number of moulds are    required to produce an equal quantity of goods.      VIII.--No starch being used, the shop will remain much cleaner.      These moulds are made of Pure Para Rubber and will, with proper usage    last from twelve to fifteen years, judging from those which have been    in use for the past four years.      An objection which naturally suggests itself to a person who has never    tried these moulds, is that the candies might possibly have some taste    of the rubber. This is not the case, however.        NOT THE SLIGHTEST TASTE OF RUBBER      is discernable. Not one of our many customers, either in this city or    throughout the country, has made a single complaint. This proves that    there is absolutely no difference between candies made in rubber    moulds and candies made in starch moulds.      The demand for these moulds increases every year.      WRITE FOR PRICES AND PARTICULARS.      Cream to be run in these moulds should be cooked one degree lower than    usual for starch.      Crystal 1/2 degree lower than usual for starch.      Before using New Moulds for first time, soak for half an hour in    strong common washing soda and water.      CHEAP JELLY GOODS.      14 lbs. White Sugar.    12 lbs. Glucose.    3 lbs. Gelatine.    Flavor.    2 oz. Tartaric Acid.    2 pints water.    Color.    PROCESS.--Soak the gelatine in cold water for twelve hours; bring the  sugar, and water to a boil, then add the glucose and continue boiling  till it reaches the degree of stiff ball; remove the pan from the fire  and stir in the gelatine and acid till dissolved; color and flavor to  fancy; remove the scum and run the batch into tins. Set the goods aside  for twelve hours, then cut up into jubes and crystalize with fine  powdered sugar. This is a cheap line; there is not much body in them,  but they sell at a price and give satisfaction.    [Illustration: Funnel Droppers.                 Tin.  Copper.

Gelatine.    2 oz. Tartaric Acid.    PROCESS.--Soak gelatine in cold water for twelve hours. Boil the sugar,  glucose and water in the usual way to the degree of ball; remove the pan  from the fire and stir in the gelatine gradually until dissolved; let  it stand for a few minutes; take off the scum as it rises, then divide  the boil, if required in more than one, color and flavor each portion to  fancy, then run the boil in the moulds; when set put them on clean slab,  sprinkle some cold water over them and roll them about until all are  damped, then cover them with fine crystal sugar and mix them up till  crystalized all over, and spread them out on trays to dry.    The different recipes already given will give the reader a general idea  how gelatine goods are made. By using different colors, flavors and  shapes an infinite variety can be produced. It would serve no good  purpose to further multiply these formulas for small goods.      JAM ROLEY POLEY.      10 lbs. White Sugar.    5 lbs. Glucose.    2 lbs Gelatine.    Carmine Color.    1 lb. Raspberry Jam.    1 lb. Desiccated Cocoanut.    3 pints Water.    PROCESS.--Soak the gelatine in cold water for twelve hours; boil the  sugar, glucose and water sharply to stiff ball; remove the pan from the  fire, stir in the gelatine, stand aside till scum rises and skim it off;  divide the boil into two portions, (mix together 1 oz. tartaric acid, 1  oz. carbonate of soda, 2 oz. icing sugar); drop this powder and the  desiccated cocoanut into one half of the boil and stir briskly until the  whole rises in a white foam, then run out into tins, on sheet about 1/4  inch thick; now take the other half, color bright red, adding the  raspberry jam; stir till thoroughly mixed and run this on top of the  white sheet about the same thickness; when cold and hard, take out the  sheets and make a roll of each.    N.B.--Let the red portion be cool when run over the white, as the white  being lighter will come to the top if disturbed by the mixture being too  hot.      RASPBERRY JELLIES.      9 lbs. White Sugar.    6 lbs. Glucose.    2 lbs. Apple Jelly.    2-1/4 lbs. Gelatine.    3 pints Water.    2 oz. Tartaric Acid.    1/2 oz. Essence Raspberry.    Carmine Color.    PROCESS.--Soak the gelatine as usual; boil the sugar, glucose and water  to a stiff ball; remove the pan from the fire; stir in the gelatine and  let it remain till scum rises; skim it off, then add jelly, acid and  flavor and sufficient color to make a bright red: now mould the batch  into Raspberry shapes and put them in a cold place. When set stiff, put  the goods in thin layers in a crystalizing tin and cover them with cold  syrup. Let them remain undisturbed for twelve hours, then drain off all  the surplus syrup and turn the raspberries on clean trays; when dry,  pack.    N.B.--When putting jelly goods in tins, be careful that the layers are  not thick, as they lay so close that the syrup cannot get in between  them. A good plan is to have wire trays and fix three or four loosely in  each tin, taking their bearings on the ends of the crystalizing tin. By  this means you will get more in a tin with better result. Boil the syrup  in the proportion of six pounds best white sugar to each quart water, to  the degree of smooth 215. It must be quite cold when used for gelatine  work or the goods will come out of the tins in a solid block.      BLACK CURRANT JELLIES.      9 lbs. White Sugar.    6 lbs. Glucose.    2-1/4 lbs. Gelatine.    Purple Coloring.    3 pints Water.    2 oz. Tartaric Acid.    2 lbs. Black Currant Jelly.

Then another  prairie wolf howled and another, and I could make out that they were  gathering in the neighborhood. There I lay prone and helpless, wondering  if it would not be strictly just that they should come and tear me to  pieces. I heard them calling for a long time before I realized that  dim, shadowy forms were sneaking near. The horse saw them first, and his  terrified snort drove them back at first, but they came nearer next  time and sat around me on the prairie. Soon one bolder than the others  crawled up and tugged at the body of his dead relative. I shouted and he  retreated growling. The pony ran to a distance in terror. Presently  the wolf returned, and after after two or three of these retreats and  returns, the body was dragged off and devoured by the rest in a few  minutes.    After this they gathered nearer and sat on their haunches to look at  me, and the boldest one smelt the rifle and scratched dirt on it.  He retreated when I kicked at him with my free foot and shouted, but  growing bolder as I grew weaker he came and snarled right in my face.  At this several others snarled and came up closer, and I realized that I  was to be devoured by the foe that I most despised; when suddenly out  of the gloom with a guttural roar sprang a great black wolf. The prairie  wolves scattered like chaff except the bold one, which, seized by the  black new-comer, was in a few moments a draggled corpse, and then, oh  horrors! this mighty brute bounded at me and--Bingo--noble Bingo, rubbed  his shaggy, panting sides against me and licked my cold face.    \"Bingo--Bing--old--boy--Fetch me the trap wrench!\" Away he went and  returned dragging the rifle, for he knew only that I wanted something.    \"No--Bing--the trap-wrench.\" This time it was my sash, but at last  he brought the wrench and wagged his tail in joy that it was right.  Reaching out with my free hand, after much difficulty I unscrewed the  pillar-nut. The trap fell apart and my hand was released, and a minute  later I was free. Bing brought the pony up, and after slowly walking to  restore the circulation I was able to mount. Then slowly at first but  soon at a gallop, with Bingo as herald careering and barking ahead, we  set out for home, there to learn that the night before, though never  taken on the trapping rounds, the brave dog had acted strangely,  whimpering and watching the timber-trail; and at last when night came  on, in spite of attempts to detain him he had set out in the gloom and  guided by a knowledge that is beyond us had reached the spot in time to  avenge me as well as set me free.    Staunch old Bing--he was a strange dog. Though his heart was with me,  he passed me next day with scarcely a look, but responded with alacrity  when little Gordon called him to a gopher-hunt. And it was so to the  end; and to the end also he lived the wolfish life that he loved, and  never failed to seek the winter-killed horses and found one again with  a poisoned bait, and wolfishly bolted that; then feeling the pang, set  out, not for Wright's but to find me, and reached the door of my shanty  where I should have been. Next day on returning I found him dead in the  snow with his head on the sill of the door--the door of his puppyhood's  days; my dog to the last in his heart of hearts--it was my help he  sought, and vainly sought, in the hour of his bitter extremity.          THE SPRINGFIELD FOX    I    THE HENS had been mysteriously disappearing for over a month; and when I  came home to Springfield for the summer holidays it was my duty to find  the cause. This was soon done. The fowls were carried away bodily one  at a time, before going to roost or else after leaving, which put tramps  and neighbors out of court; they were not taken from the high perches,  which cleared all coons and owls; or left partly eaten, so that weasels,  skunks, or minks were not the guilty ones, and the blame, therefore, was  surely left at Reynard's door.    The great pine wood of Erindale was on the other bank of the river, and  on looking carefully about the lower ford I saw a few fox-tracks and a  barred feather from one of our Plymouth Rock chickens. On climbing the  farther bank in search of more clews, I heard a great outcry of crows  behind me, and turning, saw a number of these birds darting down at  something in the ford. A better view showed that it was the old story,  thief catch thief, for there in the middle of the ford was a fox with  something in his jaws--he was returning from our barnyard with another  hen. The crows, though shameless robbers themselves, are ever first to  cry 'Stop thief,' and yet more than ready to take 'hush-money' in the  form of a share in the plunder.    And this was their game now. The fox to get back home must cross the  river, where he was exposed to the full brunt of the crow mob. He made a  dash for it, and would doubtless have gotten across with his booty had I  not joined in the attack, whereupon he dropped the hen, scarce dead, and  disappeared in the woods.    This large and regular levy of provisions wholly carried off could mean  but one thing, a family of little foxes at home; and to find them I now  was bound.    That evening I went with Ranger, my hound, across the river into the  Erindale woods. As soon as the hound began to circle, we heard the  short, sharp bark of a fox from a thickly wooded ravine close by.  Ranger dashed in at once, struck a hot scent and went off on a lively  straight-away till his voice was lost in the distance away over the  upland.    After nearly an hour he came back, panting and warm, for it was baking  August weather, and lay down at my feet.    But almost immediately the same foxy 'Yap yurrr' was heard close at hand  and off dashed the dog on another chase.    Away he went in the darkness, baying like a foghorn, straight away to  the north. And the loud 'Boo, boo,' became a low 'oo, oo,' and that a  feeble 'o-o' and then was lost. They must have gone some miles away, for  even with ear to the ground I heard nothing of them though a mile was  easy distance for Ranger's brazen voice.    As I waited in the black woods I heard a sweet sound of dripping water:  'Tink tank tenk tink, Ta tink tank tenk tonk.'    I did not know of any spring so near, and in the hot night it was a glad  find. But the sound led me to the bough of a oak-tree, where I found its  source. Such a soft sweet song; full of delightful suggestion on such a  night:         Tonk tank tenk tink       Ta tink a tonk a tank a tink a       Ta ta tink tank ta ta tonk tink       Drink a tank a drink a drunk.    It was the 'water-dripping' song of the saw-whet owl.    But suddenly a deep raucous breathing and a rustle of leaves showed that  Ranger was back. He was completely fagged out. His tongue hung almost  to the ground and was dripping with foam, his flanks were heaving and  spume-flecks dribbled from his breast and sides. He stopped panting a  moment to give my hand a dutiful lick, then flung himself flop on the  leaves to drown all other sounds with his noisy panting.    But again that tantilizing 'Yap yurrr' was heard a few feet away, and  the meaning of it all dawned on me. We were close to the den where the  little foxes were, and the old ones were taking turns in trying to lead  us away.    It was late night now, so we went home feeling sure that the problem was  nearly solved.    II    It was well known that there was an old fox with his family living in  the neighborhood, but no one supposed them so near.    This fox had been called 'Scarface,' because of a scar reaching from his  eye through and back of his ear; this was supposed to have been given  him by a barbed-wire fence during a rabbit hunt, and as the hair came in  white after it healed it was always a strong mark.    The winter before I had met with him and had had a sample of his  craftiness. I was out shooting, after a fall of snow, and had crossed  the open fields to the edge of the brushy hollow back of the old mill.  As my head rose to a view of the hollow I caught sight of a fox trotting  at long range down the other side, in line to cross my course. Instantly  I held motionless, and did not even lower or turn my head lest I should  catch his eye by moving, until he went on out of sight in the thick  cover at the bottom. As soon as he was hidden I bobbed down and ran to  head him off where he should leave the cover on the other side, and  was there in good time awaiting, but no fox came forth. A careful look  showed the fresh track of a fox that had bounded from the cover, and  following it with my eye I saw old Scarface himself far out of range  behind me, sitting on his haunches and grinning as though much amused.    A study of the trail made all clear. He had seen me at the moment I saw  him, but he, also like a true hunter, had concealed the fact, putting  on an air of unconcern till out of sight, when he had run for his life  around behind me and amused himself by watching my still-born trick.    In the springtime I had yet another instance of Scarface's cunning.  I was walking with a friend along the road over the high pasture. We  passed within thirty feet of a ridge on which were several gray and  brown boulders. When at the nearest point my friend said:    \"Stone number three looks to me very much like a fox curled up.\"    But I could not see it, and we passed. We had not gone many yards  farther when the wind blew on this boulder as on fur.    My friend said, \"I am sure that is a fox, lying asleep.\"    \"We'll soon settle that,\" I replied, and turned back, but as soon as I  had taken one step from the road, up jumped Scarface, for it was he, and  ran. A fire had swept the middle of the pasture, leaving a broad belt  of black; over this he scurried till he came to the unburnt yellow grass  again, where he squatted down and was lost to view. He had been watching  us"]]]
