The  Kenyah tribe also comprises a number of named branches, though these  are less clearly defined than the sub-tribes of the Kayan people. Each  branch is generally named after the river on the banks of which its  villages are situated, or were situated at some comparatively recent  time of which the memory is preserved. In many cases a single village  adopts the name of some tributary stream near the mouth of which it  is situated, and the people speak of themselves by this name. Thus it  seems clear that the named branches of the Kenyah tribe are nothing  more than local groups formed in the course of the periodical  migrations, and named after the localities they have occupied.[39]    The foregoing description of the relations of a Kayan chief to  his people applies in the main to the Kenyah chief. But among the  Kenyahs the position of the chief is one of greater authority and  consideration than among the Kayans. The people voluntarily work for  their chief both in his private and public capacities, obeying his  commands cheerfully, and accepting his decisions with more deference  than is accorded by the Kayans. The chief in return shows himself  more generous and paternal towards his people, interesting himself  more intimately in their individual affairs. Hence the Kenyah chief  stands out more prominently as leader and representative of his people,  and the cohesion of the whole community is stronger. The chief owes his  great influence over his people in large measure to his training, for,  while still a youth, the son or the nephew of a chief is accustomed  to responsibility by being sent in charge of small bodies of followers  upon missions to distant villages, to gather or convey information, or  to investigate disturbing rumours. He is also frequently called upon to  speak on public occasions, and thus early becomes a practised orator.    Among Klemantans, Muruts, and Sea Dayaks each house recognises a  headman or chief; but he has little authority (more perhaps among the  first of these peoples than among the other two). He acts as arbitrator  in household disputes, but in too many cases his impartiality is not  above suspicion, save where custom rigidly limits his preference.    Among both Kayans and Kenyahs three social strata are clearly  distinguishable and are recognised by the people themselves in each  village. The upper class is constituted by the family of the chief  and his near relatives, his aunts and uncles, brothers, sisters, and  cousins, and their children. These upper-class families are generally  in easier circumstances than the others, thanks to the possession  of property such as brass ware, valuable beads, caves in which the  swift builds its edible nest, slaves, and a supply of all the other  material possessions larger in quantity and superior in quality to  those of the middle- and lower-class families.    The man of the upper class can generally be distinguished at a glance  by his superior bearing and manners, by the neatness and cleanliness  of his person, his more valuable weapons, and personal ornaments,  as well as by greater regularity of features. The woman of the  upper class also exhibits to the eye similar marks of her superior  birth and breeding. The tatuing of her skin is more finely executed,  greater care is taken with the elongation of the lobe of the ear,  so that the social status of the woman is indicated by the length  of the lobe. Her dress and person are cleaner, and generally better  cared for, and her skin is fairer than that of other women, owing no  doubt to her having been less exposed to the sun.    The men of the upper class work in the PADI-fields and bear their share  of all the labours of the village; but they are able to cultivate  larger areas than others owing to their possession of slaves, who,  although they are expected to grow a supply of PADI for their own  use, assist in the cultivation of their master's fields. For the  upper-class women, also, the labours of the field and the house are  rendered less severe by the assistance of female slaves, although  they bear a part both in the weeding of the fields, in the harvesting,  and in the preparation of food in the house.    The chief's room, which is usually about twice as long as others, is  usually in the middle of the house; and those of the other upper-class  families, which also may be larger than the other rooms, adjoin it  on either side.    In all social gatherings, and in the performance of public rites and  ceremonies, the men of the upper class are accorded leading parts,  and they usually group themselves about the chief. Social intercourse  is freer and more intimate among the people of the upper class than  between them and the rest of the household.    The upper class is relatively more numerous in the Kenyah than in the  Kayan houses, and more clearly distinguishable by address and bearing.    The middle class comprises the majority of the people of a house in  most cases. They may enjoy all the forms of property, though generally  their possessions are of smaller extent and value, and they seldom  possess slaves. Their voices carry less weight in public affairs;  but among this class are generally a few men of exceptional capacity  or experience whose advice and co-operation are specially valued  by the chief. Among this class, too, are usually a few men in each  house on whom devolve, often hereditarily, special duties implying  special skill or knowledge, E.G. the working of iron at the forge,  the making of boats, the catching of souls, the finding of camphor,  the observation and determination of the seasons. All such special  occupations are sources of profit, though only the last of these  enables a man to dispense with the cultivation of PADI.    The lower class is made up of slaves captured in war and of their  descendants, and for this reason its members are of very varied  physical type. An unmarried slave of either sex lives with, and is  treated almost as a member of, the family of his or her master,  eating and in some cases sleeping in the family room. Slaves are  allowed to marry, their children becoming the property of their  masters. Some slave-families are allowed to acquire a room in the  house, and they then begin to acquire a less dependent position; and  though they still retain the status of slaves, and are spoken of as  \"slaves-outside-the-room,\" the master generally finds it impossible  to command their services beyond a very limited extent, and in some  cases will voluntarily resign his rights over the family. But in this  case the family continues to belong to the lower class.    The members of each of these classes marry in nearly all cases within  their own class. The marriages of the young people of the upper  class are carefully regulated. Although they are allowed to choose  their partners according to the inscrutable dictates of personal  affinities, their choice is limited by their elders and the authority  of the chief. Many of them marry members of neighbouring villages,  while the other classes marry within their own village.    A youth of the upper class, becoming fond of some girl of the  middle class, and not being allowed to marry her (although this is  occasionally permitted), will live with her for a year or two. Then,  when the time for his marriage arrives (it having perhaps been  postponed for some years after being arranged, owing to evil omens,  or to lack of means or of house accommodation), he may separate from  his mistress, leaving in her care any children born of their union,  and perhaps making over to her some property -- as public opinion  demands in such cases. She may and usually will marry subsequently  a man of her own class, but the children born of her irregular  union may claim and may be accorded some of the privileges of their  father's class. In this way there is formed in most villages a class  of persons of ambiguous status, debarred from full membership in the  upper class by the bar-sinister. Such persons tend to become wholly  identified with the upper or middle class according to the degrees  of their personal merits.    Marriages are sometimes contracted between persons of the middle and  slave classes. In the case of a young man marrying a slave woman,  the owners of the woman will endeavour to persuade him to live with  her in their room, when he becomes a subordinate member of their  household. If they succeed in this they will claim as their property  half the children born to the couple. On the other hand, if the man  insists on establishing himself in possession of a room, he may succeed  in practically emancipating his wife, perhaps making some compensation  to her owners in the shape of personal services or brass ware. In this  case the children of the couple would be regarded as freeborn. It is  generally possible for an energetic slave to buy his freedom.    Less frequent is the marriage of a slave man with a free woman of the  middle class. In this case the man will generally manage to secure  his emancipation and to establish himself as master of a room, and to  merge himself in the middle class. In the case of marriage between two  slaves, they continue to live in the rooms of their owners, spending  by arrangement periods of two or three years alternately as members  of the two households. The children born of such a slave-couple are  divided as they grow up between the owners of their parents.    On the whole the slaves are treated with so much kindness and  consideration that they have little to complain of, and most of them  seem to have little desire to be freed. A capable slave may become  the confidant and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3310"],[0,"A Forgotten Empire (Vijayanagar): A Contribution to the History of India (#14)"],[1," chase, and three hawks, which the Carnatickehs were till  then strangers to the use of. He then marched from the environs of  Beejanuggur, and on his arrival on the bank of the Kistnah dismissed  the roy's son and returned to Koolburga.\"    To form some idea of the date of this cessation of hostilities we must  see what follows in Firishtah's narrative. The historian states that  during the year of the Sultan's return to Kulbarga there was a grievous  famine in the Dakhan, and \"the next year also, no rain appearing,  the people became seditious.\" These two years were probably A.H. 826,  827, extending from 15th December A.D. 1422 to 23rd November 1424. He  continues, \"In the year 828\" the Sultan marched against Warangal. The  last campaign began about December A.D. 1422; and since we must allow  some months for Ahmad's blockade of Vijayanagar, which resulted in his  reducing the inhabitants to a state of starvation so that the Raya  was compelled to capitulate, the date for the end of the war cannot  be safely placed earlier than the winter of the year A.D. 1423. During  these twelve months, however, there was a famine and failure of rain,  so that the Sultan may have been able to traverse the cotton plains  lying between Vijayanagar and Kulbarga, plains quite impassable for  troops in wet weather, somewhat earlier than would otherwise have  been the case.    The Sultan's next war took place in A.H. 828, when he advanced against  Warangal over the undulating plains of the Dakhan, then rich in crop,  and was completely successful. The Hindu kingdom was completely and  for ever destroyed. The English date usually given for this event  is A.D. 1424, but it is quite possible that a mistake has been  made owing to the use of imperfect chronological tables by those  who have written on the subject, and that Ahmad Shah's capture of  Warangal may have taken place in A.D. 1425. Briggs, for instance,  calls A.H. 828 \"A.D. 1424,\" but the year only began on November  23, 1424. The campaign, however, was very short, and may have been  concluded before the end of December of that year.    We hear nothing more from Firishtah regarding the affairs of  Vijayanagar till the early part of the reign of Ahmad's son and  successor, Ala-ud-din II., which began on Sunday, February 27,  A.D. 1435,[110] the day of Sultan Ahmad's death.    Ala-ud-din's first act was to despatch his brother Muhammad Khan with  a powerful army against Deva Raya of Vijayanagar --    \"who had withheld his tribute for five years and refused to pay the  arrears. They laid waste the country in such a manner that the Roy  in a short time was glad to procure peace by giving twenty elephants,  a great sum of money, and two hundred female slaves skilled in music  and dancing, besides a valuable present to Mahummud Khan.\"    Flushed with this victory, and in command of a large force, Prince  Muhammad rebelled against his brother, and Firishtah states that  in doing so he obtained aid from Deva Raya. The prince took Mudkal,  Raichur, Sholapur, Bijapur, and Naldirak from the Sultan's governors,  but in a pitched battle with the royal forces was completely defeated  and fled. Shortly afterwards, however, he was forgiven by his generous  sovereign, and the fortress and territories of Raichur were conferred  on him.    About the year 1442 Deva Raya began to consider more seriously his  situation in relation to his powerful neighbour at Kulbarga.    \"He called[111] a general council of his nobility and principal  bramins, observing to them that as his country of Carnatic in extent,  population, and revenue far exceeded the territories of the house  of Bahmenee; land in like manner his army was far more numerous,  wished therefore to explore the cause of the mussulmauns' successes,  and his being reduced to pay them tribute. Some said ... that the  superiority of the mussulmauns arose from two circumstances: one,  all their horses being strong, and able to bear more fatigue than the  weak, lean animals of Carnatic; the other, a great body of excellent  archers always kept up by the sultans of the house of Bahmenee,  of whom the roy had but few in his army.    \"Deo Roy upon this gave orders for the entertainment of mussulmauns  in his service, allotted them jaghires,[112] erected a mosque  for their use in the city of Beejanuggur, and commanded that no  one should molest them in the exercise of their religion. He also  ordered a koraun to be placed before his throne, on a rich desk,  that the mussulmauns might perform the ceremony of obeisance in his  presence, without sinning against their laws. He also made all the  Hindoo soldiers learn the discipline of the bow; in which he and his  officers used such exertions, that he had at length two thousand  mussulmauns and sixty thousand Hindoos, well skilled in archery,  besides eighty thousand horse and two hundred thousand foot, armed  in the usual manner with pikes and lances.\"    On a day which must have been between November 1442 and April 1443 a  desperate attempt was made on the life of King Deva Raya by one of his  closest relatives -- a brother, according to Abdur Razzak, a nephew,  according to Nuniz. Abdur Razzak's story is without doubt the more  reliable of the two, since he is a contemporary witness. The story as  told by Nuniz is given in the chronicle at the end of this volume.[113]  Abdur Razzak was ambassador from Persia to Calicut and Vijayanagar, and  his account is particularly important as it definitely fixes the date.    \"During the time that the author of this narrative was still sojourning  at Calicut (November 1442 to April 1443) there happened in the city  of Bidjanagar an extraordinary and most singular occurrence....    \"The king's brother, who had had a new house built for himself, invited  thither the monarch and the principal personages of the empire. Now it  is an established usage of the infidels never to eat in presence of  each other. The men who were invited were assembled together in one  grand hall. At short intervals the prince either came in person or  sent some messenger to say that such or such great personage should  come and eat his part of the banquet. Care had been taken to bring  together all the drums, kettledrums, trumpets, and flutes that could  be found in the city, and these instruments playing all at the same  time, made a tremendous uproar. As soon as the individual who had been  sent for entered the above-mentioned house, two assassins, placed in  ambush, sprang out upon him, pierced him with a poignard, and cut him  in pieces. After having removed his limbs, or rather the fragments of  his body, they sent for another guest, who, once having entered this  place of carnage, disappeared.... In consequence of the noise of the  drums, the clamour, and the tumult, no one was aware of what was going  on. In this manner all those who had any name or rank in the state were  slaughtered. The prince leaving his house all reeking with the blood  of his victims, betook himself to the king's palace, and addressing  himself to the guards who were stationed in that royal residence,  invited them with flattering words to go to his house, and caused them  to follow the steps of the other-victims. So that the palace was thus  deprived of all its defenders. This villain then entered into the  king's presence, holding in his hand a dish covered with betel-nut,  under which was concealed a brilliant poignard. He said to the monarch,  'The hall is ready and they only wait your august presence.'    \"The king, following the maxim which declares that eminent men  receive an inspiration from heaven, said to him, 'I am not in good  health to-day.'    \"This unnatural brother, thus losing the hope of enticing the king  to his house, drew his poignard, and struck him therewith several  violent blows, so that the prince fell at the back of his throne. The  traitor, thus believing that the king was dead, left there one of  his confidants to cut off the monarch's head; then going out of the  hall he ascended the portico of the palace, and thus addressed the  people: 'I have slain the king, his brothers, and such and such emirs,  Brahmins, and viziers; now I am king.'    \"Meanwhile his emissary had approached the throne with the intention of  cutting off the king's head, but that prince, seizing the seat behind  which he had fallen, struck the wretch with it with so much violence  on the chest that he fell upon his back. The king then, with the help  of one of his guards, who at the sight of this horrible transaction  had hidden himself in a corner, slew this assassin, and went out of  the palace by way of the harem.    \"His brother, still standing on the steps of the hall of council,  invited the multitude to recognise him as their king. At that moment  the monarch cried out, 'I am alive. I am well and safe. Seize that  wretch.'    \"The whole crowd assembled together threw themselves upon the guilty  prince and put him to death.    \"The only one who escaped was Danaik, the vizier, who previously to  this sad event had gone on a voyage to the frontier of Ceylon. The  king sent a courier to him to invite him to return, and informed  him of what had just occurred. All those who had in any way aided in  the conspiracy were put to death. Men in great numbers were slain,  flayed, burnt alive, and their families entirely exterminated. The  man who had brought the letters of invitation was put to the last  degree of torture....\"    Nuniz states that the king died six months later and was succeeded by  his son, but Abdur Razzak declares that he was presented in person to  Deva Raya about the month of December 1443. The name of Deva Raya's  son is not given by Nuniz, nor yet the length of his reign; he only  states that he did nothing worth relating except to give enormous  charities to temples. This king again was succeeded by a son called  \"Verupaca Rao,\" who must be identical with Virupaksha, and Nuniz  dates "]]]
