DENVY.[150]    After leaving the town of Surat, at ten leagues along the coast to  the south, there is place called Denvy, of Moors and Gentiles, also  of great trade, where many merchant ships from Malabar and many  other parts always take in cargo.      BAXAY.    Having passed this town of Dendi, twenty leagues further on to the  south[151] is another town of Moors and Gentiles, a good seaport,  which also belongs to the King of Guzarat, in which much goods are  exchanged; and there is a great movement of the shipping which comes  there from all parts, and many Zambucs from the Malabar country  laden with areca, cocoas, and spices, which they delight in, and  they take thence others which are used in Malabar.      TANAMAYAMBU.    Twenty-five leagues further on the coast is a fortress of the before  named king, called Tanamayambu, and near it is a Moorish town, very  pleasant, with many gardens, and very fertile--a town of very great  Moorish mosques, and temples of worship of the Gentiles. It is  nearly at the extremity of the kingdom of Cambay or Guzarat, and it  is likewise a seaport, but of little trade. And there are in this  port small vessels of rovers like watch boats, which go out to sea,  and if they meet with any small ship less strong than themselves,  they capture and plunder it, and sometimes kill their crews.      KINGDOM OF DACANI.    On coming out of this kingdom of Guzarat and Cambay, towards the  south and the inner parts of India, is the kingdom of Dacani, which  the Indians call Decani. The king is a Moor, and a large part of his  people is Gentile. He is a great lord, and possesses many subjects  and an extensive territory, which stretches far inland. It has very  good seaports, of great trade in the goods used on the mainland, and  they are the following places:      CHEUL.    Leaving the kingdom of Cambay, along the coast towards the south, at  eight leagues distance, there is a fine large river, and on it is a  place called Cheul,[152] not very large, of handsome houses, which  are all covered with thatch. This place is one of great commerce in  merchandise, and in the months of December, January, February and  March there are many ships from the Malabar country and all other  parts, which arrive with cargoes. That is to say, those of Malabar  laden with cocoa nuts, arecas, spices, drugs, palm sugar, emery, and  there they make their sales for the continent and for the kingdom of  Cambay; and the ships of Cambay come there to meet them laden with  cotton stuffs, and many other goods which are available in Malabar,  and these are bartered for the goods which have come from the  Malabar country. And on the return voyage they fill their ships with  wheat, vegetables, millet, rice, sesame, oil of sesame, of which  there is much in this country; and these Malabars also buy many  pieces of fine muslin[153] for women's head dress, and many  beyranies, of which there are plenty in this kingdom. A large  quantity of copper is sold in this port of Cheul, and at a high  price, for it is worth twenty ducats the hundred weight, or more,  because in the interior money is made of it, and it is also used  throughout the country for cooking pots. There is also a great  consumption in this place of quicksilver and vermilion for the  interior, and for the kingdom of Guzarat, which copper, quicksilver  and vermilion is brought to this place by the Malabar merchants, who  get it from the factories of the King of Portugal; and they get more  of it by way of the Mekkah, which comes there from Diu. These people  wear the beyranies put on for a few days nearly in the raw state,  and afterwards they bleach them and make them very white, and gum  them to sell them abroad, and thus some are met with amongst them  which are torn. In this port of Chaul there are few inhabitants,  except during three or four months of the year, the time for putting  in cargo, when there arrive merchants from all the neighbourhood,  and they make their bargains during this period, and despatch their  goods, and after that return to their homes until the next season,  so that this place is like a fair in those months. There is a  Moorish gentleman as governor of this place, who is a vassal of the  King of Decani, and collects his revenues, and accounts to him for  them. He is called Xech, and does great service to the King of  Portugal, and is a great friend of the Portuguese, and treats very  well all those that go there, and keeps the country very secure. In  this place there is always a Portuguese factor appointed by the  captain and factor of Goa, in order to send from this place  provisions and other necessaries, to the city of Goa, and to the  Portuguese fleets; and at a distance of about a league inland from  Cheul is a place where the Moors and Gentiles of the cities and  towns throughout the country come to set up their shops of goods and  cloths at Cheul during the before-mentioned months; they bring these  in great caravans of domestic oxen, with packs like donkeys, and on  the top of these long white sacks placed crosswise, in which they  bring their goods; and one man drives thirty or forty beasts before  him.      DAMDA.    Having passed this place, Cheul, at twelve leagues further on along  the coast to the south towards Malabar is another town and seaport,  also belonging to the kingdom of Dacani, called Damda; where there  enter and go out many Moorish ships, both Guzaratis and Malabaris,  with cloth and other goods, as at Cheul.      MANDABAD.    Five leagues further on is a river called Mandabad, on which is a  town of Moors and Gentiles, of the same kingdom of Decani; likewise  a seaport. Many ships from various parts congregate at this harbour  to buy stuffs, particularly from the Malabar country. And they bring  there many cocoa-nuts, arecas, and also a few spices, copper and  quicksilver: for the merchants of the country buy all these goods.      DABUL.    Having left this place, Mandabad, and going along the coast to  Malabar and the south, at eight leagues distance is another fine  large river, at the mouth of which is a large town of Moors and  Gentiles, belonging to the same kingdom of Decani. It is called  Dabul,[154] and in the mouth of the river near this same town there  is a rampart, with artillery to defend the entrance of the river.  This town of Dabul has a very good harbour, where there always  congregate many Moorish ships from various parts, and especially  from Mekkah, Aden, and Ormuz with horses, and from Cambay, Diu, and  the Malabar country. It is a place of very great trade in all sorts  of merchandise; there are in it very respectable Moors and Gentiles,  and Guzarati merchants. Much copper, quicksilver, and vermilion is  sold here for the interior of the country: a great quantity of  country fabrics are brought to this town down the river for  embarcation in the ships, and also much wheat and vegetables of all  sorts. The custom-house of this port produces much money, and the  collectors take the dues there for the lord of the town. And this  town is pretty and well situated, but its houses are covered with  thatch, and it also has very beautiful mosques. Higher up this  river, on either bank there are many pretty towns, plentifully  supplied, and owning much cultivated land and flocks. A fleet of the  King of Portugal arrived at this city, of which the viceroy was the  captain, and landed his people on the shore for the purpose of  taking and destroying this town.[155] And the Moors put themselves  on the defensive, and fought very courageously with the Portuguese.  In the fight many Moors and Gentiles died, and at last the  Portuguese took this city by assault, making a great slaughter of  the inhabitants, and plundering and burning the city, in which much  wealth and merchandise were burned, and at the same time several  ships which were lying in the river. And those who escaped thence  returned later to restore this city, so that now it is already  inhabited as before.      SINGUYCAR.    Ten leagues further on from this river, along the coast southwards,  is another river called Singuycar, upon which is a town of much  commerce and merchandise. And many ships from divers parts put in  there; and it is a town of Moors and Gentiles, and belongs to the  kingdom of Dacani.      RIVER DOBETALA.    Twelve leagues further along the coast, to the south, is another  river called Dobetela; and there are along its course several small  places, with very pretty gardens and orchards, where they gather a  great quantity of betel; this is a leaf which they eat, and it is  put on board small vessels, and carried away for sale in other towns  and seaports. We call this betel Indian leaf, and it is as large as  a leaf of the plantain,[156] and about of the same pattern; and it  grows like ivy, and climbs up other trees by means of poles placed  for that purpose: it does not give any fruit or seed. It is a very  favourite leaf, and all the Indians both men and women eat it both  day and night in their houses, in the streets, and on the road, and  in their beds. They always go about eating this leaf, which they mix  with some small fruits called arecas, and the leaf is smeared with  moistened lime, which is made with sea-shells, and the shells of  oysters and mussels. And these three things being added together,  they eat this betel, not swallowing more than the juice; and it  colours the mouth and makes the teeth brown: and they say that it is  good for drying and purging the stomach, and for preserving the  brain, and it drives out flatulence, and quenches thirst: so that it  is very much esteemed among all Indians, and in general use from  this place further on throughout India. There are great quantities  of it, and it is one of the principal revenues which the kings of  the country possess. The Moors and Arabs and Persians call it  tanbul.

Why do I miss these good things?\"        CHAPTER XII    SOME EMOTIONS AND YELLOW LUPIN    The fame which came to me through that gallant rescue was a little  embarrassing. I was a marked man. Did I walk through the village, heads  emerged from windows, and eyes followed me out of sight. Did I sit on  the beach, groups formed behind me and watched in silent admiration. I  was the man of the moment.    \"If we'd wanted an advertisement for the farm,\" said Ukridge on one of  these occasions, \"we couldn't have had a better one than you, Garny, my  boy. You have brought us three distinct orders for eggs during the last  week. And I'll tell you what it is, we need all the orders we can get  that'll bring us in ready money. The farm is in a critical condition.  The coffers are low, deuced low. And I'll tell you another thing. I'm  getting precious tired of living on nothing but chicken and eggs. So's  Millie, though she doesn't say so.\"    \"So am I,\" I said, \"and I don't feel like imitating your wife's proud  reserve. I never want to see a chicken again. As for eggs, they are far  too much for us.\"    For the last week monotony had been the keynote of our commissariat. We  had had cold chicken and eggs for breakfast, boiled chicken and eggs  for lunch, and roast chicken and eggs for dinner. Meals became a  nuisance, and Mrs. Beale complained bitterly that we did not give her a  chance. She was a cook who would have graced an alderman's house and  served up noble dinners for gourmets, and here she was in this remote  corner of the world ringing the changes on boiled chicken and roast  chicken and boiled eggs and poached eggs. Mr. Whistler, set to paint  sign-boards for public-houses, might have felt the same restless  discontent. As for her husband, the Hired Retainer, he took life as  tranquilly as ever, and seemed to regard the whole thing as the most  exhilarating farce he had ever been in. I think he looked on Ukridge as  an amiable lunatic, and was content to rough it a little in order to  enjoy the privilege of observing his movements. He made no complaints  of the food. When a man has supported life for a number of years on  incessant Army beef, the monotony of daily chicken and eggs scarcely  strikes him.    \"The fact is,\" said Ukridge, \"these tradesmen round here seem to be a  sordid, suspicious lot. They clamour for money.\"    He mentioned a few examples. Vickers, the butcher, had been the first  to strike, with the remark that he would like to see the colour of Mr.  Ukridge's money before supplying further joints. Dawlish, the grocer,  had expressed almost exactly similar sentiments two days later; and the  ranks of these passive resisters had been receiving fresh recruits ever  since. To a man the tradesmen of Combe Regis seemed as deficient in  Simple Faith as they were in Norman Blood.    \"Can't you pay some of them a little on account?\" I suggested. \"It  would set them going again.\"    \"My dear old man,\" said Ukridge impressively, \"we need every penny of  ready money we can raise for the farm. The place simply eats money.  That infernal roop let us in for I don't know what.\"    That insidious epidemic had indeed proved costly. We had painted the  throats of the chickens with the best turpentine--at least Ukridge and  Beale had,--but in spite of their efforts, dozens had died, and we had  been obliged to sink much more money than was pleasant in restocking  the run. The battle which took place on the first day after the  election of the new members was a sight to remember. The results of it  were still noticeable in the depressed aspect of certain of the  recently enrolled.    \"No,\" said Ukridge, summing up, \"these men must wait. We can't help  their troubles. Why, good gracious, it isn't as if they'd been waiting  for the money long. We've not been down here much over a month. I never  heard of such a scandalous thing. 'Pon my word, I've a good mind to go  round, and have a straight talk with one or two of them. I come and  settle down here, and stimulate trade, and give them large orders, and  they worry me with bills when they know I'm up to my eyes in work,  looking after the fowls. One can't attend to everything. The business  is just now at its most crucial point. It would be fatal to pay any  attention to anything else with things as they are. These scoundrels  will get paid all in good time.\"    It is a peculiarity of situations of this kind that the ideas of debtor  and creditor as to what constitutes a good time never coincide.     * * * * *    I am afraid that, despite the urgent need for strict attention to  business, I was inclined to neglect my duties about this time. I had  got into the habit of wandering off, either to the links, where I  generally found the professor, sometimes Phyllis, or on long walks by  myself. There was one particular walk along the cliffs, through some of  the most beautiful scenery I have ever set eyes on, which more than any  other suited my mood. I would work my way through the woods till I came  to a small clearing on the very edge of the cliff. There I would sit  and smoke by the hour. If ever I am stricken with smoker's heart, or  staggers, or tobacco amblyopia, or any other of the cheery things which  doctors predict for the devotee of the weed, I shall feel that I sowed  the seeds of it that summer in that little clearing overlooking the  sea. A man in love needs much tobacco. A man thinking out a novel needs  much tobacco. I was in the grip of both maladies. Somehow I found that  my ideas flowed more readily in that spot than in any other.    I had not been inside the professor's grounds since the occasion when I  had gone in through the box-wood hedge. But on the afternoon following  my financial conversation with Ukridge I made my way thither, after a  toilet which, from its length, should have produced better results than  it did. Not for four whole days had I caught so much as a glimpse of  Phyllis. I had been to the links three times, and had met the professor  twice, but on both occasions she had been absent. I had not had the  courage to ask after her. I had an absurd idea that my voice or my  manner would betray me in some way. I felt that I should have put the  question with such an exaggerated show of indifference that all would  have been discovered.    The professor was not at home. Nor was Mr. Chase. Nor was Miss Norah  Derrick, the lady I had met on the beach with the professor. Miss  Phyllis, said the maid, was in the garden.    I went into the garden. She was sitting under the cedar by the  tennis-lawn, reading. She looked up as I approached.    I said it was a lovely afternoon. After which there was a lull in the  conversation. I was filled with a horrid fear that I was boring her. I  had probably arrived at the very moment when she was most interested in  her book. She must, I thought, even now be regarding me as a nuisance,  and was probably rehearsing bitter things to say to the maid for not  having had the sense to explain that she was out.    \"I--er--called in the hope of seeing Professor Derrick,\" I said.    \"You would find him on the links,\" she replied. It seemed to me that  she spoke wistfully.    \"Oh, it--it doesn't matter,\" I said. \"It wasn't anything important.\"    This was true. If the professor had appeared then and there, I should  have found it difficult to think of anything to say to him which would  have accounted to any extent for my anxiety to see him.    \"How are the chickens, Mr. Garnet?\" said she.    The situation was saved. Conversationally, I am like a clockwork toy. I  have to be set going. On the affairs of the farm I could speak  fluently. I sketched for her the progress we had made since her visit.  I was humorous concerning roop, epigrammatic on the subject of the  Hired Retainer and Edwin.    \"Then the cat did come down from the chimney?\" said Phyllis.    We both laughed, and--I can answer for myself--I felt the better for it.    \"He came down next day,\" I said, \"and made an excellent lunch of one of  our best fowls. He also killed another, and only just escaped death  himself at the hands of Ukridge.\"    \"Mr. Ukridge doesn't like him, does he?\"    \"If he does, he dissembles his love. Edwin is Mrs. Ukridge's pet. He is  the only subject on which they disagree. Edwin is certainly in the way  on a chicken farm. He has got over his fear of Bob, and is now  perfectly lawless. We have to keep a steady eye on him.\"    \"And have you had any success with the incubator? I love incubators. I  have always wanted to have one of my own, but we have never kept fowls.\"    \"The incubator has not done all that it should have done,\" I said.  \"Ukridge looks after it, and I fancy his methods are not the right  methods. I don't know if I have got the figures absolutely correct, but  Ukridge reasons on these lines. He says you are supposed to keep the  temperature up to a hundred and five degrees. I think he said a hundred  and five. Then the eggs are supposed to hatch out in a week or so. He  argues that you may just as well keep the temperature at seventy-two,  and wait a fortnight for your chickens. I am certain there's a fallacy  in the system somewhere, because we never seem to get as far as the  chickens. But Ukridge says his theory is mathematically sound, and he  sticks to it.\"    \"Are you quite sure that the way you are doing it is the best way to  manage a chicken farm?\"    \"I should very much doubt it. I am a child in these matters. I had only  seen a chicken in its wild state once or twice before we came down  here. I had never dreamed of being an active assistant on a real farm.  The whole thing began like Mr. George Ade's fable of the Author. An  Author--myself--was sitting at his desk trying to turn out any old  thing that could be converted into breakfast-food when a friend came in  and sat down on the table, and told him to go right on and not mind  him.\"    \"Did Mr. Ukridge do "]]]
