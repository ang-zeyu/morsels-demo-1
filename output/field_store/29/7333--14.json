The mother in clothing this germ of  life commingles, intertwines, and insinuates her own spirit, at the same  time educating, instructing, and determining its development according  to the influence she imparts to it. So the offspring partakes largely of  the nature of both its parents. The determination as to whether he  begets a male or female depends entirely upon the inmost vital state of  the male at the time of giving, although he is unconscious of the fact,  so that he can have no choice and no regulation, as some writers most  absurdly claim, in the matter of the forth-coming sex. He determines or  produces it unconsciously and involuntarily, the mother simply receiving,  clothing, and issuing from her body what the father has given her.    It must not be forgotten when exploring these deep subjects that man is  a spiritual being, clothed with a material body, that his spirit is his  inmost, and that what proceeds from him in the generative act has life  from his inmost; consequently the life-giving principle of his semen is  from his inmost, which constitutes its life-giving power. This inmost  from the male, the begetting power, is clothed by his seminal fluid for  an All-wise purpose; it is not the gross material, the clothing, that  begets, but the living power which this material contains, which  fructifies, or becomes conjoined, or commingled with the vital force of  the ovule of the mother,[K] so that she can clothe it; and when so  conjoined the germ, or seed, is planted in congenial soil. Conception  has thus really taken place by virtue of this act, and the animal mother  proceeds with her reproduction precisely upon the same general  principles that mother earth reproduces corn from a single kernel.      [K] See Guernsey's Obstetrics, 3d edition, on Reproduction.    It is universally acknowledged that the Lord creates, that we owe all to  Him, that He gives us our children, etc., etc. This is true, and it is  also true that He makes use of the parents, through whom he operates to  this end. By the constant influx of his Divine Love and Wisdom He gives  us life, and by virtue of this constant influx into the father who  begets, the mother's conception becomes doubly sacred. She conceives  from her husband, and at the same instant the Lord by virtue of His  Divine Power breathes into that conception the breath of life, whereby  it becomes a living soul. By the light of this truth we see that it is  not the parents who give life to their offspring. They only supply the  pure material substances which are organized into the human form by the  living and life-giving forces which constantly flow in from the Lord who  is life itself and from whom all life constantly emanates.

This is the orange-and-black whistler of our fruit and shade trees,  whose wife skillfully weaves a pendant cradle at the end of some  drooping branch, therein to lay her white eggs curiously marked with  fine lines and blotches of black. The young, after leaving the nest in  June, have a loud, babyish food-call, _dee-dee-dee-dee_, repeated time  after time until their wants are satisfied.      RUSTY BLACKBIRD    _Euphagus carolinus. Case 5, Figs. 3, 4_              The bird's common name is based on the fall            plumage of the male, which is broadly margined            with rusty. By spring these tips wear off and the            bird is glossy black.

It nests chiefly north  of the United States, migrates in small flocks, and is less noisy than  the Red-wing or Grackle and not so much in evidence as the Cowbird.  Dwight describes its notes as \"a confused medley of whistles, sweeter  and higher-pitched than those of the Red-wing.\" It nests in May,  building in coniferous trees or near the ground, and laying 4-7 greenish  eggs, heavily marked with brown and purple.      PURPLE GRACKLE    _Quiscalus quiscula quiscula. Case 5, Fig. 1_              Plumage varied with metallic and iridescent            reflections; tail long, fan-shaped, often 'keeled'            in flight; eye pale yellow. Male, L. 12-1/2. The            female is smaller and duller; L. 10-1/2.              _Range._ Eastern North America; nests east of the            Alleghanies from northern Georgia to Connecticut;            winters from Maryland southward.

The Florida Grackle (_Quiscalus quiscula aglaeus_, Case 4, Fig. 74) is  smaller than the Purple Grackle and has the head and neck violet-purple,  the back bottle-green. It is resident in Florida and the Gulf States  north to South Carolina.    The Bronzed Grackle (_Quiscalus quiscula oeneus_, Case 5, Fig. 2) is  the same size as the Purple Grackle, but has the body bronzy without  iridescent markings. It nests from Texas up the Mississippi Valley and  eastward through central New York and Massachusetts to New Brunswick,  north to Canada; and in migration is found in the range of the Purple  Grackle. It winters from the Ohio Valley southward.              Washington, rare T.V., Feb 20-Apl. 17. Ossining,            common T.V., Apl; Nov. Cambridge, abundant.

It migrates in  flocks and nests in colonies, often in parks and cemeteries. It feeds  chiefly on the ground and is frequently seen upon our lawns when it may  be known by its rather waddling, walking gait, and its long tail. Its  notes are harsh, cracked and discordant, but when heard in chorus make a  pleasing medley. The nest is sometimes placed in pines about 30 feet up,  but also in bushes and even in holes in trees. The 3-7 eggs are usually  pale bluish, heavily blotched and scrawled with brown and black.      BOAT-TAILED GRACKLE    _Megaquiscalus major major_              The male is a long-tailed, glossy blue-black bird.            (L. 16.) The female is much smaller (L. 12),            blackish brown above, buff below.              _Range._ Florida north on the Atlantic coast to            Virginia; west to Texas.    This giant Grackle frequents lakes, lagoons and bays, where it feeds  along the shore or among aquatic plants. The male, a poseur among birds,  strikes strange attitudes with bill pointing skyward, and with apparent  effort forces out hoarse whistles. The female is quiet and unassuming.  They nest in colonies, building in bushes and laying in April 3-5 bluish  white eggs, strikingly blotched and scrawled with blackish.          FINCHES, SPARROWS, ETC.

The male with the forehead and most of the            body yellow, the crown, wings and tail black; the            inner wing-quills white. The female is brownish            gray, more or less tinged with yellow, the wings            and tail black with white markings. L. 8.              _Range._ Western North America, wintering            regularly eastward to Minnesota and irregularly to            the North Atlantic States.              Glen Ellyn, one record, Dec. 11, 1889. SE. Minn.,            common W.V., Oct. 17-May 19.    [Illustration: EVENING GROSBEAK.    Male and Female.]    The Evening Grosbeak is a notable traveler from the far northwest whose  rare, irregular, and unheralded visits and striking appearance make him  always a welcome and distinguished guest. Of recent years these birds  have come to the east with greater frequency, arriving in November and  remaining as late as May. They feed largely on the buds and seeds of  trees--maple and box-elder--and can often be attracted to our  feeding-stations by the offer of sunflower seeds. They are usually  associated in flocks of from six to eight to ten birds, and their notes  when perching, have been described as resembling the jingle of small  sleigh-bells, while their song is said to be a \"wandering jerky warble.\"      PINE GROSBEAK    _Pinicola enucleator leucura. Case 2, Figs. 53, 54_              Adult males are unmistakable; but young males and            female might be confused with the female Evening            Grosbeak, but they lack the conspicuous white            markings in the wings and tail of that species. L.            9.              _Range._ Northern North America, wintering            southward irregularly to Indiana and New Jersey;            rarely as far as Kentucky and Washington.              Washington, casual in winter. Ossining, irregular            W.V., Dec. 18-Apl. 12. Cambridge, irregular W.V.,            frequently common, sometimes abundant, Nov. 1-Mch.            25. N. Ohio, occasional W.V. Glen Ellyn, uncommon            and irregular W.V., Oct. 25-? SE. Minn., uncommon            W.V.    In the summer the Pines Grosbeak lives in coniferous forests, but on its  irregular wanderings southward, like the Evening Grosbeak, it feeds upon  the seeds of deciduous trees and bushes. The Grosbeak's call-note is a  clear whistle of three or four notes which may be easily imitated; its  song is said to be prolonged and melodious.    The Pine and Evening Grosbeaks would be notable figures in any gathering  of birds, but coming at the most barren time of the year when our bird  population is at the minimum and the trees are leafless, they are as  welcome as they are conspicuous.      PURPLE FINCH    _Carpodacus purpureus purpureus. Case 2, Figs. 32, 33; Case 4, Figs. 48,  49_              The adult male is dull rose rather than purple,            the female is sparrow-like in appearance but may            be known by a whitish line over the eye and the            company she keeps. Young males resemble their            mother their first winter. L. 6-1/4.              _Range._ Eastern North America; nesting from            northern Illinois and northern New Jersey            northward to Canada; winters from the Middle            States to the Gulf.              Washington, common W.V., Sept. 12-May 26, largely            a migrant. Ossining, rare P.R., common T.V.            Cambridge, P.R. common from Apl. to Oct.;            irregular, but sometimes abundant in winter. N.            Ohio, common W.V., Sept. 1-May 20. Glen Ellyn,            fairly common T.V., Mch.-Apl., Sept.-Oct.,            uncommon W.V.    Erratic wanderers which travel on no fixed schedule but seem to feel at  home wherever they find themselves. Except when nesting, they usually  live in small flocks which, if the fare of our feeding-stands please  them, will sometimes live with us for weeks. The call-note is  _creak-creak_, the song a flowing, musical warble often uttered in  detached fragments. Four to six bluish, spotted eggs are laid in May;  the nest being generally built in a coniferous tree.      ENGLISH SPARROW; HOUSE SPARROW    _Passer domesticus domesticus. Case 2, Figs. 30, 31; Case 4, Figs. 38,  39_              Unfortunately too well known to require            description. L. 6-1/2.              _Range._ First introduced into this country at            Brooklyn, N.Y., from Europe in 1851; now found            everywhere at all times.    Hardy, pugnacious and adaptable, the Sparrow is a notable success in the  bird world. We could overlook his objectionable traits if he possessed a  pleasant voice, but his harsh, discordant notes and incessant chatter  are unfortunately in harmony with his character. After all he gives a  welcome touch of life to"]]]
