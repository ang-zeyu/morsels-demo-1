With reference to this great work of regeneration, Christ is called  \"the everlasting Father\" (Isa. 9:6), and we are renewed in him to life  eternal, being here regenerated into his likeness, and made in him new  creatures. And if our works ever prove acceptable in the sight of God,  they must spring from this principle of the new birth; that is, from  Christ, his Spirit, and an unfeigned faith.    9. Henceforth we must live in the new birth, and the new birth in us; we  must be in Christ, and Christ in us: we must live in the spirit of Christ,  and the spirit of Christ in us. Gal. 2:20. This regeneration with its  attendant fruits, is described by St. Paul, as the being \"renewed in the  spirit of our mind,\" \"putting off the old man,\" and the being \"transformed  into the image of God.\" He likewise considers it as the being \"renewed in  knowledge after the image of him that created us,\" and \"the renewing of  the Holy Ghost.\" Eph. 4:23; 2 Cor. 3:18; Col. 3:10; Tit. 3:5. It is termed  by Ezekiel, \"taking away the stony heart, and giving a heart of flesh.\"  Ch. 11:19. Hence it appears how the regeneration of man proceeds from the  incarnation of Jesus Christ. As man, by ambition, pride, and disobedience,  turned himself from God; so his apostasy could not be expiated and  removed, except by the extreme humility, lowliness, and obedience of the  Son of God. And as Christ, when upon earth, was most humble in his  conversation among men, so it is necessary, O man! that he should be the  same in thee; that he should dwell in thy soul, and restore the image of  God in thee.    10. And now, O man! contemplate the perfectly amiable, lowly, obedient,  and patient Jesus, and learn of him; live as he lived, yea, live in him,  and tread in his steps. For what was the cause of his living upon earth?  It was that he might become thy example, thy mirror, and the rule of thy  life. He, _he_ only, is the rule of life, and the pattern which every  Christian should strive to imitate. It is not the rule of any _man_  whatsoever. There is but one example,--Christ; and him the Apostles have,  with one consent, set before us for our imitation. And in the same manner  are we called to view his passion, death, and resurrection: even that  thou, O man! shouldest with him, die unto sin; and in him, with him, and  by him, spiritually rise again, and walk in newness of life, \"even as he  also walked.\" Rom. 6:4.    11. Thus may we see, how our regeneration arises from the passion, death,  and resurrection, of our gracious Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. Hence,  St. Peter saith, \"God hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the  resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.\" 1 Pet. 1:3. And all the  apostles will everywhere be found to lay the foundation of repentance and  of a new life, in the passion of Christ. St. Peter, indeed, gives this  express charge: \"Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear; forasmuch  as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver  and gold; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without  blemish and without spot\" (1 Pet. 1:17-19); in which we may observe, that  the ransom paid for our redemption is urged as the motive to a holy  conversation. The same apostle tells us, likewise, that \"Christ his own  self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to  sins, should live unto righteousness\" (1 Peter 2:24); and Jesus himself  has said: \"Thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead  the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be  preached in his name.\" Luke 24:46, 47.    12. It is evident, therefore, that from the passion and death of Christ,  proceed both the satisfaction made for our sins, and the renewing of our  nature by faith; and that they both are necessary to the restoration of  fallen man. The latter, as well as the former, is the blessed effect of  Christ's passion, which worketh our renewal and sanctification. 1 Cor.  1:30. Thus the new birth in us proceeds from Christ. And as a means to  attain this end, holy Baptism has been instituted, wherein we are baptized  into the death of Christ, in order that we might die with him unto sin by  the power of his death, and rise again from sin by the power of his  resurrection.          Chapter IV.              Of True Repentance, And The True Yoke And Cross Of Christ.          _They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the      affections and lusts._--GAL. 5:24.      Repentance, or true conversion, is the work of the Holy Spirit, under the  influence of which, man, through the _law_, acknowledges his sin, and the  wrath of God provoked against it; and earnestly mourns over his offences;  and then, understanding, through the _Gospel_, the grace of God, by faith  in Christ Jesus, he obtains the remission of his sins. By this repentance,  the mortification or crucifying of the flesh, and of all carnal lusts and  pleasures, is carried on; together with the quickening of the spirit, or  the resurrection of the new man in Christ. Under the exercise of  repentance, therefore, the old Adam, with his corruptions, dies within us;  and Christ lives in us, by faith (Gal. 2:20); for we must be aware that  these two are inseparably connected. The resurrection of the spirit  follows the mortification of the flesh; and the quickening of the new man,  destroys and annihilates the old man; the ruin of the one, is the life and  resurrection of the other. \"Though our outward man perish, yet the inward  man is renewed day by day.\" 2 Cor. 4:16. We are, therefore, enjoined to  \"mortify our members which are upon the earth\" (Col. 3:5); and to \"reckon  ourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God, through Jesus  Christ our Lord.\" Rom. 6:11.    2. Let us, however, inquire why the flesh is thus to be mortified; and why  the whole body of sin is at last to be destroyed. It has been remarked  (Chap. II) that, by the fall of Adam, man became earthly, carnal, and  devilish; without God, and without love: for being without God, he was  also without love. Man was now turned from the love of God to the love of  the world, and especially of himself; so that in every situation, and  under all circumstances, he now studies, favors, flatters, counsels, and  applauds himself; and provides only for his own interest, honor, and  glory. All this is the consequence of Adam's fall; who, while meditating  how he might erect himself, as it were, into _a God_, was involved,  together with all his posterity, in the same awful sin and perdition. This  depravation of human nature must of necessity be entirely removed; and  this can be effected only by serious repentance; by godly sorrow; by a  faith that apprehends the remission of sin; by the mortification of  sensual pleasure; and by the crucifixion of pride and self-love. For true  repentance consists not in putting away gross and open sins only; but it  requires that a man should enter his heart, and search into its inmost  recesses. The secret parts, the windings and the turnings of iniquity are  to be laid open; in order that the returning sinner may be thoroughly  renewed, and, at length, be converted from the love of himself, to the  love of God; from the love of the world, to a life of spirituality; and  from a participation of earthly pomps and pleasures, to a participation,  through faith, of the merits of Christ.    3. Hence it follows, that a man must deny himself (Luke 9:23); that is, he  must mortify his own will, and suffer himself to be entirely led by the  will of God. He must no longer love, seek, and esteem himself; but he must  account himself to be the unworthiest and most miserable of all creatures.  He must renounce all he has for the love of Christ; and trample on the  world, its pomps, and its vanities. He must pass by his own wisdom and  natural endowments, as though he beheld them not; he must confide in no  creature, but in God alone; yea, he must \"hate his own life\" (Luke 14:26),  that is, his carnal will and pleasures; his pride, covetousness, lust,  wrath, and envy. He must not please, but rather displease himself; nor  must he attribute anything to his own strength or ability. In a word, he  must be crucified to the world (Gal. 6:14), to the lust of the eyes and  the flesh, and to the pride of life. This, and this alone, is that true  repentance and mortification of the flesh, without which no man can ever  be a disciple of Jesus Christ. This only is conversion from self, the  world, and the devil, unto God (Acts 26:18); without which no one can  receive remission of sins, nor be saved.    4. This is the true cross and yoke of Christ; that of which the Saviour  spoke when he said, \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek  and lowly in heart.\" Matt. 11:29. As if he had said, \"Thy self-love and  ambition must be removed by earnest and inward humility, of which thou  hast an example in me; and by the example of my meekness, must thy wrath  and desire of revenge be subdued.\" This, to the new man, is an easy yoke  and a light burden; though, to the flesh, it may seem to be a most bitter  and afflictive cross. This is to crucify our own flesh, with the  affections and lusts. Gal. 5:24.    5. They, therefore, who are acquainted with no other cross than the  tribulations and afflictions of this life, greatly err; being ignorant of  that true cross, which we ought to bear after our Lord daily; namely,  inward repentance, and the mortification of the flesh; submitting to our  enemies with great patience; and overcoming the malice of slanderers by  humility and mildness, after the pattern which the Lamb of God has left  us. For it becomes us to follow the example of Christ, who renounced all  worldly splendor and glory, and everything that is commonly esteemed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34781"],[0,"An Australian Bird Book: A Pocket Book for Field Use (#14)"],[1,"., 8(4)E., 2(0)Nc., 3(1)Nl.

At the head of the Australian birds is the Black Swan--that _rara  avis_ which, possibly, has done more to advertize Australia than  any other Australian animal or plant. A \"black\" swan was an  \"impossibility,\" so this bird was one of the strongest factors  in establishing Australia's reputation as a land of paradoxes and  contradictions.    The Black Swan is well known outside Australia, as it is common  in every park and garden in Europe. Gould feared that it would be  exterminated here, but fortunately Australians are now learning to  appreciate their own land, and there is no danger of such a calamity.    Eight species of Swans are known to occur all over the world with the  exception of New Zealand and Africa.    In the next sub-family there is but one bird--the Semipalmated Goose  of Australia. This bird, better known as the Magpie Goose, has its  feet but half-webbed, hence its specific name, _semipalmata_. It is  getting rare, though I heard of six near Colac recently.    Again, the only living representative of the next sub-family is the  Cape Barren Goose, which is common in city gardens in Adelaide. It  is also becoming rare. It is found only in Tasmania, the Bass Strait  Islands, and Southern Australia. We visited its nesting place near  Flinders Island. It is a very pugnacious bird, so it is difficult to  keep with other birds.    After the Goose sub-family comes the group which includes our  \"Wood Duck,\" or, as it is called, the Maned Goose, for its bill is  goose-like. It is a common bird in Australia. Two allied genera are  found in South America and North-east Africa respectively.    In the next sub-family come the domestic Ducks and most of the wild  Ducks of Australia. This group is often referred to as the \"Freshwater  or River Ducks.\"    First come two kinds of Whistling Ducks--so called on account of their  whistling note uttered while flying. These are rare Ducks, one of  which is found as far as India; the other is occasionally seen in  New Zealand, as well as in Australia. The Sheldrake, or Shieldrake  (Mountain Duck) is the largest Australian Duck, and one of the most  handsome of the sub-family. It is nowhere very plentiful, though one  or more pairs appear in most suitable localities. As it is unfit for  the table, it should be spared as an ornament to the landscape.    The Black Duck is very similar to the common wild Duck (Mallard) of  England. Our Black Duck does not change color with the season, nor is  the male different in color from the female.    The Australian Teal is closely similar to the Teal of Europe. It is a  grass feeder, and is a good table bird. The female is very different  from the male. It is impossible to distinguish the male Gray Teal from  the female Teal when in the free state. Mr. Keartland (ex-President of  the Field Naturalist Club, and ornithologist to the Horn and Calvert  exploring expeditions) has shown that there is a big difference in  weight. The male of the smaller Gray Teal is not brightly colored like  the male Chestnut-breasted Teal.    The remarkable Shoveller comes next. It is closely similar to the  English Shoveller. Strange that this name was first used for the  Spoonbill. The Shovellers are found the world over. The males are very  brightly colored in the nesting season.    Unlike most other birds, Swans and Ducks lose the whole of their wing  feathers at once when moulting, so that for a short time they cannot  fly. As a protection, the gaudy ones acquire a quiet, inconspicuous  coloration for a time, so that the male is said to get an \"eclipse  plumage.\" Many other birds get a bright dress for the breeding season  only, but the male Duck wears his bright dress for the whole year,  except in the moulting period. It is then \"eclipsed,\" with the  corresponding advantage that he is protected from his many enemies at  a time when he is most helpless.    The remarkable Pink-eared Duck has no close relative. It has a small  pink spot between the eye and ear, and so is called pink-eyed or  pink-eared. It is found only in Australia. The female is similar in  color to the male. The name Wigeon, or Widgeon, sometimes applied to  this Duck, properly belongs to another of the fresh-water Ducks which  is not found in Australia. Hence, this name should not be used for our  bird.    Another peculiar Australian Duck is the Freckled Duck. It is a  very rare bird. One taken on the ornithologists' excursion to Eyre  Peninsula was considered a prize. So far as is known, it does not  change color with the season, nor has the male or female the usual  bright metallic patch seen on the wing of a Duck.    The \"Salt-water Ducks\" form the next sub-family. These Ducks, though,  are not always true to name, for they are not confined to the salt  water. The Victorian representative is the well-known White-eyed  Duck, or Hardhead. This Duck was common on the Botanic Gardens  Lake, Melbourne, until it was emptied some time ago. Thus, our  one \"Salt-water Duck\" was often seen on fresh water. In the same  sub-family come the Eider-Ducks of Iceland and the Logger-head,  Racehorse, or Steamer Duck, of Magellan Straits, which is said to lose  the power of flight on reaching maturity after the first moult. Thus  the life-history tells us that this bird is a degenerate form, and  not a primitive flightless form, for it has evidently descended from  flying ancestors. It uses its wings to row itself along at great  speed.    The ninth sub-family of this group of swimming birds contains two  native Ducks. The Blue-billed Duck, the first of these, is \"especially  adapted for immersion and for obtaining its food from the bottom of  the water rather than on its surface.\" It was thought by Gould to be  confined to the coastal lagoons of Western Australia, but it has since  been recorded from inland in Victoria, and four specimens have been  taken in Tasmania. It remains under the water for a considerable time,  and, if hunted, flaps along the surface with its short wings, but  hesitates to exercise its \"feeble grebe-like flight.\"    Some writers declare that the large Musk Duck is the most remarkable  of the many remarkable birds of Australia. It is the only known  species of the genus, and is \"singularly different from every other  member of the Duck family,\" as"]]]
