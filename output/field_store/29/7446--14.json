His sacrifice begins in the evening. During the night he appeals to  all the gods. At last Indras, flattered by the praise heaped upon  him, concedes to him a golden chariot, upon which, with praises to the  Acvinau, and help from the dawn, Cunahcepas, unbound from the fetters  of Varunas, is delivered. These fetters of Varunas, which imprison the  victim, bound and sacrificed by his own father, help us to understand  the second part of the European popular tale of the son sacrificed  against his will to the demon by his father; for Cunahcepas, towards  the end of the European story, takes the form of a horse, Varunas that  of a demon, and the fetters of Varunas are the bridle of the horse,  which the imprudent father sells to the demon, together with his son  in the shape of a horse;[220] the beautiful daughter of the demon (the  white one, who, as usual, comes out of the black monster) delivers the  young man transformed into a horse; as in the Vedic story of  Cunahcepas, it is explicitly the dawn who is the young girl that  delivers.[221] Varunas is called in the _Ramayanam_ the god who has in  his hand a rope (_pacahastas_); his dwelling is on Mount Astas, where  the sun goes down, and which it is impossible to touch, because it  burns, in an immense palace, the work of Vicvakarman, which has a  hundred rooms, lakes with nymphs, and trees of gold.[222] Evidently,  Varunas is here, not a different form, but a different name of the god  Yamas, the pacin, or furnished with rope, the constrictor _par  excellence_; for we are to suppose the magic display of golden  splendour in the evening heavens not so much the work of the sun  itself, as produced by the gloomy god who sits on the mountain, who  invests and surprises the solar hero, and drags him into his kingdom.  As to Hariccandras and Agigartas, Rohitas and Cunahcepas, they appear,  in my opinion, to be themselves different names for not only the same  celestial phenomenon, but the same mythical personage. Hariccandras is  celebrated in the legends as a solar king; Rohitas, his son, the red  one, is his _alter ego_, as well as his successor Cunahcepas.  Hariccandras, moreover, who promises to sacrifice his son to Varunas,  seems to differ little, if at all, from Agigartas, who sells his own  son for the sacrifice. The _Ramayanam_,[223] has given us a third name  for the same unnatural father,[224] in Vicvamitras, who asks his own  sons to sacrifice themselves, instead of Cunahcepas, who is under his  protection, and as they refuse to obey, he curses them.    The variation of the same legend which we find in the  _Harivancas_[225] proves these identities, and adds a new and notable  particular. The wife of Vicvamitras designs, on account of her  poverty, to barter her middle son for a hundred cows, and with that  view already keeps him tied with a rope like a slave. The grandfather  of Rohitas, Hariccandras's father, Tricankus, wanders through the  woods, and delivers this son of Vicvamitras, whose family he  thenceforth protects and maintains. The deeds of Tricankus, who begs  of Vasishtas to be allowed to ascend to heaven bodily, and who, by  grace of Vicvamitras, obtains instead the favour of remaining  suspended in the air like a constellation, are also attributed to his  son Hariccandras; whence we may affirm, without much risk of  contradiction, that as Tricankus is another name for his son  Hariccandras, so Hariccandras is another name for his son Rohitas, and  that, therefore, the Tricankus of the _Harivancas_ is the same as the  Rohitas of the _Aitareya_, with this difference, that Tricankus buys  the son destined to the sacrifice in order to free him, while Rohitas  buys him to free himself. But the first hundred cows given by  Tricankus to Vicvamitras do not suffice for him, and the fruits of his  hunting in the forest are not enough to maintain the family, a  circumstance which weighs upon him almost as much as if the family  were his own; upon which, in order to save Vicvamitras, in order to  save Vicvamitras's son, and, we can perhaps add, to save himself, he  resolves to sacrifice, to kill the beautiful and dearly-prized wife of  Vasishtas (the very luminous). I have said the wife of Vasishtas, but  the _Harivancas_ says, speaking strictly, it was the cow of Vasishtas  who was killed. But we know from the _Ramayanam_[226] that this cow of  Vasishtas, this kamadhuk or kamadhenus, which yields at pleasure all  that is wished for, this cow of abundance, is kept by Vasishtas, under  the name of Cabala, as his own wife. Vicvamitras is covetous of her;  he demands her from Vasishtas, and offers a hundred cows for her, the  exact price which, in the _Harivancas_, he receives from Tricankus for  his own son. Vasishtas answers that he will not give her for a  hundred, nor for a thousand, nor even for a hundred thousand cows, for  Cabala is his gem, his riches, his all, his life.[227] Vicvamitras  carries her off; she returns to the feet of Vasishtas, and bellows;  her bellowing calls forth armies, who come out of her own body; the  hundred sons of Vicvamitras are burned to ashes by them. These armies  which come out of the body of Vasishtas's cow remind us again of the  Vedic cow, from which come forth winged darts, or birds, by which the  enemies are filled with terror. Vasishtas is a form of Indras; his cow  is here the rain-cloud. Vicvamitras, who wishes to ravish the cow from  Vasishtas, often assumes monstrous forms in the Hindoo legends, and is  almost always malignant, perverse, and revengeful. His hundred sons  burned to cinders by Vasishtas remind us, from one point of view, of  the hundred cities of Cambaras destroyed by Indras, and the hundred  perverse Dhritarashtrides of the _Mahabharatam_; whence his name,  Vicvamitras, which may also mean the enemy of all (_vicva-amitras_),  would agree well with his almost demoniacal character.    This story of the cow of Vasishtas, whose relationship with the legend  of Cunahcepas cannot be doubted, brings us back to the animal forms of  heroes and heroines from which we started. In the story of Vasishtas,  the cow-cloud, the cow cabala, or the spotted-cow, plays in the epic  poem the part of the cow Aditis, the cow pricnis (spotted, variegated),  with which we are already familiar in the Vedic hymns. This cow is  benignant towards the god, or the hero, or the wise Vasishtas, as the  pricnis is to the god Indras. But we have seen in the _Rigvedas_ itself  the cloud as the enemy of the god, and represented as a female form of  the monster, as his sister. This sister generally tries to seduce the  god, promising to deliver into his hands the monster her brother, and  she sometimes succeeds, as the witch Hidimba of the _Mahabharatam_, who  gives up her brother, the monster Hidimbas, into the hands of the hero  Bhimas, who thereupon espouses her. On the other hand, Curpanakha, the  sister of the monster Ravanas, does not succeed in her intent; making  herself beautiful, she endeavours to win the affection of the hero  Ramas; but being ridiculed by him and by Lakshmanas, she becomes  deformed, and sends forth cries like a cloud in the rainy season,[228]  exciting her brothers to annihilate Ramas.    The same cloud-monster is found again in the _Ramayanam_, under the  name of Dundubhis, in the form of a terrible buffalo with sharpened  horns.[229] The buffalo, as a wild animal, is often chosen to  represent the principle of evil, in the same way as the bull,  increaser of the bovine herds, is selected as the image of good. This  bellowing buffalo, whence his name of Dundubhis (drum), strikes and  knocks with his two horns at the door of the cavern[230] of the son of  Indras (Balin), the king of the monkeys. But Balin takes Dundubhis by  the horns, throws him on the ground, and destroys him.    Dundus is also a name given to the father of Krishnas, or the black one,  who in the _Rigvedas_ is still a demon, and only later becomes the god  of cows and cowherds, a govindas, or pastor _par excellence_.[231]  Indras, his enemy in the Vedas, having fallen from heaven, he became one  of the most popular gods, and even sometimes the most popular form of  the deity. In the _Mahabharatam_, for instance, he is almost the _deus  ex machina_ of the battles between the Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras,  and presents many analogies to the Zeus of the Iliad; whereas Indras  plays only a part in the episodes, the rain-giver and thunderer being  often forgotten for the black one who prepares and hurls the light. But  the fall of Indras begins in the Vedas themselves. In the _Yagurvedas_,  Vicvarupas, the son of Tvashtar, whom Indras kills, appears as no less  than the purohitas or high-priest of the gods, and son of a daughter of  the Asuras; he has three heads, of which one drinks the ambrosia,  another the spirituous drink, while the third eats food. Indras cuts off  Vicvarupas's three heads, in revenge of the one which drinks his  ambrosia; he is therefore charged with having killed a Brahman, and  decried as a brahmanicide.[232] In the _Aitareya-brahmanam_,[233] the  criminality of Indras in this regard is confirmed, to which the  _Kaushitaki-Upanishad_ also refers. In the seventh book of the  _Ramayanam_, even the multiform monster Ravanas is represented as a  great penitent, whom Brahman fills with supreme grace; in the sixth  book, the son of the wind, Hanumant, cuts off the three heads of the  Ravanide monster Triciras (having three heads), as one day Indras cut  off the three heads of the monster Vritras, son of Tvashtar;[234] and he  cuts all the three heads off together (_samas_), as the hero of the  European popular tales must cut off, at a blow, the three heads of the  serpent, the wizard, otherwise he is powerless, and able to do nothing.  The monster, like the hero, seems to have a special"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38750"],[0,"Current History: A Monthly Magazine of the New York Times, May 1918 (#14)"],[1,"nt. One goes up in a state of suppressed agitation over  the latest reports and rumors, and finds himself suddenly wrapped around  by an atmosphere of businesslike quietude that extends nearly to the  front trenches. Even in the firing line the stoical silence of the men  and their immobility, except in spasmodic crises, seem to dominate the  hellish roar of bursting shells.    From this point backward the machine works with a smoothness that  rebukes our anxieties. In a circuit of forty miles, ending on the hills  overlooking the left bank of the Oise, between Noyon and Chauny, I did  not see a single sign of confusion, and there were many signs of  satisfaction that the war had entered upon a decisive stage.    This is not strange. Very few soldiers hear as much of the latest news  as one does in Paris or London; but all soldiers know more of the  strength of their army than civilians can know. They may rarely see  their General and understand little of military science; they may be  unable to tell you exactly how the battle line stands, but they have a  thousand ways of learning the quality of their chiefs and of knowing far  in advance of the official bulletins whether things are going well or  ill.    So far as my information goes there is good reason for this equitable  state of mind. The German advance is remarkable, but it has been  adequately paid for. Along the successive lines of heights southwest of  St. Quentin the British, and afterward the French, who took this sector,  had excellent firing positions, and retired from one to another in good  order. The enemy came on wave upon wave, reckless of losses, as though  certain points must be reached at any cost at certain hours. The allied  troops fired upon them continuously, often exhausting their ammunition  before the moment came for falling back. The Crown Prince's troops were  at some points literally mown down. One machine gunner with a good  target got through 30,000 cartridges, and could have fired twice that  number had they been at hand. A Bavarian regiment lost half of its  effectives in this drive toward the Oise.      NEW METHOD OF ASSAULT    The new method of assault by which the Germans obtained their first  successes--new in its intensity, though not in its elements  combined--seems to be as follows: After a short but heavy bombardment,  in which gas shells play a larger part than ever, masses of troops  brought up at the last moment are sent forward, wave after wave. The  first wave must reach its objective at any cost, and, leaving the still  resisting groups to be dealt with by bodies of grenadiers and flame  pumpers, at once begins to throw heavy machine-gun and rifle fire upon  the rear of the next line to be attacked, so as to prevent reserves  from coming up. It is then passed by a second wave, which installs  itself in the next position, engages it, and is in turn passed by a  third wave, and so on.    Even when, as in this case, the method has been rehearsed with Teutonic  thoroughness, it is one that involves losses which other than German  armies could not be asked to bear.      THE GERMAN STRENGTH    March 29.--On the front of fifty miles, where the enemy had had only  sixteen divisions, he commenced his great gamble with about thirty-eight  divisions. It was already a heavy superiority, but there had been  recognized up to last night a total of about eighty-seven divisions  engaged, that is to say over a million men have been poured into this  space, which forms only about an eighth of the western front, the  greater part of these being new reserves, brought up after the operation  was launched. They include many of the best imperial troops, the 1st,  2d, and 5th Guard Divisions, for instance, and two crack Bavarian  divisions.    Three of the army commanders are reckoned among the most successful of  the German Generals--von Below, who directed the Italian offensive; von  der Marwitz, who did so much with his cavalry corps in the battle of the  Marne to check pursuit and has done so well since in higher positions,  and von Hutier, who tried new infantry tactics in the capture of Riga.  The last named represents the army and the prestige of the Imperial  Crown Prince. The other two serve the Crown Prince of Bavaria, and the  enterprise received a special blessing from the Emperor.    Their whole design points to an intention of making this a singly  decisive operation. Consider again the figures given above. Before the  offensive the enemy had on this front from the sea to the Alps about 109  divisions in line and seventy-six in reserve. By calling the reserves  they have been able (and it has been necessary) by the eighth day of the  battle to put about eighty-seven divisions, 1,044,000 men, into the  combat. Good observers consider that at the most they can hardly bring  up more than forty more divisions.      LINE ALMOST BROKEN    March 30.--Immediately west of Noyon, Mont Renaud and some neighboring  hills have been recovered and are strongly held. The bridges over the  Oise between Point l'Eveque and Chauny have been broken, and the river  there is so well covered by artillery and infantry that there is no  danger of a passage being forced.    This was the first fruit of the French northward movement on the evening  of March 21. Several divisions of the neighboring French Army were  rushed up in motor wagons to the aid of the British right wing, which  was thus enabled to draw north along the Crozat Canal. Their guns and  supply columns followed. On the next day a further force was placed  opposite Chauny, and other French troops were ordered to extend their  lines northwestward, keeping in touch with the retiring British right.  The constant displacement required in this delicate task and the fact  that the French were gradually drawing upon themselves an increasing  part of the German onset explain the delay in making considerable  counterattacks.    On the 24th the French repelled repeated attempts to cross the Oise, and  their lines, which already stretched to Evricourt, more than half way  from Noyon to Lassigny, were extended to the neighborhood of the latter  town.    The difficulties inevitable in so rapid a movement of reserves were met  everywhere with splendid cheerfulness and energy. One of the artillery  regiments, brought up by motor wagon, had no horses with it, but got its  pieces into action, and, having to retreat, dragged them back three  miles by hand.    Meanwhile, definitely checked on the south, and feeling all the time for  the line of least resistance, the German host was gravitating rapidly  westward between Roye and Chaulnes. Now that the danger has completely  passed, it may be said that it came very near breaking through the  allied front in this region on the 25th. The 26th and 27th saw an  accentuation of pressure at the point of junction, but, while the front  was pushed back on the first day to l'Echelle-St. Aurin on the Avre, and  on the next to Montdidier, other French troops had been brought up to  strengthen the British right, and yesterday, after several hard combats,  it seemed that the offensive was definitely contained.      BATTLE FOR MONTDIDIER    April 1.--Montdidier, quaintly seated on a steep hill beside the  Amiens-Clermont railway, is an important crossroads. On Friday the enemy  had pulled himself together and delivered along twenty-five miles of  broken country from Demuin to near Lassigny a new mass attack, supported  with a considerable number of field guns. On the French left the British  held Demuin, but were driven out of Mezieres. The French bore the main  shock heroically. Step by step they fell back, leaving masses of German  dead and wounded before their lines.    The combat continued throughout Sunday, spreading out a little at both  ends, and it is impossible for me to piece together the fragmentary and  often incoherent reports from the field so as adequately to represent  its wild fluctuations.    Savagely set upon breaking through to Amiens and the Amiens-Paris  railway, von Hutier's columns succeeded in reaching the Avre at Moreuil.  Between Montdidier and Lassigny, where the front curves to the  southeast, the enemy put no less strength into his outward thrust.  Hand-to-hand fighting continued for hours in the villages of Orvillers  on the west and Plessis de Roye, near Lassigny, and the neighboring  hamlet of Plemont, all of which repeatedly changed hands. The German  troops which got into Plemont and part of Plessis were driven out by a  magnificent charge of the French, some units flying in disorder. The  slaughter of yesterday's fighting is said to exceed anything seen in the  preceding days of the battle.    On the ninth day a new chapter of the tragic story was opened. The  Allies, their lines unbroken, were standing with clenched teeth on good  positions and were hourly adding to their strength in men and guns.  Amiens appeared to the enemy like a mirage on the western horizon, and  the two Crown Princes may have reflected that there would be accounts to  pay at home if this time, after sacrifices such as can only be  paralleled in rare episodes of military history like the retreat from  Moscow, they did not bring back a victorious peace.      BLOW AT JUNCTION POINT    A smashing blow at the Franco-British junction was then to be decisive.  It was begun with means believed to be adequate to this aim and was  directed westward on both sides of Montdidier toward the Beauvais-Amiens  railway, with a supporting thrust from the threatened flank west of  Lassigny.    Further south, toward Montdidier, which they already held, the Germans  crossed the river, again suffering very heavy losses, but were arrested  on the hills of the western bank. In the evening the struggle, despite  the exhaustion of both sides, attained its fiercest intensity. Moreuil  was recaptured on Saturday night by a mixed Canadian and French force,  lost again during the night,"]]]
