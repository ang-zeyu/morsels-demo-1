He  knows that winter is a hard time for poor beasts, and that fruits are  then rare or hidden beneath the snow; in the autumn, therefore, when  all the riches of the earth are abundant, and beech-nuts, acorns, and  chestnuts have ripened, he harvests quantities of them and hides them  wherever he can. Making use of the cavities he is acquainted with  around his domain, hollow trees, holes that he makes in the earth  beneath bushes, etc., he fills them with fruits, and when winter has  come he extracts them to munch.    _Animals who construct barns._--The Field Rat of Hungary and Asia  (_Psammomys_) gathers wheat during the summer. He cuts the blades and  transports them to his home, where he stores them up in very  considerable quantities; and during rigorous winters when famine  appears also among men, gleaners of another species appear on the  scene and seek for corn under the earth in the nests of the  _Psammomys_. A single rat can store up more than a bushel. Those who  are skilful in finding their holes can thus in a day glean a good  harvest, to the detriment of the rats who are thus in their turn  reduced to beggary.    The Hamster also makes provision of grain, but he introduces two  improvements: the first at the harvest by only taking the edible part  of the ear, and the second by constructing barns distinct from his  home. Each possesses a burrow composed of a sleeping chamber, around  which he has hollowed one or two others communicating with the first  by passages, and intended to serve as barns. The old and more  experienced animals prepare even four or five of these storehouses.  The end of summer is their season for work. They scatter themselves in  the fields of barley or wheat, pull down the stalks of the cereals  with their anterior paws, and then cut off the ear with their teeth.  This done, they set about thrashing their wheat--that is to say, they  separate the grain from the straw by turning the ear round and round  between their paws. When the grains come out they pile them up in  their cheeks, and thus transport them to one of the chambers already  mentioned; they then return to exploit the field and continue these  labours until they have completed the stores for winter.    A certain Vole (_Arvicola economus_) acts in much the same way as the  Hamster, though he harvests a different class of objects. It is not  wheat which he collects but roots. He has to find these roots, to dig  them up, to cut them into fragments of suitable dimensions for  transport, and finally to pile them up in rooms disposed to receive  them. This species, which inhabits Siberia, measures about twelve  centimetres in length, but during summer and autumn Voles accomplish  an amount of work which is surprising having regard to their size. The  moment having arrived to think about winter, the Voles spread  themselves about the steppe. Each hollows little pits around the roots  he wishes to extract. After having bared them he cleans them while  still in position, so as not to encumber his storehouses with useless  earth. This preparatory labour having been completed, he divides the  root into slices of a weight proportioned to his strength, and carries  away the fragments one by one. Seizing each with his teeth, he walks  backwards drawing it after him, and thus traverses a long road,  crossing paths, going round tufts of grass or other obstacles, not  letting himself be rebuffed by the difficulty and length of the task.  Arrived at his hole, he enters this also backwards, drawing his burden  through all his galleries. His dwelling, though the entrance is rather  more complicated, resembles that of the Hamster. Like the latter, it  is composed of a central room placed in communication with the outside  by a maze of passages, which cross one another. That is the  sleeping-room, the walls of which are well formed, and which is  carpeted with hay. From this various underground passages start which  lead to the storerooms, which are three or four in number. It is to  these that the Vole bears his harvest. Each compartment is large  enough to contain four or five kilogrammes of roots, so that the  little rodent finds himself at the end of the season the proprietor of  about fifteen kilogrammes of food in reserve. He would have enough to  enable him to revel in abundance if he were able to reckon without his  neighbours. This diligent animal has in fact one terrible parasite.  This is Man, who will not allow him to enjoy in peace the fruits of  his long labour and economy. In Siberia, a long and severe winter  follows a very hot summer; in this season the inhabitants often lack  provisions. A moment comes when they are glad to make up for want of  bread by edible roots; but the search for these is long and  troublesome, and should indeed have been thought of during summer.  Man, during the fine weather less foreseeing than the rodent, does not  hesitate when famine has come to turn to him for help. As he is the  weaker, the Vole is obliged to submit to this vexatious tax. According  to Pallas,[48] the inhabitants seek these nests full of provisions and  dig them up. The conqueror takes all he pleases, and abandons the rest  to the unfortunate little beast, who, whether he likes it or not, has  to be content. In this region the burrows of the Vole abound;  therefore this singular tithe ensures a considerable revenue to those  who levy it, as may be understood when we remember the extent of the  stores amassed by the animal.       [48] Pallas, _Ueber d. am Volgastrome bemerkten Wanderungen          der grossen Wassermaeuse (Arvicola amphibius),          Nord--Beitr._, vol. i., 1781, p. 335.    A Vole resembling the _Arvicola arvalis_, but larger, paler, and more  rat-like, with large shining eyes and very short tail, overran in  1892-93 the classic land of Thessaly, the land of Olympus, and the  Vale of Tempe. It has always inhabited this region, and the old Greeks  had an Apollo Smintheus, or Myoktonos, the Mouse-destroying God. \"At  the beginning of March,\" according to Prof. Loeffler, who has given an  account of this invasion,[49] \"the Voles were only beginning to troop  from the slopes of the hills and the fallow-lands to the cultivated  fields. It was frequently observed that they followed regular paths  during their inroads. Thus they advanced along the railway embankment.  Their progress seemed to be rather slow. Perhaps they do not advance  further till the inhabitants of one of their strongholds or so-called  castles have become too numerous. The runs which they excavate are at  a depth of about twenty to thirty centimetres below the surface of the  ground. The extent of their runs varies, and we found them extending  in length from thirty to forty metres and more. These runs are  connected with the surface by vertical holes of about five centimetres  in diameter. In many places four, five, and more holes have led to the  same run. In such cases there is generally, not far off, an  enlargement for the nest, lined with finely-ground vegetable material,  where the young are produced and reared. In front of newly-opened  holes the earth, which has been thrown far out, forms smooth hillocks.  There were many well-defined and well-trodden paths on the ground, by  which the Voles pass from one hole to another. They are never seen out  of their holes by day, not even in places where the entire ground is  riddled with holes like a sieve. They do not come out in search of  food till the evening; even then not many are to be seen, but the  peculiar squeaking noise they make is to be heard everywhere. Next day  all sorts of freshly-severed plants are to be found in the holes.  Stalks of corn they manipulate by standing on their hind legs and  gnawing through the stalk; when this is bitten off they drag it into  their holes to devour it there, sometimes making it smaller. They do  their work with amazing rapidity. One evening a field was visited  which was to be mowed next day, but when the labourers came in the  morning they found nothing to cut. The Voles had destroyed the entire  crop in a single night. A miller in the neighbourhood of Velestino  reported that he went to his field early one morning, cut a measure of  corn, loaded it on his ass, and brought it to his mill. When he  returned to his mill with a second load he found scarcely a vestige of  the first remaining. Thinking it had been stolen he kept watch for the  thief; but suddenly, to his great astonishment, hosts of Voles  appeared and set to work to carry off the second load.\" Such facts as  these recorded by Loeffler are by no means a merely recent phenomenon;  Aristotle was familiar with the devastations of the Voles, and wrote  that \"some small farmers, having one day observed that their corn was  ready for harvest, when they went the following day to cut their corn,  found it all eaten.\" Other ancient writers record similar facts.[50]       [49] _Centralblatt f. Bak. u. Parasitenkunde_, July 1892,          and _Zoologist_, September 1892.       [50] _Zoologist_, May 1893. It may be added that the          Scottish Vole, which was so destructive about the same time,          does not burrow to a depth like the Thessaly Vole, but lives          in shallow runs amongst the roots of herbage. Its exploits          are recorded in a Report on the Plague of Field-Mice in          Scotland, made by a committee appointed by the President of          the Board of Agriculture, 1893.    Two birds of North America, belonging to the Woodpecker family,  prepare their provisions for the bad season with consummate art; not  only do they harvest them and place them in shelter, but they arrange  them in such a manner that at the right moment they can utilise them  in the most convenient manner.    One of them which is common in California, the _Melanerpes  formicivorus_, nourishes himself, as his name indicates, by insects,  and especially"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29839"],[0,"The House in the Water: A Book of Animal Stories (#14)"],[1,"all. Three times he set the hollow birch-bark to  his mouth, and sent the hoarse, appealing summons echoing over the  water. And the man, crouching invisible in the thick shadow beside  him, felt a thrill in his nerves, a prickling in his cheeks, at that  mysterious cry, which seemed to him to have something almost of menace  in its lure. Even so, he thought, might Pan have summoned his  followers, shaggy and dangerous, yet half divine, to some symbolic  revel.    The call evoked no answer of any kind. Jabe waited till the moon,  still red and distorted, had risen almost clear of the ridge. Then he  called again, and yet again, and again waited. From straight across  the strangely-shadowed water came a sudden sharp crashing of  underbrush, as if some one had fallen to beating the bushes furiously  with sticks.    \"That's him!\" whispered Jabe. \"An' he's a big one, sure!\"    The words were not yet out of his mouth when there arose a most  startling commotion in the thicket close behind them, and both men  swung around like lightning, jerking up their rifles. At the same  instant came an elusive whiff of pungency on the chill.    \"Pooh! only a bear!\" muttered Jabe, as the commotion retreated in  haste.    \"Why, he was close upon us!\" remarked the visitor. \"I could have poked  him with my gun! Had he any special business with us, do you  suppose?\"    \"Took me for a cow moose, an' was jest a-goin' to swipe me!\" answered  Jabe, rather elated at the compliment which the bear had paid to his  counterfeit.    The Famous Hunter drew a breath of profound satisfaction.    \"I'll be hanged,\" he whispered, \"if your amiable New Brunswick  backwoods can't get up a thrill quite worthy of the African jungle!\"    \"St!\" admonished Jabe. \"He's a-comin'. An' mad, too! Thinks that  racket was another bull, gittin' ahead of 'im. Don't ye _breathe_ now,  no more!\" And raising the long bark, he called through it again, this  time more softly, more enticingly, but always with that indescribable  wildness, shyness and roughness rasping strangely through the note.  The hurried approach of the bull could be followed clearly around the  head of the lake. It stopped, and Jabe called again. In a minute or  two there came a brief, explosive, grunting reply--this time from a  point much nearer. The great bull had stopped his crashing progress  and was slipping his vast, impetuous bulk through the underbrush as  noiselessly as a weasel. The stillness was so perfect after that one  echoing response that the Famous Hunter turned a look of interrogation  upon Jabe's shadowy face. The latter breathed almost inaudibly: \"He's  a-comin'. He's nigh here!\" And the hunter clutched his rifle with that  fine, final thrill of unparalleled anticipation.    The moon was now well up, clear of the treetops and the discolouring  mists, hanging round and honey-yellow over the hump of the ridge. The  magic of the night deepened swiftly. The sandspit and the little  water-meadow stood forth unshadowed in the spectral glare. Far out in  the shine of the lake a fish jumped, splashing sharply. Then a twig  snapped in the dense growth beyond the water-meadow. Jabe furtively  lifted the bark, and mumbled in it caressingly. The next moment--so  suddenly and silently that it seemed as if he had taken instant shape  in the moonlight--appeared a gigantic moose, standing in the meadow,  his head held high, his nostrils sniffing arrogant inquiry. The  broadly-palmated antlers crowning his mighty head were of a spread and  symmetry such as Jabe had never even imagined.    Almost imperceptibly the Hunter raised his rifle--a slender shadow  moving in paler shadows. The great bull, gazing about expectantly for  the mate who had called, stood superb and indomitable, ghost-gray in  the moonlight, a mark no tyro could miss. A cherry branch intervened,  obscuring the foresight of the Hunter's rifle. The Hunter shifted his  position furtively. His crooked finger was just about to tighten on  the trigger. At this moment, when the very night hung stiller as if  with a sense of crisis, the giant bull turned, exposing his left flank  to the full glare of the moonlight. Something gleamed silver down his  side, as if it were a shining belt thrown across his shoulder.    [Illustration: \"SOMETHING GLEAMED SILVER DOWN HIS SIDE.\"]    With a sort of hiss from between his teeth Jabe shot out his long arm  and knocked up the barrel of the rifle. In the same instant the  Hunter's finger had closed on the trigger. The report rang out,  shattering the night; the bullet whined away high over the treetops,  and the great bull, springing at one bound far back into the thickets,  vanished like an hallucination.    Jabe stood forth into the open, his gaunt face working with suppressed  excitement. The Hunter followed, speechless for a moment between  amazement, wrath and disappointment. At last he found voice, and quite  forgot his wonted courtesy.    \"D--n you!\" he stammered. \"What do you mean by that? What in----\"    But Jabe, suddenly calm, turned and eyed him with a steadying gaze.    \"Quit all that, now!\" he retorted crisply. \"I knowed _jest_ what I was  doin'! I knowed that bull when he were a leetle, awkward staggerer. I  brung him up on a bottle; an' I loved him. He skun out four years ago.  I'd most ruther 'ave seen _you_ shot than that ther' bull, I tell  ye!\"    The Famous Hunter looked sour; but he was beginning to understand the  situation, and his anger died down. As he considered, Jabe, too,  began to see the other side of the situation.    \"I'm right sorry to disapp'int ye so!\" he went on apologetically.  \"We'll hev to call off this deal atween you an' me, I reckon. An'  there ain't goin' to be no more shooting over _this_ range, if I kin  help it--an' I guess I kin!--till I kin git that ther' white-slashed  bull drove away back over on to the Upsalquitch, where the hunters  won't fall foul of him! But I'll git ye another guide, jest as good as  me, or better, what ain't got no particular friends runnin' loose in  the woods to bother 'im. An' I'll send ye 'way down on to the Sevogle,  where ther's as big heads to be shot as ever have been. I can't do  more.\"    \"Yes, you can!\" declared the Famous Hunter, who had quite recovered  his self-possession.    \"What is it?\" asked Jabe doubtfully.    \"You can pardon me for losing my temper and swearing at you!\" answered  the Famous Hunter, holding out his hand. \"I'm glad I didn't knock over  your magnificent friend. It's good for the breed that he got off. But  you'll have to find me something peculiarly special now, down on that  Sevogle.\"          WHEN THE BLUEBERRIES ARE RIPE      THE steep, rounded, rock-scarred face of Bald Mountain, for all its  naked grimness, looked very cheerful in the last of the warm-coloured  sunset. There were no trees; but every little hollow, every tiny  plateau, every bit of slope that was not too steep for clinging roots  to find hold, was clothed with a mat of blueberry bushes. The berries,  of an opaque violet-blue tone (much more vivid and higher in key than  the same berries can show when picked and brought to market) were so  large and so thickly crowded as to almost hide the leaves. They gave  the austere steeps of \"Old Baldy\" the effect of having been dyed with  a wash of cobalt.    Far below, where the lonely wilderness valley was already forsaken  by the sun, a flock of ducks could be seen, with long, outstretched  necks rigid and short wings swiftly beating, lined out over a  breadth of wild meadow. Above the lake which washed the foot of  the mountain,--high above the water, but below the line of shadow  creeping up the mountain's face,--a single fish-hawk circled  slowly, waiting for the twilight coolness to bring the big trout to  the surface to feed. The smooth water glimmered pallidly, and here  and there a spreading, circular ripple showed that the hungry fish  were beginning to rise.    Up in the flood of the sunset, the blueberries basked and glowed, some  looking like gems, some like blossoms, according to the fall of the  light. Around the shoulder of the mountain toward the east, where the  direct rays of the sun could not reach, the light was yet abundant,  but cool and tender,--and here the vivid berries were beginning to  lose their colour, as a curved moon, just rising over the far, ragged  rim of the forest, touched them with phantom silver. Everywhere  jutting rocks and sharp crevices broke the soft mantle of the  blueberry thickets; and on the southerly slope, where sunset and  moonrise mingled with intricate shadows, everything looked ghostlike  and unreal. On the utmost summit of the mountain a rounded peak of  white granite, smoothed by ages of storm, shone like a beacon.    [Illustration: \"AN OLD SHE-BEAR WITH TWO HALF-GROWN CUBS.\"]    The only berry-pickers that came to these high slopes of Bald Mountain  were the wild kindreds, furred and feathered. Of them all, none were  more enthusiastic and assiduous than the bears; and just now, climbing  up eagerly from the darkening woods below, came an old she-bear with  two half-grown cubs. They came up by easy paths, zigzagging past  boulder and crevice, through the ghostly, noiseless contention of  sunlight and moonlight. Now their moving shadows lay one way, now the  other; and now their shadows were suddenly wiped out, as the two  lights for a moment held an even balance. At length having reached a  little plateau where the berries were particularly large and  close-clustered, the old bear stopped, and they fell joyously to their  feeding.    On these open heights there were no enemies to keep watch against, and  there was no reason to be wary or silent. The bears fed noisily,  therefore, stripping the plump fruit cleverly by the pawful, and  munching with little, greedy grunts of delight. There was no other  food quite so to their taste as these berries, unless, perhaps, a  well-filled honey-comb. And this was their season for eating, "]]]
