The general aspect of the city is Moorish, as it was built at a time  when the Moorish style prevailed in Spanish architecture. The houses  are large, generally of stone, and one story in height, with balconies  to the windows and large courtyards. In the centre of the city stands  the plaza major, a square of about six hundred feet. The whole of the  east side is occupied by the cathedral and the bishop's palace. On the  west stand the house of the municipality and that of the Dona Joaquina  Peon. On the north is the palace of the government, and on the south a  building which on our first visit arrested our attention the moment we  entered the plaza. It is distinguished by a rich sculptured facade of  curious design and workmanship. In it is a stone with this inscription:                           Esta obra mando hacerla el                     Adelantado D. Francisco de Montejo                               Ano de MDXLIX.          The Adelantado Don Francisco Montejo caused this to be made                             in the year 1549.    The subject represents two knights in armour, with visors,  breastplates, and helmets, standing upon the shoulders of crushed naked  figures, probably intended to represent the conquering Spaniard  trampling upon the Indian. Mr. Catherwood attempted to make a drawing  of it, and, to avoid the heat of the sun, went into the plaza at  daylight for that purpose; but he was so annoyed by the crowd that he  was obliged to give it up. There is reason to believe that it is a  combination of Spanish and Indian art. The design is certainly Spanish,  but as, at that early period of the conquest, but five years after the  foundation of Merida, Spaniards were but few, and each man considered  himself a conqueror, probably there were none who practised the  mechanic arts. The execution was no doubt the work of Indians, and  perhaps the carving was done with their own instruments, and not those  furnished them by the Spaniards.    The history of the erection of this building would be interesting and  instructive; and, with the hope of learning something about it, I  proposed to examine thoroughly the archives of the cabildo; but I was  advised that all the early archives were lost, or in such confusion  that it would be a Herculean labour to explore them, and I saw that it  would consume more time than I should be able to devote to it.    Besides the inscription on the stone, the only information that exists  in regard to this building is a statement in Cogolludo, that the facade  cost fourteen thousand dollars. It is now the property of Don Simon  Peon, and is occupied by his family. It has been lately repaired, and  some of the beams are no doubt the same which held up the roof over the  adelantado.    Eight streets lead from the plaza, two in the direction of each  cardinal point. In every street, at the distance of a few squares, is a  gate, now dismantled, and beyond are the barrios, or suburbs.    The streets are distinguished in a manner peculiar to Yucatan. In the  angle of the corner house, and on the top, stands a painted wooden  figure of an elephant, a bull, a flamingo, or some other visible  object, and the street is called by the name of this object. On one  corner there is the figure of an old woman with large spectacles on her  nose, and the street is called la Calle de la Vieja, or the Street of  the Old Woman. That in which we lived had on the corner house a  flamingo, and was called the Street of the Flamingo; and the reason of  the streets being named in this way gives some idea of the character of  the people. The great mass of the inhabitants, universally the Indians,  cannot read. Printed signs would be of no use, but every Indian knows  the sign of an elephant, a bull, or a flamingo.    In the front wall of a house in a street running north from the plaza,  and also in a corner house near the square of the Alameda, are  sculptured figures from the ruins of ancient buildings, of which Mr.  Catherwood made drawings, but, in the multiplicity of other subjects,  we do not think it worth while to present them to the reader.    The great distinguishing feature of Merida, as of all the cities of  Spanish America, is in its churches. The great Cathedral; the parish  church and convent of San Cristoval; the church of the Jesuits; the  church and convent of the Mejorada; the chapels of San Juan Bautista;  of Our Lady of Candelaria; of the Santa Lucia and the Virgin, and the  convent de las monjas, or the nunnery, with its church and enclosures  occupying two whole squares, are all interesting in their history. Some  are of good style in architecture, and rich in ornaments; but there is  one other, not yet mentioned, which I regard as the most interesting  and remarkable edifice in Merida. It is the old Franciscan convent. It  stands on an eminence in the eastern part of the city, and is enclosed  by a high wall, with turrets, forming what is now called the Castillo.  These walls and turrets are still erect, but within is ruin  irretrievable.    In 1820 the new constitution obtained by the patriots in Spain reached  the colonies, and on the 30th of May Don Juan Rivas Vertiz, then Gefe  Politico, and now living in Merida, a fine memorial of the olden time,  published it in the plaza. The church sustained the old order of  things, and the Franciscan friars, confident in their hold upon the  feelings of the populace, endeavoured to put down the demonstration of  liberal feeling. A mob gathered in the plaza; friars appeared among  them, urging them on; field-pieces were brought out, the mob dispersed,  and Don Juan Rivas marched to the Franciscan convent, opened the doors,  drove out the monks, above 300 in number, at the point of the bayonet,  and gave up the building to destruction. The superior and some of the  brothers became seculars or regular priests; others turned to worldly  pursuits; and of this once powerful order, but eleven are now left who  wear the garb of the Franciscan monks.    It was in company with one of these that I paid my last visit to this  convent. We entered by the great portal of the castle wall into an  overgrown courtyard. In front was the convent, with its large corridors  and two great churches, the walls of all three standing, but without  doors or windows. The roof of one of the churches had fallen, and the  broad glare of day was streaming into the interior. We entered the  other--the oldest, and identified with the times of the conquerors.  Near the door was a blacksmith's forge. A Mestizo was blowing at the  bellows, hauling out a red-hot bar of iron, and hammering it into  spikes. All along the floor were half-naked Indians and brawny  Mestizoes, hewing timber, driving nails, and carrying on the business  of making gun-carriages for artillery. The altars were thrown down and  the walls defaced; half way up were painted on them, in coarse and  staring red characters (in Spanish), \"First squadron,\" \"Second  squadron;\" and at the head of the church, under a golden gloria, were  the words \"Comp'y Light Infantry.\" The church had been occupied as  barracks, and these were the places where they stacked their arms. As  we passed through, the workmen stared at my companion, or rather at the  long blue gown, the cord around his waist, and the cross dangling from  it--the garb of his scattered order. It was the first time he had  visited the place since the expulsion of the monks. To me it was  mournful to behold the destruction and desecration of this noble  building; what, then, must it have been to him? In the floor of the  church near the altar and in the sacristia were open vaults, but the  bones of the monks had been thrown out and scattered on the floor. Some  of these were the bones of his earliest friends. We passed into the  refectory, and he pointed out the position of the long table at which  the brotherhood took their meals, and the stone fountain at which they  performed their ablutions. His old companions in their long blue gowns  rose up before him, now scattered forever, and their home a desolation  and ruin.    But this convent contains one memorial far more interesting than any  connected with its own ruin; one that carries the beholder back through  centuries of time, and tells the story of a greater and a sadder fall.    In one of the lower cloisters going out from the north, and under the  principal dormitory, are two parallel corridors. The outer one faces  the principal patio, and this corridor has that peculiar arch so often  referred to in my previous volumes, two sides rising to meet each  other, and covered, when within about a foot of forming an apex, by a  flat layer of stones. There can be no mistake about the character of  this arch; it cannot for a moment be supposed that the Spaniards  constructed anything so different from their known rules of  architecture; and beyond doubt it formed part of one of those  mysterious buildings which have given rise to so much speculation; the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3317"],[0,"Now It Can Be Told (#14)"],[1,"them--not always jolly, if they happened  to be a class above their fellows, a moral peg above foul-mouthed  slum-dwellers and men of filthy habits, but splendid if they were in  their own crowd of decent, laughter-loving, companionable lads. Eleven  months' training! Were they ever going to the front? The war would be  over before they landed in France... Then, at last, they came.          III      It was not until July of 1915 that the Commander-in-Chief announced  that a part of the New Army was in France, and lifted the veil from the  secret which had mystified people at home whose boys had gone from them,  but who could not get a word of their doings in France.    I saw the first of the \"Kitchener men,\" as we called them then. The  tramp of their feet in a steady scrunch, scrunch, along a gritty road of  France, passed the window of my billet very early in the mornings, and I  poked my head out to get another glimpse of those lads marching forward  to the firing-line. For as long as history lasts the imagination of our  people will strive to conjure up the vision of those boys who, in the  year of 1915, went out to Flanders, not as conscript soldiers, but as  volunteers, for the old country's sake, to take their risks and \"do  their bit\" in the world's bloodiest war. I saw those fellows day by day,  touched hands with them, went into the trenches with them, heard their  first tales, and strolled into their billets when they had shaken down  for a night or two within sound of the guns. History will envy me that,  this living touch with the men who, beyond any doubt, did in their  simple way act and suffer things before the war ended which revealed  new wonders of human courage and endurance. Some people envied me  then--those people at home to whom those boys belonged, and who in  country towns and villages and suburban houses would have given their  hearts to get one look at them there in Flanders and to see the way of  their life... How were they living? How did they like it? How were they  sleeping? What did the Regulars think of the New Army?    \"Oh, a very cheerful lot,\" said a sergeant-major of the old Regular  type, who was having a quiet pipe over a half-penny paper in a shed  at the back of some farm buildings in the neighborhood of Armentieres,  which had been plugged by two hundred German shells that time the day  before. (One never knew when the fellows on the other side would take it  into their heads to empty their guns that way. They had already killed a  lot of civilians thereabouts, but the others stayed on.)    \"Not a bit of trouble with them,\" said the sergeant-major, \"and all  as keen as when they grinned into a recruiting office and said, `I'm  going.' They're glad to be out. Over-trained, some of 'em. For ten  months we've been working 'em pretty hard. Had to, but they were willing  enough. Now you couldn't find a better battalion, though some more  famous... Till we get our chance, you know.\"    He pointed with the stem of his pipe to the open door of an old barn,  where a party of his men were resting.    \"You'll find plenty of hot heads among them, but no cold feet. I'll bet  on that.\"    The men were lying on a stone floor with haversacks for pillows, or  squatting tailor-wise, writing letters home. From a far corner came a  whistling trio, harmonized in a tune which for some reason made me think  of hayfields in southern England.    They belonged to a Sussex battalion, and I said, \"Any one here from  Burpham?\"    One of the boys sat up, stared, flushed to the roots of his yellow hair,  and said, \"Yes.\"    I spoke to him of people I knew there, and he was astonished that I  should know them. Distressed also in a queer way. Those memories of a  Sussex village seemed to break down some of the hardness in which he had  cased himself. I could see a frightful homesickness in his blue eyes.    \"P'raps I've seed the last o' Burpham,\" he said in a kind of whisper, so  that the other men should not hear.    The other men were from Arundel, Littlehampton, and Sussex villages.  They were of Saxon breed. There was hardly a difference between them  and some German prisoners I saw, yellow-haired as they were, with fair,  freckled, sun-baked skins. They told me they were glad to be out in  France. Anything was better than training at home.    \"I like Germans more'n sergeant-majors,\" said one young yokel, and the  others shouted with laughter at his jest.    \"Perhaps you haven't met the German sergeants,\" I said.    \"I've met our'n,\" said the Sussex boy. \"A man's a fool to be a soldier.  Eh, lads?\"    They agreed heartily, though they were all volunteers.    \"Not that we're skeered,\" said one of them. \"We'll be glad when the  fighting begins.\"    \"Speak for yourself, Dick Meekcombe, and don't forget the shells last  night.\"    There was another roar of laughter. Those boys of the South Saxons  were full of spirit. In their yokel way they were disguising their real  thoughts--their fear of being afraid, their hatred of the thought of  death--very close to them now--and their sense of strangeness in this  scene on the edge of Armentieres, a world away from their old life.    The colonel sat in a little room at headquarters, a bronzed man with  a grizzled mustache and light-blue eyes, with a fine tenderness in his  smile.    \"These boys of mine are all right,\" he said. \"They're dear fellows, and  ready for anything. Of course, it was anxious work at first, but my N.  C. O.'s are a first-class lot, and we're ready for business.\"    He spoke of the recruiting task which had begun the business eleven  months ago. It had not been easy, among all those scattered villages of  the southern county. He had gone hunting among the farms and cottages  for likely young fellows. They were of good class, and he had picked the  lads of intelligence, and weeded out the others. They came from a  good stock--the yeoman breed. One could not ask for better stuff. The  officers were men of old county families, and they knew their men.  That was a great thing. So far they had been very lucky with regard to  casualties, though it was unfortunate that a company commander, a fine  fellow who had been a schoolmaster and a parson, should have been picked  off by a sniper on his first day out.    The New Army had received its baptism of fire, though nothing very  fierce as yet. They were led on in easy stages to the danger-zone. It  was not fair to plunge them straight away into the bad places. But the  test of steadiness was good enough on a dark night behind the reserve  trenches, when the reliefs had gone up, and there was a bit of digging  to do in the open.    \"Quiet there, boys,\" said the sergeant-major. \"And no larks.\"    It was not a larky kind of place or time. There was no moon, and a light  drizzle of rain fell. The enemy's trenches were about a thousand yards  away, and their guns were busy in the night, so that the shells came  overhead, and lads who had heard the owls hoot in English woods now  heard stranger night-birds crying through the air, with the noise of  rushing wings, ending in a thunderclap.    \"And my old mother thinks I'm enjoying myself!\" said the heir to a  seaside lodging-house.    \"Thirsty work, this grave-digging job,\" said a lad who used to skate on  rollers between the bath-chairs of Brighton promenade.    \"Can't see much in those shells,\" said a young man who once sold ladies'  blouses in an emporium of a south coast village. \"How those newspaper  chaps do try to frighten us!\"    He put his head on one side with a sudden jerk.    \"What's that? Wasps?\"    A number of insects were flying overhead with a queer, sibilant noise.  Somewhere in the darkness there was a steady rattle in the throat of a  beast.    \"What's that, Sergeant?\"    \"Machine-gums, my child. Keep your head down, or you'll lose hold of  it... Steady, there. Don't get jumpy, now!\"    The machine-gun was firing too high to do any serious damage. It was  probably a ricochet from a broken tree which made one of the boys  suddenly drop his spade and fall over it in a crumpled way.    \"Get up, Charlie,\" said the comrade next to him; and then, in a scared  voice, \"Oh, Sergeant!\"    \"That's all right,\" said the sergeant-major. \"We're getting off very  lightly. New remember what I've been telling you... Stretcher this way.\"    They were very steady through the night, this first company of the New  Army.    \"Like old soldiers, sir,\" said the sergeant-major, when he stood  chatting with the colonel after breakfast.    It was a bit of bad luck, though not very bad, after all--which made the  Germans shell a hamlet into which I went just as some of the New Army  were marching through to their quarters. These men had already seen  what shellfire could do to knock the beauty out of old houses and quiet  streets. They had gone tramping through one or two villages to which  the enemy's guns had turned their attention, and had received that  unforgetable sensation of one's first sight of roofless cottages, and  great gaps in garden walls, and tall houses which have tumbled inside  themselves. But now they saw this destruction in the process, and stood  very still, listening to the infernal clatter as shells burst at the  other end of the street, tumbling down huge masses of masonry and  plugging holes into neat cottages, and tearing great gashes out of  red-brick walls.    \"Funny business!\" said one of the boys.    \"Regular Drury Lane melodrama,\" said another.    \"Looks as if some of us wouldn't be home in time for lunch,\" was another  comment, greeted by a guffaw along the line.    They tried to see the humor of it, though there was a false note in  some of the jokes. But it was the heroic falsity of boys whose pride  is stronger than their fear, that inevitable fear which chills one when  this beastliness is being done.    \"Not a single casualty,\" said one of the officers when the storm of  shells ended with a few last concussions and a"]]]
