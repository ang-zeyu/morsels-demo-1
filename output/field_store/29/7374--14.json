Slowly she turned to leave  the place. But after she had taken a few steps she stopped and burst  into sobs. How could she go away without a glimpse of the Heavenly  Child? Then, as she stood weeping, a marvelous thing happened. An  angel appeared beside her and said:    \"Lo, here at thy feet is a gift for the Christ-child.\"    Then she saw growing near her, slender stems covered with delicate  green leaves and bearing lovely flowers.    The maiden did not stop to wonder. Here was a gift fit to offer the  little Saviour. With trembling joy she gathered the Christmas roses  and stepped lightly into the humble house where the little babe lay  smiling in his mother's arms. In Mary's lap the maiden laid her gift  of flowers, and, with radiant face, she knelt and filled her heart  with the glorious vision.          CHRISTMAS GIFTS    Laura E. Richards      \"Mother,\" said Jack, \"may I have some money to buy Christmas presents  with?\"    \"Dear,\" said his mother, \"I have no money. We are very poor, and I can  hardly buy enough food for us all.\"    Jack hung his head; if he had not been ten the tears would have come  to his eyes, but he was ten.    \"All the other boys give presents!\" he said.    \"So shall you!\" said his mother. \"All presents are not bought with  money. The best boy that ever lived was as poor as we are, and yet He  was always giving.\"    \"Who was He,\" asked Jack; \"and what did He give?\"    \"This is His birthday,\" said the mother. \"He was the good Jesus. He  was born in a stable, and He lived in a poor working-man's house. He  never had a penny of His own, yet he gave twelve good gifts every day.  Would you like to try His way?\"    \"Yes!\" cried Jack.    So his mother told him this and that; and soon after Jack started out,  dressed in his best suit, to give his presents.    First, he went to Aunt Jane's house. She was old and lame, and she did  not like boys.    \"What do you want?\" she asked.    \"Merry Christmas!\" said Jack. \"May I stay for an hour and help you?\"    \"Humph!\" said Aunt Jane. \"Want to keep you out of mischief, do they?  Well, you may bring in some wood.\"    \"Shall I split some kindling, too?\" asked Jack.    \"If you know how,\" said Aunt Jane. \"I can't have you cutting your foot  and messing my clean shed all up.\"    Jack found some fresh pine wood and a bright hatchet, and he split up  a great pile of kindling and thought it fun. He stacked it neatly, and  then brought in a pail of fresh water and filled the kettle.    \"What else can I do?\" he asked. \"There are twenty minutes more.\"    \"Humph!\" said Aunt Jane. \"You might feed the pig.\"    Jack fed the pig, who thanked him in his own way.    \"Ten minutes more!\" he said. \"What shall I do now?\"    \"Humph!\" said Aunt Jane. \"You may sit down and tell me why you came.\"    \"It is a Christmas present!\" said Jack. \"I am giving hours for  presents. I had twelve, but I gave one to mother, and another one was  gone before I knew I had it. This hour was your present.\"    \"Humph!\" said Aunt Jane. She hobbled to the cupboard and took out a  small round pie that smelt very good. \"Here!\" she said. \"This is  _your_ present, and I thank you for mine. Come again, will you?\"    \"Indeed I will,\" said Jack, \"and thank you for the pie!\"    Next Jack went and read for an hour to old Mr. Green, who was blind.  He read a book about the sea, and they both liked it very much, so  the hour went quickly. Then it was time to help mother get dinner, and  then time to eat it; that took two hours, and Aunt Jane's pie was  wonderful. Then Jack took the Smith baby for a ride in its carriage,  as Mrs. Smith was ill, and they met its grandfather, who filled Jack's  pockets with candy and popcorn and invited him to a Christmas tree  that night.    Next Jack went to see Willy Brown, who had been ill for a long time  and could not leave his bed. Willy was very glad to see him; they  played a game, and then each told the other a story, and before Jack  knew it the clock struck six.    \"Oh!\" cried Jack. \"You have had two!\"    \"Two what?\" asked Willy.    \"Two hours!\" said Jack; and he told Willy about the presents he was  giving. \"I am glad I gave you two,\" he said, \"and I would give you  three, but I must go and help mother.\"    \"Oh, dear!\" said Willy. \"I thank you very much, Jack. I have had a  perfectly great time; but I have nothing to give you.\"    Jack laughed. \"Why, don't you see?\" he cried; \"you have given me just  the same thing. I have had a great time, too.\"    \"Mother,\" said Jack, as he was going to bed, \"I have had a splendid  Christmas, but I wish I had had something to give you besides the  hours.\"    \"My darling,\" said his mother, \"you have given me the best gift of  all--yourself!\"          SILVER BELLS          Across the snow the Silver Bells        Come near and yet more near;      Each Day and Night, each Night and Day        They tinkle soft and clear.        'Tis Father Christmas on his way        Across the winter Snows;      While on his sleigh the Silver Bells        Keep chiming as he goes.        I listen for them in the Night,        I listen all the Day,      I think these merry Silver Bells        Are long, long on the way!                            Hamish Hendry.          THE ANIMALS' CHRISTMAS TREE    John P. Peters      Once upon a time the animals decided to have a Christmas tree, and  this was how it came about: The swifts and the swallows in the  chimneys in the country houses, awakened from their sleep by joy and  laughter, had stolen down and peeped in upon scenes of happiness, the  center of which was always an evergreen tree covered with wonderful  fruit, bright balls of many colours, and sparkling threads of gold and  silver, lying like beautiful frost-work among the green fir needles. A  sweet, fairy-like figure of a Christ Child or an angel rested high  among the branches, and underneath the tree were dolls and sleds and  skates and drums and toys of every sort, and furs and gloves and  tippets, ribbons and handkerchiefs, and all the things that boys and  girls need and like; and all about this tree were gathered always  little children with faces--oh! so full of wonderment and expectation,  changing to radiant, sparkling merriment as toys and candies were  taken off the tree or from underneath its boughs and distributed among  them.    The swifts and swallows told their feathered friends all about it, and  they told others, both birds and animals, until at last it began to be  rumoured through all the animal world that on one day in the year the  children of men were made wonderfully happy by means of some sort of  festival which they held about a fir tree from the forest. Now, of  course, the tame animals and the house animals, the dogs and the cats  and the mice, knew something more about this festival. But then, they  did not exchange visits with the wild animals, because they felt  themselves above them.    They were always trying to be like men and women, you know, putting on  airs and pretending to know everything; but, after all, they were  animals and could not help making friendships now and then with the  wild creatures, especially when the men and women were not there. And  when they were asked about the Christmas tree, they told still more  wonderful stories than the swifts and the swallows from the chimneys  had told, for some of them had taken part in these festivals, and some  had even received presents from the tree, just like the children.    They said that the tree was called a Christmas tree, because that  strange fruit and that wonderful frosting came on it only in the  Christmas time, and that the Christmas time was the time when men and  women and little children, too, were always kind and good and loving,  and gave things to one another; and they said, moreover, that on the  Christmas tree grew the things which every one wanted, and which would  make them happy, and that it was so, because in the Christmas time  everyone was trying to make everyone else happy and to think of what  other people would like. This they said was what they had seen and  heard told about Christmas trees. They did not quite understand why it  was so, but they knew that the Christmas tree, when rightly made,  brought the Christmas spirit, and they had heard men say that the  Christmas spirit was the great thing, and that that was what made  everyone happy.    Well, the long and the short of it was that the animals talked of it  in their dens and on their roosts, in the fields, and in the forests,  wild beasts and tame alike--the cows and the horses in their stalls,  the sheep in their fold, the doves in their cotes and the poultry in  the poultry-yard, until all agreed that a Christmas tree would be a  grand thing for the wild and tame alike. Like the men, they, too,  would have a tree of their very own. But how to do it?    Then the lion called a meeting of all the creatures, wild and tame;  for you know the lion is king of beasts and when he calls they all  must come. You know, too, that before and during and after these  animal congresses there is a royal peace. The lamb can come to the  meeting and sit down by the wolf, and the wolf dare not touch him; the  dove may perch on the bough between the hawk and the owl and neither  will harm him, when the great king of beasts has summoned them all  together to take counsel. But you know all about the rules of the  animals, for you have read them in books, and you have seen the  pictures: how the lion sits on his throne with a crown on one side of  his head, and all the other creatures gather about--the elephant, and  giraffe, the hippopotamus, the buffalo, wolves and tigers and  leopards, foxes and deer, goats and sheep, monkeys and orang-outangs,  parrots and robins and turkeys and swans and storks and eagles and  frogs and lizards and alligators, and all the rest besides."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3458"],[0,"Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures (#14)"],[1,"will correct the discord, and teach us          life's sweeter harmonies.            Soul has infinite resources with which to bless mankind,  60:30   and happiness would be more readily attained and would          be more secure in our keeping, if sought in Soul. Higher          enjoyments alone can satisfy the cravings of immortal  61:1    man. We cannot circumscribe happiness within the          limits of personal sense. The senses confer no real  61:3    enjoyment.                               Ascendency of good            The good in human affections must have ascendency          over the evil and the spiritual over the animal, or happi-  61:6    ness will never be won. The attainment of          this celestial condition would improve our          progeny, diminish crime, and give higher aims to ambi-  61:9    tion. Every valley of sin must be exalted, and every          mountain of selfishness be brought low, that the highway          of our God may be prepared in Science. The offspring  61:12   of heavenly-minded parents inherit more intellect, better          balanced minds, and sounder constitutions.                             Propensities inherited            If some fortuitous circumstance places promising chil-  61:15   dren in the arms of gross parents, often these beautiful          children early droop and die, like tropical          flowers born amid Alpine snows. If perchance  61:18   they live to become parents in their turn, they may re-          produce in their own helpless little ones the grosser traits          of their ancestors. What hope of happiness, what noble  61:21   ambition, can inspire the child who inherits propensities          that must either be overcome or reduce him to a loath-          some wreck?    61:24   Is not the propagation of the human species a greater          responsibility, a more solemn charge, than the culture of          your garden or the raising of stock to increase your flocks  61:27   and herds? Nothing unworthy of perpetuity should be          transmitted to children.            The formation of mortals must greatly improve to  61:30   advance mankind. The scientific /morale/ of marriage is          spiritual unity. If the propagation of a higher human          species is requisite to reach this goal, then its material con-  62:1    ditions can only be permitted for the purpose of gener-          ating. The foetus must be kept mentally pure and the  62:3    period of gestation have the sanctity of virginity.            The entire education of children should be such as to          form habits of obedience to the moral and spiritual law,  62:6    with which the child can meet and master the belief in so-          called physical laws, a belief which breeds disease.                               Inheritance heeded            If parents create in their babes a desire for incessant  62:9    amusement, to be always fed, rocked, tossed, or talked          to, those parents should not, in after years,          complain of their children's fretfulness or fri-  62:12   volity, which the parents themselves have occasioned.          Taking less \"thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or          what ye shall drink\"; less thought \"for your body what  62:15   ye shall put on,\" will do much more for the health of the          rising generation than you dream. Children should be          allowed to remain children in knowledge, and should  62:18   become men and women only through growth in the          understanding of man's higher nature.                                The Mind creative            We must not attribute more and more intelligence  62:21   to matter, but less and less, if we would be wise and          healthy. The divine Mind, which forms the          bud and blossom, will care for the human  62:24   body, even as it clothes the lily; but let no mortal inter-          fere with God's government by thrusting in the laws of          erring, human concepts.                              Superior law of Soul    62:27   The higher nature of man is not governed by the lower;          if it were, the order of wisdom would be reversed.          Our false views of life hide eternal harmony,  62:30   and produce the ills of which we complain.          Because mortals believe in material laws and reject the          Science of Mind, this does not make materiality first and  63:1    the superior law of Soul last. You would never think          that flannel was better for warding off pulmonary disease  63:3    than the controlling Mind, if you understood the Science          of being.                                Spiritual origin            In Science man is the offspring of Spirit. The beauti-  63:6    ful, good, and pure constitute his ancestry. His origin is          not, like that of mortals, in brute instinct, nor          does he pass through material conditions prior  63:9    to reaching intelligence. Spirit is his primitive and ulti-          mate source of being; God is his Father, and Life is the          law of his being.                               The rights of woman    63:12   Civil law establishes very unfair differences between the          rights of the two sexes. Christian Science furnishes no          precedent for such injustice, and civilization  63:15   mitigates it in some measure. Still, it is a          marvel why usage should accord woman less rights than          does either Christian Science or civilization.                              Unfair discrimination    63:18   Our laws are not impartial, to say the least, in their          discrimination as to the person, property, and parental          claims of the two sexes. If the elective fran-  63:21   chise for women will remedy the evil with-          out encouraging difficulties of greater magnitude, let us          hope it will be granted. A feasible as well as rational  63:24   means of improvement at present is the elevation of          society in general and the achievement of a nobler          race for legislation, - a race having higher aims and  63:27   motives.            If a dissolute husband deserts his wife, certainly the          wronged, and perchance impoverished, woman should be  63:30   allowed to collect her own wages, enter into business          agreements, hold real estate, deposit funds, and own her          children free from interference.    64:1    Want of uniform justice is a crying evil caused by the          selfishness and inhumanity of man. Our forefathers  64:3    exercised their faith in the direction taught by the Apostle          James, when he said: \"Pure religion and undefiled before          God and the Father, is this, To visit the fatherless and  64:6    widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted          from the world.\"                              Benevolence hindered            Pride, envy, or jealousy seems on most occasions to  64:9    be the master of ceremonies, ruling out primitive Chris-          tianity. When a man lends a helping hand          to some noble woman, struggling alone with  64:12   adversity, his wife should not say, \"It is never well to          interfere with your neighbor's business.\" A wife is          sometimes debarred by a covetous domestic tyrant from  64:15   giving the ready aid her sympathy and charity would          afford.                             Progressive development            Marriage should signify a union of hearts. Further-  64:18   more, the time cometh of which Jesus spake, when he          declared that in the resurrection there should          be no more marrying nor giving in marriage,  64:21   but man would be as the angels. Then shall Soul re-          joice in its own, in which passion has no part. Then          white-robed purity will unite in one person masculine wis-  64:24   dom and feminine love, spiritual understanding and per-          petual peace.            Until it is learned that God is the Father of all, mar-  64:27   riage will continue. Let not mortals permit a disregard          of law which might lead to a worse state of society than          now exists. Honesty and virtue ensure the stability of  64:30   the marriage covenant. Spirit will ultimately claim its          own, - all that really is, - and the voices of physical          sense will be forever hushed.                               Blessing of Christ    65:1    Experience should be the school of virtue, and human          happiness should proceed from man's highest nature.  65:3    May Christ, Truth, be present at every bridal          altar to turn the water into wine and to give to          human life an inspiration by which man's spiritual and  65:6    eternal existence may be discerned.                              Righteous foundations            If the foundations of human affection are consistent          with progress, they will be strong and enduring. Divorces  65:9    should warn the age of some fundamental error          in the marriage state. The union of the sexes          suffers fearful discord. To gain Christian Science and its  65:12   harmony, life should be more metaphysically regarded.                               Powerless promises            The broadcast powers of evil so conspicuous to-day          show themselves in the materialism and sensualism of  65:15   the age, struggling against the advancing          spiritual era. Beholding the world's lack of          Christianity and the powerlessness of vows to make home  65:18   happy, the human mind will at length demand a higher          affection.                              Transition and reform            There will ensue a fermentation over this as over many  65:21   other reforms, until we get at last the clear straining of          truth, and impurity and error are left among          the lees. The fermentation even of fluids is  65:24   not pleasant. An unsettled, transitional stage is never"]]]
