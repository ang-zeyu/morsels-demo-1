[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44"],[0,"The Song of the Lark (#14)"],[1," he found that Thea  had not forgotten to take it with her. He smiled his loose, sarcastic  smile, and thoughtfully rubbed his stubbly chin with his red fingers.  When Fritz came home in the early blue twilight the snow was flying  faster, Mrs. Kohler was cooking HASENPFEFFER in the kitchen, and the  professor was seated at the piano, playing the Gluck, which he knew by  heart. Old Fritz took off his shoes quietly behind the stove and lay  down on the lounge before his masterpiece, where the firelight was  playing over the walls of Moscow. He listened, while the room grew  darker and the windows duller. Wunsch always came back to the same  thing:--    \"ACH, ICH HABE SIE VERLOREN,...EURIDICE, EURIDICE!\"    From time to time Fritz sighed softly. He, too, had lost a Euridice.          XI    One Saturday, late in June, Thea arrived early for her lesson. As she  perched herself upon the piano stool,--a wobbly, old-fashioned thing  that worked on a creaky screw,--she gave Wunsch a side glance, smiling.  \"You must not be cross to me to-day. This is my birthday.\"    \"So?\" he pointed to the keyboard.    After the lesson they went out to join Mrs. Kohler, who had asked Thea  to come early, so that she could stay and smell the linden bloom. It was  one of those still days of intense light, when every particle of mica in  the soil flashed like a little mirror, and the glare from the plain  below seemed more intense than the rays from above. The sand ridges ran  glittering gold out to where the mirage licked them up, shining and  steaming like a lake in the tropics. The sky looked like blue lava,  forever incapable of clouds,--a turquoise bowl that was the lid of the  desert. And yet within Mrs. Kohler's green patch the water dripped, the  beds had all been hosed, and the air was fresh with rapidly evaporating  moisture.    The two symmetrical linden trees were the proudest things in the garden.  Their sweetness embalmed all the air. At every turn of the  paths,--whether one went to see the hollyhocks or the bleeding heart, or  to look at the purple morning-glories that ran over the  bean-poles,--wherever one went, the sweetness of the lindens struck one  afresh and one always came back to them. Under the round leaves, where  the waxen yellow blossoms hung, bevies of wild bees were buzzing. The  tamarisks were still pink, and the flower-beds were doing their best in  honor of the linden festival. The white dove-house was shining with a  fresh coat of paint, and the pigeons were crooning contentedly, flying  down often to drink at the drip from the water tank. Mrs. Kohler, who  was transplanting pansies, came up with her trowel and told Thea it was  lucky to have your birthday when the lindens were in bloom, and that she  must go and look at the sweet peas. Wunsch accompanied her, and as they  walked between the flower-beds he took Thea's hand.    \"ES FLUSTERN UND SPRECHEN DIE BLUMEN,\"--he muttered. \"You know that von  Heine? IM LEUCHTENDEN SOMMERMORGEN?\" He looked down at Thea and softly  pressed her hand.    \"No, I don't know it. What does FLUSTERN mean?\"    \"FLUSTERN?--to whisper. You must begin now to know such things. That is  necessary. How many birthdays?\"    \"Thirteen. I'm in my 'teens now. But how can I know words like that? I  only know what you say at my lessons. They don't teach German at school.  How can I learn?\"    \"It is always possible to learn when one likes,\" said Wunsch. His words  were peremptory, as usual, but his tone was mild, even confidential.  \"There is always a way. And if some day you are going to sing, it is  necessary to know well the German language.\"    Thea stooped over to pick a leaf of rosemary. How did Wunsch know that,  when the very roses on her wall-paper had never heard it? \"But am I  going to?\" she asked, still stooping.    \"That is for you to say,\" returned Wunsch coldly. \"You would better  marry some JACOB here and keep the house for him, may-be? That is as one  desires.\"    Thea flashed up at him a clear, laughing look. \"No, I don't want to do  that. You know,\" she brushed his coat sleeve quickly with her yellow  head. \"Only how can I learn anything here? It's so far from Denver.\"    Wunsch's loose lower lip curled in amusement. Then, as if he suddenly  remembered something, he spoke seriously. \"Nothing is far and nothing is  near, if one desires. The world is little, people are little, human life  is little. There is only one big thing--desire. And before it, when it  is big, all is little. It brought Columbus across the sea in a little  boat, UND SO WEITER.\" Wunsch made a grimace, took his pupil's hand and  drew her toward the grape arbor. \"Hereafter I will more speak to you in  German. Now, sit down and I will teach you for your birthday that little  song. Ask me the words you do not know already. Now: IM LEUCHTENDEN  SOMMERMORGEN.\"    Thea memorized quickly because she had the power of listening intently.  In a few moments she could repeat the eight lines for him. Wunsch nodded  encouragingly and they went out of the arbor into the sunlight again. As  they went up and down the gravel paths between the flowerbeds, the white  and yellow butterflies kept darting before them, and the pigeons were  washing their pink feet at the drip and crooning in their husky bass.  Over and over again Wunsch made her say the lines to him. \"You see it is  nothing. If you learn a great many of the LIEDER, you will know the  German language already. WEITER, NUN.\" He would incline his head gravely  and listen.           \"IM LEUCHTENDEN SOMMERMORGEN       GEH' ICH IM GARTEN HERUM;       ES FLUSTERN UND SPRECHEN DIE BLUMEN,       ICH ABER, ICH WANDTE STUMM.         \"ES FLUSTERN UND SPRECHEN DIE BLUMEN       UND SCHAU'N MITLEIDIG MICH AN:       'SEI UNSERER SCHWESTER NICHT BOSE,       DU TRAURIGER, BLASSER MANN!'\"           (In the soft-shining summer morning       I wandered the garden within.       The flowers they whispered and murmured,       But I, I wandered dumb.         The flowers they whisper and murmur,       And me with compassion they scan:       \"Oh, be not harsh to our sister,       Thou sorrowful, death-pale man!\")      Wunsch had noticed before that when his pupil read anything in verse the  character of her voice changed altogether; it was no longer the voice  which spoke the speech of Moonstone. It was a soft, rich contralto, and  she read quietly; the feeling was in the voice itself, not indicated by  emphasis or change of pitch. She repeated the little verses musically,  like a song, and the entreaty of the flowers was even softer than the  rest, as the shy speech of flowers might be, and she ended with the  voice suspended, almost with a rising inflection. It was a nature-voice,  Wunsch told himself, breathed from the creature and apart from language,  like the sound of the wind in the trees, or the murmur of water.    \"What is it the flowers mean when they ask him not to be harsh to their  sister, eh?\" he asked, looking down at her curiously and wrinkling his  dull red forehead.    Thea glanced at him in surprise. \"I suppose he thinks they are asking  him not to be harsh to his sweetheart--or some girl they remind him of.\"    \"And why TRAURIGER, BLASSER MANN?\"    They had come back to the grape arbor, and Thea picked out a sunny place  on the bench, where a tortoise-shell cat was stretched at full length.  She sat down, bending over the cat and teasing his whiskers. \"Because he  had been awake all night, thinking about her, wasn't it? Maybe that was  why he was up so early.\"    Wunsch shrugged his shoulders. \"If he think about her all night already,  why do you say the flowers remind him?\"    Thea looked up at him in perplexity. A flash of comprehension lit her  face and she smiled eagerly. \"Oh, I didn't mean 'remind' in that way! I  didn't mean they brought her to his mind! I meant it was only when he  came out in the morning, that she seemed to him like that,--like one of  the flowers.\"    \"And before he came out, how did she seem?\"    This time it was Thea who shrugged her shoulders. The warm smile left  her face. She lifted her eyebrows in annoyance and looked off at the  sand hills.    Wunsch persisted. \"Why you not answer me?\"    \"Because it would be silly. You are just trying to make me say things.  It spoils things to ask questions.\"    Wunsch bowed mockingly; his smile was disagreeable. Suddenly his face  grew grave, grew fierce, indeed. He pulled himself up from his clumsy  stoop and folded his arms. \"But it is necessary to know if you know some  things. Some things cannot be taught. If you not know in the beginning,  you not know in the end. For a singer there must be something in the  inside from the beginning. I shall not be long in this place, may-be,  and I like to know. Yes,\"--he ground his heel in the gravel,--\"yes, when  you are barely six, you must know that already. That is the beginning of  all things; DER GEIST, DIE PHANTASIE. It must be in the baby, when it  makes its first cry, like DER RHYTHMUS, or it is not to be. You have  some voice already, and if in the beginning, when you are with  things-to-play, you know that what you will not tell me, then you can  learn to sing, may-be.\"    Wunsch began to pace the arbor, rubbing his hands together. The dark  flush of his face had spread up under the iron-gray bristles on his  head. He was talking to himself, not to Thea. Insidious power of the  linden bloom! \"Oh, much you can learn! ABER NICHT DIE AMERICANISCHEN  FRAULEIN. They have nothing inside them,\" striking his chest with both  fists. \"They are like the ones in the MARCHEN, a grinning face and  hollow in the insides. Something they can learn, oh, yes, may-be! But  the secret--what make the rose to red, the sky to blue, the man to  love--IN DER BRUST, IN DER BRUST it is, UND OHNE DIESES GIEBT ES KEINE  KUNST, GIEBT ES KEINE KUNST!\" He threw up his square hand and shook it,  all the fingers apart and wagging. Purple and breathless he went out of  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44114"],[0,"A Jay of Italy (#14)"],[1,"Parablist.    'Wear this,' he said, 'in earnest of our love and duty.'    Then he turned upon the mob.    'These judgments stand, and all that shall be spoken hereafter by our  dear monitor and proctor.  It is our will.  Make way, gentlemen.'    He took Bernardo's arm and descended the steps.  A cloud of courtiers  hovered near, acclaiming the boy Saint and Daniel.  Messer Ludovico  saluted him with fervour. He foresaw the millennium in this association  of piety with greatness.  Galeazzo sneered.    'Remember that three spoils company, brother,' said he.  'Keep thou  thine own confessor, and leave me mine.'    It was then only that Bernardo learned the rank of his accoster.    'Alas! sweet lord,' said he, 'is piety such a stranger here that ye must  entertain him like a king?'    The Duke laughed loudly and drew him on.  He was extravagant in his  attentions to him--eager, voluble, feverish.  He would point out to him  the lavish decorations of his house--marbles, sculptures, paintings, the  rising fabric of a new era--and ask his opinion on all.  A word from the  child at that period would have floored a cardinal or a scaffolding,  have clothed Aphrodite in a cassock, have made a _fete champetre_ of all  Milan, or darkened its walls with mourning.  Messer Lanti, following in  their wake, was amazed, and dubious, and savage in turns.  Earlier in  the day the Duke had had from him the whole story of his connection with  the Parablist, up to the moment of their interference in Montano's  punishment.    '_Meschino me!_' he had said, greatly laughing over that episode; 'yet I  cannot but be glad that the old code beat itself out on his back.  'Twas  a reptile well served--a venomous, ungrateful beast.  A mercy if it has  broken his fang.'    That remained to be seen; and in the meantime Carlo, the old auxiliary  in debauch, was taken again into full favour.  He accepted the  condescension with reserve.  The oddest new attachment had come to  supplant in him some ancient devotions that were the furthest from  devout.  He found himself in a very queer mood, between irritable and  gentle.  He had never before felt this inclination to hit hard for  virtue, and it bewildered his honest head.  But it made him a dangerous  watchdog.    By and by the Duke carried his protege into the Duchess's privy garden.  There was a necessary economy of ornamental ground about the castello,  though the most was made of what could be spared.  In a nest of green  alleys, and falling terraces, and rose-wreathed arches, they came upon  the two ladies whom Bembo had already seen, themselves as pretty,  graceful flowers as any in the borders.  The young Catherine sat upon a  fountain edge, fanning herself with a great leaf, and talking to a  flushed, down-looking page, who, it seemed likely, had brought news from  the court of a recent scandal and its sequel.  Her shrewd, pretty face  took curious stock of the new comers.  She was a pale slip of a girl,  lithe, bosomless, the green plum of womanhood. Her thin, plain dress was  green, fitting her like a sheath its blade of corn, and she wore on her  sleek fair head a cap of green velvet banded with a scroll of beaten  gold. A child she was, yet already for two years betrothed to a Pope's  nephew.  His presents on the occasion had included a camera of green  velvet, sewn with pearls as thick as daisies in grass.  It seemed  natural to associate her with spring verdure, so sweet and fair she was;  yet never, surely, worked a more politic little brain under its cap of  innocence.    Hard by, on one of the walks, a woman and a child of seven played at  ball.  These were Bona, and her little son Gian-Galeazzo.  As the other  was spring, so was she summer, ripe in figure and mellowed in the  passion of motherhood.  Her eyes burned with the caress and entreaty of  it--appealed in loveliness to the fathers of her desires.  Her beauty,  her stateliness, the very milk of her were all sweet lures to increase.  She loved babies, not men--saw them most lusty, perhaps, in the glossy  eyes of fools, the breeding-grounds of Cupids.  She was always a mother  before a wife.    The Duke led Bernardo to her side.  Pale as ivory, she bent and embraced  her boy, and dismissed him to the fountain; then rose to face the  ordeal.    'Hail, judgments of Solomon!' she said, with a smile that quivered a  little.  'O believe me, sir, thy fame has run before!'    'Which was the reason thou dismissedst Gian,' said Galeazzo, 'in fears  that Solomon would propose to halve him?'    He did not doubt her, or wing his shaft with anything but brutality.  It  was his coward way, and, having asserted it, he strolled off, grinning  and whistling, to the fountain.    Bona shivered and drew herself up.  Her robe was all of daffodil, with a  writhed golden hem to it that looked like a long flicker of flame.  On  her forehead, between wings of auburn hair, burned a great emerald.  She  seemed to Bernardo the loveliest, most gracious thing, a vision  personified of fruitfulness, the golden angel of maternity, warm,  fragrant, kind-bosomed.  He met the gaze of her eyes with wonderment,  but no fear.    'Sweet Madonna,' he said, 'hail me nothing, I pray thee, but the clear  herald of our Christ--His mouthpiece and recorder.  We may all be played  upon for truth, so we be pure of heart.'    'And that art thou?  No guile?  No duplicity?  No self-interest?'    He marvelled.  She looked at him earnestly.    'Bernardo, didst know this Tassino was my servant?'    'Nay, I knew it not.'    'Wouldst have spared him hadst thou known?'    'How could I spare him the truth?'    'But its shame, its punishment?'    'Greater shame could no man have than to debauch innocence.  His  punishment was his redemption.'    'Ah!  I defend him not.  Yet, bethink thee, she may have been the  temptress?'    'He should have loathed, not loved her, then.'    'Madreperla, mother-of-pearl,' cried Catherine, with a little shriek of  laughter, from the fountain; 'come and help me!  I have caught a  butterfly in my hand, and my father wishes to take it from me and kill  it!'                                       *CHAPTER VII*      Bernardo wrote to the Abbot of San Zeno:--    'MOST DEAR AND HONOURED FATHER,--Many words from me would but dilute the  wonder of my narrative.  Also thou lovest brevity in all things but  God's praise.  Know, then, how I have surpassed expectation in the early  propagation of our creed, which is by Love to banish Law, that old  engine of necessarianism. [_Here follows a brief recapitulation of the  events which had landed him, a little sweet oracle of light, in the dark  old castello of Milanl._]  Man' (he goes on) 'is of all creatures the  most susceptible to his environments.  Thou shalt induce him but to feed  on the olive branches of Peace in order that he may take their colour.  O sorrow, then, on the false appetites which have warped his nature! on  the beastly doctrines which, Satan-engendered, have led him half to  believe there is no wrong or right, but only necessity!  Is there no  such thing as discord in music, at which even a dog will howl?  Harmony  is God--so plain.  Yet there is a learned doctor here, one Lascaris who  disputeth this.  My father, I do not think that learned doctors seek so  much the intrinsic truth of things as to impress their followers with  their perspicacity in the pursuit.  John led James over-the-way by a  \"short cut\" of three miles, and James thought John a very clever fellow.  Pray for me!...    'I will speak first of the Duchess, to whom I delivered your letter.  She is a most sweet lady, with eyes, so kind and loving were they, they  made me think of those soft stars which light the flocks to fold.  She  asked me did I remember my mother?  \"That is a strange question,\" quoth  I, \"to a foundling.\"  \"Ah!\" said she, \"poor child! I had forgot how thou  fell'st, a star, into Mary's lap.  I would have taken care, for my part,  not so to tumble out of heaven.\"  \"Nay,\" I said, \"but if thou, a mother  there, hadst let slip thy baby first?\"  \"What,\" she said, looking at me  so strange and wistful, \"did she follow, then?\"  My father, thou know'st  my fancies.  \"I cannot tell,\" I said.  \"Sometimes, in a dream, the dim,  sad shadow of a woman's face seems to hang over me lying on that altar.\"  She held out her arms to me, then withdrew them, and she was weeping.  \"We are all wicked,\" she cried; \"there is no heart, nor faith, nor  virtue, in any of us!\" and she ran away lamenting.  Now, was not that  strange? for she is in truth a lady of great virtue, a pure wife and  mother, and to me most sweet-forgiving for an ill-favour I was forced to  do her upon one of her servants. But not women nor men know their own  hearts.  They wear the devil's livery for fashion's sake, when he  introduces it on a pretty sister or young gentleman, and so believe  themselves bound to his service.  But it is as easy as talking to make  virtue the mode.  Thou shalt see.    'Does not the beautiful Duomo itself stand in their midst, the fairest  earnest of their true piety?  Could intrinsic baseness conceive this  ethereal fabric, or, year by year, graft it with sprigs of new  loveliness?  There is that in them yet like a little child that  stretches out its arms to the sky.    'I have, besides the greatest, two converts, or half-converts, already,  my dear Carlo and his Fool.  The former is a great bull gallant, whom a  spark will set roaring and a kiss allay.  I love him greatly, and he  bellows and prances, and swearing \"I will not\" follows to the pipe of  peace.  Alas! if I could woo him from a great wrong!  It will happen,  when men see honour whole, and not partisanly.  In the meantime I have  every reason to be charitable to that lady Beatrice, sith she holds  herself my mortal enemy.  And indeed I excuse her for myself, but not  for the honest soul she keeps in thrall.  My father, is it not a strange  paradox, that holding the "]]]
