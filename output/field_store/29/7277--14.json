Such  were the imaginative beliefs upon which this ancient astronomical theory  was founded, that for a period of upwards of two thousand years held  undisputed sway over the minds of men, and exercised during that time a  predominating influence upon the imagination, thoughts, and conceptions  of all those who devoted themselves to literature, science, and art. Of  the truthfulness of this assertion there is ample evidence in the  poetical, philosophical, and historical writings of ancient authors,  whose ideas and conceptions regarding the created universe were limited  and circumscribed by this form of astronomical belief. In the works of  more recent writers we find that it continued to assert its influence;  and among our English poets, from Chaucer down to Shakespeare, there are  numerous references to the natural phenomena associated with this  system, and most frequently expressed by poetical allusions to 'the  music of the spheres.'    The ideas associated with the Ptolemaic theory were gratifying to the  pride and vanity of man, who could regard with complacency the paramount  importance of the globe which he inhabited, and of which he was the  absolute ruler, fixed in the centre of the universe, and surrounded by  ten revolving spheres, that carried along with them in their circuit all  other celestial bodies--Sun, Moon, and stars, which would appear to have  been created for his delectation, and for the purpose of ministering to  his requirements. But when the Copernican theory became better  understood, and especially after the discovery of the law of universal  gravitation, this venerable system of the universe, based upon a pile of  unreasonable and false hypotheses, after an existence of over twenty  centuries, sank into oblivion, and was no more heard of.    Milton's Ptolemaism is apparent in some of his shorter pieces, and also  in his minor poems, 'Arcades' and 'Comus.' His 'Ode on the Nativity' is  written in conformity with this belief, and the expression,        Ring out ye crystal spheres,    indicates a poetical allusion to this theory. But as Milton grew older  his Ptolemaism became greatly modified, and there are good reasons for  believing that in his latter years he renounced it entirely in favour of  Copernicanism. When on his continental tour in 1638, he made the  acquaintance of eminent men who held views different from those with  which he was familiar; and in his interview with Galileo at Arcetri, the  aged astronomer may have impressed upon his mind the superiority of the  Copernican theory, in accounting for the occurrence of celestial  phenomena, as compared with the Ptolemaic.    On his return to England from the Continent, Milton took up his  residence in London, and lived in apartments in a house in St. Bride's  Churchyard. Having no regular vocation, and not wishing to be dependent  upon his father, he undertook the education of his two nephews, John and  Edward Phillips, aged nine and ten years respectively. From St. Bride's  Churchyard he removed to a larger house in Aldersgate, where he received  as pupils the sons of some of his most intimate acquaintances. In the  list of subjects which Milton selected for the purpose of imparting  instruction to those youths he included astronomy and mathematics,  which formed part of the curriculum of this educational establishment.  The text-book from which he taught his nephews and other pupils  astronomy was called 'De Sphaera Mundi,' a work written by Joannes  Sacrobasco (John Holywood) in the thirteenth century. This book was an  epitome of Ptolemy's 'Almagest,' and therefore entirely Ptolemaic in its  teaching. It enjoyed great popularity during the Middle Ages, and is  reported to have gone through as many as forty editions.    The selection of astronomy as one of the subjects in which Milton  instructed his pupils affords us evidence that he must have devoted  considerable time and attention to acquiring a knowledge of the facts  and details associated with the study of the science. In the attainment  of this he had to depend upon his own exertions and the assistance  derived from astronomical books; for at this time astronomy received no  recognition as a branch of study at any of the universities; and in  Britain the science attracted less attention than on the Continent,  where the genius of Kepler and Galileo elevated it to a position of  national importance.    We shall find as we proceed that Milton's knowledge of astronomy was  comprehensive and accurate; that he was familiar with the astronomical  reasons by which many natural phenomena which occur around us can be  explained; and that he understood many of the details of the science  which are unknown to ordinary observers of the heavens.    It is remarkable how largely astronomy enters into the composition of  'Paradise Lost,' and we doubt if any author could have written such a  poem without possessing a knowledge of the heavens and of the celestial  orbs such as can only be attained by a proficient and intimate  acquaintance with this science.    The arguments in favour of or against the Ptolemaic and Copernican  theories were well known to Milton, even as regards their minute  details; and in Book viii. he introduces a scientific discussion based  upon the respective merits of those theories. The configuration of the  celestial and terrestrial spheres, and the great circles by which they  are circumscribed, he also knew. The causes which bring about the change  of the seasons; the obliquity of the ecliptic; the zodiacal  constellations through which the Sun travels, and the periods of the  year in which he occupies them, are embraced in Milton's knowledge of  the science of astronomy. The motions of the Earth, including the  Precession of the Equinoxes; the number and distinctive appearances of  the planets, their direct and retrograde courses, and their satellites,  are also described by him. The constellations, and their relative  positions on the celestial sphere; the principal stars, star-groups, and  clusters, and the Galaxy, testify to Milton's knowledge of astronomy,  and to the use which he has made of the science in the elaboration of  his poem.    The names of fourteen of the constellations are mentioned in 'Paradise  Lost.' These, when arranged alphabetically, read as follows:--    Andromeda, Aries, Astrea, Centaurus, Cancer, Capricornus, Gemini, Leo,  Libra, Ophiuchus, Orion, Scorpio, Taurus, and Virgo. Milton's allusions  to the zodiacal constellations are chiefly associated with his  description of the Sun's path in the heavens; but with the celestial  sign Libra (the _Scales_) he has introduced a lofty and poetical  conception of the means by which the Creator made known His will when  there arose a contention between Gabriel and Satan on his discovery in  Paradise.        The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray,      Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales, yet seen      Betwixt Astrea[6] and the Scorpion sign,      Wherein all things created first he weighed,      The pendulous round Earth with balanced air      In counterpoise, now ponders all events,      Battles and realms. In these he put two weights,      The sequel each of parting and of fight:      The latter quick up flew, and kicked the beam.--iv. 996-1004.    Orion, the finest constellation in the heavens, did not escape Milton's  observation, and there is one allusion to it in his poem. It arrives on  the meridian in winter, where it is conspicuous as a brilliant  assemblage of stars, and represents an armed giant, or hunter, holding a  massive club in his right hand, and having a shield of lion's hide on  his left arm. A triple-gemmed belt encircles his waist, from which is  suspended a glittering sword, tipped with a bright star. The two  brilliants Betelgeux and Bellatrix form the giant's shoulders, and the  bright star Rigel marks the position of his advanced foot. The rising of  Orion was believed to be accompanied by stormy and tempestuous weather.  Milton alludes to this in the following lines:--              When with fierce winds Orion armed      Hath vexed the Red Sea coast, whose waves o'erthrew      Busiris and his Memphian chivalry.--i. 305-7.    Andromeda is described as being borne by Aries, and in 'Ophiuchus huge'  Milton locates a comet which extends the whole length of the  constellation. It is evident that Milton possessed a precise knowledge  of the configuration and size of the constellations, and of the  positions which they occupy relatively to each other on the celestial  sphere.    Though Milton was conversant with the Copernican theory, and entertained  a conviction of its accuracy and truthfulness, and doubtless recognised  the superiority of this system, which, besides conveying to the mind a  nobler conception of the universe and of the solar system--though it  diminished the importance of the Earth as a member of it--was capable of  explaining the occurrence of celestial phenomena in a manner more  satisfactory than could be arrived at by the Ptolemaic theory.  Notwithstanding this, he selected the Ptolemaic cosmology as the  scientific basis upon which he constructed his 'Paradise Lost,' and in  its elaboration adhered with marked fidelity to this system. There were  many reasons why Milton, in the composition of an imaginative poem,  should have chosen the Ptolemaic system of the universe rather than the  Copernican. This form of astronomical belief was adopted by all the  authors whose works he perused and studied in his younger days,  including his favourite poet, Dante; and his own poetic imaginings, as  indicated by his early poems, were in harmony with the doctrines of this  astronomical creed, a long acquaintance with which had, without doubt,  influenced his mind in its favour. This system of revolving spheres,  with the steadfast Earth at its centre, and the whole enclosed by the  Primum Mobile, constituted a more attractive and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28458"],[0,"What a Young Woman Ought to Know (#14)"],[1,"in the woman about every twenty-eight days. The uterus is lined by a  mucous membrane similar to that which lines the mouth, and at this  time of ovulation this membrane becomes swollen and soft, and little  hemorrhages, or bleedings, occur for three or four days, the blood  passing away through the vagina. This is called menstruation.    Sometimes, when girls have not been told beforehand of the facts of  menstruation, they become greatly frightened at seeing this blood and  imagine that they have some dreadful disease. If they have no friend  to whom they can speak freely they sometimes do very injudicious  things in their efforts to remove that which to them seems so strange  and inexplicable. I have known of girls who washed their clothes in  cold water and put them on wet, and so took cold and perhaps checked  the menstrual flow, and as a consequence were injured for life, or may  even have died years after as a result of this unwise conduct.    The girl who is wisely taught will recognize in this the outward sign  of the fact that she has reached womanhood, that she has entered upon  what is called the maternal period of a woman's life, the period when  it is possible for her to become a mother.    This does not mean that she should become a mother while so young. It  only means that the sex organs are so far developed that they are  beginning to take up their peculiar functions. But they are like the  immature buds of the flower, and need time for a perfect development.  If she understands this, and recognizes her added value to the world  through the perfecting of her entire organism, she will desire to take  good care of herself, and during these years of early young womanhood  to develop into all that is possible of sweetness, grace, purity, and  all true womanliness.    Girls who are not wisely taught sometimes feel that this new physical  function is a vexatious hindrance to their happiness. It is often  accompanied with pain, and its periodical recurrence interferes with  their plans for pleasure, and they in ignorance sometimes say,  rebelliously, \"O, I hate being a woman!\"    A young woman once came to consult me professionally. She was a  well-formed, good-looking girl, to all outward appearance lacking  nothing in her physical make-up; but she was now twenty-two and had  never menstruated, so she was aware that for some reason she was not  like other girls. She came to ask me to make an examination and find  out, if possible, what was wrong. She was engaged to be married, and  knew that motherhood was in some way connected with menstruation, and  she thought it might be possible that her physical condition would  preclude the possibility of her becoming a mother, and, if so, it  would be dishonorable to marry. Upon examination I discovered that all  the organs of reproduction were lacking. When I disclosed this fact to  her she exclaimed, with sadness, \"Oh, why was I not made like other  girls? I have heard them complain because they were girls, but I think  if they were in my place, and knew that they could never have a home  and children of their own, they would feel they had greater reason  then to complain.\"    I think so, too. We seldom think of the fact that upon sex depend all  the sweet ties of home and family. It is because of sex that we are  fathers, mothers and children; that we have the dear family life, with  its anniversaries of weddings and birthdays. It is through sex that  the \"desolate of the earth are set in families,\" and love and  generosity have sway instead of selfishness. For this reason we ought  to regard sex with reverent thought, to hold it sacred to the highest  purposes, to speak of it ever with purest delicacy, and never with  jesting or prurient smiles. I do not want you to center your thought  on the physical facts of sex, but I would like to have you feel that  womanhood, which is the mental, moral and physical expression of sex,  is a glorious, divine gift, to be received with solemn thankfulness.    I want you, for the sake of a perfect womanhood, to take care of your  bodily health, and yet I do not want you to feel that a woman must of  necessity be a periodical semi-invalid.          CHAPTER XV.    ARTIFICIALITIES OF CIVILIZED LIFE.      Menstruation is a perfectly physiological process and should be  without pain. Indeed, Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi maintains that a woman  ought to feel more life, vigor and ambition at that period than at any  other time. As a fact, however, the majority of civilized women feel  more or less lassitude and discomfort, and many suffer intensely.  Whenever there is actual pain at any stage of the monthly period, it  is because something is wrong, either in the dress, or the diet, or  the personal and social habits of the individual. We certainly cannot  believe that a kind and just God has made it necessary for women to  suffer merely because they are women, and the observation of travelers  among uncivilized peoples seems to indicate that where life is  conducted according to nature's laws, the limitations of sex are less  observable.    It is difficult for us to understand how very far our lives are from  being natural. Professor Emmett, a world-renowned specialist in  diseases peculiar to women, says: \"At the very dawn of womanhood the  young girl begins to live an artificial life utterly inconsistent with  normal development. The girl of the period is made a woman before her  time by associating too much with her elders, and in diet, dress,  habits and tastes becomes at an early age but a reflection of her  elder sisters. She may have acquired every accomplishment, and yet  will have been kept in ignorance of the simplest features of her  organization, and of the requirements for the preservation of her  health. Her bloom is often as transient as that of the hothouse plant,  where the flower has been forced by cultivation to an excess of  development by stunting the growth of its branches and limiting the  spread of its roots. A girl is scarcely in her teens before custom  requires a change in her dress. Her shoulder-straps and buttons are  given up for a number of strings about her waist and the additional  weight of an increased length in skirt is added. She is unable to take  the proper kind or necessary amount of exercise, even if she were not  taught that it would be unladylike to make the attempt. Her waist is  drawn into a shape little adapted to accommodate the organs placed  there, and as the abdominal and spinal muscles are seldom brought into  play they become atrophied. The viscera are thus compressed and  displaced, and as the full play of the abdominal wall and the descent  of the diaphragm are interfered with, the venous blood is hindered in  its return to the heart.\"    Since Professor Emmett wrote this, public sentiment has changed, and  it is no longer unladylike for girls to exercise; but with this  increased freedom in custom should also come increased physical  freedom through healthful clothing that allows perfect use of every  muscle, more especially of the breathing muscles. I am sure you would  rather pay out your money for that which shall add to your health and  real happiness than to pay physicians to help you from suffering the  just penalty of your own wrongdoing, and that is why I am anxious to  give you this needed instruction. I do not care to have you study much  about diseases, but I want you to understand very fully how, through  care of yourself, to prevent disease.          CHAPTER XVI.    SOME CAUSES OF PAINFUL MENSTRUATION.      There should be no pain at menstruation, but that pain is quite common  cannot be denied. Let us look for other causes than are found in the  dress.    One frequent cause is found in the ignorance of girls, and their  consequent injudicious conduct at the time of the beginning of sexual  activity. At this time of life the girl is often called lazy because  she manifests lassitude, and this is nature's indication that she  should rest. The vital forces are busy establishing a new function,  and the energy that has been expressed in bodily activity is now being  otherwise employed. The girl who has been properly brought up, whose  muscles are strong, and whose nervous supply is abundant, may have no  need of especial care at this time, but the average girl needs much  judicious care, in order that her physical womanhood shall be  healthfully established. She should be guarded from taking cold, from  overexertion, from social dissipation, and especially from mental  excitement, and other causes of nervousness. I would like to call your  attention to the great evil of romance-reading, both in the  production of premature development and in the creation of morbid  mental states which will tend to the production of physical evils,  such as nervousness, hysteria, and a host of maladies which largely  depend upon disturbed nerves.    Girls are not apt to understand the evils of novel-reading, and may  think it is only because mothers have outlived their days of romance  that they object to their daughters enjoying such sentimental reading;  but the wise mother understands the effects of sensational reading  upon the physical organization, and wishes to protect her daughter  from the evils thus produced.    It is not only that novel-reading engenders false and unreal ideas of  life, but the descriptions of love-scenes, of thrilling, romantic  episodes, find an echo in the girl's physical system and tend to  create an abnormal excitement of her organs of sex, which she  recognizes only as a pleasurable mental emotion, with no comprehension  of the physical origin or the evil effects.    Romance-reading by young girls will, by this excitement of the bodily  organs, tend to create their premature development, and the child  becomes physically a woman months, or even years, before she should.    In one case it became my duty to warn a girl of eleven, who was an"]]]
