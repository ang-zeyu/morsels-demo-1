They were not mounted and  therefore traveled slowly, so it took about ten days of walking before  they saw any signs of the enemy. The old warriors had told them of a  thickly wooded creek within the enemies' bounds. The old men said, \"That  creek looks the ideal place to camp, but don't camp there by any means,  because there is a ghost who haunts that creek, and any one who camps  there is disturbed all through the night, and besides they never return,  because the ghost is Wakan (holy), and the enemies conquer the travelers  every time.\" The friends had extra moccasins with them and one extra  blanket, as it was late in the fall and the nights were very cold.    They broke camp early one morning and walked all day. Along towards  evening, the clouds which had been threatening all day, hurriedly opened  their doors and down came the snowflakes thick and fast. Just before it  started snowing the friends had noticed a dark line about two miles in  advance of them. Chaske spoke to his friend and said: \"If this storm  continues we will be obliged to stay overnight at Ghost Creek, as  I noticed it not far ahead of us, just before the storm set in.\" \"I  noticed it also,\" said Hake. \"We might as well entertain a ghost all  night as to lie out on these open prairies and freeze to death.\" So they  decided to run the risk and stay in the sheltering woods of Ghost Creek.  When they got to the creek it seemed as if they had stepped inside a big  tepee, so thick was the brush and timber that the wind could not be felt  at all. They hunted and found a place where the brush was very thick and  the grass very tall. They quickly pulled the tops of the nearest willows  together and by intertwining the ends made them fast, and throwing  their tent robe over this, soon had a cosy tepee in which to sleep.  They started their fire and cooked some dried buffalo meat and buffalo  tallow, and were just about to eat their supper when a figure of a man  came slowly in through the door and sat down near where he had entered.  Hake, being the one who was doing the cooking, poured out some tea into  his own cup, and putting a piece of pounded meat and marrow into a small  plate, placed it before the stranger, saying: \"Eat, my friend, we are  on the warpath and do not carry much of a variety of food with us, but I  give you the best we have.\"    The stranger drew the plate towards him, and commenced eating  ravenously. He soon finished his meal and handed the dish and cup back.  He had not uttered a word so far. Chaske filled the pipe and handed it  to him. He smoked for a few minutes, took one last draw from the pipe  and handed it back to Chaske, and then he said: \"Now, my friends, I am  not a living man, but the wandering spirit of a once great warrior, who  was killed in these woods by the enemy whom you two brave young men are  now seeking to make war upon. For years I have been roaming these woods  in hopes that I might find some one brave enough to stop and listen  to me, but all who have camped here in the past have run away at my  approach or fired guns or shot arrows at me. For such cowards as these  I have always found a grave. They never returned to their homes. Now I  have found two brave men whom I can tell what I want done, and if you  accomplish what I tell you to do, you will return home with many horses  and some scalps dangling from your belts. Just over this range of hills  north of us, a large village is encamped for the winter. In that camp is  the man who laid in ambush and shot me, killing me before I could get  a chance to defend myself. I want that man's scalp, because he has been  the cause of my wanderings for a great many years. Had he killed me on  the battlefield my spirit would have at once joined my brothers in the  happy hunting grounds, but being killed by a coward, my spirit is doomed  to roam until I can find some brave man who will kill this coward and  bring me his scalp. This is why I have tried every party who have camped  here to listen to me, but as I have said before, they were all cowards.  Now, I ask you two brave young men, will you do this for me?\"    \"We will,\" said the friends in one voice. \"Thank you, my boys. Now, I  know why you came here, and that one of you came to earn his feathers by  killing an enemy, before he would marry; the girl he is to marry is  my granddaughter, as I am the father of the great Medicine Man. In the  morning there will pass by in plain sight of here a large party. They  will chase the buffalo over on that flat. After they have passed an old  man leading a black horse and riding a white one will come by on the  trail left by the hunting party. He will be driving about a hundred  horses, which he will leave over in the next ravine. He will then  proceed to the hunting grounds and get meat from the different hunters.  After the hunters have all gone home he will come last, singing the  praises of the ones who gave him the meat. This man you must kill and  scalp, as he is the one I want killed. Then take the white and black  horse and each mount and go to the hunting grounds. There you will see  two of the enemy riding about picking up empty shells. Kill and scalp  these two and each take a scalp and come over to the high knoll and I  will show you where the horses are, and as soon as you hand me the old  man's scalp I will disappear and you will see me no more. As soon as I  disappear, it will start in snowing. Don't be afraid as the snow will  cover your trail, but nevertheless, don't stop traveling for three days  and nights, as these people will suspect that some of your tribe have  done this, and they will follow you until you cross your own boundary  lines.\"    When morning came, the two friends sat in the thick brush and watched  a large party pass by their hiding place. So near were they that the  friends could hear them laughing and talking. After the hunting party  had passed, as the spirit had told them, along came the old man, driving  a large band of horses and leading a fine looking coal black horse. The  horse the old man was riding was as white as snow. The friends crawled  to a little brush covered hill and watched the chase after the shooting  had ceased. The friends knew it would not be long before the return of  the party, so they crawled back to their camp and hurriedly ate some  pounded meat and drank some cherry tea. Then they took down their robe  and rolled it up and got everything in readiness for a hurried flight  with the horses. Scarcely had they got everything in readiness when the  party came by, singing their song of the chase. When they had all gone  the friends crawled down to the trail and lay waiting for the old man.  Soon they heard him singing. Nearer and nearer came the sounds of the  song until at last at a bend in the road, the old man came into view.  The two friends arose and advanced to meet him. On he came still  singing. No doubt he mistook them for some of his own people. When  he was very close to them they each stepped to either side of him and  before he could make an outcry they pierced his cowardly old heart with  two arrows. He had hardly touched the ground when they both struck him  with their bows, winning first and second honors by striking an enemy  after he has fallen. Chaske having won first honors, asked his friend to  perform the scalping deed, which he did. And wanting to be sure that the  spirit would get full revenge, took the whole scalp, ears and all, and  tied it to his belt. The buffalo beef which the old man had packed upon  the black horse, they threw on the top of the old man. Quickly mounting  the two horses, they hastened out across the long flat towards the  hunting grounds. When they came in sight of the grounds there they saw  two men riding about from place to place. Chaske took after the one  on the right, Hake the one on the left. When the two men saw these two  strange men riding like the wind towards them, they turned their horses  to retreat towards the hills, but the white and the black were the  swiftest of the tribe's horses, and quickly overtook the two fleeing  men. When they came close to the enemy they strung their arrows onto the  bowstring and drove them through the two fleeing hunters. As they were  falling they tried to shoot, but being greatly exhausted, their bullets  whistled harmlessly over the heads of the two friends. They scalped the  two enemies and took their guns and ammunition, also secured the two  horses and started for the high knoll. When they arrived at the place,  there stood the spirit. Hake presented him with the old man's scalp and  then the spirit showed them the large band of horses, and saying, \"Ride  hard and long,\" disappeared and was seen no more by any war parties,  as he was thus enabled to join his forefathers in the happy hunting  grounds.    The friends did as the spirit had told them. For three days and three  nights they rode steadily. On the fourth morning they came into their  own boundary. From there on they rode more slowly, and let the band  of horses rest and crop the tops of long grass. They would stop  occasionally, and while one slept the other kept watch. Thus they got  fairly well rested before they came in sight of where their camp had  stood when they had left. All that they could see of the once large  village was the lone tent of the great Medicine Man. They rode up on to  a high hill and farther on towards the east they saw smoke from a great  many tepees. They then knew that something had happened and that the  village had moved away.    \"My friend,\" said Chaske, \"I am afraid something has happened to the  Medicine Man's lodge, and rather than have you go there, I will go alone  and you follow the trail of our party and go on ahead with the horses.

So varied and rich was her literary  productiveness in this era that it still remains her greatest period,  and so completely did New England writers of this epoch voice the ideals  of the nation that the great majority of Americans, even today, regard  these New Englanders as the truest literary exponents of the mind and  soul of the United States. We must take a look at them.        CHAPTER VI. THE TRANSCENDENTALISTS    To understand the literary leadership of New England during the thirty  years immediately preceding the Civil War it is necessary to recall the  characteristics of a somewhat isolated and peculiar people. The mental  and moral traits of the New England colonists, already glanced at in  an earlier chapter, had suffered little essential modification in two  hundred years. The original racial stock was still dominant. As compared  with the middle and southern colonies, there was relatively little  immigration, and this was easily assimilated. The physical remoteness of  New England from other sections of the country, and the stubborn loyalty  with which its inhabitants maintained their own standards of life, alike  contributed to their sense of separateness. It is true, of course, that  their mode of thinking and feeling had undergone certain changes. They  were among the earliest theorists of political independence from Great  Britain, and had done their share, and more, in the Revolution. The  rigors of their early creed had somewhat relaxed, as we have seen, by  the end of the seventeenth century, and throughout the eighteenth there  was a gradual progress toward religious liberalism. The population  steadily increased, and New England's unremitting struggle with a not  too friendly soil, her hardihood upon the seas, and her keenness in  trade, became proverbial throughout the country. Her seaport towns were  wealthy. The general standards of living remained frugal, but extreme  poverty was rare. Her people still made, as in the earliest days of  the colonies, silent and unquestioned sacrifices for education, and  her chief seats of learning, Harvard and Yale, remained the foremost  educational centers of America. But there was still scant leisure for  the quest of beauty, and slender material reward for any practitioner  of the fine arts. Oratory alone, among the arts of expression, commanded  popular interest and applause. Daniel Webster's audiences at Plymouth in  1820 and at Bunker Hill in 1825 were not inferior to similar audiences  of today in intelligence and in responsiveness. Perhaps they were  superior. Appreciation of the spoken word was natural to men trained  by generations of thoughtful listening to \"painful\" preaching and by  participation in the discussions of town-meeting. Yet appreciation of  secular literature was rare, and interest in the other arts was almost  non-existent.    Then, beginning in the eighteen-twenties, and developing rapidly after  1830, came a change, a change so startling as to warrant the term  of \"the Renascence of New England.\" No single cause is sufficient to  account for this \"new birth.\" It is a good illustration of that law  of \"tension and release,\" which the late Professor Shaler liked to  demonstrate in all organic life. A long period of strain was followed  by an age of expansion, freedom, release of energy. As far as the mental  life of New England was concerned, something of the new stimulus was due  directly to the influence of Europe. Just as the wandering scholars  from Italy had brought the New Learning, which was a revival of the  old learning, into England in the sixteenth century, so now young New  England college men like Edward Everett and George Ticknor brought  home from the Continent the riches of German and French scholarship.  Emerson's description of the impression made by Everett's lectures in  1820, after his return from Germany, gives a vivid picture of the  new thirst for foreign culture. \"The North American Review\" and other  periodicals, while persistently urging the need of a distinctively  national literature, insisted also upon the value of a deeper knowledge  of the literature of the Continent. This was the burden of Channing's  once famous article on \"A National Literature\" in 1823: it was a plea  for an independent American school of writers, but these writers should  know the best that Europe had to teach.    The purely literary movement was connected, as the great name of  Channing suggests, with a new sense of freedom in philosophy and  religion. Calvinism had mainly done its work in New England. It had bred  an extraordinary type of men and women, it had, helped to lay some of  the permanent foundations of our democracy, and it was still destined  to have a long life in the new West and in the South. But in that stern  section of the country where its influence had been most marked there  was now an increasingly sharp reaction against its determinism and  its pessimism. Early in the nineteenth century the most ancient and  influential churches in Boston and the leading professors at Harvard had  accepted the new form of religious liberalism known as Unitarianism.  The movement spread throughout Eastern Massachusetts and made its way to  other States. Orthodox and liberal Congregational churches split apart,  and when Channing preached the ordination sermon for Jared Sparks in  Baltimore in 1819, the word Unitarian, accepted by the liberals with  some misgiving, became the recognized motto of the new creed. It is  only with its literary influence that we are here concerned, yet that  literary influence became so potent that there is scarcely a New England  writer of the first rank, from Bryant onward, who remained untouched by  it.    The most interesting and peculiar phase of the new liberalism has little  directly to do with the specific tenets of theological Unitarianism,  and in fact marked a revolt against the more prosaic and conventional  pattern of English and American Unitarian thought. But this movement,  known as Transcendentalism, would have been impossible without a  preliminary and liberalizing stirring of the soil. It was a fascinating  moment of release for some of the most brilliant and radical minds of  New England. Its foremost representative in our literature was Ralph  Waldo Emerson, as its chief exponents in England were Coleridge and  Carlyle. We must understand its meaning if we would perceive the quality  of much of the most noble and beautiful writing produced in New England  during the Golden Age.    What then is the significance of the word Transcendental? Disregarding  for the moment the technical development of this term as used by German  and English philosophers, it meant for Emerson and his friends simply  this: whatever transcends or goes beyond the experience of the senses.  It stressed intuition rather than sensation, direct perception of  ultimate truth rather than the processes of logic. It believed in man's  ability to apprehend the absolute ideas of Truth, Rectitude, Goodness.  It resembled the Inner Light of the Quaker, though the Quaker traced  this to a supernatural illumination of the Holy Spirit, while the  Transcendentalist believed that a vision of the eternal realities was a  natural endowment of the human mind. It had only to be trusted. Stated  in this form, it is evident that we have here a very ancient doctrine,  well known in the literature of India and of Greece. It has been held by  countless persons who have never heard of the word Transcendentalism. We  need go no further back than Alexander Pope, a Roman Catholic, whom we  find declaring: \"I am so certain of the soul's being immortal that  I seem to feel it within me, as it were by intuition.\" Pope's  friend Swift, a dean of the Church of England and assuredly no  Transcendentalist, defined vision as seeing the things that are  invisible.    Now turn to some of the New England men. Dr. C. A. Bartol, a disciple of  Emerson, maintained that \"the mistake is to make the everlasting things  subjects of argument instead of sight.\" Theodore Parker declared to his  congregation:    \"From the primitive facts of consciousness given by the power of  instinctive intuition, I endeavored to deduce the true notion of God,  of justice and futurity.... I found most help in the works of Immanuel  Kant, one of the profoundest thinkers of the world, though one of the  worst writers, even in Germany; if he did not always furnish conclusions  I could rest in, he yet gave me the true method, and put me on the right  road. I found certain great primal Intuitions of Human Nature, which  depend on no logical process of demonstration, but are rather facts of  consciousness given by the instinctive action of human nature itself. I  will mention only the three most important which pertain to Religion.  1. The Instinctive Intuition of the Divine, the consciousness that there  is a God. 2. The Instinctive Intuition of the Just and Right, a  consciousness that there is a Moral Law, independent of our will,  which we ought to keep. 3. The Instinctive Intuition of the Immortal,  a consciousness that the Essential Element of man, the principle of  Individuality, never dies.\"    This passage dates from 1859, and readers of Bergson may like to compare  it with the contemporary Frenchman's saying: \"The analytical faculties  can give us no realities.\"    Let us next hear Emerson himself, first in an early letter to his  brother Edward: \"Do you draw the distinction of Milton, Coleridge, and  the Germans between Reason and Understanding? I think it a philosophy  itself, and, like all truth, very practical. Reason is the highest  faculty of the soul, what we mean often by the soul itself: it  never reasons, never proves, it simply perceives, it is vision. The  understanding toils all the time, compares, contrives, adds, argues;  near-sighted, but strong-sighted, dwelling in the present, the  expedient, the customary.\" And in"]]]
