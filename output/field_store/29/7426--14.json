(42.3  mm.). In these specimens the tibia/snout-vent length ratio is 0.50 to  0.57 (0.54), and the tympanum/eye ratio is 0.48 to 0.58 (0.53). There is  a geographic gradient in size; specimens from the western part of the  range (southern Costa Rica) are smaller than those from the eastern part  of the range (eastern Panama). Five males from the Pacific lowlands of  southern Costa Rica have snout-vent lengths of 31.6 to 38.2 mm. (34.7  mm.); ten males from El Volcan, Chiriqui, Panama, 32.6 to 37.9 mm. (36.4  mm.), and eight males from Barro Colorado Island, Canal Zone, 38.2 to  42.0 mm. (35.6 mm.). These are smaller than the males from Finca La  Sumbadora, which is east of the Canal Zone. Ten females from El Volcan  have snout-vent lengths of 44.2 to 55.6 mm. (49.2 mm.), as compared 56.1  to 62.2 mm. (58.2 mm.) in three females from Finca La Sumbadora.    Large females have scattered small tubercles on the head and back;  tubercles occur in males from Costa Rica and in some males from western  Panama. The truncate snout is characteristic of both sexes.    The coloration of _Smilisca sila_ consists of a gray, tan, or pale  reddish brown dorsal ground color and a creamy white venter. The dorsum  is marked by dark brown, olive-brown, or dark reddish brown spots or  blotches (Pl. 7B). Usually the blotches are discrete, but in some  individuals they are interconnected and form an irregular dark mark on  the dorsum. There is no tendency for the blotches to form transverse  bars as in _Smilisca sordida_. In one specimen (KU 80467) the blotches  are fused and form two wide irregular longitudinal stripes, as in  _Smilisca puma_. In some females the dorsal markings are reduced to a  few small spots or are nearly absent (KU 92332), whereas in other  females the dorsal markings are bold. In one female (KU 91894) the  dorsal markings are narrowly bordered by pale blue, and numerous pale  blue flecks are present on the pale brown dorsum. In many individuals of  both sexes small white flecks are present on the dorsal surfaces.    Usually the flanks and posterior surfaces of the thighs have black  mottling enclosing pale blue spots and flecks, respectively. The dorsal  surfaces of the limbs are marked by dark brown transverse bars; usually  three or four bars are present on each forearm, thigh, and shank. The  coloration of the flanks and limbs varies geographically. Specimens from  southern Costa Rica and western Panama have distinct bars on the limbs;  the posterior surfaces of the thighs have brown reticulations enclosing  small blue flecks in specimens from Costa Rica and bolder, black  reticulations enclosing large pale blue spots in specimens from western  Panama. In specimens from Costa Rica the flanks are brown with pale blue  flecks, whereas in those from Chiriqui, Panama, the flanks are pale blue  with dark brown mottling in the inguinal region. Frogs from El Valle and  Cerro la Campana usually have distinct bars on the limbs; the posterior  surfaces of the thighs are colored as in frogs from Chiriqui, and the  inguinal region is pale blue with coarse brown mottling. Specimens from  Barro Colorado Island are marked like those from El Valle and Cerro la  Campana, except that on the posterior surfaces of the thighs fine black  reticulations enclose many dark blue spots. In specimens from Darien and  from Panama Province east of the Canal Zone (Altos de Pacora, Cerro  Jefe, Finca La Sumbadora, and Rio Pacora), the markings on the dorsal  surfaces of the limbs are indistinct or absent in males, but distinct in  some females. Intense brown and black pigment forms fine reticulations  delimiting bold blue spots on the flanks; this coloration extends to the  axilla in many specimens. Fine black reticulations enclose many dark  blue spots on the posterior surfaces of the thighs.    In females, the throat is creamy white; in some specimens scattered  brown flecks are present on the chin and throat. In breeding males the  anterior part of the throat is dark gray or dark brown.    The coloration in life is as variable as it is in preservative. In life  the holotype had a tan dorsum with dark olive-green irregular markings  and small green flecks. The limbs were tan with dark brown transverse  bars. The flanks were grayish tan anteriorly; the inguinal region and  posterior surfaces of thighs were blue with black mottling. The belly  was creamy white, and the throat was brown with creamy yellow flecks.  The iris was a dull bronze color. Among the paratypes, some individuals  had green flecks, others did not. The inguinal region and posterior  surfaces of the thighs were pale blue, pale yellowish green, or grayish  tan with black mottling. The blue was most noticeable in females.    Colors of a male from Finca La Sumbadora, Panama, were described as  follows: \"Dorsum olive-brown; irregular dark brown blotches, pale green  flecks, and raised creamy yellow spots on dorsal surfaces; belly creamy  white; throat grayish brown; undersides of limbs grayish tan; groin,  anterior and posterior surface of thigh, inner surface of shank,  anterior edge of tarsus, and proximal parts of third and fourth toes  pale blue marbled with dark brown and black; webbing brown; iris pale  bronze, finely reticulated with black.\" (Duellman, field notes, January  28, 1964.)    A female (now KU 91894) from Altos de Pacora, Panama, was described as  follows: \"An irregular dark brown, green-bordered figure on head and  back; dark brown, green-bordered bands on limbs--all on a lighter brown  and heavily green-spotted background. These markings are more vivid at  night than during the day. Lower sides, from midbody onto front of  thighs and rear of thighs onto venter of shanks to heels and thence  dorsally onto basal portions of toes heavily blue spotted on a light  brown (front of thighs and venter of shanks) to blackish brown  background. Venter cream. Iris gray-brown, finely veined with dark  brown.\" (Charles W. Myers, field notes, December 14, 1964.) Note that in  the earlier discussion of coloration of preserved specimens, the green  spots and borders have changed to pale blue after six months in  alcohol.    In living individuals from Costa Rica and Panama west of the Canal Zone,  the blue coloration on the flanks and thighs is much less conspicuous  than in specimens from eastern Panama. The color of the iris is  variable, even in frogs from one locality. The coloration of the iris in  13 living frogs (now KU 92333-45) from Valle Hornito, Chiriqui, Panama,  was described as follows: \"Iris variable--from pale to dark brown; in a  few the iris has a golden cast to the brown; in a few others the lower  half of the iris is pale gray with the upper half being light brown.\"  (Charles W. Myers, field notes, April 24, 1965).    _Natural history._--_Smilisca sila_ inhabits the Pacific slopes of lower  Central America where a pronounced dry season occurs. We have records of  males calling in December through May and also in August (latter date  from El Volcan, Chiriqui, Panama). The breeding season seems to be  correlated with the time of the year when the water is clear and at a  low level in the streams where these frogs breed.    Males call from the edges of small, shallow streams, from rocks in the  streams, or less frequently from vegetation overhanging the streams.  Females are most frequently found on the banks of streams, and clasping  pairs usually are in shallow pools in streams. One individual was found  in a bromeliad about three meters above the ground in the daytime.    The breeding call consists of a low squawk, usually followed by a series  of one or more rattling secondary notes (duration of primary notes, 0.06  to 0.28 seconds; of secondary notes, 0.14 to 0.48 seconds), repeated at  intervals of 4 to 20 seconds. The primary notes have 97 to 120 pulses  per second and major frequencies of about 900 to 2220 cycles per second  (Pl. 11B).    Eggs were obtained artificially in the field; the average length of ten  embryos in the neural groove stage is 2.4 mm., and the average diameter  of the outer envelope is 4.9 mm. Hatchlings have large, conical oral  discs, heavy gills, and a large amount of yolk; their average total  length is 6.3 mm.    Tadpoles have been found in pools in clear streams; some tadpoles have  been observed to cling by their mouths to rocks in the stream; others  were found on the bottom where they seek refuge among pebbles or under  rocks and leaves. A complete developmental series of tadpoles is not  available. Eleven tadpoles in stage 25 of development have body lengths  of 8.3 to 10.2 mm. (9.3 mm.), tail lengths of 17.3 to 21.0 mm. (18.8  mm.), and total lengths of 25.9 to 31.0 mm. (28.1 mm.). One tadpole in  stage 41 and one in stage 42 have body lengths of 11.5 and 12.5 mm.,  tail lengths of 27.2 and 29.5 mm., and total lengths of 38.7 and 42.0  mm., respectively. The snout-vent lengths of two specimens in stage 43  and one in stage 45 are 12.7, 13.0, and 13.6 mm., respectively.    A typical tadpole in stage 25 of development (KU 80620 from Finca La  Sumbadora, Panama) has a body length of 9.5 mm., tail length of 19.0  mm.,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37839"],[0,"My Experiences in Manipur and the Naga Hills (#14)"],[1,"made our salutations (a salute of eleven guns was fired  in my honour), we sat and talked for two minutes. We then mounted,  the Maharajah's elephant being driven by his third son, the master  of the elephants; and we rode together through the great bazaar,  till our roads diverged at the entrance to the fortified enclosure  to the palace, where we took leave of each other, and he went home,  and I went to the Residency, which I reached at four o'clock, my wife  and children having made a short cut.    The Residency then was a low and dark bungalow built of wattle  and daub, and thatched. It had one large room in the centre, and a  bedroom on either side with a small semicircular room in front and  rear of the centre room; there was one bathroom (I speedily added  more), and verandahs nearly all round. There were venetians to the  windows, but no glass, and the house was very dark and very full of  mosquitoes. However, all had been done by the Residency establishment  to make the place comfortable, and we were too old travellers and  too accustomed to rough it, to grumble. The house might be rude and  uncomfortable, but some of my happiest days were spent in it. The  building was at the end of a garden, with some nice mango, and other  trees here and there, and had a little more ground attached to it,  but we were on all sides surrounded by squalid villages and filthy  tanks and cesspools, and the situation was very low, though well  drained. Our English nurse grumbled incessantly, but we had engaged  in advance, a nice pleasant Naga woman, named Chowkee, to help her,  and soon made everything right for the night, but the mosquitoes were  terrible, and though my life has been spent in countries swarming  with them, I give Manipur the palm, it beats all others!    No European lady or children of pure blood had ever before been  seen in Manipur, and at first there was great excitement wherever  we went, all the population turning out to look at us. By degrees  they became accustomed to the novelty, but still occasionally people  from distant villages coming to the capital stopped to stare. Every  now and then my wife had visits from strange old ladies, often from  the Kola Ranee, the widow of the last Rajah of Assam, and by birth a  Manipuri princess, daughter of Rajah Chomjeet, and first cousin of  the Maharajah Chandra Kirtee Singh. Once an old woman of 106 years  of age, with a daughter of 76, were visitors, and once or twice some  other relic of a bygone age called on us. Among the latter was old  Ram Singh, the last survivor of Wilcox's famous survey expeditions in  Assam, in 1825-26-27-28. Wilcox was one of the giants of old, men who  with limited resources, did a vast amount of work among wild people,  and said little about it, being contented with doing their duty. In  1828, accompanied by Lieutenant Burton, and ten men belonging to the  Sudya Khamptis (Shans), he penetrated to the Bor Khamptis country, far  beyond our borders, an exploit not repeated till after our annexation  of Upper Burmah. Ram Singh had a great respect for his former leader,  and loved to talk of old days.                CHAPTER VIII.        Visit to the Maharajah--His minister--Former revolutions--Thangal      Major.      After a day's rest I paid a visit to the Maharajah, having first  stipulated as to my proper reception. I was received by the Jubraj  (heir apparent) at the entrance to the private part of the palace,  and by the Maharajah a few paces from the entrance to the Durbar room  (hall of reception), and conducted by him to a seat opposite to his  own, with a table between us, his sons and officials being seated on  either side. I read the Viceroy's letter, informing the Maharajah of  my appointment, and, after a short conversation, during which my age  was asked (a question invariably put to European officers by Manipuris  of rank), I took my leave, and was escorted back to the place where  I was met on my arrival. I was favourably impressed by what I saw,  but I at once realised that I was on no bed of roses, and that I would  have to make a good fight to obtain and maintain my just influence with  the Durbar. The Maharajah had undoubtedly grievances against us, and I  felt that it was folly and injustice not to acknowledge these. At the  same time, he and his ministers had on some occasions taken advantage  of this state of affairs to behave in an unseemly way, and for this a  sharp rebuke had to be administered. The natural sense of injustice  is strong in mankind, and I saw that chafing under slights they had  received, and often magnifying them, it was necessary for me first to  acknowledge these, and try as far as possible to make amends, and then  to come down on them very sharply for having forgotten their position.    The Maharajah returned my visit, and we had one or two interviews  when we discussed affairs. I pointed out the extreme gravity of  resisting the British Government in any way, and we soon became  very friendly. Colonel McCulloch's introduction had been a great  advantage to me, and every one was inclined to give me credit for good  intentions, at the same time that every effort was made to restrict  my authority and influence.    The Maharajah was a rather thick-set man of about five feet five  inches in height and forty-five years of age. In India he would have  been called fair. He had the features of the Indo-Chinese race, and the  impassive face that generally goes with them, but which is often not so  marked in the Manipuris. He was far the ablest man in his dominions,  and a strong and capable ruler. He had a great taste for mechanical  arts of all kinds, and a vast fund of information which he had acquired  by questioning, for he questioned every one he met. English scientific  works were explained to him, and his researches extended even to the  anatomy of the human body, of which he had a very fair knowledge. He  had a taste for European articles, and owned a large assortment. He had  glass manufactured in his workshops, and once sent me a petroleum lamp,  every portion of which was made by his own artificers. His rule, for  such a strong man, was mild as compared with that of his predecessors,  and he thoroughly realised that his prosperity depended on his loyalty  to the British Government. At the same time, he was most tenacious  of his rights, and earnestly desired to preserve his country intact,  and to give us no excuse for annexing it.    The fear of tempting us to annex was so great that, once when I  thought of growing a little tea for my own consumption, he was much  agitated. I, as a matter of courtesy, first sent to ask him if he  had any objection to my growing a little, and, in reply, he sent an  official to beg me not to think of it. This man said, \"The Maharajah  will supply you with all the tea you want free of cost, but begs you  not to think of growing it.\" The officer went on to explain, that  it was feared that, if I successfully demonstrated that tea could  be grown in Manipur tea planters would come up, and there would be a  cry for annexation! Certainly our annexation of the Muttuk country in  1840 justified the suspicion, and we cannot blame people for having  long memories.    The Jubraj, or heir apparent, was an amiable young man of twenty-six or  twenty-seven, with a pleasant smile which was wanting in his father. He  was of a weak character, although possessing some ability. Like  his father, he could speak Hindoostani, but both were ignorant of  English. Backed up and influenced by an honest and capable Political  Agent, he would probably have made an excellent ruler, and, had we  done our duty by him, he might now be at the head of a flourishing  little state, instead of having died an exile in Calcutta.    The next son, Wankai Rakpar, afterwards known as the \"Regent\" during  the recent troubles, was an ignorant, uncouth boor, who knew no  language but his own, and was quite unfitted for any responsible work;  he took little part in public affairs. The third known as Samoo Henjaba  (Master of the Elephants), was a clever, pleasant, sensible young man,  said by Thangal Major, no mean judge of character, to be the ablest  of the ten sons of the Maharajah. He died during my tenure of office.    The fourth son, Kotwal Koireng, who afterwards acquired an infamous  reputation as the \"Senaputtee,\" was always a bad character, cruel,  coarse, and low minded. From early childhood he was given to foul  language, and was absolutely dangerous when he grew up. His mother  had been unfaithful to the Maharajah, who used to say that the son  was worthy of her. Colonel McCulloch had always disliked him as a boy.    None of the other six sons of the Maharajah were in my time mixed up  in public affairs, so I need not describe them, except that Pucca  Senna was the champion polo player, though not otherwise worthy of  notice. The practical ministers were Bularam Singh, or Sawai Jamba  Major, and Thangal Major. They were both faithful adherents of the  Maharajah, although the first who had once had much influence had  married the daughter of the former Rajah Nur Sing. He was nominally  the first in rank, but Thangal Major was rapidly gaining ground,  and viewed with increasing favour by the Maharajah.    I quote the following description of the Government of Manipur from an  article I wrote for The Nineteenth Century, by kind permission of the  editor. \"The government of Manipur has always been a pure despotism  tempered by assassination and revolution. While he occupies the throne  the rajah is perfectly absolute. A minister may be all powerful,  and all the princes and people may tremble before him; for years he  may practically rule the rajah; but he is after all a cipher before  his sovereign, a single word from whom may send him into exile, make  him an outcast, or reduce him to the lowest rank. Yet with all this  power an obscure man may suddenly spring up, as if"]]]
