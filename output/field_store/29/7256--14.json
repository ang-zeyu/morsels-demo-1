Mrs. ---- had for twelve or fifteen years, at intervals of a year or less,  a bleeding from the rectum without pain; which however stopped  spontaneously after she became weakened, or by the use of injections of  brandy and water. Lately the bleeding continued above two months, in the  quantity of many ounces a day, till she became pale and feeble to an  alarming degree. Injections of solutions of lead, of bark and salt of  steel, and of turpentine, with some internal astringents, and opiates, were  used in vain. An injection of the smoke of tobacco, with ten grains of  opium mixed with the tobacco, was used, but without effect the two first  times on account of the imperfection of the machine; on the third time it  produced great sickness, and vertigo, and nearly a fainting fit; from which  time the blood entirely stopped. Was this owing to a fungous excrescence in  the rectum; or to a blood-vessel being burst from the difficulty of the  blood passing through the vena porta from some hepatic obstruction, and  which had continued to bleed so long? Was it stopped at last by the  fainting fit? or by the stimulus of the tobacco?    7. _Haemorrhagia renum._ Haemorrhage from the kidnies, when attended with  no pain, is owing to defect of venous absorption in the kidney. When  attended with pain on motion, it is owing to a bit of gravel in the ureter  or pelvis of the kidney; which is a much more frequent disease than the  former. See Sect. XXVII. 1.    M. M. 1. Venesection in small quantity, calomel, bark, steel, an opiate;  cold immersion up to the navel, the upper part of the body being kept  cloathed. Neville-Holt water. 2. Alcalized water aerated. Much diluent  liquids. Cool dress. Cool bed-room.    Cows are much subject to bloody urine, called foul water by the farmers; in  this disease about sixty grains of opium with or without as much rust of  iron, given twice a day, in a ball mixed with flour and water, or dissolved  in warm water, or warm ale, is, I believe, an efficacious remedy, to which  however should be added about two quarts of barley or oats twice a day, and  a cover at night, if the weather be cold.    8. _Haemorrhagia Hepatis._ Haemorrhage from the liver. It sometimes happens  in those, who have the gutta rosea, or paralytic affections owing to  diseased livers induced by the potation of fermented liquors, that a great  discharge of black viscid blood occasionally comes away by stool, and  sometimes by vomiting: this the ancients called Melancholia, black bile. If  it was bile, a small quantity of it would become yellow or green on  dilution with warm water, which was not the case in one experiment which I  tried; it must remain some time in the intestines from its black colour,  when it passes downwards, and probably comes from the bile-ducts, and is  often a fatal symptom. When it is evacuated by vomiting it is less  dangerous, because it shews greater remaining irritability of the  intestinal canal, and is sometimes salutary to those who have diseased  livers.    M. M. An emetic. Rhubarb, steel, wine, bark.    9. _Haemoptoe venosa._ Venous haemoptoe frequently attends the beginning of  the hereditary consumptions of dark-eyed people; and in others, whose lungs  have too little irritability. These spittings of blood are generally in  very small quantity, as a tea-spoonful; and return at first periodically,  as about once a month; and are less dangerous in the female than in the  male sex; as in the former they are often relieved by the natural periods  of the menses. Many of these patients are attacked with this pulmonary  haemorrhage in their first sleep; because in feeble people the power of  volition is necessary, besides that of irritation, to carry on respiration  perfectly; but, as volition is suspended during sleep, a part of the blood  is delayed in the vessels of the lungs, and in consequence effused, and the  patient awakes from the disagreeable sensation. See Class I. 2. 1. 3. II.  1. 6. 6. III. 2. 1. 10.    M. M. Wake the patient every two or three hours by an alarum clock. Give  half a grain of opium at going to bed, or twice a day. Onions, garlic,  slight chalybeates. Issues. Leeches applied once a fortnight or month to  the hemorrhoidal veins to produce a new habit. Emetics after each period of  haemoptoe, to promote expectoration, and dislodge any effused blood, which  might by remaining in the lungs produce ulcers by its putridity. A hard  bed, to prevent too sound sleep. A periodical emetic or cathartic once a  fortnight.    10. _Palpitatio cordis._ The palpitation of the heart frequently attends  the haemoptoe above mentioned; and consists in an ineffectual exertion of  the heart to push forwards its contents in due time, and with due force.  The remote cause is frequently some impediment to the general circulation;  as the torpor of the capillaries in cold paroxysms of fever, or great  adhesions of the lungs. At other times it arises from the debility of the  action of the heart owing to the deficient sensorial power of irritation or  of association, as at the approach of death.    In both these cases of weak exertion the heart feels large to the touch, as  it does not completely empty itself at each contraction; and on that  account contracts more frequently, as described in Sect. XXXII. 2. 2.  Another kind of palpitation may sometimes arise from the retrograde motions  of the heart, as in fear. See Class I. 3. 1. 2. and IV. 3. 1. 6.    11. _Menorrhagia._ Continued flow of the catamenia. The monthly effusion of  blood from the uterus or vagina is owing to a torpor of the veins of those  membranes in consequence of the defect of venereal stimulus; and in this  respect resembles the mucus discharged in the periodical venereal orgasm of  the female quadrupeds, which are secluded from the males. The menorrhagia,  or continued flow of this discharge, is owing to a continued defect of the  venous absorption of the membranes of the uterus or vagina. See Class IV.  2. 4. 7.    M. M. Venesection in small quantity. A cathartic. Then opium, a grain every  night. Steel. Bark. A blister. Topical aspersion with cold water, or cold  vinegar.    12. _Dysmenorrhagia._ A difficulty of menstruation attended with pain. In  this complaint the torpor of the uterine vessels, which precedes  menstruation, is by sympathy accompanied with a torpor of the lumbar  membranes, and consequent pain; and frequently with cold extremities, and  general debility. The small quantity and difficulty of the discharge is  owing to arterial inactivity, as in chlorosis. Whence it happens, that  chalybeate medicines are of efficacy both to stop or prevent too great  menstruation, and to promote or increase deficient menstruation; as the  former is owing to inirritability of the veins, and the latter of the  arteries of the uterus. See Article IV. 2. 6. in the Materia Medica.    M. M. Opium, steel, pediluvium. Warm bath.    13. _Lochia nimia._ Too great discharge after delivery. In that unnatural  practice of some hasty accoucheurs of introducing the hand into the uterus  immediately after the delivery of the child, and forcibly bringing away the  placenta, it frequently happens, that a part of it is left behind; and the  uterus, not having power to exclude so small a portion of it, is prevented  from complete contraction, and a great haemorrhage ensues. In this  circumstance a bandage with a thick compress on the lower part of the  belly, by appressing the sides of the uterus on the remaining part of the  placenta, is likely to check the haemorrhage, like the application of a  pledget of any soft substance on a bleeding vessel.    In other cases the lochia continues too long, or in too great quantity,  owing to the deficiency of venous absorption.    M. M. An enema. An opiate. A blister. Slight chalybeates. Peruvian bark.  Clothes dipped in cold vinegar and applied externally. Bandages on the  limbs to keep more blood in them for a time have been recommended.    14. _Abortio spontanea._ Some delicate ladies are perpetually liable to  spontaneous abortion, before the third, or after the seventh, month of  gestation. From some of these patients I have learnt, that they have  awakened with a slight degree of difficult respiration, so as to induce  them to rise hastily up in bed; and have hence suspected, that this was a  tendency to a kind of asthma, owing to a deficient absorption of blood in  the extremities of the pulmonary or bronchial veins; and have concluded  from thence, that there was generally a deficiency of venous absorption;  and that this was the occasion of their frequent abortion. Which is further  countenanced, where a great sanguinary discharge precedes or follows the  exclusion of the fetus.    M. M. Opium, bark, chalybeates in small quantity. Change to a warmer  climate. I have directed with success in four cases half a grain of opium  twice a day for a fortnight, and then a whole grain twice a day during the  whole gestation. One of these patients took besides twenty grains of  Peruvian bark for several weeks. By these means being exactly and regularly  persisted in, a new habit became established, and the usual miscarriages  were prevented.    Miscarriages more frequently happen from eruptive fevers, and from  rheumatic ones, than from other inflammatory diseases. I saw a most violent  pleurisy and hepatitis cured by repeated venesection about a week or ten  days before parturition; yet another lady whom I attended, miscarried at  the end of the chicken pox, with which her children were at the same time  affected. Miscarriages towards the termination of the small pox are very  frequent, yet there have been a few instances of children, who have been  born with the eruption on them. The blood in the small pox will not  inoculate that disease, if taken before the commencement of the secondary  fever; as shewn in Sect.

Algeria has the fifth-largest  reserves of natural gas in the world and is the second largest gas  exporter; it ranks fourteenth for oil reserves. Algiers' efforts to  reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world  stalled in 1992 as the country became embroiled in political  turmoil. Algeria's financial and economic indicators improved during  the mid-1990s, in part because of policy reforms supported by the  IMF and debt rescheduling from the Paris Club. Algeria's finances in  2000 benefited from the spike in oil prices and the government's  tight fiscal policy, leading to a large increase in the trade  surplus, the near tripling of foreign exchange reserves, and  reduction in foreign debt. The government continues efforts to  diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment  outside the energy sector, but has had little success in reducing  high unemployment and improving living standards.

The US formally occupied its portion - a smaller group of eastern  islands with the excellent harbor of Pago Pago - the following year.
