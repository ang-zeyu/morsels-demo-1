The _preventive_ is, good yokes; the  application of grease; or a decoction of white or yellow oak bark  applied to the affected parts. Or, a better preventive is a canvass or  leather cap to protect the neck entirely from the storm.      The Bite of Poisonous Snakes    May be cured by shaking together equal parts of olive oil and hartshorn,  and rubbing the wound and adjacent parts three or four times a day. For  a full-grown animal, one quart of olive oil and an ounce of hartshorn  should be administered internally, in addition to the above.      For Stings of Bees, Hornets, &c.    Apply warm vinegar and salt, rubbing the parts thoroughly.      For a Forming Tumor.    Rub thoroughly with strong brine, or a solution of sal ammoniac  dissolved in eight times its weight of water. If the tumor comes to a  head, open it near the bottom with a lancet; or place a seton in it so  as to admit the escape of purulent matter.      Lice and Vermin    Sometimes abound on cattle during the latter part of winter and spring.  These are generally the result of _mange_, which is itself the effect of  ill-feeding and ill-condition. They are removed with the cause. We doubt  if they can be permanently kept off, where the animal is losing flesh  and health.    _Remedies._--Restore the health and condition, and sprinkle sand, ashes,  or dirt plentifully around the roots of the horns, and along the ridge  of the neck and back.    A liberal application of train or other oil has nearly a similar effect.    Never apply an ointment containing corrosive sublimate or other poison,  as it may be licked by the animal or its fellows, who may thus become  seriously poisoned.      The Trembles,    Producing _milk sickness_ (a most fatal disease) in the human family,  from eating the milk or flesh of animals affected by it. This disease,  which exists principally in the region of the Wabash River, is supposed  by Dr. Drake to be owing to the _poison oak_, (Rhus Toxicodendron,) or  _poison vine_, (Radicans,) which the animals eat.    _Symptoms._--The animal mopes, is feverish and costive, but apparently  preserves its appetite. The next stage of the disease is faintness and  vertigo, which is shown when the animal is put upon exertion, being  followed by excessive _trembling_ and entire prostration.    _Remedy._--Almost every cathartic has been tried in vain. Indian corn,  both dry and green, has been fed to all animals accustomed to eating it,  and when they can be induced to feed upon it freely, purging is  generally secured. Rest of the animal is absolutely essential while the  disease continues, and is itself an effectual remedy in mild cases.           *       *       *       *       *    Besides the diseases enumerated, there are occasional epidemics, such as  _black tongue_, _black foot_, or _foot root_, _&c._, which carry off  great numbers of animals. Remedies for these are frequently not  discovered, and the epidemic is allowed to run its course unchecked. The  only preventives are such care, food, and management as the experienced  herdsman knows to be best suited to the maintenance of the health and  thrift of his stock.    _Note._--Some ailments will be found under the head of _diseases_ of the  other animals mentioned in this work, the general resemblance of which  to each other will justify nearly a similar treatment.    If intelligent _farriers_ are at hand, they may sometimes be called in  with advantage; though we acknowledge our distrust of the quackery of  most of those passing under this title. There is little science or  intelligent study in the composition of this class, the world over; and  much of their practice is the merest empiricism. The owner should see to  it, if he employs one of whose attainments he is doubtful, that neither  medicines nor operations be used, unnecessarily severe or hazardous to  the animal. Especially, should the diabolical practice be interdicted,  of the abundant and indiscriminate use of poisons, boiling oils,  turpentine, and tar, and the hot iron applied to the sensitive wound or  naked flesh. If certain or effectual remedies for the removal of disease  cannot he applied, such as augment the suffering or endanger the life of  the poor dumb things, may at least be avoided.          CHAPTER III.    THE DAIRY.      Cows for the Dairy.    From what has been said on the various characteristics of the different  breeds of cattle, it must be evident, that no very definite criteria of  excellence can be given for all good dairy cows. But there are certain  points in a good milker, that can hardly be mistaken.    She should be descended from the best milking stock; her head should be  small or of medium size, muzzle fine, and nostrils flexible and  expanded; face long, slender, and dishing; cheeks thin; eyes full, mild,  and prominent; horns delicate and waxy, and they may be either  branching, lopped, crumpled, or hornless; long, thin, lively ear, and  the inside of an orange color; neck thin and small at its junction with  the head; deep chest, but not too heavy before; back level and broad;  well ribbed; belly large; low flank; wide thighs, but thin; short legs,  and standing well apart; large milking veins; loose, capacious udder,  coming well out behind; good teats; loose, mellow skin, of a deep  yellow; and a fine, thick coat of glossy hair; and she must be of a good  disposition, and free from tricks.    Yet, with all the skill of a well-practised taste in the selection of  animals, the dairyman will frequently find his theories and results at  sad variance. One may sometimes select a fine animal, with every  appearance of good milking qualities, which is but a medium cow at the  pail; and another, that hardly seems worthy of notice, and which sets at  defiance many established milking points, and all preconceived notions  of symmetry, may yet prove a good milker. A cow that runs to flesh while  in milk, is generally an indifferent animal for the dairy. Perfection  in a cow, consists in converting all she eats into milk while yielding  it, and when dry, in turning all she consumes into valuable meat.      Management of Dairy Cows.    A cow may have her first calf when between two and three years of age,  according to her size and development. After calving, she should be  stinted in her food for two or three days, and not fed freely for a  week. Avoid fat in a breeding cow. Too high feeding is the cause of  milk-fever, caked bag, garget, and a host of evils; and very poor feed  is almost equally objectionable.    The average time of a cow with young, is from 40 to 41 weeks; but they  sometimes go only 34, and occasionally overrun 44.    A dry, unoccupied stall or yard is best for her to calve in; and if  there is any serious delay or difficulty in the operation, she may be  assisted by placing the f[oe]tus in the right position, and gently  pulling it, with every throe of the dam. After the calf has drawn all he  wants at morning and evening, the bag should be thoroughly and quickly  emptied of all the milk. If strong and vigorous, the calf is the best  doctor for garget or caked bag. He may be allowed to suck the cow or  not, at the option of the owner; there are reasons for and against the  practice, as will be seen under the head of rearing calves, and each  person must determine in his own case on which side the balance lies.      Milking.    This is an important operation, and on its proper performance depends  much of the success of the dairyman. A cow regularly, gently, yet  quickly and thoroughly milked, will give much more than if neglected. If  a herd of cows be separated into two divisions, each yielding the same  quantity of milk, and one is given to a good milker, and the other to a  shiftless or lazy one, the latter will speedily reduce his milk much  below the quantity obtained by the former; and if the milkers then  exchange cows, they will be found to change quantity too, those before  affording the least, soon giving the most. An indifferent milker ought  never to be tolerated in a herd, good ones are cheaper at double the  price. It is best to milk at intervals of about 12 hours; which may be  done when pastures are convenient, or cows are soiled or fed in the  yard. But as this is not often the case in the season of green food,  they should be milked early in the morning and turned into pasture, to  fill themselves before the sun is oppressive; and if they are to be kept  up at night, let them browse in the pasture as long as possible, before  they are brought to the yard.      MILK    Is produced from the females of all the warm-blooded animals, which are  enumerated among the mammaliae. The milk of several animals is employed  for domestic purposes, among different nations. That of the camel is  used by the Arabs; the milk of the ass by the Spaniards, the Maltese,  and the inhabitants of the Levant; that of the mare by the Cossacks, the  Kirgheez, and other Tartars; and that of the goat, the ewe, and the cow,  by most of the ancient, and with few exceptions, by every modern  European nation. Within the last century, however, the use of all  excepting cow's milk has been almost entirely discarded, among the most  highly civilized people.    If we except some few Welsh and Swiss, or other emigrants, who resort to  the goat and ewe for their dairy materials, for the first few years of  their residence here, the cow is the only animal which is employed in  America for producing milk. For this, she is pre-eminently fitted, and  the modern improvement of this invaluable animal has carried her product  of milk almost as far as can be reasonably looked for from a given  amount of food; and although this is of about the average richness of  the goat and ewe, and before that of the ass, the quantity she yields is  frequently as 60 to 1, in favor of the cow, over the first two  competitors."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3421"],[0,"Bramble-Bees and Others (#14)"],[1,"are  as follows:    2a = 13 mm. (.507 inch.--Translator's Note.), 2b = 7 mm. (.273  inch.--Translator's Note.) in the females;    2a = 9 mm. (.351 inch.--Translator's Note.), 2b = 5 mm. (.195  inch.--Translator's Note.) in the males.    The ratio therefore between 13 x 7 x 7 = 637 and 9 x 5 x 5 = 225 will be  more or less the ratio between the sizes of the two sexes. This ratio  is somewhere between 2 to 1 and 3 to 1. The females therefore are two or  three times larger than the males, a proportion already suggested by a  comparison of the mass of provisions, estimated simply by the eye.    The Horned Osmia gives us the following average dimensions:    2a = 15 mm. (.585 inch.--Translator's Note.), 2b = 9 mm. (.351  inch.--Translator's Note.) in the females;    2a = 12 mm. (.468 inch.--Translator's Note.), 2b = 7 mm. (.273  inch.--Translator's Note.) in the males.    Once again, the ratio between 15 x 9 x 9 = 1215 and 12 x 7 x 7 = 588  lies between 2 to 1 and 3 to 1.    Besides the Bees who arrange their laying in a row, I have consulted  others whose cells are grouped in a way that makes it possible to  ascertain the relative order of the two sexes, though not quite so  precisely. One of these is the Mason-bee of the Walls. I need not  describe again her dome-shaped nest, built on a pebble, which is now so  well-known to us. (Cf. \"The Mason-bees\": chapter 1.--Translator's Note.)    Each mother chooses her stone and works on it in solitude. She is an  ungracious landowner and guards her site jealously, driving away any  Mason who even looks as though she might alight on it. The inhabitants  of the same nest are therefore always brothers and sisters; they are the  family of one mother.    Moreover, if the stone presents a large enough surface--a condition  easily fulfilled--the Mason-bee has no reason to leave the support  on which she began her laying and go in search of another whereon to  deposit the rest of her eggs. She is too thrifty of her time and of her  mortar to involve herself in such expenditure except for grave reasons.  Consequently, each nest, at least when it is new, when the Bee herself  has laid the first foundations, contains the entire laying. It is a  different thing when an old nest is restored and made into a place for  depositing the eggs. I shall come back later to such houses.    A newly-built nest then, with rare exceptions, contains the entire  laying of one female. Count the cells and we shall have the total list  of the family. Their maximum number fluctuates round about fifteen.  The most luxuriant series will occasionally reach as many as eighteen,  though these are very scarce.    When the surface of the stone is regular all around the site of the  first cell, when the mason can add to her building with the same  facility in every direction, it is obvious that the groups of cells,  when finished, will have the oldest in the central portion and the more  recent in the surrounding portion. Because of this juxtaposition of  the cells, which serve partly as a wall to those which come next, it is  possible to form some estimate of the chronological order of the cells  in the Chalicodoma's nest and thus to discover the sequence of the two  sexes.    In winter, by which time the Bee has long been in the perfect state, I  collect Chalicodoma-nests, removing them bodily from their support with  a few smart sideward taps of the hammer on the pebbles. At the base of  the mortar dome the cells are wide agape and display their contents. I  take the cocoon from its box, open it and take note of the sex of the  insect enclosed.    I should probably be accused of exaggeration if I mentioned the total  number of the nests which I have gathered and the cells which I have  inspected by this method during the last six or seven years. I will  content myself with saying that the harvest of a single morning  sometimes consisted of as many as sixty nests of the Mason-bee. I had to  have help in carrying home my spoils, even though the nests were removed  from their stones on the spot.    From the enormous number of nests which I have examined, I am able to  state that, when the cluster is regular, the female cells occupy the  centre and the male cells the edges. Where the irregularity of the  pebble has prevented an even distribution around the initial point, the  same rule has been observed. A male cell is never surrounded on every  side by female cells: either it occupies the edges of the nest, or else  it adjoins, at least on some sides, other male cells, of which the last  form part of the exterior of the cluster. As the surrounding cells are  obviously of a later date than the inner cells, it follows that the  Mason-bee acts like the Osmiae: she begins her laying with females  and ends it with males, each of the sexes forming a series of its own,  independent of the other.    Some further circumstances add their testimony to that of the surrounded  and surrounding cells. When the pebble projects sharply and forms a sort  of dihedral angle, one of whose faces is more or less vertical and the  other horizontal, this angle is a favourite site with the Mason, who  thus finds greater stability for her edifice in the support given her by  the double plane. These sites appear to me to be in great request with  the Chalicodoma, considering the number of nests which I find thus  doubly supported. In nests of this kind, all the cells, as usual, have  their foundations fixed to the horizontal surface; but the first row,  the row of cells first built, stands with its back against the vertical  surface.    Well, these older cells, which occupy the actual edge of the dihedral  angle, are always female, with the exception of those at either end of  the row, which, as they belong to the outside, may be male cells. In  front of this first row come others. The female cells occupy the middle  portion and the male the ends. Finally, the last row, closing in the  remainder, contains only male cells. The progress of the work is very  visible here: the Mason has begun by attending to the central group of  female cells, the first row of which occupies the dihedral angle, and  has finished her task by distributing the male cells round the outside.    If the perpendicular face of the dihedral angle be high enough, it  sometimes happens that a second row of cells is placed above the first  row backing on to that plane; a third row occurs less often. The nest is  then one of several storeys. The lower storeys, the older, contain only  females; the upper, the more recent storey, contains none but males. It  goes without saying that the surface layer, even of the lower storeys,  can contain males without invalidating the rule, for this layer may  always be looked upon as the Chalicodoma's last work.    Everything therefore contributes to show that, in the Mason-bee, the  females take the lead in the order of primogeniture. Theirs is the  central and best-protected part of the clay fortress; the outer part,  that most exposed to the inclemencies of the weather and to accidents,  is for the males.    The males' cells do not differ from the females' only by being placed at  the outside of the cluster; they differ also in their capacity, which is  much smaller. To estimate the respective capacities of the two sorts  of cells, I go to work as follows: I fill the empty cell with very fine  sand and pour this sand back into a glass tube measuring 5 millimetres  (.195 inch.--Translator's Note.) in diameter. From the height of the  column of sand we can estimate the comparative capacity of the two kinds  of cells. I will take one at random among my numerous examples of cells  thus gauged.    It comprises thirteen cells and occupies a dihedral angle. The female  cells give me the following figures, in millimetres, as the height of  the columns of sand:    40, 44, 43, 48, 48, 46, 47 (1.56, 1.71, 1.67, 1.87, 1.87, 1.79, 1.83  inches.--Translator's Note.),    averaging 45. (1.75 inches.--Translator's Note.)    The male cells give me:    32, 35, 28, 30, 30, 31 (1.24, 1.36, 1.09, 1.17, 1.17, 1.21  inches.--Translator's Note.),    averaging 31. (1.21 inches.--Translator's Note.)    The ratio of the capacity of the cells for the two sexes is therefore  roughly a ratio of 4 to 3. The actual contents of the cell being  proportionate to its capacity, the above ratio must also be more or  less the ratio of provisions and sizes between females and males. These  figures will assist us presently to tell whether an old cell, occupied  for a second or third time, belonged originally to a female or a male.    The Chalicodoma of the Sheds cannot give us any information on this  matter. She builds under the same eaves, in excessively populous  colonies; and it is impossible to follow the labours of any single  Mason, whose cells, distributed here and there, are soon covered up  with the work of her neighbours. All is muddle and confusion in the  individual output of the swarming throng.    I have not watched the work of the Chalicodoma of the Shrubs with close  enough attention to be able to state definitely that this Bee is a  solitary builder. Her nest is a ball of clay hanging from a bough.  Sometimes, this nest is the size of a large walnut and then appears to  be the work of one alone; sometimes, it is the size of a man's fist, in  which case I have no doubt that it is the work of several. Those bulky  nests, comprising more than fifty cells, can tell us nothing exact, as a  number of workers must certainly have collaborated to produce them.    The walnut-sized nests are more trustworthy, for everything seems to  indicate that they were built by a single Bee. Here females are found  in the centre of the group and males at the circumference, in somewhat  smaller cells, thus repeating what the Mason-bee of the Pebbles has told  us.    One clear and simple rule stands out from this collection of facts.  Apart from the strange exception of the Three-"]]]
