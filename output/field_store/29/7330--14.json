BROWNED CRACKERS    Split crackers, arrange them in a dripping pan, place in a moderate oven  until crisp and delicately browned.      LAMB CHOPS BREADED    Prepare loin or French chops as for broiling. Dip in crumbs, egg  (diluted with cold water, allowing two tablespoons water to each egg),  add in crumbs, and fry in deep hot Cottolene six to eight minutes. Drain  on brown paper and spread with Maitre d'Hotel Butter.      NEW POTATOES WITH CHIVE SAUCE    Scrape off the skin, remove the \"eyes\" with a sharp pointed knife and  scrub them with a vegetable brush, rinse thoroughly and put in sauce  pan, add boiling water to cover; season with salt, cover and cook until  soft, drain. If small, serve whole; if large, cut them in one-half inch  cubes and reheat in Chive Sauce.      CHIVE SAUCE    To Cream Sauce (see Page 151) add one tablespoon finely chopped Chives.      GREEN PEAS    Cook peas in boiling water. Use just enough water to prevent them from  burning. Add salt fifteen minutes before removing them from fire. Season  with butter and pepper.      JUNE SALAD    Remove stones from red and pink Ox-heart cherries and cut them in halves  lengthwise. Remove the pulp from oranges and cut in inch cubes; peel  bananas and cut in one-half inch cubes. Use equal quantities of each and  marinate with French Dressing No. 2. Serve in nests of heart lettuce  leaves and mask with Mayonnaise.    FRENCH DRESSING No. 2              1/4 teaspoon salt.            4 tablespoons Olive oil.            1/8 teaspoon paprika.            2 tablespoons lemon juice.    PROCESS: Put seasoning in small bowl, add oil slowly, stirring  constantly; add lemon juice slowly, continue beating until all is used.  Chill, beat again and turn over fruit.    MAYONNAISE DRESSING              1/2 teaspoon salt.            Few grains cayenne.            Yolks 2 eggs.            1-1/2 tablespoons lemon juice, or            3/4 tablespoon each of vinegar and lemon juice.            3/4 cup Olive oil.    PROCESS: Put seasoning in bowl, add egg yolks and mix thoroughly, add  oil drop by drop, until four tablespoons have been added, after which  larger quantities may be added. Stir constantly. As mixture thickens,  add a teaspoon lemon juice or vinegar. Continue adding oil and lemon  juice or vinegar alternately until all is used, stirring constantly. All  ingredients should be very cold. Set bowl in which dressing is made in a  bowl of crushed ice.      CHERRY PIE    Pick over, stem and pit cherries (there should be two cups when pitted).  Heat to boiling point in their own juice, then chill them. Line a  perforated pie pan with Rich Paste, moisten the rim with cold water and  lay around a strip of pastry one inch wide, press lightly. Brush the  pastry over with slightly beaten white of egg. Sweeten cherries to  taste, add a few grains of salt and turn into lined pie pan. Sift over  two tablespoons flour, moisten rim and cover with top crust, flute the  edges and bake in hot oven for the first ten minutes, then reduce heat,  continue baking for twenty-five minutes. Serve hot with cheese, cut in  strips one-fourth inch thick and wide by two and one-half inches long.      ICED TEA    Make tea and chill. Serve in glasses filled with crushed ice, adding (if  desired) one tablespoon lemon juice to each glass. Pass fine granulated  (Bar) sugar. Place each glass on a small plate.

Spread lightly with French or German  mustard, sprinkle thickly with grated cheese, sprinkle cheese with  finely chopped olives. Place a small stuffed olive in center of each.  Dispose on a small plate covered with a paper doily. Garnish with sprays  of parsley and serve as an \"appetizer.\"      HAMBURG ROAST    Remove the fat and stringy parts, also marrow-bone, from two pounds  round steak. Pass through the meat grinder twice; add the marrow taken  from bone, one tablespoon green pepper finely chopped, one tablespoon  onion finely chopped, season well with salt and the beaten yolks of two  eggs or one whole egg slightly beaten; add one-half cup of soft bread  crumbs that have been soaked in cold water thirty minutes and wrung dry  in a double cheese cloth. Mix ingredients thoroughly with the hand.  Shape in a compact roll of uniform thickness. Lay thin slices of salt  pork or bacon in the bottom of a dripping pan, set the roast on them;  lay thin slices of salt pork over the meat and place in a hot oven.  After the first eight minutes reduce the heat and baste with the hot  fat in the pan; let cook about thirty minutes, basting every ten  minutes. The roast should be richly browned on the outside and a  delicate pink inside. Serve surrounded with Tomato, Brown or Creole  Sauce.    BROWN SAUCE              2 tablespoons butter.            1 slice onion.            4 tablespoons flour.            1-1/2 cups Brown Stock.            1/4 teaspoon salt.            1/8 teaspoon pepper.    PROCESS: Melt butter in sauce pan, add onion and cook until delicately  browned; remove onion, and cook butter until richly browned, stirring  constantly; add flour sifted with seasonings, stir to a paste and  continue browning. Then pour on stock, slowly stirring until smooth and  glossy. Onion may be omitted.      ROAST NEW POTATOES    Select uniform-sized new potatoes, wash and scrub them with a brush,  pare and parboil ten to fifteen minutes (according to the size) in  boiling salted water. Drain and place them around rack in dripping pan  in which meat is roasting and cook until tender. Baste occasionally with  fat in pan when basting roast.      GREEN PEAS AND NEW CARROTS IN CREAM SAUCE    Cook one and one-half cups of peas in just enough water to prevent them  from burning. Add salt fifteen minutes before removing them from range.    Wash, scrub and scrape new carrots and cut them in one-fourth inch cubes  (there should be one and one-half cups); cook in boiling salted water  until tender. Drain and mix with peas. Reheat them in one and one-half  cups of Cream Sauce (for recipe see Page 151).      GARDEN CRESS WITH ORANGES    Arrange individual nests of Garden Cress on six chilled salad plates.  Cut eight oranges in halves, remove the pulp, discarding veins and  sections. Leave the pulp in the original shape as taken from the  sections; divide the pulp evenly between the six nests. Serve with  French Dressing and sprinkle each portion with paprika and a few grains  cayenne. Omit the garlic when using fruit.    FRENCH DRESSING              1/2 teaspoon salt.            1/8 teaspoon pepper.            1/4 teaspoon paprika.            6 tablespoons olive oil.            2 tablespoons vinegar.            Garlic.    PROCESS: Rub the mixing bowl with a bruised clove of garlic; add salt,  pepper, paprika and oil; beat until ingredients are thoroughly blended,  adding vinegar slowly meanwhile. A piece of ice put into bowl while  stirring will aid in chilling the mixture.      CURRANT PIE              2-1/2 cups cleaned currants.            2 cups sugar.            1/8 teaspoon salt.            2 eggs slightly beaten.            2 tablespoons flour.    PROCESS: Mix the ingredients in the order given. Turn in a lined pie  pan, heaping currants in center; cover with top crust, press and flute  the edges. Bake as other berry pies. Serve hot. Sprinkle with powdered  sugar.      CHERRY PUNCH    Boil two cups sugar and one cup water until a rich syrup is formed. Add  one cup of lemon juice and two cups of Cherry juice, left over when  canning cherries. (This left-over juice may be brought to the boiling  point, skimmed and turned into sterilized fruit jars, sealed and stored  as canned fruit and may be used for punch or pudding sauce.) Add two  cups cold water. Fill a claret pitcher with cracked ice; add mixture.  When serving, place a thin slice of orange, three or four strawberries  and three pitted California cherries in each glass, fill three-fourths  full with mixture. Serve very cold.

Poach the yolks  of six eggs in hot water until firm; remove from water with a skimmer.  Place one yolk in each Bouillon cup and pour on hot consomme. Sprinkle  slightly with finely chopped chives or parsley.      FRIED PERCH    Select fresh perch of medium size. Clean, bone and wipe dry as possible.  Sprinkle with salt, pepper, dip in flour, egg, and crumbs (be sure fish  are well coated with crumbs). Lay three at a time in a croquette basket  and fry a golden brown in deep hot Cottolene. Cottolene should not be so  hot as to brown fish at once, as fish will not be cooked through. (Time  required for frying small fish is from four to six minutes.) Drain on  brown paper and serve with Sauce Tartare. Garnish with parsley, lemon  slices and radishes cut to imitate roses.

The drifts are so hard they'll carry, and the snow  will be pretty well blown off the middle of the fields. It's only  three-quarters of a mile. We boys will go home and get a pung and come  back for you girls.\"    But the girls wouldn't listen to this. They must go with us, even  Cecily.    \"Seems to me yez weren't in such a hurry to leave last night,\" observed  Peg sarcastically.    \"Oh, it's only because they'll be so anxious about us at home, and it's  Sunday and we don't want to miss Sunday School,\" explained Felicity.    \"Well, I hope your Sunday School will do yez good,\" said Peg, rather  grumpily. But she relented again at the last and gave Cecily a wishbone.    \"Whatever you wish on that will come true,\" she said. \"But you only have  the one wish, so don't waste it.\"    \"We're so much obliged to you for all your trouble,\" said the Story Girl  politely.    \"Never mind the trouble. The expense is the thing,\" retorted Peg grimly.    \"Oh!\" Felicity hesitated. \"If you would let us pay you--give you  something--\"    \"No, thank yez,\" responded Peg loftily. \"There is people who take money  for their hospitality, I've heerd, but I'm thankful to say I don't  associate with that class. Yez are welcome to all yez have had here, if  yez ARE in a big hurry to get away.\"    She shut the door behind us with something of a slam, and her black  cat followed us so far, with stealthy, furtive footsteps, that we were  frightened of it. Eventually it turned back; then, and not till then,  did we feel free to discuss our adventure.    \"Well, I'm thankful we're out of THAT,\" said Felicity, drawing a long  breath. \"Hasn't it just been an awful experience?\"    \"We might all have been found frozen stark and stiff this morning,\"  remarked the Story Girl with apparent relish.    \"I tell you, it was a lucky thing we got to Peg Bowen's,\" said Dan.    \"Miss Marwood says there is no such thing as luck,\" protested Cecily.  \"We ought to say it was Providence instead.\"    \"Well, Peg and Providence don't seem to go together very well, somehow,\"  retorted Dan. \"If Peg is a witch it must be the Other One she's in co.  with.\"    \"Dan, it's getting to be simply scandalous the way you talk,\" said  Felicity. \"I just wish ma could hear you.\"    \"Is soap in porridge any worse than tooth-powder in rusks, lovely  creature?\" asked Dan.    \"Dan, Dan,\" admonished Cecily, between her coughs, \"remember it's  Sunday.\"    \"It seems hard to remember that,\" said Peter. \"It doesn't seem a mite  like Sunday and it seems awful long since yesterday.\"    \"Cecily, you've got a dreadful cold,\" said the Story Girl anxiously.    \"In spite of Peg's ginger tea,\" added Felix.    \"Oh, that ginger tea was AWFUL,\" exclaimed poor Cecily. \"I thought I'd  never get it down--it was so hot with ginger--and there was so much of  it! But I was so frightened of offending Peg I'd have tried to drink it  all if there had been a bucketful. Oh, yes, it's very easy for you all  to laugh! You didn't have to drink it.\"    \"We had to eat two meals, though,\" said Felicity with a shiver. \"And I  don't know when those dishes of hers were washed. I just shut my eyes  and took gulps.\"    \"Did you notice the soapy taste in the porridge?\" asked the Story Girl.    \"Oh, there were so many queer tastes about it I didn't notice one more  than another,\" answered Felicity wearily.    \"What bothers me,\" remarked Peter absently, \"is that skull. Do you  suppose Peg really finds things out by it?\"    \"Nonsense! How could she?\" scoffed Felix, bold as a lion in daylight.    \"She didn't SAY she did, you know,\" I said cautiously.    \"Well, we'll know in time if the things she said were going to happen  do,\" mused Peter.    \"Do you suppose your father is really coming home?\" queried Felicity.    \"I hope not,\" answered Peter decidedly.    \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\" said Felicity severely.    \"No, I oughtn't. Father got drunk all the time he was home, and wouldn't  work and was bad to mother,\" said Peter defiantly. \"She had to support  him as well as herself and me. I don't want to see any father coming  home, and you'd better believe it. Of course, if he was the right sort  of a father it'd be different.\"    \"What I would like to know is if Aunt Olivia is going to be married,\"  said the Story Girl absently. \"I can hardly believe it. But now that  I think of it--Uncle Roger has been teasing her ever since she was in  Halifax last summer.\"    \"If she does get married you'll have to come and live with us,\" said  Cecily delightedly.    Felicity did not betray so much delight and the Story Girl remarked with  a weary little sigh that she hoped Aunt Olivia wouldn't. We all felt  rather weary, somehow. Peg's predictions had been unsettling, and our  nerves had all been more or less strained during our sojourn under her  roof. We were glad when we found ourselves at home.    The folks had not been at all troubled about us, but it was because they  were sure the storm had come up before we would think of leaving Cousin  Mattie's and not because they had received any mysterious message from  Peg's skull. We were relieved at this, but on the whole, our adventure  had not done much towards clearing up the vexed question of Peg's  witchcraft.          CHAPTER IX. EXTRACTS FROM THE FEBRUARY AND MARCH NUMBERS OF \"OUR  MAGAZINE\"      RESOLUTION HONOUR ROLL    Miss Felicity King.      HONOURABLE MENTION    Mr. Felix King. Mr. Peter Craig. Miss Sara Ray.      EDITORIAL    The editor wishes to make a few remarks about the Resolution Honour  Roll. As will be seen, only one name figures on it. Felicity says she  has thought a beautiful thought every morning before breakfast without  missing one morning, not even the one we were at Peg Bowen's. Some of  our number think it not fair that Felicity should be on the honour  roll (FELICITY, ASIDE: \"That's Dan, of course.\") when she only made one  resolution and won't tell us what any of the thoughts were. So we  have decided to give honourable mention to everybody who has kept one  resolution perfect. Felix has worked all his arithmetic problems by  himself. He complains that he never got more than a third of them  right and the teacher has marked him away down; but one cannot keep  resolutions without some inconvenience. Peter has never played tit-tat-x  in church or got drunk and says it wasn't as bad as he expected. (PETER,  INDIGNANTLY: \"I never said it.\" CECILY, SOOTHINGLY: \"Now, Peter, Bev  only meant that as a joke.\") Sara Ray has never talked any mean gossip,  but does not find conversation as interesting as it used to be. (SARA  RAY, WONDERINGLY: \"I don't remember of saying that.\")    Felix did not eat any apples until March, but forgot and ate seven the  day we were at Cousin Mattie's. (FELIX: \"I only ate five!\") He soon gave  up trying to say what he thought always. He got into too much trouble.  We think Felix ought to change to old Grandfather King's rule. It was,  \"Hold your tongue when you can, and when you can't tell the truth.\"  Cecily feels she has not read all the good books she might, because some  she tried to read were very dull and the Pansy books were so much more  interesting. And it is no use trying not to feel bad because her hair  isn't curly and she has marked that resolution out. The Story Girl came  very near to keeping her resolution to have all the good times possible,  but she says she missed two, if not three, she might have had. Dan  refuses to say anything about his resolutions and so does the editor.      PERSONALS    We regret that Miss Cecily King is suffering from a severe cold.    Mr. Alexander Marr of Markdale died very suddenly last week. We never  heard of his death till he was dead.    Miss Cecily King wishes to state that she did not ask the question about  \"Holy Moses\" and the other word in the January number. Dan put it in for  a mean joke.    The weather has been cold and fine. We have only had one bad storm. The  coasting on Uncle Roger's hill continues good.    Aunt Eliza did not favour us with a visit after all. She took cold and  had to go home. We were sorry that she had a cold but glad that she had  to go home. Cecily said she thought it wicked of us to be glad. But when  we asked her \"cross her heart\" if she wasn't glad herself she had to say  she was.    Miss Cecily King has got three very distinguished names on her quilt  square. They are the Governor and his wife and a witch's.    The King family had the honour of entertaining the Governor's wife to  tea on February the seventeenth. We are all invited to visit Government  House but some of us think we won't go.    A tragic event occurred last Tuesday. Mrs. James Frewen came to tea and  there was no pie in the house. Felicity has not yet fully recovered.    A new boy is coming to school. His name is Cyrus Brisk and his folks  moved up from Markdale. He says he is going to punch Willy Fraser's head  if Willy keeps on thinking he is Miss Cecily King's beau.    (CECILY: \"I haven't ANY beau! I don't mean to think of such a thing for  at least eight years yet!\")    Miss Alice Reade of Charlottetown Royalty has come to Carlisle to teach  music. She boards at Mr. Peter Armstrong's. The girls are all going to  take music lessons from her. Two descriptions of her will be found in  another column. Felix wrote one, but the girls thought he did not do her  justice, so Cecily wrote another one. She admits she copied most of the  description out of Valeria H. Montague's story Lord Marmaduke's First,  Last, and Only Love; or the Bride of the Castle by the Sea, but says  they fit Miss Reade better than anything she could make up.      HOUSEHOLD DEPARTMENT    Always keep the kitchen tidy and then you needn't mind if company comes  unexpectedly.    ANXIOUS INQUIRER: We don't know anything that will take the stain out  of a silk dress when a soft-boiled egg is dropped on it."]]]
