Not  lightly is the veil rent; yet I will rend it a little, and show you your  capital city.'    Conan did not see what she cast upon the fire, but the wolf whimpered in  his dreams, and a green smoke gathered and billowed up into the hut. And  as he watched, the walls and ceiling of the hut seemed to widen, to grow  remote and vanish, merging with infinite immensities; the smoke rolled  about him, blotting out everything. And in it forms moved and faded, and  stood out in startling clarity.    He stared at the familiar towers and streets of Tarantia, where a mob  seethed and screamed, and at the same time he was somehow able to see  the banners of Nemedia moving inexorably westward through the smoke and  flame of a pillaged land. In the great square of Tarantia the frantic  throng milled and yammered, screaming that the king was dead, that the  barons were girding themselves to divide the land between them, and that  the rule of a king, even of Valerius, was better than anarchy. Prospero,  shining in his armor, rode among them, trying to pacify them, bidding  them trust Count Trocero, urging them to man the wall and aid his  knights in defending the city. They turned on him, shrieking with fear  and unreasoning rage, howling that he was Trocero's butcher, a more evil  foe than Amalric himself. Offal and stones were hurled at his knights.    A slight blurring of the picture, that might have denoted a passing of  time, and then Conan saw Prospero and his knights filing out of the  gates and spurring southward. Behind him the city was in an uproar.    'Fools!' muttered Conan thickly. 'Fools! Why could they not trust  Prospero? Zelata, if you are making game of me, with some trickery----'    'This has passed,' answered Zelata imperturbably, though somberly. 'It  was the evening of the day that has passed when Prospero rode out of  Tarantia, with the hosts of Amalric almost within sight. From the walls  men saw the flame of their pillaging. So I read it in the smoke. At  sunset the Nemedians rode into Tarantia, unopposed. Look! Even now, in  the royal hall of Tarantia----'    Abruptly Conan was looking into the great coronation hall. Valerius  stood on the regal dais, clad in ermine robes, and Amalric, still in his  dusty, blood-stained armor, placed a rich and gleaming circlet on his  yellow locks--the crown of Aquilonia! The people cheered; long lines of  steel-clad Nemedian warriors looked grimly on, and nobles long in  disfavor at Conan's court strutted and swaggered with the emblem of  Valerius on their sleeves.    'Crom!' It was an explosive imprecation from Conan's lips as he started  up, his great fists clenched into hammers, his veins on his temples  knotting, his features convulsed. 'A Nemedian placing the crown of  Aquilonia on that renegade--in the royal hall of Tarantia!'    As if dispelled by his violence, the smoke faded, and he saw Zelata's  black eyes gleaming at him through the mist.    'You have seen--the people of your capital have forfeited the freedom  you won for them by sweat and blood; they have sold themselves to the  slavers and the butchers. They have shown that they do not trust their  destiny. Can you rely upon them for the winning back of your kingdom?'    'They thought I was dead,' he grunted, recovering some of his poise. 'I  have no son. Men can't be governed by a memory. What if the Nemedians  have taken Tarantia? There still remain the provinces, the barons, and  the people of the countrysides. Valerius has won an empty glory.'    'You are stubborn, as befits a fighter. I cannot show you the future, I  cannot show you all the past. Nay, _I_ show you nothing. I merely make  you see windows opened in the veil by powers unguessed. Would you look  into the past for a clue of the present?'    'Aye.' He seated himself abruptly.    Again the green smoke rose and billowed. Again images unfolded before  him, this time alien and seemingly irrelevant. He saw great towering  black walls, pedestals half hidden in the shadows upholding images of  hideous, half-bestial gods. Men moved in the shadows, dark, wiry men,  clad in red, silken loincloths. They were bearing a green jade  sarcophagus along a gigantic black corridor. But before he could tell  much about what he saw, the scene shifted. He saw a cavern, dim, shadowy  and haunted with a strange intangible horror. On an altar of black stone  stood a curious golden vessel, shaped like the shell of a scallop. Into  this cavern came some of the same dark, wiry men who had borne the  mummy-case. They seized the golden vessel, and then the shadows swirled  around them and what happened he could not say. But he saw a glimmer in  a whorl of darkness, like a ball of living fire. Then the smoke was only  smoke, drifting up from the fire of tamarisk chunks, thinning and  fading.    'But what does this portend?' he demanded, bewildered. 'What I saw in  Tarantia I can understand. But what means this glimpse of Zamorian  thieves sneaking through a subterranean temple of Set, in Stygia? And  that cavern--I've never seen or heard of anything like it, in all my  wanderings. If you can show me that much, these shreds of vision which  mean nothing, disjointed, why can you not show me all that is to occur?'    Zelata stirred the fire without replying.    'These things are governed by immutable laws,' she said at last. 'I can  not make you understand; I do not altogether understand myself, though I  have sought wisdom in the silences of the high places for more years  than I can remember. I cannot save you, though I would if I might. Man  must, at last, work out his own salvation. Yet perhaps wisdom may come  to me in dreams, and in the morn I may be able to give you the clue to  the enigma.'    'What enigma?' he demanded.    'The mystery that confronts you, whereby you have lost a kingdom,' she  answered. And then she spread a sheepskin upon the floor before the  hearth. 'Sleep,' she said briefly.    Without a word he stretched himself upon it, and sank into restless but  deep sleep through which phantoms moved silently and monstrous shapeless  shadows crept. Once, limned against a purple sunless horizon, he saw the  mighty walls and towers of a great city such as rose nowhere on the  waking earth he knew. Its colossal pylons and purple minarets lifted  toward the stars, and over it, floating like a giant mirage, hovered the  bearded countenance of the man Xaltotun.           *       *       *       *       *    Conan woke in the chill whiteness of early dawn, to see Zelata crouched  beside the tiny fire. He had not awakened once in the night, and the  sound of the great wolf leaving or entering should have roused him. Yet  the wolf was there, beside the hearth, with its shaggy coat wet with  dew, and with more than dew. Blood glistened wetly amid the thick fell,  and there was a cut upon his shoulder.    Zelata nodded, without looking around, as if reading the thoughts of her  royal guest.    'He has hunted before dawn, and red was the hunting. I think the man who  hunted a king will hunt no more, neither man nor beast.'    Conan stared at the great beast with strange fascination as he moved to  take the food Zelata offered him.    'When I come to my throne again I won't forget,' he said briefly.  'You've befriended me--by Crom, I can't remember when I've lain down and  slept at the mercy of man or woman as I did last night. But what of the  riddle you would read me this morn?'    A long silence ensued, in which the crackle of the tamarisks was loud on  the hearth.    'Find the heart of your kingdom,' she said at last. 'There lies your  defeat and your power. You fight more than mortal man. You will not  press the throne again unless you find the heart of your kingdom.'    'Do you mean the city of Tarantia?'    She shook her head. 'I am but an oracle, through whose lips the gods  speak. My lips are sealed by them lest I speak too much. You must find  the heart of your kingdom. I can say no more. My lips are opened and  sealed by the gods.'           *       *       *       *       *    Dawn was still white on the peaks when Conan rode westward. A glance  back showed him Zelata standing in the door of her hut, inscrutable as  ever, the great wolf beside her.    A gray sky arched overhead, and a moaning wind was chill with a promise  of winter. Brown leaves fluttered slowly down from the bare branches,  sifting upon his mailed shoulders.    All day he pushed through the hills, avoiding roads and villages. Toward  nightfall he began to drop down from the heights, tier by tier, and saw  the broad plains of Aquilonia spread out beneath him.    Villages and farms lay close to the foot of the hills on the western  side of the mountains, for, for half a century, most of the raiding  across the frontier had been done by the Aquilonians. But now only  embers and ashes showed where farm huts and villas had stood.    In the gathering darkness Conan rode slowly on. There was little fear of  discovery, which he dreaded from friend as well as from foe. The  Nemedians had remembered old scores on their westward drive, and  Valerius had made no attempt to restrain his allies. He did not count on  winning the love of the common people. A vast swath of desolation had  been cut through the country from the foothills westward. Conan cursed  as he rode over blackened expanses that had been rich fields, and saw  the gaunt gable-ends of burned houses jutting against the sky. He moved  through an empty and deserted land, like a ghost out of a forgotten and  outworn past.    The speed with which the army had traversed the land showed what little  resistance it had encountered. Yet had Conan been leading his  Aquilonians the invading army would have been forced to buy every foot  they gained with their blood. The bitter realization permeated his soul;  he was not the representative of a dynasty. He was only a lone  adventurer.

I  hope we don't have any more.\"    \"Do you think there is any likelihood of it?\" demanded Mr. Damon.  \"Bless my pocketbook! If I thought so I'd leave at once.\"    \"Where would you go?\" inquired Tom, looking out across the tumbling  ocean, which had hardly had a chance to subside from the gale, ere  it was again set in a turmoil by the earth-tremor.    \"That's so--there isn't a place to escape to,\" went on the eccentric  man, with something like a groan. \"We are in a bad place--do you  think there'll be more quakes, Tom?\"    \"It's hard to say. I don't know where we are, and this island may be  something like Japan, subject to quakes, or it may be that this one  is merely a spasmodic tremor. Perhaps the great storm which brought  us here was part of the disturbance of nature which ended up with  the earthquake. We may have no more.\"    \"And there may be one at any time,\" added Mr. Fenwick.    \"Yes,\" assented Tom.    \"Then let's get ready for it,\" proposed Mr. Damon. \"Let's take all  the precautions possible.\"    \"There aren't any to take,\" declared Tom. \"All we can do is to wait  until the shocks come--if any more do come, which I hope won't  happen, and then we must do the best we can.\"    \"Oh, dear me! Bless my fingernails!\" cried Mr. Damon, wringing his  hands. \"This is worse than falling in an airship! There you do have  SOME chance. Here you haven't any.\"    \"Oh, it may not be so bad,\" Tom cried to reassure him. \"This may  have been the first shock in a hundred years, and there may never be  another.\"    But, as he looked around on the island, he noted evidences that it  was of volcanic origin, and his heart misgave him, for he knew that  such islands, created suddenly by a submarine upheaval, might just  as suddenly be destroyed by an earthquake, or by sinking into the  ocean. It was not a pleasant thought--it was like living over a  mine, that might explode at any moment. But there was no help for  it.    Tom tried to assume a cheerfulness he did not feel. He realized  that, in spite of his youth, both Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick rather  depended on him, for Tom was a lad of no ordinary attainments, and  had a fund of scientific knowledge. He resolved to do his best to  avoid making his two companions worry.    \"Let's get it off our minds,\" suggested the lad, after a while. \"We  were going to get something to eat. Suppose we carry out that  program. My appetite wasn't spoiled by the shock.\"    \"I declare mine wasn't either,\" said Mr. Damon, \"but I can't forget  it easily. It's the first earthquake I was ever in.\"    He watched Tom as the latter advanced once more toward the wreck of  the airship, and noticed that the lad limped, for his right leg had  been cut when the WHIZZER had fallen to earth.    \"What's the matter, Tom; were you hurt in the quake?\" asked the  eccentric man.    \"No--no,\" Tom hastened to assure him. \"I just got a bump in the  fall--that's all. It isn't anything. If you and Mr. Fenwick want to  get out some food from the wrecked store room I'll see if I can haul  out the gasolene stove from the airship. Perhaps we can use it to  make some coffee.\"    By delving in about the wreck, Tom was able to get out the gasolene  stove. It was broken, but two of the five burners were in  commission, and could be used. Water, and gasolene for use in the  airship, was carried in steel tanks. Some of these had been split  open by the crash, but there was one cask of water left, and three  of gasolene, insuring plenty of the liquid fuel. As for the water,  Tom hoped to be able to find a spring on the island.    In the meanwhile, Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick had been investigating  the contents of the storeroom. There was a large supply of food,  much larger than would have been needed, even on a two weeks' trip  in the air, and the inventor of the WHIZZER hardly knew why he had  put so much aboard.    \"But if we have to stay here long, it may come in handy,\" observed  Tom, with a grim smile.    \"Why; do you think we WILL be here long?\" asked Mr. Damon.    The young inventor shrugged his shoulders.    \"There is no telling,\" he said. \"If a passing steamer happens to see  us, we may be taken off to-day or to-morrow. If not we may be here a  week, or--\" Tom did not finish. He stood in a listening attitude.    There was a rumbling sound, and the earth seemed again to tremble.  Then there came a great splash in the water at the foot of a tall,  rugged cliff about a quarter of a mile away. A great piece of the  precipice had fallen into the ocean.    \"I thought that was another earthquake coming,\" said Mr. Damon, with  an air of relief.    \"So did I,\" admitted Mr. Fenwick.    \"It was probably loosened by the shock, and so fell into the sea,\"  spoke Tom.    Their momentary fright over, the castaways proceeded to get their  breakfast. Tom soon had water boiling on the gasolene stove, for he  had rescued a tea-kettle and a coffee pot from the wreck of the  kitchen of the airship. Shortly afterward, the aroma of coffee  filled the air, and a little later there was mingled with it the  appetizing odor of sizzling bacon and eggs, for Mr. Fenwick, who was  very fond of the latter, had brought along a supply, carefully  packed in sawdust carriers, so that the shock had broken only a few  of them.    \"Well, I call this a fine breakfast,\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, munching  his bacon and eggs, and dipping into his coffee the hard pilot  biscuit, which they had instead of bread. \"We're mighty lucky to be  eating at all, I suppose.\"    \"Indeed we are,\" chimed in Mr. Fenwick.    \"I'm awfully sorry the airship is wrecked, though,\" spoke Tom. \"I  suppose it's my fault. I should have turned back before we got over  the ocean, and while the storm was not at its height. I saw that the  wind was freshening, but I never supposed it would grow to a gale so  suddenly. The poor old WHIZZER--there's not much left of her!\"    \"Now don't distress yourself in the least,\" insisted Mr. Fenwick.  \"I'm proud to have built a ship that could navigate at all. I see  where I made lots of mistakes, and as soon as I get back to  Philadelphia, I'm going to build a better one, if you'll help me,  Tom Swift.\"    \"I certainly will,\" promised the young inventor.    \"And I'll take a voyage with you!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Bless my  teaspoon, Tom, but will you kindly pass the bacon and eggs again!\"    There was a jolly laugh at the eccentric man, in which he himself  joined, and the little party felt better. They were seated on bits  of broken boxes taken from the wreck, forming a little circle about  the gasolene stove, which Tom had set up on the beach. The wind had  almost entirely died away, though the sea was still heaving in great  billows, and masses of surf.    They had no exact idea of the time, for all their watches had  stopped when the shock of the wreck came, but presently the sun  peeped out from the clouds, and, from knowing the time when they had  begun to fall, they judged it was about ten o'clock, and accordingly  set their timepieces.    \"Well,\" observed Tom, as he collected the dishes, which they had  also secured from the wreck, \"we must begin to think about a place  to spend the night. I think we can rig up a shelter from some of the  canvas of the wing-planes, and from what is left of the cabin. It  doesn't need to be very heavy, for from the warmth of the  atmosphere, I should say we were pretty well south.\"    It was quite warm, now that the storm was over, and, as they looked  at the vegetation of the island, they saw that it was almost wholly  tropical.    \"I shouldn't be surprised if we were on one of the smaller of the  West Indian islands,\" said Tom. \"We certainly came far enough,  flying a hundred miles or more an hour, to have reached them. But  this one doesn't appear to be inhabited.\"    \"We haven't been all over it yet,\" said Mr. Damon. \"We may find  cannibals on the other side.\"    \"Cannibals don't live in this part of the world,\" Tom assured him.  \"No, I think this island is practically unknown. The storm brought  us here, and it might have landed us in a worse place.\"    As he spoke he thought of the yacht RESOLUTE, and he wondered how  her passengers, including the parents of Mary Nestor, had fared  during the terrible blow.    \"I hope they weren't wrecked, as we were,\" mused Tom.    But there was little time for idle thoughts. If they were going to  build a shelter, they knew that they must speedily get at it.  Accordingly, with a feeling of thankfulness that their lives had  been spared, they set to work taking apart such of the wreck as  could the more easily be got at.    Boards, sticks, and planks were scattered about, and, with the  pieces of canvas from the wing-planes, and some spare material which  was carried on board, they soon had a fairly good shack, which would  be protection enough in that warm climate.    Next they got out the food and supplies, their spare clothing and  other belongings, few of which had been harmed in the fall from the  clouds. These things were piled under another rude shelter which  they constructed.    By this time it was three o'clock, and they ate again. Then they  prepared to spend the night in their hastily made camp. They  collected driftwood, with which to make a fire, and, after supper,  which was prepared on the gasolene stove, they sat about the  cheerful blaze, discussing their adventures.    \"To-morrow we will explore the island,\" said Tom, as he rolled  himself up in his blankets and turned over to sleep. The others  followed his example, for it was decided that no watch need be kept.  Thus passed several hours in comparative quiet.    It must have been about midnight that Tom was suddenly awakened by a  feeling as if someone was shaking him. He sat up quickly and called  out:    \"What's the matter?\"    \"Eh? What's that? Bless my soul! What's going on?\""]]]
