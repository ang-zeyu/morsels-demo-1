Then the writing-desk has been opened, as you  see, and the things on that table have been disturbed, the books shoved  about, and the papers moved. I think,\" going slowly toward the article,  \"that even the waste basket and the paper holder have been rummaged.\"    \"And do you miss anything here?\"    Mrs. Fry shook her head. \"I don't s'pose you've searched the  writing-desk yet?\" she ventured.    \"Not yet. And is that all you observe, Mrs. Fry? The bed, the lamp, the  desk, table, rack, and basket?\"    She went back to the table and pointed out with extended forefinger a  couple of burned matches, one upon a corner of the table, one upon the  floor almost beneath it.    \"They lit that lamp there!\" she said. \"And they brought their own  matches. I never use those 'parlour matches,' as they call 'em!\" She  bent her head to look closer at the polished surface of the table, and  then walked to the open window, where the shutter still swung in the  breeze. \"It has been awful dusty since yesterday, seems to me, for this  time of year. That boy's left his finger prints on this window, as  well's on the table there.\"    \"Don't touch them!\" It was Ferrars who spoke and so sharply that the  woman turned suddenly, but not soon enough to note the swift gesture  which directed his exclamation.    \"Of course we may rely upon you to keep the fact that my brother's rooms  have been entered in this manner from every one, for the present. It  may be very important that we do not let it be known beyond the four of  us. You have not seen or spoken with any one as yet, I think you said?\"    \"I haven't, and I won't. I'd do more than that for the sake of your  brother, Mr. Brierly, and you've only to tell me what I can do.\"    \"I intend to examine my brother's papers now, Mrs. Fry, before I leave  the house, and if we should need you again we will let you know.\" And  Mrs. Fry withdrew, puzzled and wondering much, but with her lips tightly  set over the secret she must and would help to preserve.    \"She'll keep silent, never fear,\" said the doctor as the door closed  behind her. \"And now, Brierly, I must remind you that you will need all  your strength, and that I don't like your colour this morning. If you  must investigate at once, get it over, for you, even more than Ferrars  or I, need your morning coffee and steak.\"    \"That is true,\" agreed Ferrars. \"Brierly, let me ask two questions, and  then oblige me by leaving certain marks, which I will point out to you,  just as you find them.\"    \"Your questions.\" Brierly had already seated himself before his  brother's desk.    \"I have an idea that this old oak writing-desk was not selected by our  friend, Mrs. Fry. Am I right?\"    \"It is my brother's desk; bought for its compact and portable  qualities.\"    \"Good! Now, where did your brother usually keep these keepsakes and bits  of foreign jewellery?\"    \"In one of these drawers. He kept them in a lacquered Japanese box.\"    \"Look for them. And, before you begin, oblige me by not touching that  letter file above the desk, nor the desk top just below it.\"    The letter file held only a few bits of paper, apparently notes and  memoranda; and upon the flat top of the desk was a bronze ink well, a  pen tray, a thin layer of dust and nothing more, except a tiny scrap of  paper hardly as big as a thumb nail, which lay directly beneath the  letter file. Brierly cast a wandering glance over the desk top and file  and set about his task.    There was quite a litter of papers, letters mostly, together with some  loose sheets that contained figures, dates, or something begun and cast  aside. Below some of the pigeon holes, letters lay as if hastily pulled  out, and from one of these little receptacles three or four envelopes  protruded, half out, half in--one, a square white envelope, projecting  beyond the others. These Brierly pulled forth, and turning them over in  his hand, scrutinised their superscriptions. Then slowly he took the  square white wrapper from among the others, and drew out the letter it  contained. As he began to scan the page of closely lined writing he  started, frowned, flushed hotly, and then with a look of fierce anger he  thrust the sheet back into its envelope, and turned toward the  detective.    \"Take that!\" he said with a curl of the lip. \"Unless I am greatly at  fault, it's a document in the case.\"    Ferrars took the letter from him, and asked, as he thrust it into the  pocket of his loose coat without so much as glancing at it, \"Do you mind  my running over the papers in this rack, Brierly? and looking into the  waste basket?\"    \"Do it, by all means,\" was the reply as Brierly pulled open the topmost  drawer; and then for some time there was silence, save for the rustle of  paper or the rasping of a hinge or turning knob.    When Brierly had finished his silent search of the two drawers, he  approached the detective with a small lacquered box in his hand.    \"The watch and the foreign jewels are gone,\" he said, holding out the  open box. \"And what do you think of this? Here are my mother's  keepsakes, wrapped in tissue paper, and labelled in my brother's hand,  'Mementos. From my mother.' The thief has spared these.\"    The detective, who was now seated beside the table, holding a folded  newspaper in his hand, took the box, looked at the tiny packet within,  nodded and passed it silently to the doctor.    \"And now,\" went on Robert Brierly, and there was a new ring of  resolution and menace in his voice. \"I turn the rooms and all they  contain over to you, Mr. Ferrars, and I await your opinion, when you  have read that letter in your pocket.\"    Ferrars drew forth the envelope and looked at it for the first time. It  was only a fragment, for a large corner of its face was missing, the  corner, in fact, which should have borne the postage stamp and the  postmaster's seal.    Without a word he held this side towards the two men, extending it first  to one, and then to the other.    \"You see!\" he said, and then to Brierly. \"Was it your brother's habit to  tear his letters open in such a reckless manner?\"    \"No. He was almost dainty in all his ways.\"    \"Is there another letter in that desk torn as this is?\"    Without a word Brierly took the letter and went back to the desk,  catching the letters from their pigeon holes by the handful.    \"I understand,\" he said, when he came back to them. \"No, there is not a  torn envelope there.\"    \"Then,\" said the detective, \"I think I may venture to give an opinion  even before I look at this letter.\"          CHAPTER X.    THIS HELPS ME.      The three men were now standing grouped about the table with its  scattered books and manuscripts, and Ferrars bent toward Robert Brierly,  putting a hand upon his shoulder.    \"Brierly,\" he said, \"sit down; this thing is using up your strength. I  will tell you what I think of all this, and then we must lock up this  place for a little while just as it is.\" And as Brierly obediently  dropped into the chair which the doctor quickly placed beside him, the  detective resumed.    \"Since yesterday half a dozen theories have suggested themselves to my  mind as possible explanations of this very daring murder, for I am now  fully convinced that it is nothing less; but I make it a rule never to  accept, much less announce, a belief, until I have established at least  a reasonable series of corroborative circumstances. This I have not  done entirely to my satisfaction, and so we will not go into the theory  of the case, but will see what facts we have established; and fact  number one, to my mind, is this: Your brother, Mr. Brierly, was most  certainly shot down with malice aforethought. He could not have shot  himself, and no one, in that open place, could have killed him by  accident. He may have been entirely unaware of it, but he had an enemy;  and the deed of yesterday was planned, I believe, long ago, and studied  carefully in every detail.\"    Robert Brierly flushed and paled. He opened his lips as if to speak, but  the detective's eyes were steadfastly turned away, and he resumed almost  at once.    \"I blame myself that I did not establish myself here last night, as I at  first thought of doing. But it is too late for useless regret. And now,  about this boy. Have you, either of you, a thought, a suspicion, as to  his identity?\"    The doctor shook his head.    \"You can't suspect one of the pupils, surely?\" hazarded Brierly.    \"Be sure that Mrs. Fry knows every pupil in Glenville, by sight, at  least; and this lad was a stranger, remember. It was a clever lad who  first secured the key to these rooms and then decoyed Mrs. Fry half way  across the town perhaps. How long must it have taken her, Doc, to go and  come, in haste?\"    \"Quite half an hour, I should think.\"    \"Well, we will assure ourselves of that later. Now we will suppose that  this strange boy was acquainted with these rooms to some extent, and  that he was, I fully believe. When Mrs. Fry is out of sight--and we  know, from her story, that he was careful that she should be before he  left his station upon the front porch--he slips indoors and evidently  knows where to look for a lamp, which he does not light until he is  inside this room.\" And Ferrars put a finger upon the match remarked upon  by Mrs. Fry. \"Now, as Mrs. Fry observed, there has been quite a film of  dust in the air for the past twenty-four hours, so that, in spite of the  good woman's tidy ways, it has accumulated upon this dark and shining  wood.\" And he put down his finger and called their attention to its  prints upon the table at his side.    \"When we entered this room,\" he went on, \"and I took it upon myself to  look at that window with the swinging blind, under pretence "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3533"],[0,"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town (#14)"],[1,"if one found time to  sit down for an hour or so to recuperate it was the most one could do.  After all, if a busy man spends the little bit of leisure that he gets  in advanced classical study, there is surely no harm in it. I suppose,  take it all in all, there wasn't a busier man than the Rural Dean among  the Anglican clergy of the diocese.    If the Dean ever did snatch a half-day from his incessant work, he spent  it in fishing. But not always that, for as likely as not, instead of  taking a real holiday he would put in the whole afternoon amusing  the children and the boys that he knew, by making kites and toys and  clockwork steamboats for them.    It was fortunate for the Dean that he had the strange interest and  aptitude for mechanical advices which he possessed, or otherwise this  kind of thing would have been too cruel an imposition. But the Rev.  Mr. Drone had a curious liking for machinery. I think I never heard him  preach a better sermon than the one on Aeroplanes (Lo, what now see you  on high Jeremiah Two).    So it was that he spent two whole days making a kite with Chinese wings  for Teddy Moore, the photographer's son, and closed down the infant  class for forty-eight hours so that Teddy Moore should not miss the  pleasure of flying it, or rather seeing it flown. It is foolish to trust  a Chinese kite to the hands of a young child.    In the same way the Dean made a mechanical top for little Marjorie  Trewlaney, the cripple, to see spun: it would have been unwise to allow  the afflicted girl to spin it. There was no end to the things that Mr.  Drone could make, and always for the children. Even when he was making  the sand-clock for poor little Willie Yodel (who died, you know) the  Dean went right on with it and gave it to another child with just the  same pleasure. Death, you know, to the clergy is a different thing from  what it is to us. The Dean and Mr. Gingham used often to speak of it as  they walked through the long grass of the new cemetery, the Necropolis.  And when your Sunday walk is to your wife's grave, as the Dean's was,  perhaps it seems different to anybody.    The Church of England Church, I said; stood close to the rectory, a  tall, sweeping church, and inside a great reach of polished cedar beams  that ran to the point of the roof. There used to stand on the same spot  the little stone church that all the grown-up people in Mariposa still  remember, a quaint little building in red and grey stone. About it was  the old cemetery, but that was all smoothed out later into the grass  plot round the new church, and the headstones laid out flat, and no new  graves have been put there for ever so long. But the Mariposa children  still walk round and read the headstones lying flat in the grass and  look for the old ones,--because some of them are ever so old--forty or  fifty years back.    Nor are you to think from all this that the Dean was not a man with  serious perplexities. You could easily convince yourself of the  contrary. For if you watched the Rev. Mr. Drone as he sat reading in the  Greek, you would notice that no very long period every passed without  his taking up a sheet or two of paper that lay between the leaves of the  Theocritus and that were covered close with figures.    And these the Dean would lay upon the rustic table, and he would add  them up forwards and backwards, going first up the column and then down  it to see that nothing had been left out, and then down it again to see  what it was that must have been left out.    Mathematics, you will understand, were not the Dean's forte. They never  were the forte of the men who had been trained at the little Anglican  college with the clipped hedges and the cricket ground, where Rupert  Drone had taken the gold medal in Greek fifty-two years ago. You will  see the medal at any time lying there in its open box on the rectory  table, in case of immediate need. Any of the Drone girls, Lilian, or  Jocelyn, or Theodora, would show it to you. But, as I say, mathematics  were not the rector's forte, and he blamed for it (in a Christian  spirit, you will understand) the memory of his mathematical professor,  and often he spoke with great bitterness. I have often heard him say  that in his opinion the colleges ought to dismiss, of course in  a Christian spirit, all the professors who are not, in the most  reverential sense of the term, fit for their jobs.    No doubt many of the clergy of the diocese had suffered more or less  just as the Dean had from lack of mathematical training. But the Dean  always felt that his own case was especially to be lamented. For you  see, if a man is trying to make a model aeroplane--for a poor family in  the lower part of the town--and he is brought to a stop by the need of  reckoning the coefficient of torsion of cast-iron rods, it shows plainly  enough that the colleges are not truly filling their divine mission.      But the figures that I speak of were not those of the model aeroplane.  These were far more serious. Night and day they had been with the rector  now for the best part of ten years, and they grew, if anything, more  intricate.    If, for example, you try to reckon the debt of a church--a large church  with a great sweep of polished cedar beams inside, for the special  glorification of the All Powerful, and with imported tiles on the roof  for the greater glory of Heaven and with stained-glass windows for the  exaltation of the All Seeing--if, I say, you try to reckon up the debt  on such a church and figure out its interest and its present worth, less  a fixed annual payment, it makes a pretty complicated sum. Then if you  try to add to this the annual cost of insurance, and deduct from it  three-quarters of a stipend, year by year, and then suddenly remember  that three-quarters is too much, because you have forgotten the  boarding-school fees of the littlest of the Drones (including French, as  an extra--she must have it, all the older girls did), you have got a sum  that pretty well defies ordinary arithmetic. The provoking part of it  was that the Dean knew perfectly well that with the help of logarithms  he could have done the thing in a moment. But at the Anglican college  they had stopped short at that very place in the book. They had simply  explained that Logos was a word and Arithmos a number, which at the  time, seemed amply sufficient.    So the Dean was perpetually taking out his sheets of figures, and adding  them upwards and downwards, and they never came the same. Very often  Mr. Gingham, who was a warden, would come and sit beside the rector and  ponder over the figures, and Mr. Drone would explain that with a book of  logarithms you could work it out in a moment. You would simply open the  book and run your finger up the columns (he illustrated exactly the way  in which the finger was moved), and there you were. Mr. Gingham said  that it was a caution, and that logarithms (I quote his exact phrase)  must be a terror.    Very often, too, Nivens, the lawyer, who was a sidesman, and Mullins,  the manager of the Exchange Bank, who was the chairman of the vestry,  would come and take a look, at the figures. But they never could make  much of them, because the stipend part was not a matter that one could  discuss.    Mullins would notice the item for a hundred dollars due on fire  insurance and would say; as a business man, that surely that couldn't  be fire insurance, and the Dean would say surely not, and change it:  and Mullins would say surely there couldn't be fifty dollars for taxes,  because there weren't any taxes, and the Dean would admit that of course  it couldn't be for the taxes. In fact, the truth is that the Dean's  figures were badly mixed, and the fault lay indubitably with the  mathematical professor of two generations back.    It was always Mullins's intention some day to look into the finances of  the church, the more so as his father had been with Dean Drone at the  little Anglican college with the cricket ground. But he was a busy man.  As he explained to the rector himself, the banking business nowadays  is getting to be such that a banker can hardly call even his Sunday  mornings his own. Certainly Henry Mullins could not. They belonged  largely to Smith's Hotel, and during the fishing season they belonged  away down the lake, so far away that practically no one, unless it was  George Duff of the Commercial Bank, could see them.    But to think that all this trouble had come through the building of the  new church.    That was the bitterness of it.    For the twenty-five years that Rural Dean Drone had preached in the  little stone church, it had been his one aim, as he often put it in his  sermons, to rear a larger Ark in Gideon. His one hope had been to set up  a greater Evidence, or, very simply stated, to kindle a Brighter Beacon.    After twenty-five years of waiting, he had been able at last to kindle  it. Everybody in Mariposa remembers the building of the church. First  of all they had demolished the little stone church to make way for the  newer Evidence. It seemed almost a sacrilege, as the Dean himself said,  to lay hands on it. Indeed it was at first proposed to take the stone of  it and build it into a Sunday School, as a lesser testimony. Then,  when that provided impracticable, it was suggested that the stone be  reverently fashioned into a wall that should stand as a token. And when  even that could not be managed, the stone of the little church was  laid reverently into a stone pile; afterwards it was devoutly sold to a  building contractor, and, like so much else in life, was forgotten.    But the building of the church, no one, I think, will forget. The  Dean threw himself into the work. With his coat off and his white  shirt-sleeves conspicuous among the gang that were working at the  foundations, he set his hand to the shovel, himself guided the  road-scraper, urging on the horses; cheering and encouraging"]]]
