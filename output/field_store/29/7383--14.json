That, therefore, which when absent, it is so  indispensable, but so difficult, to create, how worse than absurd is it  to forego, when spontaneously offering itself! If there are any persons  who contest a received opinion, or who will do so if law or opinion will  let them, let us thank them for it, open our minds to listen to them,  and rejoice that there is some one to do for us what we otherwise ought,  if we have any regard for either the certainty or the vitality of our  convictions, to do with much greater labour for ourselves.      It still remains to speak of one of the principal causes which make  diversity of opinion advantageous, and will continue to do so until  mankind shall have entered a stage of intellectual advancement which at  present seems at an incalculable distance. We have hitherto considered  only two possibilities: that the received opinion may be false, and some  other opinion, consequently, true; or that, the received opinion being  true, a conflict with the opposite error is essential to a clear  apprehension and deep feeling of its truth. But there is a commoner  case than either of these; when the conflicting doctrines, instead of  being one true and the other false, share the truth between them; and  the nonconforming opinion is needed to supply the remainder of the  truth, of which the received doctrine embodies only a part. Popular  opinions, on subjects not palpable to sense, are often true, but seldom  or never the whole truth. They are a part of the truth; sometimes a  greater, sometimes a smaller part, but exaggerated, distorted, and  disjoined from the truths by which they ought to be accompanied and  limited. Heretical opinions, on the other hand, are generally some of  these suppressed and neglected truths, bursting the bonds which kept  them down, and either seeking reconciliation with the truth contained in  the common opinion, or fronting it as enemies, and setting themselves  up, with similar exclusiveness, as the whole truth. The latter case is  hitherto the most frequent, as, in the human mind, one-sidedness has  always been the rule, and many-sidedness the exception. Hence, even in  revolutions of opinion, one part of the truth usually sets while another  rises. Even progress, which ought to superadd, for the most part only  substitutes one partial and incomplete truth for another; improvement  consisting chiefly in this, that the new fragment of truth is more  wanted, more adapted to the needs of the time, than that which it  displaces. Such being the partial character of prevailing opinions, even  when resting on a true foundation; every opinion which embodies somewhat  of the portion of truth which the common opinion omits, ought to be  considered precious, with whatever amount of error and confusion that  truth may be blended. No sober judge of human affairs will feel bound to  be indignant because those who force on our notice truths which we  should otherwise have overlooked, overlook some of those which we see.  Rather, he will think that so long as popular truth is one-sided, it is  more desirable than otherwise that unpopular truth should have one-sided  asserters too; such being usually the most energetic, and the most  likely to compel reluctant attention to the fragment of wisdom which  they proclaim as if it were the whole.    Thus, in the eighteenth century, when nearly all the instructed, and all  those of the uninstructed who were led by them, were lost in admiration  of what is called civilisation, and of the marvels of modern science,  literature, and philosophy, and while greatly overrating the amount of  unlikeness between the men of modern and those of ancient times,  indulged the belief that the whole of the difference was in their own  favour; with what a salutary shock did the paradoxes of Rousseau explode  like bombshells in the midst, dislocating the compact mass of one-sided  opinion, and forcing its elements to recombine in a better form and with  additional ingredients. Not that the current opinions were on the whole  farther from the truth than Rousseau's were; on the contrary, they were  nearer to it; they contained more of positive truth, and very much less  of error. Nevertheless there lay in Rousseau's doctrine, and has floated  down the stream of opinion along with it, a considerable amount of  exactly those truths which the popular opinion wanted; and these are the  deposit which was left behind when the flood subsided. The superior  worth of simplicity of life, the enervating and demoralising effect of  the trammels and hypocrisies of artificial society, are ideas which have  never been entirely absent from cultivated minds since Rousseau wrote;  and they will in time produce their due effect, though at present  needing to be asserted as much as ever, and to be asserted by deeds, for  words, on this subject, have nearly exhausted their power.    In politics, again, it is almost a commonplace, that a party of order  or stability, and a party of progress or reform, are both necessary  elements of a healthy state of political life; until the one or the  other shall have so enlarged its mental grasp as to be a party equally  of order and of progress, knowing and distinguishing what is fit to be  preserved from what ought to be swept away. Each of these modes of  thinking derives its utility from the deficiencies of the other; but it  is in a great measure the opposition of the other that keeps each within  the limits of reason and sanity. Unless opinions favourable to democracy  and to aristocracy, to property and to equality, to co-operation and to  competition, to luxury and to abstinence, to sociality and  individuality, to liberty and discipline, and all the other standing  antagonisms of practical life, are expressed with equal freedom, and  enforced and defended with equal talent and energy, there is no chance  of both elements obtaining their due; one scale is sure to go up and the  other down. Truth, in the great practical concerns of life, is so much a  question of the reconciling and combining of opposites, that very few  have minds sufficiently capacious and impartial to make the adjustment  with an approach to correctness, and it has to be made by the rough  process of a struggle between combatants fighting under hostile  banners. On any of the great open questions just enumerated, if either  of the two opinions has a better claim than the other, not merely to be  tolerated, but to be encouraged and countenanced, it is the one which  happens at the particular time and place to be in a minority. That is  the opinion which, for the time being, represents the neglected  interests, the side of human well-being which is in danger of obtaining  less than its share. I am aware that there is not, in this country, any  intolerance of differences of opinion on most of these topics. They are  adduced to show, by admitted and multiplied examples, the universality  of the fact, that only through diversity of opinion is there, in the  existing state of human intellect, a chance of fair-play to all sides of  the truth. When there are persons to be found, who form an exception to  the apparent unanimity of the world on any subject, even if the world is  in the right, it is always probable that dissentients have something  worth hearing to say for themselves, and that truth would lose something  by their silence.    It may be objected, \"But _some_ received principles, especially on the  highest and most vital subjects, are more than half-truths. The  Christian morality, for instance, is the whole truth on that subject,  and if any one teaches a morality which varies from it, he is wholly in  error.\" As this is of all cases the most important in practice, none can  be fitter to test the general maxim. But before pronouncing what  Christian morality is or is not, it would be desirable to decide what is  meant by Christian morality. If it means the morality of the New  Testament, I wonder that any one who derives his knowledge of this from  the book itself, can suppose that it was announced, or intended, as a  complete doctrine of morals. The Gospel always refers to a pre-existing  morality, and confines its precepts to the particulars in which that  morality was to be corrected, or superseded by a wider and higher;  expressing itself, moreover, in terms most general, often impossible to  be interpreted literally, and possessing rather the impressiveness of  poetry or eloquence than the precision of legislation. To extract from  it a body of ethical doctrine, has ever been possible without eking it  out from the Old Testament, that is, from a system elaborate indeed, but  in many respects barbarous, and intended only for a barbarous people.  St. Paul, a declared enemy to this Judaical mode of interpreting the  doctrine and filling up the scheme of his Master, equally assumes a  pre-existing morality, namely, that of the Greeks and Romans; and his  advice to Christians is in a great measure a system of accommodation to  that; even to the extent of giving an apparent sanction to slavery. What  is called Christian, but should rather be termed theological, morality,  was not the work of Christ or the Apostles, but is of much later origin,  having been gradually built up by the Catholic church of the first five  centuries, and though not implicitly adopted by moderns and Protestants,  has been much less modified by them than might have been expected. For  the most part, indeed, they have contented themselves with cutting off  the additions which had been made to it in the middle ages, each sect  supplying the place by fresh additions, adapted to its own character and  tendencies. That mankind owe a great debt to this morality, and to its  early teachers, I should be the last person to deny;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34903"],[0,"Dress Design: An Account of Costume for Artists & Dressmakers (#14)"],[1,"use.

GEORGE II. MALE.    Wigs with double points at the back, short curled or of long pigtailed  shapes, some with side curls, others curled all round the front, were  worn. Large bows and bags, or no bows, finished the back hair, and the  bow to the front of the neck was in use from the early part of this  reign. Long coats, as in the last reign, and short coats with stiffened  skirts were used; many with braided seams and fronts, also a braided  opening at the back. Large round cuffs and big square ones, caped coats,  and coats with turn-down collars were all in the mode, and the  \"maccaroni\" fashions started about 1760, with absurdities in small hats,  clubbed wigs, and very short coats. High sticks and crook sticks, canes  and swords continued in use.

Stockings were often still worn outside the knee. Shoes reached an  extreme high square front at the latter date, and gloves with curved or  square cuffs are to be noted.    [Illustration: FIG. 95.--First Half Eighteenth Century.]      EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. GEORGE III TO 1800. FEMALE.    This long reign, like that of Queen Victoria, embraces several changes  of style. Up till about 1785 white powder was still used for the hair,  reaching its fullest extravagance in the middle of the seventies, set  with pearls, bandeaus, caps, lace, flowers and feathers, and about 1776  the top was widened considerably. The front hair, gathered from the  forehead, was pressed in a forward curve over a high pad, with one to  three curls at the sides and one at the shoulders, the back hair being  arranged in a loose loop, curled on the top and set with a large bow at  the back; a small round hat with very small low crown (usually decorated  with flowers and silks gathered into puffs, or ribbons and small  feathers) was tilted right on the front. About 1780 large mob caps with  a big bow on the front came in, and were generally worn together with  the tall-crowned hat or the large-brimmed hat in favour at this time. A  cape with smallish hood worn in the earlier reigns was supplanted about  1777 by the calash, a huge hood set out with whalebone which came  to cover the full head-dresses. The heavier caped or hooded cloak,  sometimes with side opening for the arms, and usually trimmed with fur,  still remained in use to 1800.    [Illustration: FIG. 96.--Costume notes, 1770-1780.]    [Illustration: Plate XXIII.--        (_a_) Muslin Dress with Tinsel Design. 1798-1810.      (_b_) Silk Dress. Period George IV.

Period 1780-1795.]    [Illustration: FIG. 98.--Hats and Caps during period 1780-1795.]    [Illustration: FIG. 99.--Hats during period 1790-1800.]    The bodice retained the same shape as in the former reign, rather longer  in the points back and front, with a large fan finish to the sleeve,  double or single; this became supplanted by a much-gathered elbow-piece,  sometimes eight inches deep, gathered in four rows. Small drawn gathers  started round the waist of the skirt, for the side panniers and hoops  were being less worn, except for the \"smart gown,\" but bunching,  reefing, and looping took their place in effect, and quilted petticoats  remained while this character of dress lasted. The later sack-back dress  was sewn tighter to the body, and usually started in a narrower set at  the back, while the full pleat from the shoulder down the front went  out, and the neck was more displayed by lower bodice fronts, which  continued to be set with bows, jewels, lace, or embroidery. Sack-back  jackets were often worn in the seventies; when the sack began to  disappear, it took the form of overlapped seams on the bodice. The  decorated side pockets are noted in prints showing tuck-up dresses to  1775. The jacket bodice of the same form described in the preceding  reign was perhaps more in evidence till 1780, not so long in the skirt  as in the earlier reigns, but after this date it took a longer skirt,  which was often pleated at the back, with a very low neck and short  waist.    [Illustration: FIG. 100.--Period 1780-1795.]    About 1780 we find a change of style appearing in a shorter waist, with  less pointed setting, having often a rounded point or square tabs, and  even a shaped finish to the corset front, which was sometimes used like  a waistcoat effect under the cut-away dresses seen after 1770 (see Fig.  99, p. 221). A general tendency to imitate male attire is apparent, and  the front of the bodice was set with lapels and straps buttoned across  (though I have noted this latter character in the early part of this  century), and long coats with this character were much worn, with two or  three capes. The sleeves are sometimes set over a tight undersleeve, in  fact the longer sleeve to the wrist became fashionable. With this change  a short gathered skirt is seen on some bodices, and the full gathered  skirt was bunched out at the back on a bustle, of which I give an  illustration (p. 212), the low neck being filled with a large lawn  fichu; a wide belt was generally worn, or a wide sash and bow at the  back or side is seen with the lighter dresses, these being simple in  style, just gathered at the waist, with short full sleeves set with a  frill, and another frill was also arranged round the neck.    [Illustration: FIG. 101.]    About 1790 the mode again began to change to a classic style, still  higher in the waist, with a short tight sleeve, at times puffed in the  upper part, or an outer and under sleeve, as per illustration A, Plate  XXII (see p. 215). The fronts of this type of bodice were mostly  buttoned or pinned up to the shoulders over a tight underfront, the  skirt opening about 18 inches at the sides, thus saving a fastening at  the back. I have illustrated some very interestingly cut jackets of this  period from my collection, as A, Plate XXIV (see p. 231); the sleeves  were very long and were ruckled on the arm, as likewise were the long  gloves or mittens of this time. A long scarf or drape was carried with  this style, and a round helmet-like hat in straw or a turban was  adopted. High sticks were still carried by ladies till the nineties,  and umbrellas or parasols; the former came into vogue about 1770, the  latter about six years later. Muffs of beautifully embroidered silk and  satin were set with purfled trimmings, gold and silver lace, or bows and  ribbons; otherwise they were of furs or feathers. They remained rather  small up to 1780, when a very large shape set in, which continued till  the end of the reign; the quantity of beautiful fans of this century  must be so well known as to need no description. The highest artistry  was concentrated on them.    [Illustration: FIG. 102.--Period 1790-1800.]    [Illustration: FIG. 103.--Costume notes, 1790-1800.]    [Illustration: FIG. 104.--Lounge Caps worn during removal of Wig.]    Shoes at the beginning of this reign were set on very high spindle  heels; the toe-front became rounded, the instep-front a pointed shape,  and wide latchets were buckled till about 1785, but fashion discarded  them earlier; for about 1780 the shoes became very small at the heel,  and pointed again at the toe. When the latchets went out, the pointed  instep remained for a time, but a low round front appeared, and the heel  practically vanished just before 1800. These later shoes were decorated  on the front by needlework or incised leather openwork underlaid with  another colour. The soles at this time were extremely quaint in  shape, and the shoes were tied sandal fashion up the ankle.    [Illustration: Plate XXIV.--        (_a_) Outdoor Silk Jacket. 1798-1808.

The wigs, which were rather high in the front of the crown in the  earlier part, began to cast off the most eccentric forms, and became  just curled, rather full at the sides, and tied with a bow at the back:  dull pink powder became a favoured hue from about 1780; most people  began to return to their own hair, and one might see many without long  hair in the nineties. The last type of dressing the hair in imitation of  the wig form was a long, tightly braided pigtail at the back, with one  or even two side curls over the ear, and side whiskers were allowed to  fill up to them; thus when the short hair set the fashion, side whiskers  came in.    Hats were still worn of the three-cornered shape, but the favourites  became a front cockade hat and a hat with a rounded crown and rather  wide brim, sometimes turned up on one side; a short type of top-hat was  also often seen, and later became the fashion. The same lawn and lace  cravat developed into more of a plain white stock, with a frilled  shirt-front.    The coat was worn much tighter in the arms and was smartly cut, with the  fronts running away into a narrow tailed skirt. The pockets often began  to take a"]]]
