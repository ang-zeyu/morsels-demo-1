The rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last    decade has resulted in a substantial expansion of other activities.    Construction has boomed, with hotel capacity five times the 1985    level. In addition, the reopening of the country's oil refinery in    1993, a major source of employment and foreign exchange earnings,    has further spurred growth. Aruba's small labor force and less than    1% unemployment rate have led to a large number of unfilled job    vacancies despite sharp rises in wage rates in recent years.

An estimated 10    million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free    status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative    advantage has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France    and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of    goods and lower tariffs. The banking sector, with its \"tax haven\"    status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural    production is limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food    has to be imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep    raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and    furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is    treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs)    and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.
