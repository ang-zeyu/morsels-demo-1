S. and I paced slowly back along  the narrow street that contained the Professor's dwelling-place. My  companion was strangely silent. More than once I felt his eyes upon me  in an uncomfortable stare, yet he said nothing. Nothing, that is, until  I had opened the conversation with some casual remark about the lunacy  of the man we had just left.    \"You are wrong in mocking him, Dale,\" M. S. replied bitterly. \"Daimler  is a man of science. He is no child, experimenting with a toy; he is a  grown man who has the courage to believe in his powers. One of these  days....\"    He had intended to say that some day I should respect the Professor's  efforts. One of these days! The interval of time was far shorter than  anything so indefinite. The first event, with its succeeding series of  horrors, came within the next three minutes.           *       *       *       *       *    We had reached a more deserted section of the square, a black,  uninhabited street extending like a shadowed band of darkness between  gaunt, high walls. I had noticed for some time that the stone structure  beside us seemed to be unbroken by door or window--that it appeared to  be a single gigantic building, black and forbidding. I mentioned the  fact to M. S.    \"The warehouse,\" he said simply. \"A lonely, God-forsaken place. We shall  probably see the flicker of the watchman's light in one of the upper  chinks.\"    At his words, I glanced up. True enough, the higher part of the grim  structure was punctured by narrow, barred openings. Safety vaults,  probably. But the light, unless its tiny gleam was somewhere in the  inner recesses of the warehouse, was dead. The great building was like  an immense burial vault, a tomb--silent and lifeless.    We had reached the most forbidding section of the narrow street, where a  single arch-lamp overhead cast a halo of ghastly yellow light over the  pavement. At the very rim of the circle of illumination, where the  shadows were deeper and more silent, I could make out the black  mouldings of a heavy iron grating. The bars of metal were designed, I  believe, to seal the side entrance of the great warehouse from night  marauders. It was bolted in place and secured with a set of immense  chains, immovable.    This much I saw as my intent gaze swept the wall before me. This huge  tomb of silence held for me a peculiar fascination, and as I paced along  beside my gloomy companion, I stared directly ahead of me into the  darkness of the street. I wish to God my eyes had been closed or  blinded!           *       *       *       *       *    He was hanging on the grating. Hanging there, with white, twisted hands  clutching the rigid bars of iron, straining to force them apart. His  whole distorted body was forced against the barrier, like the form of a  madman struggling to escape from his cage. His face--the image of it  still haunts me whenever I see iron bars in the darkness of a  passage--was the face of a man who has died from utter, stark horror. It  was frozen in a silent shriek of agony, staring out at me with fiendish  maliciousness. Lips twisted apart. White teeth gleaming in the light.  Bloody eyes, with a horrible glare of colorless pigment. And--_dead_.    I believe M. S. saw him at the very instant I recoiled. I felt a sudden  grip on my arm; and then, as an exclamation came harshly from my  companion's lips, I was pulled forward roughly. I found myself staring  straight into the dead eyes of that fearful thing before me, found  myself standing rigid, motionless, before the corpse that hung within  reach of my arm.    And then, through that overwhelming sense of the horrible, came the  quiet voice of my comrade--the voice of a man who looks upon death as  nothing more than an opportunity for research.    \"The fellow has been frightened to death, Dale. Frightened most  horribly. Note the expression of his mouth, the evident struggle to  force these bars apart and escape. Something has driven fear to his  soul, killed him.\"           *       *       *       *       *    I remember the words vaguely. When M. S. had finished speaking, I did  not reply. Not until he had stepped forward and bent over the distorted  face of the thing before me, did I attempt to speak. When I did, my  thoughts were a jargon.    \"What, in God's name,\" I cried, \"could have brought such horror to a  strong man? What--\"    \"Loneliness, perhaps,\" suggested M. S. with a smile. \"The fellow is  evidently the watchman. He is alone, in a huge, deserted pit of  darkness, for hours at a time. His light is merely a ghostly ray of  illumination, hardly enough to do more than increase the darkness. I  have heard of such cases before.\"    He shrugged his shoulders. Even as he spoke, I sensed the evasion in his  words. When I replied, he hardly heard my answer, for he had suddenly  stepped forward, where he could look directly into those fear twisted  eyes.    \"Dale,\" he said at length, turning slowly to face me, \"you ask for an  explanation of this horror? There _is_ an explanation. It is written  with an almost fearful clearness on this fellow's mind. Yet if I tell  you, you will return to your old skepticism--your damnable habit of  disbelief!\"    I looked at him quietly. I had heard M. S. claim, at other times, that  he could read the thoughts of a dead man by the mental image that lay on  that man's brain. I had laughed at him. Evidently, in the present  moment, he recalled those laughs. Nevertheless, he faced me seriously.    \"I can see two things, Dale,\" he said deliberately. \"One of them is a  dark, narrow room--a room piled with indistinct boxes and crates, and  with an open door bearing the black number 4167. And in that open  doorway, coming forward with slow steps--alive, with arms extended and a  frightful face of passion--is a decayed human form. A corpse, Dale. A  man who has been dead for many days, and is now--_alive_!\"           *       *       *       *       *    M. S. turned slowly and pointed with upraised hand to the corpse on the  grating.    \"That is why,\" he said simply, \"this fellow died from horror.\"    His words died into emptiness. For a moment I stared at him. Then, in  spite of our surroundings, in spite of the late hour, the loneliness of  the street, the awful thing beside us, I laughed.    He turned upon me with a snarl. For the first time in my life I saw M.  S. convulsed with rage. His old, lined face had suddenly become savage  with intensity.    \"You laugh at me, Dale,\" he thundered. \"By God, you make a mockery out  of a science that I have spent more than my life in studying! You call  yourself a medical man--and you are not fit to carry the name! I will  wager you, man, that your laughter is not backed by courage!\"    I fell away from him. Had I stood within reach, I am sure he would have  struck me. Struck me! And I have been nearer to M. S. for the past ten  years than any man in London. And as I retreated from his temper, he  reached forward to seize my arm. I could not help but feel impressed at  his grim intentness.    \"Look here, Dale,\" he said bitterly, \"I will wager you a hundred pounds  that you will not spend the remainder of this night in the warehouse  above you! I will wager a hundred pounds against your own courage that  you will not back your laughter by going through what this fellow has  gone through. That you will not prowl through the corridors of this  great structure until you have found room 4167--_and remain in that room  until dawn_!\"           *       *       *       *       *    There was no choice. I glanced at the dead man, at the face of fear and  the clutching, twisted hands, and a cold dread filled me. But to refuse  my friend's wager would have been to brand myself an empty coward. I had  mocked him. Now, whatever the cost, I must stand ready to pay for that  mockery.    \"Room 4167?\" I replied quietly, in a voice which I made every effort to  control, lest he should discover the tremor in it. \"Very well, I will do  it!\"    It was nearly midnight when I found myself alone, climbing a musty,  winding ramp between the first and second floors of the deserted  building. Not a sound, except the sharp intake of my breath and the  dismal creak of the wooden stairs, echoed through that tomb of death.  There was no light, not even the usual dim glow that is left to  illuminate an unused corridor. Moreover, I had brought no means of light  with me--nothing but a half empty box of safety matches which, by some  unholy premonition, I had forced myself to save for some future moment.  The stairs were black and difficult, and I mounted them slowly, groping  with both hands along the rough wall.    I had left M. S. some few moments before. In his usual decisive manner  he had helped me to climb the iron grating and lower myself to the  sealed alley-way on the farther side. Then, leaving him without a word,  for I was bitter against the triumphant tone of his parting words, I  proceeded into the darkness, fumbling forward until I had discovered the  open door in the lower part of the warehouse.    And then the ramp, winding crazily upward--upward--upward, seemingly  without end. I was seeking blindly for that particular room which was to  be my destination. Room 4167, with its high number, could hardly be on  the lower floors, and so I had stumbled upward....           *       *       *       *       *    It was at the entrance of the second floor corridor that I struck the  first of my desultory supply of matches, and by its light discovered a  placard nailed to the wall. The thing was yellow with age and hardly  legible. In the drab light of the match I had difficulty in reading  it--but, as far as I can remember, the notice went something like this:        WAREHOUSE RULES        1. No light shall be permitted in any room or corridor, as a      prevention against fire.    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2865"],[0,"Otto of the Silver Hand (#14)"],[1,"  of the trees below, they caught the glint of armor of those who  followed--not more than a mile away. The next moment they swept over the  crest, and there, below them, lay the broad shining river, and nearer a  tributary stream spanned by a rude, narrow, three-arched, stone bridge  where the road crossed the deep, slow-moving water.    Down the slope plodded the weary horses, and so to the bridge-head.    \"Halt,\" cried the baron suddenly, and drew rein.    The others stood bewildered. What did he mean to do? He turned to Hans  and his blue eyes shone like steel.    \"Hans,\" said he, in his deep voice, \"thou hast served me long and truly;  wilt thou for this one last time do my bidding?\"    \"Aye,\" said Hans, briefly.    \"Swear it,\" said the Baron.    \"I swear it,\" said Hans, and he drew the sign of the cross upon his  heart.    \"That is good,\" said the Baron, grimly. \"Then take thou this child,  and with the others ride with all the speed that thou canst to St.  Michaelsburg. Give the child into the charge of the Abbot Otto. Tell  him how that I have sworn fealty to the Emperor, and what I have gained  thereby--my castle burnt, my people slain, and this poor, simple child,  my only son, mutilated by my enemy.    \"And thou, my Lord Baron?\" said Hans.    \"I will stay here,\" said the Baron, quietly, \"and keep back those who  follow as long as God will give me grace so to do.\"    A murmur of remonstrance rose among the faithful few who were with  him, two of whom were near of kin. But Conrad of Drachenhausen turned  fiercely upon them.    \"How now,\" said he, \"have I fallen so low in my troubles that even ye  dare to raise your voices against me? By the good Heaven, I will begin  my work here by slaying the first man who dares to raise word against  my bidding.\" Then he turned from them. \"Here, Hans,\" said he, \"take the  boy; and remember, knave, what thou hast sworn.\"    He pressed Otto close to his breast in one last embrace. \"My little  child,\" he murmured, \"try not to hate thy father when thou thinkest of  him hereafter, even though he be hard and bloody as thou knowest.\"    But with his suffering and weakness, little Otto knew nothing of what  was passing; it was only as in a faint flickering dream that he lived in  what was done around him.    \"Farewell, Otto,\" said the Baron, but Otto's lips only moved faintly in  answer. His father kissed him upon either cheek. \"Come, Hans,\" said  he, hastily, \"take him hence;\" and he loosed Otto's arms from about his  neck.    Hans took Otto upon the saddle in front of him.    \"Oh! my dear Lord Baron,\" said he, and then stopped with a gulp, and  turned his grotesquely twitching face aside.    \"Go,\" said the Baron, harshly, \"there is no time to lose in woman's  tears.\"    \"Farewell, Conrad! farewell, Conrad!\" said his two kinsmen, and coming  forward they kissed him upon the cheek then they turned and rode away  after Hans, and Baron Conrad was left alone to face his mortal foe.          XIII. How Baron Conrad Held the Bridge.    As the last of his followers swept around the curving road and was lost  to sight, Baron Conrad gave himself a shake, as though to drive away the  thoughts that lay upon him. Then he rode slowly forward to the middle of  the bridge, where he wheeled his horse so as to face his coming enemies.  He lowered the vizor of his helmet and bolted it to its place, and then  saw that sword and dagger were loose in the scabbard and easy to draw  when the need for drawing should arise.      Down the steep path from the hill above swept the pursuing horsemen.  Down the steep path to the bridge-head and there drew rein; for in the  middle of the narrow way sat the motionless, steel-clad figure upon the  great war-horse, with wide, red, panting nostrils, and body streaked  with sweat and flecked with patches of foam.    One side of the roadway of the bridge was guarded by a low stone wall;  the other side was naked and open and bare to the deep, slow-moving  water beneath. It was a dangerous place to attack a desperate man clad  in armor of proof.    \"Forward!\" cried Baron Henry, but not a soul stirred in answer, and  still the iron-clad figure sat motionless and erect upon the panting  horse.    \"How,\" cried the Baron Henry, \"are ye afraid of one man? Then follow  me!\" and he spurred forward to the bridge-head. But still no one moved  in answer, and the Lord of Trutz-Drachen reined back his horse again.  He wheeled his horse and glared round upon the stolid faces of his  followers, until his eyes seemed fairly to blaze with passion beneath  the bars of his vizor.    Baron Conrad gave a roar of laughter. \"How now,\" he cried; \"are ye all  afraid of one man? Is there none among ye that dares come forward and  meet me? I know thee, Baron Henry thou art not afraid to cut off the  hand of a little child. Hast thou not now the courage to face the  father?\"    Baron Henry gnashed his teeth with rage as he glared around upon the  faces of his men-at-arms. Suddenly his eye lit upon one of them. \"Ha!  Carl Spigler,\" he cried, \"thou hast thy cross-bow with thee;--shoot me  down yonder dog! Nay,\" he said, \"thou canst do him no harm under his  armor; shoot the horse upon which he sits.\"    Baron Conrad heard the speech. \"Oh! thou coward villain!\" he cried,  \"stay; do not shoot the good horse. I will dismount and fight ye upon  foot.\" Thereupon, armed as he was, he leaped clashing from his horse and  turning the animal's head, gave it a slap upon the flank. The good horse  first trotted and then walked to the further end of the bridge, where it  stopped and began cropping at the grass that grew beside the road.    \"Now then!\" cried Baron Henry, fiercely, \"now then, ye cannot fear him,  villains! Down with him! forward!\"    Slowly the troopers spurred their horses forward upon the bridge and  toward that one figure that, grasping tightly the great two-handed  sword, stood there alone guarding the passage.    Then Baron Conrad whirled the great blade above his head, until it  caught the sunlight and flashed again. He did not wait for the attack,  but when the first of the advancing horsemen had come within a few feet  of him, he leaped with a shout upon them. The fellow thrust at him with  his lance, and the Baron went staggering a few feet back, but instantly  he recovered himself and again leaped forward. The great sword flashed  in the air, whistling; it fell, and the nearest man dropped his lance,  clattering, and with a loud, inarticulate cry, grasped the mane of his  horse with both hands. Again the blade whistled in the air, and this  time it was stained with red. Again it fell, and with another shrill cry  the man toppled headlong beneath the horse's feet. The next instant they  were upon him, each striving to strike at the one figure, to ride him  down, or to thrust him down with their lances. There was no room now to  swing the long blade, but holding the hilt in both hands, Baron Conrad  thrust with it as though it were a lance, stabbing at horse or man, it  mattered not. Crowded upon the narrow roadway of the bridge, those who  attacked had not only to guard themselves against the dreadful strokes  of that terrible sword, but to keep their wounded horses (rearing and  mad with fright) from toppling bodily over with them into the water  beneath.    Presently the cry was raised, \"Back! back!\" And those nearest the Baron  began reining in their horses. \"Forward!\" roared Baron Henry, from the  midst of the crowd; but in spite of his command, and even the blows that  he gave, those behind were borne back by those in front, struggling and  shouting, and the bridge was cleared again excepting for three figures  that lay motionless upon the roadway, and that one who, with the  brightness of his armor dimmed and stained, leaned panting against the  wall of the bridge.    The Baron Henry raged like a madman. Gnashing his teeth together, he  rode back a little way; then turning and couching his lance, he suddenly  clapped spurs to his horse, and the next instant came thundering down  upon his solitary enemy.    Baron Conrad whirled his sword in the air, as he saw the other coming  like a thunderbolt upon him; he leaped aside, and the lance passed close  to him. As it passed he struck, and the iron point flew from the shaft  of the spear at the blow, and fell clattering upon the stone roadway of  the bridge.    Baron Henry drew in his horse until it rested upon its haunches, then  slowly reined it backward down the bridge, still facing his foe,  and still holding the wooden stump of the lance in his hand. At the  bridge-head he flung it from him.    \"Another lance!\" he cried, hoarsely. One was silently reached to him  and he took it, his hand trembling with rage. Again he rode to a little  distance and wheeled his horse; then, driving his steel spurs into its  quivering side, he came again thundering down upon the other. Once more  the terrible sword whirled in the air and fell, but this time the lance  was snatched to one side and the blow fell harmlessly. The next instant,  and with a twitch of the bridle-rein, the horse struck full and fair  against the man.    Conrad of Drachenhausen was whirled backward and downward, and the cruel  iron hoofs crashed over his prostrate body, as horse and man passed with  a rush beyond him and to the bridge-head beyond. A shout went up from  those who stood watching. The next moment the prostrate figure rose and  staggered blindly to the side of the bridge, and stood leaning against  the stone wall.    At the further end of the bridge Baron Henry had wheeled his horse. Once  again he couched lance, and again he drove down upon his bruised and  wounded enemy. This time the lance struck full and fair, and those who  watched saw the steel point pierce the iron breast-plate and then snap  short, leaving the barbed point within the wound.    Baron Conrad sunk to his knees and the Roderburg, looming upon his horse  above him, unsheathed his"]]]
