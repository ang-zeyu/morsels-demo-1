It was a curious  hunt. Some of the very young baboons were riding on their mother's  backs; these were now going at their best pace, holding onto their  maternal steeds, and looking absurdly humans but in a few minutes, as  we closely followed the Arabs, we were all in the midst of the herd, and  with great dexterity two of the aggageers, while at full speed, stooped  like falcons from their saddles, and seized each a half-grown ape by the  back of the neck, and hoisted them upon the necks of the horses. Instead  of biting, as I had expected, the astonished captives sat astride of  the horses, and clung tenaciously with both arms to the necks of their  steeds, screaming with fear.    The hunt was over, and we halted to secured the prisoners. Dismounting,  to my surprise the Arabs immediately stripped from a mimosa several  thongs of bark, and having tied the baboons by the neck, they gave them  a merciless whipping with their powerful coorbatches of hippopotamus  hide. It was in vain that I remonstrated against this harsh treatment;  they persisted in the punishment. Otherwise they declared that  the baboons would bite, but if well-whipped they would become  \"miskeen\"(humble). At length by wife insisted upon mercy, and the  unfortunate captives wore an expression of countenance like prisoners  about to be led to execution, and they looked imploringly at our faces,  in which they evidently discovered some sympathy with their fate. They  were quickly placed on horseback before their captors, and once more we  continued our journey, highly amused with the little entr' acte.    We had hardly ridden half a mile when I perceived a fine bull tetel  standing near a bush a few hundred yards distant. Motioning to the  party to halt, I dismounted, and with that the little Fletcher rifle  I endeavored to obtain a shot. When within about a hundred and seventy  yards, he observed our party, and I was obliged to take the shot,  although I could have approached unseen to a closer distance, had his  attention not been attracted by the noise of the horses. He threw his  head up preparatory to starting off, and he was just upon the move as  I touched the trigger. He fell like a stone to the shot, but almost  immediately he regained his feet and bounded off, receiving a bullet  from the second barrel without a flinch. In full speed he rushed away  across the party of aggageers about three hundred yards distant.    Out dashed Abou Do from the ranks on his active gray horse, and away he  flew after the wounded tetel, his long hair floating in the wind, his  naked sword in hand, and his heels digging into the flanks of his  horse, as though armed with spurs in the last finish of a race. It was  a beautiful course. Abou Do hunted like a cunning greyhound; the tetel  turned, and, taking advantage of the double, he cut off the angle;  succeeding by the manoeuvre, he again followed at tremendous speed over  the numerous inequalities of the ground, gaining in the race until he  was within twenty yards of the tetel, when we lost sight of both game  and hunter in the thick bushes. By this time I had regained my horse,  that was brought to meet me, and I followed to the spot, toward which my  wife and the aggageers, encumbered with the unwilling apes, were already  hastening. Upon arrival I found, in high yellow grass beneath a large  tree, the tetel dead, and Abou Do wiping his bloody sword, surrounded  by the foremost of the party. He had hamstrung the animal so delicately  that the keen edge of the blade was not injured against the bone. My  two bullets had passed through the tetel. The first was too high, having  entered above the shoulder--this had dropped the animal for a moment;  the second was through the flank.    The Arabs now tied the baboons to trees, and employed themselves in  carefully skinning the tetel so as to form a sack from the hide. They  had about half finished the operation, when we were disturbed by a  peculiar sound at a considerable distance in the jungle, which, being  repeated, we knew to be the cry of buffaloes. In an instant the tetel  was neglected, the aggageers mounted their horses, and leaving my wife  with a few men to take charge of the game, accompanied by Florian we  went in search of the buffaloes. This part of the country was covered  with grass about nine feet high, that was reduced to such extreme  dryness that the stems broke into several pieces like glass as we  brushed through it. The jungle was open, composed of thorny mimosas at  such wide intervals that a horse could be ridden at considerable speed  if accustomed to the country. Altogether it was the perfection of ground  for shooting, and the chances were in favour of the rifle.    We had proceeded carefully about half a mile when I heard a rustling in  the grass, and I shortly perceived a bull buffalo standing alone beneath  a tree, close to the sandy bed of a dried stream, which was about a  hundred yards distant, between us and the animal. The grass had been  entirely destroyed by the trampling of a large herd. I took aim at the  shoulder with one of my No. 10 Reilly rifles, and the buffalo rushed  forward at the shot, and fell about a hundred paces beyond in the bush.  At the report of the shot, the herd, that we had not observed, which had  been lying upon the sandy bed of the stream, rushed past us with a sound  like thunder, in a cloud of dust raised by several hundreds of large  animals in full gallop. I could hardly see them distinctly, and I waited  for a good chance, when presently a mighty bull separated from the rest,  and gave me a fair shoulder-shot. I fired a little too forward, and  missed the shoulder; but I made a still better shot by mistake, as the  Reilly bullet broke the spine through the neck, and dropped him dead.  Florian, poor fellow, had not the necessary tools for the work, and one  of his light guns produced no effect.    Now came the time for the aggageers. Away dashed Jali op his fiery mare,  closely followed by Abou Do and Suleiman, who in a few instants were  obscured in the cloud of dust raised by the retreating buffaloes. As  soon as I could mount my horse that had been led behind me, I followed  at full speed, and, spurring hard, I shortly came in sight of the three  aggageers, not only in the dust, but actually among the rear buffaloes  of the herd. Suddenly, Jali almost disappeared from the saddle as he  leaned forward with a jerk and seized a fine young buffalo by the tail.  In a moment Abou Do and Suleiman sprang from their horses, and I arrived  just in time to assist them in securing a fine little bull about twelve  hands high, whose horns were six or seven inches long. A pretty fight  we had with the young Hercules. The Arabs stuck to him like bulldogs, in  spite of his tremendous struggles, and Florian, with other men, shortly  arriving, we secured him by lashing his legs together with our belts  until impromptu ropes could be made with mimosa bark.    I now returned to the spot where we had left my wife and the tetel. I  found her standing about fifty yards from the spot with a double rifle  cocked, awaiting an expected charge from one of the buffaloes that,  separated from the herd, had happened to rush in her direction.    Mahomet had been in an awful fright, and was now standing secure behind  his mistress. I rode through the grass with the hope of getting a shot,  but the animal had disappeared. We returned to the dead tetel and to our  captive baboons; but times had changed since we had left them. One had  taken advantage of our absence, and, having bitten through his tether,  had escaped. The other had used force instead of cunning, and, in  attempting to tear away from confinement, had strangled himself with the  slip-knot of the rope.    We now pushed ahead, and at 5 P.M. we arrived at the spot on the margin  of the Settite River at which we were to encamp for some time. For many  miles on either side the river was fringed with dense groves of the  green nabbuk, but upon the east bank an island had been formed of about  three hundred acres. This was a perfect oasis of verdure, covered with  large nabbuk trees, about thirty feet high, and forming a mixture of  the densest coverts, with small open glades of rich but low herbage.  To reach this island, upon which we were to encamp, it was necessary to  cross the arm of the river, that was now dry, with the exception of deep  pools, in one of which we perceived a large bull buffalo drinking,  just as we descended the hill. As this would be close to the larder, I  stalked to within ninety yards, and fired a Reilly No. 10 into his  back, as his head inclined to the water. For the moment he fell upon his  knees, but recovering immediately, he rushed up the steep bank of  the island, receiving the ball from my left-hand barrel between his  shoulders, and disappeared in the dense covert of green nabbuk on the  margin. As we were to camp within a few yards of the spot, he was close  to home; therefore, having crossed the river, we carefully followed the  blood tracks through the jungle. But, after having pushed our way  for about twenty paces through the dense covert, I came to the wise  conclusion that it was not the place for following a wounded buffalo,  and that we should find him dead on the next morning.    A few yards upon our right hand was a beautiful open glade, commanding  a view of the river, and surrounded by the largest nabbuk trees, that  afforded a delightful shade in the midst of the thick covert. This was a  spot that in former years had been used by the aggageers as a camp,  and we accordingly dismounted and turned the horses to graze upon the  welcome grass. Each horse was secured to a peg by a long leathern thong,  as the lions in this neighbourhood were extremely dangerous, having the  advantage of thick"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32376"],[0,"Notes on Stable Management in India and the Colonies (#14)"],[1,"\"bearer\"; but I make him stick to his own work, which is the  control of the house and the house servants. I pick out one of the best  and sharpest of the \"syces,\" changing him till I get a good man, making  him the head or \"jemedar syce,\" and paying him a rupee a month more wages  than the rest; and he is responsible for everything connected with the  horses, and any small bills I pay to him, and him alone. The wages I pay  myself to each man regularly on the seventh of the month, for the month  previously. I never lift my hand to a servant, or fine him under any  pretext, as the fine will only be made up out of the horse's grain, but,  if fault has to be found, I do so in the presence of the head man; on the  second occasion a warning is given, and on the third the offender is  dismissed on the spot. I always keep a \"syce\" and a \"grass-cutter\" for  each horse. It is possible to get a \"syce\" and two \"grass-cutters\" to look  after two horses, by paying the \"syce\" a rupee a month more; but the  arrangement is not satisfactory, although many do it. If the \"syce\" gets  ill, which they often do, there is no one to do his work, whereas, if  there is a man to each horse, they will arrange the extra work among  themselves. In Northern India \"syces\" and \"grass-cutters\" should be  provided with warm woollen clothes in the winter. An excellent cloth for  the purpose is made by the various woollen mills, and at most of them  servant's clothes can be bought ready made up; but it is best to give the  men the materials and let them get them made up themselves, otherwise  there is certain to be something wrong with them. A \"syce's\" coat costs  about Rs. 4, and a \"grass-cutter's,\" which is made out of a coarse  blanketing, Rs. 3; and these coats should last for two winters' wear. In  addition, I used to give each man a \"coolie\" blanket that cost Rs. 3, and  which would last three winters; and, if they had to go out much into camp,  such as taking horses out to meet me on shooting or pig-sticking  expeditions, a pair of woollen leg-bandages, or \"putties.\" It is a mistake  not to give servants warm clothes, and a false economy, as, if they are  not properly protected against the cold, which is very severe in Northern  India, they are everlastingly getting fever; and I know no greater  nuisance than having your head man laid up for two or three days at a  stretch. In the second place, if they have not warm clothes themselves,  you can never tell if in the night they will not take the clothing off the  horses to wrap themselves up in. A constant source of squabbling amongst  Indian servants is the allotment of their huts or houses. In the older  Indian bungalows there is usually enough of both these and stabling, but  in the newer ones there is not. It is best, however, not to listen to any  such complaints, and somehow the disputants settle the knotty point  themselves. Every now and again it is advisable to see who is living in  your compound, as a most enormous number of relations will turn up, who  are known as brothers (bhai); and if you don't look out, you will find you  are giving shelter on your premises to several hundred individuals. Indian  servants are always asking leave to attend weddings, funerals, and  religious ceremonies; and I always allow them to go, provided some  arrangement is made to carry on their work. They are clannish in the  extreme, and a substitute was always forthcoming. In the hills  \"grass-cutters\" are not required, as grass can be bought in the bazaars.  The country people look on the sale of this as a vested right, and  naturally resent any outsider cutting it or interfering with them; and, if  they do, there is pretty certain to be a disturbance and unpleasantness.  If \"grass-cutters\" are preferred to purchasing the daily supply, local  hillmen should be employed, who will arrange the matter with their  neighbours, and not men brought up from the plains of India. In most hill  stations passes or licences have to be obtained to cut grass. In every  Indian station there is an official price-list of country produce  published, and should any dispute arise as to the rates charged, it is as  well to obtain it from the native magistrate (tehsildar), whose decision  in such matters is usually accepted as final, and which generally saves an  immense amount of trouble.          SHOEING.      Shoeing (_nal bundie_).    Shoeing is a subject on which a volume might be written of itself, far  beyond the scope of this little work, and for further information on the  art I would refer the reader to the treatises by Dr. Flemming and W.  Hunting, Esq.; but as both these deal with European practice, I will only  mention a few differences in the art as performed by the native smith, or  \"nal bund.\" In most large military stations where there are European  troops, permission can generally be obtained to have horses shod at the  regimental forge, but in out-of-the-way places the native artist has to be  employed. All horses require shoeing at least once a month, and some  oftener, as with some the horn grows quicker than others, and the hoof  requires to be shortened oftener. In these cases, if the shoe is not worn  out at the toe, it can be replaced after the foot is shortened; this is  what the English smith calls \"a remove,\" the native \"khol bundi.\" It is  advisable after work to lift up the foot and look if the shoes (nal)  have shifted or not, also to examine the clench or point of the nail  (preg) where it has been turned over, as it sometimes gets turned up and  sticks out. If this happens on the inside of the hoof it is likely to cut  the opposite fetlock (mawah lagna), and make a bad wound that may leave a  permanent scar or blemish. Some horses, from bad formation, move their  limbs so closely together that they always rub the fetlock joints when  they move. This sometimes can be corrected by what is known as a brushing  shoe; but some badly-shaped animals will always do it, no matter what sort  of shoe is put on. Various forms of pads or brushing boots are sold to  prevent this and protect the part; but, in my opinion, what is known as  the Irish boot is the best. It consists of a thick piece of blanket, or  \"mundah,\" about six inches wide and the length of the circumference of the  leg. This is fastened round the fetlock with a tape or string so that the  ends are in the middle line of the leg behind, the upper half being  doubled over the string so that there are two thicknesses to protect the  fetlock joint. I have found this far better than the more elaborate  contrivances sold; it is cheap--any one can make one in a few minutes--it  does not collect mud and dirt like the others do, and it does not become  hard like those boots made out of leather, which, unless carefully looked  to and kept soft with soap (sabon) or dubbing (momrogan), are liable to  cut horses badly. The only care required in putting on the Irish boot is  not to tie it too tight, or the tapes may cut the skin. Some pieces of  horn hanging loose, that are being cast off from the sole and frog in the  natural process of growth, are often seen. These are very likely to  collect dirt and moisture, and if they do they should be removed, but  otherwise be left alone. They can generally be pulled off with the  fingers, a piece of stick, or the hoof-picker. As a rule, in the plains of  India the majority of horses do not require shoes on their hind feet,  unless the roads are mended with stone, or the climate is very damp and  the horn gets soft. In the rainy season, if much work is being done, they  perhaps then require shoeing behind, but in the dry season the majority go  just as well without. In the hills, where the paths are rocky and stony,  horses, of course, require shoeing behind. Unlike the European, the native  smith shoes what is called \"cold,\" that is, he has a number of shoes in  sizes from which he selects one as near a fit as possible, which he  hammers into shape on a small anvil without heating it. Native shoes are  generally perfectly plain, _i.e._ flat on both sides, and, unless  specially made, are never \"seated,\" _i.e._ sloped on the foot surface, or  \"bevelled,\" _i.e._ sloped on the ground surface. As a rule, the nail-holes  are what the smith calls too fine, _i.e._ they are too near the outer rim  of the iron, and to get a hold the shoe has to be brought back so that the  horn projects over the iron. To obviate this the smith removes the toe  with the rasp, thus weakening the horn at the very place where it is  required to be strong. The shoes are generally somewhat too small also,  and to get the nail to take hold they have to be set back in the same way  as when the nail-holes are too fine. A native smith, unless he has been  shown how, never knows how to turn down the point of the nail after it has  been driven through the hoof to form the clench; he never cuts off the  superfluous part, but turns it round in a curl with the pincers, and,  needless to say, this is exceedingly likely to cause brushing. Another  great fault is his fondness of pairing and slicing away the frog and sole,  which he will have to be stopped in doing. I have seldom seen a horse  pricked in shoeing by a native, but if left to themselves they never get  the bearing true, and as a result corns are of common occurrence. Of  course, such light shoes as those of native manufacture have not a great  lot of wear in them, and in heavy, holding ground would pull off, but on  the hard level plains of India they last well enough, and the native  smith, if his faults are known and corrected, is not a bad workman after  his own lights.
