Float bits of paper    near it or carefully place a drop of ink in the water near it. By    some such method currents of water may usually be shown, and    their direction determined. Consider also the habitual motions of    mouth parts and swimmerets, the bubbles sometimes seen when a    crayfish is dropped into water and the habit crayfishes have of    lying on one side, close to the surface of the water.      Summary of the Study of Crayfishes      To summarize your study, write a connected account of the relations  of crayfishes to their environments, under the following topics:--    1. What are the varying conditions in their surroundings which  crayfishes must meet? Which are most important?    2. What conditions must be maintained in order that crayfishes may  succeed, _i.e._ may live and reproduce?    3. How does a crayfish know what are the conditions around it?    4. How is it fitted to meet these conditions? (Answer in the  following details):--    a. How wide a food range has it, _i.e._ how many kinds of food does  it eat? How does it find its food? How does it reach it? How does it  take its food? How does it make food small enough to be eaten?    b. What are the organs for taking in oxygen? Where are they? How are  they attached? How is the supply of oxygen kept up? How are the  organs kept from drying, from clogging, and from mechanical injury?    c. What ranges of temperature can crayfishes endure? What temperature  is best? How do they avoid fatal extremes?    d. What are the enemies of crayfishes? What protection against these  have they?    e. How often do crayfishes reproduce? About how many times during a  normal lifetime? About how many eggs are there and how many of them  hatch? What care is given to the eggs and to the young? About how  many of the young reach maturity? (_Suggestion._ Do the crayfishes of  a region vary noticeably in numbers from year to year?)    5. What limits the range of crayfishes, north and south? What limits  it on land? What in water?    6. When the crayfishes of a given locality are not well adapted to  it, what can they do?          _Suggested drawings._    a. The whole animal, dorsal surface, preferably without appendages.    b. One of each pair of appendages, except where they duplicate.    c. The tail-fin. Label the sixth swimmerets, the sixth and seventh  somites.    d. The gill chamber, with gills in position. Show circulation of  water by arrows.    e. A gill, to show construction.      2. COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CRUSTACEA          _Materials._    Get together all the different specimens of crustacea you can  collect, and identify the material. Then study each specimen as  follows:--          _Questions._    1. Briefly describe the exoskeleton, if there is one.    2. What region or regions are clearly segmented?    3. How much of the body is covered by a carapace?    4. Has it segmented appendages? Classify the appendages as to their  use.    5. Are the cephalo-thorax and abdomen equally developed? If not,  which is more developed?    6. How many antennae has it? Are the eyes stalked, or are they  sessile?    7. What organs of respiration has it? Where are they attached?    8. How many thoracic appendages has it, if any?    9. What methods of locomotion does it use?          _Summary._    1. Does this animal seem to be adapted to life on land or in water,  or both? Give your reasons for your opinion.    2. What characteristics are common to all the crustacea you have  studied?      3. REVIEW AND LIBRARY WORK ON CRUSTACEA      1. What are arthropods?    2. Give the classes of arthropods with an example of each.    3. What are the distinguishing characteristics of the class  crustacea?    4. In what respects are most of the appendages of the crayfish  homologous, _i.e._ alike in the plan of structure? Which do you  consider the simplest, and why do you? Which do you consider the most  specialized, and why?    5. Which somite of the crayfish is without appendages? How many  somites are there in a crayfish's body, if each somite bears only one  pair of appendages, as many scientists believe? How many of these are  in the head; thorax; abdomen?    6. Compare the nervous system of the crayfish with that of the  earthworm as regards efficiency. Upon what do you base your answer?    7. Name two points in which earthworms and crayfishes are alike. Name  three in which they differ.    8. How are crayfishes caught for market? Where do those sold in  Chicago usually come from? How are they shipped?    9. Compare the young forms of a crayfish and a crab.    10. Describe any five different crustacea.    11. Describe the work done by the United States government and by the  state governments to protect and to perpetuate the lobster. Why is it  thought necessary to do this?    12. Discuss the process and the advantages and disadvantages of  molting, as seen in the crustacea.    13. Name two advantages in having such a shell as crustacea have.  Name two disadvantages. On the whole, is such a shell favorable to an  animal's chances of success or is it not?    14. Give the curious myth about goose barnacles.    15. What crustacea are parasitic? Give an account of one.    16. Why are barnacles classed among crustacea? Where were they once  classed? Why may they be considered degenerate, even though not  parasitic? How do they manage to succeed? What is their economic  importance? How are their effects checked or prevented?    17. Describe some of the odd means of self-protection shown among  crustacea.    18. Describe a compound eye. Give two theories as to what can be seen  with a compound eye. Why do we not know, instead of theorizing?    19. What is the economic value of the very small crustacea?    20. Discuss the value to man of the various forms of crustacea.          CHAPTER V    ADAPTATIONS FOR PROTECTION FROM ENEMIES      #A. THE EXOSKELETON#      1. THE CLAM--A TYPE OF MOLLUSCA    _To Show the Effect of a Heavy Exoskeleton_          _Materials._    Living clams in aquaria, with enough moist sand to cover the clams,  preserved clams, sets of matched clamshells, a few shells with the  hinge unbroken, evaporating dishes, hydrochloric acid.          _Definitions._    _Mollusca_, a branch of the animal kingdom including those animals  with soft, unsegmented bodies, inclosed in two folds of skin known as  the mantle. They are often called shellfish as most of the forms have  a shell.    _Lamellibranchiata_ or _Pelecypoda_, names given to the class of  Mollusca to which the clam belongs. The former term refers to the  broad, flap-like gills and the latter to the hatchet-like foot.    _Valve_, one of two parts of the clamshell.    _Hinge ligament_, the elastic structure which fastens the valves  together at the dorsal margin.    _Umbones_, a pair of elevations near the anterior end of the shell.    _Lines of growth_, concentric lines around the umbones.    _Siphons_, two openings at the posterior end of the clam, the upper  opening is the _excurrent_ opening and the lower the _incurrent_. In  the salt water clam the siphons form a long tube, usually called the  \"neck.\"    _Hinge teeth_, projections near the dorsal margin on the inner  surface of the shell. The anterior irregular structure is the  _cardinal_ and the more posterior blade-like structure is the  _lateral_ tooth.    _Muscle scars_, scar-like markings on the inner surface of the shell  indicating the point where muscles were attached. The large scar just  in front of the cardinal tooth is the _anterior adductor muscle  scar_, and the one just back of the lateral tooth is the _posterior  adductor muscle scar_.    _Pallial line_, a line connecting the two muscle scars.    _Mantle_, folds of skin covering the body of the clam and lying close  to the inner surface of the valves.    _Foot_, a hatchet-shaped structure extending from the ventral edge of  the body.    _Gills_, broad flap-like structures for respiration, situated each  side of the body in the mantle cavity. They consist of a double fold  of membrane through which run many perforations lined with cilia. The  waving of these cilia cause the current of water needed for  respiration.    _Palps_, small flap-like structures near the anterior end of the  clam. They surround the mouth. On their surface are cilia which cause  currents of water toward the mouth.    _Adductor muscles_, large muscles extending from valve to valve.          _Observations._    Identify anterior and posterior ends, dorsal and ventral surfaces,  right and left sides.    1. Why may a clam be called a bivalve?    2. What is the position of the clam in the mud? What is the position  of the foot if the clam is undisturbed? Are the two valves tightly  closed or slightly open at this time?    3. What changes take place in the shell as the clam grows? What  markings on the surface of the shell indicate this?    4. Where is the clam sensitive to touch or tactile stimulus? Why has  the clam no eyes? Zoologists have found a structure in clams which  they have supposed to be an ear. Where do you think the structure is  located? Why is the clam successful without eyes? (There are many  bivalves which have them.)    5. Examine several clams until you find some with enlargements in the  gills. Break off a small part of an enlargement with your forceps and  examine under the compound microscope. Describe what you see.    6. Drop some powdered chalk or carmine in the water just above the  siphon, watch the siphons for several minutes, and note what happens.  What do you conclude to be the use of the siphons? Recalling what  took place in sponges, what would you suggest as the probable cause  of these currents? What does the clam thus probably obtain? How do  the two siphons differ? Why?    7. Place a clam in water sufficient to cover it and heat slowly to  about 40 degrees Centigrade, until the valves open slightly.

We are compelled to believe  that there is a God.    Shall we believe it less because we find in the creatures about us  intelligence and the power to care for their own lives? Has God gone on  a visit because these living creatures are looking out for themselves?  Were they made less perfectly in the beginning because when new  conditions surround them they are able to change to meet the strange  requirements? This is not less evidence of a Designer, but more. It was  long said that the existence of a watch was proof of a watchmaker who  had planned and put together all the parts so that they worked  harmoniously. But if the watch had the power to grow small to fit a  small pocket, or large to fit a large one, to become luminous by night,  and to correct its own time by the sun instead of being regulated by  outside interference, what should we have said--that it was proof there  was no watchmaker? or that it showed a far more skillful one, since he  could make a living, self-regulating, adaptive watch?    And so of the world and the creatures in it. Every evidence we get that  they can care for themselves, that they can adapt themselves to new  conditions, that they are intelligent and reasonable, capable of  improvement in habits or in structure, is so much surer proof that a  wise God made them what they are. Evolution--for that is the name by  which we call these changes--does not take God out of the universe but  makes the need of Him stronger. The argument from design is immensely  strengthened when we consider that we have not only an obedient machine  acting according to a few fundamental rules, but one that is intelligent  also and capable of self-modification.          APPENDIX    _Explanation of Terms._      [Illustration: Head of a Flicker.]         _a._ Forehead; _b._ crown; _c._ occiput; _d._ nape; _e._ chin; _f._       throat; _g._ jaw-patch, or mustache.         _Occipital_ means \"on the occiput.\"         _Nuchal_ means \"on the nape.\"         _Primaries_ are the nine or ten wing-quills borne upon the last       joint of the wing.         _Secondaries_ are the wing-quills attached to the fore-arm bones.         _Tertiaries_ are the wing-quills springing from the upper arm       bones.         _Wing coverts_ are the shorter lines of feathers overlapping these       long quills.         _Tail coverts_ are the lengthened feathers that overlap the root of       the tail both above and below, called respectively upper and under       tail coverts.         _Ear coverts_ are the feathers that over-lie the ear, often       specially modified or colored.         _Rump_, the space between the middle of the back and the root of       the tail.         [M] is the sign used to indicate the male sex.         [F] is the sign used to indicate the female sex.         A _subspecies_ is a geographical race, modified in size, color, or       proportions chiefly by the influence of climate. These variations       are especially marked in non-migratory birds of wide distribution,       subject, therefore, to climatic extremes. The Downy and the Hairy       Woodpeckers, for example, are split up into numerous races. It       should be remembered that when a species has been separated into       races, or subspecies, all the subspecies are of equal rank, even       though they are differently designated. The one originally       discovered and first described bears the old Latin name which       consisted of two words, while the new ones are designated by triple       Latin names--the old binomial and a new name in addition. The       binomial indicates the form first described. The forms designated       by trinomials may be equally well known, abundant, and widely       distributed. For example, among the woodpeckers, the northern form       of the Hairy Woodpecker was first discovered and bears the name       _Dryobates villosus_; but the first Downy Woodpecker described was       a southern bird, and the northern form was not separated until a       few years ago, so that the southern bird is the type, and the       northern one bears the trinomial, _Dryobates pubescens medianus_.         _North America_, by the decision of the American Ornithologists'       Union, is held to include the continent north of the present       boundary between Mexico and the United States, with Greenland, the       peninsula of Lower California, and the islands adjacent naturally       belonging to the same.         The following key and descriptions will enable the student to       identify any woodpecker known to occur within these limits:    A. KEY TO THE WOODPECKERS OF NORTH AMERICA.
