But you haven't told me about the ghost,\" she added.    Ralph, however, gave no heed to this observation. \"You like my father  and you like Lord Warburton. I infer also that you like my mother.\"    \"I like your mother very much, because--because--\" And Isabel found  herself attempting to assign a reason for her affection for Mrs.  Touchett.    \"Ah, we never know why!\" said her companion, laughing.    \"I always know why,\" the girl answered. \"It's because she doesn't expect  one to like her. She doesn't care whether one does or not.\"    \"So you adore her--out of perversity? Well, I take greatly after my  mother,\" said Ralph.    \"I don't believe you do at all. You wish people to like you, and you try  to make them do it.\"    \"Good heavens, how you see through one!\" he cried with a dismay that was  not altogether jocular.    \"But I like you all the same,\" his cousin went on. \"The way to clinch  the matter will be to show me the ghost.\"    Ralph shook his head sadly. \"I might show it to you, but you'd never see  it. The privilege isn't given to every one; it's not enviable. It has  never been seen by a young, happy, innocent person like you. You must  have suffered first, have suffered greatly, have gained some miserable  knowledge. In that way your eyes are opened to it. I saw it long ago,\"  said Ralph.    \"I told you just now I'm very fond of knowledge,\" Isabel answered.    \"Yes, of happy knowledge--of pleasant knowledge. But you haven't  suffered, and you're not made to suffer. I hope you'll never see the  ghost!\"    She had listened to him attentively, with a smile on her lips, but with  a certain gravity in her eyes. Charming as he found her, she had struck  him as rather presumptuous--indeed it was a part of her charm; and he  wondered what she would say. \"I'm not afraid, you know,\" she said: which  seemed quite presumptuous enough.    \"You're not afraid of suffering?\"    \"Yes, I'm afraid of suffering. But I'm not afraid of ghosts. And I think  people suffer too easily,\" she added.    \"I don't believe you do,\" said Ralph, looking at her with his hands in  his pockets.    \"I don't think that's a fault,\" she answered. \"It's not absolutely  necessary to suffer; we were not made for that.\"    \"You were not, certainly.\"    \"I'm not speaking of myself.\" And she wandered off a little.    \"No, it isn't a fault,\" said her cousin. \"It's a merit to be strong.\"    \"Only, if you don't suffer they call you hard,\" Isabel remarked.    They passed out of the smaller drawing-room, into which they had  returned from the gallery, and paused in the hall, at the foot of the  staircase. Here Ralph presented his companion with her bedroom candle,  which he had taken from a niche. \"Never mind what they call you. When  you do suffer they call you an idiot. The great point's to be as happy  as possible.\"    She looked at him a little; she had taken her candle and placed her foot  on the oaken stair. \"Well,\" she said, \"that's what I came to Europe for,  to be as happy as possible. Good-night.\"    \"Good-night! I wish you all success, and shall be very glad to  contribute to it!\"    She turned away, and he watched her as she slowly ascended. Then, with  his hands always in his pockets, he went back to the empty drawing-room.        CHAPTER VI    Isabel Archer was a young person of many theories; her imagination was  remarkably active. It had been her fortune to possess a finer mind  than most of the persons among whom her lot was cast; to have a larger  perception of surrounding facts and to care for knowledge that was  tinged with the unfamiliar. It is true that among her contemporaries  she passed for a young woman of extraordinary profundity; for these  excellent people never withheld their admiration from a reach of  intellect of which they themselves were not conscious, and spoke of  Isabel as a prodigy of learning, a creature reported to have read the  classic authors--in translations. Her paternal aunt, Mrs. Varian, once  spread the rumour that Isabel was writing a book--Mrs. Varian having a  reverence for books, and averred that the girl would distinguish herself  in print. Mrs. Varian thought highly of literature, for which she  entertained that esteem that is connected with a sense of privation.  Her own large house, remarkable for its assortment of mosaic tables and  decorated ceilings, was unfurnished with a library, and in the way of  printed volumes contained nothing but half a dozen novels in paper on  a shelf in the apartment of one of the Miss Varians. Practically, Mrs.  Varian's acquaintance with literature was confined to The New York  Interviewer; as she very justly said, after you had read the Interviewer  you had lost all faith in culture. Her tendency, with this, was rather  to keep the Interviewer out of the way of her daughters; she was  determined to bring them up properly, and they read nothing at all. Her  impression with regard to Isabel's labours was quite illusory; the girl  had never attempted to write a book and had no desire for the laurels  of authorship. She had no talent for expression and too little of the  consciousness of genius; she only had a general idea that people were  right when they treated her as if she were rather superior. Whether or  no she were superior, people were right in admiring her if they thought  her so; for it seemed to her often that her mind moved more quickly  than theirs, and this encouraged an impatience that might easily be  confounded with superiority. It may be affirmed without delay that  Isabel was probably very liable to the sin of self-esteem; she often  surveyed with complacency the field of her own nature; she was in the  habit of taking for granted, on scanty evidence, that she was right;  she treated herself to occasions of homage. Meanwhile her errors and  delusions were frequently such as a biographer interested in preserving  the dignity of his subject must shrink from specifying. Her thoughts  were a tangle of vague outlines which had never been corrected by the  judgement of people speaking with authority. In matters of opinion  she had had her own way, and it had led her into a thousand ridiculous  zigzags. At moments she discovered she was grotesquely wrong, and then  she treated herself to a week of passionate humility. After this she  held her head higher than ever again; for it was of no use, she had an  unquenchable desire to think well of herself. She had a theory that it  was only under this provision life was worth living; that one should  be one of the best, should be conscious of a fine organisation (she  couldn't help knowing her organisation was fine), should move in a realm  of light, of natural wisdom, of happy impulse, of inspiration gracefully  chronic. It was almost as unnecessary to cultivate doubt of one's self  as to cultivate doubt of one's best friend: one should try to be one's  own best friend and to give one's self, in this manner, distinguished  company. The girl had a certain nobleness of imagination which rendered  her a good many services and played her a great many tricks. She spent  half her time in thinking of beauty and bravery and magnanimity; she had  a fixed determination to regard the world as a place of brightness, of  free expansion, of irresistible action: she held it must be detestable  to be afraid or ashamed. She had an infinite hope that she should never  do anything wrong. She had resented so strongly, after discovering them,  her mere errors of feeling (the discovery always made her tremble as if  she had escaped from a trap which might have caught her and smothered  her) that the chance of inflicting a sensible injury upon another  person, presented only as a contingency, caused her at moments to hold  her breath. That always struck her as the worst thing that could happen  to her. On the whole, reflectively, she was in no uncertainty about  the things that were wrong. She had no love of their look, but when  she fixed them hard she recognised them. It was wrong to be mean, to be  jealous, to be false, to be cruel; she had seen very little of the evil  of the world, but she had seen women who lied and who tried to hurt  each other. Seeing such things had quickened her high spirit; it seemed  indecent not to scorn them. Of course the danger of a high spirit was  the danger of inconsistency--the danger of keeping up the flag after the  place has surrendered; a sort of behaviour so crooked as to be almost  a dishonour to the flag. But Isabel, who knew little of the sorts of  artillery to which young women are exposed, flattered herself that such  contradictions would never be noted in her own conduct. Her life should  always be in harmony with the most pleasing impression she should  produce; she would be what she appeared, and she would appear what she  was. Sometimes she went so far as to wish that she might find herself  some day in a difficult position, so that she should have the pleasure  of being as heroic as the occasion demanded. Altogether, with her meagre  knowledge, her inflated ideals, her confidence at once innocent and  dogmatic, her temper at once exacting and indulgent, her mixture of  curiosity and fastidiousness, of vivacity and indifference, her desire  to look very well and to be if possible even better, her determination  to see, to try, to know, her combination of the delicate, desultory,  flame-like spirit and the eager and personal creature of conditions: she  would be an easy victim of scientific criticism if she were not intended  to awaken on the reader's part an impulse more tender and more purely  expectant.    It was one of her theories that Isabel Archer was very fortunate in  being independent, and that she ought to make some very enlightened use  of that state. She never called it the state of solitude, much less of  singleness; she thought such descriptions weak, and, besides, her sister  Lily constantly urged her to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2834"],[0,"The Portrait of a Lady — Volume 2 (#14)"],[1," in the  bloom of her juvenility, had a hint of the rococo which Rosier, whose  taste was predominantly for that manner, could not fail to appreciate.  That he esteemed the productions of comparatively frivolous periods  would have been apparent from the attention he bestowed upon Madame  Merle's drawing-room, which, although furnished with specimens of every  style, was especially rich in articles of the last two centuries. He  had immediately put a glass into one eye and looked round; and then \"By  Jove, she has some jolly good things!\" he had yearningly murmured. The  room was small and densely filled with furniture; it gave an impression  of faded silk and little statuettes which might totter if one moved.  Rosier got up and wandered about with his careful tread, bending over  the tables charged with knick-knacks and the cushions embossed with  princely arms. When Madame Merle came in she found him standing before  the fireplace with his nose very close to the great lace flounce  attached to the damask cover of the mantel. He had lifted it delicately,  as if he were smelling it.    \"It's old Venetian,\" she said; \"it's rather good.\"    \"It's too good for this; you ought to wear it.\"    \"They tell me you have some better in Paris, in the same situation.\"    \"Ah, but I can't wear mine,\" smiled the visitor.    \"I don't see why you shouldn't! I've better lace than that to wear.\"    His eyes wandered, lingeringly, round the room again. \"You've some very  good things.\"    \"Yes, but I hate them.\"    \"Do you want to get rid of them?\" the young man quickly asked.    \"No, it's good to have something to hate: one works it off!\"    \"I love my things,\" said Mr. Rosier as he sat there flushed with all his  recognitions. \"But it's not about them, nor about yours, that I came  to talk to you.\" He paused a moment and then, with greater softness: \"I  care more for Miss Osmond than for all the bibelots in Europe!\"    Madame Merle opened wide eyes. \"Did you come to tell me that?\"    \"I came to ask your advice.\"    She looked at him with a friendly frown, stroking her chin with her  large white hand. \"A man in love, you know, doesn't ask advice.\"    \"Why not, if he's in a difficult position? That's often the case with a  man in love. I've been in love before, and I know. But never so much as  this time--really never so much. I should like particularly to know what  you think of my prospects. I'm afraid that for Mr. Osmond I'm not--well,  a real collector's piece.\"    \"Do you wish me to intercede?\" Madame Merle asked with her fine arms  folded and her handsome mouth drawn up to the left.    \"If you could say a good word for me I should be greatly obliged. There  will be no use in my troubling Miss Osmond unless I have good reason to  believe her father will consent.\"    \"You're very considerate; that's in your favour. But you assume in  rather an off-hand way that I think you a prize.\"    \"You've been very kind to me,\" said the young man. \"That's why I came.\"    \"I'm always kind to people who have good Louis Quatorze. It's very rare  now, and there's no telling what one may get by it.\" With which the  left-hand corner of Madame Merle's mouth gave expression to the joke.    But he looked, in spite of it, literally apprehensive and consistently  strenuous. \"Ah, I thought you liked me for myself!\"    \"I like you very much; but, if you please, we won't analyse. Pardon me  if I seem patronising, but I think you a perfect little gentleman. I  must tell you, however, that I've not the marrying of Pansy Osmond.\"    \"I didn't suppose that. But you've seemed to me intimate with her  family, and I thought you might have influence.\"    Madame Merle considered. \"Whom do you call her family?\"    \"Why, her father; and--how do you say it in English?--her belle-mere.\"    \"Mr. Osmond's her father, certainly; but his wife can scarcely be termed  a member of her family. Mrs. Osmond has nothing to do with marrying  her.\"    \"I'm sorry for that,\" said Rosier with an amiable sigh of good faith. \"I  think Mrs. Osmond would favour me.\"    \"Very likely--if her husband doesn't.\"    He raised his eyebrows. \"Does she take the opposite line from him?\"    \"In everything. They think quite differently.\"    \"Well,\" said Rosier, \"I'm sorry for that; but it's none of my business.  She's very fond of Pansy.\"    \"Yes, she's very fond of Pansy.\"    \"And Pansy has a great affection for her. She has told me how she loves  her as if she were her own mother.\"    \"You must, after all, have had some very intimate talk with the poor  child,\" said Madame Merle. \"Have you declared your sentiments?\"    \"Never!\" cried Rosier, lifting his neatly-gloved hand. \"Never till I've  assured myself of those of the parents.\"    \"You always wait for that? You've excellent principles; you observe the  proprieties.\"    \"I think you're laughing at me,\" the young man murmured, dropping back  in his chair and feeling his small moustache. \"I didn't expect that of  you, Madame Merle.\"    She shook her head calmly, like a person who saw things as she saw them.  \"You don't do me justice. I think your conduct in excellent taste and  the best you could adopt. Yes, that's what I think.\"    \"I wouldn't agitate her--only to agitate her; I love her too much for  that,\" said Ned Rosier.    \"I'm glad, after all, that you've told me,\" Madame Merle went on. \"Leave  it to me a little; I think I can help you.\"    \"I said you were the person to come to!\" her visitor cried with prompt  elation.    \"You were very clever,\" Madame Merle returned more dryly. \"When I say I  can help you I mean once assuming your cause to be good. Let us think a  little if it is.\"    \"I'm awfully decent, you know,\" said Rosier earnestly. \"I won't say I've  no faults, but I'll say I've no vices.\"    \"All that's negative, and it always depends, also, on what people call  vices. What's the positive side? What's the virtuous? What have you got  besides your Spanish lace and your Dresden teacups?\"    \"I've a comfortable little fortune--about forty thousand francs a year.  With the talent I have for arranging, we can live beautifully on such an  income.\"    \"Beautifully, no. Sufficiently, yes. Even that depends on where you  live.\"    \"Well, in Paris. I would undertake it in Paris.\"    Madame Merle's mouth rose to the left. \"It wouldn't be famous; you'd  have to make use of the teacups, and they'd get broken.\"    \"We don't want to be famous. If Miss Osmond should have everything  pretty it would be enough. When one's as pretty as she one can  afford--well, quite cheap faience. She ought never to wear anything but  muslin--without the sprig,\" said Rosier reflectively.    \"Wouldn't you even allow her the sprig? She'd be much obliged to you at  any rate for that theory.\"    \"It's the correct one, I assure you; and I'm sure she'd enter into it.  She understands all that; that's why I love her.\"    \"She's a very good little girl, and most tidy--also extremely graceful.  But her father, to the best of my belief, can give her nothing.\"    Rosier scarce demurred. \"I don't in the least desire that he should. But  I may remark, all the same, that he lives like a rich man.\"    \"The money's his wife's; she brought him a large fortune.\"    \"Mrs. Osmond then is very fond of her stepdaughter; she may do  something.\"    \"For a love-sick swain you have your eyes about you!\" Madame Merle  exclaimed with a laugh.    \"I esteem a dot very much. I can do without it, but I esteem it.\"    \"Mrs. Osmond,\" Madame Merle went on, \"will probably prefer to keep her  money for her own children.\"    \"Her own children? Surely she has none.\"    \"She may have yet. She had a poor little boy, who died two years ago,  six months after his birth. Others therefore may come.\"    \"I hope they will, if it will make her happy. She's a splendid woman.\"    Madame Merle failed to burst into speech. \"Ah, about her there's much to  be said. Splendid as you like! We've not exactly made out that you're a  parti. The absence of vices is hardly a source of income.    \"Pardon me, I think it may be,\" said Rosier quite lucidly.    \"You'll be a touching couple, living on your innocence!\"    \"I think you underrate me.\"    \"You're not so innocent as that? Seriously,\" said Madame Merle,  \"of course forty thousand francs a year and a nice character are a  combination to be considered. I don't say it's to be jumped at, but  there might be a worse offer. Mr. Osmond, however, will probably incline  to believe he can do better.\"    \"HE can do so perhaps; but what can his daughter do? She can't do better  than marry the man she loves. For she does, you know,\" Rosier added  eagerly.    \"She does--I know it.\"    \"Ah,\" cried the young man, \"I said you were the person to come to.\"    \"But I don't know how you know it, if you haven't asked her,\" Madame  Merle went on.    \"In such a case there's no need of asking and telling; as you say, we're  an innocent couple. How did YOU know it?\"    \"I who am not innocent? By being very crafty. Leave it to me; I'll find  out for you.\"    Rosier got up and stood smoothing his hat. \"You say that rather coldly.  Don't simply find out how it is, but try to make it as it should be.\"    \"I'll do my best. I'll try to make the most of your advantages.\"    \"Thank you so very much. Meanwhile then I'll say a word to Mrs. Osmond.\"    \"Gardez-vous-en bien!\" And Madame Merle was on her feet. \"Don't set her  going, or you'll spoil everything.\"    Rosier gazed into his hat; he wondered whether his hostess HAD been  after all the right person to come to. \"I don't think I understand  you. I'm an old friend of Mrs. Osmond, and I think she would like me to  succeed.\"    \"Be an old friend as much as you like; the more old friends she has the  better, for she doesn't get on very well with some of her new. But don't  for the present try to make her take up the cudgels for you. Her husband  may have other views, and, as a person who wishes her well, I advise you  not to multiply points of"]]]
