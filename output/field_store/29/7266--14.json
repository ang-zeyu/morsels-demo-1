This wild melody was  infinitely superior to any that we had ever heard of the same  kind; it seemed to be like small bells most exquisitely tuned,  and perhaps the distance, and the water between, might be no  small advantage to the sound.  Upon enquiry we were informed  that the birds here always began to sing about two hours after  midnight, and continuing their music till sunrise were, like  our nightingales, silent the rest of the day.\"    [This celebrated descriptive passage by Dr. Hawkesworth is  based upon the following original from `Banks's Journal,' which  now, after an interval of 122 years, has just been published in  London, edited by Sir J. D. Hooker.]    1770.  J. Banks, `Journal,' Jan. 17 (edition 1896):    \"I was awakened by the singing of the birds ashore, from whence  we are distant not a quarter of a mile.  Their numbers were  certainly very great.  They seemed to strain their throats with  emulation, and made, perhaps, the most melodious wild music I  have ever heard, almost imitating small bells, but with the  most tunable silver sound imaginable, to which, maybe, the  distance was no small addition.  On inquiring of our people, I  was told that they had observed them ever since we had been  here, and that they began to sing about one or two in the  morning, and continue till sunrise, after which they are silent  all day, like our nightingales.\"    1802.

See; here comes a  troop of men. They carry instruments of music: they are dressed in a  livery, a cloak of green: they march together entering at the western  doors and tramping through the whole length of the church to the chapel  of Our Lady in the East. This is the Guild of the Minstrels. There were  many other guilds attached to the Cathedral. You shall learn presently  what was the meaning of these guilds.          24. ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.    PART II.      Such was Paul's in the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth the  Reformation came. The candles were all put out; the shrines were  destroyed; the altars were taken out of the chapels: the miraculous  images were taken away: the church, compared with its previous  condition, became a shell. The choir was walled off for public worship:  the rest of the church became a place of public resort: the poets of the  time are full of allusions to Paul's Walk. It was a common thoroughfare  even for men leading pack horses and asses. The Cathedral, left to  neglect, began to fall into a ruinous condition. An attempt was made at  restoration: funds were collected, but they came in slowly. Laud, who  became Bishop of London in 1631, gave an impetus to the work: the  celebrated Inigo Jones was appointed architect: in order to prevent the  church from being turned into an Exchange, he built a West Porch, which  is shown in some of the pictures of St. Paul's. In the time of the  Commonwealth this portico was let off in shops and stalls: the nave of  the church actually became a cavalry barrack.    [Illustration: OLD ST. PAUL'S ON FIRE.    (_From Longman's 'A History of the Three Cathedrals of St. Paul's.'_)]    When King Charles returned it was resolved to repair and restore the  cathedral, by this time almost in ruins: but while the citizens were  considering what should be done, the Great Fire of London settled the  question by burning down all that was left.    Then Christopher Wren began the present building. The first stone was  laid on June 21, 1675, nine years after the Fire. Divine service was  performed on December 2, 1697, the day of thanksgiving for the Peace of  Ryswick. The work was completed in 1710, thirty-five years after its  commencement. The present church is 100 feet shorter than its  predecessor: its dome is also 100 feet lower than the former spire. The  grandeur of the building cannot be appreciated by any near view, because  the houses block it in on all sides, and the former view from the bottom  of Ludgate Hill is now spoiled by the railway bridge. Those who wish to  see what St. Paul's really is--how splendid a church it is--how grandly  it stands above the whole City--must cross the river and look at it from  Bankside, Southwark.    The dome is three fold: it consists of an outer casing of wood covered  with lead: a cone of bricks which supports the lantern and cross: and an  inner cupola of brick which supports nothing. The towers at the west end  are 222 feet in height.    St. Paul's, especially since the crowding at Westminster Abbey, is  becoming the National Burial Church. It is already well filled with  monuments of British worthies and heroes of this and the last century.  Of men distinguished in Literature, Art, and Science, there are buried  here Dr. Johnson, Hallam the historian, Sir Joshua Reynolds the painter,  Turner the painter, Rennie the engineer who built Waterloo Bridge, Sir  William Jones, the great Oriental scholar, and Sir Astley Cooper, the  great surgeon. There is also buried here, as he should be, Sir  Christopher Wren himself. But those who visit the Cathedral desire most  to see the tombs of Wellington and Nelson. The remains of the former lie  in a great sarcophagus worked out of a single piece of Cornish porphyry.  Those of the Admiral were placed first in a coffin made from the main  mast of the French ship _Orient_, taken at the Battle of the Nile.  This was deposited in a sarcophagus made by Cardinal Wolsey and intended  for the burial of King Henry the Eighth. In the Cathedral, too, you will  find the monuments of those splendid fighting men, Lord Collingwood,  Nelson's friend: Howe and Rodney: Earl St. Vincent, who won the battle  of Cape St. Vincent: Lord Duncan of Camperdown, and many others.    [Illustration: WEST FRONT OF ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL CHURCH.    (_Built by Sir Christopher Wren._)]    In the crypt you will find, if you look for it, the brass tablet which  marks the spot where lie the remains of a man whose history should be an  encouragement to every boy who reads this book. His name was Edward  Palmer. Born without family influence, plainly educated at the grammar  school of his town, he taught himself in the teeth of all  difficulties--that of bad health especially--Arabic, Persian, and all  the languages which belong to that group: at the age of twenty-four he  was so splendid an Oriental scholar that the greatest Orientalist at  Cambridge declared that he could teach him nothing. He was elected to a  Fellowship at St. John's College and became the Lord Almoner's Professor  of Arabic. He mastered, in addition to his Oriental studies, all the  European languages except Russian and the Slavonic group. He explored  the Desert of the Exodus and the Peninsula of Sinai. He did a great deal  of literary work. But he was not buried in St. Paul's Cathedral for  these studies. In the year 1882, when the Egyptian War broke out, he was  sent on a secret mission to the tribes of the Desert. He knew them all:  he could talk their language as well as his own: he was the equal of any  one in his knowledge of Arabic poetry and his power of telling stories:  they welcomed him with open arms: the service that he rendered to his  country for which he was honoured with a funeral at St. Paul's, was that  he prevented these tribes from destroying the Suez Canal. He succeeded  in reaching the British camp at Suez in safety, his task accomplished,  the safety of the Canal assured. He was murdered in return by a party of  Egyptian Arabs sent from Cairo. His bones were recovered by Sir Charles  Warren--who further tracked down and hanged every man connected with the  murder. The road to possible greatness lies open to all, but the way  leads through a difficult and thorny way only to be passed, as Palmer  found, by resolution invincible and by long patient industry.          25. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.      St. Paul's Cathedral stood in the centre of an oval-shaped enclosure  very much like the present St. Paul's Churchyard, save that the houses  now in the north are an encroachment. This open space was surrounded by  a wall, in which were six gates embattled. The first was the Great  Western Gate, facing Ludgate Hill: the second in Paul's Alley in  Paternoster Row: the third at Canon Alley: the fourth, or Little Gate,  where is now the entrance into Cheapside: the fifth, St. Augustine's  Gate, Watling Street: the sixth at Paul's Chain.    [Illustration: PAUL'S CROSS.]    Walking round this enclosure we come first upon the Bishop's Palace,  standing on the north side of the Nave. The Palace was provided with a  private entrance into the Cathedral. Beyond the Palace was a very  beautiful cloister called Pardon Church Haugh. In this cloister stood a  chapel built by Gilbert, father of Thomas a Becket. Many monuments and  tombs of great persons stood within this cloister, which was also  remarkable for its 'Dances of Death.' This was a series of paintings  representing Death as a skeleton armed with a dart, leading by the hand  men and women of every degree, from the highest to the lowest. There  were formerly many examples of such dances. Next to the cloister was  the library, the catalogue of which still exists to show what a  scholar's collection of books then meant. Next to the library stood the  College of the Minor Canons: then came Charnel Chapel, beneath which was  a crypt filled with human bones taken from the churchyard. Remember that  this has been a burial place ever since the year 610, when a church was  first built here. From the year 610 till the year 1840, or for a period  of 1,200 years, new graves were continually made in this ground. Who can  guess how many thousands lie buried here? Every handful of the dust is a  handful of human remains. From time to time, however, the bones were  collected and placed in this crypt of Charnel Chapel. The chapel itself  was apparently a large building, for when it was pulled down the  materials were used by the Duke of Somerset at the Reformation in  building Somerset House in the Strand. There are yet standing some  portions of the original house, so that the stones of Charnel Chapel may  still be seen. As for the crypt, they carried away the bones, which made  a thousand cartloads, and laid them over Finsbury Fields, covering them  with ground, on which were erected three windmills. The site is marked  by the street called Windmill Street.    Next to Charnel Chapel stood the famous Paul's Cross.    This famous place was a Pulpit Cross, from which sermons might be  preached in the open air. Several London churches had their open-air  pulpits: notably St. Michael's, Cornhill; St. Mary's Spital, without  Bishopsgate--at this Cross a sermon was preached every Easter to the  Lord Mayor and aldermen. When Paul's Cross was erected is not known: it  probably stood on the site of some scaffold or steps, from which the  people were anciently harangued, for this was the place of the  folk-mote, or meeting of the people. Here were read aloud, and  proclaimed, the King's Laws and Orders: here the"]]]
