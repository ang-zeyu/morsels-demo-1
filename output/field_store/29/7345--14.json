[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3289"],[0,"The Valley of Fear (#14)"],[1," four o'clock. At that hour we  shall meet again in this room. Until then we may each do what we like;  for I can assure you that this inquiry has come to a definite pause.\"    Evening was drawing in when we reassembled. Holmes was very serious in  his manner, myself curious, and the detectives obviously critical and  annoyed.    \"Well, gentlemen,\" said my friend gravely, \"I am asking you now to  put everything to the test with me, and you will judge for yourselves  whether the observations I have made justify the conclusions to which  I have come. It is a chill evening, and I do not know how long our  expedition may last; so I beg that you will wear your warmest coats.  It is of the first importance that we should be in our places before it  grows dark; so with your permission we shall get started at once.\"    We passed along the outer bounds of the Manor House park until we came  to a place where there was a gap in the rails which fenced it. Through  this we slipped, and then in the gathering gloom we followed Holmes  until we had reached a shrubbery which lies nearly opposite to the main  door and the drawbridge. The latter had not been raised. Holmes crouched  down behind the screen of laurels, and we all three followed his  example.    \"Well, what are we to do now?\" asked MacDonald with some gruffness.    \"Possess our souls in patience and make as little noise as possible,\"  Holmes answered.    \"What are we here for at all? I really think that you might treat us  with more frankness.\"    Holmes laughed. \"Watson insists that I am the dramatist in real life,\"  said he. \"Some touch of the artist wells up within me, and calls  insistently for a well-staged performance. Surely our profession, Mr.  Mac, would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the  scene so as to glorify our results. The blunt accusation, the brutal tap  upon the shoulder--what can one make of such a denouement? But the quick  inference, the subtle trap, the clever forecast of coming events, the  triumphant vindication of bold theories--are these not the pride and the  justification of our life's work? At the present moment you thrill with  the glamour of the situation and the anticipation of the hunt. Where  would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable? I only  ask a little patience, Mr. Mac, and all will be clear to you.\"    \"Well, I hope the pride and justification and the rest of it will come  before we all get our death of cold,\" said the London detective with  comic resignation.    We all had good reason to join in the aspiration; for our vigil was a  long and bitter one. Slowly the shadows darkened over the long, sombre  face of the old house. A cold, damp reek from the moat chilled us to  the bones and set our teeth chattering. There was a single lamp over the  gateway and a steady globe of light in the fatal study. Everything else  was dark and still.    \"How long is this to last?\" asked the inspector finally. \"And what is it  we are watching for?\"    \"I have no more notion than you how long it is to last,\" Holmes answered  with some asperity. \"If criminals would always schedule their movements  like railway trains, it would certainly be more convenient for all of  us. As to what it is we--Well, THAT'S what we are watching for!\"    As he spoke the bright, yellow light in the study was obscured by  somebody passing to and fro before it. The laurels among which we lay  were immediately opposite the window and not more than a hundred feet  from it. Presently it was thrown open with a whining of hinges, and we  could dimly see the dark outline of a man's head and shoulders looking  out into the gloom. For some minutes he peered forth in furtive,  stealthy fashion, as one who wishes to be assured that he is unobserved.  Then he leaned forward, and in the intense silence we were aware of the  soft lapping of agitated water. He seemed to be stirring up the moat  with something which he held in his hand. Then suddenly he hauled  something in as a fisherman lands a fish--some large, round object which  obscured the light as it was dragged through the open casement.    \"Now!\" cried Holmes. \"Now!\"    We were all upon our feet, staggering after him with our stiffened  limbs, while he ran swiftly across the bridge and rang violently at the  bell. There was the rasping of bolts from the other side, and the amazed  Ames stood in the entrance. Holmes brushed him aside without a word and,  followed by all of us, rushed into the room which had been occupied by  the man whom we had been watching.    The oil lamp on the table represented the glow which we had seen from  outside. It was now in the hand of Cecil Barker, who held it towards us  as we entered. Its light shone upon his strong, resolute, clean-shaved  face and his menacing eyes.    \"What the devil is the meaning of all this?\" he cried. \"What are you  after, anyhow?\"    Holmes took a swift glance round, and then pounced upon a sodden bundle  tied together with cord which lay where it had been thrust under the  writing table.    \"This is what we are after, Mr. Barker--this bundle, weighted with a  dumb-bell, which you have just raised from the bottom of the moat.\"    Barker stared at Holmes with amazement in his face. \"How in thunder came  you to know anything about it?\" he asked.    \"Simply that I put it there.\"    \"You put it there! You!\"    \"Perhaps I should have said 'replaced it there,'\" said Holmes. \"You will  remember, Inspector MacDonald, that I was somewhat struck by the absence  of a dumb-bell. I drew your attention to it; but with the pressure of  other events you had hardly the time to give it the consideration which  would have enabled you to draw deductions from it. When water is near  and a weight is missing it is not a very far-fetched supposition that  something has been sunk in the water. The idea was at least worth  testing; so with the help of Ames, who admitted me to the room, and the  crook of Dr. Watson's umbrella, I was able last night to fish up and  inspect this bundle.    \"It was of the first importance, however, that we should be able to  prove who placed it there. This we accomplished by the very obvious  device of announcing that the moat would be dried to-morrow, which had,  of course, the effect that whoever had hidden the bundle would most  certainly withdraw it the moment that darkness enabled him to do so. We  have no less than four witnesses as to who it was who took advantage  of the opportunity, and so, Mr. Barker, I think the word lies now with  you.\"    Sherlock Holmes put the sopping bundle upon the table beside the lamp  and undid the cord which bound it. From within he extracted a dumb-bell,  which he tossed down to its fellow in the corner. Next he drew forth a  pair of boots. \"American, as you perceive,\" he remarked, pointing to  the toes. Then he laid upon the table a long, deadly, sheathed knife.  Finally he unravelled a bundle of clothing, comprising a complete set of  underclothes, socks, a gray tweed suit, and a short yellow overcoat.    \"The clothes are commonplace,\" remarked Holmes, \"save only the overcoat,  which is full of suggestive touches.\" He held it tenderly towards the  light. \"Here, as you perceive, is the inner pocket prolonged into the  lining in such fashion as to give ample space for the truncated fowling  piece. The tailor's tab is on the neck--'Neal, Outfitter, Vermissa,  U.S.A.' I have spent an instructive afternoon in the rector's library,  and have enlarged my knowledge by adding the fact that Vermissa is a  flourishing little town at the head of one of the best known coal and  iron valleys in the United States. I have some recollection, Mr. Barker,  that you associated the coal districts with Mr. Douglas's first wife,  and it would surely not be too far-fetched an inference that the V.V.  upon the card by the dead body might stand for Vermissa Valley, or that  this very valley which sends forth emissaries of murder may be that  Valley of Fear of which we have heard. So much is fairly clear. And  now, Mr. Barker, I seem to be standing rather in the way of your  explanation.\"    It was a sight to see Cecil Barker's expressive face during this  exposition of the great detective. Anger, amazement, consternation, and  indecision swept over it in turn. Finally he took refuge in a somewhat  acrid irony.    \"You know such a lot, Mr. Holmes, perhaps you had better tell us some  more,\" he sneered.    \"I have no doubt that I could tell you a great deal more, Mr. Barker;  but it would come with a better grace from you.\"    \"Oh, you think so, do you? Well, all I can say is that if there's any  secret here it is not my secret, and I am not the man to give it away.\"    \"Well, if you take that line, Mr. Barker,\" said the inspector quietly,  \"we must just keep you in sight until we have the warrant and can hold  you.\"    \"You can do what you damn please about that,\" said Barker defiantly.    The proceedings seemed to have come to a definite end so far as he was  concerned; for one had only to look at that granite face to realize that  no peine forte et dure would ever force him to plead against his will.  The deadlock was broken, however, by a woman's voice. Mrs. Douglas had  been standing listening at the half opened door, and now she entered the  room.    \"You have done enough for now, Cecil,\" said she. \"Whatever comes of it  in the future, you have done enough.\"    \"Enough and more than enough,\" remarked Sherlock Holmes gravely. \"I have  every sympathy with you, madam, and should strongly urge you to have  some confidence in the common sense of our jurisdiction and to take the  police voluntarily into your complete confidence. It may be that I am  myself at fault for not following up the hint which you conveyed to me  through my friend, Dr. Watson; but, at that time I had every reason to  believe that you were directly concerned in the crime. Now I am  assured that this is not so. At the same time, there "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3291"],[0,"John Marshall and the Constitution, a Chronicle of the Supreme Court (#14)"],[1,"proved \"in the course of the whole evidence,\" that would be  sufficient. The day following the Court read an opinion which is a model  of ambiguous and equivocal statement, but the purport was fairly clear:  for the moment the Court would not interfere, and the prosecution was  free to proceed as it thought best, with the warning that the Damocles  sword of \"irrelevancy\" was suspended over its head by the barest thread  and might fall at any moment.    For the next two days the legal battle was kept in abeyance while the  taking of testimony went forward. Eaton was followed on the stand by  Commodore Truxton, who stated that in conversation with him Burr had  seemed to be aiming only at an expedition against Mexico. Then came  General Morgan and his two sons who asserted their belief in the  treasonable character of Burr's designs. Finally a series of witnesses,  the majority of them servants of Blennerhassett, testified that on the  evening of December 10, 1806, Burr's forces had assembled on the island.    This line of testimony concluded, the prosecution next indicated its  intention of introducing evidence to show Burr's connection with the  assemblage on the island, when the defense sprang the coup it had been  maturing from the outset. Pointing out the notorious fact that on the  night of the 10th of December Burr had not been present at the island  but had been two hundred miles away in Kentucky, they contended that,  under the Constitution, the assemblage on Blennerhassett's island could  not be regarded as his act, even granting that he had advised it, for,  said they, advising war is one thing but levying it is quite another.  If this interpretation was correct, then no overt act of levying war,  either within the jurisdiction of the Court or stated in the indictment,  had been, or could be, shown against Burr. Hence the taking of  evidence--if not the cause itself, indeed--should be discontinued.    The legal question raised by this argument was the comparatively simple  one whether the constitutional provision regarding treason was to be  interpreted in the light of the Common Law doctrine that \"in treason  all are principals.\" For if it were to be so interpreted and if Burr's  connection with the general conspiracy culminating in the assemblage was  demonstrable by any sort of legal evidence, then the assemblage was  his act, his overt act, proved moreover by thrice the two witnesses  constitutionally required! Again it fell to Wirt to represent the  prosecution, and he discharged his task most brilliantly. He showed  beyond peradventure that the Common Law doctrine was grounded upon  unshakable authority; that, considering the fact that the entire  phraseology of the constitutional clause regarding treason comes from  an English statute of Edward III's time, it was reasonable, if not  indispensable, to construe it in the light of the Common Law; and that,  certainly as to a procurer of treason, such as Burr was charged with  being, the Common Law doctrine was the only just doctrine, being merely  a reaffirmation of the even more ancient principle that \"what one does  through another, he does himself.\"    In elaboration of this last point Wirt launched forth upon that famous  passage in which he contrasted Burr and the pathetic victim of his  conspiracy:    \"Who [he asked] is Blennerhassett? A native of Ireland, a man of  letters, who fled from the storms of his own country to find quiet in  ours.... Possessing himself of a beautiful island in the Ohio he rears  upon it a palace and decorates it with every romantic embellishment of  fancy. [Then] in the midst of all this peace, this innocent simplicity,  this pure banquet of the heart, the destroyer comes... to change this  paradise into a hell .... By degrees he infuses [into the heart of  Blennerhassett] the poison of his own ambition.... In a short time  the whole man is changed, and every object of his former delight is  relinquished .... His books are abandoned.... His enchanted island is  destined soon to relapse into a wilderness; and in a few months we find  the beautiful and tender partner of his bosom, whom he lately 'permitted  not the winds of summer to visit too roughly,' we find her shivering at  midnight on the winter banks of the Ohio and mingling her tears with the  torrents that froze as they fell. Yet this unfortunate man, thus ruined,  and undone and made to play a subordinate part in this grand drama of  guilt and treason, this man is to be called the principal offender,  while he by whom he was thus plunged in misery is comparatively  innocent, a mere accessory! Is this reason? Is it law? Is it humanity?  Sir, neither the human heart nor the human understanding will bear a  perversion so monstrous and absurd!\"    But there was one human heart, one human understanding--and that, in  ordinary circumstances, a very good one--which was quite willing to  shoulder just such a monstrous perversion, or at least its equivalent,  and that heart was John Marshall's. The discussion of the motion to  arrest the evidence continued ten days, most of the time being occupied  by Burr's attorneys. * Finally, on the last day of the month, the  Chief Justice handed down an opinion accepting practically the whole  contention of Burr's attorneys, but offering a totally new set of  reasons for it. On the main question at issue, namely, whether under the  Constitution all involved in a treasonable enterprise are principals,  Marshall pretended not to pass; but in fact he rejected the essential  feature of the Common Law doctrine, namely, the necessary legal presence  at the scene of action of all parties to the conspiracy. The crux of  his argument he embodied in the following statement: \"If in one case  the presence of the individual make the guilt of the [treasonable]  assemblage HIS guilt, and in the other case, the procurement by the  individual make the guilt of the [treasonable] assemblage, his guilt,  then presence and procurement are equally component parts of the  overt act, and equally require two witnesses.\" Unfortunately for this  argument, the Constitution does not require that the \"component parts\"  of the overt act be proved by two witnesses, but only that the overt  act--the corpus delicti--be so proved; and for the simple reason that,  when by further evidence any particular individual is connected with  the treasonable combination which brought about the overt act, that act,  assuming the Common Law doctrine, becomes his act, and he is accordingly  responsible for it at the place where it occurred. Burr's attorneys  admitted this contention unreservedly. Indeed, that was precisely the  reason why they had opposed the Common Law doctrine.       * A recurrent feature of their arguments was a denunciation of  \"constructive treason.\" But this was mere declamation. Nobody was  charging Burr with any sort of treason except that which is specifically  defined by the Constitution itself, namely, the levying of war against  the United States. The only question at issue was as to the method of  proof by which this crime may be validly established in the case of one  accused of procuring treason. There was also much talk about the danger  and injustice of dragging a man from one end of the country to stand  trial for an act committed at the other end of it. The answer was that,  if the man himself procured the act or joined others in bringing  it about, he ought to stand trial where the act occurred. This same  \"injustice\" may happen today in the case of murder!      Marshall's effort to steer between this doctrine and its obvious  consequences for the case before him placed him, therefore, in the  curious position of demanding that two overt acts be proved each by two  witnesses. But if two, why not twenty? For it must often happen that the  traitor's connection with the overt act is demonstrable not by a single  act but a series of acts. Furthermore, in the case of procurers of  treason, this connection will ordinarily not appear in overt acts at all  but, as in Burr's own case, will be covert. Can it be, then, that the  Constitution is chargeable with the absurdity of regarding the procurers  of treason as traitors and yet of making their conviction impossible?  The fact of the matter was that six months earlier, before his attitude  toward Burr's doings had begun to take color from his hatred and  distrust of Jefferson, Marshall had entertained no doubt that the Common  Law doctrine underlay the constitutional definition of treason. Speaking  for the Supreme Court in the case of Bollmann and Swartwout, he had  said: \"It is not the intention of the Court to say that no individual  can be guilty of this crime who has not appeared in arms against his  country; on the contrary, if war be actually levied, that is, if a body  of men be actually assembled for the purpose of effecting by force a  treasonable purpose, all those who perform any part however minute, or  however remote from the scene of action, and who are actually leagued  in the general conspiracy, are to be considered traitors.\" Marshall's  effort to square this previous opinion with his later position was as  unconvincing as it was labored. *       * The way in which Marshall proceeded to do this was to treat the  phrase \"perform a part\" as demanding \"a levying of war\" on the part  of the performer. (Robertson, \"Reports,\" vol. II, p. 438.) But this  explanation will not hold water. For what then becomes of the phrase  \"scene of action\" in the passage just quoted? What is the difference  between the part to be performed \"however minute,\" and the \"action\" from  which the performer maybe \"however remote\"? It is perfectly evident  that the \"action\" referred to is the assemblage which is regarded as the  overt act of war, and that the \"part however minute\" is something very  different.      Burr's attorneys were more prudent: they dismissed Marshall's earlier  words outright as"]]]
