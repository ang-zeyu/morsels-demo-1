And the general lesson  of the diagram may be summed up in a sentence. The maximum temperature on  the planet is well above freezing-point, and the part of the planet at  maximum temperature is precisely the part that we see the best. But while  this is so, it is clear that water on Mars must normally be in the state  of ice; Mars is essentially a frozen planet; and the extremes of cold  experienced there, not only every year but every night, far transcend the  bitterest extremes of our own polar regions.    The above considerations do not appear to render it likely that there is  any vegetation on Mars. A planet ice-bound every night and with its mean  temperature considerably below freezing-point does not seem promising for  vegetation. If vegetation exists, it must be of a kind that can pass  through all the stages of its life-history during the few bright hours of  the Martian day. Every night will be for it a winter, a winter of  undescribable frost, which it could only endure in the form of spores. So  if there be vegetation it must be confined to some hardy forms of a low  type. At a distance of forty millions of miles it is not easy to  discriminate between the darkness of sheets of water and the darkness of  stretches of vegetation. Some of the so-called \"seas\" may possibly be  really of the latter class, but that there must be expanses of water on  the planet is clear, for if there were no water surfaces there would be no  evaporation; and if there were no evaporation from whence could come the  supply of moisture that builds up the winter pole cap?    The great American astronomer, Prof. Newcomb, gave in _Harper's Weekly_  for July 25, 1908, an admirable summary of the verdict of science as to  the character of the meteorology of Mars. \"The most careful calculation  shows that if there are any considerable bodies of water on our  neighbouring planet they exist in the form of ice, and can never be  liquid to a depth of more than one or two inches, and that only within the  torrid zone and during a few hours each day.... There is no evidence that  snow like ours ever forms around the poles of Mars. It does not seem  possible that any considerable fall of such snow could ever take place,  nor is there any necessity of supposing actual snow or ice to account for  the white caps. At a temperature vastly below any ever felt in Siberia,  the smallest particles of moisture will be condensed into what we call  hoar frost, and will glisten with as much whiteness as actual snow....  Thus we have a kind of Martian meteorological changes, very slight indeed  and seemingly very different from those of our earth, but yet following  similar lines on their small scale. For snowfall substitute frostfall;  instead of feet or inches say fractions of a millimetre, and instead of  storms or wind substitute little motions of an air thinner than that on  the top of the Himalayas, and we shall have a general description of  Martian meteorology.\"    What we know of Mars, then, shows us a planet, icebound every night, but  with a day temperature somewhat above freezing-point. As we see it, we  look upon its warmest regions, and the rapidity with which it is cleared  of ice, snow, and cloud shows the atmosphere to be rare and the moisture  little in amount and readily evaporated. The seas are probably shallow  depressions, filled with ice to the bottom, but melted as to their  surfaces by day. From the variety of tints noted in the seas, and the  recurrent changes in their outlines, they are composed of congeries of  shallow pools, fed by small sluggish streams; great ocean basins into  which great rivers discharge themselves are quite unknown.          CHAPTER VIII    THE ILLUSIONS OF MARS      The two preceding chapters have led to two opposing, two incompatible  conclusions. In Chapter VI, a summary was given of Prof. Lowell's claim to  have had ocular demonstration of the handiwork of intelligent organisms on  Mars. In Chapter VII, it was shown that the indispensable condition for  living organisms, water in the liquid state, is only occasionally present  there, the general temperature being much below freezing-point, so that  living organisms of high development and more than ephemeral existence are  impossible.    Prof. Lowell argues that the appearance of the network of lines and spots  formed by the canals and oases, and its regular behaviour, \"preclude its  causation on such a scale by any natural process,\" his assumption being  that he has obtained finality in his seeing of the planet, and that no  improvement in telescopes, no increase in experience, no better eyesight  will ever break up the perfect regularity of form and position, which he  gives to the canals, into finer and more complex detail.    But the history of our knowledge of the planet's surface teaches us a  different lesson. Two small objects appear repeatedly on the drawings  made by Beer and Maedler in 1830; these are two similar dark spots, the one  isolated, the other at the end of a gently curved line. Both spots  resemble in form and character the oases of Prof. Lowell, and the curved  line, at the termination of which one of the spots appears, represents  closely the appearance presented by several of the canals. In the year  1830 no better drawings of Mars had appeared; and in representing these  two spots as truly circular and the curved line as narrow, sharp, and  uniform, Beer and Maedler undoubtedly portrayed the planet as actually they  saw it. The one marking was named by Schiaparelli the Lacus Solis, the  other, the Sinus Sabaeus, and they are two of the best known and most  easily recognized of the planet's features; so that it is easy to trace  the growth of our knowledge of both of them from 1830 up to the present  time. They were drawn by Dawes in 1864, by Schiaparelli in 1877 and the  succeeding years, by Lowell in 1894 and since, and by Antoniadi in 1909  and 1911. But whereas the drawings of Beer and Maedler, made by the aid of  a telescope of 4 inches aperture, show the two spots as exactly alike, in  those of Dawes, made with a telescope of 8 inches, the resemblance between  the two has entirely vanished, and neither is shown as a plain circular  dot. Since then, observers of greater experience and equipped with more  powerful instruments have directed their attention to these two objects,  and a mass of complicated structure has been brought out in the regions  which were so simple in the sight of Beer and Maedler, so that not a trace  of resemblance remains between the two objects that to them appeared  indistinguishable.    Now the gradation in size, from the Lacus Solis down to the smallest oasis  of Lowell, is a complete one. If a future development in the power of  telescopes should equal the advance made from the 4-inch of Beer and  Maedler, to the 33-inch which Antoniadi used in 1909, is it reasonable to  suppose that Prof. Lowell's oases will refuse to yield to such  improvement, and will all still show themselves as uniform spots,  precisely circular in outline? It is clear that Beer and Maedler would have  been mistaken if they had argued that the apparently perfect circularity  of the two oases which they observed proved them to be artificial, because  the increase in telescopic power has since shown us that neither is  circular. The obvious reason why they appeared so round to Beer and Maedler  was that they were too small to be defined in their instruments; their  minor irregularities were therefore invisible, and their apparent  circularity covered detail of an altogether different form.    Beer and Maedler only drew two such spots; Lowell shows about two hundred.  Beer and Maedler's two spots seemed to them exactly alike; these two spots  as we see them to-day have no resemblance to each other. Prof. Lowell's  two hundred oases, with few exceptions, seem all of the same character; is  it possible to suppose, if telescopes develop in the future as they have  done in the past, that the two hundred oases will preserve their  uniformity of appearance any more than the Lacus Solis and the head of the  Sinus Sabaeus? If a novice begins to work upon Mars with a small telescope,  he will draw the Lacus Solis and the Sinus Sabaeus as two round, uniform  spots, and as he gains experience, and his instrumental power is  increased, he will begin to detect detail in them, and draw them as Dawes  and Schiaparelli and others have shown them later. It is no question of  planetary change; it is a question of experience and of \"seeing.\"    There is a much simpler explanation of the regularity of the canals and  oases than to suppose that an industrious population of geometers have dug  them out or planted them; it is connected with the nature of vision.    A telegraph wire seen against a background of a bright cloud can be  discerned at an amazing distance--in fact, at 200,000 times the breadth of  the wire; a distance at which the wire subtends a breadth of a second of  arc. For average normal sight the perception of the wire will be quite  unmistakable, but at the same time it would be quite untrue to say that  the perception of the wire was of the nature of defined vision, as would  be seen at once if small objects of irregular shape were threaded on the  wire; these would have to be many times the breadth of the wire in order  to be detected. Again, if instead of a wire of very great length extending  right across the field of view of both eyes, a short, black line be drawn  on a white ground, it will be found that as the length of the line is  diminished below a certain point so its breadth must be increased. If the  observer is distant from the line 6000 times its length, then the breadth  must be increased to be equal to the length, and the object, whatever its  actual shape, can be just recognized as a small circular"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35993"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote de la Mancha (#14)"],[1,"urpose, selling one house, mortgaging another, and  losing by all, he at last got a pretty good sum together. He also  borrowed a target of a friend; and having patched up his head-piece  and beaver as well as he could, he gave his squire notice of the day  and hour when he intended to set out, that he also might furnish  himself with what he thought necessary; but, above all, he charged him  to provide himself with a wallet; which Sancho promised to do, telling  him he would also take his ass along with him, which being a very good  one, might be a great ease to him, for he was not used to travel much  a-foot. The mentioning of the ass made the noble knight pause a while;  he mused and pondered whether he had ever read of any knight-errant,  whose squire used to ride upon an ass; but he could not remember any  precedent for it: however, he gave him leave at last to bring his ass,  hoping to mount him more honourably with the first opportunity, by  unhorsing the next discourteous knight he should meet. He also  furnished himself with linen, and as many other necessaries as he  could conveniently carry, according to the innkeeper's advice. Which  being done, Sancho Panza, without bidding either his wife or children  good-bye; and Don Quixote, without taking any more notice of his  housekeeper or of his niece, stole out of the village one night, not  so much as suspected by anybody, and made such haste, that by break of  day they thought themselves out of reach, should they happen to be  pursued. As for Sancho Panza, he rode like a patriarch, with his  canvass knapsack, or wallet, and his leathern bottle; having a huge  desire to see himself governor of the island, which his master had  promised him.    As they jogged on, \"I beseech your worship, sir knight-errant,\" quoth  Sancho to his master, \"be sure you don't forget what you promised me  about the island; for I dare say I shall make shift to govern it, let  it be never so big.\" \"You must know, friend Sancho,\" replied Don  Quixote, \"that it has been the constant practice of knights-errant in  former ages to make their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms  they conquered: now I am resolved to outdo my predecessors; for  whereas sometimes other knights delayed rewarding their squires till  they were grown old, and worn out with services, and then put them off  with some title, either of count, or at least marquis of some valley  or province, of great or small extent; now, if thou and I do but live,  it may happen, that before we have passed six days together, I may  conquer some kingdom, having many other kingdoms annexed to its  imperial crown; and this would fall out most luckily for thee; for  then would I presently crown thee king of one of them. Nor do thou  imagine this to be a mighty matter; for so strange accidents and  revolutions, so sudden and so unforeseen, attend the profession of  chivalry, that I might easily give thee a great deal more than I have  promised.\" \"Why, should this come to pass,\" quoth Sancho Panza, \"and I  be made a king by some such miracle as your worship says, then Mary  Gutierez would be at least a queen, and my children infantas and  princes, an't like your worship.\" \"Who doubts of that?\" cried Don  Quixote. \"I doubt of it,\" replied Sancho Panza; \"for I cannot help  believing, that though it should rain kingdoms down upon the face of  the earth, not one of them would sit well upon Mary Gutierez's head;  for I must needs tell you, she's not worth two brass jacks to make a  queen of: no, countess would be better for her; and that, too, will be  as much as she can handsomely manage.\" \"Recommend the matter to  providence,\" returned Don Quixote; \"'twill be sure to give what is  most expedient for thee.\"          CHAPTER VIII.    _Of the good success which the valorous Don Quixote had in the most  terrifying and incredible adventure of the Windmills, with other  transactions worthy to be transmitted to posterity._      As they were thus discoursing, they discovered some thirty or forty  windmills, in the plain; and as soon as the knight had spied them,  \"Fortune,\" cried he, \"directs our affairs better than we could have  wished: look yonder, Sancho, there are at least thirty outrageous  giants, whom I intend to encounter; and having deprived them of life,  we will begin to enrich ourselves with their spoils: for they are  lawful prize; and the extirpation of that cursed brood will be an  acceptable service to heaven.\" \"What giants?\" quoth Sancho Panza.  \"Those whom thou see'st yonder,\" answered Don Quixote, \"with their  long extended arms; some of that detested race have arms of so immense  a size that sometimes they reach two leagues in length.\" \"Pray look  better, sir,\" quoth Sancho: \"those things yonder are no giants, but  windmills, and the arms are their sails, which being whirled about by  the wind, make the mill go.\" \"'Tis a sign,\" cried Don Quixote, \"thou  art but little acquainted with adventures! I tell thee, they are  giants; and therefore if thou art afraid, go aside and say thy  prayers, for I am resolved to engage in combat with them all.\" This  said, he clapped spurs to his horse, without giving ear to his squire,  who bawled out to him, and assured him that they were windmills, and  no giants. But he was so fully possessed with a strong conceit of the  contrary, that he did not so much as hear his squire, nor was he  sensible of what they were, although he was already very near them.  \"Stand, cowards!\" cried he as loud as he could; \"stand your ground,  ignoble creatures, and fly not basely from a single knight, who dares  encounter you all.\" At the same time the wind rising, the mill-sails  began to move, which, when Don Quixote spied, \"Base miscreants,\" cried  he, \"though you move more arms than the giant Briareus, you shall pay  for your arrogance.\" He most devoutly recommended himself to his Lady  Dulcinea, imploring her assistance in this perilous adventure; and so  covering himself with his shield, and couching his lance, he rushed  with Rozinante's utmost speed upon the first windmill he could come  at, and running his lance into the sail, the wind whirled it about  with such swiftness, that the rapidity of the motion presently broke  the lance into shivers, and hurled away both knight and horse along  with it, till down he fell, rolling a good way off in the field.  Sancho Panza ran as fast as his ass could drive to help his master,  whom he found lying, and not able to stir. \"Did not I give your  worship fair warning?\" cried he; \"did not I tell you they were  windmills, and that nobody could think otherwise, unless he had also  windmills in his head?\" \"Peace, friend Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote;  \"there is nothing so subject to the inconstancy of fortune as war. I  am verily persuaded, that cursed necromancer Freston, who carried away  my study and my books, has transformed these giants into windmills, to  deprive me of the honour of the victory; such is his inveterate malice  against me: but in the end, all his pernicious wiles and stratagems  shall prove ineffectual against the prevailing edge of my sword.\" \"So  let it be,\" replied Sancho. And heaving him up again upon his legs,  once more the knight mounted poor Rozinante, who was half disjointed  with his fall.    [Illustration: DON QUIXOTE. P. 27.]    This adventure was the subject of their discourse, as they made the  best of their way towards the pass of Lapice; for Don Quixote took  that road, believing he could not miss of adventures in one so  mightily frequented.    Sancho desired him now to consider that it was high time to go to  dinner; but his master answered him, that he might eat whenever he  pleased; as for himself, he was not yet disposed to do so. Sancho  having obtained leave, fixed himself as orderly as he could upon his  ass; and taking some victuals out of his wallet, fell to munching  lustily; and ever and anon he lifted his bottle to his nose, and  fetched such hearty pulls, that it would have made the best-pampered  vintner in Malaga dry to have seen him.    In fine, they passed that night under some trees; from one of which  Don Quixote tore a withered branch, which in some sort was able to  serve him for a lance, and to this he fixed the head or spear of his  broken lance. But he did not sleep all that night, keeping his  thoughts intent on his dear Dulcinea, in imitation of what he had read  in books of chivalry, where the knights pass their time, without  sleep, in forests and deserts, wholly taken up with entertaining  thoughts of their absent ladies. The next day they went on directly  towards the pass of Lapice, which they discovered about three o'clock.  When they came near it, \"Here it is, brother Sancho,\" said Don  Quixote, \"that we may, as it were, thrust our arms up to the very  elbows in that which we call adventures. But let me give thee one  necessary caution; know, that though thou shouldst see me in the  greatest extremity of danger, thou must not offer to draw thy sword in  my defence, unless thou findest me assaulted by base plebeians and  vile scoundrels; for in such a case thou mayest assist thy master;  but if those with whom I am fighting are knights, thou must not do it;  for the laws of chivalry do not allow thee to encounter a knight till  thou art one thyself.\" \"Never fear,\" quoth Sancho; \"I'll be sure to  obey your worship in that, I'll warrant you; for I have ever loved  peace and quietness, and never cared to thrust myself into frays and  quarrels.\"    As they were talking, they spied coming towards them two monks of the  order of St. Benedict mounted on two dromedaries, for the mules on  which they rode were so high and stately, that they seemed little  less. After them came a coach, with four or five men on horseback, and  two muleteers on foot. There proved to be in the coach a Biscayan  lady, who was going to Seville to meet her husband, that was there in  order to embark for the Indies, to "]]]
