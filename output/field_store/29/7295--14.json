He was not a good business man; and he was not beyond  the reach of politicians. At one time he was seriously disturbed in his  duties by the buzzing of the presidential bee in his bonnet. The members  of his staff were not of his moral stature, and several of them were  connected with commercial and political enterprises which left their  motives open to criticism.    The assistant commissioners were, as a rule, general officers of the  army, though a few were colonels and chaplains.* Nearly half of them had  during the war been associated with the various attempts to handle the  Negro problem, and it was these men who shaped the organization of the  Bureau. While few of them were immediately acceptable to the Southern  whites, only ten of them proved seriously objectionable on account  of personality, character, or politics. Among the most able should  be mentioned Generals Schofield, Swayne, Fullerton, Steedman, and  Fessenden, and Colonel John Eaton. The President had little or no  control over the appointment or discipline of the officials and agents  of the Bureau, except possibly by calling some of the higher army  officers back to military service.         * They numbered eleven at first and fourteen after July       1866, and were changed so often that fifty, in all, served       in this rank before January 1, 1869, when the Bureau was       practically discontinued.      As a result of General Grant's severe criticism of the arrangement  which removed the Bureau from control by the military establishment,  the military commander was in a few instances also appointed assistant  commissioner. Each assistant commissioner was aided by a headquarters  staff and had under his jurisdiction in each state various district,  county, and local agents, with a special corps of school officials,  who were usually teachers and missionaries belonging to religious and  charitable societies. The local agents were recruited from the  members of the Veteran Reserve Corps, the subordinate officers and  non-commissioned officers of the army, mustered-out soldiers, officers  of Negro troops, preachers, teachers, and Northern civilians who had  come South. As a class these agents were not competent persons to guide  the blacks in the ways of liberty or to arbitrate differences between  the races. There were many exceptions, but the Southern view as  expressed by General Wade Hampton had only too much foundation: \"There  MAY be,\" he said, \"an honest man connected with the Bureau.\" John Minor  Botts, a Virginian who had remained loyal to the Union, asserted that  many of the agents were good men who did good work but that trouble  resulted from the ignorance and fanaticism of others. The minority  members of the Ku Klux Committee condemned the agents as being  \"generally of a class of fanatics without character or responsibility.\"    The chief activities of the Bureau included the following five  branches: relief work for both races; the regulation of Negro labor; the  administration of justice in cases concerning Negroes; the management of  abandoned and confiscated property; and the support of schools for the  Negroes.    The relief work which was carried on for more than four years consisted  of caring for sick Negroes who were within reach of the hospitals,  furnishing food and sometimes clothing and shelter to destitute blacks  and whites, and transporting refugees of both races back to their homes.  Nearly a hundred hospitals and clinics were established, and half a  million patients were treated. This work was greatly needed, especially  for the old and the infirm, and it was well done. The transportation  of refugees did not reach large proportions, and after 1866 it was  entangled in politics. But the issue of supplies in huge quantities  brought much needed relief though at the same time a certain amount of  demoralization. The Bureau claimed little credit, and is usually  given none, for keeping alive during the fall and winter of 1865-1866  thousands of destitute whites. Yet more than a third of the food  issued was to whites, and without it many would have starved. Numerous  Confederate soldiers on the way home after the surrender were fed by the  Bureau, and in the destitute white districts a great deal of suffering  was relieved and prevented by its operations. The Negroes, dwelling for  the most part in regions where labor was in demand, needed relief for  a shorter time, but they were attracted in numbers to the towns by free  food, and it was difficult to get them back to work. The political value  of the free food issues was not generally recognized until later in 1866  and in 1867.    During the first year of the Bureau an important duty of the agents was  the supervision of Negro labor and the fixing of wages. Both officials  and planters generally demanded that contracts be written, approved, and  filed in the office of the Bureau. They thought that the Negroes would  work better if they were thus bound by contracts. The agents usually  required that the agreements between employer and laborer cover such  points as the nature of the work, the hours, food and clothes, medical  attendance, shelter, and wages. To make wages secure, the laborer was  given a lien on the crop; to secure the planter from loss, unpaid  wages might be forfeited if the laborer failed to keep his part of the  contract. When it dawned upon the Bureau authorities that other systems  of labor had been or might be developed in the South, they permitted  arrangements for the various forms of cash and share renting. But it  was everywhere forbidden to place the Negroes under \"overseers\" or to  subject them to \"unwilling apprenticeship\" and \"compulsory working out  of debts.\" The written contract system for laborers did not work out  successfully. The Negroes at first were expecting quite other fruits of  freedom. One Mississippi Negro voiced what was doubtless the opinion of  many when he declared that he \"considered no man free who had to work  for a living.\" Few Negroes would contract for more than three months and  none for a period beyond January 1, 1866, when they expected a division  of lands among the ex-slaves. In spite of the regulations, most worked  on oral agreements. In 1866 nearly all employers threw overboard the  written contract system for labor and permitted oral agreements. Some  states had passed stringent laws for the enforcing of contracts, but in  Alabama, Governor Patton vetoed such legislation on the ground that it  was not needed. General Swayne, the Bureau chief for the state, endorsed  the Governor's action and stated that the Negro was protected by his  freedom to leave when mistreated, and the planter, by the need on the  part of the Negro for food and shelter. Negroes, he said, were afraid of  contracts and, besides, contracts led to litigation.    In order to safeguard the civil rights of the Negroes, the Bureau was  given authority to establish courts of its own and to supervise the  action of state courts in cases to which freedmen were parties. The  majority of the assistant commissioners made no attempt to let the state  courts handle Negro cases but were accustomed to bring all such cases  before the Bureau or the provost courts of the army. In Alabama, quite  early, and later in North Carolina, Mississippi, and Georgia, the  wiser assistant commissioners arranged for the state courts to handle  freedmen's cases with the understanding that discriminating laws were to  be suspended. General Swayne in so doing declared that he was \"unwilling  to establish throughout Alabama courts conducted by persons foreign  to her citizenship and strangers to her laws.\" The Bureau courts were  informal affairs, consisting usually of one or two administrative  officers. There were no jury, no appeal beyond the assistant  commissioner, no rules of procedure, and no accepted body of law. In  state courts accepted by the Bureau, the proceedings in Negro cases were  conducted in the same manner as for the whites.    The educational work of the Bureau was at first confined to cooperation  with such Northern religious and benevolent societies as were organizing  schools and churches for the Negroes. After the first year, the Bureau  extended financial aid and undertook a system of supervision over Negro  schools. The teachers employed were Northern whites and Negroes in about  equal numbers. Confiscated Confederate property was devoted to Negro  education, and in several states the assistant commissioners collected  fees and percentages of the Negroes' wages for the benefit of the  schools. In addition the Bureau expended about six million dollars.    The intense dislike which the Southern whites manifested for the  Freedmen's Bureau was due in general to their resentment of outside  control of domestic affairs and in particular to unavoidable  difficulties inherent in the situation. Among the concrete causes of  Southern hostility was the attitude of some of the higher officials and  many of the lower ones toward the white people. They assumed that the  whites were unwilling to accord fair treatment to the blacks in the  matter of wages, schools, and justice. An official in Louisiana declared  that the whites would exterminate the Negroes if the Bureau were  removed. A few months later General Fullerton in the same State reported  that trouble was caused by those agents who noisily demanded special  privileges for the Negro but who objected to any penalties for his  lawlessness and made of the Negroes a pampered class. General Tillson  in Georgia predicted the extinction of the \"old time Southerner with his  hate, cruelty, and malice.\" General Fisk declared that \"there are some  of the meanest, unsubjugated and unreconstructed rascally revolutionists  in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2898"],[0,"Pioneers of the Old South: A Chronicle of English Colonial Beginnings (#14)"],[1,"in Europe. England was hastening toward revolution; in Germany  the Thirty Years' War was in mid-career; France and Italy were racked  by strife; over the world the peoples groaned under the strain  of oppression. In science, too, there was promise of revolution.  Harvey--not that Governor Harvey of Virginia, but a greater in England  was writing upon the circulation of the blood. Galileo brooded over  ideas of the movement of the earth; Kepler, over celestial harmonies and  solar rule. Descartes was laying the foundation of a new philosophy.    In the meantime, far across the Atlantic, bands of Virginians went out  against the Indians--who might, or might not, God knows! have put in a  claim to be considered among the oppressed peoples. In Virginia the  fat, black, tobacco-fields, steaming under a sun like the sun of Spain,  called for and got more labor and still more labor. Every little sailing  ship brought white workmen--called servants--consigned, indentured,  apprenticed to many-acred planters. These, in return for their passage  money, must serve Laban for a term of years, but then would receive  Rachel, or at least Leah, in the shape of freedom and a small holding  and provision with which to begin again their individual life. If they  were ambitious and energetic they might presently be able, in turn, to  import labor for their own acres. As yet, in Virginia, there were few  African slaves--not more perhaps than a couple of hundred. But whenever  ships brought them they were readily purchased.    In Virginia, as everywhere in time of change, there arose anomalies.  Side by side persisted a romantic devotion to the King and a  determination to have popular assemblies; a great sense of the rights  of the white individual together with African slavery; a practical,  easy-going, debonair naturalism side by side with an Established Church  penalizing alike Papist, Puritan, and atheist. Even so early as this,  the social tone was set that was to hold for many and many a year. The  suave climate was somehow to foster alike a sense of caste and good  neighborliness--class distinctions and republican ideas.    The \"towns\" were of the fewest and rudest--little more than small  palisaded hamlets, built of frame or log, poised near the water of the  river James. The genius of the land was for the plantation rather than  the town. The fair and large brick or frame planter's house of a later  time had not yet risen, but the system was well inaugurated that set a  main or \"big\" house upon some fair site, with cabins clustered near it,  and all surrounded, save on the river front, with far-flung acres, some  planted with grain and the rest with tobacco. Up and down the river  these estates were strung together by the rudest roads, mere tracks  through field and wood. The cart was as yet the sole wheeled vehicle.  But the Virginia planter--a horseman in England--brought over horses,  bred horses, and early placed horsemanship in the catalogue of the  necessary colonial virtues. At this point, however, in a land of great  and lesser rivers, with a network of creeks, the boat provided the chief  means of communication. Behind all, enveloping all, still spread the  illimitable forest, the haunt of Indians and innumerable game.    Virginians were already preparing for an expansion to the north. There  was a man in Virginia named William Claiborne. This individual--able,  determined, self-reliant, energetic--had come in as a young man, with  the title of surveyor-general for the Company, in the ship that brought  Sir Francis Wyatt, just before the massacre of 1622. He had prospered  and was now Secretary of the Province. He held lands, and was endowed  with a bold, adventurous temper and a genius for business. In a few  years he had established widespread trading relations with the Indians.  He and the men whom he employed penetrated to the upper shores of  Chesapeake, into the forest bordering Potomac and Susquehanna: Knives  and hatchets, beads, trinkets, and colored cloth were changed for rich  furs and various articles that the Indians could furnish. The skins thus  gathered Claiborne shipped to London merchants, and was like to grow  wealthy from what his trading brought.    Looking upon the future and contemplating barter on a princely scale,  he set to work and obtained exhaustive licenses from the immediate  Virginian authorities, and at last from the King himself. Under these  grants, Claiborne began to provide settlements for his numerous traders.  Far up the Chesapeake, a hundred miles or so from Point Comfort, he  found an island that he liked, and named it Kent Island. Here for his  men he built cabins with gardens around them, a mill and a church.  He was far from the river James and the mass of his fellows, but he  esteemed himself to be in Virginia and upon his own land. What came of  Claiborne's enterprise the sequel has to show.        CHAPTER IX. MARYLAND    There now enters upon the scene in Virginia a man of middle age, not  without experience in planting colonies, by name George Calvert, first  Lord Baltimore. Of Flemish ancestry, born in Yorkshire, scholar at  Oxford, traveler, clerk of the Privy Council, a Secretary of State under  James, member of the House of Commons, member of the Virginia Company,  he knew many of the ramifications of life. A man of worth and weight, he  was placed by temperament and education upon the side of the court party  and the Crown in the growing contest over rights. About the year 1625,  under what influence is not known, he had openly professed the Roman  Catholic faith--and that took courage in the seventeenth century, in  England!    Some years before, Calvert had obtained from the Crown a grant of a part  of Newfoundland, had named it Avalon, and had built great hopes upon its  settlement. But the northern winter had worked against him. He knew, for  he had resided there himself with his family in that harsh clime. \"From  the middle of October to the middle of May there is a sad fare of winter  on all this land.\" He is writing to King Charles, and he goes on to  say \"I have had strong temptations to leave all proceedings in  plantations... but my inclination carrying me naturally to these kind of  works... I am determined to commit this place to fishermen that are able  to encounter storms and hard weather, and to remove myself with some  forty persons to your Majesty's dominion of Virginia where, if your  Majesty will please to grant me a precinct of land... I shall endeavour  to the utmost of my power, to deserve it.\"    With his immediate following he thereupon does sail far southward. In  October, 1629, he comes in between the capes, past Point Comfort and so  up to Jamestown--to the embarrassment of that capital, as will soon be  evident.    Here in Church of England Virginia was a \"popish recusant!\" Here was an  old \"court party\" man, one of James's commissioners, a person of rank  and prestige, known, for all his recusancy, to be in favor with  the present King. Here was the Proprietary of Avalon, guessed to be  dissatisfied with his chilly holding, on the scent perhaps of balmier,  easier things!    The Assembly was in session when Lord Baltimore came to Jamestown.  All arrivers in Virginia must take the oath of supremacy. The Assembly  proposed this to the visitor who, as Roman Catholic, could not take it,  and said as much, but offered his own declaration of friendliness to  the powers that were. This was declined. Debate followed, ending with  a request from the Assembly that the visitor depart from Virginia. Some  harshness of speech ensued, but hospitality and the amenities fairly  saved the situation. One Thomas Tindall was pilloried for \"giving my  lord Baltimore the lie and threatening to knock him down.\" Baltimore  thereupon set sail, but not, perhaps, until he had gained that knowledge  of conditions which he desired.    In England he found the King willing to make him a large grant, with no  less powers than had clothed him in Avalon. Territory should be taken  from the old Virginia; it must be of unsettled land--Indians of course  not counting. Baltimore first thought of the stretch south of the river  James between Virginia and Spanish Florida--a fair land of woods and  streams, of good harbors, and summer weather. But suddenly William  Claiborne was found to be in London, sent there by the Virginians, with  representations in his pocket. Virginia was already settled and had the  intention herself of expanding to the south.    Baltimore, the King, and the Privy Council weighed the matter. Westward,  the blue mountains closed the prospect. Was the South Sea just beyond  their sunset slopes, or was it much farther away, over unknown lands,  than the first adventurers had guessed? Either way, too rugged hardship  marked the west! East rolled the ocean. North, then? It were well to  step in before those Hollanders about the mouth of the Hudson should  cast nets to the south. Baltimore accordingly asked for a grant north of  the Potomac.    He received a huge territory, stretching over what is now Maryland,  Delaware, and a part of Pennsylvania. The Potomac, from source to mouth,  with a line across Chesapeake and the Eastern Shore to the ocean formed  his southern frontier; his northern was the fortieth parallel, from the  ocean across country to the due point above the springs of the  Potomac. Over this great expanse he became \"true and absolute lord and  proprietary,\" holding fealty to England, but otherwise at liberty to  rule in his own domain with every power of feudal duke or prince. The  King had his allegiance, likewise a fifth part of gold or silver found  within his lands. All persons going to dwell in his palatinate were to  have \"rights and liberties of Englishmen.\" But, this aside, he was lord  paramount. The new country received the name Terra Mariae--Maryland--for  Henrietta Maria, then Queen of England.    Here was a new"]]]
