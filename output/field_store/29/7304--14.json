[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29728"],[0,"Cookery and Dining in Imperial Rome (#14)"],[1," are repetitions,  digressions, excursions into adjacent fields that may be open to  criticism. We really do not aim to make this critical review an  exhibition of scholarly attainments with all the necessary brevity,  clarity, scientific restraint and etiquette. Such style would be  entirely out of our line. Any bookish flavor attaching itself to our  work would soon replace a natural fragrance we aim to preserve, namely  our close contact with the subject. Those interested in the scholarly  work that has been contributed to this cause are referred to modern  men like Vollmer, Giarratano, Brandt and others named in the  bibliography. Of the older scientists there is Martinus Lister, a man  whose knowledge of the subject is very respectable and whose devotion  to it is unbounded, whose integrity as a scientist is above reproach.  His notes and commentaries together with those of Humelbergius, the  editor-physician of Zuerich, will be enjoyed and read with profit by  every antiquary. The labors of Bernhold and Schuch are meritorious  also, the work, time, and _esprit_ these men have devoted to the  subject is enormous. As for Torinus, the opinions are divided.  Humelbergius ignores him, Gryphius pirates him, Lister scorns him, we  like him. Lister praises his brother physician, Humelbergius: _Doctus  quidem vir et modestus!_ So he is! The notes by Humelbergius alone and  his word: _Nihil immutare ausi summus!_ entitles him to all the praise  Lister can bestow. Unfortunately, the sources of his information are  unknown.    Lacking these, we have of course no means of ascertaining whether he  always lived up to his word that he is not privileged to change.  Humelbergius and Lister may have made contributions of value from a  philological point of view but their work appears to have less merit  gastronomically than that of Torinus. To us the Basel editor often  seems surprisingly correct in cases where the gastronomical character  of a formula is in doubt.    In rendering the ancient text into English we, too, have endeavored to  follow Humelbergii example; hence the almost literal translation of  the originals before us, namely, Torinus, Humelbergius, Lister,  Bernhold, Schuch and the latest, Giarratano-Vollmer which reached us  in 1925 in time for collating. We have wavered often and long whether  or not to place alongside this English version the original Latin  text, but due to the divergencies we have finally abandoned the idea,  for practical reasons alone.    In translating we have endeavored to clear up mysteries and errors;  this interpretation is a work quite apart and independent of that of  the translation. It is merely the sum and substance of our practical  experience in gastronomy. It is not to be taken as an attempt to  change the original but is presented in good faith, to be taken on its  face value. This interpretation appears in the form of notes directly  under each article, for quick reference and it is our wish that it be  of some practical service in contributing to the general understanding  and appreciation of our ancient book.    For the sake of expediency we have numbered and placed a title (in  English) on each ancient recipe, following the example of Schuch. This  procedure may be counted against us as a liberty taken with the text.  The text has remained inviolate. We have merely aimed at a rational  and legible presentation--work within the province and the duty of an  editor-translator and technical expert.    We do not claim credit for any other work connected with the task of  making this most unique book accessible to the English speaking public  and for the competition for scholastic laurels we wish to stay _hors  de combat_. We feel we are not privileged to pass final judgment upon  the excellent work done by sympathetic and erudite admirers of our  ancient book throughout the better part of four centuries, and we  cannot side with one or the other in questions philological,  historical, or of any other nature, except gastronomical. We are  deeply indebted to all of our predecessors and through conversations  and extensive correspondence with other modern researchers, Dr. Edward  Brandt and Dr. Margaret B. Wilson, we are enabled to predict new  developments in Apician research. The debates of the scientists, it  appears, are not yet closed.    As a matter of fact, the various differences of opinion in minor  questions are of little import to us as compared with the delightful  fact that we here possess an Apicius, not only a genuine Roman, but an  \"honest-to-goodness\" human being besides. A jolly fellow is Apicius  with a basketful of happy messages for a hungry world. We therefore  want to make this work of ours the entertainment and instruction the  subject deserves to be. If we succeed in proving that Apicius is not a  mummified, bone-dry classic but that he has \"the goods,\" namely some  real human merit we shall have accomplished more than the savants to  whom this popularization of our hero has been denied so far.    After all, we live in a practical age, and it is the practical value,  the matter-of-fact contribution to our happiness and well-being by the  work of any man, ancient or modern, which counts in these days of  materialism.    So let us tell the truth, and let us sum up in a few words:    We do not know who Apicius is. We do not know who wrote the book  bearing his name. We do not know when it was written, or whether it  is of Greek or of Roman origin. Furthermore, we do not understand many  of its precepts!    We do know, however, that it is the oldest work dealing with the food  and the cookery of the ancient world's greatest empire, and that, as  such, it is of the utmost interest and importance to us.    In this sense we have endeavored to treat the book.      DINING IN APICIAN STYLE    Past attempts to dine a l'Apicius invariably have ended disastrously.  Eager _gourmets_, ever on the look-out for something new, and curious  scholars have attempted to prepare dishes in the manner prescribed by  Apicius. Most of such experimenters have executed the old precepts  literally, instead of trying to enter into their spirit.    \"_Das Land der Griechen mit der Seele suchen!_\" says Goethe. The  friends of Apicius who failed to heed this advice, also failed to  comprehend the precepts, they were cured of their curiosity, and  blamed the master for their own shortcomings. Christina, queen of  Sweden, was made ill by an attempt of this kind to regale her majesty  with a rare Apician morsel while in Italy as the guest of some noble.  But history is dark on this point. Here perhaps Apicius is blamed for  a dastardly attempt on the royal lady's life for this daughter of the  Protestant Gustavus Adolphus was in those days not the only crowned  head in danger of being dispatched by means of some tempting morsel  smilingly proffered by some titled rogue. A deadly dish under the  disguise of \"Apicius\" must have been particularly convenient in those  days for such sinister purposes. The sacred obligations imposed upon  \"barbarians\" by the virtue of hospitality had been often forgotten by  the super-refined hosts of the Renaissance.    But Apicius continued to prove unhealthful to a number of later  amateurs. Lister, with his perfectly sincere endeavor to popularize  Apicius, achieved precisely the opposite. The publication of his work  in London, 1705, was the signal for a number of people, scholars and  others, to crack jokes, not at the expense of Apicius, as they  imagined, but to expose their own ignorance. Smollet, Dr. W. King  (\"Poor starving wit\"--Swift), Dr. Hunter and others. More recently, a  party of English dandies, chaperoned, if we remember correctly, by the  ponderous George Augustus Sala, fared likewise badly in their attempt  to stage a Roman feast, being under the impression that the days of  Tiberius and the mid-Victorian era may be joined with impunity, _a la  minute_, as it were.    Even later, in one of the (alas! not so many) good books on  gastronomy, \"Kettner's Book of the Table,\" London, 1877, the excellent  author dismisses Roman cookery with a few lines of \"warning.\" Kettner,  admirer of Sala, evidently was still under the baneful influence.  Twenty years later, Danneil, colleague of Kettner's, joined the chorus  of \"irreverent critics.\" They all based their judgment on mere idle  conversation, resulting from disappointments in ill-fated attempts to  cook in the Apician style. Even the best experts, it appears, fall  victims to the mysterious spell surrounding, protecting things of  sacred antiquity, hovering like an avenging angel over them, to ward  off all \"irreverent critics\" and curious intruders.      THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING    After all, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. This homely  solid wisdom is literally true of our good old Apicius. We have tested  many of his precepts, and have found them practical, good, even  delightful. A few, we will say, are of the rarest beauty and of  consummate perfection in the realm of gastronomy, while some others  again are totally unintelligible for reasons sufficiently explained.  Always remembering Humelbergius, we have \"laid off\" of these torsos,  recommending them to some more competent commentator. Many of the  ancient formula tried have our unqualified gastronomic approval.    If our work has not differed from that of our predecessors, if it  shows the same human frailties and foibles, we have at least one mark  of distinction among the editors in that we have subjected the  original to severe practical tests as much as this is possible with  our modern food materials. We experienced difficulty in securing  certain spices long out of use. Nevertheless, the experience of  actually sampling Apician dishes and the sensation of dining in the  manners of the Caesars are worth the trouble we took with Apicius.

What are we going to do?\"    The girl stuffed the corner of her handkerchief into her mouth.    \"I am thinking of my little baby,\" she said, choking. \"I must persuade  you, Senhor. I--I have been tearful. I--I am not attractive. I will  try. If I am not attractive to you....\"           *       *       *       *       *    Bell cursed, deeply and savagely. It seemed to be the only possible  thing to do. And then he spoke coldly.    \"Listen to me, Senhora. Ribiera talked frankly to me just now. He  knows that so far I am not subdued. If I escape he cannot blame you.  He cannot! And I am going to attempt it. If you will follow me....\"    \"There is no escape for me,\" she said dully, \"and if he thinks that I  knew of your escape and did not tell him....\"    \"Follow me,\" said Bell, smiling queerly. \"I shall take care that he  does not suspect it.\"    He gazed about for an instant, orienting himself. The plane that had  just landed--the last of a dozen or more that had arrived in the past  two days--had dipped down on the private landing field to the north.    There was a beautifully kept way running from the landing field to the  house, and he went on through the thick shrubbery amid a labyrinth of  paths, choosing the turnings most likely to lead him to it.           *       *       *       *       *    He came out upon it suddenly, and faced toward the field. There were  two men coming toward the house, on foot. One was a flying pilot,  still in his flying clothes. The other was a tall man, for a  Brazilian, with the lucent clarity of complexion that bespeaks  uncontaminated white descent. He was white-haired, and his face was  queerly tired, as if he were exhausted.    Bell looked sharply. He seemed to see a resemblance to someone he knew  in the tall man. He spoke quickly to the girl beside him.    \"Who is the man to the left?\"    \"Senhor Canalejas,\" said the girl drearily. \"He is the Minister of  War. I suppose he, too....\"    Bell drew a deep breath. He walked on, confidently. As the two others  drew near he said apologetically:    \"Senhores.\"    They halted with the instinctive, at least surface, courtesy of the  Brazilian. And Bell was fumbling with his handkerchief, rather  nervously tying a knot in it. He held it out to Canalejas.    \"Observe.\"    It was, of course, a recognition-knot such as may be given to an  outsider by one in the Trade. The tall man's face changed. And Bell  swung swiftly and suddenly and very accurately to the point of the  other man's jaw.    He collapsed.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Senhor Canalejas,\" said Bell politely, \"I am about to go and steal an  airplane to take what I have learned to my companion for transmission.  If you wish to go with me....\"    Canalejas stared for the fraction of a second. Then he said quietly:    \"But of course.\"    He turned to retrace his steps. Bell turned to the girl.    \"If you are wise,\" he said gently, \"you will go and give the alarm. If  you are kind, you will delay it as much as you dare.\"    She regarded him in agonized doubt for a moment, and nodded. She fled.    \"Now,\" said Bell casually, \"I think we had better hasten. And I hope,  Senhor Canalejas, that you have a revolver. We will need one. Mine has  been ruined.\"    Without a word, the white-haired man drew out a weapon and offered it  to him.    \"I had intended,\" he said very calmly, \"to kill the Senhor Ribiera.  His last demand is for my daughter.\"    They went swiftly. The plane Bell had seen alight some fifteen or  twenty minutes before was just being approached by languid mechanics.  It was, of course, still warm. Canalejas shouted and waved his arm  imperiously. It is probable that he gave the impression of a man  returning for some forgotten thing, left in the cockpit of the plane.           *       *       *       *       *    What happened then, happened quickly. A few crisp words in a low tone.  A minor hubbub began suddenly back at the house. Canalejas climbed  into the passenger's seat as if looking for something. And Bell  presented his now useless automatic pleasantly at the head of the  nearest staring mechanic, and while he froze in horror, scrambled up  into the pilot's cockpit.    \"Contact!\" he snapped, and turned on the switch. The mechanic remained  frozen with fear. \"Damnation!\" said Bell savagely. \"I don't know the  Portuguese for 'Turn her over'!\"    He fumbled desperately about in the cockpit. Something whirred. The  propeller went over.... Canalejas shot with painstaking accuracy,  twice. The motor caught with a spluttering roar.    As a horde of running figures, servants and guests, running with the  same desperation, came plunging out on the flying field from the  shrubbery. Bell gave the motor the gun. The fast little plane's tail  came up off the ground as she darted forward. Faster and faster, with  many bumpings. The bumpings ceased. She was clear.    And Bell zoomed suddenly to lift her over the racing, fear-ridden  creatures who clutched desperately at the wheels, and then the little  ship shot ahead, barely cleared the trees to the east of the field,  and began to roar at her topmost speed toward Rio.      CHAPTER V    The Trade--which does not exist--has its obligations and its code, but  also it has its redeeming features. When a man has finished his job,  he has finished it. And as far as the Trade was concerned, Bell had  but little more to do. But after that--and his eyes burned smokily in  their depths--there was much that he intended to do. He sat in one of  the _bondes_ of the Botanical Garden half of the street railway system  of Rio, and absent mindedly regarded the scenery. This particular  _bonde_ was headed out toward the Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas, by which  salty mass of water Bell would meet Paula Canalejas. He would receive  a package from her, which he would deliver to Jamison. And then he  would be free, and it was his private intention to engage in an  enterprise which was very probably a form of suicide. But there are  some things one cannot dismiss with a sage reflection that they are  not one's business. This matter of Ribiera was definitely one of them.           *       *       *       *       *    The escape from Ribiera's _fazenda_ had been relatively easy, because  so thoroughly unexpected. The little plane had climbed to five  thousand feet and found a stratum of cloud that stretched for very  many miles. Bell had emerged from it only twice in the first hour of  flight, and the second time the sky was clear all about him. That he  was pursued, he had no doubt. That Ribiera had wireless communications  with Rio, he knew. And he knew that instant, and imperative orders  would have gone out for his capture.    Rio would not be a healthy place for him. If Ribiera had power over  high government officials, he had surely indirect power over the  police, and a search for Bell would be in order at once. Yet Canalejas  assuredly expected to return to Rio.    A shouted question with the motor cut out, and a nodded answer. Bell  headed for Petropolis, which is Rio's only real summer resort and is  high in the hills and only an hour and a half from it by train. It was  surprisingly satisfactory to be handling a swift plane again, and Bell  allowed himself what he knew was about the only pleasure he was likely  to have for some time to come.    Something of his hatred of Ribiera, however, came back as he prepared  to land. He managed to crack the plane up very neatly, so that it  would be of no use to Ribiera any more. And at the same time, of  course, the cracking-up provided an excellent excuse for Canalejas to  continue on by train.           *       *       *       *       *    They talked very briefly by the puffing engine.    \"It is best,\" said Canalejas, \"for you, Senhor, to remain here  overnight. I believe Senhor Ribiera has given orders for us both to be  looked for, yet as a Cabinet Minister I am still immune from arrest by  the ordinary police. If I reach my home I shall be able to do all that  is necessary.\"    \"And you will prepare a message for me to carry,\" said Bell.    \"It is ready,\" said Canalejas. He smiled faintly. \"No, Senhor. I have  instructions to give my daughter. She will deliver the information to  you to-morrow. Let me see. At the edge of the Lagao Rodrigo de  Feitas, at nine o'clock. She is the only messenger I can trust. I  think that is all.\"    Bell hesitated uncomfortably.    \"But you, sir,\" he said awkwardly. \"You have been poisoned, as Senor  Ortiz was.\"    \"But certainly,\" said Canalejas. His smile was ironic as before. \"But,  unlike Senor Ortiz, I have no hope. I have arranged for my daughter to  conceal herself and escape from Brazil. I have prepared for  everything, Senhor. As you know, I had intended to kill Senhor  Ribiera. In returning with you I have merely delayed my own death by a  few hours.\"    Still smiling, and with the air of one entering a train for the most  casual of journeys, Canalejas entered the coach.           *       *       *       *       *    And Bell, sitting in the _bonde_ next morning, saw with an uncanny  clarity the one weak point in Ribiera's hold upon his subjects. When  they had courage to fear nothing more than death, they could defy him.  And not many could attain to that courage. But a few....    \"I'll have some help, anyway,\" muttered Bell savagely to himself.    It is a long ride to the Botanical Gardens, from which one half the  surface lines of Rio take their name. On the way out to the Lagao  Rodrigo de Feitas, which, is close by the Garden itself, Bell had time  to work over for the thousandth time the information he possessed, and  realize its uselessness. Two things, only, might be of service. One  was that Ribiera was the nephew of the person referred to as The  Master, and yet was evidently as much subjected to him as his own  victims to himself. The other was that the ultimate end of all the  ghastly scheme was"]]]
