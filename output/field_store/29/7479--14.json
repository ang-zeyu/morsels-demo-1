This shrinking, however, can to a great  extent be presented by paying attention to the following points: These  woollen under-garments should be washed by themselves not with any  other clothes, in only moderately hot water. Next, while they are still  damp, and before becoming dry, they should be thoroughly stretched upon  a table and then well ironed out.    With regard to the sleeping apparel, there is no doubt the modern  pyjamas are a great improvement on the old-fashioned bedgown. They are  more thoroughly protective to the skin, and keep the extremities  uniformly warm, which the latter fails to do. They are better made of  flannel, thin in summer and thicker in winter. Persons who are in the  habit of wearing woollen material next the skin during the day should  certainly keep to the same at night, otherwise the change is too great,  and there is thus great risk of taking a chill. The flannel under-garment  which has been worn during the day can then be taken off at  night without any danger, and has the opportunity of being aired. It  might hardly seem necessary to refer to this fact, namely, that the  under-garment which has been worn during the day should be taken off at  night. Yet I can only say that instances in which this  particular garment is never taken off at all, but is worn continuously  both night and day, perhaps for a whole week at a time, are not  altogether so rare as they might be.    In conclusion reference may be briefly made to a subject which is  probably within the experience of everyone. There ale many people who  pride themselves on not requiring any extra clothing during the colder  months, and evidently look upon this fact as a proof that they possess  Spartan powers of endurance, and that cold is a matter of perfect  indifference to them. Now, it may be that a few individuals differ  essentially from the rest of humanity, and do not require any change of  clothing all the year round. But the majority of people who profess  this disregard to climate certainly appear as if they would be all the  better for warmer material, for their faces look pinched and their  hands seem nearly frozen with the cold. But the fact is that even if  the want of thicker clothing is not particularly felt during the cold  weather, it is always wiser to wear an extra allowance, for the heat of  summer can be endured better if this principle is carried out. If a  common-sense view of the matter is taken, then it will be readily  apparent why it is desirable to wear plenty of warm clothing during the  colder months.          CHAPTER VI.        DIET      The larger part of this work is taken up with a consideration of the  most suitable diet for those living in Australia. In this way a greater  restriction in the amount of butcher's meat is counselled, while a more  widely extended use of fish, vegetables, and salad plants is advocated.  And as far as beverages are concerned, Australian wine of a low  alcoholic strength is recommended as being the most natural beverage  for every-day use. But there are a few other matters connected with  food, and drink, and daily habits which will deserve some little  reference, and accordingly they will be dealt with. These are fruit,  tea, coffee, iced drinks, and the use of tobacco. All these are  important enough to merit notice; indeed, they are subjects possessing  more than usual interest.    Before proceeding to give attention to these, however, it will be most  convenient, at this stage, to make some remarks upon the vital topic of  the first meal of the day. With the great bulk of our population  sufficient heed is never given it, and yet it is of infinite  consequence. By far the greater number of people dawdle in bed till the  last possible moment, when all at once they jump into their bath--that  is, if they take a bath--swallow a hasty breakfast, and make a frantic  rush for their steamer, train, or tram, in order to begin their daily  work. How very much better than all this bustle, hurry, and scuttle an  hour's earlier rising would be! It would afford ample time for the  bath, which should be a bath in the truest sense of the term; it would,  above all, give a proper opportunity for a leisurely breakfast, which  is in every respect the most important meal of the day; and  lastly, it would save that wild dash at the last, which is so fatal to  proper digestion and well-being.    But it is a sad fact that, in most cases, even when there is due time  given to it, the monotony of the ordinary breakfast is almost  proverbial. With regard to the average household it is a matter of deep  conjecture as to what most people would do if a prohibition were placed  upon chops, steak, and sausages for breakfast. If such an awful  calamity happened, many the father of a family would have to put up  with scanty fare. It is very much to be feared that the inability to  conceive of something more original for the morning meal than the  eternal trio referred to is a melancholy reproach to the housekeeping  capabilities of many. To read an account of a highland breakfast, in  contradistinction to this paucity of comestibles, is to make one almost  pensive. The description of the snowy tablecloth, the generously loaded  table, the delicious smell of the scones and honey, the marmalade, the  different cakes, the fish, the bacon, and the toast, is enough to  create a desire to dwell there for a very prolonged period. However,  REVENONS A NOS MOUTONS; this has been adverted to, not so much with the  idea of urging people to copy such an example, because expense would  render it an impossibility, but to try and awaken a determination to  make more variety at the breakfast table. It is to be hoped that some  of the recipes at the end of the volume will serve as a means of  initiating a reform in this respect.    But under all circumstances, whether brain or muscle be employed by the  bread-winner, a substantial breakfast is of first-rate importance.  There is one form of food which it is especially necessary should  constitute part of the meal, and which must be referred to. This is  that variety known as the hydro-carbons or fats. The value of  fat, in any of its many forms, in promoting the health of the body and  preventing the onset of wasting diseases is hardly appreciated, and  besides this action it markedly serves to nourish the brain and nervous  system. Dr. Murchison, the late eminent physician, was wont to declare  that bacon fat or ham fat was worth a guinea an ounce in the treatment  of wasting diseases. Cod liver oil, also, has a wide repute in the  treatment of the same class of maladies. Indeed, it is related of an  eminent barrister that he used to take a full dose of cod liver oil  some time before going to plead an important case, for he found it  better brain food than anything else.    In our semi-tropical climate, however, a dislike is often taken to  butter when it is presented at breakfast in the form of semi-liquid  grease. It would require a person with the stomach of an ostrich to  digest, to say nothing of relish, such an oleaginous compound during  our hot months. But if this necessary and all-important article of diet  can be presented in an appetising shape, what a desirable result is  achieved I The mass of the people--I am not referring to those who are  well endowed with worldly gifts--are apt to look upon the ice chest as  a luxury which is altogether beyond their means. But, as I have said  elsewhere, I am firmly persuaded that if the price of ice were brought  down to one-halfpenny per pound, and if a company were formed to  deliver such a small quantity as six pounds per day, or every second  day, it would be a great boon, and moreover a wonderfully profitable  speculation. A very small and suitable ice chest could be constructed,  to sell at a few shillings, solely to preserve the butter in a  congealed, and therefore palatable, state, for children as well as for  adults. The former would take it with great avidity, and the benefit to  health resulting therefrom would be incalculable. Even in some  of the better-class houses ice is looked upon too much as a luxury, and  not, as it should be, a necessity; indeed, the money saved from gas  during the summer months might well be expended in ice.    Not only is this fatty breakfast a necessary feature in the diet of  everybody, particularly of the young and growing population, but it is  likewise a most important matter with all brain workers. If the  business or professional man can put in a liberal breakfast, consisting  largely of butter, fat bacon or ham, he can go on all day with a  feeling of energy and buoyancy. It is in this aversion to fatty matter,  in any shape or form, that the bilious and dyspeptic are so fearfully  handicapped. And not only is it necessary for an active mental worker  to be supplied with a good proportion of fatty material, but, as I have  just said, it is essential that his breakfast should be a substantial  one, in which his food is not stinted in any way. As Dr. Milner  Fothergill said: \"I would always back a good breakfaster, from a boy to  a game cockerel; a good meal to begin the day is a good foundation.\"  So, too, Mr. Christopher Heath, the well-known London surgeon, in his  advice to house surgeons and other medical officers living in  hospitals, says, \"the first symptom of \\`knocking up,/' is an inability  to eat breakfast,\" and goes on to point out how important a meal it is,  and that it should be taken deliberately and without undue haste.      FRUIT      It is undoubtedly a most fortunate thing for us in Australia that fruit  is so abundant, and that it is easily within the reach of all.

Hence we find among the Babylonians and       Arabians, the adoration of the heavenly bodies, the earliest       forms of idolatry; among the Canaanites and Syrians, the worship       of Baal, Tammuz, Magog, and Astarte; among the Phoenicians, the       immolation of children to Moloch; among the Egyptians, divine       honors bestowed on animals, birds, insects, leeks, and onions;       among the Persians, religious reverence offered to fire; and       among the polished Greeks, the recognition in their system of       faith of thirty thousand gods. Hence, moreover, we find at the       present time, among most Pagan tribes, the deadliest       superstitions, the most cruel and bloody rites, and the most       shocking licentiousness and vice, practiced under the name of       religion.\"--_History of all Religions_, p. 12.         =8. Examples of Atrocious Idolatry.=--The worship of Moloch is       generally cited as an example of the cruelest and most abhorrent       idolatry known to man. Moloch, called also Molech, Malcham,       Milcom, Baal-melech, etc., was an Ammonite idol: it is mentioned       in scripture in connection with its cruel rites (Lev. xviii, 21;       xx, 2-5; see also I Kings xi, 5, 7, 33; II Kings xxiii, 10, 13;       Amos v, 26; Zephaniah i, 5; Jeremiah xxxii, 35). Keil and       Delitzsch describe the idol as being \"represented by a brazen       statue which was hollow, and capable of being heated, and formed       with a bull's head, and with arms stretched out to receive the       children to be sacrificed.\" While the worship of this idol did       not invariably include human sacrifice, it is certain that such       hideous rites were characteristic of this abominable shrine. The       authors last quoted say: \"From the time of Ahaz, children were       slain at Jerusalem in the valley of Ben-Hinnom, and then       sacrificed by being laid in the heated arms and burned.\" (II Kings       xxiii, 10; xvi, 3; xvii, 17; xxi, 6; Jer. xxxii, 35; Ezek. xvi,       20, 21; xx, 31; compare Psalms cvi, 37, 38.) Many authorities       state that the sacrifice of children to this hideous monster long       ante-dated the time of Ahaz. \"The offering of living victims was       probably the climax of enormity in connection with this system,       and it is said that Tophet, where it was to be witnessed, was so       named from the beating of drums to drown the shrieks and groans       of those who were burned to death. The same place was called the       Valley of Hinnom, and the horrible associations connected with it       led to both Tophet and Gehenna ('valley of Hinnom') being adopted       as names and symbols of future torment.\" For foregoing facts, and       others, _see \"The Pentateuch\" by Keil and Delitzsch, and       Cassell's Bible Dictionary_.         Scarcely less horrible were the practices of voluntary suicide       under the car of the idol Juggernaut, and the drowning of       children in the sacred Ganges as found among the Hindoos.       According to Burder (\"History of all Religions\"), the ponderous       and hideous image Juggernaut, was, on festival days, usually       placed on a movable tower resting on wheels; and, thus mounted,       was drawn through the streets by enthusiastic worshipers. As the       car moved along, some of the most zealous of the devotees threw       themselves under the wheels and were crushed to death; and such       acts were \"hailed with the acclamations of the multitude as the       most acceptable sacrifices.\" The same author thus describes the       rite of child-sacrifice to the sacred river, as formerly       practiced in India:--\"People in some parts of India, particularly       the inhabitants of Orissa, and of the eastern parts of Bengal,       frequently offer their children to the goddess Gunga. The       following reason is assigned for this practice: When a woman has       been long married, and has no children, it is common for the man,       or his wife, or both of them, to make a vow to the goddess Gunga,       that if she will bestow the blessing of children upon them, they       will devote the firstborn to her. If, after this vow, they have       children, the eldest is nourished till a proper age, which may be       three, four, or more years, according to circumstances when, on a       particular day, appointed for bathing in any part of the river,       they take the child with them and offer it to the goddess: the       child is encouraged to go farther and farther into the water,       till it is carried away by the stream, or is pushed off by its       inhuman parents.\"--_History of all Religions_, pp. 745-746.         The practices of Druidism among the ancient Britons furnish       another example of degradation in religion through the absence of       authoritative guidance and the light of revelation. The Druids       professed a veneration for the oak, and performed most of their       distinctive ceremonies in sacred groves. Human sacrifices were       offered as a feature of their system. Of their temples, some,       e.g. Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, and others in       Kent, still remain. These circular enclosures, which were open to       the sky, were called _doom-rings_: near the center of each was an       altar (_dolmen_) on which victims were sacrificed. The horrible       ceremonies included on special occasions the burning alive of       large numbers of human beings, enclosed in immense cages of       wicker-work.         =9. Immaterialists are Atheists.=--\"There are two classes of       atheists in the world. One class denies the existence of God in       the most positive language; the other denies his existence in       duration or space. One says 'There is no God;' the other says       'God is not _here_ or _there_, any more than he exists _now_ and       _then_.' The infidel says 'God does not exist anywhere.' The       immaterialist says 'He exists _nowhere_.' The infidel says 'There       is no such substance as God.' The immaterialist says 'There is       such a substance as God, but it is _without parts_.' The atheist       says 'There is no such substance as _spirit_.' The immaterialist       says 'A spirit, though he lives and acts, occupies no room, and       fills no space in the same way and in the same manner as matter,       not even so much as does the minutest grain of sand.' The atheist       does not seek to hide his infidelity; but the immaterialist,       whose declared belief amounts to the same thing as the atheist's,       endeavors to hide his infidelity under the shallow covering of a       few words.... The immaterialist is a religious atheist; he only       differs from the other class of atheists by clothing an       indivisible unextended _nothing_ with the powers of a God. One       class believes in no God; the other believes that _Nothing_ is       god and worships it as such.\"--Orson Pratt, in pamphlet       _Absurdities of Immaterialism_, p. 11.         =10. Atheism, a Fatal Belief.=--\"During the Reign of Terror, the       French were declared by the National Assembly to be a nation of       atheists; but a brief experience convinced them that a nation of       atheists could not long exist. Robespierre then 'proclaimed in       the convention, that belief in the existence of God was necessary       to those principles of virtue and morality upon which the       republic was founded; and on the 7th of May, the national       representatives, who had so lately prostrated themselves before       the Goddess of Reason, voted by acclamation that the French       people acknowledged the existence of the Supreme Being, and the       immortality of the soul.'\"--_Students' France, xxvii, 6_; quoted       by Rev. Charles E. Little, in _Historical Lights_, pp. 280-281.         =11. The Trinity.=--\"'Mormonism' affirms its unqualified belief       in the Godhead as the Holy Trinity, comprising Father, Son, and       Holy Ghost; each of the three a separate and individual       personage; the Father and the Son each a personage of spirit and       of immortalized body; the Holy Ghost a personage of spirit. The       unity of the Godhead is accepted in the literal fulness of       scriptural declaration--that the Three are one in purpose, plan,       and method; alike in all their Godly attributes; one in their       Divine omniscience and omnipotence; yet as separate and distinct       in their personality as are any three inhabitants of earth.       'Mormonism' claims that scripture passages declaring the oneness       of the Trinity admit of this interpretation; that such indeed is       the natural interpretation, and that the conception is in accord       with reason.\"--_The Philosophy of \"Mormonism_,\" by The Author:       Improvement Era, vol. iv, p. 463.         =12. The Father and the Son.=--In the treatment of the       \"Personality of Each Member of the Godhead\" (p. 41) and \"Divine       Attributes\" (p. 42) no attempt has been made to segregate the       references made to The Father and to The Son. It is to be       remembered that the Personage most generally designated in the       Old Testament as God or the LORD, is He who in the mortal state       was known as Jesus Christ, and in the antemortal state as       Jehovah. See the author's work, \"Jesus the Christ,\" chap. iv.       That Jesus Christ or Jehovah is designated in certain scriptures       as the Father in no wise justifies an assumption of identity       between Him and His Father, Elohim. This matter has been       explained in a publication dated June 30, 1916, entitled \"The       Father and The Son; a Doctrinal Exposition by the First       Presidency and the Twelve.\" This appeared in _Improvement Era_,       August, 1916, and in a pamphlet of earlier issue. Excerpts       therefrom follow: \"The term 'Father' as applied to Deity occurs       in sacred writ with plainly different"]]]
