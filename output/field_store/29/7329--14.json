[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31511"],[0,"A History of Witchcraft in England from 1558 to 1718 (#14)"],[1," Scot by his  assault all along the front forced the enemy's advance and in some sense  dictated his line of battle.    The assault was directed indeed against the centre of the opposing  entrenchments, the belief in the continuance of miracles. Scot declared  that with Christ and his apostles the age of miracles had passed, an  opinion which he supported by the authority of Calvin and of St.  Augustine. What was counted the supernatural assumed two forms--the  phenomena exhibited by those whom he classed under the wide term of  \"couseners,\" and the phenomena said to be exhibited by the \"poor doting  women\" known as witches. The tricks and deceits of the \"couseners\" he  was at great pains to explain. Not less than one-third of his work is  given up to setting forth the methods of conjurers, card tricks,  sleight-of-hand performances, illusions of magic, materializations of  spirits, and the wonders of alchemy and astrology. In the range of his  information about these subjects, the discoverer was encyclopedic. No  current form of dabbling with the supernatural was left unexposed.    In his attack upon the phenomena of witchcraft he had a different  problem. He had to deal with phenomena the so-called facts of which were  not susceptible of any material explanation. The theory of a Devil who  had intimate relations with human beings, who controlled them and sent  them out upon maleficent errands, was in its essence a theological  conception and could not be absolutely disproved by scientific  observation. It was necessary instead to attack the idea on its _a  priori_ grounds. This attack Scot attempted to base on the nature of  spirits. Spirits and bodies, he urged, are antithetical and  inconvertible, nor can any one save God give spirit a bodily form. The  Devil, a something beyond our comprehension, cannot change spirit into  body, nor can he himself assume a bodily form, nor has he any power save  that granted him by God for vengeance. This being true, the whole  belief in the Devil's intercourse with witches is undermined. Such, very  briefly, were the philosophic bases of Scot's skepticism. Yet the more  cogent parts of his work were those in which he denied the validity of  any evidence so far offered for the existence of witches. What is  witchcraft? he asked; and his answer is worth quoting. \"Witchcraft is in  truth a cousening art, wherin the name of God is abused, prophaned and  blasphemed, and his power attributed to a vile creature. In estimation  of the vulgar people, it is a supernaturall worke, contrived betweene a  corporall old woman, and a spirituall divell. The maner thereof is so  secret, mysticall, and strange, that to this daie there hath never beene  any credible witnes thereof.\"[19] The want of credible evidence was  indeed a point upon which Scot continually insisted with great force. He  pictured vividly the course which a witchcraft case often ran: \"One sort  of such as are said to bee witches are women which be commonly old,  lame, bleare-eied, pale, fowle, and full of wrinkles; ... they are leane  and deformed, shewing melancholie in their faces; ... they are doting,  scolds, mad, divelish.... These miserable wretches are so odious unto  all their neighbors, and so feared, as few dare offend them, or denie  them anie thing they aske: whereby they take upon them, yea, and  sometimes thinke, that they can doo such things as are beyond the  abilitie of humane nature. These go from house to house, and from doore  to doore for a pot of milke, yest, drinke, pottage, or some such  releefe; without the which they could hardlie live.... It falleth out  many times, that neither their necessities, nor their expectation is  answered.... In tract of time the witch waxeth odious and tedious to hir  neighbors; ... she cursseth one, and sometimes another; and that from  the maister of the house, his wife, children, cattell, etc. to the  little pig that lieth in the stie.... Doubtlesse (at length) some of hir  neighbours die, or fall sicke.\"[20] Then they suspect her, says Scot,  and grow convinced that she is the author of their mishaps. \"The witch,  ... seeing things sometimes come to passe according to hir wishes, ...  being called before a Justice, ... confesseth that she hath brought such  things to passe. Wherein, not onelie she, but the accuser, and also the  Justice are fowlie deceived and abused.\"[21] Such indeed was the epitome  of many cases. The process from beginning to end was never better  described; the ease with which confessions were dragged from  weak-spirited women was never pictured more truly. With quite as keen  insight he displayed the motives that animated witnesses and described  the prejudices and fears that worked on jurors and judges. It was,  indeed, upon these factors that he rested the weight of his argument for  the negative.[22]    The affirmative opinion was grounded, he believed, upon the ignorance of  the common people, \"assotted and bewitched\" by the jesting or serious  words of poets, by the inventions of \"lowd liers and couseners,\" and by  \"tales they have heard from old doting women, or from their mother's  maids, and with whatsoever the grandfoole their ghostlie father or anie  other morrow masse preest had informed them.\"[23]    By the same method by which he opposed the belief in witchcraft he  opposed the belief in possession by an evil spirit. The known cases,  when examined, proved frauds. The instances in the New Testament he  seemed inclined to explain by the assumption that possession merely  meant disease.[24]    That Scot should maintain an absolute negative in the face of all  strange phenomena would have been too much to expect. He seems to have  believed, though not without some difficulty, that stones had in them  \"certaine proper vertues which are given them of a speciall influence of  the planets.\" The unicorn's horn, he thought, had certain curative  properties. And he had heard \"by credible report\" and the affirmation of  \"many grave authors\" that \"the wound of a man murthered reneweth  bleeding at the presence of a deere freend, or of a mortall enimie.\"[25]    His credulity in these points may be disappointing to the reader who  hopes to find in Scot a scientific rationalist. That, of course, he was  not; and his leaning towards superstition on these points makes one ask,  What did he really believe about witchcraft? When all the fraud and  false testimony and self-deception were excluded, what about the  remaining cases of witchcraft? Scot was very careful never to deny _in  toto_ the existence of witches. That would have been to deny the Bible.  What were these witches, then? Doubtless he would have answered that he  had already classified them under two heads: they were either  \"couseners\" or \"poor doting women\"--and by \"couseners\" he seems to have  meant those who used trickery and fraud. In other words, Scot distinctly  implied that there were no real witches--with powers given them by the  Devil. Would he have stood by this when pushed into a corner? It is just  possible that he would have done so, that he understood his own  implications, but hardly dared to utter a straighforward denial of the  reality of witchcraft. It is more likely that he had not altogether  thought himself out.    The immediate impression of Scot's book we know little about. Such  contemporary comment as we have is neutral.[26] That his book was read  painstakingly by every later writer on the subject, that it shortly  became the great support of one party in the controversy, that King  James deemed it worth while to write an answer, and that on his  accession to the throne he almost certainly ordered the book to be  burned by the common hangman,[27] these are better evidence than  absolutely contemporary notices to show that the _Discoverie_ exerted an  influence.    We cannot better suggest how radical Scot's position must have seemed to  his own time than by showing the point of view of another opponent of  witchcraft, George Gifford, a non-conformist clergyman.[28] He had read  the _Discoverie_ and probably felt that the theological aspect of the  subject had been neglected. Moreover it had probably been his fortune,  as Scot's, to attend the St. Oses trials. Three years after Scot's book  he brought out _A Discourse of the Subtill Practises of Devilles by  Witches_, and followed it six years later by _A Dialogue concerning  Witches_,[29] a book in which he expounded his opinions in somewhat more  popular fashion. Like Scot, he wrote to end, so far as possible, the  punishment of innocent women;[30] like Scot, he believed that most of  the evidence presented against them was worthless.[31] But on other  points he was far less radical. There were witches. He found them in  the Bible.[32] To be sure they were nothing more than pawns for the  Devil. He uses them \"onely for a colour,\"[33] that is, puts them forward  to cover his own dealings, and then he deludes them and makes them  \"beleeve things which are nothing so.\"[34] In consequence they  frequently at their executions falsely accuse others of dreadful  witchcrafts. It is all the work of the Devil. But he himself cannot do  anything except through the power of God,[35] who, sometimes for  vengeance upon His enemies and sometimes to try His own people,[36]  permits the Evil One to do harm.[37]    Gifford of course never made the impression that Scot had made.[38] But  he represented the more conservative position and was the first in a  long line of writers who deprecated persecution while they accepted the  current view as to witchcraft; and therefore he furnishes a standard by  which to measure Scot, who had nothing of the conservative about him.  Scot had many readers and exerted a strong influence even upon those who  disagreed with him; but he had few or none to follow in his steps. It  was not until nearly a century later that there came upon the scene a  man who dared to speak as Scot had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31529"],[0,"Modern marriage and how to bear it (#14)"],[1,"passions which disturb the union of    the sexes, is the liberty of breaking up conjugal ties and forming    them again.'  --GEORGE SAND.      'Until the marriage tie is made more flexible, marriage will always    be a risk, which men particularly will undertake with misgiving.'      --H. B. MARRIOTT-WATSON.            I      LEASEHOLD MARRIAGE A LA MEREDITH      'Twenty years of Romance make a woman look like a wreck; twenty    years of Marriage make her look like a public building.'      --OSCAR WILDE.      Leasehold marriage was one of the customs of early Roman society.  Nowadays it has a revolutionary savour, and is so apparently  impracticable that it would be hardly necessary to do more than touch  upon it here, but for the fact that its most recent and most  distinguished advocate in modern times is Mr George Meredith. Any  suggestion from such a source must necessarily receive careful  consideration. It was also advanced by the great philosopher Locke,  and was considered by Milton.    It is scarcely three years since our veteran novelist cast this  bombshell into a delighted, albeit disapproving Press; but as memories  are so short nowadays, perhaps a brief recapitulation of the  circumstances might not be amiss.    The beginning of the business was a letter to _The Times_ by Mr  Cloudesly Brereton complaining of the 'growing handicap of marriage'  and, according to invariable custom, attacking women as the cause of it.  He stated that in the middle classes 'the exigences of modern wives are  steadily undermining the attractions of matrimony; in her ever-growing  demands on her husband's time, energy, and money the modern married  woman constitutes a very serious drag, and in the lower classes of  society, marriage even seriously militates against a man's finding  work.' How women can be held responsible for this last injustice was  wisely not stated. It would have been difficult to prove the indictment,  I think.    This document's chief claim to interest was the discussion in _The Daily  Mail_ that followed it, and the curious fact that the writer was married  a few weeks after its publication! The usual abuse on marriage in  general and women in particular followed, until the late Mrs Craigie  joined the discussion, and brought to bear on it that peculiar quality  of tender understanding, that wonderful insight into women's hearts,  which were among the most striking characteristics of her brilliant  work. It would be a pity to quote from such a letter, so I reproduce it  in full.    'Women, where their feelings are in question, are not selfish enough:  they appraise themselves not too dearly, but too cheaply: it is the  suicidal unselfishness of modern women which makes the selfishness of  modern bachelors possible. Bachelors are not all misogynists, and the  fact that a man remains unmarried is no proof that he is insensible to  the charm of woman's companionship, or that he does not have such  companionship, on irresponsible terms, to a most considerable degree.  Why should the average vain young man, egoistic by organism and  education, work hard or make sacrifices for the sake of any particular  woman, while so many are too willing to share his life without joining  it, and so many more wait eagerly on his steps to destroy any chivalry  or tenderness he may have been born with? Modern women give bachelors no  time to miss them and no opportunity to need them. Their devotion is  undisciplined and it becomes a curse rather than a blessing to its  object. Why? Because women have this strange power of concentration and  self-abnegation in their love; they cannot do enough to prove their  kindness; and when they have done all and been at no pains to secure  their own position, they realise they have erred through excess of  generosity and the desire to please. This is the unselfishness shown  towards bachelors.'    In answer to this letter, another woman novelist, Miss Florence Warden,  challenged Mrs Craigie as to the existence of such women, but elicited  no further reply. _The Daily Mail_ commented on it thus: 'Hundreds of  thousands of our readers can give an answer to this remarkable statement  out of their own experience, and we have little doubt as to what the  tenor of that answer will be.' One can imagine that this was written  with a view to being read at the breakfast-tables of Villadom; but men  and women of the world, whose experience is not confined to Villadom,  nor their opinions of life coloured by the requirements of the Young  Person, will recognise the undoubted truth of Mrs Craigie's statements.  Whilst agreeing that the state of things between the sexes which she  describes is a true one, I venture respectfully to differ as to women's  motive for this 'excess of generosity.' There is an enormous amount of  wonderful unselfishness among women, but it does not expend itself in  this direction, in my opinion. Rather is the motive a passionate desire  for their own enjoyment, the gratification of their own vanity by  pleasing the opposite sex, often at the cost of their own self-respect.  H. B. Marriott-Watson takes the same view in a subsequent letter, where  he says: 'Women's unselfishness does not extend to the region of love.  The sex attraction is practically inconsistent with altruism, and the  measure of renunciation is inversely the measure of affection. This is  the order which Nature has established, and it is no use trying to expel  her. A woman may lay down her life for the man she loves, but she will  not surrender him to a rival.'    Another letter of interest came from Miss Helen Mathers, who stated that  'all women should marry, but no men!'--the advantages of the conjugal  state being, in her opinion, entirely on the woman's side.    At this point appeared Mr Meredith's contribution to the discussion in  the less authoritative form of an interview--not a letter or article,  as, after this lapse of time, so many people seem to imagine. On  re-reading this interview recently, I was struck with Mr Meredith's  peculiarly old-fashioned ideas about women. Where the woman question  was concerned the clock of his observation seems to have stopped many  decades ago.    'The fault at the bottom of the business,' he affirms, 'is that women  are so uneducated, so unready. Men too often want a slave, and  frequently think they have got one, not because the woman has not often  got more sense than her husband, but because she is so inarticulate, not  educated enough to give expression to her real ideas and feelings.'    This was before the vogue of the suffragettes, but it is a sufficiently  surprising statement for 1904. He continues: 'It is a question to my  mind whether a young girl, married, say, at eighteen, utterly ignorant  of life, knowing little of the man she is marrying, or of any other man  in the world at all, should be condemned to live with him for the rest  of her life. She falls out of sympathy with him, say, has no common  taste with him, nothing to share with him, no real communion except a  physical one. The life is nearly intolerable, yet many women go on with  it from habit, or because the world terrorises them.'    This is true enough, but Mr Meredith speaks as if it were still the  rule, as in our grandmothers' day, for a girl to marry in the teens,  whereas it is now quite the exception. Every year the marrying age seems  to advance, and blushing brides decked in orange blossoms are led to the  altar at an age when, fifty years ago, they would be resigned old maids  in cap and mittens. If a girl is foolish enough to marry immediately she  is out of the schoolroom, she must be prepared to take the enormous risk  which the choice of a husband at such an immature age must entail.    Elsewhere Mr Meredith says: 'Marriage is so difficult, its modern  conditions are so difficult, that when two educated people want it,  nothing should be put in their way. . . . Certainly one day the present  conditions of marriage will be changed. It will be allowed for a certain  period, say ten years, or--well, I do not want to specify any particular  period. The State will see sufficient money is put by to provide for and  educate the children. Perhaps the State will take charge of this fund.  There will be a devil of an uproar before such a change can be made. It  will be a great shock, but look back and see what shocks there have been  and what changes have nevertheless taken place in this marriage business  in the past.'    'The difficulty,' he continues, 'is to make English people face such a  problem. They want to live under discipline more than any other nation  in the world. They won't look ahead, especially the governing people.  And you must have philosophy, though it is more than you can hope to get  English people to admit the bare name of philosophy into their  discussion of such a question. Again and again, notably in their  criticism of America, you see how English people will persist in  regarding any new trait as a sign of disease. Yet it is a sign of  health.'    It will be seen that Mr Meredith puts forward the ten-year limit merely  as a suggestion. I recall in one of Stevenson's essays an allusion to a  lady who said: 'After ten years one's husband is at least an old  friend,' and her answer was: 'Yes, and one would like him to be that and  nothing more.' The decade seems to have a special significance in  marriage. After the trying first year is over, most couples settle down  comfortably enough until nearing the tenth year. The president of the  Divorce Court has called this the danger zone of married life. One of  the subsequent letters in _The Daily Mail_, approving Mr Meredith's  suggestion, alluded to the present form of marriage as 'the  life-sentence,' and suggested a still shorter time limit, five years for  choice, since during that time a couple would have found happiness or  the reverse, and in the latter case ten years was too"]]]
