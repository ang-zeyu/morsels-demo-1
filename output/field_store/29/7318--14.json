Even in the drier  part of the year when some of the leaves have fallen, the rays of the  sun scarcely reach the ground until nine or ten o'clock in the morning.  Even at high noon the sunlight straggles through only in small patches.  Long, sinuous lianas, often queerly braided, hang down from the trees;  epiphytes and various parasitic growths add their strange green and red  to the complex variety of vegetation. Young palms grow up almost in  a day and block a trail which was hewn out with much labor only a few  months before. Wherever the death of old trees forms an opening, a  thousand seedlings begin a fierce race to reach the light. Everywhere  the dominant note is intensely vigorous life, rapid growth, and quick  decay.    In their effect on man, the three forms of tropical forest are very  different. In the genuine rain forest agriculture is almost impossible.  Not only does the poor native find himself baffled in the face of  Nature, but the white man is equally at a loss. Many things combine to  produce this result. Chief among them are malaria and other tropical  diseases. When a few miles of railroad were being built through a  strip of tropical forest along the coast of eastern Guatemala, it was  impossible to keep the laborers more than twenty days at a time; indeed,  unless they were sent away at the end of three weeks, they were almost  sure to be stricken with virulent malarial fevers from which many died.  An equally potent enemy of agriculture is the vegetation itself. Imagine  the difficulty of cultivating a garden in a place where the weeds grow  all the time and where many of them reach a height of ten or twenty  feet in a single year. Perhaps there are people in the world who might  cultivate such a region and raise marvelous crops, but they are not the  indolent people of tropical America; and it is in fact doubtful whether  any kind of people could live permanently in the tropical forest and  retain energy enough to carry on cultivation. Nowhere in the world is  there such steady, damp heat as in these shadowy, windless depths  far below the lofty tops of the rain forest. Nowhere is there greater  disinclination to work than among the people who dwell in this region.  Consequently in the vast rain forests of the Amazon basin and in  similar small forests as far north as Central America, there are today  practically no inhabitants except a mere handful of the poorest and most  degraded people in the world. Yet in ancient times the northern border  of the rain forest was the seat of America's most advanced civilization.  The explanation of this contradiction will appear later. *          * See Chapter 5, Aztecs.      Tropical jungle borders the rain forest all the way from southern Mexico  to southern Brazil. It treats man far better than does the rain forest.  In marked contrast to its more stately neighbor, it contains abundant  game. Wild fruits ripen at almost all seasons. A few banana plants and  palm trees will well-nigh support a family. If corn is planted in a  clearing, the return is large in proportion to the labor. So long as  the population is not too dense, life is so easy that there is little to  stimulate progress. Hence, although the people of the jungle are  fairly numerous, they have never played much part in history. Far more  important is the role of those living in the tropical lands where scrub  is the prevailing growth. In our day, for example, few tropical lowlands  are more progressive than the narrow coastal strip of northern Yucatan.  There on the border between jungle and scrub the vegetation does not  thrive sufficiently to make life easy for the chocolate-colored natives.  Effort is required if they would make a living, yet the effort is not  so great as to be beyond the capacity of the indolent people of the  tropics.    Leaving the forests, let us step out into the broad, breezy grass-lands.  One would scarcely expect that a journey poleward out of the forest of  northern Canada would lead to an improvement in the conditions of human  life, yet such is the case. Where the growing season becomes so short  that even the hardiest trees disappear, grassy tundras replace the  forest. By furnishing food for such animals as the musk-ox, they are a  great help to the handful of scattered Indians who dwell on the northern  edge of the forest. In summer, when the animals grow fat on the short  nutritious grass, the Indians follow them out into the open country and  hunt them vigorously for food and skins to sustain life through the long  dreary winter. In many cases the hunters would advance much farther into  the grass-lands were it not that the abundant musk-oxen tempt the Eskimo  of the seacoast also to leave their homes and both sides fear bloody  encounters.    With the growth of civilization the advantage of the northern  grass-lands over the northern forests becomes still more apparent. The  domestic reindeer is beginning to replace the wild musk-ox. The  reindeer people, like the Indian and Eskimo hunters, must be nomadic.  Nevertheless their mode of life permits them to live in much greater  numbers and on a much higher plane of civilization than the hunters.  Since they hunt the furbearing animals in the neighboring forests during  the winter, they diminish the food supply of the hunters who dwell  permanently in the forest, and thus make their life still more  difficult. The northern forests bid fair to decline in population rather  than increase. In this New World of ours, strange as it may seem, the  almost uninhabited forest regions of the far north and of the equator  are probably more than twice as large as the desert areas with equally  sparse population.    South of the tundras the grass-lands have a still greater advantage over  the forests. In the forest region of the Laurentian highland abundant  snow lasts far into the spring and keeps the ground so wet and cold that  no crops can be raised. Moreover, because of the still greater abundance  of snow in former times, the largest of ice sheets, as we have seen,  accumulated there during the Glacial Period and scraped away most of  the soil. The grassy plains, on the contrary, are favored not only by  a deep, rich soil, much of which was laid down by the ice, but by the  relative absence of snow in winter and the consequent rapidity with  which the ground becomes warm in the spring. Hence the Canadian plains  from the United States boundary northward to latitude 57 degrees contain  a prosperous agricultural population of over a million people, while  the far larger forested areas in the same latitude support only a few  thousand.    The question is often asked why, in a state of nature, trees are so  scarce on the prairies--in Iowa, for instance--although they thrive  when planted. In answer we are often told that up to the middle of the  nineteenth century such vast herds of buffaloes roamed the prairies that  seedling trees could never get a chance to grow. It is also said that  prairie fires sweeping across the plains destroyed the little trees  whenever they sprouted. Doubtless the buffaloes and the fires helped  to prevent forest growth, but another factor appears to be still more  important. All the States between the Mississippi River and the Rocky  Mountains receive much more rain in summer than in winter. But as the  soil is comparatively dry in the spring when the trees begin their  growth, they are handicapped. They could grow if nothing else interfered  with them, just as peas will grow in a garden if the weeds are kept out.  If peas, however, are left uncared for, the weeds gain the upper hand  and there are no peas the second year. If the weeds are left to contend  with grass, the grass in the end prevails. In the eastern forest region,  if the grass be left to itself, small trees soon spring up in its midst.  In half a century a field of grass goes back to forest because trees  are especially favored by the climate. In the same way in the prairies,  grass is especially favored, for it is not weakened by the spring  drought, and it grows abundantly until it forms the wonderful stretches  of waving green where the buffalo once grew fat. Moreover the fine  glacial soil of the prairies is so clayey and compact that the roots of  trees cannot easily penetrate it. Since grasses send their roots only  into the more friable upper layers of soil, they possess another great  advantage over the trees.    Far to the south of the prairies lie the grass-lands of tropical  America, of which the Banos of the Orinoco furnish a good example.  Almost everywhere their plumed grasses have been left to grow  undisturbed by the plough, and even grazing animals are scarce. These  extremely flat plains are flooded for months in the rainy season from  May to October and are parched in the dry season that follows. As  trees cannot endure such extremes, grasses are the prevailing growth.  Elsewhere the nature of the soil causes many other grassy tracts to  be scattered among the tropical jungle and forest. Trees are at a  disadvantage both in porous, sandy soils, where the water drains away  too rapidly, and in clayey soil, where it is held so long that the  ground is saturated for weeks or months at a time. South of the tropical  portion of South America the vast pampas of Argentina closely resemble  the North American prairies and the drier plains to the west of  them. Grain in the east and cattle in the west are fast causing the  disappearance of those great tussocks of tufted grasses eight or nine  feet high which hold among grasses a position analogous to that of the  Big Trees of California among trees of lower growth.    It is often said that America has no real deserts. This is true in the  sense that there are no regions such as are found in Asia and Africa  where one can travel a hundred miles at a stretch and scarcely see a  sign of vegetation-nothing but barren gravel,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3069"],[0,"The Great Boer War (#14)"],[1,"dians,  there came offers of service. But this was to be a white man's war, and  if the British could not work out their own salvation then it were well  that empire should pass from such a race. The magnificent Indian army  of 150,000 soldiers, many of them seasoned veterans, was for the same  reason left untouched. England has claimed no credit or consideration  for such abstention, but an irresponsible writer may well ask how many  of those foreign critics whose respect for our public morality appears  to be as limited as their knowledge of our principles and history would  have advocated such self denial had their own countries been placed in  the same position.    On September 18th the official reply of the Boer Government to the  message sent from the Cabinet Council was published in London. In manner  it was unbending and unconciliatory; in substance, it was a complete  rejection of all the British demands. It refused to recommend or propose  to the Raad the five years' franchise and the other measures which had  been defined as the minimum which the Home Government could accept as a  fair measure of justice towards the Uitlanders. The suggestion that the  debates of the Raad should be bilingual, as they have been in the  Cape Colony and in Canada, was absolutely waived aside. The British  Government had stated in their last dispatch that if the reply should  be negative or inconclusive they reserved to themselves the right to  'reconsider the situation de novo and to formulate their own proposals  for a final settlement.' The reply had been both negative and  inconclusive, and on September 22nd a council met to determine what the  next message should be. It was short and firm, but so planned as not to  shut the door upon peace. Its purport was that the British Government  expressed deep regret at the rejection of the moderate proposals which  had been submitted in their last dispatch, and that now, in accordance  with their promise, they would shortly put forward their own plans for  a settlement. The message was not an ultimatum, but it foreshadowed an  ultimatum in the future.    In the meantime, upon September 21st the Raad of the Orange Free State  had met, and it became more and more evident that this republic, with  whom we had no possible quarrel, but, on the contrary, for whom we had a  great deal of friendship and admiration, intended to throw in its weight  against Great Britain. Some time before, an offensive and defensive  alliance had been concluded between the two States, which must, until  the secret history of these events comes to be written, appear to have  been a singularly rash and unprofitable bargain for the smaller one. She  had nothing to fear from Great Britain, since she had been voluntarily  turned into an independent republic by her and had lived in peace with  her for forty years. Her laws were as liberal as our own. But by this  suicidal treaty she agreed to share the fortunes of a State which was  deliberately courting war by its persistently unfriendly attitude, and  whose reactionary and narrow legislation would, one might imagine, have  alienated the sympathy of her progressive neighbour. There may have  been ambitions like those already quoted from the report of Dr. Reitz's  conversation, or there may have been a complete hallucination as to the  comparative strength of the two combatants and the probable future of  South Africa; but however that may be, the treaty was made, and the time  had come to test how far it would hold.    The tone of President Steyn at the meeting of the Raad, and the support  which he received from the majority of his burghers, showed unmistakably  that the two republics would act as one. In his opening speech Steyn  declared uncompromisingly against the British contention, and declared  that his State was bound to the Transvaal by everything which was near  and dear. Among the obvious military precautions which could no longer  be neglected by the British Government was the sending of some small  force to protect the long and exposed line of railway which lies just  outside the Transvaal border from Kimberley to Rhodesia. Sir Alfred  Milner communicated with President Steyn as to this movement of troops,  pointing out that it was in no way directed against the Free State. Sir  Alfred Milner added that the Imperial Government was still hopeful of  a friendly settlement with the Transvaal, but if this hope were  disappointed they looked to the Orange Free State to preserve strict  neutrality and to prevent military intervention by any of its citizens.  They undertook that in that case the integrity of the Free State  frontier would be strictly preserved. Finally, he stated that there was  absolutely no cause to disturb the good relations between the Free  State and Great Britain, since we were animated by the most friendly  intentions towards them. To this the President returned a somewhat  ungracious answer, to the effect that he disapproved of our action  towards the Transvaal, and that he regretted the movement of troops,  which would be considered a menace by the burghers. A subsequent  resolution of the Free State Raad, ending with the words, 'Come what  may, the Free State will honestly and faithfully fulfill its obligations  towards the Transvaal by virtue of the political alliance existing  between the two republics,' showed how impossible it was that this  country, formed by ourselves and without a shadow of a cause of quarrel  with us, could be saved from being drawn into the whirlpool. Everywhere,  from over both borders, came the news of martial preparations. Already  at the end of September troops and armed burghers were gathering  upon the frontier, and the most incredulous were beginning at last to  understand that the shadow of a great war was really falling across  them. Artillery, war munitions, and stores were being accumulated  at Volksrust upon the Natal border, showing where the storm might be  expected to break. On the last day of September, twenty-six military  trains were reported to have left Pretoria and Johannesburg for that  point. At the same time news came of a concentration at Malmani, upon  the Bechuanaland border, threatening the railway line and the British  town of Mafeking, a name destined before long to be familiar to the  world.    On October 3rd there occurred what was in truth an act of war, although  the British Government, patient to the verge of weakness, refused to  regard it as such, and continued to draw up their final state paper. The  mail train from the Transvaal to Cape Town was stopped at Vereeniging,  and the week's shipment of gold for England, amounting to about half a  million pounds, was taken by the Boer Government. In a debate at Cape  Town upon the same day the Africander Minister of the Interior admitted  that as many as 404 trucks had passed from the Government line over  the frontier and had not been returned. Taken in conjunction with  the passage of arms and cartridges through the Cape to Pretoria and  Bloemfontein, this incident aroused the deepest indignation among the  Colonial English and the British public, which was increased by the  reports of the difficulty which border towns, such as Kimberley and  Vryburg, had had in getting cannon for their own defence. The Raads had  been dissolved, and the old President's last words had been a statement  that war was certain, and a stern invocation of the Lord as final  arbiter. England was ready less obtrusively but no less heartily to  refer the quarrel to the same dread Judge.    On October 2nd President Steyn informed Sir Alfred Milner that he had  deemed it necessary to call out the Free State burghers--that is, to  mobilise his forces. Sir A. Milner wrote regretting these preparations,  and declaring that he did not yet despair of peace, for he was sure that  any reasonable proposal would be favourably considered by her Majesty's  Government. Steyn's reply was that there was no use in negotiating  unless the stream of British reinforcements ceased coming into South  Africa. As our forces were still in a great minority, it was impossible  to stop the reinforcements, so the correspondence led to nothing. On  October 7th the army reserves for the First Army Corps were called out  in Great Britain and other signs shown that it had been determined to  send a considerable force to South Africa. Parliament was also summoned  that the formal national assent might be gained for those grave measures  which were evidently pending.    It was on October 9th that the somewhat leisurely proceedings of the  British Colonial Office were brought to a head by the arrival of an  unexpected and audacious ultimatum from the Boer Government. In contests  of wit, as of arms, it must be confessed that the laugh has been usually  upon the side of our simple and pastoral South African neighbours. The  present instance was no exception to the rule. While our Government  was cautiously and patiently leading up to an ultimatum, our opponent  suddenly played the very card which we were preparing to lay upon the  table. The document was very firm and explicit, but the terms in which  it was drawn were so impossible that it was evidently framed with the  deliberate purpose of forcing an immediate war. It demanded that the  troops upon the borders of the republic should be instantly withdrawn,  that all reinforcements which had arrived within the last year should  leave South Africa, and that those who were now upon the sea should be  sent back without being landed. Failing a satisfactory answer within  forty-eight hours, 'the Transvaal Government will with great regret be  compelled to regard the action of her Majesty's Government as a formal  declaration of war, for the consequences of which it will not hold  itself responsible.' The audacious message was received throughout the  empire with a mixture of derision and anger. The answer was dispatched  next"]]]
