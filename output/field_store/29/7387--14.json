She took a hundred pounds of wool to spin  on shares, which, with the assistance of a girl, she spun, in order to  furnish clothing for those engaged in building the temple; and  although she had the privilege of keeping half the quantity of wool  for herself, as a recompense for her labor, she did not reserve even  so much as would make a pair of stockings, but gave it for those who  were laboring at the house of the Lord. She spun and wove, and got the  cloth dressed and cut and made up into garments, and gave them to the  laborers on the temple. Almost all the sisters in Kirtland labored in  knitting, sewing, spinning, etc., for the same purpose; while we went  up to Missouri to endeavor to reinstate our brethren on the lands from  which they had been driven.    \"Elder Rigdon, when addressing the brethren upon the importance of  building this house, spake to this effect: That we should use every  effort to accomplish this building by the time appointed; if we did  the Lord would accept it at our hands; and on it depends the salvation  of the Church, and also of the world. Looking at the sufferings and  poverty of the Church, he frequently went upon the walls of the  building, both by night and day, and wept, crying aloud to the  Almighty to send means whereby we might accomplish the building.    \"After we returned from our journey to the West, the whole Church  united in this great undertaking, and every man lent a helping hand.  Those who had not teams went to work in the stone quarry and prepared  the stones for drawing to the house.    \"The Prophet, being our foreman, would put on his tow frock and tow  pantaloons and go into the quarry. The Presidency, High Priests and  Elders all alike assisting. Those who had teams assisted in drawing  the stone to the house. These all laboring one day in the week,  brought as many stones to the house as supplied the masons through the  whole week. We continued in this manner until the walls of the house  were reared. The committee who were appointed by revelation to  superintend the building were Hyrum Smith, Reynolds Cahoon and Jared  Carter. They used every exertion in their power to forward the work.\"    During the winter of 1834-5, Heber attended the theological school  established in Kirtland. Here originated the lectures on faith,  contained in the book of Doctrine and Covenants. It was the custom, at  these meetings, to call upon a certain number to speak for the  edification of the others. Heber, on one occasion, was invited to  address them on the subject of faith. Every passage of scripture  bearing on the theme having been quoted by previous speakers, and not  wishing to repeat what they had said, he was left to depend entirely  upon the Spirit. He began by relating the following anecdote, the  incident of which had occurred in his own family:    \"My wife, one day, when going out on a visit, gave my daughter Helen  Mar charge not to touch the dishes, for if she broke any during her  absence she would give her a whipping when she returned. While my wife  was absent my daughter broke a number of the dishes by letting the  table leaf fall, and then she went out under an apple tree and prayed  that her mother's heart might be softened, that when she returned she  might not whip her. Her mother was very punctual when she made a  promise to her children, to fulfill it, and when she returned she  undertook, as a duty, to carry this promise into effect. She retired  with her into her room, but found herself powerless to chastise her;  her heart was so softened that it was impossible for her to raise her  hand against the child. Afterwards, Helen told her mother she had  prayed to the Lord that she might not whip her.\"    Heber paused in his simple narrative. Tears glistened in the eyes of  his hearers; the Prophet Joseph was weeping like a child. He told the  brethren that that was the kind of faith they needed; the faith of a  little child, going in humility to its Parent, and asking for the  desire of its heart. He said the anecdote was well-timed.    A grammar school was opened in Kirtland the same winter, taught by  Sidney Rigdon and William E. McLellin. Most of the Elders, including  the Prophet, attended this school. Some of them were very apt pupils  and made rapid headway. Heber's progress, however, was only moderate.  Grammar, as a study, afforded him little delight. The mysteries of  syntax seemed to elude his mental grasp, as the will-o'-the-wisp the  eye and hand of its pursuer. A lover of choice language, and, when  loftily inspired, a user of much that was beautiful and sublime; a  never-failing fountain of poetic thought and imagery; the  technicalities of his mother tongue nevertheless seemed to baffle him.  His forte lay elsewhere. He was a philosopher, rather than an orator.  Many excelled him in speaking, but few, as thinkers, were his equals.  If, in the gift of speech, the power of expression, he fell below many  of his confreres, he had thoughts, ideas, inspirations, toward which,  as eagles toward the sun, their loftiest oratory soared in vain. His  words, though humble, were as sparks of prophecy from the Spirit's  flaming forge; his inspired utterances, casual as they sometimes  seemed, were like oracles and decrees of fate.    \"I used to tell Brother Heber I never wanted him to say anything but  good of me,\" an Apostle once remarked, significantly, in the hearing  of the writer.    Some six weeks after the establishment of the grammar school, a  meeting of the Camp of Zion was called to assemble, to receive what  was termed \"a Zion's blessing.\" At this meeting it was announced by  the Prophet that \"those who went to Zion with a determination to lay  down their lives, if necessary, it was the will of God that they  should be ordained to the ministry and go forth to prune the vineyard  for the last time, or the coming of the Lord, which was nigh--even  fifty-six years should wind up the scene.\"    Foremost of these evangelists, were to be chosen twelve men, to be  known as the Twelve Apostles.    The calling of the Twelve had been revealed to Joseph as early as  June, 1829. In the same revelation it was given to Oliver Cowdery and  David Whitmer--whose calling, the Lord said, was the same as that of  the Apostle Paul--to \"search out the Twelve,\" and make known to them  their mission.    Little thought Heber that he was to be one of them, and would live to  make his name illustrious as a bearer of glad tidings to the nations.  It is doubtful that he even knew, at that time, of the intention to  choose the Apostles. The revelations were not published then, as now,  and few had access to the manuscripts in those early days.    The day set for the choosing of the Twelve was Saturday, February  14th, 1835. The meeting having been duly organized, an expression was  taken whereby the Elders present signified their willingness and  \"anxious desire\" to have the Spirit of the Lord dictate in the choice  of the Apostles. The three witnesses--Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer  and Martin Harris, each in turn then offered prayer. They were blessed  under the hands of the First Presidency, and then proceeded to call  forth the Twelve.    The first three chosen were Lyman E. Johnson, Brigham Young and Heber  C. Kimball. They were called into the stand, and, after expressing  themselves in relation to the holy calling about to be conferred upon  them, were ordained under the hands of the First Presidency and the  Three Witnesses. \"These brethren,\" says Heber, \"ordained us to the  Apostleship.\" Here is a copy of his ordination blessing:        \"Heber C. Kimball shall be made like unto those who have been      blessed before him, and he shall be favored with the same      blessing; that he may receive visions, the ministration of angels,      and hear their voices, and even come into the presence of God.      That many millions may be converted by his instrumentality, that      angels may waft him from place to place, and that he may stand      unto the coming of our Lord; that he shall be made acquainted with      the day when Christ shall come; that he shall be made perfect in      faith; that the deaf shall hear, the lame shall walk, the blind      shall see, and greater things than these shall he do; and that he      shall have boldness of speech before the nations, and great      power.\" Etc.    The next day Orson Hyde, David W. Patten, Luke S. Johnson, William E.  McLellin, John F. Boynton and William Smith were chosen in like  manner. The remaining three of the Twelve were Parley P. Pratt, Orson  Pratt and Thomas B. Marsh, who were absent at the time of choosing.  Parley was ordained an Apostle on February 21st, Thomas B. Marsh on  the 25th or 26th of April, and Orson Pratt on the 26th of that month.    No history of this important event would be complete without the  famous \"Charge to the Twelve,\" delivered by President Oliver Cowdery.  It was as follows:        \"DEAR BRETHREN:--Previously to delivering the charge I shall read      a part of a revelation. It is known to you that previous to the      organization of this Church in 1830, the Lord gave revelations or      the Church could not have been organized.        \"The people of this Church were weak in faith compared with the      ancients. Those who embarked in this cause were desirous to know      how the work was to be conducted. They had read many things in the      Book of Mormon concerning their duty and the way the great work      ought to be done; but the minds of men are so constructed that      they will not believe without a testimony of seeing or hearing.      The Lord gave us a revelation that in process of time there should      be twelve chosen to preach His Gospel to Jew and Gentile. Our      minds have been on a constant stretch to find who these twelve      were.        \"When the time"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3534"],[0,"A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson (#14)"],[1," her, and it seemed more than probable that the remaining part would be  demolished about her head had we not interposed to pacify him. Nor would  we quit the place until his forgiveness was complete, and his good humour  restored. No sooner, however, did she find her husband's rage subsided,  than her hour of triumph commenced. The alarm and trepidation she had  manifested disappeared. Elated at his condescension, and emboldened by our  presence and the finery in which we had decked her, she in turn assumed a  haughty demeanour, refused to answer his caresses, and viewed him with a  reproaching eye. Although long absence from female society had somewhat  blunted our recollection, the conduct of Barangaroo did not appear quite  novel to us, nor was our surprise very violent at finding that it succeeded  in subduing Baneelon who, when we parted, seemed anxious only to please  her.    Thus ended a day, the events of which served to complete what an unhappy  accident had begun. From this time our intercourse with the natives,  though partially interrupted, was never broken off. We gradually continued,  henceforth, to gain knowledge of their customs and policy, the only  knowledge which can lead to a just estimate of national character.          CHAPTER X.        The arrival of the 'Supply' from Batavia; the State of the Colony in  November, 1790.      Joy sparkled in every countenance to see our old friend the 'Supply' (I  hope no reader will be so captious as to quarrel with the phrase) enter the  harbour from Batavia on the 19th of October. We had witnessed her departure  with tears; we hailed her return with transport.    Captain Ball was rather more than six months in making this voyage, and is  the first person who ever circumnavigated the continent of New Holland. On  his passage to Batavia, he had discovered several islands, which he gave  names to and, after fighting his way against adverse elements and through  unexplored dangers, safely reached his destined port. He had well stored  his little bark with every necessary and conveniency which he judged  we should first want, leaving a cargo of rice and salt provisions to be  brought on by a Dutch snow, which he had hired and freighted for the use of  the settlement. While at Batavia, the 'Supply' had lost many of her people  by sickness, and left several others in the general hospital at that place.    As the arrival of the 'Supply' naturally leads the attention from other  subjects to the state of the colony, I shall here take a review of it by  transcribing a statement drawn from actual observation soon after, exactly  as I find it written in my journal.    Cultivation, on a public scale, has for some time past been given up here,  (Sydney) the crop of last year being so miserable, as to deter from farther  experiment, in consequence of which the government-farm is abandoned,  and the people who were fixed on it have been removed. Necessary public  buildings advance fast; an excellent storehouse of large dimensions, built  of bricks and covered with tiles, is just completed; and another planned  which will shortly be begun. Other buildings, among which I heard the  governor mention an hospital and permanent barracks for the troops, may  also be expected to arise soon. Works of this nature are more expeditiously  performed than heretofore, owing, I apprehend, to the superintendants  lately arrived, who are placed over the convicts and compel them to labour.  The first difficulties of a new country being subdued may also contribute  to this comparative facility.    Vegetables are scarce, although the summer is so far advanced, owing to  want of rain. I do not think that all the showers of the last four months  put together, would make twenty-four hours rain. Our farms, what with this  and a poor soil, are in wretched condition. My winter crop of potatoes,  which I planted in days of despair (March and April last), turned out very  badly when I dug them about two months back. Wheat returned so poorly last  harvest, that very little, besides Indian corn, has been sown this year.  The governor's wound is quite healed, and he feels no inconveniency  whatever from it. With the natives we are hand and glove. They throng the  camp every day, and sometimes by their clamour and importunity for bread  and meat (of which they now all eat greedily) are become very troublesome.  God knows, we have little enough for ourselves! Full allowance (if eight  pounds of flour and either seven pounds of beef, or four pounds of pork,  served alternately, per week, without either pease, oatmeal, spirits,  butter, or cheese, can be called so) is yet kept up; but if the Dutch snow  does not arrive soon it must be shortened, as the casks in the storehouse,  I observed yesterday, are woefully decreased.    The convicts continue to behave pretty well; three only have been hanged  since the arrival of the last fleet, in the latter end of June, all of  whom were newcomers. The number of convicts here diminishes every day;  our principal efforts being wisely made at Rose Hill, where the land is  unquestionably better than about this place. Except building, sawing and  brickmaking, nothing of consequence is now carried on here. The account  which I received a few days ago from the brickmakers of their labours, was  as follows. Wheeler (one of the master brick-makers) with two tile stools  and one brick stool, was tasked to make and burn ready for use 30000 tiles  and bricks per month. He had twenty-one hands to assist him, who performed  every thing; cut wood, dug clay, etc. This continued (during the days of  distress excepted, when they did what they could) until June last. From  June, with one brick and two tile stools he has been tasked to make  40000 bricks and tiles monthly (as many of each sort as may be), having  twenty-two men and two boys to assist him, on the same terms of procuring  materials as before. They fetch the clay of which tiles are made, two  hundred yards; that for bricks is close at hand. He says that the bricks  are such as would be called in England, moderately good, and he judges they  would have fetched about 24 shillings per thousand at Kingston-upon-Thames  (where he resided) in the year 1784. Their greatest fault is being too  brittle. The tiles he thinks not so good as those made about London.  The stuff has a rotten quality, and besides wants the advantage of being  ground, in lieu of which they tread it.    King (another master bricklayer) last year, with the assistance of sixteen  men and two boys, made 11,000 bricks weekly, with two stools. During short  allowance did what he could. Resumed his old task when put again on full  allowance and had his number of assistants augmented to twenty men and two  boys, on account of the increased distance of carrying wood for the kilns.  He worked at Hammersmith, for Mr. Scot, of that place. He thinks the bricks  made here as good as those made near London, and says that in the year  1784, they would have sold for a guinea per thousand and to have picked the  kiln at thirty shillings.'    Such is my Sydney detail dated the 12th of November, 1790. Four days after  I went to Rose Hill, and wrote there the subjoined remarks.    November 16th. Got to Rose Hill in the evening. Next morning walked round  the whole of the cleared and cultivated land, with the Rev. Mr. Johnson,  who is the best farmer in the country. Edward Dod, one of the governor's  household, who conducts everything here in the agricultural line,  accompanied us part of the way, and afforded all the information he could.  He estimates the quantity of cleared and cultivated land at 200 acres. Of  these fifty-five are in wheat, barley, and a little oats, thirty in  maize, and the remainder is either just cleared of wood, or is occupied by  buildings, gardens, etc. Four enclosures of twenty acres each, are planned  for the reception of cattle, which may arrive in the colony, and two of  these are already fenced in. In the centre of them is to be erected a  house, for a person who will be fixed upon to take care of the cattle.  All these enclosures are supplied with water; and only a part of the trees  which grew in them being cut down, gives to them a very park-like and  beautiful appearance.    Our survey commenced on the north side of the river. Dod says he expects  this year's crop of wheat and barley from the fifty-five acres to yield  full 400 bushels. Appearances hitherto hardly indicate so much. He says he  finds the beginning of May the best time to sow barley,* but that it may  continue to be sown until August. That sown in May is reaped in December;  that of August in January. He sowed his wheat, part in June and part in  July. He thinks June the best time, and says that he invariably finds that  which is deepest sown, grows strongest and best, even as deep as three  inches he has put it in, and found it to answer. The wheat sown in June  is now turning yellow; that of July is more backward. He has used only the  broad-cast husbandry, and sowed two bushels per acre. The plough has never  yet been tried here; all the ground is hoed, and (as Dod confesses) very  incompetently turned up. Each convict labourer was obliged to hoe sixteen  rods a day, so that in some places the earth was but just scratched over.  The ground was left open for some months, to receive benefit from the sun  and air; and on that newly cleared the trees were burnt, and the ashes dug  in. I do not find that a succession of crops has yet been attempted; surely  it would help to meliorate and improve the soil. Dod recommends strongly  the culture of potatoes, on a large scale, and says that were they planted  even as late as January they would answer, but this I doubt. He is more  than ever of opinion that without a large supply of cattle nothing can be  done. They have not at this time either horse, cow, or sheep here. I asked  him how the stock they had was coming on. The"]]]
