Even so,  it is probably not fair to assume that this species represents a  perfect physiological match with climate over its entire distribution.  _Procyon lotor_ is, in many respects, still a forest-dwelling species,  and its ability to expand its distribution into other habitats such as  prairie and desert may well be due, in part, to its use of behavior to  take advantage of favorable microclimates in otherwise hostile  environments (Bartholomew, 1958, 1987). This feature of _Procyon  lotor's_ biology needs to be further examined.        TABLE 12.--Normalized and composite scores for selected procyonids.

[b] Value calculated for _Nasua narica_ (Table 10) and used with the        assumption that it must be similar to the value for _Nasua nasua_.      All five species with low [.H]_{b}'s have composite scores less than  1.0 (Table 12; Figure 8). Four of these five, _Nasua nasua_, _Nasua  narica_, _Procyon cancrivorus_, and _Potos flavus_, have  H_{br}/C_{mwr} ratios that are 0.6 or less, which indicates they are  the least cold-tolerant procyonids (McNab, 1966). These four species  also are confined to either tropic, or tropic and subtropic climates  (Table 11). This suggests that these species share a common  thermoregulatory adaptation that represents a specialization to these  climates. Attendant with this adaptation, however, is a high cost of  thermoregulation at temperatures below their T_{lc}, and this must be  an important factor in limiting their distributions to tropic and  subtropic climates. Differences in their distributions within these  climates, therefore, must hinge more on differences in their D_{dr}  and r_{maxr} values than on differences in their H_{br}/C_{mwr}  ratios. This is supported by the fact that _Potos flavus_, which has  the lowest D_{dr} and r_{maxr} values, is confined to a single  climate, whereas _Nasua nasua_, _Nasua narica_, and _Procyon  cancrivorus_ each possess larger D_{dr} and r_{maxr} values and are  found in two climates. Thus, _Potos flavus_, with its highly  specialized diet and low reproductive potential, is the most  ecologically specialized of these procyonids, and its distribution is  limited to the single climate that can provide its requirements.  _Nasua nasua_, _Nasua narica_, and _Procyon cancrivorus_ are less  specialized and thus show more ecological flexibility in their  distributions.     [Illustration: FIGURE 8.--Relationship between number of climates     in which a species is found and its composite score. Symbols for     _Nasua nasua_ overlap at coordinates (0.64, 2). Solid line     represents linear regression of climates (Y) on composite scores     (X): Y = 2.68.X + 0.24; R = 0.94.]    _Bassariscus astutus_, the other species with low [.H]_{b}, is found  in three climates, which indicates that it has greater ecological  flexibility than _Nasua nasua_, _Nasua narica_, or _Procyon  cancrivorus_. D_{dr} and r_{maxr} are comparable for these four  species (Table 12). This suggests that the greater ecological  flexibility of _Bassariscus astutus_ is derived largely from its  greater cold tolerance. _Bassariscus astutus_ has a more insulative  pelt than these other procyonids (C_{mwr} = 0.85; Table 7), so its  H_{br}/C_{mwr} ratio is higher (0.80; Table 12). This, and its greater  capacity for evaporative cooling (Chevalier, 1985), allows  _Bassariscus astutus_ to take advantage of a wider range of thermal  environments than these other species. However, even with its higher  H_{br}/C_{mwr} ratio, the composite score for _Bassariscus astutus_  is not much different than those for _Nasua nasua_, _Nasua narica_,  and _Procyon cancrivorus_ (Table 12). Consequently, _Bassariscus  astutus_ is found in more climates than would be predicted for it on  the basis of its composite score (Figure 8). This suggests that either  the H_{br}/C_{mwr} ratio carries greater weight in determining  distribution than is reflected in this analysis, or as has been  described for some other species (Bartholomew, 1958, 1987),  _Bassariscus astutus_ may extend its distribution farther than  expected via use of its behavior. In either case, for procyonids with  low [.H]_{b}, _Bassariscus astutus_ represents the pinnacle of  adaptation for climate generalization.        EVOLUTION OF METABOLIC ADAPTATIONS      _Evolution of Low Basal Metabolic Rate_    A radiation of frugivorous and omnivorous Procyoninae (Table 1)  occurred in the middle and late Miocene of North America. It included  origins of such terrestrial genera as _Cyonasua_, _Nasua_, and  _Procyon_ (Webb, 1985b). The earliest procyonid genus to find its way  to South America was _Cyonasua_, an omnivorous carnivore that  presumably split, along with its sister genus _Arctonasua_, from a  common North American ancestor (Baskin, 1982; Webb, 1985b).  _Cyonasua_, about the size of present-day raccoons, was adapted to a  wide range of habitats and was probably comparable to modern raccoons  with respect to the breadth of its feeding habits (Webb, 1985b;  Marshall, 1988). Because North American _Arctonasua_ was about the  same size as _Cyonasua_ (Webb, 1985b) and shared a number of  characters with it (Baskin, 1982), we speculate that it also may have  had similar habits and occupied similar climates and habitats.  _Bassariscus_, another member of Procyoninae, had an even earlier  origin in tropical North America (Webb, 1985b). The origin of the  small arboreal forms _Potos_ and _Bassaricyon_ (subfamily Potosinae)  is obscure but is thought to have occurred in the rainforests of  Central America (Webb, 1985b). What were the metabolic capabilities of  these early procyonids? We do not know, but for several million years,  from middle to late Miocene, procyonids lived in tropical and  subtropical forests of Central and North America (Webb, 1985b;  Marshall, 1988). Then, in the Pleistocene, several modern forms  crossed the Panamanian land bridge into similar habitats and climates  in South America; but none of them appear to have spread far enough  northward to have crossed the Bering land bridge.    Several million years exposure to a tropical environment, with its  continuous high temperatures and modest range of thermal extremes,  would have favored selection of metabolic and thermoregulatory traits  that would minimize energy requirements: a lower than predicted basal  metabolic rate, a prolonged or continuous molt resulting in very  little annual change in minimum thermal conductance, and a modest  capacity for evaporative cooling. In addition, we would expect  selection to have favored a diverse diet, good reproductive potential,  and behavioral flexibility to utilize a variety of habitats within  these climates. Our analysis has shown that such characteristics are  the norm for extant members of this family living in tropical and  subtropical climates, and we speculate that these traits also were  common to early procyonids and served to restrict them to these  climates. Our speculation is supported by the fact that their known  fossil history from the Miocene is confined to geographic areas that  had tropical and subtropical climates.    Later on, during Pleistocene glaciations, tropical and subtropical  forests shrank, savannas expanded, and temperate climate was pushed  toward equatorial regions. The opposite occurred during interglacial  periods (Raven and Axelrod, 1975; Webb, 1977, 1978; Marshall, 1988).  Consequently, mid-latitudes experienced alternating periods of  temperate and tropical, or at least subtropical, climate change.  Selection of characteristics that would have adapted a species with  low [.H]_{b} to temperate as well as tropic or subtropic climates  could have occurred in mid-latitudes at the temperate edge of these  tropical advances and retreats. Our analysis indicates that, for this  purpose, selection would have favored lower than predicted thermal  conductance, seasonal molt, increased capacity for evaporative  cooling, increased tolerance of elevated T_{b}, increased flexibility  of thermoregulatory behavior, food habits that provided for year-round  access to a high-quality diet in all three climates, and a higher than  predicted r_{max}.    _Bassariscus astutus_ is the only species with low [.H]_{b} that has  all these characteristics, and it is the only one of them that has  added temperate climate to its distribution (Table 11). This suggests  that _Bassariscus astutus_ is a species that evolved away"]]]
