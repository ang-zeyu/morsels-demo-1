But when these long-looked-for  second tusks really made their appearance, and had reached about the  length of my present miserable stump, I used to plague all my  acquaintance, by asking them whether they thought my tusks had grown  lately, or whether they would ever be as large and strong as our  leader's. At last I met with a cutting reproof from a surly old fellow,  who had often been pestered by me in this manner.    \"You impertinent young scamp,\" said he, \"what do I care about your  tusks, or whether they grow or not? One thing I know, and will tell you  for your comfort. If, when you grow up, your head should be as  deficient in _ivory_ as it is in _sense_, you need have no fear  whatever of the hunters, for I am sure you would not repay them for  the trouble of killing you.\"    This was very severe; but I must tell you that the old brute was  particularly cross on this occasion, for the day before he had been  terribly disappointed by not being chosen leader of the herd, and he  had found out, as I was afterwards informed, that he had lost his  election by the influence of my mother and some others of our family.    Well, my children, if I was once proud of my tusks, I have no cause for  such foolish vanity now with this hideous stump, though the other is  still nearly half as long again as any in the herd.    I will now relate to you how I first became acquainted with that  contemptible little animal, who has the vanity to call himself \"the  lord of the creation.\" I think it was in my twentieth year, just at the  end of the rainy season, that our herd had approached within less than  fifty miles of the Dutch settlement, for the purpose of visiting a  tract of marshy land overrun with high canes, the tender tops of which,  you well know, are such delicious food. I was busily employed in a  cane-brake, close to the banks of the river, in company with my mother  and two of my younger brothers, when one of the latter, who had left us  for a few minutes to wash the clammy juice of the canes from his mouth  and trunk, returned in such haste and agitation, that for some time not  a sound could he utter, except unintelligible gruntings and  sputterings. At last, he stammered out, \"Mother! mother! dreadful! I  have seen such a thing! Great monstrous monkeys, with long poles in  their paws, and sitting upright on the backs of immense deer, or some  such creatures, only they have got no horns on their heads!\"    Upon this, my mother, raising her trunk high in the air, immediately  sounded the well-known signal of alarm, and saying to us, \"Follow,  boys, follow!\" she darted through the cane-brake like a mad thing, only  stopping now and then to see how we kept up with her. We did our best;  but it was very laborious work, forcing our way at our utmost speed  through the thick canes, which were much higher than our heads, and in  some places; the ground was so soft, that we sunk in up to our bellies.  What a tremendous crash and splash we made, and how we did grunt and  snort! However, at last we reached the open country, two or three miles  from the bank of the river. Here we found more than half of the herd,  (we were seventy-five in number at that time,) and others were every  minute making their appearance from the canes. And now my mother, when  she had a little recovered her breath, turning to my brother who had  first given the alarm, explained to us the cause of this sudden  retreat. \"My son,\" said she, \"not _monkeys_ sitting upon _deer_ have  you seen, but _men_ upon _horses_, and the _long poles_ are _cruel  spears_ intended for your destruction.\"    Our careful leader now called over the names of his company, and  finding that two were missing, he ordered us to retreat to a thick wood  at a short distance, while himself and his brother, a steady sedate old  fellow, entered the cane-brake again, in hopes of falling in with the  lost ones. Being now collected together, we did not fear the enemy, who  is too cowardly to attack any but stragglers from the main body; but we  were very anxious about the fate of our missing friends, especially as  they were both rather young and giddy.    In about an hour we perceived the leader and his brother issuing from  the cane-brake, supporting between them one of the stragglers, who  appeared quite unable to walk by himself, and as they came near, we  could see that he was bleeding from several wounds in his body, and  that he had lost the use of one of his hind-legs.    But what a dreadful account he gave us! He said that he and his  brother, whose name was Brisk, were feeding in an open space close to  the river, when they heard my mother's alarm-call, which Brisk said was  nothing more than her usual voice when she was scolding her children.  So he refused to retreat, and persuaded his brother to remain with him,  when suddenly they found themselves surrounded by ten or twelve hunters  mounted on horse-back, and armed with long spears. They made the best  resistance they could, and killed one of the hunters; but at length our  wounded friend, finding himself weak from his wounds, rolled down the  steep bank into the river, where he was concealed by the overhanging  trees, and as the cold water refreshed and strengthened him, he swam  gently down the stream, keeping close under the bank till he came to a  good landing-place. Here, he with difficulty managed to scramble on  shore, and was proceeding slowly and in great pain through the canes,  when he was found by the leader and his brother, without whose  assistance he said he should never have reached the herd, for he was  bleeding fast, and a deep spear-wound in the upper joint of his  hind-leg was becoming more and more painful at every step.    After his wounds had been examined, and the bleeding had been stopped  by the application of the proper herbs, our poor friend was questioned  as to the fate of his brother, when he immediately swooned from excess  of agitation. Recovering a little, in a low voice and in broken words  he endeavoured to communicate the sad tidings.    \"Brother,\" said he, \"brother Brisk--brother Brisk barbarously\"--then  suddenly, to our amazement, jumping up on his three legs, he bellowed  forth with tremendous energy, \"Brother Brisk barbarously butchered!\"  Whereupon the whole herd, old and young, with quivering trunks high  raised in air, continued for some minutes to thunder forth in their  loudest tones, \"Brother Brisk barbarously butchered! Brother Brisk  barbarously butchered!\"    Did that wild cry of despair reach the ears of the hunters? If so, I  envy them not their feelings.    We continued in a close body all night with watchful sentinels on the  look-out. The next morning a council was held, from which my youth  excluded me; but we were soon informed, that our elders had determined  that we should retreat fifty or a hundred miles up the river, not (as  they were very particular in declaring) that they had any fear of the  enemy themselves, but on account of the number of young ones in the  herd, who, by wandering to a distance from the rest, would run great  risk of sharing the fate of poor Brisk. So, after waiting three or four  days for our wounded companion to recover a little, we set off on our  journey, keeping near the banks of the river, for the sake of the canes  and the opportunity of bathing. On the second day, coming to a narrow  part of the river, we determined to cross it as a greater security. It  was so shallow, that most of us could walk on the bottom with our  trunks raised above the surface of the water to breathe through, but  the very young ones either swam or were helped over by their mothers.    When we were all collected together, we heard a loud shout from the  opposite bank of the river, and lo! there were our enemies again, eight  in number, mounted on horses, and with their long steel lances  glittering in the sun. They had no doubt been following us closely all  day, looking out for stragglers. Some of our company who had complained  bitterly of our leader's strict discipline in obliging us to march in a  close body, now began to look rather silly. In a few minutes, another  horseman who appeared more heavily laden than his companions rode up to  them, and, oh! sight of horror! from his saddle were hanging a pair of  tusks, which no doubt a few days before had adorned the head of the  unfortunate Brisk!    After looking at us for some time, one of the hunters, more courageous  or more foolish than his companions, rode into the river as far as his  horse could go without swimming, till he was nearly half-way across,  and then, for the first time in my life, I had a fall view of the human  form and countenance.    Never before had I seen such a ridiculous object as this hunter, who  was pronounced to be an Englishman by some knowing ones in our company.  He was larger, certainly, than our amusing friends the monkeys, but his  pale face was not half so agreeable and intelligent, and as he sat on  his horse with his long thin legs dangling in the water, he looked so  disappointed and miserable, that, forgetting for a moment his villanous  cruelty, I almost pitied him. And so much for \"the majesty of the human  countenance\" which I have heard spoken of, but could never yet perceive.  It has been said that a bold man can subdue the rage even of the  ferocious tiger, merely by fixing his eye upon him. Very likely, for the  tiger is as cowardly as he is cruel; but did anybody ever hear of an  _elephant_, old or young, being frightened at a couple of little  twinkling eyes? Oh! most absurd!    After a little while the monkey--I mean the man in the river--joined  his companions on the bank, and when they had consulted together, they  seemed to give it up as a bad job. So they rode back down the river,  and we proceeded quietly on our journey.

But the Diameter of the little Circle,  through which these Rays are scattered by unequal Refrangibility, will  be about the 55th Part of the Aperture of the Object-glass, which here  is four Inches. And therefore, the Error arising from the Spherical  Figure of the Glass, is to the Error arising from the different  Refrangibility of the Rays, as 961/72000000 to 4/55, that is as 1 to  5449; and therefore being in comparison so very little, deserves not to  be considered.    [Illustration: FIG. 27.]    But you will say, if the Errors caused by the different Refrangibility  be so very great, how comes it to pass, that Objects appear through  Telescopes so distinct as they do? I answer, 'tis because the erring  Rays are not scattered uniformly over all that Circular Space, but  collected infinitely more densely in the Center than in any other Part  of the Circle, and in the Way from the Center to the Circumference, grow  continually rarer and rarer, so as at the Circumference to become  infinitely rare; and by reason of their Rarity are not strong enough to  be visible, unless in the Center and very near it. Let ADE [in _Fig._  27.] represent one of those Circles described with the Center C, and  Semi-diameter AC, and let BFG be a smaller Circle concentrick to the  former, cutting with its Circumference the Diameter AC in B, and bisect  AC in N; and by my reckoning, the Density of the Light in any Place B,  will be to its Density in N, as AB to BC; and the whole Light within the  lesser Circle BFG, will be to the whole Light within the greater AED, as  the Excess of the Square of AC above the Square of AB, is to the Square  of AC. As if BC be the fifth Part of AC, the Light will be four times  denser in B than in N, and the whole Light within the less Circle, will  be to the whole Light within the greater, as nine to twenty-five. Whence  it's evident, that the Light within the less Circle, must strike the  Sense much more strongly, than that faint and dilated Light round about  between it and the Circumference of the greater.    But it's farther to be noted, that the most luminous of the Prismatick  Colours are the yellow and orange. These affect the Senses more strongly  than all the rest together, and next to these in strength are the red  and green. The blue compared with these is a faint and dark Colour, and  the indigo and violet are much darker and fainter, so that these  compared with the stronger Colours are little to be regarded. The Images  of Objects are therefore to be placed, not in the Focus of the mean  refrangible Rays, which are in the Confine of green and blue, but in the  Focus of those Rays which are in the middle of the orange and yellow;  there where the Colour is most luminous and fulgent, that is in the  brightest yellow, that yellow which inclines more to orange than to  green. And by the Refraction of these Rays (whose Sines of Incidence and  Refraction in Glass are as 17 and 11) the Refraction of Glass and  Crystal for Optical Uses is to be measured. Let us therefore place the  Image of the Object in the Focus of these Rays, and all the yellow and  orange will fall within a Circle, whose Diameter is about the 250th  Part of the Diameter of the Aperture of the Glass. And if you add the  brighter half of the red, (that half which is next the orange) and the  brighter half of the green, (that half which is next the yellow) about  three fifth Parts of the Light of these two Colours will fall within the  same Circle, and two fifth Parts will fall without it round about; and  that which falls without will be spread through almost as much more  space as that which falls within, and so in the gross be almost three  times rarer. Of the other half of the red and green, (that is of the  deep dark red and willow green) about one quarter will fall within this  Circle, and three quarters without, and that which falls without will be  spread through about four or five times more space than that which falls  within; and so in the gross be rarer, and if compared with the whole  Light within it, will be about 25 times rarer than all that taken in the  gross; or rather more than 30 or 40 times rarer, because the deep red in  the end of the Spectrum of Colours made by a Prism is very thin and  rare, and the willow green is something rarer than the orange and  yellow. The Light of these Colours therefore being so very much rarer  than that within the Circle, will scarce affect the Sense, especially  since the deep red and willow green of this Light, are much darker  Colours than the rest. And for the same reason the blue and violet being  much darker Colours than these, and much more rarified, may be  neglected. For the dense and bright Light of the Circle, will obscure  the rare and weak Light of these dark Colours round about it, and  render them almost insensible. The sensible Image of a lucid Point is  therefore scarce broader than a Circle, whose Diameter is the 250th Part  of the Diameter of the Aperture of the Object-glass of a good Telescope,  or not much broader, if you except a faint and dark misty Light round  about it, which a Spectator will scarce regard. And therefore in a  Telescope, whose Aperture is four Inches, and Length an hundred Feet, it  exceeds not 2'' 45''', or 3''. And in a Telescope whose Aperture is two  Inches, and Length 20 or 30 Feet, it may be 5'' or 6'', and scarce  above. And this answers well to Experience: For some Astronomers have  found the Diameters of the fix'd Stars, in Telescopes of between 20 and  60 Feet in length, to be about 5'' or 6'', or at most 8'' or 10'' in  diameter. But if the Eye-Glass be tincted faintly with the Smoak of a  Lamp or Torch, to obscure the Light of the Star, the fainter Light in  the Circumference of the Star ceases to be visible, and the Star (if the  Glass be sufficiently soiled with Smoak) appears something more like a  mathematical Point. And for the same Reason, the enormous Part of the  Light in the Circumference of every lucid Point ought to be less  discernible in shorter Telescopes than in longer, because the shorter  transmit less Light to the Eye.    Now, that the fix'd Stars, by reason of their immense Distance, appear  like Points, unless so far as their Light is dilated by Refraction, may  appear from hence; that when the Moon passes over them and eclipses  them, their Light vanishes, not gradually like that of the Planets, but  all at once; and in the end of the Eclipse it returns into Sight all at  once, or certainly in less time than the second of a Minute; the  Refraction of the Moon's Atmosphere a little protracting the time in  which the Light of the Star first vanishes, and afterwards returns into  Sight.    Now, if we suppose the sensible Image of a lucid Point, to be even 250  times narrower than the Aperture of the Glass; yet this Image would be  still much greater than if it were only from the spherical Figure of the  Glass. For were it not for the different Refrangibility of the Rays, its  breadth in an 100 Foot Telescope whose aperture is 4 Inches, would be  but 961/72000000 parts of an Inch, as is manifest by the foregoing  Computation. And therefore in this case the greatest Errors arising from  the spherical Figure of the Glass, would be to the greatest sensible  Errors arising from the different Refrangibility of the Rays as  961/72000000 to 4/250 at most, that is only as 1 to 1200. And this  sufficiently shews that it is not the spherical Figures of Glasses, but  the different Refrangibility of the Rays which hinders the perfection of  Telescopes.    There is another Argument by which it may appear that the different  Refrangibility of Rays, is the true cause of the imperfection of  Telescopes. For the Errors of the Rays arising from the spherical  Figures of Object-glasses, are as the Cubes of the Apertures of the  Object Glasses; and thence to make Telescopes of various Lengths magnify  with equal distinctness, the Apertures of the Object-glasses, and the  Charges or magnifying Powers ought to be as the Cubes of the square  Roots of their lengths; which doth not answer to Experience. But the  Errors of the Rays arising from the different Refrangibility, are as the  Apertures of the Object-glasses; and thence to make Telescopes of  various lengths, magnify with equal distinctness, their Apertures and  Charges ought to be as the square Roots of their lengths; and this  answers to Experience, as is well known. For Instance, a Telescope of 64  Feet in length, with an Aperture of 2-2/3 Inches, magnifies about 120  times, with as much distinctness as one of a Foot in length, with 1/3 of  an Inch aperture, magnifies 15 times.    [Illustration: FIG. 28.]    Now were it not for this different Refrangibility of Rays, Telescopes  might be brought to a greater perfection than we have yet describ'd, by  composing the Object-glass of two Glasses with Water between them. Let  ADFC [in _Fig._ 28.] represent the Object-glass composed of two Glasses  ABED and BEFC, alike convex on the outsides AGD and CHF, and alike  concave on the insides BME, BNE, with Water in the concavity BMEN. Let  the Sine of Incidence out of Glass into Air be as I to R, and out of  Water into Air, as K to R, and by consequence out of Glass into Water,  as I to K: and let the Diameter of the Sphere to which the convex sides  AGD and CHF are ground be D, and the Diameter of the Sphere to which the  concave sides BME and BNE, are ground be to D, as the Cube Root of  KK--KI to the Cube Root of RK--RI: and the Refractions on the concave  sides of the Glasses, will very much correct the Errors of the"]]]
