The doctor approached and asked what was the matter.  The man was a saddler, from whom the marquise had bought a carriage  before she left France; this she had partly paid for, but still owed him  two hundred livres. He produced the note he had had from her, on which  was a faithful record of the sums she had paid on account. The marquise  at this point called out, not knowing what was going on, and the doctor  and executioner went to her. \"Have they come to fetch me already?\" said  she. \"I am not well prepared just at this moment; but never mind, I am  ready.\"    The doctor reassured her, and told her what was going on. \"The man is  quite right,\" she said to the executioner; \"tell him I will give orders  as far as I can about the money.\" Then, seeing the executioner retiring,  she said to the doctor, \"Must I go now, sir? I wish they would give me a  little more time; for though I am ready, as I told you, I am not really  prepared. Forgive me, father; it is the question and the sentence that  have upset me it is this fire burning in my eyes like hell-flames.    \"Had they left me with you all this time, there would now be better hope  of my salvation.\"    \"Madame,\" said the doctor, \"you will probably have all the time before  nightfall to compose yourself and think what remains for you to do.\"    \"Ah, sir,\" she replied, with a smile, \"do not think they will show so  much consideration for a poor wretch condemned to be burnt. That does  not depend on ourselves; but as soon as everything is ready, they will  let us know, and we must start.\"    \"Madame,\" said the doctor, \"I am certain that they will give you the  time you need.\"    \"No, no,\" she replied abruptly and feverishly, \"no, I will not keep them  waiting. As soon as the tumbril is at this door, they have only to tell  me, and I go down.\"    \"Madame,\" said he, \"I would not hold you back if I found you prepared to  stand before the face of God, for in your situation it is right to ask  for no time, and to go when the moment is come; but not everyone is so  ready as Christ was, who rose from prayer and awaked His disciples that  He might leave the garden and go out to meet His enemies. You at this  moment are weak, and if they come for you just now I should resist your  departure.\"    \"Be calm; the time is not yet come,\" said the executioner, who had heard  this talk. He knew his statement must be believed, and wished as far as  possible to reassure the marquise. \"There is no hurry, and we cannot  start for another two of three hours.\"    This assurance calmed the marquise somewhat, and she thanked the man.  Then turning to the doctor, she said, \"Here is a rosary that I would  rather should not fall into this person's hands. Not that he could not  make good use of it; for, in spite of their trade, I fancy that these  people are Christians like ourselves. But I should prefer to leave this  to somebody else.\"    \"Madame,\" said the doctor, \"if you will tell me your wishes in this  matter, I will see that they are carried out.\"    \"Alas!\" she said, \"there is no one but my sister; and I fear lest she,  remembering my crime towards her, may be too horrified to touch anything  that belonged to me. If she did not mind, it would be a great comfort to  me to think she would wear it after my death, and that the sight of it  would remind her to pray for me; but after what has passed, the rosary  could hardly fail to revive an odious recollection. My God, my God! I am  desperately wicked; can it be that you will pardon me?\"    \"Madame,\" replied the doctor, \"I think you are mistaken about Mlle,  d'Aubray. You may see by her letter what are her feelings towards you,  and you must pray with this rosary up to the very end. Let not your  prayers be interrupted or distracted, for no guilty penitent must cease  from prayer; and I, madame, will engage to deliver the rosary where it  will be gladly received.\"    And the marquise, who had been constantly distracted since the morning,  was now, thanks to the patient goodness of the doctor, able to return  with her former fervour to her prayers. She prayed till seven o'clock.  As the clock struck, the executioner without a word came and stood  before her; she saw that her moment had come, and said to the doctor,  grasping his arm, \"A little longer; just a few moments, I entreat.\"    \"Madame,\" said the doctor, rising, \"we will now adore the divine blood  of the Sacrament, praying that you may be thus cleansed from all soil  and sin that may be still in your heart. Thus shall you gain the respite  you desire.\"    The executioner then tied tight the cords round her hands that he had  let loose before, and she advanced pretty firmly and knelt before the  altar, between the doctor and the chaplain. The latter was in his  surplice, and chanted a 'Veni Creator, Salve Regina, and Tantum ergo'.  These prayers over, he pronounced the blessing of the Holy Sacrament,  while the marquise knelt with her face upon the ground. The executioner  then went forward to get ready a shirt, and she made her exit from the  chapel, supported on the left by the doctor's arm, on the right by the  executioner's assistant. Thus proceeding, she first felt embarrassment  and confusion. Ten or twelve people were waiting outside, and as she  suddenly confronted them, she made a step backward, and with her hands,  bound though they were, pulled the headdress down to cover half her  face. She passed through a small door, which was closed behind her, and  then found herself between the two doors alone, with the doctor and the  executioner's man. Here the rosary, in consequence of her violent  movement to cover her face, came undone, and several beads fell on the  floor. She went on, however, without observing this; but the doctor  stopped her, and he and the man stooped down and picked up all the  beads, which they put into her hand. Thanking them humbly for this  attention, she said to the man, \"Sir, I know I have now no worldly  possessions, that all I have upon me belongs to you, and I may not give  anything away without your consent; but I ask you kindly to allow me to  give this chaplet to the doctor before I die: you will not be much the  loser, for it is of no value, and I am giving it to him for my sister.  Kindly let me do this.\"    \"Madame,\" said the man, \"it is the custom for us to get all the property  of the condemned; but you are mistress of all you have, and if the thing  were of the very greatest value you might dispose of it as you pleased.\"    The doctor, whose arm she held, felt her shiver at this gallantry, which  for her, with her natural haughty disposition, must have been the worst  humiliation imaginable; but the movement was restrained, and her face  gave no sign. She now came to the porch of the Conciergerie, between the  court and the first door, and there she was made to sit down, so as to  be put into the right condition for making the 'amende honorable'. Each  step brought her nearer to the scaffold, and so did each incident cause  her more uneasiness. Now she turned round desperately, and perceived the  executioner holding a shirt in his hand. The door of the vestibule  opened, and about fifty people came in, among them the Countess of  Soissons, Madame du Refuge, Mlle. de Scudery, M. de Roquelaure, and the  Abbe de Chimay. At the sight the marquise reddened with shame, and  turning to the doctor, said, \"Is this man to strip me again, as he did  in the question chamber? All these preparations are very cruel; and, in  spite of myself, they divert my thoughts, from God.\"    Low as her voice was, the executioner heard, and reassured her, saying  that they would take nothing off, only putting the shirt over her other  clothes.    He then approached, and the marquise, unable to speak to the doctor with  a man on each side of her, showed him by her looks how deeply she felt  the ignominy of her situation. Then, when the shirt had been put on, for  which operation her hands had to be untied, the man raised the headdress  which she had pulled down, and tied it round her neck, then fastened her  hands together with one rope and put another round her waist, and yet  another round her neck; then, kneeling before her, he took off her shoes  and stockings. Then she stretched out her hands to the doctor.    \"Oh, sir,\" she cried, \"in God's name, you see what they have done to me!  Come and comfort me.\"    The doctor came at once, supporting her head upon his breast, trying to  comfort her; but she, in a tone of bitter lamentation, gazing at the  crowd, who devoured her with all their eyes, cried, \"Oh, sir, is not  this a strange, barbarous curiosity?\"    \"Madame,\" said he, the tears in his eyes, \"do not look at these eager  people from the point of view of their curiosity and barbarity, though  that is real enough, but consider it part of the humiliation sent by God  for the expiation of your crimes. God, who was innocent, was subject to  very different opprobrium, and yet suffered all with joy; for, as  Tertullian observes, He was a victim fattened on the joys of suffering  alone.\"    As the doctor spoke these words, the executioner placed in the  marquise's hands the lighted torch which she was to carry to Notre-Dame,  there to make the 'amende honorable', and as it was too heavy, weighing  two pounds, the doctor supported it with his right hand, while the  registrar read her sentence aloud a second time. The doctor did all in  his power to prevent her from hearing this by speaking unceasingly of  God. Still she grew frightfully pale at the words, \"When this is done,  she shall be conveyed on a tumbril, barefoot, a cord round her neck,  holding in her hands a burning torch two pounds in weight,\" and the  doctor could feel no doubt that in spite of his efforts she had heard.  It became still worse when she reached the threshold of the vestibule  and saw the great crowd waiting in "]]]
