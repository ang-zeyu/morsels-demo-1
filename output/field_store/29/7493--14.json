[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43607"],[0,"Builders of United Italy (#14)"],[1," The examination into the  charges against Manin and Tommaseo continued, although nothing illegal  could be proved against them there was a prospect of their arbitrary  removal out of Venice and to that prison of Spielberg where the careers  of so many gifted Italian patriots had ended. Manin heard that the  French had driven their King from his throne, he wondered what effect  the growing tumult of that revolution year would have on Venice. He did  not have to wait long to learn. The flames of revolt had spread across  Europe even to Vienna, Metternich had fled from the city in peril of  his life, the Austrian throne was tottering. Manin saw what was coming,  and made his plans even while he was in prison to secure Venice against  anarchy.    On the morning of March 17, 1848, the Venetians hastened to the dock  to learn the latest news of Vienna from the Trieste packet. A French  merchant on board called to the gondoliers the news, \"A Constitution  at Vienna! The Recognition of Italian Independence! A Free Press! A  National Guard!\" The words were sufficient, the people rushed to the  Governor's palace and demanded the immediate release of Manin and  Tommaseo. The Governor wavered, declaimed, finally yielded, saying, \"I  do what I ought not to do.\" The people swept to the prison, and beating  down the doors, discovered the two captives. \"You are free!\" the leaders  shouted. Manin still chose to follow the usage of law, and asked to see  the warrant for his release. It was produced, and then he and his fellow  captive were led forth from the dreary cells with loud acclaims of joy.  Manin was raised in a chair, and so carried to the great Square of St.  Mark's, the scene of so many triumphs in Venetian history. The yellow  and black flag of Austria had in some mysterious fashion fluttered down  from the ancient flag-staves that guard the square and in its place  floated the red, white, and green emblem. \"Speak!\" cried the people,  and Manin, pale, infirm, and gaunt from prison life, rose and spoke  with his remarkably persuasive voice. He said he did not know to what  great events he owed his freedom, but could see clearly that nationality  and patriotic fire had grown wonderfully during the past few months.  \"But forget not, I beg,\" he implored, \"that true and lasting liberty  can only rest on order, and that you must make yourselves the emulous  guardians of order if you would show that you are worthy to be free.\" He  paused a moment, then added, \"Yet there are times pointed out to us by  Providence when insurrection becomes not only a right, but a duty.\"    Manin returned home, already intent on plans to regulate the new order  of things. Towards night the great bell in the Ducal Chapel sounded  the warning note, the people rushed to the Piazza to find a battalion  of Croats tearing down the Italian tricolor, the people resisted, the  soldiers cleared the square with a bayonet charge, but the Venetians  had tasted triumph too fully to be dismayed. Some of them went to Manin  and asked him to lead them against the Croats. \"This is not the way,\"  he answered, \"we must have a civic guard.\" He sent a messenger to the  Governor. \"Tell him that to-day his life was in my hands, and that I  preached order, not vengeance; and now, in the interest of his own life  as well as of order, he must at once organize a civic guard.\"    Again Count Palffy hesitated and put off the demand from day to day. He  sent messengers to the Viceroy at Verona, and the latter telegraphed him  permission to enroll two hundred citizens. Three thousand at once took  arms and called on Manin to give them his commands. \"Let all who will  not absolutely obey me depart,\" he said, but no one left. At last Venice  again had an army of her own.    There was no immediate bloodshed. The leading citizens conferred as to  what course Venice should take if the revolution in Vienna succeeded.  Some were for joining the kingdom of Charles Albert, some for uniting  with Lombardy, some for an Austrian ruler under a constitution. Manin  scattered their diverse views, he told them that their immediate need  was freedom, that their city must actually be in their own charge  before considering her destiny. Rumors came that the city was about  to be bombarded, there was danger both from the arsenal and from the  sea, and on the night of March 21 Manin laid his plans before the chief  patriots and told them that they must seize the arsenal. \"The people  of Venice,\" he said, \"can only understand one cry, 'Let the Republic  live!'\" Still the others hesitated; one said, \"The people are incapable  of sacrifices!\" \"You do not know them,\" cried Manin. \"I know them; that  is my sole merit, you will see!\"    Newcomers arrived, and still Manin, worn with argument, pressed his  opinion. He finished, saying, \"We must have the Republic, and join with  it Saint Mark. The Republic and Saint Mark will echo in Dalmatia.\"    \"Viva San Marco!\" came an answering cry. \"It is the only one, the  rallying cry of Venice!\"    The conference agreed; Manin sent for the commander-in-chief of  the civic guard. \"The city is threatened with bombardment,\" he  said. \"I wish to take the arsenal at all hazards. You must make me  commander-in-chief for a day. Form the six battalions into two brigades,  and give me their captains for eight hours.\" The general, astounded  at the advocate's demand, left without making a reply. Manin sent to  the other commanders making the same demand. One by one they refused,  claiming that the project was too wild.    Meanwhile the soldiers at the arsenal were in mutiny and had killed the  second officer in command; there was danger of the spirit of anarchy  spreading. At the same time the last of the commanders, Major Olivieri,  placed his single battalion at Manin's command. The advocate seized  his sword, called his son, a boy of sixteen, to follow him, and put  himself at the head of the two hundred guards. The little band marched  on the arsenal and forced the commander to surrender; almost before the  Austrian officers knew what had happened the Venetians were distributing  the military stores among the people. At the moment of taking the  arsenal Manin had sent word to call the whole people into St. Mark's  Square. He found the ancient banner, the winged lion, and raising it  from the dust where it had lain for fifty years he unfurled it before  his company and led them back across the Piazzetta into the great  square. He had told the people he would meet them there at noon; now  he stood before them, bearing the emblem that proclaimed that Venice  had risen from her lengthy slumbers. He spoke to the assembled city.  \"Venetians, we are free! And we are so without the shedding of blood,  either our own, or our brothers', for to me all men are brothers. But  when the old government is overturned, the new must take its place; the  best now seems to me to be the Republic which speaks of our past glory  and adds the liberty of modern times. But by this we shall not separate  from our Italian brothers, but rather form one of those centers destined  to aid in fusing our Italy into one people. Live the Republic! Live  liberty! Live Saint Mark!\"    The civic guards swore to defend with their lives the new Republic and  its founder, the aged wept, the young embraced, all raised their hands  in gratitude to heaven. The people reveled in noble delirium of joy.  Venice looked upon Manin as its deliverer; the citizens did not know the  physical anguish he had undergone. Pathetic are the words of his little  daughter Emilia as she heard her father proclaimed. \"I ought,\" she  wrote, \"to be filled with ineffable gladness, but a weight continually  presses my heart.\"    Manin had scarcely closed his eyes for five days and nights. As soon as  the people would release him now he went home utterly exhausted: he said  to his friends, \"Leave me at least this night to rest, or I shall die.\"    The Austrian authorities saw that resistance would be of little avail,  their own forces were too small and too much in sympathy with the  people's cause to give them a sense of any real power on which to rely,  and accordingly the Governor acceded to the terms imposed upon him. All  foreign troops were to be removed, the forts and all military stores  surrendered, the government transferred to the charge of a Committee of  Venetian citizens. The demands were sweeping, the Austrian government  later regarded the Venetian capitulation as the most humiliating they  suffered in the revolutionary year of 1848.    That same night the provisional government announced to the people the  terms of the Austrian capitulation, and the citizens were amazed to find  that neither the name of Manin nor of Tommaseo was included in the new  government. They made their dissatisfaction so apparent that friends  went to see Manin to beg him to send some message to the people. He  dictated the following lines from his bed: \"Venetians! I know that you  love me, and, in the name of that love, I ask you to conduct yourselves,  during the legitimate manifestation of your joy, with that dignity  which belongs to men worthy of being free. Your friend, Manin.\"    The people heard the message and quietly dispersed. Next day the  provisional government found that the new Republic would only have the  one man at its head, and so they asked Manin to form a government. He  did so immediately, taking for himself the Presidency of the Council  and Foreign Affairs. He composed his government of men of different  classes and different religions, all Venetians were assured of perfect  equality in their new state. The patriarch blessed the standard of the  Republic, and the commander of the fleet read the list of the ministry  to the people. The reading was broken by constant cries of \"Viva Manin!  President of the Republic!\"    Thus Venice became free after fifty years of bondage. It was now  Manin's concern to see that she was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4361"],[0,"Memoirs of General William T.

He afterward came on  shore, was provided with clothing and a horse, returned to Sonoma,  and I never have seen him since.    Matters and things settled down in Upper California, and all moved  along with peace and harmony.  The war still continued in Mexico,  and the navy authorities resolved to employ their time with the  capture of Mazatlan and Guaymas.  Lower California had already been  occupied by two companies of Stevenson's regiment, under  Lieutenant-Colonel Burton, who had taken post at La Paz, and a  small party of sailors was on shore at San Josef, near Cape San  Lucas, detached from the Lexington, Lieutenant-Commander Bailey.  The orders for this occupation were made by General Kearney before  he left, in pursuance of instructions from the War Department,  merely to subserve a political end, for there were few or no people  in Lower California, which is a miserable, wretched, dried-up  peninsula.  I remember the proclamation made by Burton and Captain  Bailey, in taking possession, which was in the usual florid style.  Bailey signed his name as the senior naval officer at the station,  but, as it was necessary to put it into Spanish to reach the  inhabitants of the newly-acquired country, it was interpreted, \"El  mas antiguo de todos los oficiales de la marina,\" etc., which,  literally, is \"the  most ancient of all the naval officers,\" etc.,  a translation at which we made some fun.    The expedition to Mazatlan was, however, for a different purpose,  viz., to get possession of the ports of Mazatlan and Guaymas, as a  part of the war against Mexico, and not for permanent conquest.    Commodore Shubrick commanded this expedition, and took Halleck  along as his engineer-officer.  They captured Mazatlan and Guaymas,  and then called on Colonel Mason to send soldiers down to hold  possession, but he had none to spare, and it was found impossible  to raise other volunteers either in California or Oregon, and the  navy held these places by detachments of sailors and marines till  the end of the war.  Burton also called for reenforcements, and  Naglee'a company was sent to him from Monterey, and these three  companies occupied Lower California at the end of the Mexican War.  Major Hardie still commanded at San Francisco and above; Company F,  Third Artillery, and Shannon's company of volunteers, were at  Monterey; Lippett's company at Santa Barbara; Colonel Stevenson,  with one company of his regiment, and the company of the First  Dragoons, was at Los Angeles; and a company of Mormons, reenlisted  out of the Mormon Battalion, garrisoned San Diego--and thus matters  went along throughout 1847 into 1848.  I had occasion to make  several trips to Yerba Buena and back, and in the spring of 1848  Colonel Mason and I went down to Santa Barbara in the sloop-of-war  Dale.    I spent much time in hunting deer and bear in the mountains back of  the Carmel Mission, and ducks and geese in the plains of the  Salinas.  As soon as the fall rains set in, the young oats would  sprout up, and myriads of ducks, brant, and geese, made their  appearance.  In a single day, or rather in the evening of one day  and the morning of the next, I could load a pack-mule with geese  and ducks.  They had grown somewhat wild from the increased number  of hunters, yet, by marking well the place where a flock lighted, I  could, by taking advantage of gullies or the shape of the ground,  creep up within range; and, giving one barrel on the ground, and  the other as they rose, I have secured as many as nine at one  discharge.  Colonel Mason on one occasion killed eleven geese by  one discharge of small shot.  The seasons in California are well  marked.  About October and November the rains begin, and the whole  country, plains and mountains, becomes covered with a bright-green  grass, with endless flowers.  The intervals between the rains give  the finest weather possible.  These rains are less frequent in  March, and cease altogether in April and May, when gradually the  grass dies and the whole aspect of things changes, first to yellow,  then to brown, and by midsummer all is burnt up and dry as an  ashheap.    When General Kearney first departed we took his office at Larkin's;  but shortly afterward we had a broad stairway constructed to lead  from the outside to the upper front porch of the barracks.  By  cutting a large door through the adobe-wall, we made the upper room  in the centre our office; and another side-room, connected with it  by a door, was Colonel Mason's private office.    I had a single clerk, a soldier named Baden; and William E. P.  Hartnell, citizen, also had a table in the same room.  He was the  government interpreter, and had charge of the civil archives.  After Halleck's return from Mazatlan, he was, by Colonel Mason,  made Secretary of State; and he then had charge of the civil  archives, including the land-titles, of which Fremont first had  possession, but which had reverted to us when he left the country.    I remember one day, in the spring of 1848, that two men, Americans,  came into the office and inquired for the Governor.  I asked their  business, and one answered that they had just come down from  Captain Sutter on special business, and they wanted to see Governor  Mason in person.  I took them in to the colonel, and left them  together.  After some time the colonel came to his door and called  to me.  I went in, and my attention was directed to a series of  papers unfolded on his table, in which lay about half an ounce of  placer gold.  Mason said to me, \"What is that?\" I touched it and  examined one or two of the larger pieces, and asked, \"Is it gold?\"  Mason asked me if I had ever seen native gold.  I answered that, in  1844, I was in Upper Georgia, and there saw some native gold, but  it was much finer than this, and that it was in phials, or in  transparent quills; but I said that, if this were gold, it could be  easily tested, first, by its malleability, and next by acids.  I  took a piece in my teeth, and the metallic lustre was perfect.  I  then called to the clerk, Baden, to bring an axe and hatchet from  the backyard.  When these were brought, I took the largest piece  and beat it out flat, and beyond doubt it was metal, and a pure  metal.  Still, we attached little importance to the fact, for gold  was known to exist at San Fernando, at the south, and yet was not  considered of much value.  Colonel Mason then handed me a letter  from Captain Sutter, addressed to him, stating that he (Sutter) was  engaged in erecting a saw-mill at Coloma, about forty miles up the  American Fork, above his fort at New Helvetia, for the general  benefit of the settlers in that vicinity; that he had incurred  considerable expense, and wanted a \"preemption\" to the  quarter-section of land on which the mill was located, embracing the  tail-race in which this particular gold had been found.  Mason  instructed me to prepare a letter, in answer, for his signature.  I  wrote off a letter, reciting that California was yet a Mexican  province, simply held by us as a conquest; that no laws of the  United States yet applied to it, much less the land laws or  preemption laws, which could only apply after a public survey.  Therefore it was impossible for the Governor to promise him (Sutter)  a title to the land; yet, as there were no settlements within forty  miles, he was not likely to be disturbed by trespassers.  Colonel  Mason signed the letter, handed it to one of the gentlemen who had  brought the sample of gold, and they departed.  That gold was the  first discovered in the Sierra Nevada, which soon revolutionized the  whole country, and actually moved the whole civilized world.  About  this time (May and June, 1848), far more importance was attached to  quicksilver.  One mine, the New Almaden, twelve miles south of San  Jose, was well known, and was in possession of the agent of a Scotch  gentleman named Forties, who at the time was British consul at  Tepic, Mexico.  Mr. Forties came up from San Blas in a small brig,  which proved to be a Mexican vessel; the vessel was seized,  condemned, and actually sold, but Forties was wealthy, and bought  her in.  His title to the quicksilver-mine was, however, never  disputed, as he had bought it regularly, before our conquest of the  country, from another British subject, also named Forties, a  resident of Santa Clara Mission, who had purchased it of the  discoverer, a priest; but the boundaries of the land attached to the  mine were even then in dispute.  Other men were in search of  quicksilver; and the whole range of mountains near the New Almaden  mine was stained with the brilliant red of the sulphuret of mercury  (cinnabar).  A company composed of T. O. Larkin, J. R. Snyder, and  others, among them one John Ricord (who was quite a character), also  claimed a valuable mine near by. Ricord was a lawyer from about  Buffalo, and by some means had got to the Sandwich Islands, where he  became a great favorite of the king, Kamehameha; was his  attorney-general, and got into a difficulty with the Rev. Mr. Judd,  who was a kind of prime-minister to his majesty.  One or the other  had to go, and Ricord left for San Francisco, where he arrived while  Colonel Mason and I were there on some business connected with the  customs. Ricord at once made a dead set at Mason with flattery, and  all sorts of spurious arguments, to convince him that our military  government was too simple in its forms for the new state of facts,  and that he was the man to remodel it.  I had heard a good deal to  his prejudice, and did all I could to prevent Mason taking him, into  his confidence. We then started back for Monterey.  Ricord was  along, and night and day he was harping on his scheme; but he  disgusted Colonel Mason with his flattery, and, on reaching  Monterey, he opened what he called a law-office, but "]]]
