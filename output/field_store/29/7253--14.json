Instantly  they rushed to the graveyards, tore open the tombs, and collected the  bones and putrefying corpses. The beautiful olive trees were felled, an  enormous funeral pyre arose, and in the general excitement the orders of  the English chief were defied. With naked daggers in their hands,  standing in the crimson light of the flames which were consuming the  bones of their ancestors, the people of Parga vowed to slay their wives  and children, and to kill themselves to the last man, if the infidels  dared to set foot in the town before the appointed hour. Xenocles, the  last of the Greek poets, inspired by this sublime manifestation of  despair, even as Jeremiah by the fall of Jerusalem, improvised a hymn  which expresses all the grief of the exiles, and which the exiles  interrupted by their tears and sobs.    A messenger, crossing the sea in all haste, informed the Lord High  Commissioner of the terrible threat of the Parganiotes. He started at  once, accompanied by General Sir Frederic Adams, and landed at Parga by  the light of the funeral pyre. He was received with ill-concealed  indignation, and with assurances that the sacrifice would be at once  consummated unless Ali's troops were held back. The general endeavoured  to console and to reassure the unhappy people, and then proceeded to the  outposts, traversing silent streets in which armed men stood at each  door only waiting a signal before slaying their families, and then  turning their weapons against the English and themselves. He implored  them to have patience, and they answered by pointing to the approaching  Turkish army and bidding him hasten. He arrived at last and commenced  negotiations, and the Turkish officers, no less uneasy than the English  garrison, promised to wait till the appointed hour. The next day passed  in mournful silence, quiet as death, At sunset on the following day, May  9, 1819, the English standard on the castle of Parga was hauled down,  and after a night spent in prayer and weeping, the Christians demanded  the signal of departure.    They had left their dwellings at break of day, and scattering on the  shore, endeavoured to collect some relics of their country. Some filled  little bags with ashes withdrawn from the funeral pile; others took  handfuls of earth, while the women and children picked up pebbles which  they hid in their clothing and pressed to their bosoms, as if fearing to  be deprived of them. Meanwhile, the ships intended to transport them  arrived, and armed English soldiers superintended the embarkation, which  the Turks hailed from afar with, ferocious cries. The Parganiotes were  landed in Corfu, where they suffered yet more injustice. Under various  pretexts the money promised them was reduced and withheld, until  destitution compelled them to accept the little that was offered. Thus  closed one of the most odious transactions which modern history has been  compelled to record.    The satrap of Janina had arrived at the fulfilment of his wishes. In the  retirement of his fairy-like palace by the lake he could enjoy  voluptuous pleasures to the full. But already seventy-eight years had  passed over his head, and old age had laid the burden of infirmity upon  him. His dreams were dreams of blood, and vainly he sought refuge in  chambers glittering with gold, adorned with arabesques, decorated with  costly armour and covered with the richest of Oriental carpets, remorse  stood ever beside him. Through the magnificence which surrounded him  there constantly passed the gale spectre of Emineh, leading onwards a  vast procession of mournful phantoms, and the guilty pasha buried his  face in his hands and shrieked aloud for help. Sometimes, ashamed of his  weakness, he endeavoured to defy both the reproaches of his conscience  and the opinion of the multitude, and sought to encounter criticism with  bravado. If, by chance, he overheard some blind singer chanting in the  streets the satirical verses which, faithful to the poetical and mocking  genius of them ancestors, the Greeks frequently composed about him, he  would order the singer to be brought, would bid him repeat his verses,  and, applauding him, would relate some fresh anecdote of cruelty,  saying, \"Go, add that to thy tale; let thy hearers know what I can do;  let them understand that I stop at nothing in order to overcome my foes!  If I reproach myself with anything, it is only with the deeds I have  sometimes failed to carry out.\"    Sometimes it was the terrors of the life after death which assailed him.  The thought of eternity brought terrible visions in its train, and Ali  shuddered at the prospect of Al-Sirat, that awful bridge, narrow as a  spider's thread and hanging over the furnaces of Hell; which a Mussulman  must cross in order to arrive at the gate of Paradise. He ceased to joke  about Eblis, the Prince of Evil, and sank by degrees into profound  superstition. He was surrounded by magicians and soothsayers; he  consulted omens, and demanded talismans and charms from the dervishes,  which he had either sewn into his garments, or suspended in the most  secret parts of his palace, in order to avert evil influences. A Koran  was hung about his neck as a defence against the evil eye, and  frequently he removed it and knelt before it, as did Louis XI before the  leaden figures of saints which adorned his hat. He ordered a complete  chemical laboratory from Venice, and engaged alchemists to distill the  water of immortality, by the help of which he hoped to ascend to the  planets and discover the Philosopher's Stone. Not perceiving any  practical result of their labours, he ordered, the laboratory to be  burnt and the alchemists to be hung.    Ali hated his fellow-men. He would have liked to leave no survivors, and  often regretted his inability to destroy all those who would have cause  to rejoice at his death, Consequently he sought to accomplish as much  harm as he could during the time which remained to him, and for no  possible reason but that of hatred, he caused the arrest of both Ibrahim  Pasha, who had already suffered so much at his hands, and his son, and  confined them both in a dungeon purposely constructed under the grand  staircase of the castle by the lake, in order that he might have the  pleasure of passing over their heads each time he left his apartments or  returned to them.    It was not enough for Ali merely to put to death those who displeased  him, the form of punishment must be constantly varied in order to  produce a fresh mode of suffering, therefore new tortures had to be  constantly invented. Now it was a servant, guilty of absence without  leave, who was bound to a stake in the presence of his sister, and  destroyed by a cannon placed six paces off, but only loaded with powder,  in order to prolong the agony; now, a Christian accused of having tried  to blow up Janina by introducing mice with tinder fastened to their  tails into the powder magazine, who was shut up in the cage of Ali's  favourite tiger and devoured by it.    The pasha despised the human race as much as he hated it. A European  having reproached him with the cruelty shown to his subjects, Ali  replied:--    \"You do not understand the race with which I have to deal. Were I to  hang a criminal on yonder tree, the sight would not deter even his own  brother from stealing in the crowd at its foot. If I had an old man  burnt alive, his son would steal the ashes and sell them. The rabble can  be governed by fear only, and I am the one man who does it  successfully.\"    His conduct perfectly corresponded to his ideas. One great feast-day,  two gipsies devoted their lives in order to avert the evil destiny of  the pasha; and, solemnly convoking on their own heads all misfortunes  which might possibly befall him, cast themselves down from the palace  roof. One arose with difficulty, stunned and suffering, the other  remained on the ground with a broken leg. Ali gave them each forty  francs and an annuity of two pounds of maize daily, and considering this  sufficient, took no further trouble about them.    Every year, at Ramadan, a large sum was distributed in alms among poor  women without distinction of sect. But Ali contrived to change this act  of benevolence into a barbarous form of amusement.    As he possessed several palaces in Janina at a considerable distance  from each other, the one at which a distribution was to take place was  each day publicly announced, and when the women had waited there for an  hour or two, exposed to sun, rain or cold, as the case might be, they  were suddenly informed that they must go to some other palace, at the  opposite end of the town. When they got there, they usually had to wait  for another hour, fortunate if they were not sent off to a third place  of meeting. When the time at length arrived, an eunuch appeared,  followed by Albanian soldiers armed with staves, carrying a bag of  money, which he threw by handfuls right into the midst of the assembly.  Then began a terrible uproar. The women rushed to catch it, upsetting  each other, quarreling, fighting, and uttering cries of terror and pain,  while the Albanians, pretending to enforce order, pushed into the crowd,  striking right and left with their batons. The pacha meanwhile sat at a  window enjoying the spectacle, and impartially applauding all well  delivered blows, no matter whence they came. During these distributions,  which really benefitted no one, many women were always severely hurt,  and some died from the blows they had received.    Ali maintained several carriages for himself and his family, but allowed  no one else to share in this prerogative. To avoid being jolted, he  simply took up the pavement in Janina and the neighbouring towns, with  the result that in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27558"],[0,"The 2003 CIA World Factbook (#14)"],[1,"kWh (2001)    Electricity - exports:    0 kWh (2001)    Electricity - imports:    200 million kWh (2001)    Oil - production:    0 bbl/day (2001 est.)

The    transition has proven difficult as corrupt governments have tried to    deal with high unemployment, a dilapidated infrastructure,    widespread gangsterism, and disruptive political opponents.    International observers judged legislative elections in 2001 to be    acceptable and a step toward democratic development, but identified    serious deficiencies that should be addressed through reforms in the    Albanian electoral code.
