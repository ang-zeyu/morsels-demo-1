He came back      to his seat, and after a few seconds of nervousness--a rare thing      with him, I fancy--said: \"I hope you both understand--of course, I      know you do; I only speak because this is an occasion for      formality--that I am willing to accept, and at once!  I do so,      believe me, not to get possession of this vast fortune, but because      of him who has given it.  The man who was fond of me, and who trusted      me, and yet had strength to keep his own feelings in check--who      followed me in spirit to far lands and desperate adventures, and who,      though he might be across the world from me, was ready to put out a      hand to save or help me, was no common man; and his care of my      mother's son meant no common love for my dear mother.  And so she and      I together accept his trust, come of it what may.  I have been      thinking it over all night, and all the time I could not get out of      the idea that mother was somewhere near me.  The only thought that      could debar me from doing as I wished to do--and intend to do--would      be that she would not approve.  Now that I am satisfied she would      approve, I accept.  Whatever may result or happen, I shall go on      following the course that he has set for me.  So help me, God!\"  Sir      Colin stood up, and I must say a more martial figure I never saw.  He      was in full uniform, for he was going on to the King's levee after      our business.  He drew his sword from the scabbard and laid it naked      on the table before Rupert, and said:        \"You are going, sir, into a strange and danger country--I have been      reading about it since we met--and you will be largely alone amongst      fierce mountaineers who resent the very presence of a stranger, and      to whom you are, and must be, one.  If you should ever be in any      trouble and want a man to stand back to back with you, I hope you      will give me the honour!\"  As he said this pointed to his sword.      Rupert and I were also standing now--one cannot sit down in the      presence of such an act as that.  \"You are, I am proud to say, allied      with my family: and I only wish to God it was closer to myself.\"      Rupert took him by the hand and bent his head before him as answered:        \"The honour is mine, Sir Colin; and no greater can come to any man      than that which you have just done me.  The best way I can show how I      value it will be to call on you if I am ever in such a tight place.      By Jove, sir, this is history repeating itself.  Aunt Janet used to      tell me when I was a youngster how MacKelpie of Croom laid his sword      before Prince Charlie.  I hope I may tell her of this; it would make      her so proud and happy.  Don't imagine, sir, that I am thinking      myself a Charles Edward.  It is only that Aunt Janet is so good to me      that I might well think I was.\"        Sir Colin bowed grandly:        \"Rupert Sent Leger, my dear niece is a woman of great discretion and      discernment.  And, moreover, I am thinking she has in her some of the      gift of Second Sight that has been a heritage of our blood.  And I am      one with my niece--in everything!\"  The whole thing was quite regal      in manner; it seemed to take me back to the days of the Pretender.        It was not, however, a time for sentiment, but for action--we had met      regarding the future, not the past; so I produced the short document      I had already prepared.  On the strength of his steadfast declaration      that he would accept the terms of the Will and the secret letters, I      had got ready a formal acceptance.  When I had once again formally      asked Mr. Sent Leger's wishes, and he had declared his wish to      accept, I got in a couple of my clerks as witnesses.        Then, having again asked him in their presence if it was his wish to      declare acceptance of the conditions, the document was signed and      witnessed, Sir Colin and I both appending our signatures to the      Attestation.        And so the first stage of Rupert Sent Leger's inheritance is      completed.  The next step will not have to be undertaken on my part      until the expiration of six months from his entry on his estate at      Vissarion.  As he announces his intention of going within a      fortnight, this will mean practically a little over six months from      now.          BOOK II: VISSARION      _Letter from Rupert Sent Leger_, _Castle of Vissarion_, _the Spear of  Ivan_, _Land of the Blue Mountains_, _to Miss Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom  Castle_, _Ross-shire_, _N.B._                                                           _January_ 23, 1907.        MY DEAREST AUNT JANET,        As you see, I am here at last.  Having got my formal duty done, as      you made me promise--my letters reporting arrival to Sir Colin and      Mr. Trent are lying sealed in front of me ready to post (for nothing      shall go before yours)--I am free to speak to you.        This is a most lovely place, and I hope you will like it.  I am quite      sure you will.  We passed it in the steamer coming from Trieste to      Durazzo.  I knew the locality from the chart, and it was pointed out      to me by one of the officers with whom I had become quite friendly,      and who kindly showed me interesting places whenever we got within      sight of shore.  The Spear of Ivan, on which the Castle stands, is a      headland running well out into the sea.  It is quite a peculiar      place--a sort of headland on a headland, jutting out into a deep,      wide bay, so that, though it is a promontory, it is as far away from      the traffic of coast life as anything you can conceive.  The main      promontory is the end of a range of mountains, and looms up vast,      towering over everything, a mass of sapphire blue.  I can well      understand how the country came to be called the \"Land of the Blue      Mountains,\" for it is all mountains, and they are all blue!  The      coast-line is magnificent--what is called \"iron-bound\"--being all      rocky; sometimes great frowning precipices; sometimes jutting spurs      of rock; again little rocky islets, now and again clad with trees and      verdure, at other places stark and bare.  Elsewhere are little rocky      bays and indentations--always rock, and often with long, interesting      caves.  Some of the shores of the bays are sandy, or else ridges of      beautiful pebbles, where the waves make endless murmur.        But of all the places I have seen--in this land or any other--the      most absolutely beautiful is Vissarion.  It stands at the ultimate      point of the promontory--I mean the little, or, rather, lesser      promontory--that continues on the spur of the mountain range.  For      the lesser promontory or extension of the mountain is in reality      vast; the lowest bit of cliff along the sea-front is not less than a      couple of hundred feet high.  That point of rock is really very      peculiar.  I think Dame Nature must, in the early days of her      housekeeping--or, rather, house-_building_--have intended to give her      little child, man, a rudimentary lesson in self-protection.  It is      just a natural bastion such as a titanic Vauban might have designed      in primeval times.  So far as the Castle is concerned, it is alone      visible from the sea.  Any enemy approaching could see only that      frowning wall of black rock, of vast height and perpendicular      steepness.  Even the old fortifications which crown it are not built,      but cut in the solid rock.  A long narrow creek of very deep water,      walled in by high, steep cliffs, runs in behind the Castle, bending      north and west, making safe and secret anchorage.  Into the creek      falls over a precipice a mountain-stream, which never fails in volume      of water.  On the western shore of that creek is the Castle, a huge      pile of buildings of every style of architecture, from the Twelfth      century to where such things seemed to stop in this dear old-world      land--about the time of Queen Elizabeth.  So it is pretty      picturesque.  I can tell you.  When we got the first glimpse of the      place from the steamer the officer, with whom I was on the bridge,      pointed towards it and said:        \"That is where we saw the dead woman floating in a coffin.\"  That was      rather interesting, so I asked him all about it.  He took from his      pocket-book a cutting from an Italian paper, which he handed to me.      As I can read and speak Italian fairly well, it was all right; but as      you, my dear Aunt Janet, are not skilled in languages, and as I doubt      if there is any assistance of the kind to be had at Croom, I do not      send it.  But as I have heard that the item has been produced in the      last number of _The Journal of Occultism_, you will be easily able to      get it.  As he handed me the cutting he said: \"I am Destilia!\"  His      story was so strange that I asked him a good many questions about it.      He answered me quite frankly on every point, but always adhering      stoutly to the main point--namely, that it was no phantom or mirage,      no dream or imperfect vision in a fog.  \"We were four in all who saw      it,\" he said--\"three from the bridge and the Englishman,      Caulfield--from the bows--whose account exactly agreed with what we      saw.  Captain Mirolani and Falamano and I were all awake and in good      trim.  We looked with our night-glasses, which are more than usually      powerful.  You know, we need good glasses for the east shore of the      Adriatic and for among the islands to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31"],[0,"Plays of Sophocles: Oedipus the King; Oedipus at Colonus; Antigone (#14)"],[1,"the gale,  Up and still upwards to sail       And gaze on the fray from the clouds above.

Hear us, Zeus, and hear us, child  Of Zeus, Athene undefiled,  Hear, Apollo, hunter, hear,  Huntress, sister of Apollo,  Who the dappled swift-foot deer  O'er the wooded glade dost follow;  Help with your two-fold power  Athens in danger's hour!  O wayfarer, thou wilt not have to tax  The friends who watch for thee with false presage,  For lo, an escort with the maids draws near.  [Enter ANTIGONE and ISMENE with THESEUS]    OEDIPUS  Where, where? what sayest thou?    ANTIGONE                                O father, father,  Would that some god might grant thee eyes to see  This best of men who brings us back again.    OEDIPUS  My child! and are ye back indeed!    ANTIGONE                                     Yes, saved  By Theseus and his gallant followers.    OEDIPUS  Come to your father's arms, O let me feel  A child's embrace I never hoped for more.    ANTIGONE  Thou askest what is doubly sweet to give.    OEDIPUS  Where are ye then?    ANTIGONE                      We come together both.    OEDIPUS  My precious nurslings!    ANTIGONE                           Fathers aye were fond.    OEDIPUS  Props of my age!    ANTIGONE                 So sorrow sorrow props.    OEDIPUS  I have my darlings, and if death should come,  Death were not wholly bitter with you near.  Cling to me, press me close on either side,  There rest ye from your dreary wayfaring.  Now tell me of your ventures, but in brief;  Brief speech suffices for young maids like you.    ANTIGONE  Here is our savior; thou should'st hear the tale  From his own lips; so shall my part be brief.    OEDIPUS  I pray thee do not wonder if the sight  Of children, given o'er for lost, has made  My converse somewhat long and tedious.  Full well I know the joy I have of them  Is due to thee, to thee and no man else;  Thou wast their sole deliverer, none else.  The gods deal with thee after my desire,  With thee and with this land! for fear of heaven  I found above all peoples most with you,  And righteousness and lips that cannot lie.  I speak in gratitude of what I know,  For all I have I owe to thee alone.  Give me thy hand, O Prince, that I may touch it,  And if thou wilt permit me, kiss thy cheek.  What say I?  Can I wish that thou should'st touch  One fallen like me to utter wretchedness,  Corrupt and tainted with a thousand ills?  Oh no, I would not let thee if thou would'st.  They only who have known calamity  Can share it.  Let me greet thee where thou art,  And still befriend me as thou hast till now.    THESEUS  I marvel not if thou hast dallied long  In converse with thy children and preferred  Their speech to mine; I feel no jealousy,  I would be famous more by deeds than words.  Of this, old friend, thou hast had proof; my oath  I have fulfilled and brought thee back the maids  Alive and nothing harmed for all those threats.  And how the fight was won, 'twere waste of words  To boast--thy daughters here will tell thee all.  But of a matter that has lately chanced  On my way hitherward, I fain would have  Thy counsel--slight 'twould seem, yet worthy thought.  A wise man heeds all matters great or small.    OEDIPUS  What is it, son of Aegeus?  Let me hear.  Of what thou askest I myself know naught.    THESEUS  'Tis said a man, no countryman of thine,  But of thy kin, hath taken sanctuary  Beside the altar of Poseidon, where  I was at sacrifice when called away.    OEDIPUS  What is his country? what the suitor's prayer?    THESEUS  I know but one thing; he implores, I am told,  A word with thee--he will not trouble thee.    OEDIPUS  What seeks he?  If a suppliant, something grave.    THESEUS  He only waits, they say, to speak with thee,  And then unharmed to go upon his way.    OEDIPUS  I marvel who is this petitioner.    THESEUS  Think if there be not any of thy kin  At Argos who might claim this boon of thee.    OEDIPUS  Dear friend, forbear, I pray.    THESEUS                                What ails thee now?    OEDIPUS  Ask it not of me.    THESEUS                      Ask not what? explain.    OEDIPUS  Thy words have told me who the suppliant is.    THESEUS  Who can he be that I should frown on him?    OEDIPUS  My son, O king, my hateful son, whose words  Of all men's most would jar upon my ears.    THESEUS  Thou sure mightest listen.  If his suit offend,  No need to grant it.  Why so loth to hear him?    OEDIPUS  That voice, O king, grates on a father's ears;  I have come to loathe it.  Force me not to yield.    THESEUS  But he hath found asylum.  O beware,  And fail not in due reverence to the god.    ANTIGONE  O heed me, father, though I am young in years.  Let the prince have his will and pay withal  What in his eyes is service to the god;  For our sake also let our brother come.  If what he urges tend not to thy good  He cannot surely wrest perforce thy will.  To hear him then, what harm?  By open words  A scheme of villainy is soon bewrayed.  Thou art his father, therefore canst not pay  In kind a son's most impious outrages.  O listen to him; other men like thee  Have thankless children and are choleric,  But yielding to persuasion's gentle spell  They let their savage mood be exorcised.  Look thou to the past, forget the present, think  On all the woe thy sire and mother brought thee;  Thence wilt thou draw this lesson without fail,  Of evil passion evil is the end.  Thou hast, alas, to prick thy memory,  Stern monitors, these ever-sightless orbs.  O yield to us; just suitors should not need  To be importunate, nor he that takes  A favor lack the grace to make return.    OEDIPUS  Grievous to me, my child, the boon ye win  By pleading.  Let it be then; have your way  Only if come he must, I beg thee, friend,  Let none have power to dispose of me.    THESEUS  No need, Sir, to appeal a second time.  It likes me not to boast, but be assured  Thy life is safe while any god saves mine.  [Exit THESEUS]    CHORUS  (Str.)  Who craves excess of days,            Scorning the common span            Of life, I judge that man  A giddy wight who walks in folly's ways.  For the long years heap up a grievous load,            Scant pleasures, heavier pains,            Till not one joy remains  For him who lingers on life's weary road       And come it slow or fast,            One doom of fate            Doth all await,            For dance and marriage bell,            The dirge and funeral knell.  Death the deliverer freeth all at last.  (Ant.)            Not to be born at all            Is best, far best that can befall,            Next best, when born, with least delay            To trace the backward way.  For when youth passes with its giddy train,       Troubles on troubles follow, toils on toils,            Pain, pain for ever pain;            And none escapes life's coils.            Envy, sedition, strife,  Carnage and war, make up the tale of life.  Last comes the worst and most abhorred stage            Of unregarded age,  Joyless, companionless and slow,            Of woes the crowning woe.    (Epode)  Such ills not I alone,  He too our guest hath known,  E'en as some headland on an iron-bound shore,  Lashed by the wintry blasts and surge's roar,  So is he buffeted on every side  By drear misfortune's whelming tide,            By every wind of heaven o'erborne            Some from the sunset, some from orient morn,            Some from the noonday glow.  Some from Rhipean gloom of everlasting snow.    ANTIGONE  Father, methinks I see the stranger coming,  Alone he comes and weeping plenteous tears.    OEDIPUS  Who may he be?    ANTIGONE                 The same that we surmised.  From the outset--Polyneices.  He is here.  [Enter POLYNEICES]    POLYNEICES  Ah me, my sisters, shall I first lament  My own afflictions, or my aged sire's,  Whom here I find a castaway, with you,  In a strange land, an ancient beggar clad  In antic tatters, marring all his frame,  While o'er the sightless orbs his unkept locks  Float in the breeze; and, as it were to match,  He bears a wallet against hunger's pinch.  All this too late I learn, wretch that I am,  Alas!  I own it, and am proved most vile  In my neglect of thee:  I scorn myself.  But as almighty Zeus in all he doth  Hath Mercy for co-partner of this throne,  Let Mercy, father, also sit enthroned  In thy heart likewise.  For transgressions past  May be amended, cannot be made worse.    Why silent?  Father, speak, nor turn away,  Hast thou no word, wilt thou dismiss me then  In mute disdain, nor tell me why thou art wrath?  O ye his daughters, sisters mine, do ye  This sullen, obstinate silence try to move.  Let him not spurn, without a single word  Of answer, me the suppliant of the god.    ANTIGONE  Tell him thyself, unhappy one, thine errand;  For large discourse may send a thrill of joy,  Or stir a chord of wrath or tenderness,  And to the tongue-tied somehow give a tongue.    POLYNEICES  Well dost thou counsel, and I will speak out.  First will I call in aid the god himself,  Poseidon, from whose altar I was raised,  With warrant from the monarch of this land,  To parley with you, and depart unscathed.  These pledges, strangers, I would see observed  By you and by my sisters and my sire.  Now, father, let me tell thee why I came.  I have been banished from my native land  Because by right of primogeniture  I claimed possession of thy sovereign throne  Wherefrom Etocles, my younger brother,  Ousted me, not by weight of precedent,  Nor by the last arbitrament of war,  But by his popular acts; and the prime cause  Of this I deem the curse that rests on thee.  So likewise hold the soothsayers, for when  I came to Argos in the Dorian land  And took the king Adrastus' child to wife,  Under my standard I enlisted all  The foremost captains of the Apian isle,  To levy with"]]]
