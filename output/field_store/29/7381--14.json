In this equation the mass of the ball, _B_, the length of the plumb  line, _l_, the distance between the center of the ball and the center of  the plumb bob, _r_, and the radius of the earth, _R_, can all be  measured directly, and _d_, the amount by which the plumb bob is pulled  to one side by the ball, is readily found by shifting the ball over to  the other side, at _2_, and measuring with a microscope how far the  plumb bob moves. This distance will, of course, be equal to _2 d_.    By methods involving these principles, but applied in a manner more  complicated as well as more precise, the mass of the earth is found to  be, in tons, 6,642 × 10^{18}--i. e., 6,642 followed by 18 ciphers, or in  kilogrammes 60,258 × 10^{20}. The earth's atmosphere makes up about a  millionth part of this mass.    If the length of the plumb line were 100 feet, the weight of the ball a  ton, and the distance between the two positions of the ball, _1_ and  _2_, six feet, how many inches, _d_, would the plumb bob be pulled out  of place?    Find from the mass of the earth and the data of § 40 the mass of the sun  in tons. Find also the mass of Mars. The computation can be very greatly  abridged by the use of logarithms.    46. PRECESSION.--That the earth is isolated in space and has no support  upon which to rest, is sufficiently shown by the fact that the stars are  visible upon every side of it, and no support can be seen stretching out  toward them. We must then consider the earth to be a globe traveling  freely about the sun in a circuit which it completes once every year,  and rotating once in every twenty-four hours about an axis which remains  at all seasons directed very nearly toward the star Polaris. The student  should be able to show from his own observations of the sun that, with  reference to the stars, the direction of the sun from the earth changes  about a degree a day. Does this prove that the earth revolves about the  sun?    But it is only in appearance that the pole maintains its fixed position  among the stars. If photographs are taken year after year, after the  manner of Exercise 7, it will be found that slowly the pole is moving  (nearly) toward Polaris, and making this star describe a smaller and  smaller circle in its diurnal path, while stars on the other side of the  pole (in right ascension 12h.) become more distant from it and describe  larger circles in their diurnal motion; but the process takes place so  slowly that the space of a lifetime is required for the motion of the  pole to equal the angular diameter of the full moon.    Spin a top and note how its rapid whirl about its axis corresponds to  the earth's diurnal rotation. When the axis about which the top spins is  truly vertical the top \"sleeps\"; but if the axis is tipped ever so  little away from the vertical it begins to wobble, so that if we imagine  the axis prolonged out to the sky and provided with a pencil point as a  marker, this would trace a circle around the zenith, along which the  pole of the top would move, and a little observation will show that the  more the top is tipped from the vertical the larger does this circle  become and the more rapidly does the wobbling take place. Were it not  for the spinning of the top about its axis, it would promptly fall over  when tipped from the vertical position, but the spin combines with the  force which pulls the top over and produces the wobbling motion. Spin  the top in opposite directions, with the hands of a watch and contrary  to the hands of a watch, and note the effect which is produced upon the  wobbling.    The earth presents many points of resemblance to the top. Its diurnal  rotation is the spin about the axis. This axis is tipped 23.5° away from  the perpendicular to its orbit (obliquity of the ecliptic) just as the  axis of the top is tipped away from the vertical line. In consequence of  its rapid spin, the body of the earth bulges out at the equator (27  miles), and the sun and moon, by virtue of their attraction (see Chapter  IV), lay hold of this protuberance and pull it down toward the plane of  the earth's orbit, so that if it were not for the spin this force would  straighten the axis up and set it perpendicular to the orbit plane. But  here, as in the case of the top, the spin and the tipping force combine  to produce a wobble which is called precession, and whose effect we  recognize in the shifting position of the pole among the stars. The  motion of precession is very much slower than the wobbling of the top,  since the tipping force for the earth is relatively very small, and a  period of nearly 26,000 years is required for a complete circuit of the  pole about its center of motion. Friction ultimately stops both the spin  and the wobble of the top, but this influence seems wholly absent in the  case of the earth, and both rotation and precession go on unchanged from  century to century, save for certain minor forces which for a time  change the direction or rate of the precessional motion, first in one  way and then in another, without in the long run producing any results  of consequence.    The center of motion, about which the pole travels in a small circle  having an angular radius of 23.5°, is at that point of the heavens  toward which a perpendicular to the plane of the earth's orbit points,  and may be found on the star map in right ascension 18h. 0m. and  declination 66.5°.    EXERCISE 20.--Find this point on the map, and draw as well as you can  the path of the pole about it. The motion of the pole along its path is  toward the constellation Cepheus. Mark the position of the pole along  this path at intervals of 1,000 years, and refer to these positions in  dealing with some of the following questions:    Does the wobbling of the top occur in the same direction as the motion  of precession? Do the tipping forces applied to the earth and top act in  the same direction? What will be the polar star 12,000 years hence? The  Great Pyramid of Egypt is thought to have been used as an observatory  when Alpha Draconis was the bright star nearest the pole. How long ago  was that?    The motion of the pole of course carries the equator and the equinoxes  with it, and thus slowly changes the right ascensions and declinations  of all the stars. On this account it is frequently called the precession  of the equinoxes, and this motion of the equinox, slow though it is, is  a matter of some consequence in connection with chronology and the  length of the year.    Will the precession ever bring back the right ascensions and  declinations to be again what they now are?    In what direction is the pole moving with respect to the Big Dipper?  Will its motion ever bring it exactly to Polaris? How far away from  Polaris will the precession carry the pole? What other bright stars will  be brought near the pole by the precession?    47. THE WARMING OF THE EARTH.--Winter and summer alike the day is on the  average warmer than the night, and it is easy to see that this surplus  of heat comes from the sun by day and is lost by night through radiation  into the void which surrounds the earth; just as the heat contained in a  mass of molten iron is radiated away and the iron cooled when it is  taken out from the furnace and placed amid colder surroundings. The  earth's loss of heat by radiation goes on ceaselessly day and night,  and were it not for the influx of solar heat this radiation would  steadily diminish the temperature toward what is called the \"absolute  zero\"--i. e., a state in which all heat has been taken away and beyond  which there can be no greater degree of cold. This must not be  confounded with the zero temperatures shown by our thermometers,  since it lies nearly 500° below the zero of the Fahrenheit scale (-273°  Centigrade), a temperature which by comparison makes the coldest winter  weather seem warm, although the ordinary thermometer may register  many degrees below its zero. The heat radiated by the sun into the  surrounding space on every side of it is another example of the same  cooling process, a hot body giving up its heat to the colder space about  it, and it is the minute fraction of this heat poured out by the sun,  and in small part intercepted by the earth, which warms the latter and  produces what we call weather, climate, the seasons, etc.    Observe the fluctuations, the ebb and flow, which are inherent in this  process. From sunset to sunrise there is nothing to compensate the  steady outflow of heat, and air and ground grow steadily colder, but  with the sunrise there comes an influx of solar heat, feeble at first  because it strikes the earth's surface very obliquely, but becoming more  and more efficient as the sun rises higher in the sky. But as the air  and the ground grow warm during the morning hours they part more and  more readily and rapidly with their store of heat, just as a steam pipe  or a cup of coffee radiates heat more rapidly when very hot. The warmest  hour of the day is reached when these opposing tendencies of income and  expenditure of heat are just balanced; and barring such disturbing  factors as wind and clouds, the gain in temperature usually extends to  the time--an hour or two beyond noon--at which the diminishing altitude  of the sun renders his rays less efficient, when radiation gains the  upper hand and the temperature becomes for a short time stationary, and  then commences to fall steadily until the next sunrise.    We have here an example of what is called a periodic change--i. e., one  which, within a definite and uniform period (24 hours), oscillates from  a minimum up to a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34848"],[0,"Mammals of the San Gabriel Mountains of California (#14)"],[1,"Skunk    The populations of striped skunks in the San Gabriels center around  cultivated land at the Pacific foot of the range. Citrus groves, grape  vineyards, and areas once cleared by man are preferred to coastal  sagebrush flats. The cultivated areas now probably support many more  skunks than were there under original conditions. I have many sight  records of striped skunks which I obtained while driving through the  citrus groves at night. Only once was the striped skunk noted in the  chaparral; all the other records were from the coastal sagebrush belt.    In addition to insects and small mammals, grapes are eaten regularly by  skunks in vineyards, and the fruit of the prickly-pear cactus is often  eaten. Near the mouth of Thompson Canyon feces examined in October 1948,  contained almost exclusively the remains of prickly-pear fruit.    A male taken one-half mile south of Devore weighed five pounds and four  ounces.        _Specimens examined_, 2: San Bernardino County: 1/2 mi. S      Devore, 2200 ft., 1. Los Angeles County: 3 mi. N Claremont, 1500      ft., 1 (PC).      =Spilogale gracilis microrhina= Hall    Spotted Skunk    Spotted skunks are common locally in the coastal sage scrub association  and lower chaparral association on the coastal face of the mountains,  mainly between 1000 and 4000 feet elevation; but they have been reported  from Icehouse Canyon at 5000 feet, and I took one above the mouth of  this canyon at 5500 feet elevation. A few spotted skunks may inhabit the  lower desert slope of the mountains; here feces thought to be those of  spotted skunks have been found, and a bobcat trapped near the head of  Grandview Canyon smelled strongly of skunk.    The spotted skunk usually was in rocky habitats. In the sage flats, sign  (mostly feces and tracks) usually was near rock piles and around human  developments such as rock walls, old outbuildings and houses. Specimens  taken in the chaparral were trapped near granite outcroppings.    In the autumn of 1950, at my house near the mouth of Palmer Canyon, a  family of spotted skunks lived under the floors. Night after night they  scratched under the floor and chattered in high-pitched rasping notes,  and on several evenings one walked complacently into the living room. It  finally became necessary to trap and deport most of these skunks. In  all, nine skunks were trapped; these probably represented more than the  original residents. One male was descented and allowed to remain. It  spent most of the daylight hours asleep in an old shower room where the  many gaps between the rock work and the boards allowed him entrance.  Through no special efforts on our part he became tame enough to climb  over us in order to get food left on the kitchen sink, and he would eat  calmly while we sat only inches away from him.    Feces from sage areas contained mostly remains of insects and small  rodents whereas many samples of feces from chaparral areas contained, in  addition, shells of snails. Feces examined represent all months of the  year.        _Specimens examined._--Los Angeles County: mouth of San Antonio      Canyon, 2 (PC).      Family CANIDAE      =Canis latrans ochropus= Eschscholtz    Coyote    Coyotes inhabit the sagebrush flats and foothills up to at least 4000  feet all along the Pacific base of the San Gabriels. This species seems  most common at the foot of the range where large dry washes prevent  man from occupying the land immediately adjacent to the foothills, and  are the dominant carnivores of the coastal sage belt. Repeated  observations have indicated that although many individuals range into  the higher foothills they seldom are found deep in the major canyons or  chaparral slopes. Coyotes rarely occur at 3000 or 4000 feet in San  Antonio Canyon where it cuts into the realm of heavy chaparral; yet on  steep foothill slopes and ridges, which are adjacent to the flat land,  these animals range up to at least 4000 feet. Being hunters primarily of  rather open land many coyotes go into the foothills only to find daytime  refuge, traveling down dirt roads, ridges, and firebreaks, to forage at  night in the sage flats. Coyote feces from the foothills, at about 3500  feet, contained predominantly the remains of such food items as  cottontails, chickens, and jack rabbits. These animals could have been  found only in the flats. This is additional evidence that coyotes do the  major part of their hunting at the base of the range.    Observations of coyote tracks and trapping records have shown that these  animals hunt mostly in the more open parts of the sage flats. Coyotes  frequent areas of scattered brush, sandy areas, wash channels, and old  roads, and seemingly shun dense brush. Many coyotes actually hunt for  rabbits in the citrus groves near the foothills. On several evenings I  traced their howling to orange groves, and Mr. Kenneth Hill of Upland  told me of often seeing coyotes in his orange groves at night.    The forage beats of several coyotes were discovered in connection with  trapping specimens of these animals. In January, 1952, two coyotes,  probably a mated pair, traveled nightly from the slopes immediately west  of Evey Canyon, at about 3100 feet, down into the sagebrush adjacent to  the west side of San Antonio Wash, at about 1700 feet elevation. The  route led down open ridges, then for about one half mile across a level,  cultivated plateau, and then swung over the eroded banks near the  lowermost point of the plateau onto the level sage flats. The distance  covered by this route from the foothills down to the flats was somewhat  more than a mile, with about a 1400 foot difference in elevation between  the daytime retreat and the nocturnal forage area. Another route,  seemingly used by only one coyote, was somewhat longer. This animal  followed fire breaks and ridges from above Thompson Canyon down onto a  fire road, and then into the lower end of Palmer Canyon where it entered  the flats. This route covered about three miles in coming from the  foothills to the flats. Feces of this coyote often contained the  remains of white leghorn chickens which had been found at a refuse pile  near several chicken ranches one-half mile from the base of Palmer  Canyon.    Although no definite idea could be gained of the population density of  coyotes in the area, it was clear that in certain localities they were,  as carnivores go, abundant. After one large male was obtained in the  flats at the base of Cobal Canyon, at least two other individuals were  heard howling in this immediate area, and their tracks were noted  repeatedly on dirt roads. One night early in January, 1952, immediately  west of the head of San Antonio Wash, the voices of six coyotes could be  picked out separately from a chorus of coyote howls which came from  several different directions in the wash.    Many field examinations of coyote feces left the impression that  chickens and lagomorphs made up the bulk of the coyote's food on the  coastal slope. To check this a study of 39 sets of scats collected at  various localities on the coastal slope was made in the laboratory, the  results being shown in Table 10. Remains of one of the three species of  rabbits, cottontails, jack rabbits, or brush rabbits, occurred in 72 per  cent of the feces examined. Cottontails, it will be noted, were preyed  upon more heavily than any other wild species, remains of this form  being found in 33 per cent of the feces. The prevalence of chicken  remains in coyote feces does not imply that these animals were killed by  the coyotes. All of the chickens could have been found dead in the  refuse piles of the many chicken ranches. In addition, the chickens were  raised in wire cages above the ground where they were nearly  invulnerable to predation. That coyotes may at times kill deer in this  area was suggested by the finding of tracks in the sand in San Antonio  Wash which clearly indicated that a deer had been closely pursued by a  coyote. The tracks were lost in a stretch of brush so the outcome of the  chase could not be determined. Near the mouth of Lytle Creek Canyon, in  November, 1951, coyote feces contained mostly remains of grapes from  nearby vineyards. Also, above Cucamonga, coyotes were found to be  feeding heavily on grapes. This must be a rather unsuitable form of  nourishment for coyotes, for many of the grapes in the feces appeared  nearly unaltered despite their trip through the alimentary canal.
