The species thus has two broods each year and passes the winter only  in the chrysalis state.    These beautiful butterflies are likely to be found in the sort of  situations where the food plants of the larvae are growing. Open  groves, the borders of woods, and the margins of streams or marshes  are the places where one is most likely to find spice bush and  sassafras. These are the places to look for these butterflies which  one may often see in graceful flight near the ground, pausing now and  then to seek a sassafras leaf or to sip the nectar from a flower.       =The Tiger Swallowtail=    _Papilio glaucus_    One of the many things that make a study of the life-histories of  butterflies of great interest is the variations in the development of  many of the species. One who follows the simplest life-story of a  butterfly and sees the egg change to larva and the larva change in  size and form and color with each successive moult and then change  again into the seemingly inert chrysalis, from which there finally  comes the winged butterfly--unlike the egg, unlike the larva, unlike  the chrysalis--a creature of perfect beauty, wonderfully adapted to  living freely in the air and sipping ambrosial nectar from the  flowers--one who follows these changes with awakened vision can  scarcely fail to have a sense of wonder as to the laws that govern  such intricate phenomena. But the marvel is still more pronounced in  the case of those butterflies which have two or more forms arising  from the same lot of eggs in a way which science has as yet not  adequately explained.    The splendid Tiger Swallowtail is an example of this dimorphism which  is of especial interest because of the fact that the extra form is  confined to one sex and to only a part of the geographical area over  which the butterfly is found. The species occurs over a very large  part of the North American continent, being found from ocean to ocean  and from Canada to Florida. In the region north of approximately the  fortieth degree of latitude there is but one form of the insect--the  familiar yellow-and-black striped butterfly which every one has seen  visiting the lilac blossoms in May or June. South of this, however,  part of the females take on an entirely different appearance, being  almost wholly black with the hind wings touched with lines of blue and  bordered with crescents of yellow and orange. The curious thing about  it is that a certain mother butterfly may lay a dozen eggs part of  which will develop into the usual yellow form and the rest into the  black form, both lots being of the same sex. This black form is so  entirely distinct in appearance that the two were originally described  as separate species, and they were long considered such, until  breeding experiments determined the precise condition. (_See plate,  page 17._)    This species is of interest also for another reason. The caterpillars  during their later life are remarkable examples of that curious  resemblance to the head of a serpent which is thought to have a real  protective value in frightening away attacking birds and possibly  other enemies. The rings of the body just back of the head are much  swollen and on the top of the swollen part there are two large  circular marks which bear a striking resemblance to eyes. When the  insect is at rest it withdraws its head and holds up the front of the  body in such a way as certainly to suggest at the first glance that  one is looking at the head of a small snake, an impression which is  likely to be enhanced when the caterpillar pushes out the curious  yellow scent organs from the ring near the top of the head, these  organs taking on the forked appearance of a snake's tongue.    Obviously it is exceedingly difficult to get definite observations  under natural conditions to determine whether these seeming  resemblances are really of value to the caterpillar in frightening  away birds or other enemies. About the only direct evidence which I  have come across upon this point is found in this paragraph by Dr. J.  L. Hancock:    \"When I recall the first sight of this larva, the impression gained of  it was a most curious one. The forward mask-like face was remarkably  startling. This mask, bearing eye-like spots and the light transverse  ridge, gave it an aspect which might easily be mistaken for real eyes  and a mouth. This contrivance is only a false face in no way connected  with the real eyes and mouth. One might imagine the shock that a bird,  or other predaceous enemy, would experience when looking upon this  grinning mask. This is in reality the effect produced, for I have seen  small birds so alarmed that they lost their appetite and curiosity for  these larvae after a brief glance at them. It is certain that these  singular markings have the effect of terrifying their bird  enemies.\"[B]       [B] \"Nature Sketches in Temperate America,\" p. 146.    The yearly cycle of the Tiger Swallowtail is much like that of the  related species. It passes the winter as a chrysalis, the butterflies  coming forth just about the time that the lilacs bloom. They remain  upon the wing for a few weeks and deposit their eggs upon a great  variety of trees and shrubs, for the food plants of the larvae are  unusually varied and include tulip trees, birches, wild cherries,  apples, poplars, ash, and several other common trees or shrubs. These  eggs soon hatch into caterpillars that feed upon the leaves and make  for themselves resting places by spinning a web of silk transversely  across the surface of the leaf. They remain upon these silken webs  when not feeding and in later life are likely to cause the leaf on  which the web is made to curl into a partial tube. When fully  developed they change to chrysalids which give forth the summer brood  of butterflies in July and August. These in turn lay eggs for the  caterpillars which change to chrysalids in autumn and remain in that  condition until the following spring.       =The Short-tailed Papilio=    _Papilio brevicauda_    Were one enough of a magician to make one butterfly over into another  it would be comparatively easy to take a Black Swallowtail and  transform it into this species. One would only need to trim off the  long tails so that they project very slightly from the angles of the  hind wings and to change the yellow spots to orange. He would thus  accomplish what Nature through the long ages seems to have  accomplished in a limited northern area in Newfoundland and around the  Gulf of St. Lawrence, for the Short-tailed Papilio is confined chiefly  to this region, where it lives a life very similar to that of the  Black Swallowtail. The caterpillar feeds upon the leaves of various  members of the parsley family and is said to have learned to warm  itself during the middle of the day by resting upon stones and gravel  which have absorbed the sun's heat rays. Presumably there is but one  brood a year and the insect hibernates as a chrysalis.       =The Palamedes Swallowtail=    _Papilio palamedes_    If the magician who had succeeded in converting a Black Swallowtail  into the Short-tailed Papilio wished to try his hand on making a  Palamedes Swallowtail he could not do better than to use again the  same black butterfly. He would only need to make it about one half  larger, retaining practically all its color markings and the outline  of its wings and tail. For this species bears a remarkable resemblance  to the Black Swallowtail, seeming to be a giant variety induced by the  warmth of the southern climate where it lives, and possibly by the  more generous supply of the magnolia and sassafras leaves upon which  the caterpillars feed.    This species is distinctly a southern form occurring as far west as  the Mississippi River throughout the more Southern states. As one  would expect in the long seasons and warm climate of this region there  are several broods each year and the caterpillars often hibernate as  well as the chrysalids. The adult butterflies are lovers of the sun  and are said to roost at night upon the tops of live oak and palmetto  trees.       =The Zebra Swallowtail=    _Iphiclides ajax_    Most of our Swallowtail butterflies are so distinctive in form and  colors that they are easily distinguished from one another, but the  Zebra species is so different from all the rest that when it is once  seen it is likely always to be remembered. The striking combination of  green and black stripes with very long tails, set off by beautiful  crescents of blue and of red, at once distinguishes this fine  butterfly in any of its varying forms.    Three distinct forms of this species occur, namely:    _Marcellus_, the early spring form, small in size with short tails,  that show white only on the tips;    _Telamonides_, the late spring form, somewhat larger, with tails a  little longer and showing more white on the outer half;    _Ajax_, the summer form, decidedly larger with tails very long.    It would be a comparatively simple matter to understand these forms if  they were simply seasonal variations, with three broods, each form  succeeding the other as the season advances. But this is far from  being the case. We have instead the most complicated and confusing  series of conditions imaginable--conditions for which no one has yet  given satisfactory explanations.    To make a fairly clear statement of what happens, suppose we assume  that we start with twenty over-wintering chrysalids. In April ten of  these disclose their butterflies which are Marcellus, the early spring  form. In May the other ten disclose their butterflies which are  Telamonides, the late spring form. We thus have these two forms,  appearing successively in spring from the same set of over-wintering  chrysalids.    After flying about for a short time the Marcellus or early spring  Swallowtails lay eggs upon the leaves of papaw trees or "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3708"],[0,"An Introduction to Chemical Science (#14)"],[1,"produce death, and five per cent  produces drowsiness. It exists in minute portions in the  atmosphere, and often accumulates at the bottom of old wells and  caverns, owing to its slow diffusive power. Before going down  into one of these, the air should always be tested by lowering a  lighted candle. If this is extinguished, there is danger. CO2 is  the deadly \"choke damp\" after a mine explosion, CH4 being  converted into CO2 and H2O; a great deal is liberated during  volcanic eruptions, and it is formed in breathing by the union of  O in the air with C in the system. This union of C and O takes  place in the lungs and in all the tissues of the body, even on  the surface. Oxygen is taken into the lungs, passes through the  thin membrane into the blood, forms a weak chemical union with  the red corpuscles, and is conveyed by them to all parts of the  system. Throughout the body, wherever necessary, C and H are  supplied for the O, and unite with it to form CO2 and H2O. These  are taken up by the blood though they do not form a chemical  union with it, are carried to the lungs, and pass out, together  with the unused N and surplus O. The system is thus purified, and  the waste must be supplied by food. The process also keeps up the  heat of the body as really as the combustion of C or P in O  produces heat. The temperature of the body does not vary much  from 99 degrees F., any excess of heat passing off through  perspiration, and being changed into other forms of energy.    If, as in some fevers, the temperature rises above about 105  degrees F., the blood corpuscles are killed, and the person dies.  During violent exercise much material is consumed, circulation is  rapid, and quick breathing ensues. Oxygen is necessary for life.  A healthy person inhales plentifully; and this element is one of  nature's best remedies for disease. Deep and continued  inhalations in cold weather are better than furnace fires to heat  the system. All animals breathe O and exhale CO2. Fishes and  other aquatic animals obtain it, not by decomposing H2O, but from  air dissolved in water. Being cold-blooded, they need relatively  little; but if no fresh water is supplied to those in captivity,  they soon die of O starvation.    124. Oxidation in Water.--Swift-running streams are clear and  comparatively pure, because their organic  impurities are  constantly brought to the surface and oxidized, whereas in  stagnant pools these impurities accumulate. Reservoirs of water  for city supply have sometimes been freed from impurities by  aeration, i.e. by forcing air into the water.    125. Deoxidation in Plants.--Since CO2 is so constantly poured  into the atmosphere, why does it not accumulate there in large  quantity? Why is there not less free O in the air to-day than  there was a thousand years ago? The answer to these questions is  found in the growth of vegetation. In the leaf of every plant are  thousands of little chemical laboratories; CO2 diffused in small  quantities in the air passes, together with a very little H2O,  into the leaf, usually from its under side, and is decomposed by  the radiant energy of the sun. The C is built into the woody  fiber of the tree, and the O is ready to be re-breathed or burned  again. CO2 contributes to the growth of plants, O to that of  animals; and the constituents of the atmosphere vary little from  one age to another. The compensation of nature is here well  shown. Plants feed upon what animals discard, transforming it  into material for the sustenance of the latter, while animals  prepare food for plants. All the C in plants is supposed to come  from the CO2 in the atmosphere. Animals obtain their supply from  plants. The utility of the small percentage of CO2 in the air is  thus seen.    126. Uses.--CO2 is used in making \"soda-water,\" and in chemical  engines to put out fires in their early stages. In either case it  may be prepared by treating Na2CO3 or CaCO3 with H2SO4. Give the  reactions. On a small scale CO2 is made from HNaCO3. CO2 has a  very weak affinity for water, but probably forms with it H2CO3.  Much carbon dioxide can be forced into water under pressure. This  forms soda-water, which really contains no soda. The  justification for the name is the material from which it is  sometimes made. Salts from H2CO3, called carbonates, are  numerous, Na2CO3 and CaCO3 being the most important.    Chapter XXVI.    OZONE.    127. Preparation.    Experiment 78.--Scrape off the oxide from the surface of a piece  of phosphorus 2 cm long, put it into a wide-mouthed bottle, half  cover the P with water, cover the bottle with a glass, and leave  it for half an hour or more.    128. Tests.    Experiment 79.--Remove the glass cover, smell the gas, and hold  in it some wet iodo-starch paper. Look for any blue color. Iodine  has been set free, according to the reaction, 2 KI + 03= K20 + O2  + I2, and has imparted a blue color to the starch, and ordinary  oxygen has been formed. Why will not oxygen set iodine free from  KI?. What besides ozone will liberate it?    129. Ozone, oxidized oxygen, active oxygen, etc., is an  allotropic form of O. Its molecule is 03, while that of ordinary  oxygen is 02.    Three atoms of oxygen are condensed into the space of two atoms  of ozone, or three molecules of O are condensed into two  molecules of ozone, or three liters of O are condensed into two  liters of ozone. Ozone is thus formed by oxidizing ordinary  oxygen. 02 + O = 03. This takes place during thunder storms and  in artificial electrical discharges. The quantity of ozone  produced is small, five per cent being the maximum, and the usual  quantity is far less than that.    Ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent, and will change S, P, and As  into their ic acids. Cotton cloth was formerly bleached, and  linen is now bleached, by spreading it on the grass and leaving  it for weeks to be acted on by ozone, which is usually present in  the air in small quantities, especially in the country. Ozone is  a disinfectant, like other bleaching agents, and serves to clear  the air of noxious gases and germs of infectious diseases. So  much ozone is reduced in this way that the air of cities contains  less of it than country air. A third is consumed in uniting with  the substance which it oxidizes, while two-thirds are changed  into oxygen, as in Experiment 79.    It is unhealthful to breathe much ozone, but a little in the air  is desirable for disinfection.    Ozone will cause the inert N of the air to unite with H, to form  ammonia. No other agent capable of doing this is known, so that  all the NH3 in the air, in fact all ammonium compounds taken up  by plants from soils and fertilizers, may have been made  originally through the agency of ozone. At a low temperature  ozone has been liquefied. It is then distinctly blue.    Electrolysis of water is the best mode of preparing this  substance in quantity. When prepared from P it is mixed with  P2O3.    Chapter XXVII.    CHEMISTRY OF THE ATMOSPHERE.    130. Constituents.--The four chief constituents of the atmosphere  are N, O, H2O, CO2, in the order of their abundance. What  experiments show the presence of N, O, and CO2 in the air? Set a  pitcher of ice water in a warm room, and the moisture that  collects on the outside is deposited from the air. This shows the  presence of H2O. Rain, clouds, fog, and dew prove the same. H2SO4  and CaCl2, on exposure to air, take up water. Experiment 18 shows  that there is not far from four times as much N as O by volume in  air. Hence if the atmosphere were a compound of N and O, and the  proportion of four to one were exact, its symbol would be N4O.    131. Air not a Compound.--The following facts show that air is  not a compound, but rather a mixture of these gases.    1. The proportion of N and O in the air, though it does not vary  much, is not always exactly the same. This could not be true if  it were a compound. Why?    2. If N4O were dissolved in water, the N would be four times the  O in volume; but when air is dissolved, less than twice as much N  as O is taken up.    3. No heat or condensation takes place when four measures of N  are brought in contact with one of O. It cannot then be N4O, for  the vapor density of N4O would be 36--i.e. (14 x 4 + 16) / 2; but  that of air is 14 1/2 nearly --i.e. (14 x 4 + 16) / 5. Analysis  shows about 79 parts of N to 21 parts of O by volume in air.    132. Water.--The volume of H2O, watery vapor, in the atmosphere  is very variable. Warm air will hold more than cold, and at any  temperature air may be near saturation, i.e. having all it will  hold at that temperature, or it may have little. But some is  always present; though the hot desert winds of North Africa are  not more than 1/15 saturated. A cubic meter of air at 25 degrees,  when saturated, contains more than 22 g. of water.    133. Carbon Dioxide.--Carbon dioxide does not make up more than  three or four parts in ten thousand of the air; but, in the whole  of the atmosphere, this gives a very large aggregate. Why does  not CO2 form a layer below the O and N?    134. Other Ingredients.--Other substances are found in the air in  minute portions, e.g. NH3 constitutes nearly one-millionth. Air  is also impregnated with living and dead germs, dust particles,  unburned carbon, etc., but these for the most part are confined  to the portion near the earth's surface. In pestilential regions  the germs of disease are said sometimes to contaminate the air  for miles around.    Chapter XXVIII.    THE CHEMISTRY OF WATER.    135.
