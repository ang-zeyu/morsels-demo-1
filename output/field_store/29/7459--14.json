He was a good portrait-painter, and produced a  great number of pictures for Ravenna. Some, too, he sent elsewhere, and  they are met with at San Benedetto in Ferrara, in the Abbey at Mantua, in  that of Praglia near Padua, at S. Francesco in Rimini, with the date of  1580, in Pesaro, and other places. They are chiefly composed in the ancient  manner, but on comparing some of the earlier with those that follow, a more  modern air is perceptible, a circumstance attributed by Vasari to his own  conversations with the artist. Longhi's style, however, was opposed to that  of Vasari, being very correct and highly finished; his conceptions sweet,  varied, and graceful; with a powerful union of colours; more nearly  resembling Innocenzo da Imola, if I mistake not, than any other artist of  the times, though inferior to him in point of grandeur and beauty. Luca's  most perfect pictures that I have met with in Ravenna are those of S.  Vitale, of S. Agata, of S. Domenico, all with a representation of the  Virgin between two or more saints, and with some graceful cherubs playing  above. There are others more laboured, which please us less, and  demonstrate that to succeed in grand compositions, it is previously  necessary to have studied the great schools. Luca had a daughter, named  Barbara, yet a child at the period when Vasari published his work, but who  had begun to paint \"with a tolerable degree of grace and manner.\" From the  hand of this lady there is only a single specimen remaining in public.  Respecting a son of Luca, named Francesco, the historian is wholly silent,  being, doubtless, at the time he wrote, still younger than his sister, but  who became an artist in maturer years. In 1576 he produced a picture for  the church of the Carmine, and there are accounts of him, even down to  1610. He chiefly pursued the steps of his father, though he is more common  in his countenances, and more feeble in point of colouring, which he copied  rather from Vasari.    Francesco Scannelli mentions a pupil of Raffaello at Cesena, omitted by all  other historians, named Scipione Sacco. He painted a picture of S. Gregory  for the cathedral of Cesena, in a grand style,[17] and the Death of St.  Peter the Martyr for the church of S. Domenico. Doubtless he was of  Raffaello's school, and not remembered out of Romagna.         Footnote 17: On this picture is inscribed, _Caesenas_, 1545.       _Oretti_, _Memorie_, MSS.    While the family of the Longhi was employed at Ravenna, that of the  Minzocchi, which was surnamed San Bernardo, was distinguishing itself at  Forli. Francesco, called also the elder di S. Bernardo, studied the works  of Palmigiani in his native place; and there remain pictures conducted in  his youth, but feeble in point of design, such as his Crucifixion at the  Padri Osservanti. But under Genga, according to Vasari, and, as some  writers add, under Pordenone, he changed his manner, assuming a more  correct style, graceful, animated, and of an expression which looks like  nature herself in these his subsequent productions. Among the works he  executed with most care are two lateral pictures at the cathedral of  Loreto, in a chapel of S. Francesco di Paola. These consist of a Sacrifice  of Melchisedec, and the miracle of the Manna, in which the prophets and the  principal characters boast all the dignity and nobleness of drapery  becoming the school of Pordenone. The crowd, however, is represented in the  most popular features and attitudes, sufficient almost to excite the envy  of Teniers, and the most natural artists of the Flemish school. His  delineations in these pictures, of numerous and various animals, are  expressed to the life, with baskets and different utensils like reality,  though the attempt to excite our mirth in treating serious subjects has a  bad effect. Scannelli extols a specimen of his works in fresco at S. Maria  della Grata in Forli, representing the Deity on the ceiling, surrounded by  a number of angels; figures full of spirit, majestic, varied, and painted  with a power and skill of foreshortening, which entitles him to greater  celebrity than he enjoys. He left a variety of productions, likewise, at S.  Domenico, at the cathedral, and at private houses in his native place,  where such is his reputation, that on the chapels being taken down, his  least celebrated frescos were carefully cut out, and replaced elsewhere.  Among his sons and pupils were Pietro Paolo, mentioned also by Vasari, and  Sebastiano, both artists of the same natural style, not very select, with  little relief, and mediocrity of invention. To Pietro Paolo belong several  figures at the Padri Francescani at Forli, of feeble execution; and to  Sebastiano a picture at S. Agostino, composed in 1593 in the ancient taste,  and of a style like his other works, inferior to the character of his age.    Subsequent to the elder Minzocchi, Forli produced two other artists  deserving commemoration; namely, Livio Agresti, conspicuous in the  histories of Vasari and Baglione, as a daring designer, a copious composer,  and universal in point of manner; the other, Francesco di Modigliana, an  artist of more limited genius, but still deserving to be known. Of Livio, I  spoke in the third epoch of the Roman School, to which, as pupil to Perino,  and resident in Rome, where he was employed at the Castello, in the  Vatican, at S. Spirito and elsewhere, he doubtless belongs. His native  place, however, seems to have culled the fairest fruit of his labours, Rome  possessing nothing nearly so Raffaellesque, as are his Scriptural Histories  in the public palace at Forli. Nor ought we to pass over that finely  decorated chapel in the cathedral, where he represented the Last Supper,  with some majestic figures of the prophets upon the ceiling; a work that  for depth and intricacy of perspective yields in nothing to Minzocchi. I  shall not stop to inquire, with Malvasia, whether having gone to Rome in a  moment of disgust and in haste, instead of there advancing himself, he  wholly failed; but of this I am convinced, that his history in the Cappella  Paolina, is by no means his masterpiece.    Francesco di Modigliana is said to have been pupil to Pontormo, in whose  school he almost fills the same rank as Bronzino in that of Florence; not  remarkably powerful, nor always consistent with himself, but very graceful  and beautiful, and deserving a place in our pictoric Lexicons, where his  name is wanting. His works at Urbino consist of those which are pointed out  under the name of Francesco da Forli; a picture of Christ taken down from  the cross, in oil, at S. Croce; and some angels in fresco at S. Lucia;  productions much commended, and resembling in style his best at the  Osservanti in Forli, and at the Rosario in Rimini. Here, perhaps, he most  distinguished himself; in his picture of Adam driven from Eden, his Deluge,  the Tower of Babel, with similar histories already treated by Raffaello at  Rome, and by Agresti in Forli, from imitating whom, if I mistake not, he  greatly improved and advanced himself. Dying suddenly he left his work  imperfect, afterwards continued by Gio. Laurentini, called Arrigoni, who  painted the Death of Abel at the same place.    After Bartolommeo da Rimini, who inclined more towards the modern than the  ancient style, I find no other artist of celebrity in that city besides  Arrigoni. Even his name has not been recorded by Orlandi, nor by his  continuator. He diligently employed himself in his native place, and two of  his pictures representing martyrdoms, met with surprising success; one of  St. John the Baptist, at the Augustine friars, and another of the Saints  John and Paul, at the church bearing their name. Yet they do not display  that _beau ideal_, so attractive at that period in the productions even of  the inferior disciples of the Roman School; but they convey the impression  of grand compositions, a vivacity of action, a boldness of hand, a splendor  in the retinue of horse and arms, and military ensigns, calculated to  compete with the chief part of the painters employed at Rome in the service  of Gregory and of Sixtus.    Faenza, too, at the opening of this epoch, boasted her Jacopone, or  Jacomone, of whom we treated among the assistants of Raffaello, and among  the masters of Taddeo Zuccaro. Vasari makes brief mention and smaller  account of this artist; recording only one of his productions, the tribune  of S. Vitale at Ravenna, and which has ceased to exist. In the cupola of  the church, however, subsequently repainted by another hand, there were  visible, in the time of Fabri, author of \"Ravenna Ricercata,\" (researches  in that city) several figures of saints richly apparelled, bearing this  inscription: \"Opus Jacobi Bertucci et Julii Tondutii Faventinorum. Pari  voto f. 1513.\"[18] At present I no longer doubt but that under this Jacopo  was concealed the name of Jacopone di Faenza, though according to Orlandi  they were two several painters, and though it has never occurred to  Baldinucci and Bottari, and other writers of pictoric history, to unite  them into one. My conjecture is founded upon a picture which I saw in the  church of the Dominican nuns in Faenza, representing the Birth of the  Virgin, with the name of Jacopo Bertucci of Faenza, and dated 1532. It is a  work which arrests the eye by its resemblance to the style of Raffaello,  though his harmonious gradations have not been well observed, and the  colouring inclines more to the strong than to the beautiful. The women  busied about the couch of St. Anne are beautiful, graceful, and animated  figures, and there are some animals, and in particular a fowl, which a  Bassano himself would not have been sorry to have painted. Now what other  Jacopo of Faenza could in the year 1532, have painted in this style, with  more shew of reason and probability than Jacopone da Faenza, whose family  would here appear to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4011"],[0,"Epicoene; Or, The Silent Woman (#14)"],[1," correspondence betwixt them and the London cooks:     'tis twenty to one but we have them.

DAUP: Tut, flatter them both, as Truewit says, and you may take     their understandings in a purse-net. They'll believe themselves     to be just such men as we make them, neither more nor less.

MOR: Sir, there is an angel for yourself, and a brace of angels     for your cold. Muse not at this manage of my bounty. It is fit we     should thank fortune, double to nature, for any benefit she     confers upon us; besides, it is your imperfection, but my solace.       PAR [SPEAKS AS HAVING A COLD.] I thank your worship; so is it     mine, now.       MOR: What says he, Cutbeard?       CUT: He says, praesto, sir, whensoever your worship needs him, he     can be ready with the like. He got this cold with sitting up late,     and singing catches with cloth-workers.       MOR: No more. I thank him.       PAR: God keep your worship, and give you much joy with your fair     spouse.--[COUGHS.] uh! uh! uh!       MOR: O, O! stay Cutbeard! let him give me five shillings of my     money back. As it is bounty to reward benefits, so is it equity     to mulct injuries. I will have it. What says he?       CUT: He cannot change it, sir.       MOR: It must be changed.       CUT [ASIDE TO PARSON.]: Cough again.       MOR: What says he?       CUT: He will cough out the rest, sir.       PAR: Uh, uh, uh!       MOR: Away, away with him! stop his mouth! away! I forgive it.--       [EXIT CUT. THRUSTING OUT THE PAR.]       EPI: Fie, master Morose, that you will use this violence to a man     of the church.       MOR: How!       EPI: It does not become your gravity, or breeding, as you pretend,     in court, to have offer'd this outrage on a waterman, or any more     boisterous creature, much less on a man of his civil coat.       MOR: You can speak then!       EPI: Yes, sir.       MOR: Speak out, I mean.       EPI: Ay, sir. Why, did you think you had married a statue, or a     motion, only? one of the French puppets, with the eyes turn'd with     a wire? or some innocent out of the hospital, that would stand     with her hands thus, and a plaise mouth, and look upon you?       MOR: O immodesty! a manifest woman! What, Cutbeard!       EPI: Nay, never quarrel with Cutbeard, sir; it is too late now. I     confess it doth bate somewhat of the modesty I had, when I writ     simply maid: but I hope, I shall make it a stock still competent     to the estate and dignity of your wife.       MOR: She can talk!       EPI: Yes, indeed, sir.       [ENTER MUTE.]       MOR: What sirrah! None of my knaves there? where is this impostor,     Cutbeard?       [MUTE MAKES SIGNS.]       EPI: Speak to him, fellow, speak to him! I'll have none of this     coacted, unnatural dumbness in my house, in a family where I     govern.

TRUE: God save you, sir, and give you all contentment in your fair     choice, here! Before, I was the bird of night to you, the owl; but     now I am the messenger of peace, a dove, and bring you the glad     wishes of many friends to the celebration of this good hour.       MOR: What hour, sir?       TRUE: Your marriage hour, sir. I commend your resolution, that,     notwithstanding all the dangers I laid afore you, in the voice of     a night-crow, would yet go on, and be yourself. It shews you are     a man constant to your own ends, and upright to your purposes,     that would not be put off with left-handed cries.       MOR: How should you arrive at the knowledge of so much!       TRUE: Why, did you ever hope, sir, committing the secrecy of it to     a barber, that less then the whole town should know it? you might     as well have told it the conduit, or the bake-house, or the     infantry that follow the court, and with more security. Could     your gravity forget so old and noted a remnant, as lippis et     tonsoribus notum? Well, sir, forgive it yourself now, the fault,     and be communicable with your friends. Here will be three or four     fashionable ladies from the college to visit you presently, and     their train of minions and followers.       MOR: Bar my doors! bar my doors! Where are all my eaters? my     mouths now?--     [ENTER SERVANTS.]     Bar up my doors, you varlets!       EPI: He is a varlet that stirs to such an office. Let them stand     open. I would see him that dares move his eyes toward it. Shall I     have a barricado made against my friends, to be barr'd of any     pleasure they can bring in to me with their honourable     visitation?       [EXEUNT SER.]       MOR: O Amazonian impudence!       TRUE: Nay, faith, in this, sir, she speaks but reason: and,     methinks, is more continent than you. Would you go to bed so     presently, sir, afore noon? a man of your head and hair should     owe more to that reverend ceremony, and not mount the marriage-bed     like a town-bull, or a mountain-goat; but stay the due season; and     ascend it then with religion and fear. Those delights are to be     steeped in the humour and silence of the night; and give the day     to other open pleasures, and jollities of feasting, of music, of     revels, of discourse: we'll have all, sir, that may make your     Hymen high and happy.       MOR: O, my torment, my torment!       TRUE: Nay, if you endure the first half hour, sir, so tediously,     and with this irksomness; what comfort or hope can this fair     gentlewoman make to herself hereafter, in the consideration of so     many years as are to come--       MOR: Of my affliction. Good sir, depart, and let her do it alone.       TRUE: I have done, sir.       MOR: That cursed barber.       TRUE: Yes, faith, a cursed wretch indeed, sir.       MOR: I have married his cittern, that's common to all men. Some     plague above the plague--       TRUE: All Egypt's ten plagues.       MOR: Revenge me on him!       TRUE: 'Tis very well, sir. If you laid on a curse or two more,     I'll assure you he'll bear them. As, that he may get the pox     with seeking to cure it, sir; or, that while he is curling another     man's hair, his own may drop off; or, for burning some male-bawd's     lock, he may have his brain beat out with the curling-iron.       MOR: No, let the wretch live wretched. May he get the itch, and his     shop so lousy, as no man dare come at him, nor he come at no man!       TRUE: Ay, and if he would swallow all his balls for pills, let not     them purge him.       MOR: Let his warming pan be ever cold.       TRUE: A perpetual frost underneath it, sir.       MOR: Let him never hope to see fire again.       TRUE: But in hell, sir.       MOR: His chairs be always empty, his scissors rust, and his combs     mould in their cases.       TRUE: Very dreadful that! And may he lose the invention, sir, of     carving lanterns in paper.       MOR: Let there be no bawd carted that year, to employ a bason of     his: but let him be glad to eat his sponge for bread.       TRUE: And drink lotium to it, and much good do him.       MOR: Or, for want of bread--       TRUE: Eat ear-wax, sir. I'll help you. Or, draw his own teeth,     and add them to the lute-string.       MOR: No, beat the old ones to powder, and make bread of them.       TRUE: Yes, make meal of the mill-stones.       MOR: May all the botches and burns that he has cured on others     break out"]]]
