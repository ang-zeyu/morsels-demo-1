All these  considerations made me devise a pleasant trick, for the increase of  merriment and the diffusion of mirth in our society.    Having taken this resolve, I sent for a stripling of sixteen years, who  lived in the next house to mine; he was the son of a Spanish  coppersmith. This young man gave his time to Latin studies, and was very  diligent in their pursuit. He bore the name of Diego, had a handsome  figure, and a complexion of marvellous brilliancy; the outlines of his  head and face were far more beautiful than those of the antique  Antinous: I had often copied them, gaining thereby much honour from the  works in which I used them. The youth had no acquaintances, and was  therefore quite unknown; dressed very ill and negligently; all his  affections being set upon those wonderful studies of his. After bringing  him to my house, I begged him to let me array him in the womans clothes  which I had caused to be laid out. He readily complied, and put them on  at once, while I added new beauties to the beauty of his face by the  elaborate and studied way in which I dressed his hair. In his ears I  placed two little rings, set with two large and fair pearls; the rings  were broken; they only clipped his ears, which looked as though they had  been pierced. Afterwards I wreathed his throat with chains of gold and  rich jewels, and ornamented his fair hands with rings. Then I took him  in a pleasant manner by one ear, and drew him before a great  looking-glass. The lad, when he beheld himself, cried out with a burst  of enthusiasm: Heavens! is that Diego? I said: That is Diego, from  whom until this day I never asked for any kind of favour; but now I only  beseech Diego to do me pleasure in one harmless thing; and it is this-I  want him to come in those very clothes to supper with the company of  artists whereof he has often heard me speak. The young man, who was  honest, virtuous, and wise, checked his enthusiasm, bent his eyes to the  ground, and stood for a short while in silence. Then with a sudden move  he lifted up his face and said: With Benvenuto I will go; now let us  start.    I wrapped his head in a large kind of napkin, which is called in Rome a  summer-cloth; and when we reached the place of meeting, the company had  already assembled, and everybody came forward to greet me. Michel Agnolo  had placed himself between Giulio and Giovan Francesco. I lifted the  veil from the head of my beauty; and then Michel Agnolo, who, as I have  already said, was the most humorous and amusing fellow in the world,  laid his two hands, the one on Giulios and the other on Gian  Francescos shoulders, and pulling them with all his force, made them  bow down, while he, on his knees upon the floor, cried out for mercy,  and called to all the folk in words like these: Behold ye of what sort  are the angels of paradise! for though they are called angels, here  shall ye see that they are not all of the male gender. Then with a loud  voice he added:    Angel beauteous, angel best,    Save me thou, make thou me blest.    Upon this my charming creature laughed, and lifted the right hand and  gave him a papal benediction, with many pleasant words to boot. So  Michel Agnolo stood up, and said it was the custom to kiss the feet of  the Pope and the cheeks of angels; and having done the latter to Diego,  the boy blushed deeply, which immensely enhanced his beauty.    When this reception was over, we found the whole room full of sonnets,  which every man of us had made and sent to Michel Agnolo, My lad began  to read them, and read them all aloud so gracefully, that his infinite  charms were heightened beyond the powers of language to describe. Then  followed conversation and witty sayings, on which I will not enlarge,  for that is not my business; only one clever word must be mentioned, for  it was spoken by that admirable painter Giulio, who, looking round with  meaning [4] in his eyes on the bystanders, and fixing them particularly  upon the women, turned to Michel Agnolo and said: My dear Michel  Agnolo, your nickname of crow very well suits those ladies to-day,  though I vow they are somewhat less fair than crows by the side of one  of the most lovely peacocks which fancy could have painted    When the banquet was served and ready, and we were going to sit down to  table, Giulio asked leave to be allowed to place us. This being granted,  he took the women by the hand, and arranged them all upon the inner  side, with my fair in the centre; then he placed all the men on the  outside and me in the middle, saying there was no honour too great for  my deserts.; As a background to the women, there was spread an espalier  of natural jasmines in full beauty, [5] which set off their charms, and  especially Diegos, to such great advantage, that words would fail to  describe the effect. Then we all of us fell to enjoying the abundance of  our hosts well-furnished table. The supper was followed by a short  concert of delightful music, voices joining in harmony with instruments;  and forasmuch as they were singing and playing from the book, my beauty  begged to be allowed to sing his part. He performed the music better  than almost all the rest, which so astonished the company that Giulio  and Michel Agnolo dropped their earlier tone of banter, exchanging it  for well-weighed terms of sober heartfelt admiration.    After the music was over, a certain Aurelio Ascolano, [6]remarkable for  his gift as an improvisatory poet, began to extol the women in choice  phrases of exquisite compliment. While he was chanting, the two girls  who had my beauty between them never left off chattering. One of them  related how she had gone wrong; the other asked mine how it had happened  with her, and who were her friends, and how long she had been settled in  Rome, and many other questions of the kind. It is true that, if I chose  to describe such laughable episodes, I could relate several odd things  which then occurred through Pantasileas jealousy on my account; but  since they form no part of my design, I pass them briefly over. At last  the conversation of those loose women vexed my beauty, whom we had  christened Pomona for the nonce; and Pomona, wanting to escape from  their silly talk, turned restlessly upon her chair, first to one side  and then to the other. The female brought by Giulio asked whether she  felt indisposed. Pomona answered, yes, she thought she was a month or so  with a child; this gave them the opportunity of feeling her body and  discovering the real sex of the supposed woman. Thereupon they quickly  withdrew their hands and rose from table, uttering such gibing words as  are commonly addressed to young men of eminent beauty. The whole room  rang with laughter and astonishment, in the midst of which Michel  Agnolo, assuming a fierce aspect, called out for leave to inflict on me  the penance he thought fit. When this was granted, he lifted me aloft  amid the clamour of the company, crying: Long live the gentleman! long  live the gentleman! and added that this was the punishment I deserved  for having played so fine a trick. Thus ended that most agreeable  supper-party, and each of us returned to his own dwelling at the close  of day.    Note 1. This sculptor came to Rome with his compatriot Baldassare  Peruzzi, and was employed upon the monument of Pope Adrian VI., which he  executed with some help from Tribolo.    Note 2. There were two artists at this epoch surnamed Bachiacca, the  twin sons of Ubertino Verdi, called respectively Francesco and Antonio.  Francesco was an excellent painter of miniature oil-pictures; Antonio  the first embroiderer of his age. The one alluded to here is probably  Francesco.    Note 3. 'Mancare di una sìpazza cosa.' The 'pazza cosa' may be the  supper-party or the 'cornacchia.'    Note 4. 'Virtuosamente.' Cellini uses the word 'virtuoso' in many  senses, but always more with reference to intellectual than moral  qualities. It denotes genius, artistic ability, masculine force, &c.    Note 5. 'Un tessuto di gelsumini naturali e bellissimi. Tessuto' is  properly something woven, a fabric; and I am not sure whether Cellini  does not mean that the ladies had behind their backs a tapestry  representing jasmines in a natural manner.    Note 6. Probably Eurialo dAscoli, a friend of Caro, Molza, Aretino.    XXXI    IT would take too long to describe in detail all the many and divers  pieces of work which I executed for a great variety of men. At present I  need only say that I devoted myself with sustained diligence and  industry to acquiring mastery in the several branches of art which I  enumerated a short while back. And so I went on labouring incessantly at  all of them; but since no opportunity has presented itself as yet for  describing my most notable performances, I shall wait to report them in  their proper place before very long. The Sienese sculptor, Michel  Agnolo, of whom I have recently been speaking, was at that time making  the monument of the late Pope Adrian. Giulio Romano went to paint for  the Marquis of Mantua. The other members of the club betook themselves  in different directions, each to his own business; so that our company  of artists was well-nigh altogether broken up.    About this time there fell into my hands some little Turkish poniards;  the handle as well as the blade of these daggers was made of iron, and  so too was the sheath. They were engraved by means of iron implements  with foliage in the most exquisite Turkish style, very neatly filled in  with gold. The sight of them stirred in me a great desire to try my own"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4035"],[0,"Greek Studies: a Series of Essays (#14)"],[1,"things, that order of summer and  winter, of which it had no scientific, or systematic explanation, but  in which, nevertheless, it divined a multitude of living agencies,  corresponding to those ascertained forces, of which our colder modern  science tells the number and the names.  Demeter--Demeter and  Persephone, at first, in a sort of confused union--is the earth, in  the fixed order of its annual changes, but also in all the accident  and detail of the growth and decay of its children.  Of this  conception, floating loosely in the air, the poets of a later age  take possession; they create Demeter and Persephone as we know them  in art and poetry.  From the vague and fluctuating union, in which  together they had represented the earth and its changes, the mother  and the daughter define themselves with special functions, and with  fixed, well-understood relationships, the incidents and emotions of  which soon weave themselves into a pathetic story.  Lastly, in  proportion as the literary or aesthetic activity completes the  picture or the poem, the ethical interest makes itself felt.  These  strange persons--Demeter and Persephone--these marvellous incidents--  the translation into Hades, the seeking [93] of Demeter, the return  of Persephone to her,--lend themselves to the elevation and  correction of the sentiments of sorrow and awe, by the presentment to  the senses and the imagination of an ideal expression of them.  Demeter cannot but seem the type of divine grief.  Persephone is the  goddess of death, yet with a promise of life to come.  Those three  phases, then, which are more or less discernible in all mythical  development, and constitute a natural order in it, based on the  necessary conditions of human apprehension, are fixed more plainly,  perhaps, than in any other passage of Greek mythology in the story of  Demeter.  And as the Homeric hymn is the central expression of its  literary or poetical phase, so the marble remains, of which I shall  have to speak by and bye, are the central extant illustration of what  I have called its ethical phase.    Homer, in the Iliad, knows Demeter, but only as the goddess of the  fields, the originator and patroness of the labours of the  countryman, in their yearly order.  She stands, with her hair yellow  like the ripe corn, at the threshing-floor, and takes her share in  the toil, the heap of grain whitening, as the flails, moving in the  wind, disperse the chaff.  Out in the fresh fields, she yields to the  embraces of Iasion, to the extreme jealousy of Zeus, who slays her  mortal lover with lightning.  The flowery town of Pyrasus--the wheat-  town,--an ancient place in Thessaly, is her sacred precinct.  But  when [94] Homer gives a list of the orthodox gods, her name is not  mentioned.    Homer, in the Odyssey, knows Persephone also, but not as Kore; only  as the queen of the dead--epainê Persephonê+--dreadful Persephone, the  goddess of destruction and death, according to the apparent import of  her name.+  She accomplishes men's evil prayers; she is the mistress  and manager of men's shades, to which she can dispense a little more  or less of life, dwelling in her mouldering palace on the steep shore  of the Oceanus, with its groves of barren willows and tall poplars.  But that Homer knew her as the daughter of Demeter there are no  signs; and of his knowledge of the rape of Persephone there is only  the faintest sign,--he names Hades by the golden reins of his  chariot, and his beautiful horses.    The main theme, then, the most characteristic peculiarities, of the  story, as subsequently developed, are not to be found, expressly, in  the true Homer.  We have in him, on the one hand, Demeter, as the  perfectly fresh and blithe goddess of the fields, whose children, if  she has them, must be as the perfectly discreet and peaceful,  unravished Kore; on the other hand, we have Persephone, as the wholly  terrible goddess of death, who brings to Ulysses the querulous  shadows of the dead, and has the head of the gorgon Medusa in her  keeping.  And it is only when these two contrasted images have been  [95] brought into intimate relationship, only when Kore and  Persephone have been identified, that the deeper mythology of Demeter  begins.    This combination has taken place in Hesiod; and in three lines of the  Theogony we find the stealing of Persephone by Aidoneus,*--one of  those things in Hesiod, perhaps, which are really older than Homer.  Hesiod has been called the poet of helots, and is thought to have  preserved some of the traditions of those earlier inhabitants of  Greece who had become a kind of serfs; and in a certain shadowiness  in his conceptions of the gods, contrasting with the concrete and  heroic forms of the gods of Homer, we may perhaps trace something of  the quiet unspoken brooding of a subdued people--of that silently  dreaming temper to which the story of Persephone properly belongs.  However this may be, it is in Hesiod that the two images,  unassociated in Homer--the goddess of summer and the goddess of  death, Kore and Persephone--are identified with much significance;  and that strange, dual being makes her first appearance, whose latent  capabilities the poets afterwards developed; among the rest, a  peculiar blending of those two contrasted aspects, full of purpose  for the duly chastened intelligence; death, resurrection,  rejuvenescence.--Awake, and sing, ye that dwell in the dust!    [96] Modern science explains the changes of the natural world by the  hypothesis of certain unconscious forces; and the sum of these  forces, in their combined action, constitutes the scientific  conception of nature.  But, side by side with the growth of this more  mechanical conception, an older and more spiritual, Platonic,  philosophy has always maintained itself, a philosophy more of  instinct than of the understanding, the mental starting-point of  which is not an observed sequence of outward phenomena, but some such  feeling as most of us have on the first warmer days in spring, when  we seem to feel the genial processes of nature actually at work; as  if just below the mould, and in the hard wood of the trees, there  were really circulating some spirit of life, akin to that which makes  its energies felt within ourselves.  Starting with a hundred  instincts such as this, that older unmechanical, spiritual, or  Platonic, philosophy envisages nature rather as the unity of a living  spirit or person, revealing itself in various degrees to the kindred  spirit of the observer, than as a system of mechanical forces.  Such  a philosophy is a systematised form of that sort of poetry (we may  study it, for instance, either in Shelley or in Wordsworth), which  also has its fancies of a spirit of the earth, or of the sky,--a  personal intelligence abiding in them, the existence of which is  assumed in every suggestion such poetry makes to us of a sympathy  between the ways [97] and aspects of outward nature and the moods of  men.  And what stood to the primitive intelligence in place of such  metaphysical conceptions were those cosmical stories or myths, such  as this of Demeter and Persephone, which springing up spontaneously  in many minds, came at last to represent to them, in a certain number  of sensibly realised images, all they knew, felt, or fancied, of the  natural world about them.  The sky in its unity and its variety,--the  sea in its unity and its variety,--mirrored themselves respectively  in these simple, but profoundly impressible spirits, as Zeus, as  Glaucus or Poseidon.  And a large part of their experience--all, that  is, that related to the earth in its changes, the growth and decay of  all things born of it--was covered by the story of Demeter, the myth  of the earth as a mother.  They thought of Demeter as the old Germans  thought of Hertha, or the later Greeks of Pan, as the Egyptians  thought of Isis, the land of the Nile, made green by the streams of  Osiris, for whose coming Isis longs, as Demeter for Persephone; thus  naming together in her all their fluctuating thoughts, impressions,  suspicions, of the earth and its appearances, their whole complex  divination of a mysterious life, a perpetual working, a continuous  act of conception there.  Or they thought of the many-coloured earth  as the garment of Demeter, as the great modern pantheist poet speaks  of it as the \"garment of God.\"  Its [98] brooding fertility; the  spring flowers breaking from its surface, the thinly disguised  unhealthfulness of their heavy perfume, and of their chosen places of  growth; the delicate, feminine, Prosperina-like motion of all growing  things; its fruit, full of drowsy and poisonous, or fresh, reviving  juices; its sinister caprices also, its droughts and sudden volcanic  heats; the long delays of spring; its dumb sleep, so suddenly flung  away; the sadness which insinuates itself into its languid  luxuriance; all this grouped itself round the persons of Demeter and  her circle.  They could turn always to her, from the actual earth  itself, in aweful yet hopeful prayer, and a devout personal  gratitude, and explain it through her, in its sorrow and its promise,  its darkness and its helpfulness to man.    The personification of abstract ideas by modern painters or  sculptors, of wealth, of commerce, of health, for instance, shocks,  in most cases, the aesthetic sense, as something conventional or  rhetorical, as a mere transparent allegory, or figure of speech,  which could please almost no one.  On the other hand, such symbolical  representations, under the form of human persons, as Giotto's Virtues  and Vices at Padua, or his Saint Poverty at Assisi, or the series of  the planets in certain early Italian engravings, are profoundly  poetical and impressive.  They seem to be something more than mere  symbolism, [99] and to be connected with some peculiarly sympathetic  penetration, on the part of the artist, into the subjects"]]]
