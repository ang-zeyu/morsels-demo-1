[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Tractor-grader Outfit]    =Use of Blade Grader.=--Heavy blade graders designed to be drawn by a  tractor are suitable for shaping the earth road. Some of these have  blades 12 feet long and excellent control for regulating the depth of  cutting. Often two such graders are operated tandem. These machines  have a device which permits the operator to steer the grader  independently of the tractor. Thus the grader can be steered off to  the side to cut out the ditches, while the tractor continues to travel  on the firm part of the road. Earth moved with the blade grader is  usually fairly free from large lumps and can readily be smoothed to a  satisfactory surface for the use of traffic. The sods and weeds will  be drawn into the road along with the earth just as they are when the  elevating grader is employed. Precaution must therefore be taken to  eliminate them before the vegetable matter decays, and to smooth the  surface for the use of traffic.    =Costs.=--The cost of shaping an earth road in the manner described  above will vary through rather wide limits because the nature and  amount of work to be done varies so greatly. Some roads can be graded  satisfactorily for $300.00 per mile, while others will cost $700.00.  But $425.00 per mile may be taken as an average for blade or elevating  grader work plus a moderate amount of grade reduction in the way of  removing slight knolls. For the amount of grade reduction necessary in  rolling country, followed by grader shaping, $1000.00 to $1800.00 per  mile will be required. The method is not adapted to rolling country  where the roads are undulating and require some grade reduction on  every hill. For hilly roads one of the methods described for grade  reduction will be required and the cost will obviously depend upon the  amount of earth moved. Averages of cost figures mean nothing in such  cases as the cost may reach $10,000.00 per mile, or may be as low as  $2000.00 per mile.    =Maintenance.=--Regardless of the care with which an earth road has  been graded, it will be yielding and will readily absorb water for a  long time after the completion of the work. The condition of the  surface will naturally deteriorate rapidly during the first season it  is used unless the road receives the constant maintenance that is a  prerequisite to satisfactory serviceability. The road drag is  generally recommended for this purpose, and if a drag is properly used  it will serve to restore the shape of the surface as fast as it is  destroyed by traffic.    Good results with the drag depend upon choosing the proper time to  drag and upon doing the work in the right way when using the drag. The  best time to drag is as soon after a rain as the road has dried out  enough to pack under traffic. If the work is done while the road is  too wet, the first vehicles traveling the road after it has been  dragged will make ruts and to a considerable extent offset the good  done by the drag. If the road is too dry, the drag will not smooth the  irregularities. A little observation will be required to determine the  proper time for dragging on any particular soil, but usually after a  rain or thaw there is a period lasting a day or two when conditions  are about right.    [Illustration: Fig. 13.--Road Drag]    The drag is used merely to restore the shape of the surface and to do  so a small amount of material is drawn toward the middle of the road.  But there must not be a ridge of loose material left in the middle  after the work is completed. Some patrolmen start at one side of the  road and gradually work across the road on successive trips, finally  finishing up at the side opposite that at which the start was made.  The next dragging should start on the opposite side from the first if  that method is followed.    By shifting his weight on the drag, the operator can adjust the  cutting edge so that very little loose material is moved crosswise of  the road and that is the proper method to pursue. In that case no  ridge will remain at the middle of the road. If a slight one is left  it should be removed by a final trip with the drag.    In addition to the dragging, weeds must be cut along the road about  twice a year, the ditches must be kept cleaned out and culverts open.    All of the maintenance for 10 miles of earth road can be accomplished  by one man giving his entire time to the work, and that is the only  method that has proven adequate to the problem.      EARTH ROADS IN ARID REGIONS    In areas where the rainfall is less than 18 inches per year, and  especially where it is 10 inches or less, an entirely different road  problem exists. The effect of precipitation is of significance  primarily from the standpoint of erosion, and the design of cross  section and ditches and the culvert provisions are entirely different  from those necessary in humid regions.    Frequently the rainfall in semi-arid regions will be seasonal and  provision must be made to care for a large volume of water during the  rainy season, but, in general, road design is adapted to prevention of  erosion rather than to elimination of ground water effects, or the  softening effects of surface water. Generally the rainy period does  not last long enough to warrant expensive construction to eliminate  its general effects. In fact, the saturation of the soil is more  likely to be a benefit than otherwise.    Earth roads are likely to be satisfactory except where the traffic is  sufficient to grind the surface into dust to such an extent that an  excessive dust layer is produced. In such locations the problem is one  of providing a durable surface unaffected by long continued dry  weather.    Grade reduction will have the same importance as in humid areas and  will be carried out in the same way.    Maintenance will consist in repairing the damage from occasional  floods and in removing or preventing accumulations of drifting sand  or dust. Crude petroleum oils have been satisfactory for maintenance  in such locations when used on stable soils.    =Value of Earth Roads.=--The serviceability of the earth road depends  to a large extent upon the care exercised in its maintenance. The only  part of earth road construction that is permanent is the grade  reduction. The cross section that is so carefully shaped at  considerable cost may flatten out in one or two years, especially if  the road goes through unusually wet periods. Traffic will continually  seek a new track during the period when the road is muddy and is as  likely to cross the ditch to the sod near the fence as to use any  other part of the road. Continual and persistent maintenance is  therefore essential to even reasonable serviceability. At best the  earth road will be a poor facility for a considerable period each year  in the regions of year-around rainfall. In most localities, roads of  distinctly minor importance are of necessity only earth roads and for  the comparatively small territory they serve and the small amount of  traffic, they probably serve the purpose. For roads of any importance  in the humid areas of the United States, the earth road cannot carry  satisfactorily the traffic of a prosperous and busy community.          CHAPTER VI    SAND-CLAY AND GRAVEL ROADS      In Chapter IV, mention was made of the variation in serviceability of  road surfaces composed of the natural soil existing on the  right-of-way of the road. It has been found that soils of a clayey  nature in which there is a considerable percentage of sand usually  afford a serviceable road surface for light or moderate traffic,  especially in areas where climatic conditions are favorable. A study  of these soils, together with the construction of experimental roads  of various mixtures of sand and clay, has led to a fairly  comprehensive understanding of the principles of construction and  range of capacity of this type of road surface, which is known as the  sand-clay road.    The sand-clay road surface consists of a natural or artificial mixture  of sand and clay, in which the amount of clay is somewhat greater than  sufficient to fill the voids in the dry sand. It may be assumed that  the sand contains 40 per cent of voids and that at least 45 per cent  of clay is required to fill the voids and bind the sand grains  together, because the clay spreads the sand grains apart during the  mixing, thus having the effect of increasing the voids. As a matter of  experiment, it is found to be impractical to secure by available  construction methods mixtures of sufficient uniformity to render it  necessary to exercise great exactness in proportioning the components,  but reasonable care in proportioning the materials is desirable.    Successful utilization of this type of surface requires considerable  study of available materials and investigations of their behavior when  combined. Extensive and exhaustive experiments have been conducted  with sand-clay mixtures in various places where they are widely used  for road surfaces and the following general principles have been  deduced.    =The Binder.=--In the sand-clay road, stability is obtained by  utilizing the bonding properties possessed to some degree by all  soils. Naturally this characteristic may be expected to vary widely  with the several types of soil. It is generally considered to be a  common property of clay, but the term clay is a general one that is  often applied to soils differing greatly in physical characteristics  and the term therefore loses its significance in this connection.  Those soils that are properly and technically called clay are  decidedly sticky when wet and are the best materials for sand-clay  construction. Of the clays, those that produce a tough sticky mud are  best. This can be tested by mixing a small quantity into a stiff mud  and molding it into a ball and immersing in water. If the ball retains  its shape for some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29444"],[0,"The Machinery of the Universe: Mechanical Conceptions of Physical Phenomena (#14)"],[1,"the two would be gratuitous. He can truthfully say that  he understands the _nature_ of that which goes on between the furnace  and the wheel; that it is some sort of motion, the particular kind of  which he might make out at his leisure.    Suppose once more that, across the road from an engine-house, there was  another building, where all sorts of machines--lathes, planers, drills,  etc.--were running, but that the source of the power for all this was  out of sight, and that one could see no connection between this and the  engine on the other side of the street. Would one need to suppose there  was anything mysterious between the two--a force, a fluid, an immaterial  something? This question is put on the supposition that one should not  be aware of the shaft that might be between the two buildings, and that  it was not obvious on simple inspection how the machines got their  motions from the engine. No one would be puzzled because he did not know  just what the intervening mechanism might be. If the boiler were in the  one building, and the engine in the other with the machines, he could  see nothing moving between them, even if the steam-pipes were of glass.  If matter of any kind were moving, he could not see it there. He would  say there _must_ be something moving, or pressure could not be  transferred from one place to the other.    Substitute for the furnace and boiler a galvanic battery or a dynamo;  for the machines of the shop, one or more motors with suitable wire  connections. When the dynamo goes the motors go; when the dynamo stops  the motors stop; nothing can be seen to be turning or moving in any way  between them. Is there any necessity for assuming a mysterious agency,  or a force of a _nature_ different from the visible ones at the two ends  of the line? Is it not certain that the question is, How does the motion  get from one to the other, whether there be a wire or not? If there be a  wire, it is plain that there is motion in it, for it is heated its whole  length, and heat is known to be a mode of motion, and every molecule  which is thus heated must have had some antecedent motions. Whether it  be defined or not, and whether it be called by one name or another, are  quite immaterial, if one is concerned only with the _nature_ of the  action, whether it be matter or ether, or motion or abracadabra.    Once more: suppose we have a series of active machines. (Fig. 11.) An  arc lamp, radiating light-waves, gets its energy from the wire which is  heated, which in turn gets its energy from the electric current; that  from a dynamo, the dynamo from a steam-engine; that from a furnace and  the chemical actions going on in it. Let us call the chemical actions A,  the furnace B, the engine C, the dynamo D, the electric lamp E, the  ether waves F. (Fig. 12.)    [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    The product of the chemical action of the coal is molecular motion,  called heat in the furnace. The product of the heat is mechanical motion  in the engine. The product of the mechanical motion is electricity in  the dynamo. The product of the electric current in the lamp is  light-waves in the ether. No one hesitates for an instant to speak of  the heat as being molecular motion, nor of the motions of the engine as  being mechanical; but when we come to the product of the dynamo, which  we call electricity, behold, nearly every one says, not that he does not  know what it is, but that no one knows! Does any one venture to say he  does not know what heat is, because he cannot describe in detail just  what goes on in a heated body, as it might be described by one who saw  with a microscope the movements of the molecules? Let us go back for a  moment to the proposition stated early in this book, namely, that if any  body of any magnitude moves, it is because some other body in motion and  in contact with it has imparted its motion by mechanical pressure.  Therefore, the ether waves at F (Fig. 11) imply continuous motions of  some sort from A to F. That they are all motions of ordinary matter from  A to E is obvious, because continuous matter is essential for the  maintenance of the actions. At E the motions are handed over to the  ether, and they are radiated away as light-waves.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.]    [Illustration: FIG. 13.]    A puzzling electrical phenomenon has been what has been called its  duality-states, which are spoken of as positive and negative. Thus, we  speak of the positive plate of a battery and the negative pole of a  dynamo; and another troublesome condition to idealize has been, how it  could be that, in an electric circuit, there could be as much energy at  the most remote part as at the source. But, if one will take a limp  rope, 8 or 10 feet long, tie its ends together, and then begin to twist  it at any point, he will see the twist move in a right-handed spiral on  the one hand, and in a left-handed spiral on the other, and each may be  traced quite round the circuit; so there will be as much twist, as much  motion, and as much energy in one part of the rope as in any other; and  if one chooses to call the right-handed twist positive, and the  left-handed twist negative, he will have the mechanical phenomenon of  energy-distribution and the terminology, analogous to what they are in  an electric conductor. (Fig. 13.) Are the cases more dissimilar than the  mechanical analogy would make them seem to be?    Are there any phenomena which imply that rotation is going on in an  electric conductor? There are. An electric arc, which is a current in  the air, and is, therefore, less constrained than it is in a conductor,  rotates. Especially marked is this when in front of the pole of a  magnet; but the rotation may be noticed in an ordinary arc by looking at  it with a stroboscope disk, rotated so as to make the light to the eye  intermittent at the rate of four or five hundred per second. A ray of  plane polarized light, parallel with a wire conveying a current, has its  plane of vibration twisted to the right or left, as the current goes  one way or the other through the wire, and to a degree that depends upon  the distance it travels; not only so, but if the ray be sent, by  reflection, back through the same field, it is twisted as much more--a  phenomenon which convinces one that rotation is going on in the space  through which the ray travels. If the ether through which the ray be  sent were simply warped or in some static stress, the ray, after  reflection, would be brought back to its original plane, which is not  the case. This rotation in the ether is produced by what is going on in  the wire. The ether waves called light are interpreted to imply that  molecules originate them by their vibrations, and that there are as many  ether waves per second as of molecular vibrations per second. In like  manner, the implication is the same, that if there be rotations in the  ether they must be produced by molecular rotation, and there must be as  many rotations per second in the ether as there are molecular rotations  that produce them. The space about a wire carrying a current is often  pictured as filled with whorls indicating this motion (Fig. 14), and one  must picture to himself, not the wire as a whole rotating, but each  individual molecule independently. But one is aware that the molecules  of a conductor are practically in contact with each other, and that if  one for any reason rotates, the next one to it would, from frictional  action, cause the one it touched to rotate in the opposite direction,  whereas, the evidence goes to show that all rotation is in the same  direction.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.]    How can this be explained mechanically? Recall the kind of action that  constitutes heat, that it is not translatory action in any degree, but  vibratory, in the sense of a change of form of an elastic body, and  this, too, of the atoms that make up the molecule of whatever sort. Each  atom is so far independent of every other atom in the molecule that it  can vibrate in this way, else it could not be heated. The greater the  amplitude of vibration, the more free space to move in, and continuous  contact of atoms is incompatible with the mechanics of heat. There must,  therefore, be impact and freedom alternating with each other in all  degrees in a heated body. If, in any way, the atoms themselves _were_  made to rotate, their heat impacts not only would restrain the  rotations, but the energy also of the rotation motion would increase the  vibrations; that is, the heat would be correspondingly increased, which  is what happens always when an electric current is in a conductor. It  appears that the cooler a body is the less electric resistance it has,  and the indications are that at absolute zero there is no resistance;  that is, impacts do not retard rotation, but it is also apparent that  any current sent through a conductor at that temperature would at once  heat it. This is the same as saying that an electric current could not  be sent through a conductor at absolute zero.    So far, mechanical conceptions are in accordance with electrical  phenomena, but there are several others yet to be noted. Electrical  phenomena has been explained as molecular or atomic phenomena, and there  is one more in that category which is well enough known, and which is so  important and suggestive, that the wonder is its significance has not  been seen by those who have sought to interpret electrical phenomena.  The reference is to the fact that electricity cannot be transmitted  through a vacuum. An electric arc begins to spread out as the density of  the air decreases, and presently it is extinguished. An induction spark  that will jump two or three feet in air cannot be made to bridge the  tenth of an inch in an ordinary vacuum. A vacuum is a perfect  non-conductor of electricity. Is there more than one possible  interpretation to this, namely, that electricity is fundamentally a"]]]
