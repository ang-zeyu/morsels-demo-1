Fire and sword are needed to remove them from the trunk      of that tree of life which is our Holy Mother the Church. And,      as if this were not trouble enough, I have also to put up with      being regarded not as a King but merely as the husband of the      Queen; for in very truth apart from her I am destitute of all      authority. And the English make mock of me, spreading broadcast      the most shameful pamphlets which assert that I am being bribed      by the Pope to afflict their country with every kind of impious      burning and persecution. Nor can I discover who it is that writes      these pamphlets, nor yet who prints them. And when I try to raise      from the people some necessary contribution (for in their malice      and wickedness they often leave me without any money at all),      they answer by advising me, in coarse lampoons, to ask of Satan      in whose pay I am. Parliament makes excuses for fear of my sting,      but I can get nothing out of them. And meanwhile the walls of      London are covered with the grossest pictures representing me      as a parricide who is ready to strike down your Majesty for the      sake of my inheritance. But well you know, my Lord and Father,      that notwithstanding all the hopes of a legitimate ambition,      I most certainly desire that your Majesty may enjoy yet long and      glorious years of rule. Furthermore, there are circulating through      the city certain engravings on copper which show me torturing      animals and laughing the while. But well you know, Sire, that if      ever it has happened to me to taste this profane pleasure, I have      surely never laughed thereat. But they try to make out that this      innocent sport is a sort of crime, despite the fact that animals      have no souls, and although it is assuredly permitted to all men,      especially if they be of Royal birth, to make use of brute beasts      even unto death for purposes of honest recreation. But in this      land of England the people are so fond of animals that they treat      their animals better than their own servants. The stables and      dog-kennels are kept like palaces, and I have known great lords      who pass the night on the same litter with their horse. To crown      all, my noble Wife and Queen is barren, and these people have the      outrageous effrontery to declare that I am to blame and not she,      who is in other respects a most jealous and intractable woman,      and amorous to excess. Sir and Father, I pray daily that the Lord      God may have me in his grace, and I live in hopes that another      throne may be given me, even though it be with the Turk, what      time I still await that other glorious throne to which I shall      be one day called by the honour of being the son of your very      Glorious and Victorious Majesty.          (Signed) Phle.\"      To this letter the Emperor made reply in the following terms:          \"Sir and Son,--You have bitter enemies, I do not dispute it; but      you must try to endure them without vexation in anticipation of      the yet more brilliant crown that shall be yours hereafter. I have      already made it widely known that I am determined to retire from      my lordship over the Low Countries and other of my dominions,      for I am growing old and gouty, and I know that I shall not      long be able to withstand King Henry the Second of France, for      Fortune ever favours the young. You should remember also that      so long as you are master of England, you will be as a thorn in      the side of our enemy France. Truly I suffered a nasty defeat at      Metz, and lost there near forty thousand men. I was compelled      to retreat before the King of Saxony. If God does not soon see      fit by a stroke of His good and divine will to re-establish me      in the force and vigour of my prime, I am inclined, Sir and Son,      to quit my kingdoms altogether and to leave them to you.        \"Have patience therefore, and do your duty meanwhile against the      heretics, sparing none of them, man, woman, girl, or child, for      I am credibly informed that Madame your Queen has been minded to      treat them mercifully, and this is a great grief to me.          \"Your affectionate father,        \"(Signed) Charles.\"              XXX      Ulenspiegel had been long upon the road. His feet were bleeding,  but in the district of the bishopric of Mayence he met a wagon full  of pilgrims who invited him to join them, and they carried him with  them to Rome.    When they arrived at the city Ulenspiegel got down from the wagon,  and straightway noticed a charming-looking woman standing at the door  of an inn. She smiled when she saw him looking at her.    Taking this kindly humour of hers for a good omen:    \"Hostess,\" says he, \"will you give asile, pray, to a poor pilgrim on  pilgrimage who has carried his full time and is about to be delivered  of his sins?\"    \"We give asile to all such as pay us for it,\" said the woman.    I have a hundred ducats in my purse,\" said Ulenspiegel (who, in fact,  had no more than one), \"and I would dearly like to spend the first  of them in your pleasant company and over a bottle of old Roman wine.\"    \"Wine is not dear in these holy parts,\" she answered. \"Come in and  drink your fill. It will only cost you a soldo.\"    And they twain drank together for so long, and emptied so many bottles  of wine and all to the tune of such pleasant conversation, that the  hostess was constrained to order her servant to serve the customers in  her place, while she and Ulenspiegel retired into a room at the back of  the inn, a marble chamber, cool as a winter's day, where, leaning her  head on her new friend's shoulder, she demanded of him who he might be.    And Ulenspiegel answered her:    \"I am Lord of Geeland, Count of Gavergeeten, Baron of Tuchtendeel. I  was born at Damme, in Flanders, and I hold there for my estate five  and twenty acres of moonlight.\"    \"What land is that whence you come?\" the hostess asked him, drinking  from Ulenspiegel's tankard.    \"It is a misty land,\" he told her, \"a land of illusion, where are sown  the seeds of false hopes and of castles in the air. But you, sweet  hostess mine, were born in no such land of moonlight, you with your  amber skin and your eyes that shine like pearls. For bright is the  sunshine that has coloured that browned gold of your hair, and it is  Lady Venus herself who, without a single pang of jealousy, has formed  your soft shoulders, and your prancing breasts, your rounded arms,  your delicate sweet hands. Say, shall we sup together this night?\"    \"Fine pilgrim that you are from Flanders,\" says she, \"say, why are  you come hither?\"    \"To have a talk with the Pope,\" said Ulenspiegel.    \"Heavens!\" she cried, clasping her hands together, \"and that is  something that even myself, a native of the country, have never been  able to do!\"    \"Yet shall I,\" said Ulenspiegel.    \"But know you where the Pope lives, what he is like, what are his  habits and his ways of life?\"    \"I heard all about him on the way,\" answered Ulenspiegel. \"His name  is Julius III. Wanton he is, and gay and dissolute, a good talker,  that never falters for a clever repartee. I have also heard that  he has taken an extraordinary fancy to a little dirty beggar of a  man--a dark fellow and a rude who used to wander about with a monkey  asking for alms. He came to the Pope, and the Pope, it seems, has  made a Cardinal of him, and now gets quite ill if a single day passes  without their meeting.\"    \"Have some more to drink,\" said the landlady, \"and do not speak  so loud.\"    \"I have also heard,\" continued Ulenspiegel, \"that one day he swore  like a soldier, Al dispetto di Dio, potta di Dio, and all because they  did not bring him the cold peacock that he had ordered to be kept for  his supper. And he excused himself, saying, 'If my Master was angered  over an apple, I, who am the vicar of God, can certainly swear an  oath about a pheasant!' You see, my pet, I know the Pope very well,  and understand just what sort of a man he is!\"    \"Oh dear,\" she said, \"pray be careful and do not tell this to any  one else. But still, and in spite of all you tell me, I maintain that  you will not get to see him.\"    \"I shall,\" said Ulenspiegel.    \"I will wager you a hundred florins.\"    \"They are mine!\" said Ulenspiegel.    The very next day, tired as he was, he ran through all the city and  found out that the Pope was to say Mass that morning at the Church of  St. John Lateran. Thither Ulenspiegel repaired, and took up a position  as prominently in the Pope's view as he could. And every time that  the Pope elevated chalice or Host, Ulenspiegel turned his back to the  altar. Now one of the cardinals was officiating with the Pope, swarthy  of countenance he was, malicious and corpulent; and on his shoulder  he carried a monkey. He reported Ulenspiegel's behaviour to the Pope,  who straightway after Mass sent four terrible-looking soldiers (such  as one finds in those warlike lands) to seize the pilgrim.    \"What religion do you profess?\" the Pope asked him.    \"Most Holy Father,\" answered Ulenspiegel, \"my religion is the same  as my landlady's.\"    The Pope had the woman fetched.    \"What is your religion?\" he asked her.    \"The same as your Holiness's,\" she told him.    \"That also is mine,\" said Ulenspiegel.    The Pope asked him why he turned his back upon the Holy Sacrament.    \"I felt myself unworthy to look upon it face to face,\" he answered.    \"You are a pilgrim?\" said the Pope.    \"Yes,\" answered Ulenspiegel, \"and I am come from Flanders to beg  remission of my sins.\"    The Pope absolved and blessed him, and Ulenspiegel departed in the  company of his landlady, who paid over to him his hundred"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3760"],[0,"Sybil, Or, The Two Nations (#14)"],[1,"library and the kitchen,  and above them the cells and dormitory of the brethren. An imperfect  staircase, not without danger, led to these unroofed chambers; but  Egremont familiar with the way did not hesitate to pursue it, so that he  soon found himself on an elevation overlooking the garden, while  further on extended the vast cloisters of the monks, and adjoining was  a cemetery, that had once been enclosed, and communicated with the  cloister garden.    It was one of those summer days that are so still, that they seem as it  were a holiday of nature. The weary wind was sleeping in some grateful  cavern, and the sunbeams basking on some fervent knoll; the river  floated with a drowsy unconscious course: there was no wave in the  grass, no stir in the branches.    A silence so profound amid these solemn ruins, offered the perfection  of solitude; and there was that stirring in the mind of Egremont which  rendered him far from indisposed for this loneliness.    The slight words that he had exchanged with the farmer and the hind had  left him musing. Why was England not the same land as in the days of his  light-hearted youth? Why were these hard times for the poor? He stood  among the ruins that, as the farmer had well observed, had seen many  changes: changes of creeds, of dynasties, of laws, of manners. New  orders of men had arisen in the country, new sources of wealth had  opened, new dispositions of power to which that wealth had necessarily  led. His own house, his own order, had established themselves on the  ruins of that great body, the emblems of whose ancient magnificence and  strength surrounded him. And now his order was in turn menaced. And the  People--the millions of Toil, on whose unconscious energies during these  changeful centuries all rested--what changes had these centuries brought  to them? Had their advance in the national scale borne a due relation to  that progress of their rulers, which had accumulated in the treasuries  of a limited class the riches of the world; and made their possessors  boast that they were the first of nations; the most powerful and the  most free, the most enlightened, the most moral, and the most religious?  Were there any rick-burners in the times of the lord abbots? And if not,  why not? And why should the stacks of the Earls of Marney be destroyed,  and those of the Abbots of Marney spared?    Brooding over these suggestions, some voices disturbed him, and looking  round, he observed in the cemetery two men: one was standing beside a  tomb which his companion was apparently examining.    The first was of lofty stature, and though dressed with simplicity,  had nothing sordid in his appearance. His garments gave no clue to  his position in life: they might have been worn by a squire or by his  gamekeeper; a dark velveteen dress and leathern gaiters. As Egremont  caught his form, he threw his broad-brimmed country hat upon the ground  and showed a frank and manly countenance. His complexion might in youth  have been ruddy, but time and time's attendants, thought and passion,  had paled it: his chesnut hair, faded, but not grey, still clustered  over a noble brow; his features were regular and handsome, a well-formed  nose, the square mouth and its white teeth, and the clear grey eye which  befitted such an idiosyncracy. His time of vigorous manhood, for he was  much nearer forty than fifty years of age, perhaps better suited his  athletic form, than the more supple and graceful season of youth.    Stretching his powerful arms in the air, and delivering himself of  an exclamation which denoted his weariness, and which had broken the  silence, he expressed to his companion his determination to rest himself  under the shade of the yew in the contiguous garden, and inviting his  friend to follow him, he took up his hat and moved away.    There was something in the appearance of the stranger that interested  Egremont; and waiting till he had established himself in his pleasant  resting place, Egremont descended into the cloister garden and  determined to address him.          Book 2 Chapter 5        \"You lean against an ancient trunk,\" said Egremont, carelessly advancing  to the stranger, who looked up at him without any expression of  surprise, and then replied. \"They say 'tis the trunk beneath whose  branches the monks encamped when they came to this valley to raise their  building. It was their house, till with the wood and stone around them,  their labour and their fine art, they piled up their abbey. And then  they were driven out of it, and it came to this. Poor men! poor men!\"    \"They would hardly have forfeited their resting-place had they deserved  to retain it,\" said Egremont.    \"They were rich. I thought it was poverty that was a crime,\" replied the  stranger in a tone of simplicity.    \"But they had committed other crimes.\"    \"It may be so; we are very frail. But their history has been written by  their enemies; they were condemned without a hearing; the people rose  oftentimes in their behalf; and their property was divided with those on  whose reports it was forfeited.\"    \"At any rate, it was a forfeiture which gave life to the community,\"  said Egremont; \"the lands are held by active men and not by drones.\"    \"A drone is one who does not labour,\" said the stranger; \"whether he  wear a cowl or a coronet, 'tis the same to me. Somebody I suppose must  own the land; though I have heard say that this individual tenure is not  a necessity; but however this may be, I am not one who would object to  the lord, provided he were a gentle one. All agree the Monastics were  easy landlords; their rents were low; they granted leases in those days.  Their tenants too might renew their term before their tenure ran out: so  they were men of spirit and property. There were yeomen then, sir: the  country was not divided into two classes, masters and slaves; there was  some resting-place between luxury and misery. Comfort was an English  habit then, not merely an English word.\"    \"And do you really think they were easier landlords than our present  ones?\" said Egremont, inquiringly.    \"Human nature would tell us that, even if history did not confess it.  The Monastics could possess no private property; they could save no  money; they could bequeath nothing. They lived, received, and expended  in common. The monastery too was a proprietor that never died and never  wasted. The farmer had a deathless landlord then; not a harsh guardian,  or a grinding mortgagee, or a dilatory master in chancery, all was  certain; the manor had not to dread a change of lords, or the oaks to  tremble at the axe of the squandering heir. How proud we are still in  England of an old family, though, God knows, 'tis rare to see one now.  Yet the people like to say, We held under him, and his father and his  grandfather before him: they know that such a tenure is a benefit. The  abbot was ever the same. The monks were in short in every district a  point of refuge for all who needed succour, counsel, and protection; a  body of individuals having no cares of their own, with wisdom to guide  the inexperienced, with wealth to relieve the suffering, and often with  power to protect the oppressed.\"    \"You plead their cause with feeling,\" said Egremont, not unmoved.    \"It is my own; they were the sons of the People, like myself.\"    \"I had thought rather these monasteries were the resort of the younger  branches of the aristocracy?\" said Egremont.    \"Instead of the pension list;\" replied his companion, smiling, but not  with bitterness. \"Well, if we must have an aristocracy, I would sooner  that its younger branches should be monks and nuns, than colonels  without regiments, or housekeepers of royal palaces that exist only  in name. Besides see what advantage to a minister if the unendowed  aristocracy were thus provided for now. He need not, like a minister  in these days, entrust the conduct of public affairs to individuals  notoriously incompetent, appoint to the command of expeditions generals  who never saw a field, make governors of colonies out of men who never  could govern themselves, or find an ambassador in a broken dandy or  a blasted favourite. It is true that many of the monks and nuns were  persons of noble birth. Why should they not have been? The aristocracy  had their share; no more. They, like all other classes, were benefitted  by the monasteries: but the list of the mitred abbots when they were  suppressed, shows that the great majority of the heads of houses were of  the people.\"    \"Well, whatever difference of opinion may exist on these points,\" said  Egremont, \"there is one on which there can be no controversy: the monks  were great architects.\"    \"Ah! there it is,\" said the stranger, in a tone of plaintiveness; \"if  the world but only knew what they had lost! I am sure that not the  faintest idea is generally prevalent of the appearance of England before  and since the dissolution. Why, sir, in England and Wales alone, there  were of these institutions of different sizes; I mean monasteries, and  chantries and chapels, and great hospitals; considerably upwards of  three thousand; all of them fair buildings, many of them of exquisite  beauty. There were on an average in every shire at least twenty  structures such as this was; in this great county double that number:  establishments that were as vast and as magnificent and as beautiful as  your Belvoirs and your Chatsworths, your Wentworths and your Stowes. Try  to imagine the effect of thirty or forty Chatsworths in this county  the proprietors of which were never absent. You complain enough now  of absentees. The monks were never non-resident. They expended their  revenue among those whose labour had produced it. These holy men too  built and planted as they did everything else for posterity: their  churches were cathedrals; their schools colleges; their halls and  libraries the muniment rooms of kingdoms;"]]]
