Fortunately, nobody need believe the story.    [Illustration: _The Castle Gate, Guildford._]    An environment of meaner modern buildings has spoiled the setting in  which the castle should stand. Seen from certain points, especially from  below, the keep is not a very imposing structure; you cannot get far  enough away from it. Far the best view is to be had from the rising  ground to the south-east, where you can set the castle in outline  against the sky. Then it takes on something of the romance of a Norman  ruin, with its tumbling masses of ivy, its broken battlements, and the  mixed greys and ochres of its masonry. The interior is uninteresting,  except for the sad little carvings left by prisoners on the walls, among  them a crucifix, a hermit, St. Catherine's wheel, and St. Christopher.  If St. Christopher was not exactly the patron saint of prisoners, he was  the kindliest saint to carve on a dungeon wall. If you looked on St.  Christopher you were safe, at least for that day, from sudden death. How  many thousand days of \"safety\" he must have brought to the Guildford  prisoners!    The castle enceinte is now laid out as a pleasure ground, with all a  public garden's advantages and disadvantages. Public taste demands  \"bedding out,\" even though geraniums and calceolarias fit unhappily  enough with masonry fourteen feet thick and Saxon earthworks. A bowling  green is in its proper place; thorns and old rose-trees have a right to  grow round ruined castles; wallflowers belong to stones and mortar. But  lobelias do not. Still, something even worse than bedding-out might have  befallen the Castle grounds. Dr. G.C. Williamson, in his valuable little  book _Guildford in the Olden Time_, mentions that, when the grounds were  bought for the Corporation in 1886, premiums were offered to various  landscape gardeners for plans showing the best means of laying out the  space. One of the plans which was rejected, although attractive in other  ways, \"started its schedule of work with a suggestion that the ugly ruin  in the centre of the grounds should be removed, and in lieu of it should  be erected a light iron bandstand painted green, picked out with gold.\"  What, one wonders, were the other attractions of the \"landscape\"?    Just possibly Guildford Castle was for some time a royal residence.  Nearly all the old kings used to visit the country round for hunting and  hawking. Henry II, soon after he came to the throne, enclosed a large  tract of land north of Guildown and made it into a royal park, but  whether, when he came to hunt, he stayed at the Castle itself or at the  palace which was built in the park, none of the chroniclers say. The  palace has long since disappeared, though it is said that the outline  can be traced when the land on which it stood is under corn. The corn is  supposed to turn a different colour along the lines of the foundations.  In later days, the kings certainly stayed at the palace, and not at the  Castle. John was at Guildford nineteen times in eleven years, and kept  Christmas there in 1200 \"with uncommon splendour and magnificence.\"  Henry III had his wines stored at Guildford, probably in the caverns  near the Castle, and once, with a capital eye for business, ordered that  no other wines should be sold in the bailiwick of Surrey until his had  found a buyer. Edward I, according to an untrustworthy story, brought  Adam Gordon, a highway robber, to Guildford after he had fought and  beaten him with his own royal hands, and forgiven him afterwards. The  next two Edwards were often at the palace; Henry VI and Edward IV lay  there; Henry VII made Sir Reginald Bray, ancestor of Surrey's historian,  keeper of the Park and Manor; Henry VIII hunted in the park, and  Elizabeth travelled about so frequently between the royal residences at  Guildford and elsewhere that the county actually framed a remonstrance  against having to pay so much for her carriages and horses. She was  probably the last of the sovereigns to ride through the town from north  to south, though Charles II was feasted there at the Restoration and  presented with a service of plate, a proceeding which swamped the  Corporation in debt.    One other distinction Guildford owes to its associations with kings. It  has been selected as the scene of a remarkable novel by a remarkable  writer. Martin Tupper, in his preface to _Stephan Langton_, takes a  devoted public into his confidence as to the manner in which such a book  should be, and indeed actually was, completed. He set out to write a  historical novel dealing with Guildford in the days of King John,  weaving into it various local legends and a love-story of an abbess and  an archbishop; he \"began the book on November 26, 1857, and finished it  in exactly eight weeks, on January 21, 1858, reading for the work  included.\" The list of books which he consulted in Mr. Drummond's  library at Albury must be read in full for the mere physical labour of  the business to be appreciated; but after such abstruse searchings, to  have crammed into ninety thousand words of solid print such a  concatenation of murders, arsons, slayings, swoonings, drownings and  burnings must always remain a considerable achievement. The story itself  is sad stuff.    Apart from palaces, Guildford's history, until comparatively recent  times, has been the history of the wool trade and cloth manufacture. The  beginnings of the industry go back to the settlement in the south of  England, in the reign of Edward III, of Flemish weavers and dyers.  Guildford naturally attracted the trade, for sheep could be successfully  farmed on the downs, water-power for the fulling-mills could be had from  the Wey, and the best fuller's earth in the country was to be had from  Nutfield and elsewhere, only a few miles away. The fuller's teazle, and  woad for dyeing, also grew, and still grow, I learn from Dr. Williamson,  though I have not found either, in the neighbourhood. Before the end of  the fourteenth century the cloth industry had come to the dignity of  legislation. Nobody might buy cloth before it had been \"fulled and fully  performed in its nature\"; this was to prevent dishonest people from  stretching the cloth and so giving the public short measure. Later,  under the Tudors, nobody might manufacture cloth except in a market-town  where cloth had been manufactured for ten years past. This was no doubt  for the convenience of the ulnagers, officers deputed to measure and  seal all cloth brought to market. It was highly illegal to stretch cloth  in any way. Thomas West, of Guildford, in 1607, was charged with having  used \"a certain instrument (a tenter) and other engines wherewith 100  cloths of white wool called kerseys, rough and unwrought and made for  sale at Guildford, were stretched and strained in breadth and length.\"  On another occasion five clothiers were summoned to answer a charge of  having used \"a certaine engine called a rope\" to stretch their cloth. So  important a part of Guildford's life had clothmaking become under  Elizabeth that the Corporation required special acknowledgment of the  fact from the innkeepers, doubtless because prosperity in the town meant  full tankards emptied at the inns. Every alehouse keeper had to have a  signboard hung above his door with a woolsack painted on it, under a  fine of six-and-eightpence; he had to buy the sign from the hall warden  at the Town Hall, and pay two shillings for it. Woolsacks were added to  the borough arms. Yet the prosperity of the trade was short-lived, after  all. The pride of Guildford's industry fell. Less than fifty years after  the alehouse signs swung woolpacks to guide thirsty clothiers, the  business came down with a run. Godalming, Farnham, and Wonersh were  other flourishing centres of the trade, and in 1630 one Samuel Vassall,  the merchant who took the Godalming and Wonersh cloth for shipment  abroad, failed his customers. He was under arrest, and no one else could  be found to take up his contracts. All the Godalming eggs were in one  basket, and Guildford and Farnham suffered in sympathy. Three thousand  workers were in distress; it was the beginning of the end. It could not  have happened, of course, if Samuel Vassall's failure had been the only  difficulty. That would have been got over somehow. But there was another  agent at work. The real cause of the destruction of the Surrey cloth  industry was the fact that for years the Company of Merchant Adventurers  and the London Drapers' Company had been working to get the cloth trade  into their own hands, and they had practically succeeded. Godalming held  on for a time; but Guildford, Wonersh, and Farnham went under.    Aubrey is not content with so simple an explanation. He scents a  swindler. The trade of Wonersh, he writes, \"chiefly consisted in making  blue cloth for the Canary Islands; the decay and indeed ruin of their  trade was their avaricious method of stretching their cloth from 18  yards to 22 or 23, which being discovered abroad, they returned their  commodity on their hands and it would sell at no market. The same  fraudulent practice caused the decay of the Blews at Guildford.\" He  probably muddled up musty scandals with the effect of pure business  competition. He is not the last to make mistakes connected with a  vanished trade. There still lingers a superstition at Guildford that  Rack Close, not far from the Castle, is the place where unfortunate  prisoners (perhaps the Jews whom Martin Tupper describes as suffering  agonies of enforced dentistry and other tortures) were stretched upon  the rack. It is, of course, the plot of ground on which were set up the  wooden racks, or frames, on which the Guildford blue cloth was stretched  and dried in the wind and sun.    Guildford was singularly happy in its lack of history during the  Parliamentary"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2808"],[0,"Treatises on Friendship and Old Age (#14)"],[1,"that there did exist  something intrinsically noble and great, which was sought for its own  sake, and at which all the best men aimed, to the contempt and neglect  of pleasure. Why then do I spend so many words on the subject of  pleasure? Why, because, far from being a charge against old age, that it  does not much feel the want of any pleasures, it is its highest praise.    But, you will say, it is deprived of the pleasures of the table, the  heaped up board, the rapid passing of the wine-cup. Well, then, it is  also free from headache, disordered digestion, broken sleep. But if we  must grant pleasure something, since we do not find it easy to resist  its charms,--for Plato, with happy inspiration, calls pleasure \"vice's  bait,\" because of course men are caught by it as fish by a hook,--yet,  although old age has to abstain from extravagant banquets, it is still  capable of enjoying modest festivities. As a boy I often used to see  Gaius Duilius the son of Marcus, then an old man, returning from  a dinner-party. He thoroughly enjoyed the frequent use of torch and  flute-player, distinctions which he had assumed though unprecedented in  the case of a private person. It was the privilege of his glory. But why  mention others? I will come back to my own case. To begin with, I have  always remained a member of a \"club\"--clubs, you know, were established  in my quaestorship on the reception of the Magna Mater from Ida. So I  used to dine at their feast with the members of my club--on the whole  with moderation, though there was a certain warmth of temperament  natural to my time of life; but as that advances there is a daily  decrease of all excitement. Nor was I, in fact, ever wont to measure  my enjoyment even of these banquets by the physical pleasures they gave  more than by the gathering and conversation of friends. For it was  a good idea of our ancestors to style the presence of guests at a  dinner-table--seeing that it implied a community of enjoyment--a  _convivium_, \"a living together.\" It is a better term than the Greek  words which mean \"a drinking together,\" or, \"an eating together.\" For  they would seem to give the preference to what is really the least  important part of it.    14. For myself, owing to the pleasure I take in conversation, I enjoy  even banquets that begin early in the afternoon, and not only in company  with my contemporaries--of whom very few survive--but also with men  of your age and with yourselves. I am thankful to old age, which has  increased my avidity for conversation, while it has removed that for  eating and drinking. But if anyone does enjoy these--not to seem to have  proclaimed war against all pleasure without exception, which is perhaps  a feeling inspired by nature--I fail to perceive even in these very  pleasures that old age is entirely without the power of appreciation.  For myself, I take delight even in the old-fashioned appointment of  master of the feast; and in the arrangement of the conversation, which  according to ancestral custom is begun from the last place on the  left-hand couch when the wine is brought in; as also in the cups which,  as in Xenophon's banquet, are small and filled by driblets; and in the  contrivance for cooling in summer, and for warming by the winter sun or  winter fire. These things I keep up even among my Sabine countrymen, and  every day have a full dinner-party of neighbours, which we prolong as  far into the night as we can with varied conversation.    But you may urge--there is not the same tingling sensation of pleasure  in old men. No doubt; but neither do they miss it so much. For nothing  gives you uneasiness which you do not miss. That was a fine answer of  Sophocles to a man who asked him, when in extreme old age, whether he  was still a lover. \"Heaven forbid!\" he replied; \"I was only too glad to  escape from that, as though from a boorish and insane master.\" To  men indeed who are keen after such things it may possibly appear  disagreeable and uncomfortable to be without them; but to jaded  appetites it is pleasanter to lack than to enjoy. However, he cannot be  said to lack who does not want: my contention is that not to want is the  pleasanter thing.    But even granting that youth enjoys these pleasures with more zest; in  the first place, they are insignificant things to enjoy, as I have said;  and in the second place, such as age is not entirely without, if it  does not possess them in profusion. Just as a man gets greater pleasure  from Ambivius Turpio if seated in the front row at the theatre than if  he was in the last, yet, after all, the man in the last row does get  pleasure; so youth, because it looks at pleasures at closer quarters,  perhaps enjoys itself more, yet even old age, looking at them from  a distance, does enjoy itself well enough. Why, what blessings are  these--that the soul, having served its time, so to speak, in the  campaigns of desire and ambition, rivalry and hatred, and all the  passions, should live in its own thoughts, and, as the expression goes,  should dwell apart! Indeed, if it has in store any of what I may call  the food of study and philosophy, nothing can be pleasanter than an  old age of leisure. We were witnesses to C. Gallus--a friend of your  father's, Scipio--intent to the day of his death on mapping out the sky  and land. How often did the light surprise him while still working out  a problem begun during the night! How often did night find him busy on  what he had begun at dawn! How he delighted in predicting for us solar  and lunar eclipses long before they occurred! Or again in studies of  a lighter nature, though still requiring keenness of intellect, what  pleasure Naevius took in his _Punic War_! Plautus in his _Truculentus_  and _Pseudolus_! I even saw Livius Andronicus, who, having produced  a play six years before I was born--in the consulship of Cento and  Tuditanus--lived till I had become a young man. Why speak of Publius  Licinius Crassus's devotion to pontifical and civil law, or of the  Publius Scipio of the present time, who within these last few days  has been created Pontifex Maximus? And yet I have seen all whom I have  mentioned ardent in these pursuits when old men. Then there is Marcus  Cethegus, whom Ennius justly called \"Persuasion's Marrow\"--with what  enthusiasm did we see him exert himself in oratory even when quite old!  What pleasures are there in feasts, games, or mistresses comparable to  pleasures such as these? And they are all tastes, too, connected with  learning, which in men of sense and good education grow with their  growth. It is indeed an honourable sentiment which Solon expresses in a  verse which I have quoted before--that he grew old learning many a fresh  lesson every day. Than that intellectual pleasure none certainly can be  greater.    15. I come now to the pleasures of the farmer, in which I take amazing  delight. These are not hindered by any extent of old age, and seem to  me to approach nearest to the ideal wise man's life. For he has to deal  with the earth, which never refuses its obedience, nor ever returns  what it has received without usury; sometimes, indeed, with less, but  generally with greater interest. For my part, however, it is not merely  the thing produced, but the earth's own force and natural productiveness  that delight me. For received in its bosom the seed scattered broadcast  upon it, softened and broken up, she first keeps it concealed therein  (hence the harrowing which accomplishes this gets its name from a word  meaning \"to hide\"); next, when it has been warmed by her heat and close  pressure, she splits it open and draws from it the greenery of the  blade. This, supported by the fibres of the root, little by little grows  up, and held upright by its jointed stalk is enclosed in sheaths, as  being still immature. When it has emerged from them it produces an ear  of corn arranged in order, and is defended against the pecking of the  smaller birds by a regular palisade of spikes.    Need I mention the starting, planting, and growth of vines? I can never  have too much of this pleasure--to let you into the secret of what gives  my old age repose and amusement. For I say nothing here of the natural  force which all things propagated from the earth possess--the earth  which from that tiny grain in a fig, or the grape-stone in a grape, or  the most minute seeds of the other cereals and plants, produces such  huge trunks and boughs. Mallet-shoots, slips, cuttings, quicksets,  layers--are they not enough to fill anyone with delight and  astonishment? The vine by nature is apt to fall, and unless supported  drops down to the earth; yet in order to keep itself upright it embraces  whatever it reaches with its tendrils as though they were hands. Then  as it creeps on, spreading itself in intricate and wild profusion, the  dresser's art prunes it with the knife and prevents it growing a forest  of shoots and expanding to excess in every direction. Accordingly at the  beginning of spring in the shoots which have been left there protrudes  at each of the joints what is termed an eye. From this the grape emerges and  shows itself; which, swollen by the juice of the earth and the heat  of the sun, is at first very bitter to the taste, but afterwards grows  sweet as it matures; and being covered with tendrils is never without a  moderate warmth, and yet is able to ward off the fiery heat of the sun.  Can anything be richer in product or more beautiful to contemplate?  It is not its utility only, as I said before, that charms me, but the  method of its cultivation and the natural process of its growth: the  rows of uprights, the cross-pieces for the tops of the plants, the tying  up of the vines and their propagation by layers, the pruning, to which  I have already referred, of some shoots, the setting of others. I need  hardly mention irrigation, or trenching and digging the soil, which much  increase"]]]
