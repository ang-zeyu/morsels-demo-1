[Illustration: The wide-spreading black walnut]    The black walnut is a grand tree from any point of view, even though it  so fully absorbs all water and fertility as to check other growth under  its great reach of branches. The lines it presents to the winter sky are  as rugged as those of the oak, but there is a great difference. And this  ruggedness is held far into the spring, for the black walnut makes no  slightest apparent effort at growth until all the other trees are  greening the countryside. Then with a rush come the luxuriant and  tropical compound leaves, soon attaining their full dignity, and adding  to it also a smooth polish on the upper surface. The walnut's flowers I  have missed seeing, I am sorry to say, while registering a mental  promise not to permit another season to pass without having that  pleasure.    Late in the year the foliage has become scanty, and the nut-clusters  hang fascinatingly clear, far above one's head, to tempt the climb and  the club. The black walnut is a tree that needs our care; for furniture  fashion long used its close-grained, heavy, handsome wood as cruelly as  the milliners did the herons of Florida from which were torn the  \"aigrets,\" now happily \"out of style.\" Though walnut furniture is no  longer the most popular, the deadly work has been done, for the most  part, and but few of these wide-spread old forest monarchs yet remain.  Scientific forestry is now providing, in many plantings, and in many  places, another \"crop\" of walnut timber, grown to order, and using waste  land. It is to such really beneficent, though entirely commercial work,  that we must look for the future of many of our best trees.    The butternut, or white walnut, has never seemed so interesting to me,  nor its fruit so palatable, probably because I have seen less of it. The  so-called \"English\" walnut, which is really the Persian walnut, is not  hardy in the eastern part of the United States, and, while a tree of  vast commercial importance in the far West, does not come much into the  view of a lover of the purely American trees.    [Illustration: The American sweet chestnut]    Of the American sweet chestnut as a delightful nut-fruit I need say  nothing more than that it fully holds its place against \"foreign  intervention\" from the East; even though these European and Japanese  chestnuts with their California-bred progeny give us fruit that is much  larger, and borne on trees of very graceful habit. No one with  discrimination will for a moment hesitate, after eating a nut of both,  to cheerfully choose the American native as best worth his commendation,  though he may come to understand the food value, after cooking, of the  chestnuts used so freely in parts of Europe.    [Illustration: Sweet chestnut blossoms]    As a forest tree, however, our American sweet chestnut has a place of  its own. Naturally spreading in habit when growing where there is room  to expand, it easily accommodates itself to the more cramped conditions  of our great woodlands, and shoots upward to light and air, making  rapidly a clean and sturdy stem. What a beautiful and stately tree it  is! And when, late in the spring, or indeed right on the threshold of  summer, its blooming time comes, it stands out distinctly, having then  few rivals in the eye of the tree-lover. The locust and the tulip are  just about done with their floral offering upon the altar of the year  when the long creamy catkins of the sweet chestnut spring out from the  fully perfected dark green leaf-clusters. Peculiarly graceful are these  great bloom heads, high in the air, and standing nearly erect, instead  of hanging down as do the catkins of the poplars and the birches. The  odor of the chestnut flower is heavy, and is best appreciated far above  in the great tree, where it may mingle with the warm air of June,  already bearing a hundred sweet scents.    There stands bright in my remembrance one golden June day when I came  through a gateway into a wonderful American garden of purely native  plants maintained near Philadelphia, the rock-bound drive guarded by two  clumps of tall chestnuts, one on either side, and both in full glory of  bloom. There could not have been a more beautiful, natural, or dignified  entrance; and it was just as beautiful in the early fall, when the deep  green of the oblong-toothed leaves had changed to clear and glowing  yellow, while the flowers had left their perfect work in the swelling  and prickly green burs which hid nuts of a brown as rich as the flesh  was sweet.    Did you, gentle reader, ever saunter through a chestnut grove in the  later fall, when the yellow had been browned by the frosts which brought  to the ground alike leaves and remaining burs? There is something  especially pleasant in the warmth of color and the crackle of sound on  the forest floor, as one really shuffles through chestnut leaves in the  bracing November air, stooping now and then for a nut perchance  remaining in the warm and velvety corner of an opened bur.    Here in Pennsylvania, and south of Mason and Dixon's line, there grows a  delightful small tree, brother to the chestnut, bearing especially sweet  little nuts which we know as chinquapins. They are darker brown, and the  flesh is very white, and rich in flavor. I could wish that the  chinquapin, as well as the chestnut, was included among the trees that  enlightened Americans would plant along roadsides and lanes, with other  fruit trees; the specific secondary purpose, after the primary enjoyment  of form, foliage and flower, being to let the future passer-by eat  freely of that fruit provided by the Creator for food and pleasure, and  costing no more trouble or expense than the purely ornamental trees more  frequently planted.    Both chestnut and chinquapin are beautiful ornamental trees; and some of  the newer chestnut hybrids, of parentage between the American and the  European species, are as graceful as the most highly petted lawn trees  of the nurserymen. Indeed, the very same claim may be made for a score  or more of the standard fruit trees, alike beautiful in limb tracery, in  bloom, and in the seed-coverings that we are glad to eat; and some time  we shall be ashamed not to plant the fruit trees in public places, for  the pleasure and the refreshing of all who care.    [Illustration: The chinquapin]    One of the commonest nut trees, and certainly one of the most pleasing,  is the hickory. There are hickories and hickories, and some are  shellbarks, while others are bitternuts or pignuts. The form most  familiar to the Eastern States is the shagbark hickory, and its  characteristic upright trees, tall and finely shaped, never  wide-spreading as is the chestnut under the encouragement of plenty of  room and food, are admirable from any standpoint. There is a lusty old  shagbark in Wetzel's Swamp that has given me many a pleasant  quarter-hour, as I have stood at attention before its symmetrical stem,  hung with slabs of brown bark that seem always just ready to separate  from the trunk.    The aspect of this tree is reflected in its very useful timber, which is  pliant but tough, requiring less \"heft\" for a given strength, and  bending with a load easily, only to instantly snap back to its position  when the stress slackens. Good hickory is said to be stronger than  wrought iron, weight for weight; and I will answer for it that no  structure of iron can ever have half the grace, as well as strength,  freely displayed by this same old shagbark of the lowlands near my home.    Curious as I am to see the blooms of the trees I am getting acquainted  with, there are many disappointments to be endured--as when the favorite  tree under study is reached a day too late, and I must wait a year for  another opportunity. It was, therefore, with much joy that I found that  a trip carefully timed for another fine old hickory along the  Conodoguinet--an Indian-named stream of angles, curves, many trees and  much beauty--had brought me to the quickly passing bloom feast of this  noble American tree. The leaves were about half-grown and half-colored,  which means that they displayed an elegance of texture and hue most  pleasing to see. And the flowers--there they were, hanging under the  twigs in long clusters of what I might describe as ends of chenille, if  it were not irreverent to compare these delicate greenish catkins with  anything man-made!    [Illustration: A shagbark hickory in bloom]    This fine shagbark was kind to the cameraman, for some of its lower  branches drooped and hung down close enough to the \"bars\" of the rail  fence to permit the photographic eye to be turned on them. Then came the  tantalizing wait for stillness! I have frequently found that a wind,  absolutely unnoticeable before, became obtrusively strong just when the  critical moment arrived, and I have fancied that the lightly hung  leaflets I have waited upon fairly shook with merriment as they received  the gentle zephyr, imperceptible to my heated brow, but vigorous enough  to keep them moving. Often, too--indeed nearly always--I have found that  after exhausting my all too scanty stock of patience, and making an  \"exposure\" in despair, the errant blossoms and leaflets would settle  down into perfect immobility, as if to say, \"There! don't be  cross--we'll behave,\" when it was too late.    But the shagbark at last was good to me, and I could leave with the  comfortable feeling that I was carrying away a little bit of nature's  special work, a memorandum of her rather private processes of  fruit-making, without injuring any part of the inspected trees. It has  been a sorrow to me that I have not seen that great hickory later in the  year, when the clusters of tassels have become bunches of husk-covered  nuts.

At this juncture Uriah the Hittite offered him his  services, but under the condition that David secure him an  Israelitish wife. David accepted the condition, and Uriah in turn  showed him how the various suits of armor were fastened together  at the heels of the giant's feet.    David's victory naturally added fuel to the fire of Saul's jealousy.  Saul sent Abner, his general, to make inquiry whether David, who,  he knew, was of the tribe of Judah, belonged to the clan of the  Perez or to the clan of the Zerah. In the former case his suspicion  that David was destined for kingship would be confirmed. Doeg,  David's enemy from of old, observed that David, being the  descendant of the Moabitess Ruth, did not even belong to the  Jewish communion, and Saul need entertain no fears from that  quarter. A lively discussion arose between Abner and Doeg, as to  whether the law in Deuteronomy regarding Moabites affected  women as well as men. Doeg, an expert dialectician, brilliantly  refuted all of Abner's arguments in favor of the admission of  Moabitish women. Samuel's authority had to be appealed to in  order to establish for all times the correctness of Abner's view.  (44) Indeed, the dispute could be settled only by recourse to threats  of violence. Ithra, the father of Amasa, in Arab fashion, for which  reason he was sometimes called the Ishmaelite, threatened to hew  down any one with his sword who refused to accept Samuel's  interpretation of the law, that male Moabites and male Ammonites  are forever excluded from the congregation of Israel, but not  Moabite and Ammonite women. (45)      PURSUED BY SAUL    As God stood by David in his duel with Goliath, so he stood by  him in many other of his difficulties. Often when he thought all  hope lost, the arm of God suddenly succored him, and in  unexpected ways, not only bringing relief, but also conveying  instruction on God's wise and just guidance of the world.    David once said to God: \"The world is entirely beautiful and good,  with the one exception of insanity. What use does the world derive  from a lunatic, who runs hither and thither, tears his clothes, and is  pursued by a mob of hooting children?\" \"Verily, a time will come,\"  said God in reply, \"when thou wilt supplicate me to afflict thee  with madness.\" Now, it happened when David, on his flight before  Saul, came to Achish, the king of the Philistines, who lived in  Gath, that the brothers of Goliath formed the heathen king's  body-guard, and they demanded that their brother's murderer be  executed. Achish, though a heathen, was pious, for which reason  he is called Abimelech in the Psalms, after the king of Gerar, who  also was noted for piety. He therefore sought to pacify David's  enemies. He called their attention to the fact that Goliath had been  the one to challenge the Jews to combat, and it was meet,  therefore, that he should be left to bear the consequences. The  brothers rejoined, if that view prevailed, then Achish would have  to give up his throne to David, for, according to the conditions of  the combat, the victor was to have dominion over the vanquished  as his servants. In his distress, David besought God to let him  appear a madman in the eyes of Achish and his court. God granted  his prayer. As the wife and daughter of the Philistine king were  both bereft of reason, we can understand his exclamation: \"Do I  lack madmen, that ye have brought this fellow to play the madman  in my presence?\" Thus it was that David was rescued. Thereupon  he composed the Psalm beginning with the words, \"I will bless the  Lord at all times,\" which includes even the time of lunacy. (46)    On another occasion David expressed his doubt of God's wisdom  in having formed such apparently useless creatures as spiders are.  They do nothing but spin a web that has no value. He was to have  striking proof that even a spider's web may serve an important  purpose. On one occasion he had taken refuge in a cave, and Saul  and his attendants, in pursuit of him, were about to enter and seek  him there. But God sent a spider to weave its web across the  opening, and Saul told his men to desist from fruitless search in  the cave, for the spider's web was undeniable proof that no one had  passed through its entrance. (47)    Similarly, when David became indebted to one of them for his life,  he was cured of his scorn for wasps. He had thought them good for  nothing but to breed maggots. David once surprised Saul and his  attendants while they were fast asleep in their camp, and he  resolved to carry off, as proof of his magnanimity, the cruse that  stood between the feet of the giant Abner, who like the rest was  sleeping. Fortunately his knees were drawn up, so that David could  carry out his intention unhindered. But as David was retiring with  the cruse, Abner stretched out his feet, and pinned David down as  with two solid pillars. His life would have been forfeit, if a wasp  had not stung Abner, who mechanically, in his sleep, moved his  feet, and released David. (48)    There were still other miracles that happened to David in his  flight. Once, when Saul and his men compassed David round  about, an angel appeared and summoned him home, to repulse the  raid of the Philistines upon the land. Saul gave up the pursuit of  David, but only after a majority had so decided, for some had been  of the opinion that the seizure of David was quite as important as  the repulse of the Philistines. (49) Again, in his battle with the  Amalekites, David enjoyed direct intervention from above.  Lightning in flashes and sheets illumined the dark night, so  enabling him to carry on the struggle. (50)      WARS    David's first thought after ascending the throne was to wrest  Jerusalem, sacred since the days of Adam, Noah, and Abraham,  from the grasp of the heathen. The plan was not easy of execution  for various reasons. The Jebusites, the possessors of Jerusalem,  were the posterity of those sons of Heth who had ceded the Cave  of Machpelah to Abraham only on condition that their descendants  should never be forcibly dispossessed of their capital city  Jerusalem. In perpetuation of this agreement between Abraham  and the sons of Heth, monuments of brass were erected, and when  David approached Jerusalem with hostile intent, the Jebusites  pointed to Abraham's promise engraven upon them and still plainly  to be read. (51) They maintained that before David could take the  city, which they had surrounded with a high wall, he would have to  destroy the monuments. Joab devised a plan of getting into  Jerusalem. He set up a tall cypress tree near the wall, bent it  downward, and standing on David's head, he grasped the very tip  of the tree. When the tree rebounded, Joab sat high above the wall,  and could jump down upon it. Once in the city, he destroyed the  monuments, and possessed himself of Jerusalem. (52) For David a  miracle had happened; the wall had lowered itself before him so  that he could walk into the city without difficulty. David, however,  was not desirous of using forcible means. He therefore offered the  Jebusites six hundred shekels, fifty shekels for each Israelitish  tribe. The Jebusites accepted the money, and gave David a bill of  sale. (53)    Jerusalem having been acquired, David had to prepare for war  with the Philistines, in which the king gave proof at once of his  heroic courage and his unshakable trust in God. The latter quality  he displayed signally in the battle that took place in the Valley of  the Giants. God had commanded David not to attack the host of  the Philistines until he heard \"the sound of marching in the tops of  the mulberry trees.\" God desired to pass judgment upon the  tutelary angels of the heathen, before surrendering the heathen  themselves to the pious, (54) and the motion of the tops of the  trees was to indicate that the battle could proceed. The enemy  advanced until there were but four ells between them and the  Israelites. The latter were about to throw themselves against the  Philistines, but David restrained them, saying: \"God forbade me to  attack the Philistines before the tops of the trees begin to move. If  we transgress God's command, we shall certainly die. If we delay,  it is probable that we shall be killed by the Philistines, but, at least,  we shall die as pious men that keep God's command. Above all, let  us have confidence in God.\" Scarcely had he ended his speech  when the tops of the trees rustled, and David made a successful  assault upon the Philistines. Whereupon God said to the angels,  who were constantly questioning him as to why he had taken the  royal dignity from Saul and given it to David: \"See the difference  between Saul and David.\" (55)    Of David's other campaigns, the most notable is his war with  Shobach the Aramean, whom he conquered in spite of his gigantic  size and strength. Shobach was very tall, as tall as a dove-cote, and  one look at him sufficed to strike terror to the heart of the  beholder. (56) The Aramean general indulged in the belief that  David would treat the Syrians gently on account of the monument,  still in existence at that time, which Jacob and Laban had erected  on the frontier between Palestine and Aram as a sign of their  covenant that neither they nor their descendants should wage war  with each other. But David destroyed the monument. (57)  Similarly, the Philistines had placed trust in a relic from Isaac, the  bridle of a mule which the Patriarch had given to Abimelech, the  king of the Philistines, as a pledge of the covenant between Israel  and his people. David took it from them by force. (58)    However, David was as just as he was bold. Disregard of the  covenants made by the Patriarchs was far removed from his  thoughts. Indeed, before departing for the wars with the Arameans  and the Philistines, he"]]]
