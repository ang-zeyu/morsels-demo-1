Indeed, they often destroyed their household utensils, tepees and  clothing, and killed their horses on the graves of the dead, in the  fulfillment of a superstitious custom, which demanded that they  should undergo, while mourning for their kindred, the deepest  privation in a property sense.  Everything the loss of which would  make them poor was sacrificed on the graves of their relatives or  distinguished warriors, and as melancholy because of removal from  their old homes caused frequent deaths, there was no lack of occasion  for the sacrifices.  The widows and orphans of the dead warriors were  of course the chief mourners, and exhibited their grief in many  peculiar ways.  I remember one in particular which was universally  practiced by the near kinsfolk.  They would crop their hair very  close, and then cover the head with a sort of hood or plaster of  black pitch, the composition being clay, pulverized charcoal, and the  resinous gum which exudes from the pine-tree.  The hood, nearly an  inch in thickness, was worn during a period of mourning that lasted  through the time it would take nature, by the growth of the hair,  actually to lift from the head the heavy covering of pitch after it  had become solidified and hard as stone.  It must be admitted that  they underwent considerable discomfort in memory of their relatives.  It took all the influence we could bring to bear to break up these  absurdly superstitious practices, and it looked as if no permanent  improvement could be effected, for as soon as we got them to discard  one, another would be invented.  When not allowed to burn down their  tepees or houses, those poor souls who were in a dying condition  would be carried out to the neighboring hillsides just before  dissolution, and there abandoned to their sufferings, with little or  no attention, unless the placing under their heads of a small stick  of wood--with possibly some laudable object, but doubtless great  discomfort to their victim--might be considered such.    To uproot these senseless and monstrous practices was indeed most  difficult.  The most pernicious of all was one which was likely to  bring about tragic results.  They believed firmly in a class of  doctors among their people who professed that they could procure the  illness of an individual at will, and that by certain incantations  they could kill or cure the sick person.  Their faith in this  superstition was so steadfast that there was no doubting its  sincerity, many indulging at times in the most trying privations,  that their relatives might be saved from death at the hands of the  doctors.  I often talked with them on the subject, and tried to  reason them out of the superstitious belief, defying the doctors to  kill me, or even make me ill; but my talks were unavailing, and they  always met my arguments with the remark that I was a white man, of a  race wholly different from the red man, and that that was the reason  the medicine of the doctors would not affect me.  These villainous  doctors might be either men or women, and any one of them finding an  Indian ill, at once averred that his influence was the cause,  offering at the same time to cure the invalid for a fee, which  generally amounted to about all the ponies his family possessed.  If  the proposition was accepted and the fee paid over, the family, in  case the man died, was to have indemnity through the death of the  doctor, who freely promised that they might take his life in such  event, relying on his chances of getting protection from the furious  relatives by fleeing to the military post till time had so assuaged  their grief that matters could be compromised or settled by a  restoration of a part of the property, when the rascally leeches  could again resume their practice.  Of course the services of a  doctor were always accepted when an Indian fell ill; otherwise the  invalid's death would surely ensue, brought about by the evil  influence that was unpropitiated.  Latterly it had become quite the  thing, when a patient died, for the doctor to flee to our camp--it  was so convenient and so much safer than elsewhere--and my cellar was  a favorite place of refuge from the infuriated friends of the  deceased.    Among the most notable of these doctors was an Indian named Sam  Patch, who several times sought asylum in any cellar, and being a  most profound diplomat, managed on each occasion and with little  delay to negotiate a peaceful settlement and go forth in safety to  resume the practice of his nefarious profession.  I often hoped he  would be caught before reaching the post, but he seemed to know  intuitively when the time had come to take leg-bail, for his advent  at the garrison generally preceded by but a few hours the death of  some poor dupe.    Finally these peculiar customs brought about the punishment of a  noted doctress of the Rogue River tribe, a woman who was constantly  working in this professional way, and who had found a victim of such  prominence among the Rogue Rivers that his unlooked for death brought  down on her the wrath of all.  She had made him so ill, they  believed, as to bring him to death's door notwithstanding the many  ponies that had been given her to cease the incantations, and it was  the conviction of all that she had finally caused the man's death  from some ulterior and indiscernible motive.  His relatives and  friends then immediately set about requiting her with the just  penalties of a perfidious breach of contract.  Their threats induced  her instant flight toward my house for the usual protection, but the  enraged friends of the dead man gave hot chase, and overtook the  witch just inside the limits of the garrison, where, on the  parade-ground, in sight of the officers' quarters, and before any one  could interfere, they killed her.  There were sixteen men in pursuit  of the doctress, and sixteen gun-shot wounds were found in her body  when examined by the surgeon of the post.  The killing of the woman  was a flagrant and defiant outrage committed in the teeth of the  military authority, yet done so quickly that we could not prevent it.  This necessitated severe measures, both to allay the prevailing  excitement and to preclude the recurrence of such acts.  The body was  cared for, and delivered to the relatives the next day for burial,  after which Captain Russell directed me to take such steps as would  put a stop to the fanatical usages that had brought about this  murderous occurrence, for it was now seen that if timely measures were  not taken to repress them, similar tragedies would surely follow.    Knowing all the men of the Rogue River tribe, and speaking fluently  the Chinook tongue, which they all understood, I went down to their  village the following day, after having sent word to the tribe that I  wished to have a council with them.  The Indians all met me in  council, as I had desired, and I then told them that the men who had  taken part in shooting the woman would have to be delivered up for  punishment.  They were very stiff with me at the interview, and with  all that talent for circumlocution and diplomacy with which the  Indian is lifted, endeavored to evade my demands and delay any  conclusion.  But I was very positive, would hear of no compromise  whatever, and demanded that my terms be at once complied with.  No  one was with me but a sergeant of my company, named Miller, who held  my horse, and as the chances of an agreement began to grow remote, I  became anxious for our safety.  The conversation waxing hot and the  Indians gathering close in around me, I unbuttoned the flap of my  pistol holster, to be ready for any emergency.  When the altercation  became most bitter I put my hand to my hip to draw my pistol, but  discovered it was gone--stolen by one of the rascals surrounding me.  Finding myself unarmed, I modified my tone and manner to correspond  with my helpless condition, thus myself assuming the diplomatic side  in the parley, in order to gain time.  As soon as an opportunity  offered, and I could, without too much loss of self-respect, and  without damaging my reputation among the Indians, I moved out to  where the sergeant held my horse, mounted, and crossing the Yamhill  River close by, called back in Chinook from the farther bank that  \"the sixteen men who killed the woman must be delivered up, and my  six-shooter also.\" This was responded to by contemptuous laughter, so  I went back to the military post somewhat crestfallen, and made my  report of the turn affairs had taken, inwardly longing for another  chance to bring the rascally Rogue Rivers to terms.    When I had explained the situation to Captain Russell, he thought  that we could not, under any circumstances, overlook this defiant  conduct of the Indians, since, unless summarily punished, it would  lead to even more serious trouble in the future.  I heartily seconded  this proposition, and gladly embracing the opportunity it offered,  suggested that if he would give me another chance, and let me have  the effective force of the garrison, consisting of about fifty men, I  would chastise the Rogue Rivers without fail, and that the next day  was all the time I required to complete arrangements.  He gave me the  necessary authority, and I at once set to work to bring about a  better state of discipline on the reservation, and to put an end to  the practices of the medicine men (having also in view the recovery  of my six-shooter and self-respect), by marching to the village and  taking the rebellious Indians by force.    In the tribe there was an excellent woman called Tighee Mary (Tighee  in Chinook means chief), who by right of inheritance was a kind of  queen of the Rogue Rivers.  Fearing that the insubordinate conduct of  the Indians would precipitate further trouble, she came early the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4363"],[0,"Beyond Good and Evil (#14)"],[1,"dreadful also.    90. Heavy, melancholy men turn lighter, and come temporarily to their  surface, precisely by that which makes others heavy--by hatred and love.    91. So cold, so icy, that one burns one's finger at the touch of him!  Every hand that lays hold of him shrinks back!--And for that very reason  many think him red-hot.    92. Who has not, at one time or another--sacrificed himself for the sake  of his good name?    93. In affability there is no hatred of men, but precisely on that  account a great deal too much contempt of men.    94. The maturity of man--that means, to have reacquired the seriousness  that one had as a child at play.    95. To be ashamed of one's immorality is a step on the ladder at the end  of which one is ashamed also of one's morality.    96. One should part from life as Ulysses parted from Nausicaa--blessing  it rather than in love with it.    97. What? A great man? I always see merely the play-actor of his own  ideal.    98. When one trains one's conscience, it kisses one while it bites.    99. THE DISAPPOINTED ONE SPEAKS--\"I listened for the echo and I heard  only praise.\"    100. We all feign to ourselves that we are simpler than we are, we thus  relax ourselves away from our fellows.    101. A discerning one might easily regard himself at present as the  animalization of God.    102. Discovering reciprocal love should really disenchant the lover with  regard to the beloved. \"What! She is modest enough to love even you? Or  stupid enough? Or--or---\"    103. THE DANGER IN HAPPINESS.--\"Everything now turns out best for me, I  now love every fate:--who would like to be my fate?\"    104. Not their love of humanity, but the impotence of their love,  prevents the Christians of today--burning us.    105. The pia fraus is still more repugnant to the taste (the \"piety\")  of the free spirit (the \"pious man of knowledge\") than the impia fraus.  Hence the profound lack of judgment, in comparison with the Church,  characteristic of the type \"free spirit\"--as ITS non-freedom.    106. By means of music the very passions enjoy themselves.    107. A sign of strong character, when once the resolution has been  taken, to shut the ear even to the best counter-arguments. Occasionally,  therefore, a will to stupidity.    108. There is no such thing as moral phenomena, but only a moral  interpretation of phenomena.    109. The criminal is often enough not equal to his deed: he extenuates  and maligns it.    110. The advocates of a criminal are seldom artists enough to turn the  beautiful terribleness of the deed to the advantage of the doer.    111. Our vanity is most difficult to wound just when our pride has been  wounded.    112. To him who feels himself preordained to contemplation and not to  belief, all believers are too noisy and obtrusive; he guards against  them.    113. \"You want to prepossess him in your favour? Then you must be  embarrassed before him.\"    114. The immense expectation with regard to sexual love, and the coyness  in this expectation, spoils all the perspectives of women at the outset.    115. Where there is neither love nor hatred in the game, woman's play is  mediocre.    116. The great epochs of our life are at the points when we gain courage  to rebaptize our badness as the best in us.    117. The will to overcome an emotion, is ultimately only the will of  another, or of several other, emotions.    118. There is an innocence of admiration: it is possessed by him to whom  it has not yet occurred that he himself may be admired some day.    119. Our loathing of dirt may be so great as to prevent our cleaning  ourselves--\"justifying\" ourselves.    120. Sensuality often forces the growth of love too much, so that its  root remains weak, and is easily torn up.    121. It is a curious thing that God learned Greek when he wished to turn  author--and that he did not learn it better.    122. To rejoice on account of praise is in many cases merely politeness  of heart--and the very opposite of vanity of spirit.    123. Even concubinage has been corrupted--by marriage.    124. He who exults at the stake, does not triumph over pain, but because  of the fact that he does not feel pain where he expected it. A parable.    125. When we have to change an opinion about any one, we charge heavily  to his account the inconvenience he thereby causes us.    126. A nation is a detour of nature to arrive at six or seven great  men.--Yes, and then to get round them.    127. In the eyes of all true women science is hostile to the sense of  shame. They feel as if one wished to peep under their skin with it--or  worse still! under their dress and finery.    128. The more abstract the truth you wish to teach, the more must you  allure the senses to it.    129. The devil has the most extensive perspectives for God; on that  account he keeps so far away from him:--the devil, in effect, as the  oldest friend of knowledge.    130. What a person IS begins to betray itself when his talent  decreases,--when he ceases to show what he CAN do. Talent is also an  adornment; an adornment is also a concealment.    131. The sexes deceive themselves about each other: the reason is that  in reality they honour and love only themselves (or their own ideal, to  express it more agreeably). Thus man wishes woman to be peaceable: but  in fact woman is ESSENTIALLY unpeaceable, like the cat, however well she  may have assumed the peaceable demeanour.    132. One is punished best for one's virtues.    133. He who cannot find the way to HIS ideal, lives more frivolously and  shamelessly than the man without an ideal.    134. From the senses originate all trustworthiness, all good conscience,  all evidence of truth.    135. Pharisaism is not a deterioration of the good man; a considerable  part of it is rather an essential condition of being good.    136. The one seeks an accoucheur for his thoughts, the other seeks some  one whom he can assist: a good conversation thus originates.    137. In intercourse with scholars and artists one readily makes mistakes  of opposite kinds: in a remarkable scholar one not infrequently finds  a mediocre man; and often, even in a mediocre artist, one finds a very  remarkable man.    138. We do the same when awake as when dreaming: we only invent and  imagine him with whom we have intercourse--and forget it immediately.    139. In revenge and in love woman is more barbarous than man.    140. ADVICE AS A RIDDLE.--\"If the band is not to break, bite it  first--secure to make!\"    141. The belly is the reason why man does not so readily take himself  for a God.    142. The chastest utterance I ever heard: \"Dans le veritable amour c'est  l'ame qui enveloppe le corps.\"    143. Our vanity would like what we do best to pass precisely for what is  most difficult to us.--Concerning the origin of many systems of morals.    144. When a woman has scholarly inclinations there is generally  something wrong with her sexual nature. Barrenness itself conduces to a  certain virility of taste; man, indeed, if I may say so, is \"the barren  animal.\"    145. Comparing man and woman generally, one may say that woman would  not have the genius for adornment, if she had not the instinct for the  SECONDARY role.    146. He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby  become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will  also gaze into thee.    147. From old Florentine novels--moreover, from life: Buona femmina e  mala femmina vuol bastone.--Sacchetti, Nov. 86.    148. To seduce their neighbour to a favourable opinion, and afterwards  to believe implicitly in this opinion of their neighbour--who can do  this conjuring trick so well as women?    149. That which an age considers evil is usually an unseasonable echo of  what was formerly considered good--the atavism of an old ideal.    150. Around the hero everything becomes a tragedy; around the  demigod everything becomes a satyr-play; and around God everything  becomes--what? perhaps a \"world\"?    151. It is not enough to possess a talent: one must also have your  permission to possess it;--eh, my friends?    152. \"Where there is the tree of knowledge, there is always Paradise\":  so say the most ancient and the most modern serpents.    153. What is done out of love always takes place beyond good and evil.    154. Objection, evasion, joyous distrust, and love of irony are signs of  health; everything absolute belongs to pathology.    155. The sense of the tragic increases and declines with sensuousness.    156. Insanity in individuals is something rare--but in groups, parties,  nations, and epochs it is the rule.    157. The thought of suicide is a great consolation: by means of it one  gets successfully through many a bad night.    158. Not only our reason, but also our conscience, truckles to our  strongest impulse--the tyrant in us.    159. One MUST repay good and ill; but why just to the person who did us  good or ill?    160. One no longer loves one's knowledge sufficiently after one has  communicated it.    161. Poets act shamelessly towards their experiences: they exploit them.    162. \"Our fellow-creature is not our neighbour, but our neighbour's  neighbour\":--so thinks every nation.    163. Love brings to light the noble and hidden qualities of a lover--his  rare and exceptional traits: it is thus liable to be deceptive as to his  normal character.    164. Jesus said to his Jews: \"The law was for servants;--love God as I  love him, as his Son! What have we Sons of God to do with morals!\"    165. IN SIGHT OF EVERY PARTY.--A shepherd has always need of a  bell-wether--or he has himself to be a wether occasionally.    166. One may indeed lie with the mouth; but with the accompanying  grimace one nevertheless tells the truth.    167. To vigorous men intimacy is a matter of shame--and something  precious.    168. Christianity gave Eros poison to drink; he did not die of it,  certainly, but degenerated to Vice.    169."]]]
