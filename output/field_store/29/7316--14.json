It is growing in my mind that thou deemest the gift of me  unworthy!  Thou, an alien, an outcast; one endowed with the little wisdom  of the World without the Wood!  And here I stand before thee, all  glorious in my nakedness, and so fulfilled of wisdom, that I can make  this wilderness to any whom I love more full of joy than the kingdoms and  cities of the world--and thou!--Ah, but it is the Enemy that hath done  this, and made the guileless guileful!  Yet will I have the upper hand at  least, though thou suffer for it, and I suffer for thee.\"    Walter stood before her with hanging head, and he put forth his hands as  if praying off her anger, and pondered what answer he should make; for  now he feared for himself and the Maid; so at last he looked up to her,  and said boldly: \"Nay, Lady, I know what thy words mean, whereas I  remember thy first welcome of me.  I wot, forsooth, that thou wouldst  call me base-born, and of no account, and unworthy to touch the hem of  thy raiment; and that I have been over-bold, and guilty towards thee; and  doubtless this is sooth, and I have deserved thine anger: but I will not  ask thee to pardon me, for I have done but what I must needs.\"    She looked on him calmly now, and without any wrath, but rather as if she  would read what was written in his inmost heart.  Then her face changed  into joyousness again, and she smote her palms together, and cried out:  \"This is but foolish talk; for yesterday did I see thy valiancy, and to-  day I have seen thy goodliness; and I say, that though thou mightest not  be good enough for a fool woman of the earthly baronage, yet art thou  good enough for me, the wise and the mighty, and the lovely.  And whereas  thou sayest that I gave thee but disdain when first thou camest to us,  grudge not against me therefor, because it was done but to prove thee;  and now thou art proven.\"    Then again he knelt down before her, and embraced her knees, and again  she raised him up, and let her arm hang down over his shoulder, and her  cheek brush his cheek; and she kissed his mouth and said: \"Hereby is all  forgiven, both thine offence and mine; and now cometh joy and merry  days.\"    Therewith her smiling face grew grave, and she stood before him looking  stately and gracious and kind at once, and she took his hand and said:  \"Thou mightest deem my chamber in the Golden House of the Wood  over-queenly, since thou art no masterful man.  So now hast thou chosen  well the place wherein to meet me to-day, for hard by on the other side  of the stream is a bower of pleasance, which, forsooth, not every one who  cometh to this land may find; there shall I be to thee as one of the up-  country damsels of thine own land, and thou shalt not be abashed.\"    She sidled up to him as she spoke, and would he, would he not, her sweet  voice tickled his very soul with pleasure, and she looked aside on him  happy and well-content.    So they crossed the stream by the shallow below the pool wherein Walter  had bathed, and within a little they came upon a tall fence of  flake-hurdles, and a simple gate therein.  The Lady opened the same, and  they entered thereby into a close all planted as a most fair garden, with  hedges of rose and woodbine, and with linden-trees a-blossom, and long  ways of green grass betwixt borders of lilies and clove-gilliflowers, and  other sweet garland-flowers.  And a branch of the stream which they had  crossed erewhile wandered through that garden; and in the midst was a  little house built of post and pan, and thatched with yellow straw, as if  it were new done.    Then Walter looked this way and that, and wondered at first, and tried to  think in his mind what should come next, and how matters would go with  him; but his thought would not dwell steady on any other matter than the  beauty of the Lady amidst the beauty of the garden; and withal she was  now grown so sweet and kind, and even somewhat timid and shy with him,  that scarce did he know whose hand he held, or whose fragrant bosom and  sleek side went so close to him.    So they wandered here and there through the waning of the day, and when  they entered at last into the cool dusk house, then they loved and played  together, as if they were a pair of lovers guileless, with no fear for  the morrow, and no seeds of enmity and death sown betwixt them.          CHAPTER XVIII: THE MAID GIVES WALTER TRYST      Now, on the morrow, when Walter was awake, he found there was no one  lying beside him, and the day was no longer very young; so he arose, and  went through the garden from end to end, and all about, and there was  none there; and albeit that he dreaded to meet the Lady there, yet was he  sad at heart and fearful of what might betide.  Howsoever, he found the  gate whereby they had entered yesterday, and he went out into the little  dale; but when he had gone a step or two he turned about, and could see  neither garden nor fence, nor any sign of what he had seen thereof but  lately.  He knit his brow and stood still to think of it, and his heart  grew the heavier thereby; but presently he went his ways and crossed the  stream, but had scarce come up on to the grass on the further side, ere  he saw a woman coming to meet him, and at first, full as he was of the  tide of yesterday and the wondrous garden, deemed that it would be the  Lady; but the woman stayed her feet, and, stooping, laid a hand on her  right ankle, and he saw that it was the Maid.  He drew anigh to her, and  saw that she was nought so sad of countenance as the last time she had  met him, but flushed of cheek and bright-eyed.    As he came up to her she made a step or two to meet him, holding out her  two hands, and then refrained her, and said smiling: \"Ah, friend, belike  this shall be the last time that I shall say to thee, touch me not, nay,  not so much as my hand, or if it were but the hem of my raiment.\"    The joy grew up in his heart, and he gazed on her fondly, and said: \"Why,  what hath befallen of late?\"    \"O friend,\" she began, \"this hath befallen.\"    But as he looked on her, the smile died from her face, and she became  deadly pale to the very lips; she looked askance to her left side,  whereas ran the stream; and Walter followed her eyes, and deemed for one  instant that he saw the misshapen yellow visage of the dwarf peering  round from a grey rock, but the next there was nothing.  Then the Maid,  though she were as pale as death, went on in a clear, steady, hard voice,  wherein was no joy or kindness, keeping her face to Walter and her back  to the stream: \"This hath befallen, friend, that there is no longer any  need to refrain thy love nor mine; therefore I say to thee, come to my  chamber (and it is the red chamber over against thine, though thou  knewest it not) an hour before this next midnight, and then thy sorrow  and mine shall be at an end: and now I must needs depart.  Follow me not,  but remember!\"    And therewith she turned about and fled like the wind down the stream.    But Walter stood wondering, and knew not what to make of it, whether it  were for good or ill: for he knew now that she had paled and been seized  with terror because of the upheaving of the ugly head; and yet she had  seemed to speak out the very thing she had to say.  Howsoever it were, he  spake aloud to himself: Whatever comes, I will keep tryst with her.    Then he drew his sword, and turned this way and that, looking all about  if he might see any sign of the Evil Thing; but nought might his eyes  behold, save the grass, and the stream, and the bushes of the dale.  So  then, still holding his naked sword in his hand, he clomb the bent out of  the dale; for that was the only way he knew to the Golden House; and when  he came to the top, and the summer breeze blew in his face, and he looked  down a fair green slope beset with goodly oaks and chestnuts, he was  refreshed with the life of the earth, and he felt the good sword in his  fist, and knew that there was might and longing in him, and the world  seemed open unto him.    So he smiled, if it were somewhat grimly, and sheathed his sword and went  on toward the house.          CHAPTER XIX: WALTER GOES TO FETCH HOME THE LION'S HIDE      He entered the cool dusk through the porch, and, looking down the  pillared hall, saw beyond the fountain a gleam of gold, and when he came  past the said fountain he looked up to the high-seat, and lo! the Lady  sitting there clad in her queenly raiment.  She called to him, and he  came; and she hailed him, and spake graciously and calmly, yet as if she  knew nought of him save as the leal servant of her, a high Lady.  \"Squire,\" she said, \"we have deemed it meet to have the hide of the  servant of the Enemy, the lion to wit, whom thou slewest yesterday, for a  carpet to our feet; wherefore go now, take thy wood-knife, and flay the  beast, and bring me home his skin.  This shall be all thy service for  this day, so mayst thou do it at thine own leisure, and not weary  thyself.  May good go with thee.\"    He bent the knee before her, and she smiled on him graciously, but  reached out no hand for him to kiss, and heeded him but little.  Wherefore, in spite of himself, and though he knew somewhat of her guile,  he could not help marvelling that this should be she who had lain in his  arms night-long but of late.    Howso that might be, he took his way toward the thicket where he had  slain the lion, and came thither by then it was afternoon, at the hottest  of the day.  So he entered therein, and came to the very place whereas  the Lady had lain, when she fell down before the terror of the lion; and  there was the mark of her body on the grass where she had lain that  while, like as it were the form of a hare.  But when Walter went on to  where he had slain that great beast, lo! he was gone, and there was no  sign of him; but there were Walter's own footprints,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30550"],[0,"Finn The Wolfhound (#14)"],[1," led the  grand old hound who had sired Finn--Champion Dermot.    In the centre of the ring, accompanied by a busy steward with a  sheaf of notes in his hand, stood the Judge of Irish Wolfhounds; a  man grown grey, white-haired indeed, in the study of dog-folk, and  one of whom it might be said that, by his own single-hearted  efforts, he had saved the breed of Irish Wolfhounds from becoming  extinct in the middle of last century, and accomplished a great  deal of the spade work which has brought the modern breed to its  present flourishing state. No man living could claim to know more  of Irish Wolfhounds than this white-haired Judge, who stood in the  centre of a ring formed by all the greatest aristocrats of the  historic breed.    \"Move them round, please,\" he said quietly. \"Keep them moving as  freely as possible.\"    Finn was the only hound in that ring under two and a half years of  age, and Finn was just fifteen months old, a child among the  acknowledged leaders and chieftains of his race. One noticed it in  the comparative angularity and leggyness of his build. He carried  less flesh than the others, was far less set; in a word, they had  \"furnished,\" and Finn had not. The Mistress of the Kennels, from  her place beside the ring, noticed these things, and sighed for the  soaring ambition which had led to the entering of this tyro in Open  class.    \"Finn, boy!\" said she, in an impressive, long-drawn whisper, as  Finn passed her place. The youngster's ears lifted, and his fine  neck curved superbly as he looked round at the Mistress. And just  then the Master bent over him, whispering close beside his ear  certain nonsense words which were associated in Finn's mind with  certain events, like rabbit-hunting and racing on the Downs.    \"Chu, chu, chu--u--u--, Finn!\" whispered the Master. And that was a  nonsense word connected with two things only: the unexpected rising  of a rabbit ahead, and the new game in which Finn had been led  round a ring with Tara and Kathleen in the orchard at home. And, to  be sure, there was the Mistress of the Kennels looking on all the  time, and Finn and the Master walking round, and other dogs, and----    And it was thus that Finn passed a Judge at a dog show for the  first time. It was thus that he realized that it was a show; that  he, Finn, was being judged, compared with others of his kind. From  that moment Finn showed the best that was in him to show, with an  air as kingly as that of any of his warrior ancestors in the  ancient days when they were the friends and defenders of kings, the  companions in sport of great chieftains. When next Finn approached  the Judge in the march round, the Master touched his flank, and he  rose up to his full towering height, his fore-paws higher than a  man's head, and the Master pretended to rebuke him with: \"Down,  Finn! Down, you rascal!\" But Finn knew well, by his tone, that all  was well, and his own appearance most imposing. The Judge, in the  centre of the ring, chewed the end of his pencil reflectively, and  now and again he said, \"That will do, thank you!\" to some  exhibitor, and that exhibitor withdrew from the ring with his  hound, wearing an elaborately assumed air of indifference or  relief, and feeling much real chagrin. Occasionally the Judge would  merely wave his hand for the same purpose, with a nod to some  particular exhibitor.    During about the fifth or sixth march round the Judge waved his  hand and nodded to the Master with a murmured remark. The Master's  face fell, and, as he drew abreast of the opening in the side of  the ring, he moved out slowly with Finn. To him then came a  steward, fussily official. He was not to withdraw from the ring, it  appeared, but only to take up his stand in one corner of it with  Champion Dermot Asthore, Champion Munster, and a magnificent hound  named Cormac. The Judge was making notes on slips of paper now, and  in another minute or so the ring was empty, save for the three  hounds mentioned and Finn.    And now there came the most searching sort of examination of these  four Wolfhounds, who were drawn up in a row before the Judge.  Teeth, eyes, claws, all were in turn closely scrutinized by the man  who had weighed and studied such matters for the half of a century.  Muscles and joints were carefully felt, and all in a manner which  no self-respecting hound could take exception to; with the assured,  gentle, knowledgeable touch which soothes and inspires confidence  in all animal folk. Then the four hounds must walk round once more  in single file. Then they must run to and fro, singly. And, lastly,  they must stand together to have the measuring standard applied to  their shoulders. Young Finn was the last to come under the  standard; and the Judge measured him four times over before he  would admit himself correct in pronouncing Finn full 35 1/4 inches  at the shoulder: \"And I may say, sir, the biggest hound I ever  measured. Fifteen and a half months, you say? Tcha! Remarkable;  _re_-markable, sir.\" And this Judge knew more about Irish  Wolfhounds than any other man living.    Cormac's master was told that he could stand aside, and a murmur  went round the ring of spectators to the effect that Cormac was the  winner. Then Champion Munster was told to stand aside, and the  crowd placed him second. And then the Judge spent five reflective  minutes in pondering over Champion Dermot Asthore, the most famous  Irish Wolfhound of his day, and young Finn, his son, and the son of  beautiful Tara. The crowd wondered which of these two was to have  third prize, the celebrated old champion or the tyro.    At last the Judge drew back, saying: \"That will do, thank you!\"    The crowd surged round the notice-board.  Excitement ran high now,  for this was the most important Wolfhound class of the whole show,  and the stewards were approaching the board to pin up the winning  numbers. The Master glanced across at the Mistress of the Kennels,  and stooped then to fondle Finn's ears, and murmur nonsense words  to him. Then he, too, pressed forward to the notice-board, and read  the awards, thus:--      1st...No. 247.    2nd...No. 248.    3rd...No. 261.    V.H.C...No. 256.    H.C...No. 259.    Not daring to be quite certain, the Master drew out the little  medal from beside Finn's collar, and read again on it Finn's  number: 247.  By this single judgment, then, Finn was declared  winner of the Open class for Irish Wolfhound dogs, and that meant  that, unless a bitch could be found to beat him, Finn also won the  Challenge Shield for best Irish Wolfhound in the Show. Champion  Dermot Asthore, his sire, came second, Champion Munster third,  Cormac very highly commended, and a dog called Patrick highly  commended.    A moment later the Mistress of the Kennels was in possession of the  great news, and her arms were about Finn's neck, while Finn nosed  the momentarily neglected Kathleen's muzzle.    \"You great, beautiful Finn, do you know you are first? Do you know  you've beaten all the champions?\" she said. And Finn nuzzled her  shoulder and wondered why she was in any doubt about his  recognition of a thing so obvious. But it was a very great triumph  all the same; the greatest triumph that had ever fallen to a  breeder of Irish Wolfhounds, as some of those who hastened to  congratulate the Master now were careful to point out.    \"For a fifteen months' novice, you know, against two champions, and  a hound like Cormac--wonderful!\" they said. But all were agreed  that Finn justified the award. \"He's the tallest hound in the  breed, now,\" said the Judge, as he passed that way, and lingered to  pass his hand over Finn's shoulder; \"and he will be the biggest and  finest if he lives; distinctly the finest Irish Wolfhound I have  ever handled, and--I've handled most of them.\" Higher tribute from  such a Judge no dog could earn. The Master flushed with pleasure  and pride as he heard it, and turned to receive the congratulations  of the exhibitors of Champions Dermot Asthore, and Munster.    In the Limit and Novice classes Finn was awarded first place as a  matter of course. There was nothing there to beat him. And then  came the judging of the bitch classes, in which Kathleen did  extraordinarily well for so young a hound, and in such \"good  company,\" as the saying goes. She won third prize in the Open  class, second in the Limit, and first in the Novice. And then four  other young hounds filed into the ring with Finn and Kathleen to be  judged in the junior class. The other four young hounds were of a  very good sort, but they had not the development, the bone, muscle,  and stature of Finn and Kathleen, and there was not much hesitation  in the decision which placed Finn first, Kathleen second, and a  youngster called Connemara third.    And then Finn had to be judged beside the winner in the Open class  for bitches, to decide who should be given the Challenge Shield for  the best Irish Wolfhound in the Show. And this was a task which  tried the white-haired Judge's patience for a long time. The female  was Champion Lady Iseult of Leinster, and one of the most beautiful  hounds of her sex ever seen. She was fully matured, and her  reputation was world-wide. Judged on \"points,\" as breeders say, she  was very near to perfection. Technically, it was difficult to find  fault in her, unless that she was a shade too straight in her  hocks, a fault that often goes with great stature in a hound.  Finn's hocks were curved like an Arab stallion's, springy as a  cat's. The Judge tested the two hounds side by side, again and  again, and in every way he could think of, but without coming to a  decision between them. At last, after passing his hand down the  hocks of the Lady Iseult, he asked that they might both be run,  quickly as possible, while led. That seemed to guide him a good  deal. But it was clear that the conscientious old Judge and breeder  was not yet fully satisfied. Finally, he had the"]]]
