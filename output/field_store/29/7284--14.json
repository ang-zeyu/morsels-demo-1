[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28572"],[0,"Letters on an Elk Hunt (#14)"],[1,"  Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, who was so cranky and snappy that we left her by  the fire. It seemed hours after when I awoke. She was still sitting by  the fire; she was absently marking in the ashes with a stick. I  happened to be the first one up next morning and as I stirred up the  fire I saw \"Baby\" written in the ashes. We had breakfasted and the men  had gone their ways when Mrs. O'Shaughnessy said to me,--    \"It is a blessed old soul Mrs. Mortimer is. Do you mind any good  lesson that she taught us in the cabin beyont?\" I did not remember.  \"She said, 'The pangs of motherhood make us mothers not only of our  own, but of every child that needs mothering,--especially if our own  little children need us no longer. Fill their little places with ones  who do need us.' Them's her very words, and it's sweet truth it is.  Both my Katie and Sheridan have been grown and gone these many years  and my heart has ached for childher, and there's none but Cora Belle.  I am goin' to get them childher this day. What do you think about it?\"    I thought so well of it that in about two minutes we were harnessing  the horses and were off to lay the plan before Hettie in  record-breaking time.    Poor Hettie: she wept quietly while the advantages of the scheme were  being pointed out. She said, \"I love the children, dearly, but I am  not sure I can always feed and clothe them; that has worried me a lot.  I am almost sure Bolton is dead. I'll miss the little things, but I am  glad to know they are well provided for. You can take them.\"    \"Now,\" said Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, \"you go on an' marry your man if he is  a decent sort. Do it right away before something else happens. It is  an illigant wedding present I'll be sendin' you. You must come to see  the childher often. What's the b'y's name?\"    \"We never did name him; you see we had kind of run out of boys' names.  We just called him Buddy.\"    \"I can find a name for him,\" said Mrs. O'Shaughnessy. \"Is there a  Joseph in the family?\" Hettie said no. \"Well, then, he is named  Joseph Bolton O'Shaughnessy, and I'll have them both baptized as soon  as we get to Green River.\"    So in the morning we start with two new members. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy is  very happy. I am so glad myself that I can hardly express myself. We  are _all_ happy except Mr. Murry; he has at last given up hopes, and  gone. Mr. Haynes growls a little about having to travel along with a  rolling nursery, but he is just bluffing. I am longing to see Junior.  We have not heard one word since we left them, and I am so homesick  for mother and my boy. And _you_, best of friends, when shall I see  your beloved face? To-morrow night we shall camp at Ten Trees and we  shall be one day nearer home.                                  With much love,                                     ELINORE RUPERT STEWART.          XII    A STAMPEDE                                    IN CAMP ON THE DESERT,                                     October 19.    MY DEAR, DEAR FRIEND,--    It is with a chastened, humble heart that I begin this letter; I have  stood face to face with tragedy and romance, and to me one is as  touching as the other, but you will know better when I tell you what I  mean. We _all_ bustled about to get started from Newfork. Now that we  had started, all were homesick. Just ahead of us was a drove of two  thousand steers being driven to the railroad to be shipped. I advise  you to keep ahead of such drives when you take such a trip, because  the trampling of so many feet makes a road almost impassable. What had  been snow in the mountains had been rain on the desert, and we found  the going decidedly bad. A rise of a hill would give us, now and  then, a glimpse of a slow-moving, dark-colored mass of heaving forms,  and the desert breezes brought to our ears the mournful lowing of the  poor creatures. Sometimes, too, we could hear a snatch of the cowboys'  songs. It was all very beautiful and I would have enjoyed it hugely  except that my desire to be home far outran the wagon and I felt like  a prisoner with clogs.    We nooned at the cabin of Timothy Hobbs, but no one was at home; he at  last had gone \"back East\" for Jennie. About mid-afternoon the boss of  the cow outfit came up on a splendid horse. He was a pleasant fellow  and he made a handsome picture, with his big hat, his great chaps and  his jangling spurs, as he rode along beside our wagons, talking.    He told us that a crazy duffer had gone about over the desert for  years digging wells, but at last he struck water. A few miles ahead  was a well flowing like an artesian well. There would be plenty of  water for every one, even the cattle. Next morning we could start  ahead of the herds and so the roads would be a little better.    It was quite early when we made camp in the same long draw where we  saw Olaf. There was a great change. Where had been dry, burning sand  was now a clear little stream that formed shallow pools where the sand  had blown away, so that harder soil could form a bottom less greedy  than the sand. Off to our left the uneasy herd was being held in a  wide, flat valley. They were grazing on the dry, sparse herbage of the  desert. Quite near the well the mess-wagon had stopped and the cook  was already preparing supper. Beyond, a few yards away, a freighter's  long outfit was stopped in the road.    Did you ever see the kind of freight outfit that is used to bring the  great loads across the desert? Then I'll tell you about the one we  camped near. Freight wagons are not made precisely like others; they  are very much larger and stronger. Several of these are coupled  together; then as many teams as is necessary are hitched on--making a  long, unbroken string of wagons. The horses are arranged in the same  manner as the wagons. Great chains are used to pull the wagons, and  when a camp is made the whole affair is stopped in the middle of the  road and the harness is dropped right where the horse that bore it  stood. Many freighters have what they call a coaster hitched to the  last wagon. The coaster is almost like other wagons, but it is a home  on wheels; it is built and furnished as sheep wagons are. This  freighter had one, and as we drove past I was surprised to see the  form of a woman and a small boy. We camped quite near them.    For an hour we were very busy preparing supper and arranging for the  night. As we sat at supper I thought I had never known so quiet and  peaceful an hour. The sun hung like a great, red ball in the hazy  west. Purple shadows were already gathering. A gentle wind rippled  past across the dun sands and through the gray-green sage.    The chain parts of the hobbles and halters made a clinking sound as  the horses fed about. Presently we heard a rumbling just like distant  thunder. The cowboys sprang into their saddles; we heard a shot, and  then we knew the terrible truth,--the steers had stampeded. For me,  the next few minutes were an eternity of frightful confusion. Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy and I found ourselves with the children upon our largest  wagon; that was absolutely all the protection to be had. It would have  gone down like a house of cards if that heaving sea of destruction had  turned our way. I was scared witless. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy knelt among  the children praying with white lips. I stood up watching the terrible  scene. The men hastily set the horses free. There was no time to mount  them and ride to safety with so many little children, and as there was  nothing to tie them to but the wagons; we _had_ to let them go so as  to have the wagons left for shelter. _This_ is why cowboys are such  well-loved figures of romance and in mentioning them romance is fact.    \"Greater love hath _no_ man than this: that he lay down his life  for his brother.\" They knew nothing about us only that we were  defenseless. They rode boldly on their stanch little horses flanking  the frenzied steers, shooting a leader here and there as they got a  chance. If an animal stumbled it went down to its death, for hundreds  of pounding hoofs would trample it to pulp. So it would have been with  the boys if their horses had stepped into a badger hole or anything of  the kind had happened. So the tide was turned, or the steers kept of  themselves, I don't know which, on up the valley instead of coming up  our draw. The danger was past.    Presently the cowboys came straggling back. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy ran to  meet them. So when two on one horse came with a third riding close  beside, helping to hold an injured man on, we knew some one was hurt.  Mrs. O'Shaughnessy was, as usual, ready and able to help.    But the freighter's daughter was as quick and had a mattress ready  beside the coaster by the time the cowboys came up with the wounded  man. Gently the men helped their comrade to the mattress and gently  Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and the girl began their work. I quieted the  children and put them to bed. The men were busy rounding up the  horses. The cowboys kept talking together in low tones and coming and  going in twos and threes. They acted so queerly that I wondered if  some one else was not hurt. I asked the boss if any more of his men  were hurt. He said no, none of _his_ men were. I knew none of our men  or the freighter were harmed, so I dismissed fear and went to Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy.    \"Poor boy,\" she said, \"he has a broken thigh and he's hurt inside. His  belly is knocked into a cocked-hat. We will pull him through. A man  has already gone back to Newfork to get an automobile. They will take  him to Rock Springs to the hospital in the morning.\"    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and the girl were doing all that could be done;  they sent me back to care for the children. To keep warm I crawled  under the blankets, but not to sleep. It didn't seem to me that I  could _ever_ sleep again. I could hear the men talking in subdued  tones. The boss was dispatching men to different places. Presently I  saw some men take a lantern and move off"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28613"],[0,"Pioneers of Science (#14)"],[1,"      |practically            |       |            |    (d)   |         |         | constant.  ----------|-------|------------|----------|---------|---------|-----------  No. 1.    |  2437 |   42.47    |   6.049  |  1803.7 |  221.44 |  8.149  No. 2.    |  2188 |   85.23    |   9.623  |  7264.1 |  891.11 |  8.152  No. 3.    |  3575 |  177.72    |  15.350  | 29488.  | 3916.8  |  8.153  No. 4.    |  3059 |  400.53    |  26.998  |160426.  |19679.   |  8.152  --------------------------------------------------------------------------    The diameter of Jupiter is 85,823 miles.      _Falling Bodies._      Since all bodies fall at the same rate, except for the disturbing effect  of the resistance of the air, a statement of their rates of fall is of  interest. In one second a freely falling body near the earth is found to  drop 16 feet. In two seconds it drops 64 feet altogether, viz. 16 feet  in the first, and 48 feet in the next second; because at the beginning  of every second after the first it has the accumulated velocity of  preceding seconds. The height fallen by a dropped body is not  proportional to the time simply, but to what is rather absurdly called  the square of the time, _i.e._ the time multiplied by itself.    For instance, in 3 seconds it drops 9 x 16 = 144 feet; in 4 seconds 16 x  16, or 256 feet, and so on. The distances travelled in 1, 2, 3, 4, &c.,  seconds by a body dropped from rest and not appreciably resisted by the  air, are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, &c., respectively, each multiplied by the  constant 16 feet.    Another way of stating the law is to say that the heights travelled in  successive seconds proceed in the proportion 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, &c.; again  multiplied by 16 feet in each case.    [Illustration: FIG. 35.--Curve described by a projectile, showing how it  drops from the line of fire, _O D_, in successive seconds, the same  distances _AP_, _BQ_, _CR_, &c., as are stated above for a dropped  body.]    All this was experimentally established by Galileo.    A body takes half a second to drop 4 feet; and a quarter of a second to  drop 1 foot. The easiest way of estimating a quarter of a second with  some accuracy is to drop a bullet one foot.    A bullet thrown or shot in any direction falls just as much as if merely  dropped; but instead of falling from the starting-point it drops  vertically from the line of fire. (See fig. 35).    The rate of fall depends on the intensity of gravity; if it could be  doubled, a body would fall twice as far in the same time; but to make it  fall a given distance in half the time the intensity of gravity would  have to be quadrupled. At a place where the intensity of gravity is  1/3600 of what it is here, a body would fall as far in a minute as it  now falls in a second. Such a place occurs at about the distance of the  moon (_cf._ page 177).    The fact that the height fallen through is proportional to the square  of the time proves that the attraction of the earth or the intensity of  gravity is sensibly constant throughout ordinary small ranges. Over  great distances of fall, gravity cannot be considered constant; so for  things falling through great spaces the Galilean law of the square of  the time does not hold.    The fact that things near the earth fall 16 feet in the first second  proves that the intensity of ordinary terrestrial gravity is 32 British  units of force per pound of matter.    The fact that all bodies fall at the same rate (when the resistance of  the air is eliminated), proves that weight is proportional to mass; or  more explicitly, that the gravitative attraction of the earth on matter  near its surface depends on the amount of that matter, as estimated by  its inertia, and on nothing else.          LECTURE IV    GALILEO AND THE INVENTION OF THE TELESCOPE      Contemporary with the life of Kepler, but overlapping it at both ends,  comes the great and eventful life of Galileo Galilei,[5] a man whose  influence on the development of human thought has been greater than that  of any man whom we have yet considered, and upon whom, therefore, it is  necessary for us, in order to carry out the plan of these lectures, to  bestow much time. A man of great and wide culture, a so-called universal  genius, it is as an experimental philosopher that he takes the first  rank. In this capacity he must be placed alongside of Archimedes, and it  is pretty certain that between the two there was no man of magnitude  equal to either in experimental philosophy. It is perhaps too bold a  speculation, but I venture to doubt whether in succeeding generations we  find his equal in the domain of purely experimental science until we  come to Faraday. Faraday was no doubt his superior, but I know of no  other of whom the like can unhesitatingly be said. In mathematical and  deductive science, of course, it is quite otherwise. Kepler, for  instance, and many men before and since, have far excelled Galileo in  mathematical skill and power, though at the same time his achievements  in this department are by no means to be despised.    Born at Pisa three centuries ago, on the very day that Michael Angelo  lay dying in Rome, he inherited from his father a noble name, cultivated  tastes, a keen love of truth, and an impoverished patrimony. Vincenzo de  Galilei, a descendant of the important Bonajuti family, was himself a  mathematician and a musician, and in a book of his still extant he  declares himself in favour of free and open inquiry into scientific  matters, unrestrained by the weight of authority and tradition.    In all probability the son imbibed these precepts: certainly he acted on  them.    Vincenzo, having himself experienced the unremunerative character of  scientific work, had a horror of his son's taking to it, especially as  in his boyhood he was always constructing ingenious mechanical toys, and  exhibiting other marks of precocity. So the son was destined for  business--to be, in fact, a cloth-dealer. But he was to receive a good  education first, and was sent to an excellent convent school.    Here he made rapid progress, and soon excelled in all branches of  classics and literature. He delighted in poetry, and in later years  wrote several essays on Dante, Tasso, and Ariosto, besides composing  some tolerable poems himself. He played skilfully on several musical  instruments, especially on the lute, of which indeed he became a master,  and on which he solaced himself when quite an old man. Besides this he  seems to have had some skill as an artist, which was useful afterwards  in illustrating his discoveries, and to have had a fine sensibility as  an art critic, for we find several eminent painters of that day  acknowledging the value of the opinion of the young Galileo.    Perceiving all this display of ability, the father wisely came to the  conclusion that the selling of woollen stuffs would hardly satisfy his  aspirations for long, and that it was worth a sacrifice to send him to  the University. So to the University of his native town he went, with  the avowed object of studying medicine, that career seeming the most  likely to be profitable. Old Vincenzo's horror of mathematics or science  as a means of obtaining a livelihood is justified by the fact that while  the University Professor of Medicine received 2,000 scudi a year, the  Professor of Mathematics had only 60, that is L13 a year, or 7-1/2_d._ a  day.    So the son had been kept properly ignorant of such poverty-stricken  subjects, and to study medicine he went.    But his natural bent showed itself even here. For praying one day in the  Cathedral, like a good Catholic as he was all his life, his attention  was arrested by the great lamp which, after lighting it, the verger had  left swinging to and fro. Galileo proceeded to time its swings by the  only watch he possessed--viz., his own pulse. He noticed that the time  of swing remained as near as he could tell the same, notwithstanding the  fact that the swings were getting smaller and smaller.    By subsequent experiment he verified the law, and the isochronism of the  pendulum was discovered. An immensely important practical discovery  this, for upon it all modern clocks are based; and Huyghens soon applied  it to the astronomical clock, which up to that time had been a crude and  quite untrustworthy instrument.    The best clock which Tycho Brahe could get for his observatory was  inferior to one that may now be purchased for a few shillings; and this  change is owing to the discovery of the pendulum by Galileo. Not that he  applied it to clocks; he was not thinking of astronomy, he was thinking  of medicine, and wanted to count people's pulses. The pendulum served;  and \"pulsilogies,\" as they were called, were thus introduced to and used  by medical practitioners.    The Tuscan Court came to Pisa for the summer months, for it was then a  seaside place, and among the suite was Ostillio Ricci, a distinguished  mathematician and old friend of the Galileo family. The youth visited  him, and one day, it is said, heard a lesson in Euclid being given by  Ricci to the pages while he stood outside the door entranced. Anyhow he  implored Ricci to help him into some knowledge of mathematics, and the  old man willingly consented. So he mastered Euclid and passed on to  Archimedes, for whom he acquired a great veneration.    His father soon heard of this obnoxious proclivity, and did what he  could to divert him back to medicine again. But it was no use.  Underneath his Galen and Hippocrates were secreted copies of Euclid and  Archimedes, to be studied at every available opportunity. Old Vincenzo  perceived the bent of genius to be too strong for him, and at last gave  way.    [Illustration: FIG. 36.--Two forms of pulsilogy.
