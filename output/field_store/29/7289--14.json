But a more  definite rule, as I have elsewhere shown (14/26. 'Descent of Man' 2nd edition  page 32.) generally holds good, namely, that variations which first appear in  either sex at a late period of life, when the reproductive functions are  active, tend to be developed in that sex alone; whilst variations which first  appear early in life in either sex are commonly transmitted to both sexes. I  am, however, far from supposing that this is the sole determining cause.    A few details from the many cases collected by Mr. Sedgwick (14/27. On Sexual  Limitation in Hereditary Diseases 'Brit. and For. Med.-Chirurg. Review' April  1861 page 477; July page 198; April 1863 page 445; and July page 159. Also in  1867 'On the influence of Age in Hereditary Disease.'), may be here given.  Colour-blindness, from some unknown cause, shows itself much oftener in males  than in females; in upwards of two hundred cases collected by Mr. Sedgwick,  nine-tenths related to men; but it is eminently liable to be transmitted  through women. In the case given by Dr. Earle, members of eight related  families were affected during five generations: these families consisted of  sixty-one individuals, namely, of thirty-two males, of whom nine-sixteenths  were incapable of distinguishing colour, and of twenty-nine females, of whom  only one-fifteenth were thus affected. Although colour-blindness thus  generally clings to the male sex, nevertheless, in one instance in which it  first appeared in a female, it was transmitted during five generations to  thirteen individuals, all of whom were females. The haemorrhagic diathesis,  often accompanied by rheumatism, has been known to affect the males alone  during five generations, being transmitted, however, through the females. It  is said that deficient phalanges in the fingers have been inherited by the  females alone during ten generations. In another case, a man thus deficient in  both hands and feet, transmitted the peculiarity to his two sons and one  daughter; but in the third generation,--out of nineteen grandchildren, twelve  sons had the family defect, whilst the seven daughters were free. In ordinary  cases of sexual limitation, the sons or daughters inherit the peculiarity,  whatever it may be, from their father or mother, and transmit it to their  children of the same sex; but generally with the haemorrhagic diathesis, and  often with colour-blindness, and in some other cases, the sons never inherit  the peculiarity directly from their fathers, but the daughters alone transmit  the latent tendency, so that the sons of the daughters alone exhibit it. Thus  the father, grandson, and great-great-grandson will exhibit a peculiarity,--  the grandmother, daughter, and great-grand-daughter having transmitted it in a  latent state. Hence we have, as Mr. Sedgwick remarks, a double kind of atavism  or reversion; each grandson apparently receiving and developing the  peculiarity from his grandfather, and each daughter apparently receiving the  latent tendency from her grandmother.    From the various facts recorded by Dr. Prosper Lucas, Mr. Sedgwick, and  others, there can be no doubt that peculiarities first appearing in either  sex, though not in any way necessarily or invariably connected with that sex,  strongly tend to be inherited by the offspring of the same sex, but are often  transmitted in a latent state through the opposite sex.    Turning now to domesticated animals, we find that certain characters not  proper to the parent species are often confined to, and inherited by, one sex  alone; but we do not know the history of the first appearance of such  characters. In the chapter on Sheep, we have seen that the males of certain  races differ greatly from the females in the shape of their horns, these being  absent in the ewes of some breeds; they differ also in the development of fat  in the tail and in the outline of the forehead. These differences, judging  from the character of the allied wild species, cannot be accounted for by  supposing that they have been derived from distinct parent forms. There is,  also, a great difference between the horns of the two sexes in one Indian  breed of goats. The bull zebu is said to have a larger hump than the cow. In  the Scotch deer-hound the two sexes differ in size more than in any other  variety of the dog (14/28. W. Scrope 'Art of Deer Stalking' page 354.) and,  judging from analogy, more than in the aboriginal parent-species. The peculiar  colour called tortoise-shell is very rarely seen in a male cat; the males of  this variety being of a rusty tint.    In various breeds of the fowl the males and females often differ greatly; and  these differences are far from being the same with those which distinguish the  two sexes of the parent-species, the Gallus bankiva; and consequently have  originated under domestication. In certain sub-varieties of the Game race we  have the unusual case of the hens differing from each other more than the  cocks. In an Indian breed of a white colour shaded with black, the hens  invariably have black skins, and their bones are covered by a black  periosteum, whilst the cocks are never or most rarely thus characterised.  Pigeons offer a more interesting case; for throughout the whole great family  the two sexes do not often differ much; and the males and females of the  parent-form, the C. livia, are undistinguishable: yet we have seen that with  pouters the male has the characteristic quality of pouting more strongly  developed than the female; and in certain sub-varieties the males alone are  spotted or striated with black, or otherwise differ in colour. When male and  female English carrier-pigeons are exhibited in separate pens, the difference  in the development of the wattle over the beak and round the eyes is  conspicuous. So that here we have instances of the appearance of secondary  sexual characters in the domesticated races of a species in which such  differences are naturally quite absent.]    On the other hand, secondary sexual characters which belong to the species in  a state of nature are sometimes quite lost, or greatly diminished, under  domestication. We see this in the small size of the tusks in our improved  breeds of the pig, in comparison with those of the wild boar. There are sub-  breeds of fowls, in which the males have lost the fine-flowing tail-feathers  and hackles; and others in which there is no difference in colour between the  two sexes. In some cases the barred plumage, which in gallinaceous birds is  commonly the attribute of the hen, has been transferred to the cock, as in the  cuckoo sub-breeds. In other cases masculine characters have been partly  transferred to the female, as with the splendid plumage of the golden-spangled  Hamburgh hen, the enlarged comb of the Spanish hen, the pugnacious disposition  of the Game hen, and as in the well-developed spurs which occasionally appear  in the hens of various breeds. In Polish fowls both sexes are ornamented with  a topknot, that of the male being formed of hackle-like feathers, and this is  a new male character in the genus Gallus. On the whole, as far as I can judge,  new characters are more apt to appear in the males of our domesticated animals  than in the females (14/29. I have given in my 'Descent of Man' 2nd edition  page 223 sufficient evidence that male animals are usually more variable than  the females.), and afterwards to be inherited exclusively or more strongly by  the males. Finally, in accordance with the principle of inheritance as limited  by sex, the preservation and augmentation of secondary sexual characters in  natural species offers no especial difficulty, as this would follow through  that form of selection which I have called sexual selection.    INHERITANCE AT CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF LIFE.    This is an important subject. Since the publication of my 'Origin of Species'  I have seen no reason to doubt the truth of the explanation there given of one  of the most remarkable facts in biology, namely, the difference between the  embryo and the adult animal. The explanation is, that variations do not  necessarily or generally occur at a very early period of embryonic growth, and  that such variations are inherited at a corresponding age. As a consequence of  this the embryo, even after the parent-form has undergone great modification,  is left only slightly modified; and the embryos of widely-different animals  which are descended from a common progenitor remain in many important respects  like one another and probably like their common progenitor. We can thus  understand why embryology throws a flood of light on the natural system of  classification, as this ought to be as far as possible genealogical. When the  embryo leads an independent life, that is, becomes a larva, it has to be  adapted to the surrounding conditions in its structure and instincts,  independently of those of its parents; and the principle of inheritance at  corresponding periods of life renders this possible.    This principle is, indeed, in one way so obvious that it escapes attention. We  possess a number of races of animals and plants, which, when compared with one  another and with their parent-forms, present conspicuous differences, both in  their immature and mature states. Look at the seeds of the several kinds of  peas, beans, maize, which can be propagated truly, and see how they differ in  size, colour, and shape, whilst the full-grown plants differ but little.  Cabbages, on the other hand, differ greatly in foliage and manner of growth,  but hardly at all in their seeds; and generally it will be found that the  differences between cultivated plants at different periods of growth are not  necessarily closely connected together, for plants may differ much in their  seeds and little when full-grown, and conversely may yield seeds hardly  distinguishable, yet differ much when full-grown.

Sigma 2306 is a  triple, magnitudes seven, eight, and nine, distances 12\", p. 220 deg., and  0.8\", p. 68 deg.. The third star is, however, beyond our reach. The colors  of the two larger are respectively yellow and violet.    The star cluster 4400 is about one quarter as broad as the moon, and  easily seen with our smallest aperture.    [Illustration: MAP NO. 13.]    Passing near to the region covered by map No. 13, we find the remaining  portions of the constellations Sagittarius and Scutum Sobieskii. It will  be advisable to finish with the latter first. Glance at the clusters  4426 and 4437. Neither is large, but both are rich in stars. The nebula  4441 is a fine object of its kind. It brightens toward the center, and  Herschel thought he had resolved it into stars. The variable R is  remarkable for its eccentricities. Sometimes it attains nearly the  fourth magnitude, although usually at maximum it is below the fifth,  while at minimum it is occasionally of the sixth and at other times of  the seventh or eighth magnitude. Its period is irregular.    Turning back to Sagittarius, we resume our search for interesting  objects there, and the first that we discover is another star cluster,  for the stars are wonderfully gregarious in this quarter of the heavens.  The number our cluster bears on the map is 4424, corresponding with M 22  in Messier's catalogue. It is very bright, containing many stars of the  tenth and eleventh magnitudes, as well as a swarm of smaller ones. Sir  John Herschel regarded the larger stars in this cluster as possessing a  reddish tint. Possibly there was some peculiarity in his eye that gave  him this impression, for he has described a cluster in the constellation  Toucan in the southern hemisphere as containing a globular mass of  rose-colored stars inclosed in a spherical shell of white stars. Later  observers have confirmed his description of the shape and richness of  this cluster in Toucan, but have been unable to perceive the red hue of  the interior stars.    The eastern expanse of Sagittarius is a poor region compared with the  western end of the constellation, where the wide stream of the Milky Way  like a great river enriches its surroundings. The variables T and R are  of little interest to us, for they never become bright enough to be seen  without the aid of a telescope. In 54 we find, however, an interesting  double, which with larger telescopes than any of ours appears as a  triple. The two stars that we see are of magnitudes six and seven and a  half, distance 45\", p. 42 deg., colors yellow and blue. The third star,  perhaps of thirteenth magnitude, is distant 36\", p. 245 deg..    Retaining map No. 13 as our guide, we examine the western part of the  constellation Capricornus. Its leader alpha is a naked-eye double, the  two stars being a little more than 6' apart. Their magnitudes are three  and four, and both have a yellowish hue. The western star is alpha^1,  and is the fainter of the two. The other is designated as alpha^2. Both  are double. The components of alpha^1 are of magnitudes four and eight  and a half, distance 44\", p. 220 deg.. With the Washington twenty-six-inch  telescope a third star of magnitude fourteen has been found at a  distance of 40\", p. 182 deg.. In alpha^2 the magnitudes of the components  are three and ten and a half, distance 7.4\", p. 150 deg.. The smaller star  has a companion of the twelfth or thirteenth magnitude, distance 1.2\",  p. 240 deg.. This, of course, is hopelessly beyond our reach. Yet another  star of magnitude nine, distance 154\", p. 156, we may see easily.    Dropping down to beta, we find it to be a most beautiful and easy  double, possessing finely contrasted colors, gold and blue. The larger  star is of magnitude three, and the smaller, the blue one, of magnitude  six, distance 205\", p. 267 deg.. Between them there is a very faint star  which larger telescopes than ours divide into two, each of magnitude  eleven and a half; separated 3\", p. 325 deg..    Still farther south and nearly in a line drawn from alpha through beta  we find a remarkable group of double stars, sigma, pi, rho, and omicron.  The last three form a beautiful little triangle. We begin with sigma,  the faintest of the four. The magnitudes of its components are six and  nine, distance 54\", p. 177 deg.. In pi the magnitudes are five and nine,  distance 3.4\", p. 145 deg.; in rho, magnitudes five and eight, distance  3.8\", p. 177 deg. (a third star of magnitude seven and a half is seen at a  distance of 4', p. 150 deg.); in omicron, magnitudes six and seven, distance  22\", p. 240 deg..    The star cluster 4608 is small, yet, on a moonless night, worth a glance  with the five-inch.    [Illustration: MAP NO. 14.]    We now pass northward to the region covered by map No. 14, including the  remainder of Ophiuchus and Serpens. Beginning with the head of Serpens,  in the upper right-hand corner of the map, we find that beta, of  magnitude three and a half, has a ninth-magnitude companion, distance  30\", p. 265 deg.. The larger star is light blue and the smaller one  yellowish. The little star nu is double, magnitudes five and nine,  distance 50\", p. 31 deg., colors contrasted but uncertain. In delta we find  a closer double, magnitudes three and four, distance 3.5\", p. 190 deg.. It  is a beautiful object for the three-inch. The leader of the  constellation, alpha, of magnitude two and a half, has a faint companion  of only the twelfth magnitude, distance 60\", p. 350 deg.. The small star is  bluish. The variable R has a period about a week short of one year, and  at maximum exceeds the sixth magnitude, although sinking at minimum to  less than the eleventh. Its color is ruddy.    Passing eastward, we turn again into Ophiuchus, and find immediately the  very interesting double, lambda, whose components are of magnitudes four  and six, distance 1\", p. 55 deg.. This is a long-period binary, and  notwithstanding the closeness of its stars, our four-inch should  separate them when the seeing is fine. We shall do better, however, to  try with the five-inch. Sigma 2166 consists of two stars of magnitudes  six and seven and a half, distance 27\", p. 280 deg.. Sigma 2173 is a double  of quite a different order. The magnitudes of its components are both  six, the distance in 1899 0.98\", p. 331 deg.. It is evidently a binary in  rapid motion, as the distance changed from about a quarter of a second  in 1881 to more than a second in 1894. The star tau is a fine triple,  magnitudes five, six, and nine, distances 1.8\", p. 254 deg., and 100\", p.  127 deg.. The close pair is a binary system with a long period of  revolution, estimated at about two hundred years. We discover another  group of remarkable doubles in 67, 70, and 73. In the first-named star  the magnitudes are four and eight, distance 55\", p. 144 deg., colors  finely contrasted, pale yellow and red.    Much more interesting, however, is 70, a binary whose components have  completed a revolution since their discovery by Sir William Herschel,  the period being ninety-five years. The magnitudes are four and six, or,  according to Hall, five and six, distance in 1894 2.3\"; in 1900, 1.45\",  according to Maw. Hall says the apparent distance when the stars are  closest is about 1.7\", and when they are widest 6.7\". This star is one  of those whose parallax has been calculated with a reasonable degree of  accuracy. Its distance from us is about 1,260,000 times the distance of  the sun, the average distance apart of the two stars is about  2,800,000,000 miles (equal to the distance of Neptune from the sun), and  their combined mass is three times that of the sun. Hall has seen in the  system of 70 Ophiuchi three stars of the thirteenth magnitude or less,  at distances of about 60\", 90\", and 165\" respectively.    The star 73 is also a close double, and beyond our reach. Its magnitudes  are six and seven, distance 0.7\", p. 245 deg.. It is, no doubt, a binary.    Three star clusters in Ophiuchus remain to be examined. The first of  these, No. 4256, is partially resolved into stars by the five-inch. No.  4315 is globular, and has a striking environment of bystanding stars. It  is about one quarter as broad as the full moon, and our largest aperture  reveals the faint coruscation of its crowded components. No. 4410 is a  coarser and more scattered star swarm--a fine sight!    Farther toward the east we encounter a part of Serpens again, which  contains just one object worth glancing at, the double theta, whose  stars are of magnitudes four and four and a half, distance 21\", p. 104 deg..  Color, both yellow, the smaller star having the deeper hue.    [Illustration: MAP NO. 15.]    Let us next, with the guidance of map No. 15, enter the rich star fields  of Hercules, and of the head and first coils of Draco. According to  Argelander, Hercules contains more stars visible to the naked eye than  any other constellation, and he makes the number of them one hundred and  fifty-five, nearly two thirds of which are only of the sixth magnitude.  But Heis, who saw more naked-eye stars than Argelander, makes Ursa Major  precisely equal to Hercules in the number of stars, his enumeration  showing two hundred and twenty-seven in each constellation, while,  according to him, Draco follows very closely after, with two hundred and  twenty stars. Yet, on account of the minuteness of the majority of their  stars, neither of these constellations makes by any means as brilliant a  display as does Orion, to which Argelander assigns only one hundred and  fifteen naked-eye stars, and Heis one hundred and thirty-six.    We begin in Hercules with the star kappa, a pretty little double of  magnitudes five and a half and seven, distance 31\", p. 10 deg., colors  yellow and red. Not far away we find, in gamma, a larger star with a  fainter companion, the magnitudes in this case being three and a half  and nine, distance 38\", p. 242 deg., "]]]
