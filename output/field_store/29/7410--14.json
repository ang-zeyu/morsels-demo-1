[Illustration: THE SIEGE OF KIMBERLEY: TYPICAL SPLINTER-PROOF SHELTER OF  SAND-BAGS AND IRON PLATES    Photo, Hancox, Kimberley]    Boer tricks continued to be practised with little success. They served  instead to sharpen the wits of the beleaguered Kimburlians--if one may  be allowed to coin a word which seems to suit them. A few rifle-shots  were fired in the direction of Wright's Farm for the purpose of  pretending that the long-looked-for relieving force was approaching, and  thus draw out the Diamond Fields Horse; but the manoeuvre was a  failure. The Boers consoled themselves by blowing up two large culverts  near the rifle-butts on the line towards Spyfontein, where the bulk of  the Boer forces were then supposed to be. An official estimate at that  date (Nov. 25) placed the number of shells fired by the Boers during the  bombardment at 1000, while the number of shells fired by the British was  600. Owing to the fact that the hostile shells had so often fallen in  sandy ground, their effect had been neutralised. Experiments were made  with \"home-made\" shells, or rather De Beers-made shells, which exploded  to the general satisfaction of their manufacturers. Some of these were  said to be labelled \"With J. C. Rhodes's compliments,\" but this was  doubtless a cheery quip for the entertainment of the lugubrious, as  Colonel Kekewich and the \"Colossus\" were too good men of business to  waste their ammunition on pleasantries. These two marvellous people were  now working hand in hand, the great business brain of the one lending  support to the military skill of the other. Mr. Rhodes placed at the  disposal of the Colonel--one should say of his country--the whole  resources of De Beers, and worked without cessation for the welfare of  the people, spending without stint, intellect, energy, and funds on  their behalf. When the mines ceased to work, he still paid full wages to  the 2000 white men employed on them, and laid out large vegetable  gardens in the midst of Kenilworth for the purpose of supplying the  inhabitants with green foods. He organised a mounted force of 600 men,  supplying them himself with horses; and later on he instituted a service  of native runners and scouts, which served to keep the garrison alert as  to the whereabouts of the enemy. Indeed, space does not allow of a  faithful recital of the doings of this public benefactor, who, without  display, made his influence felt in every quarter of the town.    Kimberley, as said, was now in communication by searchlight with Colonel  Rhodes, and was racking its brains how an attempt might be made from the  east side to march out and assist the troops coming from Belmont. \"So  near and yet so far\" was the general feeling in regard to these troops,  and a burning desire for the handclasp of the gallant rescuers filled  all the brave yet anxious hearts that for so long had been cut off from  the outer world.    On the 25th of November there was unusual activity. The mounted troops  at dawn made a strong reconnaissance in force under Lieut.-Colonel Scott  Turner. The guns were under the charge of Colonel Chamier of the Royal  Artillery. Hostilities commenced with a hot fire from the Diamond Fields  Artillery's guns under Captain May, in the direction of Carter's Farm,  Colonel Scott Turner with his troops marching towards Lazaretto Ridge,  where the enemy was strongly entrenched. This took place at about 4.30  A.M. in the dusk of the early dawn. By good chance the pickets were  found to be asleep, and Colonel Scott Turner and his forces crept along  the ridge and with marvellous energy rushed the Boer redoubts. On the  instant rifles bristled--shots blazed out. But all was to no purpose;  the Boers had to surrender. They did this in their usual treacherous  fashion, hoisting the white flag while they took stray pot-shots at  their conquerors. This charge was one worthy of record, for few of the  men who engaged in it had ever used a bayonet in their lives. So little  did they know of the weapon, that they were unable to fix it in the  socket, and consequently rushed upon the enemy, rifle in one hand and  naked blade in the other!    As ill-luck would have it, there was a lack of ammunition, and the  British attack could not be pressed home. Meanwhile the Royal Engineers  on Otto Kopje were protecting the flanks, and a strong body of infantry  with a mounted force, field-guns and Maxims, were checking the advance  of the enemy from Spyfontein. An armoured train, also, under Lieutenant  Webster (North Lancashire Regiment), was reconnoitring north and south.  The train (which was supported by three half companies of the  Beaconsfield Town Guard under Major Fraser) proceeded south of  Kimberley, and held the enemy's reinforcements in check as they advanced  from Wimbledon. Subsequently, owing to the brisk firing of the Boer  guns, it was decided to return to Kimberley, where Colonel Scott Turner,  in consequence of his inability to hold the position he had stormed, was  forced also to retire. But during the hot cannonade in which our  artillery was engaged with that of the enemy in all directions save  Kenilworth, this gallant officer was wounded. First his horse was shot  under him, then a bullet pierced the muscle of his shoulder. But he  continued to perform his duties regardless of the inconvenience caused  by his wound. The Boers, as usual, paid no respect to the ambulance  waggon, despite the obvious Red Cross flag which fluttered over it. They  fired at it when they chose, and, as some reported, used explosive  bullets. Eight prisoners were captured, in addition to two wounded  Boers.    The day's work on the whole was satisfactory, as it ably demonstrated  that there was life in the garrison yet. And this glorious activity was  subsequently recognised in the following order:--         \"The officer commanding desires to thank all ranks who took       part in to-day's engagement for their excellent behaviour. The       garrison of Kimberley have this day shown that they can not       only defend their positions, but can sally out and drive the       enemy from their entrenched positions. He deplores the loss of       the brave comrades who have so honourably fallen in the       performance of their duty.\"    A second sortie of the same kind was attempted on the 28th of November,  but with more disastrous results. The troops took the same direction as  before--attacked the Boers, beat them back, and captured their laager  and three works. But, on attempting to take the fourth work, the enemy  fought desperately, and Lieut.-Colonel Scott Turner was killed. When  Colonel Scott Turner fell, Lieutenant Clifford, North Lancashire  Regiment, who had more than once distinguished himself, assumed command  of the Imperial Mounted Infantry, and, though wounded in the scalp,  pluckily remained on duty till all was over.[2]    There was terrible grief in the garrison at the loss of this splendid  officer, the principal organiser of the Town Guards and the successful  leader of so many skirmishes and sorties throughout the siege. The  following special order was issued:--         \"The officer commanding has again to congratulate the troops of       the garrison who engaged the enemy yesterday on their excellent       behaviour and on the capture of the enemy's laager, with his       supplies, ammunition, &c. It was in every respect a most       creditable performance. He has also again to deplore the loss       of many brave men who have fallen at the call of duty. It was       with profound sorrow he learnt that Lieut.-Colonel Scott Turner       was killed while gallantly leading his men against the last       stronghold of the enemy's defences. In Lieut.-Colonel Scott       Turner the garrison of Kimberley loses a brave and most       distinguished comrade, and the officer commanding feels sure       the whole population of Kimberley will join with them in       mourning the loss of this true British officer, to whose skill       and activity in the field is so largely due the complete       success of our efforts to keep the enemy at a safe distance       from this town.\"    Major M. C. Peakman, an excellent and most dauntless officer, succeeded  to the command of the Kimberley Light Horse in consequence of Colonel  Scott Turner's death.    Lieutenant Wright of the Kimberley Light Horse was killed, and among the  wounded were Lieutenant W. K. Clifford (1st Battalion Loyal North  Lancashire Regiment), Captain Walleck (Diamond Fields Horse), and  Lieutenant Watson (Kimberley Light Horse).    On the afternoon of the 29th of November, amid feelings of universal  regret, the remains of Colonel Scott Turner and others who fell in  Tuesday's sortie were interred. The ceremony, so common in those days,  was yet full of deep pathos. Round the graves stood Mr. Cecil Rhodes,  Dr. Smart, the Mayor of Kimberley, Mr. and the Hon. Mrs. Rochfort  Maguire, and indeed the whole mournful community of the place. Six  volleys were fired over the graves, six blasts blown on the bugle, and  then a last prayer being said, they left them \"alone in their glory.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [1] Captain Baden-Powell, of the Scots Guards.

After taking part in the operations in Matabeleland in 1893-94, he  was, in the latter year, placed on the \"Special Extra Regimental  Employment List,\" and in 1896 served with the Matabeleland Relief Force  as adjutant and paymaster. For this service he was mentioned in  despatches and received a brevet majority.

Finally, plenty of facts and proper names, as M. de Talleyrand so  well said. Agreed then! As soon as you have got this sketched out  on the lines above mentioned (it will serve also for the  illustrated), send it to my mother by Weyland. My mother will  already know through me to whom she has to give it.    There is nothing to be done with Schwab. His \"Delirium\" (as I  call it) [It was a \"Tellurium\"] stood in my room for a week, and  we stood there not knowing what to make of it. But never and no  how could we bring that good Schwab to try to make us see any  basis or proof of his calculation. My opinion is that, in order  to take away the incognito from his discovery, he ought to send a  sample to the Vienna Academy, and two others to the Berlin and  Paris Academies, for trial and discussion. If I can help him in  this matter with letters to Humboldt and Arago I will do it right  gladly; but it is as plain as day that incompetent private  sympathies are of no import in such a sensitive discovery, and  therefore can do nothing. Meanwhile they have made a subscription  of eight hundred guldens in money, and have bought the machine  for the Pest Museum.    The relic with authentic verification is in the locked-up box at  Wolff's. Beg the Herr Librarian (it would really make me ill if  he is not appointed) to be so good as to find this relic--he will  have no difficulty in recognising it--and to send it me to  Haslinger's address, Graben, Vienna.    About my law-suit more anon in Weimar. Meanwhile thank my  excellent advocate (does he take snuff?) warmly, and beg him to  continue to keep me in his good graces.    If I know that it will be agreeable to his Grace [The former  Hereditary Grand Duke and present Grand Duke of Saxony.] to see  me in Weimar this summer, I shall come, in spite of the upset  which this journey will occasion to me. You know how I am,  heartily and personally, in his favor without any interest. I  should like also to tell him many things, and for this a stay  there in the summer with walks (which as a rule I can't abide, as  you know) would be pleasanter and more convenient.    My stay in Pest might bear serious fruit, were it not that the  Byronic element, which you combat in me, becomes ever more and  more predominant.    Farewell and work hard! I cannot arrange any meeting with you. I  am not my own master. In August I mean to make a peregrination to  Oedenburg, and thence to Leo and Augusz (the latter in Szegzard).  If I come to Weimar it will be in July.    Address always to Haslinger's.    Adieu, my dear excellent Schober. Remain as good to me as you are  dear!    Yours ever affectionately,    F. Liszt    Remember me most kindly to Ziegesar and Wolff.        51. To Alexander Seroff    [Russian musical critic and composer (1820-71)]    I am most grateful, my dear sir, for the kind remembrance you  keep of me since Petersburg, [Seroff was at that time in the  Crimea.] and I beg you to excuse me a thousand times for not  having replied sooner to your most charming and interesting  letter. As the musical opinions on which you are kind enough to  enlarge have for long years past been completely my own, it is  needless for me to discuss them today with you. There could, at  most, be only one point in which we must differ perceptibly, but  as that one point is my own simple individuality you will quite  understand that I feel much embarrassed with my subject, and that  I get out of it in the most ordinary manner, by thanking you very  sincerely for the too flattering opinion that you have formed  about me.    The Overture to \"Coriolanus\" is one of those masterpieces sui  generis, on a solid foundation, without antecedent or sequel in  analogous works. Does it remind you of Shakespeare's exposition  of the tragedy of the same name (Act i., Scene I)? It is the only  pendant to it that I know in the productions of human genius.  Read it again, and compare it as you are thinking of it. You are  worthy of those noble emotions of Art, by the fervent zeal with  which you worship its creed. Your piano score of the Overture to  Coriolanus does all honor to your artist conscience, and shows a  rare and patient intelligence which is indispensable to bringing  this task to a satisfactory end. If I should publish my version  of the same Overture (it must be among my papers in Germany) I  shall beg your permission to send you, through Prince Dolgorouki  [Prince Argontinski-Dolgorouki, a devoted lover of music. A  friend of Liszt's: had rich property in the Crimea.] (I can't  tell you half the good I think of him), an annotated copy, which  I will beg you to add to the insignificant autograph which you  really estimate too highly in attaching so affectionate a price  to it! Accept once more, my dear sir, my most affectionate  regards.    F. Liszt    Elisabethgrad, September 14th. 1847        52. To Carl Haslinger in Vienna    [The original (without address) in the possession of M. Alfred  Bovet at Valentigney.--There is no doubt that it was written to  the above music publisher (son of the well-known Tobias H.), who  was a pupil of Czerny, and at the same time a pianist and  composer (1816-68), and friend of Liszt]    Woronino, December 19th, 1847    My dear Karolus,    I am delighted to hear from you of the arrival of my box from  Galatz. Will you be so good as to send it off speedily and safely  to Weymar, so that I may find it when I arrive there (at the end  of this month)? and, as I am away, address it to M. le Baron de  Ziegesar, Chamberlain to H.R.H. the Hereditary Grand Duchess. Beg  Lowy to take the same opportunity of sending me the other boxes  belonging to me, which remained behind, whether with him or  elsewhere, to my Weymar address, unless he prefers to bring them  with him when he comes to see me.    In my last letter to my uncle I gave him a commission for you--  namely, to beg you to send me the Melodies and Rhapsodies  Hongroises complete; also the Schwanengesang and the Winterreise  (transcriptions), large size edition, made into a book. As you  have had some proofs made of my new Rhapsodies, make up a parcel  of it all, which will be an agreeable surprise to me on my  arrival.    I have worked pretty well these last two months, between two  cigars in the morning, at several things which do not displease  me; but I want to go back to Germany for some weeks in order to  put myself in tune with the general tone, and to recreate myself  by the sight and hearing of the wonderful things produced there  by...Upon my word I don't know by whom in particular, if not the  whole world in general.    If you want me to...[editor's note: impossible to decipher this  word in Liszt's original letter] anything for you, tell me, and  give me your ideas as to cut and taste.    Send me also the Schumann Opus (Kreisleriana, etc.) published by  yourself and Mechetti, together with Bach's six Pedal Fugues, in  which I wish to steep myself more fully. If the three Sonnets  (both voice and pianoforte editions) are already re-corrected,  kindly send me also an author's copy.    Adieu, dear Karolus. I commend my box to you, and commend myself  to you also    As your sincere friend,    F. Liszt    I need not say that of course you shall be repaid immediately for  sending the box--only hurry on the sending.    Best regards to your wife.    Lowy will tell you what I wish in regard to the credit for my  uncle Eduard.        53. To The Hochwohlgeboren Herr Baron von Dornis, Jena.    [Autograph in the possession of Herr C. Geibel, bookseller in  Leipzig.--The addressee was a sculptor.]    The confidence which you place in me, most esteemed Herr Baron,  is naturally very flattering; but in order to meet it according  to your wishes, I ought to have quite other means at my disposal  than those I have.    It would of course be very gratifying to me to possess one of  your valued works; yet I cannot help taking this opportunity of  remarking that, in view of the far too many busts, medallions,  statuettes, caricatures, medals, and portraits of all kinds  existing of my humble self, I long ago resolved not to give  occasion to any further multiplication of them.    Accept, esteemed Herr Baron, my expressions of great regret that  I cannot meet your kind proposal as you wish, and with the  assurance of my highest esteem,    Believe me yours very truly,    F. Liszt    Weymar, March 6th, 1848        54. To Franz von Schober, Councillor of Legation at Weimar.    Castle Gratz, April 22nd, 1848.    My Dear and Honored Friend,    Your dear letter has brought me still nearer to you in the crisis  of the estro poetico, which the \"Hungaria\" [One of Liszt's  symphonic poems.] brought forth in me; and, thanks to this good  influence, I hope you will not be dissatisfied with the  composition.    Since my Beethoven Cantata I have written nothing so striking and  so spontaneous. One of these next days the instrumentation will  be completed, and when we have an opportunity we can have it  performed in Weimar in your honor and that of \"Weimar's dead.\"  [Refers to a poem entitled \"Weimar's Todten.\"]    Regardless of the blocking of the Russian frontier the Princess  Wittgenstein has safely passed through Radziwillow and Brody with  a special official outrider, and established herself at Castle  Gratz four days ago with her very charming and interesting  daughter. As it is still somewhat early for the German bath  season, I should like to persuade her to spend a couple of weeks  in Weimar before her Carlsbad \"cure\" (which, alas! is very  necessary for her). If my wishes should be successful I "]]]
