Upon these occasions the originator acted as master  of the ceremonies, and was duly respected, for he always wore a suit of  King James' own clothes. Dover died at the beginning of the Civil War,  so, fortunately for him, he did not live through the rigid rule of  Cromwell. The Cotswold games, however, were revived at the Restoration.  To this public benefactor (the shadow of whose cloak has surely fallen  on the shoulders of Lord Avebury) Drayton wrote in eulogy:      \"We'll have thy statue in some rock cut out    With brave inscriptions garnished about,    And under written, 'Lo! this is the man    Dover, that first these noble sports began.'    Lads of the hills and lasses of the vale    In many a song and many a merry tale    Shall mention thee; and having leave to play,    Unto thy name shall make a holiday.\"    Yet nobody did set up his statue, as should have been done on \"Dover  Hill\" by Chipping Camden.    Some odd cures for certain ailments are prescribed in remote parts of  the Cotswolds. Garden snails, for instance, which in Wiltshire are sold  for ordinary consumption, namely, food, as \"wall fruit,\" are used here  externally as a remedy for ague: and roasted mouse is a specific for the  whooping-cough. But for the latter complaint as efficacious a result may  be obtained by the pleasanter mode of riding on a donkey's back nine  times round a finger-post. This remedy, however, properly belongs to  Worcestershire.    If we continue in a south-westerly direction we shall pass historic  Sudeley, near Winchcombe, Postlip Hall, and Southam House. Sudeley  Castle must have been magnificent before it was dismantled in the Civil  War. Bravely it stood two sieges, but at length capitulated; and being  left a ruin by Cromwell's soldiers, the magnificent fifteenth-century  mansion was left for close upon two centuries to act as a quarry for the  neighbourhood. Under such disadvantages was its restoration commenced,  and it is wonderful what has been done; yet there has been a certain  admixture of Edwardian and Elizabethan portions which is somewhat  confusing. The banqueting room, with its noble oriel windows (originally  glazed with beryl), the keep with its dungeons, and the kitchen with its  huge fireplace four yards across, speak of days of lordly greatness, and  the names of many weighty nobles as well as kings and queens are closely  associated with the castle. Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was once  possessed of it; the youngest son of Owen Tudor and Henry V.'s widow  lived there; so did Sir Thomas Seymour, Edward VI.'s uncle, who married  and buried there Henry VIII.'s last queen, at which ceremony Lady Jane  Grey was chief mourner. Elizabeth was here upon one of her progresses,  and Charles I. was the last sovereign who slept there. The restored  rooms are full of historical furniture, pictures, and relics. Here may  be seen Amy Robsart's bed, or one of them, from Cumnor Hall: and the bed  upon which the martyr king slept, not here but at Kineton, before  Edgehill. There are numerous relics of the queen, who had the tact to  outlive her august spouse, and the foolishness to marry a fourth  husband. Catherine Parr's various books and literary compositions may  here be studied, including the letter in which she accepted Seymour's  offer of marriage. He was by no means the best of husbands, but a vast  improvement on the royal tyrant who had coldly planned the queen's  destruction; but owing to her ready wit his wrath was turned upon  Wriothesley, who was to have arrested her; for when he came to perform  that office, Henry called him an \"an errant knave and a beast.\" There  are lockets containing locks of her auburn hair, and portions of the  dress she wore. But the main interest is centred in the chapel where the  queen was buried. This building was dismantled with the rest in 1649,  and the fine Chandos monuments destroyed. Catherine's tomb, which was  within the altar rails, probably shared the fate of the rest, and its  position was soon forgotten. However, after the lapse of nearly a  century and a half, a plain slab of alabaster in the north wall,  doubtless part of the original monument, led to the discovery of a  leaden case in the shape of a human form lying immediately below, only a  foot or so beneath the surface of the ground. Upon the breast was the  following inscription:      K. P.    Here lyethe QUENE    KATERYN wife to KYNG    HENRY THE VIII., and    Last the wife of Thomas    Lord of Sudeley, highe    Admiyrall of England    And vncle to Kyng    Edward the VI.    dyed    5 September    MCCCCC    XLVIII.    The cerecloth, hard with wax and gums, was removed from a portion of the  arm, which was discovered after close upon three centuries to be still  white and soft. According to another account, when the covering of the  face was removed, not only the features, but the eyes were in perfect  preservation. The body was reinterred, but treated with no decent  respect, for the spot was occupied as an enclosure for rabbits; and upon  one occasion it was dug up by some drunken men, who by local tradition,  as a reward for their desecration, all came to an untimely end. The  alabaster block may still be seen in the north wall of the chapel, but  the body now lies beneath a recumbent figure in white marble which has  been placed to the queen's memory.    [Illustration: POSTLIP HALL.]    Postlip Hall stands high in a picturesque spot not far from the main  road to Cheltenham. It is a many-gabled Elizabethan house, preserving  its original character, but spoiled by the insertion of plate-glass  windows. Within there is one particularly fine room of elaborate oak  carvings (and the arms of the Broadways who built the house) of  sufficient importance to form the subject of one of the plates in Nash's  _Mansions_. The house has or had the reputation of being haunted; but  that was long ago in the days when it stood neglected and uninhabited.    Southam House, or Southam-de-la-Bere, to the south-west (also depicted  in Nash), is a curious early-Tudor building of timber and stone, and has  the advantage over Sudeley, as it was not of sufficient military  importance to be roughly handled by the Parliamentarian soldiers. The  ancient painted glass in the windows and an elaborate chimney-piece  bearing shields of arms came from Hayles Abbey. The ceilings are oak  panelled, and the arms of Henry VII. occur in numerous places. The  situation of the house is fine, and the view over the vast stretch of  country towards Worcestershire and Herefordshire magnificent. The  builder of the mansion was Sir John Huddleston, whose wife was the queen  Jane Seymour's aunt. The de-la-Beres, to whom the estate passed by  marriage, were closely allied with the Plantagenet kings, two sisters  marrying Thomas Plantagenet, Edward III.'s son, and Henry Plantagenet,  Duke of Lancaster.    Avoiding Cheltenham, we will pick up the road to Stroud at Birdlip, a  favourite meeting-place of the hounds on account of the surrounding  woods. Coming from the south there is a gradual climb through those  delightful woods until you burst upon a gorgeous view, with the ancient  \"Ermine Street\" running, like a white wand lying upon the level pattern  work of meadowland, to Gloucester, and the hills of Malvern away in the  distance. Whether it was the great dark mass of hill in the foreground  contrasted against the level stretch of country, or whether it was the  stormy sky when we visited Birdlip on a late autumnal day, that gave the  scene such a wild, romantic look, it would be difficult to say, but we  remember no view with such breadth of contrast of light and shade, or  one so fitted to lead the imagination into the mystic realms of  fairyland.    Up in these heights, and in so secluded a spot, it came as a surprise to  find a museum. This we believe long since has been dispersed by the  hammer, but we remember some really interesting things. The lady  curator, the proprietress of the \"Black Horse,\" had been given many of  the exhibits by the neighbouring gentry, and was not a little proud of  her collection. Valuable coins, flint weapons, fossils, pictures, and  the usual medley. There was one little oil painting on a panel, the head  of a beautiful girl with high powdered hair of the Georgian period,  which had all the vigour of a Romney, and undoubtedly was by a master  craftsman. Two curiosities we remember in particular: a pair of leggings  said to have been worn by the great Duke of Marlborough, and the wooden  finger-stocks from a village dame-school. It would be interesting to  know where these curiosities are now. The only other finger-stocks we  know of are in Ashby-de-la-Zouch church, Leicestershire.    [Illustration: STOCKS, PAINSWICK.]    Painswick, to the south-west, is a sleepy old town with a fine  Perpendicular church much restored internally, but containing some  handsome monuments. The churchyard is noted for its formal array of  clipped yew trees, probably unique. They have the same peculiarity as  Stonehenge, for it is said nobody can count them twice the same. As,  however, we did not visit the adjacent inn, we managed to accomplish the  task. Close to the church wall are the stocks--iron ones.    [Illustration: NAILSWORTH.]    Upon the way to Stroud many weird old buildings are passed which once  were, and some are still, cloth mills; but some are deserted and  dilapidated, and have a sad look, as if remembering more prosperous  days; and when the leaves are fast falling in the famous golden valley  they look indeed forlorn. One would think there can be little poetry  about an old cloth mill, but ere one gives an opinion one must visit the  golden valley in the autumn. Around Nailsworth, Rodborough, and  Woodchester there are many ancient houses which have degenerated into  poor tenements. Such a one at Nailsworth has the brief address \"No. 5  Egypt,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/398"],[0,"The First Book of Adam and Eve (#14)"],[1," you taken them, and  sown these two trees, or have we gone astray in the earth; or has the  enemy deceived us?  If it be real, then, O God, reveal to us the secret  of these two trees and of the two figs.\"    8 Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him, \"O Adam, when I  sent you to fetch the figs, Satan went before you to the cave, took the  figs, and buried them outside, eastward of the cave, thinking to  destroy them; and not sowing them with good intent.    9 Not for his mere sake, then, have these trees grown up at once; but I  had mercy on you and I commanded them to grow.  And they grew to be two  large trees, that you be overshadowed by their branches, and find rest;  and that I made you see My power and My marvelous works.    10 And, also, to show you Satan's meanness, and his evil works, for  ever since you came out of the garden, he has not ceased, no, not one  day, from doing you some harm.  But I have not given him power over  you.\"    11 And God said, \"From now on, O Adam, rejoice on account of the trees,  you and Eve; and rest under them when you feel weary.  But do not eat  any of their fruit or come near them.\"    12 Then Adam cried, and said, \"O God, will You again kill us, or will  You drive us away from before Your face, and cut our life from off the  face of the earth?    13 O God, I beg you, if You know that there be in these trees either  death or some other evil, as at the first time, root them up from near  our cave, and with them; and leave us to die of the heat, of hunger and  of thirst.    14 For we know Your marvelous works, O God, that they are great, and  that by Your power You can bring one thing out of another, without  one's wish.  For Your power can make rocks to become trees, and trees  to become rocks.\"          Chapter LXIV - Adam and Eve partake of the first earthly food.    1 Then God looked at Adam and at his strength of mind, at his endurance  of hunger and thirst, and of the heat.  And He changed the two fig  trees into two figs, as they were at first, and then said to Adam and  to Eve, \"Each of you may take one fig.\"  And they took them, as the  Lord commanded them.    2 And He said to them, \"You must now go into the cave and eat the figs,  and satisfy your hunger, or else you will die.\"    3 So, as God commanded them, they went into the cave about sunset.  And  Adam and Eve stood up and prayed during the setting sun.    4 Then they sat down to eat the figs; but they knew not how to eat  them; for they were not accustomed to eat earthly food.  They were  afraid that if they ate, their stomach would be burdened and their  flesh thickened, and their hearts would take to liking earthly food.    5 But while they were thus seated, God, out of pity for them, sent them  His angel, so they wouldn't perish of hunger and thirst.    6 And the angel said to Adam and Eve, \"God says to you that you do not  have the strength that would be required to fast until death; eat,  therefore, and strengthen your bodies; for you are now animal flesh and  cannot subsist without food and drink.\"    7 Then Adam and Eve took the figs and began to eat of them.  But God  had put into them a mixture as of savory bread and blood.    8 Then the angel went from Adam and Eve, who ate of the figs until they  had satisfied their hunger.  Then they put aside what was left; but by  the power of God, the figs became whole again, because God blessed them.    9 After this Adam and Eve got up, and prayed with a joyful heart and  renewed strength, and praised and rejoiced abundantly the whole of that  night.  And this was the end of the eighty-third day.          Chapter LXV - Adam and Eve acquire digestive organs.  Final hope of  returning to the Garden is lost.    1 And when it was day, they got up and prayed, after their custom, and  then went out of the cave.    2 But they became sick from the food they had eaten because they were  not used to it, so they went about in the cave saying to each other:--    3 \"What has our eating caused to happen to us, that we should be in  such pain?  We are in misery, we shall die!  It would have been better  for us to have died keeping our bodies pure than to have eaten and  defiled them with food.\"    4 Then Adam said to Eve, \"This pain did not come to us in the garden,  neither did we eat such bad food there.  Do you think, O Eve, that God  will plague us through the food that is in us, or that our innards will  come out; or that God means to kill us with this pain before He has  fulfilled His promise to us?\"    5 Then Adam besought the Lord and said, \"O Lord, let us not perish  through the food we have eaten.  O Lord, don't punish us; but deal with  us according to Your great mercy, and forsake us not until the day of  the promise You have made us.\"    6 Then God looked at them, and then fitted them for eating food at  once; as to this day; so that they should not perish.    7 Then Adam and Eve came back into the cave sorrowful and crying  because of the alteration of their bodies.  And they both knew from  that hour that they were altered beings, that all hope of returning to  the garden was now lost; and that they could not enter it.    8 For that now their bodies had strange functions; and all flesh that  requires food and drink for its existence, cannot be in the garden.    9 Then Adam said to Eve, \"Behold, our hope is now lost; and so is our  trust to enter the garden.  We no longer belong to the inhabitants of  the garden; but from now on we are earthy and of the dust, and of the  inhabitants of the earth.  We shall not return to the garden, until the  day in which God has promised to save us, and to bring us again into  the garden, as He promised us.\"    10 Then they prayed to God that He would have mercy on them; after  which, their mind was quieted, their hearts were broken, and their  longing was cooled down; and they were like strangers on earth.  That  night Adam and Eve spent in the cave, where they slept heavily by  reason of the food they had eaten.          Chapter LXVI - Adam does his first day's work.    1 When it was morning, the day after they had eaten food, Adam and Eve  prayed in the cave, and Adam said to Eve, \"Look, we asked for food of  God, and He gave it.  But now let us also ask Him to give us a drink of  water.\"    2 Then they got up, and went to the bank of the stream of water, that  was on the south border of the garden, in which they had before thrown  themselves.  And they stood on the bank, and prayed to God that He  would command them to drink of the water.    3 Then the Word of God came to Adam, and said to him, \"O Adam, your  body has become brutish, and requires water to drink.  Take some and  drink it, you and Eve, then give thanks and praise.\"    4 Adam and Eve then went down to the stream and drank from it, until  their bodies felt refreshed.  After having drunk, they praised God, and  then returned to their cave, after their former custom.  This happened  at the end of eighty-three days.    5 Then on the eighty-fourth day, they took the two figs and hung them  in the cave, together with the leaves thereof, to be to them a sign and  a blessing from God.  And they placed them there so that if their  descendants came there, they would see the wonderful things God had  done for them.    6 Then Adam and Eve again stood outside the cave, and asked God to show  them some food with which they could nourish their bodies.    7 Then the Word of God came and said to him, \"O Adam, go down to the  westward of the cave until you come to a land of dark soil, and there  you shall find food.\"    8 And Adam obeyed the Word of God, took Eve, and went down to a land of  dark soil, and found there wheat* growing in the ear and ripe, and figs  to eat; and Adam rejoiced over it.    9 Then the Word of God came again to Adam, and said to him, \"Take some  of this wheat and make yourselves some bread with it, to nourish your  body therewith.\"  And God gave Adam's heart wisdom, to work out the  corn until it became bread.    10 Adam accomplished all that, until he grew very faint and weary.  He  then returned to the cave; rejoicing at what he had learned of what is  done with wheat, until it is made into bread for one's use.      * In this book, the terms 'corn' and 'wheat' are used interchangeably.  The reference is possibly used to indicate a type of ancient grain  resembling Egyptian Corn also known as Durra.  Durra is a wheat-like  cereal grain frequently cultivated in dry regions such as Egypt.          Chapter LXVII - \"Then Satan began to lead astray Adam and Eve. . . .\"    1 When Adam and Eve went down to the land of black mud and came near to  the wheat God had showed them and saw that it was ripe and ready for  reaping, they did not have a sickle to reap it with.  So they readied  themselves, and began to pull up the wheat by hand, until it was all  done.    2 Then they heaped it into a pile; and, faint from heat and from  thirst, they went under a shady tree, where the breeze fanned them to  sleep.    3 But Satan saw what Adam and Eve had done.  And he called his hosts,  and said to them, \"Since God has shown to Adam and Eve all about this  wheat, wherewith to strengthen their bodies--and, look, they have come  and made a big pile of it, and faint from the toil are now  asleep--come, let us set fire to this heap of corn, and burn it, and  let us take that bottle of water that is by them, and empty it out, so  that they may find nothing to drink, and we kill them with hunger and  thirst.    4 Then, when they wake up from their sleep, and seek to return to the  cave, we will come to them in the way, and will lead them astray; so  that they die of hunger and thirst; when they may, perhaps, deny God,  and He destroy them.  So shall we be rid of them.\"    5 Then Satan and his hosts set the wheat on fire and burned it up.    6 But from the heat of the flame Adam and Eve awoke from their sleep,  and saw the wheat burning, and the bucket of"]]]
