Receive as the highest testimonies of your employers' regard whatever  observations they may make on your work: such admonitions are the most  _unequivocal proofs_ of their desire to make you thoroughly understand  their taste, and their wish to retain you in their service, or they  would not take the trouble to teach you.    Enter into all their plans of economy,[53-+] and endeavour to make the  most of every thing, as well for your own honour as your master's  profit, and you will find that whatever care you take for his profit  will be for your own: take care that the meat which is to make its  appearance again in the parlour is handsomely cut with a sharp knife,  and put on a clean dish: take care of the _gravy_ (see No. 326) which is  left, it will save many pounds of meat in making sauce for _hashes_,  _poultry_, and many little dishes.    MANY THINGS MAY BE REDRESSED in a different form from that in which they  were first served, and improve the appearance of the table without  increasing the expense of it.    COLD FISH, soles, cod, whitings, smelts, &c. may be cut into bits, and  put into escallop shells, with cold oyster, lobster, or shrimp sauce,  and bread crumbled, and put into a Dutch oven, and browned like  scalloped oysters. (No. 182.)    The best way TO WARM COLD MEAT is to sprinkle the joint over with a  little salt, and put it in a DUTCH OVEN, at some distance before a  gentle fire, that it may warm gradually; watch it carefully, and keep  turning it till it is quite hot and brown: it will take from twenty  minutes to three quarters of an hour, according to its thickness; serve  it up with gravy: this is much better than hashing it, and by doing it  nicely a cook will get great credit. POULTRY (No. 530*), FRIED FISH (see  No. 145), &c. may be redressed in this way.    Take care of the _liquor_ you have boiled poultry or meat in; in five  minutes you may make it into EXCELLENT SOUP. See _obs._ to Nos. 555 and  229, No. 5, and the 7th chapter of the Rudiments of Cookery.    No good housewife has any pretensions to _rational economy_ who boils  animal food without converting the broth into some sort of soup.    However highly the uninitiated in the mystery of soup-making may elevate  the external appendage of his olfactory organ at the mention of \"POT  LIQUOR,\" if he tastes No. 5, or 218, 555, &c. he will be as delighted  with it as a Frenchman is with \"_potage a la Camarani_,\" of which it is  said \"a single spoonful will lap the palate in Elysium; and while one  drop of it remains on the tongue, each other sense is eclipsed by the  voluptuous thrilling of the lingual nerves!!\"    BROTH OF FRAGMENTS.--When you dress a large dinner, you may make good  broth, or portable soup (No. 252), at very small cost, by taking care of  all the trimmings and parings of the meat, game, and poultry, you are  going to use: wash them well, and put them into a stewpan, with as much  cold water as will cover them; set your stewpan on a hot fire; when it  boils, take off all the scum, and set it on again to simmer gently; put  in two carrots, two turnips, a large onion, three blades of pounded  mace, and a head of celery; some mushroom parings will be a great  addition. Let it continue to simmer gently four or five hours; strain it  through a sieve into a clean basin. This will save a great deal of  expense in buying gravy-meat.    Have the DUST, &c. removed regularly once in a fortnight, and have your  KITCHEN CHIMNEY swept once a month; many good dinners have been spoiled,  and many houses burned down, by the soot falling: the best security  against this, is for the cook to have a long birch-broom, and every  morning brush down all the soot within reach of it. Give notice to your  employers when the contents of your COAL-CELLAR are diminished to a  chaldron.    It will be to little purpose to procure good provisions, unless you have  proper utensils[55-*] to prepare them in: the most expert artist cannot  perform his work in a perfect manner without proper instruments; you  cannot have neat work without nice tools, nor can you dress victuals  well without an apparatus appropriate to the work required. See 1st page  of chapter 7 of the Rudiments of Cookery.    In those houses where the cook enjoys the confidence of her employer so  much as to be intrusted with the care of the store-room, which is not  very common, she will keep an exact account of every thing as it comes  in, and insist upon the weight and price being fixed to every article  she purchases, and occasionally will (and it may not be amiss to  jocosely drop a hint to those who supply them that she does) _reweigh_  them, for her own satisfaction, as well as that of her employer, and  will not trust the key of this room to any one; she will also keep an  account of every thing she takes from it, and manage with as much  consideration and frugality as if it was her own property she was using,  endeavouring to disprove the adage, that \"PLENTY makes _waste_,\" and  remembering that \"wilful waste makes woful want.\"    The honesty of a cook must be above all suspicion: she must obtain, and  (in spite of the numberless temptations, &c. that daily offer to bend  her from it) preserve a character of spotless integrity and useful  industry,[55-+] remembering that it is the fair price of INDEPENDENCE,  which all wish for, but none without it can hope for; only a fool or a  madman will be so silly or so crazy as to expect to reap where he has  been too idle to sow.    Very few modern-built town-houses have a proper place to preserve  provisions in. The best substitute is a HANGING SAFE, which you may  contrive to suspend in an airy situation; and when you order meat,  poultry, or fish, tell the tradesman when you intend to dress it: he  will then have it in his power to serve you with provision that will do  him credit, which the finest meat, &c. in the world will never do,  unless it has been kept a proper time to be ripe and tender.    If you have a well-ventilated larder in a shady, dry situation, you may  make still surer, by ordering in your meat and poultry such a time  before you want it as will render it tender, which the finest meat  cannot be, unless hung a proper time (see 2d chapter of the Rudiments of  Cookery), according to the season, and nature of the meat, &c.; but  always, as \"_les bons hommes de bouche de France_\" say, till _it is_  \"_assez mortifiee_.\"    Permitting this process to proceed to a certain degree renders meat much  more easy of solution in the stomach, and for those whose digestive  faculties are delicate, it is of the utmost importance that it be  attended to with the greatest nicety, for the most consummate skill in  the culinary preparation of it will not compensate for the want of  attention to this. (Read _obs._ to No. 68.) Meat that is _thoroughly  roasted_, or _boiled_, eats much shorter and tenderer, and is in  proportion more digestible, than that which is _under_-done.    You will be enabled to manage much better if your employers will make  out a BILL OF FARE FOR THE WEEK on the Saturday before: for example, for  a family of half a dozen--         _Sunday_ Roast beef (No. 19), and my pudding (No. 554).         _Monday_ Fowl (Nos. 16. 58), what was left of my pudding fried, and       warmed in the Dutch oven.         _Tuesday_ Calf's head (No. 10), apple-pie.         _Wednesday_ Leg of mutton (No. 1), or (No. 23).         _Thursday_ Do. broiled or hashed (No. 487), or (No. 484,) pancakes.         _Friday_ Fish (No. 145), pudding (No. 554).         _Saturday_ Fish, or eggs and bacon (No. 545).    It is an excellent plan to have certain things on certain days. When  your butcher or poulterer knows what you will want, he has a better  chance of doing his best for you; and never think of ordering BEEF FOR  ROASTING except for Sunday.    When the weather or season[56-*] is very unfavourable for keeping meat,  &c. give him the choice of sending that which is in the best order for  dressing; _i. e._ either ribs or sirloin of beef, or leg, loin, or neck  of mutton, &c.    Meat in which you can detect the slightest trace of putrescency, has  reached its highest degree of tenderness, and should be dressed without  delay; but before this period, which in some kinds of meat is offensive,  the due degree of inteneration may be ascertained, by its yielding  readily to the pressure of the finger, and by its opposing little  resistance to an attempt to bind the joint.    Although we strongly recommend that animal food should be hung up in the  open air, till its fibres have lost some degree of their toughness; yet,  let us be clearly understood also to warn you, that if kept till it  loses its natural sweetness, it is as detrimental to health, as it is  disagreeable to the smell and taste.    IN VERY COLD WEATHER, bring your meat, poultry, &c. into the kitchen,  early in the morning, if you roast, boil, or stew it ever so gently and  ever so long; if it be _frozen_, it will continue tough and unchewable.    Without very watchful attention to this, the most skilful cook in the  world will get no credit, be she ever so careful in the management of  her spit or her stewpan.    The time meat should hang to be tender, depends on the heat and humidity  of the air. If it is not kept long enough, it is hard and tough; if too  long, it loses its flavour. It should be hung where it will have a  thorough air, and be dried with a cloth, night and morning, to keep it  from damp and mustiness.    Before you dress it, wash it well; if it is roasting beef, _pare off the  outside_.    If you fear meat,[57-*] &c. will not keep till the time it is wanted,  _par_-roast or _par_-boil it; it will then keep a couple of days longer,  when it may be dressed in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28693"],[0,"Tales of the Fish Patrol (#14)"],[1,"and repainted its bottom, made a trifling alteration  about the centre-board, overhauled the running gear, and sat up  nearly all of Saturday night sewing on a new and much larger sail. So  large did he make it, in fact, that additional ballast was imperative,  and we stowed away nearly five hundred extra pounds of old railroad  iron in the bottom of the boat.    Sunday came, and with it came Demetrios Contos, to break the law  defiantly in open day. Again we had the afternoon sea-breeze, and  again Demetrios cut loose some forty or more feet of his rotten net,  and got up sail and under way under our very noses. But he had  anticipated Charley's move, and his own sail peaked higher than ever,  while a whole extra cloth had been added to the after leech.    It was nip and tuck across to the Contra Costa Hills, neither of us  seeming to gain or to lose. But by the time we had made the return  tack to the Sonoma Hills, we could see that, while we footed it at  about equal speed, Demetrios had eaten into the wind the least bit  more than we. Yet Charley was sailing our boat as finely and  delicately as it was possible to sail it, and getting more out of it  than he ever had before.    Of course, he could have drawn his revolver and fired at Demetrios;  but we had long since found it contrary to our natures to shoot at a  fleeing man guilty of only a petty offence. Also a sort of tacit  agreement seemed to have been reached between the patrolmen and the  fishermen. If we did not shoot while they ran away, they, in turn, did  not fight if we once laid hands on them. Thus Demetrios Contos ran  away from us, and we did no more than try our best to overtake him;  and, in turn, if our boat proved faster than his, or was sailed  better, he would, we knew, make no resistance when we caught up with  him.    With our large sails and the healthy breeze romping up the Carquinez  Straits, we found that our sailing was what is called \"ticklish.\" We  had to be constantly on the alert to avoid a capsize, and while  Charley steered I held the main-sheet in my hand with but a single  turn round a pin, ready to let go at any moment. Demetrios, we could  see, sailing his boat alone, had his hands full.    But it was a vain undertaking for us to attempt to catch him. Out of  his inner consciousness he had evolved a boat that was better than  ours. And though Charley sailed fully as well, if not the least bit  better, the boat he sailed was not so good as the Greek's.    \"Slack away the sheet,\" Charley commanded; and as our boat fell off  before the wind, Demetrios's mocking laugh floated down to us.    Charley shook his head, saying, \"It's no use. Demetrios has the  better boat. If he tries his performance again, we must meet it with  some new scheme.\"    This time it was my imagination that came to the rescue.    \"What's the matter,\" I suggested, on the Wednesday following, \"with my  chasing Demetrios in the boat next Sunday, while you wait for him on  the wharf at Vallejo when he arrives?\"    Charley considered it a moment and slapped his knee.    \"A good idea! You're beginning to use that head of yours. A credit to  your teacher, I must say.\"    \"But you mustn't chase him too far,\" he went on, the next moment, \"or  he'll head out into San Pablo Bay instead of running home to Vallejo,  and there I'll be, standing lonely on the wharf and waiting in vain  for him to arrive.\"    On Thursday Charley registered an objection to my plan.    \"Everybody'll know I've gone to Vallejo, and you can depend upon it  that Demetrios will know, too. I'm afraid we'll have to give up the  idea.\"    This objection was only too valid, and for the rest of the day I  struggled under my disappointment. But that night a new way seemed to  open to me, and in my eagerness I awoke Charley from a sound sleep.    \"Well,\" he grunted, \"what's the matter? House afire?\"    \"No,\" I replied, \"but my head is. Listen to this. On Sunday you and I  will be around Benicia up to the very moment Demetrios's sail heaves  into sight. This will lull everybody's suspicions. Then, when  Demetrios's sail does heave in sight, do you stroll leisurely away and  up-town. All the fishermen will think you're beaten and that you know  you're beaten.\"    \"So far, so good,\" Charley commented, while I paused to catch breath.    \"And very good indeed,\" I continued proudly. \"You stroll carelessly  up-town, but when you're once out of sight you leg it for all you're  worth for Dan Maloney's. Take the little mare of his, and strike out  on the county road for Vallejo. The road's in fine condition, and you  can make it in quicker time than Demetrios can beat all the way down  against the wind.\"    \"And I'll arrange right away for the mare, first thing in the  morning,\" Charley said, accepting the modified plan without  hesitation.    \"But, I say,\" he said, a little later, this time waking _me_ out of a  sound sleep.    I could hear him chuckling in the dark.    \"I say, lad, isn't it rather a novelty for the fish patrol to be  taking to horseback?\"    \"Imagination,\" I answered. \"It's what you're always preaching--'keep  thinking one thought ahead of the other fellow, and you're bound to  win out.'\"    \"He! he!\" he chuckled. \"And if one thought ahead, including a mare,  doesn't take the other fellow's breath away this time, I'm not your  humble servant, Charley Le Grant.\"    \"But can you manage the boat alone?\" he asked, on Friday. \"Remember,  we've a ripping big sail on her.\"    I argued my proficiency so well that he did not refer to the matter  again till Saturday, when he suggested removing one whole cloth from  the after leech. I guess it was the disappointment written on my face  that made him desist; for I, also, had a pride in my boat-sailing  abilities, and I was almost wild to get out alone with the big sail  and go tearing down the Carquinez Straits in the wake of the flying  Greek.    As usual, Sunday and Demetrios Contos arrived together. It had become  the regular thing for the fishermen to assemble on Steamboat Wharf to  greet his arrival and to laugh at our discomfiture. He lowered sail a  couple of hundred yards out and set his customary fifty feet of rotten  net.    \"I suppose this nonsense will keep up as long as his old net holds  out,\" Charley grumbled, with intention, in the hearing of several of  the Greeks.    \"Den I give-a heem my old-a net-a,\" one of them spoke up, promptly and  maliciously.    \"I don't care,\" Charley answered. \"I've got some old net myself he can  have--if he'll come around and ask for it.\"    They all laughed at this, for they could afford to be sweet-tempered  with a man so badly outwitted as Charley was.    \"Well, so long, lad,\" Charley called to me a moment later. \"I think  I'll go up-town to Maloney's.\"    \"Let me take the boat out?\" I asked.    \"If you want to,\" was his answer, as he turned on his heel and walked  slowly away.    Demetrios pulled two large salmon out of his net, and I jumped into  the boat. The fishermen crowded around in a spirit of fun, and when I  started to get up sail overwhelmed me with all sorts of jocular  advice. They even offered extravagant bets to one another that I would  surely catch Demetrios, and two of them, styling themselves the  committee of judges, gravely asked permission to come along with me to  see how I did it.    But I was in no hurry. I waited to give Charley all the time I could,  and I pretended dissatisfaction with the stretch of the sail and  slightly shifted the small tackle by which the huge sprit forces up  the peak. It was not until I was sure that Charley had reached Dan  Maloney's and was on the little mare's back, that I cast off from the  wharf and gave the big sail to the wind. A stout puff filled it and  suddenly pressed the lee gunwale down till a couple of buckets of  water came inboard. A little thing like this will happen to the best  small-boat sailors, and yet, though I instantly let go the sheet and  righted, I was cheered sarcastically, as though I had been guilty of a  very awkward blunder.    When Demetrios saw only one person in the fish patrol boat, and that  one a boy, he proceeded to play with me. Making a short tack out, with  me not thirty feet behind, he returned, with his sheet a little free,  to Steamboat Wharf. And there he made short tacks, and turned and  twisted and ducked around, to the great delight of his sympathetic  audience. I was right behind him all the time, and I dared to do  whatever he did, even when he squared away before the wind and jibed  his big sail over--a most dangerous trick with such a sail in such a  wind.    He depended upon the brisk sea breeze and the strong ebb tide, which  together kicked up a nasty sea, to bring me to grief. But I was on my  mettle, and never in all my life did I sail a boat better than on that  day. I was keyed up to concert pitch, my brain was working smoothly  and quickly, my hands never fumbled once, and it seemed that I almost  divined the thousand little things which a small-boat sailor must be  taking into consideration every second.    It was Demetrios who came to grief instead. Something went wrong with  his centre-board, so that it jammed in the case and would not go all  the way down. In a moment's breathing space, which he had gained from  me by a clever trick, I saw him working impatiently with the  centre-board, trying to force it down. I gave him little time, and he  was compelled quickly to return to the tiller and sheet.    The centre-board made him anxious. He gave over playing with me, and  started on the long beat to Vallejo. To my joy, on the first long tack  across, I found that I could eat into the wind just a little bit  closer than he. Here was where another man in the boat would have been  of value to him; for, with me but a few feet astern, he did not dare  let go the tiller and run amidships to try to force down the  centre-board.    Unable to hang on as close in the eye of the wind as"]]]
