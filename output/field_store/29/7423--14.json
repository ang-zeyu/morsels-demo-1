Give up your banners and your arms, and throw yourselves  on my mercy, and I will do with you as God gives me grace.  In no  other way can you have truce or friendship with me.\"    To this the Frenchmen knew not what to say.  First they consulted  together, then some of them went back across the water to take  counsel with those who waited there.  They talked long, and anxiously  those on the Spanish side awaited their return.  At length one of  their messengers returned, and going to Menendez he offered him a  large sum of money if he would swear to spare their lives.    But Menendez would promise nothing.  The Frenchmen were helpless.  They were starving and in his hands.  And both he and they knew it.  They saw no hope anywhere, so they yielded to the Spanish general's  demands.    Once more the boat was sent across the water, and this time it came  back laden with banners, arms and armour.  Then guarded by Spanish  soldiers the Frenchmen were brought across by tons.  As each batch  landed they found themselves prisoners; their arms were taken from  them and their hands were tied behind their backs.    All day, hour after hour, the boat plied to and fro: and when all  the Frenchmen had been brought over they were ordered to march  forward.  The Spanish general walked in front.  But he did not go  far, for the sun was already setting, and it was time to camp for  the night.  So but a little way from the shore he stopped, and drew  a line in the sand.  And when the wretched Frenchmen reached that  line, weaponless and helpless as they were, they were one and all  put to death.  Then, glorying in his deed, Menendez returned to St.  Augustine.    But he had not yet completely wiped out the French colony.  For  besides those he had so ruthlessly slain there was another large  party under Ribaut, who, ignorant of all that had happened, were  still slowly making their way to Fort Caroline.  But again news of  their whereabouts was brought to Menendez by Indians, and again he  set off to waylay them.    He found them on the same spot as he had found the first party.  But  this time the Frenchmen had made a raft, and upon this they were  preparing to cross the water when the Spaniards came upon them.  The  Frenchmen were in such misery that many of them greeted the appearance  of their enemies with joy.  But others were filled with misgiving.  Still they resolved to try to make terms with the Spaniards.  So  first one of his officers, and then Ribaut himself, rowed across  the strip of water to parley with the Spanish leader.  They found  him as pitiless as their companions had found him.  And seeing that  they could make no terms with him many of the Frenchmen refused to  give themselves up, and they marched away.  But after much parleying,  and many comings and goings across the river, Ribaut, believing  that Menendez would spare their lives, yielded up himself and the  rest of his company to the Spaniards.    He was soon undeceived.  For he was led away among the bushes, and  his hands were tied behind his back.  As his followers came over  they, too, were bound and led away.  Then as trumpets blew and drums  beat the Spaniards fell upon their helpless prisoners and slew them  to a man.    When Ribaut saw that his hour was come he did not flinch. \"We are  but dust,\" he said, \"and to dust we must return: twenty years more  or less can matter little.\" So with the words of a psalm upon his  lips he met the swordthrust.    Not till every man lay dead was the fury of the Spaniards sated.  Then, his horrible labour ended, Menendez returned once more in  triumph to his fort.    Those of the French who had refused to give themselves up to Menendez  now wandered back to the shore where their ship had been wrecked.  Out of the broken pieces they tried to build a ship in which they  might sail homeward.  But again news of their doings was brought to  Menendez by the Indians.  And again he set out to crush them.  When  the Frenchmen saw the Spaniards come they fled in terror.  But Menendez  sent a messenger after them promising that if they yielded to him  he would spare their lives.  Most Of them yielded.  And Menendez kept  his promise.  He treated his prisoners well.  But, when an opportunity  arrived, he sent them home to end their lives as galley slaves.    __________            Chapter 10 - How a Frenchman Avenged the Death of His Countrymen          When the news of these terrible massacres reached France it was  greeted with a cry of horror.  Even the boy King, Charles IX, Catholic  though he was, demanded redress.  But the King of Spain declared  that the Frenchmen had been justly served.  The land upon which they  had settled was his, he said, and they had no right to be there.  He was sorry that they were Frenchmen, but they were also pirates  and robbers, and had received only the just reward of their misdeeds.    Neither Charles nor his mother, who was the real ruler in France  at this time, wished to quarrel with the King of Spain.  So finding  that no persuasions would move him, and that instead of being punished  Menendez was praised and rewarded, they let the matter drop.    But there was one man in France who would not thus tamely submit to  the tyranny of Spain.  His name was Dominique de Gourges.  He hated  the Spaniards with a deadly hatred.  And when he heard of the Florida  massacre he vowed to avenge the death of his countrymen.  He sold  all that he had, borrowed what money he could, and with three ships  and a goodly company of soldiers and sailors set sail.    At first, however, he kept, his real object secret.  Instead of  steering straight for Florida he steered southward, making believe  that he was going to Africa for slaves.  But after encountering storms  and contrary winds he turned westward, and when off the coast of  Cuba he gathered all his men together and told them what he had  set out to do.    In vivid, terrible words he recounted to them the horrible slaughter.  \"Shall we let such cruelty go unpunished?\" he asked. \"What fame  for us if we avenge it! To this end I have given my fortune, and  I counted on you to help me.  Was I wrong?\"    \"No,\" they all cried, \"we will go with you to avenge our countrymen!\"    So with hearts filled with thoughts of vengeance they sailed onward  to Fort Caroline.    The Spaniards had repaired the fort and now called it Fort Mateo.  They had also built two small forts nearer the mouth of the river  to guard the entrance to it.  Now one afternoon the men in these  forts saw three ships go sailing by.  These were the French ships  bringing Gourges and his companions.  But the men in the forts  thought that they were Spanish ships and therefore fired a salute.  Gourges did not undeceive them.  He fired a salute in reply and,  sailing on as if he were going elsewhere, was soon lost to sight.    At length, having found a. convenient place out of sight of  the forts, he drew to the shore.  But when he would have landed he  saw that the whole beach was crowded with savages armed with bows  and arrows and ready for war.  For the Indians, too, had taken the  strange ships to be Spanish.  And as they had grown to hate the  Spaniards with a deadly hatred they were prepared to withstand  their landing.    Fortunately, however, Gourges had on board a trumpeter who had been  in Florida with Laudonnière.  So now he sent him on shore to talk  with the Indians.  And as soon as they recognised him they greeted  him with shouts of joy.  Then they led him at once to their chief  who was no other than Satouriona, Laudonnière's one-time friend.    So amid great rejoicings the Frenchmen landed.  Then Satouriona.  poured into their ears the tale of his wrongs.  He told them how the  Spaniards stole their corn, drove them from their huts and their  hunting grounds, and generally ill-treated them. \"Not one peaceful  day,\" he said, \"have the Indians known since the Frenchmen went  away.\"    When Gourges heard this he was well pleased. \"If you have been  ill-treated by the Spaniards,\" he said, \"the French will avenge  you.\"    At this Satouriona, leaped for joy.    \"What!\" he cried, \"will you fight the Spaniards?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Gourges, \"but you must do your part also.\"    \"We will die with you,\" cried Satouriona, \"if need be.\"    \"That is well,\" said Gourges. \"How soon can you be ready? For if  we fight we should fight at once.\"    \"In three days we can be ready,\" said the Indian.    \"See to it then,\" said Gourges, \"that you are secret in the matter  so that the Spaniards suspect nothing.\"    \"Have no fear,\" replied Satouriona; \"we wish them more ill than  you do.\"    The third day came and, true to his word, Satouriona appeared  surrounded by hundreds of warriors, fearful in paint and feathers.  Then some by water, some by land, the French and Indians set  forth, and after many hardships and much toil they reached one of  the forts which the Spaniards had built near the river Is mouth.  From the shelter of the surrounding trees they gazed upon it.    \"There!\" cried Gourges, \"there at last are the thieves who have  stolen this land from our King.  There are the murderers who slew  our countrymen.\"    At his words the men were hardly to be restrained.  In eager whispers  they begged to be led on.  So the word was given, and the Frenchmen  rushed upon the fort.    The Spaniards had just finished their mid-day meal when a cry was  heard from the ramparts. \"To arms! to arms! the French are coming!\"    They were taken quite unawares, and with but short resistance they  fled.  The French and Indians pursued them and hemmed them in so  that not one man escaped.  In like manner the second fort was also  taken, and every man slain or made prisoner.    The next day was Sunday, and Gourges spent it resting, and making  preparations to attack Fort Mateo.

All obstacles were swept away, and the maiden, loving  the hilarity of life, and its gayest scenes of festivity and  splendor, was reluctantly led to the silent, pensive scholar, who  as reluctantly received her as his bride. Hortense had become in  some degree reconciled to the match, as her powerful father promised  to place them in high positions of wealth and rank. Louis resigned  himself to his lot, feeling the earth had no further joy in store  for him. A magnificent fete was given in honor of this marriage,  at which all the splendors of the ancient royalty were revived.  Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, who, as President of the French Republic,  succeeded Louis Philippe, the King of the French, was the only  child of this marriage who survived his parents.    Napoleon had organized in the heart of Italy a republic containing  about five millions of inhabitants. This republic could by no  means maintain itself against the monarchies of Europe, unaided by  France. Napoleon, surrounded by hostile kings, deemed it essential  to the safety of France, to secure in Italy a nation of congenial  sympathies and interests, with whom he could form the alliance of  cordial friendship. The Italians, all inexperienced in self-government,  regarding Napoleon as their benefactor and their sole supporter,  looked to him for a constitution. Three of the most influential  men of the Cisalpine Republic, were sent as delegates to Paris,  to consult with the First Consul upon the organization of their  government. Under the direction of Napoleon a constitution was  drafted, which, considering the character of the Italian people,  and the hostile monarchicals influences which surrounded them, was  most highly liberal. A President was Vice-President were to be  chosen for ten years. There was to be a Senate of eight members  and a House of Representatives of seventy-five members. There were  all to be selected from a body composed of 300 landed proprietors,  200 of the clergy and prominent literary men. Thus all the important  interests of the state were represented.    In Italy, as in all the other countries of Europe at that time, there  were three prominent parties. The Loyalists sought the restoration  of monarchy and the exclusive privileges of kings and nobles. The  Moderate Republicans wished to establish a firm government, which  would enforce order and confer upon all equal rights. The Jacobins  wished to break down all distinctions, divide property, and to  govern by the blind energies of the mob. Italy had long been held  in subjection by the spiritual terrors of the priests and by the  bayonets of the Austrians. Ages of bondage had enervated the people  and there were no Italian statesmen capable of taking the helm of  government in such a turbulent sea of troubles. Napoleon resolved  to have himself proposed as President, and then reserving to  himself the supreme direction, to delegate the details of affairs  to distinguished Italians, until they should, in some degree, be  trained to duties so new to them. Says Theirs. \"This plan was not,  on his part, the inspiration of ambition, but rather of great good  sense. His views on this occasion were unquestionably both pure and  exalted.\" But nothing can more strikingly show the almost miraculous  energies of Napoleon's mind, and his perfect self-reliance, than  the readiness with which, in addition to the cares of the Empire of  France, he assumed the responsibility of organizing and developing  another nation of five millions of inhabitants. This was in 1802.  Napoleon was then but thirty-three years of age.    To have surrendered those Italians, who had rallied around the  armies of France in their hour of need, again to Austrian domination,  would have been an act of treachery. To have abandoned them, in their  inexperience, to the Jacobin mob on the one hand, and to royalist  intrigues on the other, would have insured the ruin of the Republic.  But by leaving the details of government to be administered by  Italians, and at the same time sustaining the constitution by his  own powerful hand, there was a probability that the republic might  attain prosperity and independence. As the press of business rendered  it extremely difficult for Napoleon to leave France, a plan was  formed for a vast congress of the Italians, to be assembled in Lyons,  about half way between Paris and Milan, for the imposing adoption  of the republican constitution. Four hundred and fifty-two deputies  were elected to cross the frozen Alps, in the month of December.  The extraodinary watchfulness and foresight of the First Consul,  had prepared every comfort for them on the way. In Lyons sumptuous  preparations were made for their entertainment. Magnificent halls  were decorated in the highest style of earthly splendor for the  solemnities of the occasion. The army of Egypt, which had recently  landed, bronzed by an African sun was gorgeously attired to add  to the magnificence of the spectacle. The Lyonese youth, exultant  with pride, were formed into an imposing body of cavalry. On the  11th of January, 1802, Napoleon, accompanied by Josephine, arrived in  Lyons. The whole population of the adjoining country had assembled  along the road, anxiously watching for his passage. At night immense  fires illumined his path, blazing upon every hill side and in every  valley. One continuous shout of \"Live Bonaparte,\" rolled along with  the carriage from Paris to Lyons. It was late in the evening when  Napoleon arrived in Lyons. The brilliant city flamed with the  splendor of noon-day. The carriage of the First Consul passed under  a triumphal arch, surmounted by a sleeping lion, the emblem of  France, and Napoleon took up his residence in the Hotel deVille,  which, in most princely sumptuousness had been decorated for  his reception. The Italians adored Napoleon. They felt personally  ennobled by his renown, for they considered him their countryman.  The Italian language was his native tongue, and he spoke it with  the most perfect fluency and elegance. The moment that the name of  Napoleon was suggested to the deputies as President of the Republic,  it was received with shouts of enthusiastic acclamation. A deputation  was immediately send to the First Consul to express the unanimous  and cordial wish of the convention that he would accept the office.  While these things were transpiring, Napoleon, ever intensely  occupied, was inspecting his veteran soldiers of Italy and of Egypt,  in a public review. The elements seemed to conspire to invest the  occasion with splendor. The day was cloudless, the sun brilliant,  the sky serene, the air invigorating. All the inhabitants of Lyons  and the populace of the adjacent country thronged the streets. No  pen can describe the transports with which the hero was received,  as he rode along the lines of these veterans, whom he had so often  led to victory. The soldiers shouted in a frenzy of enthusiasm. Old  men, and young men, and boys caught the shout and it reverberated  along the streets in one continuous roar. Matrons and maidens, waving  banners and handkerchiefs, wept in excess of emotion. Bouquets of  flowers were showered from the windows, to carpet his path, and  every conceivable demonstration was made of the most enthusiastic  love. Napoleon himself was deeply moved by the scene. Some of the  old grenadiers, whom he recognized, he called out of the ranks,  kindly talked with them, inquiring respecting their wounds and their  wants. He addressed several of the officers, whom he had seen in  many encounters, shook hands with them, and a delirium of excitement  pervaded all minds Upon his return to the Hotel deVille, he met  the deputation of the convention. They presented him the address,  urging upon him the acceptance of the Presidency of the Cisalpine  Republic. Napoleon received the address, intimated his acceptance,  and promised, on the following day, to meet the convention.    The next morning dawned brightly upon the city. A large church,  embellished with richest drapery, was prepared for the solemnities  of the occasion. Napoleon entered the church, took his seat upon an  elevated platform, surrounded by his family, the French ministers,  and a large number of distinguished generals and statesmen. He  addressed the assembly in the Italian language, with as much ease  of manner, elegance of expression, and fluency of utterance as if  his whole life had been devoted to the cultivation of the powers  of oratory. He announced his acceptance of the dignity with which  they would invest him and uttered his views respecting the measures  which he adopted to secure the prosperity of the Italian Republic  , as the new state was henceforth to be called. Repeated bursts of  applause interrupted his address, and at its close one continuous  shout of acclamation testified the assent and the delight of  the assembled multitude. Napoleon remained at Lyons twenty days,  occupied, apparently every moment, with the vast affairs which  then engrossed his attention. And yet he found time to write  daily to Paris, urging forward the majestic enterprises of the new  government in France. The following brief extracts from this free  and confidential correspondence, afford an interesting glimpse of  the motives which actuated Napoleon at this time, and of the great  objects of his ambition.    \"I am proceeding slowly in my operations. I pass the whole of my  mornings in giving audience to the deputations of the neighboring  departments. The improvement in the happiness of France is obvious.  During the past two years the population of Lyons has increased  more than 20,000 souls. All the manufacturers tell me that their  works are in a state of high activity. All minds seem to be full  of energy, not that energy which overturns empires, but that which  re-establishes them, and conducts them to prosperity and riches.\"    \"I beg of you"]]]
