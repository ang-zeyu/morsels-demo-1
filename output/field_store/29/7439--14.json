Mus., 205:513, March 3, 1955 (part); Hall and Kelson, The Mammals of         North America, 2:661, March 31, 1959 (part).    _Type._--Adult female, skin and skull; No. 71605 University of Kansas  Museum of Natural History; 8 mi. S Condega, Esteli, Nicaragua, obtained  on July 15, 1956, by A. A. Alcorn, original number 4218.    _Range._--West-central Nicaragua, from Matagalpa northwest into the  valley of the Rio Esteli, east as far as Jinotega, see Figure 10. Zonal  range: Upper Tropical Life-zone.    _Diagnosis._--Size medium to small for the species; dorsum  Fuscous-Black, individual hairs black-tipped with a subterminal band of  Ochraceous-Buff, Neutral Gray at base; some hairs on dorsum all black to  Neutral Gray at base; hair on sides Neutral Gray tinged with blackish;  face blackish, becoming buffy on sides of head, and white on throat;  vibrissae black; tail unicolored Chaetura Black; forefeet and hind feet  sooty to dusky-white; mid-ventral region of venter white, hairs white to  base; in region of anus and throat, hairs white-tipped, Neutral Gray at  base; average and extreme external and cranial measurements of the type  and 16 paratypes are as follows: total length, 117.3 (111-121); length  of tail vertebrae, 47.2 (44-50); length of body, 70.4 (66-74); length of  hind foot, 15.5 (14-17); length of ear from notch, 11.9 (10-13);  occipitonasal length, 19.3 (18.9-19.8); zygomatic breadth, 10.2  (9.7-10.6); postpalatal length, 7.0 (6.8-7.3); least interorbital  breadth, 3.9 (3.8-4.1); length of incisive foramina, 4.3 (4.0-4.6);  length of rostrum, 7.0 (6.5-7.4); breadth of braincase, 9.6 (9.3-10.0);  depth of cranium, 7.0 (6.8-7.3); alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row,  3.1 (3.0-3.2); for photographs of skull, see Plate 1_h_, and Plate 3_h_.    _Comparisons._--From _B. m. grisescens_, _B. m. pullus_ differs in:  dorsum and tail darker; sides and lateral parts of venter grayish  instead of buffy-brown, thus forming distinct mid-ventral white stripe;  average length of body and tail significantly longer, thus total length  greater; maxillary tooth-row significantly shorter; slightly larger in  other cranial and external dimensions.    From _B. m. nigrescens_, _B. m. pullus_ differs in: dorsum slightly  darker; face grayish, not sooty; mid-ventral white stripe (absent in  most specimens of _nigrescens_) present and becoming grayish laterally;  tail darker, less hairy, and averaging significantly longer; smaller in  most external and cranial dimensions.    _Remarks._--_B. m. pullus_ resembles _B. m. nigrescens_ in size and  color but can readily be distinguished from _nigrescens_ by the shorter  tail. _B. m. pullus_ intergrades with _nigrescens_ as shown by  specimens, referable to _B. m. nigrescens_, from 1 mi. NW San Salvador  and from 1 mi. S Los Planes, El Salvador. In color of the dorsum,  specimens from these localities are intermediate between _nigrescens_  and _pullus_.    The mid-ventral white stripe characteristic of _pullus_ is present in  three of 28 adults from El Salvador. Goodwin (1942:160) reported white  hairs on the pectoral region of several topotypes of _B. m. grisescens_.  The areas of white hairs on the venter of _grisescens_ occur in  approximately 10 per cent of the specimens examined, whereas in  _pullus_, the frequency of occurrence is 90 per cent. The areas of white  hairs in _grisescens_ are in broad patches on the pectoral region, while  in _pullus_, a white stripe passes from the pectoral region to the  inguinal region in both males and females. I know of no selective  advantage that the presence of this white stripe would confer on the  mice.    _Specimens examined._--Total 46, all from NICARAGUA, and distributed as  follows: Type locality, 32 (including the type); _9 mi. NNW Esteli_, 8;  _8 mi. NNW Esteli_, 3; San Rafael Del Norte, 1 (Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.);  _1 mi. NW Jinotega_, 1; Matagalpa, 1 (Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.).    _Marginal records._--NICARAGUA: San Rafael Del Norte; Matagalpa; type  locality.      =Baiomys taylori=    Northern Pygmy Mouse    (Synonymy under subspecies)    _Type._--_Hesperomys_ (_Vesperimus_) _taylori_ Thomas, Ann. Mag. Nat.  Hist., Ser. 5, 19:66, January, 1887.    _Range._--Southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico, south into  Chihuahua and Durango, just east of the Sierra Madre Occidental, thence  southeast through Zacatecas, Aquascalientes, Jalisco, Queretaro, and  Guanajuato; two fingerlike projections extend northward, one on the west  along the coast of Sinaloa into southern Sonora, and the other on the  east covering eastern San Luis Potosi, Tamaulipas, eastern Coahuila,  Nuevo Leon, into south, southeast, and north-central Texas. Southern  margin of range in central Mexico approximates the 19th degree of  latitude (see Figure 11). Arid lower and arid upper subdivisions of the  Tropical Life-zone in south; principally Lower Sonoran and Lower Austral  life-zones in north.    _Characters for ready recognition._--Unless otherwise noted, characters  are usable for the age-categories of adult and old adult. Differs from  _B. musculus_ in: hind foot less than 16 millimeters; occipitonasal  length less than 19 millimeters; zygomatic breadth less than 10  millimeters; rostrum deflected ventrally at frontoparietal suture rather  than curving gradually toward anteriormost point of nasals; cingular  ridges and secondary cusps on teeth reduced or absent; basihyal having  entoglossal process much reduced or absent, shoulders of basihyal not  protruding anteriorly, but more flattened (characteristic of all age  categories); baculum having narrower shaft, knob-shaped tip, wings at  base projecting laterally, baculum less than 3 millimeters long; short  process of incus attenuate; muscular process of posterior crus of stapes  reduced.    _Characters of the species._--Size small (extremes in external  measurements of adults: total length, 87-123; length of tail vertebrae,  34-53; length of hind foot, 12-15; length of ear, 9-12). Upper parts  pale drab or reddish-brown to almost black; underparts grayish to  cream-buff.    _Geographic variation._--Eight subspecies are here recognized (see  Figure 11). Features that vary geographically are mostly the same as  those that do so in _B. musculus_ (see page 609).    External and cranial size is less in _B. t. allex_, the southernmost  subspecies, and progressively more in _B. t. paulus_, _B. t. taylori_,  _B. t. ater_, _B. t. subater_, _B. t. fuliginatus_, _B. t. canutus_, and  _B. t. analogous_. Size is largest in subspecies that occur at higher  altitudes. Those subspecies are _B. t. analogous_ and _B. t.  fuliginatus_. The correlation with Bergman's Rule is less exact in _B.  taylori_ than in _B. musculus_. It is noteworthy that the smallest  subspecies, _B. t. allex_, occurs in the area where the two species are  sympatric.    There is close correlation in _B. taylori_, as also in _B. musculus_, of  darker pelages with zones of high relative humidity. The subspecies  having dark pelages are:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38308"],[0,"Natural History of Cottonmouth Moccasin, Agkistrodon piscovorus (Reptilia) (#14)"],[1,"ssible. The ligature should  be loosened at least every fifteen minutes. The next steps are  sterilization of the skin and the making of an incision through the fang  punctures. As pointed out by Stahnke (1954:8), the incision should be  made in line with the snake's body at the time of the bite, so as to  account for the rearward curvature of the fangs and possibly to reach  the deposition of venom. Many instruction booklets and first-aid guides  have specified the length and depth of incision to be made, but the  actual size and depth of the cut should depend upon the location of the  bite. An \"X\" cut or connection of the fang punctures is likely to  facilitate the spread of the venom. No cut should be made that would  sever a large blood vessel or ligament.    Extensive damage is often caused by well-meaning individuals whose  attempts at first aid result in brutally deep incisions and tourniquets  applied too tightly and for too long a period of time; the resultant  damage in many instances exceeds that of the bite itself (Stimson and  Engelhardt, 1960:165). Stimson and Engelhardt also think that time  should be sacrificed to surgical cleanliness, and incisions should not  be made if a hospital can be reached within an hour.    The ligature-cryotherapy (L-C) method proposed by Stahnke (1953) has  been severely criticized by other workers. He stated that the ligature  should be tight enough to restrict completely the flow of venom until  the temperature of the area can be lowered sufficiently to prevent any  action of the venom. After 10 minutes the ligature may be removed and  the bitten area kept immersed in a vessel of crushed ice and water. If  the envenomized member is to be treated for more than four hours (which  is the case with almost all pit-viper bites), it should be protected by  placing it in a plastic bag. The venom action should be tested after 12  or more hours. This consists of a brief warming period to determine  whether or not the action of the venom can be felt. The patient should  be kept warm at all times; and the warming at the termination of  treatment should be done gradually, preferably by allowing the water to  warm slowly to room temperature.    Advocates of the L-C method warn against making incisions unless they  are absolutely necessary, the theory being that each cut permits  additional bacterial infection and does little good in removing venom.  However, McCollough and Gennaro (1963:963) demonstrated that, in bites  where the fangs had only slightly penetrated the skin, more than 50 per  cent of the venom was removed in some instances if suction was started  within three minutes after the injection. With deeper injection the  amount of venom recovered sometimes reached 20 per cent of the dose.  Stahnke suggested that an incision be made at the site of the bite only  after the site has been refrigerated for at least 30 minutes.    Stimson and Engelhardt (_loc. cit._) stated that two constricting bands  should be used between the bite and the body and that cracked ice in a  cloth should be applied to the bite before reaching a hospital. In  addition, they suggested the following procedure. Rings of incisions  should follow the swelling, and suction should continue for several  hours. After the edema has receded, the limb should be wrapped in a  towel containing crushed ice. Antivenin should be given only in severe  cases. Calcium gluconate and gas gangrene antitoxin as well as  antibiotics are helpful.    The most recent and up-to-date summary of snakebite treatment is that by  McCollough and Gennaro (1963). Following is a brief summary of their  suggestions:         1. Immobilization--Systemic immobilization is effected by body       rest and locally by splinting the bitten area.         2. Tourniquet--A lightly occlusive tourniquet during a 30- to       60-minute period of incision and suction would seem to possess       some advantages. In severe cases where medical attention is       hours away, a completely occlusive tourniquet may be necessary       to prevent death. Sacrifice of the extremity may be necessary       for the preservation of life.         3. Incision and suction--Suction should begin three to five       minutes after injection of venom if symptoms of poisoning are       present. Incisions one-fourth inch to an inch long across each       fang mark should be made in order to open the wound for more       efficient suction. Multiple incisions are not useful for the       removal of venom but may be employed under hospital conditions       to reduce subcutaneous tensions and ischemia.         4. Cryotherapy--An ice cap over the site of the bite for relief       of pain would seem to be permissible, especially prior to the       administration of antivenin. It must be remembered that cooling       during the administration of the antivenin radically reduces       the access of the antiserum to the bite area.         5. Antivenin--Antiserum is the keystone to the therapy of       snakebite. Careful evaluation of the severity of the bite and       the patient's sensitivity should be made before the use of       antivenin. In Grade II (moderate) bites, the intramuscular       injection on the side of the bite may suffice. In Grades III       (severe) and IV (very severe), shock and systemic effects       require intravenous injection. In bites producing symptoms of       this severity, antivenin must be given in amounts large enough       to produce clinical improvement. Ten to 20 units may be       necessary to prevent the relapse that sometimes occurs after       small doses of antivenin. Permanent remission of swelling and       interruption of necrosis are the therapeutic end point in the       clinical use of the antiserum.    In all cases of snakebite where there is any doubt as to the snake's  identity, it should be killed if possible and taken to the hospital for  positive identification. In many instances of actual bites by poisonous  snakes the only treatment needed was an injection of tetanus antitoxin  or toxoid and sedation, because physical examination revealed no  indication of poisoning (Stimson and Engelhardt, _loc. cit._).      Case History of a Bite    On July 29, 1963, at 8:20 a.m., I was treating a nine-month-old  cottonmouth for mites. As I dropped the snake into a sink, it twisted  its head and bit the tip of my right middle finger with one fang. The  fang entered just under the fingernail and was directed downward, the  venom being injected about five millimeters below the site of fang  penetration. After placing the snake back in its cage, I squeezed the  finger once to promote bleeding, wrapped a string around the base of the  finger, and drove to Watkins Memorial Hospital on the University of  Kansas campus. I began to feel a burning sensation in the tip of the  finger almost immediately. Upon my arrival at the hospital, an  additional ligature was placed around my wrist. At 8:30 a.m. a small  incision was made in the end of the finger, which by this time was  beginning to darken at the point of venom deposition. I sucked on the  finger until 8:35 a.m., when a pan of ice water that I had requested was  brought to me. No pain was felt except that caused by the ice. Fresh ice  was added as needed to keep the temperature low. By 9:30 a.m. the  finger had swollen and stiffened. At 10:00 a.m. the swelling had  progressed to the index finger and back of the hand. I experienced  difficulty in opening and closing the hand. Blood oozed slowly from the  incision. A dull ache persisted and about every two to four minutes a  sharp throb could be felt until nearly 11:00 a.m., when the pain  diminished. The rate and intensity of throbbing increased whenever the  hand was removed from the ice bath for more than a few seconds. Although  only the hand was immersed, the entire forearm was cold. Pain was felt  along the lymphatics on top of the arm when it was touched, and by 1:00  p.m. a slight pain could be felt in the armpit. Since swelling and pain  were almost nonexistent by 2:00 p.m., I was permitted to leave. After  walking to a nearby building, I again felt a burning sensation as the  hand warmed. I made another ice bath and again immersed the hand in it  until 4:10 p.m., at which time it was removed from the water. The pain  and swelling began anew, and the hand was placed back in an ice bath  from 5:30 p.m. until about 7:30 p.m. At this time cryotherapy was  discontinued. From 10:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight my legs twitched  periodically, and pain could be felt in both armpits. A slight  difficulty in breathing also was experienced for a short time. The acute  pain and burning sensation remained in the finger until the following  morning, but swelling progressed only as far as the wrist. The only  discomfort that day was in the finger. The tip was darkened, the entire  first digit red and feverish, and the lymphatics still painful when  touched. By the third day the swelling had regressed. The incision  itself was the main cause of discomfort, and the soreness at the site of  the bite persisted for at least four days.    Although the L-C method of snakebite treatment has been vigorously  attacked by many, there is still need of much more data before it  can be unequivocally condemned or praised. It was preferred in the  treatment of this bite because: I knew that envenomation was minimal  and that there would be no need for antivenin; only one fang of a  snake less than one foot long had entered the tip of the finger; the  snake had bitten three frogs in the previous two days and had  possibly used up a considerable amount of its venom; the venom was  deposited at such a shallow depth that at least a portion of it  could be removed by suction; and the wound bled freely even before  suction was applied. The ice water was uncomfortably cold but was  not cold enough to cause frostbite, a major objection to the L-C  method. Ideally, fresh ice should "]]]
