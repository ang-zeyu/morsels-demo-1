It is needless to add that Munson's Hill was so safe as  not to disturb our profound slumbers. This was before the Federals began  to realize all of their advantages by floating balloons above our heads.    One of the most conspicuous and successful of our affairs occurred on the  11th of September. A brigade of the enemy's infantry, with eight pieces of  artillery and a detachment of cavalry, escorting a reconnoitring party,  advanced to Lewinsville. If they had secured and fortified a position  there they would have greatly annoyed us. Colonel Stuart, who from the  start had manifested those qualities of daring courage, tempered by  sagacity, which so admirably fitted him for outpost service, had his  pickets so far to the front that he was promptly informed of the presence  of the enemy. He was ordered, with about eight hundred infantry, a section  of Rosser's battery, and Captain Patrick's troop of cavalry, to give  battle, and so adroitly approached the enemy as to surprise him, and by a  bold dash drove him off in confusion, with some loss.    We had a number of small affairs which served to season the troops and  teach the importance of discipline and vigilance. It was while at Falls  Church that Major-General G. W. Smith reported for duty with the Army of  Northern Virginia, and was associated with General Johnston and General  Beauregard, the three forming a council for the general direction of the  operations of the army. General McClellan had by this time been appointed  to superior command on the Federal side.      [Illustration: GENERAL J. E. B. STUART]      Despairing of receiving reinforcement to enable him to assume the  offensive, General Johnston regarded it as hazardous to hold longer the  advanced post of Munson's and Mason's Hills, drew the troops back to and  near Fairfax Court-House, and later, about the 19th of October, still  farther to Centreville, and prepared for winter quarters by strengthening  his positions and constructing huts, the line extending to Union Mills on  the right. These points were regarded as stronger in themselves and less  liable to be turned than the positions at and in advance of Fairfax  Court-House. We expected that McClellan would advance against us, but were  not disturbed. I was promoted major-general, which relieved me of the  outpost service, to which Colonel Stuart was assigned.    The autumn and early winter were not permitted to pass without some  stirring incidents in our front. Soon after the battle of July 21, Colonel  Eppa Hunton was ordered to reoccupy Leesburg with his regiment, the Eighth  Virginia. Later, the Thirteenth, Seventeenth, and Eighteenth Mississippi  Regiments were sent to the same vicinity, and with the regiment already  there and a battery constituted the Seventh Brigade, Brigadier-General N.  G. Evans commanding. To cover a reconnoissance and an expedition to gather  supplies made by General McCall's division to Dranesville, General  McClellan ordered General C. P. Stone, commanding at Poolesville,  Maryland, to make a demonstration in force against Leesburg, and, if  practicable, to dislodge the Confederates at that place. Early in the  morning of the 21st of October four of General Stone's regiments crossed  the Potomac at Edwards's Ferry, and about the same time five other  regiments, under the immediate command of Colonel Baker, late United  States Senator from Oregon, crossed the river above at Ball's Bluff.  Leaving Colonel Barksdale with his Thirteenth Mississippi, with six pieces  of artillery as a reserve, to hold in check the force that had crossed at  Edwards's Ferry, Evans with his main force assailed the force under  Colonel Baker, and after a long and fierce struggle, under a heavy fire of  batteries on both sides of the river, drove them down the bluff to the  river, many surrendering, others plunging into the river to recross,  overcrowding and sinking the boats that had brought them over; some  drowning in the Potomac.    Two months later, December 20, there was an affair at Dranesville which  for us was by no means so satisfactory as Evans's at Leesburg and Ball's  Bluff. It was known that food for men and horses could be found in the  vicinity of Dranesville. All of the available wagons of the army were sent  to gather and bring it in, and Colonel Stuart, with one hundred and fifty  of his cavalry, the Sumter Flying Artillery (Captain A. S. Cutts), and  four regiments of infantry detailed from different brigades, was charged  with the command of the foraging party. The infantry regiments were the  Eleventh Virginia, Colonel Samuel Garland; Tenth Alabama, Colonel Forney;  Sixth South Carolina, Lieutenant-Colonel Secrest; and First Kentucky,  Colonel Thomas Taylor; the cavalry, Ransom's and Bradford's.    General McCall, commanding the nearest Union division, happened just then  to want those supplies, or, as seems more probable, had information  through a spy of Stuart's expedition.    He took measures to gather the supplies, or surprise and perhaps capture  or destroy Stuart's party. However that may be, when Stuart reached the  vicinity of Dranesville he found himself in the presence of General Ord,  who had under him his own brigade of five regiments of infantry, Easton's  battery, two twenty-four-pound howitzers and two twelve-pound guns, and  two squadrons of cavalry. Finding that he was anticipated, and that his  only way of saving the train was to order it back to Centreville in all  haste, Stuart decided to attack, in order to give it time to get to a  place of safety, and despatched a detachment of cavalry on the turnpike  towards Leesburg to warn the wagons to hasten back to Centreville, the  cavalry to march between them and the enemy. He ordered his artillery and  infantry to hasten to the front, and as soon as they came up assailed the  enemy vigorously, continuing the engagement until he judged that his  wagon-train had passed beyond danger; then he extricated his infantry and  artillery from the contest, with a much heavier loss than he had inflicted  on the enemy, leaving the killed and some of the wounded. It was the first  success that had attended the Union arms in that quarter, and was  magnified and enjoyed on that side. This action advanced McClellan  considerably in popular estimation and led to the bestowal upon him, by  some enthusiast, of the sobriquet \"the Young Napoleon.\"    During the autumn and early winter the weather had been unusually fine.  The roads and fields in that section were generally firm and in fine  condition for marching and manoeuvring armies. With the beginning of the  new year winter set in with rain and snow, alternate freezing and thawing,  until the roads and fields became seas of red mud.    As no effort of general advance was made during the season of firm roads,  we had little apprehension of trouble after the winter rains came to make  them too heavy for artillery service.          CHAPTER V.    ROUND ABOUT RICHMOND.        The Defences of the Confederate Capital--Army of Northern Virginia at      Centreville--Aggressive Action--Council with the President and      Secretary of War--Mr. Davis's High Opinion of McClellan--Operations on      the Peninsula--Engagements about Yorktown and Williamsburg--Severe      Toil added to the Soldiers' Usual Labors by a Saturated Soil.      Apropos of the attack upon Richmond, apprehended in the winter of 1861-62,  it should be borne in mind that there were four routes supposed to be  practicable for the advance of the enemy:    1. The original route by Manassas Junction and the Orange and Alexandria  Railroad.    2. By crossing the Potomac near Potomac Creek, thence by Fredericksburg to  Richmond.    3. By land,--the shortest,--to go down the Potomac to the Lower  Rappahannock, landing at or near Urbana, and thence march for the  Confederate capital.    4. By transports to Fortress Monroe, thence by the Peninsula, between the  James and York Rivers.    General McClellan's long delay to march against General Johnston, when he  was so near and accessible at Centreville, indicated that he had no  serious thought of advancing by that route. To prepare to meet him on  either of the other routes, a line behind the Rapidan was the chosen  position.    General Beauregard had been relieved of duty in Virginia and ordered West  with General A. S. Johnston.    The withdrawal from Centreville was delayed some weeks, waiting for roads  that could be travelled, but was started on the 9th of March, 1862, and on  the 11th the troops were south of the Rappahannock.    General Whiting's command from Occoquan joined General Holmes at  Fredericksburg. Generals Ewell and Early crossed by the railroad bridge  and took positions near it. General G. W. Smith's division and mine  marched by the turnpike to near Culpeper Court-House. General Stuart, with  the cavalry, remained on Bull Run until the 10th, then withdrew to  Warrenton Junction.    During the last week of March our scouts on the Potomac reported a large  number of steamers, loaded with troops, carrying, it was estimated, about  one hundred and forty thousand men, passing down and out of the Potomac,  destined, it was supposed, for Fortress Monroe, or possibly for the coast  of North Carolina. We were not left long in doubt. By the 4th of April,  McClellan had concentrated three _corps d'armee_ between Fortress Monroe  and Newport News, on the James River. The Confederate left crossed the  Rapidan, and from Orange Court-House made connection with the troops on  the Rappahannock at Fredericksburg. About the 1st of April, Generals  Johnston and G. W. Smith were called to Richmond for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38440"],[0,"A Distributional Study of the Amphibians of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, México (#14)"],[1,"phylogenetic       relationships.
