While she sung, Valancourt approached, who was unwilling to interrupt  her, and paused at a little distance to listen. When she had concluded,  he joined the party, and told them, that he had found Michael, as  well as a way, by which he thought they could ascend the cliff to  the carriage. He pointed to the woody steeps above, which St. Aubert  surveyed with an anxious eye. He was already wearied by his walk, and  this ascent was formidable to him. He thought, however, it would be less  toilsome than the long and broken road, and he determined to attempt it;  but Emily, ever watchful of his ease, proposing that he should rest, and  dine before they proceeded further, Valancourt went to the carriage for  the refreshments deposited there.    On his return, he proposed removing a little higher up the mountain, to  where the woods opened upon a grand and extensive prospect; and  thither they were preparing to go, when they saw a young woman join the  children, and caress and weep over them.    The travellers, interested by her distress, stopped to observe her.  She took the youngest of the children in her arms, and, perceiving the  strangers, hastily dried her tears, and proceeded to the cottage.  St. Aubert, on enquiring the occasion of her sorrow, learned that her  husband, who was a shepherd, and lived here in the summer months to  watch over the flocks he led to feed upon these mountains, had lost, on  the preceding night, his little all. A gang of gipsies, who had for some  time infested the neighbourhood, had driven away several of his master's  sheep. 'Jacques,' added the shepherd's wife, 'had saved a little money,  and had bought a few sheep with it, and now they must go to his master  for those that are stolen; and what is worse than all, his master, when  he comes to know how it is, will trust him no longer with the care of  his flocks, for he is a hard man! and then what is to become of our  children!'    The innocent countenance of the woman, and the simplicity of her manner  in relating her grievance, inclined St. Aubert to believe her story; and  Valancourt, convinced that it was true, asked eagerly what was the value  of the stolen sheep; on hearing which he turned away with a look of  disappointment. St. Aubert put some money into her hand, Emily too gave  something from her little purse, and they walked towards the cliff; but  Valancourt lingered behind, and spoke to the shepherd's wife, who was  now weeping with gratitude and surprise. He enquired how much money was  yet wanting to replace the stolen sheep, and found, that it was a  sum very little short of all he had about him. He was perplexed and  distressed. 'This sum then,' said he to himself, 'would make this poor  family completely happy--it is in my power to give it--to make them  completely happy! But what is to become of me?--how shall I contrive  to reach home with the little money that will remain?' For a moment he  stood, unwilling to forego the luxury of raising a family from ruin to  happiness, yet considering the difficulties of pursuing his journey with  so small a sum as would be left.    While he was in this state of perplexity, the shepherd himself appeared:  his children ran to meet him; he took one of them in his arms, and, with  the other clinging to his coat, came forward with a loitering step. His  forlorn and melancholy look determined Valancourt at once; he threw down  all the money he had, except a very few louis, and bounded away  after St. Aubert and Emily, who were proceeding slowly up the steep.  Valancourt had seldom felt his heart so light as at this moment; his  gay spirits danced with pleasure; every object around him appeared more  interesting, or beautiful, than before. St. Aubert observed the uncommon  vivacity of his countenance: 'What has pleased you so much?' said he.  'O what a lovely day,' replied Valancourt, 'how brightly the sun  shines, how pure is this air, what enchanting scenery!' 'It is indeed  enchanting,' said St. Aubert, whom early experience had taught to  understand the nature of Valancourt's present feelings. 'What pity that  the wealthy, who can command such sunshine, should ever pass their days  in gloom--in the cold shade of selfishness! For you, my young friend,  may the sun always shine as brightly as at this moment; may your own  conduct always give you the sunshine of benevolence and reason united!'    Valancourt, highly flattered by this compliment, could make no reply but  by a smile of gratitude.    They continued to wind under the woods, between the grassy knolls of the  mountain, and, as they reached the shady summit, which he had pointed  out, the whole party burst into an exclamation. Behind the spot  where they stood, the rock rose perpendicularly in a massy wall to a  considerable height, and then branched out into overhanging crags. Their  grey tints were well contrasted by the bright hues of the plants and  wild flowers, that grew in their fractured sides, and were deepened by  the gloom of the pines and cedars, that waved above. The steeps below,  over which the eye passed abruptly to the valley, were fringed with  thickets of alpine shrubs; and, lower still, appeared the tufted tops of  the chesnut woods, that clothed their base, among which peeped forth the  shepherd's cottage, just left by the travellers, with its blueish smoke  curling high in the air. On every side appeared the majestic summits  of the Pyrenees, some exhibiting tremendous crags of marble, whose  appearance was changing every instant, as the varying lights fell upon  their surface; others, still higher, displaying only snowy points, while  their lower steeps were covered almost invariably with forests of pine,  larch, and oak, that stretched down to the vale. This was one of  the narrow vallies, that open from the Pyrenees into the country of  Rousillon, and whose green pastures, and cultivated beauty, form a  decided and wonderful contrast to the romantic grandeur that environs  it. Through a vista of the mountains appeared the lowlands of Rousillon,  tinted with the blue haze of distance, as they united with the waters of  the Mediterranean; where, on a promontory, which marked the boundary of  the shore, stood a lonely beacon, over which were seen circling flights  of sea-fowl. Beyond, appeared, now and then, a stealing sail, white with  the sun-beam, and whose progress was perceivable by its approach to the  light-house. Sometimes, too, was seen a sail so distant, that it served  only to mark the line of separation between the sky and the waves.    On the other side of the valley, immediately opposite to the spot where  the travellers rested, a rocky pass opened toward Gascony. Here no sign  of cultivation appeared. The rocks of granite, that screened the glen,  rose abruptly from their base, and stretched their barren points to the  clouds, unvaried with woods, and uncheered even by a hunter's cabin.  Sometimes, indeed, a gigantic larch threw its long shade over the  precipice, and here and there a cliff reared on its brow a monumental  cross, to tell the traveller the fate of him who had ventured thither  before. This spot seemed the very haunt of banditti; and Emily, as she  looked down upon it, almost expected to see them stealing out from  some hollow cave to look for their prey. Soon after an object not less  terrific struck her,--a gibbet standing on a point of rock near the  entrance of the pass, and immediately over one of the crosses she had  before observed. These were hieroglyphics that told a plain and dreadful  story. She forbore to point it out to St. Aubert, but it threw a gloom  over her spirits, and made her anxious to hasten forward, that  they might with certainty reach Rousillon before night-fall. It was  necessary, however, that St. Aubert should take some refreshment, and,  seating themselves on the short dry turf, they opened the basket of  provisions, while         by breezy murmurs cool'd,   Broad o'er THEIR heads the verdant cedars wave,   And high palmetos lift their graceful shade.   -----THEY draw   Ethereal soul, there drink reviving gales   Profusely breathing from the piney groves,   And vales of fragrance; there at a distance hear   The roaring floods, and cataracts.*       *Thomson      St. Aubert was revived by rest, and by the serene air of this summit;  and Valancourt was so charmed with all around, and with the conversation  of his companions, that he seemed to have forgotten he had any further  to go. Having concluded their simple repast, they gave a long farewell  look to the scene, and again began to ascend. St. Aubert rejoiced when  he reached the carriage, which Emily entered with him; but Valancourt,  willing to take a more extensive view of the enchanting country, into  which they were about to descend, than he could do from a carriage,  loosened his dogs, and once more bounded with them along the banks of  the road. He often quitted it for points that promised a wider prospect,  and the slow pace, at which the mules travelled, allowed him to overtake  them with ease. Whenever a scene of uncommon magnificence appeared, he  hastened to inform St. Aubert, who, though he was too much tired to  walk himself, sometimes made the chaise wait, while Emily went to the  neighbouring cliff.    It was evening when they descended the lower alps, that bind Rousillon,  and form a majestic barrier round that charming country, leaving it open  only on the east to the Mediterranean. The gay tints of cultivation once  more beautified the landscape; for the lowlands were coloured with the  richest hues, which a luxuriant climate, and an industrious people can  awaken into life. Groves of orange and lemon perfumed the air, their  ripe fruit glowing among the foliage; while, sloping to the plains,  extensive vineyards spread their treasures. Beyond these, woods and  pastures, and mingled towns and hamlets stretched towards the sea,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32706"],[0,"Triplanetary (#14)"],[1," not liked, but he was respected. His building was good.    Being one of the only two \"old\" men there--and the other did not stay  long--Kinnison, as a Junior Chemical Engineer, was not at first accepted  without reserve. Apparently he did not notice that fact, but went  quietly about his assigned duties. He was meticulously careful with, but  very evidently not in any fear of, the materials with which he worked.  He pelleted and tested tracer, igniter, and incendiary compositions; he  took his turn at burning out rejects. Whenever asked, he went out on the  lines with any one of them.    His experimental tetryls always \"miked\" to size, his TNT  melt-pours--introductory to loading forty-millimeter on the Three  Line--came out solid, free from checks and cavitations. It became  evident to those young but keen minds that he, alone of them all, was on  familiar ground. They began to discuss their problems with him. Out of  his years of technological experience, and by bringing everyone present  into the discussion, he either helped them directly or helped them to  help themselves. His stature grew.    Black-haired, black-eyed \"Tug\" Tugwell, two hundred pounds of  ex-football-player in charge of tracer on the Seven Line, called him  \"Uncle\" Ralph, and the habit spread. And in a couple of weeks--at about  the same time that \"Injun\" Abernathy was slightly injured by being blown  through a door by a minor explosion of his igniter on the Eight line--he  was promoted to full Chemical Engineer; a promotion which went  unnoticed, since it involved only changes in title and salary.    Three weeks later, however, he was made Senior Chemical Engineer, in  charge of Melt-Pour. At this there was a celebration, led by \"Blondie\"  Wanacek, a sulphuric-acid expert handling tetryl on the Two. Kinnison  searched minutely for signs of jealousy or antagonism, but could find  none. He went blithely to work on the Six line, where they wanted to  start pouring twenty-pound fragmentation bombs, ably assisted by Tug and  by two new men. One of these was \"Doc\" or \"Bart\" Barton, who, the  grapevine said, had been hired by Cappy to be his Assistant. His motto,  like that of Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, was to run and find out, and he did so  with glee and abandon. He was a good egg. So was the other newcomer,  \"Charley\" Charlevoix, a prematurely gray paint-and-lacquer expert who  had also made the Siberian grade.    A few months later, Sumner called Kinnison into the office. The latter  went, wondering what the old hard-shell was going to cry about now; for  to be called into that office meant only one thing--censure.    \"Kinnison, I like your work,\" the Chief Chemist began, gruffly, and  Kinnison's mouth almost dropped open. \"Anybody who ever got a Ph.D.  under Montrose would have to know explosives, and the F.B.I. report on  you showed that you had brains, ability, and guts. But none of that  explains how you can get along so well with those damned Siberians. I  want to make you Assistant Chief and put you in charge of Siberia.  Formally, I mean--actually, you have been for months.\"    \"Why, no ... I didn't.... Besides, how about Barton? He's too good a man  to kick in the teeth that way.\"    \"Admitted.\" This _did_ surprise Kinnison. He had never thought that the  irascible and tempestuous Chief would ever confess to a mistake. This  was a Cappy he had never known. \"I discussed it with him yesterday. He's  a damned good man--but it's decidedly questionable whether he has got  whatever it is that made Tugwell, Wanacek and Charlevoix work straight  through for seventy two hours, napping now and then on benches and  grabbing coffee and sandwiches when they could, until they got that frag  bomb straightened out.\"    Sumner did not mention the fact that Kinnison had worked straight  through, too. That was taken for granted.    \"Well, I don't know.\" Kinnison's head was spinning. \"I'd like to check  with Barton first. O.K.?\"    \"I expected that. O.K.\"    Kinnison found Barton and led him out behind the testing shed.    \"Bart, Cappy tells me that he figures on kicking you in the face by  making me Assistant and that you O.K.'d it. One word and I'll tell the  old buzzard just where to stick the job and exactly where to go to do  it.\"    \"Reaction, perfect. Yield, one hundred percent.\" Barton stuck out his  hand. \"Otherwise, I would tell him all that myself and more. As it is,  Uncle Ralph, smooth out the ruffled plumage. They'd go to hell for you,  wading in standing straight up--they might do the same with me in the  driver's seat, and they might not. Why take a chance? You're IT. Some  things about the deal I don't like, of course--but at that, it makes me  about the only man working for Stoner and Black who can get a release  any time a good permanent job breaks. I'll stick until then. O.K.?\" It  was unnecessary for Barton to add that as long as he was there he would  really work.    \"I'll say it's O.K.!\" and Kinnison reported to Sumner.    \"All right, Chief, I'll try it--if you can square it with the  Siberians.\"    \"That will not be too difficult.\"    Nor was it. The Siberians' reaction brought a lump to Kinnison's throat.    \"Ralph the First, Czar of Siberia!\" they yelled. \"Long live the Czar!  Kowtow, serfs and vassals, to Czar Ralph the First!\"    Kinnison was still glowing when he got home that night, to the  Government Housing Project and to the three-room \"mansionette\" in which  he and Eunice lived. He would never forget the events of that day.    \"What a gang! _What_ a gang! But listen, ace--they work under their own  power--you couldn't _keep_ those kids from working. Why should I get the  credit for what they do?\"    \"I haven't the foggiest.\" Eunice wrinkled her forehead--and her  nose--but the corners of her mouth quirked up. \"Are you quite sure that  you haven't had _anything_ to do with it? But supper is ready--let's  eat.\"    More months passed. Work went on. Absorbing work, and highly varied; the  details of which are of no importance here. Paul Jones, a big, hard,  top-drawer chicle technologist, set up the Four line to pour demolition  blocks. Frederick Hinton came in, qualified as a Siberian, and went to  work on Anti-Personnel mines.    Kinnison was promoted again: to Chief Chemist. He and Sumner had never  been friendly; he made no effort to find out why Cappy had quit, or had  been terminated, whichever it was. This promotion made no difference.  Barton, now Assistant, ran the whole Chemical Section save for one  unit--Siberia--and did a superlative job. The Chief Chemist's secretary  worked for Barton, not for Kinnison. Kinnison was the Czar of Siberia.    The Anti-Personnel mines had been giving trouble. Too many men were  being killed by prematures, and nobody could find out why. The problem  was handed to Siberia. Hinton tackled it, missed, and called for help.  The Siberians rallied round. Kinnison loaded and tested mines. So did  Paul and Tug and Blondie. Kinnison was testing, out in the Firing Area,  when he was called to Administration to attend a Staff Meeting. Hinton  relieved him. He had not reached the gate, however, when a guard car  flagged him down.    \"Sorry, sir, but there has been an accident at Pit Five and you are  needed out there.\"    \"Accident! Fred Hinton! Is he...?\"    \"I'm afraid so, sir.\"    It is a harrowing thing to have to help gather up what fragments can be  found of one of your best friends. Kinnison was white and sick as he got  back to the firing station, just in time to hear the Chief Safety  Officer say:    \"Must have been carelessness--rank carelessness. I warned this man  Hinton myself, on one occasion.\"    \"Carelessness, hell!\" Kinnison blazed. \"You had the guts to warn _me_  once, too, and I've forgotten more about safety in explosives than you  ever will know. Fred Hinton was _not_ careless--if I hadn't been called  in, that would have been me.\"    \"What is it, then?\"    \"I don't know--yet. I tell you now, though, Major Moulton, that I _will_  know, and the minute I find out I'll talk to you again.\"    He went back to Siberia, where he found Tug and Paul, faces still  tear-streaked, staring at something that looked like a small piece of  wire.    \"This is it, Uncle Ralph,\" Tug said, brokenly. \"Don't see how it could  be, but it is.\"    \"What is what?\" Kinnison demanded.    \"Firing pin. Brittle. When you pull the safety, the force of the spring  must break it off at this constricted section here.\"    \"But damn it, Tug, it doesn't make sense. It's tension ... but  wait--there'd be some horizontal component, at that. But they'd have to  be brittle as glass.\"    \"I know it. It doesn't seem to make much sense. But we were there, you  know--and I assembled every one of those God damned mines myself.  Nothing else could possibly have made that mine go off just when it  did.\"    \"O.K., Tug. We'll test 'em. Call Bart in--he can have the scale-lab boys  rig us up a gadget by the time we can get some more of those pins in off  the line.\"    They tested a hundred, under the normal tension of the spring, and three  of them broke. They tested another hundred. Five broke. They stared at  each other.    \"That's it.\" Kinnison declared. \"But this will stink to high  Heaven--have Inspection break out a new lot and we'll test a thousand.\"    Of that thousand pins, thirty two broke.    \"Bart, will you dictate a one-page preliminary report to Vera and rush  it over to Building One as fast as you can? I'll go over and tell  Moulton a few things.\"    Major Moulton was, as usual, \"in conference,\" but Kinnison was in no  mood to wait.    \"Tell him,\" he instructed the Major's private secretary, who had barred  his way, \"that either he will talk to me right now or I will call  District Safety over his head. I'll give him sixty seconds to decide  which.\"    Moulton decided to see him. \"I'm very busy, Doctor Kinnison, but....\"    \"I don't give a swivel-eyed tinker's damn how busy you are. I told you  that the minute I"]]]
