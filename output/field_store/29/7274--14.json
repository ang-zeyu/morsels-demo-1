O that some seedling gem,            Worthy such noble stem,      Honored and blest in their shadow might grow;            Loud should Clan-Alpine then            Ring from her deepmost glen,      \"Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!\"      XXI      With all her joyful female band,    Had Lady Margaret sought the strand.                           440    Loose on the breeze their tresses flew,    And high their snowy arms they threw,    As echoing back with shrill acclaim,    And chorus wild, the Chieftain's name;    While, prompt to please, with mother's art,                    445    The darling passion of his heart,    The Dame called Ellen to the strand,    To greet her kinsman ere he land:    \"Come, loiterer, come! a Douglas thou,    And shun to wreathe a victor's brow?\"                          450    Reluctantly and slow, the maid    The unwelcome summoning obeyed,    And, when a distant bugle rung,    In the mid-path aside she sprung:    \"List Allan-bane! From mainland cast                           455    I hear my father's signal blast.    Be ours,\" she cried, \"the skiff to guide,    And waft him from the mountain side.\"    Then, like a sunbeam, swift and bright,    She darted to her shallop light,                               460    And, eagerly while Roderick scanned,    For her dear form, his mother's band,    The islet far behind her lay,    And she had landed in the bay.      XXII      Some feelings are to mortals given,                            465    With less of earth in them than heaven:    And if there be a human tear    From passion's dross refined and clear,    A tear so limpid and so meek,    It would not stain an angel's cheek,                           470    'Tis that which pious fathers shed    Upon a duteous daughter's head!    And as the Douglas to his breast    His darling Ellen closely pressed,    Such holy drops her tresses steeped,                           475    Though 'twas an hero's eye that weeped.    Nor while on Ellen's faltering tongue    Her filial welcomes crowded hung,    Marked she, that fear, affection's proof,    Still held a graceful youth aloof;                             480    No! not till Douglas named his name,    Although the youth was Malcolm Graeme.      XXIII      Allan, with wistful look the while,    Marked Roderick landing on the isle;    His master piteously he eyed.                                  485    Then gazed upon the Chieftain's pride,    Then dashed, with hasty hand, away    From his dimmed eye the gathering spray;    And Douglas, as his hand he laid    On Malcolm's shoulder, kindly said,                            490    \"Canst thou, young friend, no meaning spy    In my poor follower's glistening eye?    I'll tell thee: he recalls the day,    When in my praise he led the lay    O'er the arched gate of Bothwell proud,                        495    While many a minstrel answered loud,    When Percy's Norman pennon, won    In bloody field, before me shone,    And twice ten knights, the least a name    As mighty as yon Chief may claim,                              500    Gracing my pomp, behind me came.    Yet trust me, Malcolm, not so proud    Was I of all that marshaled crowd,    Though the waned crescent owned my might,    And in my train trooped lord and knight,                       505    Though Blantyre hymned her holiest lays,    And Bothwell's bards flung back my praise,    As when this old man's silent tear,    And this poor maid's affection dear,    A welcome give more kind and true,                             510    Than aught my better fortunes knew.    Forgive, my friend, a father's boast,    Oh! it out-beggars all I lost!\"      XXIV      Delightful praise!--like summer rose,    That brighter in the dew-drop glows,                           515    The bashful maiden's cheek appeared,    For Douglas spoke and Malcolm heard.    The flush of shame-faced joy to hide,    The hounds, the hawk, her cares divide;    The loved caresses of the maid                                 520    The dogs with crouch and whimper paid;    And, at her whistle, on her hand    The falcon took his favorite stand,    Closed his dark wing, relaxed his eye,    Nor, though unhooded, sought to fly.                           525    And, trust, while in such guise she stood,    Like fabled Goddess of the wood,    That if a father's partial thought    O'erweighed her worth, and beauty aught,    Well might the lover's judgment fail                           530    To balance with a juster scale;    For with each secret glance he stole,    The fond enthusiast sent his soul.      XXV      Of stature tall, and slender frame,    But firmly knit, was Malcolm Graeme.                           535    The belted plaid and tartan hose    Did ne'er more graceful limbs disclose;    His flaxen hair, of sunny hue,    Curled closely round his bonnet blue.    Trained to the chase, his eagle eye                            540    The ptarmigan in snow could spy;    Each pass, by mountain, lake, and heath,    He knew, through Lennox and Menteith;    Vain was the bound of dark-brown doe,    When Malcolm bent his sounding bow,                            545    And scarce that doe, though winged with fear,    Outstripped in speed the mountaineer;    Right up Ben-Lomond could he press,    And not a sob his toil confess.    His form accorded with a mind                                  550    Lively and ardent, frank and kind;    A blither heart, till Ellen came,    Did never love nor sorrow tame;    It danced as lightsome in his breast,    As played the feather on his crest.                            555    Yet friends, who nearest knew the youth,    His scorn of wrong, his zeal for truth,    And bards, who saw his features bold,    When kindled by the tales of old,    Said, were that youth to manhood grown,                        560    Not long should Roderick Dhu's renown    Be foremost voiced by mountain fame,    But quail to that of Malcolm Graeme.      XXVI      Now back they wend their watery way,    And, \"O my sire!\" did Ellen say,                               565    \"Why urge thy chase so far astray?    And why so late returned? And why\"--    The rest was in her speaking eye.    \"My child, the chase I follow far,    'Tis mimicry of noble war;                                     570    And with that gallant pastime reft    Were all of Douglas I have left.    I met young Malcolm as I strayed    Far eastward, in Glenfinlas' shade,    Nor strayed I safe; for all around,                            575    Hunters and horsemen scoured the ground.    This youth, though still a royal ward,    Risked life and land to be my guard,    And through the passes of the wood    Guided my steps, not unpursued;                                580    And Roderick shall his welcome make,    Despite old spleen, for Douglas' sake.    Then must he seek Strath-Endrick glen,    Nor peril aught for me again.\"      XXVII      Sir Roderick, who to meet them came,                           585    Reddened at sight of Malcolm Graeme,    Yet, not in action, word, or eye,    Failed aught in hospitality.    In talk and sport they whiled away    The morning of that summer day;                                590    But at high noon a courier light    Held secret parley with the knight,    Whose moody aspect soon declared,    That evil were the news he heard.    Deep thought seemed toiling in his head;                       595    Yet was the evening banquet made,    Ere he assembled round the flame,    His mother, Douglas, and the Graeme,    And Ellen too; then cast around    His eyes, then fixed them on the ground,                       600    As studying phrase that might avail    Best to convey unpleasant tale.    Long with his dagger's hilt he played,    Then raised his haughty brow, and said:      XXVIII      \"Short be my speech--nor time affords,                         605    Nor my plain temper, glozing words.    Kinsman and father--if such name    Douglas vouchsafe to Roderick's claim;    Mine honored mother--Ellen--why,    My cousin, turn away thine eye?--                              610    And Graeme, in whom I hope to know    Full soon a noble friend or foe,    When age shall give thee thy command,    And leading in thy native land--    List all--The King's vindictive pride                          615    Boasts to have tamed the Border-side,    Where chiefs, with hound and hawk who came    To share their monarch's silvan game,    Themselves in bloody toils were snared;    And when the banquet they prepared,                            620    And wide their loyal portals flung,    O'er their own gateway struggling hung.    Loud cries their blood from Meggat's mead,    From Yarrow braes, and banks of Tweed,    Where the lone streams of Ettrick glide,                       625    And from the silver Teviot's side;    The dales, where martial clans did ride,    Are now one sheep-walk, waste and wide.    This tyrant of the Scottish throne,    So faithless, and so ruthless known,                           630    Now hither comes; his end the same,    The same pretext of silvan game.    What grace for Highland Chiefs, judge ye    By fate of Border chivalry.    Yet more; amid Glenfinlas' green,                              635    Douglas, thy stately form was seen.    This by espial sure I know:    Your counsel in the strait I show.\"      XXIX      Ellen and Margaret fearfully    Sought comfort in each other's eye,                            640    Then turned their ghastly look, each one,    This to her sire, that to her son.    The hasty color went and came    In the bold cheek of Malcolm Graeme;    But from his glance it well appeared,                          645    'Twas but for Ellen that he feared;    While,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2832"],[0,"Myth, Ritual and Religion, Vol. 1 (of 2) (#14)"],[1,"science. That these pretensions are not  unacknowledged even by mythologists trained in other schools is proved  by the remarks of Dr. Tiele.(1)      (1) Rev. de l'Hist. des Rel., \"Le Mythe de Cronos,\" January, 1886. Dr.  Tiele is not, it must be noted, a thorough adherent of our theory. See  Modern Mythology: \"The Question of Allies\".      Dr. Tiele writes: \"If I were obliged to choose between this method\" (the  system here advocated) \"and that of comparative philology, it is the  former that I would adopt without the slightest hesitation. This method  alone enables us to explain the fact, which has so often provoked  amazement, that people so refined as the Greeks,... or so rude, but  morally pure, as the Germans,... managed to attribute to their gods  all manner of cowardly, cruel and disorderly conduct. This method alone  explains the why and wherefore of all those strange metamorphoses  of gods into beasts and plants, and even stones, which scandalised  philosophers, and which the witty Ovid played on for the diversion of  his contemporaries. In short, this method teaches us to recognise in all  those strange stories the survivals of a barbaric age, long passed away,  but enduring to later times in the form of religious traditions, of all  traditions the most persistent.... Finally, this method alone enables us  to explain the origin of myths, because it endeavours to study them  in their rudest and most primitive shape, thus allowing their true  significance to be much more clearly apparent than it can be in the  myths (so often touched, retouched, augmented and humanised) which are  current among races arrived at a certain degree of culture.\"    The method is to this extent applauded by a most competent authority,  and it has been warmly accepted by a distinguished French school of  students, represented by M. Gaidoz. But it is obvious that the method  rests on a double hypothesis: first, that satisfactory evidence as to  the mental conditions of the lower and backward races is obtainable;  second, that the civilised races (however they began) either passed  through the savage state of thought and practice, or borrowed very  freely from people in that condition. These hypotheses have been  attacked by opponents; the trustworthiness of our evidence, especially,  has been assailed. By way of facilitating the course of the exposition  and of lessening the disturbing element of controversy, a reply to  the objections and a defence of the evidence has been relegated to an  Appendix.(1) Meanwhile we go on to examine the peculiar characteristics  of the mental condition of savages and of peoples in the lower and upper  barbarisms.      (1) Appendix B.        CHAPTER III. THE MENTAL CONDITION OF SAVAGES--CONFUSION WITH  NATURE--TOTEMISM.      The mental condition of savages the basis of the irrational element in  myth--Characteristics of that condition: (1) Confusion of all things  in an equality of presumed animation and intelligence; (2) Belief in  sorcery; (3) Spiritualism; (4) Curiosity; (5) Easy credulity and mental  indolence--The curiosity is satisfied, thanks to the credulity, by myths  in answer to all inquiries--Evidence for this--Mr. Tylor's opinion--Mr.  Im Thurn--Jesuit missionaries' Relations--Examples of confusion  between men, plants, beasts and other natural objects--Reports of  travellers--Evidence from institution of totemism--Definition of  totemism--Totemism in Australia, Africa, America, the Oceanic Islands,  India, North Asia--Conclusions: Totemism being found so widely  distributed, is a proof of the existence of that savage mental condition  in which no line is drawn between men and the other things in the world.  This confusion is one of the characteristics of myth in all races.      We set out to discover a stage of human intellectual development which  would necessarily produce the essential elements of myth. We think we  have found that stage in the condition of savagery. We now proceed to  array the evidence for the mental processes of savages. We intend to  demonstrate the existence in practical savage life of the ideas which  most surprise us when we find them in civilised sacred legends.    For the purposes of this inquiry, it is enough to select a few special  peculiarities of savage thought.    1. First we have that nebulous and confused frame of mind to which all  things, animate or inanimate, human, animal, vegetable, or inorganic,  seem on the same level of life, passion and reason. The savage, at all  events when myth-making, draws no hard and fast line between himself and  the things in the world. He regards himself as literally akin to animals  and plants and heavenly bodies; he attributes sex and procreative powers  even to stones and rocks, and he assigns human speech and human feelings  to sun and moon and stars and wind, no less than to beasts, birds and  fishes.(1)      (1) \"So fasst auch das Alterthum ihren Unterschied von den Menschen  ganz anders als die spatere Zeit.\"--Grimm, quoted by Liebrecht, Zur  Volkskunde, p. 17.      2. The second point to note in savage opinion is the belief in magic and  sorcery. The world and all the things in it being vaguely conceived of  as sensible and rational, obey the commands of certain members of the  tribe, chiefs, jugglers, conjurors, or what you will. Rocks open at  their order, rivers dry up, animals are their servants and hold converse  with them. These magicians cause or heal diseases, and can command even  the weather, bringing rain or thunder or sunshine at their will.(1)  There are few supernatural attributes of \"cloud-compelling Zeus\" or of  Apollo that are not freely assigned to the tribal conjuror. By virtue,  doubtless, of the community of nature between man and the things in the  world, the conjuror (like Zeus or Indra) can assume at will the shape  of any animal, or can metamorphose his neighbours or enemies into animal  forms.      (1) See Roth in North-West Central Queensland Aborigines, chapter xii.,  1897.      3. Another peculiarity of savage belief naturally connects itself with  that which has just been described. The savage has very strong ideas  about the persistent existence of the souls of the dead. They retain  much of their old nature, but are often more malignant after death than  they had been during life. They are frequently at the beck and call of  the conjuror, whom they aid with their advice and with their magical  power. By virtue of the close connection already spoken of between  man and the animals, the souls of the dead are not rarely supposed to  migrate into the bodies of beasts, or to revert to the condition of that  species of creatures with which each tribe supposes itself to be related  by ties of kinship or friendship. With the usual inconsistency of  mythical belief, the souls of the dead are spoken of, at other times,  as if they inhabited a spiritual world, sometimes a paradise of flowers,  sometimes a gloomy place, which mortal men may visit, but whence no one  can escape who has tasted of the food of the ghosts.    4. In connection with spirits a far-reaching savage philosophy  prevails. It is not unusual to assign a ghost to all objects, animate or  inanimate, and the spirit or strength of a man is frequently regarded as  something separable, capable of being located in an external object,  or something with a definite locality in the body. A man's strength  and spirit may reside in his kidney fat, in his heart, in a lock of his  hair, or may even be stored by him in some separate receptacle. Very  frequently a man is held capable of detaching his soul from his body,  and letting it roam about on his business, sometimes in the form of a  bird or other animal.    5. Many minor savage beliefs might be named, such as the common faith in  friendly or protecting animals, and the notion that \"natural deaths\" (as  we call them) are always UNNATURAL, that death is always caused by some  hostile spirit or conjuror. From this opinion comes the myth that man is  naturally not subject to death: that death was somehow introduced into  the world by a mistake or misdeed is a corollary. (See \"Myths of the  Origin of Death\" in Modern Mythology.)    6. One more mental peculiarity of the savage mind remains to be  considered in this brief summary. The savage, like the civilised man, is  curious. The first faint impulses of the scientific spirit are at work  in his brain; he is anxious to give himself an account of the world  in which he finds himself. But he is not more curious than he is, on  occasion, credulous. His intellect is eager to ask questions, as is the  habit of children, but his intellect is also lazy, and he is content  with the first answer that comes to hand. \"Ils s'arretent aux premieres  notions qu'ils en ont,\" says Pere Hierome Lalemant.(1) \"Nothing,\" says  Schoolcraft, \"is too capacious (sic) for Indian belief.\"(2) The replies  to his questions he receives from tradition or (when a new problem  arises) evolves an answer for himself in the shape of STORIES. Just as  Socrates, in the Platonic dialogues, recalls or invents a myth in the  despair of reason, so the savage has a story for answer to almost  every question that he can ask himself. These stories are in a sense  scientific, because they attempt a solution of the riddles of the world.  They are in a sense religious, because there is usually a supernatural  power, a deus ex machina, of some sort to cut the knot of the problem.  Such stories, then, are the science, and to a certain extent the  religious tradition, of savages.(3)      (1) Relations de la Nouvelle France, 1648, p. 70.    (2) Algic Researches, i. 41.    (3) \"The Indians (Algonkins) conveyed instruction--moral, mechanical and  religious--through traditionary fictions and tales.\"--Schoolcraft, Algic  Researches, i. 12.      Now these tales are necessarily cast in the mould of the savage ideas of  which a sketch has been given. The changes of the heavenly"]]]
