If we turn to the French, we discover that the  military genius of France dictated the proverb _Maille a maille se fait  le haubergeon_: \"Link by link is made the coat of mail;\" and, _Tel coup  de langue est pire qu'un coup de lance_; \"The tongue strikes deeper than  the lance;\" and _Ce qui vient du tambour s'en retourne a la flute_;  \"What comes by the tabor goes back with the pipe.\" _Point d'argent point  de Suisse_ has become proverbial, observes an Edinburgh Reviewer; a  striking expression, which, while French or Austrian gold predominated,  was justly used to characterise the illiberal and selfish policy of the  cantonal and federal governments of Switzerland, when it began to  degenerate from its moral patriotism. The ancient, perhaps the extinct,  spirit of Englishmen was once expressed by our proverb, \"Better be the  head of a dog than the tail of a lion;\" _i.e._, the first of the  yeomanry rather than the last of the gentry. A foreign philosopher might  have discovered our own ancient skill in archery among our proverbs; for  none but true toxophilites could have had such a proverb as, \"I will  either make a shaft or a bolt of it!\" signifying, says the author of  _Ivanhoe_, a determination to make one use or other of the thing spoken  of: the bolt was the arrow peculiarly fitted to the cross-bow, as that  of the long-bow was called a shaft. These instances sufficiently  demonstrate that the characteristic circumstances and feelings of a  people are discovered in their popular notions, and stamped on their  familiar proverbs.    It is also evident that the peculiar, and often idiomatic, humour of a  people is best preserved in their proverbs. There is a shrewdness,  although deficient in delicacy, in the Scottish proverbs; they are  idiomatic, facetious, and strike home. Kelly, who has collected three  thousand, informs us, that, in 1725, the Scotch were a great proverbial  nation; for that few among the better sort will converse any  considerable time, but will confirm every assertion and observation with  a Scottish proverb. The speculative Scotch of our own times have  probably degenerated in prudential lore, and deem themselves much wiser  than their proverbs. They may reply by a Scotch proverb on proverbs,  made by a great man in Scotland, who, having given a splendid  entertainment, was harshly told, that \"Fools make feasts, and wise men  eat them;\" but he readily answered, \"Wise men make proverbs, and fools  repeat them!\"    National humour, frequently local and idiomatical, depends on the  artificial habits of mankind, so opposite to each other; but there is a  natural vein, which the populace, always true to nature, preserve, even  among the gravest people. The Arabian proverb, \"The barber learns his  art on the orphan's face;\" the Chinese, \"In a field of melons do not  pull up your shoe; under a plum-tree do not adjust your cap;\"--to  impress caution in our conduct under circumstances of suspicion;--and  the Hebrew one, \"He that hath had one of his family hanged may not say  to his neighbour, _hang_ up this fish!\" are all instances of this sort  of humour. The Spaniards are a grave people, but no nation has equalled  them in their peculiar humour. The genius of Cervantes partook largely  of that of his country; that mantle of gravity, which almost conceals  its latent facetiousness, and with which he has imbued his style and  manner with such untranslatable idiomatic raciness, may be traced to the  proverbial erudition of his nation. \"To steal a sheep, and give away the  trotters for God's sake!\" is Cervantic nature! To one who is seeking an  opportunity to quarrel with another, their proverb runs, _Si quieres dar  palos a sur muger pidele al sol a bever_, \"Hast thou a mind to quarrel  with thy wife, bid her bring water to thee in the sunshine!\"--a very  fair quarrel may be picked up about the motes in the clearest water! On  the judges in Gallicia, who, like our former justices of peace, \"for  half a dozen chickens would dispense with a dozen of penal statutes,\" _A  juezes Gallicianos, con los pies en las manos_: \"To the judges of  Gallicia go with feet in hand;\" a droll allusion to a present of  poultry, usually held by the legs. To describe persons who live high  without visible means, _Los que cabritos venden, y cabras no tienen, de  donde los vienen?_ \"They that sell kids, and have no goats, how came  they by them?\" _El vino no trae bragas_, \"Wine wears no breeches;\" for  men in wine expose their most secret thoughts. _Vino di un oreja_, \"Wine  of one ear!\" is good wine; for at bad, shaking our heads, both our ears  are visible; but at good the Spaniard, by a natural gesticulation  lowering on one side, shows a single ear.    Proverbs abounding in sarcastic humour, and found among every people,  are those which are pointed at rival countries. Among ourselves, hardly  has a county escaped from some popular quip; even neighbouring towns  have their sarcasms, usually pickled in some unlucky rhyme. The egotism  of man eagerly seizes on whatever serves to depreciate or to ridicule  his neighbour: nations proverb each other; counties flout counties;  obscure towns sharpen their wits on towns as obscure as themselves--the  same evil principle lurking in poor human nature, if it cannot always  assume predominance, will meanly gratify itself by insult or contempt.  They expose some prevalent folly, or allude to some disgrace which the  natives have incurred. In France, the Burgundians have a proverb, _Mieux  vaut bon repas que bel habit_; \"Better a good dinner than a fine coat.\"  These good people are great gormandizers, but shabby dressers; they are  commonly said to have \"bowels of silk and velvet;\" this is, all their  silk and velvet goes for their bowels! Thus Picardy is famous for \"hot  heads;\" and the Norman for _son dit et son dedit_, \"his saying and his  unsaying!\" In Italy the numerous rival cities pelt one another with  proverbs: _Chi ha a fare con Tosco non convien esser losco_, \"He who  deals with a Tuscan must not have his eyes shut.\" _A Venetia chi vi  nasce mal vi si pasce_, \"Whom Venice breeds, she poorly feeds.\"    There is another source of national characteristics, frequently  producing strange or whimsical combinations; a people, from a very  natural circumstance, have drawn their proverbs from local objects, or  from allusions to peculiar customs. The influence of manners and customs  over the ideas and language of a people would form a subject of  extensive and curious research. There is a Japanese proverb, that \"A fog  cannot be dispelled with a fan!\" Had we not known the origin of this  proverb, it would be evident that it could only have occurred to a  people who had constantly before them fogs and fans; and the fact  appears that fogs are frequent on the coast of Japan, and that from the  age of five years both sexes of the Japanese carry fans. The Spaniards  have an odd proverb to describe those who tease and vex a person before  they do him the very benefit which they are about to confer--acting  kindly, but speaking roughly; _Mostrar primero la horca que le lugar_,  \"To show the gallows before they show the town;\" a circumstance alluding  to their small towns, which have a gallows placed on an eminence, so  that the gallows breaks on the eye of the traveller before he gets a  view of the town itself.    The Cheshire proverb on marriage, \"Better wed over the mixon than over  the moor,\" that is, at home or in its vicinity; mixon alludes to the  dung, &c., in the farm-yard, while the road from Chester to London is  over the moorland in Staffordshire: this local proverb is a curious  instance of provincial pride, perhaps of wisdom, to induce the gentry of  that county to form intermarriages; to prolong their own ancient  families, and perpetuate ancient friendships between them.    In the Isle of Man a proverbial expression forcibly indicates the object  constantly occupying the minds of the inhabitants. The two Deemsters or  judges, when appointed to the chair of judgment, declare they will  render justice between man and man \"as equally as the herring bone lies  between the two sides:\" an image which could not have occurred to any  people unaccustomed to the herring-fishery. There is a Cornish proverb,  \"Those who will not be ruled by the rudder must be ruled by the  rock\"--the strands of Cornwall, so often covered with wrecks, could not  fail to impress on the imaginations of its inhabitants the two objects  from whence they drew this salutary proverb against obstinate  wrongheads.    When Scotland, in the last century, felt its allegiance to England  doubtful, and when the French sent an expedition to the Land of Cakes, a  local proverb was revived, to show the identity of interests which  affected both nations:      If Skiddaw hath a cap,    Scruffel wots full well of that.    These are two high hills, one in Scotland and one in England; so near,  that what happens to the one will not be long ere it reach the other. If  a fog lodges on the one, it is sure to rain on the other; the mutual  sympathies of the two countries were hence deduced in a copious  dissertation, by Oswald Dyke, on what was called \"The Union-proverb,\"  which _local proverbs_ of our country Fuller has interspersed in his  \"Worthies,\" and Ray and Grose have collected separately.    I was amused lately by a curious financial revelation which I found in  an opposition paper, where it appears that \"Ministers pretend to make  their load of taxes more portable, by shifting the burden, or altering  the pressure, without, however, diminishing the weight;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31103"],[0,"A Christmas Greeting: A Series of Stories (#14)"],[1,"one is, the more one can endure!\"    \"Crack!\" said the egg-shell: a wheel went over it.    \"Good heavens! how heavy that presses!\" said the needle. \"Now I shall  be sea-sick! I snap!\" But it did not snap, although a wheel went over  it. It lay there at full length, and there it may lie still.      ------------        THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL.    Most terribly cold it was; it snowed, and was nearly quite dark, and  evening--the last evening of the year. In this cold and darkness there  went along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded, and with naked  feet. When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but what was  the good of that? They were very large slippers, which her mother had  hitherto worn; so large were they; and the poor little thing lost them  as she scuffled away across the street, because of two carriages that  rolled by dreadfully fast. One slipper was nowhere to be found; the  other had been laid hold of by an urchin, and off he ran with it; he  thought it would do capitally for a cradle when he some day or other  should have children himself. So the little maiden walked on with her  tiny naked feet, that were quite red and blue from cold. She carried a  quantity of matches in an old apron, and she held a bundle of them in  her hand. Nobody had bought anything of her the whole livelong day; no  one had given her a single farthing.    She crept along trembling with cold and hunger--a very picture of  sorrow, the poor little thing!    The flakes of snow covered her long fair hair, which fell in beautiful  curls around her neck; but of that, of course, she never once now  thought. From all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt  so deliciously of roast goose, for you know it was new year's eve;  yes, of that she thought.    In a corner formed by two houses, of which one advanced more than the  other, she seated herself down and cowered together. Her little feet  she had drawn close up to her, but she grew colder and colder, and to  go home she did not venture, for she had not sold any matches and  could not bring a farthing of money: from her father she would  certainly get blows, and at home it was cold too, for above her she  had only the roof, through which the wind whistled, even though the  largest cracks were stopped up with straw and rags.    Her little hands were almost numbed with cold. Oh! a match might  afford her a world of comfort, if she only dared take a single one out  of the bundle, draw it against the wall, and warm her fingers by it.  She drew one out. \"Rischt!\" how it blazed, how it burnt! It was a  warm, bright flame, like a candle, as she held her hands over it: it  was a wonderful light. It seemed really to the little maiden as though  she were sitting before a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet  and a brass ornament at top. The fire burned with such blessed  influence; it warmed so delightfully. The little girl had already  stretched out her feet to warm them too; but--the small flame went  out, the stove vanished: she had only the remains of the burnt out  match in her hand.    She rubbed another against the wall: it burned brightly, and where the  light fell on the wall, there the wall became transparent like a veil,  so that she could see into the room. On the table was spread a  snow-white tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain service, and  the roast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple and  dried plums. And what was still more capital to behold was, the goose  hopped down from the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and  fork in its breast, till it came up to the poor little girl; when--the  match went out and nothing but the thick, cold, damp wall was left  behind. She lighted another match. Now there she was sitting under the  most magnificent Christmas trees: it was still larger, and more  decorated than the one which she had seen through the glass door in  the rich merchant's house.      [Illustration: THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL.]      Thousands of lights were burning on the green branches, and  gaily-colored pictures, such as she had seen in the shop-windows  looked down upon her. The little maiden stretched out her hands  towards them when--the match went out. The lights of the Christmas  tree rose higher and higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one  fell down and formed a long trail of fire.    \"Some one is just dead!\" said the little girl; for her old  grandmother, the only person who had loved her, and who was now no  more, had told her, that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.    She drew another match against the wall: it was again light, and in  the lustre there stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant, so  mild, and with such an expression of love.    \"Grandmother!\" cried the little one; \"oh, take me with you! You go  away when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove, like  the delicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas tree!\"  And she rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall,  for she wanted to be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her.  And the matches gave such a brilliant light that it was brighter than  at noon-day: never formerly had the grandmother been so beautiful and  so tall. She took the little maiden, on her arm, and both flew in  brightness and in joy so high, so very high, and then above was  neither cold, nor hunger, nor anxiety--they were with God.    But in the corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat the poor girl, with  rosy cheeks and with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall--frozen  to death on the last evening of the old year. Stiff and stark sat the  child there with her matches, of which one bundle had been burnt. \"She  wanted to warm herself,\" people said: no one had the slightest  suspicion of what beautiful things she had seen; no one even dreamed  of the splendor in which, with her grandmother she had entered on the  joys of a new year.      ------------        THE RED SHOES.    There was once a little girl who was very pretty and delicate, but in  summer she was forced to run about with bare feet, she was so poor,  and in winter wear very large wooden shoes, which made her little  insteps quite red, and that looked so dangerous!    In the middle of the village lived old Dame Shoemaker; she sate and  sewed together, as well as she could, a little pair of shoes out of  old red strips of cloth; they were very clumsy, but it was a kind  thought. They were meant for the little girl. The little girl was  called Karen.    On the very day her mother was buried, Karen received the red shoes,  and wore them for the first time. They were certainly not intended for  mourning, but she had no others, and with stockingless feet she  followed the poor straw coffin in them.    Suddenly a large old carriage drove up and a large old lady sate in  it: she looked at the little girl, felt compassion for her, and then  said to the clergyman:    \"Here, give me the little girl, I will adopt her!\"    And Karen believed all this happened on account of the red shoes, but  the old lady thought they were horrible, and they were burnt. But  Karen herself was cleanly and nicely dressed; she must learn to read  and sew; and people said she was a nice little thing, but the  looking-glass said: \"Thou art more than nice, thou art beautiful!\"    Now the queen once traveled through the land, and she had her little  daughter with her. And this little daughter was a princess, and people  streamed to the castle, and Karen was there also, and the little  princess stood in her fine white dress, in a window, and let herself  be stared at; she had neither a train nor a golden crown, but splendid  red morocco shoes. They were certainly far handsomer than those Dame  Shoemaker had made for little Karen. Nothing in the world can be  compared with red shoes.    Now Karen was old enough to be confirmed; she had new clothes and was  to have new shoes also. The rich shoemaker in the city took the  measure of her little foot. This took place at his house, in his room;  where stood large glass-cases, filled with elegant shoes and brilliant  boots. All this looked charming, but the old lady could not see well,  and so had no pleasure in them. In the midst of the shoes stood a pair  of red ones, just like those the princess had worn. How beautiful they  were! The shoemaker said also they had been made for the child of a  count, but had not fitted.    \"That must be patent leather!\" said the old lady, \"they shine so!'\"    \"Yes, they shine!\" said Karen, and they fitted, and were bought, but  the old lady knew nothing about their being red, else she would never  have allowed Karen to have gone in red shoes to be confirmed. Yet such  was the case.    Everybody looked at her feet; and when she stepped through the chancel  door on the church pavement, it seemed to her as if the old figures on  the tombs, those portraits of old preachers and preachers' wives, with  stiff ruffs, and long black dresses, fixed their eyes on her red  shoes. And she thought only of them as the clergyman laid his hand  upon her head, and spoke of the holy baptism, of the covenant with  God, and how she should be now a matured Christian; and the organ  pealed so solemnly; the sweet children's voices sang, and the old  music-directors sang, but Karen only thought of her red shoes.    In the afternoon, the old lady heard from every one that the shoes had  been red, and she said that it was very wrong of Karen, that it was  not at all becoming, and that in future Karen should only go in black  shoes to church, even when she should be older.    The next Sunday there was the sacrament, and Karen looked at the black  shoes, looked at the red ones--looked at them again, and put on the  red shoes.    The sun shone gloriously; Karen and the old lady walked along the path  through the corn; it was rather dusty there.    At the church door stood an old soldier with a crutch, and with"]]]
