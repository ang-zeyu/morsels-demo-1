Having  regarded the question from these two points of view, Sir John Bawdon  gave Somers his dismissal and married Miss Anne to a rich Turkey  merchant. Three years later, when Somers had risen to the woolsack, and  it was clear that the rich Turkey merchant would never be anything  grander than a rich Turkey merchant, Sir John saw that he had made a  serious blunder, for which his child certainly could not thank him. A  goodly list might be made of cases where papas have erred and repented  in Sir John Bawdon's fashion. Sir John Lawrence would have made his  daughter a Lord Keeper's lady and a peeress, if he and his broker had  dealt more liberally with Francis North. Had it not been for Sir Joseph  Jekyll's counsel, Mr. Cocks, the Worcestershire squire, would have  rejected Philip Yorke as an ineligible suitor, in which case _plain_  Mrs. Lygon would never have been Lady Hardwicke, and worked her  husband's twenty purses of state upon curtains and hangings of crimson  velvet. And, if he were so inclined, this writer could point to a  learned judge, who in his days of 'stuff' and 'guinea fees' was deemed  an ineligible match for a country apothecary's pretty daughter. The  country doctor being able to give his daughter L20,000, turned away  disdainfully from the unknown 'junior,' who five years later was leading  his circuit, and quickly rose to the high office which he still fills to  the satisfaction of his country.    Disappointed in his pursuit of Anne Bawdon, Somers never again made any  woman an offer of marriage; but scandalous gossip accused him of immoral  intercourse with his housekeeper. This woman's name was Blount; and  while she resided with the Chancellor, fame whispered that her husband  was still living. Not only was Somers charged with open adultery, but it  was averred that for the sake of peace he had imprisoned in a madhouse  his mistress's lawful husband, who was originally a Worcester tradesman.  The chief authority for this startling imputation is Mrs. Manley, who  was encouraged, if not actually paid, by Swift to lampoon his political  adversaries. In her 'New Atalantis'--the 'Cicero' of which scandalous  work was understood by its readers to signify 'Lord Somers,'--this  shameless woman entertained quid-nuncs and women of fashion by putting  this abominable story in written words, the coarseness of which accorded  with the repulsiveness of the accusation.    At a time when honest writers on current politics were punished with  fine and imprisonment, the pillory and the whip, statesmen and  ecclesiastics were not ashamed to keep such libellers as Mrs. Manley in  their pay. That the reader may fully appreciate the change which time  has wrought in the tone of political literature, let him contrast the  virulence and malignity of this unpleasant passage from the New  Atalantis, with the tone which recently characterized the public  discussion of the case which is generally known by the name of 'The  Edmunds Scandal.'    Notwithstanding her notorious disregard of truth, it is scarcely  credible that Mrs. Manley's scurrilous charge was in no way countenanced  by facts. At the close of the seventeenth century to keep a mistress was  scarcely regarded as an offence against good morals; and living in  accordance with the fashion of the time, it is probable that Somers did  that which Lord Thurlow, after an interval of a century, was able to do  without rousing public disapproval. Had his private life been spotless,  he would doubtless have taken legal steps to silence his traducer; and  unsustained by a knowledge that he dared not court inquiry into his  domestic arrangements, Mrs. Manley would have used her pen with greater  caution. But all persons competent to form an opinion on the case have  agreed that the more revolting charges of the indictment were the  baseless fictions of a malicious and unclean mind.          CHAPTER X.    BROTHERS IN TROUBLE.      In the 'Philosophical Dictionary,' Voltaire, laboring under  misapprehension or carried away by perverse humor, made the following  strange announcement:--\"Il est public en Angleterre, et on voudroit le  nier en vain, que le Chancelier Cowper epousa deux femmes, qui vecurent  ensemble dans sa maison avec une concorde singuliere qui fit honneur a  tous trois. Plusieurs curieux ont encore le petit livre que ce  Chancelier composa en faveur de la Polygamie.\" Tickled by the  extravagant credulity or grotesque malice of this declaration, an  English wit, improving upon the published words, represented the  Frenchman as maintaining that the custodian of the Great Seal of England  was called the _Lord Keeper_, because, by English law, he was permitted  to keep as many wives as he pleased.    The reader's amusement will not be diminished by a brief statement of  the facts to which we are indebted for Voltaire's assertions.    William Cowper, the first earl of his line, began life with a reputation  for dissipated tastes and habits, and by unpleasant experience he  learned how difficult it is to get rid of a bad name. The son of a  Hertfordshire baronet, he was still a law student when he formed a  reprehensible connexion with an unmarried lady of that county--Miss (or,  as she was called by the fashion of the day Mistress) Elizabeth Culling,  of Hertingfordbury Park. But little is known of this woman. Her age is  an affair of uncertainty, and all the minor circumstances of her  intrigue with young William Cowper are open to doubt and conjecture; but  the few known facts justify the inference that she neither merited nor  found much pity in her disgrace, and that William erred through boyish  indiscretion rather than from vicious propensity. She bore him two  children, and he neither married her nor was required by public opinion  to marry her. The respectability of their connexions gave the affair a  peculiar interest, and afforded countenance to many groundless reports.  By her friends it was intimated that the boy had not triumphed over the  lady's virtue until he had made her a promise of marriage; and some  persons even went so far as to assert that they were privately married.  It is not unlikely that at one time the boy intended to make her his  wife as soon as he should be independent of his father, and free to  please himself. Beyond question, however, is it that they were never  united in wedlock, and that Will Cowper joined the Home Circuit with the  tenacious fame of a scapegrace and _roue_.    That he was for any long period a man of dissolute morals is improbable;  for he was only twenty-four years of age when he was called to the bar,  and before his call he had married (after a year's wooing) a virtuous  and exemplary young lady, with whom he lived happily for more than  twenty years. A merchant's child, whose face was her fortune--Judith,  the daughter of Sir Robert Booth, is extolled by biographers for  reclaiming her young husband from a life of levity and culpable  pleasure. That he loved her sincerely from the date of their imprudent  marriage till the date of her death, which occurred just about six  months before his elevation to the woolsack, there is abundant evidence.    Judith died April 2, 1705, and in the September of the following year  the Lord Keeper married Mary Clavering, the beautiful and virtuous lady  of the bedchamber to Caroline Wilhelmina Dorothea, Princess of Wales.  This lady was the Countess Cowper whose diary was published by Mr.  Murray in the spring of 1864; and in every relation of life she was as  good and noble a creature as her predecessor in William Cowper's  affection. Of the loving terms on which she lived with her lord,  conclusive testimony is found in their published letters and her diary.  Frequently separated by his professional avocations and her duties of  attendance upon the Princess of Wales, they maintained, during the  periods of personal severance, a close and tender intercourse by written  words; and at all other times, in sickness not less than in health, they  were a fondly united couple. One pathetic entry in the countess's diary  speaks eloquently of their nuptial tenderness and devotion:--\"April 7th,  1716. After dinner we went to Sir Godfrey Kneller's to see a picture of  my lord, which he is drawing, and is the best that was ever done for  him; it is for my drawing-room, and in the same posture that he watched  me so many weeks in my great illness.\"    Lord Cowper's second marriage was solemnized with a secrecy for which  his biographers are unable to account. The event took place September,  1706, about two months before his father's death, but it was not  announced till the end of February, 1707, at which time Luttrell entered  in his diary, \"The Lord Keeper, who not long since was privately married  to Mrs. Clavering of the bishoprick of Durham, brought her home this  day.\" Mr. Foss, in his 'Judges of England,' suggests that the  concealment of the union \"may not improbably be explained by the Lord  Keeper's desire not to disturb the last days of his father, who might  perhaps have been disappointed that the selection had not fallen on some  other lady to whom he had wished his son to be united.\" But this  conjecture, notwithstanding its probability, is only a conjecture.  Unless they had grave reasons for their conduct, the Lord Keeper and his  lady had better have joined hands in the presence of the world, for the  mystery of their private wedding nettled public curiosity, and gave new  life to an old slander.    Cowper's boyish _escapade_ was not forgotten by the malicious. No sooner  had he become conspicuous in his profession and in politics, than the  story of his intercourse with Miss Culling was told in coffee-rooms with  all the exaggerations that prurient fancy could devise or enmity  dictate. The old tale of a secret marriage--or, still worse, of a mock  marriage--was caught from the lips of some Hertford scandal-monger, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2781"],[0,"Just So Stories (#14)"],[1,"we have no more need of either friends or  servants in our Cave.    Cat said, 'I am not a friend, and I am not a servant. I am the Cat who  walks by himself, and I wish to come into your cave.'    Woman said, 'Then why did you not come with First Friend on the first  night?'    Cat grew very angry and said, 'Has Wild Dog told tales of me?'    Then the Woman laughed and said, 'You are the Cat who walks by himself,  and all places are alike to you. Your are neither a friend nor a  servant. You have said it yourself. Go away and walk by yourself in all  places alike.'    Then Cat pretended to be sorry and said, 'Must I never come into the  Cave? Must I never sit by the warm fire? Must I never drink the warm  white milk? You are very wise and very beautiful. You should not be  cruel even to a Cat.'    Woman said, 'I knew I was wise, but I did not know I was beautiful. So I  will make a bargain with you. If ever I say one word in your praise you  may come into the Cave.'    'And if you say two words in my praise?' said the Cat.    'I never shall,' said the Woman, 'but if I say two words in your praise,  you may sit by the fire in the Cave.'    'And if you say three words?' said the Cat.    'I never shall,' said the Woman, 'but if I say three words in your  praise, you may drink the warm white milk three times a day for always  and always and always.'    Then the Cat arched his back and said, 'Now let the Curtain at the mouth  of the Cave, and the Fire at the back of the Cave, and the Milk-pots  that stand beside the Fire, remember what my Enemy and the Wife of my  Enemy has said.' And he went away through the Wet Wild Woods waving his  wild tail and walking by his wild lone.    That night when the Man and the Horse and the Dog came home from  hunting, the Woman did not tell them of the bargain that she had made  with the Cat, because she was afraid that they might not like it.    Cat went far and far away and hid himself in the Wet Wild Woods by his  wild lone for a long time till the Woman forgot all about him. Only the  Bat--the little upside-down Bat--that hung inside the Cave, knew where  Cat hid; and every evening Bat would fly to Cat with news of what was  happening.    One evening Bat said, 'There is a Baby in the Cave. He is new and pink  and fat and small, and the Woman is very fond of him.'    'Ah,' said the Cat, listening, 'but what is the Baby fond of?'    'He is fond of things that are soft and tickle,' said the Bat. 'He is  fond of warm things to hold in his arms when he goes to sleep. He is  fond of being played with. He is fond of all those things.'    'Ah,' said the Cat, listening, 'then my time has come.'    Next night Cat walked through the Wet Wild Woods and hid very near the  Cave till morning-time, and Man and Dog and Horse went hunting. The  Woman was busy cooking that morning, and the Baby cried and interrupted.  So she carried him outside the Cave and gave him a handful of pebbles to  play with. But still the Baby cried.    Then the Cat put out his paddy paw and patted the Baby on the cheek, and  it cooed; and the Cat rubbed against its fat knees and tickled it under  its fat chin with his tail. And the Baby laughed; and the Woman heard  him and smiled.    Then the Bat--the little upside-down bat--that hung in the mouth of the  Cave said, 'O my Hostess and Wife of my Host and Mother of my Host's  Son, a Wild Thing from the Wild Woods is most beautifully playing with  your Baby.'    'A blessing on that Wild Thing whoever he may be,' said the Woman,  straightening her back, 'for I was a busy woman this morning and he has  done me a service.'    That very minute and second, Best Beloved, the dried horse-skin  Curtain that was stretched tail-down at the mouth of the Cave fell  down--whoosh!--because it remembered the bargain she had made with the  Cat, and when the Woman went to pick it up--lo and behold!--the Cat was  sitting quite comfy inside the Cave.    'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of my Enemy,' said the Cat,  'it is I: for you have spoken a word in my praise, and now I can sit  within the Cave for always and always and always. But still I am the Cat  who walks by himself, and all places are alike to me.'    The Woman was very angry, and shut her lips tight and took up her  spinning-wheel and began to spin. But the Baby cried because the Cat had  gone away, and the Woman could not hush it, for it struggled and kicked  and grew black in the face.    'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of my Enemy,' said the Cat,  'take a strand of the wire that you are spinning and tie it to your  spinning-whorl and drag it along the floor, and I will show you a magic  that shall make your Baby laugh as loudly as he is now crying.'    'I will do so,' said the Woman, 'because I am at my wits' end; but I  will not thank you for it.'    She tied the thread to the little clay spindle whorl and drew it across  the floor, and the Cat ran after it and patted it with his paws and  rolled head over heels, and tossed it backward over his shoulder and  chased it between his hind-legs and pretended to lose it, and pounced  down upon it again, till the Baby laughed as loudly as it had been  crying, and scrambled after the Cat and frolicked all over the Cave till  it grew tired and settled down to sleep with the Cat in its arms.    'Now,' said the Cat, 'I will sing the Baby a song that shall keep him  asleep for an hour. And he began to purr, loud and low, low and loud,  till the Baby fell fast asleep. The Woman smiled as she looked down upon  the two of them and said, 'That was wonderfully done. No question but  you are very clever, O Cat.'    That very minute and second, Best Beloved, the smoke of the fire at the  back of the Cave came down in clouds from the roof--puff!--because  it remembered the bargain she had made with the Cat, and when it had  cleared away--lo and behold!--the Cat was sitting quite comfy close to  the fire.    'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of My Enemy,' said the Cat,  'it is I, for you have spoken a second word in my praise, and now I can  sit by the warm fire at the back of the Cave for always and always and  always. But still I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all places are  alike to me.'    Then the Woman was very very angry, and let down her hair and put more  wood on the fire and brought out the broad blade-bone of the shoulder of  mutton and began to make a Magic that should prevent her from saying  a third word in praise of the Cat. It was not a Singing Magic, Best  Beloved, it was a Still Magic; and by and by the Cave grew so still that  a little wee-wee mouse crept out of a corner and ran across the floor.    'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of my Enemy,' said the Cat,  'is that little mouse part of your magic?'    'Ouh! Chee! No indeed!' said the Woman, and she dropped the blade-bone  and jumped upon the footstool in front of the fire and braided up her  hair very quick for fear that the mouse should run up it.    'Ah,' said the Cat, watching, 'then the mouse will do me no harm if I  eat it?'    'No,' said the Woman, braiding up her hair, 'eat it quickly and I will  ever be grateful to you.'    Cat made one jump and caught the little mouse, and the Woman said,  'A hundred thanks. Even the First Friend is not quick enough to catch  little mice as you have done. You must be very wise.'    That very moment and second, O Best Beloved, the Milk-pot that stood by  the fire cracked in two pieces--ffft--because it remembered the bargain  she had made with the Cat, and when the Woman jumped down from the  footstool--lo and behold!--the Cat was lapping up the warm white milk  that lay in one of the broken pieces.    'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of my Enemy, said the Cat,  'it is I; for you have spoken three words in my praise, and now I can  drink the warm white milk three times a day for always and always and  always. But still I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all places are  alike to me.'    Then the Woman laughed and set the Cat a bowl of the warm white milk and  said, 'O Cat, you are as clever as a man, but remember that your bargain  was not made with the Man or the Dog, and I do not know what they will  do when they come home.'    'What is that to me?' said the Cat. 'If I have my place in the Cave by  the fire and my warm white milk three times a day I do not care what the  Man or the Dog can do.'    That evening when the Man and the Dog came into the Cave, the Woman  told them all the story of the bargain while the Cat sat by the fire and  smiled. Then the Man said, 'Yes, but he has not made a bargain with me  or with all proper Men after me.' Then he took off his two leather boots  and he took up his little stone axe (that makes three) and he fetched a  piece of wood and a hatchet (that is five altogether), and he set them  out in a row and he said, 'Now we will make our bargain. If you do not  catch mice when you are in the Cave for always and always and always, I  will throw these five things at you whenever I see you, and so shall all  proper Men do after me.'    'Ah,' said the Woman, listening, 'this is a very clever Cat, but he is  not so clever as my Man.'    The Cat counted the five things (and they looked very knobby) and he  said, 'I will catch mice when I am in the Cave for always and always and  always; but still I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all places are  alike to me.'    'Not when I am near,' said the Man. 'If you had not said that last I  would have put all these things away for always and always and always;  but I am now going to throw my two boots and my little stone axe (that  makes three) at you whenever I meet you. And so shall all proper Men do  after me!'    Then the Dog said, 'Wait a minute. He has not made a bargain with me or  with all proper Dogs after me.' And he showed his teeth and said, 'If  you are not kind to the Baby while I am in the Cave for always and  always and"]]]
