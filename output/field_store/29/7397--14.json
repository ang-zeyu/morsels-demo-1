Total includes the number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT  for those ships, and total GRT for those ships. DWT or dead weight  tonnage is the total weight of cargo, plus bunkers, stores, etc.,  that a ship can carry when immersed to the appropriate load line.  GRT or gross register tonnage is a figure obtained by measuring the  entire sheltered volume of a ship available for cargo and passengers  and converting it to tons on the basis of 100 cubic feet per ton;  there is no stable relationship between GRT and DWT.  Ships by type includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo  ships, cargo ships, chemical tankers, combination bulk carriers,  combination ore/oil carriers, container ships, liquefied gas  tankers, livestock carriers, multifunctional large-load carriers,  petroleum tankers, passenger ships, passenger/cargo ships, railcar  carriers, refrigerated cargo ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships,  short-sea passenger ships, specialized tankers, and vehicle carriers.  Foreign-owned are ships that fly the flag of one country but belong  to owners in another.  Registered in other countries are ships that belong to owners in one  country but fly the flag of another.    Military      This category includes the entries dealing with a country's military  structure, manpower, and expenditures.        Military - note      This entry includes miscellaneous military information of  significance not included elsewhere.        Military branches      This entry lists the service branches subordinate to defense  ministries or the equivalent (typically ground, naval, air, and  marine forces).        Military expenditures      This entry gives spending on defense programs for the most recent  year available as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP); the GDP  is calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in terms of  purchasing power parity (PPP).        Military service age and obligation      This entry gives the required ages for voluntary or conscript  military service and the length of service obligation.    Money figures      All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless  otherwise indicated.        N          National anthem      A generally patriotic musical composition - usually in the form of a  song or hymn of praise - that evokes and eulogizes the history,  traditions, or struggles of a nation or its people. National anthems  can be officially recognized as a national song by a country's  constitution or by an enacted law, or simply by tradition. Although  most anthems contain lyrics, some do not.        National holiday      This entry gives the primary national day of celebration - usually  independence day.        Nationality      This entry provides the identifying terms for citizens - noun and  adjective.        Natural gas - consumption      This entry is the total natural gas consumed in cubic meters (cu m).  The discrepancy between the amount of natural gas produced and/or  imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the  omission of stock changes and other complicating factors.        Natural gas - exports      This entry is the total natural gas exported in cubic meters (cu m).        Natural gas - imports      This entry is the total natural gas imported in cubic meters (cu m).        Natural gas - production      This entry is the total natural gas produced in cubic meters (cu m).  The discrepancy between the amount of natural gas produced and/or  imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the  omission of stock changes and other complicating factors.        Natural gas - proved reserves      This entry is the stock of proved reserves of natural gas in cubic  meters (cu m). Proved reserves are those quantities of natural gas,  which, by analysis of geological and engineering data, can be  estimated with a high degree of confidence to be commercially  recoverable from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and  under current economic conditions.        Natural hazards      This entry lists potential natural disasters. For countries where  volcanic activity is common, a volcanism subfield highlights  historically active volcanoes.        Natural resources      This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum, hydropower, and  other resources of commercial importance, such as rare earth  elements (REEs).        Net migration rate      This entry includes the figure for the difference between the number  of persons entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000  persons (based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering  the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56  migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the country  as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The net  migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the  overall level of population change. The net migration rate does not  distinguish between economic migrants, refugees, and other types of  migrants nor does it distinguish between lawful migrants and  undocumented migrants.        O          Oil - consumption      This entry is the total oil consumed in barrels per day (bbl/day).  The discrepancy between the amount of oil produced and/or imported  and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission of  stock changes, refinery gains, and other complicating factors.        Oil - exports      This entry is the total oil exported in barrels per day (bbl/day),  including both crude oil and oil products.        Oil - imports      This entry is the total oil imported in barrels per day (bbl/day),  including both crude oil and oil products.        Oil - production      This entry is the total oil produced in barrels per day (bbl/day).  The discrepancy between the amount of oil produced and/or imported  and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission of  stock changes, refinery gains, and other complicating factors.        Oil - proved reserves      This entry is the stock of proved reserves of crude oil in barrels  (bbl). Proved reserves are those quantities of petroleum which, by  analysis of geological and engineering data, can be estimated with a  high degree of confidence to be commercially recoverable from a  given date forward, from known reservoirs and under current economic  conditions.        P      People      This category includes the entries dealing with the characteristics  of the people and their society.        People - note      This entry includes miscellaneous demographic information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Personal Names - Capitalization      The Factbook capitalizes the surname or family name of individuals  for the convenience of our users who are faced with a world of  different cultures and naming conventions. The need for  capitalization, bold type, underlining, italics, or some other  indicator of the individual's surname is apparent in the following  examples: MAO Zedong, Fidel CASTRO Ruz, George W. BUSH, and TUNKU  SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz Shah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin Alam  Shah. By knowing the surname, a short form without all capital  letters can be used with confidence as in President Castro, Chairman  Mao, President Bush, or Sultan Tunku Salahuddin. The same system of  capitalization is extended to the names of leaders with surnames  that are not commonly used such as Queen ELIZABETH II. For  Vietnamese names, the given name is capitalized because officials  are referred to by their given name rather than by their surname.  For example, the president of Vietnam is Tran Duc LUONG. His surname  is Tran, but he is referred to by his given name - President LUONG.    Personal Names - Spelling      The romanization of personal names in the Factbook normally follows  the same transliteration system used by the US Board on Geographic  Names for spelling place names. At times, however, a foreign leader  expressly indicates a preference for, or the media or official  documents regularly use, a romanized spelling that differs from the  transliteration derived from the US Government standard. In such  cases, the Factbook uses the alternative spelling.    Personal Names - Titles      The Factbook capitalizes any valid title (or short form of it)  immediately preceding a person's name. A title standing alone is not  capitalized. Examples: President PUTIN and President BUSH are chiefs  of state. In Russia, the president is chief of state and the premier  is the head of the government, while in the US, the president is  both chief of state and head of government.    Petroleum      See entries under Oil.    Petroleum products      See entries under Oil.        Pipelines      This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for transporting  products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum products.    Piracy      Piracy is defined by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law  of the Sea as any illegal act of violence, detention, or depredation  directed against a ship, aircraft, persons, or property in a place  outside the jurisdiction of any State. Such criminal acts committed  in the territorial waters of a littoral state are generally  considered to be armed robbery against ships. Information on piracy  may be found, where applicable, in the Transportation - note.        Political parties and leaders      This entry includes a listing of significant political organizations  and their leaders.        Political pressure groups and leaders      This entry includes a listing of a country's political, social,  labor, or religious organizations that are involved in politics, or  that exert political pressure, but whose leaders do not stand for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35842"],[0,"Microscopes and Accessory Apparatus: Catalogue No. 40 (#14)"],[1,"\"        for dissections
