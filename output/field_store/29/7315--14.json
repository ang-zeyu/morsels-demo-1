He looked greatly surprised and asked me what I  was doing in his town.  The tone in which he spoke caused me to decide  that, after all, I would not keep the flag of Coamo.  I pulled it off my  saddle and said: \"General, it's too long a story to tell you now, but  here is the flag of the town.  It's the first Spanish flag\"--and it  was--\"that has been captured in Porto Rico.\"    General Wilson smiled again and accepted the flag.  He and about four  thousand other soldiers think it belongs to them.  But the truth will  out.  Some day the bestowal on the proper persons of a vote of thanks  from Congress, a pension, or any other trifle, like prize-money, will  show the American people to whom that flag really belongs.    I know that in time the glorious deed of the seven heroes of Coamo, or  eight, if you include \"Jimmy,\" will be told in song and story.  Some one  else will write the song.  This is the story.        IV--THE PASSING OF SAN JUAN HILL      When I was a boy I thought battles were fought in waste places selected  for the purpose.  I argued from the fact that when our school nine wished  to play ball it was forced into the suburbs to search for a vacant lot.  I thought opposing armies also marched out of town until they reached  some desolate spot where there were no window panes, and where their  cannon-balls would hurt no one but themselves.  Even later, when I saw  battles fought among villages, artillery galloping through a cornfield,  garden walls breached for rifle fire, and farm-houses in flames, it  always seemed as though the generals had elected to fight in such  surroundings through an inexcusable striving after theatrical effect--as  though they wished to furnish the war correspondents with a chance for  descriptive writing.  With the horrors of war as horrible as they are  without any aid from these contrasts, their presence always seemed not  only sinful but bad art; as unnecessary as turning a red light on the  dying gladiator.    There are so many places which are scenes set apart for battles--places  that look as though Nature had condemned them for just such sacrifices.  Colenso, with its bare kopjes and great stretch of veldt, is one of  these, and so, also, is Spion Kop, and, in Manchuria, Nan Shan Hill.  The  photographs have made all of us familiar with the vast, desolate  approaches to Port Arthur.  These are among the waste places of the  earth--barren, deserted, fit meeting grounds only for men whose object in  life for the moment is to kill men.  Were you shown over one of these  places, and told, \"A battle was fought here,\" you would answer, \"Why, of  course!\"    But down in Cuba, outside of Santiago, where the United States army  fought its solitary and modest battle with Spain, you might many times  pass by San Juan Hill and think of it, if you thought of it at all, as  only a pretty site for a bungalow, as a place obviously intended for  orchards and gardens.    On July 1st, twelve years ago, when the American army came upon it out of  the jungle the place wore a partial disguise.  It still was an irregular  ridge of smiling, sunny hills with fat, comfortable curves, and in some  places a steep, straight front.  But above the steepest, highest front  frowned an aggressive block-house, and on all the slopes and along the  sky-line were rows of yellow trenches, and at the base a cruel cat's  cradle of barbed wire.  It was like the face of a pretty woman behind the  bars of a visor.  I find that on the day of the fight twelve years ago I  cabled my paper that San Juan Hill reminded the Americans of \"a sunny  orchard in New England.\"  That was how it may have looked when the  regulars were climbing up the steep front to capture the block-house, and  when the cavalry and Rough Riders, having taken Kettle Hill, were running  down its opposite slope, past the lake, to take that crest of San Juan  Hill which lies to the right of the block-house.  It may then have looked  like a sunny New England orchard, but before night fell the intrenching  tools had lent those sunny slopes \"a fierce and terrible aspect.\"  And  after that, hour after hour, and day after day, we saw the hill eaten up  by our trenches, hidden by a vast laundry of shelter tents, and torn  apart by bomb-proofs, their jutting roofs of logs and broken branches  weighed down by earth and stones and looking like the pit mouths to many  mines.  That probably is how most of the American army last saw San Juan  Hill, and that probably is how it best remembers it--as a fortified camp.  That was twelve years ago.  When I revisited it, San Juan Hill was again  a sunny, smiling farm land, the trenches planted with vegetables, the  roofs of the bomb-proofs fallen in and buried beneath creeping vines, and  the barbed-wire entanglements holding in check only the browsing cattle.    San Juan Hill is not a solitary hill, but the most prominent of a ridge  of hills, with Kettle Hill a quarter of a mile away on the edge of the  jungle and separated from the ridge by a tiny lake.  In the local  nomenclature Kettle Hill, which is the name given to it by the Rough  Riders, has always been known as San Juan Hill, with an added name to  distinguish it from the other San Juan Hill of greater renown.    The days we spent on those hills were so rich in incident and interest  and were filled with moments of such excitement, of such pride in one's  fellow-countrymen, of pity for the hurt and dying, of laughter and  good-fellowship, that one supposed he might return after even twenty  years and recognize every detail of the ground.  But a shorter time has  made startling and confusing changes.  Now a visitor will find that not  until after several different visits, and by walking and riding foot by  foot over the hills, can he make them fall into line as he thinks he once  knew them.  Immediately around San Juan Hill itself there has been some  attempt made to preserve the ground as a public park.  A barbed-wire  fence, with a gateway, encircles the block-house, which has been  converted into a home for the caretaker of the park, and then, skirting  the road to Santiago to include the tree under which the surrender was  arranged, stretches to the left of the block-house to protect a monument.  This monument was erected by Americans to commemorate the battle.  It is  now rapidly falling to pieces, but there still is enough of it intact to  show the pencilled scribblings and autographs of tourists who did not  take part in the battle, but who in this public manner show that they  approve of its results.  The public park is less than a quarter of a mile  square.  Except for it no other effort has been made either by Cubans or  Americans to designate the lines that once encircled and menaced  Santiago, and Nature, always at her best under a tropical sun, has done  all in her power to disguise and forever obliterate the scene of the  army's one battle.  Those features which still remain unchanged are very  few.  The Treaty Tree, now surrounded by a tall fence, is one, the  block-house is another.  The little lake in which, even when the bullets  were dropping, the men used to bathe and wash their clothes, the big iron  sugar kettle that gave a new name to Kettle Hill, and here and there a  trench hardly deeper than a ploughed furrow, and nearly hidden by growing  plants, are the few landmarks that remain.    Of the camps of Generals Chaffee, Lawton, Bates, Sumner, and Wheeler, of  Colonels Leonard Wood and Theodore Roosevelt, there are but the slightest  traces.  The Bloody Bend, as some call it, in the San Juan River, as some  call that stream, seems to have entirely disappeared.  At least, it  certainly was not where it should have been, and the place the hotel  guides point out to unsuspecting tourists bears not the slightest  physical resemblance to that ford.  In twelve years, during one of which  there has been in Santiago the most severe rainfall in sixty years, the  San Juan stream has carried away its banks and the trees that lined them,  and the trails that should mark where the ford once crossed have so  altered and so many new ones have been added, that the exact location of  the once famous dressing station is now most difficult, if not  impossible, to determine.  To establish the sites of the old camping  grounds is but little less difficult.  The head-quarters of General  Wheeler are easy to recognize, for the reason that the place selected was  in a hollow, and the most unhealthy spot along the five miles of  intrenchments.  It is about thirty yards from where the road turns to  rise over the ridge to Santiago, and all the water from the hill pours  into it as into a rain barrel.  It was here that Troop G, Third Cavalry,  under Major Hardee, as it was Wheeler's escort, was forced to bivouac,  and where one-third of its number came down with fever.  The camp of  General Sam Sumner was some sixty yards to the right of the head-quarters  of General Wheeler, on the high shoulder of the hill just above the camp  of the engineers, who were on the side of the road opposite.  The camps  of Generals Chaffee, Lawton, Hawkins, Ludlow, and the positions and  trenches taken and held by the different regiments under them one can  place only relatively.  One reason for this is that before our army  attacked the hills all the underbrush and small trees that might conceal  the advance of our men had been cleared away by the Spaniards, leaving  the hill, except for the high crest, comparatively bare.  To-day the  hills are thick with young trees and enormous bushes.  The alteration in  the landscape is as marked as is the difference between ground cleared  for golf and the same spot planted with corn and fruit-trees.

CHAPTER X.    HYGIENE OF THE MUSCLES      173. _The muscles should be used, in order that the size and strength  of these organs may be adequate to the demand made upon them._ It is a  law of the system that the action and power of an organ are  commensurate, to a certain extent, with the demand made upon it; and  it is a law of the muscular system that, whenever a muscle is called  into frequent use, its fibres increase in thickness within certain  limits, and become capable of acting with greater force; while, on the  contrary, the muscle that is little used decreases in size and power.    _Illustrations._ 1st. The blacksmith uses and rests the muscles of his  arm when striking upon the anvil. They not only increase in size, but  become very firm and hard.    2d. The student uses the muscles of the arm but little, in holding his  books and pen; they not only become small, but soft.    3d. Let the student leave his books, and wield an iron sledge, and the  muscles of his arm will increase in size and firmness. On the other  hand, let the blacksmith assume the student's vocation, and the  muscles of his arm will become soft and less firm.    174. _When the muscles are called into action, the flow of blood in  the arteries and veins is increased._ The increased flow of blood in  the arteries and veins, causes a more rapid deposition of the  particles of matter of which the muscles are composed. If the  exercise is adequate to the power of the system, the deposit of new  material will exceed in quantity the particles of matter removed, and  both the size and energy of the muscles are increased. But there is a  limit to the muscles becoming strong by labor. Sooner or later, man  will attain his growth or power; yet by judicious exercise, care, and  discreet management, the greatest power of the muscles may be  preserved until advanced age.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    173-211. _Give the hygiene of the muscles._ 173. What is necessary  that muscles may attain size and strength? Give a law of the muscular  system. Show this by practical illustrations. 174. Why do muscles  increase in size when exercised?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    175. _The muscles are lessened in size and diminished in power when  the exercise is continued so as to produce a feeling of exhaustion._  The loss of material, in this instance, will exceed the deposition of  the atoms of matter. This is seen in the attenuated frames of  over-tasked domestic animals, as the horse. The same truth is  illustrated by the laborious agriculturist, who, in consequence of too  severe toil while gathering the products of the field, frequently  diminishes his weight several pounds in a few weeks. Exercise, either  for pleasure or profit, may fatigue, yet it should never be protracted  to languor or exhaustion, if the individual desires \"a green old  age.\"    176. _The same amount of exercise will not conduce to the health of  all individuals._ If riding or walking one mile causes slight fatigue,  this may be beneficial; while, by travelling two miles, the exhaustion  may be highly injurious. Exercise and labor should be adapted to the  strength of particular individuals. How little soever the strength,  that must be the measure of exertion. Any other rule would be fatal to  the hopes of invigorating the system, either by exercise or labor.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    Is there a limit to the muscles becoming powerful by action? How may  the strength of muscles be kept until advanced age? 175. What is the  effect when exercise is continued until there is a feeling of  exhaustion? Give a practical illustration. What rule is mentioned in  regard to exercise? 176. Can all persons take the same amount of  exercise? What rule is given as to the amount of exercise?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    177. _Relaxation must follow contraction, or, in other words, rest  must follow exercise._ The necessity of relaxation, when a muscle has  been called into action, is seen in the example of a boy extending his  arm with a book in his hand, as a penalty. The boy can keep the arm  extended but a short time, make what effort he may. It is also seen in  the restlessness and feverish excitement that are evinced by persons  gazing on troops during days of review. The same is noted in shopping.  Such employments call into action the muscles that support the spinal  column in an erect position, and the languor or uneasiness is muscular  pain. The long-continued tension of a muscle enfeebles its action, and  eventually destroys its contractility.    178. _In school, the small children, after sitting a short time,  become restless._ If their position be changed, their imperfectly  developed muscles will acquire tone, and will again support the spinal  column erect without pain. The necessity for frequent recesses in  school, is founded on the organic law of muscular action alternating  with rest. The younger and feebler pupils are, the greater the  necessity for frequent recesses. We would not have the teacher think  that one half of the time should be spent in recesses; or the mother,  that her daughter is going to school to play. But we do maintain that  recesses should be given, and that they should be short and frequent,  especially for small and feeble scholars.    179. _Exhaustion is the inevitable result of continued muscular  contraction._ For example, let a lady ply the needle quickly for some  hours, and the muscles of the back and right arm will become  exhausted, which will be indicated by a sense of weariness in these  parts. A change of employment and position calls into action a  different set of muscles, and the exhausted organs are relieved.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    177. What is said of the contraction and relaxation of the muscles?  Give examples of the necessity of relaxing the muscles. 178. Why  should not small children be confined in one position for a long time?  What evils result from this practice? What class of pupils should have  recesses most frequently? 179. What effect has continued muscular  contraction?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    180. _Much more labor will be accomplished by taking time to relax the  exhausted muscles_, or by so changing the employment as to bring into  action a new set of muscles; the woodman thus relieves himself, by  sawing and splitting alternately. This principle applies to the labor  of the horse and ox; and it is also applicable to all kinds of  employment. With the invalid convalescing from fever, relapses result  from inattention to these laws. When a patient is recovering from  sickness, his physician should take care that his exercise be proper,  neither too much, too little, nor too long continued.    181. _The muscles of growing youths will not endure so much exercise  or labor as those of mature men._ In youth a portion of the vital, or  nervous energy of the system, is expended upon the growth of the  organs of the body, while in the individual who has attained his  growth, this expenditure is not demanded; consequently severe labor or  exercise should not be imposed on growing children.    _Observation._ In the campaigns of Napoleon Bonaparte, his army was  frequently recruited by mere boys. He complained to the French  government, because he was not supplied with men of mature years, as  the youths could not endure the exertion of his forced marches.    182. _The muscles should be gradually called into action._ These  organs in action require more blood and nervous fluid than when at  rest. As the circulation of these fluids can only be increased in a  gradual manner, it follows, that, when the muscular system has been in  a state of rest, it should not suddenly be called into vigorous  action. On arising from a bed, lounge, or chair, the first movements  of the limbs should be slow, and then gradually increased.    _Observation._ if a man has a certain amount of work to perform in  nine hours, and his muscles have been in a state of rest, he will do  it with less fatigue by performing half the amount of the labor in  five hours, and the remainder in four hours. The same principle should  be regarded in driving horses and other beasts of burden.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    180. How can the greatest amount of labor be secured with the least  exhaustion to the muscles? 181. Why should not severe labor be imposed  on growing children? 182. How should the muscles be called into  action?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    183. _The muscles should be rested gradually, when they have been  vigorously used._ If a person has been making great muscular exertion  in cutting wood, or any other employment, instead of sitting down to  rest, he should continue muscular action, for a short time, by some  moderate labor or"]]]
