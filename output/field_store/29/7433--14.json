Last, but by no means least, are the Stegosaurs, or plated lizards, for  not only were they beasts of goodly size, but they were among the most  singular of all known animals, singular even for Dinosaurs. They had  diminutive heads, small fore legs, long tails armed on either side near  the tip, with two pairs of large spines, while from these spines to the  neck ran series of large, but thin, and sharp-edged plates standing  on edge, so that their backs looked like the bottom of a boat provided  with a number of little centreboards. Just how these plates were  arranged is not decided beyond a peradventure, but while originally  figured as having them in a single series down the back it seems much  more probable that they formed parallel rows.    [Illustration: Fig. 23.--The Horned Ceratosaurus. A Carnivorous  Dinosaur. _From a drawing by J. M. Gleeson._]    The largest of these plates were two feet in height and length, and not  more than an inch thick, except at the base, where they were enlarged  and roughened to give a firm hold to the thick skin in which they were  imbedded. Be it remembered, too, that these plates and spines were  doubtless covered with horn, so that they were even longer in life than  as we now see them. The tail spines varied in length, according to the  species, from eight or nine inches to nearly three feet, and some of  them have a diameter of six inches at the base. They were swung by a  tail eight to ten feet long, and as a visitor was heard to remark, one  wouldn't like to be about such an animal in fly time.    Such were some of the strange and mighty animals that once roamed this  continent from the valley of the Connecticut, where they literally left  their footprints on the sands of time, to the Rocky Mountains, where the  ancient lakes and rivers became cemeteries for the entombment of their  bones.    The labor of the collector has gathered their fossil remains from many a  Western canyon, the skill of the preparator has removed them from their  stony sepulchres and the study of the anatomist has restored them as  they were in life.      _REFERENCES._    _Most of our large museums have on exhibition fine specimens of many  Dinosaurs, comprising skulls, limbs, and large portions of their  skeletons. The American Museum of Natural History, New York, has the  largest and finest display. The first actual skeleton of a Dinosaur to  be mounted in this country was the splendid Claosaurus at the Yale  University Museum, where other striking pieces are also to be seen. The  mounting of this Claosaurus, which is 29 feet long and 13 feet high,  took an entire year. The United States National Museum is  particularly rich in examples of the great, horned Triceratops, while  the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh, has the best Diplodocus. The Field  Columbian Museum and the Universities of Wyoming and Colorado all have  good collections._    [Illustration: Fig. 24.--Stegosaurus. An Armored Dinosaur of the  Jurassic. _From a drawing by Charles R. Knight._]    _The largest single bone of a Dinosaur is the thigh bone of a  Brontosaurus in the Field Columbian Museum, this measuring 6 feet 8  inches in length. The height of a complete hind leg in the American  Museum of Natural History is 10 feet, while a single claw measures 6 by  9 inches. The skeleton of Triceratops restored in papier-mache for the  Pan-American Exposition measured 25 feet from tip of nose to end of tail  and was 10 feet 6 inches to the top of the backbone over the hips, this  being the highest point. The head in the United States National Museum  used as a model is 5 feet 6 inches long in a straight line and 4 feet 3  inches across the frill. There is a skull in the Yale University Museum  even larger than this._    _Articles relating to Dinosaurs are mostly technical in their nature and  scattered through various scientific journals. The most accessible  probably is \"The Dinosaurs of North America,\" by Professor O. C. Marsh,  published as part of the sixteenth annual report of the United States  Geological Survey. This contains many figures of the skulls, bones, and  entire skeletons of many Dinosaurs._    [Illustration: Fig. 25.--Skull of Ceratosaurus. _From a specimen in the  United States National Museum._]          VII    READING THE RIDDLES OF THE ROCKS        \"_And the first Morning of Creation wrote      What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read._\"      It is quite possible that the reader may wish to know something of the  manner in which the specimens described in these pages have been  gathered, how we acquire our knowledge of Brontosaurus, Claosaurus, or  any of the many other \"sauruses,\" and how their restorations have been  made.    There was a time, not so very long ago, when fossils were looked upon as  mere sports of Nature, and little attention paid to them; later their  true nature was recognized, though they were merely gathered haphazard  as occasion might offer. But now, and for many years past, the  fossil-bearing rocks of many parts of the world have been systematically  worked, and from the material thus obtained we have acquired a great  deal of information regarding the inhabitants of the ancient world. This  is particularly true of our own western country, where a vast amount of  collecting has been done, although very much remains to be done in the  matter of perfecting this knowledge, and hosts of new animals remain to  be discovered. For this information we are almost as much indebted to  the collector who has gathered the needed material, and the preparator  whose patience and skill have made it available for study, as to the  palaeontologist who has interpreted the meaning of the bones.    To collect successfully demands not only a knowledge of the rocks in  which fossils occur and of the localities where they are best exposed to  view, but an eye quick to detect a piece of bone protruding from a rock  or lying amongst the shale, and, above all, the ability to work a  deposit to advantage after it has been found. The collector of living  animals hies to regions where there is plenty for bird and beast to eat  and drink, but the collector of extinct animals cares little for what is  on the surface of the earth; his great desire is to see as much as  possible of what may lie beneath. So the prospector in search of fossils  betakes himself to some region where the ceaseless warfare waged by  water against the dry land has seamed the face of the earth with  countless gullies and canyons, or carved it into slopes and bluffs in  which the edges of the bone-bearing strata are exposed to view, and  along these he skirts, ever on the look-out for some projecting bit of  bone. The country is an almost shadeless desert, burning hot by day,  uncomfortably cool at night. Water is scarce, and when it can be found,  often has little to commend it save wetness; but the collector is buoyed  up through all this with the hope that he may discover some creature new  to science that shall not only be bigger and uglier and stranger than  any heretofore found, but shall be the long-sought form needed for the  solution of some difficult problem in the history of the past.    Now collecting is a lottery, differing from most lotteries, however, in  that while some of the returns may be pretty small, there are few  absolute blanks and some remarkably large prizes, and every collector  hopes that it may fall to his lot to win one of these, and is willing to  work long and arduously for the chance of obtaining it.    It may give some idea of the chances to say that some years ago Dr.  Wortman spent almost an entire season in the field without success, and  then, at the eleventh hour, found the now famous skeleton of Phenacodus,  or that a party from Princeton actually camped within 100 yards of a  rich deposit of rare fossils and yet failed to discover it.    Let us, however, suppose that the reconnaissance has been successful,  and that an outcrop of bone has been found, serving like a tombstone  carven with strange characters to indicate the burial-place of some  primeval monster. Possibly Nature long ago rifled the grave, washing  away much of the skeleton, and leaving little save the fragments visible  on the surface; on the other hand, these pieces may form part of a  complete skeleton, and there is no way to decide this important question  save by actual excavation. The manner of disinterment varies, but much  depends on whether the fossil lies in comparatively loose shale or is  imbedded in the solid rock, whether the strata are level or dip downward  into the hillside. If, unfortunately, this last is the case, it  necessitates a careful shoring up of the excavation with props of  cotton-wood or such boards as may have been brought along to box  specimens, or it may even be necessary to run a short tunnel in order to  get at some coveted bone. Should the specimen lie in shale, as is the  case with most of the large reptiles that have been collected, much of  that work may be done with pick and shovel; but if it is desirable or  necessary to work in firm rock, drills and hammers, wedges, even powder,  may be needed to rend from Nature her long-kept secrets. In any event, a  detailed plan is made of the excavation, and each piece of bone or  section of rock duly recorded therein by letter and number, so that  later on the relation of the parts to one another may be known, or the  various sections assembled in the work-room exactly as they lay in the  quarry. Bones which lie in loose rock are often, one might say usually,  more or less broken, and when a bone three, four, or even six feet  long, weighing anywhere from 100 to 1,000 pounds, has been shattered to  fragments the problem of removing it is no easy one."]]]
