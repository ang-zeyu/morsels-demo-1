It is rash to  doubt so good an observer, but this conclusion must I think be an error;  and it may perhaps be accounted for by the nature of the genera observed by  him, for he admits that the tendency differs in different genera. The  statement is also directly contradicted by Naudin's observations, and by  the notorious fact that perfectly fertile mongrels exhibit the tendency in  a high degree,--even in a higher degree, according to Gaertner himself,  than hybrids.[114]    Gaertner further states that reversions rarely occur with {50} hybrid  plants raised from species which have not been cultivated, whilst, with  those which have been long cultivated, they are of frequent occurrence.  This conclusion explains a curious discrepancy: Max Wichura,[115] who  worked exclusively on willows, which had not been subjected to culture,  never saw an instance of reversion; and he goes so far as to suspect that  the careful Gaertner had not sufficiently protected his hybrids from the  pollen of the parent-species: Naudin, on the other hand, who chiefly  experimented on cucurbitaceous and other cultivated plants, insists more  strenuously than any other author on the tendency to reversion in all  hybrids. The conclusion that the condition of the parent-species, as  affected by culture, is one of the proximate causes leading to reversion,  agrees fairly well with the converse case of domesticated animals and  cultivated plants being liable to reversion when they become feral; for in  both cases the organisation or constitution must be disturbed, though in a  very different way.    Finally, we have seen that characters often reappear in purely-bred races  without our being able to assign any proximate cause; but when they become  feral this is either indirectly or directly induced by the change in their  conditions of life. With crossed breeds, the act of crossing in itself  certainly leads to the recovery of long-lost characters, as well as of  those derived from either parent-form. Changed conditions, consequent on  cultivation, and the relative position of buds, flowers, and seeds on the  plant, all apparently aid in giving this same tendency. Reversion may occur  either through seminal or bud generation, generally at birth, but sometimes  only with an advance of age. Segments or portions of the individual may  alone be thus affected. That a being should be born resembling in certain  characters an ancestor removed by two or three, and in some cases by  hundreds or even thousands of generations, is assuredly a wonderful fact.  In these cases the child is commonly said to inherit such characters  directly from its grandparents or more remote ancestors. But this view is  hardly conceivable. If, however, we suppose that every character is derived  {51} exclusively from the father or mother, but that many characters lie  latent in both parents during a long succession of generations, the  foregoing facts are intelligible. In what manner characters may be  conceived to lie latent, will be considered in a future chapter to which I  have lately alluded.           *       *       *       *       *    _Latent Characters._--But I must explain what is meant by characters lying  latent. The most obvious illustration is afforded by secondary sexual  characters. In every female all the secondary male characters, and in every  male all the secondary female characters, apparently exist in a latent  state, ready to be evolved under certain conditions. It is well known that  a large number of female birds, such as fowls, various pheasants,  partridges, peahens, ducks, &c., when old or diseased, or when operated on,  partly assume the secondary male characters of their species. In the case  of the hen-pheasant this has been observed to occur far more frequently  during certain seasons than during others.[116] A duck ten years old has  been known to assume both the perfect winter and summer plumage of the  drake.[117] Waterton[118] gives a curious case of a hen which had ceased  laying, and had assumed the plumage, voice, spurs, and warlike disposition  of the cock; when opposed to an enemy she would erect her hackles and show  fight. Thus every character, even to the instinct and manner of fighting,  must have lain dormant in this hen as long as her ovaria continued to act.  The females of two kinds of deer, when old, have been known to acquire  horns; and, as Hunter has remarked, we see something of an analogous nature  in the human species.    On the other hand, with male animals, it is notorious that the secondary  sexual characters are more or less completely lost when they are subjected  to castration. Thus, if the operation be performed on a young cock, he  never, as Yarrell states, crows {52} again; the comb, wattles, and spurs do  not grow to their full size, and the hackles assume an intermediate  appearance between true hackles and the feathers of the hen. Cases are  recorded of confinement alone causing analogous results. But characters  properly confined to the female are likewise acquired; the capon takes to  sitting on eggs, and will bring up chickens; and what is more curious, the  utterly sterile male hybrids from the pheasant and the fowl act in the same  manner, \"their delight being to watch when the hens leave their nests, and  to take on themselves the office of a sitter.\"[119] That admirable observer  Reaumur[120] asserts that a cock, by being long confined in solitude and  darkness, can be taught to take charge of young chickens; he then utters a  peculiar cry, and retains during his whole life this newly acquired  maternal instinct. The many well-ascertained cases of various male mammals  giving milk, show that their rudimentary mammary glands retain this  capacity in a latent condition.    We thus see that in many, probably in all cases, the secondary characters  of each sex lie dormant or latent in the opposite sex, ready to be evolved  under peculiar circumstances. We can thus understand how, for instance, it  is possible for a good milking cow to transmit her good qualities through  her male offspring to future generations; for we may confidently believe  that these qualities are present, though latent, in the males of each  generation. So it is with the game-cock, who can transmit his superiority  in courage and vigour through his female to his male offspring; and with  man it is known [121] that diseases, such as hydrocele, necessarily  confined to the male sex, can be transmitted through the female to the  grandson. Such cases as these offer, as was remarked at the commencement of  this chapter, the simplest possible examples of reversion; and they are  intelligible on the belief that characters common to the grandparent and  grandchild of the same sex are present, though latent, in the intermediate  parent of the opposite sex.    The subject of latent characters is so important, as we shall see in a  future chapter, that I will give another illustration. {53} Many animals  have the right and left sides of their body unequally developed: this is  well known to be the case with flat-fish, in which the one side differs in  thickness and colour, and in the shape of the fins, from the other; and  during the growth of the young fish one eye actually travels, as shown by  Steenstrup, from the lower to the upper surface.[122] In most flat-fishes  the left is the blind side, but in some it is the right; though in both  cases \"wrong fishes,\" which are developed in a reversed manner to what is  usual, occasionally occur, and in _Platessa flesus_ the right or left side  is indifferently developed, the one as often as the other. With gasteropods  or shell-fish, the right and left sides are extremely unequal; the far  greater number of species are dextral, with rare and occasional reversals  of development, and some few are normally sinistral; but certain species of  Bulimus, and, many Achatinellae,[123] are as often sinistral as dextral. I  will give an analogous case in the great Articulate kingdom: the two sides  of Verruca[124] are so wonderfully unlike, that without careful dissection  it is extremely difficult to recognise the corresponding parts on the  opposite sides of the body; yet it is apparently a mere matter of chance  whether it be the right or the left side that undergoes so singular an  amount of change. One plant is known to me[125] in which the flower,  according as it stands on the one or other side of the spike, is unequally  developed. In all the foregoing cases the two sides of the animal are  perfectly symmetrical at an early period of growth. Now, whenever a species  is as liable to be unequally developed on the one as on the other side, we  may infer that the capacity for such development is present, though latent,  in the undeveloped side. And as a reversal of development occasionally  occurs in animals of many kinds, this latent capacity is probably very  common.    The best yet simplest instances of characters lying dormant are, perhaps,  those previously given, in which chickens and {54} young pigeons, raised  from a cross between differently coloured birds, are at first of one  colour, but in a year or two acquire feathers of the colour of the other  parent; for in this case the tendency to a change of plumage is clearly  latent in the young bird. So it is with hornless breeds of cattle, some of  which acquire, as they grow old, small horns. Purely bred black and white  bantams, and some other fowls, occasionally assume, with advancing years,  the red feathers of the parent-species. I will here add a somewhat  different case, as it connects in a striking manner latent characters of  two classes. Mr. Hewitt[126] possessed an excellent Sebright gold-laced hen  bantam, which, as she became old, grew diseased in her ovaria, and assumed  male characters. In this breed the males resemble the females in all  respects except in their combs, wattles, spurs,"]]]
