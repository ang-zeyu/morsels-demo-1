He, Lieutenant McGuire, was a traitor  against his will!    The screen was blank, and the lights of the room came on to show the  thin lips that smiled complacently in a cruel and evil face.    McGuire glared back into that face, and he tried with all the mental  force that he could concentrate to get across to the exultant one the  fact that they had not wholly conquered him. This much they had got--but  no more!    The thin-lipped one had an instrument in his hand, and McGuire felt the  prick of a needle plunged into his arm. He tried to move his head and  found himself powerless. And now, in the darkness of the room where all  lights were again extinguished, the helpless man was fighting the most  horrible of battles, and the battleground was within his own mind. He  was two selves, and he fought and struggled with all his consciousness  to keep those memories from flooding him.    With one part of himself he knew what it meant: a sure knowledge given  these invaders of what they must prepare to meet; he was betraying his  country; the whole of humanity! And that raging, raving self was  powerless to check the flow of memory pictures that went endlessly  through his mind and out upon the screen beyond....    He had no sense of time; he was limp and exhausted with his fruitless  struggle when he felt himself released from the bondage of the metal  straps and placed again in the hammock in his room. And he could only  look wanly and hopelessly after the figure of Professor Sykes, carried  by barbarous figures to the same ordeal.           *       *       *       *       *    Sleep, through the long night, restored both McGuire and his companion  to normal strength. The flyer was seated with his head bowed low in his  cupped hands. His words seemed wrung from an agony of spirit. \"So that's  what they brought us here for,\" he said harshly; \"that's why they're  keeping us alive!\"    Professor Sykes walked back and forth in their bare room while he shook  his impotent fists in the air.    \"I told them everything,\" he exploded; \"everything!\" Their astronomical  knowledge must be limited; under this blanket of clouds they can see  nothing, and from their ships they could make approximations only.    \"And I have told them--the earth, and its days and seasons--its orbital  velocity and motion--its relation to the orbit of this accursed planet.  They had documents from the observatory and I explained them; I  corrected their time of firing their big gun on its equatorial position.  Oh, there is little I left untold--damn them!\"    \"I wish to heaven,\" said the flyer savagely, \"that we had known; we  would have jumped out of their beastly ship somehow ten thousand feet  up, and we would have taken our information with us.\"    Sykes nodded agreement. \"Well,\" he asked, \"how about to-morrow, and the  next day, and the next? They will want more facts; they will pump the  last drop of information from us. Are we going to allow it?\"           *       *       *       *       *    McGuire's tone was dry. \"You know the answer to that as well as I do. We  have just two alternatives; either we get out of here--find some place  to hide in, then find some way to put a crimp in their plans; or we get  out of here for good. It's twenty feet, not twenty thousand, from that  window to the ground, but I think a head-first dive would do it.\"    Sykes did not reply at once; he seemed to be weighing some problem in  his mind.    \"I would prefer the water,\" he said at last. \"If we _can_ get away and  reach the shore, and if there is not a possibility of escape--which I  must admit I consider highly improbable--well, we can always swim out as  far as we can go, and the result will be certain.    \"This other is so messy.\" The man had stopped his ceaseless pacing, and  he even managed a cheerful smile at the lieutenant. \"And, remember, it  might only cripple us and leave us helpless in their hands.\"    \"Sounds all right to me,\" McGuire agreed, and there was a tone of  finality in his voice as he added: \"They've made us do that traitor act  for the last time, anyway.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Daylight comes slowly through cloud-filled skies; the window of the  room where the fountain sprayed ceaselessly was showing the first hint  of gold in the eastern sky. Above was the utter darkness of the  cloud-wrapped night as the two men swung noiselessly out into the  grotesque branches of a tree to make their way into the gloom below.  There, under the cover of great leaves, they crouched in silence, while  the darkness about them faded and a sound of subdued whistling noises  came to them from the night.    A wheel creaked, and in the dim light two figures appeared tugging at a  cart upon which was a cage of woven wire. Beyond them, against the  darker background of denser growth, tentacles coiled and twisted above  the row of guardian plants that surrounded the house.    One of the ghostly forms reached within the cage and brought forth a  struggling object that whimpered in fear. The low whine came distinctly  to the hidden men. They saw a vague black thing tossed through the air  and toward the deadly plants; they heard the swishing of pliant  tentacles and the yelping cry of a frightened animal. And the cry rose  to a shriek that ended with the gulping splash of thick liquid.    The giant pod next in line was open--they could see it dimly--and its  tentacles were writhing convulsively, hungrily, across the ground.  Another animal was taken from the cage and thrown to the waiting,  serpent forms that closed about and whirled it high in air. Another--and  another! The yelps of terror grew faint in the distance as the monsters  passed on in their gruesome work. And the two men, palpitant with  memories of their own experience, were limp and sick with horror.           *       *       *       *       *    In the growing light they saw more plainly the fleshy, pliant arms that  whipped through the air or felt searchingly along the ground. No hope  there for bird or beast that passed by in the night; nor for men, as  they knew too well. But now, as the golden light increased, the arms  drew back to form again the tight-wound coils that flattened themselves  beside the monstrous pods whose lips were closing. Locked within them  were the pools of liquid that could dissolve a living body into food for  these vampires of the vegetable world.    \"Damnable!\" breathed Sykes in a savage whisper. \"Utterly damnable! And  this world is peopled with such monsters!\"    The last deadly arm was tightly coiled when the men stole off through  the lush growth that reached even above their heads. McGuire remembered  the outlines he had seen from the air and led the way where, if no  better concealment could be found, the ocean waited with promise of rest  and release from their inhuman captors.    They counted on an hour's start--it would be that long before their  jailer would come with their morning meal and give the alarm--and now  they went swiftly and silently through the stillness of a strange world.  The air that flicked misty-wet across their faces was heavy and heady  with the perfume of night-blooming plants. Crimson blossoms flung wide  their odorous petals, and the first golden light was filtered through  tremendous tree-growths of pale lavenders and grays to show as unreal  colors in the vegetation close about them.           *       *       *       *       *    They found no guards; the isolation of this island made the land itself  their prison, and the men ran at full speed through every open space,  knowing as they ran that there was no refuge for them--only the ocean  waiting at the last. But their flight was not unobserved.    A great bird rose screaming from a tangle of vines; its heavy, flapping  wings flashed red against the pale trees. A pandemonium of shrieking  cries echoed its alarm as other birds took flight; the forest about them  was in an uproar of harsh cries. And faintly, from far in the rear, came  a babel of shrill calls--weird, inhuman!--the voices of the men-things  of Venus.    \"It's all off,\" said McGuire sharply; \"they'll be on our trail now!\" He  plunged through where the trees were more open, and Sykes was beside him  as they ran with a burst of speed toward a hilltop beyond.    They paused, panting, upon the crest. A wide expanse of foliage in  delicate shadings swept out before them to wave gently in a sea of color  under the morning breeze, and beyond was another sea that beckoned with  white breakers on a rocky shore.    \"The ocean!\" gasped Sykes, and pointed a trembling hand toward their  goal. \"But--I had no idea--that suicide--was--such hard work!\"    The tall figure of Lieutenant McGuire turned to the shorter, breathless  man, and he gripped hard at one of his hands.    \"Sykes,\" he said, \"I'll never get another chance to say it--but you're  one good scout!... Come on!\"           *       *       *       *       *    McGuire fought to force his way through jungle growth, while screaming  birds marked where they went. The sounds of their pursuers were close  behind them when the two tore their way through the last snarled tangle  of pale vine to stand on a sheer bluff, where, below, deep waters  crashed against a rocky wall. They staggered with weariness and gulped  sobbingly of the morning air. McGuire could have sworn he was exhausted  beyond any further effort, yet from somewhere he summoned energy to  spring savagely upon a tall, blood-red figure whose purpling face rose  suddenly to confront them.    One hand closed upon the metal tube that the other hand raised, and,  with his final reserve of strength, the flyer wrapped an arm about the  tall body and rushed it stumblingly toward the cliff. To be balked  now!--to be brought back to that intolerable prison and the unthinkable  role of traitor! The khaki-clad figure wrenched furiously at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/307"],[0,"Three Elephant Power, and Other Stories (#14)"],[1,"themselves out of the  difficulties they had themselves created.    A couple of rounds narrowed the competitors down to a few, and the task  of deciding was entered on.    \"I have kept a record,\" said the little man, \"of how they jumped each  fence, and I give them points for style of jumping, and for their make  and shape and hunting qualities. The way I bring it out is that Homeward  Bound is the best, with Gaslight second.\"    \"Homeward Bound!\" said the fat man. \"Why, the pace he went wouldn't head  a duck. He didn't go as fast as a Chinaman could trot with two baskets  of stones. I want to have three of 'em in to have another look at  'em.\" Here he looked surreptitiously at his cuff, saw a note \"No. II.\",  mistook it for \"Number Eleven\", and said: \"I want Number Eleven to go  another round.\"    The leggy, weedy chestnut, with the terrified amateur up, came sidling  and snorting out into the ring. The fat man looked at him with scorn.    \"What is that fiddle-headed brute doing in the ring?\" he said.    \"Why,\" said the ring steward, \"you said you wanted him.\"    \"Well,\" said the fat man, \"if I said I wanted him I do want him. Let him  go the round.\"    The terrified amateur went at his fences with the rashness of despair,  and narrowly escaped being clouted off on two occasions. This put the  fat man in a quandary. He had kept no record, and all the horses were  jumbled up in his head; but he had one fixed idea, to give the first  prize to Gaslight; as to the second he was open to argument. From sheer  contrariness he said that Number Eleven would be \"all right if he were  rode better,\" and the squatter agreed. The little man was overruled, and  the prizes went--Gaslight, first; Spite, second; Homeward Bound, third.    The crowd hooted loudly as Spite's rider came round with the second  ribbon, and small boys suggested to the fat judge in shrill tones that  he ought to boil his head. The fat man stalked majestically into the  stewards' stand, and on being asked how he came to give Spite the  second prize, remarked oracularly: \"I judge the 'orse, I don't judge the  rider.\" This silenced criticism, and everyone adjourned to have a drink.    Over the flowing bowl the fat man said: \"You see, I don't believe in  this nonsense about points. I can judge 'em without that.\"    Twenty dissatisfied competitors vowed they would never bring another  horse there in their lives. Gaslight's owner said: \"Blimey, I knew it  would be all right with old Billy judging. 'E knows this 'orse.\"          THE DOG      The dog is a member of society who likes to have his day's work, and who  does it more conscientiously than most human beings. A dog always looks  as if he ought to have a pipe in his mouth and a black bag for his  lunch, and then he would go quite happily to office every day.    A dog without work is like a man without work, a nuisance to himself and  everybody else. People who live about town, and keep a dog to give the  children hydatids and to keep the neighbours awake at night, imagine  that the animal is fulfilling his destiny. All town dogs, fancy dogs,  show dogs, lap-dogs, and other dogs with no work to do, should be  abolished; it is only in the country that a dog has any justification  for his existence.    The old theory that animals have only instinct, not reason, to guide  them, is knocked endways by the dog. A dog can reason as well as a human  being on some subjects, and better on others, and the best reasoning dog  of all is the sheep-dog. The sheep-dog is a professional artist with a  pride in his business. Watch any drover's dogs bringing sheep into  the yards. How thoroughly they feel their responsibility, and how very  annoyed they get if a stray dog with no occupation wants them to stop  and fool about! They snap at him and hurry off, as much as to say: \"You  go about your idleness. Don't you see this is my busy day?\"    Sheep-dogs are followers of Thomas Carlyle. They hold that the only  happiness for a dog in this life is to find his work and to do it. The  idle, 'dilettante', non-working, aristocratic dog they have no use for.    The training of a sheep-dog for his profession begins at a very early  age. The first thing is to take him out with his mother and let him see  her working. He blunders lightheartedly, frisking along in front of the  horse, and his owner tries to ride over him, and generally succeeds. It  is amusing to see how that knocks all the gas out of a puppy, and with  what a humble air he falls to the rear and glues himself to the horse's  heels, scarcely daring to look to the right or to the left, for fear of  committing some other breach of etiquette.    He has had his first lesson--to keep behind the horse until he is  wanted. Then he watches the old slut work, and is allowed to go with her  round the sheep; and if he shows any disposition to get out of hand  and frolic about, the old lady will bite him sharply to prevent his  interfering with her work.    By degrees, slowly, like any other professional, he learns his business.  He learns to bring sheep after a horse simply at a wave of the hand;  to force the mob up to a gate where they can be counted or drafted;  to follow the scent of lost sheep, and to drive sheep through a town  without any master, one dog going on ahead to block the sheep from  turning off into by-streets while the other drives them on from the  rear.    How do they learn all these things? Dogs for show work are taught  painstakingly by men who are skilled in handling them; but, after all,  they teach themselves more than the men teach them. It looks as if the  acquired knowledge of generations were transmitted from dog to dog.  The puppy, descended from a race of sheep-dogs, starts with all his  faculties directed towards the working of sheep; he is half-educated  as soon as he is born. He can no more help working sheep than a born  musician can help being musical, or a Hebrew can help gathering in  shekels. It is bred in him. If he can't get sheep to work, he will  work a fowl; often and often one can see a collie pup painstakingly and  carefully driving a bewildered old hen into a stable, or a stock-yard,  or any other enclosed space on which he has fixed his mind. How does he  learn to do that? He didn't learn it at all. The knowledge was born with  him.    When the dog has been educated, or has educated himself, he enjoys his  work; but very few dogs like work \"in the yards\". The sun is hot,  the dust rises in clouds, and there is nothing to do but bark, bark,  bark--which is all very well for learners and amateurs, but is beneath  the dignity of the true professional sheep-dog. When they are hoarse  with barking and nearly choked with dust, the men lose their tempers and  swear at them, and throw clods of earth at them, and sing out to them  \"Speak up, blast you!\"    Then the dogs suddenly decide that they have done enough for the day.  Watching their opportunity, they silently steal over the fence, and  hide in any cool place they can find. After a while the men notice that  hardly any are left, and operations are suspended while a great hunt is  made into outlying pieces of cover, where the dogs are sure to be found  lying low and looking as guilty as so many thieves. A clutch at the  scruff of the neck, a kick in the ribs, and they are hauled out of  hiding-places; and accompany their masters to the yard frolicking about  and pretending that they are quite delighted to be going back, and  only hid in those bushes out of sheer thoughtlessness. He is a champion  hypocrite, is the dog.    Dogs, like horses, have very keen intuition. They know when the men  around them are frightened, though they may not know the cause. In a  great Queensland strike, when the shearers attacked and burnt Dagworth  shed, some rifle-volleys were exchanged. The air was full of human  electricity, each man giving out waves of fear and excitement. Mark now  the effect it had on the dogs. They were not in the fighting; nobody  fired at them, and nobody spoke to them; but every dog left his master,  left the sheep, and went away to the homestead, about six miles off.  There wasn't a dog about the shed next day after the fight. The noise of  the rifles had not frightened them, because they were well-accustomed to  that.*         * The same thing happened constantly with horses in the       South African War. A loose horse would feed contentedly       while our men were firing, but when our troops were being       fired at the horses became uneasy, and the loose ones would       trot away. The excitement of the men communicated itself to       them.    Dogs have an amazing sense of responsibility. Sometimes, when there are  sheep to be worked, an old slut who has young puppies may be greatly  exercised in her mind whether she should go out or not. On the one hand,  she does not care about leaving the puppies, on the other, she feels  that she really ought to go rather than allow the sheep to be knocked  about by those learners. Hesitatingly, with many a look behind her, she  trots out after the horses and the other dogs. An impassioned appeal  from the head boundary rider, \"Go back home, will yer!\" is treated with  the contempt it deserves. She goes out to the yards, works, perhaps half  the day, and then slips quietly under the fences and trots off home,  contented.          THE DOG--AS A SPORTSMAN      The sheep-dog and the cattle-dog are the workmen of the animal kingdom;  sporting and fighting dogs are the professionals and artists.    A house-dog or a working-dog will only work for his master; a  professional or artistic dog will work for anybody, so long as he is  treated like an artist. A man going away for a week's shooting can  borrow a dog, and the dog will work for him loyally, just as a good  musician will do his best, though the conductor is strange to him, and  the other members of the band are not up to the mark. The musician's  art is sacred to him,"]]]
