Here he is! Isn't he splendid!\" and she lifted Phronsie  up to the big post where she could see finely.    \"O-oh! ow!\" screamed little Phronsie, \"see him, Polly! just see him!\"    A man with an organ was standing in the middle of the road playing away  with all his might, and at the end of a long rope was a lively little  monkey in a bright red coat and a smart cocked hat. The little creature  pulled off his hat, and with one long jump coming on the fence, he made  Phronsie a most magnificent bow. Strange to say, the child wasn't in the  least frightened, but put out her little fat hand, speaking in gentle  tones, \"Poor little monkey! come here, poor little monkey!\"    Turning up his little wrinkled face, and glancing fearfully at his  master, Jocko began to grimace and beg for something to eat. The man  pulled the string and struck up a merry tune, and in a minute the monkey  spun around and around at such a lively pace, and put in so many queer  antics that the little audience were fairly convulsed with laughter.    \"I can't pay you,\" said Mrs. Pepper, wiping her eyes, when at last the  man pulled up the strap whistling to Jocko to jump up, \"but I'll give  you something to eat; and the monkey, too, he shall have something for  his pains in amusing my children.\"    The man looked very cross when she brought him out only brown bread and  two cold potatoes.    \"Haven't you got nothin' better'n that?\"    \"It's as good as we have,\" answered Mrs. Pepper.    The man threw down the bread in the road. But Jocko thankfully ate his  share, Polly and Phronsie busily feeding him; and then he turned and  snapped up the portion his master had left in the dusty road.    Then they moved on, Mrs. Pepper and Polly going back to their work in  the kitchen. A little down the road the man struck up another tune.  Phronsie who had started merrily to tell \"Baby\" all about it, stopped a  minute to hear, and--she didn't go back to the orchard!    About two hours after, Polly said merrily:    \"I'm going to call Phronsie in, mammy; she must be awfully tired and  hungry by this time.\"    She sang gayly on the way, \"I'm coming, Phronsie, coming--why, where!--\"  peeping under the tree.    \"Baby\" lay on its face disconsolately on the ground--and the orchard was  empty! Phronsie was gone!    \"It's no use,\" said Ben, to the distracted household and such of the  neighbors as the news had brought hurriedly to the scene, \"to look any  more around here--but somebody must go toward Hingham; he'd be likely to  go that way.\"    \"No one could tell where he would go,\" cried Polly, wringing her hands.    \"But he'd change, Ben, if he thought folks would think he'd gone there,\"  said Mrs. Pepper.    \"We must go all roads,\" said Ben, firmly; \"one must take the stage to  Boxville, and I'll take Deacon Brown's wagon on the Hingham road, and  somebody else must go to Toad Hollow.\"    \"I'll go in the stage,\" screamed Joel, who could scarcely see out of his  eyes, he had cried so; \"I'll find--find her--I know.    \"Be spry, then, Joe, and catch it at the corner!\"    Everybody soon knew that little Phronsie Pepper had gone off with \"a  cross organ man and an awful monkey!\" and in the course of an hour  dozens of people were out on the hot, dusty roads in search.    \"What's the matter?\" asked a testy old gentleman in the stage, of Joel  who, in his anxiety to see both sides of the road at once, bobbed the  old gentleman in the face so often as the stage lurched, that at last he  knocked his hat over his eyes.    \"My sister's gone off with a monkey,\" explained Joel, bobbing over to  the other side, as he thought he caught sight of something pink that  he felt sure must be Phronsie's apron. \"Stop! stop! there she is!\"  he roared, and the driver, who had his instructions and was fully in  sympathy, pulled up so suddenly that the old gentleman flew over into  the opposite seat.    \"Where?\"    But when they got up to it Joel saw that it was only a bit of pink  calico flapping on a clothes-line; so he climbed back and away they  rumbled again.    The others were having the same luck. No trace could be found of the  child. To Ben, who took the Hingham road, the minutes seemed like hours.    \"I won't go back,\" he muttered, \"until I take her. I can't see mother's  face!\"    But the ten miles were nearly traversed; almost the last hope was gone.  Into every thicket and lurking place by the road-side had he peered--but  no Phronsie! Deacon Brown's horse began to lag.    \"Go on!\" said Ben hoarsely; \"oh, dear Lord, make me find her!\"    The hot sun poured down on the boy's face, and he had no cap. What cared  he for that? On and on he went. Suddenly the horse stopped. Ben doubled  up the reins to give him a cut, when \"WHOA!\" he roared so loud that the  horse in very astonishment gave a lurch that nearly flung him headlong.  But he was over the wheel in a twinkling, and up with a bound to a small  thicket of scrubby bushes on a high hill by the road-side. Here lay a  little bundle on the ground, and close by it a big, black dog; and over  the whole, standing guard, was a boy a little bigger than Ben, with  honest gray eyes. And the bundle was Phronsie!    \"Don't wake her up,\" said the boy, warningly, as Ben, with a hungry look  in his eyes, leaped up the hill, \"she's tired to death!\"    \"She's my sister!\" cried Ben, \"our Phronsie!\"    \"I know it,\" said the boy kindly; \"but I wouldn't wake her up yet if I  were you. I'll tell you all about it,\" and he took Ben's hand which was  as cold as ice.          SAFE      \"It's all right, Prince,\" the boy added, encouragingly to the big dog  who, lifting his noble head, had turned two big eyes steadily on Ben.  \"He's all right! lie down again!\"    Then, flinging himself down on the grass, he told Ben how he came to  rescue Phronsie.    \"Prince and I were out for a stroll,\" said he. \"I live over in Hingham,\"  pointing to the pretty little town just a short distance before them in  the hollow; \"that is,\" laughing, \"I do this summer. Well, we were out  strolling along about a mile below here on the cross-road; and all of a  sudden, just as if they sprung right up out of the ground, I saw a man  with an organ, and a monkey, and a little girl, coming along the road.  She was crying, and as soon as Prince saw that, he gave a growl, and  then the man saw us, and he looked so mean and cringing I knew there  must be something wrong, and I inquired of him what he was doing with  that little girl, and then she looked up and begged so with her eyes,  and all of a sudden broke away from him and ran towards me screaming--'I  want Polly!' Well, the man sprang after her; then I tell you--\" here the  boy forgot his caution about waking Phronsie--\"we went for him, Prince  and I! Prince is a noble fellow,\" (here the dog's ears twitched very  perceptibly) \"and he kept at that man; oh! how he bit him! till he had  to run for fear the monkey would get killed.\"    \"Was Phronsie frightened?\" asked Ben; \"she's never seen strangers.\"    \"Not a bit,\" said the boy, cheerily; \"she just clung to me like  everything--I only wish she was my sister,\" he added impulsively.    \"What were you going to do with her if I hadn't come along?\" asked Ben.    \"Well, I got out on the main road,\" said the boy, \"because I thought  anybody who had lost her, would probably come through this way; but if  somebody hadn't come, I was going to carry her in to Hingham; and the  father and I'd had to contrive some way to do.\"    \"Well,\" said Ben, as the boy finished and fastened his bright eyes on  him, \"somebody did come along; and now I must get her home about as fast  as I can for poor mammy--and Polly!\"    \"Yes,\" said the boy, \"I'll help you lift her; perhaps she won't wake  up.\"    The big dog moved away a step or two, but still kept his eye on  Phronsie.    \"There,\" said the boy, brightly, as they laid the child on the wagon  seat; \"now when you get in you can hold her head; that's it,\" he added,  seeing them both fixed to his satisfaction. But still Ben lingered.    \"Thank you,\" he tried to say.    \"I know,\" laughed the boy; \"only it's Prince instead of me,\" and he  pulled forward the big black creature, who had followed faithfully down  the hill to see the last of it. \"To the front, sir, there! We're coming  to see you,\" he continued, \"if you will let us--where do you live?\"    \"Do come,\" said Ben, lighting up, for he was just feeling he couldn't  bear to look his last on the merry, honest face; \"anybody'll tell you  where Mrs. Pepper lives.\"    \"Is she a Pepper?\" asked the boy, laughing, and pointing to the  unconscious little heap in the wagon; \"and are you a Pepper?\"    \"Yes,\" said Ben, laughing too. \"There are five of us besides mother.    \"Jolly! that's something like! Good-bye! Come on, Prince!\" Then away  home to mother! Phronsie never woke up or turned over once till she was  put, a little pink sleepy heap, into her mother's arms. Joel was there,  crying bitterly at his forlorn search. The testy old gentleman in the  seat opposite had relented and ordered the coach about and brought  him home in an outburst of grief when all hope was gone. And one after  another they all had come back, disheartened, to the distracted mother.  Polly alone, clung to hope!    \"Ben will bring her, mammy; I know God will let him,\" she whispered.    But when Ben did bring her, Polly, for the second time in her life,  tumbled over with a gasp,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27713"],[0,"The Elements of Bacteriological Technique (#14)"],[1,"formation may be  examined by higher powers than can be brought to bear on the living  cultivation. They are prepared from plate cultivations (_vide_ page 230)  in the following manner.    1. Remove a clean cover-slip from the alcohol pot with sterile forceps  and burn off the spirit.    2. Open the plate and rest one edge of the cover-slip on the surface of  the medium a little to one side of the selected colony. Lower it  cautiously over the colony until horizontal. Avoid any lateral movement  or the inclusion of bubbles of air.    3. Make gentle vertical pressure on the centre of the cover-slip with  the points of the forceps to ensure perfect contact with the colony.    4. Steady one edge of the cover-slip with the forceps and pass the point  of a mounted needle just under the opposite edge and raise the  cover-slip carefully; the colony will be adherent to it. When nearly  vertical, grasp the cover-slip with the forceps and remove it from the  plate. Re-cover the plate.    5. Place the cover-slip, film uppermost, on the rubber mat, and cover  it with an inverted watch-glass until dry.    6. Fix by immersing in one of the fixing fluids previously mentioned  (_vide_ page 82).    7. Clear with acetic acid and alcohol.    8. Stain and mount as an ordinary cover-slip film preparation, being  careful to perform all washing operations with extreme gentleness.    ~Microscopical Examination of the Unstained Specimens.~--    1. Place the body tube of the microscope in the vertical position.    2. Arrange the hanging-drop slide on the microscope stage so that the  drop of fluid is in the optical axis of the instrument, and secure it in  that position by means of the spring clips.    3. Use the 1/6-inch objective, rack down the body tube until the front  lens of the objective is almost in contact with the cover-slip--that is,  well within its focal distance. This is best done whilst bending down  the head to one side of the microscope, so that the eyes are on a level  with the stage.    4. Apply the eye to the ocular and adjust the plane mirror to the  position which secures the best illumination.    5. Rack the condenser down slightly and cut down the aperture of the  iris diaphragm so that the light, although even, is dim.    6. Rack up the body tube by means of the coarse adjustment until the  bacteria come into view; then focus exactly by means of the fine  adjustment.    Some difficulty is often experienced at first in finding the hanging  drop, and if the first attempt is unsuccessful, the student must not on  any account, whilst still applying his eye to the ocular, rack the body  tube down (for by so doing there is every likelihood of the front lens  of the objective being forced through the cover-glass, and not only  spoiling the specimen, but also contaminating the objective); but, on  the contrary, withdraw his eye, rack the tube up, and commence again  from step 2.      ~Dark Ground Illumination.~--    1. Set up the microscope stand in the vertical position and insert the  highest eyepiece available.    2. Remove the nosepiece from the microscope tube and fit the 2/3 inch  objective in place.    3. Remove the substage condenser and replace it by the dark ground  condenser.    4. Fit up the source of illumination some 30-50 cm. distant from the  microscope. (This should be the Liliput Arc Lamp (Leitz), Nernst Lamp or  incandescent gas lamp; if either of the two latter are employed, a  bull's eye condenser to produce parallel rays must be interposed between  light and microscope); and adjust illuminant and microscope so that the  substage plane mirror is completely filled with light.    5. Focus the two concentric rings engraved upon the upper surface of the  condenser and centre them accurately by means of the centring screws.    6. Prepare a \"fresh\" specimen (see pages 74-76) of the material it is  desired to observe, using selected, new, 3 by 1 glass slips of less than  1 mm. thickness, and No. 1 cover-glasses (0.17 mm. thick), which should  be cleaned with a piece of soft washleather and not with the emery  paper, as scratches on the glass produce haziness in the preparation.    7. Deposit a large drop of immersion oil (or pure water) on the upper  surface of the condenser and rack it down a few millimetres.    8. Adjust the fresh preparation on the microscope stage and fasten it in  position with the stage clips.    9. Rack up the condenser until the immersion fluid makes contact with  the under surface of the slide; avoid the formation of air bubbles.    10. Adjust the substage mirror so that the light is reflected upward. A  bright spot will be seen on the fresh preparation near the centre of the  field.    11. Replace the 2/3-inch objective by the 1/12-inch oil immersion lens  which has been fitted with the special stop to reduce its N. A.; place a  drop of immersion oil upon the centre of the cover-glasses of the fresh  preparation and lower the microscope tube until the front lens of the  objective has entered the oil drop.    12. Focus the bright spot referred to in step 10. If it no longer  occupies the centre of the field, alter the angle of the substage mirror  until it does.    13. Now focus the lens accurately on the film, cautiously vary the  height of the dark ground condenser until the best position is found.  The intensely illuminated bacteria will stand out in vivid contrast to  the dark background.    [Illustration: FIG. 70.--Immersion oil bottle.]    ~Microscopical Examination of the Stained Specimen.~--(The body tube of  the microscope may be vertical or inclined to an angle.)    1. Secure the slide on the stage of the microscope by means of the  spring clips.    2. Place a drop of cedarwood oil on the centre of the cover-slip.         The immersion oil is pure cedarwood oil, and is kept in a       small bottle of stout glass (Fig. 70), the cavity of which       is shaped like an inverted cone, and is provided with a       safety funnel (so that the oil does not escape if the bottle       is accidentally overturned) and a dust cap of boxwood fitted       with a wooden rod with which the drop of oil is applied to       the cover-glass or lens.    3. Use the 1/12-inch oil immersion lens of the microscope. Rack down the  body tube till the front lens of the objective is in contact with the  oil and nearly touching the cover-slip.    4. Rack up the condenser until it is in contact with the under surface  of the slide.    5. Apply the eye to the ocular and arrange the plane mirror so as to  obtain the greatest possible amount of light.    6. Rack up the body tube until the stained film comes into view.    7. Focus the condenser accurately on the film.    8. Focus the film accurately by means of the fine adjustment.          VI. STAINING METHODS.      In the following pages are collected the various \"stock\" stains in  everyday use in the bacteriological laboratory, together with a  selection of the most convenient and generally useful staining methods  for demonstrating particular structures or differentiating groups of  bacteria. The stains employed should either be those prepared by  Gruebler, of Leipzig, or Merck, of Darmstadt. The methods printed in  ordinary type are those which a long experience has shown to be the most  reliable, and to give the best results--those relegated to small type  comprise such as are not so generally useful, but give excellent results  in the hands of the experienced worker.
