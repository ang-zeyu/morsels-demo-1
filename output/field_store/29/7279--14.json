[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2849"],[0,"Against Apion (#14)"],[1," them to be of Egyptian original,  when he lies also about himself? for although he was born at Oasis  in Egypt, he pretends to be, as a man may say, the top man of all the  Egyptians; yet does he forswear his real country and progenitors, and by  falsely pretending to be born at Alexandria, cannot deny the [4] pravity  of his family; for you see how justly he calls those Egyptians whom he  hates, and endeavors to reproach; for had he not deemed Egyptians to  be a name of great reproach, he would not have avoided the name of an  Egyptian himself; as we know that those who brag of their own countries  value themselves upon the denomination they acquire thereby, and reprove  such as unjustly lay claim thereto. As for the Egyptians' claim to be of  our kindred, they do it on one of the following accounts; I mean, either  as they value themselves upon it, and pretend to bear that relation  to us; or else as they would draw us in to be partakers of their own  infamy. But this fine fellow Apion seems to broach this reproachful  appellation against us, [that we were originally Egyptians,] in order  to bestow it on the Alexandrians, as a reward for the privilege they had  given him of being a fellow citizen with them: he also is apprized of  the ill-will the Alexandrians bear to those Jews who are their fellow  citizens, and so proposes to himself to reproach them, although he must  thereby include all the other Egyptians also; while in both cases he is  no better than an impudent liar.    4. But let us now see what those heavy and wicked crimes are which Apion  charges upon the Alexandrian Jews. \"They came [says he] out of Syria,  and inhabited near the tempestuous sea, and were in the neighborhood of  the dashing of the waves.\" Now if the place of habitation includes any  thing that is reproached, this man reproaches not his own real country,  [Egypt,] but what he pretends to be his own country, Alexandria; for all  are agreed in this, that the part of that city which is near the sea is  the best part of all for habitation. Now if the Jews gained that part of  the city by force, and have kept it hitherto without impeachment, this  is a mark of their valor; but in reality it was Alexander himself that  gave them that place for their habitation, when they obtained equal  privileges there with the Macedonians. Nor call I devise what Apion  would have said, had their habitation been at Necropolis? and not been  fixed hard by the royal palace [as it is]; nor had their nation had  the denomination of Macedonians given them till this very day [as they  have]. Had this man now read the epistles of king Alexander, or those  of Ptolemy the son of Lagus, or met with the writings of the succeeding  kings, or that pillar which is still standing at Alexandria, and  contains the privileges which the great [Julius] Caesar bestowed upon  the Jews; had this man, I say, known these records, and yet hath the  impudence to write in contradiction to them, he hath shown himself to  be a wicked man; but if he knew nothing of these records, he hath shown  himself to be a man very ignorant: nay, when lie appears to wonder how  Jews could be called Alexandrians, this is another like instance of his  ignorance; for all such as are called out to be colonies, although they  be ever so far remote from one another in their original, receive their  names from those that bring them to their new habitations. And what  occasion is there to speak of others, when those of us Jews that dwell  at Antioch are named Antiochians, because Seleucns the founder of that  city gave them the privileges belonging thereto? After the like manner  do those Jews that inhabit Ephesus, and the other cities of Ionia, enjoy  the same name with those that were originally born there, by the grant  of the succeeding princes; nay, the kindness and humanity of the Romans  hath been so great, that it hath granted leave to almost all others to  take the same name of Romans upon them; I mean not particular men only,  but entire and large nations themselves also; for those anciently named  Iberi, and Tyrrheni, and Sabini, are now called Romani. And if Apion  reject this way of obtaining the privilege of a citizen of Alexandria,  let him abstain from calling himself an Alexandrian hereafter; for  otherwise, how can he who was born in the very heart of Egypt be an  Alexandrian, if this way of accepting such a privilege, of which he  would have us deprived, be once abrogated? although indeed these  Romans, who are now the lords of the habitable earth, have forbidden the  Egyptians to have the privileges of any city whatsoever; while this fine  fellow, who is willing to partake of such a privilege himself as he is  forbidden to make use of, endeavors by calumnies to deprive those of it  that have justly received it; for Alexander did not therefore get some  of our nation to Alexandria, because he wanted inhabitants for this  his city, on whose building he had bestowed so much pains; but this was  given to our people as a reward, because he had, upon a careful trial,  found them all to have been men of virtue and fidelity to him; for, as  Hecateus says concerning us, \"Alexander honored our nation to such a  degree, that, for the equity and the fidelity which the Jews exhibited  to him, he permitted them to hold the country of Samaria free from  tribute. Of the same mind also was Ptolemy the son of Lagus, as to those  Jews who dwelt at Alexandria.\" For he intrusted the fortresses of Egypt  into their hands, as believing they would keep them faithfully and  valiantly for him; and when he was desirous to secure the government of  Cyrene, and the other cities of Libya, to himself, he sent a party of  Jews to inhabit in them. And for his successor Ptolemy, who was called  Philadelphus, he did not only set all those of our nation free who were  captives under him, but did frequently give money [for their ransom];  and, what was his greatest work of all, he had a great desire of  knowing our laws, and of obtaining the books of our sacred Scriptures;  accordingly, he desired that such men might be sent him as might  interpret our law to him; and, in order to have them well compiled, he  committed that care to no ordinary persons, but ordained that Demetrius  Phalereus, and Andreas, and Aristeas; the first, Demetrius, the most  learned person of his age, and the others, such as were intrusted with  the guard of his body; should take care of this matter: nor would he  certainly have been so desirous of learning our law, and the philosophy  of our nation, had he despised the men that made use of it, or had he  not indeed had them in great admiration.    5. Now this Apion was unacquainted with almost all the kings of those  Macedonians whom he pretends to have been his progenitors, who were yet  very well affected towards us; for the third of those Ptolemies, who was  called Euergetes, when he had gotten possession of all Syria by force,  did not offer his thank-offerings to the Egyptian gods for his victory,  but came to Jerusalem, and according to our own laws offered many  sacrifices to God, and dedicated to him such gifts as were suitable to  such a victory: and as for Ptolemy Philometer and his wife Cleopatra,  they committed their whole kingdom to the Jews, when Onias and  Dositheus, both Jews, whose names are laughed at by Apion, were the  generals of their whole army. But certainly, instead of reproaching  them, he ought to admire their actions, and return them thanks for  saving Alexandria, whose citizen he pretends to be; for when these  Alexandrians were making war with Cleopatra the queen, and were in  danger of being utterly ruined, these Jews brought them to terms of  agreement, and freed them from the miseries of a civil war. \"But then  [says Apion] Onias brought a small army afterward upon the city at the  time when Thorruns the Roman ambassador was there present.\" Yes, do I  venture to say, and that he did rightly and very justly in so doing;  for that Ptolemy who was called Physco, upon the death of his brother  Philometer, came from Cyrene, and would have ejected Cleopatra as well  as her sons out of their kingdom, that he might obtain it for himself  unjustly. [5] For this cause then it was that Onias undertook a war  against him on Cleopatra's account; nor would he desert that trust the  royal family had reposed in him in their distress. Accordingly, God gave  a remarkable attestation to his righteous procedure; for when Ptolemy  Physco [6] had the presumption to fight against Onias's army, and had  caught all the Jews that were in the city [Alexandria], with their  children and wives, and exposed them naked and in bonds to his  elephants, that they might be trodden upon and destroyed, and when  he had made those elephants drunk for that purpose, the event proved  contrary to his preparations; for these elephants left the Jews who were  exposed to them, and fell violently upon Physco's friends, and slew  a great number of them; nay, after this Ptolemy saw a terrible ghost,  which prohibited his hurting those men; his very concubine, whom  he loved so well, [some call her Ithaca, and others Irene,] making  supplication to him, that he would not perpetrate so great a wickedness.  So he complied with her request, and repented of what he either had  already done, or was about to do; whence it is well known that the  Alexandrian Jews do with good reason celebrate this day, on the account  that they had thereon been vouchsafed such an evident deliverance from  God. However, Apion, the common calumniator of men, hath the presumption  to accuse the Jews for making this war against Physco, when he ought  to have commended them for the same. This man also makes mention of  Cleopatra, the last queen of Alexandria, and abuses us, because she was  ungrateful to us; whereas he ought to have reproved her, who indulged  herself in all kinds of injustice and wicked practices, both with regard "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28491"],[0,"Dishes & Beverages of the Old South (#14)"],[1,"greatly in the fine art. Better buy your cake, or hire the making  thereof, else swap work with some other person better gifted in this  special branch.    Here are a few cardinal helps. Have the eggs very cold, butter soft but  not oily, flour dry and light--sun or oven-dry it in muggy weather. Sift  it three times for ordinary cakes, twice for tea cakes, and so on, four  to five times for very light things, sponge cake, angel's food, and  measure it before sifting, and don't forget the needed amount--then you  will be in no danger of putting in too much or too little. Always put a  pinch of fine salt in the bottom of the mixing bowl, which ought to be  freshly scalded and wiped very dry. A damp bowl clogs with either sugar  or flour, making the stirring much harder. Unless specifically directed  otherwise, separate the eggs, set the whites on ice till time to whip  them, beat the yolks very, very light--to a pale, frothy yellow, add the  sugar, free of lumps, a cupful at a time, then the butter washed and  beaten to a creamy froth, beat hard together for five minutes, then add  alternately the flour and the egg-whites beaten to the stiffest possible  froth. Add a pinch of salt as beating begins, and if the egg supply is  scant, a teaspoonful of cold water to each white. This will increase the  quantity, and help to make the cake lighter, as it is the air-bubbles  imprisoned in the froth which give it its raising virtue. Add fruit and  flavoring last thing. Fruit should be well floured but never clotted. If  batter appears to be too stiff a little whiskey thins it excellently,  and helps to make it lighter. Put in two tablespoonfuls to six eggs,  using more in proportion. Rose water or a liqueur have the same effect  but give their own flavor--which whiskey does not.    If strong butter needs must be used, it can be mitigated to a degree, by  washing and kneading well in cold water barely dashed with chloride of  lime solution, then rinsing well in cold water, and afterward in sweet  milk. The milk may be half water. Rinse it out clean. Let the butter  soften well before undertaking to cream it. A stout, blunt wooden spoon  is the best for creaming, along with a deep bowl very narrow at the  bottom. Grease deep cake tins plentifully, with either lard or  butter--using only the best. For heavy cakes such as fruit, spice and  marble cake, line them with double thicknesses of buttered paper and  either set shallow pans of water in the oven while baking or stand the  pans themselves in other pans with a quarter inch of water in the  bottoms. If cakes brown too fast, open the oven door, a trifle, and lay  over the pan a thick, well buttered paper until the oven cools. Never  jar the oven while cake is baking in it--neither by banging the doors,  nor dumping heavy vessels on top of it. Beware likewise slamming kitchen  doors, or bumping things about in the room. Fine cake demands as many  virtues of omission as of commission. Indeed the don'ts are as essential  as the doings.    Layer cakes need to be mixed thinner than deep ones. The batter must run  freely. Half fill the tins and set in a hot oven, taking care not to  scorch before rising is finished. Butter tins very freely--it is  economy in the end. Be sure the tins sit level in the oven--thus you  escape an ungainly final loaf. Get filling ready as baking goes forward  so as to put your layers together while still warm and pliable. Let cool  before frosting, so as to trim sides smooth. Take care fillings are not  too watery, also that they are mixed smooth. Spread evenly, and press  down a layer firmly all over, before putting filling on top. Layers  simplify greatly the problem of baking, but to my mind, no layer cake,  not even the famous Lady Baltimore, is equal to a fine deep loaf, well  frosted, and meltingly rich throughout.    _Pound Cake_: (Aunt Polly Rives) Take ten fresh eggs, their weight in  fresh butter, white sugar, and thrice sifted flour. Separate the eggs,  beat yolks to a cream-yellow, add the sugar, cupful at a time, beat  hard, then the butter creamed to a froth, then half the flour, then two  wineglasses of whiskey or brandy or good sherry or rose water, beat hard  five minutes, then add the rest of the flour, taking care not to pack  it in the handling. Beat fifteen minutes longer, then fold in with long  strokes, the egg-whites beaten with a good pinch of salt until they  stick to the dish. Barely mix them through the batter, then pour it into  deep pans, or ovens, lined with double greased papers. The vessels also  must be well buttered. Bake with quick heat, letting the cake rise well  before browning. Slack heat when it is a very light brown, and cook  until a straw thrust to the bottom comes out clean. Turn out upon a  thick, folded cloth, cover with another thinner cloth, and let cool.  Frost when cool, either with the boiled frosting directed for  cheesecakes (See Chapter on Paste, Pies and Puddings) or with plain  frosting made thus. Beat three egg-whites well chilled to the stiffest  possible froth with a pinch of salt, and a very little cold water. Add  to them gradually when thus beaten a pound of sugar sifted with a  teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Mix very smooth, and apply with a  broad-bladed knife, dipping it now and then in cold water to keep the  frosting smooth. It should dry a quarter-inch thick and be delicious  eating. Frosted cake keeps fresh three times as long as that left naked.    _Spice Cake_: Cream a coffee cup of well washed butter, with two cups  yellow sugar and one cup black molasses. Add to it one after the other,  seven egg-yolks, beating hard between. When all are in, add one  tablespoonful whiskey, or brandy, one teaspoonful grated chocolate,  teaspoonful each of powdered cloves, allspice, ginger, mace, and  cinnamon, a grated nutmeg, and half a saltspoonful of powdered black  pepper. Add also a pinch of salt, and the barest dusting of paprika. If  whiskey is for any reason disapproved, use strong, clear coffee instead,  putting in two spoonfuls, and leaving out the chocolate. Beat all  together hard for ten minutes, then add four scant cups flour browned in  the oven but not burned. Sift after browning, adding to it two  teaspoonfuls baking powder. Beat hard five minutes after the flour is  all in, then pour in a deep, well greased pan, lined with buttered  paper, let rise ten minutes with the oven door open, then bake in quick  heat until done through.    _Marble Cake_: Make up egg-yolks into spice cake, beat the whites very  light, and add them to three cups of sifted sugar, beaten smooth in a  large cup of creamed butter. Put in a wineglass of whiskey or brandy,  then add three cups and a half flour sifted three times with a heaping  teaspoonful baking powder. Put the light and dark batter by alternate  spoonfuls in pans well buttered and papered, let rise and bake the same  as spice cake. Else bake the light and dark batter in layers, put  together with any good filling, and frost with caramel frosting.    _Real Gold Cake_: Beat very light the yolks of sixteen eggs, with a full  pound of yellow sugar, and a scant pound of creamed butter. Add a cup of  rich sour cream with a teaspoonful soda dissolved in it. Or if you like  better put in the cream _solus_, and add the soda dissolved in a  teaspoonful of boiling water at the very last. This makes lighter cake  so is worth the extra trouble. Flavor to taste--grated lemon rind is  good. Add gradually four cups flour sifted three times at least. Beat  hard for ten minutes, then bake in well-greased pans, lined with  buttered paper, until well done, let cool partly in the pans, then turn  out, dust lightly with flour or corn starch and frost.    _Real Silver Cake_: Wash and cream to a froth a pound of fresh butter,  work into it a pound of sifted sugar, and a pound of flour, sifted  thrice with a teaspoonful of baking powder. Add flavoring--vanilla,  lemon or rose water, following it with a wineglass of whiskey. Then fold  in the whites of sixteen eggs beaten with a pinch of salt to the  stiffest possible froth. If the batter looks too thick add half a cup  sweet cream--this will depend on the size of the eggs and the dryness of  the flour. Bake in deep pans, else in layers. By baking gold and silver  batter in layers, and alternating them you can have a fine marble cake.  Or by coloring half the white batter pink with vegetable color to be had  from any confectioner, you can have rose-marble cake. This should be  iced with pink frosting else with plain white, then dotted over with  pink. Very decorative for birthday parties or afternoon teas.    _Christmas Cake_: Prepare fruit first. Cut small half a pound of  homemade citron drained from syrup, wash and seed one pound raisins,  pick, wash and dry one pound currants, mince a teacup of any firm  preserve--quince, peach or pear, or use a cupful of preserved cherries  whole. Shred fine four ounces of homemade candied peel, also four ounces  of preserved ginger, add a cupful of nutmeats--pecans or English  walnuts, or even scalybarks, cutting them in bits, mix all well  together, then pour upon them the strained juice of three oranges, and  three lemons, also add the grated yellow peel. Next pour on half a pint  of whiskey, a gill of rum, and a tumbler of cordial--peach or  blackberry, and homemade if possible. Let stand overnight, in a warm  place--the fruit should take up the most part of the liquor. A glass of  tart jelly is held an improvement by some. I do not put it in--the  preserves suit my palate better. Cream a full pound of butter with four  cups sifted sugar, beat into it one at a time, ten large fresh eggs.  After them put in four cups dried and sifted flour, mix smooth, then put  in the fruit, drained from the liquor and lightly dredged with hot,  sifted flour. Mix well, then add the liquor drained from the fruit,  along with a tablespoonful of lemon essence, and as much vanilla or rose  "]]]
