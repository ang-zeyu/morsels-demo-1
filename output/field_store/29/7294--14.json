But if my love went anywhere it went to a mortal, a man of the men of  Ireland.\"    \"By my hand,\" said Fionn in mortal distress, \"I marvel who that man can  be!\"    \"He is known to you,\" she murmured. \"I lived thus in the peace of Faery,  hearing often of my mortal champion, for the rumour of his great deeds  had gone through the Shi', until a day came when the Black Magician  of the Men of God put his eye on me, and, after that day, in whatever  direction I looked I saw his eye.\"    She stopped at that, and the terror that was in her heart was on her  face. \"He is everywhere,\" she whispered. \"He is in the bushes, and on  the hill. He looked up at me from the water, and he stared down on  me from the sky. His voice commands out of the spaces, and it demands  secretly in the heart. He is not here or there, he is in all places at  all times. I cannot escape from him,\" she said, \"and I am afraid,\" and  at that she wept noiselessly and stared on Fionn.    \"He is my enemy,\" Fionn growled. \"I name him as my enemy.\"    \"You will protect me,\" she implored.    \"Where I am let him not come,\" said Fionn. \"I also have knowledge. I am  Fionn, the son of Uail, the son of Baiscne, a man among men and a god  where the gods are.\"    \"He asked me in marriage,\" she continued, \"but my mind was full of my  own dear hero, and I refused the Dark Man.\"    \"That was your right, and I swear by my hand that if the man you desire  is alive and unmarried he shall marry you or he will answer to me for  the refusal.\"    \"He is not married,\" said Saeve, \"and you have small control over him.\"  The Chief frowned thoughtfully. \"Except the High King and the kings I  have authority in this land.\"    \"What man has authority over himself?\" said Saeve.    \"Do you mean that I am the man you seek?\" said Fionn.    \"It is to yourself I gave my love,\" she replied. \"This is good news,\"  Fionn cried joyfully, \"for the moment you came through the door I loved  and desired you, and the thought that you wished for another man went  into my heart like a sword.\" Indeed, Fionn loved Saeve as he had not  loved a woman before and would never love one again. He loved her as he  had never loved anything before. He could not bear to be away from her.  When he saw her he did not see the world, and when he saw the world  without her it was as though he saw nothing, or as if he looked on a  prospect that was bleak and depressing. The belling of a stag had been  music to Fionn, but when Saeve spoke that was sound enough for him. He  had loved to hear the cuckoo calling in the spring from the tree that  is highest in the hedge, or the blackbird's jolly whistle in an autumn  bush, or the thin, sweet enchantment that comes to the mind when a lark  thrills out of sight in the air and the hushed fields listen to the  song. But his wife's voice was sweeter to Fionn than the singing of a  lark. She filled him with wonder and surmise. There was magic in the  tips of her fingers. Her thin palm ravished him. Her slender foot set  his heart beating; and whatever way her head moved there came a new  shape of beauty to her face.    \"She is always new,\" said Fionn. \"She is always better than any other  woman; she is always better than herself.\"    He attended no more to the Fianna. He ceased to hunt. He did not listen  to the songs of poets or the curious sayings of magicians, for all of  these were in his wife, and something that was beyond these was in her  also.    \"She is this world and the next one; she is completion,\" said Fionn.        CHAPTER III    It happened that the men of Lochlann came on an expedition against  Ireland. A monstrous fleet rounded the bluffs of Ben Edair, and the  Danes landed there, to prepare an attack which would render them masters  of the country. Fionn and the Fianna-Finn marched against them. He did  not like the men of Lochlann at any time, but this time he moved against  them in wrath, for not only were they attacking Ireland, but they had  come between him and the deepest joy his life had known.    It was a hard fight, but a short one. The Lochlannachs were driven back  to their ships, and within a week the only Danes remaining in Ireland  were those that had been buried there.    That finished, he left the victorious Fianna and returned swiftly to the  plain of Allen, for he could not bear to be one unnecessary day parted  from Saeve.    \"You are not leaving us!\" exclaimed Goll mac Morna.    \"I must go,\" Fionn replied.    \"You will not desert the victory feast,\" Conan reproached him.    \"Stay with us, Chief,\" Caelte begged.    \"What is a feast without Fionn?\" they complained.    But he would not stay.    \"By my hand,\" he cried, \"I must go. She will be looking for me from the  window.\"    \"That will happen indeed,\" Goll admitted.    \"That will happen,\" cried Fionn. \"And when she sees me far out on the  plain, she will run through the great gate to meet me.\"    \"It would be the queer wife would neglect that run,\" Cona'n growled.    \"I shall hold her hand again,\" Fionn entrusted to Caelte's ear.    \"You will do that, surely.\"    \"I shall look into her face,\" his lord insisted. But he saw that not  even beloved Caelte understood the meaning of that, and he knew sadly  and yet proudly that what he meant could not be explained by any one and  could not be comprehended by any one.    \"You are in love, dear heart,\" said Caelte.    \"In love he is,\" Cona'n grumbled. \"A cordial for women, a disease for  men, a state of wretchedness.\"    \"Wretched in truth,\" the Chief murmured. \"Love makes us poor We have not  eyes enough to see all that is to be seen, nor hands enough to seize the  tenth of all we want. When I look in her eyes I am tormented because I  am not looking at her lips, and when I see her lips my soul cries out,  'Look at her eyes, look at her eyes.'\"    \"That is how it happens,\" said Goll rememberingly.    \"That way and no other,\" Caelte agreed.    And the champions looked backwards in time on these lips and those, and  knew their Chief would go.    When Fionn came in sight of the great keep his blood and his feet  quickened, and now and again he waved a spear in the air.    \"She does not see me yet,\" he thought mournfully.    \"She cannot see me yet,\" he amended, reproaching himself.    But his mind was troubled, for he thought also, or he felt without  thinking, that had the positions been changed he would have seen her at  twice the distance.    \"She thinks I have been unable to get away from the battle, or that I  was forced to remain for the feast.\"    And, without thinking it, he thought that had the positions been changed  he would have known that nothing could retain the one that was absent.    \"Women,\" he said, \"are shamefaced, they do not like to appear eager when  others are observing them.\"    But he knew that he would not have known if others were observing him,  and that he would not have cared about it if he had known. And he knew  that his Saeve would not have seen, and would not have cared for any  eyes than his.    He gripped his spear on that reflection, and ran as he had not run in  his life, so that it was a panting, dishevelled man that raced heavily  through the gates of the great Dun.    Within the Dun there was disorder. Servants were shouting to one  another, and women were running to and fro aimlessly, wringing their  hands and screaming; and, when they saw the Champion, those nearest to  him ran away, and there was a general effort on the part of every  person to get behind every other person. But Fionn caught the eye of his  butler, Gariv Crona'n, the Rough Buzzer, and held it.    \"Come you here,\" he said.    And the Rough Buzzer came to him without a single buzz in his body.    \"Where is the Flower of Allen?\" his master demanded.    \"I do not know, master,\" the terrified servant replied.    \"You do not know!\" said Fionn. \"Tell what you do know.\"    And the man told him this story.        CHAPTER IV    \"When you had been away for a day the guards were surprised. They were  looking from the heights of the Dun, and the Flower of Allen was with  them. She, for she had a quest's eye, called out that the master of the  Fianna was coming over the ridges to the Dun, and she ran from the keep  to meet you.\"    \"It was not I,\" said Fionn.    \"It bore your shape,\" replied Gariv Cronan. \"It had your armour and your  face, and the dogs, Bran and Sceo'lan, were with it.\"    \"They were with me,\" said Fionn.    \"They seemed to be with it,\" said the servant humbly    \"Tell us this tale,\" cried Fionn.    \"We were distrustful,\" the servant continued. \"We had never known Fionn  to return from a combat before it had been fought, and we knew you could  not have reached Ben Edar or encountered the Lochlannachs. So we urged  our lady to let us go out to meet you, but to remain herself in the  Dun.\"    \"It was good urging,\" Fionn assented.    \"She would not be advised,\" the servant wailed. \"She cried to us, 'Let  me go to meet my love'.\"    \"Alas!\" said Fionn.    \"She cried on us, 'Let me go to meet my husband, the father of the child  that is not born.'\"    \"Alas!\" groaned deep-wounded Fionn. \"She ran towards your appearance  that had your arms stretched out to her.\"    At that wise Fionn put his hand before his eyes, seeing all that  happened.    \"Tell on your tale,\" said he.    \"She ran to those arms, and when she reached them the figure lifted  its hand. It touched her with a hazel rod, and, while we looked, she  disappeared, and where she had been there was a fawn standing and  shivering. The fawn turned and bounded towards the gate of the Dun, but  the hounds that were by flew after her.\"    Fionn stared on him like a lost man.    \"They took her by the throat--\" the shivering servant whispered.    \"Ah!\" cried Fionn in a terrible voice.
