Had I, that hour of dark unrest,      But plunged a dagger in your breast      And in mine own, it had been well;      For now I had been spared the hell      That racks my lone and loving heart,      To think that we must learn to part;--      For we must part, and die apart!                      LU LU.        The shining cloud that broods above the hill,      Casts down its shadows over all the lawns,      The snowy swan is sailing out to sea,      Leaving behind a ruffled surge of light!      Lu Lu is like a cloud in memory,      And shades the ancient brightness of my mind:      A swan upon the ocean of my heart,      Floating along a path of golden thought!        The light of evening slants adown the sky,      Poured from the inner folds of western cloud;      But in the cast there is a spot of blue,      And in that heavenly spot the evening star!      The tresses of Lu Lu are like the light,      Gushing from out her turban down her neck;      And like that Eye of heaven, her mild blue eye,      And in its deeps there hangs a starry tear!           THOSE WHO LOVE LIKE ME.        Those who love like me,        When their meeting ends      Friends can hardly be,        But less or more than friends!        With common words, and smiles,        We cannot meet, and part,      For something will prevent--        Something in the heart!        The thought of other days,        The dream of other years;      With other words, and smiles,        And other sighs and tears!        For all who love like me,        When their parting ends,      Friends must never be,        But more or less than friends!                  TO THE WINDS        Blow fair to-day, ye changing Winds!        And smooth the story sea;      For now ye waft a sacred bark,        And bear a friend from me.      From you he flies, ye Northern Winds,        Your Southern mates to seek;      So urge his keel until he feels        Their kisses on his cheek:      And when their tropic kisses warm,        And tropic skies impart,      Their floods of sunshine to his veins,        Their gladness to his heart--      Blow fair again, ye happy Winds!        And smooth again the sea,      For then ye'll waft the blessed bark,        And bear my friend to me!          \"WIND OF SUMMER, MURMUR LOW.\"        Wind of summer, murmur low,      Where the charmed waters flow,      While the songs of day are dying,      And the bees are homeward flying,      As the breezes come and go.      Come and go, hum and blow,      Winds of summer, sweet and low,      Ere my lover sinks to rest,      While he lies upon my breast,      Kiss his forehead, pale and fair,      Kiss the ringlets of his hair,      Kiss his heavy-lidded eyes,      Where the mist of slumber lies;      Kiss his throat, his cheek, his brow,      And his red, red lips, as I do now,      While he sleeps so sound and slow,      On the heart that loves him so,      Dreaming of the sad, and olden,      And the loving, and the golden      Wind of summers long ago!          THE LATE ELIOT WARBURTON.      The melancholy fate of the author of _The Crescent and the Cross_,  _Canada_, _Darien_, &c., has been stated in these pages. In Great  Britain, where he was well known and highly esteemed by literary men,  there have been many feeling and apparently just tributes to his memory,  one of the most interesting of which is a memoir in the _Dublin  University Magazine_, from which we transcribe the following paragraphs:         \"It was during an extended tour in the Mediterranean about       ten years ago, that Mr. Warburton sent some sheets of       manuscript notes to Mr. Lever, at that time Editor of the       _Dublin University Magazine_. These at once caught that       gentleman's attention, and he gladly gave them publicity,       under the title of \"Episodes of Eastern Travel,\" in       successive numbers of the magazine, where they were       universally admired for the grace and liveliness of their       style. Mr. Lever, however, soon saw that though for the       purposes of his periodical these papers were extremely       valuable, the author was not consulting his own best       interests by continuing to give his travels to the world in       that form; and, with generous disinterestedness, advised him       to collect what he had already published, and the remainder       of his notes, and make a book of the whole. Mr. Warburton       followed his advice, entered into terms with Mr. Colburn,       and published his travels under the title of 'The Crescent       and the Cross.'         \"Of this book it is needless for us to speak. In spite of       the formidable rivalry of an 'Eothen,' which appeared about       the same time, it sprang at once into public favor, and is       one of the very few books of modern travels of which the       sale has continued uninterrupted through successive editions       to the present time. Were we to pronounce upon the secret of       its success, we should lay it to its perfect       _right-mindedness_. A changeful truth, a versatile propriety       of feeling initiates the author, as it were, into the heart       of each successive subject; and we find him as profoundly       impressed with the genius of the Holy Land, as he is       steeped, in the proper place, in the slumberous influences       of the dreamy Nile, upon whose bosom he rocks his readers       into a trance, to be awakened only by the gladsome       originality of these melodies which come mirthfully on their       ears from either bank. And, we may observe in passing, it is       precisely the _want_ of this, which prevents the       indisputable power and grace of 'Eothen' from having their       full effect with the public.         \"Passages of beauty, almost of sublimity, stand isolated       from our sympathies by the interposed cynicism of a few       caustic remarks; and scenes of the world's most ancient       reverence and worship become needlessly disenchanted under       the spell of some skeptical sneer.         \"But we must not turn aside to criticise. Since the       publication of the 'Crescent and the Cross,' Mr. Warburton       has written, or edited, a number of works, some historical,       others of fiction, of which his last romance, 'Darien,' only       appeared as he was on the eve of departing on the fatal       voyage. It has been remarked as a singular circumstance,       that in this tale has prefigured his own fate. A burning       ship is described in terms which would have served as a       picture of the frightful reality he was himself doomed to       witness. The coincidence, casual as it is, has imparted a       melancholy interest to that story, which will long be wept       over as the parting and presaging legacy of a gifted spirit,       prematurely snatched away.         \"These lighter effusions most probably grew out of the       craving of the publishers for the _prestige_ of his name,       already found to be valuable even on title-pages; and the       ready market they commanded could not but prove an       excitement to continue and multiply them. This might be       considered in an ulterior sense unfortunate; for we are       inclined to think that the true bent of Mr. Warburton's       mind, if not of his talents, was towards graver and less       imaginative studies; and we know that this propensity was       growing upon him with maturer years and soberer reflections.         \"It is not exclusively from the bearing of his researches       and the general drift of his correspondence that we infer       this; though both set latterly in that direction. He had for       some time been actually at work with definite objects in       view. One subject which he took up warmly was a _British_       History of Ireland; that is, a history intended to deal       impartial justice between the Irish people on the one side,       and the British empire on the other; reviewing the politics       of successive periods, neither from the Irish nor the       English side of the question, but with reference to the       general interests of the whole.         \"The task, would have proved an arduous one, under any       circumstances--perhaps an invidious one; but what was worse,       even when accomplished, the book might have turned out a       dull affair. So, with a view to lightening the reading, he       had proposed to embody with it memoirs of the Viceroys, thus       keeping the British connection prominent, while enlivening       the pages with biographical touches.         \"Acting on these ideas, he had actually begun a 'History of       the Viceroys' in conjunction with a literary friend, and was       only deterred from prosecuting it by the apathy, or rather       discouragement, of the London publishers, who felt no       inclination to venture upon an Irish historical speculation.       Unfortunately, neither he nor his friend could afford to       pursue the task gratuitously, and it was accordingly       abandoned.         \"Still later, he employed himself in collecting materials       for a History of the Poor--a vast theme; perhaps too vast       for a single intellect to grasp. To him, however, it was a       labor of love; and he had succeeded in getting together a       considerable mass of curious and valuable material _pour       servir_. His last visit to his native country had researches       of this nature for one of its objects; and we are sure many       persons connected with the charitable institutions of       Dublin, will recollect the persevering zeal with which he       visited the haunts of poverty, as well as the asylums for       its relief, noting down every thing which might prove       afterwards serviceable on that suggestive topic.         \"With an upwelling of philanthropy so "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3535"],[0,"A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany-Bay (#14)"],[1,"the executions. Amidst the causes of this  mortality, excessive toil and a scarcity of food are not to be numbered,  as the reader will easily conceive, when informed, that they have  the same allowance of provisions as every officer and soldier in the  garrison; and are indulged by being exempted from labour every Saturday  afternoon and Sunday. On the latter of those days they are expected  to attend divine service, which is performed either within one of the  storehouses, or under a great tree in the open air, until a church can  be built.    Amidst our public labours, that no fortified post, or place of security,  is yet begun, may be a matter of surprise. Were an emergency in the  night to happen, it is not easy to say what might not take place before  troops, scattered about in an extensive encampment, could be formed, so  as to act. An event that happened a few evenings since may, perhaps, be  the means of forwarding this necessary work. In the dead of night the  centinels on the eastern side of the cove were alarmed by the voices  of the Indians, talking near their posts. The soldiers on this occasion  acted with their usual firmness, and without creating a disturbance,  acquainted the officer of the guard with the circumstance, who  immediately took every precaution to prevent an attack, and at the same  time gave orders that no molestation, while they continued peaceable,  should be offered them. From the darkness of the night, and the distance  they kept at, it was not easy to ascertain their number, but from the  sound of the voices and other circumstances, it was calculated at near  thirty. To their intentions in honouring us with this visit (the only  one we have had from them in the last five months) we are strangers,  though most probably it was either with a view to pilfer, or to  ascertain in what security we slept, and the precautions we used in the  night. When the bells of the ships in the harbour struck the hour of the  night, and the centinels called out on their posts \"All's well,\" they  observed a dead silence, and continued it for some minutes, though  talking with the greatest earnestness and vociferation but the moment  before. After having remained a considerable time they departed without  interchanging a syllable with our people.          CHAPTER XVII.        Some Thoughts on the Advantages which may arise to the Mother Country  from forming the Colony.      The author of these sheets would subject himself to the charge of  presumption, were he to aim at developing the intentions of Government  in forming this settlement. But without giving offence, or incurring  reproach, he hopes his opinion on the probability of advantage to be  drawn from hence by Great Britain, may be fairly made known.    If only a receptacle for convicts be intended, this place stands  unequalled from the situation, extent, and nature of the country. When  viewed in a commercial light, I fear its insignificance will appear very  striking. The New Zealand hemp, of which so many sanguine expectations  were formed, is not a native of the soil; and Norfolk Island, where we  made sure to find this article, is also without it. So that the scheme  of being able to assist the East Indies with naval stores, in case of a  war, must fall to the ground, both from this deficiency, and the quality  of the timber growing here. Were it indeed possible to transport that of  Norfolk Island, its value would be found very great, but the difficulty,  from the surf, I am well informed, is so insuperable as to forbid  the attempt. Lord Howe Island, discovered by Lieut. Ball, though an  inestimable acquisition to our colony, produces little else than the  mountain cabbage tree.    Should a sufficient military force be sent out to those employed in  cultivating the ground, I see no room to doubt, that in the course of  a few years, the country will be able to yield grain enough for the  support of its new possessors. But to effect this, our present limits  must be greatly extended, which will require detachments of troops not  to be spared from the present establishment. And admitting the position,  the parent country will still have to supply us for a much longer time  with every other necessary of life. For after what we have seen, the  idea of being soon able to breed cattle sufficient for our consumption,  must appear chimerical and absurd. From all which it is evident, that  should Great Britain neglect to send out regular supplies, the most  fatal consequences will ensue.    Speculators who may feel inclined to try their fortunes here, will do  well to weigh what I have said. If golden dreams of commerce and wealth  flatter their imaginations, disappointment will follow: the remoteness  of situation, productions of the country, and want of connection with  other parts of the world, justify me in the assertion. But to men of  small property, unambitious of trade, and wishing for retirement, I  think the continent of New South Wales not without inducements. One  of this description, with letters of recommendation, and a sufficient  capital (after having provided for his passage hither) to furnish him  with an assortment of tools for clearing land, agricultural and domestic  purposes; possessed also of a few household utensils, a cow, a few sheep  and breeding sows, would, I am of opinion, with proper protection and  encouragement, succeed in obtaining a comfortable livelihood, were he  well assured before he quitted his native country, that a provision for  him until he might be settled, should be secured; and that a grant of  land on his arrival would be allotted him.    That this adventurer, if of a persevering character and competent  knowledge, might in the course of ten years bring matters into such a  train as to render himself comfortable and independent, I think highly  probable. The superfluities of his farm would enable him to purchase  European commodities from the masters of ships, which will arrive on  Government account, sufficient to supply his wants. But beyond this he  ought not to reckon, for admitting that he might meet with success in  raising tobacco, rice, indigo, or vineyards (for which last I think the  soil and climate admirably adapted), the distance of a mart to vend them  at, would make the expense of transportation so excessive, as to cut off  all hopes of a reasonable profit; nor can there be consumers enough here  to take them off his hands, for so great a length of time to come, as I  shall not be at the trouble of computing.    Should then any one, induced by this account, emigrate hither, let him,  before he quits England, provide all his wearing apparel for himself,  family, and servants; his furniture, tools of every kind, and implements  of husbandry (among which a plough need not be included, as we make use  of the hoe), for he will touch at no place where they can be purchased  to advantage. If his sheep and hogs are English also, it will be better.  For wines, spirits, tobacco, sugar, coffee, tea, rice, poultry, and many  other articles, he may venture to rely on at Teneriffe or Madeira, the  Brazils and Cape of Good Hope. It will not be his interest to draw bills  on his voyage out, as the exchange of money will be found invariably  against him, and a large discount also deducted. Drafts on the place he  is to touch at, or cash (dollars if possible) will best answer his end.    To men of desperate fortune and the lowest classes of the people, unless  they can procure a passage as indented servants, similar to the custom  practised of emigrating to America, this part of the world offers no  temptation: for it can hardly be supposed, that Government will be fond  of maintaining them here until they can be settled, and without such  support they must starve.    Of the Governor's instructions and intentions relative to the disposal  of the convicts, when the term of their transportation shall be expired,  I am ignorant. They will then be free men, and at liberty, I apprehend,  either to settle in the country, or to return to Europe. The former  will be attended with some public expense; and the latter, except in  particular cases, will be difficult to accomplish, from the numberless  causes which prevent a frequent communication between England and this  continent.          POSTSCRIPT        Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, New South Wales.      October 1st, 1788. Little material has occurred in this colony since the  departure of the ships for England, on the 14th July last. On the  20th of that month His Majesty's ship Supply, Captain Ball, sailed  for Norfolk Island, and returned on the 26th August. Our accounts from  thence are more favourable than were expected. The soil proves admirably  adapted to produce all kinds of grain, and European vegetables. But the  discovery which constitutes its value is the New Zealand flax, plants  of which are found growing in every part of the island in the utmost  luxuriancy and abundance. This will, beyond doubt, appear strange to the  reader after what has been related in the former part of my work: and  in future, let the credit of the testimony be as high as it may, I  shall never without diffidence and hesitation presume to contradict  the narrations of Mr. Cook. The truth is, that those sent to settle and  explore the island knew not the form in which the plant grows, and were  unfurnished with every particular which could lead to a knowledge of  it. Unaccountable as this may sound, it is, nevertheless, incontestably  true. Captain Ball brought away with him several specimens for  inspection, and, on trial, by some flax-dressers among us, the threads  produced from them, though coarse, are pronounced to be stronger, more  likely to be durable, and fitter for every purpose of manufacturing  cordage, than any they ever before dressed.    Every research has been made by those on the island to find a  landing-place, whence it might be practicable to"]]]
