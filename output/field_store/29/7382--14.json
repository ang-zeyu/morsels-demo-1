[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34853"],[0,"The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries (#14)"],[1,"   The following evidence, by the Rev. Father ----, came out during a  discussion concerning spirits and fairies as regarded by Roman Catholic  theology, which he and I enjoyed when we met as fellow travellers in  Galway Town:--    _Of Magic and Place-spirits._--'Magic, according to Catholic theology,  is nothing else than the solicitation of spiritual powers to help us. If  evil spirits are evoked by certain irrational practices it is unholy  magic, and this is altogether forbidden by our Church. All charms,  spells, divination, necromancy, or geomancy are unholy magic. Holy magic  is practised by carrying the Cross in Christ. Now evil magic has been  practised here in Ireland: butter has been _taken_ so that none came  from the churning; cows have been made to die of maladies; and fields  made unproductive. A cow was bought from an old woman in Connemara, and  no butter was ever had from the cow until exorcism with holy water was  performed. This is reported to me as a fact.' And in another relation  the Rev. Father ---- said what for us is highly significant:--'My  private opinion is that in certain places here in Ireland where pagan  sacrifices were practised, evil spirits through receiving homage gained  control, and still hold control, unless driven out by exorcisms.'      THE TESTIMONY OF THE TOWN CLERK OF TUAM    To the town clerk of Tuam, Mr. John Glynn, who since his boyhood has  taken a keen interest in the traditions of his native county, I am  indebted for the following valuable summary of the fairy creed in that  part of North Galway where Finvara rules:--    _Fairies of the Tuam Country._--'The whole of Knock Ma (_Cnoc  Meadha_[13]), which probably means Hill of the Plain, is said to be the  palace of Finvara, king of the Connaught fairies. There are a good many  legends about Finvara, but very few about Queen Meave in this region.'    _Famine of 1846-7 caused by Fairies._--'During 1846-7 the potato crop in  Ireland was a failure, and very much suffering resulted. At the time,  the country people in these parts attributed the famine to disturbed  conditions in the fairy world. Old Thady Steed once told me about the  conditions then prevailing, \"Sure, we couldn't be any other way; and I  saw the _good people_ and hundreds besides me saw them fighting in the  sky over Knock Ma and on towards Galway.\" And I heard others say they  saw the fighting also.'    _Fairyland; and the Seeress._--'Fairies are said to be immortal, and the  fairy world is always described as an immaterial place, though I do not  think it is the same as the world of the dead. Sick persons, however,  are often said to be with the fairies, and when cured, to have come  back. A woman who died here about thirty years ago was commonly believed  to have been with the fairies during her seven years' sickness when she  was a maiden. She married after coming back, and had children; and she  was always able to see the _good people_ and to talk with them, for she  had the second-sight. And it is said that she used to travel with the  fairies at night. After her marriage she lived in Tuam, and though her  people were six or seven miles out from Tuam in the country, she could  always tell all that was taking place with them there, and she at her  own home at the time.'    _Fairies on May Day._--'On May Day the _good people_ can steal butter if  the chance is given them. If a person enters a house then, and churning  is going on, he must take a hand in it, or else there will be no butter.  And if fire is given away on May Day nothing will go right for the whole  year.'    _The Three Fairy Drops._--'Even yet certain things are due the fairies;  for example, two years ago, in the Court Room here in Tuam, a woman was  on trial for watering milk, and to the surprise of us all who were  conducting the proceedings, and, it can be added, to the great amusement  of the onlookers, she swore that she had only added \"the three fairy  drops\".'    _Food of Fairies._--'Food, after it has been put out at night for the  fairies, is not allowed to be eaten afterwards by man or beast, not even  by pigs. Such food is said to have no real substance left in it, and to  let anything eat it wouldn't be thought of. The underlying idea seems to  be that the fairies extract the spiritual essence from food offered to  them, leaving behind the grosser elements.'    _Fairy Warfare._--'When the fairy tribes under the various kings and  queens have a battle, one side manages to have a living man among them,  and he by knocking the fairies about turns the battle in case the side  he is on is losing. It is always usual for the Munster fairy king to  challenge Finvara, the Connaught fairy king.'      COUNTY SLIGO, AND THE TESTIMONY OF A PEASANT SEER[14]    The Ben Bulbin country in County Sligo is one of those rare places in  Ireland where fairies are thought to be visible, and our first witness  from there claims to be able to see the fairies or 'gentry' and to talk  with them. This mortal so favoured lives in the same townland where his  fathers have lived during four hundred years, directly beneath the  shadows of Ben Bulbin, on whose sides Dermot is said to have been killed  while hunting the wild-boar. And this famous old mountain, honeycombed  with curious grottoes ages ago when the sea beat against its  perpendicular flanks, is the very place where the 'gentry' have their  chief abode. Even on its broad level summit, for it is a high square  tableland like a mighty cube of rock set down upon the earth by some  antediluvian god, there are treacherous holes, wherein more than one  hunter may have been lost for ever, penetrating to unknown depths; and  by listening one can hear the tides from the ocean three or four miles  away surging in and out through ancient subterranean channels, connected  with these holes. In the neighbouring mountains there are long caverns  which no man has dared to penetrate to the end, and even dogs, it is  said, have been put in them never to emerge, or else to come out miles  away.    One day when the heavy white fog-banks hung over Ben Bulbin and its  neighbours, and there was a weird almost-twilight at midday over the  purple heather bog-lands at their base, and the rain was falling, I sat  with my friend before a comfortable fire of fragrant turf in his cottage  and heard about the 'gentry':--    _Encounters with the 'Gentry'._--'When I was a young man I often used to  go out in the mountains over there (pointing out of the window in their  direction) to fish for trout, or to hunt; and it was in January on a  cold, dry day while carrying my gun that I and a friend with me, as we  were walking around Ben Bulbin, saw one of the _gentry_ for the first  time. I knew who it was, for I had heard the _gentry_ described ever  since I could remember; and this one was dressed in blue with a  head-dress adorned with what seemed to be frills.[15] When he came up to  us, he said to me in a sweet and silvery voice, \"The seldomer you come  to this mountain the better. A young lady here wants to take you away.\"  Then he told us not to fire off our guns, because the _gentry_ dislike  being disturbed by the noise. And he seemed to be like a soldier of the  _gentry_ on guard. As we were leaving the mountains, he told us not to  look back, and we didn't. Another time I was alone trout-fishing in  nearly the same region when I heard a voice say, \"It is ---- barefooted  and fishing.\" Then there came a whistle like music and a noise like the  beating of a drum, and soon one of the _gentry_ came and talked with me  for half an hour. He said, \"Your mother will die in eleven months, and  do not let her die unanointed.\" And she did die within eleven months. As  he was going away he warned me, \"You must be in the house before sunset.  Do not delay! Do not delay! They can do nothing to you until I get back  in the castle.\" As I found out afterwards, he was going to _take_ me,  but hesitated because he did not want to leave my mother alone. After  these warnings I was always afraid to go to the mountains, but lately I  have been told I could go if I took a friend with me.'    _'Gentry' Protection._--'The _gentry_ have always befriended and  protected me. I was drowned twice but for them. Once I was going to  Durnish Island, a mile off the coast. The channel is very deep, and at  the time there was a rough sea, with the tide running out, and I was  almost lost. I shrieked and shouted, and finally got safe to the  mainland. The day I talked with one of the _gentry_ at the foot of the  mountain when he was for _taking_ me, he mentioned this, and said they  were the ones who saved me from drowning then.'    _'Gentry' Stations._--'Especially in Ireland, the _gentry_ live inside  the mountains in beautiful castles; and there are a good many branches  of them in other countries. Like armies, they have various stations and  move from one to another. Some live in the Wicklow Mountains near  Dublin.'    _'Gentry' Control Over Human Affairs._--'The _gentry_ take a great  interest in the affairs of men, and they always stand for justice and  right. Any side they favour in our wars, that side wins. They favoured  the Boers, and the Boers did get their rights. They told me they  favoured the Japanese and not the Russians, because the Russians are  tyrants. Sometimes they fight among themselves. One of them once said,  \"I'd fight for a friend, or I'd fight for Ireland.\"'    _The 'Gentry' Described._--In response to my wish, this description of  the 'gentry' was given:--'The folk are the grandest I have ever seen.  They are far superior to us, and that is why they are called the  _gentry_. They are not a working class, but a military-aristocratic  class, tall and noble-appearing. They are a distinct race between our  own and that of spirits, as they have told me. Their qualifications are  tremendous. \"We could cut off half the human race, but would not,\" they  said, \"for we are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34856"],[0,"My Own Story (#14)"],[1,"House rose at midnight.    The next morning fifty-seven women and two men were arraigned, two and  three at a time, in Westminster police court. Christabel Pankhurst was  the first to be placed in the dock. She tried to explain to the  magistrate that the deputation of the day before was a perfectly  peaceful attempt to present a resolution, which, sooner or later, would  be presented and acted upon. She assured him that the deputation was but  the beginning of a campaign that would not cease until the Government  yielded to the women's demand. \"There can be no going back for us,\" she  declared, \"and more will happen if we do not get justice.\"    The magistrate, Mr. Curtis Bennett, who was destined later to try women  for that \"more,\" rebuked my daughter sternly, telling her that the  Government had nothing to do with causing the disorders of the day  before, that the women were entirely responsible for what had occurred,  and finally, that these disgraceful scenes in the street must  cease--just as King Canute told the ocean that it must roll out instead  of in. \"The scenes can be stopped in only one way,\" replied the  prisoner. His sole reply to that was, \"Twenty shillings or fourteen  days,\" Christabel chose the prison sentence, and so did all the other  prisoners. Mrs. Despard, who headed the deputation, and Sylvia  Pankhurst, who was with her, were given three weeks in prison.    Of course the raid, as it was called, gave the Women's Social and  Political Union an enormous amount of publicity, on the whole,  favourable publicity. The newspapers were almost unanimous in condemning  the Government for sending mounted troops out against unarmed women.  Angry questions were asked in Parliament, and our ranks once more  increased in size and ardour. The old-fashioned suffragists, men as well  as women, cried out that we had alienated all our friends in Parliament;  but this proved to be untrue. Indeed, it was found that a Liberal  member, Mr. Dickinson, had won the first place in the ballot, and had  announced that he intended to use it to introduce a women's suffrage  bill. More than this, the prime minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman,  promised to give the bill his support. For a time, a very short time, it  is true, we felt that the hour of our freedom might be at hand, that our  prisoners had perhaps already won us our precious symbol--the vote.    Soon, however, a number of professed suffragists in the House began to  complain that Mr. Dickinson's bill, practically the original bill, was  not \"democratic\" enough, that it would enfranchise only the women of the  upper classes--to which, by the way, most of them belonged. That this  was not true had been proved again and again from the municipal  registers, which showed a majority of working women's names as qualified  householders. The contention was but a shallow excuse, and we knew it.  Therefore we were not surprised when Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman  departed from his pledge of support, and allowed the bill to be talked  out.    Following this event, the second Women's Parliament assembled, on the  afternoon of March 20, 1907. As before, we adopted a resolution calling  upon the Government to introduce an official suffrage measure, and again  we voted to send the resolution from the hall to the Prime Minister.  Lady Harberton was chosen to lead the deputation, and instantly hundreds  of women sprang up and volunteered to accompany her. This time the  police met the women at the door of the hall, and another useless,  disgraceful scene of barbarous, brute-force opposition took place.  Something like one thousand police had been sent out to guard the House  of Commons from the peaceful invasion of a few hundred women. All  afternoon and evening we kept Caxton Hall open, the women returning  every now and again, singly and in small groups, to have their bruises  bathed, or their torn clothing repaired. As night fell the crowds in the  street grew denser, and the struggle between the women and the police  became more desperate. Lady Harberton, we heard, had succeeded in  reaching the entrance to the House of Commons, nay, had actually managed  to press past the sentries into the lobby, but her resolution had not  been presented to the Prime Minister. She and many others were arrested  before the police at last succeeded in clearing the streets, and the  dreadful affair was over.    The next day, in Westminster police court, the magistrate meted out  sentences varying from twenty shillings or fourteen days to forty  shillings or one month's imprisonment. Two of the women, Miss Woodlock  and Mrs. Chatterton, who had left Holloway only a week before, were, as  \"old offenders,\" given thirty days without the option of a fine. Another  woman, Mary Leigh, was given thirty days because she offended the  magistrate's dignity by hanging a \"Votes for Women\" banner over the edge  of the dock. Those of my readers who are unable to connect the word  \"militancy\" with anything milder than arson are invited to reflect that  within the first two months of the year 1907 the English Government sent  to prison one hundred and thirty women whose \"militancy\" consisted  merely of trying to carry a resolution from a hall to the Prime Minister  in the House of Commons. Our crime was called obstructing the police. It  will be seen that it was the police who did the obstructing.    It may be asked why neither of these deputations was led by me  personally. The reason was that I was needed in another capacity, that  of leader and supervisor of the suffrage forces in the field to defeat  Government candidates at by-elections. On the night of the second  \"riot,\" while our women were still struggling in the streets, I left  London for Hexham in Northumberland, where by our work the majority of  the Liberal candidate was reduced by a thousand votes. Seven more  by-elections followed in rapid succession.    Our by-election work was such a new thing in English politics that we  attracted an enormous amount of attention wherever we went. It was our  custom to begin work the very hour we entered a town. If, on our way  from the station to the hotel, we encountered a group of men, say, in  the market-place, we either stopped and held a meeting on the spot, or  else we stayed long enough to tell them when and where our meetings were  to be held, and to urge them to attend. The usual first step, after  securing lodgings, was to hire a vacant shop, fill the windows with  suffrage literature, and fling out our purple, green, and white flag.  Meanwhile, some of us were busy hiring the best available hall. If we  got possession of the battle-ground before the men, we sometimes  \"cornered\" all the good halls and left the candidate nothing but  schoolhouses for his indoor meetings. Truth to tell, our meetings were  so much more popular than theirs that we really needed the larger halls.  Often, a candidate with the Suffragettes for rivals spoke to almost  empty benches. The crowds were away listening to the women.    Naturally, this greatly displeased the politicians, and it scandalised  many of the old-fashioned Liberal partisans. In one place, I think it  was Colne Valley in Yorkshire, an amusing instance of masculine  hostility occurred. We had arrived on a day when both Conservative and  Liberal committees were choosing their candidates, and we thought it a  good opportunity to hold a series of outdoor meetings. We tried to get  a lorry for a rostrum, but the only man in town who had these big vans  to let disapproved of Suffragettes so violently that he wouldn't let us  have one. So we borrowed a chair from a woman shopkeeper, and went at  it. Soon we had a large crowd and an interested audience. We also got  the attention of a number of small boys with pea-shooters, and had to  make our speeches under a blistering fire of dried peas.    While I was speaking the fire ceased, to my relief--for dried peas  sting. I continued my speech with renewed vigor, only to have one of my  best points spoiled by roars of laughter from the crowd. I finished  somehow, and sat down; and then it was explained to me that the  pea-shooters had been financed by one of the prominent Liberals of the  town, another man who disapproved of our policy of opposing the  Government. As soon as the ammunition gave out this man furnished the  boys with a choice supply of rotten oranges. These were not so easily  handled, it appeared, for the very first one went wild, and struck the  chivalrous gentleman violently in the neck. This it was that had caused  the laughter, and stopped the attack on the women.    We met with some pretty rough horse-play, and even with some brutality,  in several by-elections, but on the whole we found the men ready, and  the women more than ready, to listen to us. We tamed and educated a  public that had always been used to violence at elections. We even tamed  the boys, who came to the meetings on purpose to skylark. When we were  in Rutlandshire that spring three schoolboys came to see me and told me,  shyly, that they were interested in suffrage. They had had a debate on  the subject at their school, and although the decision had been for the  other side, all the boys wanted to know more about it. Wouldn't I please  have a meeting especially for them? Of course I consented, and I found  my boy audience quite delightful. Indeed, I hope they liked me half as  well as I did them.    All through the spring our by-election work continued with amazing  success, although our part in the Government losses was rarely admitted  by the politicians. The voters knew, however. At an election in Suffolk,  where we helped to double the Unionist vote, the successful candidate,  speaking to the crowd from his hotel window, said, \"What has been the  cause of the great and glorious victory?\" Instantly the crowd roared,  \"Votes for Women!\"--\"Three cheers for the Suffragettes!\" This was not at  all what the"]]]
