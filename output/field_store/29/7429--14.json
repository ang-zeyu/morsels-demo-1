FOOTNOTES:    [1] The accomplished authoress of \"Rural Hours.\"--_Ed. International._          THE LONDON TIMES ON AMERICAN INTERCOMMUNICATION.      We are by no means confident that the Mexican War, with all its victories,  was more serviceable to our reputation in Europe, than the single victory  of Mr. Stevens, in his yacht America, off the Isle of Wight. This triumph  has been celebrated in a dinner at the Astor House, but the city might have  well afforded to welcome the returning owner of the America with an  illumination, or the fathers, in council assembled, might have voted him a  statue. Mr. Collins and Mr. Stevens have together managed to deprive  England of the \"trident of the seas,\" and as soon as it was transferred  there began a shower of honors, which continues still, from the _Times_  down to the very meanest of its imitators. From that time the Americans  have had all the \"solid triumphs\" in the Great Exhibition. We have been  regarded as a wonderful people, and our institutions as the most  interesting study that is offered for contemporary statesmen and  philosophers. We copy below a specimen of the leaders with which the  _Times_ has honored us, and commend it to our readers, not more for its  tone than for the valuable information contained in it:--         LOCOMOTION BY RIVER AND RAILWAY IN THE UNITED STATES.         England has been so dazzled by the splendor of her own       achievements in the creation of a new art of transport       by land and water within the last thirty years, as to       become in a measure insensible to all that has been       accomplished in the same interval and in the same       department of the arts elsewhere, improvements less       brilliant, indeed, intrinsically, than the stupendous       system of inland transport, which we lately noticed in       these columns, and having a lustre mitigated to our       view by distance, yet presenting in many respects       circumstances and conditions which may well excite       profound and general interest, and even challenge a       respectful comparison with the greatest of those       advances in the art of locomotion of which we are most       justly proud.         It will not, therefore, be without utility and       interest, after the detailed notice which we have       lately given of our own advances in the adaptation of       steam to locomotion, to direct attention to the       progress in the same department which has been       simultaneously made in other and distant countries, and       first, and above all, by our friends and countrymen in       the other hemisphere.         The inland transport of the United States is       distributed mainly between the rivers, the canals, and       the railways, a comparatively small fraction of it       being executed on common roads. Provided with a system       of natural water communication on a scale of magnitude       without any parallel in the world, it might have been       expected that the \"sparse\" population of this recently       settled country might have continued for a long period       of time satisfied with such an apparatus of transport.       It is, however, the character of man, but above all of       the Anglo-Saxon man, never to rest satisfied with the       gifts of nature, however munificent they be, until he       has rendered them ten times more fruitful by the       application of his skill and industry, and we find       accordingly that the population of America has not only       made the prodigious natural streams which intersect its       vast territory over so many thousands of miles,       literally swarm with steamboats, but they have,       besides, constructed a system of canal navigation,       which may boldly challenge comparison with any thing of       the same kind existing in the oldest, wealthiest, and       most civilized States of Europe.         It appears from the official statistics that, on the       1st of January, 1843, the extent of canals in actual       operation amounted to 4,333 miles and that there were       then in progress 2,359 miles, a considerable portion of       which has since been completed, so that it is probable       that the actual extent of artificial water       communication now in use in the United States       considerably exceeds 5,000 miles. The average cost of       executing this prodigious system of artificial water       communication was at the rate of 6,432_l._ per mile, so       that 5,000 miles would have absorbed a capital of above       32,000,000_l._         This extent of canal transport, compared with the       population, exhibits in a striking point of view the       activity and enterprise which characterize the American       people. In the United States there is a mile of canal       navigation for every 5,000 inhabitants, while in       England the proportion is 1 to every 9,000 inhabitants,       and France 1 to every 13,000. The ratio, therefore, of       this instrument of intercommunication in the United       States is greater than in the United Kingdom, in       proportion to the population, as 9 to 5, and greater       than in France in the ratio of 13 to 5.         The extent to which the American people have       fertilized, so to speak, the natural powers of those       vast collections of water which surround and intersect       their territory, is not less remarkable than their       enterprise in constructing artificial lines of water       communication. Besides the internal communication       supplied by the rivers, properly so called, a vast       apparatus of liquid transport is derived from the       geographical character of their extensive coast,       stretching over a space of more than 4,000 miles, from       the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the delta of the       Mississippi, indented and serrated with natural harbors       and sheltered bays, fringed with islands forming       sounds, throwing out capes and promontories which       inclose arms of the sea in which the waters are free       from the roll of the ocean, and which, for all the       purposes of navigation, have the character of rivers       and lakes. The lines of communication formed by the       vast and numerous rivers are, moreover, completed in       the interior by chains of lakes presenting the most       extensive bodies of fresh water in the known world.         Whatever question may be raised on the conflicting       claims for the invention of steam navigation, it is an       incontestable fact that the first steamboat practically       applied for any useful purpose was placed on the       Hudson, to ply between New-York and Albany, in 1808;       and, from that time to the present that river has been       the theatre of the most remarkable series of       experiments of locomotion on water ever recorded in the       history of man. The Hudson is navigable by steamers of       the largest class as high as Albany, a distance of       nearly 150 miles from New-York. The steam navigation       upon this river is entitled to attention, not only       because of the immense traffic of which it is the       vehicle, but because it forms a sort of model for all       the rivers of the Atlantic States. Two classes of       steamers work upon it--one appropriated to the swift       transport of passengers, and the other to the towing of       the vast traffic which is maintained between the city       of New-York and the interior of the State of that name,       into the heart of which the Hudson penetrates.         The passenger steamers present a curious contrast to       the sea-going steamers with which we are familiar. Not       having to encounter the agitated surface of the ocean,       they are supplied with neither rigging nor sails, are       built exclusively with a view to speed, are slender and       weak in their structure, with great length in       proportion to their beam, and have but small draught of       water. The position and form of the machinery are       peculiar. The engines are placed on deck in a       comparatively elevated situation. It is but rarely that       two engines are used. A single engine placed in the       centre of the deck drives a crank constructed on the       axle of the enormous paddle-wheels, the magnitude of       which, and the velocity imparted to them, enable them       to perform the office of fly-wheels. These vessels,       which are of great magnitude, are splendidly fitted up       for the accommodation of passengers, and have been       within the last ten or twelve years undergoing a       gradual augmentation of magnitude, to which it would       seem to be difficult to set a limit.         In the following table, which we borrow from the work       on _Railway Economy_, from which we have already       derived so large a portion of our information, are       given the dimensions and the details of fourteen of the       principal steamers plying on the Hudson in the year  1838:--                 |Length of deck.               |    |Breadth of beam.               |    |    |Draught.               |    |    |    |Diameter of wheels.               |    |    |    |    |Length of paddles.               |    |    |    |    |    |Depth of paddles.               |    |    |    |    |    |   |Number of engines.               |    |    |    |    |    |   |  |Diameter of cylinder.               |    |    |    |    |    |   |  |    |Length of stroke.               |    |    |    |    |    |   |  |    |    |Number of               "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37937"],[0,"A Wanderer in Paris (#14)"],[1,"the Louvre its special  distinction as a picture gallery. Without him it would still be  magnificent: with him it is priceless and sublime. For not only are  there the \"Monna Lisa\" and (also in the Salon Carre) the sweet and  beautiful \"Madonna and Saint Anne,\" but in the next, the Grande  Galerie, are his \"Virgin of the Rocks,\" a variant of the only Leonardo  in our National Gallery, and the \"Bacchus\" (so like the \"John the  Baptist\") and the \"John the Baptist\" (so like the \"Bacchus\") and the  portrait of the demure yet mischievous Italian lady who is supposed to  be Lucrezia Crivelli, and who (in spite of the yellowing ravages of  time) once seen is never forgotten.    The Louvre has all these (together with many drawings), but above all  it has the Monna Lisa, of which what shall I say? I feel that I can  say nothing. But here are two descriptions of the picture, or rather  two descriptions of the emotions produced by the picture on two very  different minds. These I may quote as expressing, between them, all. I  will begin with that of Walter Pater: \"As we have seen him using  incidents of sacred story, not for their own sake, or as mere subjects  for pictorial realisation, but as a cryptic language for fancies all  his own, so now he found a vent for his thought in taking one of these  languid women, and raising her, as Leda or Pomona, as Modesty or  Vanity, to the seventh heaven of symbolical expression.    \"_La Gioconda_ is, in the truest sense, Leonardo's masterpiece, the  revealing instance of his mode of thought and work. In suggestiveness,  only the _Melancholia_ of Duerer is comparable to it; and no crude  symbolism disturbs the effect of its subdued and graceful mystery. We  all know the face and hands of the figure, set in its marble chair, in  that circle of fantastic rocks, as in some faint light under sea.  Perhaps of all ancient pictures time has chilled it least.[1] As often  happens with works in which invention seems to reach its limit, there  is an element in it given to, not invented by, the master. In that  inestimable folio of drawings, once in the possession of Vasari, were  certain designs by Verrocchio, faces of such impressive beauty that  Leonardo in his boyhood copied them many times. It is hard not to  connect with these designs of the elder, by-past master, as with its  germinal principle, the unfathomable smile, always with a touch of  something sinister on it, which plays over all Leonardo's work.  Besides, the picture is a portrait. From childhood we see this image  defining itself on the fabric of his dreams; and but for express  historical testimony, we might fancy that this was but his ideal lady,  embodied and beheld at last. What was the relationship of a living  Florentine to this creature of his thought? By what strange affinities  had the dream and the person grown up thus apart, and yet so closely  together? Present from the first incorporeally in Leonardo's brain,  dimly traced in the designs of Verrocchio, she is found present at  last in _Il Giocondo's_ house. That there is much of mere portraiture  in the picture is attested by the legend that by artificial means, the  presence of mimes and flute-players, that subtle expression was  protracted on the face. Again, was it in four years and by renewed  labour never really completed, or in four months and as by stroke of  magic, that the image was projected?    \"The presence that rose thus so strangely beside the waters, is  expressive of what in the ways of a thousand years men had come to  desire. Hers is the head upon which all 'the ends of the world are  come,' and the eyelids are a little weary. It is a beauty wrought out  from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little cell by cell, of  strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions. Set it  for a moment beside one of those white Greek Goddesses or beautiful  women of antiquity, and how would they be troubled by this beauty,  into which the soul with all its maladies has passed! All the thoughts  and experience of the world have etched and moulded there, in that  which they have of power to refine and make expressive the outward  form, the animalism of Greece, the lust of Rome, the mysticism of the  middle age with its spiritual ambition and imaginative loves, the  return of the Pagan world, the sins of the Borgias. She is older than  the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead  many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver  in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her; and trafficked for  strange webs with Eastern merchants; and, as Leda, was the mother of  Helen of Troy, and, as Saint Anne, the mother of Mary; and all this  has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes, and lives only  in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments, and  tinged the eyelids and the hands. The fancy of a perpetual life,  sweeping together ten thousand experiences, is an old one; and modern  philosophy has conceived the idea of humanity as wrought upon by, and  summing up in itself, all modes of thought and life. Certainly Lady  Lisa might stand as the embodiment of the old fancy, the symbol of the  modern idea.\"      [1] Yet for Vasari there was further magic of crimson in the        lips and cheeks, lost for us. _Pater's note._    This was what the picture meant for Pater; whether too much, is beside  the mark. Pater thought it and Pater wrote it, and that is enough. To  others, who are not as Pater, it says less, and possibly more. This,  for example, is what \"Monna Lisa\" suggested to one of the most  distinguished and civilised minds of our time--James Russell Lowell:--         She gave me all that woman can,       Nor her soul's nunnery forego,       A confidence that man to man       Without remorse can never show.         Rare art, that can the sense refine       Till not a pulse rebellious stirs,       And, since she never can be mine,       Makes it seem sweeter to be hers!    Finally, since we cannot (I believe) spend too much time upon this  picture, let me quote Vasari's account of it. \"For Francesco del  Giocondo, Leonardo undertook to paint the portrait of Monna Lisa, his  wife, but, after loitering over it for four years, he finally left it  unfinished. This work is now in the possession of the King Francis of  France, and is at Fontainebleau. Whoever shall desire to see how far  art can imitate nature may do so to perfection in this head, wherein  every peculiarity that could be depicted by the utmost subtlety of the  pencil has been faithfully reproduced. The eyes have the lustrous  brightness and moisture which is seen in life, and around them are  those pale, red, and slightly livid circles, also proper to nature,  with the lashes, which can only be copied, as these are, with the  greatest difficulty; the eyebrows also are represented with the  closest exactitude, where fuller and where more thinly set, with the  separate hairs delineated as they issue from the skin, every turn  being followed, and all the pores exhibited in a manner that could  not be more natural than it is: the nose, with its beautiful and  delicately roseate nostrils, might be easily believed to be alive; the  mouth, admirable in its outline, has the lips uniting the rose-tints  of their colour with that of the face, in the utmost perfection, and  the carnation of the cheek does not appear to be painted, but truly of  flesh and blood; he who looks earnestly at the pit of the throat  cannot but believe that he sees the beating of the pulses, and it may  be truly said that this work is painted in a manner well calculated to  make the boldest master tremble, and astonishes all who behold it,  however well accustomed to the marvels of art.    \"Monna Lisa was exceedingly beautiful, and while Leonardo was painting  her portrait, he took the precaution of keeping some one constantly  near her, to sing or play on instruments, or to jest and otherwise  amuse her, to the end that she might continue cheerful, and so that  her face might not exhibit the melancholy expression often imparted by  painters to the likenesses they take. In this portrait of Leonardo's,  on the contrary, there is so pleasing an expression, and a smile so  sweet, that while looking at it one thinks it rather divine than  human, and it has ever been esteemed a wonderful work, since life  itself could exhibit no other appearance.\"      [Illustration: LA JOCONDE: MONNA LISA      LEONARDO DA VINCI      _(Louvre)_]    King Francis I. (who met our Henry VIII. on the Field of the Cloth of  Gold) bought the picture of Monna Lisa from the artist for a sum of  money equal now to L20,000. It was on a visit to Francis that  Leonardo died. \"Monna Lisa\" was the most valuable picture in the  cabinet of Francis I. and was first hung there in 1545. It is very  interesting to think that this work, the peculiar glory of the  Gallery, should also be its nucleus, so to speak. The Venus of Milo  and the Winged Victory, which I have grouped with \"Monna Lisa\" as its  chief treasures, were not added until the last century.    Among other pictures in the Louvre which date from the inception of a  royal collection in the brain of Francis I. are the \"Virgin of the  Rocks\" by Leonardo, Raphael's \"Sainte Famille\" (No. 1498) and \"Saint  Michael,\" Andrea del Sarto's \"Charite\" and Piombo's \"Visitation\".  Louis XIII. began his reign with about fifty pictures and increased  them to two hundred, while under Louis XIV., the Louvre's most  conspicuous friend, the royal collection grew from these two hundred  to two thousand--assisted greatly by Colbert the financier, who bought  for the Crown not only much of the collection of the banker Jabach of  Cologne, the Pierpont Morgan of his day, who had acquired the art  treasures of our own Charles I., but also the Mazarin bibelots. Under  Louis XIV. and succeeding monarchs the pictures oscillated between the  Louvre,"]]]
