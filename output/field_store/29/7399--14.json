An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government (#14)"],[1,"rror, namely, that  the law is the expression of a will; it ought to be the expression of  a fact. Moreover they followed good leaders: they took the citizen of  Geneva for their prophet, and the contrat social for their Koran.    Bias and prejudice are apparent in all the phrases of the new  legislators. The nation had suffered from a multitude of exclusions and  privileges; its representatives issued the following declaration: ALL  MEN ARE EQUAL BY NATURE AND BEFORE THE LAW; an ambiguous and redundant  declaration. MEN ARE EQUAL BY NATURE: does that mean that they are equal  in size, beauty, talents, and virtue? No; they meant, then, political  and civil equality. Then it would have been sufficient to have said: ALL  MEN ARE EQUAL BEFORE THE LAW.    But what is equality before the law? Neither the constitution of 1790,  nor that of '93, nor the granted charter, nor the accepted charter, have  defined it accurately. All imply an inequality in fortune and station  incompatible with even a shadow of equality in rights. In this respect  it may be said that all our constitutions have been faithful expressions  of the popular will: I am going, to prove it.    Formerly the people were excluded from civil and military offices; it  was considered a wonder when the following high-sounding article  was inserted in the Declaration of Rights: \"All citizens are equally  eligible to office; free nations know no qualifications in their choice  of officers save virtues and talents.\"    They certainly ought to have admired so beautiful an idea: they admired  a piece of nonsense. Why! the sovereign people, legislators, and  reformers, see in public offices, to speak plainly, only opportunities  for pecuniary advancement. And, because it regards them as a source of  profit, it decrees the eligibility of citizens. For of what use would  this precaution be, if there were nothing to gain by it? No one would  think of ordaining that none but astronomers and geographers should be  pilots, nor of prohibiting stutterers from acting at the theatre and  the opera. The nation was still aping the kings: like them it wished  to award the lucrative positions to its friends and flatterers.  Unfortunately, and this last feature completes the resemblance, the  nation did not control the list of livings; that was in the hands of its  agents and representatives. They, on the other hand, took care not to  thwart the will of their gracious sovereign.    This edifying article of the Declaration of Rights, retained in the  charters of 1814 and 1830, implies several kinds of civil inequality;  that is, of inequality before the law: inequality of station, since the  public functions are sought only for the consideration and emoluments  which they bring; inequality of wealth, since, if it had been desired  to equalize fortunes, public service would have been regarded as a duty,  not as a reward; inequality of privilege, the law not stating what  it means by TALENTS and VIRTUES. Under the empire, virtue and talent  consisted simply in military bravery and devotion to the emperor; that  was shown when Napoleon created his nobility, and attempted to connect  it with the ancients. To-day, the man who pays taxes to the amount  of two hundred francs is virtuous; the talented man is the honest  pickpocket: such truths as these are accounted trivial.    The people finally legalized property. God forgive them, for they  knew not what they did! For fifty years they have suffered for their  miserable folly. But how came the people, whose voice, they tell us,  is the voice of God, and whose conscience is infallible,--how came the  people to err? How happens it that, when seeking liberty and equality,  they fell back into privilege and slavery? Always through copying the  ancient regime.    Formerly, the nobility and the clergy contributed towards the expenses  of the State only by voluntary aid and gratuitous gift; their property  could not be seized even for debt,--while the plebeian, overwhelmed by  taxes and statute-labor, was continually tormented, now by the  king's tax-gatherers, now by those of the nobles and clergy. He whose  possessions were subject to mortmain could neither bequeath nor inherit  property; he was treated like the animals, whose services and offspring  belong to their master by right of accession. The people wanted the  conditions of OWNERSHIP to be alike for all; they thought that every one  should ENJOY AND FREELY DISPOSE OF HIS POSSESSIONS HIS INCOME AND THE  FRUIT OF HIS LABOR AND INDUSTRY. The people did not invent property; but  as they had not the same privileges in regard to it, which the nobles  and clergy possessed, they decreed that the right should be exercised  by all under the same conditions. The more obnoxious forms of  property--statute-labor, mortmain, maitrise, and exclusion from public  office--have disappeared; the conditions of its enjoyment have been  modified: the principle still remains the same. There has been progress  in the regulation of the right; there has been no revolution.    These, then, are the three fundamental principles of modern society,  established one after another by the movements of 1789 and 1830: 1.  SOVEREIGNTY OF THE HUMAN WILL; in short, DESPOTISM. 2. INEQUALITY OF  WEALTH AND RANK. 3. PROPERTY--above JUSTICE, always invoked as the  guardian angel of sovereigns, nobles, and proprietors; JUSTICE, the  general, primitive, categorical law of all society.    We must ascertain whether the ideas of DESPOTISM, CIVIL INEQUALITY  and PROPERTY, are in harmony with the primitive notion of JUSTICE, and  necessarily follow from it,--assuming various forms according to the  condition, position, and relation of persons; or whether they are not  rather the illegitimate result of a confusion of different things, a  fatal association of ideas. And since justice deals especially with the  questions of government, the condition of persons, and the possession  of things, we must ascertain under what conditions, judging by universal  opinion and the progress of the human mind, government is just, the  condition of citizens is just, and the possession of things is just;  then, striking out every thing which fails to meet these conditions,  the result will at once tell us what legitimate government is, what the  legitimate condition of citizens is, and what the legitimate possession  of things is; and finally, as the last result of the analysis, what  JUSTICE is.    Is the authority of man over man just?    Everybody answers, \"No; the authority of man is only the authority of  the law, which ought to be justice and truth.\" The private will counts  for nothing in government, which consists, first, in discovering truth  and justice in order to make the law; and, second, in superintending the  execution of this law. I do not now inquire whether our constitutional  form of government satisfies these conditions; whether, for example, the  will of the ministry never influences the declaration and interpretation  of the law; or whether our deputies, in their debates, are more intent  on conquering by argument than by force of numbers: it is enough for me  that my definition of a good government is allowed to be correct. This  idea is exact. Yet we see that nothing seems more just to the Oriental  nations than the despotism of their sovereigns; that, with the ancients  and in the opinion of the philosophers themselves, slavery was just;  that in the middle ages the nobles, the priests, and the bishops felt  justified in holding slaves; that Louis XIV. thought that he was right  when he said, \"The State! I am the State;\" and that Napoleon deemed it  a crime for the State to oppose his will. The idea of justice, then,  applied to sovereignty and government, has not always been what it is  to-day; it has gone on developing and shaping itself by degrees, until  it has arrived at its present state. But has it reached its last phase?  I think not: only, as the last obstacle to be overcome arises from the  institution of property which we have kept intact, in order to finish  the reform in government and consummate the revolution, this very  institution we must attack.    Is political and civil inequality just?    Some say yes; others no. To the first I would reply that, when the  people abolished all privileges of birth and caste, they did it, in all  probability, because it was for their advantage; why then do they favor  the privileges of fortune more than those of rank and race? Because, say  they, political inequality is a result of property; and without property  society is impossible: thus the question just raised becomes a question  of property. To the second I content myself with this remark: If you  wish to enjoy political equality, abolish property; otherwise, why do  you complain?    Is property just?    Everybody answers without hesitation, \"Yes, property is just.\" I say  everybody, for up to the present time no one who thoroughly understood  the meaning of his words has answered no. For it is no easy thing to  reply understandingly to such a question; only time and experience can  furnish an answer. Now, this answer is given; it is for us to understand  it. I undertake to prove it.    We are to proceed with the demonstration in the following order:--    I. We dispute not at all, we refute nobody, we deny nothing; we accept  as sound all the arguments alleged in favor of property, and confine  ourselves to a search for its principle, in order that we may then  ascertain whether this principle is faithfully expressed by property. In  fact, property being defensible on no ground save that of justice, the  idea, or at least the intention, of justice must of necessity underlie  all the arguments that have been made in defence of property; and, as on  the other hand the right of property is only exercised over those things  which can be appreciated by the senses, justice, secretly objectifying  itself, so to speak, must "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36020"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#14)"],[1,"de oberseer do it; and de overseer was meaner dan de  massa. But, Mister, de peoples was de same as dey is now. Dere was good  uns and bad uns. I jus' happened to belong to a bad un.

Well suh, when  de massa found out dat he was a hour late, he got as mad as a hive of  bees. So when brother January he come home, de massa took down his long  mule skinner and tied him wid a rope to a pine tree. He strip' his shirt  off and said:    \"'Now, nigger, I'm goin' to teach you some sense.'    \"Wid dat he started layin' on de lashes. January was a big, fine lookin'  nigger; de finest I ever seed. He was jus' four years older dan me, an'  when de massa begin a beatin' him, January neber said a word.

'Don't it hurt?'    \"January, he neber said nothin', and de massa keep a beatin' till little  streams of blood started flowin' down January's chest, but he neber  holler.

De niggers was all gathered about and some uv 'em  couldn't stand it; dey hadda go inside dere cabins. Atter while,  January, he couldn't stand it no longer hisself, and he say in a hoarse,  loud whisper:    \"'Massa! Massa! have mercy on dis poor nigger.'    Will's eyes narrowed down to fine creases as his thick lips came  together in smacking noises, and the loose skin beneath his chin, and  jaws seemed to shake with the impact of dread memories.    \"Den,\" he continued, after a brief pause in which time there was no  sound except the constant drop of a bead of water in a lard bucket, \"de  war came. De Yankees come in and dey pulled de fruit off de trees and et  it. Dey et de hams and cawn, but dey neber burned de houses.

O'Brien, Uniontown, Alabama_    In the Negro section of Uniontown, locally known as \"Rabbit Yard\" (named  by the Negroes themselves), lives \"Aunt Tildy\" Collins, a typical \"black  mammy\" of orthodox type. She is a talkative old soul, running over with  slavery tales and greatly beloved by a wide range of acquaintances among  both races. Although eighty-four summers have passed over her snow-white  head, Aunt Tildy's spirit is unconquered by time and her physical  activity is truly remarkable for her age. She does her own housework and  cares for her home without assistance. In front of her one-room cabin is  a neat garden of vegetables and flowers combined, with morning glories  trained carefully over the fence nearly all the way around. There is a  saying in the South, that cotton will grow better for a Negro than for  any other race, and this might well be extended to include morning  glories in Aunt Tildy's case; since none in Uniontown are quite so fine  in growth or brilliance of coloring.    Like nearly all old Negroes, Aunt Tildy goes to sleep very readily. She  was dozing in a rocker on her small porch, while the scent of wood smoke  and the odor of boiling vegetables issued from the cabin. An iron pot,  hanging from a crane in the fireplace, sending forth clouds of steam and  an appetizing aroma. She clings to old fashioned equipment and disdains  a stove for cooking. Her \"biled\" vegetables or meats in the hanging pot,  with baked potatoes and \"pone\" bread from the oven make up a meal that  leaves little to be desired, as many visitors who have shared her  repasts well know.    As the gate squeaked, Aunt Tildy awoke with a start and a smile.    \"Come in, white folks, I was jes' a-settin' here waitin' for my greens  to bile, an' I musta drapped off to sleep. Set down in dat cheer right  dar, an' tek off your hat; you sho' is lookin' well, an' I'se proud to  see you.    \"Yas, ma'am, I sho' was borned in slavery times, an' I wish to Gawd I  could git now what I useter hab den, 'caze dem was good times for de  black folks. Dese free niggers don't know what 'tis to be tuk good keer  of.    \"Co'se I means dat! I was borned on a big plantation near 'bout to  Linden, an' my Ole Marster was name Harris, yassum, Dick Harris, an' my  Ole Mistis was Miss Mandy. Bofe dey boys fit in de wah, an' I 'members  when dey went off wid de sojers, ole Mistis she cry an' hug dem boys an'  kiss 'em goodbye, an' dey was gone a long time. I was a leetle gal  whenst dey went to de wah, an' I was mos' a grown 'oman when dey come  home, an' dey bofe had whiskers. Young Massa Richard he limpin' an' look  mighty pale, an' dey say he been wounded an' stay in prison on Mister  Johnson's island, summuz up de ribber; but Marse Willis, he look all  right, 'cep'in' whiskers. Ole Marster had a big house, an' dat same  house standin' dar right now. Us had plenty to eat an' plenty to wear,  an' dat's mo'n what some folks got now.    \"Ole Marster was good to all he niggers, an' my pappy and mammy bofe  belonged to him. Dey was a slave-yard in Uniontown, an' ev'y time a  spec'later cum wid a lot of new niggers, Ole Marster he buy four or five  niggers, an' dat's how he come to buy my pappy, atter de spec'later  brung him an' a whole passel of niggers from North C'lina. My mammy here  already 'long to Ole Marster. Her was borned his'n.    \"Sometime a no 'count nigger tek an' runned erway; but de oberseer, he  put de houn's on he track, an' dey run him up a tree, an' de oberseer  fetch him back nex' mawnin', all tuckerd out, an' he' glad to stay home  for a spell an' 'have hese'f. Ole Marster had a good oberseer, too.  'Cose he wan't no quality, lak Ole Marster an' Ole Mistis, but he was a  good, kin' man an' he didn't hab no trouble on de whole plantation.    \"Us alluz had a Chris'mus tree in de quarter, jes' lak de white folks  an' dey was presents for ev'ybody--nobody wan't lef' out, big or little.  Dere was a meetin' house on de plantation an' Ole Marster had a rule dat  all de chilluns had to go to Sunday school soon as dey was big 'nuff,  an' dey had to go in clean white clo'se, too. Us chilluns hate to see  Sunday come, 'caze Mammy an' Granmammy dey wash us an' near 'bout rub de  skin off gittin' us clean for Sunday school, an' dey comb our heads wid  a jimcrow. You ain't neber seed a jimcrow? Hit mos' lak a card what you  card wool wid. What a card look lak? Humph! Missy, whar you been  raise--ain't neber seed a card? Dat jimcrow sho' did hurt, but us hadder  stan' hit, an' sometimes atter all dat, Mammy she wrap our kinky hair  wid t'read an' twis' so tight us's eyes couldn't hardly shet.    \"My Granmammy, her de head cook 'oman at de big house, an' us had to  mine her lak us did Mammy.

Dey wan't lak dey is now, don't mine nobody, not  eben dey Pa.    \"When de surrender come, Ole Marster he tole all de niggers dey was free  now, an' some was glad an' some was sorry an' welst dey might be sorry,  iffen dey knowed what a hard time dey goner had knockin' 'roun' de worl'  by deyself; no Ole Marster an' no Ole Mistis ter look atter 'em an' feed  'em when dey sick an' when dey well. Look lak ter me, when de surrender  parted de white folks an' de black folks, it hurt 'em bofe. Dey oughter  be tergedder, jes' lak de Good Lord 'tended dey be.\"    Aunt Tildy sighed deeply and, gazing afar off, said: \"Iffen Ole Marster  was livin' now, I'd be all right an' not hafter worry 'bout nuffin.\"    In spite of her eighty-four years, Aunt Tildy makes her living as a  mid-wife and serves as a \"doctor man\" in cases of minor ailments; but  her practice is so closely interwoven with \"conju'in'\" that it is  difficult to say which is the more important to her. For example: she  prescribes wearing matches in the hair or a little salt on the mole of  the head for headache. Her sovereign remedy for rheumatism is \"'nint de  j'ints wid a little kerosene oil an' put some mullen leaves on it.\" \"A  good dost of turpentine is good for mos' anything de matter wid you.\" A  coin with a hole in it, usually a dime, tied around the ankle will keep  you from getting \"pizen.\" Furthermore, this same treatment warns against  the ill effects of getting \"conju'ed.\" \"Iffen you gits conju'ed, de dime  turn black, an' you kin go to de conju' doctor an' git de conju' took  off.\"    \"Is you got to go, Missy? Come back agin. I's allus proud to see you,\"  Aunt Tildy called after me from the edge of the porch.
