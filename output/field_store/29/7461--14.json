A droll criticism from the traveling  virtuoso, aged 14, in a letter to his mother and sister.)    180. \"Carefully thinking it over I conclude that in no country  have I received so many honors or been so highly appreciated  as in Italy. You get credit in Italy if you have written an  opera,--especially in Naples.\"    (Munich, October 11, 1777, to his father. An influential friend  had offered to help him get an appointment in Italy.)    181. \"Strassburg can't get along without me. You have no idea how  I am honored and loved here. The people say that everything I do  is refined, that I am so sedate and courteous and have so good a  bearing. Everybody knows me.\"    (Strassburg, October 26, 1778, to his father, on his return  journey from Paris. On October 3 he had written: \"I beg your  pardon if I cannot write much. It is because, unless I am in a  city in which I am well known, I am never in a good humor. If I  were acquainted here I would gladly stay, for the city is truly  charming--beautiful houses, handsome broad streets, and superb  squares.\")    182. \"Oh, what a difference between the people of the Palatinate  and of Bavaria! What a language! How coarse! To say nothing of  the mode of life!\"    (Mannheim, November 12, 1778, to his father. Mozart, while  returning from Paris, had stopped at his \"dear Mannheim,\" where  at the moment a regiment of Bavarian soldiers were quartered, and  had just got news of the rudeness with which the people of Munich  had treated their Elector.)    183. \"In Regensburg we dined magnificently at noon, listened to  divine table music, had angelic service and glorious Mosel wine.  We breakfasted in Nuremberg,--a hideous city. At Wurzburg we  strengthened our stomachs with coffee; a beautiful, a splendid  city. The charges were moderate everywhere. Only two post relays  from here, in Aschaffenburg, the landlord swindled us  shamefully.\"    (Frankfort-on-the-Main, September 29, 1790, to his wife. The  remark is notable because of the judgments pronounced on the  renaissance city Nuremberg, and the rococo city Wurzburg.)    184. \"All the talk about the imperial cities is mere boasting. I  am famous, admired and loved here, it is true, but the people are  worse than the Viennese in their parsimony.\"    (Mozart went to Frankfort, in 1790, on the occasion of the  coronation of the emperor, hoping to make enough money with  concerts to help himself out of financial difficulties, but  failed.)        LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP        Mozart's love for his father made him dependent on the latter to  the end of his days. He was a model son and must have loved his  wife devotedly, since, for her sake, he once in his life  disobeyed his father. The majority of his letters which have been  preserved are addressed to his father, to whom he reported all  his happenings and whose advice he is forever seeking. Similar  were his relations with his sister Marianne (Nannerl), whom he  loved with great tenderness. The letters to his wife are unique;  all of them, even the last, seem to be the letters of a lover.  They were a pair of turtle-doves.    Mozart was an ideal friend, ready to sacrifice to the uttermost  on the altar of friendship. It was this trait of character which  made him throw himself with enthusiasm into Freemasonry, whose  affiliations he sought to widen by drafting the constitution of a  community which he called \"The Grotto.\" He probably hated only  one man in the world,--the Archbishop of Salzburg, his tormentor.    185. \"The moment you do not trust me I shall distrust myself.  The time is past, it is true, when I used to stand on the settle,  sing oragna fiagata fa and kiss the tip end of your nose; but  have I therefore shown laxity in respect, love and obedience?  I say no more.\"    (Mannheim, February 19, 1779, to his father, who was vexed  because Mozart was showing a disposition to stay in Mannheim,  because of a love affair, instead of going to Paris. \"Off with  you to Paris, and soon!\" wrote the father. The Italian words are  meaningless and but a bit of child's play, the nature of which  can be gathered from Mozart's remark.)    186. \"Pray do not let your mind often harbor the thought that I  shall ever forget you! It is intolerable to me. My chief aim in  life has been, is, and will be to strive so that we may soon be  reunited and happy....Reflect that you have a son who will never  consciously forget his filial duty toward you, and who will labor  ever to grow more worthy of so good a father.\"    (Mannheim, February 28, 1778, to his father.)    187. \"The first thing I did after reading your letter was to go  on my knees, and, out of a full heart, thank my dear God for this  mercy. Now I am again at peace, since I know that I need no  longer be concerned about the two persons who are the dearest  things on earth to me.\"    (Paris, July 31, 1778, to his father, who had written that he and  Nannerl had comforted each other on the death of his mother.)    188. \"Dearest, best of fathers! I wish you all conceivable good;  whatever can be wished, that I wish you,--but no, I wish you  nothing, but myself everything. For myself, then, I wish that you  remain well and live innumerable years to my great happiness and  pleasure; I wish that everything that I undertake may agree with  your desire and liking,--or, rather, that I may undertake nothing  which might not turn out to your joy. This also I hope, for  whatever adds to the happiness of your son must naturally be  agreeable also to you.\"    (Vienna, November 16, 1781, to his father, congratulating him on  his name-day. On March 17, 1778, Mozart had written from  Mannheim: \"Your accuracy extends to all things. 'Papa comes  directly after God' was my maxim as a child and I shall stick to  it.\")    189. \"Our little cousin is pretty, sensible, amiable, clever and  merry, all because she has been in society; she visited Munich  for a while. You are right, we suit each other admirably, for  she, too, is a bit naughty. We play great pranks on the people  hereabouts.\"    (Augsburg, October 17, 1777, to his father. The \"little cousin\"  was two years younger than Mozart. Her father was a master  bookbinder in Augsburg. The maiden seems later to have had  serious designs on the composer.)    190. \"I shall be right glad when I meet a place in which there is  a court. I tell you that if I did not have so fine a Mr. Cousin  and Miss Cousin and so dear a little cousin, my regrets that I am  in Augsburg would be as numerous as the hairs of my head.\"    (Augsburg, October 17, 1777, to his father, whose birthplace he  was visiting on a concert tour. Mozart was vexed at the insolence  of the patricians.)    191. \"In the case of Frau Lange I was a fool,--that's certain;  but what is a fellow not when he's in love? I did really love  her, and am not indifferent toward her even now. It's lucky for  me that her husband is a jealous fool and never permits her to go  anywhere, so that I seldom see her.\"    (Vienna, May 12, 1781, to his father, at the time when he was  being outrageously treated by the Archbishop. Frau Lange was  Aloysia Weber, sister of Constanze, to whom Mozart transferred  his love and whom he made his wife. Aloysia married an actor at  the Court Theatre, Josef Lange, with whom she lived unhappily.)    192. \"I will not say that when at the house of the Mademoiselle  to whom I seem already to have been married off, I am morose and  silent; but neither am I in love. I jest with her and amuse her  when I have time (which is only evenings when I sup at home, for  in the forenoons I write in my room and in the afternoons I am  seldom at home); only that and nothing more. If I were obliged to  marry all the girls with whom I have jested I should have at  least 200 wives.\"    (Vienna, July 25, 1781, to his father, who had heard all manner  of tales concerning the relations of Mozart and Constanze Weber.)    193. \"My good, dear Constanze is the martyr, and, perhaps for  that very reason, the best hearted, cleverest, and (in a word)  the best of them all. She assumes all the cares of the house, and  yet does not seem able to accomplish anything. O, best of  fathers, I could write pages if I were to tell you all the scenes  that have taken place in this house because of us  two....Constanze is not ugly, but anything but beautiful; all her  beauty consists of two little black eyes and a handsome figure.  She is not witty but has enough common sense to be able to  perform her duties as wife and mother. She is not inclined to  finery,--that is utterly false; on the contrary, she is generally  ill clad, for the little that the mother was able to do for her  children was done for the other two--nothing for her. True she  likes to be neatly and cleanly, though not extravagantly,  dressed, and she can herself make most of the clothes that a  woman needs; she also dresses her own hair every day, understands  housekeeping, has the best heart in the world,--tell me, could I  wish a better wife?\"    (Vienna, December 15, 1781, to his father. Constanze seems to  have been made for Mozart; they went through the years of their  brief wedded life like two children.)    194. \"Dearest, best of friends!\"    \"Surely you will let me call you that? You can not hate me so  greatly as not to permit me to be your friend, and yourself to  become mine? And even if you do not want to be my friend longer,  you can not forbid me to think kindly of you as I have been in  the habit of doing. Consider well what you said to me today.  Despite my entreaties you gave me the mitten three times and told  me to my face that you would have nothing further to do with me.

In a letter still extant he regrets that  when he visited her after death he had kissed her hands only.  He  made, or set to work to make, a crucifix for her use, and two  drawings, perhaps in preparation for it, are now in Oxford.  From  allusions in the sonnets, we may divine that when they first  approached each other he had debated much with himself  whether this last passion would be the most unsoftening, the most  desolating of all--un dolce amaro, un sì e no mi muovi.  Is it  carnal affection, or, del suo prestino stato (of Plato's ante-natal  state) il raggio ardente?  The older, conventional criticism,  dealing with the text of 1623, had lightly assumed that all or  nearly all the sonnets were actually addressed to Vittoria herself;  but Signor Guasti finds only four, or at most five, which can be  so attributed on genuine authority.  Still, there are reasons which  make him assign the majority of them to [85] the period between  1542 and 1547, and we may regard the volume as a record of this  resting-place in Michelangelo's story.  We know how Goethe  escaped from the stress of sentiments too strong for him by  making a book about them; and for Michelangelo, to write down  his passionate thoughts at all, to express them in a sonnet, was  already in some measure to command, and have his way with  them--         La vita del mia amor non è il cor mio,       Ch' amor, di quel ch' io t' amo, è senza core.    It was just because Vittoria raised no great passion that the space  in his life where she reigns has such peculiar suavity; and the  spirit of the sonnets is lost if we once take them out of that  dreamy atmosphere in which men have things as they will,  because the hold of all outward things upon them is faint and  uncertain.  Their prevailing tone is a calm and meditative  sweetness.  The cry of distress is indeed there, but as a mere  residue, a trace of bracing chalybeate salt, just discernible in the  song which rises like a clear, sweet spring from a charmed space  in his life.    This charmed and temperate space in Michelangelo's life,  without which its excessive strength would have been so  imperfect, which saves him from the judgment of Dante on those  who \"wilfully lived in sadness,\" is then a well-defined period  there, reaching from the year 1542 to the year 1547, the year of  Vittoria's death.  In [86] it the lifelong effort to tranquillise his  vehement emotions by withdrawing them into the region of ideal  sentiment, becomes successful; and the significance of Vittoria is,  that she realises for him a type of affection which even in  disappointment may charm and sweeten his spirit.    In this effort to tranquillise and sweeten life by idealising its  vehement sentiments, there were two great traditional types,  either of which an Italian of the sixteenth century might have  followed.  There was Dante, whose little book of the Vita Nuova  had early become a pattern of imaginative love, maintained  somewhat feebly by the later followers of Petrarch; and, since  Plato had become something more than a name in Italy by the  publication of the Latin translation of his works by Marsilio  Ficino, there was the Platonic tradition also.  Dante's belief in the  resurrection of the body, through which, even in heaven, Beatrice  loses for him no tinge of flesh-colour, or fold of raiment even;  and the Platonic dream of the passage of the soul through one  form of life after another, with its passionate haste to escape from  the burden of bodily form altogether; are, for all effects of art or  poetry, principles diametrically opposite.  Now it is the Platonic  tradition rather than Dante's that has moulded Michelangelo's  verse.  In many ways no sentiment could have been less like  Dante's love for Beatrice than Michelangelo's for Vittoria  Colonna.  Dante's comes in early youth: Beatrice [87] is a child,  with the wistful, ambiguous vision of a child, with a character  still unaccentuated by the influence of outward circumstances,  almost expressionless.  Vittoria, on the other hand, is a woman  already weary, in advanced age, of grave intellectual qualities.  Dante's story is a piece of figured work, inlaid with lovely  incidents.  In Michelangelo's poems, frost and fire are almost the  only images--the refining fire of the goldsmith; once or twice the  phoenix; ice melting at the fire; fire struck from the rock which it  afterwards consumes.  Except one doubtful allusion to a journey,  there are almost no incidents.  But there is much of the bright,  sharp, unerring skill, with which in boyhood he gave the look of  age to the head of a faun by chipping a tooth from its jaw with a  single stroke of the hammer.  For Dante, the amiable and devout  materialism of the middle age sanctifies all that is presented by  hand and eye; while Michelangelo is always pressing forward  from the outward beauty--il bel del fuor che agli occhi piace, to  apprehend the unseen beauty; trascenda nella forma universale--  that abstract form of beauty, about which the Platonists reason.  And this gives the impression in him of something flitting and  unfixed, of the houseless and complaining spirit, almost  clairvoyant through the frail and yielding flesh.  He accounts for  love at first sight by a previous state of existence--la dove io t'  amai prima.    And yet there are many points in which he [88] is really like  Dante, and comes very near to the original image, beyond those  later and feebler followers in the wake of Petrarch.  He learns  from Dante rather than from Plato, that for lovers, the surfeiting  of desire--ove gran desir gran copia affrena, is a state less happy  than poverty with abundance of hope--una miseria di speranza  piena.  He recalls him in the repetition of the words gentile and  cortesia, in the personification of Amor, in the tendency to dwell  minutely on the physical effects of the presence of a beloved  object on the pulses and the heart.  Above all, he resembles Dante  in the warmth and intensity of his political utterances, for the lady  of one of his noblest sonnets was from the first understood to be  the city of Florence; and he avers that all must be asleep in  heaven, if she, who was created \"of angelic form,\" for a thousand  lovers, is appropriated by one alone, some Piero, or Alessandro  de' Medici.  Once and again he introduces Love and Death, who  dispute concerning him.  For, like Dante and all the nobler souls  of Italy, he is much occupied with thoughts of the grave, and his  true mistress is death,--death at first as the worst of all sorrows  and disgraces, with a clod of the field for its brain; afterwards,  death in its high distinction, its detachment from vulgar needs,  the angry stains of life and action escaping fast.    Some of those whom the gods love die young.  This man,  because the gods loved him, lingered [89] on to be of immense,  patriarchal age, till the sweetness it had taken so long to secrete  in him was found at last.  Out of the strong came forth sweetness,  ex forti dulcedo.  The world had changed around him.  The \"new  catholicism\" had taken the place of the Renaissance.  The spirit  of the Roman Church had changed: in the vast world's cathedral  which his skill had helped to raise for it, it looked stronger than  ever.  Some of the first members of the Oratory were among his  intimate associates.  They were of a spirit as unlike as possible  from that of Lorenzo, or Savonarola even.  The opposition of the  Reformation to art has been often enlarged upon; far greater was  that of the Catholic revival.  But in thus fixing itself in a frozen  orthodoxy, the Roman Church had passed beyond him, and he  was a stranger to it.  In earlier days, when its beliefs had been in a  fluid state, he too might have been drawn into the controversy.  He might have been for spiritualising the papal sovereignty, like  Savonarola; or for adjusting the dreams of Plato and Homer with  the words of Christ, like Pico of Mirandola.  But things had  moved onward, and such adjustments were no longer possible.  For himself, he had long since fallen back on that divine ideal,  which above the wear and tear of creeds has been forming itself  for ages as the possession of nobler souls.  And now he began to  feel the soothing influence which since that time the Roman [90]  Church has often exerted over spirits too independent to be its  subjects, yet brought within the neighbourhood of its action;  consoled and tranquillised, as a traveller might be, resting for one  evening in a strange city, by its stately aspect and the sentiment  of its many fortunes, just because with those fortunes he has  nothing to do.  So he lingers on; a revenant, as the French say, a  ghost out of another age, in a world too coarse to touch his faint  sensibilities very closely; dreaming, in a worn-out society,  theatrical in its life, theatrical in its art, theatrical even in its  devotion, on the morning of the world's history, on the primitive  form of man, on the images under which that primitive world had  conceived of spiritual forces.    I have dwelt on the thought of Michelangelo as thus lingering  beyond his time in a world not his own, because, if one is to  distinguish the peculiar savour of his work, he must be  approached, not through his followers, but through his  predecessors; not through the marbles of Saint Peter's, but  through the work of the sculptors of the fifteenth century over the  tombs and altars of Tuscany.  He is the last of the Florentines, of  those on whom the peculiar sentiment of the Florence of Dante  and Giotto descended: he is the consummate representative of the  form that sentiment took in the fifteenth century with men like  Luca Signorelli and Mino [91] da Fiesole.  Up to him the  tradition of sentiment is unbroken, the progress towards surer and  more mature methods of"]]]
