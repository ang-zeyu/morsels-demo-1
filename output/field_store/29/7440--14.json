The third phalanges are each enclosed in a horny hoof, to which the name  of _onglon_ has been given.    We have already drawn attention to the smaller lateral digits, and  noted the general fact that they do not come in contact with the ground.  It is necessary to modify this statement by adding that under certain  conditions they give a slight amount of support; for example, when the  individual is the subject of excessive obesity, the limbs yield under  the weight, and the nails of the lateral digits may touch the ground.    A similar fact may be noticed in pigs of ordinary bulk at the moment  when, during walking, each of the fore-limbs commences to bear the  weight--that is to say, when it is directed obliquely downwards and  forwards; then all the digits are in contact with the ground.    =Unguligrades (Ungulates)=: =Sheep=, =Ox= (Fig. 39).--The scapula, which  is of elongated form, is very narrow in the vicinity of the glenoid  cavity. The spine, which becomes more and more salient towards its  inferior part, terminates abruptly in a border, which, forming an acute  angle with the crest, produces a projection which represents the  acromion process--a very rudimentary acromion, for it does not reach the  level of the glenoid cavity. The supraspinous fossa is much smaller than  the infraspinous; it hardly equals one-third the extent of the latter.  The anterior border, thin and convex in its superior portion, is concave  in the rest of its extent; the posterior border is thick and slightly  concave; the spinal border is surmounted by the cartilage of  prolongation. In the ox the spine of the scapula, in its middle portion,  is flexed a little backwards on the infraspinous fossa.    [Illustration: FIG. 39.--SKELETON OF THE OX: LEFT LATERAL SURFACE.    1, Cranium; 2, face; 3, atlas; 4, axis; 5, seventh cervical vertebra; 6,  first dorsal vertebra; 7, thirteenth and last dorsal vertebra; 8, lumbar  vertebrae; 9, sacrum; 10, coccygeal vertebrae; 11, sternum; 12, xiphoid  appendix; 13, eighth and last sternal rib; 14, costal cartilages; 15,  spine of scapula; 16, cartilage of prolongation of the scapula; 17,  great tuberosity of the humerus; 18, musculo-spiral groove; 19,  olecranon process; 20, radius; 21, carpus; 22, pisiform; 23, metacarpus;  24, rudimentary metacarpal; 25, sesamoid bones; 26, first phalanges; 27,  second phalanges; 28, third phalanges; 29, anterior iliac spine; 30,  pubis; 31, tuberosity of the ischium; 32, great trochanter; 33,  supracondyloid fossa of the femur; 34, patella, or knee-cap; 35,  anterior tuberosity of the tibia; 36, fibula; 37, coronoid tarsal bone;  38, tarsus; 39, calcaneum; 40, metatarsus; 41, rudimentary metatarsus;  42, sesamoid bones; 43, first phalanges; 44, second phalanges; 45, third  phalanges.]    The great tuberosity of the humerus is highly developed; its summit,  very prominent, is flexed over the bicipital groove; a prominence of the  small tuberosity also bends over the groove, with the result that at  this level the latter is converted into a sort of canal. At the inferior  extremity the condyle, although not large, is recognisable; for it is  separated from the trochlea by a depression in form of a groove. In  contrast to the condition found in man, the condyle descends to a level  a little below that of the internal lip of the trochlea. (For the  arrangement of the epicondyle and the epitrochlea, see p. 30.) In the  sheep, the deltoid impression is but slightly marked; in the ox, it is  more evident.    The forearm is directed obliquely downwards and inwards, so as to form,  with the hand, an angle of which the apex is internal; this angular  outline of the _knee_ (wrist) is so characteristic of ruminants that the  corresponding region of the horse, when salient inwards, receives the  name of _ox-knee_. The radius bears the coronoid process, and the larger  part of the articular surface which comes in contact with the inferior  extremity of the humerus; the condyle and the trochlea articulate with  the radius in front; while behind, the trochlea articulates with that  part of the sigmoid cavity which belongs to the ulna. The posterior  surface of the shaft of the radius is flattened; its anterior surface is  slightly convex. The inferior extremity articulates with the carpus by a  surface which is directed obliquely downwards and inwards. The shaft of  the ulna is very slender, and fused in its middle third with the body of  the radius; it terminates below, at the level of the external part of  the inferior extremity of the radius, by a slightly expanded portion  which, fused with this latter, forms the articular surface for the  carpal bones.    In the ox the forearm is short; in the sheep it is proportionally  longer.    The bones of the carpus are six in number--four in the upper row, and  two in the lower; they form an irregular cuboid mass which contributes  to the formation of the region known as _the knee_ in ruminants, as in  the horse; we have already remarked that the name 'wrist' would be more  accurate. The anterior surface in its foremost part is vertical, and is  slightly convex from side to side. At its posterior and external part  the pisiform bone forms a prominence.    The metacarpus consists of two bones only--one, well developed, which is  known as the principal metacarpal, or the _canon_ bone (this is the name  given to the region in the hoofed animals); and a rudimentary one, which  is situated at the superior and external aspect of the preceding  metacarpal. Sometimes there is found a third metacarpal at the internal  aspect; but, when present, it is but very slightly developed.    The principal metacarpal consists of two metacarpals fused together; on  this account the bone is longitudinally marked in the median line by a  slight depression which marks the junction of the two bones of which it  is formed. In some ruminants (certain species of chevrotains) the  coalescence does not take place, and the two metacarpals remain  separate.    The anterior surface of the principal metacarpal is convex transversely;  its posterior surface is flattened. The superior extremity of this bone  articulates by two facets with the two bones of the inferior row of the  carpus; on the internal part of the anterior surface of this extremity  is found a tubercle. The inferior extremity is divided into two parts by  a fissure or notch; each part is articular, and consists of two separate  condyles, which are separated from each other by an antero-posterior  crest; on each side of this crest, and behind, are found two sesamoid  bones. As for the external rudimentary metacarpal bone, it is nothing  more than a small, short tongue of bone; which, in goats and sheep, is  often absent.    The division of the inferior extremity of the principal metacarpal into  two parts is correlated with the two perfect digits which give the foot  of the ruminant its forked appearance. Each digit consists of three  phalanges, which are directed obliquely downwards and forwards; further,  these phalanges are inclined a little outwards from the axis of the  limb, so that the two digits diverge from each other as they descend.    The first phalanx, which is the longest, articulates superiorly with the  principal metacarpal; its inferior extremity terminates in a trochlea,  and the lip of this, which is situated towards the axis of the limb,  descends lower than that of the opposite side; this arrangement is  correlated with the divergent direction of the digits. The second  phalanx has its superior extremity moulded on the trochlea which  terminates the extremity of the first; its inferior extremity is  articular, and elongated from before backwards. On the posterior  surface of this extremity is found a sesamoid bone.    With regard to the third phalanx, it presents the form of a triangular  pyramid, and displays a postero-superior concave surface with which the  second phalanx articulates; an anterior, convex surface, which  terminates in a point on its anterior part; and an internal surface,  which is flattened. The third phalanx of each digit is contained in a  hoof (_onglon_).    There is also found in ruminants two imperfect rudimentary digits, which  are represented by two small bones situated behind the articulation of  the metacarpal and the digits which we have just been studying. These  rudimentary digits are each enveloped in a layer of horn; they  constitute the _spurs_. The two digits of the ruminants represent the  third and fourth fingers of the human hand; the two lateral digits,  greatly atrophied, are the homologues of the second and fifth fingers;  the thumb is not present.    It is the same as regards the metacarpal bones, which form, by their  union, the principal metacarpal; the external represents the fourth  metacarpal, and the internal the third. It is to the latter that the  tubercle, of which we have already made mention, belongs; and with the  signification of which, because it gives attachment to a muscle, we  shall concern ourselves in the section on myology (see Radial Muscles).    =Unguligrades=: =Horse= (Fig. 40).--The scapula is narrow, compared with  that of the animals we have just been considering. The anterior border  is convex in its superior portion, and concave in its inferior; the  posterior border is slightly hollowed out. The supraspinous fossa is  less in extent than the infraspinous; but the difference is less  than that between the same fossae in the ox and the sheep; in the  ox, as we have already indicated, the proportion is one-third; in  the horse, one-half. The spine, which disappears at the extremities,  is rough and thick in its middle third, there forming a kind of  tuberosity--_tuberosity of the spine_. Above and in front of the glenoid  cavity is found a strong process consisting of a rugous base, and a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3833"],[0,"Australian Legendary Tales: folk-lore of the Noongahburrahs as told to the (#14)"],[1,"for  some time. As soon as the supply was finished the same plan to obtain  more was repeated.    The black fellows missed so many of their friends that they determined  to find out what had become of them. They began to suspect the old  woman who lived alone and hunted over the moorillahs with her two  little dogs. They proposed that the next party that went to the creek  should divide and some stay behind in hiding and watch what went on.  Those watching saw the old woman advance towards their friends, talk to  them for a while, and then go off with her two dogs. They saw their  friends station themselves at the point of the moorillah or ridge,  holding their nullahs in readiness, as if waiting for something to  come. Presently they heard a low cry from the old woman of \"Birree  gougou,\" which cry was quickly followed by dingoes coming out of the  bush in every direction, in hundreds, surrounding the black fellows at  the point.    The dingoes closed in, quickly hemming the black fellows in all round;  then they made a simultaneous rush at them, tore them with their teeth,  and killed them.    The black fellows watching, saw that when the dogs had killed their  friends they were joined by the old woman, who helped them to drag off  the bodies to their camp.    Having seen all this, back went the watchers to their tribe and told  what they had seen. All the tribes round mustered up and decided to  execute a swift vengeance. In order to do so, out they sallied well  armed. A detachment went on to entrap the dogs and Bougoodoogahdah.  Then just when the usual massacre of the blacks was to begin and the  dogs were closing in round them for the purpose, out rushed over two  hundred black fellows, and so effectual was their attack that every dog  was killed, as well as Bougoodoogahdah and her two little dogs.    The old woman lay where she had been slain, but as the blacks went away  they heard her cry \"Bougoodoogahdah.\" So back they went and broke her  bones, first they broke her legs and then left her. But again as they  went they heard her cry \"Bougoodoogahdah.\" Then back again they came,  and again, until at last every bone in her body was broken, but still  she cried \"Bougoodoogahdah.\" So one man waited beside her to see whence  came the sound, for surely, they thought, she must be dead. He saw her  heart move and cry again \"Bougoodoogahdah\" and as it cried, out came a  little bird from it. This little bird runs on the moorillahs and calls  at night \"Bougoodoogahdah.\" All day it stays in one place, and only at  night comes out. It is a little greyish bird, something like a weedah.  The blacks call it a rain-maker, for if any one steals its eggs it  cries out incessantly \"Bougoodoogahdah\" until in answer to its call the  rain falls. And when the country is stricken with a drought, the blacks  look for one of these little birds, and finding it, chase it, until it  cries aloud \"Bougoodoogahdah, Bougoodoogahdah\" and when they hear its  cry in the daytime they know the rain will soon fall.    As the little bird flew from the heart of the woman, all the dead  dingoes were changed into snakes, many different kinds, all poisonous.  The two little dogs were changed into dayall minyah, a very small kind  of carpet snake, non-poisonous, for these two little dogs had never  bitten the blacks as the other dogs had done. At the points of the  Moorillahs where Bougoodoogahdah and her dingoes used to slay the  blacks, are heaps of white stones, which are supposed to be the  fossilised bones of the massacred men.          26.  THE BORAH OF BYAMEE      Word had been passed from tribe to tribe, telling, how that the season  was good, there must be a great gathering of the tribes. And the place  fixed for the gathering was Googoorewon. The old men whispered that it  should be the occasion for a borah, but this the women must not know.  Old Byamee, who was a great Wirreenun, said he would take his two sons,  Ghindahindahmoee and Boomahoomahnowee, to the gathering of the tribes,  for the time had come when they should be made young men, that they  might be free to marry wives, eat emu flesh, and learn to be warriors.    As tribe after tribe arrived at Googoorewon, each took up a position at  one of the various points of the ridges, surrounding the clear open  space where the corrobborees were to be. The Wahn, crows, had one  point; the Dummerh, pigeons, another; the Mahthi, dogs, another, and so  on; Byamee and his tribe, Byahmul the black swans tribe, Oooboon, the  blue tongued lizard, and many other chiefs and their tribes, each had  their camp on a different point. When all had arrived there were  hundreds and hundreds assembled, and many and varied were the nightly  corrobborees, each tribe trying to excel the other in the fancifulness  of their painted get-up, and the novelty of their newest song and  dance. By day there was much hunting and feasting, by night much  dancing and singing; pledges of friendship exchanged, a dillibag for a  boomerang, and so on; young daughters given to old warriors, old women  given to young men, unborn girls promised to old men, babies in arms  promised to grown men; many and diverse were the compacts entered into,  and always were the Wirreenun, or doctors of the tribes consulted.    After some days the Wirreenun told the men of the tribes that they were  going to hold a borah. But on no account must the innerh, or women,  know. Day by day they must all go forth as if to hunt and then prepare  in secret the borah ground. Out went the man each day. They cleared a  very large circle quite clear, then they built an earthen dam round  this circle, and cleared a pathway leading into the thick bush from the  circle, and built a dam on either side of this pathway.    When all these preparations were finished, they had, as usual, a  corrobboree at night. After this had been going on for some time, one  of the old Wirreenun walked right away from the crowd as if he were  sulky. He went to his camp, to where he was followed by another  Wirreenun, and presently the two old fellows began fighting. Suddenly,  when the attention of the blacks was fixed on this fight, there came a  strange, whizzing, whirring noise from the scrub round. The women and  children shrank together, for the sudden, uncanny noise frightened  them. And they knew that it was made by the spirits who were coming to  assist at the initiation of the boys into young manhood. The noise  really sounded, if you had not the dread of spirits in your mind, just  as if some one had a circular piece of wood at the end of a string and  were whirling it round and round.    As the noise went on, the women said, in an awestricken tone,  \"Gurraymy,\" that is \"borah devil,\" and clutched their children tighter  to them. The boys said \"Gayandy,\" and their eyes extended with fear.  \"Gayandy\" meant borah devil too, but the women must not even use the  same word as the boys and men to express the borah spirit, for all  concerning the mysteries of borah are sacred from the ears, eyes, or  tongues of women.    The next day a shift was made of the camps. They were moved to inside  the big ring that the black fellows had made. This move was attended  with a certain amount of ceremony. In the afternoon, before the move  had taken place, all the black fellows left their camps and went away  into the scrub. Then just about sundown they were all to be seen  walking in single file out of the scrub, along the path which they had  previously banked on each side. Every man had a fire stick in one hand  and a green switch in the other. When these men reached the middle of  the enclosed ring was the time for the young people and women to leave  the old camps, and move into the borah ring. Inside this ring they made  their camps, had their suppers and corrobboreed, as on previous  evenings, up to a certain stage. Before, on this occasion, that stage  arrived, Byamee, who was greatest of the Wirreenun present, had shown  his power in a remarkable way. For some days the Mahthi had been  behaving with a great want of respect for the wise men of the tribes.  Instead of treating their sayings and doings with the silent awe the  Wirreenun expect, they had kept up an incessant chatter and laughter  amongst themselves, playing and shouting as if the tribes were not  contemplating the solemnisation of their most sacred rites. Frequently  the Wirreenun sternly bade them be silent. But admonitions were  useless, gaily chattered and laughed the Mahthi. At length Byamee,  mightiest and most famous of the Wirreenun, rose, strode over to the  camp of Mahthi, and said fiercely to them: \"I, Byamee, whom all the  tribes hold in honour, have thrice bade you Mahthi cease your chatter  and laughter. But you heeded me not. To my voice were added the voices  of the Wirreenun of other tribes. But you heeded not. Think you the  Wirreenun will make any of your tribe young men when you heed not their  words? No, I tell you. From this day forth no Mahthi shall speak again  as men speak. You wish to make noise, to be a noisy tribe and a  disturber of men; a tribe who cannot keep quiet when strangers are in  the camp; a tribe who understand not sacred things. So be it. You  shall, and your descendants, for ever make a noise, but it shall not be  the noise of speech, or the noise of laughter. It shall be the noise of  barking and the noise of howling. And from this day if ever a Mahthi  speaks, woe to those who hear him, for even as they hear shall they be  turned to stone.\"    And as the Mahthi opened their mouths, and tried to laugh and speak  derisive words, they found, even as Byamee said, so were they. They  could but bark and howl; the powers of speech and laughter had they  lost. And as they realised their loss, into their eyes came a look of  yearning and dumb entreaty which will be seen in the eyes of their  descendants for ever. A feeling of wonder and awe fell on the various  camps as"]]]
