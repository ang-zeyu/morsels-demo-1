Things had been going too rapidly  for him, his heavy wits were badly addled, and he needed time to compose  himself and get a fresh grip on the situation. There was only one other  chair on the veranda. Perceiving this, Van Slyck sprang forward and  placed it for Koyala, smiling satirically as he did so. Koyala frowned  with annoyance, hesitated a moment, then accepted it. Van Slyck swung a  leg over the veranda rail.    \"Your message, my dear Koyala,\" he prompted. He used the term of  endearment lingeringly, with a quick side glance at Muller, but the  _controlleur_ was oblivious to both.    \"The message is for Mynheer Muller,\" Koyala announced icily.    \"Ah? So?\" Van Slyck swung the leg free and rose. \"Then I am not needed.  I bid the dear bother and sister adieux.\"    He made an elaborate French bow and started to leave. The embarrassed  Muller made a hasty protest.    \"Ho, _kapitein_!\" he cried, \"do not leave us. _Donder en bliksem!_ the  message may be for us both. Who is it from, Koyala?\"    Van Slyck was divided between two desires. He saw that Muller was in a  panic at the thought of being left alone with Koyala, and for that  reason was keenly tempted to get out of sight as quickly as possible. On  the other hand he was curious to hear her communication, aware that only  a matter of unusual import could have called her from the bush.  Undecided, he lingered on the steps.    \"It was from Ah Sing,\" Koyala announced.    Van Slyck's indecision vanished. He stepped briskly back on the porch.    \"From Ah Sing?\" he exclaimed. \"Mynheer Muller and I were just discussing  his affairs. Does it concern the new resident we are to have?\"    \"It does,\" Koyala acknowledged.    \"Who is it?\" Muller and the captain cried in the same breath.    Koyala glanced vindictively at Van Slyck.    \"You are sure that you will not sell me to him, _mynheer kapitein_?\"    Van Slyck scowled. \"Tell us about the resident,\" he directed curtly.    Koyala's eyes sparkled maliciously.    \"The new resident, _mynheer kapitein_, seems to have a higher opinion of  me than you have. You see, he has already persuaded the governor to  withdraw the offer he made for my person.\"    Van Slyck bit his lip, but ignored the thrust.    \"Then he's one of us?\" he demanded bruskly.    \"On the contrary, he is a most dangerous enemy,\" Koyala contradicted.    \"_Lieve hemel_, don't keep us waiting,\" Muller cried impatiently. \"Who  is it, Koyala?\"    \"A sailor, _mynheer_,\" Koyala announced.    \"A sailor?\" Van Slyck exclaimed incredulously. \"Who?\"    \"Mynheer Peter Gross, of Batavia.\"    Van Slyck and Muller stared at each other blankly, each vainly trying to  recall ever having heard the name before.    \"Pieter Gross, Pieter Gross, he must be a newcomer,\" Van Slyck remarked.  \"I have not heard of him before, have you, _mynheer_?\"    \"There is no one by that name in the colonial service,\" Muller declared,  shaking his head. \"You say he is of Batavia, Koyala?\"    \"Of Batavia, _mynheer_, but by birth and upbringing, and everything  else, a Yankee.\"    \"A Yankee?\" her hearers chorused incredulously.    \"Yes, a Yankee. Mate on a trading vessel, or so he was a year ago. He  has been in the Indies the past seven years.\"    Van Slyck broke into a roar of laughter.    \"Now, by the beard of Nassau, what joke is Chanticleer playing us now?\"  he cried. \"He must be anxious to get that Yankee out of the way.\"    Neither Koyala nor Muller joined in his mirth. Muller frowned  thoughtfully. There was the look in his eyes of one who is striving to  recollect some almost forgotten name or incident.    \"Pieter Gross, Pieter Gross,\" he repeated thoughtfully. \"Where have I  heard that name before?\"    \"Do you remember what happened to Gogolu of Lombock the time he captured  Lieutenant de Koren and his commando?\" Koyala asked. \"How an American  sailor and ten of his crew surprised Gogolu's band, killed a great many  of them, and took their prisoners away from them? That was Pieter  Gross.\"    \"_Donder en bliksem._ I knew I had reason to remember that name,\" Muller  cried in alarm. \"We have no Mynheer de Jonge to deal with this time,  _kapitein_. This Yankee is a fighter.\"    \"Good!\" Van Slyck exclaimed with satisfaction. \"We will give him his  bellyful. There will be plenty for him to do in the bush, eh, _mynheer_?  And if he gets too troublesome there are always ways of getting rid of  him.\" He raised his eyebrows significantly.    \"This Yankee is no fool,\" Muller rejoined anxiously. \"I heard about that  Lombock affair--it was a master coup. We have a bad man to deal with,  _kapitein_.\"    Van Slyck smiled cynically.    \"Humph, _mynheer_, you make me tired. From the way you talk one would  think these Yankees can fight as well as they can cheat the brown-skins.  We will fill him up with Hollands, we will swell his foolish head with  praise till it is ready to burst, and then we will engineer an uprising  in the hill district. Koyala can manage that for us. When Mynheer, the  Yankee, hears of it he will be that thirsty for glory there will be no  holding him. We will start him off with our blessings, and then we will  continue our business in peace. What do you think of the plan, my dear  Koyala?\"    \"Evidently you don't know Mynheer Gross,\" Koyala retorted coldly.    \"Do you?\" Van Slyck asked, quick as a flash.    \"I have seen him,\" Koyala acknowledged. \"Once. It was at the mouth of  the Abbas River.\" She described the incident.    \"He is no fool,\" she concluded. \"He is a strong man, and an able man,  one you will have to look out for.\"    \"And a devilish handsome young man, too, I'll wager,\" Van Slyck observed  maliciously with a sidelong glance at Muller. The _controlleur's_ ruddy  face darkened with a quick spasm of jealousy, at which the captain  chuckled.    \"Yes, a remarkably handsome man,\" Koyala replied coolly. \"We need  handsome men in Bulungan, don't we, captain? Handsome white men?\"    Van Slyck looked at her quickly. He felt a certain significance in her  question that eluded him. It was not the first time she had indulged in  such remarks, quite trivial on their face, but invested with a  mysterious something the way she said them. He knew her tragic history  and was sharp enough to guess that her unholy alliance with Ah Sing grew  out of a savage desire to revenge herself on a government which had  permitted her to be brought up a white woman and a victim of appetites  and desires she could never satisfy. What he did not know, did not even  dream, was the depth of her hate against the whole white race and her  fixed purpose to sweep the last white man out of Bulungan.    \"We do have a dearth of society here in Bulungan,\" he conceded. \"Do you  find it so, too?\"    The question was a direct stab, for not a white woman in the residency  would open her doors to Koyala. The Dyak blood leaped to her face; for a  moment it seemed that she would spring at him, then she controlled  herself with a powerful effort and replied in a voice studiedly  reserved:    \"I do, _mynheer kapitein_, but one must expect to have a limited circle  when there are so few that can be trusted.\"    At this juncture Muller's jealous fury overcame all bounds. Jealousy  accomplished what all Van Slyck's scorn and threats could not do, it  made him eager to put the newcomer out of the way.    \"What are we going to do?\" he thundered. \"Sit here like turtles on a  mud-bank while this Yankee lords it over us and ruins our business?  _Donder en bliksem_, I won't, whatever the rest of you may do.  _Kapitein_, get your wits to work; what is the best way to get rid of  this Yankee?\"    Van Slyck looked at him in surprise. Then his quick wit instantly  guessed the reason for the outburst.    \"Well, _mynheer_,\" he replied, shrugging his shoulders indifferently,  \"it seems to me that this is a matter you are more interested in than I.  Mynheer Gross does not come to displace me.\"    \"You are ready enough to scheme murders if there is a _gulden_ in it for  you, but you have no counsel for a friend, eh?\" Muller snarled. \"Let me  remind you, _kapitein_, that you are involved just as heavily as I.\"    Van Slyck laughed in cynical good humor.    \"Let it never be said that a Van Slyck is so base as that, _mynheer_.  Supposing we put our heads together. In the first place, let us give  Koyala a chance to tell what she knows. Where did you get the news,  Koyala?\"    \"That makes no difference, _mynheer kapitein_,\" Koyala rejoined coolly.  \"I have my own avenues of information.\"    Van Slyck frowned with annoyance.    \"When does he come here?\" he inquired.    \"We may expect him any time,\" Koyala stated. \"He is to come when the  rainy season closes, and that will be in a few days.\"    \"_Donder en bliksem_, does Ah Sing know this?\" Muller asked anxiously.    Van Slyck's lips curled in cynical amusement at the inanity of the  question.    \"He knows,\" Koyala declared.    \"Of course he knows,\" Van Slyck added sarcastically. \"The question is,  what is he going to do?\"    \"I do not know,\" Koyala replied. \"He can tell you that himself when he  comes here.\"    \"He's coming here?\" Van Slyck asked quickly.    \"Yes.\"    \"When?\"    \"I am not in Ah Sing's councils,\" Koyala declared coldly.    \"The deuce you're not,\" Van Slyck retorted irritably. \"You seem to know  a lot of things we hadn't heard of. What does Ah Sing expect us to do?  Pander to this Yankee deck-scrubber until he comes?\"    \"We will do what we think best,\" Muller observed grimly.    Koyala looked at him steadily until his glance fell.    \"You will both leave him alone and attend to your own affairs,\" she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3725"],[0,"Famous Men of the Middle Ages (#14)"],[1,"where  he had once been sole emperor.    West of the Rhine, where the Germans lived, the last descendant  of Charlemagne died when he was a mere boy. The German nobles were  not willing for any foreign prince to govern them, and yet they saw  that they must unite to defend their country against the invasions  of the barbarians called Magyars (_ma-jaerz'_). So they met and  elected Conrad, duke of Franconia, to be their king.    However, although he became king in name, Conrad never had much  power over his nobles. Some of them refused to recognize him as  king and his reign was disturbed by quarrels and wars. He died  in 919, and on his death-bed he said to his brother, \"Henry, Duke  of Saxony, is the ablest ruler in the empire. Elect him king, and  Germany will have peace.\"    A few months after Conrad's death, the nobles met at Aix-la-Chapelle  and elected Henry to be their king.    At this time it was the custom in Europe to hunt various birds,  such as the wild duck and partridge, with falcons. The falcons  were long-winged birds of prey, resembling hawks. They were trained  to perch on their master's wrist and wait patiently until they  were told to fly. Then they would swiftly dart at their prey and  bear it to the ground. Henry was very fond of falconry and hence  was known as Henry the Fowler, or Falconer.    As soon as the other dukes had elected him king a messenger was  sent to Saxony to inform him of the honor done him. After a search  of some days he was at last found, far up in the Hartz Mountains,  hunting with his falcons. Kneeling at his feet, the messenger said:    \"God save you, Henry of Saxony. I come to announce the death of  King Conrad and to tell you that the nobles have elected you to  succeed him as king of the Germans.\"    For a moment the duke was speechless with amazement. Then he exclaimed:    \"Elected me king? I cannot believe it. I am a Saxon, and King Conrad  was a Frank and a bitter enemy to me.\"    [Illustration: THE CROWN OF GERMANY IS OFFERED TO HENRY THE FOWLER]    \"It is true,\" replied the messenger. \"Conrad, when dying, advised  that the nobles should choose you as his successor.\"    Henry was silent for while and then he said, \"King Conrad was a  good man. I know it now; and I am sorry that I did not understand  him better when he was alive. I accept the position offered to me  and I pray that I may be guided by Heaven in ruling his people.\"    So Henry the Fowler left the chase to take up his duties as king  of the Germans.    II    In proper time Henry was proclaimed king of Germany; but he was  hardly seated on the throne when the country was invaded by thousands  of Magyars, from the land which we now know as Hungary.    As soon as possible Henry gathered an army and marched to meet  the barbarians. He came upon a small force under the command of  the son of the Magyar king. The Germans easily routed the Magyars  and took the king's son prisoner.    This proved to be a very fortunate thing, because it stopped the  war for a long term of years. When the Magyar king learned that his  son was a prisoner in the hands of King Henry he was overwhelmed  with grief. He mourned for his son day and night and at last sent  to the German camp a Magyar chief with a flag of truce, to beg  that the prince might be given up.    \"Our king says that he will give whatever you demand for the release  of his son,\" said the chief to the German monarch.    \"I will give up the prince on this condition only,\" was the reply,  \"the Magyars must leave the soil of Germany immediately and promise  not to war on us for nine years. During those years I will pay to  the king yearly five thousand pieces of gold.\"    \"I accept the terms in the king's name,\" responded the chief. The  prince was, therefore, given up and the Magyars withdrew.    During the nine years of truce King Henry paid great attention  to the organization of an army. Before this the German soldiers  had fought chiefly on foot, not, as the Magyars did, on horseback.  For this reason they were at a great disadvantage in battle. The  king now raised a strong force of horsemen and had them drilled  so thoroughly that they became almost invincible. The infantry  also were carefully drilled.    Besides this, Henry built a number of forts in different parts of  his kingdom and had all the fortified cities made stronger.    The following year the Magyar chief appeared at the German court  and demanded a tenth payment.    \"Not a piece of gold will be given you,\" replied King Henry. \"Our  truce is ended.\"    In less than a week a vast body of Magyars entered Germany to renew  the war. Henry held his army in waiting until lack of food compelled  the barbarians to divide their forces into two separate bodies.  One division was sent to one part of the country, the other to  another part.    Henry completely routed both divisions, and the power of the Magyars  in Germany was broken.    The Danes also invaded Henry's kingdom, but he defeated them and  drove them back.    Henry reigned for eighteen years; and when he died all Germany was  peaceful and prosperous. His son Otto succeeded him. He assumed  the title of \"Emperor,\" which Charlemagne had borne more than a  hundred years before.    From that time on, for nearly one thousand years, all the German  emperors claimed to be the successors of Charlemagne. They called  their domain \"the Holy Roman Empire,\" and took the title \"Emperor\"  or \"Emperor of the Romans,\" until the year 1806, when Francis II  resigned it.          CANUTE THE GREAT    KING FROM 1014-1035    I    The Danes, you remember, had the eastern and northern parts of  England in the time of Alfred. Alfred's successors drove them farther  and farther north, and at length the Danish kingdom in England  came to an end for a time.    But the Danes in Denmark did not forget that there had been such  a kingdom and in the year 1013 Sweyn (_swane_), King of Denmark,  invaded England and defeated the Anglo-Saxons. Ethelred, their  king, fled to Normandy.    Sweyn now called himself the king of England; but in a short time  he died and his son Canute succeeded to his throne. Canute was  nineteen years old. He had been his father's companion during the  war with the Anglo-Saxons, and thus had had a good deal of experience  as a soldier.    After the death of Sweyn some of the Anglo-Saxons recalled King  Ethelred and revolted against the Danes.    Canute, however, went to Denmark and there raised one of the largest  armies of Danes that had ever been assembled. With this powerful  force he sailed to England. When he landed Northumberland and Wessex  acknowledged him as king. Shortly after this Ethelred died.    Canute now thought he would find it easy to get possession of all  England. This was a mistake.    Ethelred left a son named Edmund Ironside who was a very brave  soldier. He became, by his father's death, the king of Saxon England  and at once raised an army to defend his kingdom. A battle was fought  and Edmund was victorious. This was the first of five battles that  were fought in one year. In none of them could the Danes do more  than gain a slight advantage now and then.    However, the Saxons were at last defeated in a sixth battle through  the act of a traitor. Edric, a Saxon noble, took his men out of  the fight and his treachery so weakened the Saxon army that Edmund  Ironside had to surrender to Canute.    But the young Dane had greatly admired Edmund for the way in which he  had fought against heavy odds, so he now treated him most generously.  Canute took certain portions of England and the remainder was given  to Edmund Ironside.    Thus for a short time the Anglo-Saxon people had at once a Danish  and a Saxon monarch.    [Illustration: DANES EMBARKING FOR THE INVASION OF ENGLAND]    II    Edmund died in 1016 and after his death Canute became sole ruler.    He ruled wisely. He determined to make his Anglo-Saxon subjects  forget that he was a foreign conqueror. To show his confidence  in them he sent back to Denmark the army he had brought over the  sea, keeping on a part of his fleet and a small body of soldiers  to act as guards at his palace.    He now depended on the support of his Anglo-Saxon subjects and he  won their love.    Although a king--and it is generally believed that kings like  flattery--Canute is said to have rebuked his courtiers when they  flattered him. On one occasion, when they were talking about his  achievements, one of them said to him:    \"Most noble king, I believe you can do anything.\"    Canute sternly rebuked the courtier for these words and then said:    \"Come with me, gentlemen.\"    He led them from the palace grounds to the sea-shore where the  tide was rising, and had his chair placed at the edge of the water.    \"You say I can do anything,\" he said to the courtiers. \"Very well,  I who am king and the lord of the ocean now command these rising  waters to go back and not dare wet my feet.\"    [Illustration: CANUTE REBUKES HIS COURTIERS]    But the tide was disobedient and steadily rose and rose, until  the feet of the king were in the water. Turning to his courtiers,  Canute said:    \"Learn how feeble is the power of earthly kings. None is worthy  the name of king but He whom heaven and earth and sea obey.\"    During Canute's reign England had peace and prosperity and the  English people have ever held his memory dear.          THE CID    Late one sunny afternoon one and twenty knights were riding along  the highway in the northern part of Spain. As they were passing  a deep mire they heard cries for help, and turning, saw a poor  leper who was sinking in the mud. One of the knights, a handsome  young man, was touched by the cries. He dismounted, rescued the  poor fellow, took him upon his own horse, and thus the two rode  to the inn. The other knights wondered at this.    When they reached the inn where they were to stop for the night,  they wondered still more, for their companion"]]]
