The selfishness of the riparian proprietor grows with every year.  If these men had their way they would close the river Thames altogether.  They actually do this along the minor tributary streams and in the  backwaters.  They drive posts into the bed of the stream, and draw chains  across from bank to bank, and nail huge notice-boards on every tree.  The  sight of those notice-boards rouses every evil instinct in my nature.  I  feel I want to tear each one down, and hammer it over the head of the man  who put it up, until I have killed him, and then I would bury him, and  put the board up over the grave as a tombstone.    I mentioned these feelings of mine to Harris, and he said he had them  worse than that.  He said he not only felt he wanted to kill the man who  caused the board to be put up, but that he should like to slaughter the  whole of his family and all his friends and relations, and then burn down  his house.  This seemed to me to be going too far, and I said so to  Harris; but he answered:    \"Not a bit of it.  Serve 'em all jolly well right, and I'd go and sing  comic songs on the ruins.\"    I was vexed to hear Harris go on in this blood-thirsty strain.  We never  ought to allow our instincts of justice to degenerate into mere  vindictiveness.  It was a long while before I could get Harris to take a  more Christian view of the subject, but I succeeded at last, and he  promised me that he would spare the friends and relations at all events,  and would not sing comic songs on the ruins.    You have never heard Harris sing a comic song, or you would understand  the service I had rendered to mankind.  It is one of Harris's fixed ideas  that he _can_ sing a comic song; the fixed idea, on the contrary, among  those of Harris's friends who have heard him try, is that he _can't_ and  never will be able to, and that he ought not to be allowed to try.    When Harris is at a party, and is asked to sing, he replies: \"Well, I can  only sing a _comic_ song, you know;\" and he says it in a tone that  implies that his singing of _that_, however, is a thing that you ought to  hear once, and then die.    \"Oh, that _is_ nice,\" says the hostess.  \"Do sing one, Mr. Harris;\" and  Harris gets up, and makes for the piano, with the beaming cheeriness of a  generous-minded man who is just about to give somebody something.    \"Now, silence, please, everybody\" says the hostess, turning round; \"Mr.  Harris is going to sing a comic song!\"    \"Oh, how jolly!\" they murmur; and they hurry in from the conservatory,  and come up from the stairs, and go and fetch each other from all over  the house, and crowd into the drawing-room, and sit round, all smirking  in anticipation.    Then Harris begins.    Well, you don't look for much of a voice in a comic song.  You don't  expect correct phrasing or vocalization.  You don't mind if a man does  find out, when in the middle of a note, that he is too high, and comes  down with a jerk.  You don't bother about time.  You don't mind a man  being two bars in front of the accompaniment, and easing up in the middle  of a line to argue it out with the pianist, and then starting the verse  afresh.  But you do expect the words.    You don't expect a man to never remember more than the first three lines  of the first verse, and to keep on repeating these until it is time to  begin the chorus.  You don't expect a man to break off in the middle of a  line, and snigger, and say, it's very funny, but he's blest if he can  think of the rest of it, and then try and make it up for himself, and,  afterwards, suddenly recollect it, when he has got to an entirely  different part of the song, and break off, without a word of warning, to  go back and let you have it then and there.  You don't--well, I will just  give you an idea of Harris's comic singing, and then you can judge of it  for yourself.    [Picture: Harris] HARRIS (_standing up in front of piano and addressing  the expectant mob_): \"I'm afraid it's a very old thing, you know.  I  expect you all know it, you know.  But it's the only thing I know.  It's  the Judge's song out of _Pinafore_--no, I don't mean _Pinafore_--I  mean--you know what I mean--the other thing, you know.  You must all join  in the chorus, you know.\"    [_Murmurs of delight and anxiety to join in the chorus_.  _Brilliant  performance of prelude to the Judge's song in_ \"_Trial by Jury_\" _by  nervous Pianist_.  _Moment arrives for Harris to join in_.  _Harris takes  no notice of it_.  _Nervous pianist commences prelude over again, and  Harris_, _commencing singing at the same time_, _dashes off the first two  lines of the First Lord's song out of_ \"_Pinafore_.\"  _Nervous pianist  tries to push on with prelude_, _gives it up_, _and tries to follow  Harris with accompaniment to Judge's song out of_ \"_Trial by Jury_,\" _finds  that doesn't answer_, _and tries to recollect what he is doing_, _and  where he is_, _feels his mind giving way_, _and stops short_.]    HARRIS (_with kindly encouragement_): \"It's all right.  You're doing it  very well, indeed--go on.\"    NERVOUS PIANIST: \"I'm afraid there's a mistake somewhere.  What are you  singing?\"    HARRIS (_promptly_): \"Why the Judge's song out of Trial by Jury.  Don't  you know it?\"    SOME FRIEND OF HARRIS'S (_from the back of the room_): \"No, you're not,  you chuckle-head, you're singing the Admiral's song from _Pinafore_.\"    [_Long argument between Harris and Harris's friend as to what Harris is  really singing_.  _Friend finally suggests that it doesn't matter what  Harris is singing so long as Harris gets on and sings it_, _and Harris_,  _with an evident sense of injustice rankling inside him_, _requests  pianist to begin again_.  _Pianist_, _thereupon_, _starts prelude to the  Admiral's song_, _and Harris_, _seizing what he considers to be a  favourable opening in the music_, _begins_.]    HARRIS:        \"'When I was young and called to the Bar.'\"    [_General roar of laughter_, _taken by Harris as a compliment_.  _Pianist_, _thinking of his wife and family_, _gives up the unequal  contest and retires_; _his place being taken by a stronger-nerved man_.

We won't bother about any prelude.\"    HARRIS (_upon whom the explanation of matters has slowly  dawned--laughing_): \"By Jove!  I beg your pardon.  Of course--I've been  mixing up the two songs.  It was Jenkins confused me, you know.  Now  then.    [_Singing_; _his voice appearing to come from the cellar_, _and  suggesting the first low warnings of an approaching earthquake_.        \"'When I was young I served a term      As office-boy to an attorney's firm.'

And I polished up  the floor--no, dash it--I beg your pardon--funny thing, I can't think of  that line.  And I--and I--Oh, well, we'll get on to the chorus, and  chance it (_sings_):        \"'And I diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-de,      Till now I am the ruler of the Queen's navee.'    Now then, chorus--it is the last two lines repeated, you know.    GENERAL CHORUS:        \"And he diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-dee'd,      Till now he is the ruler of the Queen's navee.\"    And Harris never sees what an ass he is making of himself, and how he is  annoying a lot of people who never did him any harm.  He honestly  imagines that he has given them a treat, and says he will sing another  comic song after supper.    Speaking of comic songs and parties, reminds me of a rather curious  incident at which I once assisted; which, as it throws much light upon  the inner mental working of human nature in general, ought, I think, to  be recorded in these pages.    We were a fashionable and highly cultured party.  We had on our best  clothes, and we talked pretty, and were very happy--all except two young  fellows, students, just returned from Germany, commonplace young men, who  seemed restless and uncomfortable, as if they found the proceedings slow.  The truth was, we were too clever for them.  Our brilliant but polished  conversation, and our high-class tastes, were beyond them.  They were out  of place, among us.  They never ought to have been there at all.  Everybody agreed upon that, later on.    We played _morceaux_ from the old German masters.  We discussed  philosophy and ethics.  We flirted with graceful dignity.  We were even  humorous--in a high-class way.    Somebody recited a French poem after supper, and we said it was  beautiful; and then a lady sang a sentimental ballad in Spanish, and it  made one or two of us weep--it was so pathetic.    And then those two young men got up, and asked us if we had ever heard  Herr Slossenn Boschen (who had just arrived, and was then down in the  supper-room) sing his great German comic song.    None of us had heard it, that we could remember.    The young men said it was the funniest song that had ever been written,  and that, if we liked, they would get Herr Slossenn Boschen, whom they  knew very well, to sing it.  They said it was so funny that, when Herr  Slossenn Boschen had sung it once before the German Emperor, he (the  German Emperor) had had to be carried off to bed.    They said nobody could sing it like Herr Slossenn Boschen; he was so  intensely serious all through it that you might fancy he was reciting a  tragedy, and that, of course, made it all the funnier.  They said he  never once suggested by his tone or manner that he was singing anything  funny--that would spoil it.  It was his air of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30802"],[0,"Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book the First (#14)"],[1,"rs, they bring it to pass that no man can  easily choose to transgress the law; since, by reason of the impending  correction, compliance is in a high degree preferable to disobedience.  And, even where rewards are proposed as well as punishments  threatened, the obligation of the law seems chiefly to consist in the  penalty: for rewards, in their nature, can only _persuade_ and  _allure_; nothing is _compulsory_ but punishment.    IT is held, it is true, and very justly, by the principal of our  ethical writers, that human laws are binding upon mens consciences.  But if that were the only, or most forcible obligation, the good only  would regard the laws, and the bad would set them at defiance. And,  true as this principle is, it must still be understood with some  restriction. It holds, I apprehend, as to _rights_; and that, when the  law has determined the field to belong to Titius, it is matter of  conscience no longer to withhold or to invade it. So also in regard to  _natural duties_, and such offences as are _mala in se_: here we are  bound in conscience, because we are bound by superior laws, before  those human laws were in being, to perform the one and abstain from  the other. But in relation to those laws which enjoin only _positive  duties_, and forbid only such things as are not _mala in se_ but _mala  prohibita_ merely, annexing a penalty to noncompliance, here I  apprehend conscience is no farther concerned, than by directing a  submission to the penalty, in case of our breach of those laws: for  otherwise the multitude of penal laws in a state would not only be  looked upon as an impolitic, but would also be a very wicked thing; if  every such law were a snare for the conscience of the subject. But in  these cases the alternative is offered to every man; \"either abstain  from this, or submit to such a penalty;\" and his conscience will be  clear, whichever side of the alternative he thinks proper to embrace.  Thus, by the statutes for preserving the game, a penalty is denounced  against every unqualified person that kills a hare. Now this  prohibitory law does not make the transgression a moral offence: the  only obligation in conscience is to submit to the penalty if levied.    I HAVE now gone through the definition laid down of a municipal law;  and have shewn that it is \"a rule--of civil conduct--prescribed--by  the supreme power in a state--commanding what is right, and  prohibiting what is wrong:\" in the explication of which I have  endeavoured to interweave a few useful principles, concerning the  nature of civil government, and the obligation of human laws. Before I  conclude this section, it may not be amiss to add a few observations  concerning the _interpretation_ of laws.    WHEN any doubt arose upon the construction of the Roman laws, the  usage was to state the case to the emperor in writing, and take his  opinion upon it. This was certainly a bad method of interpretation. To  interrogate the legislature to decide particular disputes, is not only  endless, but affords great room for partiality and oppression. The  answers of the emperor were called his rescripts, and these had in  succeeding cases the force of perpetual laws; though they ought to be  carefully distinguished, by every rational civilian, from those  general constitutions, which had only the nature of things for their  guide. The emperor Macrinus, as his historian Capitolinus informs us,  had once resolved to abolish these rescripts, and retain only the  general edicts; he could not bear that the hasty and crude answers of  such princes as Commodus and Caracalla should be reverenced as laws.  But Justinian thought otherwise[k], and he has preserved them all. In  like manner the canon laws, or decretal epistles of the popes, are all  of them rescripts in the strictest sense. Contrary to all true forms  of reasoning, they argue from particulars to generals.    [Footnote k: _Inst._ 1. 2. 6.]    THE fairest and most rational method to interpret the will of the  legislator, is by exploring his intentions at the time when the law  was made, by _signs_ the most natural and probable. And these signs  are either the words, the context, the subject matter, the effects and  consequence, or the spirit and reason of the law. Let us take a short  view of them all.    1. WORDS are generally to be understood in their usual and most known  signification; not so much regarding the propriety of grammar, as  their general and popular use. Thus the law mentioned by  Puffendorf[l], which forbad a layman to _lay hands_ on a priest, was  adjudged to extend to him, who had hurt a priest with a weapon. Again;  terms of art, or technical terms, must be taken according to the  acceptation of the learned in each art, trade, and science. So in the  act of settlement, where the crown of England is limited \"to the  princess Sophia, and the heirs of her body, being protestants,\" it  becomes necessary to call in the assistance of lawyers, to ascertain  the precise idea of the words \"_heirs of her body_;\" which in a legal  sense comprize only certain of her lineal descendants. Lastly, where  words are clearly _repugnant_ in two laws, the later law takes place  of the elder: _leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant_ is a  maxim of universal law, as well as of our own constitutions. And  accordingly it was laid down by a law of the twelve tables at Rome,  _quod populus postremum jussit, id jus ratum esto_.    [Footnote l: L. of N. and N. 5. 12. 3.]    2. IF words happen to be still dubious, we may establish their meaning  from the context; with which it may be of singular use to compare a  word, or a sentence, whenever they are ambiguous, equivocal, or  intricate. Thus the proeme, or preamble, is often called in to help  the construction of an act of parliament. Of the same nature and use  is the comparison of a law with other laws, that are made by the same  legislator, that have some affinity with the subject, or that  expressly relate to the same point. Thus, when the law of England  declares murder to be felony without benefit of clergy, we must resort  to the same law of England to learn what the benefit of clergy is:  and, when the common law censures simoniacal contracts, it affords  great light to the subject to consider what the canon law has adjudged  to be simony.    3. AS to the subject matter, words are always to be understood as  having a regard thereto; for that is always supposed to be in the eye  of the legislator, and all his expressions directed to that end. Thus,  when a law of our Edward III. forbids all ecclesiastical persons to  purchase _provisions_ at Rome, it might seem to prohibit the buying of  grain and other victual; but when we consider that the statute was  made to repress the usurpations of the papal see, and that the  nominations to vacant benefices by the pope were called _provisions_,  we shall see that the restraint is intended to be laid upon such  provisions only.    4. AS to the effects and consequence, the rule is, where words bear  either none, or a very absurd signification, if literally understood,  we must a little deviate from the received sense of them. Therefore  the Bolognian law, mentioned by Puffendorf[m], which enacted \"that  whoever drew blood in the streets should be punished with the utmost  severity,\" was held after long debate not to extend to the surgeon,  who opened the vein of a person that fell down in the street with a  fit.    [Footnote m: _l._ 5. _c._ 12. Sec. 8.]    5. BUT, lastly, the most universal and effectual way of discovering  the true meaning of a law, when the words are dubious, is by  considering the reason and spirit of it; or the cause which moved the  legislator to enact it. For when this reason ceases, the law itself  ought likewise to cease with it. An instance of this is given in a  case put by Cicero, or whoever was the author of the rhetorical  treatise inscribed to Herennius[n]. There was a law, that those who in  a storm forsook the ship should forfeit all property therein; and the  ship and lading should belong entirely to those who staid in it. In a  dangerous tempest all the mariners forsook the ship, except only one  sick passenger, who by reason of his disease was unable to get out and  escape. By chance the ship came safe to port. The sick man kept  possession and claimed the benefit of the law. Now here all the  learned agree, that the sick man is not within the reason of the law;  for the reason of making it was, to give encouragement to such as  should venture their lives to save the vessel: but this is a merit,  which he could never pretend to, who neither staid in the ship upon  that account, nor contributed any thing to it's preservation.    [Footnote n: _l._ 1. _c._ 11.]    FROM this method of interpreting laws, by the reason of them, arises  what we call _equity_; which is thus defined by Grotius[o], \"the  correction of that, wherein the law (by reason of its universality) is  deficient.\" For since in laws all cases cannot be foreseen or  expressed, it is necessary, that when the general decrees of the law  come to be applied to particular cases, there should be somewhere a  power vested of excepting those circumstances, which (had they been  foreseen) the legislator himself would have excepted. And these are  the cases, which, as Grotius expresses it, \"_lex non exacte definit,  sed arbitrio boni viri permittit_.\"    [Footnote o: _de aequitate._]    EQUITY thus depending, essentially, upon the particular circumstances  of each individual case, there can be no established rules and fixed  precepts of equity laid down, without destroying it's very essence,  and reducing it to a positive law. And, on the other hand, the liberty  of considering all cases in an equitable light must not be indulged  too far, lest thereby we destroy all law, and leave the decision of  every question entirely in the breast of the judge. And law, without  equity, tho' hard"]]]
