But we  were able to swoop gently back across Jersey, fortunately crossing the  ship lanes without sighting any more Han craft, and finally settling to  rest in the little glade beneath the trees, near Hart's camp.          CHAPTER XI    The New Boss      We had ultrophoned our arrival and the Big Boss himself, surrounded by  the Council, was on hand to welcome us and learn our news. In turn we  were informed that during the night a band of raiding Bad Bloods,  disguised under the insignia of the Altoonas, a gang some distance to  the west of us, had destroyed several of our camps before our people had  rallied and driven them off. Their purpose, evidently, had been to  embroil us with the Altoonas, but fortunately, one of our exchanges  recognized the Bad Blood leader, who had been slain.    The Big Boss had mobilized the full raiding force of the Gang, and was  on the point of heading an expedition for the extermination of the Bad  Bloods.    I looked around the grim circle of the sub-bosses, and realized the fate  of America, at this moment, lay in their hands. Their temper demanded  the immediate expenditure of our full effort in revenging ourselves for  this raid. But the strategic exigencies, to my mind, quite clearly  demanded the instant and absolute extermination of the Sinsings. It  might be only a matter of hours, for all we knew, before these degraded  people would barter clues to the American ultronic secrets to the Hans.    \"How large a force have we?\" I asked Hart.    \"Every man and maid who can be spared,\" he replied. \"That gives us seven  hundred married and unmarried men, and three hundred girls, more than  the entire Bad Blood Gang. Every one is equipped with belts,  ultrophones, rocket guns and swords, and all fighting mad.\"    I meditated how I might put the matter to these determined men, and was  vaguely conscious that they were awaiting my words.    Finally I began to speak. I do not remember to this day just what I  said. I talked calmly, with due regard for their passion, but with deep  conviction. I went over the information we had collected, point by  point, building my case logically, and painting a lurid picture of the  danger impending in that half-alliance between the Sinsings and the Hans  of Nu-yok. I became impassioned, culminating, I believe, with a vow to  proceed single-handed against the hereditary enemies of our race, \"if  the Wyomings were blindly set on placing a gang feud ahead of honor and  duty and the hopes of all America.\"    As I concluded, a great calm came over me, as of one detached. I had  felt much the same way during several crises in the First World War. I  gazed from face to face, striving to read their expressions, and in a  mood to make good my threat without any further heroics, if the decision  was against me.    But it was Hart who sensed the temper of the Council more quickly than I  did, and looked beyond it into the future.    He arose from the tree trunk on which he had been sitting.    \"That settles it,\" he said, looking around the ring. \"I have felt this  thing coming on for some time now. I'm sure the Council agrees with me  that there is among us a man more capable than I, to boss the Wyoming  Gang, despite his handicap of having had all too short a time in which  to familiarize himself with our modern ways and facilities. Whatever I  can do to support his effective leadership, at any cost, I pledge myself  to do.\"    As he concluded, he advanced to where I stood, and taking from his head  the green-crested helmet that constituted his badge of office, to my  surprise he placed it in my mechanically extended hand.    The roar of approval that went up from the Council members left me  dazed. Somebody ultrophoned the news to the rest of the Gang, and even  though the earflaps of my helmet were turned up, I could hear the cheers  with which my invisible followers greeted me, from near and distant  hillsides, camps and plants.    My first move was to make sure that the Phone Boss, in communicating  this news to the members of the Gang, had not re-broadcast my talk nor  mentioned my plan of shifting the attack from the Bad Bloods to the  Sinsings. I was relieved by his assurance that he had not, for it would  have wrecked the whole plan. Everything depended upon our ability to  surprise the Sinsings.    So I pledged the Council and my companions to secrecy, and allowed it to  be believed that we were about to take to the air and the trees against  the Bad Bloods.    That outfit must have been badly scared, the way they were \"burning\" the  ether with ultrophone alibis and propaganda for the benefit of the more  distant gangs. It was their old game, and the only method by which they  had avoided extermination long ago from their immediate neighbors--these  appeals to the spirit of American brotherhood, addressed to gangs too  far away to have had the sort of experience with them that had fallen to  our lot.    I chuckled. Here was another good reason for the shift in my plans. Were  we actually to undertake the exterminations of the Bad Bloods at once,  it would have been a hard job to convince some of the gangs that we had  not been precipitate and unjustified. Jealousies and prejudices existed.  There were gangs which would give the benefit of the doubt to the Bad  Bloods, rather than to ourselves, and the issue was now hopelessly  beclouded with the clever lies that were being broadcast in an unceasing  stream.    But the extermination of the Sinsings would be another thing. In the  first place, there would be no warning of our action until it was all  over, I hoped. In the second place, we would have indisputable proof, in  the form of their rep-ray ships and other paraphernalia, of their  traffic with the Hans; and the state of American prejudice, at the time  of which I write held trafficking with the Hans a far more heinous thing  than even a vicious gang feud.    I called an executive session of the Council at once. I wanted to  inventory our military resources.    I created a new office on the spot, that of \"Control Boss,\" and  appointed Ned Garlin to the post, turning over his former responsibility  as Plants Boss to his assistant. I needed someone, I felt, to tie in the  records of the various functional activities of the campaign, and take  over from me the task of keeping the records of them up to the minute.    I received reports from the bosses of the ultrophone unit, and those of  food, transportation, fighting gear, chemistry, electronic activity and  electrophone intelligence, ultroscopes, air patrol and contact guard.    My ideas for the campaign, of course, were somewhat tinged with my 20th  Century experience, and I found myself faced with the task of working  out a staff organization that was a composite of the best and most  easily applied principles of business and military efficiency, as I knew  them from the viewpoint of immediate practicality.    What I wanted was an organization that would be specialized,  functionally, not as that indicated above, but from the angles of:  intelligence as to the Sinsings' activities; intelligence as to Han  activities; perfection of communication with my own units; co-operation  of field command; and perfect mobilization of emergency supplies and  resources.    It took several hours of hard work with the Council to map out the plan.  First we assigned functional experts and equipment to each \"Division\" in  accordance with its needs. Then these in turn were reassigned by the new  Division Bosses to the Field Commands as needed, or as Independent or  Headquarters Units. The two intelligence divisions were named the White  and the Yellow, indicating that one specialized on the American enemy  and the other on the Mongolians.    The division in charge of our own communications, the assignment of  ultrophone frequencies and strengths, and the maintenance of operators  and equipment, I called \"Communications.\"    I named Bill Hearn to the post of Field Boss, in charge of the main or  undetached fighting units, and to the Resources Division, I assigned all  responsibility for what few aircraft we had; and all transportation and  supply problems, I assigned to \"Resources.\" The functional bosses stayed  with this division.    We finally completed our organization with the assignment of liaison  representatives among the various divisions as needed.    Thus I had a \"Headquarters Staff\" composed of the Division Bosses who  reported directly to Ned Garlin as Control Boss, or to Wilma as my  personal assistant. And each of the Division Bosses had a small staff of  his own.    In the final summing up of our personnel and resources, I found we had  roughly a thousand \"troops,\" of whom some three hundred and fifty were,  in what I called the Service Divisions, the rest being in Bill Hearn's  Field Division. This latter number, however, was cut down somewhat by  the assignment of numerous small units to detached service. Altogether,  the actual available fighting force, I figured, would number about five  hundred, by the time we actually went into action.    We had only six small swoopers, but I had an ingenious plan in my mind,  as the result of our little raid on Nu-yok, that would make this  sufficient, since the reserves of inertron blocks were larger than I  expected to find them. The Resources Division, by packing its supply  cases a bit tight, or by slipping in extra blocks of inertron, was able  to reduce each to a weight of a few ounces. These easily could be  floated and towed by the swoopers in any quantity. Hitched to ultron  lines, it would be a virtual impossibility for them to break loose.    The entire personnel, of course, was supplied with jumpers, and if each  man and girl was careful to adjust balances properly, the entire number  could also be towed along through the air, grasping wires of ultron,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3261"],[0,"News from Nowhere; Or, An Epoch of Rest (#14)"],[1,"and  happy feasting on the site of some of the worst of the old slums, the  traditional memory of which we have kept.  On that occasion the custom is  for the prettiest girls to sing some of the old revolutionary songs, and  those which were the groans of the discontent, once so hopeless, on the  very spots where those terrible crimes of class-murder were committed day  by day for so many years.  To a man like me, who have studied the past so  diligently, it is a curious and touching sight to see some beautiful  girl, daintily clad, and crowned with flowers from the neighbouring  meadows, standing amongst the happy people, on some mound where of old  time stood the wretched apology for a house, a den in which men and women  lived packed amongst the filth like pilchards in a cask; lived in such a  way that they could only have endured it, as I said just now, by being  degraded out of humanity--to hear the terrible words of threatening and  lamentation coming from her sweet and beautiful lips, and she unconscious  of their real meaning: to hear her, for instance, singing Hood's Song of  the Shirt, and to think that all the time she does not understand what it  is all about--a tragedy grown inconceivable to her and her listeners.  Think of that, if you can, and of how glorious life is grown!\"    \"Indeed,\" said I, \"it is difficult for me to think of it.\"    And I sat watching how his eyes glittered, and how the fresh life seemed  to glow in his face, and I wondered how at his age he should think of the  happiness of the world, or indeed anything but his coming dinner.    \"Tell me in detail,\" said I, \"what lies east of Bloomsbury now?\"    Said he: \"There are but few houses between this and the outer part of the  old city; but in the city we have a thickly-dwelling population.  Our  forefathers, in the first clearing of the slums, were not in a hurry to  pull down the houses in what was called at the end of the nineteenth  century the business quarter of the town, and what later got to be known  as the Swindling Kens.  You see, these houses, though they stood  hideously thick on the ground, were roomy and fairly solid in building,  and clean, because they were not used for living in, but as mere gambling  booths; so the poor people from the cleared slums took them for lodgings  and dwelt there, till the folk of those days had time to think of  something better for them; so the buildings were pulled down so gradually  that people got used to living thicker on the ground there than in most  places; therefore it remains the most populous part of London, or perhaps  of all these islands.  But it is very pleasant there, partly because of  the splendour of the architecture, which goes further than what you will  see elsewhere.  However, this crowding, if it may be called so, does not  go further than a street called Aldgate, a name which perhaps you may  have heard of.  Beyond that the houses are scattered wide about the  meadows there, which are very beautiful, especially when you get on to  the lovely river Lea (where old Isaak Walton used to fish, you know)  about the places called Stratford and Old Ford, names which of course you  will not have heard of, though the Romans were busy there once upon a  time.\"    Not heard of them! thought I to myself.  How strange! that I who had seen  the very last remnant of the pleasantness of the meadows by the Lea  destroyed, should have heard them spoken of with pleasantness come back  to them in full measure.    Hammond went on: \"When you get down to the Thames side you come on the  Docks, which are works of the nineteenth century, and are still in use,  although not so thronged as they once were, since we discourage  centralisation all we can, and we have long ago dropped the pretension to  be the market of the world.  About these Docks are a good few houses,  which, however, are not inhabited by many people permanently; I mean,  those who use them come and go a good deal, the place being too low and  marshy for pleasant dwelling.  Past the Docks eastward and landward it is  all flat pasture, once marsh, except for a few gardens, and there are  very few permanent dwellings there: scarcely anything but a few sheds,  and cots for the men who come to look after the great herds of cattle  pasturing there.  But however, what with the beasts and the men, and the  scattered red-tiled roofs and the big hayricks, it does not make a bad  holiday to get a quiet pony and ride about there on a sunny afternoon of  autumn, and look over the river and the craft passing up and down, and on  to Shooters' Hill and the Kentish uplands, and then turn round to the  wide green sea of the Essex marsh-land, with the great domed line of the  sky, and the sun shining down in one flood of peaceful light over the  long distance.  There is a place called Canning's Town, and further out,  Silvertown, where the pleasant meadows are at their pleasantest:  doubtless they were once slums, and wretched enough.\"    The names grated on my ear, but I could not explain why to him.  So I  said: \"And south of the river, what is it like?\"    He said: \"You would find it much the same as the land about Hammersmith.  North, again, the land runs up high, and there is an agreeable and well-  built town called Hampstead, which fitly ends London on that side.  It  looks down on the north-western end of the forest you passed through.\"    I smiled.  \"So much for what was once London,\" said I.  \"Now tell me  about the other towns of the country.\"    He said: \"As to the big murky places which were once, as we know, the  centres of manufacture, they have, like the brick and mortar desert of  London, disappeared; only, since they were centres of nothing but  'manufacture,' and served no purpose but that of the gambling market,  they have left less signs of their existence than London.  Of course, the  great change in the use of mechanical force made this an easy matter, and  some approach to their break-up as centres would probably have taken  place, even if we had not changed our habits so much: but they being such  as they were, no sacrifice would have seemed too great a price to pay for  getting rid of the 'manufacturing districts,' as they used to be called.  For the rest, whatever coal or mineral we need is brought to grass and  sent whither it is needed with as little as possible of dirt, confusion,  and the distressing of quiet people's lives.  One is tempted to believe  from what one has read of the condition of those districts in the  nineteenth century, that those who had them under their power worried,  befouled, and degraded men out of malice prepense: but it was not so;  like the mis-education of which we were talking just now, it came of  their dreadful poverty.  They were obliged to put up with everything, and  even pretend that they liked it; whereas we can now deal with things  reasonably, and refuse to be saddled with what we do not want.\"    I confess I was not sorry to cut short with a question his glorifications  of the age he lived in.  Said I: \"How about the smaller towns?  I suppose  you have swept those away entirely?\"    \"No, no,\" said he, \"it hasn't gone that way.  On the contrary, there has  been but little clearance, though much rebuilding, in the smaller towns.  Their suburbs, indeed, when they had any, have melted away into the  general country, and space and elbow-room has been got in their centres:  but there are the towns still with their streets and squares and market-  places; so that it is by means of these smaller towns that we of to-day  can get some kind of idea of what the towns of the older world were  like;--I mean to say at their best.\"    \"Take Oxford, for instance,\" said I.    \"Yes,\" said he, \"I suppose Oxford was beautiful even in the nineteenth  century.  At present it has the great interest of still preserving a  great mass of pre-commercial building, and is a very beautiful place, yet  there are many towns which have become scarcely less beautiful.\"    Said I: \"In passing, may I ask if it is still a place of learning?\"    \"Still?\" said he, smiling.  \"Well, it has reverted to some of its best  traditions; so you may imagine how far it is from its nineteenth-century  position.  It is real learning, knowledge cultivated for its own sake--the  Art of Knowledge, in short--which is followed there, not the Commercial  learning of the past.  Though perhaps you do not know that in the  nineteenth century Oxford and its less interesting sister Cambridge  became definitely commercial.  They (and especially Oxford) were the  breeding places of a peculiar class of parasites, who called themselves  cultivated people; they were indeed cynical enough, as the so-called  educated classes of the day generally were; but they affected an  exaggeration of cynicism in order that they might be thought knowing and  worldly-wise.  The rich middle classes (they had no relation with the  working classes) treated them with the kind of contemptuous toleration  with which a mediaeval baron treated his jester; though it must be said  that they were by no means so pleasant as the old jesters were, being, in  fact, _the_ bores of society.  They were laughed at, despised--and paid.  Which last was what they aimed at.\"    Dear me! thought I, how apt history is to reverse contemporary judgments.  Surely only the worst of them were as bad as that.  But I must admit that  they were mostly prigs, and that they _were_ commercial.  I said aloud,  though more to myself than to Hammond, \"Well, how could they be better  than the age that made them?\"    \"True,\" he said, \"but their pretensions were higher.\"    \"Were they?\" said I, smiling.    \"You drive me from corner to corner,\" said he, smiling in turn.  \"Let me  say at least that they were a poor sequence to the aspirations of Oxford  of 'the barbarous Middle Ages.'\"    \"Yes, that will do,\" said I.    \"Also,\" said Hammond, \"what I have been saying of them is true in the"]]]
