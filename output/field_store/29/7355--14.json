The wind had dropped too; and the silence  after the uproar was startling. It lasted but a few seconds; then the  wind again struck the ship with even greater force than before,  although, as she had not lost her way, the blow was less felt by those  below. In five minutes the captain came below with his oil-skin coat and  sou'-wester streaming with wet.    \"I have just looked down to tell you,\" he said cheerfully, \"that  everything is going on well. The first burst of these gales is always  the critical point, and we can congratulate ourselves that we have got  through it without losing a spar or sail--thanks to our having had  sufficient warning to get all snug, and to the gale striking us  gradually. I am afraid you won't have a very comfortable time of it for  the next day or two; but there is nothing to be at all uneasy about. The  gale is off the land, and we have sea-room enough for anything. Now we  have got rid of half our cargo the ship is in her very best trim, and  though we may get her decks washed a bit by and by, she will be none the  worse for that.\"    So saying he again went up on deck. For the next three days the gale  blew with fury. There were no regular meals taken below, for the vessel  rolled so tremendously that nothing would have remained on the plates  and dishes; and the passengers were forced to content themselves with  biscuit, with an occasional cup of coffee or basin of soup that the cook  managed to warm up for them. The ladies for the most part kept their  cabins, as did many of the male passengers, and the absence of regular  meals was the less felt as the majority were suffering from  sea-sickness. Wilfrid was occasionally ill, but managed to keep up, and  from time to time went on deck for a few minutes, while Marion spent  most of her time on a seat at the top of the companion, looking out on  the sea.    It was a magnificent sight. Tremendous waves were following the ship,  each as it approached lifting her stern high in the air and driving her  along at a speed that seemed terrific, then passing on and leaving her  to sink down into the valley behind it. The air was thick with flying  spray torn from the crest of the waves. At first it seemed as if each  sea that came up behind the vessel would break over her stern and drive  her head-foremost down; but as wave passed after wave without damage the  sense of anxiety passed off, and Marion was able to enjoy the grandeur  of the sea. Wilfrid, Mr. Atherton, and the Allens often came in to sit  with her, and to take shelter for a time from the fury of the wind. But  talking was almost impossible; the roar of the wind in the rigging, the  noise of the waves as they struck the ship, and the confused sound of  the battle of the elements being too great to allow a voice to be heard,  except when raised almost to shouting point.    But Marion had no inclination for talking. Snugly as Mr. Atherton had  wedged her in with pillows and cushions, it was as much as she could do  to retain her seat, as the vessel rolled till the lower yards almost  touched the water, and she was too absorbed in the wild grandeur of the  scene to want companionship.    \"The captain says the glass is beginning to rise,\" Mr. Atherton said as  he met her the fourth morning of the gale; \"and that he thinks the worst  is over.\"    \"I shall be glad for the sake of the others,\" Marion replied, \"for the  sea to go down. Father and mother are both quite worn out; for it is  almost impossible for them to sleep, as they might be thrown out of  their berths if they did not hold on. For myself, I am in no hurry for  the gale to be over, it is so magnificently grand. Don't you think so,  Mr. Atherton?\"    \"It is grand, lassie, no doubt,\" Mr. Atherton said; \"but I have rather a  weakness for dry clothes and comfortable meals--to say nothing of being  able to walk or sit perpendicularly, and not being obliged constantly to  hold on for bare life. This morning I feel that under happier  circumstances I could enjoy a steak, an Irish stew, and a couple of  eggs, but a biscuit and a cup of coffee are all I can hope for.\"    \"I believe you enjoy it as much as I do, Mr. Atherton,\" the girl said  indignantly; \"else why do you stay upon deck all the time in spite of  the wind and spray?\"    \"Well, you see, Miss Renshaw, you ladies have an objection to my smoking  my pipe below; and besides, what with the groans and moans from the  cabins, and the clatter of the swinging trays, and the noise of the  waves, and one thing and another, there is little to tempt me to stay  below. But really I shall be very glad when it is over. The ship has been  doing splendidly; and as the wind has blown from the same quarter the  whole time, the sea though very high is regular, and everything is going  on well. Still a gale is a gale, and you can never answer for the  vagaries of the wind. If it were to veer round to another quarter, for  instance, you would in a few hours get a broken sea here that would  astonish you, and would try all the qualities of the _Flying Scud_. Then  again we have been running south with tremendous speed for the last  three days, and if it were to go on for a few days longer we might find  ourselves down among the ice. Therefore, I say, the sooner the gale is  over the better I shall be pleased.\"    Towards evening there was a sensible abatement in the force of the wind,  and the following morning the gale had so far abated that the captain  prepared to haul his course for the west.    \"We have been running south at the rate of fully three hundred miles a  day,\" he said, \"and are now very far down. The moment this warm wind  drops and we get it from the south you will find that you will need  every wrap you have to keep you warm. If the gale had lasted I had made  up my mind to try to get her head to it, and to lie to. We are a great  deal too close to the region of ice to be pleasant.\"    The change in the course of the vessel was by no means appreciated by  the passengers, for the motion was very much rougher and more unpleasant  than that to which they had now become accustomed. However, by the  following morning the wind had died away to a moderate breeze, and the  sea had very sensibly abated. The topsails were shaken out of their  reefs; and although the motion was still violent most of the passengers  emerged from their cabins and came on deck to enjoy the sun, which was  now streaming brightly through the broken clouds. The captain was in  high glee; the ship had weathered the gale without the slightest damage.  Not a rope had parted, not a sail been blown away, and the result fully  justified the confidence he felt in his ship and her gear.    \"It is a comfort,\" he remarked, \"to sail under liberal owners. Now, my  people insist on having their ships as well found as possible, and if I  condemn spars, sails, ropes, or stays, they are replaced without a  question. And it is the cheapest policy in the long run. There is  nothing so costly as stinginess on board a ship. The giving way of a  stay may mean the loss of the mast and all its gear, and that may mean  the loss of a ship. The blowing away of a sail at a critical moment may  mean certain disaster; and yet there are many owners who grudge a fathom  of new rope or a bolt of canvas, and who will risk the safety of their  vessels for the petty economy of a few pounds.\"    The next day the wind had dropped entirely. The topgallant masts were  sent up with their yards and sails, and by dinner-time the _Flying Scud_  looked more like herself. As soon as the wind lulled all on board were  conscious of a sudden fall of temperature. Bundles of wraps were undone  and greatcoats and cloaks got out, and although the sun was still  shining brightly the poop of the _Flying Scud_ soon presented a wintry  appearance. There was no sitting about now. Even the ladies had  abandoned their usual work, and by the sharp walking up and down on deck  it was evident that even the warm wraps were insufficient in themselves,  and that brisk exercise was necessary to keep up the circulation.    \"Well, what do you think of this, Mrs. Renshaw?\" Mr. Atherton asked.    \"I like it,\" she said decidedly; \"but it is certainly a wonderfully  sudden change from summer to winter. My husband does not like it at all.  We never agreed on the subject of temperature. He liked what I call a  close study, while I enjoy a sharp walk well wrapped up on a winter's  day.\"    \"I agree with you,\" Mr. Atherton said. \"I can bear any amount of cold,  but heat completely knocks me up. But then, you see, the cold never has  a chance of penetrating to my bones.\"    \"Which course shall we take now, do you suppose? South of Cape Horn or  through the Straits?\"    \"It will depend upon the winds we meet with, I imagine,\" Mr. Atherton  replied. \"If the wind continues from the south, I should say the captain  would keep well south of the Horn; but if it heads us from the west at  all, we may have to go through the Straits, which, personally, I own  that I should prefer. It has gone round nearly a point since I came on  deck this morning. If it goes round a bit more we certainly shall not be  able to lay our course round the Horn, for I do not think we are far to  the south of it now.\"    By evening the wind had hauled farther to the west, and the ship's head  pointed more to the north than it had done in the morning. The  passengers enjoyed the change, for the temperature had risen rapidly,  and many of the warm wraps that had been got up were laid aside. At  twelve o'clock the captain had taken observations, and found that the  ship's position was nearly due south of the Falkland Isles.    \"We had a narrow squeak of it, Mr. Ryan,\" he said to the first-mate.  \"All the time we were running before that gale I had that group of  islands on my mind.\"    \"So had I, sir,\" the mate replied. \"I was praying all the time that the  wind would keep a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33662"],[0,"A Republic Without a President, and Other Stories (#14)"],[1," had now come to a standstill, and floated quietly above the  lake and the doomed city. The four wriggled uncomfortably in the  improvised seats. The ropes cut them. The sun beat upon them hotly. They  were exhausted and hungry and parched.    \"Can't we go down?\" suggested Swift. His brain reeled at the great depth  below him. The person who lost his hold and fell would die before he  reached the earth. The first stage in the Strasburg cathedral is two  hundred and fifty feet high, and it is a terrible sight to look over its  stone balustrade. No one forgets his sensation when he leans over the  top of the Eiffel tower, a thousand feet from the asphalt pavement  below. Judge what it was to those inexperienced travellers to be over  ten thousand feet high, clinging like weather-beaten flies to these  straining ropes!    \"No, I wouldn't descend yet in this calm for as many dollars as we are  feet high. We're safe enough here. Look up, man! Look up! Shut your  eyes. That's best!\"    But Mr. Ticks pugnaciously returned to his question. What was a little  matter of falling ten thousand feet or so? A fact startling and valuable  was at stake and at hand.    \"It was just a quarter of ten,\" answered Miss Magnet, in a low,  horror-stricken tone. \"I was writing. Suddenly a bitter vapor enveloped  everything. There was no wind, no sun, no clouds, only this dense,  strange atmosphere. It prostrated me. There were a number of boats near  me. These were all of the new patent. They were steel. I saw great balls  of fire dance from boat to boat. Then there came from the city a light  such as I never saw before. It flashed like an enormous meteor, like an  incandescent flame. It enveloped Russell. I was scorched even where I  was by the flash. I heard a hissing sound like water on melted iron. And  then--\"    \"And then?\" persisted Mr. Ticks in a kind of rapture.    \"And then I must have fainted away. When I came to there was no city,  only masses of blackness and--and--Oh, the boats! The people! They were  all gone! Not capsized--not drowning--but gone. There were no boats.  There were no people. There wasn't even a dead body to keep me company.  I, only I, was left, living and alone upon the hissing water.... When I  was able I rowed back. The shore looked horrible and ridged, as if  molten lead had been poured into it. When I came nearer an awful heat  and a deadly odor overcame me. I had barely strength to row back and  anchor again. Then the mist settled everywhere except where I was.\" The  girl stopped for a moment, breathless.    \"I couldn't see anything. It was hot, and then it was cold. I tried to  eat my luncheon. I tried to get some sleep. I called and called for  help. I couldn't tell night from day. I can't say whether it was four or  five days. I said five. I must have been faint a good deal. The worst  thing was being alone. I expected to die. I got pretty weak.... Then I  saw the balloon.\" The girl bowed the face which she could not hide, and  sobbed at her own dreadful story.    Swift was greatly moved. \"Miss Magnet,\" he said gently, putting her head  upon his shoulder. \"I think you had better rest. You are tired out. This  is different, you know. You needn't when you get safely down.\" The girl  gave him a grateful glance and obeyed him quietly.    \"How did she escape?\" soliloquized Mr. Ticks, loud enough to be  overheard.    \"Oh, I don't know--don't ask me--unless it was that I was in a wooden  boat. All the rest on the lake go by storage battery and are made of  steel. Mine is the only old-fashioned boat, but I was always afraid.  Everybody laughed at me, but I did what I do at home. I cut off the legs  of a chair and fixed them in glass tumblers. I always sit in my office  on glass tumblers. My bed rests on glass tumblers, too. It's a  non-conductor, you know. I used to get shocked every day. Everybody got  shocked in Russell, but they pretended not to mind it.\"    \"But, Miss Magnet, do you know what is the cause of Russell's fate? of  this deadly atmosphere beneath us?\"    \"N-no--unless--of course that can't be. I guess it's a visitation of  Providence--but I don't know for what.\" The girl stopped, awed at the  thoughts she had evoked.    \"A visitation of Providence!\" repeated Mr. Ticks, slowly. \"Yes, she is  right. The sin of presumptuousness was visited upon that unhappy place.\"    \"Do you mean to say\"--Swift started up. Somehow he had forgotten  Russell, its mysterious fate, his mission, everything but the girl. He  had awaked to his duty. \"Do you mean to say that the whole thing is due  to e--?\"    \"Hold on! Look below!\" interrupted the professor.    They clung to the ropes and glued their gaze upon the sight so far  beneath them. The storm had magically cleared away. The sunlight now  pierced the whole landscape for the first time since the disaster. The  lost city, in black, shapeless ruins, lay directly beneath them.    \"We will go down.\" The professor opened the safety-valve cautiously.  \"The devil has been chased away by the storm,\" he said emphatically.    Indeed, the baleful vapor had gone. As they swiftly descended strange  sights met their eyes. They could still see everything microscopically  for a radius of twenty miles around. Black specks were rushing up the  stricken railroad tracks, along the roads, hurrying to the city of doom.  Linemen began to extend the wires; trackmen began laying new tracks.  Fully fifty thousand impatient men were madly plunging these twenty  miles from different points of the circumference, converging toward  Russell. The dead line had become a mysterious thing of the past. The  danger to life was over, and it became an unprecedented race to see who  would get first upon the spot.    \"If this calm lasts, as I think it will, we will be on the ground two  hours ahead of the crowd.\"    Swift's eyes sparkled in reportorial ecstasy.    There was no time now nor inclination for words. In ten minutes the  _High Tariff_ was within a few hundred feet of the doomed city. Buzzards  followed its descent curiously.    \"My kingdom for a notebook!\" cried Swift, in anguish.    \"Take mine,\" said his companion, shyly, \"and my stylo, too.\"    Swift would have been more moved by this attention had he not been  absorbed in the sight at his feet.    \"Do you mean,\" he turned to Mr. Ticks, \"that this is all the effect of  e----?\"    \"Look sharp, now!\" interrupted Professor Ariel. \"Stand ready to be cut  down!\" The Professor had manipulated the safety-valve so skilfully that  in another minute they grazed the serrated ground. They were not hurt.  One wide sweep of the professor's knife, and the _High Tariff_ freed now  from all restraint, bounded away never to be seen again.    \"I am sorry, Professor Ariel,\" said Swift, immediately, \"that  circumstances compel me to postpone my part of the contract. But, as we  are responsible for your loss, I will guarantee that the _Planet_ will  make it all right.\"    The professor did not answer. Absorbed, he followed the _High Tariff_ in  its capricious departure with tender interest.    When the three turned and stared about them, they stood palsied by the  terrible sight before them: a sight never permitted to mortal view  before, and we pray that such be withheld from the gaze of our poor race  henceforth forever.    The wide-awake, the proud, the busy city of Russell had vanished.  Russell in its short and meteoric career had spent hundreds of thousands  of dollars on its tall, iron, fireproof blocks, its steel grain  elevators, its gilded capitol, its granite churches, its hundred  factories, its indestructible depots. Where were they? Where was the  \"busy hum of men\"? Not a girder, not a column, not a trace of the  complicated iron vertebrae of this metal city was left to mourn the  grandeur of its structures. Not a corpse, not even a bone remained to  tell the tale of the death agony.    Stricken as dumb as the lower brute creation, this one poor girl, the  sole survivor of thirty thousand hopeful citizens, bereft of home, of  friends, of employment, of hope, of everything in life but this hideous  memory, uttered a low cry and sank senseless. Swift laid her gently on  the parched, cracked ground; it was yet heated as if a conflagration had  passed over the place. Where but five days ago haughty, frowning, iron  blocks of stores, of hotels and exchanges stood, there were ragged  gullies and deep fissures and jagged ravines, shining in the sunlight  with a black, streaked crust. The sight was dreary and dead and deserted  as if our travellers had been suddenly dropped upon the surface of the  moon. The ground was riven as by some prehistoric upheaval. It looked as  if subterranean springs of molten steel lava had spurted from the ground  and had melted the unhappy city in their onward path and had carried it  down in liquid solution to the lake.    Mr. Statis Ticks picked up a piece of this plutonian slag and examined  it attentively.    \"I didn't know that brick would melt like this,\" he said. Then again:  \"Here is platinum fused with iron and another substance I do not know.\"  In a second or two he added:    \"I see no remains of glass. It must have evaporated.\" He then took a few  steps. \"It is lucky,\" he said meditatively; \"if we had been landed a few  more feet to the left we should have been broiled to death. A part of  this lava is still in a liquid state.\"          VII.      The three men looked each other in the eye. Swift forgot the girl. The  professor forgot the balloon. Mr. Statis Ticks had forgotten his wife  and seven children; but this was no unusual circumstance. The aeronaut,  having less awe to the cubic inch in his make-up than his companions,  was the first to speak.    \"What does this gol-darned thing mean, anyhow?\"    \"Hush!\" said Swift, recoiling.    But Mr. Statis Ticks bared his head before the extinct city.    \"It means,\" said the student, solemnly, \"the presumptuous impiety of man  and the vengeance of Almighty God! "]]]
