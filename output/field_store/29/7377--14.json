He also was celebrated in his day, and is  frequently recorded in the _Notizia Morelli_, for his small pictures,  adapted for private rooms, his portraits, and his miniatures. It was  sometimes doubted whether a certain work was from the hand of John of  Bruges, of Antonello da Messina, or of Jacometto da Venezia. (_See  Notizia Morelli_, p. 74.)]    [Footnote 18: The picture referred to by the P. Moschini, in his  _Narrazione dell'Isola di Murano_, is not to be admitted as genuine, the  inscription upon it being forged by the same author, who counterfeited  that of Giovanni Vivarini, before alluded to in the note to page 22.]    [Footnote 19: See _Morelli Notizia_, p. 157.]    [Footnote 20: I had supposed, in my first edition of this work, misled  by the opposite names, that Sebeto was a different personage from this  Stefano da Zevio. I was afterwards undeceived by the appearance of the  work of the learned Brandolese, pronouncing them one and the same  artist; and I willingly here retract what I had before advanced,  expressing, at the same time, my acknowledgements for the emendation.]    [Footnote 21: _Drawn in the most perfect manner_, are the words of  Vasari, while he adds, that the whole of his works were imitated and  copied by Pietro di Perugia, an experienced artist in _fresco_, and more  especially in miniature, with which \"he ornamented the whole of the  books in the library of Pope Pius,\" in the dome at Siena. He is not  known, however, in Perugia, nor mentioned at Siena among those employed  at the cathedral, as is noticed by Father della Valle; yet the present  work abounds with examples of artists, unknown in their own cities, on  account of having resided elsewhere; and the before mentioned annotator  of Vasari was unable to discover the name of Liberal da Verona, an  undoubted illustrator of the books, in such registers. I think we ought  not to refuse to give credit, therefore, to Vasari, as Father Guglielmo  insists; but to admit a new Pietro di Perugia, anterior to Vanucci, who  might design the frescos of Stefano in Verona and Mantua, so extolled in  the early part of 1400, and who copied them in those very beautiful and  graceful miniatures at Siena; an art which he probably acquired at  Verona, where it was then in such high repute.]    [Footnote 22: See on this head, the _Descrizione delle Bellezze di  Vicenza_, P. 1. p. 7.]    [Footnote 23: In the cathedral of Pordenone, under one of his  altarpieces, we read--      \"Andreas Zeusis nostraeque aetatis Apelles    Hoc Bellunellus nobile pinxit opus.\" (_Altan._)]    [Footnote 24: Ruggieri indeed had acquired a great reputation in Italy  as early as 1449, when Ciriaco Anconitano, being in Ferrara, saw a  picture of Christ taken from the cross, belonging to the Duke. He thus  writes respecting the artist: _Rugerus Brugiensis pictorum decus_  AGATHEI TUCHEI.--_Rugierius in Brussella post praeclarum illum Brugiensem  picturae decus Joannem, insignis N. T. Pictor habetur_, &c. See Colucci  A. P. vol. xxiii. p. 143. He is also commended in high terms by  Bartolommeo Facio in his little work _De viris illustribus_. See  Morelli, _Notizia_, p. 239.]    [Footnote 25: He arrived there, and was at Rome in the _anno Santo_. See  Facius, lib. cit. p. 45.]    [Footnote 26: This is one of the usual mistakes found in Vasari.  Baldinucci (tom. iv. p. 17) calls him Ans or Hans. This is his Flemish  appellation, which in our tongue, signifies Giovanni; and in the  _Notizia_ Morelli he is termed Gianes da Brugia; somewhat nearer our own  tongue. With Sansovino he is Gio. di Bruggia, John of Bruges. See  Morelli, p. 117; and by him he is distinguished from _Gio. Van Eych_.]    [Footnote 27: In a similar taste was the perspective introduced by  Giovanni Bellino in his celebrated altarpiece at San Zaccaria, in  Venice. Another was placed in the great altar of the dome at Capo  d'Istria, by Carpaccio the elder, still more striking. In the background  of the picture, the virgin appears seated on a magnificent throne, with  the divine infant, in an upright posture, upon her knees, surrounded by  six of the most venerable patrons of the place, disposed around her, in  three ranks, displaying a fine diversity of drapery as well as of  action. To these are added some cherubs, engaged in playing upon musical  instruments, and apparently beholding the spectator with an air of  puerile simplicity, as if inviting him to caress them. A long and lofty  colonnade, in excellent perspective, leads the way to the throne, at one  time united to a fine stone colonnade, which extended from the  altarpiece through the chapel, producing a fine illusion, amounting to a  sort of enchantment of perspective. It was removed along with the stone  columns, in order to enlarge the tribune. The oldest citizens, who  witnessed this beautiful spectacle, speak of it to strangers with  delight, and I am glad to put it on record, before the recollection of  it be entirely obliterated.]    [Footnote 28: _Notizia_, p. 63.]    [Footnote 29: Albert Durer, arriving the same year at Venice, bestowed  on Giovanni one of the most favourable testimonies to his talents that  now remains. After rebuking the envy of the other painters, who spoke of  him with contempt, he says of him:--\"Every one assures me that he is  _Gran Galantuomo_, for which reason I wish him well. He is already very  old, but, notwithstanding, the best painter we have.\" V. _Morel. Not._  p. 224.]    [Footnote 30: The country is impressed with this persuasion in spite of  his own signatures, attached even to the pictures in Istria. In that,  cited at page 48, it is written _Victor Charpatius Venetus pinxit,  1516_; in another, at San Francesco di Pirano, _Victoris Charpatii  Veneti opus, 1519_. Benedetto Carpaccio, probably a son or nephew of the  preceding, was also a Venetian, of whom there remains a picture of the  Coronation of the Virgin, at Capo d'Istria, in the Rotunda, subscribed,  _Benetto Carpathio Veneto pingeva, 1537_. At the Osservanti, is the  picture of the _Nome di Gesu_, with the same words, but dated 1541. He  is not mentioned in Venetian history, though highly deserving a place in  it; for whatever traces he retains of the ancient stiffness of manner,  in the extremity of his figures, yet he yields not to many in softness  of tints; in the taste of his colours; expression of features, and the  effect of his chiaroscuro. I am led to think, that from residing out of  the capital, this artist was supposed to be a native of Istria, but he  was indisputably of a Venetian family, most probably tracing its origin  from Murano.]    [Footnote 31: We find traces of his paintings from the year 1507. See  Tassi, in his _Lives of the Painters, &c._ p. 56, where he corrects a  mistake of Zanetti, who, instead of one painter, had divided him into  two. One of his pictures, in the parish church of Endine, will remove  every doubt. There he signed himself, _Franciscus Rizus Bergomensis  habitator Venetiis, 1529_. In another piece, in the parochial church of  Serina, he wrote _Francesco Rizo da Santa Croxe depense, 1518_. His last  work, of which I find any account, is also in the parochial church of  Chirignano, in the Mestrina, dated 1541. Father Federici, who describes  it, makes Francesco the son of Girolamo da S. Croce, or S. Croce, whose  name we find subscribed in both ways, but not ever Rizo. I cannot agree  with him, first, because Ridolfi says only, (p. 62,) that they were of  _the same family_; second, because the pictures of Girolamo, according  to Tassi, commence later, and are traced also later than those of  Francesco, that is in 1549; and thirdly, because the style of Girolamo  is incomparably more modernized, as we shall presently shew.]    [Footnote 32: Morelli _Notizia_, p. 212.]    [Footnote 33: In the _Statuti de' Pittori_, it is written Mireti; and  the same work contains memoirs of him in 1423 and 1441; years, however,  which do not accord with his dependence on the Bellini. This Girolamo  might possibly have been the brother, or other relation, of that Gio.  Miretto, for whom see p. 13. These two names will do away with the  _Moreto_ of Vasari, and we must substitute Mireto or Miretto.]    [Footnote 34: I repeat the epigram, which is subscribed in ancient  characters, on the strength of which we may believe that the work was  esteemed one of the most valuable the art had produced up to that  period, transcribed by the very frequently commended Sig. Co. Cav.  Lazara; it is thus:      Non hic Parrhasio, non hic tribuendus Apelli,      Hos licet Auctores dignus habere labor.    Euganeus, vixdum impleto ter mense, Jacobus      Ex Montagnana nobile pinxit opus.]    [Footnote 35: He is thus named in the \"Statuti de' Pittori,\" of Padua,  and in the _MS. Zen._ whence we may correct Ridolfi, who calls him  Girolamo.]    [Footnote 36: In vol. iii. ed. Rom. p. 427, it is written by mistake  Mantegna, where it says that he, Speranza, and Veruzio, studied design  under Mantegna.]    [Footnote 37: Padre Faccioli, in his third volume of the _Inscrizioni  della Citta e territorio di Vicenza_, records the following epigraph,  _Jo. Sperantiae de Vangeribus me pinxit_, in which Vangeribus may,  perhaps, apply to some small village in the territory of Vicenza. He is  wholly silent respecting Veruzio, thus confirming the suspicion that his  name is a mere mistake of Vasari, whom it is hoped our posterity will  still continue to correct, and yet leave sufficient employment for their  children. The following is my conjecture. P. Faccioli gives an account  of a picture that remains in S. Francesco di Schio; it is composed in  the manner usually adopted in the composition of the marriage "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3470"],[0,"Such Is Life (#14)"],[1," good as they make them in Wagga, and quite new.  During the previous afternoon, I had marked something incongruous  in Bum's ownership of such a piece of furniture.  But being always,  I trust, superior to anything like surprise, I saddled and mounted Bunyip,  took Cleopatra by the rein, and joined the Ishmaelites, who,  on their bare-backed horses, were hurrying contingents of cattle  from different directions toward the gap of the fence,  whilst the fascination of overhanging danger bore so heavily  on their personal and professional dignity that every eye kept  an anxious look-out toward the ram-paddock.  In a few minutes more,  we were all outside the fence; and the drivers immediately began yoking.  I hooked Cleopatra's rein on a wool-lever, and, still riding Bunyip,  kept Thompson's and Cooper's bullocks together.  Mosey's dog was performing  the same office for him and Price.  Willoughby had n't returned  with the muster; and Bum was still absent.    \"Did you count my (bullocks)?\" demanded Dixon, limping slowly  and painfully toward his big roan horse.    \"O you sweet speciment!\" retorted Mosey, as he picked up his second yoke.  \"Why the (compound expletive) don't you rouse roun'?\"    \"How the (same expression) ken I rouse roun'?  I got the screwmatics  in my (adj.) hip.\"    \"Somethin' like you--Stan' over, Rodney, or I'll twist the tail off o' you--  You don't ketch me havin' nothin' wrong o' me when things is\"----    \"No, begad! no you don't!--take that!--ah! would you indeed!--on you go,  dem you! s-s-s-s-s! get up there!\" It was Willoughby's voice  among the salt-bush; and, the next moment, half-a-dozen beasts  leaped the wires and darted, capering and shying, past the wagons.  \"Quod petis hic est!\" panted their pursuer triumphantly.  \"The mouse may help the lion, remember, according to the old\"----    Then such a cataract of obscenity and invective from Price and Mosey,  while Cooper remarked gravely:    \"Them ain't our bullocks, Willerby; them's station cattle--  shoved in that paddick for something partic'lar.  Now they're off to (sheol);  an' it's three good hours' work with a horse an' stockwhip, to git'em in here  agen.  An' that kangaroo dog ain't makin' matters much better.  Lord stan' by us now! for we'll git (adv.) near hung if we're caught.\"    And, to be sure, there was Pup looping himself along the plain in hot pursuit.  It was no use attempting to call him off, for Nature has not endowed  the kangaroo dog with sufficient instinct to bring him in touch  with his master, except when the latter offers him food.  But there is always some penalty attached to the possession of anything  really valuable.  So, though I wasn't interested in the cattle,  I was bound to follow them till I recovered my dog.  Thompson's unpretentious  stockwhip was in my hand at the time; and, judging it unlikely  that Cleopatra had been broken in to the use of that disquieting implement,  I was just turning Bunyip round, when Willoughby stepped forward----    \"Permit me to redeem my unfortunate mistake by assisting you!\"  he exclaimed.  \"I have ridden to hounds in England.  May I take this horse?  Thanks.  Pray remember that I shall be under your orders, Collins.\"    \"Take care might he buck-lep,\" I remarked casually, as the whaler gathered  Cleopatra's reins, and threw himself into the deep seat of the new saddle.    And, to my genuine astonishment, he did buck-lep.  But he took  no mean advantage of his rider; he allowed him time to find the off stirrup,  and then led off with a forward spring about five feet high.  Willoughby--small blame to him--was jerked clean out of the saddle,  and lit fair across the horse's loins; in the impulse of self-preservation  grasping the cantle with both hands.  The small thigh-pads  afforded a good rough hold, and the next buck jammed the poor fellow  well under the seat of the saddle.  The position was neither pleasant  nor dignified, though certainly more secure for an amateur  than the conventional style; particularly after the horse's tremendous plunges  had raised the back of the saddle a foot or more by dint of fair wedging.    Price, Mosey, Thompson, and Cooper forgot the dangers of the time,  and discontinued their work, drawing near the spot with a carefully preserved  air of indifference and pre-occupation.  Even Dixon ignored his screwmatics,  and composed his demeanour to something like apathy.    Owing to the leverage of the saddle, the girth was gripping Cleopatra  in a ticklish place, and the bow of the saddle was dipping  into another ticklish place, whilst Willoughby's swinging feet  provided for the ticklish places on the horse's thighs and flanks.  Cleopatra mistook all this for deliberate provocation, and responded  to the very best of his splendid ability.  Early in the entertainment,  Willoughby's hat was bucked off his head; presently the wellington boot  was bucked off one foot, and the blucher off the other,  the prince-alberts following in due course.  Then the portion of attire  known to one section of society as 'linen', and to another as the 'beef-bag',  was bucked out of that necessary garment which we shrink from naming.  The ground was cut up as if rooted by pigs; yet Cleopatra was only just warming  to his work; and the whaler was still clinging to the saddle  like a native bear to a branch.    \"God help thee, Jack,\" I remarked listlessly; \"thou hast  a bitter breakfast on't.\"    \"He'll tire the horse out yet,\" said Thompson, with an artificial yawn.  \"Good lad, Willoughby! stick to him a bit longer.\"    \"Got no holt,\" observed Dixon.  \"Gone goose, any time.\"    \"He don't want no pipeclay, anyhow,\" said Mosey, with childish levity.  \"Dark-complexion people ought to steer clear o' playful horses.\"    All eyes were turned on the young fellow's face in surprise and reprehension;  and he uneasily attempted to carry off his inadvertent solecism  with a sort of swagger.    \"The horse can't hold out much longer at that rate,\" repeated Thompson,  stooping to lace his boots.    \"Can't he?\" drawled Cooper, poking out the stem of his pipe  with a stalk of grass.  \"He can hold out till something gives way.  That's what he's in the habit o' doin', I'm thinkin'; an' he ain't goin'  to break his rule this time.\"    \"The Far-downer got at you that trip, Collins,\" remarked Mosey,  seeking to retrieve his dignity by turning his back on the performance.  \"He seen you comin'.  Say, ole son--how'd you like to swap back?\"    \"I kep' misdoubtin' that hoss all the (adj.) time,\" observed Nestor wisely.  \"I felt sort o' jubious, on'y I did n't wanter say nothink.\"    \"There goes the pore (fellow) at last; I knowed the horse would do it,\"  said Cooper, as the stern captive spum'd his weary load,  and asked the image back that heaven bestowed.    \"Collar the horse quick!\" suggested Dixon.  \"Nail him now,  or you'll never ketch him.\"    \"No great hurry,\" I muttered, dismounting.  \"However, I think I'd better  have it out with him while he's warm.  Or perhaps one of you fellows  would like a try, while I do his yoking--just for a change?\"    Cleopatra, now nibbling the scanty grass, glanced from time to time  with grave sympathy at his late rider, who was occupying himself  with his toilet.    \"Ketch the (horse) quick!\" reiterated Dixon.    \"I would n't mind if I had my mare back again,\" I remarked,  as I approached Cleopatra's head.  \"By Jacob's staff I swear I have no mind  of trying conclusions with this fellow for a dull, sickening\"----    The adjectives were shorn of their noun, for Cleopatra,  accurately gauging his distance, suddenly sprung round and lashed out  with both hind feet.  You could have struck a match on the smoothest part  of my earthly tabernacle as I dodged him by about half an inch.  Then he went on cropping the grass as before, while I looked round  and inquired with sickly bravado, \"What noble Lucumo comes next,  to taste our Roman cheer?\"    But the bullock drivers silently repudiated the grim invitation,  and hurried back to their work, which they now pursued with redoubled vigour  and anxiety.  I remounted Bunyip, and caught Cleopatra from his back.  Then dismounting, I arranged the new saddle with ostentatious offhandedness,  though in a prayerful frame of mind, and presently climbed on  as if nothing was the matter.  I certainly anticipated Westminster Abbey  rather than a peerage; but the horse, with a nonchalance greater than my own,  inasmuch as it was genuine, turned quietly round as I pressed the rein  against his neck, and sailed away across the plain at his own  inimitable canter.  Then I looked back to see the bullock drivers  disgustedly resume the work they had again suspended.    By this time the cattle had crossed a cane-grass swamp, and were out of sight;  but before I had gone a quarter of a mile I saw Pup coming to meet me,  limping and crestfallen.  He had probably been kicked by one of the absconders;  and as he could see no sign of civilisation except our camp,  his sagacity had drawn him back.  Well pleased, therefore,  I returned to the wagons after a few minutes absence.    \"The cattle are out of sight, Steve,\" said I, as I rounded up  the scattering bullocks.  \"Not worth while to go after them now.\"    \"Let them go, by all means,\" replied Thompson, with a ghastly simulation  of cheerfulness.  \"We'll gladly stand the loss of them, and make the station  a present of Bum's mare besides, if we once get out of sight  of this infernal camp--Stand up, Magpie--Just let us yoke up  as quickly as if our lives depended on it--which, to tell the truth,  is not much of an exag----  Hello! where's Damper?\"    \"Stuck in a gluepot, jist in front o' the (adj.) hut,\" replied Mosey,  without pausing in his work.  \"I seen him there--Back, Snailey,  or I'll knock the (adj.) horn off o' you--but I thought it was one  o' them station cattle till you minded me.  Why the (sheol) didn't you  count yer lot properly?\"    A deep oath broke from the"]]]
