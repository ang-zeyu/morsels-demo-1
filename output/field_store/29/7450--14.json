In one of these cases, the  female, of _P. maniculatus_, also died; the female of _P. truei_ was the  same one that adopted the surviving _P. maniculatus_. The female _truei_  continued to nurse her one remaining young for at least several days  after killing three of his litter mates. A reason for this cannibalism  might have been that I had fed these mice for several weeks on a mixture  of grains low in protein content. Inadequacy of this diet for nursing  females may have caused them to become cannibalistic. The feed of all  captives was changed to Purina Laboratory Chow after the young were  killed.      Transportation of Young    Females of both species transported their young either by dragging them  collectively while the young were attached to mammae, or by carrying  them one at a time in the mouth. Since mice of the subgenus _Peromyscus_  have three pairs of nipples, they probably transport only six young  collectively. Svihla (1932:13) has stated that both pectoral and  inguinal teats are used in transporting young, in contrast to Seton's  reputed assertion that only inguinal nipples were used. But Svihla  neglected to cite Seton's complete statement. Seton (1920:137) recorded  a litter of three as using only the inguinal mammae, but on the  following page recorded the use of both inguinal and pectoral mammae by  another litter of four. My findings agree with those of Svihla. Nursing  females of both species were removed periodically from cages by lifting  them by the tail. The young would hang onto the mammae and the female  would clutch the young to her with all four feet. Young two weeks old or  older crawled behind the mother while nursing.    The method of transporting young in the mouth has been mentioned by  Seton (1920:136) and described by Lang (1925) and Hall (1928:256). These  authors report that the mother picks the young up in her paws, and  places it ventral-side up in her mouth, with her incisors around it. The  young are not picked up by the skin on the nape of the neck, as are the  juveniles of dogs and cats. I have found that females of both species of  _Peromyscus_ carry their young ventral-side up in their mouth while the  young are small, and sometimes when the young are older. Generally, when  females of _P. truei_ moved young weighing more than 10 grams, the  female grasped the young from the dorsal side, across the thorax just  posterior to the shoulders, and held them with the incisors more or less  around the animal. Perhaps this method was used with older young because  of the observed tendency of the larger young to resist being turned over  and grasped from the ventral side, and because their increased weight  would have made it difficult, if not impossible, for the mother to pick  them up with her paws. The young rarely resisted the efforts of the  mother to move them by this method; when grasped across the thorax by  the mother, the young would remain limp until released. Some females of  _P. truei_ would drag almost fully grown young back into the nest in  this manner. I have not observed older young of a comparable age to be  moved by females of _P. maniculatus_. The females of _P. maniculatus_  appear to be somewhat less concerned than those of _P. truei_ for the  welfare of their young once they are mobile and close to being weaned.    The following listing describes changes in postnatal development of  young, of each species, from birth to nine weeks of age.             _P. maniculatus_                    _P. truei_    ----------------------------------+-------------------------------------    FIRST WEEK: At birth, young are   | At birth, young are helpless, red    helpless, red overall, small      | overall, smaller than _P. truei_,    with wrinkled skin.

Mr. Wickham recognised them to be the same party who had  visited the Hope on her last cruize; the thief, however, was not amongst  them, fearing probably he might be known.    [Illustration: PORT FAMINE    (Looking Northwards).]    [Illustration: PORT FAMINE    (Looking Southwards).]    [Illustration: P. P. King S. Bull    CURIOUS PEAK, ADMIRALTY SOUND.    Published by Henry Colburn, Great Marlborough Street, 1838]    {53} These natives conducted themselves very quietly, and, except one of  the women, who wished to keep a tin-pot in which some water had been given  her, made no attempt to pilfer. One of the party, who seemed more than half  an idiot, spit in my face; but as it was not apparently done angrily, and  he was reproved by his companions, his uncourteous conduct was forgiven.    If possessed of any furs, they had left them, perhaps concealed, near their  wigwams: only a few arrows, a necklace of shells, and a fillet for the  head, made of ostrich feathers, were obtained by barter. Their canoes were  paddled by the women, occasionally helped by the men. One or two of the  former were young, and well-featured, but the rest were hideous; and all  were filthy and most disagreeable, from the quantity of seal-oil and  blubber, with which they had covered their bodies. After we had obtained,  by barter, all the articles they had to dispose of, I presented them with  red caps and medals, of which they were very proud: the latter they  requested might have a hole drilled through them, that they might be  suspended by a string round their necks. Their astonishment was much  excited, and they were pleased by hearing a watch tick; but I believe I had  very nearly, though unintentionally; given great offence, by cutting off a  lock of hair, from the head of one of the men. Assuming a grave look, he  very carefully wrapped the hair up, and handed it to a woman in the canoe,  who, as carefully, stowed it away in a basket, in which she kept her beads  and paint: the man then turned round, requesting me, very seriously, to put  away the scissors, and my compliance restored him to good-humour.    The features of these people bore a great resemblance to those of the  Patagonian Indians, but in person they were considerably shorter and  smaller. The elderly people of both sexes had hideous figures; the  children, however, and young men, were well-formed; particularly one of the  boys, whom they called 'Y[=a]l-l[)a]-b[)a],' which, I believe, meant a  youth, or a young warrior. The word 'Sh[=e]rr[=o]o' was used to denote a  canoe, or vessel.    They were ill-clothed, with mantles made of guanaco, or otter skins, but  not so neatly as those of the Patagonians. {54} Their bodies were smeared  over with a mixture of earth, charcoal, or red-ocre, and seal-oil; which,  combined with the filth of their persons, produced a most offensive smell.  Some were partially painted with a white argillaceous earth; others were  blackened with charcoal; one of the men was daubed all over with a white  pigment. Their hair was bound by a fillet of plaited twine, made perhaps  with strips of bark, and a few of them had it turned up; but to none did it  appear to be an object of attention, except one of the young women, who  repeatedly combed and arranged her's with the well-toothed jaw of a  porpoise.    During a remarkably calm night, we were frequently startled by the loud  blowing of whales, between us and the shore. We had noticed several of  those monsters on the previous day, but had never heard them blow in so  still a place.    At dawn, a light air carried us towards some broken land to the S.E. of  Cape Rowlett, between the eastern trend of which, and the projecting point  of an island, we found a secure and land-locked harbour, with two  entrances, one to the north and the other to the south of High Islet. The  south side of the port, which I called Port Cooke,[49] is a narrow strip of  land, forming the head of a deep inlet or sound, called[50] Brook Harbour.  It seemed to extend to the base of the high mountainous range, and to be  separated only by a narrow isthmus from Fitton Harbour.    We had scarcely been at anchor half an hour when the same party of Fuegians  was seen arriving. The men hastened to us in their canoes, as soon as the  women had landed, to cover or thatch the wigwams, which they found  standing, and to light fires.    We afterwards went ashore, and, sitting down near them, commenced a brisk  trade for arrows, skins, necklaces, and other commodities. The furs which  covered their backs they parted with, for a few beads, and went quite naked  the whole evening.    Among them was a young man, who appeared to be treated {55} with some  deference by the others; he was one of the best-looking of the party; and  there was a good-natured smile on his countenance during our communication,  while the rest frequently manifested displeasure, even about trifles. He  was, at least, the master of one of the two families; his wigwam contained  his wife, and two children, his, or his wife's father, and mother, as well  as the idiot, and his wife, who, from her appearance, must have been a  Patagonian, or else a woman of unusual size among these people. The old  woman was very inquisitive, and the man, in a long speech, described to her  all the wonders I had shown him, applying to me, from time to time, to  point out to her the articles he was trying to describe.    Their dexterity with the sling is extraordinary; and, I should think, when  used as a weapon of offence, it must be very formidable. Upon asking the  same man to show us its use, he picked up a pebble, about the size of a  pigeon's egg, and placed it in the sling; then intimating that he was going  to strike a canoe, he turned his back to the mark, and threw the stone in  an opposite direction, against the trunk of a tree, whence it rebounded  over his head, and fell close to the canoe.    I have seen them strike a cap, placed upon the stump of a tree, fifty or  sixty yards off, with a stone from a sling. In using the bow and arrow,  also, with which they kill birds, they are very dexterous. The spear is  principally for striking porpoises and seals, but is also used in war; and  from the nature of the barb, must be an efficient weapon. For close  quarters, they use clubs, stones held in the hand, and short wooden  daggers, pointed with very sharp-edged quartz, pitch-stone, or flint.    The next morning, seeing us underweigh, they came alongside and tried to  induce us to anchor again. The young man, of whom I have spoken, was very  importunate, and at last offered us his wife, as a bribe, who used all her  fancied allurements to second his proposal.    So highly did they esteem beads and buttons, that a few of each would have  purchased the canoe, the wife, and children, {56} their dogs, and all the  furniture. Seeing us proceed to the southward, with the apparent intention  of sailing down the inlet, they motioned to us to go to the north,  repeatedly calling out 'Sherroo, sherroo,' and pointing to the northward;  which we thought intimated that there was no passage in the direction we  were taking.    At noon, I landed to observe the latitude, and take bearings down the Sound  to the S.E., at the bottom of which was a hill, standing by itself, as it  were, in mid-channel. The view certainly excited hopes of its being a  channel; and as we had begun to calculate upon reaching Nassau Bay in a few  days, we named this hill, Mount Hope.    The point on which we landed was at the foot of a high snow-capped hill,  called by us Mount Seymour; whence, had not the Indians been near, I should  have taken bearings.    We sailed south-eastward, close to the south shore, until the evening; when  from the summit of some hills, about three hundred feet above the sea, we  had a view down the Sound, which almost convinced us it would prove to be a  channel. The rock at this place differed from any we had seen in the  Strait. The mountains are high, and evidently of clay-slate; but the point,  near which we anchored, is a mass of hard, and very quartzose sand-stone,  much resembling the old red sand-stone formation of Europe, and precisely  like the rock of Goulburn Island, on the north coast of New Holland.[51]    The following morning (23d), we proceeded towards Mount Hope, while running  down to which some squalls passed over, clouding the south shore, and as we  passed Parry Harbour it bore so much the appearance of a channel, that we  stood into it; but the clouds clearing away soon exposed the bottom to our  view, where there seemed to be two arms or inlets. In the south-eastern  arm, the shores were covered with thick ice (like the bottom of Ainsworth  Harbour, to the west of Parry Harbour, where an immense glacier slopes down  to the water's edge). The south-west arm appeared to be well sheltered, and  if it affords a moderate depth of water, would be an excellent harbour.    {57}    After satisfying ourselves that there was no channel here, we bore up on  our original course; but, before long, found ourselves within two miles of  the bottom of the Sound; which is shallow, and appears to receive two  rivers. The great quantity of ice water, which mingles here with the sea,  changed its colour to so pale a blue, that we thought ourselves in fresh  water.    Mount Hope proved to be an isolated mass of hills, lying like the rest N.W.  and S.E., having low land to the southward, over which nothing was visible  except one hill, thirty or forty miles distant, covered with snow, to which  the rays of the sun gave the appearance of a sheet of gold. Finding  ourselves embayed, we hastened out of the scrape, and, after beating for  some hours, anchored in Parry Harbour.    Our entrance into a little cove in Parry Harbour disturbed a quantity of  ducks, steamers, shags, and geese. Their numbers showed that Indians had  not lately visited it."]]]
