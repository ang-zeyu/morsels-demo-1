Being unable to pay the high price of pardon that was demanded, he  was forced away, a few days before our departure, on that dreaded journey  to the capital, which few, if any, ever complete. For on the way they are  usually met by a messenger, who proffers them a cup of coffee, a sword,  and a rope, from which they are to choose the method of their doom. This,  then, was the occupant of the mysterious palanquin, which now was opened  as we drew up before the village caravansary. Out stepped a man, tall and  portly, with beard and hair of venerable gray. His keen eye, clear-cut  features, and dignified bearing, bespoke for him respect even in his  downfall, while his stooped shoulders and haggard countenance betrayed the  weight of sorrow and sleepless nights with which he was going to his tomb.      [Illustration: THE CONVEYANCE OF A PERSIAN OFFICIAL TRAVELING IN    DISGRACE TO TEHERAN AT THE CALL OF THE SHAH.]    At Miana, that town made infamous by its venomous insect, is located one  of the storage-stations of the Indo-European Telegraph Company. Its  straight lines of iron poles, which we followed very closely from Tabreez  to Teheran, form only a link in that great wire and cable chain which  connects Melbourne with London. We spent the following night in the German  operator's room.    The weakness of the Persian for mendacity is proverbial. One instance of  this national weakness was attended with considerable inconvenience to us.  By some mischance we had run by the village where we intended to stop for  the night, which was situated some distance off the road. Meeting a  Persian lad, we inquired the distance. He was ready at once with a  cheerful falsehood. \"One farsak\" (four miles), he replied, although he  must have known at the time that the village was already behind us. On we  pedaled at an increased rate, in order to precede, if possible, the  approaching darkness; for although traditionally the land of a double  dawn, Persia has only one twilight, and that closely merged into sunset  and darkness. One, two farsaks were placed behind us, and still there was  no sign of a human habitation. At length darkness fell; we were obliged to  dismount to feel our way. By the gradually rising ground, and the rocks,  we knew we were off the road. Dropping our wheels, we groped round on  hands and knees, to find, if possible, some trace of water. With a burning  thirst, a chilling atmosphere, and swarms of mosquitos biting through our  clothing, we could not sleep. A slight drizzle began to descend. During  our gloomy vigil we were glad to hear the sounds of a caravan, toward  which we groped our way, discerning, at length, a long line of camels  marching to the music of their lantern-bearing leader. When our  nickel-plated bars and white helmets flashed in the lantern-light, there  was a shriek, and the lantern fell to the ground. The rear-guard rushed to  the front with drawn weapons; but even they started back at the sound of  our voices, as we attempted in broken Turkish to reassure them.  Explanations were made, and the camels soon quieted. Thereupon we were  surrounded with lanterns and firebrands, while the remainder of the  caravan party was called to the front. Finally we moved on, walking side  by side with the lantern-bearing leader, who ran ahead now and then to  make sure of the road. The night was the blackest we had ever seen.  Suddenly one of the camels disappeared in a ditch, and rolled over with a  groan. Fortunately, no bones were broken, and the load was replaced. But  we were off the road, and a search was begun with lights to find the  beaten path. Footsore and hungry, with an almost intolerable thirst, we  trudged along till morning, to the ding-dong, ding-dong of the deep-toned  camel-bells. Finally we reached a sluggish river, but did not dare to  satisfy our thirst, except by washing out our mouths, and by taking  occasional swallows, with long intervals of rest, in one of which we fell  asleep from sheer exhaustion. When we awoke the midday sun was shining,  and a party of Persian travelers was bending over us.    From the high lands of Azerbeidjan, where, strange to say, nearly all  Persian pestilences arise, we dropped suddenly into the Kasveen plain, a  portion of that triangular, dried-up basin of the Persian Mediterranean,  now for the most part a sandy, saline desert. The argillaceous dust  accumulated on the Kasveen plain by the weathering of the surrounding  uplands resembles in appearance the \"yellow earth\" of the Hoang Ho  district in China, but remains sterile for the lack of water. Even the  little moisture that obtains beneath the surface is sapped by the  _kanots_, or underground canals, which bring to the fevered lips of the  desert oases the fresh, cool springs of the Elburz. These are dug with  unerring instinct, and preserved with jealous care by means of shafts or  slanting wells dug at regular intervals across the plain. Into these we  would occasionally descend to relieve our reflection-burned--or, as a  Persian would say, \"snow-burned\"--faces, while the thermometer above stood  at 120 deg. in the shade.    Over the level ninety-mile stretch between Kasveen and the capital a  so-called carriage-road has recently been constructed close to the base of  the mountain. A sudden turn round a mountain-spur, and before us was  presented to view Mount Demavend and Teheran. Soon the paved streets,  sidewalks, lamp-posts, street-railways, and even steam-tramway, of the  half modern capital were as much of a surprise to us as our \"wind horses\"  were to the curious crowds that escorted us to the French Hotel.      [Illustration: A PERSIAN REPAIRING THE WHEELS OF HIS WAGON.]    From Persia it was our plan to enter Russian central Asia, and thence to  proceed to China or Siberia. To enter the Transcaspian territory, the  border-province of the Russian possessions, the sanction of its governor,  General Kuropatkine, would be quite sufficient; but for the rest of the  journey through Turkestan the Russian minister in Teheran said we would  have to await a general permission from St. Petersburg. Six weeks were  spent with our English and American acquaintances, and still no answer was  received. Winter was coming on, and something had to be done at once. If  we were to be debarred from a northern route, we would have to attempt a  passage into India either through Afghanistan, which we were assured by  all was quite impossible, or across the deserts of southern Persia and  Baluchistan. For this latter we had already obtained a possible route from  the noted traveler, Colonel Stewart, whom we met on his way back to his  consular post at Tabreez. But just at this juncture the Russian minister  advised another plan. In order to save time, he said, we might proceed to  Meshed at once, and if our permission was not telegraphed to us at that  point, we could then turn south to Baluchistan as a last resort. This, our  friends unanimously declared, was a Muscovite trick to evade an absolute  refusal. The Russians, they assured us, would never permit a foreign  inspection of their doings on the Afghan border; and furthermore, we would  never be able to cross the uninhabited deserts of Baluchistan. Against all  protest, we waved \"farewell\" to the foreign and native throng which had  assembled to see us off, and on October 5 wheeled out of the fortified  square on the \"Pilgrim Road to Meshed.\"    Before us now lay six hundred miles of barren hills, swampy _kevirs_,  brier-covered wastes, and salty deserts, with here and there some  kanot-fed oases. To the south lay the lifeless desert of Luth, the  \"Persian Sahara,\" the humidity of which is the lowest yet recorded on the  face of the globe, and compared with which \"the Gobi of China and the  Kizil-Kum of central Asia are fertile regions.\" It is our extended and  rather unique experience on the former of these two that prompts us to  refrain from further description of desert travel here, where the  hardships were in a measure ameliorated by frequent stations, and by the  use of cucumbers and pomegranates, both of which we carried with us on the  long desert stretches. Melons, too, the finest we have ever seen in any  land, frequently obviated the necessity of drinking the strongly brackish  water.      [Illustration: LEAVING TEHERAN FOR MESHED.]    Yet this experience was sufficient to impress us with the fact that the  national poets, Hafiz and Sadi, like Thomas Moore, have sought in fancy  what the land of Iran denied them. Those \"spicy groves, echoing with the  nightingale's song,\" those \"rosy bowers and purling brooks,\" on the whole  exist, so far as our experience goes, only in the poet's dream.    Leaving on the right the sand-swept ruins of Veramin, that capital of  Persia before Teheran was even thought of, we traversed the pass of  Sir-Dara, identified by some as the famous \"Caspian Gate,\" and early in  the evening entered the village of Aradan. The usual crowd hemmed us in on  all sides, yelling, \"Min, min!\" (\"Ride, ride!\"), which took the place of  the Turkish refrain of \"Bin, bin!\" As we rode toward the caravansary they  shouted, \"Faster, faster!\" and when we began to distance them, they caught  at the rear wheels, and sent a shower of stones after us, denting our  helmets, and bruising our coatless backs. This was too much; we dismounted  and exhibited the ability to defend ourselves, whereupon they tumbled over  one another in their haste to get away. But they were at our wheels again  before we reached the caravansary. Here they surged through the narrow  gangway, and knocked over the fruit-stands of the bazaars.    We were shown to a room, or windowless cell, in the honeycomb structure  that surrounded an open quadrangular court, at the time filled with a  caravan of pilgrims,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31162"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 5, No. 3, March, 1852 (#14)"],[1,"to  other parts of the land, besides those appropriated to the raising of  tobacco, the manure will no longer be found on the plantation, and  general exhaustion and sterility must follow.    From what has been said about tobacco the reader will imagine, perhaps,  that I am an enemy to the noxious weed. Not altogether so; but the  reason, if not precisely similar to that which calls forth the article  in the London _Examiner_, springs from the same impulse: I love a good  cigar, and have been in my day an inveterate smoker, but hope, and am  now endeavoring, to overcome the useless and enervating habit, more  especially since I have seen the poverty and desolation occasioned in  Virginia from the cultivation of tobacco. Still I must confess, that  even now, like an old war horse when he smells powder, am I, when I come  in contact with the odoriferous exhalation of a good cigar. If he with  delight snuffs in his expanded nostrils the fumes of saltpetre and  charcoal, I, with no less pleasure, inhale the odor of a good Havana. If  he chafes and prances to rush into the battle, in me rises an elate  spirit, when, in the midst of a band of smokers, I see through the fog,  slowly curling and ascending, a miniature gallery of \"long nines\"  issuing from their port-holes, and hear the puffs, and see the smoke. At  such a time it is not safe to offer me a cigar, for then I feel like him  of the _Examiner_, that it is not well to be too hard upon an enemy.  Snuff I detest, and always have detested, notwithstanding the fact that  I once bought a gold snuff-box, upon the lid of which I had my family  coat-of-arms engraved.    \"Off again! Why don't you keep to the point?\" doubtless exclaims the  reader. The truth is, my position as an assailant of tobacco is somewhat  peculiar, such as may be appreciated by one who, having had a friend to  whom he is under obligation, has been led, upon meeting that friend, and  finding him in discredit, to give him the \"cold shoulder.\" It goes hard  with my feeling, if not with my conscience, to speak against tobacco.  Yet whatever virtue the weed itself may possess, it is now almost  universally conceded, that the cultivation of tobacco will ruin a  country. Let any one take a survey of lower Virginia, and he cannot help  coming to the conclusion, that it not only impoverishes the land, but if  followed up for a number of years, will be very apt to impoverish the  children of those who engage in its cultivation. Tobacco, say its  advocates, is a very profitable crop,--if by profit is meant a large  return in money, without reference to any thing else--granted. Much  money has been and will be made by cultivating it, and if the parent, as  the money is received, would safely invest it for the benefit of himself  and children, so that provision would be made for the time when he grows  old and they advance, and the land becomes exhausted and useless, they  will do very well. But few are sufficiently considerate to make this  provision, since it is naturally supposed that a plantation which for a  number of years has yielded a superabundance will not be likely to fail  in the future. They cannot see that year after year, slowly but surely,  the substance of their land is being taken away in the form of tobacco,  and that in the end their plantations will be barren and useless.  Estates comprising thousands of acres of good land yield annually large  incomes, upon which their owners live, with their families, in great  affluence. Surrounded by servants who stand ready to attend to every  want, the children are reared from their infancy with scarcely a wish  ungratified--thereby contracting most expensive habits, and becoming,  through the mistaken kindness and indulgence of their parents,  altogether unfitted for the hardships of life when adversity comes upon  them. It is not, in fact, often the case that parents so situated  remember that a change may take place by which they or their children  may be thrown upon the world and compelled to rely upon their own  exertions for a living. But experience shows that the cultivation of  tobacco tends almost inevitably to this. As year after year passes on,  section after section of productive land is taken up, and that which has  become already exhausted is left to put forth stunted pines, and await  the recuperative powers of nature. Thus men live on, with an increasing  family and a large and rapidly increasing number of servants to support,  until perhaps the head of the house is called away by death, and the  estate, if free from incumbrance, is divided among the children. Another  generation succeeds, and another division takes place--the soil all this  time becoming poor and poorer, and the quantity of land at each  subdivision becoming less for every member,--until a general exhaustion  is perceived, the land is left a wilderness, and the family scattered  over the country; the females, sensitive, well-educated, and spirited,  unfitted for contact with the world, and the sons too often branded as  spendthrifts because they cannot manage to live upon the land that  supported their fathers and their grandfathers.          A WORD ABOUT THE ARMY-PRIVATE.    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE.      We cannot make up our mind to look on this member of the universal  Yankee nation with quite as much distrust as is often evinced; with that  distrust which lies most where he is least known. Scarce one-sixth of  the lookers-on--as the liveried gentleman with a straight knee and stiff  upper-lip keeps up the ninety to a minute down the sunny side of  Greenwich-street--know aught of the animal, save that every day he  struts up and down at about the same hour. Mothers have nothing to say  for him, while fathers pass him with quite a look of contempt. Betty,  perhaps, is the least timid, and is foolish enough to let spurs and  cock-feathers tinge her dreams all night long, beside thinking of them a  dozen times next day. If she is from the old country, she has seen them  all her life, and has many friends \"as went a soldiering.\" The little  boys are more of the Betty order, and always show him the greatest  admiration and respect: as may be seen, any day, in the miniature  evolutions to the public squares, which always display enthusiasm, if  not the accuracy of strategical art. If there is but one private, you  will always be sure to find a captain and a drummer, and the army is  complete.    Why the senior and more intellectual world and his wife are more wary of  the Greenwich dragoon, is a question not easy of solution. Perhaps they  have read in books that he is apt to commit sundry excesses, not  approved of in the Scriptures, after the siege is over; or that, like  Captain Dalgetty, he will sometimes fight for plunder; or that his  profession tends to \"solitude and calling it peace.\" In a measure these  charges are certainly true; partly because poor human nature is frail,  and partly that there are tricks in all trades; not, however, we think,  to the extent that he should suffer excommunication without a hearing,  and while his own or adopted flag waves tranquilly over the land. Give  him credit when he deserves it, for it is his especial lot, when down,  to have no friends. In stirring times, however, when death is within the  walls and the enemy hard pressing at the gates, he has advocates and  admirers without number; then he has virtues worthy of notice; and while  his body receives the ball, his heart is praised for its devotion. Women  have embroidered silken banners for him, to strengthen his courage in  their defence, and put fine words thereon to serve him as a rallying  cry. In our revolutionary days, when the old continental spirit was  abroad, he was respected to a degree unknown perhaps at the present  time. The mistress entertained him with a hearty will, and the  respectable dame, who, when there was no flannel for making cartridges,  dropped something in the street that would make a dozen or more, enjoyed  the joke all her life, besides receiving a pension from Congress. That  he really receives now so much distrust, it is either because we know  nothing about him, or because the lightning age is so far advanced as to  leave his humble merits out of sight in the rear. He is rarely  noisy--never insults you--and passes well to the right in the street. He  is often polite, too; and if he does not, like Jack, offer to carry a  lady's muff, it is because his land-service has taught him the big thing  is not as heavy as it looks. If a mob defies the law, he will stand the  stones until one has knocked him out of the ranks. In short, he is a  complete protector and servitor of laws, of mothers, daughters, wives,  and property,--and, at the end of all, receiving his pittance with a  \"Good luck to those who live better and get more.\"    It is not our intention, be it known, to attempt doing away with any  prejudice good society may entertain for one of its \"sworn defenders;\"  for, as we have hinted, the soldier is not presumptuous, and never  curses his unlucky stars. Our only object is, to give a brief  pen-and-ink sketch of the man in his bonded condition; in fine, say so  much, or so little, about him, that the uninitiated, sitting by the warm  fire-side, and reading of the great cold in latitude 49 deg., or of the hot  pursuit in the Camanche country, may know something of poor Tobin, who  is made to suit every climate and every emergency.    It has often been a wonder with the curious, why enlistments take place  in times of profound peace; and the probable causes that lead to such  steps are, of course, much debated. We remember seeing, not long ago, in  the newspapers, a brief table of such causes, purporting to come from an  army surgeon who examined each recruit on the subject. It was funny, and  so startling withal, that while some laughed or stood aghast, others  hardly knew which to admire most, the doctor's"]]]
