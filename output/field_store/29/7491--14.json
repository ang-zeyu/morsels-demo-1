[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4352"],[0,"Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic (#14)"],[1,"h, invariably calls up the  image, dim or distinct, of a comic scene. This amounts to saying that  the comic in speech should correspond, point by point, with the comic  in actions and in situations, and is nothing more, if one may so  express oneself, than their projection on to the plane of words. So let  us return to the comic in actions and in situations, consider the chief  methods by which it is obtained, and apply them to the choice of words  and the building up of sentences. We shall thus have every possible  form of the comic in words as well as every variety of wit.    1. Inadvertently to say or do what we have no intention of saying or  doing, as a result of inelasticity or momentum, is, as we are aware,  one of the main sources of the comic. Thus, absentmindedness is  essentially laughable, and so we laugh at anything rigid, ready-made,  mechanical in gesture, attitude and even facial expression. Do we find  this kind of rigidity in language also? No doubt we do, since language  contains ready-made formulas and stereotyped phrases. The man who  always expressed himself in such terms would invariably be comic. But  if an isolated phrase is to be comic in itself, when once separated  from the person who utters it, it must be something more than  ready-made, it must bear within itself some sign which tells us, beyond  the possibility of doubt, that it was uttered automatically. This can  only happen when the phrase embodies some evident absurdity, either a  palpable error or a contradiction in terms. Hence the following general  rule: A COMIC MEANING IS INVARIABLY OBTAINED WHEN AN ABSURD IDEA IS  FITTED INTO A WELL-ESTABLISHED PHRASE-FORM.    \"Ce sabre est le plus beau jour de ma vie,\" said M. Prudhomme.  Translate the phrase into English or German and it becomes purely  absurd, though it is comic enough in French. The reason is that \"le  plus beau jour de ma vie\" is one of those ready-made phrase-endings to  which a Frenchman's ear is accustomed. To make it comic, then, we need  only clearly indicate the automatism of the person who utters it. This  is what we get when we introduce an absurdity into the phrase. Here the  absurdity is by no means the source of the comic, it is only a very  simple and effective means of making it obvious.    We have quoted only one saying of M. Prudhomme, but the majority of  those attributed to him belong to the same class. M. Prudhomme is a man  of ready-made phrases. And as there are ready-made phrases in all  languages, M. Prudhomme is always capable of being transposed, though  seldom of being translated. At times the commonplace phrase, under  cover of which the absurdity slips in, is not so readily noticeable. \"I  don't like working between meals,\" said a lazy lout. There would be  nothing amusing in the saying did there not exist that salutary precept  in the realm of hygiene: \"One should not eat between meals.\"    Sometimes, too, the effect is a complicated one. Instead of one  commonplace phrase-form, there are two or three which are dovetailed  into each other. Take, for instance, the remark of one of the  characters in a play by Labiche, \"Only God has the right to kill His  fellow-creature.\" It would seem that advantage is here taken of two  separate familiar sayings; \"It is God who disposes of the lives of  men,\" and, \"It is criminal for a man to kill his fellow-creature.\" But  the two sayings are combined so as to deceive the ear and leave the  impression of being one of those hackneyed sentences that are accepted  as a matter of course. Hence our attention nods, until we are suddenly  aroused by the absurdity of the meaning. These examples suffice to show  how one of the most important types of the comic can be projected--in a  simplified form--on the plane of speech. We will now proceed to a form  which is not so general.    2. \"We laugh if our attention is diverted to the physical in a person  when it is the moral that is in question,\" is a law we laid down in the  first part of this work. Let us apply it to language. Most words might  be said to have a PHYSICAL and a MORAL meaning, according as they are  interpreted literally or figuratively. Every word, indeed, begins by  denoting a concrete object or a material action; but by degrees the  meaning of the word is refined into an abstract relation or a pure  idea. If, then, the above law holds good here, it should be stated as  follows: \"A comic effect is obtained whenever we pretend to take  literally an expression which was used figuratively\"; or, \"Once our  attention is fixed on the material aspect of a metaphor, the idea  expressed becomes comic.\"    In the phrase, \"Tous les arts sont freres\" (all the arts are brothers),  the word \"frere\" (brother) is used metaphorically to indicate a more or  less striking resemblance. The word is so often used in this way, that  when we hear it we do not think of the concrete, the material  connection implied in every relationship. We should notice it more if  we were told that \"Tous les arts sont cousins,\" for the word \"cousin\"  is not so often employed in a figurative sense; that is why the word  here already assumes a slight tinge of the comic. But let us go further  still, and suppose that our attention is attracted to the material side  of the metaphor by the choice of a relationship which is incompatible  with the gender of the two words composing the metaphorical expression:  we get a laughable result. Such is the well-known saying, also  attributed to M. Prudhomme, \"Tous les arts (masculine) sont soeurs  (feminine).\" \"He is always running after a joke,\" was said in  Boufflers' presence regarding a very conceited fellow. Had Boufflers  replied, \"He won't catch it,\" that would have been the beginning of a  witty saying, though nothing more than the beginning, for the word  \"catch\" is interpreted figuratively almost as often as the word \"run\";  nor does it compel us more strongly than the latter to materialise the  image of two runners, the one at the heels of the other. In order that  the rejoinder may appear to be a thoroughly witty one, we must borrow  from the language of sport an expression so vivid and concrete that we  cannot refrain from witnessing the race in good earnest. This is what  Boufflers does when he retorts, \"I'll back the joke!\"    We said that wit often consists in extending the idea of one's  interlocutor to the point of making him express the opposite of what he  thinks and getting him, so to say, entrapt by his own words. We must  now add that this trap is almost always some metaphor or comparison the  concrete aspect of which is turned against him. You may remember the  dialogue between a mother and her son in the Faux Bonshommes: \"My dear  boy, gambling on 'Change is very risky. You win one day and lose the  next.\"--\"Well, then, I will gamble only every other day.\" In the same  play too we find the following edifying conversation between two  company-promoters: \"Is this a very honourable thing we are doing? These  unfortunate shareholders, you see, we are taking the money out of their  very pockets....\"--\"Well, out of what do you expect us to take it?\"    An amusing result is likewise obtainable whenever a symbol or an emblem  is expanded on its concrete side, and a pretence is made of retaining  the same symbolical value for this expansion as for the emblem itself.  In a very lively comedy we are introduced to a Monte Carlo official,  whose uniform is covered with medals, although he has only received a  single decoration. \"You see, I staked my medal on a number at  roulette,\" he said, \"and as the number turned up, I was entitled to  thirty-six times my stake.\" This reasoning is very similar to that  offered by Giboyer in the Effrontes. Criticism is made of a bride of  forty summers who is wearing orange-blossoms with her wedding costume:  \"Why, she was entitled to oranges, let alone orange-blossoms!\" remarked  Giboyer.    But we should never cease were we to take one by one all the laws we  have stated, and try to prove them on what we have called the plane of  language. We had better confine ourselves to the three general  propositions of the preceding section. We have shown that \"series of  events\" may become comic either by repetition, by inversion, or by  reciprocal interference. Now we shall see that this is also the case  with series of words.    To take series of events and repeat them in another key or another  environment, or to invert them whilst still leaving them a certain  meaning, or mix them up so that their respective meanings jostle one  another, is invariably comic, as we have already said, for it is  getting life to submit to be treated as a machine. But thought, too, is  a living thing. And language, the translation of thought, should be  just as living. We may thus surmise that a phrase is likely to become  comic if, though reversed, it still makes sense, or if it expresses  equally well two quite independent sets of ideas, or, finally, if it  has been obtained by transposing an idea into some key other than its  own. Such, indeed, are the three fundamental laws of what might be  called THE COMIC TRANSFORMATION OF SENTENCES, as we shall show by a few  examples.    Let it first be said that these three laws are far from being of equal  importance as regards the theory of the ludicrous. INVERSION is the  least interesting of the three. It must be easy of application,  however, for it is noticeable that, no sooner do professional wits hear  a sentence spoken than they experiment to see if a meaning cannot be  obtained by reversing it,--by putting, for instance, the subject in  place of the object, and the object in place of the subject. It is not  unusual for this device to be employed for refuting an idea in more or  less humorous terms. One of the characters in a comedy of Labiche  shouts out to his neighbour on the floor above, who is in the habit of  dirtying his balcony, \"What do you mean by emptying your"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4357"],[0,"American Fairy Tales (#14)"],[1," also put a coin into the contribution box.\"    Then, because the teapot would hold no more gold, the farmer emptied  the pail into the wood-box, covering the money with dried leaves and  twigs, that no one might suspect what lay underneath.    Afterward they dressed themselves in their best clothing and started  for the church, each taking a bright gold piece from the teapot as a  gift to the pastor.    Over the hill and down into the valley beyond they walked, feeling  so gay and light-hearted that they did not mind the distance at all.  At last they came to the little country church and entered just as  the services began.    Being proud of their wealth and of the gifts they had brought for  the pastor, they could scarcely wait for the moment when the deacon  passed the contribution box. But at last the time came, and the  farmer held his hand high over the box and dropped the gold piece so  that all the congregation could see what he had given. The woman did  likewise, feeling important and happy at being able to give the good  parson so much.    The parson, watching from the pulpit, saw the gold drop into the  box, and could hardly believe that his eyes did not deceive him.  However, when the box was laid upon his desk there were the two gold  pieces, and he was so surprised that he nearly forgot his sermon.    When the people were leaving the church at the close of the services  the good man stopped the farmer and his wife and asked:    \"Where did you get so much gold?\"    The woman gladly told him how she had rescued the beetle, and how,  in return, they had been rewarded with the wonderful pump. The  pastor listened to it all gravely, and when the story was finished  he said:    \"According to tradition strange things happened in this world ages  ago, and now I find that strange things may also happen to-day. For  by your tale you have found a beetle that can speak and also has  power to bestow upon you great wealth.\" Then he looked carefully at  the gold pieces and continued: \"Either this money is fairy gold or  it is genuine metal, stamped at the mint of the United States  government. If it is fairy gold it will disappear within 24 hours,  and will therefore do no one any good. If it is real money, then  your beetle must have robbed some one of the gold and placed it in  your well. For all money belongs to some one, and if you have not  earned it honestly, but have come by it in the mysterious way you  mention, it was surely taken from the persons who owned it, without  their consent. Where else could real money come from?\"    The farmer and his wife were confused by this statement and looked  guiltily at each other, for they were honest people and wished to  wrong no one.    \"Then you think the beetle stole the money?\" asked the woman.    \"By his magic powers he probably took it from its rightful owners.  Even bugs which can speak have no consciences and cannot tell the  difference between right and wrong. With a desire to reward you for  your kindness the beetle took from its lawful possessors the money  you pumped from the well.\"    \"Perhaps it really is fairy gold,\" suggested the man. \"If so, we  must go to the town and spend the money before it disappears.\"    \"That would be wrong,\" answered the pastor; \"for then the merchants  would have neither money nor goods. To give them fairy gold would be  to rob them.\"    \"What, then, shall we do?\" asked the poor woman, wringing her hands  with grief and disappointment.    \"Go home and wait until to-morrow. If the gold is then in your  possession it is real money and not fairy gold. But if it is real  money you must try to restore it to its rightful owners. Take, also,  these pieces which you have given me, for I cannot accept gold that  is not honestly come by.\"    Sadly the poor people returned to their home, being greatly  disturbed by what they had heard. Another sleepless night was  passed, and on Monday morning they arose at daylight and ran to see  if the gold was still visible.    \"It is real money, after all!\" cried the man; \"for not a single  piece has disappeared.\"    When the woman went to the brook that day she looked for the beetle,  and, sure enough, there he sat upon the flat stone.    \"Are you happy now?\" asked the beetle, as the woman paused before  him.    \"We are very unhappy,\" she answered; \"for, although you have given  us much gold, our good parson says it surely belongs to some one  else, and was stolen by you to reward us.\"    \"Your parson may be a good man,\" returned the beetle, with some  indignation, \"but he certainly is not overwise. Nevertheless, if you  do not want the gold I can take it from you as easily as I gave it.\"    \"But we do want it!\" cried the woman, fearfully. \"That is,\" she  added, \"if it is honestly come by.\"    \"It is not stolen,\" replied the beetle, sulkily, \"and now belongs to  no one but yourselves. When you saved my life I thought how I might  reward you; and, knowing you to be poor, I decided gold would make  you happier than anything else.    \"You must know,\" he continued, \"that although I appear so small and  insignificant, I am really king of all the insects, and my people  obey my slightest wish. Living, as they do, close to the ground, the  insects often come across gold and other pieces of money which have  been lost by men and have fallen into cracks or crevasses or become  covered with earth or hidden by grass or weeds. Whenever my people  find money in this way they report the fact to me; but I have always  let it lie, because it could be of no possible use to an insect.    \"However, when I decided to give you gold I knew just where to  obtain it without robbing any of your fellow creatures. Thousands of  insects were at once sent by me in every direction to bring the  pieces of lost gold to his hill. It cost my people several days of  hard labor, as you may suppose; but by the time your husband had  finished the well the gold began to arrive from all parts of the  country, and during the night my subjects dumped it all into the  well. So you may use it with a clear conscience, knowing that you  wrong no one.\"    This explanation delighted the woman, and when she returned to the  house and reported to her husband what the beetle had said he also  was overjoyed.    So they at once took a number of the gold pieces and went to the  town to purchase provisions and clothing and many things of which  they had long stood in need; but so proud were they of their newly  acquired wealth that they took no pains to conceal it. They wanted  everyone to know they had money, and so it was no wonder that when  some of the wicked men in the village saw the gold they longed to  possess it themselves.    \"If they spend this money so freely,\" whispered one to another,  \"there must be a great store of gold at their home.\"    \"That is true,\" was the answer. \"Let us hasten there before they  return and ransack the house.\"    So they left the village and hurried away to the farm on the hill,  where they broke down the door and turned everything topsy turvy  until they had discovered the gold in the wood-box and the teapot.  It did not take them long to make this into bundles, which they  slung upon their backs and carried off, and it was probably because  they were in a great hurry that they did not stop to put the house  in order again.    Presently the good woman and her husband came up the hill from the  village with their arms full of bundles and followed by a crowd of  small boys who had been hired to help carry the purchases. Then  followed others, youngsters and country louts, attracted by the  wealth and prodigality of the pair, who, from simple curiosity,  trailed along behind like the tail of a comet and helped swell the  concourse into a triumphal procession. Last of all came Guggins, the  shopkeeper, carrying with much tenderness a new silk dress which was  to be paid for when they reached the house, all the money they had  taken to the village having been lavishly expended.    The farmer, who had formerly been a modest man, was now so swelled  with pride that he tipped the rim of his hat over his left ear and  smoked a big cigar that was fast making him ill. His wife strutted  along beside him like a peacock, enjoying to the full the homage and  respect her wealth had won from those who formerly deigned not to  notice her, and glancing from time to time at the admiring  procession in the rear.    But, alas for their new-born pride! when they reached the farmhouse  they found the door broken in, the furniture strewn in all  directions and their treasure stolen to the very last gold piece.    The crowd grinned and made slighting remarks of a personal nature,  and Guggins, the shopkeeper, demanded in a loud voice the money for  the silk dress he had brought.    Then the woman whispered to her husband to run and pump some more  gold while she kept the crowd quiet, and he obeyed quickly. But  after a few moments he returned with a white face to tell her the  pump was dry, and not a gold piece could now be coaxed from the  spout.    The procession marched back to the village laughing and jeering at  the farmer and his wife, who had pretended to be so rich; and some  of the boys were naughty enough to throw stones at the house from  the top of the hill. Mr. Guggins carried away his dress after  severely scolding the woman for deceiving him, and when the couple  at last found themselves alone their pride had turned to humiliation  and their joy to bitter grief.    Just before sundown the woman dried her eyes and, having resumed her  ordinary attire, went to the brook for water. When she came to the  flat stone she saw the King Beetle sitting upon it.    \"The well is dry!\" she cried out, angrily.    \"Yes,\" answered the beetle, calmly, \"you have pumped from it all the  gold my people could find.\"    \"But we are now ruined,\" said the woman, sitting down in the path  beginning to weep; \"for robbers have stolen from"]]]
