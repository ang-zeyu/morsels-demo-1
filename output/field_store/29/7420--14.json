They were fortuitous  helpers; they were never called in. They were welcomed without  disagreement, but also without gratitude. They were not summoned; they  were tolerated. In the glazed shelter where I keep the cage I happened  to catch one of these chance assistants in the act. Passing that way in  the night and scenting dead flesh, he had entered where none of his  kind had yet penetrated of his own free will. I surprised him on the  wire-gauze dome of the cover. If the wire had not prevented him, he  would have set to work incontinently, in company with the rest. Had my  captives invited him? Assuredly not. He had hastened thither attracted  by the odour of the Mole, heedless of the efforts of others. So it was  with those whose obliging assistance is extolled. I repeat, in respect  of their imaginary prowess, what I have said elsewhere of that of the  Sacred Beetles: the story is a childish one, worthy of ranking with any  fairy-tale written for the amusement of the simple.    A hard soil, necessitating the removal of the body, is not the only  difficulty familiar to the Necrophori. Often, perhaps more often than  not, the ground is covered with grass, above all with couch-grass,  whose tenacious rootlets form an inextricable network below the  surface. To dig in the interstices is possible, but to drag the dead  animal through them is another matter: the meshes of the net are too  close to give it passage. Will the grave-digger find himself reduced to  impotence by such an impediment, which must be an extremely common one?  That could not be.    Exposed to this or that habitual obstacle in the exercise of his  calling, the animal is always equipped accordingly; otherwise his  profession would be impracticable. No end is attained without the  necessary means and aptitudes. Besides that of the excavator, the  Necrophorus certainly possesses another art: the art of breaking the  cables, the roots, the stolons, the slender rhizomes which check the  body's descent into the grave. To the work of the shovel and the pick  must be added that of the shears. All this is perfectly logical and may  be foreseen with complete lucidity. Nevertheless, let us invoke  experiment, the best of witnesses.    I borrow from the kitchen-range an iron trivet whose legs will supply a  solid foundation for the engine which I am devising. This is a coarse  network of strips of raphia, a fairly accurate imitation of the network  of couch-grass roots. The very irregular meshes are nowhere wide enough  to admit of the passage of the creature to be buried, which in this  case is a Mole. The trivet is planted with its three feet in the soil  of the cage; its top is level with the surface of the soil. A little  sand conceals the meshes. The Mole is placed in the centre; and my  squad of sextons is let loose upon the body.    Without a hitch the burial is accomplished in the course of an  afternoon. The hammock of raphia, almost equivalent to the natural  network of couch-grass turf, scarcely disturbs the process of  inhumation. Matters do not go forward quite so quickly; and that is  all. No attempt is made to shift the Mole, who sinks into the ground  where he lies. The operation completed, I remove the trivet. The  network is broken at the spot where the corpse lay. A few strips have  been gnawed through; a small number, only so many as were strictly  necessary to permit the passage of the body.    Well done, my undertakers! I expected no less of your savoir-faire. You  have foiled the artifices of the experimenter by employing your  resources against natural obstacles. With mandibles for shears, you  have patiently cut my threads as you would have gnawed the cordage of  the grass-roots. This is meritorious, if not deserving of exceptional  glorification. The most limited of the insects which work in earth  would have done as much if subjected to similar conditions.    Let us ascend a stage in the series of difficulties. The Mole is now  fixed with a lashing of raphia fore and aft to a light horizontal  cross-bar which rests on two firmly-planted forks. It is like a joint  of venison on a spit, though rather oddly fastened. The dead animal  touches the ground throughout the length of its body.    The Necrophori disappear under the corpse, and, feeling the contact of  its fur, begin to dig. The grave grows deeper and an empty space  appears, but the coveted object does not descend, retained as it is by  the cross-bar which the two forks keep in place. The digging slackens,  the hesitations become prolonged.    However, one of the grave-diggers ascends to the surface, wanders over  the Mole, inspects him and ends by perceiving the hinder strap.  Tenaciously he gnaws and ravels it. I hear the click of the shears that  completes the rupture. Crack! The thing is done. Dragged down by his  own weight, the Mole sinks into the grave, but slantwise, with his head  still outside, kept in place by the second ligature.    The Beetles proceed to the burial of the hinder part of the Mole; they  twitch and jerk it now in this direction, now in that. Nothing comes of  it; the thing refuses to give. A fresh sortie is made by one of them to  discover what is happening overhead. The second ligature is perceived,  is severed in turn, and henceforth the work proceeds as well as could  be desired.    My compliments, perspicacious cable-cutters! But I must not exaggerate.  The lashings of the Mole were for you the little cords with which you  are so familiar in turfy soil. You have severed them, as well as the  hammock of the previous experiment, just as you sever with the blades  of your shears any natural filament which stretches across your  catacombs. It is, in your calling, an indispensable knack. If you had  had to learn it by experience, to think it out before practising it,  your race would have disappeared, killed by the hesitations of its  apprenticeship, for the spots fertile in Moles, Frogs, Lizards and  other victuals to your taste are usually grass-covered.    You are capable of far better things yet; but, before proceeding to  these, let us examine the case when the ground bristles with slender  brushwood, which holds the corpse at a short distance from the ground.  Will the find thus suspended by the hazard of its fall remain  unemployed? Will the Necrophori pass on, indifferent to the superb  tit-bit which they see and smell a few inches above their heads, or  will they make it descend from its gibbet?    Game does not abound to such a point that it can be disdained if a few  efforts will obtain it. Before I see the thing happen I am persuaded  that it will fall, that the Necrophori, often confronted by the  difficulties of a body which is not lying on the soil, must possess the  instinct to shake it to the ground. The fortuitous support of a few  bits of stubble, of a few interlaced brambles, a thing so common in the  fields, should not be able to baffle them. The overthrow of the  suspended body, if placed too high, should certainly form part of their  instinctive methods. For the rest, let us watch them at work.    I plant in the sand of the cage a meagre tuft of thyme. The shrub is at  most some four inches in height. In the branches I place a Mouse,  entangling the tail, the paws and the neck among the twigs in order to  increase the difficulty. The population of the cage now consists of  fourteen Necrophori and will remain the same until the close of my  investigations. Of course they do not all take part simultaneously in  the day's work; the majority remain underground, somnolent, or occupied  in setting their cellars in order. Sometimes only one, often two, three  or four, rarely more, busy themselves with the dead creature which I  offer them. To-day two hasten to the Mouse, who is soon perceived  overhead in the tuft of thyme.    They gain the summit of the plant by way of the wire trellis of the  cage. Here are repeated, with increased hesitation, due to the  inconvenient nature of the support, the tactics employed to remove the  body when the soil is unfavourable. The insect props itself against a  branch, thrusting alternately with back and claws, jerking and shaking  vigorously until the point where at it is working is freed from its  fetters. In one brief shift, by dint of heaving their backs, the two  collaborators extricate the body from the entanglement of twigs. Yet  another shake; and the Mouse is down. The burial follows.    There is nothing new in this experiment; the find has been dealt with  just as though it lay upon soil unsuitable for burial. The fall is the  result of an attempt to transport the load.    The time has come to set up the Frog's gibbet celebrated by Gledditsch.  The batrachian is not indispensable; a Mole will serve as well or even  better. With a ligament of raphia I fix him, by his hind-legs, to a  twig which I plant vertically in the ground, inserting it to no great  depth. The creature hangs plumb against the gibbet, its head and  shoulders making ample contact with the soil.    The gravediggers set to work beneath the part which lies upon the  ground, at the very foot of the stake; they dig a funnel-shaped hole,  into which the muzzle, the head and the neck of the mole sink little by  little. The gibbet becomes uprooted as they sink and eventually falls,  dragged over by the weight of its heavy burden. I am assisting at the  spectacle of the overturned stake, one of the most astonishing examples  of rational accomplishment which has ever been recorded to the credit  of the insect.    This, for one who is considering the problem of instinct, is an  exciting moment. But let us beware of forming conclusions as yet; we  might be in too great a hurry. Let us ask ourselves first whether the  fall of the stake was intentional or fortuitous. Did the Necrophori lay  it bare with the express intention "]]]
