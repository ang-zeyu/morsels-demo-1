The sacks are  tied with string to the posts under the water. You just stalk by in  your dignified beauty and make a note of the spot. That's where  glory waits you, and when Fame elates you and you're a sergeant,  please remember me.\"    Johnson said he was blessed. He said it more than once, and then  remarked that he was on, and added that he must be off that instant  minute.    Johnson's cottage lies just out of the town beyond the blacksmith's  forge and the children had come to it through the wood. They went  back the same way, and then down through the town, and through  its narrow, unsavoury streets to the towing-path by the timber yard.  Here they ran along the trunks of the big trees, peeped into the  saw-pit, and the men were away at dinner and this was a favourite  play place of every boy within miles made themselves a see-saw  with a fresh cut, sweet-smelling pine plank and an elm-root.    \"What a ripping place!\" said Mabel, breathless on the seesaw's end.  \"I believe I like this better than pretending games or even magic.\"    \"So do I,\" said Jimmy. \"Jerry, don't keep sniffing so  you'll have no  nose left.\"    \"I can't help it,\" Gerald answered; \"I daren't use my hankey for fear  Johnson's on the lookout somewhere unseen. I wish I'd thought of  some other signal.\" Sniff! \"No, nor I shouldn't want to now if I  hadn't got not to. That's what's so rum. The moment I got down  here and remembered what I'd said about the signal I began to have  a cold and Thank goodness! here he is.\"    The children, with a fine air of unconcern, abandoned the see-saw.  \"Follow my leader!\" Gerald cried, and ran along a barked oak  trunk, the others following. In and out and round about ran the file  of children, over heaps of logs, under the jutting ends of piled  planks, and just as the policeman's heavy boots trod the  towing-path Gerald halted at the end of a little landing-stage of  rotten boards, with a rickety handrail, cried \"Pax!\" and blew his  nose with loud fervour.    \"Morning,\" he said immediately.    \"Morning,\" said Johnson. \"Got a cold, ain't you?\"    \"Ah! I shouldn't have a cold if I'd got boots like yours,\" returned  Gerald admiringly. \"Look at them. Anyone ud know your fairy  footstep a mile off. How do you ever get near enough to anyone to  arrest them?\" He skipped off the landing-stage, whispered as he  passed Johnson, \"Courage, promptitude, and dispatch. That's the  place,\" and was off again, the active leader of an active procession.    \"We've brought a friend home to dinner,\" said Kathleen, when  Eliza opened the door. \"Where's Mademoiselle?\"    \"Gone to see Yalding Towers. Today's show day, you know. An  just you hurry over your dinners. It's my afternoon out, and my  gentleman friend don't like it if he's kept waiting.\"    \"All right, we'll eat like lightning,\" Gerald promised. \"Set another  place, there's an angel.\"    They kept their word. The dinner it was minced veal and potatoes  and rice-pudding, perhaps the dullest food in the world was over in  a quarter of an hour.    \"And now,\" said Mabel, when Eliza and a jug of hot water had  disappeared up the stairs together, \"where's the ring? I ought to put  it back.\"    \"I haven't had a turn yet,\" said Jimmy. \"When we find it Cathy and  I ought to have turns same as you and Gerald did.\"    \"When you find it ?\" Mabel's pale face turned paler between her  dark locks.    \"I'm very sorry we're all very sorry,\" began Kathleen, and then the  story of the losing had to be told.    \"You couldn't have looked properly,\" Mabel protested. \"It can't  have vanished.\"    \"You don't know what it can do no more do we. It's no use getting  your quills up, fair lady. Perhaps vanishing itself is just what it  does do. You see, it came off my hand in the bed. We looked  everywhere.\"    \"Would you mind if I looked?\" Mabel's eyes implored her little  hostess. \"You see, if it's lost it's my fault. It's almost the same as  stealing. That Johnson would say it was just the same. I know he  would.\"    \"Let's all look again,\" said Cathy, jumping up. \"We were rather in a  hurry this morning.\"    So they looked, and they looked. In the bed, under the bed, under  the carpet, under the furniture. They shook the curtains, they  explored the corners, and found dust and flue, but no ring. They  looked, and they looked. Everywhere they looked. Jimmy even  looked fixedly at the ceiling, as though he thought the ring might  have bounced up there and stuck. But it hadn't.    \"Then,\" said Mabel at last, \"your housemaid must have stolen it.  That's all. I shall tell her I think so.\"    And she would have done it too, but at that moment the front door  banged and they knew that Eliza had gone forth in all the glory of  her best things to meet her \"gentleman friend\" .    \"It's no use,\" Mabel was almost in tears; \"look here will you leave  me alone? Perhaps you others looking distracts me. And I'll go  over every inch of the room by myself.\"    \"Respecting the emotion of their guest, the kindly charcoal-burners  withdrew,\" said Gerald. And they closed the door softly from the  outside on Mabel and her search.    They waited for hers of course politeness demanded it, and  besides, they had to stay at home to let Mademoiselle in; though it  was a dazzling day, and Jimmy had just remembered that Gerald's  pockets were full of the money earned at the fair, and that nothing  had yet been bought with that money, except a few buns in which  he had had no share. And of course they waited impatiently.    It seemed about an hour, and was really quite ten minutes, before  they heard the bedroom door open and Mabel's feet on the stairs.    \"She hasn't found it,\" Gerald said.    \"How do you know?\" Jimmy asked.    \"The way she walks,\" said Gerald. You can, in fact, almost always  tell whether the thing has been found that people have gone to look  for by the sound of their feet as they return. Mabel's feet said \"No  go\" as plain as they could speak. And her face confirmed the  cheerless news.    A sudden and violent knocking at the back door prevented anyone  from having to be polite about how sorry they were, or fanciful  about being sure the ring would turn up soon.    All the servants except Eliza were away on their holidays, so the  children went together to open the door, because, as Gerald said, if  it was the baker they could buy a cake from him and eat it for  dessert. \"That kind of dinner sort of needs dessert,\" he said.    But it was not the baker, When they opened the    door they saw in the paved court where the pump is, and the  dust-bin, and the water-butt, a young man, with his hat very much  on one side, his mouth open under his fair bristly mustache, and  his eyes as nearly round as human eyes can be. He wore a suit of a  bright mustard colour, a blue necktie, and a goldish watch-chain  across his waistcoat. His body was thrown back and his right arm  stretched out towards the door, and his expression was that of a  person who is being dragged somewhere against his will. He  looked so strange that Kathleen tried to shut the door in his face,  murmuring, \"Escaped insane.\" But the door would not close. There  was something in the way.    \"Leave go of me!\" said the young man.    \"Ho yus! I'll leave go of you!\" It was the voice of Eliza but no Eliza  could be seen.    \"Who's got hold of you?\" asked Kathleen.    \"She has, miss,\" replied the unhappy stranger.    \"Who's she?\" asked Kathleen, to gain time, as she afterwards  explained, for she now knew well enough that what was keeping  the door open was Eliza's unseen foot.    \"My fyongsay, miss. At least it sounds like her voice, and it feels  like her bones, but something's come over me, miss, an I can't see  her.\"    \"That's what he keeps on saying,\" said Eliza's voice. \"E's my  gentleman friend; is 'e gone dotty, or is it me?\"    \"Both, I shouldn't wonder,\" said Jimmy.    \"Now,\" said Eliza, \"you call yourself a man; you look me in the  face and say you can't see me.\"    \"Well I can't,\" said the wretched gentleman friend.    \"If I'd stolen a ring,\" said Gerald, looking at the sky, \"I should go  indoors and be quiet, not stand at the back door and make an  exhibition of myself.\"    \"Not much exhibition about her,\" whispered Jimmy; \"good old  ring!\"    \"I haven't stolen anything,\" said the gentleman friend. \"Here, you  leave me be. It's my eyes has gone wrong. Leave go of me, d'ye  hear?\"    Suddenly his hand dropped and he staggered back against the  water-butt. Eliza had \"left go\" of him. She pushed past the  children, shoving them aside with her invisible elbows. Gerald  caught her by the arm with one hand, felt for her ear with the  other, and whispered, \"You stand still and don't say a word. If you  do well, what's to stop me from sending for the police?\"    Eliza did not know what there was to stop him. So she did as she  was told, and stood invisible and silent, save for a sort of blowing,  snorting noise peculiar to her when she was out of breath.    The mustard-coloured young man had recovered his balance, and  stood looking at the children with eyes, if possible, rounder than  before.    \"What is it?\" he gasped feebly. \"What's up? What's it all about?\"    \"If you don't know, I'm afraid we can't tell you,\" said Gerald  politely.    \"Have I been talking very strange-like?\" he asked, taking off his  hat and passing his hand over his forehead.    \"Very,\" said Mabel.    \"I hope I haven't said anything that wasn't good manners,\" he said  anxiously.    \"Not at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35409"],[0,"Beauty: Illustrated Chiefly (#14)"],[1,"of the primary  pleasures of sense, of the secondary pleasures of the imagination, and of  the conclusions of the reasoning faculty, concerning the various relations  of these, and concerning the human passions, manners, and actions.\"    \"It is sufficient for our present purpose,\" Hume farther observes, \"if we  have proved that the taste of all individuals is not upon an equal  footing, and that some men in general, however difficult to be  particularly pitched upon, will be acknowledged by universal sentiment to  have a preference above others.    \"Though men of delicate taste be rare, they are easily to be distinguished  in society by the soundness of their understanding, and the superiority of  their faculties above the rest of mankind. The ascendant which they  acquire, gives a prevalence to that lively approbation, with which they  receive any productions of genius, and renders it generally predominant.  Many men, when left to themselves, have but a faint and dubious perception  of beauty, who yet are capable of relishing any fine stroke which is  pointed out to them. Every convert to the admiration of the real poet or  orator, is the cause of some new conversion. And though prejudices may  prevail for a time, they never unite in celebrating any rival to the true  genius, but yield at last to the force of nature and just sentiment.\"    Hume finally obviates some apparent difficulties:--    \"But notwithstanding all our endeavors to fix a standard of taste, and  reconcile the discordant apprehensions of men, there still remain two  sources of variation, which are not sufficient indeed to confound all the  boundaries of beauty and deformity, but will often serve to produce a  difference in the degrees of our approbation or blame. The one is the  different humors of particular men; the other, the particular manner and  opinions of our age and country.    \"A young man, whose passions are warm, will be more sensibly touched with  amorous and tender images, than a man more advanced in years, who takes  pleasure in wise, philosophical reflections concerning the conduct of life  and moderation of the passions. At twenty, Ovid may be the favorite  author; Horace at forty; and perhaps Tacitus at fifty. Vainly would we, in  such cases, endeavor to enter into the sentiments of others, and divest  ourselves of those propensities which are natural to us. We choose our  favorite author as we do our friend, from a conformity of humor and  disposition.    \"Such preferences are innocent and unavoidable, and can never reasonably  be the object of dispute, because there is no standard by which they can  be decided.    \"For a like reason, we are more pleased, in the course of our reading,  with pictures and characters that resemble objects which are found in our  own age or country, than with those which describe a different set of  customs.    \"A man of learning and reflection can make allowance for these  peculiarities of manners; but a common audience can never divest  themselves so far of their usual ideas and sentiments, as to relish  pictures which nowise resemble them.\"    Thus I believe the reader has before him a view, sufficiently clear, of  that popular topic, the standard of taste, as well as of the agreement  which subsists among the best writers on the subject. In the next chapter,  we proceed to a more fundamental and difficult inquiry.          CHAPTER VI.    THE ELEMENTS OF BEAUTY.[11]      On the subject of the preceding chapter, even the reasonings of Hume  appear to me to be of too vague and indefinite a kind. It requires the  more minute scrutiny into which I shall now enter, in order to place it  upon a deeper and more scientific foundation. If I can here show that, in  the material qualities of the objects of nature and art, there exist  elements of beauty equally invariable in themselves and in the kind of  effect they produce upon the mind, it is evident there can be no farther  dispute about a standard of beauty.    Many attempts have been made to determine the material elements of beauty,  by Hogarth, Home, and others. All have more or less failed, from not  observing that these elements are modified, varied, and complicated, as we  advance from the most simple to the most complex class of natural beings,  or of the arts which relate to these respectively. Many partial views of  perfect truth and great interest have been taken, and by every one of  these it will be my duty here to profit: but, from the failure just  pointed out, no philosophical and systematic doctrine of beauty, ascending  from its origin in elements through its higher combinations, has ever been  attained by any of the numerous, deep, acute, and elegant thinkers who  have devoted their time to this subject, as the foundation of taste and of  the fine or intellectual arts.    Profiting, as I ought to do, by the partial views of these philosophers, I  pretend here only to take one larger view--to analyze, to generalize, to  systematize, the materials which they present to me.    In the hope of accomplishing this, I shall now endeavor successively to  trace the elements of beauty which belong respectively to inanimate,  living, and thinking beings, and to the useful, ornamental, and  intellectual arts which have a reference to these, the neglect of all  which I have described as the fundamental cause of previous failure.    Again, I repeat, it is to this analysis and generalization alone, and to  the systemization founded upon it, that I make any pretence. The materials  have long been presented by all the great writers on the subject: they  have only left them in confusion, and without conclusion. I shall now  proceed to employ them.      SECTION I.    ELEMENTS OF BEAUTY IN INANIMATE BEINGS.    Though Burke did not accurately trace the elements of beauty in any one  class of the objects of nature or art, he yet states a preliminary truth  on this subject so well, that I here quote it: \"It would be absurd,\" he  observes, \"to say that all things affect us by association only; since  some things must have been originally and naturally agreeable or  disagreeable, from which the others derive their associated powers; and it  would be, I fancy, to little purpose to look for the cause of our passions  in association, until we fail of it in the natural properties of things.\"    Home, advancing farther, says: \"If a tree be beautiful by means of its  color, its figure, its size, its motion, it is in reality possessed of so  many different beauties, which ought to be examined separately, in order  to have a clear notion of the whole.    \"When any body is viewed as a whole, the beauty of its figure arises from  regularity[12] and simplicity; and viewing the parts with relation to each  other, from uniformity[12], proportion, and order.\"    I will here only observe that these are the qualities, as will speedily  appear, which Burke should have set down as the fundamental and first  characteristics of beauty, instead of relative littleness, which belongs  not to beauty generally, but only to the minor or subordinate beauty.    Even Home, having arrived thus far, says: \"To inquire why an object, by  means of the particulars mentioned, appears beautiful, would, I am afraid,  be a vain attempt.\"    But he truly adds: \"One thing is clear, that regularity, uniformity,  order, and simplicity, contribute each of them to readiness of  apprehension, and enable us to form more distinct images of objects than  can be done, with the utmost attention, where these particulars are not  found.\" And he subjoins: \"This final cause is, I acknowledge, too slight,  to account satisfactorily for a taste that makes a figure so illustrious  in the nature of man; and that this branch of our constitution has a  purpose still more important, we have great reason to believe.\"    Now had Home seen that the characteristics of general beauty always are,  with regard to the object, accordant and agreeable relations, the  importance of the qualities he has just enumerated would have been  evident; for, without them, these characteristics of the object could not  exist: simplicity, regularity, uniformity, order, &c., are the very  elements of accordant and agreeable relations. This is in reality the  still more important purpose in which Home believed, and to which the  readiness of apprehension he now alludes to eminently contributes.    As to simplicity, he observes, that \"a multitude of objects crowding into  the mind at once, disturb the attention, and pass without making any  impression, or any lasting impression; and in a group, no single object  makes the figure it would do apart, when it occupies the whole attention.  For the same reason, even a single object, when it divides the attention  by the multiplicity of its parts, equals not, in strength of impression, a  more simple object comprehended in a single view: parts extremely complex  must be considered in portions successively; and a number of impressions  in succession, which cannot unite because not simultaneous, never touch  the mind like one entire impression made as it were at one stroke.    \"A square is less beautiful than a circle, because it is less simple: a  circle has parts as well as a square; but its parts not being distinct  like those of a square, it makes one entire impression; whereas, the  attention is divided among the sides and angles of a square.... A square,  though not more regular than a hexagon or octagon, is more beautiful than  either, because a square is more simple, and the attention less divided.    \"Simplicity thus contributes to beauty.\"    By regularity is meant that circumstance in a figure by which we perceive  it to be formed according to a certain rule. Thus, a circle, a square, a  parallelogram, or triangle, pleases by its regularity.    \"A square,\" says Home--(who here furnishes the best materials to a more  general view, because he most frequently assigns physical"]]]
