Of course the desired elevation could have been obtained by forcing  more gas from the machine into the big, red container overhead, but it  was decided to be as sparing of this vapor as possible, since the  voyagers did not want to descend to get more material, in case they  used up what they had. It was just as easy to rise by properly working  the rudders, when the ship was in motion, and that was the method now  employed.    With the great propellers, fore and aft, making about a thousand  revolutions a minute the craft slanted up toward the sky.    The ship was not being run at top speed as Mr. Sharp did not care to  force it, and there was no need for haste. Long distance, rather than  high speed was being aimed at on this first important flight.    Tom was at the steering wheel, and, with his hand on the lever  controlling the elevation rudder, kept watch of the face of Mr. Damon,  occasionally noting what height the hand on the gauge registered. He  fancied he saw the cheeks of his friend growing pale, and, when a  height of thirty-five hundred feet was indicated, with a yank the young  inventor put the airship on a level keel.    \"Are you distressed, Mr. Damon?\" he asked.    \"Ye--yes, I--I have--some--some difficulty in breathing,\" was the  answer.    Tom gave his friend the same advice the aeronaut had given the lad on  his first trip, and the eccentric man soon felt better.    \"Bless my buttons!\" he ventured to explain. \"But I feel as if I had  lost several pounds of flesh, and I'm glad of it.\"    Mr. Sharp was busy with the motor, which needed some slight  adjustments, and Tom was in sole charge of navigating the airship. He  had lost the nervous feeling that first possessed him, and was becoming  quite an expert at meeting various currents of wind encountered in the  upper regions.    Below, the voyagers could see the earth spread out like a great map.  They could not tell their exact location now, but by calculating their  speed, which was about thirty miles an hour, Tom figured out that they  were above the town of Centreford, near where he had been attacked once  by the model thieves.    For several hours the airship kept on her way, maintaining a height of  about a mile, for when it was found that Mr. Damon could accommodate  himself to thirty-five hundred feet the elevation rudder was again  shifted to send the craft upward.    By using glasses the travelers could see crowds on the earth watching  their progress in the air, and, though airships, dirigible balloons and  aeroplanes are getting fairly common now, the appearance of one as  novel and as large as the Red Cloud could always be depended upon to  attract attention.    \"Well, what do you say to something to eat?\" proposed Mr. Sharp, coming  into the main cabin, from the motor compartment. \"It's twelve o'clock,  though we can't hear the factory whistles up, here.\"    \"I'm ready, any time you are,\" called Tom, from the pilot house.  \"Shall I cook grub, Mr. Sharp?\"    \"No, you manage the ship, and I'll play cook. We'll not get a very  elaborate meal this time, as I shall have to pay occasional visits to  the motor, which isn't running just to suit me.\"    The electrical stove was set going, and some soup and beefsteak from  among the stores, was put on the fire. In spite of the fact that the  day was a warm one in October, it was quite cool in the cabin, until  the stove took off the chill. The temperature of the upper regions was  several degrees below that of the earth. At times the ship passed  through little wisps of vapor-clouds in the making.    \"Isn't this wonderful!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, as he sat in an easy  chair, partaking of some of the food. \"To think that I have lived to  see the day when I can take my lunch a mile in the air, with a craft  flying along like a bird. Bless my knife and fork but it certainly is  wonderful.\"    Mr. Sharp relieved Tom at the wheel, while the young inventor ate, and  then, with the airship heading southwest, the speed was increased a  trifle, the balloonist desiring to see what the motor could accomplish  under a heavy load.    A drop of several hundred feet was made about an hour later, and, as  this made it warmer, Mr. Damon, who was a great lover of fresh air,  decided to go out on the platform in front of the cabin. This platform,  and a similar one at the rear, was railed about, to prevent accidents.  A fine view could be had from them much better than through the floor  windows of the car.    \"Be careful of the propeller,\" advised Tom, as his friend went outside.  \"I don't believe you're tall enough to be hit by the blades, but don't  take any chances of standing on your tiptoes.\"    \"Bless my pocket handkerchief, indeed I'll not,\" came the answer. \"But  I think I shall wrap up my throat in the scarf I brought along. I am  subject to neuralgia, and the breeze may bring on an attack of it.\"    Wrapping a long, woolen scarf about his neck, the eccentric man ventured  out on the open platform. About the middle of it, but sufficiently high  to be above a person's head, was the forward propeller, whirring around  at swift speed.    Tom, with his eye on the various gauges and the compass, was steering  the airship. He glanced at Mr. Damon, who appeared to be enjoying the  view from the platform. For an instant the eyes of the lad were taken  from the form of his friend. He looked back suddenly, however, his  attention attracted by a smothered cry. He was horrified by what he saw.    Mr. Damon was leaning far over the edge of the railing, with nothing  between him and the earth a thousand feet below. He seemed to have lost  his balance and had toppled forward, being doubled up on the iron pipe  railing, his hands hanging limply over. Then, as Tom cried to Mr. Sharp  to shut off the motor, the lad saw that, hanging to the blade of the  propeller, and being whirled around in its revolutions, was a part of  Mr. Damon's red scarf.    \"Hurry! Hurry, Mr. Sharp!\" yelled Tom, not daring to let go the  steering wheel, for fear the ship would encounter a treacherous current  and tilt. \"Hurry to Mr. Damon!\"    \"What's the matter?\" asked the balloonist.    \"He's dead--or unconscious--hanging over the railing. He seems to be  slipping! Hurry, or it will be too late!\"          Chapter 14    Andy Gives The Clue      When Mr. Swift followed the chief of police and the constable to the  town hall his mind was filled with many thoughts. All his plans for  revolutionizing submarine travel, were, of course, forgotten, and he  was only concerned with the charge that had been made against his son.  It seemed incredible, yet the officers were not ones to perpetrate a  joke. The chief and constable had driven from town in a carriage, and  they now invited the inventor to ride back with them.    \"Do you mean to tell me a warrant has actually been sworn out against  my son, Chief?\" asked the father, when they were near the town hall.    \"That's just what I mean to say, Mr. Swift, and, I'm sorry, on your  account, that I have to serve it.\"    \"Hub! Don't look like you was goin' to serve it,\" remarked the  constable. \"He's skipped out.\"    \"That's all right, Higby,\" went on the chief. \"I'll catch em both.  Even if they have escaped in an airship with their booty, I'll nab 'em.  I'll have a general alarm out all over the country in less than an  hour. They can't stay up in the air forever.\"    \"A warrant for Tom--my son,\" murmured Mr. Swift, as if he could not  believe it.    \"Yes, and for that Damon man, too,\" added the chief. \"I want him as  well as Tom, and I'll get 'em.\"    \"Would you mind letting me see the warrants?\" asked the inventor, and  the official passed them over. The documents were made out in regular  form, and the complaints had been sworn to by Isaac Pendergast, the  bank president.    \"I can't understand it,\" went on Tom's father. \"Seventy-five thousand  dollars. It's incredible! Why!\" he suddenly exclaimed, \"it can't be  true. Just before he left, Mr. Damon--\"    \"Yes, what did he do?\" asked the chief eagerly, thinking he might  secure some valuable evidence.    \"I guess I'll say nothing until I have seen the bank president,\"  replied Mr. Swift, and the official was obviously disappointed.    The inventor found Mr. Pendergast, and some other bank officials in the  town hall. The financiers were rather angry when they learned that the  accused persons had not been caught, but the chief said he would soon  have them in custody.    \"In the meanwhile will you kindly explain, what this means?\" asked Mr.  Swift of the president.    \"You may come and look at the looted vault, if you like, Mr. Swift,\"  replied Mr. Pendergast. \"It was a very thorough job, and will seriously  cripple the bank.\"    There was no doubt that the vault had been forced open, for the locks  and bars were bent and twisted as if by heavy tools. Mr. Swift made a  careful examination, and was shown the money drawers that had been  smashed.    \"This was the work of experts,\" he declared.    \"Exactly what we think,\" said the president. \"Of course we don't  believe your son was a professional bank robber, Mr. Swift. We have a  theory that Mr. Damon did the real work, but that Tom helped him with  the tools he had. There is no doubt about it.\"    \"What right have you to accuse my son?\" burst out the aged inventor.  \"Why have you any more cause to suspect him than any other lad in town?  Why do you fix on him, and Mr. Damon? I demand to know.\"    \"Mr. Damon's eccentric actions for a few days past, and his well-known  oddity of character make him an object of suspicion,\" declared the  president in judicial tones. \"As for Tom, we have, I regret to say,  even better evidence against him.\"    \"But what is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3008"],[0,"The Jargon File, Version 4.2.2, 20 Aug 2000 (#14)"],[1,"`nagware')     The requests generally require user action to acknowledge the message     before normal operation is resumed and are often tied to the most     frequently used features of the software.

This comes from the ANSI.SYS device driver that must     be loaded on an MS-DOS computer to view such codes. Unfortunately,     neither DOS ANSI nor the BBS ANSIs derived from it exactly match the     ANSI X.364 terminal standard. For example, the ESC-[1m code turns on     the bold highlight on large machines, but in IBM PC/MS-DOS ANSI, it     turns on `intense' (bright) colors. Also, in BBS-land, the term `ANSI'     is often used to imply that a particular computer uses or can emulate     the IBM high-half character set from MS-DOS. Particular use depends on     context. Occasionally, the vanilla ASCII character set is used with     the color codes, but on BBSs, ANSI and `IBM characters' tend to go     together.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:ANSI standard, Next:[561]ANSI standard pizza, Previous:[562]ANSI,     Up:[563]= A =       ANSI standard /an'see stan'd*rd/       The ANSI standard usage of `ANSI standard' refers to any practice     which is typical or broadly done.

[acronym, `Automated Retroactive Minimal Moderation'] A Usenet     [596]cancelbot created by Dick Depew of Munroe Falls, Ohio. ARMM was     intended to automatically cancel posts from anonymous-posting sites.     Unfortunately, the robot's recognizer for anonymous postings triggered     on its own automatically-generated control messages! Transformed by     this stroke of programming ineptitude into a monster of     Frankensteinian proportions, it broke loose on the night of March 31,     1993 and proceeded to [597]spam news.admin.policy with a recursive     explosion of over 200 messages.       ARMM's bug produced a recursive [598]cascade of messages each of which     mechanically added text to the ID and Subject and some other headers     of its parent. This produced a flood of messages in which each header     took up several screens and each message ID and subject line got     longer and longer and longer.       Reactions varied from amusement to outrage. The pathological messages     crashed at least one mail system, and upset people paying line charges     for their Usenet feeds. One poster described the ARMM debacle as     \"instant Usenet history\" (also establishing the term [599]despew), and     it has since been widely cited as a cautionary example of the havoc     the combination of good intentions and incompetence can wreak on a     network.
