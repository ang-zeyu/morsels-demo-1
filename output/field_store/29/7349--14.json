Some especially skilled operators may also secure  considerably better average results than this. It is quite a common  practice on the part of duck farmers to pay their incubator man a bonus  on all ducklings over 40% hatched during the season. This bonus may  range anywhere from $1 to $5 per thousand ducklings. Such an arrangement  serves to give the incubator man a greater incentive to give the  machines good attention and to secure just the best results of which he  is capable.    _Selling Baby Ducks._ Within the last two or three years there has  sprung into existence a small but increasing trade in baby ducks. They  are handled and shipped about the same as baby chicks. Baby ducks are  ready for shipment as soon as they are thoroughly dry, usually about 12  hours after the hatch starts to come off. They are neither fed nor  watered before shipment and are packed in cardboard boxes used in  shipping baby chicks. As a rule the shipping boxes will accommodate  about half the number of ducklings that they will chicks. Of course the  outside temperature very largely governs the matter of the number to a  compartment. In warm summer weather, a two compartment box intended for  50 chicks will accommodate 26 ducklings if well ventilated at the sides  and top. They are shipped by parcel post and can be sent anywhere within  a radius of one thousand miles if the trip does not require more than 36  hours. For best results the ducklings should not be allowed to go much  beyond this length of time before they are fed. On receipt they should  be placed immediately in a brooder already prepared for them.          CHAPTER VI    Commercial Duck Farming--Brooding and Rearing the Young Stock      Young ducks are easier to brood than chicks. They seem to learn more  quickly where the source of heat is and they are less likely to cause  trouble from crowding. They are also less subject to disease.    _Removing the Newly Hatched Ducklings to the Brooder House._ The  ducklings should be left in the incubator until they are thoroughly  dried off. Usually they will be dried so that they can be moved on the  afternoon of the 28th day of incubation. If, however, they are not ready  early in the afternoon it is best to leave them in the machine until the  next morning. In moving the ducklings, place them in boxes, baskets or  other suitable carriers and cover them with burlap or cloth to avoid any  danger of the ducklings becoming chilled.    _Brooder Houses Repaired._ There are many different types and styles of  brooder houses which are used with success. For this reason only one  type of each class of brooder house needed is described in detail. These  particular houses have been in successful use for a considerable period  of time and are given because they embody all the necessary requisites  for such houses and at the same time utilize the space to good advantage  and are economical in construction.    In general there are required three different brooder houses. The first  of these requires sufficient heating capacity so that the temperature of  the house itself can be maintained at 65 to 70 degrees even in the cold  weather of winter or early spring. In addition, hovers are required in  this house under which a temperature can be maintained from 80 to 90  degrees. For convenience this house will be spoken of as brooder house  No. 1. A second brooder house which can be called brooder house No. 2  will be required which is equipped with heating apparatus so that the  temperature can be run up to 60 degrees when required. The third brooder  house known as brooder house No. 3 is a cold brooder house or one  without artificial heat. It furnishes shelter for the young ducks where  they can be driven in at night and during the day in cold weather. As  the ducklings pass out of the brooder house No. 3 they are housed in  sheds or shelters with yards which usually extend into the water but  which may not do so in all cases.      Brooder House No. 1    The length of this house determines its capacity, the required amount of  which will depend upon the output of any particular plant. There should  be brooder capacity in this house sufficient to care for approximately  1/4 of the total output for the year at one time.    _Construction of House._ A suitable house which has been in practical  use for some time consists of one 20 feet wide and running east and west  with windows in the south or front side. If the location were right such  a house could be run north and south to good advantage and should then  have windows on each side so as to let in the sunlight from both  directions. The front wall of this house is 7 feet high, the back wall 4  feet. The ridge of the house is about 2 feet in front of the center, the  front slope of the roof having an eight inch pitch while the back slope  has a 6 inch pitch. The roof rafters are 2 x 4's placed every two feet.  The studs and plates are likewise 2 x 4. The walls are made of matched  material. The roof is constructed of 1 x 2 inch strips placed every 4  inches and these covered with shingles. Tie beams every 8 feet extend  from front to rear plates. This particular brooder house is not ceiled  but a good tight ceiling 8 feet above the walk or runway would make it  easier to keep the house clean and would also render it somewhat easier  in cold weather to maintain the temperature desired. The house is built  on a concrete wall or foundation and a dirt floor is used but the dirt  must be filled in well above the level of the ground outside so that  there is no danger of water coming into the house or the floors becoming  damp or sloppy. Windows are placed in the front wall, one to each pen.  In every other pen there is a small door in the back of the house to  facilitate cleaning out the pens. A window can be substituted for this  door to good advantage as it makes the house lighter.    [Illustration: FIG. 23. Interior of No. 1 brooder house showing walk and  hover combined in the middle of the house and pens on each side.  (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of  Agriculture._)]    _Heating Apparatus._ Heat is furnished by means of a coal burning stove  which heats water and causes it to circulate through pipes run the  length of the house. The heater must always be placed in the windward  end of the building as otherwise it is hard to get the heat down to the  other end as the wind tends to drive it back. The hot water pipes are  carried down the center of the house and the return pipes are located in  the same place. A low partition is run lengthwise of the house dividing  the pipes and thus forming double pens, half extending from the center  to the front and half from the center to the rear of the house. The  pipes and the partition between them is covered over with boards making  a 4 foot walk or runway directly over the pipes, which comes into most  convenient use as a place to convey, by means of a wheelbarrow, feed or  other material needed in the house, and as a convenient place from which  to care for the ducklings in the pens on each side. This board covering  over the pipes also serves to hold the heat and thus forms hovers.    It is advisable to partition off the first third of the house, that is,  the portion in which the heater is located, with a solid partition. Then  by having suitable valves in the pipes, the heat can be cut off from  the rest of the house and only the smaller partitioned off end used as a  separate and independent section of the brooder. This is especially  useful when only a small number of ducklings are being hatched early in  the spring when the weather is cold and it may be difficult to heat the  whole building properly. It is also economical in fuel under such  conditions.    If, on the other hand, the number of ducklings hatched during the cold  weather is so large that all or nearly all of the house capacity is  needed to care for them, it will usually pay to install an additional  heater, the pipes from which can be run along the rear wall of the  building, in order to keep up a proper house temperature when the  weather is severe.    _Pens._ Having the hovers in the center of the house, makes it possible  to have double sets of pens, one running from the center to the front  wall and the other from the center to the rear wall. The pens are  divided off by means of partitions made of one foot boards. These are  high enough to confine the ducklings to their own pen and at the same  time are easy to step over. In a house of this width, 20 feet, with 4  feet in the center taken up by the double hovers or walk, each pen is 8  feet long in the clear or 10 feet to the partition under the hover. The  pens in the first third of the house are made 5 feet wide, in the next  third 6 feet and in the last third 7 feet wide. When the ducklings are  first brought from the incubator cellar they are placed in the pens  nearest the heater as the temperature will run somewhat higher there  than in the portions of the house more remote from the heater. These 5 x  10 foot pens will accommodate 125 baby ducklings although better results  will be obtained by placing only 100 in a pen if sufficient room is  available. Some duck growers use boards which can be slipped into slots  made of cleats nailed to the pen partitions at different distances from  the hover and which serve to confine the baby ducklings close to the  hover for the first few days or until they learn to go under the hover  to get warm.    As additional ducklings are hatched later and brought to the brooder  house, the ducklings already there are moved along the necessary number  of pens in order to accommodate the new-comers in the pens nearest the  heater. For this purpose, a small door is made in each partition next  the outside wall of the house through which the ducklings can be driven.

I saw this species only on August 11, 1962, when a flock of eight       was seen feeding in a cocoa tree.         The female is somewhat darker than comparative material from       Borneo, possibly owing to fresh plumage in my specimen and foxing       in the older comparative material.    _=Pericrocotus flammeus insulanus=_ Deignan: Scarlet  Minivet.--_Specimens_, 5: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 2 x 1  mm., 20.0 gm., July 7, 1962, MCT 2608; [Female], 19.7 gm., August 4,  1962, MCT 2728; [Male], 19.0 gm., August 23, 1962, MCT 2802.

It was       aberrant; the two outer tail feathers were white and it had a few       white under tail coverts.    _=Pycnonotus squamatus borneensis=_ Chasen: Scaly-breasted  Bulbul.--_Specimens_, 2: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] 24.0 gm.,  August 2, 1962, MCT 2708; [Male] testis 4 x 3 mm., 22.2 gm., August 23,  1962, MCT 2802.         Both specimens were taken from a feeding tree, _Trema orientalis_,       in which they were eating berries. This species of tree was used       for shade in the cocoa.    _=Pycnonotus cyaniventris paroticalis=_ (Sharpe): Gray-bellied  Bulbul.--_Specimens_, 2: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] largest ovum 2  mm., 21.6 gm., August 25, 1962, MCT 2808; [Male] testis 7 x 4 mm., 20.5  gm., September 13, 1962, MCT 2916.         On August 23, 1962, I saw four in the cocoa but they took flight       into the forest. I later collected two specimens from a shade tree,       _Trema orientalis_, in which they were feeding upon the berries.    _=Pycnonotus atriceps atriceps=_ (Temminck): Black-headed  Bulbul.--_Specimens_, 9: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], April 29,  1963, ADG 85; [Female], April 27, 1963, ADG 72; [Female], April 20,  1963, ADG 90; [Male], April 27, 1963, ADG 69; [Male], April 28, 1963,  ADG 79; [Male], April 26, 1963, ADG 61; [Male], April 28, 1963, ADG 81;  [Male] juv., April 28, 1963, ADG 82; [Male], May 1, 1963, ADG 97.         I did not see this species in my stay at the Cocoa Research       Station, and the specimens taken by Garcia constitute the only       record. The juvenal plumage in one specimen indicates that the       species breeds at Quoin Hill.    _=Pycnonotus zeylanicus=_ (Gmelin): Yellow-crowned Bulbul.--It was  common at Tuaran.    _=Pycnonotus goiavier gourdini=_ Gray 1847: Yellow-vented  Bulbul.--_Specimens_, 17: Tenom: [Female], December 31, 1962, MCT 3547;  [Male] testis 9 x 6 mm., December 31, 1962, MCT 3548; [Female] oviduct  regressing, old brood patch, December 31, 1962, MCT 3549; [Male],  December 31, 1962, MCT 3550; [Female] oviduct nearly regressed, January  1, 1963, MCT 3556; [Female], January 1, 1963, MCT 3557; [Male] testis 9  x 7 mm., December 31, 1963, MCT 3558; [Male] testis enlarged, January 1,  1963, MCT 3559; [Female], January 1, 1963, MCT 3560; [Male], January 2,  1963, MCT 3562; [Female], January 2, 1963, MCT 3566; [Male], January 2,  1963, MCT 3567; [Male] testis 9 x 7 mm., January 2, 1963, MCT 3568;  [Male], January 2, 1963, MCT 3569; [Female], January 2, 1963, MCT 3570;  [Female], January 2, 1963, MCT 3571; [Male] testis 9 x 7 mm., January 2,  1963, MCT 3572.         Although this species was observed by me at the Cocoa Research       Station, I was unable to obtain any specimens. It was also seen       commonly at Semporna, Siamil Island, Kalabakan, Brantian Estate,       and at Tuaran, always associated with cultivated areas. The birds       obviously were breeding at Tenom in December, and several young       were taken. In some, the molt of the wings, body, and tail had       begun.    _=Pycnonotus plumosus hutzi=_ Stresemann: Large Olive  Bulbul.--_Specimens_, 8: Tenom: [Female], December 31, 1962, MCT 3551;  [Male] testis 6 x 5 mm., January 1, 1963, MCT 3553; [Male] testis small,  January 1, 1963, MCT 3554; [Male] testis 6 x 4 mm., January 4, 1963, MCT  3577; [Male] testis 5 x 4 mm., January 4, 1963, MCT 3578.
