Chloroform acts much as ether does. When  killed, I strongly recommend collectors to pin their specimens through the  thorax with a very fine pin (those used for micro-lepidoptera are the  best), and then to pin this through a narrow strip of card, mounted on a  long stout pin; in this way the insect can be moved about by the strong  pin, and the thorax of the insect itself is not destroyed, as it often is  in the case of the smaller species by the use of thicker pins. The cards  should be cut as small as possible; they need not be more than a quarter of  an inch long. The insect {118} should be pinned at right angles to the long  axis of the card, and the long pin should be inserted on the right-hand  side of the insect so as not quite to touch it. In this way the insects  look quite as neat as if they were pinned direct. Locality labels, etc.,  should be affixed to the long pin, and the insects should be stored in  cabinets or boxes.           *       *       *       *       *    {119}    ON COLOUR    There is but little tendency towards brilliant coloration amongst our  native aculeates. No doubt our comparatively high latitude accounts for  this to some extent, as also the fact that the aculeates do not, as a rule,  elsewhere assume great brilliancy. Even in the tropics and other warm  regions, where bright green, blue or coppery coloured species occur, they  are comparatively few in number. In this country metallic colours are to be  found in less than a dozen species, and in most of these it exists only as  a tinge. Amongst our ants and wasps it does not exist at all, unless the  slight bronziness of the typical form of _Formica fusca_ be so considered.  The fossors can exhibit only a bluish tint in _Mutilla Europaea_ (pl. A, 4,  5), and a slight bronzy tinge in two of quite the smallest species,  _Miscophus maritimus_ and the [male] of _Crabro albilabris_. The bees can  do a little better; five species of _Halictus_ have a distinctly {120}  bronzy head and thorax, and in three the bronzy colour extends to the  abdomen; there is also another with a very dull green tinge on the thorax;  besides these there is a little bright blue bee, _Ceratina_ (unfortunately  a great rarity in this country) and two or three species of _Osmia_,  showing more or less tendency to bronziness, and one which is distinctly  bluish; but, considering our indigenous species number nearly 400, this is  a very small, and compared with other countries I should think an  abnormally small, proportion.    Species with bodies banded like a wasp's are much more abundant--no less  than eighty of our native kinds having this style of coloration. The bands  may be reduced to lateral spots, but such cases, I think, are only  modifications of the banded scheme.    Black species with a more or less pronounced red band across the body  number about seventy, and a general testaceous or yellowish colour occurs  in a few ants, but not elsewhere among the British aculeates. Nearly all  the rest are black or dark brown so far as the actual surface of the body  is concerned; but amongst the bees {121} there is often a dense clothing of  coloured hairs sometimes so dense that the surface of the body may be  rendered invisible. These coloured hairs may be distributed into brilliant  bands, as in the humble bees, or they may be uniformly black, as in some of  their varieties and in the females of the spring species of _Anthophora_  (pl. D, 25), or entirely red as in _Andrena fulva_ (pl. B, 16), or black on  the thorax and red on the abdomen as in _Osmia bicolor_ (pl. D, 28), or  vice versa as in _Andrena thoracica_, etc., but the most usual condition is  that where the hairs form more or less pale bands along the joints of the  segments, either immediately above or below them or both; sometimes these  bands are very obscurely indicated, and visible only in certain positions.  At others they are vividly white; to a certain extent this banded condition  recalls the waspy coloration. The hairs, however, of the bands are rarely  yellow, but as a rule greyish or white, or of a grade of colour slightly  paler than those of the disc. There are some rather interesting points  which arise out of this rough analysis. Among the bees, all the species  which have a waspy coloration are cuckoos, with only one exception  (_Anthidium_) {122} (pl. D, 27), as are also nearly all those which have  red bands. With the exception of the males of three species of _Halictus_,  and both sexes of three or four species of _Andrena_, all the red-banded  forms belong to the genus _Sphecodes_ (pl. B, 11), which is a cuckoo genus.  The red coloration occurs chiefly on nearly naked surfaces; this is  specially noticeable in those bees which have two varieties, such as  _Andrena rosae_, one dull coloured and the other red-banded: in these cases  the dull form is hairy and the red nearly naked. The greatest proportionate  number of banded species occurs amongst the fossors, and these are seldom  clothed with hairs to any extent. These bands seem to me probably to depend  a good deal on retarded development. Dark and hairy bands, both as a rule,  follow the joints of the segments, as stated above. I only say as a rule,  as there are many where the banding does not follow this principle, but in  far the larger majority the bands, whether of dark colour or hairs, are  apical. As the segments overlap at the joints it is evident that their  discs would tend to mature more rapidly than the overlapping bases and  apices, {123} and the longer period spent in hardening and drying of the  overlapping parts would favour the development of dark pigment and of  hairs. Many species have the extreme apices of the segments pale, but with  the apical integument so very thin, often looking nearly transparent and  membranous, that its development would be very rapid. Again, in the case of  red coloration, the red generally occurs on the discs of the segments, the  apices and sides often being dark, and in cases where in one species both  black and banded forms occur, with intermediate varieties, the last remnant  of red colour is generally situated in the centre of the segment. By far  the gayest effect is displayed by our humble bees, and, but for them and a  few of the species of _Andrena_ and the wasp-coloured species, our  aculeates would be a very sombre lot.           *       *       *       *       *    {124}    THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSECTS FROM THE EGG    Although this and the following chapter may not be interesting to all my  readers, I think it is only right to add some remarks on the structure and  classification of insects, so that any one who wishes to follow up the  subject may gather a few general ideas which may induce them to take up  some technical and scientific work in which they will get fuller and more  exact data on the difficulties which are involved in such simple questions  as \"What is an insect?\" \"How are the different orders of insects  distinguished from each other?\" \"What is a species?\" etc.    To realize the characters of an insect in its perfect or \"imago\" state, we  may for the moment forget what often seems to be its most important  features, and which are frequently its most extensive parts, viz. its limbs  or {125} appendages; by limbs are meant its wings, legs, horns or antennae,  jaws or mandibles, etc.: strip these all off, and we have a limbless trunk,  which many would not recognize as belonging to an insect at all; still this  limbless trunk possesses characters which assert its insect nature, as it  may be known from other limbless trunks by being divided into three parts  by two great transverse divisions; in most insects these are extremely well  marked, and in all they have a very real existence. The parts thus divided  off are known by the names of head, thorax, and abdomen. Anybody knows how  easy it is to break off the head or body of a dried insect. Now the head or  body breaks off at one of these divisions, and it is this partitioning of  the body into three sections which makes one of the strongest characters in  the definition of an insect. The three parts, thus divided off, each  possesses special functions in the life of the creature. In the head are  contained the principal organs of sense and brain; in the thorax, the  organs of locomotion; and in the body those of digestion, reproduction,  etc.    This division into three parts does not however {126} always hold good in  the early stages of the insect's life, and we must remember that the  creature commences life on leaving the egg, and not merely on its emergence  from the chrysalis, so that we have to reckon with caterpillars, grubs and  all sorts of curious immature forms in our conceptions of an insect.    These early stages do not as a rule interest the public much, but it is  well to bear in mind that the \"perfect insect\" stage is reached by some  insects along apparently a very different road from that travelled by  others. Some leave the egg as caterpillars or grubs, and after various  changes of skin become apparently lifeless chrysalids, from which they  emerge as perfect insects. Others leave the egg as diminutive likenesses of  their parents, and run or hop about much as they do, attaining the perfect  insect stage simply by a series of changes of skin, without any definite  quiescent or chrysalis condition.    The observation, therefore, which one often hears that insects never grow,  has to be taken with caution; all insects grow in their early stages, but  it is an obvious truth that insects do not {127} grow after they attain the  imago or \"perfect insect\" condition. A small fly will never become a large  fly, nor a small beetle a large beetle. This is only because we do not  recognize their caterpillars or grubs as flies and beetles; but a  grasshopper "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33914"],[0,"Myology and Serology of the Avian Family Fringillidae: A Taxonomic Study (#14)"],[1,"s.
