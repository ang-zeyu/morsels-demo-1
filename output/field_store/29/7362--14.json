[Illustration: FIG. 39.]    The standard scale to be copied, _A_, which may in this case be another  graduated tube, or even a paper scale, and the object to be ruled, _B_,  are securely fixed, end to end, a little distance apart, in a groove  made in a board or in the top of a table. A stiff bar of wood, _C_, has  a point fixed at _D_, and a knife edge at _E_, _D_ is placed in any  division of _A_, _C_ is held firmly at _E_ and _D_, and a cut is made by  the knife through the wax on _B_, the point _D_ is then moved into the  next division, and the operation is repeated. To regulate the length and  position of the cuts, _B_ is usually held in position by two sheets of  brass projecting over the edges of the groove in which it lies; the  metal sheets have notches cut into them at the intervals at which longer  marks are to be made.    When the scale is completed, the equality of the divisions in various  parts of it may be, to some extent, verified as follows:--Adjust a  compass so that its points fall into two divisions 5, 10, or 20 mm.  apart. Then apply the points of the compass to various parts of the  scale. In every part the length of a given number of divisions should be  exactly the same. The individual divisions should also be carefully  inspected by the eye; they should be sensibly equal. If badly ruled,  long and short divisions will be found on the scale. Very often a long  and a short division will be adjacent, and will be the more easily  observed in consequence.    =To Divide a Given Line into Equal Parts.=--Occasionally it is necessary  to divide a line of given length into _x_ equal parts. For instance, to  divide the stem of a thermometer from the freezing-point to the  boiling-point into one hundred degrees.    The following outline will explain how a line may be so divided. Suppose  the line _AB_ (Fig. 40) is to be divided into nine equal parts. Adjust a  hinged rule so that the points _A_ and _B_ coincide with the inside  edges of the limbs, one of them, _A_, being at the ninth division  (_e.g._ the ninth inch) of _CE_. Then if lines parallel to _ED_ be drawn  from each division of the scale to meet _AB_, _AB_ will be divided into  nine equal parts.    [Illustration: FIG. 40.]    A very convenient and simple arrangement on this principle for dividing  a line into any number of equal parts with considerable accuracy, is  described by Miss S. Marks in the _Proceedings of the Physical Society_,  July 1885.[20] One limb of a hinged rule _D_ is made to slide upon a  plain rule fixed to it; the plain rule carries needles on its under  surface which hold the paper in position. The position of the divided  rule and line to be divided being adjusted, the hinged rule is gently  pushed forwards, as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 40, till division  eight coincides with the line _AB_. A mark is made at the point of  coincidence, and division seven on the scale is similarly brought to the  line _AB_, and so on. The inner edge of _EC_ should have the divisions  marked upon it, that their coincidence with _AB_ maybe more accurately  noted. The joint _E_ must be a very stiff one.    [20] Since this was printed I have observed that the above method is not  identical with that described by Miss Marks, but for ordinary purposes I  do not think it will be found to be inferior.    A line drawn of given length or a piece of paper may be divided into any  given number of equal parts, and will then serve as the scale _A_ of  Fig. 39, p. 74, the thermometer or other object to be graduated taking  the place of _B_.    Scales carefully divided according to any of the methods described will  be fairly accurate _if trustworthy instruments have been employed as  standards_.    It will be found possible when observing the volume of a gas over  mercury, or the height of a column of mercury in a tube, to measure  differences of one-sixth to one-eighth of a millimetre with a  considerable degree of accuracy. To obtain more delicate measurements a  vernier[21] must be employed.    [21] For the nature and use of the vernier, a treatise on Physics or  Physical Measurements may be consulted.    =To Calibrate Apparatus.=--The glass tubes of which graduated apparatus  is made are, as already stated, very rarely truly cylindrical  throughout their entire lengths. It follows that the capacities of equal  lengths of a tube will usually be unequal, and therefore it is necessary  to ascertain by experiment the true values of equal linear divisions of  a tube at various parts of it.    A burette may be calibrated by filling it with distilled water, drawing  off portions, say of 5 c.c. in succession, into a weighing bottle of  known weight, and weighing them.    Great care must be taken in reading the level of the liquid at each  observation. The best plan is to hold a piece of white paper behind the  burette, and to read from the lower edge of the black line that will be  seen. Each operation should be repeated two or three times, and the mean  of the results, which should differ but slightly, may be taken as the  value of the portion of the tube under examination.    If the weights of water delivered from equal divisions of the tube are  found to be equal, the burette is an accurate one, but if, as is more  likely, different values are obtained, a table of results should be  drawn up in the laboratory book showing the volume of liquid delivered  from each portion of the tube examined. And subsequently when the  burette is used, the volumes read from the scale on the burette must be  corrected. Suppose, for example, that a burette delivered the following  weights of water from each division of 5 c.c. respectively:--         C.C.        Grams.       0 to  5  gave  4.90     5 \"  10   \"    4.91    10 \"  15   \"    4.92    15 \"  20   \"    4.93    20 \"  25   \"    4.94    25 \"  30   \"    4.95    30 \"  35   \"    4.96    35 \"  40   \"    4.97    40 \"  45   \"    4.98    45 \"  50   \"    4.99    and that in two experiments 20 c.c. and 45 c.c. respectively of a liquid  re-agent were employed. The true volumes calculated from the table would  be as 19.66 to 44.46.    If the temperature remained constant throughout the above series of  experiments, and if the temperature selected were 4 deg. C., the weights of  water found, taken in grams, give the volumes in cubic centimetres, for  one gram of water at 4 deg. C. has a volume of one cubic centimetre. If the  temperature at which the experiments were made was other than 4 deg. C., and  if great accuracy be desired, a table of densities must be consulted,  with the help of which the volume of any weight of water at a known  temperature can be readily calculated.    Pipettes which are to be used as measuring instruments should also have  the relation one to another of the volumes of liquid which they deliver  determined, and also the proportions these bear to the values found for  the divisions of the burettes in conjunction with which they will be  employed.      =To Calibrate Tubes for Measuring Gases.=--Prepare a small glass tube  sealed at one end and ground at the other to a plate of glass. The tube  should hold about as much mercury as will fill 10 mm. divisions of the  graduated tube. Fill this tube with mercury, removing all bubbles of air  that adhere to the sides by closing the open end of the tube with the  thumb, and washing them away with a large air-bubble left for the  purpose. If any persistently remain, remove them by means of a fine  piece of bone or wood. Then completely fill the tube with mercury,  removing any bubbles that may be introduced in the operation, and remove  the excess of mercury by placing the ground-glass plate on the mouth of  the tube, and pressing it so as to force out all excess of mercury  between the two surfaces. Clean the outside of the tube, and place it on  a small stand (this may be a small wide-mouthed glass bottle), with  which it has been previously weighed when empty, and re-weigh. Repeat  this operation several times. From the mean of the results, which should  differ one from another but very slightly, the capacity of the tube can  be calculated.    The purest mercury obtainable should be used. Since the density of pure  mercury at 0 deg. C. is 13.596, the weight of mercury required to fill the  tube at 0 deg. C., taken in grams, when divided by 13.596, will give the  capacity of the tube at 0 deg. C. in cubic centimetres. If the experiment be  not made at 0 deg. C., and if a very exact determination of the capacity of  the tube be required, the density of mercury must be corrected for  expansion or contraction.    Having now a vessel of known capacity, it can be employed for  ascertaining the capacities of the divisions of a graduated tube in the  following manner:--The graduated tube is fixed perpendicularly, mouth  upwards, in a secure position. The small tube of known capacity is  filled with mercury as previously described, and its contents are  transferred to the divided tube. The number of divisions which the known  volume of mercury occupies is noted after all air-bubbles have been  removed. This process is repeated until the divided tube is filled. A  table of results is prepared, showing the number of divisions occupied  by each known volume of mercury introduced.    In subsequently using the tube the volumes of the gases measured in it  must be ascertained from the table of values thus prepared.    In observing the level of the mercury, unless a cathetometer is  available, a slip of mirror should be held behind the mercury close to  the tube, in such a position that the pupil which is visible on the  looking-glass is divided into two parts by the surface of the mercury.    A correction must be introduced for the error caused by the meniscus of  the mercury. As the closed end of the tube was downwards when each  measured volume of mercury was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33965"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 3, No. 4, July, 1851 (#14)"],[1,"hen'd all their massive roots      Stood the great oak and giant sycamore;      Along the water-courses and the glades      Rose the fair maple and the hickory;      And on the loftier heights the towering pine--      Strong guardians of the forest--standing there,      On the old ramparts, sentinels of time,      To watch the flight of ages.[C]    These verses are pretty, perhaps very pretty. They give nature a  charming appearance,--too much like the \"everlasting spring\" of Ovid. Do  you not seem to lie in the shade of a European forest? Here are the same  trees, the same flowers, the same animals. But the trees are more  abundant of leaves, the grass is thicker, the sun is brighter, the  waters warmer. But there is no profoundly original painting, no broad  description by a few great outlines.    The sentiment of the beautiful and ideal is expressed in this collection  of poetry, in an uncolored, abstract, and metaphysical manner. We are  not sure that all these women love and understand the beautiful arts,  and particularly the plastic arts; the only one whose influence they  feel deeply, and which they seem to prefer, is music. And this  preference among the moderns for music is a curious fact. The  superiority given to it above painting and sculpture may be accounted  for in some degree by the fact that music accords more with woman's  instincts. Music is truly the art of the nineteenth century _par  excellence_; it is the art which expresses best incredible aspirations;  it is an art democratic in its essence. Appreciated by all living  beings, even the unintelligent tribes, to be felt, music demands neither  science nor long study--it makes every one happy, and tells to each the  story of his love.    To produce sculptors, poets, and painters, it is necessary that a  country should boast of many centuries, of a history, of a long  succession of traditions, of established customs; but modern nations,  particularly Americans, outstrip time, act with precipitation, and have  no leisure to wait the traditions of history. Hence this extraordinary  love of music, the least costly of the arts. They love music as one  loves the conversations of the evening, and refreshing sleep after a  hard day's labor. The art of music then is, if we dare say so, the art  of nations who have no time for meditation and reflection--the art of  ardent and feverish nations; for, to be understood, it requires only  that a man should have a soul, with warm desires and hopes. We find in  this collection two sonnets in honor of Beethoven and Mozart, in which  the genius of the two masters is perfectly appreciated and felt. They  are from Margaret Fuller, since Countess d'Ossoli, who was drowned by  shipwreck on her return to her native country.      BEETHOVEN.        Most intellectual master of the art,        Which best of all teaches the mind of man        The universe in all its varied plan--      What strangely mingled thoughts thy strains impart!      Here the faint tenor thrills the inmost heart,        There the rich bass the reason's balance shows;        Here breathes the softest sigh that love e'er knows;      There sudden fancies seeming without chart,        Float into wildest breezy interludes;      The past is all forgot--hopes sweetly breathe,      And our whole being glows--when lo! beneath        The flowery brink, Despair's deep sob concludes!      Startled, we strive to free us from the chain--      Notes of high triumph swell, and we are thine again!      MOZART.        If to the intellect and passions strong        Beethoven speak, with such resistless power,        Making us share the full creative hour,      When his wand fixed wild Fancy's mystic throng,      Oh, Nature's finest lyre! to thee belong        The deepest, softest tones of tenderness,        Whose purity the listening angels bless,      With silvery clearness of seraphic song.      Sad are those chords, oh heavenward striving soul!        A love, which never found its home on earth,        Pensively vibrates, even in thy mirth,      And gentle laws thy slightest notes control;      Yet dear that sadness! spheral concords felt      Purify most those hearts which most they melt.    Of these two sonnets, we prefer that of Mozart, as expressing better, in  our opinion, the character of the music of the great master--as more  discriminating than that of Beethoven--a perfect description besides of  the author of _Fidelio_. The sonnets appear curious to us as sparklings  of aesthetic poetry beyond the seas.    The sentiments of American pride and of national susceptibility vibrate  here and there in all this poetry, but not very often. The remembrance  of the early emigrants, the description of America when inhabited by  savage hordes, and the comparison of this barbaric state with the  industrial wonders of the nineteenth century, are themes somewhat rare,  but which are nevertheless not forgotten. We have also noticed two or  three pieces which brought a smile upon our lips--where the shades of  old Indian sachems appear to bless modern civilization, and seem ready  to thank the Great Spirit for having exterminated their race, despoiled  and chased from their own native woods and prairies. There are besides a  few pieces borrowed from historic subjects, and a few dedicated to  individuals; some pages in honor of Washington and Napoleon, and this is  all. The rest is composed of mere musings, fancies, and elegies,  expressing no precise and distinct sentiment.    But what matters the relative weakness of this poetry? Let us rise to  higher spheres than that purely literary. The moral character and the  virtues which this collection of poetry suggests are superior to the  poetry itself. Who can tell, indeed, the good which may be done by these  musical reveries and innocent caprices? They have been composed in the  bosom of tranquility, by the fireside, among parents, children,  relatives, and friends. These were the public to which they addressed  themselves, who admired them, and drew from them their contributions to  the good and beautiful. Probably many chaste tendernesses are recognized  by the banks of these little limpid fountains of poesy; many hearts have  rejoiced in these tender harmonies; many a man, weary with the labors of  the day, has felt the sweet words of his daughter or his wife thrill his  soul; he has beheld the bright gleams of ideal realities, and laid  himself down and dreamed of images of higher beauty. In that hard,  practical country, many poetic germs have thus taken root, many coarse  natures have become more refined. What matters it, then, whether these  specimens of poetry be original or not?--they have been useful. We offer  our thanks to the female poets of America, for the seeds of piety,  virtue, and nobility sown in their country. Without noise, without  humanitary pretensions, they have fulfilled their mission of religion  and refinement.    FOOTNOTES:    [B] THE FEMALE POETS OF AMERICA: BY RUFUS WILMOT GRISWOLD. Philadelphia,  Henry C. Baird, 1851.    [C] From Nanuntenoo, an Indian Romance. By Frances H. Green.  Philadelphia, 1850.          JEANNE MARIE, AND LYRICAL POETRY IN GERMANY.      We are induced to translate for _The International_ the following  crisply written critique from _Die Grenzboten_, not only from its giving  for the benefit of certain of our _dilettanti_ German scholars a few  judicious remarks on the true merit of their \"new celebrity,\" JEANNE  MARIE, but because the preceding account of the present state of lyrical  poetry in Germany, is very nearly as applicable to lyrical poetry as it  now exists among the rising bards of America and England as to that of  the father-land:    \"It is now about a century since the beginning of our most brilliant  German lyrical era, and we are at the conclusion of a series of  developments, which individually display all of the peculiarities  indicative of the decline of a great epoch in art. The incredible number  of subjects which have been artistically treated, has inspired the minds  of our cotemporaries with an almost superfluity of poetically adapted  figures, forms, tones and materials, with which we are familiar from our  first breath. Vast numbers of corresponding series of similes, and  combinations of words and sentences have been naturalized in our  language, and the spirit of the rising generation cannot be other than  powerfully influenced by the incredible variety of forms and phrases,  which it acquires during education. From all which a limitation of the  creative power naturally results--since there is hardly a sentiment,  hardly a perception of the present day, which has not been rendered  applicable to poetic art; and the array of these imposing creations ring  in the soul of the young poet wonderfully through each other. It is  almost impossible to experience a new feeling which has not been sung,  and yet the impulse still exists to win for the again and again  experienced, a value, and a certain degree of originality. From which  results the most desperate efforts, by means of bold, artificial, highly  polished or tasteless images and comparisons, to form a style and  acquire a peculiar literary physiognomy: efforts which should by no  means be despised, even when the critic is compelled to blame its  results; for it is natural and unavoidable. Such a superabundance of  poetic forms of address, applications, words, and measures, are at  present current in the world, that for every poetic feeling a prosaic or  metrical reminiscence rings and echoes consciously or unconsciously, and  more or less clearly, through the poetic soul. To avoid this wearisome  beaten path, our poets are driven, on the one hand, into unheard of  refinements of metre and words--or on the other, into an affected  barbarism and roughness. And since the quantity of poetic metres,  applications, and forms of speech, has become so incredibly large that  they every"]]]
