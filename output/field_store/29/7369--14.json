FRUITS.--These are produced, in this country, in great abundance, and  are remarkable alike for their variety and delicious flavor; consequently  they are consumed in large quantities, especially during the warmer months.  The moderate use of ripe fruits, in their season, is beneficial, because  they offer a pleasant substitute for the more concentrated diet that is  used in cold weather. The amount of solid nutriment they contain is,  however, small. The percentage of water in cherries is seventy-five, in  grapes eighty-one, in apples eighty-two. Unripe fruits contain starch,  which, during the process of ripening, {74} is converted into sugar. Such  fruits are indigestible and should be avoided: cooking, however, in part  removes the objections to them.    [Sidenote: 30. How should drinking-water be as regards color and smell?  Chemically pure water? How obtained? Agreeableness of perfectly pure  water?]    30. PURE WATER.--It is important that the water we drink and use in the  preparation of food should be pure. It should be clear and colorless, with  little or no taste or smell, and free from any great amount of foreign  ingredients. Chemically pure water does not occur in nature: it is only  obtained by the condensation of steam, carefully conducted, and is not as  agreeable for drinking purposes as the water furnished by springs and  streams. Rain-water is the purest occurring in nature; but even this  contains certain impurities, especially the portion which falls in the  early part of a shower; for in its descent from the clouds, the particles  floating in the air are caught by the falling drops.    [Sidenote: 31. Spring and well water? Whence the sparkle, or life? The  water supply of cities? Croton water? Ridgewood?]    31. Water from springs and wells always contains more or less foreign  matter of mineral origin. This imparts to the drink its pleasant taste--the  sparkle, or \"life,\" coming from the gases absorbed by the water during its  passage under ground. The ordinary supply of cities is from some pure  stream or pond conveyed from a distance through pipes, the limpid fluid  containing generally only a small amount of impurity. Croton water, the  supply of New York City, is very pure, and contains only four and a half  grains to a gallon: the Ridgewood water of Brooklyn holds even less foreign  matter.    [Sidenote: 32. Impurities in drinking-water? Mineral springs?]    32. Drinking-water may contain as large a proportion as sixty to seventy  grains per gallon of impurity, but a much larger quantity renders it  unwholesome. The mineral spring waters, used popularly as medicines, are  highly charged with mineral substances. Some of them, such as {75} the  waters at Saratoga, contain three hundred grains and more to the gallon.    [Sidenote: 33. What is stated of the action of water upon lead?]    33. ACTION OF WATER UPON LEAD.--The danger of using water that has been in  contact with certain metals is well known. Lead is one of the most readily  soluble, and probably the most poisonous of these substances in common use.  When pure water and an untarnished surface of lead come in contact, the  water gradually corrodes the metal, and soon holds an appreciable quantity  of it in solution. When this takes place the water becomes highly  injurious: the purer the water, and the more recent the use of the metal,  the greater will be the danger.    [Sidenote: 34. Lead in pipes and other things? Advice? What takes place  after the articles of lead have been used much? What is wise?]    34. In cities, lead pipes are commonly used to convey water through the  houses; lead being also used in the construction of roofs, cisterns, and  vessels for keeping water and other liquids. After the articles of lead  have been in use several months, the danger of lead-poisoning diminishes.  An insoluble coating of the sulphate of lead forms upon the exposed  surface, thus protecting it from further corrosion. It is, however, a wise  precaution, at all times to reject the water or other fluid that has been  in contact with leaden vessels over night, or for a number of hours. Allow  the water in pipes to run freely before using.    [Sidenote: 35. Coffee as an article of diet? Of what does it consist? How  does the water affect the coffee? The peculiar stimulant? How does it  affect most persons?]    35. COFFEE.--This is an important addition to diet, and if moderately used  is beneficial to persons of adult age. As commonly employed, it consists of  an infusion in boiling water of the roasted and ground berry. The water  extracts certain flavoring and coloring matters, but that which gives it  its peculiar stimulant qualities is the alkaloid _caffein_. With most  persons its action is that of a gentle stimulant, without any injurious  reaction. It produces a restful feeling after exhausting efforts of mind or  {76} body; it tranquilizes, but does not disqualify for labor; and hence it  is highly esteemed by persons of literary pursuits.    [Sidenote: 36. Another property of coffee? Miners of Belgium? The Caravans?  Among armies? Taken with meals?]    36. Another property of coffee is, that it diminishes the waste of the  tissues, and consequently permits the performance of excessive labor upon  an economical and inadequate diet. This has been tested among the miners of  Belgium. Their allowance of solid food was below that found necessary in  prisons and elsewhere; but, with the addition of about four pints of coffee  daily, they were enabled to undergo severe labor without reducing their  muscular strength. The caravans which traverse the deserts are supported by  coffee during long journeys and lengthened privation of food. Among armies  it is indispensable in supplementing their imperfect rations, and in  relieving the sense of fatigue after great exposure and long marches. When  taken with meals, coffee is also thought to promote digestion.    [Sidenote: 37. Effects of tea-drinking? Peculiar principle? The tea  beverage, how made? Black and green tea? Excessive use of tea or coffee?]    37. TEA.--The effects of tea-drinking are very similar to those of coffee,  and are due to a peculiar principle called _thein_. This principle is  probably the same as that found in coffee, _caffein_, since the chemical  composition of both is precisely alike. Tea, as a beverage, is made from  the dried leaves of the plant by the addition of hot water; if the tea is  boiled, the oil which gives it its agreeable flavor is driven off with the  steam. There are two kinds of tea--the black and the green: the latter is  sometimes injurious, producing wakefulness and other nervous symptoms. The  excessive use of either coffee or tea will cause wakefulness.    [Sidenote: 38. Experiments made during Kane's expedition?]    38. During Dr. Kane's expedition in the Arctic regions, the effects of  these articles were compared. \"After {77} repeated trials, the men took  most kindly to coffee in the morning and tea in the evening. The coffee  seemed to continue its influence throughout the day, and they seemed to  grow hungry less rapidly than after drinking tea, while tea soothed them  after a day's hard labor, and the better enabled them to sleep. They both  operated upon fatigued men like a charm, and their superiority over  alcoholic stimulants was very decided.\"    [Sidenote: 39. State what is said of chocolate.]    39. Chocolate is made from the seeds of the cocoa-tree, a native of  tropical America. Its effects resemble somewhat those of tea and coffee,  but it is very rich in nutriment. Linnaeus, the botanist, was so fond of  this beverage, that he gave to the cocoa-tree the name, _Theobroma_--\"the  Food of the Gods.\" Its active principle is _theobromin_.    [Sidenote: 40. Use of alcoholic drinks, how general? The rule given?]    40. ALCOHOL.--The list of beverages that are consumed for the sake of the  alcohol they contain is a very long one. Their use is almost universally  prevalent, every civilized nation, and nearly every barbarous one, having  its favorite alcoholic drink; and, as a general rule, the nations which  stand the highest in civilization have the greatest varieties of these  beverages,--at the same time using them the most intelligently and wisely.    [Sidenote: 41. The beverages produced by fermentation? The ardent spirits?  Grains and fruits employed? Long use of wine? Of distilled liquors?]    41. The wines and malt liquors that contain a small amount of alcohol are  produced by fermentation. The beverages that hold a large proportion of  alcohol, the \"ardent spirits,\" are made by distillation. Enormous  quantities of grains and fruits are thus yearly diverted from their proper  uses as food; some of these being corn, wheat, rye, barley, potatoes, and  rice; also the grape, apple, pear, peach, sugar-cane, cherry, fig, and  orange. Wine, the fermented juice of the grape, has been in use from time  immemorial, while the introduction of distilled liquors dates from a  comparatively recent period. {78}    [Sidenote: 42. Describe the action of alcohol upon the human system?  Experience of Dr. Hayes and others?]    42. What is the physiological action of alcohol? Its first and most evident  action is stimulation: this effect is transient, and is followed by a  variable degree of depression. At first it sharpens the appetite and  quickens digestion, but its habitual use impairs both. This stimulation is  efficient in giving the system an artificial strength during some temporary  derangement, and in enabling the endurance of unusual fatigue or exposure.  The experience of Dr. Hayes, and other explorers of the polar regions, is  that alcohol does not enable the body to resist the influence of cold, but,  on the contrary, is always injurious.

I did not know my maternal grandfather. This venerable ancestor was, I  have been told, a process server in one of the poorest parishes of the  Rouergue. He used to engross on stamped paper in a primitive spelling.  With his well-filled pen case and ink horn, he went drawing out deeds up  hill and down dale, from one insolvent wretch to another more insolvent  still. Amid his atmosphere of pettifoggery, this rudimentary scholar,  waging battle on life's acerbities, certainly paid no attention to the  insect; at most, if he met it, he would crush it under foot. The  unknown animal, suspected of evil doing, deserved no further enquiry.  Grandmother, on her side, apart from her housekeeping and her beads,  knew still less about anything. She looked on the alphabet as a set of  hieroglyphics only fit to spoil your sight for nothing, unless you were  scribbling on paper bearing the government stamp. Who in the world, in  her day, among the small folk, dreamt of knowing how to read and write?  That luxury was reserved for the attorney, who himself made but a  sparing use of it. The insect, I need hardly say, was the least of her  cares. If sometimes, when rinsing her salad at the tap, she found a  caterpillar on the lettuce leaves, with a start of fright she would  fling the loathsome thing away, thus cutting short relations reputed  dangerous. In short, to both my maternal grandparents, the insect was a  creature of no interest whatever and almost always a repulsive object,  which one dared not touch with the tip of one's finger. Beyond a doubt,  my taste for animals was not derived from them.    I have more precise information regarding my grandparents on the  father's side, for their green old age allowed me to know them both.  They were people of the soil, whose quarrel with the alphabet was so  great that they had never opened a book in their lives; and they kept  a lean farm on the cold granite ridge of the Rouergue tableland. The  house, standing alone among the heath and broom, with no neighbor for  many a mile around and visited at intervals by the wolves, was to them  the hub of the universe. But for a few surrounding villages, whither the  calves were driven on fair days, the rest was only very vaguely known  by hearsay. In this wild solitude, the mossy fens, with their quagmires  oozing with iridescent pools, supplied the cows, the principal source  of wealth, with rich, wet grass. In summer, on the short swards of the  slopes, the sheep were penned day and night, protected from beasts of  prey by a fence of hurdles propped up with pitchforks. When the grass  was cropped close at one spot, the fold was shifted elsewhere. In the  center was the shepherd's rolling hut, a straw cabin. Two watchdogs,  equipped with spiked collars, were answerable for tranquillity if the  thieving wolf appeared in the night from out the neighboring woods.    Padded with a perpetual layer of cow dung, in which I sank to my knees,  broken up with shimmering puddles of dark brown liquid manure, the  farmyard also boasted a numerous population. Here the lambs skipped, the  geese trumpeted, the fowls scratched the ground and the sow grunted with  her swarm of little pigs hanging to her dugs.    The harshness of the climate did not give husbandry the same chances.  In a propitious season, they would set fire to a stretch of moorland  bristling with gorse and send the swing plow across the ground enriched  with the cinders of the blaze. This yielded a few acres of rye, oats  and potatoes. The best corners were kept for hemp, which furnished the  distaffs and spindles of the house with the material for linen and was  looked upon as grandmother's private crop.    Grandfather, therefore, was, before all, a herdsman versed in matters of  cows and sheep, but completely ignorant of aught else. How dumbfounded  he would have been to learn that, in the remote future, one of his  family would become enamoured of those insignificant animals to which  he had never vouchsafed a glance in his life! Had he guessed that that  lunatic was myself, the scapegrace seated at the table by his side, what  a smack I should have caught in the neck, what a wrathful look!    \"The idea of wasting one's time with that nonsense!\" he would have  thundered.    For the patriarch was not given to joking. I can still see his serious  face, his unclipped head of hair, often brought back behind his ears  with a flick of the thumb and spreading its ancient Gallic mane over  his shoulders. I see his little three-cornered hat, his small clothes  buckled at the knees, his wooden shoes, stuffed with straw, that echoed  as he walked. Ah, no! Once childhood's games were past, it would never  have done to rear the Grasshopper and unearth the Dung beetle from his  natural surroundings.    Grandmother, pious soul, used to wear the eccentric headdress of the  Rouergue highlanders: a large disk of black felt, stiff as a plank,  adorned in the middle with a crown a finger's breadth high and hardly  wider across than a six franc piece. A black ribbon fastened under the  chin maintained the equilibrium of this elegant, but unsteady circle.  Pickles, hemp, chickens, curds and whey, butter; washing the clothes,  minding the children, seeing to the meals of the household: say that  and you have summed up the strenuous woman's round of ideas. On her left  side, the distaff, with its load of flax; in her right hand, the spindle  turning under a quick twist of her thumb, moistened at intervals with  her tongue: so she went through life, unwearied, attending to the order  and the welfare of the house. I see her in my mind's eye particularly on  winter evenings, which were more favorable to family talk. When the hour  came for meals, all of us, big and little, would take our seats round  a long table, on a couple of benches, deal planks supported by four  rickety legs. Each found his wooden bowl and his tin spoon in front of  him. At one end of the table always stood an enormous rye loaf, the  size of a cartwheel, wrapped in a linen cloth with a pleasant smell  of washing, and remained until nothing was left of it. With a vigorous  stroke, grandfather would cut off enough for the needs of the moment;  then he would divide the piece among us with the one knife which he  alone was entitled to wield. It was now each one's business to break up  his bit with his fingers and to fill his bowl as he pleased.    Next came grandmother's turn. A capacious pot bubbled lustily and sang  upon the flames in the hearth, exhaling an appetizing savor of bacon and  turnips. Armed with a long metal ladle, grandmother would take from it,  for each of us in turn, first the broth, wherein to soak the bread,  and next the ration of turnips and bacon, partly fat and partly lean,  filling the bowl to the top. At the other end of the table was the  pitcher, from which the thirsty were free to drink at will. What  appetites we had and what festive meals those were, especially when a  cream cheese, homemade, was there to complete the banquet!    Near us blazed the huge fireplace, in which whole tree trunks were  consumed in the extreme cold weather. From a corner of that monumental,  soot-glazed chimney, projected, at a convenient height, a bracket with  a slate shelf, which served to light the kitchen when we sat up late. On  this we burnt chips of pine wood, selected among the most translucent,  those containing the most resin. They shed over the room a lurid red  light, which saved the walnut oil in the lamp.    When the bowls were emptied and the last crumb of cheese scraped up,  grandam went back to her distaff, on a stool by the chimney corner. We  children, boys and girls, squatting on our heels and putting out our  hands to the cheerful fire of furze, formed a circle round her and  listened to her with eager ears. She told us stories, not greatly  varied, it is true, but still wonderful, for the wolf often played a  part in them. I should have very much liked to see this wolf, the hero  of so many tales that made our flesh creep; but the shepherd always  refused to take me into his straw hut, in the middle of the fold, at  night. When we had done talking about the horrid wolf, the dragon and  the serpent and when the resinous splinters had given out their last  gleams, we went to sleep the sweet sleep that toil gives. As the  youngest of the household, I had a right to the mattress, a sack stuffed  with oat chaff. The others had to be content with straw.    I owe a great deal to you, dear grandmother: it was in your lap that  I found consolation for my first sorrows. You have handed down to me,  perhaps, a little of your physical vigor, a little of your love of  work; but certainly you were no more accountable than grandfather for my  passion for insects.    Nor was either of my own parents. My mother, who was quite illiterate,  having known no teacher than the bitter experience of a harassed life,  was the exact opposite of what my tastes required for their development.  My peculiarity must seek its origin elsewhere: that I will swear. But  I do not find it in my father, either. The excellent man, who was hard  working and sturdily built like granddad, had been to school as a  child. He knew how to write, though he took the greatest liberties with  spelling; he knew how to read and understood what he read, provided the  reading presented no more serious literary difficulties than occurred  in the stories in the almanac. He was the first of his line to allow  himself to be tempted by the town and he lived to regret it. Badly off,  having but little outlet for his industry, making God knows what shifts  to pick up a livelihood, he went through all the disappointments of the  countryman turned townsman. Persecuted by bad luck, borne down by  the burden, for all his energy and good will, he was far indeed from  starting me in entomology. He had other cares, cares more direct and"]]]
