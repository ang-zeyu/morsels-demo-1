A similar case occurred some years ago at Gilmerton, near Edinburgh,  when a gentleman, observing a person leaping about in an extraordinary  manner, made up to him, and found him beset, and dreadfully bitten, by  about fifteen weasels, which continued their attack. Being both strong  persons, they succeeded in killing a number, and the rest escaped by  flying into the fissures of a neighboring rock. The account the person  gave of the commencement of the affray was, that, walking through the  park, he ran at a weasel which he saw, and made several attempts to  strike it, remaining between it and the rock to which its retreat lay.  The animal, being thus circumstanced, squeaked aloud, when an  instantaneous sortie was made by the colony, and an attack commenced.    The weasel is exceedingly difficult to tame. When kept in a cage, it  seems in a perpetual state of agitation, is terrified at the sight of  all who approach to look at it, and generally endeavors to hide itself  behind the straw, or other substances, which may be at the bottom of  its cage. Yet instances are not wanting to prove that the weasel may be  brought into complete subjection. Mademoiselle de Laistre, in a letter  on this subject, gives a very pleasing account of the education and  manners of a weasel which she took under her protection, and which  frequently ate from her hand, seemingly more delighted with this manner  of feeding than any other. \"If I pour,\" says this lady, \"some milk into  my hand, it will drink a good deal; but if I do not pay it this  compliment, it will scarcely take a drop. When satisfied, it generally  goes to sleep. My chamber is the place of its residence; and I have  found a method of dispelling its strong smell by perfumes. By day it  sleeps in a quilt, into which it gets by an unsewn place which it has  discovered on the edge; during the night, it is kept in a wired box or  cage, which it always enters with reluctance, and leaves with pleasure.  If it be set at liberty before my time of rising, after a thousand  little playful tricks, it gets into my bed, and goes to sleep on my  hand or on my bosom.    \"If I am up first, it spends a full half hour in caressing me; playing  with my fingers like a little dog, jumping on my head and on my neck,  and running round on my arms and body with a lightness and elegance  which I never found in any other animal. If I present my hands at the  distance of three feet, it jumps into them without ever missing. It  shows a great deal of address and cunning in order to compass its ends,  and seems to disobey certain prohibitions merely through caprice.  During all its actions it seems solicitous to divert, and to be  noticed; looking, at every jump, and at every turn, to see whether it  be observed or not. If no notice be taken of its gambols, it ceases  them immediately, and betakes itself to sleep; and when awakened from  the soundest sleep, it instantly resumes its gayety, and frolics about  in as sprightly a manner as before. It never shows any ill-humor,  unless when confined, or teased too much; in which case it expresses  its displeasure by a sort of murmur very different from that which it  utters when pleased. In the midst of twenty people, this little animal  distinguishes my voice, seeks me out, and springs over every body to  come to me. His play with me is the most lovely and caressing; with his  two little paws he pats me on the chin, with an air and manner  expressive of delight. This, and a thousand other preferences, show  that his attachment is real.    \"When he sees me dressed to go out, he will not leave me, and it is not  without some trouble that I can disengage myself from him. He then  hides himself behind a cabinet near the door, and jumps upon me, as I  pass, with so much celerity, that I often can scarcely perceive him. He  seems to resemble a squirrel in vivacity, agility, voice, and his  manner of murmuring. During the summer he squeaks and runs all the  night long; and since the commencement of the cold weather, I have not  observed this. Sometimes, when the sun shines while he is playing on  the bed, he turns and tumbles about, and murmurs for a while.    \"From his delight in drinking milk out of my hand, into which I pour a  very little at a time, and his custom of sipping the little drops and  edges of the fluid, it seems probable that he drinks dew in the same  manner. He very seldom drinks water, and then only for the want of  milk; and with great caution, seeming only to refresh his tongue once  or twice, and to be even afraid of that fluid. During the hot weather,  it rained a good deal. I presented to him some rain water in a dish,  and endeavored to make him go into it, but could not succeed. I then  wetted a piece of linen cloth in it, and put it near him, when he  rolled upon it with extreme delight. One singularity in this charming  animal is his curiosity; it being impossible to open a drawer or box,  or even to look at a paper, but it will examine it also. If he gets  into any place where I am afraid to let him stay, I take a paper or a  book, and look attentively at it, when he immediately runs upon my  hand, and surveys, with an inquisitive air, whatever I happen to hold.  I must further observe, that he plays with a young cat and dog, both of  some size; getting about their necks and paws without their doing him  the least harm.\"    The following story regarding the weasel is told in Selkirkshire: \"A  group of haymakers, while busy at their work on Chapelhope meadow, at  the upper end of St. Mary's Loch,--or rather of the Loch of the Lowes,  which is separated from it by a narrow neck of land,--saw an eagle  rising above the steep mountains that enclose the narrow valley. The  eagle himself was, indeed, no unusual sight; but there is something so  imposing and majestic in the flight of this noble bird, while he soars  upwards in spiral circles, that it fascinates the attention of most  people. But the spectators were soon aware of something peculiar in the  flight of the bird they were observing. He used his wings violently;  and the strokes were often repeated, as if he had been alarmed and  hurried by unusual agitation; and they noticed, at the same time, that  he wheeled in circles that seemed constantly decreasing, while his  ascent was proportionally rapid. The now idle haymakers drew together  in close consultation on the singular case, and continued to keep their  eyes on the seemingly distressed eagle, until he was nearly out of  sight, rising still higher and higher into the air. In a short while,  however, they were all convinced that he was again seeking the earth,  evidently not, as he ascended, in spiral curves; it was like something  falling, and with great rapidity. But, as he approached the ground,  they clearly saw he was tumbling in his fall like a shot bird; the  convulsive fluttering of his powerful wings stopping the descent but  very little, until he fell at a small distance from the men and boys of  the party, who had naturally run forward, highly excited by the strange  occurrence. A large black-tailed weasel or stoat ran from the body as  they came near; turned with the _nonchalance_ and impudence of the  tribe; stood up upon its hind legs; crossed its fore paws over its  nose, and surveyed its enemies a moment or two,--as they often do when  no dog is near,--and bounded into a saugh bush. The king of the air was  dead; and, what was more surprising, he was covered with his own blood;  and, upon further examination, they found his throat cut, and the  weasel has been suspected as the regicide unto this day.\"      THE POLECAT.    This animal, which is confined to the eastern continent, is thrice the  size of the weasel, but its prey is nearly the same. It has as high a  reputation in Europe, for its offensive smell, as the skunk has here.  The following fact is recorded in Bewick's Quadrupeds: \"During a severe  storm, one of these animals was traced in the snow from the side of a  rivulet to its hole at some distance from it. As it was observed to  have made frequent trips, and as other marks were to be seen in the  snow, which could not easily be accounted for, it was thought a matter  worthy of greater attention. Its hole was accordingly examined, the  polecat taken, and eleven fine eels were discovered to be the fruits of  its nocturnal exertions. The marks on the snow were found to have been  made by the motions of the eels while in the creature's mouth.\"      THE FERRET.    This animal is a native of Africa, and requires much care to preserve  it alive in cold countries. It is kept for the purpose of dislodging  rabbits from their warren, and has such a natural antipathy to these  animals, that, if a dead one be presented to a young ferret, though it  has never seen a rabbit before, it will eagerly seize it. Like the rest  of the species, it is remarkable for the pertinacity with which it  retains the bite which it has once taken. This circumstance is  illustrated by the following occurrence: A man, of the name of Isles, a  bargeman, finding himself much incommoded by the repeated mischief done  in his barge by rats, procured a ferret to destroy them. The ferret  remaining away a considerable time, he thought it was devouring some  rats that it had killed, and went to sleep, but was awakened early next  morning by the ferret, who was commencing an attack upon him. The  animal had seized him near his eyebrow; and the man, after endeavoring  in vain to shake him off, at length severed the body from the head with  a knife,--the latter still sticking so fast, as to be with difficulty  removed.      THE MINK.    This animal is found throughout a great extent of country, from  Carolina to Hudson's Bay, and in its habits and appearance resembles  the otter.

Hide of a Caribou doe, about four years      old, with about 130 small warbles or warble scars (concentrated on      the rump). Windy River, September 15, 1947.]    Only a small proportion of the hides of the locally killed Caribou are  preserved. A hide that would fetch only a dollar at Reindeer Lake would  not be worth transporting more than 250 miles from Nueltin Lake. Hearne  long ago (1795: 84) remarked on the remoteness of the hunting grounds  from the trading posts as a barrier to trade in the skins; and this  condition prevails to a large extent to the present day. Thus only such  hides as are required for domestic use are kept. Tanning, while done by  the Eskimos of the upper Kazan, is not undertaken by the residents on  Windy River. Here the task of drying the hides is left mainly to the  children of the camp. Most of them are pegged out on the summit of a  gravelly ridge, wooden pegs being driven with a rock through slits in  the edges of the skin (fig. 6). Now and then one is nailed to the outer  wall of a log cabin (fig. 18).    One of the main uses of the hides is for winter clothing. The Windy  River residents have their garments made by Eskimo women of the upper  Kazan, whose tanning process leaves the fur intact. Early autumn hides,  with new, comparatively short fur, are the ones in demand. The season  for securing such hides is said to extend to mid-September. At that  season the larvae of the warble fly have not developed far enough to  have injured the hide appreciably. The long winter fur is much less  suitable for clothing. In moderately cold weather a single coat  (_attigi_), with the fur inside (fig. 16), is worn by the Eskimos. This  coat, when made for a man, extends very little farther downward at the  rear than at the front; but a woman's coat is considerably longer at the  rear. The bottom is generally provided with a fringe consisting of small  strips of caribou skin, perhaps 4 inches long and 1/16 inch wide. In  mid-winter another coat, with the fur outside (fig. 15), is slipped on  over the other. Both are provided with hoods. Trousers, with the fur  outside, are cut rather short at the bottom; some such material as rope  is passed around the waist, without belt loops, to hold the trousers up.  Boots (_komik_) of tanned caribou skin (fig. 16), reaching nearly to the  knees, with the fur inside, make exceptionally warm footgear in winter.  An extra piece is sewed on the sole, with the fur outside, but the hairs  soon wear off. The seams are sewed with sinew. Another sort of boot, for  summer use, is made of untanned skin, without the fur, and is more or  less waterproof. Mittens (_pahloot_) have the fur outside; the thumb  piece, of a length suitable for a short Eskimo thumb, does not properly  fit a white man.    In the autumn of 1947 the migrating Caribou did not reach the territory  of the Chipewyans about the south end of Nueltin Lake till about  November 1--by which time the fur had grown so long that it was not  suitable for clothing. When I inquired of Charles Schweder how these  natives managed under such circumstances, he replied that nowadays they  use very little skin clothing--just manufactured clothing. Certainly the  latter type was being worn by three men of this tribe that visited the  Windy River post in late October. In this connection it is interesting  to note that in November Charles brought to Windy River a bundle of fawn  skins that he had secured from an Eskimo on the upper Kazan. Presently  he traded them to a Cree halfbreed from the Putahow River, who was to  have them made into a coat for himself. In years gone by the  above-mentioned Chipewyans must have found some means of securing  caribou skins for themselves in August or September; they could have  accomplished this by moving to the northern part of Nueltin Lake,  provided the animals had not reached the southern part at the proper  season.    From Charles Schweder I learned that the Hudson's Bay Company acquires  caribou skins (apparently tanned) from the Duck Lake Chipewyans at about  a dollar apiece, puts them up in bales of perhaps 10 to 20 skins, and  ships them by steamer from Churchill to Baffin Island or thereabouts,  for use by the Eskimos. He had seen about 25 or 30 such bales being  loaded on a steamer in September, 1947. This trade evidently results  from the present scarcity of Caribou on Baffin Island (_cf._ Manning,  1943a: 47-50; Soper, 1944: 247-250; Banfield, 1949: 481). Moccasins of  caribou skin, made by the Duck Lake Chipewyans, were on sale at  Churchill.    The three Caribou-eater Chipewyans from the south end of Nueltin Lake  brought mittens, gloves, and moccasins of caribou skin to trade at Windy  River. Similar gloves were brought by a Cree halfbreed from the Putahow  River.    At the Windy River post furred caribou skins served in upholstering the  seat, back, and arms of a couple of home-made chairs. They were used  also as mattresses or blankets, in the making of sleeping bags, and even  as insulating material on the outside of the cabin (Harper, 1949: 226,  228, figs.). The Schweder boys also maintain tents of caribou skin at  various points on their long trap-lines; they are much warmer than  canvas tents, and require no outlay of cash. The skins are nailed on  poles arranged in tepee form; the height of such a tent is about 10  feet, and the diameter 9 or 10 feet. There is a home-made stove inside,  with the smoke-pipe projecting outside about halfway to the top of the  tent.    The Eskimos of the Kazan River have large summer tents of caribou skin,  and smaller ones of canvas. The former are the ones in which the drum  dances are held. These Eskimos never make their winter houses wholly of  snow, according to Charles Schweder, but use caribou skins for the roof.    In illustration of the primary importance of the Caribou to both  primitive and civilized man in the Arctic and the sub-Arctic, the  numerous cases of partial or complete starvation in the absence of  Caribou may be cited. The chronicles of northern explorers are replete  with them. A notable case is that of John Hornby and his two companions  on the Thelon River in the winter of 1926-27 (Hoare, 1930: 25;  Christian, 1937). In the autumn of 1946 only a small fraction of the  normal caribou migration passed by the Eskimo camps on the upper Kazan  River. These happy-go-lucky, utterly improvident people did not take  steps to secure an alternative winter's supply of fish, and by the  following spring eight out of the band of 27 persons had succumbed  directly or indirectly to starvation. (It is suspected that several were  accounted for by anthropophagy.) Women, children, and dogs were the  victims; no adult male succumbed. The casualties would doubtless have  been more numerous if Charles Schweder had not reported the plight of  the band when he made a trip to Reindeer Lake in March. Thereupon the  government shipped emergency rations by plane as far as Nueltin Lake,  and Charles transported them from that point by sleigh to the Kazan.  Meanwhile he rescued two of the orphan children, took them to the Windy  River post, and in a few more months formally adopted them.      _Ethnological material from caribou products_    In addition to the utilization of caribou products for the primary  purposes of food, clothing, and shelter, as discussed in preceding  pages, certain other uses of an ethnological nature may be mentioned  here.    Charles Schweder spoke of the former Eskimo use of splint bones from the  legs of Caribou as needles, after a hole had been drilled or burned  through the larger end. They are about the same length as a large  darning needle. These people commonly use the back sinew as thread or as  wrapping on tools, drums, and the like. I saw a piece of back sinew  being dried for future use at the Windy River post.    Either lard or caribou fat serves as fuel for an \"Eskimo candle\"; the  wick is a bit of rag or moss. The heat of the flame melts the fat where  it is spread out in some small receptacle like a can cover. When our  other means of illumination gave out at the Windy River post, I worked  or wrote notes for many hours by the light of one of these candles. It  gives approximately as much illumination as an ordinary tallow candle.  One disadvantage of using caribou fat for this purpose is the  considerable amount of smoke that it produces.    The Eskimos make odd use of an antler as a brake for a sleigh, to  prevent the harnessed dogs from running after any Caribou they may  sight; on other occasions it retards the sleigh in descending a hill.  Such an antler, that I found at the Windy River post, is notched near  the base; a rope or thong, 2 or 3 feet in length, is fastened at one end  to this notch, and at the other to the side of the sleigh. To apply the  brake, the driver simply presses down the points of the antler into the  snow or ice.    The drums used in the ceremonial dances of the Kazan River Eskimos are  made of a piece of caribou skin stretched tightly over a circular frame  of spruce and fastened in place with caribou sinew. They are about 3  feet in diameter.    In an Eskimo fish spear from the upper Kazan River an iron barb on one  of the prongs is supported by a small piece of caribou antler and  fastened with back sinew. The two large lateral prongs, of metal, are  tied to the wooden shaft of the spear with braided sinew.    Two "]]]
