BROWN PELICAN. _Pelecanus occidentalis._    Range.--Found on the South Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United  States.    Brown Pelicans are about 50 inches in length; they have a blackish and  grayish body and a white head and neck with a brown stripe down the back  of the latter. The pouch is a dark greenish brown. This species is  maritime and is not found inland. They breed in large colonies on many  of the islands in the Gulf of Mexico and on Pelican Island on the east  coast of Florida, in which latter place they are now protected from  further depredations at the hand of eggers and gunners. Their fishing  tactics differ from those of the White Pelican. They dive down upon the  school of fish from the air and rarely miss making a good catch. Their  nests are quite bulky structures made of sticks and weeds and grasses.  These are generally located on the ground but occasionally in low  mangroves, these latter nests being more bulky than the ground ones.  They lay from two to five chalky white eggs during May and June. Size 3.  x 1.90. Data.--Tampa Bay, Fla., May 29, 1894. Three eggs. Nest in the  top of a stout mangrove; made of sticks, branches and leaves. Collector,  Geo. Graham.      127. CALIFORNIA BROWN PELICAN. _Pelecanus californicus._    Range.--Pacific coast from British Columbia south to the Galapagos  Islands.    This bird is similar to the preceding, but larger and the pouch is  reddish. They breed abundantly on the Coronado Islands and southward.  Their habits, nesting habits and eggs are the same as those of the Brown  Pelican. Size of the three or four chalky white eggs is 3.10 x 1.95.  Data.--Coronado Islands, Calif., March 28, 1897. Three eggs. Nest of  sticks, lined with green leaves, located on the ground. Collector, H.  McConville.    [Illustration 087: Chalky white.]  [Illustration: Brown Pelican.

MAN-O'-WAR BIRD. _Fregata aquila._    Range.--Tropical seas, north regularly in America to the South Atlantic  and Gulf coasts, casually farther.    Man-o'-war Birds or \"Frigates,\" as they are often called, are remarkable  birds in many respects. In comparison with their weight they have the  largest expanse of wing of any known bird. Weighing only about four  pounds they have an extent of from seven to eight feet, their wings  being extremely long and pointed. The length of the bird is about 40  inches, of which the tail comprises about 18 in., 10 inches of this  being forked. They have a large bright orange gular sac, a long, hooked  bill, and small slightly webbed feet. Their powers of flight combine the  strength of the Albatrosses and the grace of the Terns. They are very  poor swimmers and do not dive, so are forced to procure their food by  preying upon the Gulls and Cormorants, forcing them to drop their fish,  which the pirates catch before it reaches the water. They also feed upon  flying fish, catching them in the air, whither they have been driven by  their enemies in their natural element. They nest in large colonies on  some of the Bahama Islands and on some of the small Florida Keys. Their  nests are small frail platforms of sticks and twigs and the single egg  is laid in March and April. It is white and has a smooth surface. Size  2.80 x 1.90. Data.--Key Verde, Bahamas, March 6, 1889. Single egg. Nest  a frail affair of sticks on a cactus. Collector, D. P. Ingraham.    [Illustration 088: White.]  [Illustration: Man-O'-War Bird.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 87    Order V. ANSERES  DUCKS, GEESE AND SWANS. Family ANATIDAE    The birds comprising this family are of greatly varying sizes, but all  have webbed feet, and generally the bill is broader than high, and is  serrated on the edges or provided with gutters to act as a strainer in  assisting the birds to gather their food.      129. MERGANSER. _Mergus americanus._    Range.--North America, breeding from the northern border of the United  States northward.    The three species of Mergansers are almost exclusively fish eating  birds. Therefore their flesh is unpalatable and they are known as \"Fish  Ducks.\" They are also sometimes called \"Sawbills\" because of the  teeth-like serration on both the upper and the under mandibles. Unlike  the other species of ducks, their bills are long, slender and rounded  instead of being broad and flat; it is also hooked at the tip. Like the  Cormorants, they often pursue and catch fish under the water, their  teeth-like bills enabling them to firmly hold their prey.    The American Mergansers, Goosanders, or Sheldrakes, as they are often  called, are found both on the coast and in the interior. Except in  certain mountainous regions, they breed chiefly north of the United  States. The male bird has no crest and the head is a beautiful green,  while the female has a reddish brown crest and head, shading to white on  the chin. They build their nest in hollow trees near the water. It is  made of grasses, leaves and moss and is lined with feathers from the  breast of the female. During May, they lay from six to ten eggs of a  creamy or buff color. Size 2.70 x 1.75. Data.--Gun Is., Lake Winnipeg.  June 16, 1903. Eleven eggs in a nest of white down, located between two  large boulders. Collector, Walter Raine.    [Illustration 089: Brownish buff.]  [Illustration: American Merganser. Red-breasted Merganser.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 88    130. RED-BREASTED MERGANSER. _Mergus serrator._    Range.--North America, breeding from northern United States northward.    This species is more abundant than the preceding. It is slightly  smaller, being 22 inches in length, and the male is crested. Found  abundantly in the United States in winter. Breeds commonly in the  interior of British America and in Labrador and Newfoundland. They make  their nests on the ground, near the water, concealing them under rocks  or tufts of grass. The nest is made of grasses, leaves and moss and  lined with feathers. They lay, generally, about ten eggs of a buffy or  greenish buff color. Size 2.50 x 1.70. Data.--Lake Manitoba, N. W.  Canada. Two eggs in a hollow lined with down, under a patch of rose  bushes near shore. Collector, Jos. Hamaugh.      131. HOODED MERGANSER. _Lophodytes cucullatus._    Range.--North America, breeding locally throughout its range, in the  interior. These are beautiful little Ducks distinguished from all others  by the semi-circular, compressed crest which is black with an enclosed  white area. They make their nests in hollow trees, in wooded districts  near the water, lining the cavity with grasses and down. They lay ten or  twelve grayish white eggs. Size 2.15 x 1.70.      132. MALLARD. _Anas platyrhynchos._    Range.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding in America from northern United  States northward, and wintering south to Panama and the West Indies.    Contrasting with the preceding Fish Ducks, the Mallards are regarded as  one of the most esteemed table birds. They feed on mollusks and marine  insects which they generally reach by tipping in shallow water. They  nest in many localities in the United States but more abundantly north  of our borders. They nest in fields in close proximity to ponds or  lakes, placing their nests of grasses and feathers in the tall grass. In  May and June they lay from six to ten eggs of a buffy or olive color.  Size 2.25 x 1.25. Data.--San Diego, California, May 19, 1897. Nest made  of grass, lined with down, placed on the edge of a field near a pond.    [Illustration 090: Hooded Merganser.

This species usually nest in holes in trees, but on this island they  were nesting in holes under boulders.]    Page 90    133. BLACK DUCK. _Anas rubripes._    Range.--Eastern North America, breeding from the middle portions north  to the Hudson Bay territory and Labrador.    Throughout their breeding region, one or more pairs of these ducks nest  in nearly every favorable locality. Their nests are placed on the ground  in marshes, swamps or fields bordering a pond or lake, the nest being  concealed in the long grass or reeds. They breed in equal abundance,  either in the interior or along the sea coast; in the latter case their  nests are often placed beside of, or under an overhanging rock. It is  made of weeds, grass and moss and is lined with feathers and down. They  lay from six to twelve eggs during May and June; these are buff or  greenish buff in color. Size 2.30 x 1.70. Data.--Duck Is., Maine, June  3, 1893. Nest of grasses, concealed in a large tuft on water's edge.      134. FLORIDA DUCK. _Anas fulvigula fulvigula._    Range.--Florida and the Gulf of the Mississippi.    This is a similar, lighter colored, locally distributed race of the  foregoing. The most noticeable difference in plumage between this and  the Black Duck is the absence of markings on the chin. The habits are  the same, and the eggs, which are deposited in April, are similar to  those of the Black Duck, but smaller. Size 2.15 x 1.60.    [Illustration 092: Pale greenish buff.]  [Illustration: Black Duck. Florida Duck.]  [Illustration: deco-photo.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 91    134a. MOTTLED DUCK. _Anas fulvigula maculosa._    Range.--Gulf coast of Texas and up the Mississippi Valley to Kansas.    The habits of this bird differ in no way from the preceding ones. The  six to ten eggs are greenish buff in color. Size 2.15 x 1.55.      135. GADWALL. _Chaulelasmus streperus._    Range.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding in America, chiefly in the United  States and north to Manitoba, chiefly in the interior.    South in winter to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30003"],[0,"Law and Laughter (#14)"],[1,"out a sentence with solemn mien as he did so:  \"To appear in his father's suit\" it read.           *       *       *       *       *    There have been few readier men in retort than the late Mr. Francis  Oswald, the author of _Oswald on Contempt of Court_. After a stiff  breeze in a Chancery Court, the judge snapped out, \"Well, I can't teach  you manners, Mr. Oswald.\"--\"That is so, m'lud, that is so,\" replied the  imperturbable one. On another occasion, an irascible judge observed, \"If  you say another word, Mr. Oswald, I'll commit you.\"--\"That raises  another point--as to your lordship's power to commit counsel engaged in  arguing before you,\" was the cool answer.    The author of _Pie Powder_ in his entertaining volume, tells us that he  was once dining with a barrister who had just taken silk. In the course  of after-dinner talk, the new K.C. invited his friend to tell him what  he considered was his (the K.C.'s) chief fault in style. After some  considerable hesitation his friend admitted that he thought the K.C.  erred occasionally in being too long. This apparently somewhat annoyed  the K.C., and his friend feeling he had perhaps spoken too freely,  thought he would smooth matters by inviting similar criticism of himself  from the K.C., who at once replied, \"My dear boy, I don't think really  you have any fault. _Except, you know, you are so d--d offensive._\"    A judge and a facetious lawyer conversing on the subject of the  transmigration of souls, the judge said, \"If you and I were turned into  a horse and an ass, which of them would you prefer to be?\"--\"The ass, to  be sure,\" replied the lawyer.--\"Why?\"--\"Because,\" replied the lawyer, \"I  have heard of an ass being a judge, but of a horse, never.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: SERJEANT TALFOURD.]    In some cases counsel receive answers to questions which they had no  business to put, and these, if not quite to their liking, are what they  justly deserve. The following story of George Clarke, a celebrated  negro minstrel, is a case in point. On one occasion, when being examined  as a witness, he was severely interrogated by a lawyer. \"You are in the  minstrel business, I believe?\" inquired the lawyer. \"Yes, sir,\" was the  reply. \"Is not that rather a low calling?\"--\"I don't know but what it  is, sir,\" replied the minstrel; \"but it is so much better than my  father's that I am rather proud of it.\" The lawyer fell into the trap.  \"What was your father's calling?\" he inquired. \"He was a lawyer,\"  replied Clarke, in a tone that sent the whole Court into a roar of  laughter as the discomfited lawyer sat down.    At the Durham Assizes an action was tried which turned out to have been  brought by one neighbour against another for a trifling matter. The  plaintiff was a deaf old lady, and after a pause the judge suggested  that the counsel should get his client to compromise it, and to ask her  what she would take to settle it. Very loudly counsel shouted out to his  client: \"His lordship wants to know what you will take?\" She at once  replied: \"I thank his lordship kindly, and if it's no ill convenience to  him, I'll take a little _warm ale_.\"    A tailor sent his bill to a lawyer, and a message to ask for payment.  The lawyer bid the messenger tell his master that he was not running  away, and was very busy at the time. The messenger returned and said he  must have the money. The lawyer testily answered, \"Did you tell your  master that I was not running away?\"--\"Yes, I did, sir; but he bade me  tell you that _he was_.\"    A well-known barrister at the criminal Bar, who prided himself upon his  skill in cross-examining a witness, had an odd-looking witness upon whom  to operate. \"You say, sir, that the prisoner is a thief?\"--\"Yes,  sir--'cause why, she confessed it.\"--\"And you also swear she did some  repairs for you subsequent to the confession?\"--\"I do, sir.\"--\"Then,\"  giving a knowing look at the Court, \"we are to understand that you  employ dishonest people to work for you, even after their rascalities  are known?\"--\"Of course! How else could I get assistance from a  lawyer?\"--\"Stand down!\" shouted the man of law.           *       *       *       *       *    At Worcester Assizes, a cause was tried as to the soundness of a horse,  and a clergyman had been a witness, who gave a very confused account of  the transaction, and the matters he spoke to. A blustering counsel on  the other side, after many attempts to get at the facts, said: \"Pray,  sir, do you know the difference between a horse and a cow?\"--\"I  acknowledge my ignorance,\" replied the clergyman. \"I hardly know the  difference between a horse and a cow, or between a bully and a bull.  Only a bull, I am told, has horns, and a bully,\" bowing respectfully to  the counsel, \"_luckily for me, has none_.\"    \"In Court one day,\" says Mr. W. Andrews in _The Lawyer_, \"I heard the  following sharp encounter between a witness and an exceedingly irascible  old-fashioned solicitor who, among other things, hated the modern custom  of growing a beard or moustache. He himself grew side-whiskers in the  most approved style of half a century ago. \"Speak up, witness,\" he  shouted, \"and don't stand mumbling there. If you would shave off that  unsightly moustache we might be better able to hear what was coming out  of your lips.\" \"And if you, sir,\" said the witness quietly, \"would shave  off those side-whiskers you would enable my words to reach your ears.\"\"    \"My friend,\" said an irritable lawyer, \"you are an ass.\"--\"Do you mean,  sir,\" asked the witness, \"that I am your friend because I am an ass, or  an ass because I am your friend?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Counsel sometimes comes to grief in dealing with experts. \"Do you,\"  asked one of a scientist, \"know of a substance called Sulphonylic  Diazotised Sesqui Oxide of Aldehyde?\" and he looked round triumphantly.  \"Certainly,\" came the reply. \"It is analogous in diatomic composition of  Para Sulpho Benzine Azode Methyl Aniline in conjunction with  Phehekatoline.\" Counsel said he would pursue the matter no further.    An action was brought by the owner of a donkey which was forced against  a wall by a waggon and killed. The driver of the donkey was the chief  witness, and was much bullied by Mr. Raine, the defendant's counsel, so  that he lost his head and was reprimanded by the judge for not giving  direct answers, and looking the jury in the face. Mr. Raine had a  powerful cast in his eye, which probably heightened the poor fellow's  confusion; and he continued to deal very severely with the witness,  reminding him again and again of the judge's caution, saying: \"Hold up  your head, man: look up, I say. Can't you hold up your head, fellow?  Can't you look as I do?\" The witness, with much simplicity, at once  answered, \"I can't, you squint.\" On re-examination, Serjeant Cockle for  the plaintiff, seeing gleams of the witness's recovery from his  confusion, asked him to describe the position of the waggon and the  donkey. After much pressing, at last he said, \"Well, my lord judge, I'll  tell you as how it happened.\" Turning to Cockle, he said, \"You'll  suppose ye are the wall.\"--\"Aye, aye, just so, go on. I am the wall,  very good.\"--\"Yes, sir, you are the wall.\" Then changing his position a  little, he said, \"I am the waggon.\"--\"Yes, very good; now proceed, you  are the waggon,\" said the judge. The witness then looked to the judge,  and hesitating at first, but with a low bow and a look of sudden  despair, said, \"And your lordship's the ass!\"    Serjeant Cockle, who had a rough, blustering manner, once got from a  witness more than he gave. In a trial of a right of fishery, he asked  the witness: \"Dost thou love fish?\"--\"Aye,\" replied the witness, with a  grin, \"but I donna like cockle sauce with it.\" The learned serjeant was  not pleased with the roar of laughter which followed the remark.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. H. L. Adam in _The Story of Crime_ says he remembers a very amusing  incident in one of our police courts. A prisoner had engaged a solicitor  to defend him, and while the latter was speaking on his behalf he  suddenly broke in with, \"Why, he dunno wot the devil he's talking  abaht!\" Thereupon the magistrate informed him that if he was  dissatisfied with his advocate's capabilities, he could, if he chose,  defend himself. This he elected to do, and in the end was acquitted, the  magistrate remarking that had the case been left to counsel he would  unquestionably have been convicted.    In cross-examining a witness, says Judge Parry in _What the Judge Saw_,  who had described the effects of an accident, was confronted by counsel  with his statement, and asked, \"But hadn't you told the doctor that  your thigh was numb and had no feeling?\"--\"What's the good o' telling  him anything,\" replied the witness. \"That's where doctor made a mistake.  I told 'im I was numb i' front, and what does he do but go and stick a  pin into my back-side. 'E's no doctor.\"    From the same source is the following story. Another man was testifying  to an accident that had occurred to him at the works where he was  employed. It was sought to prove that his testimony was false because he  had a holiday that day, and this poser was put to him: \"Do you mean to  tell the Court that you came to work when you might have been enjoying a  holiday?\"--\"Certainly.\"--\"Why did you do that?\" The reply was too  obviously truthful. \"What should I do? I have nowhere to go. I'm  teetotal now.\"    A Jew had been condemned to be hanged, and was brought to the gallows  along with a fellow prisoner; but on the road, before reaching the place  of execution, a reprieve arrived for the Jew. When informed of this, it  was expected that he would instantly leave the cart in which he was  conveyed, but he remained and saw his fellow prisoner hanged. Being  asked why he did not at once go about his business, he said, \"He"]]]
