[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2750"],[0,"Joan of Naples (#14)"],[1,", she ought for her own sake to persuade the queen to  stop legal proceedings.    The empress seemed to be deeply impressed by her nephew's threatening  attitude, and promised to do her best to persuade the queen to grant all  he asked, on condition, however, that Charles should allow the necessary  time for carrying through so delicate a business. But Catherine profited  by this delay to think out her own plan of revenge, and ensure the means  of certain success. After starting several projects eagerly and then  regretfully abandoning them, she fixed upon an infernal and unheard-of  scheme, which the mind would refuse to believe but for the unanimous  testimony of historians. Poor Agnes of Duras, Charles's mother, had for  some few days been suffering with an inexplicable weariness, a slow  painful malady with which her son's restlessness and violence may have  had not a little to do. The empress resolved that the first effect of  her hatred was to fall upon this unhappy mother. She summoned the Count  of Terlizzi and Dona Cancha, his mistress, who by the queen's orders had  been attending Agnes since her illness began. Catherine suggested to the  young chamberwoman, who was at that time with child, that she should  deceive the doctor by representing that certain signs of her own  condition really belonged to the sick woman, so that he, deceived by the  false indications, should be compelled to admit to Charles of Durazzo  that his mother was guilty and dishonoured. The Count of Terlizzi, who  ever since he had taken part in the regicide trembled in fear of  discovery, had nothing to oppose to the empress's desire, and Dona  Cancha, whose head was as light as her heart was corrupt, seized with a  foolish gaiety on any chance of taking her revenge on the prudery of the  only princess of the blood who led a pure life at a court that was  renowned for its depravity. Once assured that her accomplices would be  prudent and obedient, Catherine began to spread abroad certain vague and  dubious but terribly serious rumours, only needing proof, and soon after  the cruel accusation was started it was repeated again and again in  confidence, until it reached the ears of Charles.    At this amazing revelation the duke was seized with a fit of trembling.  He sent instantly for the doctor, and asked imperiously what was the  cause of his mother's malady. The doctor turned pale and stammered; but  when Charles grew threatening he admitted that he had certain grounds  for suspecting that the duchess was enceinte, but as he might easily  have been deceived the first time, he would make a second investigation  before pronouncing his opinion in so serious a matter. The next day, as  the doctor came out of the bedroom, the duke met him, and interrogating  him with an agonised gesture, could only judge by the silence that his  fears were too well confirmed. But the doctor, with excess of caution,  declared that he would make a third trial. Condemned criminals can  suffer no worse than Charles in the long hours that passed before that  fatal moment when he learned that his mother was indeed guilty. On the  third day the doctor stated on his soul and conscience that Agnes of  Durazzo was pregnant.    \"Very good,\" said Charles, dismissing the doctor with no sign of  emotion.    That evening the duchess took a medicine ordered by the doctor; and  when, half an hour later, she was assailed with violent pains, the duke  was warned that perhaps other physicians ought to be consulted, as the  prescription of the ordinary doctor, instead of bringing about an  improvement in her state, had only made her worse.    Charles slowly went up to the duchess's room, and sending away all the  people who were standing round her bed, on the pretext that they were  clumsy and made his mother worse, he shut the door, and they were alone.  Then poor Agnes, forgetting her internal agony when she saw her son,  pressed his hand tenderly and smiled through her tears.    Charles, pale beneath his bronzed complexion, his forehead moist with a  cold sweat, and his eyes horribly dilated, bent over the sick woman and  asked her gloomily--    \"Are you a little better, mother?\"    \"Ah, I am in pain, in frightful pain, my poor Charles. I feel as though  I have molten lead in my veins. O my son, call your brothers, so that I  may give you all my blessing for the last time, for I cannot hold out  long against this pain. I am burning. Mercy! Call a doctor: I know I  have been poisoned.\"    Charles did not stir from the bedside.    \"Water!\" cried the dying woman in a broken voice,--\"water! A doctor, a  confessor! My children--I want my children!\"    And as the duke paid no heed, but stood moodily silent, the poor mother,  prostrated by pain, fancied that grief had robbed her son of all power  of speech or movement, and so, by a desperate effort, sat up, and  seizing him by the arm, cried with all the strength she could muster--    \"Charles, my son, what is it? My poor boy, courage; it is nothing, I  hope. But quick, call for help, call a doctor. Ah, you have no idea of  what I suffer.\"    \"Your doctor,\" said Charles slowly and coldly, each word piercing his  mother's heart like a dagger,--\"your doctor cannot come.\"    \"Oh why?\" asked Agnes, stupefied.    \"Because no one ought to live who knows the secret of our shame.\"    \"Unhappy man!\" she cried, overwhelmed with, pain and terror, \"you have  murdered him! Perhaps you have poisoned your mother too! Charles,  Charles, have mercy on your own soul!\"    \"It is your doing,\" said Charles, without show of emotion: \"you have  driven me into crime and despair; you have caused my dishonour in this  world and my damnation in the next.\"    \"What are you saying? My own Charles, have mercy! Do not let me die in  this horrible uncertainty; what fatal delusion is blinding you? Speak,  my son, speak: I am not feeling the poison now. What have I done? Of  what have I been accused?\"    She looked with haggard eyes at her son: her maternal love still  struggled against the awful thought of matricide; at last, seeing that  Charles remained speechless in spite of her entreaties, she repeated,  with a piercing cry--    \"Speak, in God's name, speak before I die!\"    \"Mother, you are with child.\"    \"What!\" cried Agnes, with a loud cry, which broke her very heart. \"O  God, forgive him! Charles, your mother forgives and blesses you in  death.\"    Charles fell upon her neck, desperately crying for help: he would now  have gladly saved her at the cost of his life, but it was too late. He  uttered one cry that came from his heart, and was found stretched out  upon his mother's corpse.    Strange comments were made at the court on the death of the Duchess of  Durazzo and her doctor's disappearance; but there was no doubt at all  that grief and gloom were furrowing wrinkles on Charles's brow, which  was already sad enough. Catherine alone knew the terrible cause of her  nephew's depression, for to her it was very plain that the duke at one  blow had killed his mother and her physician. But she had never expected  a reaction so sudden and violent in a man who shrank before no crime.  She had thought Charles capable of everything except remorse. His  gloomy, self absorbed silence seemed a bad augury for her plans. She had  desired to cause trouble for him in his own family, so that he might  have no time to oppose the marriage of her son with the queen; but she  had shot beyond her mark, and Charles, started thus on the terrible path  of crime, had now broken through the bonds of his holiest affections,  and gave himself up to his bad passions with feverish ardour and a  savage desire for revenge. Then Catherine had recourse to gentleness and  submission. She gave her son to understand that there was only one way  of obtaining the queen's hand, and that was by flattering the ambition  of Charles and in some sort submitting himself to his patronage. Robert  of Tarentum understood this, and ceased making court to Joan, who  received his devotion with cool kindness, and attached himself closely  to Charles, paying him much the same sort of respect and deference that  he himself had affected for Andre, when the thought was first in his  mind of causing his ruin. But the Duke of Durazzo was by no means  deceived as to the devoted friendship shown towards him by the heir of  the house of Tarentum, and pretending to be deeply touched by the  unexpected change of feeling, he all the time kept a strict guard on  Robert's actions.    An event outside all human foresight occurred to upset the calculations  of the two cousins. One day while they were out together on horseback,  as they often were since their pretended reconciliation, Louis of  Tarentum, Robert's youngest brother, who had always felt for Joan a  chivalrous, innocent love,--a love which a young man of twenty is apt to  lock up in his heart as a secret treasure,--Louis, we say, who had held  aloof from the infamous family conspiracy and had not soiled his hands  with Andre's blood, drawn on by an irrepressible passion, all at once  appeared at the gates of Castel Nuovo; and while his brother was wasting  precious hours in asking for a promise of marriage, had the bridge  raised and gave the soldiers strict orders to admit no one. Then, never  troubling himself about Charles's anger or Robert's jealousy, he hurried  to the queen's room, and there, says Domenico Gravina, without any  preamble, the union was consummated.    On returning from his ride, Robert, astonished that the bridge was not  at once lowered for him, at first loudly called upon the soldiers on  guard at the fortress, threatening severe punishment for their  unpardonable negligence; but as the gates did not open and the soldiers  made no sign of fear or regret, he fell into a violent fit of rage, and  swore he would hang the wretches like dogs for hindering his return  home. But the Empress of Constantinople, terrified at the bloody "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27509"],[0,"The 2006 CIA World Factbook (#14)"],[1,"is  focused on their current and anticipated needs. The staff welcomes  suggestions for new entries.    How often is The World Factbook updated?    Formerly our Web site (and the published Factbook) were only updated  annually. Beginning in November 2001 we instituted a new system of  more frequent online updates. The World Factbook is currently  updated every two weeks.    The annual printed version of the Factbook is usually released about  midyear. US Government officials may obtain information about  Factbook availability from their own organizations or through  liaison channels to the CIA. Other users may obtain sales  information through the following channels:    Superintendent of Documents  P. O. Box 371954 Pittsburgh, PA 15250-7954  Telephone: [1] (202) 512-1800  FAX: [1] (202) 512-2250  http://bookstore.gpo.gov    National Technical Information Service  5285 Port Royal Road Springfield, VA 22161  Telephone: [1] (800) 553-6847 (only in the US);  [1] (703) 605-6000 (for outside US)  FAX: [1] (703) 605-6900  http://www.ntis.gov    Can I use some or all of The World Factbook for my Web site (book,  research project, homework, etc.)?    The World Factbook is in the public domain and may be used freely by  anyone at anytime without seeking permission. However, US Code  prohibits use of the CIA seal in a manner which implies that the CIA  approved, endorsed, or authorized such use. If you have any  questions about your intended use, you should consult with legal  counsel. Further information on The World Factbook's use is  described on the Contributors and Copyright Information page. As a  courtesy, please cite The World Factbook when used.    Why doesn't The World Factbook include information on states,  departments, provinces, etc., in the country format?    The World Factbook provides national-level information on countries,  territories, and dependencies, but not subnational administrative  units within a country. A good encyclopedia should provide  state/province-level information.    Is it possible to access older editions of The World Factbook to do  comparative research and trend analysis?    Only the current version is available for browsing on the CIA Web  site. In the future, the staff hopes to post electronic versions of  The World Factbook as far back as 1986. Hardcopy editions for  earlier years are available from libraries.    Would it be possible to set up a partnership or collaboration  between the producers of The World Factbook and other organizations  or individuals?    The World Factbook does not partner with other organizations or  individuals, but we do welcome comments and suggestions that such  groups or persons choose to provide.      Geography    I can't find a geographic name for a particular country. Why not?    The World Factbook is not a gazetteer (a dictionary or index of  places, usually with descriptive or statistical information) and  cannot provide more than the names of the administrative divisions  (in the Government category) and major cities/towns (on the country  maps). Our expanded Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names,  however, includes many of the world's major geographic features as  well as historic (former) names of countries and cities mentioned in  The World Factbook.    Why are Taiwan and the European Union listed out of alphabetical  order at the end of the Factbook entries?    Taiwan is listed after the regular entries because even though the  mainland People's Republic of China claims Taiwan, elected Taiwanese  authorities de facto administer the island and reject mainland  sovereignty claims. With the establishment of diplomatic relations  with China on January 1, 1979, the US Government recognized the  People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China,  acknowledging the Chinese position that there is only one China and  that Taiwan is part of China.    The European Union (EU) is not a country, but it has taken on many  nation-like attributes and these are likely to be expanded in the  future. A more complete explanation on the inclusion of the EU into  the Factbook may be found in the Preliminary statement.    Since we have an ambassador who represents the US at the Vatican,  why is this entity not listed in the Factbook?    Vatican City is found under Holy See. The term \"Holy See\" refers to  the authority, jurisdiction, and sovereignty vested in the Pope and  his advisors to direct the worldwide Catholic Church. The Holy See  has a legal personality that allows it to enter into treaties as the  juridical equal of a state and to send and receive diplomatic  representatives. Vatican City, created in 1929 to administer  properties belonging to the Holy See in Rome, is recognized under  international law as a sovereign state, but it does not send or  receive diplomatic representatives. Consequently, Holy See is  included as a Factbook entry, with Vatican City cross-referenced in  the Geographic Names appendix.    Why is Palestine not listed in The World Factbook?    The areas that could potentially form a future Palestinian state --  the West Bank and Gaza Strip -- do appear in the Factbook. These  areas are presently Israeli-occupied with current status subject to  the Israeli-Palestinian 1995 Interim Agreement; their permanent  status is to be determined through further negotiation.    Why are the Golan Heights not shown as part of Israel or Northern  Cyprus with Turkey?    Territorial occupations/annexations not recognized by the United  States Government are not shown on US Government maps.    Why don't you include information on entities such as Tibet,  Kashmir, or Kosovo?    The World Factbook provides information on the administrative  divisions of a country as recommended by the United States Board on  Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is a component of the US Government  that develops policies, principles, and procedures governing the  spelling, use, and application of geographic names--domestic,  foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all  departments and agencies of the US Government to have access to  uniform names of geographic features.    Also included in the Factbook are entries on parts of the world  whose status has not yet been resolved (e.g., West Bank, Spratly  Islands). Specific regions within a country or areas in dispute  among countries are not covered.    What do you mean when you say that a country is \"doubly landlocked\"?    A doubly landlocked country is one that is separated from an ocean  or an ocean-accessible sea by two intervening countries. Uzbekistan  and Liechtenstein are the only countries that fit this definition.      Spelling and Pronunciation    Why is the spelling of proper names such as rulers, presidents, and  prime ministers in The World Factbook different than their spelling  in my country?    The Factbook staff applies the names and spellings from the Chiefs  of State link on the CIA Web site. The World Factbook is prepared  using the standard American English computer keyboard and does not  use any special characters, symbols, or most diacritical markings in  its spellings. Surnames are always spelled with capital letters;  they may appear first in some cultures.    The spelling of geographic names, features, cities, administrative  divisions, etc. in the Factbook differs from those used in my  country. Why is this?    The United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) recommends and  approves names and spellings. The BGN is the component of the United  States Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures  governing the spelling, use, and application of geographic  names--domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions  enable all departments and agencies of the US Government to use  uniform names of geographic features. (A note is usually included  where changes may have occurred but have not yet been approved by  the BGN). The World Factbook is prepared using the standard American  English computer keyboard and does not use any special characters,  symbols, or most diacritical markings in its spellings.    Why doesn't The World Factbook include pronunciations of country or  leader names?    There are too many variations in pronunciation among  English-speaking countries, not to mention English renditions of  non-English names, for pronunciations to be included. American  English pronunciations are included for some countries like Qatar  and Kiribati.    Why is the name of the Labour party misspelled?    When American and British spellings of common English words differ,  The World Factbook always uses the American spelling, even when  these common words form part of a proper name in British English.      Policies and Procedures    What is The World Factbook's source for a specific subject field?    The Factbook staff uses many different sources to publish what we  judge are the most reliable and consistent data for any particular  category. Space considerations preclude a listing of these various  sources.    The names of some geographic features provided in the Factbook  differ from those used in other publications. For example, in Asia  the Factbook has Burma as the country name, but in other  publications Myanmar is used; also, the Factbook uses Sea of Japan  whereas other publications label it East Sea. What is your policy on  naming geographic features?    The Factbook staff follows the guidance of the United States Board  on Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is the component of the United  States Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures  governing the spelling, use, and application of geographic  names--domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions  enable all departments and agencies of the US Government to have  access to uniform names of geographic features. The position of the  BGN is that the names Burma and Sea of Japan be used in official US  Government maps and publications.    Why is most of the"]]]
