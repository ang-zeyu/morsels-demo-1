Why do your GDP (Gross Domestic Product) statistics differ from other  sources?    GDP dollar estimates in The World Factbook are derived from purchasing  power parity (PPP) calculations. See the Notes and Definitions section  on GDP methodology for more information.      On the CIA Web site, Chiefs of State is updated weekly, but the last  update for the Factbook was an earlier date. Why the discrepancy?    Although Chiefs of State and The World Factbook both appear on the CIA  Web site, they are produced and updated by separate staffs. Chiefs of  State includes fewer countries but more leaders, and is updated more  frequently than The World Factbook, which has a much larger database,  and includes all countries.      Some percentage distributions do not add to 100. Why not?    Because of rounding, percentage distributions do not always add  precisely to 100%. Rounding of numbers always results in a loss of  precision--i.e., error. This error becomes apparent when percentage data  are totaled, as the following two examples show:                        Original Data        Rounded to whole integer      Example 1       43.2                 43                    30.4                 30                    26.4                 26                    ----                 --                   100.0                 99      Example 2       42.8                 43                    31.6                 32                    25.6                 26                    ----                 --                   100.0                101    When this occurs, we do not force the numbers to add exactly to 100,  because doing so would introduce additional error into the  distribution.      What rounding convention does The World Factbook use?    In deciding on the number of digits to present, the Factbook staff  assesses the accuracy of the original data and the needs of US  Government officials. All of the economic data are processed by  computer--either at the source or by the Factbook staff. The economic  data presented in The Factbook, therefore, follow the rounding  convention used by virtually all numerical software applications,  namely, any digit followed by a \"5\" is rounded up to the next higher  digit, no matter whether the original digit is even or odd. Thus, for  example, when rounded to the nearest integer, 2.5 becomes 3, rather  than 2, as occurred in some pre-computer rounding systems.      Technical    Does The World Factbook comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation  Act regarding accessibility of Web pages?    The World Factbook home page has a link entitled \"Text/Low Bandwidth  Version.\" The country data in the text version is fully accessible. We  believe The World Factbook is compliant with the Section 508 law in  both fact and spirit. If you are experiencing difficulty, please use  our comment form to provide us details of the specific problem you are  experiencing and the assistive software and/or hardware that you are  using so that we can work with our technical support staff to find and  implement a solution. We welcome visitors' suggestions to improve  accessibility of The World Factbook and the CIA Web site.      I am using the Factbook online and it is not working. What is wrong?    Hundreds of \"Factbook\" look-alikes exist on the Internet. The Factbook  site at: www.cia.gov is the only official site.      When I attempt to download a PDF (Portable Document Format) map file  (or some other map) the file has no image. Can you fix this?    Some of the files on The World Factbook Web site are large and could  take several minutes to download on a dial-up connection. The screen  might be blank during the download process.      When I open a map on The World Factbook site, it is fuzzy or granular,  or too big or too small. Why?    Adjusting the resolution setting on your monitor should correct this  problem.      Is The World Factbook country data available in machine-readable  format? All I can find is HTML, but I'm looking for simple tabular  data.    The Factbook Web site now features \"Rank Order\" pages for selected  Factbook entries. \"Rank Order\" pages are available for those data  fields identified with a small bar chart icon located next to the title  of the data entry. In addition, all of the \"Rank Order\" pages can be  downloaded as tab-delimited data files that can be opened in other  applications such as spreadsheets and databases.

The Soviet Union invaded in 1979, but was forced to withdraw 10    years later by anti-Communist mujahidin forces. The Communist regime    in Kabul collapsed in 1992. Fighting that subsequently erupted among    the various mujahidin factions eventually helped to spawn the    Taliban, a hardline Pakistani-sponsored movement that fought to end    the warlordism and civil war that gripped the country. The Taliban    seized Kabul in 1996 and were able to capture most of the country    outside of Northern Alliance strongholds primarily in the northeast.    Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, a US, Allied, and    Northern Alliance military action toppled the Taliban for sheltering    Osama BIN LADIN. In late 2001, a conference in Bonn, Germany,    established a process for political reconstruction that ultimately    resulted in the adoption of a new constitution and presidential    election in 2004. On 9 October 2004, Hamid KARZAI became the first    democratically elected president of Afghanistan. The new Afghan    government's next task is to hold National Assembly elections,    tentatively scheduled for April 2005.

Well, I was laughing over my good fortune.\"    \"Oh, that is true; I don't know a happier man than you. But what is this  last piece of luck that has befallen you?'    \"Well, my dear fellow, congratulate me.\"    \"I desire nothing better.\"    \"It seems that I am the first who has had his measure taken in that  manner.\"    \"Are you so sure of it?'    \"Nearly so. Certain signs of intelligence which passed between Voliere  and the other _garcons_ showed me the fact.\"    \"Well, my friend, that does not surprise me from Moliere,\" said  D'Artagnan.    \"Voliere, my friend.\"    \"Oh, no, no, indeed! I am very willing to leave you to go on saying  Voliere; but, as for me, I shall continued to say Moliere. Well, this,  I was saying, does not surprise me, coming from Moliere, who is a very  ingenious fellow, and inspired you with this grand idea.\"    \"It will be of great use to him by and by, I am sure.\"    \"Won't it be of use to him, indeed? I believe you, it will, and that  in the highest degree;--for you see my friend Moliere is of all  known tailors the man who best clothes our barons, comtes, and  marquises--according to their measure.\"    On this observation, neither the application nor depth of which we  shall discuss, D'Artagnan and Porthos quitted M. de Percerin's house and  rejoined their carriages, wherein we will leave them, in order to look  after Moliere and Aramis at Saint-Mande.        Chapter VI. The Bee-Hive, the Bees, and the Honey.    The bishop of Vannes, much annoyed at having met D'Artagnan at M.  Percerin's, returned to Saint-Mande in no very good humor. Moliere,  on the other hand, quite delighted at having made such a capital rough  sketch, and at knowing where to find his original again, whenever he  should desire to convert his sketch into a picture, Moliere arrived in  the merriest of moods. All the first story of the left wing was occupied  by the most celebrated Epicureans in Paris, and those on the freest  footing in the house--every one in his compartment, like the bees in  their cells, employed in producing the honey intended for that royal  cake which M. Fouquet proposed to offer his majesty Louis XIV. during  the _fete_ at Vaux. Pelisson, his head leaning on his hand, was engaged  in drawing out the plan of the prologue to the \"Facheux,\" a comedy in  three acts, which was to be put on the stage by Poquelin de Moliere, as  D'Artagnan called him, or Coquelin de Voliere, as Porthos styled him.  Loret, with all the charming innocence of a gazetteer,--the gazetteers  of all ages have always been so artless!--Loret was composing an  account of the _fetes_ at Vaux, before those _fetes_ had taken place.  La Fontaine sauntered about from one to the other, a peripatetic,  absent-minded, boring, unbearable dreamer, who kept buzzing and humming  at everybody's elbow a thousand poetic abstractions. He so often  disturbed Pelisson, that the latter, raising his head, crossly said, \"At  least, La Fontaine, supply me with a rhyme, since you have the run of  the gardens at Parnassus.\"    \"What rhyme do you want?\" asked the _Fabler_ as Madame de Sevigne used  to call him.    \"I want a rhyme to _lumiere_.\"    \"_Orniere_,\" answered La Fontaine.    \"Ah, but, my good friend, one cannot talk of _wheel-ruts_ when  celebrating the delights of Vaux,\" said Loret.    \"Besides, it doesn't rhyme,\" answered Pelisson.    \"What! doesn't rhyme!\" cried La Fontaine, in surprise.    \"Yes; you have an abominable habit, my friend,--a habit which will ever  prevent your becoming a poet of the first order. You rhyme in a slovenly  manner.\"    \"Oh, oh, you think so, do you, Pelisson?\"    \"Yes, I do, indeed. Remember that a rhyme is never good so long as one  can find a better.\"    \"Then I will never write anything again save in prose,\" said La  Fontaine, who had taken up Pelisson's reproach in earnest. \"Ah! I often  suspected I was nothing but a rascally poet! Yes, 'tis the very truth.\"    \"Do not say so; your remark is too sweeping, and there is much that is  good in your 'Fables.'\"    \"And to begin,\" continued La Fontaine, following up his idea, \"I will go  and burn a hundred verses I have just made.\"    \"Where are your verses?\"    \"In my head.\"    \"Well, if they are in your head you cannot burn them.\"    \"True,\" said La Fontaine; \"but if I do not burn them--\"    \"Well, what will happen if you do not burn them?\"    \"They will remain in my mind, and I shall never forget them!\"    \"The deuce!\" cried Loret; \"what a dangerous thing! One would go mad with  it!\"    \"The deuce! the deuce!\" repeated La Fontaine; \"what can I do?\"    \"I have discovered the way,\" said Moliere, who had entered just at this  point of the conversation.    \"What way?\"    \"Write them first and burn them afterwards.\"    \"How simple! Well, I should never have discovered that. What a mind that  devil of a Moliere has!\" said La Fontaine. Then, striking his forehead,  \"Oh, thou wilt never be aught but an ass, Jean La Fontaine!\" he added.    \"_What_ are you saying there, my friend?\" broke in Moliere, approaching  the poet, whose aside he had heard.    \"I say I shall never be aught but an ass,\" answered La Fontaine, with  a heavy sigh and swimming eyes. \"Yes, my friend,\" he added, with  increasing grief, \"it seems that I rhyme in a slovenly manner.\"    \"Oh, 'tis wrong to say so.\"    \"Nay, I am a poor creature!\"    \"Who said so?\"    \"_Parbleu!_ 'twas Pelisson; did you not, Pelisson?\"    Pelisson, again absorbed in his work, took good care not to answer.    \"But if Pelisson said you were so,\" cried Moliere, \"Pelisson has  seriously offended you.\"    \"Do you think so?\"    \"Ah! I advise you, as you are a gentleman, not to leave an insult like  that unpunished.\"    \"_What!_\" exclaimed La Fontaine.    \"Did you ever fight?\"    \"Once only, with a lieutenant in the light horse.\"    \"What wrong had he done you?\"    \"It seems he ran away with my wife.\"    \"Ah, ah!\" said Moliere, becoming slightly pale; but as, at La Fontaine's  declaration, the others had turned round, Moliere kept upon his lips the  rallying smile which had so nearly died away, and continuing to make La  Fontaine speak--    \"And what was the result of the duel?\"    \"The result was, that on the ground my opponent disarmed me, and then  made an apology, promising never again to set foot in my house.\"    \"And you considered yourself satisfied?\" said Moliere.    \"Not at all! on the contrary, I picked up my sword. 'I beg your pardon,  monsieur,' I said, 'I have not fought you because you were my wife's  friend, but because I was told I ought to fight. So, as I have never  known any peace save since you made her acquaintance, do me the pleasure  to continue your visits as heretofore, or _morbleu!_ let us set to  again.' And so,\" continued La Fontaine, \"he was compelled to resume his  friendship with madame, and I continue to be the happiest of husbands.\"    All burst out laughing. Moliere alone passed his hand across his eyes.  Why? Perhaps to wipe away a tear, perhaps to smother a sigh. Alas! we  know that Moliere was a moralist, but he was not a philosopher. \"'Tis  all one,\" he said, returning to the topic of the conversation, \"Pelisson  has insulted you.\"    \"Ah, truly! I had already forgotten it.\"    \"And I am going to challenge him on your behalf.\"    \"Well, you can do so, if you think it indispensable.\"    \"I do think it indispensable, and I am going to--\"    \"Stay,\" exclaimed La Fontaine, \"I want your advice.\"    \"Upon what? this insult?\"    \"No; tell me really now whether _lumiere_ does not rhyme with  _orniere_.\"    \"I should make them rhyme.\"    \"Ah! I knew you would.\"    \"And I have made a hundred thousand such rhymes in my time.\"    \"A hundred thousand!\" cried La Fontaine. \"Four times as many as 'La  Pucelle,' which M. Chaplain is meditating. Is it also on this subject,  too, that you have composed a hundred thousand verses?\"    \"Listen to me, you eternally absent-minded creature,\" said Moliere.    \"It is certain,\" continued La Fontaine, \"that _legume_, for instance,  rhymes with _posthume_.\"    \"In the plural, above all.\"    \"Yes, above all in the plural, seeing that then it rhymes not with three  letters, but with four; as _orniere_ does with _lumiere_.\"    \"But give me _ornieres_ and _lumieres_ in the plural, my dear Pelisson,\"  said La Fontaine, clapping his hand on the shoulder of his friend, whose  insult he had quite forgotten, \"and they will rhyme.\"    \"Hem!\" coughed Pelisson.    \"Moliere says so, and Moliere is a judge of such things; he declares he  has himself made a hundred thousand verses.\"    \"Come,\" said Moliere, laughing, \"he is off now.\"    \"It is like _rivage_, which rhymes admirably with _herbage_. I would  take my oath of it.\"    \"But--\" said Moliere.    \"I tell you all this,\" continued La Fontaine, \"because you are preparing  a _divertissement_ for Vaux, are you not?\"    \"Yes, the 'Facheux.'\"    \"Ah, yes, the 'Facheux;' yes, I recollect. Well, I was thinking a  prologue would admirably suit your _divertissement_.\"    \"Doubtless it would suit capitally.\"    \"Ah! you are of my opinion?\"    \"So much so, that I have asked you to write this very prologue.\"    \"You asked _me_ to write it?\"    \"Yes, you, and on your refusal begged you to ask Pelisson, who is  engaged upon it at this moment.\"    \"Ah! that is what Pelisson is doing, then? I'faith, my dear Moliere, you  are indeed often right.\"    \"When?\"    \"When you call me absent-minded. It is a monstrous defect; I will cure  myself of it, and do your prologue for you.\"    \"But inasmuch as Pelisson is about it!--\"    \"Ah, true, miserable rascal that I am! Loret was indeed right in saying  I was a poor"]]]
