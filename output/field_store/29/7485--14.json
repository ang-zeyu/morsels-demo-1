The more you know, the greater  is your power to help.    The next question that arises is: \"Why does he not divide all  feelings into pleasurable and not-pleasurable, rather than into  'painful and not-painful'?\" A Westerner will not be at a loss to  answer that: \"Oh, the Hindu is naturally so very pessimistic,  that he naturally ignores pleasure and speaks of painful and  not-painful. The universe is full of pain.\" But that would not be  a true answer. In the first place the Hindu is not pessimistic.  He is the most optimistic of men. He has not got one solitary  school of philosophy that does not put in its foreground that the  object of all philosophy is to put an end to pain. But he is  profoundly reasonable. He knows that we need not go about seeking  happiness. It is already ours, for it is the essence of our own  nature. Do not the Upanishads say: \"The Self is bliss\"? Happiness  exists perennially within you. It is your normal state. You have  not to seek it. You will necessarily be happy if you get rid of  the obstacles called pain, which are in the modes of mind.  Happiness is not a secondary thing, but pain is, and these  painful things are obstacles to be got rid of. When they are  stopped, you must be happy. Therefore Patanjali says: \"The  vrittis are painful and non-painful.\" Pain is an excrescence. It  is a transitory thing. The Self, who is bliss, being the  all-permeating life of the universe, pain has no permanent place  in it. Such is the Hindu position, the most optimistic in the  world.    Let us pause for a moment to ask: \"Why should there be pain at  all if the Self is bliss?\" Just because the nature of the Self is  bliss. It would be impossible to make the Self turn outward, come  into manifestation, if only streams of bliss flowed in on him. He  would have remained unconscious of the streams. To the infinity  of bliss nothing could be added. If you had a stream of water  flowing unimpeded in its course, pouring more water into it would  cause no ruffling, the stream would go on heedless of the  addition. But put an obstacle in the way, so that the free flow  is checked, and the stream will struggle and fume against the  obstacle, and make every endeavour to sweep it away. That which  is contrary to it, that which will check its current's smooth  flow, that alone will cause effort. That is the first function of  pain. It is the only thing that can rouse the Self. It is the  only thing that can awaken his attention. When that peaceful,  happy, dreaming, inturned Self finds the surge of pain beating  against him, he awakens: \"What is this, contrary to my nature,  antagonistic and repulsive, what is this?\" It arouses him to the  fact of a surrounding universe, an outer world. Hence in  psychology, in yoga, always basing itself on the ultimate  analysis of the fact of nature, pain is the thing that asserts  itself as the most important factor in Self-realisation; that  which is other than the Self will best spur the Self into  activity. Therefore we find our commentator, when dealing with  pain, declares that the karmic receptacle the causal body, that  in which all the seeds of karma are gathered Up, has for its  builder all painful experiences; and along that line of thought  we come to the great generalisation: the first function of pain  in the universe is to arouse the Self to turn himself to the  outer world, to evoke his aspect of activity.    The next function of pain is the organisation of the vehicles.  Pain makes the man exert himself, and by that exertion the matter  of his vehicles gradually becomes organised. If you want to  develop and organise your muscles, you make efforts, you exercise  them, and thus more life flows into them and they become strong.  Pain is necessary that the Self may force his vehicles into  making efforts which develop and organise them. Thus pain not  only awakens awareness, it also organises the vehicles.    It has a third function also. Pain purifies. We try to get rid of  that which causes us pain. It is contrary to our nature, and we  endeavour to throw it away. All that is against the blissful  nature of the Self is shaken by pain out of the vehicles; slowly  they become purified by suffering, and in that way become ready  for the handling of the Self.    It has a fourth function. Pain teaches. All the best lessons of  life come from pain rather than from joy. When one is becoming  old, as I am and I look on the long life behind me, a life of  storm and stress, of difficulties and efforts, I see something of  the great lessons pain can teach. Out of my life story could  efface without regret everything that it has had of joy and  happiness, but not one pain would I let go, for pain is the  teacher of wisdom.      It has a fifth function. Pain gives power. Edward Carpenter said,  in his splendid poem of \"Time and Satan,\" after he had described  the wrestlings and the overthrows: 'Every pain that I suffered in  one body became a power which I wielded in the next.\" Power is  pain transmuted.    Hence the wise man, knowing these things, does not shrink from  pain; it means purification, wisdom, power.    It is true that a man may suffer so much pain that for this  incarnation he may be numbed by it, rendered wholly or partially  useless. Especially is this the case when the pain has deluged in  childhood. But even then, he shall reap his harvest of good  later. By his past, he may have rendered present pain inevitable,  but none the less can he turn it into a golden opportunity by  knowing and utilising its functions.    You may say: \"What use then of pleasure, if pain is so splendid a  thing?\" From pleasure comes illumination. Pleasure enables the  Self to manifest. In pleasure all the vehicles of the Self are  made harrnonious; they all vibrate together; the vibrations are  rhythmical, not jangled as they are in pain, and those rhythmical  vibrations permit that expansion of the Self of which I spoke,  and thus lead up to illumination, the knowledge of the Self. And  if that be true, as it is true, you will see that pleasure plays  an immense part in nature, being of the nature of the Self,  belonging to him. When it harmonises the vehicles of the Self  from outside, it enables the Self more readily to manifest  himself through the lower selves within us. Hence happiness is a  condition of illumination. That is the explanation of the value  of the rapture of the mystic; it is an intense joy. A tremendous  wave of bliss, born of love triumphant, sweeps over the whole of  his being, and when that great wave of bliss sweeps over him, it  harmonises the whole of his vehicles, subtle and gross alike, and  the glory of the Self is made manifest and he sees the face of  his God. Then comes the wonderful illumination, which for the  time makes him unconscious of all the lower worlds. It is because  for a moment the Self is realising himself as divine, that it is  possible for him to see that divinity which is cognate to  himself. So you should not fear joy any more than you fear pain,  as some unwise people do, dwarfed by a mistaken religionism. That  foolish thought which you often find in an ignorant religion,  that pleasure is rather to be dreaded, as though God grudged joy  to His children, is one of the nightmares born of ignorance and  terror. The Father of life is bliss. He who is joy cannot grudge  Himself to His children, and every reflection of joy in the world  is a reflection of the Divine Life, and a manifestation of the  Self in the midst of matter. Hence pleasure has its function as  well as pain and that also is welcome to the wise, for he  understands and utilises it. You can easily see how along this  line pleasure and pain become equally welcome. Identified with  neither, the wise man takes either as it comes, knowing its  purpose. When we understand the places of joy and of pain, then  both lose their power to bind or to upset us. If pain comes, we  take it and utilise it. If joy comes, we take it and utilise it.  So we may pass through life, welcoming both pleasure and pain,  content whichever may come to us, and not wishing for that which  is for the moment absent. We use both as means to a desired end;  and thus we may rise to a higher indifference than that of the  stoic, to the true vairagya; both pleasure and pain are  transcended, and the Self remains, who is bliss.          LECTURE IV    YOGA AS PRACTICE        In dealing with the third section of the subject, I drew your  attention to the states of mind, and pointed out to you that,  according to the Samskrit word vritti, those states of mind  should be regarded as ways m which the mind exists, or, to use  the philosophical phrase of the West, they are modes of mind,  modes of mental existence. These are the states which are to be  inhibited, put an end to, abolished, reduced into absolute  quiescence. The reason for this inhibition is the production of a  state which allows the higher mind to pour itself into the lower.  To put it in another way: the lower mind, unruffled, waveless,  reflects the higher, as a waveless lake reflects the stars. You  will remember the phrase used in the Upanishad, which puts it  less technically and scientifically, but more beautifully, and  declares that in the quietude of the mind and the tranquility of  the senses, a man may behold the majesty of the Self. The method  of producing this quietude is what we have now to consider.          Inhibition of States of Mind        Two ways, and two ways only, there are of inhibiting these modes,  these ways of existence, of the mind. They were given by Sri  Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita, when Arjuna complained that the  mind was impetuous, strong, difficult to bend, hard to curb as  the wind. His answer was definite: \" Without doubt, O  mighty-armed, the mind is hard to curb and restless; but it may  be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4294"],[0,"Tales of Aztlan; The Romance of a Hero of Our Late Spanish-American War, (#14)"],[1,"and  camped with us over night. There were three men in this outfit.  Keen-looking, hearty old chaps with ruddy faces and gray beards, they  looked like men who are continually prospecting for the \"main chance.\"  I passed a delightful evening in their company. They said they owned  rich silver mines farther up on Lynx Creek, and had come out from town  to perform the annual assessment work on their claims, as prescribed by  the laws of the United States, in order to hold possession and perfect  legal title to the ground. As I was not versed in matters pertaining to  the mines, I asked why they did not work their mines continually for  the silver. They explained that they could not work to good advantage  for lack of transportation facilities which made it very difficult and  costly to bring in machinery for developing their prospects into mines.  Therefore, until the advent of railroads they chose to perform their  annual assessment work only.    Two of these gentlemen were substantial business men and the other was  their confidential secretary or affidavit man. It was his duty to make  an affidavit before a magistrate that his employers had performed the  labor required by law, which is not less than one hundred dollars per  claim and incidentally he cooked for the outfit and attended to the  horses. Of course, they might have hired mine laborers to do this work,  but they said they enjoyed the outing and exercise, especially as this  was the time of house cleaning and they were glad to get away from  home. \"Yes,\" affirmed the affidavit man, \"and so are your wives.\"    These gentlemen rode horses and carried a supply of provisions on a  pack mule. The most conspicuous object of their pack was a keg labelled  \"dynamite.\" When the clerk placed this dangerous thing near the fire  and sat on it, I became fidgety, but was reassured when subsequently I  saw him draw the stopper and fill a bottle labelled \"Old Crow\" from it.  They advised me to go prospecting and gave me much valuable information  and kindly offered to sell me a prospecting outfit, \"for cash,\" at  their stores.    As we were chatting, I became aware of a delicious, pungent odor, like  the perfume of orange blossoms. \"Is it possible,\" said I, astonished,  \"that there are orange groves in bloom in this vicinity?\" The old  gentlemen said they did not smell anything wrong, but the clerk jumped  to his feet and sniffed the air in the direction of Prescott. \"Why,  gentlemen,\" said he, \"of course, you cannot smell any further than the  blossoms on the tips of your noses, but the young man has a sharp  proboscis, he scents the girls. Here comes Dan bound for the Silver  Bell Mine with his blooming show.\" We heard the clatter of hoofs and  wheels and saw a large coach pass by, crowded with passengers, mostly  ladies. The clerk said that the genial owner of the Silver Bell Mine,  who was also the proprietor of a popular resort in town, was going out  to pay his miners their monthly wage. \"That is it,\" said one of the  merchants, \"and to keep the boys from leaving the mine in order to  spend their money at his resort in town, he takes his variety show out  there. He cannot afford to have his mine shut down just now, as they  have struck horn silver, and that is the kind of tin he needs in his  business.\"    These kind old gentlemen cautioned me to keep away from a dark-looking,  broken mountain, looming to the north. \"That country is no good,\" they  said; \"there is nothing but copper there, even the water is poisoned  with it.\" Those were the black hills where there is now the prosperous  town of Jerome and one of the great mines of the earth, the famous  United Verde Mine, the property of Senator William Clark.    The following day, about noon, we rounded a sharp bend of the road and  Fort Whipple and the town of Prescott came into view. A pretty and  gratifying sight truly, but imagine my astonishment! Here to the right  was the identical mysterious hill which I had seen in that memorable  night from the height of the Mogollon mesa and behind it was the black  range, the Sierra Prieta, which had formed a part of the encircling  horseshoe.    Never in my lifetime have I come to a town where the people were as  hospitable and kindly disposed toward strangers as here. It is no  wonder that I got no farther, for here the people vied with each other  to welcome the wayfarer to the gates of their city. The town was then  young and isolated. The inhabitants had come by teams or horseback from  as far away as the State of Kansas, where the nearest railway  connection was eastward, or from California, via Yuma and Ehrenberg on  the Colorado River. Stages and freight teams made regular trips across  the arid desert to Ehrenberg. The first settlers of this region came  from California in search of gold. They first found it in the sands of  the Hassayampa, which is born of mighty Mount Union, the mother of four  living streams. From its deathbed in the hot sands of the desert, they  traced the precious waters to its source. Gold they found in plenty  with hardship and privation. They encountered a band of hostile  Indians, and hardest to bear, a loneliness made sufferable only by the  illusive phantasies of the golden fever. Their expectations realized,  the majority of these pioneers returned to the Golden State and  civilization with the burden of their treasure, saying they had not  come to Arizona for their health. Now in these present days there comes  a throng of people in quest of health solely, and many are they who  find its blessing in the sunny and bracing air of this climate, in hot  springs and the balmy breath of the fir and juniper of our mountains. I  found employment in a mercantile establishment of this little mining  town and grew up with the country, as the saying is. I formed new  acquaintances and made new friends. Among others, I met William Owen  O'Neill. I cannot now remember the exact time or year. Attracted by the  light-hearted, cheerful, and dare-devil spirit of this ambitious and  cultured young man, I joined a military organization, of which he was  then a lieutenant and later the captain, this was Company F of Prescott  Grays, National Guard of Arizona. Poor, noble-hearted, generous  Buckie--he knew it not, but this was his first step on the path of  glory leading to the altar of patriotism whereon he laid his life. It  was he who, with a poet's inspiration, first divined the mystery of the  mountain which I have before alluded to. He likened this beautiful  mound to a sleeping lion who guarded the destinies of the mountain  city. Poor friend, his glorious song stirred the dormant life in the  metallic veins of the Butte and, wonder of wonders, the sleeping lion  awoke, the poet's lay had brought the Sphinx to life--the die of fate  was cast and he had sealed his doom! When I read his beautiful poem, I  gasped in wonder, for only I on earth fathomed the significance of this  revelation. This dream of a poet's fanciful soul, soaring on the wings  of Pegasus, was stern reality to me and anxiously I awaited  developments. Nor waited I in vain.    The grateful Sphinx showered honor and wealth upon my friend. The  generous sportive boy, who cared naught for gold, actually grew rich,  for the Sphinx had granted him the most lucrative office in the county,  the people made him their sheriff. He rose step by step to the highest  place of honor in the community until he became the mayor of Prescott.  Not satisfied with this token of its favor, the Sphinx rewarded him in  a most extraordinary and convincing manner. By the help of nature, its  help-meet, it transformed a great deposit of siliceous limestone into  beautiful onyx and painted it in all the colors and after the pattern  of the rainbow. This magnificent gift made Captain O'Neill  independently rich, but it is a fact that as soon as it passed from his  hands, the stone lost in value and no one has since profited from it. I  believe that our hero would have risen to the highest position of  dignity on earth, the Presidency of the United States, if he had not  unwittingly aroused the jealousy of the terrible heathen god. When he  chose a wife from the lovely maidens of Prescott, then the vengeful  Sphinx laid its sinister plans for his undoing, for it is in the nature  of cats, small or great, to be exceedingly jealous. The furious idol  remembered the people of a long forgotten race, its loyal subjects, who  had reared and worshiped it, inconceivably long ago, when the Grand  Canyon of Arizona was but a tiny ravine and before icy avalanches had  ground the rocks at the Dells into boulders. It remembered the  descendants of its subjects, the Aztec Indians. It remembered how the  Spaniards had cruelly broken the Aztec nation. Through the subtle  influence of psychic forces, it stirred up a passion of hate for Spain  in the hearts of the people of the United States, and it fostered the  awful spirit of strife, and at the right moment it let loose the dogs  of war. One convulsive touch of its rocky claws on the hidden currents  coursing in earth's veins and an evil spark fired the fatal mine under  the battleship Maine, in the harbor of Havana.    \"Is this possible; can this be true?\" If not, why is it that at the  call to arms, even before the nation rallied from the shock of the  cowardly deed which sacrificed the lives of inoffensive sailors--why is  it, I say, that from under the very paws of the Sphinx, so far away in  Arizona--and at the call of Captain O'Neill, the noble mayor of  Prescott, there arose the first contingent of fighting volunteers in  our war with Spain? The inexorable Sphinx had resolved to grant to our  beloved and honored friend its last and most exalted gift, a hero's  death on the field of battle. It has graven the name of Prescott, the  city of the Sphinx, on scrolls of everlasting fame, as the town which  rallied first to the call of the President and as the"]]]
