But while we are still ignorant, and shall perhaps  ever remain so, of the fundamental plan upon which the Galaxy is  organised, recent investigations tend more and more to exhibit it, not  as monarchical (so to speak), but as federative. The community of proper  motions detected by Maedler in the vicinity of the Pleiades may  accordingly possess a significance altogether different from what he  imagined.    Bessel's so-called \"foundation of an Astronomy of the Invisible\" now  claims attention.[95] His prediction regarding the planet Neptune does  not belong to the present division of our subject; a strictly analogous  discovery in the sidereal system was, however, also very clearly  foreshadowed by him. His earliest suspicions of non-uniformity in the  proper motion of Sirius dated from 1834; they extended to Procyon in  1840; and after a series of refined measurements with the new Repsold  circle, he announced in 1844 his conclusion that these irregularities  were due to the presence of obscure bodies round which the two bright  Dog-stars revolved as they pursued their way across the sphere.[96] He  even assigned to each an approximate period of half a century. \"I adhere  to the conviction,\" he wrote later to Humboldt, \"that Procyon and Sirius  form real binary systems, consisting of a visible and an invisible star.  There is no reason to suppose luminosity an essential quality of  cosmical bodies. The visibility of countless stars is no argument  against the invisibility of countless others.\"[97]    An inference so contradictory to received ideas obtained little credit,  until Peters found, in 1851,[98] that the apparent anomalies in the  movements of Sirius could be completely explained by an orbital  revolution in a period of fifty years. Bessel's prevision was destined  to be still more triumphantly vindicated. On the 31st of January, 1862,  while in the act of trying a new 18-inch refractor, Mr. Alvan G. Clark  (one of the celebrated firm of American opticians) actually discovered  the hypothetical Sirian companion in the precise position required by  theory. It has now been watched through nearly an entire revolution  (period 49.4 years), and proves to be very slightly luminous in  proportion to its mass. Its attractive power, in fact, is nearly half  that of its primary, while it emits only 1/10000th of its light. Sirius  itself, on the other hand, possesses a far higher radiative intensity  than our sun. It gravitates--admitting Sir David Gill's parallax of  0.38\" to be exact--like two suns, but shines like twenty. Possibly it is  much distended by heat, and undoubtedly its atmosphere intercepts a very  much smaller proportion of its light than in stars of the solar class.  As regards Procyon, visual verification was awaited until November 13,  1896, when Professor Schaeberle, with the great Lick refractor, detected  the long-sought object in the guise of a thirteenth-magnitude star. Dr.  See's calculations[99] showed it to possess one-fifth the mass of its  primary, or rather more than half that of our sun.[100] Yet it gives  barely 1/20000th of the sun's light, so that it is still nearer to total  obscurity than the dusky satellite of Sirius. The period of forty years  assigned to the system by Auwers in 1862[101] appears to be singularly  exact.    But Bessel was not destined to witness the recognition of \"the  invisible\" as a legitimate and profitable field for astronomical  research. He died March 17, 1846, just six months before the discovery  of Neptune, of an obscure disease, eventually found to be occasioned by  an extensive fungus-growth in the stomach. The place which he left  vacant was not one easy to fill. His life's work might be truly  described as \"epoch-making.\" Rarely indeed shall we find one who  reconciled with the same success the claims of theoretical and practical  astronomy, or surveyed the science which he had made his own with a  glance equally comprehensive, practical, and profound.    The career of Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve illustrates the maxim that  science _differentiates_ as it develops. He was, while much besides, a  specialist in double stars. His earliest recorded use of the telescope  was to verify Herschel's conclusion as to the revolving movement of  Castor, and he never varied from the predilection which this first  observation at once indicated and determined. He was born at Altona, of  a respectable yeoman family, April 15, 1793, and in 1811 took a degree  in philology at the new Russian University of Dorpat. He then turned to  science, was appointed in 1813 to a professorship of astronomy and  mathematics, and began regular work in the Dorpat Observatory just  erected by Parrot for Alexander I. It was not, however, until 1819 that  the acquisition of a 5-foot refractor by Troughton enabled him to take  the position-angles of double stars with regularity and tolerable  precision. The resulting catalogue of 795 stellar systems gave the  signal for a general resumption of the Herschelian labours in this  branch. His success, so far, and the extraordinary facilities for  observation afforded by the Fraunhofer achromatic encouraged him to  undertake, February 11, 1825, a review of the entire heavens down to 15  deg. south of the celestial equator, which occupied more than two years,  and yielded, from an examination of above 120,000 stars, a harvest of  about 2,200 previously unnoticed composite objects. The ensuing ten  years were devoted to delicate and patient measurements, the results of  which were embodied in _Mensurae Micrometricae_, published at St.  Petersburg in 1837. This monumental work gives the places, angles of  position, distances, colours, and relative brightness of 3,112 double  and multiple stars, all determined with the utmost skill and care. The  record is one which gains in value with the process of time, and will  for ages serve as a standard of reference by which to detect change or  confirm discovery.    It appears from Struve's researches that about one in forty of all stars  down to the ninth magnitude is composite, but that the proportion is  doubled in the brighter orders.[102] This he attributed to the  difficulty of detecting the faint companions of very remote orbs. It was  also noticed, both by him and Bessel, that double stars are in general  remarkable for large proper motions. Struve's catalogue included no star  of which the components were more than 32\" apart, because beyond that  distance the chances of merely optical juxtaposition become  considerable; but the immense preponderance of extremely close over (as  it were) loosely yoked bodies is such as to demonstrate their physical  connection, even if no other proof were forthcoming. Many stars  previously believed to be single divided under the scrutiny of the  Dorpat refractor; while in some cases, one member of a supposed binary  system revealed itself as double, thus placing the surprised observer in  the unexpected presence of a triple group of suns. Five instances were  noted of two pairs lying so close together as to induce a conviction of  their mutual dependence;[103] besides which, 124 examples occurred of  triple, quadruple, and multiple combinations, the reality of which was  open to no reasonable doubt.[104]    It was first pointed out by Bessel that the fact of stars exhibiting a  common proper motion might serve as an unfailing test of their real  association into systems. This was, accordingly, one of the chief  criteria employed by Struve to distinguish true binaries from merely  optical couples. On this ground alone, 61 Cygni was admitted to be a  genuine double star; and it was shown that, although its components  appeared to follow almost strictly rectilinear paths, yet the  probability of their forming a connected pair is actually greater than  that of the sun rising to-morrow morning.[105] Moreover, this tie of an  identical movement was discovered to unite bodies[106] far beyond the  range of distance ordinarily separating the members of binary systems,  and to prevail so extensively as to lead to the conclusion that single  do not outnumber conjoined stars more than twice or thrice.[107]    In 1835 Struve was summoned by the Emperor Nicholas to superintend the  erection of a new observatory at Pulkowa, near St. Petersburg, destined  for the special cultivation of sidereal astronomy. Boundless resources  were placed at his disposal, and the institution created by him was  acknowledged to surpass all others of its kind in splendour, efficiency,  and completeness. Its chief instrumental glory was a refractor of  fifteen inches aperture by Merz and Mahler (Fraunhofer's successors),  which left the famous Dorpat telescope far behind, and remained long  without a rival. On the completion of this model establishment, August  19, 1839, Struve was installed as its director, and continued to fulfil  the important duties of the post with his accustomed vigour until 1858,  when illness compelled his virtual resignation in favour of his son Otto  Struve, born at Dorpat in 1819. He died November 23, 1864.    An inquiry into the laws of stellar distribution, undertaken during the  early years of his residence at Pulkowa, led Struve to confirm in the  main the inferences arrived at by Herschel as to the construction of the  heavens. According to his view, the appearance known as the Milky Way is  produced by a collection of irregularly condensed star-clusters, within  which the sun is somewhat eccentrically placed. The nebulous ring which  thus integrates the light of countless worlds was supposed by him to be  made up of stars scattered over a bent or \"broken plane,\" or to lie in  two planes slightly inclined to each other, our system occupying a  position near their intersection.[108] He further attempted to show that  the limits of this vast assemblage must remain for ever shrouded from  "]]]
