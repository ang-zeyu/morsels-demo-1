They  were too much interested in making their legs work properly, for their  knees were still rather weak, and were apt to give out all of a sudden,  and to let a fellow sit down when he didn't want to. And the dry leaves  and little sticks kept sliding around under one's feet so that one never  knew what was going to happen next. It was very different from the  hollow tree, and they were glad when their mother picked them up one at  a time by the back of the neck, carried them home, gave them their  supper, and told them to lie still and take a nap while she went after  another rabbit.    But they had really done very well, considering that it was their first  day out. One of them in particular was very smart and precocious, and  she had taken much pleasure in watching the independent way in which he  went staggering about, looking for impressions. And the other was not  far behind him. Her long hours of still-hunting had brought their rich  reward, and her babies were all that she could ask.    She was in the habit of occasionally bringing something home for them to  play with--a wood-mouse, perhaps, or a squirrel, or a partridge, or even  a larger animal; and they played with it with a vengeance, shaking and  worrying it, and spitting and growling and snarling over it in the most  approved fashion. And you should have seen them the first time they saw  their mother catch a rabbit. They did not try to help her, for she had  told them not to, but they watched her as if it was a matter of life and  death--as, indeed, it was, but not to them. The rabbit was nibbling some  tender young sprouts. The old lynx crept up behind him very quietly and  stealthily, and the kittens' eyes stuck out farther and farther as they  saw her gradually work up within leaping distance. They nearly jumped  out of their skins with excitement when at last she gave a bound and  landed with both forepaws on the middle of his back. And when the rabbit  screamed out in his fright and pain, they could not contain themselves  any longer, but rushed in and helped finish him. They seemed to  understand the game as perfectly as if they had been practising it for  years. I suppose that was where their tendencies came in.    A few days later they had another experience--or at least one of them  did. Their mother happened to see two little wood-mice run under a  small, half-decayed log, and she put her forefeet against it and rolled  it half-way over; and then, while she held it there, the larger  Kitten--the one who had made the better record the day they first left  the den--thrust his paw under and grabbed one of them. The other mouse  got away, but I don't think the Kitten cared very much. He had made his  first kill, and that was glory enough for one day.    From wood-mice the kittens progressed to chipmunks, and from them to  larger game. With use and exercise their soft baby muscles grew hard and  strong, and it was not long before they were able to follow the old lynx  almost anywhere, to the tops of the tallest trees, over the roughest  ground, and through the densest thickets. And they learned other things  besides how to walk and climb and hunt. Their mother was a good teacher  and a rather rigid disciplinarian, and very early in life they were  taught that they must obey promptly and without question, and that on  certain occasions it was absolutely necessary to keep perfectly still  and not make the slightest sound. For instance, there was the time when  the whole family lay sprawled out on a limb of a tree, fifteen or  twenty feet up from the ground, and watched the land-looker go by with  his half-axe over his shoulder, his compass in his hand, and a note-book  sticking out of his pocket. They were so motionless, and the grayish  color of their fur matched so well with the bark of the tree, that he  never saw them, although for a moment they were right over his head, and  could have leaped to his shoulders as easily as not.    In short, the kittens were learning to take care of themselves, and it  was well that they were, for one day their mother was taken from them in  a strange, sad way, and there was nothing they could do but cry, and try  to follow her, and at last see her pass out of sight, still looking back  and calling to them pitifully. It was the river that carried her off,  and it was a floating saw-log that she rode upon, an unwilling  passenger. The trouble began with a steel trap, just as it did in their  father's case. Traps are not nearly as much to be feared in summer or  early fall as in winter, for the simple reason that one's fur is not as  valuable in warm weather as in cold. The lynx's, for instance, was  considerably shorter and thinner than it had been in the preceding  December, when she and her mate first met, and it had taken on a  reddish tinge, as if the steel had begun to rust a trifle. But the  killing machines are to be found occasionally at all seasons of the  year, and somebody had set this one down by the edge of the water--not  the Glimmerglass, but a branch of the Tahquamenon River--and had chained  it to a log that had been hung up in last spring's drive. When she first  felt its grip on her leg she yelled and tore around just as her mate had  done, while the kittens looked on in wonder and amazement. They had seen  their mother in many moods, but never in one like this. But by and by  she grew weary, and a little later it began to rain. She was soon  soaking wet, and as the hours dragged on every ounce of courage and  gumption seemed to ooze out of her. If the trapper had come then he  would have found her very meek and limp. Possibly she would have been  ready to fight him for her children's sakes, but nothing else could have  nerved her to it. But she was not put to any such test; the trapper did  not come.    It rained very hard, and it rained very long. In fact it had been  raining most of the time for two or three days before the lynx found the  trap, and in a few more hours the Great Tahquamenon Swamp was as full  of water as a soaked sponge, and the river was rising rapidly. The lynx  was soon lying in a puddle, and to get out of it she climbed upon the  log and stretched herself out on the wet, brown bark. Still the river  rose, and by and by the log began to stir in its bed, as if it were  thinking of renewing its voyage. At last, when she had been there nearly  twenty-four hours, and was faint with hunger, as well as cold and wet,  it quietly swung out into the current and drifted away down the stream.  She was an excellent swimmer, and she promptly jumped overboard and  tried to reach the shore, but of course the chain put a stop to that.  Weakened by fasting, and borne down by the weight of the trap, she came  very near drowning before she could scramble up again over the end of  the log and seat herself amidships.    The kittens were foraging among the bushes, but she called to them in a  tone which told them plainly enough that some new trouble had befallen  her, and they hurried down to the water's edge, and stood there, mewing  piteously. She implored them to follow her, and after much persuasion  the bigger and bolder of the two plunged bravely in. But he didn't get  very far. It was very cold and very wet, and he wasn't used to  swimming. Besides, the water got into his nose and made him sneeze,  which distracted his attention so that for a moment he forgot all about  his mother, and just turned around and hustled back to the shore as fast  as he could go. After that he, contented himself with following along  the bank and keeping as near her as he could. Once the log drifted in so  close that she thought she could jump ashore, and the Kitten watched  eagerly as she gathered herself for the spring. But the chain was too  short, and she fell into the water. Her forepaw just grazed the  grass-tuft where the Kitten was standing, and for an instant she felt  the blades slipping between her toes; but the next moment she was  swimming for the log again, and the Kitten was mewing his sympathy at  the top of his voice.    They journeyed on for nearly an hour longer, she on her prison-ship, and  he on land; and then, before either of them knew just what had happened,  the little tributary had emptied itself into the main stream of the  Tahquamenon, and they suddenly realized that they were much farther  apart than they had been at any time before. This new river was several  times as broad as the one on which the voyage had begun, and the wind  was steadily carrying her away from the shore, while the current bore  her resistlessly on in its long, slow voyage to Lake Superior. She was  still calling to him, but her voice was growing fainter and fainter in  the distance, and so, at last, she passed out of his sight and hearing  forever.    [Illustration: \"_He was a very presentable young lynx._\"]    And then, for the first time, he missed his brother. The other kitten  had always been a trifle the slower of the two, and in some way he had  dropped behind. Our friend was alone in the world.    But the same river that had carried his mother away brought him a little  comfort in his desolation, for down by the water's edge, cast up on the  sand by a circling eddy, he found a dead sucker. He ate it with relish,  and felt better in spite of himself. It made a very large meal for a  lynx of his size, and by the time he had finished it he began to be  drowsy, so he picked out the driest spot he could find, under the thick  branches of a large hemlock, and curled himself up on the brown needles  and went to sleep.    The next day he had to hustle for a living, and the next it was the  same, and the next, and the next. As the weeks and the months went by  there was every indication that life would be little else than one long  hustle--or perhaps a short one--and in spite of all he could do there  were times when he was very near the end of the chapter. But his  mother's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27975"],[0,"Delineations of the Ox Tribe: The Natural History of Bulls, Bisons, and (#14)"],[1," on its back that  instant, with its feet turned up in the air, and all its entrails  hanging out, in which state it lived almost half an hour. The gardener  and the sergeant, in the meantime, had climbed up into trees, where  they thought themselves secure. The Buffalo, after this first  achievement, still appeared to take his course in the same direction,  and, therefore, could not have failed in his way to pay his compliments  to me, who all the while was coming towards him, and, in the narrow pass  formed by the boughs and branches of the trees, and on account of the  rustling noise these made against my saddle and baggage, had neither  seen nor heard anything of what had passed; as in my way I frequently  stopped to take up plants, and put them into my handkerchief, I  generally kept behind my companions.    \"The sergeant had brought two horses with him for the journey. One of  them had already been despatched, and the other now stood just in the  way of the Buffalo, who was going out of the wood. As soon as the  Buffalo saw this second horse, he became more outrageous than before,  and he attacked it with such fury, that he not only drove his horns into  the horse's breast, and out again through the very saddle, but also  threw it to the ground with such violence, that it died that very  instant, and most of its bones were broken. Just at the moment that he  was occupied with this latter horse, I came up to the opening, where the  wood was so thick that I had neither room to turn my horse, nor to get  on one side; I was, therefore, obliged to abandon him to his fate, and  take refuge in a tolerably high tree, up which I climbed.    \"The Buffalo, having finished this his second exploit, suddenly turned  round, and shaped his course the same way which we had intended to take.    \"From the height of my situation in the tree, I could plainly perceive  one of the horses quite dead; the other sprawling with his feet, and  endeavouring to rise, which it had not strength to do; the other two  horses shivering with fear, and unable to make their escape; but I could  neither see nor hear anything of my fellow-travellers, which induced me  to fear that they had fallen victims to the first transports of the  Buffalo's fury. I, therefore, made all possible haste to search for  them, to see if I could, in any way, assist them; but not discovering  any trace of them in the whole field of battle, I began to call out  after them, when I discovered these magnanimous heroes sitting fast,  like two cats, on the trees, with their guns on their backs, loaded with  fine shot, and unable to utter a single word.    \"I encouraged them as well as I could, and advised them to come down,  and get away as fast as possible from such a dangerous place, where we  ran the risk of being once more attacked. The sergeant at length burst  out into tears, deploring the loss of his two spirited steeds; but the  gardener was so strongly affected, that he could scarcely speak for some  days after.\"    Speaking of a small settlement in the interior, he says: \"Buffaloes were  shot here by a Hottentot, who had been trained to the business by the  farmer, and in this manner found the whole family in meat, without  having recourse to the herd. The balls were counted out to him every  time he went a shooting, and he was obliged to furnish the same number  of dead Buffaloes as he received of balls. Thus the many Hottentots that  lived here were supported without expense, and without the decrease of  the tame cattle which constitute the whole of the farmer's wealth. The  greatest part of the flesh of the Buffalo falls to the share of the  Hottentots, but the hide to that of the master.\"    [Illustration: Young Cape Buffalo.]    The Caffres, who at that time (1772) did not possess fire-arms, were,  nevertheless, dextrous in the use of their javelins. When a Caffre has  discovered a spot where several Buffaloes are assembled, he blows a  pipe, made of the thigh-bone of a sheep, which is heard at a great  distance. In consequence of this, several of his comrades run up to the  spot, and surrounding the Buffaloes, at the same time approaching them  by degrees, throw their javelins at them. In this case, out of ten or  twelve Buffaloes, it is very rare for one to escape. It sometimes  happens, however, that while the Buffaloes are running off, some one of  the hunters, who stands in the way of them, is tossed and killed, which,  by the people of this nation, is not much regarded. When the chase is  over, each one takes his share of the game.    Since the introduction of fire-arms by the Europeans, the natives, as  well as the colonists, bring down the Buffalo by means of the gun.  Nevertheless, great circumspection is required in following the sport,  as the animal is sometimes capable of revenging himself even after being  severely wounded. On one occasion a party of huntsmen discovered a small  herd of Buffaloes grazing on a piece of marshy ground. As it was  impossible to get near enough without crossing a marsh, which did not  afford a safe footing for their horses, they left them in charge of the  Hottentots, and proceeded on foot, thinking, that if the Buffaloes  should turn upon them, it would be easy to retreat by crossing the  quagmire, which, though firm enough to support a man, would not bear the  weight of a Buffalo. They advanced accordingly, and, under shelter of  the bushes, approached with such advantage, that the first volley  brought down three of the fattest of the herd, and so severely wounded  the great bull leader, that he dropped on his knees, bellowing most  furiously. Supposing him mortally wounded, the foremost of the huntsmen  issued from the covert, and began reloading his musket as he advanced,  to give him a finishing shot; but no sooner did the enraged animal see  his enemy in front of him than he sprang up, and ran furiously upon him.  The man, throwing down his gun, fled towards the quagmire; but the beast  was so close upon him, that, despairing to escape in that direction, he  suddenly turned round a clump of copsewood, and began to ascend a tree.  The raging animal, however, was too quick for him, and bounding forward  with a tremendous roar, he caught the unfortunate man with his terrible  horns, just as he had nearly escaped his reach, and tossed him into the  air with such force, that the body fell dreadfully mangled into the  cleft of a tree. The Buffalo ran round the tree once or twice,  apparently looking for the man, until weakened with loss of blood, he  again sank on his knees. The rest of the party, recovering from their  confusion, then came up and despatched him, though too late to save  their comrade, whose body was hanging in the tree quite dead.    The length of a full-grown Buffalo is about eight feet from horns to  root of tail, and the height five feet and a half. The horns are massive  and heavy, measuring from six to nine feet, following the curve from tip  to tip. They are broad at the base, and very nearly meet on the centre  of the forehead. Hamilton Smith says, they are \"in contact at the base;\"  but this is not the case in the several specimens which I have examined,  namely, three in the College of Surgeons, four in the British Museum,  and two in the Zoological Gardens.    In the living specimen in the Zoological Gardens, from which the figure  at the head of this article was taken, there is a good deal of hair of a  dark brown colour on the neck and shoulders, and some small tufts on the  fore-legs, but the rest of the body is almost naked. The tail is short,  with a tuft at the end.    The individual here referred to is by no means a large specimen, being  only four feet ten inches high at the shoulders; probably he is young,  and not yet full-grown. He is so active, as to be able to clear a  four-feet fence, and he frequently leaps over the half-door (about three  feet high,) which separates his little enclosure from his dormitory. His  intelligence is much superior to that of ordinary cattle: the entrance  to his apartment is furnished with four doors, two on each door-post;  and when closed, they of course meet in the middle of the entrance. When  he is outside, (as the doors all open inwardly,) a mere push with his  horns sends them open. But when he is inside, it requires four distinct  operations to shut them, and these he performs with the greatest  adroitness, going from one to the other, until all are closed. He opens  them also from within with equal skill, by applying the tip of one of  his horns to each separately, and retiring a step or two to allow them  room to open.    The flesh of the Cape Buffalo is reckoned excellent eating, especially  that of the young calf, which is equal to the veal of the domestic calf.  The horns are made into various articles, having a fine close grain, and  taking a beautiful polish. But the hide is the most valuable part of  this animal, being so thick and tough, that shields, proof against a  musket-shot, are formed of it; and it affords the strongest and best  thongs for harness and whips. The skin of the living Buffalo is so  dense that it is impenetrable, in many parts, to an ordinary  musket-ball; the balls used by the huntsmen are, therefore, mixed with  tin, and even these are often flattened by the resistance. In examining  the skeleton of this Buffalo, the ribs are found to be remarkably strong  and wide--measuring from three inches to three inches and seven-tenths  in width, and overlapping each other like the scales of a fish: the  difficulty of wounding this animal may be partly owing to this  arrangement of the ribs.    Since the increase of the settlements about the Cape of Good Hope, the  Buffalo has become rather a rare animal in the colony; but, on the  plains of Caffraria, they are so common that herds of a hundred and  fifty, or two hundred, may be frequently seen grazing together towards  the evening, but during the day they lie "]]]
