From this  period each sporidium seems to have a separate existence. All have a  nucleus, which is scarcely visible, often slightly granular, but which  is quite distinct from the oleaginous sporidioles so frequent amongst  the Discomycetes, and which are sometimes called by the same name. The  sporidia are at first a little smaller than when mature, and are  surrounded by mucilage. After this period the sporidia lose their  nebulous granulations, whilst still preserving their nucleus; their  outlines are distinct, and, amongst the true _Ascobolei_, commence  acquiring a rosy colour, the first intimation of maturity. This colour  manifests itself rapidly, accumulating exclusively upon the epispore,  which becomes of a deep rose, then violet, and finally violet blue, so  deep as sometimes to appear quite black. There are some modifications  in this coloration, since, in some species, it passes from a vinous  red to grey, then to black, or from rose-violet to brown.    The epispore acquires a waxy consistence by this pigmentation, so that  it may be detached in granules. It is to this particular consistency  of the epispore that the cracks so frequent in the coloured sporidia  of _Ascobolus_ are due, through contraction of the epispore. As they  approach maturity, the sporidia accumulate towards the apex of the  asci, and finally escape in the manner already indicated.    In all essential particulars there is a great similarity in the  structure of the other Discomycetes, especially in their reproductive  system. In most of them coloured sporidia are rare. In some the  receptacle is pileate, clavate, or inflated, whilst in _Stictis_ it is  very much reduced, and in the lowest form of all, _Ascomyces_, it is  entirely absent. In the _Phacidiacei_, the structure is very similar  to that of the _Elvellacei_, whilst the _Hysteriacei_, with greater  affinities with the latter, still tend towards the _Pyrenomycetes_ by  the more horny nature of the receptacle, and the greater tendency of  the hymenium to remain closed, at least when dry. In some species of  _Hysterium_, the sporidia are remarkably fine. M. Duby[AA] has  subjected this group to examination, and M. Tulasne partly so.[AB]    SPHAERIACEI.--In this group there is considerable variation, within  certain limits. It contains an immense number of species, and these  are daily being augmented. The general feature in all is the  presence of a perithecium, which contains and encloses the hymenium,  and at length opening by a pore or ostiolum at the apex. In some  the perithecia are simple, in others compound; in some immersed in  a stroma, in others free; in some fleshy or waxy, in others  carbonaceous, and in others membranaceous. But in all there is this  important difference from the Ascomycetes we have already had under  consideration, that the hymenium is never exposed. The perithecium  consists usually of an external layer of cellular structure, which  is either smooth or hairy, usually blackish, and an internal  stratum of less compact cells, which give rise to the hymenium.    [Illustration: FIG. 35.--Perithecium of _Sphaeria_ and Section.]    As in the _Discomycetes_, the hymenium consists of asci, paraphyses,  and mucilage, but the whole forms a less compact and more gelatinous  mass within the perithecium. The formation and growth of the asci and  sporidia differ little from what we have described, and when mature  the asci dehisce, and the sporidia alone are ejected from the  ostiolum. We are not aware that operculate asci have yet been  detected. It has been shown in some instances, and suspected in  others, that certain moulds, formerly classed with _Mucedines_ and  _Dematiei_, especially in the genus _Helminthosporium_, bear the  conidia of species of _Sphaeria_, so that this may be regarded as one  form of fruit.    Perithecia, very similar externally to those of _Sphaeria_, but  containing spores borne on slender pedicels and not enclosed in asci,  have had their relations to certain species of _Sphaeria_ indicated,  and these are no longer regarded so much as species of _Hendersonia_  or _Diplodia_ as the pycnidia of _Sphaeria_. Other and more minute  perithecia, containing minute, slender stylospores in great numbers,  formerly classed with _Aposphaeria_, _Phoma_, &c., but are now  recognized as spermogonia containing the spermatia of _Sphaeriae_. How  these influence each other, when and under what circumstances the  spermatia are instrumental in impregnation of the sporidia, is still  matter of mystery. It is clear, however, that in all these conidia,  macrospores, microspores, and some spermatia, or by whatever names  they may be called, there exists a power of germination. Tulasne has  indicated in some instances five or six forms of fruit as belonging to  one fungus, of which the highest and most perfect condition is a  species of _Sphaeria_.    [Illustration: FIG. 36.--_Uncinula adunca._]    PERISPORIACEI.--Except in the perithecia rupturing irregularly, and  not dehiscing by a pore, some of the genera in this group differ  little in structure from the _Sphaeriacei_. On the other hand, the  _Erysiphei_ present important and very interesting features. They  occur chiefly on the green parts of growing plants. At first there is  a more or less profuse white mycelium.[AC] This gives rise to chains  of conidia (_Oidium_), and afterwards small sphaeroid projections  appear at certain points on the mycelium. These enlarge, take an  orange colour, ultimately passing into brown, and then nearly black.  Externally these perithecia are usually furnished with long,  spreading, intertwined, or branching appendages, sometimes beautifully  branched or hooked at their tips. In the interior of the receptacles,  pear-shaped or ovate asci are formed in clusters, attached together at  the base, and containing two or more hyaline sporidia. Other forms of  fruit have also been observed on the same mycelium. In an exotic  genus, _Meliola_, the fulcra, or appendages, as well as the mycelium,  are black, otherwise it is very analogous to such a genus of  _Erysiphei_ as _Microsphaeria_. In _Chaetomium_, the perithecia bristle  with rigid, dark-coloured hairs, and the sporidia are coloured. Our  limits, however, will not permit of further elucidation of the complex  and varied structure to be found amongst fungi.[AD]       [A] A curious case occurred some years since at Bury St. Edmunds,         which may be mentioned here in connection with the development         of these nodules. Two children had died under suspicious         circumstances, and an examination of the body of the latter         after exhumation was made, a report having arisen that the         child died after eating mushrooms. As certain white nodules         appeared on the inner surface of the intestines, it was at once         hastily concluded that the spores of the mushroom had         germinated, and that the nodules were infant mushrooms. This         appeared to one of us so strange, that application was made for         specimens, which were kindly forwarded, and a cursory glance         was enough to convince us that they were not fungoid. An         examination under the microscope further confirmed the         diagnosis, and the application of nitric acid showed that the         nodules were merely due to chalk mixture, which had been given         to the child for the diarrhetic symptoms under which he         succumbed.       [B] Ehrenberg compared the whole structure of an Agaric with that         of a mould, the mycelium corresponding with the hyphasma,         the stem and pileus with the flocci, and the hymenium with         the fructifying branchlets. The comparison is no less         ingenious than true, and gives a lively idea of the connection         of the more noble with the more humble fungi.--_Ehrb. de         Mycetogenesi._       [C] In _Paxillus involutus_ the hymenium may be readily torn off and         unfolded.       [D] This was well delineated in \"Flora Danica,\" plate 834, as         observed in _Coprinus comatus_ as long ago as 1780.

C., \"Anatomy of a Mushroom,\" in \"Popular Science         Review,\" vol. viii. p. 380.       [K] An attempt was made to show that, in _Agaricus melleus_, distinct         asci were found, in a certain stage, on the gills or lamellae.         We have in vain examined the gills in various conditions, and         could never detect anything of the kind. It is probable that         the asci belonged to some species of _Hypomyces_, a genus of         parasitic Sphaeriaceous fungi.       [L] It is not intended that the spores are always quaternate in         _Agaricini_, though that number is constant in the more typical         species. They sometimes exceed four, and are sometimes reduced         to one.       [M] The species long known as _Hydnum gelatinosum_ was examined by         Mr. F. Currey in 1860 (_Journ. Linn. Soc._), and he came to the         conclusion that it was not a good _Hydnum_. Since then it has         been made the type of a new genus (Hydnogl"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30230"],[0,"A Story of the Red Cross; Glimpses of Field Work (#14)"],[1,"thunder  of the guns, Siboney, San Juan, opened the track, and the wounded troops  of our own army, hungering on their own fields, were the reconcentrados  of the hour.    Tampa became the gathering-point of the army. Its camps filled like  magic, first with regulars, then volunteers, as if the fiery torch of  Duncraigen had spread over the hills and prairies of America. The great  ships gathered in the waters, the transports, with decks dark with human  life, passed in and out, and the battleships of the sea held ever their  commanding sway. It seemed a strange thing, this gathering for war.  Thirty years of peace had made it strange to all save the veterans of  the days of the old war, long passed into history. Could it be possible  that we were to learn this anew? Were men again to fall, and women weep?  Were the youth of this generation to gain that experience their fathers  had gained, to live the war-lives they had lived, and die the deaths  they had died?    At length the fleet moved on, and we prepared to move with, or rather  after it. The quest on which it had gone, and the route it had taken,  bordered something on the mystery shrouding the days when Sherman  marched to the sea. Where were the Spanish ships? What would be the  result when found and met? Where were we to break that Cuban wall and  let us in?    Always present in our minds were the food we carried, the willing hands  that waited, and the perishing thousands that needed. We knew the great  hospital ships were fitting for the care of the men of both Army and  Navy. Surely they could have no need of us.    We had taken possession of our ship at Key West on the 29th of April. It  was now the 20th of June and the national records of two countries at  least will always give the history of those days. It is our part to keep  as clearly, truthfully, and kindly as possible, the record of the little  that fell to us to perform in this great drama.    Weighing anchor at Key West the State of Texas steamed for the open  Caribbean, we having first taken the official advice of Commodore Remy  to find Admiral Sampson and report to him.    Sunrise of the twenty-fifth gave us our first view of the water at  Santiago. Our transports and battle-ships were gathered there. The  advice of Admiral Sampson was that we proceed to Guantanamo, where the  marines had made a landing and were camped on the shore. There had been  some fighting at Guantanamo. The naval hospital ship Solace was there.    Whoever has enjoyed this quiet, sheltered harbor, protected on three  sides by beautiful wooded hills, will not require to be reminded of it.  At six o'clock our anchor sunk in the deep, still waters and we had time  to look about and see the beginning of the war. The marines were camped  along the brow of a hill. On our right a camp of Cubans, and all about  us the great war-ships with their guns, which told of forthcoming  trouble. Captain McCalla, who was in command of Guantanamo, had sent his  compliments and a launch, leading us in to our place of anchorage. The  courtesies of the navy so early commenced at Key West were continued  throughout the war.    By invitation of Commander Dunlap our entire company visited the Solace  the following day. If that beautiful ship or its management had left  room on the records of our country's meed of gratitude, for more words  of appreciative praise, I should be glad to speak them. Only those  familiar with the earliest history of the Red Cross in our country, and  the methods by which our navy alone--of all the Red Cross nations--had  gained even an approximately legal place, can judge what the sight of  that first naval relief ship in American waters was to me. It brought  back so vividly the memory of the day in 1881 when President Arthur  called me to him to carefully explain the conditions of the treaty which  he had just signed, and that, Congress having generously included the  navy in its treaty for war, he would provide to hold it carefully until  the probable widening of the original treaty would include the _navies_  of the world, as well as the armies.    Before the day closed news came to us of a serious character. The daring  Rough Riders had been hardly dealt by. Hamilton Fish and Allyn Capron  had been killed, and the wounded needed help. Wherever they might be, it  must be possible to reach them, and it was decided that no time be lost.  Our men commenced work in the hold of the ship to get at medical  supplies and dressings, and the captain took his orders. I find in my  diary at the close of that day the following paragraph: \"It is the Rough  Riders we go to, and the relief may be also rough, but it will be  _ready_. A better body of helpers could scarcely be gotten together.\"    Nine o'clock of the same night found us at Siboney, which can scarcely  be called a harbor, for it has no anchorage. The next morning at  daybreak we stood on deck to see the soldiers filing up over the hill,  in heavy marching order, forming in lines by ones and twos, winding up,  in and out among the hills, higher and higher. As we watched them they  were a moving line trailing on toward the clouds, till lost in the mist,  and we could only think, as we looked at them, on how many and on which,  is set the mark of death? He knew no more than we--poor fellow--and  with his swinging, steady gait, toils up and up and waits for--he knows  not what.    The hospitals, both American and Cuban, located on the shore just to the  right of us, were visited by our men that same evening. Some of their  surgeons called on us. All seemed interested in the Red Cross, but none  thought that a woman nurse would be in place in a soldiers'  hospital--indeed, very much out of place. I suggested that that decision  was hard for me, for I had spent a great deal of time in soldiers'  hospitals myself. They appeared to understand that perfectly, but there  seemed to be a _later_ line which could not be crossed.    The Cubans who had just come into camp expressed a desire for any  assistance we could give them. They would be glad to have the Red Cross  Sisters in their little hospital, but begged us to wait just a day until  it could be put in better order. The Sisters were not the persons to  grant that day of preparation.    On the contrary they at once went to work, thoroughly cleaned the little  three-room building--Garcia's abandoned headquarters, to be used as a  hospital--and when the day closed the transformation showed clean rooms,  clean cots, and the grateful occupants wondering whether Heaven itself  could be more comfortable, or anything more desirable than the palatable  food prepared for them by the Sisters.    Three days later the following letter was received:      \"To MISS CLARA BARTON, President,    \"American National Red Cross:    \"I have the honor to request your assistance in caring for the patients  in a so-called hospital near the landing at this point.    \"The orders are to the effect that all patients now under treatment on  the shore shall be transferred to the Iroquois and Olivette, but the  facilities for carrying out this order are apparently inadequate. In  order that the division hospital may remain unhampered for the care of  the wounded in the engagement about to take place, it is necessary for  me to request this favor of you, and I trust that you may find it  possible to comply with said request.    \"Your obedient servant,    \"LOUIS A. LE GARDE,    \"Major and Surgeon, U. S. A., Commanding  Hospital.\"      To this the following reply was immediately returned:      \"Steamship State of Texas,    \"SIBONEY, SANTIAGO DE CUBA, _June 30, 1898_.    \"DR. LOUIS A. LE GARDE,    \"Major and Surgeon, U. S.

Although not here as a hospital ship by any means--not legitimately  fitted for the work--still we have some hospital supplies, a few  intelligent workers, skill, experience, the willingness to serve, the  readiness to obey, and I believe the true spirit of the Red Cross, that  seeks to help humanity wherever its needs exist. I send them to you in  the hope that they may be of service.    \"Cordially yours,    \"CLARA BARTON,    \"President, American National Red Cross.\"      Our surgeons and assistants went on shore, where Dr. Le Garde and Dr.  Lesser secured a small house, and in a few hours this had undergone the  same transformation and by the same hands as the Cuban hospital. The Red  Cross flag was hoisted, Dr. Lesser placed in charge, and scores of our  soldiers who had been lying on the filthy floors of an adjacent  building, with no food but army rations, were carried over, placed in  clean cots, and given proper food. From that on, no distinction was  made, the Red Cross flag floating over both the American and Cuban  hospitals.    A few feet away, all the available army tents were put up as additional  accommodation for the \"wounded in the engagement about to take place.\"  It did take place the following day, and, as will be well remembered, in  those two days, Friday and Saturday, the first and second of July, the  tents were more than filled with wounded in the battle of San Juan Hill.  Three of the five Sisters went into the operating tent, and with the  surgeons worked for thirty hours with only a few moments' rest now and  then for a cup of coffee and a cracker or piece of bread. We heard  nothing more about a woman nurse being out of place in a soldiers'  hospital.    On Saturday evening, the second day of the San Juan battle, a slip of  paper with these penciled words was brought to the door of the hospital:      \"Send food, medicines, anything. Seize wagons from the front for  transportation.    \"SHAFTER.\"      The call for help was at once sent over to the State of Texas, and we  "]]]
