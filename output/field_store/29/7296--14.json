This simple device brought its owner a fortune. Isaac M. Singer,  destined to be the dominant figure of the industry, patented in 1851  a machine stronger than any of the others and with several valuable  features, notably the vertical presser foot held down by a spring; and  Singer was the first to adopt the treadle, leaving both hands of the  operator free to manage the work. His machine was good, but, rather than  its surpassing merits, it was his wonderful business ability that made  the name of Singer a household word.    By 1856 there were several manufacturers in the field, threatening war  on each other. All men were paying tribute to Howe, for his patent was  basic, and all could join in fighting him, but there were several other  devices almost equally fundamental, and even if Howe's patents had been  declared void it is probable that his competitors would have fought  quite as fiercely among themselves. At the suggestion of George Gifford,  a New York attorney, the leading inventors and manufacturers agreed to  pool their inventions and to establish a fixed license fee for the use  of each. This \"combination\" was composed of Elias Howe, Wheeler and  Wilson, Grover and Baker, and I. M. Singer, and dominated the field  until after 1877, when the majority of the basic patents expired.  The members manufactured sewing machines and sold them in America and  Europe. Singer introduced the installment plan of sale, to bring the  machine within reach of the poor, and the sewing machine agent, with a  machine or two on his wagon, drove through every small town and country  district, demonstrating and selling. Meanwhile the price of the machines  steadily fell, until it seemed that Singer's slogan, \"A machine in every  home!\" was in a fair way to be realized, had not another development of  the sewing machine intervened.    This was the development of the ready-made clothing industry. In the  earlier days of the nation, though nearly all the clothing was of  domestic manufacture, there were tailors and seamstresses in all the  towns and many of the villages, who made clothing to order. Sailors  coming ashore sometimes needed clothes at once, and apparently a  merchant of New Bedford was the first to keep a stock on hand. About  1831, George Opdyke, later Mayor of New York, began the manufacture of  clothing on Hudson Street, which he sold largely through a store in New  Orleans. Other firms began to reach out for this Southern trade, and it  became important. Southern planters bought clothes not only for their  slaves but for their families. The development of California furnished  another large market. A shirt factory was established, in 1832, on  Cherry and Market Streets, New York. But not until the coming of the  power-driven sewing machine could there be any factory production of  clothes on a large scale. Since then the clothing industry has become  one of the most important in the country. The factories have steadily  improved their models and materials, and at the present day only a  negligible fraction of the people of the United States wear clothes made  to their order.    The sewing machine today does many things besides sewing a seam. There  are attachments which make buttonholes, darn, embroider, make ruffles or  hems, and dozens of other things. There are special machines for every  trade, some of which deal successfully with refractory materials.    The Singer machine of 1851 was strong enough to sew leather and was  almost at once adopted by the shoemakers. These craftsmen flourished  chiefly in Massachusetts, and they had traditions reaching back at  least to Philip Kertland, who came to Lynn in 1636 and taught many  apprentices. Even in the early days before machinery, division of labor  was the rule in the shops of Massachusetts. One workman cut the leather,  often tanned on the premises; another sewed the uppers together, while  another sewed on the soles. Wooden pegs were invented in 1811 and came  into common use about 1815 for the cheaper grades of shoes: Soon the  practice of sending out the uppers to be done by women in their own  homes became common. These women were wretchedly paid, and when the  sewing machine came to do the work better than it could be done by hand,  the practice of \"putting out\" work gradually declined.    That variation of the sewing machine which was to do the more difficult  work of sewing the sole to the upper was the invention of a mere boy,  Lyman R. Blake. The first model, completed in 1858, was imperfect, but  Blake was able to interest Gordon McKay, of Boston, and three years  of patient experimentation and large expenditure followed. The McKay  sole-sewing machine, which they produced, came into use, and for  twenty-one years was used almost universally both in the United States  and Great Britain. But this, like all the other useful inventions, was  in time enlarged and greatly improved, and hundreds of other inventions  have been made in the shoe industry. There are machines to split  leather, to make the thickness absolutely uniform, to sew the uppers, to  insert eyelets, to cut out heel tops, and many more. In fact, division  of labor has been carried farther in the making of shoes than in most  industries, for there are said to be about three hundred separate  operations in making a pair of shoes.    From small beginnings great industries have grown. It is a far cry from  the slow, clumsy machine of Elias Howe, less than three-quarters of  a century ago, to the great factories of today, filled with special  models, run at terrific speed by electric current, and performing tasks  which would seem to require more than human intelligence and skill.        CHAPTER V. THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION    The Census of 1920 shows that hardly thirty per cent of the people are  today engaged in agriculture, the basic industry of the United States,  as compared with perhaps ninety per cent when the nation began. Yet  American farmers, though constantly diminishing in proportion to  the whole population, have always been, and still are, able to feed  themselves and all their fellow Americans and a large part of the  outside world as well. They bring forth also not merely foodstuffs, but  vast quantities of raw material for manufacture, such as cotton, wool,  and hides. This immense productivity is due to the use of farm machinery  on a scale seen nowhere else in the world. There is still, and always  will be, a good deal of hard labor on the farm. But invention has  reduced the labor and has made possible the carrying on of this vast  industry by a relatively small number of hands.    The farmers of Washington's day had no better tools than had the  farmers of Julius Caesar's day; in fact, the Roman ploughs were probably  superior to those in general use in America eighteen centuries later.  \"The machinery of production,\" says Henry Adams, \"showed no radical  difference from that familiar in ages long past. The Saxon farmer of the  eighth century enjoyed most of the comforts known to Saxon farmers of  the eighteenth.\"* One type of plough in the United States was little  more than a crooked stick with an iron point attached, sometimes with  rawhide, which simply scratched the ground. Ploughs of this sort were  in use in Illinois as late as 1812. There were a few ploughs designed to  turn a furrow, often simply heavy chunks of tough wood, rudely hewn into  shape, with a wrought-iron point clumsily attached. The moldboard was  rough and the curves of no two were alike. Country blacksmiths made  ploughs only on order and few had patterns. Such ploughs could turn a  furrow in soft ground if the oxen were strong enough--but the friction  was so great that three men and four or six oxen were required to turn a  furrow where the sod was tough.         * \"History of the United States\", vol. I, p. 16.      Thomas Jefferson had worked out very elaborately the proper curves of  the moldboard, and several models had been constructed for him. He was,  however, interested in too many things ever to follow any one to the  end, and his work seems to have had little publicity. The first real  inventor of a practicable plough was Charles Newbold, of Burlington  County, New Jersey, to whom a patent for a cast-iron plough was issued  in June, 1797. But the farmers would have none of it. They said it  \"poisoned the soil\" and fostered the growth of weeds. One David Peacock  received a patent in 1807, and two others later. Newbold sued Peacock  for infringement and recovered damages. Pieces of Newbold's original  plough are in the museum of the New York Agricultural Society at Albany.    Another inventor of ploughs was Jethro Wood, a blacksmith of Scipio, New  York, who received two patents, one in 1814 and the other in 1819. His  plough was of cast iron, but in three parts, so that a broken part  might be renewed without purchasing an entire plough. This principle of  standardization marked a great advance. The farmers by this time were  forgetting their former prejudices, and many ploughs were sold. Though  Wood's original patent was extended, infringements were frequent, and he  is said to have spent his entire property in prosecuting them.    In clay soils these ploughs did not work well, as the more tenacious  soil stuck to the iron moldboard instead of curling gracefully away. In  1833, John Lane, a Chicago blacksmith, faced a wooden moldboard with an  old steel saw. It worked like magic, and other blacksmiths followed suit  to such an extent that the demand for old saws became brisk. Then came  John Deere, a native of Vermont, who settled first in Grand Detour, and  then in Moline, Illinois.

They      rejoiced at the accident which had brought me there, and hoped I      would send my carriage away and take a bed with them.

'And,' says he,      'I know you will be welcome.'\"    An intimacy was gradually established between HERSCHEL and Dr. BURNEY.  They saw each other often at the meetings of the Royal Society, and  HERSCHEL frequently stayed at the doctor's house. \"On the first evening  HERSCHEL spent at Chelsea, when I called for my ARGAND lamp, HERSCHEL,  who had not seen one of those lamps, was surprised at the great effusion  of light, and immediately calculated the difference between that and a  single candle, and found it sixteen to one.\"[25]    In 1793 we find HERSCHEL as a witness for his friend JAMES WATT, in the  celebrated case of WATT _vs._ BULL, which was tried in the Court of  Common Pleas. And from MUIRHEAD'S Life of WATT, it appears that HERSCHEL  visited WATT at Heathfield in 1810.    A delightful picture of the old age of HERSCHEL is given by the poet  CAMPBELL,[26] whose nature was fitted to perceive the beauties of a  grand and simple character like HERSCHEL'S:                                            \"[BRIGHTON], _September 15, 1813_.        . . . \"I wish you had been with me the day before yesterday, when you      would have joined me, I am sure, deeply in admiring a great, simple,      good old man--Dr. HERSCHEL. Do not think me vain, or at least put up      with my vanity, in saying that I almost flatter myself I have made      him my friend. I have got an invitation, and a pressing one, to go      to his house; and the lady who introduced me to him, says he spoke      of me as if he would really be happy to see me. . . . I spent all      Sunday with him and his family. His son is a prodigy in sciences,      and fond of poetry, but very unassuming. . . . Now, for the old      astronomer himself. His simplicity, his kindness, his anecdotes, his      readiness to explain--and make perfectly conspicuous too--his own      sublime conceptions of the universe are indescribably charming. He      is seventy-six, but fresh and stout; and there he sat, nearest the      door, at his friend's house, alternately smiling at a joke, or      contentedly sitting without share or notice in the conversation.      Any train of conversation he follows implicitly; anything you ask he      labors with a sort of boyish earnestness to explain.        \"I was anxious to get from him as many particulars as I could about      his interview with BUONAPARTE.[27] The latter, it was reported, had      astonished him by his astronomical knowledge.        \"'No,' he said, 'the First Consul did surprise me by his quickness      and versatility on all subjects; but in science he seemed to know      little more than any well-educated gentleman, and of astronomy much      less for instance than our own king. His general air,' he said, 'was      something like affecting to know more than he did know.' He was      high, and tried to be great with HERSCHEL, I suppose, without      success; and 'I remarked,' said the astronomer, 'his hypocrisy in      concluding the conversation on astronomy by observing how all these      glorious views gave proofs of an Almighty Wisdom.' I asked him if he      thought the system of LAPLACE to be quite certain, with regard to      the total security of the planetary system from the effects of      gravitation losing its present balance? He said, No; he thought by      no means that the universe was secured from the chance of sudden      losses of parts.        \"He was convinced that there had existed a planet between _Mars_      and _Jupiter_, in our own system, of which the little asteroids, or      planetkins, lately discovered, are indubitably fragments; and      'Remember,' said he, 'that though they have discovered only four of      those parts, there will be thousands--perhaps thirty thousand      more--yet discovered.' This planet he believed to have been lost by      explosion.        \"With great kindness and patience he referred me, in the course of      my attempts to talk with him, to a theorem in NEWTON'S 'Principles      of Natural Philosophy' in which the time that the light takes to      travel from the sun is proved with a simplicity which requires but a      few steps in reasoning. In talking of some inconceivably distant      bodies, he introduced the mention of this plain theorem, to remind      me that the progress of light could be measured in the one case as      well as the other. Then, speaking of himself, he said, with a      modesty of manner which quite overcame me, when taken together with      the greatness of the assertion: 'I have looked _further into space      than ever human being did before me_. I have observed stars, of      which the light, it can be proved, must take two millions of years      to reach this earth.'        \"I really and unfeignedly felt at this "]]]
