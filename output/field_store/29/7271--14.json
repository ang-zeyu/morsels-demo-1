[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28198"],[0,"A Budget of Christmas Tales (#14)"],[1," very edge of the lighted space.    A woman by her dress, an old, old woman, with a seamed, blotched face;  an ugly, human wreck, all torn and battered and discolored by the storms  of life. Such was old Marg--\"Luny Marg,\" as she was called in the haunts  that knew her best. Her history? She had forgotten it herself, very  likely, and there was no one to know or care--no one in the wide world  to care if she should at any moment be trampled to death, or slip from  the dock into the black river. The garret which lodged her would find  another tenant; the children of the gutters another target for their  missiles. Not that she was worse than others--only that she was old and  ugly and sharp of tongue, and the world--even _her_ world--has no use  for such as she.    For some time this forlorn creature continued to hover on the edge of  the lighted space. The sleet had become snow, and already a thin white  film covered the pavement, promising \"a white Christmas,\" and the cold  increased from moment to moment.    The woman drew her filthy shawl closer; her jaws chattered, yet she  seemed unable to tear herself from the spot. Her eyes, alert under  their gray brows, as a rat's, were fixed now upon the open door, now  upon the transparency, yet she made no motion toward the proffered  shelter. Two men, hirsute and ragged, stopped near her and, after a  moments consultation, slunk across the square of light and disappeared  in the building. As the door was opened, there came a fuller burst of  song, and a rush of warm air, fragrant with the aroma of coffee and  oysters.    The old woman's body quivered with desire; food, warmth, rest--all that  her miserable frame demanded--were there within easy reach, for the mere  asking; nay for the mere taking; yet still the devils of stubbornness  and spite would not let go their hold upon her. But finally, as a bitter  blast swept the snow stingingly against her face, she uttered a hoarse  snarl, and glancing about to see that no jeering eye was upon her, the  poor creature crept across the pavement, clambered up the stone steps,  and, pushing open the door, slipped into the nearest vacant seat.    The chairs and benches were unusually well filled. Numbers of women and  children were in the foreground. A few men were also present, sitting  with their bodies hanging forward, their hats tightly clutched between  their knees, their eyes fixed on the floor. The women and children, on  the contrary, followed every movement of the young women on the platform  with furtive eagerness.    The simplicity of attire which Angela and her friends had assumed did  not deceive even the tiniest gutter-child present--these were \"ladies,\"  and one and all accorded them the same tribute of genuine, if reluctant,  admiration.    Old Marg, after the embarrassment of the first moment, took everything  in with one hawk-like glance--the Christmas greens upon the clean, white  walls, the curtained space in the rear which hid some pleasant mystery,  the men and women on the platform.    At the organ sat a young girl, leaning upon the now silent keys, her  face toward the young man who was speaking. Old Marg could not take her  eyes from this face--white, serious, sweet, set in a halo of pale golden  hair. The sight of it aroused strange feelings in the bosom of the old  outcast. Fascinated, tortured, bewildered, she sat and gazed. It was  long since she had thought of her youth. This girl reminded her of that  forgotten time. Like a violet flung upon a refuse-heap, the thought of  her own innocent girlhood lay for an instant upon the foul mass of  memories accumulated by sixty-miserable years. \"_I_ was light-haired,  too!\" ran old Marg's thoughts. \"Light-haired, an' light-complected, like  her!\"    The perfume of that thought breathed across her soul, and was gone.  Still she gazed from under her shaggy brows, and, without meaning to  listen, found herself hearing what the speaker was saying. He was  telling without rhetoric or cant the story of Christ, and with  simplicity and tact presenting the lesson of His life.    \"This joy of giving, of sacrificing for others,\" the young man was  saying in his earnest, musical voice, \"so far beyond the joy of  receiving, is within the reach of every human being. Think of that! The  poorest man or woman or child who breathes on earth to-night may know  this joy, may give some pleasure, some help, some comfort, to some  fellow-creature. Whether it be a human creature or a dumb beast, matters  not. It is all one in God's sight, being an act of love and kindness and  sacrifice.\"    Old Marg looked down upon her squalid rags; her rough features writhed  with a scornful smile. \"That's a lie!\" she muttered. \"What could the  likes of _me_ do for anybody, I'd like to know!\"    Still she listened; but at last, as the warmth stole through her sodden  garments, and into her chilled veins, and the peace of the place  penetrated the turbulent recesses of her soul, the man's voice became  like a voice heard in a dream, and the old outcast slept.      A confused sound greeted her awakening. Some one was playing the organ  jubilantly; people were moving about--girls with trays loaded with  steaming dishes; children were talking and laughing excitedly. The  curtain had been drawn, and a great Christmas-tree almost blinded her  with its splendor. She stared about in bewilderment. She looked at the  tree, at the people, at her own foul rags. A fierce revulsion of feeling  swept over her. Rage, shame, a desire to get out of sight, to be  swallowed up in the darkness and misery which were her proper element,  seized and mastered her. She staggered to her feet. A young girl  approached her with a tray of tempting food. The sight and smell of it  goaded the starved creature to madness. She could have fallen upon it  like a wolf, but instead she pushed the girl roughly aside and fumbled  dizzily at the door-knob.    A hand was laid upon her arm. The girl with the sweet, white face was  looking at her with a friendly smile.    \"Won't you stay and have something warm to eat before going into the  cold?\" the girl asked gently.    Old Marg shook the hand from her arm.    \"No!\" she snarled. \"I don't want nothin'! Let me go!\"    With a patient smile Angela opened the door.    \"I am sorry you will not stay,\" she said softly. \"It would give me great  pleasure. There is a gift for you on the tree, too. It is Christmas Eve,  you know!\"    A hoarse, choking sound came from the woman's lips. She pushed by into  the vestibule. Angela followed.    \"If you should feel differently to-morrow,\" she said, in her kind,  gentle voice, \"come here again, about eleven o'clock. I shall be here.\"  Without waiting for a reply, she re-entered the hall. A young man, the  same who had been speaking, met her at the door.    \"Angela!\" he exclaimed. \"You should not be out there in the cold!\" She  smiled absently. \"Did you see her, Robert?\"    \"That terrible old woman? Yes, I saw her. A hopeless case, I fear.\"    Angela's eyes kept their absent look.    \"It was awful to see her go away like that, into the cold and snow,  hungry and half-clad!\" she said.    The young man leaned nearer. \"Angela,\" he whispered. \"You must not let  these things sink into your heart as you do, or you cannot bear the work  you have undertaken. As for that old creature, it is terrible to think  of her, but she seemed to me beyond our reach.\"    \"But not beyond God's reach _through us_!\" said Angela.      Meantime old Marg was facing the storm with rage and pain in her face  and in her heart. The streets were deserted, and lighted only by such  beams as found their way through the dirty windows of shops and saloons.  From these last came sounds of revelry and contention, and at one or  another the poor creature paused, listening without fear to the familiar  hubbub. Should she go in? Some one might give her a drink, to ease for a  time the terrible gnawing at her breast. Might? Yes; but more likely she  would be thrust out with jeers and curses, and, for some reason, old  Marg was in no mood to use the caustic wit and ready tongue that were  her only weapons. So she staggered on until the swarming tenement was  reached, stumbled up the five flights of unillumined stairs, and almost  fell headlong into the dismal garret which she called her home.    Feeling about in the darkness, she found a match and lit a bit of candle  which stopped the neck of an empty bottle. It burned uncertainly as if  reluctant to disclose the scene upon which its light fell. A  smoke-stained, sloping ceiling, a blackened floor, a shapeless mattress  heaped with rags, a deal box, a rusty stove resting upon two bricks,  supporting in its turn an ancient frying-pan, a chipped saucer, and a  battered tin can from which, when the scavenger business was good, old  Marg served afternoon tea--such were her home and all her personal  belongings.    There was no fire, nor any means of producing one, but upon the box was  spread a piece of paper containing a slice of bread and a soup-bone,  whereto clung some fragments of meat--the gift of a neighbor hardly less  wretched than herself.    The old woman's eyes glittered at the sight, and, seizing the food, she  sank weakly upon the box and began gnawing at it; but her toothless  jaws, stiff with cold, made no impression upon the tough meat and hard  crust, and letting them drop to the floor, the poor creature fell to  rocking to and fro, whimpering tearlessly, like a suffering dog.  Strangely enough, within the withered bosom of this most wretched  creature there had welled up, from some hidden source of womanly  feeling, a passionate self-pity, a no less passionate self-loathing.  This was what a moment's contact with all that she had so long  abjured--purity, order, gentleness--had brought to pass.    That fair young girl-tall, pale, sweet as an Easter lily--stood before  her like an incarnate memory, pointing toward the past,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28216"],[0,"Respiration Calorimeters for Studying the Respiratory Exchange and Energy (#14)"],[1,"known of determining the hydrothermal equivalent of the body is to  assume the specific heat of the body as 0.83.[14] This factor will of  course vary considerably with the weight of body material and the  proportion of fat, water, and muscular tissue present therein, but for  general purposes nothing better can at present be employed. From the  weight of the subject and this factor the hydrothermal equivalent of the  body can be calculated. It remains to determine, then, with great  exactness the body temperature.    Recognizing early the importance of securing accurate body-temperatures  in researches of this kind, a number of investigations were made and  published elsewhere[15] regarding the body-temperature in connection  with the experiments with the respiration calorimeter. It was soon  found that the ordinary mercurial clinical thermometer was not best  suited for the most accurate observations of body-temperature and a  special type of thermometer employing the electrical-resistance method  was used. In many of the experiments, however, it is impracticable with  new subjects to complicate the experiment by asking them to insert the  electrical rectal thermometer, and hence we have been obliged to resort  to the usual clinical thermometer with temperatures taken in the mouth,  although in a few instances they have been taken in the axilla and the  rectum. For the best results the electrical rectal thermometer is used.  This apparatus permits a continuous measurement of body temperature,  deep in the rectum, unknown to the subject and for an indefinite period  of time, it being necessary to remove the thermometer only for  defecation.    As a result of these observations it was soon found that the body  temperature was not constant from hour to hour, but fluctuated  considerably and underwent more or less regular rhythm with the minimum  between 3 and 5 o'clock in the morning and the maximum about 5 o'clock  in the afternoon. In a number of experiments where the mercurial  thermometer was used under the tongue and observations thus taken  compared with records with the resistance thermometer, it was found that  with careful manipulation and avoiding muscular activity, mouth  breathing, and the drinking of hot or cold liquid, a fairly uniform  agreement between the two could be obtained. Such comparisons made on  laboratory assistants can not be duplicated with the ordinary subject.    It is assumed that fluctuations in temperature measured by the rectal  thermometer likewise hold true for the average temperature of the whole  body, but evidence on this point is unfortunately not as complete as is  desirable. In an earlier report of investigations of this nature, a few  experiments on comparison of measurements of resistance thermometer deep  in the rectum and in a well-closed axilla showed a distinct tendency for  the curves to continue parallel. A research is very much needed at  present on a topographical distribution of body temperature, and  particularly on the course of the fluctuations in different parts of the  body. A series of electric-resistance thermometers placed at different  points in the colon, at different points in a stomach tube, in the  well-closed axilla, possibly attached to the surface of the body, and in  women in the vagina, should give a very accurate picture of the  distribution of the body-temperature and likewise indicate the  proportionality of the fluctuations in different parts of the body.  Until such a research is completed, however, it is necessary to assume  that fluctuations in body-temperature as measured by the electric rectal  thermometer are a true measure of the average body-temperature of the  whole body. Indeed it is upon this assumption that it is necessary for  us to make corrections for heat lost from or stored in the body. It is  our custom, therefore, to compute the hydrothermal equivalent by  multiplying the body-weight by the specific heat of the body, commonly  assumed as 0.83, and then to make allowance for fluctuations in  body-temperature.    When it is considered that with a subject having a weight of 70 kilos a  difference in temperature of 1 deg. C. will make a difference in the  measurement of heat of some 60 calories, it is readily seen that the  importance of knowing the exact body-temperature can not be  overestimated; indeed, the whole problem of the comparison of the direct  and indirect calorimetry hinges more or less upon this very point, and  it is strongly to be hoped that ere long the much-needed observations on  body-temperature can be made.      CONTROL EXPERIMENTS WITH THE CALORIMETER.    After providing a suitable apparatus for bringing away the heat  generated inside the chamber and for preventing the loss of heat by  maintaining the walls adiabatic, it is still necessary to demonstrate  the ability of the calorimeter to measure known amounts of heat  accurately. In order to do this we pass a current of electricity of  known voltage through a resistance coil and thus develop heat inside the  respiration chamber. While, undoubtedly, the use of a standard  resistance and potentiometer is the most accurate method for measuring  currents of this nature, thus far we have based our experiments upon the  measurements made with extremely accurate Weston portable voltmeter and  mil-ammeters. Thanks to the kindness of one of our former co-workers,  Mr. S. C. Dinsmore, at present associated with the Weston Electrical  Instrument Company, we have been able to obtain two especially exact  instruments. The mil-ammeter is so adjusted as to give a maximum current  of 1.5 amperes and the voltmeter reads from zero to 150 volts. The  direct current furnished the building is caused to pass through a  variable resistance for adjusting minor variations in voltage and then  through the mil-ammeter into a manganin resistance-coil inside the  chamber, having a resistance of 84.2 ohms. Two leads from the terminals  of the manganin coil connect with the voltmeter outside the chamber, and  hence the drop in potential can be measured very accurately and as  frequently as is desired. The current furnished the building is  remarkably steady, but for the more accurate experiments a small degree  of hand regulation is necessary.    The advantage of the electrical method of controlling the apparatus is  that the measurements can be made very accurately, rapidly, and in short  periods. In making experiments of this nature it is our custom first to  place the resistance-coil in the calorimeter and make the connections.  The current is then passed through the coil, and simultaneously the  water is started flowing through the heat-absorbing system and the whole  calorimeter is adjusted in temperature equilibrium as soon as possible.  When the temperature of the air and walls is constant and the  thermal-junction system in equilibrium, the exact time is noted and the  water-current deflected into the meter. At the end of one hour, the  usual length of a period, the water-current is deflected from the meter,  the meter is weighed, and the average temperature-difference of the  water obtained by averaging the results of all the temperature  differences noted during the hour. Usually during an experiment of this  nature, records of the water-temperatures are made every 4 minutes;  occasionally, when the fluctuations are somewhat greater than usual,  records are made every 2 minutes.    The calculation of the heat developed in the apparatus is made by means  of the formula C x E x _t_ x 0.2385 = calories, in which C equals the  current in amperes, E the electromotive force, and _t_ the time in  seconds. This gives the heat expressed in calories at 15 deg. C. This  procedure we have followed as a result of the recommendation of Dr. E.  B. Rosa, of the National Bureau of Standards. In order to convert the  values to 20 deg., the unit commonly employed in calorimetric work, it has  been necessary to multiply by the ratio of the specific heat of water at  15 deg. to that of water at 20 deg. Assuming the specific heat of water at  20 deg. to be 1, the specific heat at 15 deg. is 1.001.[16]    Of the many electrical check-tests made with this type of apparatus, but  one need be given here, pending a special treatment of the method of  control of the calorimeter in a forthcoming publication. An electrical  check-experiment with the chair calorimeter was made on January 4, 1909,  and continued 6 hours. The voltmeter and mil-ammeter were read every few  minutes, the water collected in the water-meter, carefully weighed, and  the temperature differences as measured on the two mercury thermometers  were recorded every 4 minutes.    The heat developed during the experiment may be calculated from the data  as follows: Average current = 1.293 amperes; average E. M. F. = 109.15  volts; time = 21,600 seconds; factor used to convert watt-seconds to  calories = 0.2385. (1.293 x 109.15 x 21600 x 0.2385) x 1.001 = 727.8  calories produced.    During the 6 hours 237.63 kilograms of water passed through the  absorbing system.    The average temperature rise was 3.04 deg. C., the total heat brought away  was therefore (237.63 x 3.04) x 1.0024[17] = 724.1 calories.    Thus in 6 hours there were about 3.7 calories more heat developed inside  the apparatus than were measured by the water-current, a discrepancy of  about 0.5 per cent.    Under ideal conditions of manipulation, the withdrawal of heat from the  calorimeter should be at just such a rate as to exactly compensate for  the heat developed by the resistance-coil. Under these conditions, then,  there would be no heat abstracted from nor stored by the calorimeter and  its temperature should remain constant throughout the whole experiment.  Practically this is very difficult to accomplish and there are minor  fluctuations in temperature above and below the initial temperature  during a long experiment and, indeed, during a short"]]]
