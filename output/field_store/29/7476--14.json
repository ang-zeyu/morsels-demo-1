I think I was glad to know it;  I think I was glad to have my better impulses thus buttressed and  guarded by the terrors of the scaffold. Jekyll was now my city of  refuge; let but Hyde peep out an instant, and the hands of all  men would be raised to take and slay him.    100)    I resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say  with honesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good. You know  yourself how earnestly in the last months of last year, I  laboured to relieve suffering; you know that much was done for  others, and that the days passed quietly, almost happily for  myself. Nor can I truly say that I wearied of this beneficent and  innocent life; I think instead that I daily enjoyed it more  completely; but I was still cursed with my duality of purpose;  and as the first edge of my penitence wore off, the lower side of  me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to growl  for licence. Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde; the bare  idea of that would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own  person, that I was once more tempted to trifle with my  conscience; and it was as an ordinary secret sinner, that I at  last fell before the assaults of temptation.    There comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is  filled at last; and this brief condescension to evil finally  destroyed the balance of my soul. And yet I was not alarmed; the  fall seemed natural, like a return to the old days before I had  made discovery. It was a fine, clear, January day, wet under foot  where the frost had melted, but cloudless overhead; and the  Regent's Park was full of winter chirrupings and sweet with  spring odours. I sat in the sun on a bench; the animal within me  licking the    101)    chops of memory; the spiritual side a little drowsed, promising  subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to begin. After all, I  reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then I smiled, comparing  myself with other men, comparing my active goodwill with the lazy  cruelty of their neglect. And at the very moment of that  vain-glorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and  the most deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint;  and then as in its turn the faintness subsided, I began to be  aware of a change in the temper of my thoughts, a greater  boldness, a contempt of danger, a solution of the bonds of  obligation. I looked down; my clothes hung formlessly on my  shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was corded and  hairy. I was once more Edward Hyde. A moment before I had been  safe of all men's respect, wealthy, beloved--the cloth laying  for me in the dining-room at home; and now I was the common  quarry of mankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to  the gallows.    My reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly. I have more  than once observed that, in my second character, my faculties  seemed sharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic;  thus it came about that, where Jekyll perhaps might have  succumbed, Hyde rose to the importance of the moment. My drugs  were in one of the presses of my cabinet; how was I    102)    to reach them? That was the problem that (crushing my temples in  my hands) I set myself to solve. The laboratory door I had  closed. If I sought to enter by the house, my own servants would  consign me to the gallows. I saw I must employ another hand, and  thought of Lanyon. How was he to be reached? how persuaded?  Supposing that I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to  make my way into his presence? and how should I, an unknown and  displeasing visitor, prevail on the famous physician to rifle the  study of his colleague, Dr. Jekyll? Then I remembered that of my  original character, one part remained to me: I could write my own  hand; and once I had conceived that kindling spark, the way that  I must follow became lighted up from end to end.     Thereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning  a passing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name  of which I chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was  indeed comical enough, however tragic a fate these garments  covered) the driver could not conceal his mirth. I gnashed my  teeth upon him with a gust of devilish fury; and the smile  withered from his face--happily for him--yet more happily for  myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged him from  his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so  black a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look  did they exchange in my    103)    presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a private  room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde in danger of his  life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger,  strung to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the  creature was astute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the  will; composed his two important letters, one to Lanyon and one  to Poole; and that he might receive actual evidence of their  being posted, sent them out with directions that they should be  registered.    Thenceforward, he sat all day over the fire in the private room,  gnawing his nails; there he dined, sitting alone with his fears,  the waiter visibly quailing before his eye; and thence, when the  night was fully come, he set forth in the corner of a closed cab,  and was driven to and fro about the streets of the city. He, I  say--I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing human;  nothing lived in him but fear and hatred. And when at last,  thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged  the cab and ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes,  an object marked out for observation, into the midst of the  nocturnal passengers, these two base passions raged within him  like a tempest. He walked fast, hunted by his fears, chattering  to himself, skulking through the less-frequented thoroughfares,  counting the minutes that still divided him from midnight. Once a    104)    woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box of lights. He smote  her in the face, and she fled.    When I came to myself at Lanyon's, the horror of my old friend  perhaps affected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but  a drop in the sea to the abhorrence with which I looked back upon  these hours. A change had come over me. It was no longer the fear  of the gallows, it was the horror of being Hyde that racked me. I  received Lanyon's condemnation partly in a dream; it was partly  in a dream that I came home to my own house and got into bed. I  slept after the prostration of the day, with a stringent and  profound slumber which not even the nightmares that wrung me  could avail to break. I awoke in the morning shaken, weakened,  but refreshed. I still hated and feared the thought of the brute  that slept within me, and I had not of course forgotten the  appalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home,  in my own house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my  escape shone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the  brightness of hope.    I was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast,  drinking the chill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized  again with those indescribable sensations that heralded the  change; and I had but the time to gain the shelter of my cabinet,  before I was once again raging and freezing with the passions of  Hyde. It took on this occasion a double dose to recall me to    105)    myself; and alas! Six hours after, as I sat looking sadly in the  fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be re-administered.  In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a great effort as  of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation of the  drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all  hours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory  shudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my  chair, it was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of  this continually-impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which  I now condemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought  possible to man, I became, in my own person, a creature eaten up  and emptied by fever, languidly weak both in body and mind, and  solely occupied by one thought: the horror of my other self. But  when I slept, or when the virtue of the medicine wore off, I  would leap almost without transition (for the pangs of  transformation grew daily less marked) into the possession of a  fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling with  causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to  contain the raging energies of life. The powers of Hyde seemed to  have grown with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly the hate  that now divided them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it was  a thing of vital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity of  that creature that shared with him some of the phenomena of    106)    consciousness, and was co-heir with him to death: and beyond these  links of community, which in themselves made the most poignant  part of his distress, he thought of Hyde, for all his energy of  life, as of something not only hellish but inorganic. This was the  shocking thing; that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries  and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned; that  what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the offices of life.  And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to him closer  than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh, where he  heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every hour  of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against  him and deposed him out of life. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll,  was of a different order. His terror of the gallows drove him  continually to commit"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/420"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#14)"],[1,"attack.  Then a few of  them advanced until another shot from the Wizard's revolver made them  retreat.    \"That's fine,\" said Zeb.  \"We've got 'em on the run now, sure enough.\"    \"But only for a time,\" replied the Wizard, shaking his head gloomily.  \"These revolvers are good for six shots each, but when those are gone  we shall be helpless.\"    The Gargoyles seemed to realize this, for they sent a few of their band  time after time to attack the strangers and draw the fire from the  little man's revolvers.  In this way none of them was shocked by the  dreadful report more than once, for the main band kept far away and  each time a new company was sent into the battle.  When the Wizard had  fired all of his twelve bullets he had caused no damage to the enemy  except to stun a few by the noise, and so be as no nearer to victory  than in the beginning of the fray.    \"What shall we do now?\" asked Dorothy, anxiously.    \"Let's yell--all together,\" said Zeb.    \"And fight at the same time,\" added the Wizard.  \"We will get near Jim,  so that he can help us, and each one must take some weapon and do the  best he can.  I'll use my sword, although it isn't much account in this  affair.  Dorothy must take her parasol and open it suddenly when the  wooden folks attack her.  I haven't anything for you, Zeb.\"    \"I'll use the king,\" said the boy, and pulled his prisoner out of the  buggy.  The bound Gargoyle's arms extended far out beyond its head, so  by grasping its wrists Zeb found the king made a very good club.  The  boy was strong for one of his years, having always worked upon a farm;  so he was likely to prove more dangerous to the enemy than the Wizard.    When the next company of Gargoyles advanced, our adventurers began  yelling as if they had gone mad.  Even the kitten gave a dreadfully  shrill scream and at the same time Jim the cab-horse neighed loudly.  This daunted the enemy for a time, but the defenders were soon out of  breath.  Perceiving this, as well as the fact that there were no more  of the awful \"bangs\" to come from the revolvers, the Gargoyles advanced  in a swarm as thick as bees, so that the air was filled with them.    Dorothy squatted upon the ground and put up her parasol, which nearly  covered her and proved a great protection.  The Wizard's sword-blade  snapped into a dozen pieces at the first blow he struck against the  wooden people.  Zeb pounded away with the Gargoyle he was using as a  club until he had knocked down dozens of foes; but at the last they  clustered so thickly about him that he no longer had room in which to  swing his arms.  The horse performed some wonderful kicking and even  Eureka assisted when she leaped bodily upon the Gargoyles and scratched  and bit at them like a wild-cat.    But all this bravery amounted to nothing at all.  The wooden things  wound their long arms around Zeb and the Wizard and held them fast.  Dorothy was captured in the same way, and numbers of the Gargoyles  clung to Jim's legs, so weighting him down that the poor beast was  helpless.  Eureka made a desperate dash to escape and scampered along  the ground like a streak; but a grinning Gargoyle flew after her and  grabbed her before she had gone very far.    All of them expected nothing less than instant death; but to their  surprise the wooden creatures flew into the air with them and bore them  far away, over miles and miles of wooden country, until they came to a  wooden city.  The houses of this city had many corners, being square  and six-sided and eight-sided.  They were tower-like in shape and the  best of them seemed old and weather-worn; yet all were strong and  substantial.    To one of these houses which had neither doors nor windows, but only  one broad opening far up underneath the roof, the prisoners were  brought by their captors.  The Gargoyles roughly pushed them into the  opening, where there was a platform, and then flew away and left them.  As they had no wings the strangers could not fly away, and if they  jumped down from such a height they would surely be killed.  The  creatures had sense enough to reason that way, and the only mistake  they made was in supposing the earth people were unable to overcome  such ordinary difficulties.    Jim was brought with the others, although it took a good many Gargoyles  to carry the big beast through the air and land him on the high  platform, and the buggy was thrust in after him because it belonged to  the party and the wooden folks had no idea what it was used for or  whether it was alive or not.  When Eureka's captor had thrown the  kitten after the others the last Gargoyle silently disappeared, leaving  our friends to breathe freely once more.    \"What an awful fight!\" said Dorothy, catching her breath in little  gasps.    \"Oh, I don't know,\" purred Eureka, smoothing her ruffled fur with her  paw; \"we didn't manage to hurt anybody, and nobody managed to hurt us.\"    \"Thank goodness we are together again, even if we are prisoners,\"  sighed the little girl.    \"I wonder why they didn't kill us on the spot,\" remarked Zeb, who had  lost his king in the struggle.    \"They are probably keeping us for some ceremony,\" the Wizard answered,  reflectively; \"but there is no doubt they intend to kill us as dead as  possible in a short time.\"    \"As dead as poss'ble would be pretty dead, wouldn't it?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Yes, my dear.  But we have no need to worry about that just now.  Let  us examine our prison and see what it is like.\"    The space underneath the roof, where they stood, permitted them to see  on all sides of the tall building, and they looked with much curiosity  at the city spread out beneath them.  Everything visible was made of  wood, and the scene seemed stiff and extremely unnatural.    From their platform a stair descended into the house, and the children  and the Wizard explored it after lighting a lantern to show them the  way.  Several stories of empty rooms rewarded their search, but nothing  more;  so after a time they came back to the platform again.  Had there  been any doors or windows in the lower rooms, or had not the boards of  the house been so thick and stout, escape could have been easy; but to  remain down below was like being in a cellar or the hold of a ship, and  they did not like the darkness or the damp smell.    In this country, as in all others they had visited underneath the  earth's surface, there was no night, a constant and strong light coming  from some unknown source.  Looking out, they could see into some of the  houses near them, where there were open windows in abundance, and were  able to mark the forms of the wooden Gargoyles moving about in their  dwellings.    \"This seems to be their time of rest,\" observed the Wizard.  \"All  people need rest, even if they are made of wood, and as there is no  night here they select a certain time of the day in which to sleep or  doze.\"    \"I feel sleepy myself,\" remarked Zeb, yawning.    \"Why, where's Eureka?\" cried Dorothy, suddenly.    They all looked around, but the kitten was no place to be seen.    \"She's gone out for a walk,\" said Jim, gruffly.    \"Where?  On the roof?\" asked the girl.    \"No; she just dug her claws into the wood and climbed down the sides of  this house to the ground.\"    \"She couldn't climb DOWN, Jim,\" said Dorothy.  \"To climb means to go  up.\"    \"Who said so?\" demanded the horse.    \"My school-teacher said so; and she knows a lot, Jim.\"    \"To 'climb down' is sometimes used as a figure of speech,\" remarked the  Wizard.    \"Well, this was a figure of a cat,\" said Jim, \"and she WENT down,  anyhow, whether she climbed or crept.\"    \"Dear me! how careless Eureka is,\" exclaimed the girl, much distressed.  \"The Gurgles will get her, sure!\"    \"Ha, ha!\" chuckled the old cab-horse; \"they're not 'Gurgles,' little  maid; they're Gargoyles.\"    \"Never mind; they'll get Eureka, whatever they're called.\"    \"No they won't,\" said the voice of the kitten, and Eureka herself  crawled over the edge of the platform and sat down quietly upon the  floor.    \"Wherever have you been, Eureka?\" asked Dorothy, sternly.    \"Watching the wooden folks.  They're too funny for anything, Dorothy.  Just now they are all going to bed, and--what do you think?--they  unhook the hinges of their wings and put them in a corner until they  wake up again.\"    \"What, the hinges?\"    \"No; the wings.\"    \"That,\" said Zeb, \"explains why this house is used by them for a  prison.  If any of the Gargoyles act badly, and have to be put in jail,  they are brought here and their wings unhooked and taken away from them  until they promise to be good.\"    The Wizard had listened intently to what Eureka had said.    \"I wish we had some of those loose wings,\" he said.    \"Could we fly with them?\" asked Dorothy.    \"I think so.  If the Gargoyles can unhook the wings then the power to  fly lies in the wings themselves, and not in the wooden bodies of the  people who wear them.  So, if we had the wings, we could probably fly  as well as they do--as least while we are in their country and under  the spell of its magic.\"    \"But how would it help us to be able to fly?\" questioned the girl.    \"Come here,\" said the little man, and took her to one of the corners of  the building.  \"Do you see that big rock standing on the hillside  yonder?\" he continued, pointing with his finger.    \"Yes; it's a good way off, but I can see it,\" she replied.    \"Well, inside that rock, which reaches up into the clouds, is an  archway very much like the one we entered when we climbed the spiral  stairway from the Valley of Voe.  I'll get my spy-glass, and then you  can see it more plainly.\"    He fetched a small but powerful telescope, which had been in his  satchel, and by its aid the little girl clearly saw the opening.    \"Where does it lead to?\" she asked.    \"That I cannot tell,\" said the Wizard; \"but we cannot now be far below  the earth's surface, and that entrance may lead to another"]]]
