Now you will wonder what the salt is for; simply to keep the ice from  freezing the hole shut. I had nine of that kind of sets set last  winter and trapped seven mink. The hole will never freeze shut.  Always set trap under water.    Last winter I complained to my better half that I had better take my  traps out of the run where I trap, as I couldn't make a water set  because my traps froze over night. She said, why don't you put salt  around your traps? That put me to thinking so I got an old piece of  oil cloth and got her to make four for me on the sewing machine; I  put a five pound sack of salt in each one.    The best place to set is on the inside of a curve. In slack water you  will have to keep moving your set as the water rises and falls.  Undoubtedly that is the best cold water set I have ever tried, and it  has been a complete success with me.    I use the cubby set for mink. Before severe weather sets in I take  two boards six or eight feet long, lean them against each other V  shape, put water vole carcass (rabbit, chicken or fish is also good)  in center and a trap at each end, about one foot from end. I also  have the hollow log set. It is on the same principle as the cubby  set. A cubby is easily built. You can make them out of stone if you  can't get boards.        CHAPTER XVI.    LOG AND OTHER SETS.    My advice to all young trappers is, study the nature and habits of  your game and you will be successful in taking all kinds of fur  bearing animals. Here is one of my methods, writes a trapper, of  taking mink around swamps and lakes where there are shallow springs  that never freeze up.    The bait house: This should be built in about two inches of water, as  follows: Get some sticks about one foot and a half long and drive one  end in the mud in the shape of a horse shoe, with the tops leaned  together and a door left in one side about three inches wide. The pen  should be a foot wide. Now get some moss, grass or weeds (the moss  from an old rat house is best) and cover over well. Lay a chip or  chunk of wood back of the house and place a piece of fresh muskrat on  it. Set the trap under water on the door with spring pointing to one  side. If there is deep water near by the drowning wire is the best  way to fasten traps, and if water is shallow fasten the trap to a  long stone of about eight or ten pounds weight and place back as far  as the chain will reach from the house.    There are certain springs around all lakes and swamps that a mink  will visit every time that he comes that way, and if a house is made  at these springs and kept baited every mink can be caught.    The bait hole: This is a good method to use along creeks and rivers  before the water freezes over in the fall. Find a steep bank a foot  or more high near the water and dig a hole back in a foot deep and  about eight inches high and level with the water. Scoop the dirt out  in front of the hole about two feet wide and two inches under the  water; but don't get the hole so low as to let the water back in. Let  the water come up to the mouth of the hole and set a No. 1 steel trap  square in front of the entrance with the spring pointing away, and  fasten so the mink will drown.    The log set: Find where an old log lies in the water, stick chunks of  wood in under the log on the bank so the mink will have to pass  around in the water under the log. Set trap, a No. 1, in an inch of  water square under the log and stake out in deep water as far as  possible. If a little bait is sprinkled on each side of the log it  will hasten the capture of the mink.      [Illustration: THREE LOG SET.]    The ditch set: Early in the season the mink are great rovers and  explore every ditch, hole or hollow log near the stream, and a trap  set in the ditch in shallow water will often get one. If the ditch is  too wide, drive a row of sticks across and leave an opening for the  trap. Set the trap in the opening and fasten it back as far as  possible.    The dry log set: Mink have a habit of passing through every hollow  log that lies near the stream and if one can be found like this it is  a good place to catch them all winter. Put some bait back in the log  and set your trap in the entrance. Cover the trap and chain with  powdered rotten wood, sprinkle it all around near the trap, and  fasten to a drag or small pole.    These five ways are the only methods I use. Sometimes I set a trap  for a few nights where a mink travels around a small bog between the  bog and the bank, and very often get one in these places.    In setting for mink on land I go about it in this way:    First, I prepare my traps by boiling in hemlock boughs. Before  setting my trap I dig up the ground with a trap hook. Dig a place two  feet across and set the trap in the middle and cover lightly with  fine leaves, putting some under the trap to keep it from freezing to  the ground.    Don't be afraid to dig up the ground thoroughly, as a mink will  always stop and investigate such a place. Have your hook long enough  so you will not have to walk on the new ground. Fasten your trap to a  springy bush or brush-drag.    After the ground freezes you will have to shelter your traps. I have  used the following ways with good success:    Take two good sized chunks of wood and lay them about six inches  apart. Set a No. 1 1/2 trap between them at each end, put your bait  between the two traps and cover it with small brush and grass. If you  can find an old hollow log it is a good place to set. These two sets  you can use all winter.    Red squirrel, chicken, rabbit, partridge, muskrat or turtle are all  good baits.    When you get a mink or rat alive let it bleed around your trap. It is  also a good plan to hitch a string around your bait and drag it from  one trap to another.    A man that follows the woods has some queer experiences, says a  Pennsylvania trapper. Some eight or ten years ago I was hunting the  Allegheny Mountains. It was in January and we were camped on the Elk  River. There was a light snow on the ground. My trapping partner told  me he would show me how to catch mink with the land set. Taking our  traps we went down the river until we came to some logs that lay  across a hollow. In some places the log was from three to four feet  from the ground, and other places it was not over two feet. Sticks  and limbs had lodged against the log, leaving small openings. In  these open places we set our traps, covering them over with leaves.  We caught several this way.    Now that will do in West Virginia, but in Pennsylvania in this part  of the state it takes a water set or a deadfall to catch the mink. In  the H-T-T I have seen a great many different opinions in regard to  trapping mink, some claiming they have no trouble in catching mink,  others cannot catch them only with the water set or deadfall.    Now my experience is that it depends upon where I am. In the sandhill  region of Virginia I could catch mink only with the water set, while  in the mountains they were very easily caught with the land set. Much  depends on what kind of bait is used. I once had a line of eighteen  traps baited with birds and chickens on the Nottoway River, and out  of the eighteen traps, I baited one with the carcass of a muskrat.  Well, I didn't catch any mink in the traps baited with chicken offal  and birds but the trap baited with muskrat won.        CHAPTER XVII.    POINTS FOR THE YOUNG TRAPPER.    It is better for the novice to serve a few season's apprenticeship on  the muskrat or skunk before attempting the capture of the shrewder  fur bearing animals. Boys, if you live near a trout brook, a creek,  pond, bog or spring hole, where there are fish, frogs or clams, you  may be sure that any such water is frequented, or at least visited by  mink, though your unpracticed eyes may fail to detect signs of their  presence; and by procuring a few traps and setting them according to  some methods, you can realize a good bit of pocket money every year,  and at the same time have more real pleasure than you get from all  other sports combined. Don't be discouraged if you catch nothing at  first. Visit your traps regularly, keep your eyes open and your wits  about you, be patient and persistent, and success is bound to come in  the end.    The young trapper's first essay for the mink should be with some sort  of water set--dry sets requiring much greater skill and caution--and  of the many methods employed the following is perhaps the most  effective for one so simply contrived. Having chosen a suitable  location for your trap, preferably some good sized pool with the  water still and not too deep at the edge, and the bank rising so  abruptly that the set will not easily be over-flowed; gather up a few  dead sticks 1 1/2 inch thick and break into stakes about 15 inches  long. Drive these firmly into the ground to form a three-sided pen  four inches wide by eight inches long, the open side at the water's  edge.    Hollow out a little place for the trap and place with the spring in  line with the entrance, as the animal's foot will then be less likely  to be thrown out by the jaws closing; press the chain down into the  mud out of sight; fix the ring pole, running it well out into deep  water; put the bait (fish, bird or squirrel) in the pen, pinning  securely with a dead stick, lay a few sticks over top of pen, and  cover trap carefully with rotten leaves fished up from the bottom,  dropping on a few pinches of mud, and sticking a row of short twigs  on the outer side to keep them from spreading or floating away. Then  if the water falls the trap will remain nicely covered.    You now have things pretty well in shape, unless you apprehend  trouble from trap thieves. In such case you cannot conceal"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34098"],[0,"Science of Trapping (#14)"],[1,"with the hands, spitting near  the trap or in any way leaving a trace of human odor nearby, should  be avoided. Old, well scented gloves should be used while handling  the trap and making the set, and a little of the scent used for the  traps should be rubbed on the shoe soles. A piece of old cowhide may  be used to stand on, and on which to place the loose dirt when  burying the drag and trap. Place the scent about 6 inches beyond the  trap and a very little may be sprinkled over the trap, to the trail.    If possible, place the trap between two tufts of grass or weeds, so  that it can be readily approached from one side only.\"    As many of the wolf trappers do not believe in scent, the following  methods are given. They are methods that have been thoroughly tested  and are being used today, by some of the best trappers. The first  method is a trail set, for use with a large bait, and is equally good  for grey wolves and coyotes. It should be remembered, however, that  trail sets of any kind, can not be used to advantage, if there is  much stock about. Find a well defined stock trail somewhere on the  wolf's route of travel and set two traps close together, on the  trail, then go on from fifty to one hundred yards and set two more in  exactly the same manner. Use care in setting the traps, so as to  leave everything looking the same as before. You can wear gloves if  you like, but I do not think there is much gained by doing so, for it  is impossible to make a set without leaving some human scent. The  scent will pass away in a day or two and few trappers count on making  a catch until after the traps have been set a couple of days.    A large bait should be placed close along the trail and midway  between the two settings. When the wolves get to feeding on the bait  they will travel on the trail and will not be looking for danger so  far from the bait. If desired, only one trap need be set in a place,  but two are better, as the wolf is likely to step over the trap if  only one is used. It is a good plan to set the traps several days  before placing the bait, so as to allow time for the human scent to  pass away and the setting to take on a more smooth appearance.    Here is a method that is much used for both wolves and coyotes. It  requires three or four traps and they should all be fastened securely  to one stout, hard-wood stake. Find a smooth, sandy spot and scoop  out a little hollow and drive the stake down until the top is below  the level of the ground. Fasten your bait securely to the top of the  stake, so as to hide the stake and prevent the wolf or coyote from  taking the bait away. If three traps are used, spread them out in the  form of a triangle, if four are used, arrange them in the form of a  square. Set the traps very carefully, so that when they are covered,  everything will be smooth and looking just like it did before. As the  bait is fastened, the wolf can not take it away, and in trying to  pull it up, will step in one of the traps. He is almost certain to  get in another one when he commences to struggle, and there is little  danger of him escaping. If a place can be found where the traps may  be set between bunches of weeds, cactus, etc., so much the better.      [Illustration: Bank Set for Wolf and Coyote.]    Another very good method, is to set a trap on top of a straight or  over-hanging bank, from four to eight feet high, so that when the  animal is caught it will leap or fall over the bank and be unable to  get back, where it would have a chance to struggle. The set is made  as follows: Find two bunches of cactus, growing on the top of the  bank, fix the bait on the very edge of the bank, between the two  bunches of cactus. Fasten the bait with a small stake, and drive the  stake out of sight in the bait. Stake the trap just the length of the  chain from the edge of the bank, driving stake out of sight, and set  the trap between the cactus and about twenty inches back from the  bait, somewhat farther if grey wolves are expected. Cover the trap  very carefully. If two bunches of cactus can not be found growing  close together, get some and place it there, so that it will look  natural, and have the appearance of having grown there.    A single trap may be set almost anywhere, and small pieces of bait  scattered around the trap. In this way you can bait the trap without  dismounting from your horse and avoid leaving human scent.    Mr. Vasma Brown, a noted trapper of Texas, gives the following  method: \"Take a large piece of fresh meat and drag it along a trail.  Stop occasionally and set a trap, just outside of the edge of the  trail, where the stock will not step in it. Dig out a place for the  trap and set the trap, covering first with a piece of paper and  finishing with sand, leaving the place looking just like it did  before. Cut some of the meat in small pieces and scatter them around  the trap. Use no scent; fresh pork is the best scent you can get. If  you can find some animal that the wolves themselves have killed, do  not fail to set traps there immediately.\"    When trapping around a large bait, sometimes the animals will not  approach close enough to be caught. In such cases a small bait may  sometimes be used to advantage, by setting traps a short distance  away. The tail of a skunk is said to be an unfailing lure. Do not  smoke or grease your traps or the wolf is sure to locate them at  once.    Sometimes a badger will be caught in a wolf trap. If so, do not skin  it, but kill it and set the trap close by. It will make a fine bait,  and the trap may be set in the ground that the animal has dug up,  leaving no signs of human presence.    When trapping during freezing weather, fill in around the jaws and  springs of the traps with sage leaves, or some similar dry material,  before covering with dirt.    Always carry a rifle with you when tending the traps. You will get  shots at wolves or coyotes almost every day.    When visiting wolf traps, always go on horseback and if possible  avoid dismounting near the traps.    Dark, cold, stormy nights are the best for the wolf trapper.    Use plenty of traps. The more chances you have, the better success  you will have.    Sometimes a coyote will uncover a trap or dig it up and spring it.  Nothing can prevent this. Your only remedy is to have lots of traps  set, and if he fools you in one set, you may fool him in another.    In warm weather, if you can set out a line of traps just before a  rain, your chances for making a good catch are very good, as the rain  washes away all human odors, and helps to smooth over the sets. In  winter, a light snow fall will often help to increase the catch.    The tracks of the wolf resemble those of the dog and fox. An average  full grown grey wolf will make a foot print about three inches wide  and four inches long and will step about twenty inches. The average  sized coyote will make a footprint about two inches in length and the  length of step is about sixteen inches.      [Illustration: The Grizzly Bear]        CHAPTER XII.    THE BEAR.    The bear family is a large one, and its members are found scattered  over the greater part of the globe, Australia and Africa being  excepted. They range through all latitudes, from the equator to the  poles. The following species have been described by naturalists:  Polar bear, grizzly bear, European Brown bear, American Black bear,  Alaskan Brown bear, Inland White bear, Glacier bear of Alaska,  Asiatic bear, Siberian bear, Spectacled bear of South America,  Thibetan bear, Bornean bear and Malay bear. The three latter are  called Sun bears, from their habit of basking in the rays of the  mid-day sun. They are the smallest members of the family and live  exclusively on vegetables.    Bears differ from each other in consequences of the differences of  climate, more than almost any other animal. Those that inhabit the  far north and such high, cold regions as the Rocky mountains, are  monsters, of great strength and ferocity, while those that inhabit  warm countries are small, feeble and inoffensive. The smallest of all  is the Bornean bear, while the Alaskan Brown bear is probably the  largest. The Grizzly or Silver Tip, and the Polar bears are very  large.    The American Black bear is probably the most numerous of the family,  and is one of most interest to the trappers. With the exception of  the prairie country, they are found scattered over almost all of the  United States, and a large part of Canada and Alaska. The Cinnamon is  only a color variety of the Black bear, differing only in color. Both  kinds are found in the same litter. In some sections, as for instance  in some of the northwestern states, and in Mexico, the Cinnamon bear  predominates, while in the east and north they are very rare. The  average weight of the Black bear, when full grown, is from two  hundred to three hundred pounds, but specimens have been killed  weighing far more than these figures. The fur is fine and soft and  usually of a jet black color.    Bears of all kinds, with the exception of the Sun bears and the Polar  bear, feed on both vegetable and animal food. The Polar bear lives  entirely on fish and flesh. Bears, with the exception of the Polar  species, hibernate in winter. They usually den in the ground or  rocks, but sometimes in a hollow log or tree.    The mating season is in July and August and the young, usually two,  are born in January, February and March. They remain with the mother  until fall, and sometimes longer.    In sections where they are found in fair numbers, they form trails  through passes in the mountains, along the bottoms of the cliffs,  around points of the lakes, and in other places of like nature. These  trails may be easily distinguished from the paths of other animals,  by the marks on the trees. At intervals, all along the trail, the  bear will stand on his hind feet, by the side of a tree, gnaw a  circle around the tree,"]]]
