How would you like that?\" said  Mrs. Jo, throwing a great chintz curtain down on his head.    \"Very much, try it and see,\" and the amiable Father Bhaer went singing  and tapping about the house like a mammoth woodpecker.    \"Put the soda into the cream, and when it 'fizzles,' as Demi says, stir  it into the flour, and beat it up as hard as ever you can. Have your  griddle hot, butter it well, and then fry away till I come back,\" and  Aunt Jo vanished also.    Such a clatter as the little spoon made, and such a beating as the  batter got, it quite foamed, I assure you; and when Daisy poured some  on to the griddle, it rose like magic into a puffy flapjack that made  Demi's mouth water. To be sure, the first one stuck and scorched,  because she forgot the butter, but after that first failure all went  well, and six capital little cakes were safely landed in a dish.    \"I think I like maple-syrup better than sugar,\" said Demi, from his  arm-chair where he had settled himself after setting the table in a new  and peculiar manner.    \"Then go and ask Asia for some,\" answered Daisy, going into the  bath-room to wash her hands.    While the nursery was empty something dreadful happened. You see, Kit  had been feeling hurt all day because he had carried meat safely and yet  got none to pay him. He was not a bad dog, but he had his little faults  like the rest of us, and could not always resist temptation. Happening  to stroll into the nursery at that moment, he smelt the cakes, saw them  unguarded on the low table, and never stopping to think of consequences,  swallowed all six at one mouthful. I am glad to say that they were very  hot, and burned him so badly that he could not repress a surprised yelp.  Daisy heard it, ran in, saw the empty dish, also the end of a yellow  tail disappearing under the bed. Without a word she seized that tail,  pulled out the thief, and shook him till his ears flapped wildly, then  bundled him down-stairs to the shed, where he spent a lonely evening in  the coal-bin.    Cheered by the sympathy which Demi gave her, Daisy made another bowlful  of batter, and fried a dozen cakes, which were even better than the  others. Indeed, Uncle Fritz after eating two sent up word that he had  never tasted any so nice, and every boy at the table below envied Demi  at the flapjack party above.    It was a truly delightful supper, for the little teapot lid only fell  off three times and the milk jug upset but once; the cakes floated in  syrup, and the toast had a delicious beef-steak flavor, owing to cook's  using the gridiron to make it on. Demi forgot philosophy, and stuffed  like any carnal boy, while Daisy planned sumptuous banquets, and the  dolls looked on smiling affably.    \"Well, dearies, have you had a good time?\" asked Mrs. Jo, coming up with  Teddy on her shoulder.    \"A very good time. I shall come again soon,\" answered Demi, with  emphasis.    \"I'm afraid you have eaten too much, by the look of that table.\"    \"No, I haven't; I only ate fifteen cakes, and they were very little  ones,\" protested Demi, who had kept his sister busy supplying his plate.    \"They won't hurt him, they are so nice,\" said Daisy, with such a funny  mixture of maternal fondness and housewifely pride that Aunt Jo could  only smile and say:    \"Well, on the whole, the new game is a success then?\"    \"I like it,\" said Demi, as if his approval was all that was necessary.    \"It is the dearest play ever made!\" cried Daisy, hugging her little  dish-tub as she proposed to wash up the cups. \"I just wish everybody  had a sweet cooking stove like mine,\" she added, regarding it with  affection.    \"This play out to have a name,\" said Demi, gravely removing the syrup  from his countenance with his tongue.    \"It has.\"    \"Oh, what?\" asked both children eagerly.    \"Well, I think we will call it Pattypans,\" and Aunt Jo retired,  satisfied with the success of her last trap to catch a sunbeam.        CHAPTER VI. A FIRE BRAND    \"Please, ma'am, could I speak to you? It is something very important,\"  said Nat, popping his head in at the door of Mrs. Bhaer's room.    It was the fifth head which had popped in during the last half-hour; but  Mrs. Jo was used to it, so she looked up, and said, briskly,    \"What is it, my lad?\"    Nat came in, shut the door carefully behind him, and said in an eager,  anxious tone,    \"Dan has come.\"    \"Who is Dan?\"    \"He's a boy I used to know when I fiddled round the streets. He sold  papers, and he was kind to me, and I saw him the other day in town, and  told him how nice it was here, and he's come.\"    \"But, my dear boy, that is rather a sudden way to pay a visit.\"    \"Oh, it isn't a visit; he wants to stay if you will let him!\" said Nat  innocently.    \"Well, I don't know about that,\" began Mrs. Bhaer, rather startled by  the coolness of the proposition.    \"Why, I thought you liked to have poor boys come and live with you,  and be kind to 'em as you were to me,\" said Nat, looking surprised and  alarmed.    \"So I do, but I like to know something about them first. I have to  choose them, because there are so many. I have not room for all. I wish  I had.\"    \"I told him to come because I thought you'd like it, but if there isn't  room he can go away again,\" said Nat, sorrowfully.    The boy's confidence in her hospitality touched Mrs. Bhaer, and she  could not find the heart to disappoint his hope, and spoil his kind  little plan, so she said,    \"Tell me about this Dan.\"    \"I don't know any thing, only he hasn't got any folks, and he's poor,  and he was good to me, so I'd like to be good to him if I could.\"    \"Excellent reasons every one; but really, Nat, the house is full, and  I don't know where I could put him,\" said Mrs. Bhaer, more and more  inclined to prove herself the haven of refuge he seemed to think her.    \"He could have my bed, and I could sleep in the barn. It isn't cold  now, and I don't mind, I used to sleep anywhere with father,\" said Nat,  eagerly.    Something in his speech and face made Mrs. Jo put her hand on his  shoulder, and say in her kindest tone:    \"Bring in your friend, Nat; I think we must find room for him without  giving him your place.\"    Nat joyfully ran off, and soon returned followed by a most  unprepossessing boy, who slouched in and stood looking about him, with a  half bold, half sullen look, which made Mrs. Bhaer say to herself, after  one glance,    \"A bad specimen, I am afraid.\"    \"This is Dan,\" said Nat, presenting him as if sure of his welcome.    \"Nat tells me you would like to come and stay with us,\" began Mrs. Jo,  in a friendly tone.    \"Yes,\" was the gruff reply.    \"Have you no friends to take care of you?\"    \"No.\"    \"Say, 'No, ma'am,'\" whispered Nat.    \"Shan't neither,\" muttered Dan.    \"How old are you?\"    \"About fourteen.\"    \"You look older. What can you do?\"    \"'Most anything.\"    \"If you stay here we shall want you to do as the others do, work and  study as well as play. Are you willing to agree to that?\"    \"Don't mind trying.\"    \"Well, you can stay a few days, and we will see how we get on together.  Take him out, Nat, and amuse him till Mr. Bhaer comes home, when we will  settle about the matter,\" said Mrs. Jo, finding it rather difficult to  get on with this cool young person, who fixed his big black eyes on her  with a hard, suspicious expression, sorrowfully unboyish.    \"Come on, Nat,\" he said, and slouched out again.    \"Thank you, ma'am,\" added Nat, as he followed him, feeling without quite  understanding the difference in the welcome given to him and to his  ungracious friend.    \"The fellows are having a circus out in the barn; don't you want to come  and see it?\" he asked, as they came down the wide steps on to the lawn.    \"Are they big fellows?\" said Dan.    \"No; the big ones are gone fishing.\"    \"Fire away, then,\" said Dan.    Nat led him to the great barn and introduced him to his set, who were  disporting themselves among the half-empty lofts. A large circle was  marked out with hay on the wide floor, and in the middle stood Demi with  a long whip, while Tommy, mounted on the much-enduring Toby, pranced  about the circle playing being a monkey.    \"You must pay a pin apiece, or you can't see the show,\" said Stuffy,  who stood by the wheelbarrow in which sat the band, consisting of a  pocket-comb blown upon by Ned, and a toy drum beaten spasmodically by  Rob.    \"He's company, so I'll pay for both,\" said Nat, handsomely, as he stuck  two crooked pins in the dried mushroom which served as money-box.    With a nod to the company they seated themselves on a couple of boards,  and the performance went on. After the monkey act, Ned gave them a fine  specimen of his agility by jumping over an old chair, and running up  and down ladders, sailor fashion. Then Demi danced a jig with a gravity  beautiful to behold. Nat was called upon to wrestle with Stuffy, and  speedily laid that stout youth upon the ground. After this, Tommy  proudly advanced to turn a somersault, an accomplishment which he had  acquired by painful perseverance, practising in private till every joint  of his little frame was black and blue. His feats were received with  great applause, and he was about to retire, flushed with pride and a  rush of blood to the head, when a scornful voice in the audience was  heard to say,    \"Ho! that ain't any thing!\"    \"Say that again, will you?\" and Tommy bristled up like an angry  turkey-cock.    \"Do you want to fight?\" said Dan, promptly descending from the barrel  and doubling up his fists in a business-like manner.    \"No, I don't;\" and the candid Thomas retired a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27887"],[0,"Wild Animals at Home (#14)"],[1,"ild-eyed visitors to do so as a necessary part of  their education. For few indeed there are in the land to-day that  realize the gentleness and forbearance of this righteous little brother  of ours, who, though armed with a weapon that will put the biggest and  boldest to flight or disastrous defeat, yet refrains from using it until  in absolute peril of his life, and then only after several warnings.    By way of rounding out this statement, I present a picture of my little  daughter playing among the Skunks, and need add only that they are  full-grown specimens in full possession of all their faculties.

By kindness and care and the help of an attached  little steam-gauge speedometer plumb compass, that gave accurate aim,  improved perpendicularity, and increased efficiency to the efforts of  the strenuous excavator, he had been able to produce a dirigible Badger  that was certain to displace all other machinery for digging postholes.    Unfortunately I was in a position to disprove this pretty conceit. But I  think of it every time I put my foot in a Badger hole. Such lovely  holes, so plentiful, so worse than useless where the Badger has  thoughtlessly located them. If only we could harness and direct such  excavatory energies.    [Illustration]    This, indeed, is the only quarrel civilized man can pick with the honest  Badger. He _will_ dig holes that endanger horse's legs and rider's  necks. He may destroy Gophers, Ground-squirrels, Prairie-dogs, insects,  and a hundred enemies of the farm; he may help the crops in a thousand  different ways, _but he will dig post-holes where they are not wanted_,  and this indiscretion has made many enemies for the kindest and  sturdiest of all the squatters on the plains.      THE VALIANT, HARMLESS BADGER    From the Saskatchewan to Mexico he ranges, and from Illinois to  California, wherever there are dry, open plains supplied with  Ground-squirrels and water.    [Illustration]    Many times, in crossing the rolling plains of Montana, the uplands of  Arizona and New Mexico, or the prairies of Manitoba, I have met with  Mittenusk, as the redmen call him. Like a big white stone perched on  some low mound he seems. But the wind makes cracks in it at places, and  then it moves--giving plain announcement to the world with eyes to see  that this is a Badger sunning himself. He seldom allows a near approach,  even in the Yellowstone, where he is safe, and is pretty sure to drop  down out of sight in his den long before one gets within camera range.  The Badger is such a subterranean, nocturnal creature at most times that  for long his home life escaped our observation, but at last a few  paragraphs, if not a chapter of it, have been secured, and we find that  this shy creature, in ill odour among cattlemen as noted, is a rare and  lovely character when permitted to unbend in a congenial group. Sturdy,  strong and dogged, and brave to the last ditch, the more we know of the  Badger the more we respect him.    Let us pass lightly over the facts that in makeup he is between a Bear  and a Weasel, and that he weighs about twenty pounds, and has a soft  coat of silvery gray and some label marks of black on his head.    He feeds chiefly on Ground-squirrels, which he digs out, but does not  scorn birds' eggs, or even fruit and grain at times. Except for an  occasional sun-bath, he spends the day in his den and travels about  mostly by night. He minds his own business, if let alone, but woe be to  the creature of the plains that tries to molest him, for he has the  heart of a bulldog, the claws of a Grizzly, and the jaws of a small  crocodile.    I shall never forget my first meeting with Old Silver-grizzle. It was on  the plains of the Souris, in 1882. I saw this broad, low, whitish  creature on the prairie, not far from the trail, and, impelled by the  hunter instinct so strong in all boys, I ran toward him. He dived into a  den, but the one he chose proved to be barely three feet deep, and I  succeeded in seizing the Badger's short thick tail. Gripping it firmly  with both hands, I pulled and pulled, but he was stronger than I. He  braced himself against the sides of the den and defied me. With anything  like fair play, he would have escaped, but I had accomplices, and the  details of what followed are not pleasant reminiscences. But I was very  young at the time, and that was my first Badger. I wanted his skin, and  I had not learned to respect his exemplary life and dauntless spirit.    In the summer of 1897 I was staying at Yancey's in the Park. Daily I saw  signs of Badgers about, and one morning while prowling, camera in hand,  I saw old Gray-coat wandering on the prairie, looking for fresh  Ground-squirrel holes. Keeping low, I ran toward him. He soon sensed me,  and to my surprise came rushing toward me, uttering sharp snarls. This  one was behaving differently from any Badger I had seen before, but  evidently he was going to give me a chance for a picture. After that was  taken, doubtless I could save myself by running. We were within thirty  yards of each other and both coming strong, when \"crash\" I went into a  Badger hole _I_ had not seen, just as he went \"thump\" down tail first  into a hole _he_ had not seen. For a moment we both looked very foolish,  but he recovered first, and rushing a few yards nearer, plunged into a  deep and wide den toward which he evidently had been heading from the  first.      HIS SOCIABLE BENT    The strongest peculiar trait of the Badger is perhaps his  sociability--sociability being, of course, a very different thing from  gregariousness. Usually there are two Badgers in each den. Nothing  peculiar about that, but there are several cases on record of a Badger,  presumably a bachelor or a widower, sharing his life with some totally  different animal. In some instances that other animal has been a Coyote;  and the friendship really had its foundation in enmity and intended  robbery.    This is the probable history of a typical case: The Badger, being a  mighty miner and very able to dig out the Ground-squirrels of the  prairie, was followed about by a Coyote, whose speed and agility kept  him safe from the Badger's jaws, while he hovered close by, knowing  quite well that when the Badger was digging out the Ground-squirrels at  their front door, these rodents were very apt to bolt by the back door,  and thus give the Coyote an excellent chance for a cheap dinner.    So the Coyote acquired the habit of following the hard-working Badger.  At first, no doubt, the latter resented the parasite that dogged his  steps, but becoming used to it \"first endured, then pitied, then  embraced\", or, to put it more mildly, he got accustomed to the Coyote's  presence, and being of a kindly disposition, forgot his enmity and  thenceforth they contentedly lived their lives together. I do not know  that they inhabited the same den. Yet that would not be impossible,  since similar things are reported of the British Badger and the Fox.    More than one observer has seen a Badger and a Coyote travelling  together, sometimes one leading, sometimes the other. Evidently it was a  partnership founded on good-will, however it may have been begun.      THE STORY OF THE KINDLY BADGER    But the most interesting case, and one which I might hesitate to  reproduce but for the witnesses, reached me at Winnipeg.    [Illustration]    In 1871 there was a family named Service living at Bird's Hill, on the  prairie north of Winnipeg. They had one child, a seven-year-old boy  named Harry. He was a strange child, very small for his age, and shy  without being cowardly. He had an odd habit of following dogs, chickens,  pigs, and birds, imitating their voices and actions, with an exactness  that onlookers sometimes declared to be uncanny. One day he had gone  quietly after a Prairie Chicken that kept moving away from him without  taking flight, clucking when she clucked, and nodding his head or  shaking his \"wings\" when she did. So he wandered on and on, till the  house was hidden from view behind the trees that fringed the river, and  the child was completely lost.    There was nothing remarkable in his being away for several hours, but a  heavy thunderstorm coming up that afternoon called attention to the fact  that the boy was missing, and when the first casual glance did not  discover him it became serious and a careful search was begun.    Father and mother, with the near neighbours, scoured the prairie till  dark, and began the next day at dawn, riding in all directions, calling,  and looking for signs. After a day or two the neighbours gave it up,  believing that the child was drowned and carried away by the river. But  the parents continued their search even long after all hope seemed  dead. And there was no hour of the day when that stricken mother did not  send up a prayer for heavenly help; nor any night when she did not kneel  with her husband and implore the One who loved and blessed the babes of  Jerusalem to guard her little one and bring him back in safety.      THE EVIL ONE    [Illustration]    There was one neighbour of the family who joined in the search that had  nevertheless incurred the bitter dislike of little Harry Service. The  feeling was partly a mere baby instinct, but pointedly because of the  man's vicious cruelty to the animals, wild or tame, that came within his  power. Only a week before he had set steel traps at a den where he  chanced to find a "]]]
