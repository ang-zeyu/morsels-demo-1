[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38207"],[0,"On the Origin and Metamorphoses of Insects (#14)"],[1," often do we meet with travesties of it like that which I have just  quoted, that it is well worth while to consider the stages through which  some group, say for instance that of insects, have probably come to be  what they are, assuming them to have developed under natural laws from  simpler organisms. The question is one of great difficulty. It is hardly  necessary to say that insects cannot have passed through all the lower  forms of animal life, and naturalists do not at present agree as to the  actual line of their development.    In the case of insects, the gradual course of evolution through which  the present condition of the group has probably been reached, has been  discussed by Mr. Darwin, by Fritz Mueller, Haeckel, Brauer, myself and  others.    In other instances Palaeontology throws much light on this question.  Leidy has shown that the milk-teeth of the genus _Equus_ resemble the  permanent teeth of the ancient _Anchitherium_, while the milk-teeth of  _Anchitherium_ again approximate to the dental system of the still  earlier _Merychippus_. Ruetimeyer, while calling attention to this  interesting observation, adds that the milk-teeth of _Equus caballus_ in  the same way, and still more those of _E. fossilis_, resemble the  permanent teeth of _Hipparion_.    \"If we were not acquainted with the horse,\" says Flower,[54] \"we could  scarcely conceive of an animal whose only support was the tip of a  single toe on each extremity, to say nothing of the singular  conformation of its teeth and other organs. So striking have these  characters appeared to many zoologists, that the animals possessing them  have been reckoned as an order apart, called Solidungula; but  palaeontology has revealed that in the structure of its skull, its teeth,  its limbs, the horse is nothing more than a modified _Palaeotherium_; and  though still with gaps in certain places, many of the intermediate  stages of these modifications are already known to us, being the  _Palaeotherium_, _Anchitherium_, _Merychippus_, and _Hipparion_.\"    \"All Echinoids,\" says A. Agassiz,[55] \"pass, in their early stages,  through a condition which recalls to us the first Echinoids which made  their appearance in geological ages.\" On embryological grounds, he  observes, we should \"place true Echini lowest, then the Clypeastroids,  next the Echinolamps, and finally the Spatangoids.\" Now among the  Echinoids of the Trias there are no Clypeastroids, Echinolamps, or  Spatangoids. The Clypeastroids make their appearance in the Lias, the  Echinolamps in the Jurassic, while the Spatangoids commence in the  Cretaceous period.    Again[56] \"in the Radiates, the Acalephs in their first stages of  growth, that is, in their Hydroid condition, remind us of the adult  forms among Polyps, showing the structural rank of the Acalephs to be  the highest, since they pass beyond a stage which is permanent with the  Polyps; while the Adult forms of the Acalephs have in their turn a  certain resemblance to the embryonic phases of the class next above  them, the Echinoderms; within the limits of the classes, the same  correspondence exists as between the different orders; the embryonic  forms of the highest Polyps recall the adult forms of the lower ones,  and the same is true of the Acalephs as far as these phenomena have been  followed and compared among them.\" Indeed, the accomplished authors from  whom I have taken the above quotation, do not hesitate to say[57] that  \"whenever such comparisons have been successfully carried out, the  result is always the same; the present representatives of the fossil  types recall in their embryonic condition the ancient forms, and often  explain their true position in the animal kingdom.\"    Fossil insects are unfortunately rare, there being but few strata in  which the remains of this group are well preserved. Moreover,  well-characterized Orthoptera and Neuroptera occur as early as the  Devonian strata; Coleoptera and Hemiptera in the Coal-measures;  Hymenoptera and Diptera in the Jurassic; Lepidoptera, on the contrary,  not until the Tertiary. But although it appears from these facts that,  as far as our present information goes, the Orthoptera and Neuroptera  are the most ancient orders, it is not, I think, conceivable that the  latter should have been derived from any known species of the former; on  the other hand, the earliest known Neuroptera and Orthoptera, though in  some respects less specialized than existing forms, are as truly, and as  well characterized, Insects, as any now existing; nor are we acquainted  with any earlier forms, which in any way tend to bridge over the gap  between them and lower groups, though, as we shall see, there are types  yet existing which throw much light on the subject.    In the consideration then of this question, we must rely principally on  Embryology and Development. I have already referred to the cases in  which species, very unlike in their mature condition, are very  similar one to another when young. Haeckel, in his \"Naturliche  Schoepfungsgeschichte,\" gives a diagram which illustrates this very well  as regards Crustacea. Pls. 1-4 show the same to be the case with  Insects.    The Stag-beetle, the Dragon-fly, the Moth, the Bee, the Ant, the Gnat,  the Grasshopper,--these and other less familiar types seem at first to  have little in common. They differ in size, in form, in colour, in  habits, and modes of life. Yet the researches of entomologists,  following the clue supplied by the illustrious Savigny, have proved, not  only that while differing greatly in details, they are constructed on  one common plan; but also that other groups, as for instance, Crustacea  (Lobsters, Crabs, &c.) and Arachnida (Spiders and Mites), can be shown  to be fundamentally similar. In Pl. 4 I have figured the larvae of an  _Ephemera_ (Fig. 1), of a _Meloe_ (Fig. 2), of a Dragon-fly (Fig. 3), of a  Sitaris (Fig. 4), of a _Campodea_ (Fig. 5), of a _Dyticus_ (Fig. 6), of a  Termite (Fig. 7), of a _Stylops_ (Fig. 8), and of a _Thrips_ (Fig. 9). All  these larvae possess many characters in common. The mature forms are  represented in the corresponding figures of Plate 3, and it will at once  be seen how considerably they differ from one another. The same fact is  also illustrated in Figs. 48-55, where Figs. 48-51 represent the larval  states of the mature forms represented in Figs. 52-55. Fig. 48 is the  larva of a moth, _Agrotis suffusa_ (Fig. 52); Fig. 49 of a beetle,  _Haltica_ (Fig. 53); Fig. 50 of a Saw-fly, _Cimbex_ (Fig. 54); and Fig.  51 of a Centipede, _Julus_ (Fig. 55).    [Illustration: FIG. 48, Larva of Moth (_Agrotis suffusa_), after  Packard. 49, Larva of Beetle (_Haltica_), after Westwood. 50, Larva of  Saw-fly (_Cimbex_), Brischke and Zaddach. Beob. ub d. arten. der Blatt  und Holzwespen, Fig. 8. 51, Larva of _Julus_. Newport, Philos.  Transactions, 1841.]    Thus, then, although it can be demonstrated that perfect insects,  however much they differ in appearance, are yet reducible to one type,  the fact becomes much more evident if we compare the larvae. M.  Brauer[58] and I[59] have pointed out that two types of larvae, which I  have proposed to call _Campodea_-form and _Lindia_-form, and which Packard  has named Leptiform and Eruciform, run through the principal groups of  insects. This is obviously a fact of great importance: as all individual  _Meloes_ are derived from a form resembling Pl. 2, Fig. 2, it is surely no  rash hypothesis to suggest that the genus itself may have been so.    [Illustration: FIG. 52, _Agrotis suffusa_ (after Packard). 53, _Haltica_  (after Westwood).]    [Illustration: FIG. 54, _Cimbex_, Brischae and Zaddach. l.c. T. 2, Fig.  9.]    [Illustration: FIG. 55. _Julus_ (after Gervais).]    Firstly, however, let me say a word as to the general Insect type. It  may be described shortly as consisting of animals possessing a head,  with mouth parts, eyes and antennae; a many segmented body, with three  pairs of legs on the segments immediately following the head; with, when  mature, either one or two pairs of wings, generally with caudal  appendages I will not now enter into a description of their internal  anatomy. It will be seen that, except as regards the wings, Pl. 4, Fig.  4, representing the larva of a small beetle named _Sitaris_, answers very  well to this description. Many other Beetles are developed from larvae  closely resembling those of _Meloe_ (Pl. 4, Fig. 2), and Sitaris (Pl. 4,  Fig. 4); in fact--except those species the larvae of which, as, for  instance of the Weevils (Pl. 2, Fig. 6), are internal feeders, and do  not require legs--we may say that the Coleoptera generally are derived  from larvae of this type.    I will now pass to a second order, the Neuroptera. Pl. 4, Fig. 1,  represents the larva of _Chloeon_, a species the metamorphoses of which I  described some years ago in the Linnean Transactions,[60] and it is  obvious that in essential points it closely resembles the form to which  I have just alluded.    The Orthoptera, again, the order to which Grasshoppers, Crickets,  Locusts, &c. belong, commence life in a similar condition; and the same  may also be said of the Trichoptera.    The larvae of Bees when they quit the egg are entirely legless, but in an  earlier stage they possess well-marked rudiments of thoracic legs,  showing, as it seems to me, that their apodal condition is an adaptation  to their circumstances. Other Hymenopterous larvae, those for example of  _Sirex_ (Fig. 9), and of the Saw-flies (Fig. 50) have well-developed  thoracic legs.    From the difference in external form, and especially from the large  comparative size of the abdomen, these larvae, as well as those of  Lepidoptera (Fig. 48), have generally been classed with the maggots of  Flies, Weevils, &c., rather than with the more active form of larva just  adverted to. This seems to me, as I have already pointed out,[61] to be  a mistake. The caterpillar type"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38233"],[0,"Birds Every Child Should Know (#14)"],[1,"sparrow's \"merry cheer\" almost  every month in the year, in fair weather or in foul, in the middle of  the night and in broad daylight, when a little mate is to be wooed  with light-hearted vivacity, when two, three, or even four broods  severely tax the singer's energy through the summer, when clothes must  be changed in August and when the cold of approaching winter drives  every other singer from the choir. The most familiar song--for this  tuneful sparrow has at least six similar but slightly different  melodies in his repertoire--begins with a full round note three times  repeated, then dashes off into a sweet, short, lively, intricate  strain that almost trips itself in its hasty utterance. Few people  {110} whistle well enough to imitate it. Few birds can rival the  musical ecstasy.    Artlessly self-confident, not at all bashful, the song sparrow mounts  to a conspicuous perch when he sings, rather than let his efforts be  muffled by foliage. Don't mistake him for an English sparrow; notice  his distinguishing marks: the fine dark streaks on his light breast  tend to form a larger blotch in the centre. You see him singing on the  extended branch of some low tree, on the topmost twig of a bush, on a  fence, or a piazza railing from which he dives downward into the  grass, or flies straight along into the bushes, his tail working like  a pump handle as if to help his flight. Very rarely he flies upward.  Diving into a bush is one of his specialties. He best likes to live in  regions near water.    The song sparrows that come almost every day in the year among many  other birds to my piazza roof for waste canary seed and such  delicacies, show refreshing spirit in driving off the English sparrows  who, let it be recorded, can get not a morsel until the song sparrows  are abundantly satisfied. One of the latter is quite able to keep off  half a dozen of his English cousins. How does he do it? Not by his  superior size, for the measurements of both birds show that they are  about the same length although the song sparrow's slightly longer and  {111} more graceful tail makes him appear a trifle larger. Certainly  not by any rowdy, bold assaults, which are the English bird's  specialty. But by simply assuming superiority and expressing it only  by running in a threatening attitude toward each English sparrow who  dares to alight on the roof, does he bluff him into flying away again!  There is never a fight, not even an ill-mannered scolding, just quiet  monopoly for a few minutes, then a joyous outburst of song. After that  the English sparrows may take the songster's leavings.      SWAMP SPARROW    Where rails thread their way among the rushes, and red-winged  blackbirds, marsh wrens, and Maryland yellow-throats like to live,  there listen for the _tweet-tweet-tweet_ of the swamp sparrow. It is a  sweet but rather monotonous little song that he repeats over and over  again to the mate who is busy about her grassy nest in a tussock not  far away, but well hidden among the rank swamp growth.    Some children say it is difficult to tell the plain gray-breasted  swamp sparrow from the larger song sparrow with the streaked breast;  but I am sure their eyes are not so sharp as yours.    {112}    FIELD SPARROW    While the neighbourly song sparrow and the swamp sparrow delight to be  near water, the field sparrow chooses to live in dry uplands where  stunted bushes and cedars cover the hills and overgrown old fields,  and towhees and brown thrashers keep him company. He is not fond of  human society, however, and usually flies away with wavering,  uncertain flight from bush to bush rather than submit to a close  scrutiny of his bright chestnut brown back and crown, flesh-coloured  bill, gray eyebrow, grayish throat, buffy breast and light feet.  Because his tail is a trifle longer than the chippy's he is slightly  larger than the smallest of our sparrows. Unless you notice that his  bill is not black and his head not marked with black and gray streaks  like the chippy's, you might easily mistake him for his sociable,  confiding little cousin who comes hopping to the door.    How differently he sings! Listen for him some evening after sunset  when his simple vesper hymn, clear, plaintive, sweet, rings from the  bush where he perches especially for the performance. Scarcely any two  field sparrows sing precisely alike. Most of them, however, begin with  three clear, smooth, leisurely whistles--_cher-wee, cher-wee,  cher-wee_--then hurry through the other notes--_cheo,  cheo-dee-dee-eee, e, e_--which run rapidly into a trill before they  die away. {113} Others reverse the time and diminish the measures  toward the close. However sung, the song, which makes the uplands  tuneful all day and every day from April to August, does not vary its  quality, which is as fine as the vesper sparrow's.    Hatched in a bush, and almost never seen apart from one, this humble  little bird might well be called the bush sparrow.      VESPER SPARROW    To name this little dingy sparrow that haunts the open fields and  dusty roadsides, you must notice the white feather on each side of his  tail as he spreads it and flies before you to alight upon a fence.  Like the song sparrow, this cousin has some fine dark streaks on his  throat and breast. If you get near enough you will notice that his  wing coverts, which are a bright chestnut brown, make the rest of his  sparrow plumage look particularly pale and dull. Some people call him  the bay-winged bunting; others, the grass finch, because he nests,  like the meadow-lark and many other foolish birds, on the ground where  mice, snakes, mowing machines and cats often make sad havoc of his  young family.    {114}    The field sparrow, as we have seen, prefers neglected old fields  overgrown with bushes, but the vesper sparrow chooses more broad,  open, breezy, grassy country. When busy picking up insects and seed on  the ground, he takes no time for singing, but keeps steadily at work,  unlike the vireos that sing between bites. With him music is a  momentous matter to which he is quite willing to devote half an hour  at a time. He usually mounts to a fence rail or a tree before  beginning the repetitions of his lovely, serene vesper which is most  likely to be heard about sunset, or at sunrise, if you are not a  sleepy-head. Like the rose-breasted grosbeak, he has the delightful  habit of singing through the early hours of the summer night.      ENGLISH SPARROW    Is there a boy or girl in America who does not already know this  saucy, keen-witted little gamin who thrives where other birds would  starve; who insists upon thrusting himself where he is not wanted, not  only in other bird's houses, but about the cornices, pillars, and  shutters of our own, where his noise and dirt drive good housekeepers  frantic; who, without any weapons but his boldness and impudence to  fight with, fears neither man nor beast, and who {115} multiplies as  fast as the rabbit, so that he is rapidly inheriting the earth? Even  children who have never been out of the slums know at least this one  bird, this ever-present nuisance, for he chirps and chatters as  cheerfully in the reeking gutters as in the prettiest gardens; he hops  with equal calm about the horse's feet and trolley cars in crowded  city thoroughfares, as he does about flowery fields and quiet country  lanes; he will pick at the overflow from garbage pails on the sidewalk  in front of teeming tenements and manure on the city pavements with  quite as much relish as he will eat the fresh clean seed spilled by a  canary, or cake-crumbs from my lady's hand. Intense cold he endures  with cheerful fortitude and as intense mid-summer heat without losing  his astonishing vitality. Is it any wonder that a bird so readily  adaptable to all sorts of conditions should thrive like a weed and  beat his way around the world?    Now that he has gained such headway in this country his extermination  is practically impossible, since a single pair of sparrows might have  275,716,983,698 descendants in ten years! It is foolish to talk of  ridding the land of these vermin of birddom. The conditions that kept  them in check at home are lacking in this great land of freedom and so  we Americans must pay the penalty for ignorantly tampering with  nature.    {116}    Sparrows were first imported into Brooklyn in 1851 to rid the shade  trees of inch worms. This feat they accomplished there and in New York  with neatness and despatch. Every one fed, petted, and coddled them  then. It was not until many years later that their true character came  to be thoroughly understood. Then it was found by scientific men in  Washington, after the fairest trial any culprits ever received, that  not all the insects and weed seeds they destroy compensate for the  damage they do in the farmer's grain fields, to say nothing of their  harassing and dispossessing other birds more desirable. But they kill  no birds, so we may hope that, in the course of time, our native  songsters may pluck up courage to claim their rights and hold their  own, learning from the sparrows the important lesson of adaptability.      CHIPPING SPARROW    _Called also: Chippy; Door-step Sparrow; Hair Sparrow._    This summer a pair of the sociable, friendly little chippies--the  smallest members of their clan--decided that they would build in a  little boxwood tree on the verandah of our house next to the front  door through which members of the family passed every hour of the day.
