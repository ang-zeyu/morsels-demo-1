What further shall we say? Is it not  lamentable thus to see so many old and honoured artists compelled, in  spite of history, to become pupils to masters so much younger and less  celebrated than themselves? I know that various writers have censured  Baldinucci as an historian of doubtful fidelity, artful in concealing or  misrepresenting facts, captious in expounding the opinions of Vasari,  and more intent on captivating than instructing his readers. I am not  ignorant that his system was controverted even in his own country, as  appears from his work published there, entitled _Delle Veglie_; and that  Signor Marmi, a learned Florentine, strongly suspected his fair dealing,  of which we shall adduce a proof under the Sienese school. Nevertheless  I take into account that he wrote in an age less informed in regard to  the history of painting, and that he defended an opinion then much more  common in Italy than at present. He had promised Cardinal Leopoldo de'  Medici to demonstrate it incontrovertibly for the honour of his country,  and of the house of Medici, and had received advice and assistance from  him in order to encourage him to defend it, and to refute the contrary  opinion. Under the necessity of answering Malvasia,[52] a severe writer  against Vasari, and of proving his assertion, that the people of  Bologna, no less than those of Siena, of Pisa, and other places, had  learned the art from the Florentines, he formed a false system, the  absurdity of which he did not immediately perceive; but he at last  discovered it, as Signor Piacenza observes, and succeeded in escaping  from its trammels. The most ingenious builders of systems have subjected  themselves very frequently to the same disadvantage, and the history of  literature abounds with similar instances.    Having examined this sophism, I cannot subscribe to the opinion of  Baldinucci; but shall comprise my own opinion in two propositions:--The  first is, That the improvement of painting is not due to Florence alone.  It has been remarked, that the career of human genius, in the progress  of the fine arts, is the same in every country. When the man is  dissatisfied with what the child learned, he gradually passes from the  ruder elements to what is less so, and from thence, to diligence and  precision; he afterwards advances to the grand, and the select, and at  length attains facility of execution.    Such was the progress of sculpture among the Grecians, and such has been  that of painting in our own country. When Correggio advanced from  laborious minuteness to grandeur, it was not necessary for him to know  that such was the progress of Raffaello, or, at any rate, to have  witnessed it: in like manner, nothing more was wanting to the painters  of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, than to learn that hitherto  they had pursued a wrong path; this was sufficient to guide them into a  better path, and it was not then untried; for sculpture had already  improved design. We have, in fact, seen the Pisani, and their scholars,  preceding the Florentines; and, as their precursors, diffusing a new  system of design over Italy. It would be injustice to overlook them in  the improvement of painting, in which design is of such importance; or  to suppose that they did not signally contribute to its improvement. But  if Italy be indebted solely to Cimabue and Giotto for its progress, all  the good artists should have come from Florence. And yet, in the  cathedral of Orvieto (to instance the finest work, perhaps, of that  age), we find, from the beginning of the fourteenth century, many  artists from various other places, who would not have been called to  ornament such a building, had they not previously enjoyed the reputation  of able masters.[53] Add to this, if we are to derive all painters from  those two masters, every style of painting should resemble that of their  Florentine disciples. But on examining the old paintings of Siena, of  Venice, of Bologna, and of Parma, they are found to be dissimilar in  idea, in choice of colouring, and in taste of composition. All, then,  are not derived from Florence.    My second proposition is, That no people then excelled in, nor  contributed, by example, so much to the progress of art as the  Florentines. Rival cities may boast artists of merit, even in the first  era of painting; their writers may deny the fame of Giotto and his  disciples; but truth is more powerful than declamation. Giotto was the  father of the new method of painting, as Boccaccio was called the father  of the new species of prose composition. After the time of the latter,  any subject could be elegantly treated of in prose; after the former,  painting could express all subjects with propriety. A Simon da Siena, a  Stefano da Firenze, a Pietro Laurati, added charms to the art; but they  and others owe to Giotto the transition from the old to a new manner. He  essayed it in Tuscany, and while yet a young man, greatly improved it,  to the general admiration of all classes. He did not leave Assisi until  called to Rome by Boniface VIII., nor did he take up his residence at  Avignon, until invited to France by Clement V. Before going there, he  was induced to stop at Padua, and on returning some years after, he  again resided at the same place. At that time many parts of Italy were  under a republican form of government; but abounded in potent families,  that bore sway in various quarters, and which, while adorning their  country, aimed at its subjugation. Giotto, beyond every other, was in  universal request, both at home and abroad. The Polentani of Ravenna,  the Malatesti of Rimino, the Estensi of Ferrara, the Visconti of Milan,  the Scala of Verona, Castruccio of Lucca, and also Robert, king of  Naples, sought to engage him with eagerness, and for some period  retained him in their service. Milan, Urbino, Arezzo, and Bologna, were  desirous to possess his works; and Pisa, that, in her _Campo Santo_,  afforded an opportunity for the choicest artists of Tuscany to vie with  one another,[54] as of old they contended at Corinth, and in Delphi,[55]  obtained from him those historic paintings from the life of Job, which  are greatly admired, though they are amongst his early productions. When  Giotto was no more, similar applause was bestowed on his disciples:  cities contended for the honour of inviting them, and they were even  more highly estimated than the native artists themselves. We shall find  Cavallini and Capanna in the Roman School; in that of Bologna the two  Faentini, Pace, and Ottaviano, with Guglielmo da Forli; Menabuoi at  Padua; Memmi, who was either a scholar or assistant of Giotto, at  Avignon; and we shall find traces of the successors of the same school  throughout all Italy. This work will indicate the names of some of them;  it will point out the style of others; without including the great  number who, in every province, have been withdrawn from our view, for  the purpose of replacing old pictures with others in the new manner.  Giotto thus became the model for students during the whole of the  fourteenth century, as was Raffaello in the sixteenth, and the Caracci  in the subsequent century: nor can I find a fourth manner that has been  so generally received in Italy as that of those three schools. There  have been some who, from the inspiration of their own genius, had  adopted a new manner, but they were little known or admired beyond the  precincts of their own country. Of the Florentines alone can it be  asserted, that they diffused the modern style from one extremity of  Italy to the other: in the restoration of painting, though not all, yet  the chief praise belongs to them; and this forms my second proposition.    I proceed more willingly to the sequel of my work, having escaped from  that part of it in which, amid the contradictory sentiments of authors,  I have often suspended my pen, mindful of the maxim, _Historia nihil  falsi audeat dicere, nihil veri non audeat_. Resuming the subject of  Florence, after the death of her great artist in 1336, I find painters  had there prodigiously multiplied, as I shall presently, from undoubted  testimony, proceed to prove. Not long afterwards, that is, in 1349, the  painters associated themselves into a religious fraternity, which they  denominated the Society of St. Luke, first established in S. Maria  Nuova, but afterwards in S. Maria Novella. This was not the first that  had arisen in Italy, as Baldinucci affirms: in 1290 there was a company  of painters previously established at Venice, of which St. Luke was the  patron, the laws of which, it is believed, are still preserved in the  church of St. Sophia.[56] But neither this, the Florentine, nor that of  Bologna, can be called academies for design; they were only the results  of Christian devotion, a sort of school, such as formerly existed, and  still exist in many of the arts. They did not consist of painters alone;  these always possessed the most elevated rank; but in the same place  were assembled artists \"in metal and in wood, whose works partook, more  or less, of design;\" as is related by Baldinucci, in describing the  Florentine association. In that of Venice were comprehended  basket-makers, gilders, and the lowest daubers; in that of Bologna were  included even saddlers, and scabbard-makers; who were only divided from  the painters by means of lawsuits and decisions. That unrefined age did  not as yet acknowledge the dignity of painting; it denominated those  artists master workmen, whom we now call professors of the art, and it  called shops what we name studies. I have often doubted, whether the  progress of the arts was so rapid among us as in Greece, because, there,  painting, either from the beginning or a very early era, was considered  as a liberal art: with us its dignity was much longer in being  acknowledged.

With old, experienced and suspicious wolves,  however, it is better not to make the drag mark, but to set the trap  with great care, close to the side of the trail and put the scent  just beyond it. If possible, place the trap between two tufts of  grass or weeds, so that it can be readily approached from one side  only.\"      [Illustration: Caught in a Scent Set.]    Traps may also be set with bait and some scent used to advantage, in  fact many of the decoys are to be used in that way. Two brothers who  trap in partnership give the following method of trapping with scent  and bait:    \"This is one way of catching coyotes: We find all the horse meat we  can, we even ask people if they know of any dead horses, or sheep or  cattle. But the horse flesh is the best bait for them, then comes the  sheep, that they like almost as well. Rabbits are also excellent bait  for them, by putting a little pucky for scent along the side of the  rabbit bait. We also tell how to make this 'pucky.'    \"Secure all the small fish you can from three to four inches long.  Trout is the best if you can secure them, but other varieties of fish  will do; clean but leave the heads on, because you will find more oil  in the head than in any other part. Cut them up so they will go into  a bottle; stuff them in very tight, up to the neck of the bottle;  then put a thin cheese cloth over the top of the bottle and let it  stay there for about two weeks. It will begin to work good about that  time, then cork it up tight, and in a few days it is ready for use.    \"Now, taking the horse meat, sheep or rabbits, you have for bait,  find a good place to lay the bait so the coyotes cannot get to it  from all sides. Never make your trap stationary but wire the chain to  a small log, a stick of wood about four feet long and three inches  thick, leave a few knots sticking out on the log, and they will help  tire the coyote out, by digging in the ground; wire the chain about  in the middle, as it will drag harder for the coyote.      [Illustration: Traps Set with Bait and Scent.]    \"Now dig a hole the same shape of your trap, where you want it to  set, also bury the clog. Put your trap in its place and have it so it  will be about one-fourth of an inch below the surface of the ground,  not any lower. Put a piece of wool under the pan so birds and rabbits  won't spring it; then take a piece of paper big enough to cover the  jaws of the trap, take some dirt and put over the paper until level  with the surrounding place, if anything a little sunken, just so you  can notice it. Now set your trap about the length of the coyote from  the bait and one more a little farther out, both in the same way as I  said. Be sure and put your bait in such a place as to make them come  around in front.    \"If you have to set traps at a dead horse out in the open, put one  just behind the hips, and one in between his feet where he lays. Set  them as I have told you and you will get them. If you find a dead  animal, that is, bait, I mean, also set your traps in triangle around  him. Put your traps about one foot and a half from bait. Study them  carefully and you will soon learn to set right. Try it.    \"Some trappers say, don't let the traps touch your clothes, smoke and  bury your gloves; and even say bury your shoes after each trip. We  think all of this unnecessary for we tie our traps around us, wear  warm German socks and overshoes, just as everybody else should do in  winter. Set our traps with our gloves on or off, don't matter; when  through, brush over with a small brush and leave it. Don't make any  more tracks around your traps than possible. We made one freak of a  catch, two coyotes at one setting in one night. One had a stub foot  having been caught before.\"    A very good method is to find a large clump of cactus (prickly pear)  with even, well defined edges, and set several traps near the edge  and at varying distances. Use all possible care in setting, following  the instructions given elsewhere. It is best to leave the setting  some three or four days before placing the scent; that will give  plenty of time for the human and other scents, that have been left  there, to pass away and the ground which has been disturbed, will  have taken on a smoother appearance by that time. Then go on  horseback and saturating a lump of earth with the decoy, drop it in  the center of the cactus bed. Do not dismount from the horse when  placing the decoy. This is an exceptionally good set for coyotes.  While they can not reach the scent, they will walk all around the  cactus bed and are almost certain to step in one of the traps.    Another successful mode of setting is to place the trap in a trail  where it leads through a clump of sage or greasewood and put some  decoy by the side of the trail a rod or two away. The bank set which  is described in another chapter may also be used without bait by  placing some scent on the edge of the bank.    One of the Montana trappers uses this method: \"Take your traps and  boil them in lye water. Do not handle them with your bare hands but  be sure and use clean buckskin gloves, and handle them as little as  possible. Find a place where they run pretty regular, like an old  road that is not used or a cow path or trail. Find a place that is  sandy if you can, and set your traps lengthwise with the trail. Of  course, you must dig out where you put your traps.    \"Now cover your traps with a piece of deodorized paper and about  one-half inch of sand. Get some water and sprinkle along the trail  and over your traps to make it all look alike. You must not leave a  lot of loose and lumpy dirt lying near your traps. Leave as little  sign as possible. Wait two days before you go there again, and then  go with a saddle horse and drop six or eight drops of good scent bait  between your traps, and await results. Do not get off your horse when  you go to put out the scent bait, for I know of no animal that is any  more sly than the old grey wolf.    \"Now I don't claim that this will work in all localities, but I have  had fairly good luck with this set. I always use two traps at a  setting for wolf or coyote.\"        CHAPTER XII.    BAIT METHODS FOR WOLVES.    Many of the sets used for coyotes are equally good for grey wolves,  providing that one uses a trap sufficiently strong to hold them and  almost any set that will catch the wolf is good also for the coyote,  but there are some which are especially good for the grey wolf and we  give here some of these methods.    One of the most successful is the following: Somewhere on the wolf's  route of travel find an unused trail and selecting a well defined  portion, set two traps close together as shown in the diagram. Have  the jaws of the traps parallel with the trail so that there will be  no possibility of the wolf's foot being thrown out by the rising  jaws, and so arrange them that the pans will be about twelve or  fourteen inches apart. The traps must be attached to drags of some  sort, stones or iron drags, which must be buried, along with the  traps. Great care should be used in setting so as to leave everything  as nearly like it was before as possible. No loose dirt should be  left lying about, and no tracks or signs of human presence should  remain about the setting.    Two more traps should be set in a similar manner, somewhere on the  trail, and from fifty to one hundred yards from the first two. The  traps should be left setting some four or five days before placing  the bait. This will allow all foreign odors to pass away from the  setting. A large bait should then be placed midway between the two  settings, and close beside the trail.      [Illustration: Trail Bait Set.]    On approaching or leaving the bait the wolves are almost certain to  walk on the trail, and while they view all signs of disturbance near  the bait with suspicion, they will be less cautious some distance  away. In other words they will not be expecting danger so far away  from the bait.    When looking at the traps, one should go on horseback and avoid  dismounting near the traps or bait. In placing the bait one should,  if possible, go on a wagon, or if more convenient, on a horse, and  should drop the bait in place without stepping down on to the ground.    If desired a single trap may be used at each setting but as the  length of step of the timber wolf is from eighteen to twenty-four  inches, it is better to use two traps, for the wolf is likely to miss  a single trap. The method will be found to work well in all  localities and is as good for coyotes as for wolves.    Another very popular mode of trapping the grey wolf is with what is  known as the square setting. This set requires four traps and they  are arranged in the form of a square.    On a smooth sandy spot of ground, dig a hole about six inches deep  and having attached the chains of all four traps to the stake, drive  it in the hole until the top is below the surface of the ground. The  traps should have the regular short chains and they should be  arranged in the form of a square each about twenty inches from the  stake. The traps must be bedded down, or in other words, they should  be set in holes dug for the purpose as previously described and  should be neatly covered. A narrow trench should be made for each  chain and they must be covered also, so as to leave no sign. The bait  should be fastened with wire to the top of the trap stake and the  hollow beneath it may be filled with sand. The wire must not be  visible and if a bird, rabbit or any small creature is used for bait,  it must not be skinned or mutilated. When baiting with a piece of  beef mutton, horse-flesh or the flesh of any large animal, it is best  also to leave the skin on, as a"]]]
