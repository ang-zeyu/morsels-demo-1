On the 23rd of September, he ordered  the Inquisitor of Florence to notify Galileo (in the presence of  concealed notary and witnesses in case he were \"recusant\") to come to  Rome and appear before the Sacred Congregation before the end of the  next month;[265] the publication and sale of the _Dialogo_ meanwhile  being stopped at great financial loss to the printer.[266] Galileo  promised to obey; but he was nearly seventy years old and so much  broken in health that a long difficult journey in the approaching  winter seemed a great and unnecessary hardship, especially as he was  loath to believe that the Church authorities were really hostile to  him. Delays were granted him till the Pope in December finally ordered  him to be in Rome within a month.[267] The Florentine Inquisitor  replied that Galileo was in bed so sick that three doctors had  certified that he could not travel except at serious risk to his life.  This certificate declared that he suffered from an intermittent pulse,  from enfeebled vital faculties, from frequent dizziness, from  melancholia, weakness of the stomach, insomnia, shooting pains and  serious hernia.[268] The answer the Pope made to this was to order the  Inquisitor to send at Galileo's expense a commissary and a doctor out  to his villa to see if he were feigning illness; if he were, he was to  be sent bound and in chains to Rome at once; if [Transcriber's Note:  'he' missing] were really too ill to travel, then he was to be sent in  chains as soon as he was convalescent and could travel safely.[269]  Galileo did not delay after that any longer than he could help, and  set out for Rome in January in a litter supplied by the Tuscan Grand  Duke.[270] The journey was prolonged by quarantine, but upon his  arrival (February 13, 1633), he was welcomed into the palace of  Niccolini, the warm-hearted ambassador of the Grand Duke.    [Footnote 265: Ibid: 17-18.]    [Footnote 266: Galileo: _Opere_, XV, 26.]    [Footnote 267: Doc. in Favaro: 74.]    [Footnote 268: Ibid: 75.]    [Footnote 269: Ibid: 76.]    [Footnote 270: Ibid: 80-81.]    Four times was the old man summoned into the presence of the Holy  Office, though never when the Pope was presiding. In his first  examination held on the 12th of April, he told how he thought he had  obeyed the decree of 1616 as his _Dialogo_ did not defend the  Copernican doctrine but rather confuted it, and that in his desire to  do the right, he had personally submitted the book while in manuscript  to the censorship of the Master of the Sacred Palace, and had accepted  all the changes he and the Florentine Inquisitor had required. He had  not mentioned the affair of 1616 because he thought that order did not  apply to this book in which he proved the lack of validity and of  conclusiveness of the Copernican arguments.[271] With remarkable, in  fact unique, consideration, the Holy Office then assigned Galileo to a  suite of rooms within the prisons of the Holy Office, allowed him to  have his servant with him and to have his meals sent in by the  ambassador. On the 30th after his examination, they even assigned as  his prison, the Ambassador's palace, out of consideration for his age  and ill-health.    [Footnote 271: Ibid: 80-81.]    In his second appearance (April 30), Galileo declared he had been  thinking matters over after re-reading his book (which he had not read  for three years), and freely confessed that there were several  passages which would mislead a reader unaware of his real intentions,  into believing the worse arguments were the better, and he blamed  these slips upon his vain ambition and delight in his own skill in  debate.[272] He thereupon offered to write another \"day\" or two more  for the _Dialogo_ in which he would completely refute the two \"strong\"  Copernican arguments based on the sun's spots and on the tides.[273]  Ten days later, at his third appearance, he presented a written  statement of his defence in which he claimed that the phrase _vel  quovis modo docere_ was wholly new to him, and that he had obeyed the  order given him by Cardinal Bellarmin over the latter's own signature.  However he would make what amends he could and begged the Cardinals to  \"consider his miserable bodily health and his incessant mental trouble  for the past ten months, the discomforts of a long hard journey at the  worst season, when 70 years old, together with the loss of the greater  part of the year, and that therefore such suffering might be adequate  punishment for his faults which they might condone to failing old age.  Also he commended to them his honor and reputation against the  calumnies of his ill-wishers who seek to detract from his good  name.\"[274] To such a plight was the great man brought! But the end  was not yet.    [Footnote 272: Doc. in Favaro: 83.]    [Footnote 273: Ibid: 84.]    [Footnote 274: Ibid: 85-87.]    Nearly a month later (June 16), by order of the Pope, Galileo was once  again interrogated, this time under threat of torture.[275] Once again  he declared the opinion of Ptolemy true and indubitable and said he  did not hold and had not held this doctrine of Copernicus after he had  been informed of the order to abandon it. \"As for the rest,\" he added,  \"I am in your hands, do with me as you please.\" \"I am here to  obey.\"[276] Then by the order of the Pope, ensued Galileo's complete  abjuration on his knees in the presence of the full Congregation,  coupled with his promise to denounce other heretics (i.e.,  Copernicans).[277] In addition, because he was guilty of the heresy of  having held and believed a doctrine declared and defined as contrary  to the Scriptures, he was sentenced to \"formal imprisonment\" at the  will of the Congregation, and to repeat the seven penitential Psalms  every week for three years.[278]    [Footnote 275: Ibid: 101.]    [Footnote 276: Doc. in Favaro: 101.]    [Footnote 277: Doc. in Favaro: 146.]    [Footnote 278: Ibid: 145.]    At Galileo's earnest request, his sentence was commuted almost at  once, to imprisonment first in the archiepiscopal palace in Siena  (from June 30-December 1), then in his own villa at Arcetri, outside  Florence, though under strict orders not to receive visitors but to  live in solitude.[279] In the spring his increasing illness occasioned  another request for greater liberty in order to have the necessary  visits from the doctor; but on March 23, 1634, this was denied him  with a stern command from the Pope to refrain from further petitions  lest the Sacred Congregation be compelled to recall him to their  prisons in Rome.[280]    [Footnote 279: Ibid: 103, 129.]    [Footnote 280: Ibid: 134.]    The rule forbidding visitors seems not to have been rigidly enforced  all the time, for Milton visited him, \"a prisoner of the Inquisition\"  in 1638;[281] yet Father Castelli had to write to Rome for permission  to visit him to learn his newly invented method of finding longitude  at sea.[282] When in Florence on a very brief stay to see his doctor,  Galileo had to have the especial consent of the Inquisitor in order to  attend mass at Easter. He won approval from the Holy Congregation,  however, by refusing to receive some gifts and letters brought him by  some German merchants from the Low Countries.[283] He was then totally  blind, but he dragged out his existence until January 8, 1642 (the  year of Newton's birth), when he died. As the Pope objected to a  public funeral for a man sentenced by the Holy Office, he was buried  without even an epitaph.[284] The first inscription was made 31 years  later, and in 1737, his remains were removed to Santa Croce after the  Congregation had first been asked if such action would be  unobjectionable.[285]    [Footnote 281: Milton: _Areopagitica_: 35.]    [Footnote 282: Doc. in Favaro: 135.]    [Footnote 283: Ibid: 137.]    [Footnote 284: Fahie: 402.]    [Footnote 285: Doc. in Favaro: 138; and Fahie: 402.]    Pope Urban had no intention of concealing Galileo's abjuration and  sentence. Instead, he ordered copies of both to be sent to all  inquisitors and papal nuncios that they might notify all their clergy  and especially all the professors of mathematics and philosophy within  their districts, particularly those at Florence, Padua and Pisa.[286]  This was done during the summer and fall of 1633. From Wilna in  Poland, Cologne, Paris, Brussels, and Madrid, as well as from all  Italy, came the replies of the papal officials stating that the order  had been obeyed.[287] He evidently intended to leave no ground for a  remark like that of Fromundus about the earlier condemnation.    [Footnote 286: Doc. in Favaro: 101, 103.]    [Footnote 287: Ibid: 104-132.]    Galileo was thus brought so low that the famous remark, \"Eppur si  muove,\" legend reports him to have made as he rose to his feet after  his abjuration, is incredible in itself, even if it had appeared in  history earlier than its first publication in 1761.[288] But his  discoveries and his fight in defence of the system did much both to  strengthen the doctrine itself and to win adherents to it. The  appearance of the moon as seen through a telescope destroyed the  Aristotelian notion of the perfection of heavenly bodies. Jupiter's  satellites gave proof by analogy of the solar system, though on a  smaller scale. The discovery of the phases of Venus refuted a hitherto  strong objection to the Copernican system; and the discovery of the  spots on the sun led to his later discovery of the sun's axial  rotation, another proof by analogy of the axial rotation of the earth.  Yet he swore the Ptolemaic conception was the true one.    [Footnote 288: Fahie: 325, note.]    The abjuration of Galileo makes a pitiful page in the history of  thought and has been a fruitful source of controversy[289] for nearly  three centuries. He was unquestionably a sincere and loyal Catholic,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3580"],[0,"Recollections of the Private Life of Napoleon — Complete (#14)"],[1,"Regent and Carbon, the true criminals, proved that the  conjectures of the minister were more correct than those of the chief of  state.    The 4th Nivose, at noon, the First Consul held a grand review in the  Place Carrousel, where an innumerable crowd of citizens were collected to  behold, and also to testify their affection for his person, and their  indignation against the enemies who dared attack him only by  assassination. Hardly had he turned his horse towards the first line of  grenadiers of the Consular Guard, when their innumerable acclamations  rose on all sides. He rode along the ranks, at a walk, very slowly,  showing his appreciation, and replying by a few simple and affectionate  words to this effusion of popular joy; and cries of \"Vive Bonaparte!  Vive the First Consul!\" did not cease till after he had re-entered his  apartments.    The conspirators who obstinately persisted, with so much animosity, in  attacking the life of the First Consul, could not have chosen a period in  which circumstances would have been more adverse to their plans than in  1800 and 1801, for then the Consul was beloved not only for his military  deeds, but still more for the hope of peace that he gave to France, which  hope was soon realized. As soon as the first rumor spread abroad that  peace had been concluded with Austria, the greater part of the  inhabitants of Paris gathered under the windows of the Pavilion of Flora.  Blessings and cries of gratitude and joy were heard on all sides; then  musicians assembled to give a serenade to the chief of state, and  proceeded to form themselves into orchestras; and there was dancing the  whole night through. I have never seen a sight more striking or more  joyous than the bird's-eye view of this improvised jubilee.    When in the month of October, the, peace of Amiens having been concluded  with England, France found herself delivered from all the wars that she  had maintained through so many years, and at the cost of so many  sacrifices, it would be impossible to form an idea of the joy which burst  forth on all sides. The decrees which ordered either the disarmament of  vessels of war, or the placing of the forts on a peace footing, were  welcomed as pledges of happiness and security. The day of the reception  of Lord Cornwallis, Ambassador of England, the First Consul ordered that  the greatest magnificence should be displayed. \"It is necessary,\" he had  said the evening before, \"to show these proud Britons that we are not  reduced to beggary.\" The fact is, the English, before setting foot on  the French continent, had expected to find only ruins, penury, and  misery. The whole of France had been described to them as being in the  most distressing condition, and they thought themselves on the point of  landing in a barbarous country. Their surprise was great when they saw  how many evils the First Consul had already repaired in so short a time,  and all the improvements that he still intended to carry out; and they  spread through their own country the report of what they themselves  called the prodigies of the First Consul, by which thousands of their  compatriots were influenced to come and judge with their own eyes. At  the moment that Lord Cornwallis entered the great hall of the Ambassadors  with his suite, the eyes of all the English must have been dazzled by the  sight of the First Consul, surrounded by his two colleagues, with all the  diplomatic corps, and with an already brilliant military court.    In the midst of all these rich uniforms, his was remarkable for its  simplicity; but the diamond called the Regent, which had been put in pawn  under the Directory, and redeemed a few days since by the First Consul,  sparkled on the hilt of his sword.          CHAPTER VII.    In the month of May, 1801, there came to Paris, on his way to take  possession of his new kingdom, the Prince of Tuscany, Don Louis the  First, whom the First Consul had just made King of Etruria. He traveled  under the name of the Count of Leghorn, with his wife, who was the  infanta of Spain, Maria Louisa, third daughter of Charles the Fourth; but  in spite of the incognito, which, from the modest title he had assumed,  he seemed really anxious to preserve, especially, perhaps, on account of  the poor appearance of his small court, he was, notwithstanding, received  and treated at the Tuileries as a king. This prince was in feeble  health, and it was said had epilepsy. They were lodged at the residence  of the Spanish Embassy, formerly the Hotel Montessori; and he requested  Madame de Montessori, who lived in the next house, to reopen a private  communication between the houses which had long been closed. He, as well  as the Queen of Etruria, greatly enjoyed the society of this lady, who  was the widow of the Duke of Orleans, and spent many hours every day in  her house. A Bourbon himself, he doubtless loved to hear every  particular relating to the Bourbons of France, which could so well be  given by one who had lived at their court, and on intimate terms with the  royal family, with which she was connected by ties which, though not  official, were none the less well known and recognized.    Madame de Montesson received at her house all who were most distinguished  in Parisian society. She had reunited the remnants of the most select  society of former times, which the Revolution had dispersed. A friend of  Madame Bonaparte, she was also loved and respected by the First Consul,  who was desirous that they should speak and think well of him in the most  noble and elegant saloon of the capital. Besides, he relied upon the  experience and exquisite refinement of this lady, to establish in the  palace and its society, out of which he already dreamed of making a  court, the usages and etiquette customary with sovereigns.    The King of Etruria was not fond of work, and in this respect did not  please the First Consul, who could not endure idleness. I heard him one  day, in conversation with his colleague, Cambaceres, score severely his  royal protege (in his absence, of course). \"Here is a prince,\" said he,  \"who does not concern himself much with his very dear and well-beloved  subjects, but passes his time cackling with old women, to whom he dilates  in a loud tone on my good qualities, while he complains in a whisper of  owing his elevation to the chief of this cursed French Republic. His  only business is walking, hunting, balls, and theaters.\"--\"It is  asserted,\" remarked Cambaceres, \"that you wished to disgust the French  people with kings, by showing them such a specimen, as the Spartans  disgusted their children with drunkenness by exhibiting to them a drunken  slave.\"    \"Not so, not so, my dear sir,\" replied the First Consul. \"I have no desire  to disgust them with royalty; but the sojourn of the King of Etruria will  annoy a number of good people who are working incessantly to create a  feeling favorable to the Bourbons.\" Don Louis, perhaps, did not merit  such severity, although he was, it must be admitted, endowed with little  mind, and few agreeable traits of character. When he dined at the  Tuileries, he was much embarrassed in replying to the simplest questions  the First Consul addressed him. Beyond the rain and the weather, horses,  dogs, and other like subjects of conversation, he could not give an  intelligent reply on any subject. The Queen, his wife, often made signs  to put him on right road, and even whispered to him, what he should say  or do; but this rendered only the more conspicuous his absolute want of  presence of mind. People made themselves merry at his expense; but they  took good care, however, not to do this in the presence of the First  Consul, who would not have suffered any want of respect to a guest to  whom he had shown so much. What gave rise to the greatest number of  pleasantries, in regard to the prince, was his excessive economy, which  reached a point truly incredible. Innumerable instances were quoted,  which this is perhaps the most striking. The First Consul sent him  frequently during his stay, magnificent presents, such as Savonnerie  carpets, Lyons cloths, and Sevres porcelain; and on such occasions his  Majesty would give some small gratuity to the bearers of these precious  articles. One day a vase of very great value (it cost, I believe, a  hundred thousand crowns) was brought him which it required a dozen  workmen to place in the apartments of the king. Their work being  finished, the workmen waited until his Majesty should give them some  token of his satisfaction, and flattered themselves he would display a  truly royal liberality. As, notwithstanding, time passed, and the  expected gratuity did not arrive, they finally applied to one of his  chamberlains, and asked him to lay their petition at the feet of the King  of Etruria. His Majesty, who was still in ecstasy over the beauty of the  present, and the munificence of the First Consul, was astounded at such a  request. \"It was a present,\" said he; \"and hence it was for him to  receive, not to give;\" and it was only after much persistence that the  chamberlain obtained six francs for each of these workmen, which were  refused by these good people. The persons of the prince's suite asserted  that to this extreme aversion to expense he added an excessive severity  towards themselves; however, the first of these traits probably disposed  the servants of the King of Etruria to exaggerate the second.    Masters who are too economical never fail to be deemed severe themselves,  and at the same time are severely criticised by their servants. For this  reason, perhaps (I would say in passing), there is current among some  people a calumny which represents the Emperor as often taking a fancy to  beat his servants. The economy of the Emperor Napoleon was only a desire  for the most perfect order in the expenses of his household. One thing I  can positively assert in regard to his Majesty,"]]]
