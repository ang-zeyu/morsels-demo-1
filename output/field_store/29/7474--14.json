These truly are in need that we pray twice for them, if we  pray once for those whom they condemn, talk about and laugh at. That  there would be such is also prophesied by the thief on Christ's left  hand, who blasphemed Him in His suffering, weakness and need; also by  all those who reviled Christ on the Cross, when they should most of all  have helped Him.    O God, how blind, nay, how insane have we Christians become! When will  there be an end of wrath, O heavenly Father? That we mock at the  misfortune of Christendom, to pray for which we gather together in  Church and at the mass, that we blaspheme and condemn men, this is the  fruit of our mad materialism. If the Turk destroys cities, country and  people, and ruins churches, we think a great injury has been done  Christendom. Then we complain, and urge kings and princes to war. But  when faith perishes, love grows cold, God's Word is neglected, and all  manner of sin flourishes, then no one thinks of fighting, nay, pope,  bishops, priests and clergy, who ought to be generals, captains and  standard-bearers in this spiritual warfare against these spiritual and  many times worse Turks, these are themselves the very princes and  leaders of such Turks and of the devil host, just as Judas was the  leader of the Jews when they took Christ.  It had to be an apostle, a  bishop, a priest, one of the number of the best, who began the work of  slaying Christ. So also must Christendom be laid waste by no others  than those who ought to protect it, and yet are so insane that they are  ready to eat up the Turks and at home themselves set house and  sheep-cote on fire and let them burn up with the sheep and all other  contents, and none the less worry about the wolf in the woods. Such are  our times, and this is the reward we have earned by our ingratitude  toward the endless grace which Christ has won for us freely with His  precious blood, grievous labor and bitter death.    XVI. Lo! where are the idle ones, who do not know how to do good works?  Where are they who run to Rome, to St. James, hither and thither? Take  up this one single work of the mass, look on your neighbor's sin and  ruin, and have pity on him; let it grieve you, tell it to God, and pray  over it. Do the same for every other need of Christendom, especially of  the rulers, whom God, for the intolerable punishment and torment of us  all, allows to fall and be misled so terribly. If you do this  diligently, be assured you are one of the best fighters and captains,  not only against the Turks, but also against the devils and the powers  of hell. But if you do it not, what would it help you though you  performed all the miracles of the saints, and murdered all the Turks,  and yet were found guilty of having disregarded your neighbor's need  and of having thereby sinned against love? For Christ at the last day  will not ask how much you have prayed, fasted, pilgrimaged, done this  or that for yourself, but how much good you have done to others, even  the very least.    Now without doubt among the \"least\" are also those who are in sin and  spiritual poverty, captivity and need, of whom there are at present far  more than of those who suffer bodily need. Therefore take heed: our own  self-assumed good works lead us to and into ourselves, that we seek  only our own benefit and salvation; but God's commandments drive us to  our neighbor, that we may thereby benefit others to their salvation.  Just as Christ on the Cross prayed not for Himself alone, but rather  for us, when He said, \"Father, forgive them, fort they know not what  they do,\" so we also must pray for one another. From which every man  may know that the slanderers, frivolous judges and despisers of other  people are a perverted, evil race, who do nothing else than heap abuse  on those for whom they ought to pray; in which vice no one is sunk so  deep as those very men who do many good works of their own, and seem to  men to be something extraordinary, and are honored because of their  beautiful, splendid life in manifold good works.    XVII. Spiritually understood, this Commandment has a yet far higher  work, which embraces the whole nature of man. Here it must be known  that in Hebrew \"Sabbath\" means \"rest,\" because on the seventh day God  rested and ceased from all His works, which He had made. Genesis ii.  Therefore He commanded also that the seventh day should be kept holy  and that we cease from our works which we do the other six days. This  Sabbath has now for us been changed into the Sunday, and the other days  are called work-days; the Sunday is called rest-day or holiday or holy  day. And would to God that in Christendom there were no holiday except  the Sunday; that the festivals of Our Lady and of the Saints were all  transferred to Sunday; then would many evil vices be done away with  through the labor of the work-days, and lands would not be so drained  and impoverished. But now we are plagued with many holidays, to the  destruction of souls, bodies and goods; of which matter much might be  said.    This rest or ceasing from labors is of two kinds, bodily and spiritual.  For this reason this Commandment is also to be understood in two ways.    The bodily rest is that of which we have spoken above, namely, that we  omit our business and work, in order that we may gather in the church,  see mass, hear God's Word and make common prayer.  This rest is indeed  bodily and in Christendom no longer commanded by God, as the Apostle  says, Colossians ii, \"Let no man obligate you to any holiday  whatever\"--for they were of old a figure, but now the truth has been  fulfilled, so that all days are holy days, as Isaiah says, chapter  lxvi, \"One holy day shall follow the other\"; on the other hand, all  days are workdays. Yet it is a necessity and ordained by the Church for  the sake of the imperfect laity and working people, that they also may  be able to come to hear God's Word. For, as we see, the priests and  clergy celebrate mass every day, pray at all hours and train themselves  in God's Word by study, reading and hearing. For this reason also they  are freed from work before others, supported by tithes and have  holy-day every day, and every day do the works of the holy-day, and  have no work-day, but for them one day is as the other. And if we were  all perfect, and knew the Gospel, we might work every day if we wished,  or rest if we could. For a day of rest is at present not necessary nor  commanded except only for the teaching of God's Word and prayer.    The spiritual rest, which God particularly intends in this Commandment,  is this: that we not only cease from our labor and trade, but much  more, that we let God alone work in us and that we do nothing of our  own with all our powers. But how is this done? In this way: Man,  corrupted by sin, has much wicked love and inclination toward all sins,  as the Scriptures say, Genesis viii, \"Man's heart and senses incline  always to the evil,\" that is, to pride, disobedience, anger, hatred,  covetousness, unchastity, etc., and summa summarum, in all that he does  and leaves undone, he seeks his own profit, will and honor rather than  God's and his neighbor's. Therefore all his works, all his words, all  his thoughts, all his life are evil and not godly.    Now if God is to work and to live in him, all this vice and wickedness  must be choked and up-rooted, so that there may be rest and a cessation  of all our works, thoughts and life, and that henceforth (as St. Paul  says, Galatians ii.) it may be no longer we who live, but Christ Who  lives, works and speaks in us.  This is not accomplished with  comfortable, pleasant days, but here we must hurt our nature and let it  be hurt. Here begins the strife between the spirit and the flesh; here  the spirit resists anger, lust, pride, while the flesh wants to be in  pleasure, honor and comfort. Of this St. Paul says, Galatians v, \"They  that are our Lord Christ's have crucified the flesh with its affections  and lusts.\" Then follow the good works,--fasting, watching, labor, of  which some say and write so much, although they know neither the source  nor the purpose of these good works.  Therefore we will now also speak  of them.    XVIII. This rest, namely, that our work cease and God alone work in us,  is accomplished in two ways. First, through our own effort, secondly,  through the effort or urging of others.    Our own effort is to be so made and ordered that, in the first place,  when we see our flesh, senses, will and thoughts tempting us, we resist  them and do not heed them, as the Wise Man says: \"Follow not thine own  desires.\" And Moses, Deuteronomy xii: \"Thou shalt not do what is right  in thine own eyes.\"    Here a man must make daily use of those prayers which David prays:  \"Lord, lead me in Thy path, and let me not walk in my own ways,\" and  many like prayers, which are all summed up in the prayer, \"Thy kingdom  come.\" For the desires are so many, so various, and besides at times so  nimble, so subtile and specious, through the suggestions of the evil  one, that it is not possible for a man to control himself in his own  ways. He must let hands and feet go, commend himself to God's  governance, and entrust nothing to his reason, as Jeremiah says, \"O  Lord, I know that the way of man is not in his own power.\" We see proof  of this, when the children of Israel went out of Egypt through the  Wilderness, where there was no way, no food, no drink, no help.  Therefore God went before them, by day in a bright: cloud, by night in  a fiery pillar, fed them with manna from heaven, and kept their  garments and shoes that they waxed not old, as we read in the Books of  Moses. For this reason we pray: \"Thy kingdom come, that Thou rule"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/419"],[0,"The Magic of Oz (#14)"],[1,".    The monkey was instantly transformed into the Giant, and the Giant was  so big that as he stood on the ground his head was higher than the  trees of the forest.  The monkeys raised a great chatter but did not  seem to understand that the Giant was one of themselves.    \"Good!\" cried the Nome.  \"Hurry, Kiki, and transform the others.\"    So Kiki rushed back to the tree and putting his face to the hollow,  whispered:    \"I want the next monkey to be just like the first--Pyrzqxgl!\"    Again the Wizard Fox heard the Magic Word, and just how it was  pronounced.  But he sat still in the hollow and waited to hear it  again, so it would be impressed on his mind and he would not forget it.    Kiki kept running to the edge of the forest and back to the hollow tree  again until he had whispered the Magic Word six times and six monkeys  had been changed to six great Giants.  Then the Wizard decided he would  make an experiment and use the Magic Word himself.  So, while Kiki was  running back to the Nome, the Fox stuck his head out of the hollow and  said softly: \"I want that creature who is running to become a  hickory-nut--Pyrzqxgl!\"    Instantly the Li-Mon-Eag form of Kiki Aru the Hyup disappeared and a  small hickory-nut rolled upon the ground a moment and then lay still.    The Wizard was delighted, and leaped from the hollow just as Ruggedo  looked around to see what had become of Kiki.  The Nome saw the Fox but  no Kiki, so he hastily rose to his feet.  The Wizard did not know how  powerful the queer beast might be, so he resolved to take no chances.    \"I want this creature to become a walnut--Pyrzqxgl!\" he said aloud.  But he did not pronounce the Magic Word in quite the right way, and  Ruggedo's form did not change.  But the Nome knew at once that  \"Pyrzqxgl!\" was the Magic Word, so he rushed at the Fox and cried:    \"I want you to become a Goose--Pyrzqxgl!\"    But the Nome did not pronounce the word aright, either, having never  heard it spoken but once before, and then with a wrong accent.  So the  Fox was not transformed, but it had to run away to escape being caught  by the angry Nome.    Ruggedo now began pronouncing the Magic Word in every way he could  think of, hoping to hit the right one, and the Fox, hiding in a bush,  was somewhat troubled by the fear that he might succeed.  However, the  Wizard, who was used to magic arts, remained calm and soon remembered  exactly how Kiki Aru had pronounced the word.  So he repeated the  sentence he had before uttered and Ruggedo the Nome became an ordinary  walnut.    The Wizard now crept out from the bush and said: \"I want my own form  again--Pyrzqxgl!\"    Instantly he was the Wizard of Oz, and after picking up the hickory-nut  and the walnut, and carefully placing them in his pocket, he ran back  to the big clearing.    Dorothy the Lamb uttered a bleat of delight when she saw her old friend  restored to his natural shape.  The others were all there, not having  found the Goose.  The fat Gillikin woman, the Munchkin boy, the Rabbit  and the Glass Cat crowded around the Wizard and asked what had happened.    Before he explained anything of his adventure, he transformed them  all--except, of course, the Glass Cat--into their natural shapes, and  when their joy permitted them to quiet somewhat, he told how he had by  chance surprised the Magician's secret and been able to change the two  Li-Mon-Eags into shapes that could not speak, and therefore would be  unable to help themselves.  And the little Wizard showed his astonished  friends the hickory-nut and the walnut to prove that he had spoken the  truth.    \"But--see here!\"--exclaimed Dorothy.  \"What has become of those Giant  Soldiers who used to be monkeys?\"    \"I forgot all about them!\" admitted the Wizard; \"but I suppose they are  still standing there in the forest.\"          15.  The Lonesome Duck      Trot and Cap'n Bill stood before the Magic Flower, actually rooted to  the spot.    \"Aren't you hungry, Cap'n?\" asked the little girl, with a long sigh,  for she had been standing there for hours and hours.    \"Well,\" replied the sailor-man, \"I ain't sayin' as I couldn't EAT,  Trot--if a dinner was handy--but I guess old folks don't get as hungry  as young folks do.\"    \"I'm not sure 'bout that, Cap'n Bill,\" she said thoughtfully.  \"Age  MIGHT make a diff'rence, but seems to me SIZE would make a bigger  diff'rence.  Seeing you're twice as big as me, you ought to be twice as  hungry.\"    \"I hope I am,\" he rejoined, \"for I can stand it a while longer.  I do  hope the Glass Cat will hurry, and I hope the Wizard won't waste time  a-comin' to us.\"    Trot sighed again and watched the wonderful Magic Flower, because there  was nothing else to do.  Just now a lovely group of pink peonies budded  and bloomed, but soon they faded away, and a mass of deep blue lilies  took their place.  Then some yellow chrysanthemums blossomed on the  plant, and when they had opened all their petals and reached  perfection, they gave way to a lot of white floral balls spotted with  crimson--a flower Trot had never seen before.    \"But I get awful tired watchin' flowers an' flowers an' flowers,\" she  said impatiently.    \"They're might pretty,\" observed Cap'n Bill.    \"I know; and if a person could come and look at the Magic Flower just  when she felt like it, it would be a fine thing, but to HAVE TO stand  and watch it, whether you want to or not, isn't so much fun.  I wish,  Cap'n Bill, the thing would grow fruit for a while instead of flowers.\"    Scarcely had she spoken when the white balls with crimson spots faded  away and a lot of beautiful ripe peaches took their place.  With a cry  of mingled surprise and delight Trot reached out and plucked a peach  from the bush and began to eat it, finding it delicious.  Cap'n Bill  was somewhat dazed at the girl's wish being granted so quickly, so  before he could pick a peach they had faded away and bananas took their  place.  \"Grab one, Cap'n!\" exclaimed Trot, and even while eating the  peach she seized a banana with her other hand and tore it from the bush.    The old sailor was still bewildered.  He put out a hand indeed, but he  was too late, for now the bananas disappeared and lemons took their  place.    \"Pshaw!\" cried Trot.  \"You can't eat those things; but watch out,  Cap'n, for something else.\"    Cocoanuts next appeared, but Cap'n Bill shook his head.    \"Ca'n't crack 'em,\" he remarked, \"'cause we haven't anything handy to  smash 'em with.\"    \"Well, take one, anyhow,\" advised Trot; but the cocoanuts were gone  now, and a deep, purple, pear-shaped fruit which was unknown to them  took their place.  Again Cap'n Bill hesitated, and Trot said to him:    \"You ought to have captured a peach and a banana, as I did.  If you're  not careful, Cap'n, you'll miss all your chances.  Here, I'll divide my  banana with you.\"    Even as she spoke, the Magic Plant was covered with big red apples,  growing on every branch, and Cap'n Bill hesitated no longer.  He  grabbed with both hands and picked two apples, while Trot had only time  to secure one before they were gone.    \"It's curious,\" remarked the sailor, munching his apple, \"how these  fruits keep good when you've picked 'em, but dis'pear inter thin air if  they're left on the bush.\"    \"The whole thing is curious,\" declared the girl, \"and it couldn't exist  in any country but this, where magic is so common.  Those are limes.  Don't pick 'em, for they'd pucker up your mouth and--Ooo! here come  plums!\" and she tucked her apple in her apron pocket and captured three  plums--each one almost as big as an egg--before they disappeared.  Cap'n Bill got some too, but both were too hungry to fast any longer,  so they began eating their apples and plums and let the magic bush bear  all sorts of fruits, one after another.  The Cap'n stopped once to pick  a fine cantaloupe, which he held under his arm, and Trot, having  finished her plums, got a handful of cherries and an orange; but when  almost every sort of fruit had appeared on the bush, the crop ceased  and only flowers, as before, bloomed upon it.    \"I wonder why it changed back,\" mused Trot, who was not worried because  she had enough fruit to satisfy her hunger.    \"Well, you only wished it would bear fruit 'for a while,'\" said the  sailor, \"and it did.  P'raps if you'd said 'forever,' Trot, it would  have always been fruit.\"    \"But why should MY wish be obeyed?\" asked the girl.  \"I'm not a fairy  or a wizard or any kind of a magic-maker.\"    \"I guess,\" replied Cap'n Bill, \"that this little island is a magic  island, and any folks on it can tell the bush what to produce, an'  it'll produce it.\"    \"Do you think I could wish for anything else, Cap'n and get it?\" she  inquired anxiously.    \"What are you thinkin' of, Trot?\"    \"I'm thinking of wishing that these roots on our feet would disappear,  and let us free.\"    \"Try it, Trot.\"    So she tried it, and the wish had no effect whatever.    \"Try it yourself, Cap'n,\" she suggested.    Then Cap'n Bill made the wish to be free, with no better result.    \"No,\" said he, \"it's no use; the wishes only affect the Magic Plant;  but I'm glad we can make it bear fruit, 'cause now we know we won't  starve before the Wizard gets to us.\"    \"But I'm gett'n' tired standing here so long,\" complained the girl.  \"If I could only lift one foot, and rest it, I'd feel better.\"    \"Same with me, Trot.  I've noticed that if you've got to do a thing,  and can't help yourself, it gets to be a hardship mighty quick.\"    \"Folks that can raise their feet don't appreciate what a blessing it  is,\" said Trot thoughtfully.  \"I never knew before what fun it is to  raise one foot, an' then another, any time you feel like it.\"    \"There's lots o' things folks don't 'preciate,\" replied the sailor-man.  \"If somethin' would 'most stop your breath, you'd think breathin' easy  was the finest thing in life.  When a person's well, he don't realize  how jolly it is, but when he"]]]
