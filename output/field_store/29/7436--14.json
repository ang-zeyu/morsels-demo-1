[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38189"],[0,"A Treatise on Sheep: (#14)"],[1," important agricultural era.    John Ellman derives his well-earned fame, from the zealous manner in  which he improved the Southdown sheep, and spread them through the  empire. Till he directed his attention to the subject, every thing  connected with the management of the flock was left to chance, or at  least to the guidance of farm-servants, with whom, of course, it could  not be a matter of interest to select, or _sort_, suitable animals for  the continuance of the race. He speedily, however, corrected this  mismanagement, and aided by the introduction of turnip-feeding, in no  long time, and without any admixture of foreign blood, materially  improved the breed.    About seventy years ago, improvements also commenced in Scotland. Till  then, in many parishes, no farmer could keep sheep through the winter,  and no place was reckoned so fatal to these animals as the undrained,  and unsheltered parish of Eskdale-Muir, in Dumfriesshire. At last one  William Bryden rented the farm of Aberlosk, and soon, by the _original_  plan of draining, and building stone enclosures, made it, to use the  words of his able biographer, Mr Scot of Selkirkshire, \"like the land  of Goshen, good for cattle which it is to this day.\"    (66.) _Varieties among Animals._--All organized matter is subject to  variety. It may be doubted whether, since the creation of the world,  there have ever occurred, either at the same, or at separate periods,  two individuals in every respect perfectly alike. A plant, or an  animal, may resemble the rest of its species in chemical constitution,  and in the number and situation of its organs, but is sure to differ  from all in size, general configuration, and disposition of its parts:  These shades of difference, endless though they are, may be referred  to two leading causes--climate and descent; the former embracing  deviations induced by temperature and resources of subsistence; the  latter including changes occasioned by management, modes of breeding,  and influence of sex.    (67.) _Varieties induced by Temperature._--The influence of temperature  extends chiefly to the _colour_ and _development_ of animals. In cold  regions the skin of the human race is fair, and the person squat and  stunted, but as we approach the equator, the hue becomes deeper and  deeper, till it is jetty black, while at the same time, the stature  attains nearer and nearer to the tallest proportions to which mankind  seem naturally entitled. The animals of the arctic regions are, for the  greater part of the year, covered with a clothing of the purest white,  which is, however, in many of them, abandoned for one of deeper tints  as the solar heat begins to gain the ascendant. But how very different  do we not find the colours of intertropical animals. There vivid tints,  and an almost metallic lustre, pervade animated beings, from the coral  in its submarine abode, to the gallinaceous birds, the coxcombs of the  forest. In this, as in every other department of nature, the most  beautiful harmony, or, in other words, a union of what is pleasing to  the eye, and suited for the comfort of the creature, every where  prevails. The colour of an animal envelope is never at variance with  the tints of surrounding objects. A painter, for example, would not  place a flower or animal of brilliant hue amidst the monotonous aspect  of an arctic landscape; neither would he picture the faintly-tinted  beings of a polar latitude, as surrounded by the warm and flashy  colouring characteristic of an oriental climate. As temperature, then,  determines in a marked degree the colour and dimensions of every  animal, such variations render the division of living beings into races  and varieties, a matter of necessity. Thus all human beings belong only  to one species, which may, however, be divided into five races, and  these again into an infinity of varieties. The differences between a  race and a variety are, that the latter is a subdivision of the former,  and that in the former the modifications are more profound, the changes  not being confined to the surface, but extending to the frame-work of  the body; whereas, to constitute a variety, nothing more is necessary  than the superficial influence of heat and light on the skin, and its  appendages the hairs. The Negro and the Abyssinian are precisely  similar in colour, yet they are by no means of the same race, as their  different features will distinctly prove; the Abyssinian approaching as  much in cast of countenance to the European, as the negro does to the  higher orders of the ape. The same may be noticed among sheep, but this  is sufficient for the present.    The changes induced by climate, result from the working of a power  inherent in most animals and vegetables, by which they are suited  within certain limits, for bearing up against removal from their  ordinary localities, and assuming a different cast, as the place of  their exile may differ in degree from that which they have left. This  gradual adaptation to circumstances by an accommodating power is  termed, in philosophical language, acclimation.    (68.) _Adaptation of the Sheep to Climate._--No animal varies more  than the sheep, and none so speedily adapts itself to climate; it  would almost appear that nature, convinced of its great utility, had  bestowed upon it a constitution so pliant, as to enable it to  accommodate itself to any point in a wide scale of temperature; for  though its natural situation as a wool-bearing animal, like that of  man appears to be the wine countries, yet with him, it has spread to  every quarter of the globe, becoming impressed at every change with  some peculiarity, alterable only by a change of situation, and  varying, we might almost affirm, with the weather; for, where the  temperature is equable, there does the animal preserve unchanged an  atmospheric stamp, and defies our efforts to alter the breed; while  under a fluctuating sky we can model it at will, though in this case,  continued exertions are required to secure them for any length of time  in an undeviating course.    (69.) _Changes produced by Climate._--The wonderful power of  temperature in effecting changes upon animals, is well illustrated by  the Portuguese, who, after a residence of three hundred years in  India, are said to be at present almost as black as Caffres. Bishop  Heber, speaking of India, says, \"It is remarkable to observe how  surely all these classes of men (whites--Persians, Greeks, Tartars,  Turks, and Arabians), in a few generations, even without any  inter-marriage with the Hindoos, assume the deep olive tint, little  less dark than a negro, which seems natural to the climate.\" Buchanan  also in his travels through the same country, alludes to a tribe of  black Jews who have, in all probability, been settled in the district  ever since the period of the captivity under Nebuchadnezzar, 3000  years ago, and who retain all the national peculiarities of their  race, with the exception of their colour, which is now as dark as that  of the surrounding tribes. These examples, however, it may be  affirmed, are not to the point, as embracing theories in regard to  peculiar changes in an animal different from the sheep, but such  objections are perfectly groundless, as what will affect colour in  mankind, will lead to changes even of a more wonderful nature in the  sheep, seeing that it is abandoned more entirely to such an influence.    (70.) _Temperature preferred by Sheep._--Sheep, though capable of  thriving in a great variety of climates, seem to prefer such as are  temperate, and in these only do they arrive at perfection. They are  common on the Cordilleras at an elevation of from 3300 to 8200 feet,  within which limits they propagate readily without any care; but the  reverse is the case in hotter regions, it being difficult to rear  lambs in the plains of Meta, and no sheep are to be met with from the  river to the foot of the Cordilleras, though their skins, from being  in demand for making parchment, sell as high as those of the ox. Sheep  were at one time, according to Thunberg, the scarcest articles in  Batavia, as their woolly coat rendered the heat of the climate quite  insupportable; but this inconvenience was at last remedied by sending  them, on their arrival from the Cape, further up the country, to the  Blue Mountains, where the air is several degrees colder. The question  then naturally occurs, if an elevation of temperature is, as in this  instance, fatal to these animals, how do they happen to have spread  over a vast tract of country in spite of such extremes? Simply for the  reason, that when an animal is left to the exercise of its own free  will, and the dominion of its instincts, it will not subject itself to  the danger of an extreme in any thing. It will not traverse several  hundred miles in a single season, and thus expose itself to sudden  changes. The natural dispersion of all animals is gradual, so that  their constitutions are enabled, from the slowness of the transition,  to accommodate themselves, by an alteration in covering and habit, to  surrounding circumstances, which would, were the variations abrupt,  speedily destroy it. The reason why a race of animals occasionally  thrives so well in a country to which it may be removed, appears to  lie in its being suited, I may say, accidentally, by peculiar  conformation, to the temperature to which it is transplanted. There  are some happy climates where, introduce what animals you will, no  matter how stunted they are, or how different the degree of warmth may  be, their offspring will thrive, proving large and vigorous, and every  way worthy of being placed at the head of its species. These are,  however, cases where the transition is from an extreme of heat or cold  to a temperate atmosphere. Witness what Mr Dawson, the manager of the  Australian Agricultural Company, says in his private journal (quoted  in _Cunningham's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3819"],[0,"The Euahlayi Tribe: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia (#14)"],[1,"with the utmost contempt  since their birth, and declines to acknowledge more than one of the  babies.    They say the first-born of twins is always born grinning with his  tongue out, as if to say, 'There's another to come yet; nice sort of  mother I have.'    No wonder the women cover themselves under a blanket when they see a  whirlwind coming, and avoid drooping Coolabah trees, believing that  either may make them objects of scorn as the mother of twins.    When a baby is born, some old woman takes the Coolabah leaf out of its  mouth. Such a leaf is said always to be found there if the baby was  incarnated from a Coolabah tree; should this leaf not be removed it  will carry the baby back to spirit-land. As soon as the leaf is taken  away the baby is bathed in cold water. Hot gum leaves are pressed on  the bridge of its nose to ensure its flatness; the more bridgeless the  nose the greater the beauty.    When a baby clutches hold of anything as if to give it to some one, the  bargie--grandmother--or some elderly woman takes what the baby offers,  and makes a muffled clicking sort of noise with her tongue rolled over  against the roof of her mouth, then croons the charm which is to make  the child a free giver: so is generosity inculcated in extreme youth. I  have often heard the grannies croon over the babies:      Oonahgnai Birrablee,    Oonahgnoo Birrahlee,    Oonahgnoo Birrahlee,    Oonabmillangoo Birrahlee,    Gunnoognoo oonah Birrahlee.    Which translated is:      'Give to me, Baby,    Give to her, Baby,    Give to him, Baby,    Give to one, Baby,    Give to all, Baby.'    As babies are all under the patronage of the moon, the mothers are very  careful every new moon to make a white cross-like mark on the babies'  foreheads, and white dabs on cheeks and chins.    And very careful are the mothers not to look at the full moon, nor let  their babies do so; an attack of thrush would be the result.    Bahloo, too, has a spiteful way of punishing a woman who has the  temerity to stare at him, by sending her the dreaded twins.    If babies do not sleep well their mothers get the red powdered stuff  like pine pollen, from the joints of the Bingahwingul, or needlebush  tree, and rub it on the babies' skulls and foreheads.    If the babies cry too much their mothers say evil spirits are in them,  and must be smoked out. They make a smoke fire of Budtha twigs and hold  the baby in the thick of the smoke. I have seen the mother of a fretful  child of three or four years even, apply the smoke anodyne.    Whenever the mother of a young child woke in the night, if well up in  her mother duties, she was supposed to warm her hands, and rub her  baby's joints so that the child might grow lissome and a good shape,  and she always saw that her baby's mouth was shut when the child was  asleep lest an evilly disposed person should slip in a disease or  evil-working spirit. For the same reason they will not let a baby lie  on its back unless they cover its head.    If a gilah flies over the camp crying out as it passes, it is a sure  sign of 'debbil debbil'; the child, to escape evil consequences, must  be turned on to its left side.    If a gooloo, or magpie, did the same, the child had to be laid flat on  her moobil--stomach: for the passing of a cawing crow, a child had to  be laid on the right side.    As these birds are not night birds, it is evident that they are evil  spirits abroad in bird form, hence the precautions. As soon as a baby  begins to crawl, the mother finds a centipede, half cooks it, takes it  from the fire, and catching hold of her child's hands beats them with  it, crooning as she does so:      'Gheerlayi ghilayer,    Wahl munnoomerhdayer,    Wahl mooroonbahgoo,    Yelgayerdayer deermuldayer,    Gheerlayi ghilayer.'    Which means:      'Kind be,    Do not steal,    Do not touch what to another belongs,    Leave all such alone,    Kind be.'    The accompaniment being a muffled click of a rolled-up tongue against  the roof of a mouth.    No child must touch the big feathers of a goomblegubbon, or bustard's  wings, nor any of its bones. At the age of about four, the mother takes  one of these wings and beats the child all over the shoulders and under  the arms with it. Again making the clicking noise, she croons:      'Goobean gillaygoo,    Oogowahdee goobolaygoo,    Wahl goonundoo,    Ghurranbul daygoo.'    Which charm means:      'A swimmer be,    Flood to swim against,    No water,    Strong to stop you.'    And so was a child made a good swimmer.    The wirreenuns would see that the septum of a child's nose was pierced  at the right time, and their tribal marks cut on them. The nose was  pierced at midwinter when ice was about, with which to numb the place  to be pierced; ice was held to the septum, then prod through it went a  bone needle.    An old gin who worked about the station had a pierced nose, and often  wore a mouyerh, or bone, through it. A white laundress wore earrings.  She said one day to the old gin:    'Why you have hole made in your nose and put that bone there? No good  that. White women don't do that.'    The black woman looked the laundress up and down, and finally anchored  her eyes on the earrings.    'Why you make hole in your ears? No good that. Black gin no do that,  pull 'em down your ears like dogs. Plenty good bone in your nose make  you sing good. Sposin' cuggil--bad--smell you put bone longa nose no  smell 'im. Plenty good make hole longa nose, no good make hole longa  ears, make 'em hang down all same dogs.' And off she went laughing, and  pulling down the lobes of her ears, began to imitate the barking of a  dog.    There is often a baby betrothal called Bahnmul.    For some reason or another it has been decided that a baby girl is to  be given to a man, perhaps because he has been kind to her mother,  perhaps she is owed to his kin by her own; any way the granny of the  baby girl puts feathers, white swansdown, on the baby's head, and takes  her over to the man when she is about a month old. Granny says to the  baby:    'Look at him, and remember him, because you are promised to him.'    Then she takes some feathers off the baby's head and puts them on to  his; that makes it a formal betrothal, binding to both sides.    I have heard great camp rows because girls made a struggle for  independence, having found out they had only been promised, not  formally betrothed, to some old chap whom they did not wish to marry.  Perhaps the old fellow will already have a wife or so, a man can have  as many as he pleases. I have heard of one with three; I have known  some with two; but the generality of them seem content with one.    Should a young girl marry a man with an old wife, the old wife rules  her to any extent, not even letting her have a say about her own  children, and no duenna could be stricter. Should the young wife in the  absence of her husband speak to a young man, she will probably get a  scolding from the old wife and a 'real hiding' from the old man, to  whom the old wife will report her conduct. Quite young men often marry  quite old women; a reason sometimes given is that these young men were  on earth before and loved these same women, but died before their  initiation, so could not marry until now in their reincarnation.    Certainly, amongst the blacks, age is no disqualification for a woman;  she never seems to be too old to marry, and certainly with age gains  power.    At whatever age a girl may be betrothed to a man he never claims her  while she is yet Mullerhgun, or child girl; not until she is  Wirreebeeun, or woman girl.    A girl's initiation into womanhood is as follows. Her granny probably,  or some old woman relation, takes her from the big camp into the scrub  where they make a bough shade. As soon as this is made, the old woman  sets fire to a thick heap of Budtha leaves and makes the girl swallow  the smoke. She then bids her lie down in a scooped-out hollow she has  made in the earth, saying to her, 'You are to be made a young woman  now. No more must you run about as you please. Here must you stay with  me, doing as I say. Then in two moons' time you shall go and claim your  husband, to do for ever what he bids you. You must not sleep as you lie  there in the day time, nor must you go to sleep at night until those in  the camp are at rest. I will put food ready for you. Honey you must not  eat again for four moons. At first streak of day you must get up, and  eat the food I have placed for you. Then when you hear a bird note you  must shake yourself all over, and make a noise like this.'    And the old woman makes a ringing noise with her lips.    'That you must do every time you hear a fresh bird note; so too when  you hear the people in the camp begin to talk, or even if you hear them  laugh or sneeze. If you do not, then grey will your hair be while you  are yet a young woman, dull will your eyes be, and limp your body.'    Girls have told me that they got very tired of being away with only the  old woman for so long, and were glad enough when she told them they  were to move to a new camp, nearer to the big one, which the women had  prepared for them.    When they reached this the old woman rubbed off the mud with which she  had plastered the girl's limbs when first they went away to camp, and  which she had renewed from time to time. When this was all off she  painted the girl in different designs with red ochre and white gypsum,  principally in spots. She put on her head a gnooloogail, or forehead  band, made of Kurrajong fibre, plaited and tied with some Kurrajong  string, from over the cars to the back of the head; in this band, which  she had painted white, she stuck sprays of white flowers. Sweetly  scented Budtha and clustering Birah were the flowers most used for this  ceremony. Should neither of these be in bloom, then sprays of Collarene  or Coolibah blossom were used. When the flowers were placed in the band  the old "]]]
