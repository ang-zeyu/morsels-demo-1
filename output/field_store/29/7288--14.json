Selection  cannot be brought into play to produce distinct breeds, or to keep those  distinct which have been imported from foreign lands. On the other hand, in  islands and in countries completely separated from each other, we meet with  breeds more or less distinct; and these cases are worth giving, showing  that the scarcity of distinct races in the same country is not caused by a  deficiency of variability in the animal. The tailless cats of the Isle of  Man are said to differ from common cats not only in the want of a tail, but  in the greater length of their hind legs, in the size of their heads, and  in habits. The Creole cat of Antigua, as I am informed by Mr. Nicholson, is  smaller, and has a more elongated head, than the British cat. In Ceylon, as  Mr. Thwaites writes to me, every one at first notices the different  appearance of the native cat from the English animal; it is of small size,  with closely lying hairs; its head is small, with a receding forehead; but  the ears are large and sharp; altogether it has what is there called a  \"low-caste\" appearance. Rengger (1/93. 'Saugethiere von Paraguay' 1830 s.  212.) says that the domestic cat, which has been bred for 300 years in  Paraguay, presents a striking difference from the European cat; it is  smaller by a fourth, has a more lanky body, its hair is short, shining,  scanty and lies close, especially on the tail: he adds that the change has  been less at Ascension, the capital of Paraguay, owing to the continual  crossing with newly imported cats; and this fact well illustrates the  importance of separation. The conditions of life in Paraguay appear not to  be highly favourable to the cat, for, though they have run half-wild, they  do not become thoroughly feral, like so many other European animals. In  another part of South America, according to Roulin (1/94. 'Mem. presentes  par divers Savans: Acad. Roy. des Sciences' tome 6 page 346. Gomara first  noticed this fact in 1554.), the introduced cat has lost the habit of  uttering its hideous nocturnal howl. The Rev. W.D. Fox purchased a cat in  Portsmouth, which he was told came from the coast of Guinea; its skin was  black and wrinkled, fur bluish-grey and short, its ears rather bare, legs  long, and whole aspect peculiar. This \"negro\" cat was fertile with common  cats. On the opposite coast of Africa, at Mombas, Captain Owen, R.N. (1/95.  'Narrative of Voyages' volume 2 page 180.) states that all the cats are  covered with short stiff hair instead of fur: he gives a curious account of  a cat from Algoa Bay, which had been kept for some time on board and could  be identified with certainty; this animal was left for only eight weeks at  Mombas, but during that short period it \"underwent a complete  metamorphosis, having parted with its sandy-coloured fur.\" A cat from the  Cape of Good Hope has been described by Desmarest as remarkable from a red  stripe extending along the whole length of its back. Throughout an immense  area, namely, the Malayan archipelago, Siam, Pegu, and Burmah, all the cats  have truncated tails about half the proper length (1/96. J. Crawfurd  'Descript. Dict. of the Indian Islands' page 255. The Madagascar cat is  said to have a twisted tail; see Desmarest in 'Encyclop. Nat. Mamm.' 1820  page 233, for some of the other breeds.), often with a sort of knot at the  end. In the Caroline archipelago the cats have very long legs, and are of a  reddish-yellow colour. (1/97. Admiral Lutke's Voyage volume 3 page 308.) In  China a breed has drooping ears. At Tobolsk, according to Gmelin, there is  a red-coloured breed. In Asia, also, we find the well-known Angora or  Persian breed.    The domestic cat has run wild in several countries, and everywhere assumes,  as far as can be judged by the short recorded descriptions, a uniform  character. Near Maldonado, in La Plata, I shot one which seemed perfectly  wild; it was carefully examined by Mr. Waterhouse (1/98. 'Zoology of the  Voyage of the Beagle, Mammalia' page 20. Dieffenbach 'Travels in New  Zealand' volume 2 page 185. Ch. St. John 'Wild Sports of the Highlands'  1846 page 40.), who found nothing remarkable in it, excepting its great  size. In New Zealand according to Dieffenbach, the feral cats assume a  streaky grey colour like that of wild cats; and this is the case with the  half-wild cats of the Scotch Highlands.    We have seen that distant countries possess distinct domestic races of the  cat. The differences may be in part due to descent from several aboriginal  species, or at least to crosses with them. In some cases, as in Paraguay,  Mombas, and Antigua, the differences seem due to the direct action of  different conditions of life. In other cases some slight effect may  possibly be attributed to natural selection, as cats in many cases have  largely to support themselves and to escape diverse dangers. But man, owing  to the difficulty of pairing cats, has done nothing by methodical  selection; and probably very little by unintentional selection; though in  each litter he generally saves the prettiest, and values most a good breed  of mouse- or rat-catchers. Those cats which have a strong tendency to prowl  after game, generally get destroyed by traps. As cats are so much petted, a  breed bearing the same relation to other cats, that lapdogs bear to larger  dogs, would have been much valued; and if selection could have been  applied, we should certainly have had many breeds in each long-civilised  country, for there is plenty of variability to work upon.    We see in this country considerable diversity in size, some in the  proportions of the body, and extreme variability in colouring. I have only  lately attended to this subject, but have already heard of some singular  cases of variation; one of a cat born in the West Indies toothless, and  remaining so all its life. Mr. Tegetmeier has shown me the skull of a  female cat with its canines so much developed that they protruded uncovered  beyond the lips; the tooth with the fang being .95, and the part projecting  from the gum .6 of an inch in length. I have heard of several families of  six-toed cats, in one of which the peculiarity had been transmitted for at  least three generations. The tail varies greatly in length; I have seen a  cat which always carried its tail flat on its back when pleased. The ears  vary in shape, and certain strains, in England, inherit a pencil-like tuft  of hairs, above a quarter of an inch in length, on the tips of their ears;  and this same peculiarity, according to Mr. Blyth, characterises some cats  in India. The great variability in the length of the tail and the lynx-like  tufts of hairs on the ears are apparently analogous to differences in  certain wild species of the genus. A much more important difference,  according to Daubenton (1/99. Quoted by Isid. Geoffroy 'Hist. Nat. Gen.'  tome 3 page 427.), is that the intestines of domestic cats are wider, and a  third longer, than in wild cats of the same size; and this apparently has  been by their less strictly carnivorous diet.

The history of the Horse is lost in antiquity. Remains of this animal in a  domesticated condition have been found in the Swiss lake-dwellings,  belonging to the Neolithic period. (2/1. Rutimeyer 'Fauna der Pfahlbauten'  1861 s. 122.) At the present time the number of breeds is great, as may be  seen by consulting any treatise on the Horse. (2/2. See 'Youatt on the  Horse': J. Lawrence on the Horse 1829; W.C.L. Martin 'History of the Horse'  1845: Col. H. Smith in 'Nat. Library, Horses' 1841 volume 12: Prof. Veith  'Die naturgesch. Haussaugethiere' 1856.) Looking only to the native ponies  of Great Britain, those of the Shetland Isles, Wales, the New Forest, and  Devonshire are distinguishable; and so it is, amongst other instances, with  each separate island in the great Malay archipelago. (2/3. Crawfurd  'Descript. Dict. of Indian Islands' 1856 page 153. \"There are many  different breeds, every island having at least one peculiar to it.\" Thus in  Sumatra there are at least two breeds; in Achin and Batubara one; in Java  several breeds; one in Bali, Lomboc, Sumbawa (one of the best breeds),  Tambora, Bima, Gunung-api, Celebes, Sumba, and Philippines. Other breeds  are specified by Zollinger in the 'Journal of the Indian Archipelago'  volume 5 page 343 etc.) Some of the breeds present great differences in  size, shape of ears, length of mane, proportions of the body, form of the  withers and hind quarters, and especially in the head. Compare the race-  horse, dray-horse, and a Shetland pony in size, configuration, and  disposition; and see how much greater the difference is than between the  seven or eight other living species of the genus Equus.    Of individual variations not known to characterise particular breeds, and  not great or injurious enough to be called monstrosities, I have not  collected many cases. Mr. G. Brown, of the Cirencester Agricultural  College, who has particularly attended to the dentition of our domestic  animals, writes to me that he has \"several times noticed eight permanent  incisors instead of six in the jaw.\" Male horses only should have canines,  but they are occasionally found in the mare, though a small size.

Have at it,\" and the men fall to  fighting. The fight grows hotter and hotter. Escamillo's knife  suddenly snaps off short. Jose is about to kill him when Carmen and  the men are heard running back. They have encountered some one in the  valley below and have returned just in time to interrupt the quarrel.    \"Jose,\" she screams, and holds his arm. Then he is set upon by the  others and held in check. Escamillo throws his arms about Carmen and  taunts the helpless fellow. Jose rages.    \"I'm off, my fine dragoon,\" he cries, \"but if you love me you will all  come to the bull fight next week at Seville. Come, my friend,\" to  Jose, \"and see what a really good looking fellow is like,\" he taunts,  looking gaily at Carmen. He goes off, down the path, while Jose is  struggling to free himself, and at that moment, Michaela, nearly dead  with fright, falls upon the rock, and is heard by the men. El  Remendado hears her and runs out. He returns bringing the young girl  with him.    \"Michaela!\" Jose calls.    \"Jose! your mother is dying. I have come for you. For God's sake----\"    \"My mother dying,\" he shakes off the men. Then the voice of Escamillo  is heard far down the mountain singing back at Carmen the Toreador's  song. Carmen rushes for the entrance to the cave. She will follow  Escamillo. Jose goes wild with rage. He bars the entrance.    \"My mother is dying. I am going to her--but your time too has come,\"  he swears, looking at Carmen. \"I have lost friends, honour, and now my  mother for you, and I swear you shall reckon with me for all this  wrong. When we meet again, I shall kill you,\" and he disappears behind  the rocks with Michaela.      ACT IV    Back in gay Seville, not near to its cigarette factory and the  guard-house, but at the scene of the great bull-fight, where Escamillo  is to strut and show what a famous fellow he deserves to be! The old  amphitheatre at the back with its awning stretched, the foreground  with its orange-girls, fan-girls, wine-pedlars, ragged idlers and  beggars, fine gentlemen, mules--all eager for the entertainment!  Escamillo is the man who kills bulls and makes love to all the pretty  girls he sees. Everybody wants to get a peep at him. The air is full  of excitement. Everybody, wine-sellers, orange-girls, all dance and  twirl about, and donkeys' bells tinkle, and some are eating, and some  are drinking. The Alcalde is to attend, and all the fine ladies and  gentlemen of Seville. Here comes Zuniga.    \"Here, bring me some oranges,\" he orders, in his old  at-least-a-general fashion. The smugglers had let him loose, of  course, as soon as Carmen and Jose had got away from Lillas Pastia's  inn, that night. He sits to eat his oranges and to watch the gradually  assembling crowd. Frasquita and Mercedes are on hand, and there is a  fair sprinkling of smugglers and other gipsies.    \"Here they come, here they come!\" some one cries, and almost at once  the beginning of the bull-fighting procession appears. First the  cuadrilla, then the alguazil, chulos, banderilleros--all covered with  spangles and gold lace; and the picadors with their pointed lances  with which to goad the bull. Every division in a different colour, and  everybody fixed for a good time, except the bull, perhaps. After all  these chromo gentlemen have had a chance at him, Escamillo will  courageously step up and kill him. Yes, Spain is all ready for a good  time! Now at last comes Escamillo.    \"Viva Escamillo!\" If one ever saw a beauty-man, he is one! He might as  well have been a woman, he is so good-looking. He has a most beautiful  love song with Carmen, who of course is in the very midst of the  excitement, and in the midst of the song, the great Alcalde arrives.  Nobody wants to see the bull-fight more than he does. He was brought  up on bull-fights. His entrance makes a new sensation.    In the midst of the hurly-burly Frasquita forces her way to Carmen.    \"You want to get away from here. I have seen Don Jose in this crowd.  If he finds you there will be trouble----\"    \"For him maybe.\" Carmen returns, insolently looking about to see if  she can espy Jose. The girls urge her not to go too far; to keep out  of Jose's way, but she refuses point blank.    \"Leave the fight and Escamillo? Not for twenty Joses. Here I am, and  here I stay,\" she declares. Everybody but Carmen thinks of the fortune  in the cave: death, death, death! But gradually the great crowd passes  into the amphitheatre, and Carmen has promised Escamillo to await him  when he shall come out triumphant; and Escamillo has no sooner bade  Carmen good-bye than Jose swings into the square in search of Carmen.    Carmen sees him and watches him. He does not look angry. As a matter  of fact he has gone through so much sorrow (the death of his mother,  and the jeers of his friends) that he has sought Carmen only with  tenderness in his heart. He now goes up to her and tells her this.    \"Indeed, I thought you had come to murder me.\"    \"I have come to take you away from these gipsies and smugglers. If you  are apart from them you will do better. I love you and want you to go  away from here, and together we will begin over and try to do better.\"    Carmen looks at him and laughs. Suddenly she hears cheering from the  amphitheatre and starts toward it. Jose interposes.    \"You let me alone. I want to go in----\"    \"To see Escamillo----\"    \"Why not--since I love him----\"    \"How is that?\"    \"As I said----\" At this, a blind rage takes possession of Don Jose.  All his good purposes are forgotten. For a moment he still pleads with  her to go away, and she taunts him more cruelly. Then in a flash  Jose's knife is drawn, another flash and Carmen's fortune is verified:  she falls dead at the entrance to the amphitheatre, just as the crowd  is coming out, cheering the victorious Escamillo. Jose falls beside  her, nearly mad with grief for what he has done in a fit of rage,  while Escamillo comes out, already fascinated by some other girl, and  caring little that Carmen is dead--except that the body is in the way.  Jose is under arrest, Carmen dead, and the great crowd passes on,  cheering:    \"Escamillo, Escamillo forever!\"          DEKOVEN      Smith and DeKoven, who have made countless thousands laugh, are living  still, and will very likely continue to do gracious things for the  comic-opera-loving public.    The very imperfect sketch of the opera, \"Robin Hood,\" given in this  book, is lacking in coherence and in completeness in every way, but a  prompt-book, being necessary properly to give the story, is not  obtainable. Rather than ignore an American performance which is so  graceful, so elegant, and which should certainly be known to every  child, an attempt had been made to outline the story.    Little idea can be had of the opera's charm from this sketch, but the  opera is likely to live, even after the topical stories of \"Pinafore\"  and \"The Mikado\" have lost their application, because the story of  Robin Hood is romantic forever, and the DeKoven music is not likely to  lose its charm.    \"Robin Hood\" was first produced at the Chicago Opera House, June 9,  1890, by the Bostonian Opera Company. In January, 1891, under the  management of Mr. Horace Sedger, the opera was produced, under the  title of \"Maid Marian,\" at the Prince of Wales's Theatre in London.  The cast included Mr. Haydn Coffin, Mr. Harry Markham, Miss Marion  Manola, and Miss Violet Cameron.      ROBIN HOOD    CHARACTERS OF THE OPERA    Robin Hood                 Edwin H.

We roam and rove in Sherwood's grove,         Beneath the greenwood tree.       Through all the glades and sylvan shades         Our homes (through the glades) are found;       We hunt the deer, afar and near,         Our hunting horns do we sound.    And thus begins the merriest tale of the merriest lives imaginable. It  is on a May morning: every young sprint and his sweetheart in  Nottingham are out in their best, for the fair--May-day fair in  Nottingham; and near at hand, Alan-a-Dale, Little John, Will Scarlet,  Friar Tuck, and the finest company of outlaws ever told about, are  just entering the town to add to the gaiety.    Now in the village of Nottingham lived Dame Durden and her daughter,  Annabel. Annabel was a flirtatious young woman who welcomed the  outlaws in her very best manner. She assured them that outlaws of such  high position would surely add much to the happiness of the occasion;  and they certainly did, before the day was over. The outlaws came in,  as fine a looking lot and as handsome as one would wish to see, and  joined the village dance. It was an old English dance, called a  \"Morris Dance,\" with a lilt and a tilt which set all feet a-going.    [Music:         Fa la, fa la,       Trip a morris dance hilarious,       Lightly brightly,       Trip in measure multifarious,       Fa la la, fa la la,       Trip a morris dance hilarious,       Lightly and brightly we celebrate the fair!]    If anything was needed to add to the gaiety of the day, the outlaws  furnished it, because, among other things, they brought to the fair a  lot of goods belonging to other people, and they meant to put them up  at auction.    Friar Tuck was an old renegade monk who travelled about with the merry  men of Sherwood, to seem to lend a little piety to their doings. He  had a little bottle-shaped belly and the dirtiest face possible, a  tonsured head, and he wore a long brown habit tied"]]]
