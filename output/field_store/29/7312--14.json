By V. T. ATKINSON, V. S.    [Revised by C. DWIGHT MARSH, Ph. D.]      DEFINITION OF A POISON.    To define clearly the meaning of the word \"poison\" is somewhat difficult.  Even in law the word has never been defined, and when a definition is  attempted we are apt to include either too much or too little. The  following definition given by Husemann is perhaps the best: \"Poisons are  those substances, inorganic or organic, existing in the organism or  introduced from the outside, produced artificially or formed as natural  products, which, through their chemical nature, under definite conditions,  so affect some organ of a living organism that the health or well-being of  the organism is temporarily or chronically injured.\" The common conception  of a poison is any substance which, in small quantity, will destroy life,  except such as act by purely mechanical means, as, for example, powdered  glass.    Some substances that are not usually looked upon as poisons may destroy  life if given in large doses, such as common salt. Other substances which  are perfectly harmless when taken into the body in the usual way are  poisons if injected into the circulation, such as distilled water, milk, or  glycerin. Living organisms are not \"chemical substances,\" and are not  considered in this connection.      SOURCES OF POISONING.    Poisoning may come from many causes, among the chief of which are the  following:    (1) _Errors in medication._--By using the wrong substance or too large dose  an animal may be poisoned.    (2) _The exposure of poisons used for horticultural, technical, or other  legitimate purposes._--Poisons used for spraying plants, disinfecting,  poisoning vermin, dipping cattle or sheep, painting, smelting, dyeing, or  other purposes may be so handled as to come within the reach of animals.    (3) _Damaged food._--Food that has undergone putrefaction or certain kinds  of fermentation or heating, may have become poisonous, producing forage  poisoning, meat poisoning, cheese poisoning, etc.    (4) _Poisonous plants in the pasture or forage._    (5) _The bite or sting of a poisonous insect or the bite of an animal._    (6) _Malicious poisoning._      THE ACTION OF POISONS.    The action of poisons may be either local, and exerted directly on the  tissues with which they come in contact, or remote, acting through the  circulation or the nervous system; or both local and remote action may be  exerted by the same drug. Poisons which act locally generally either  destroy by corrosion the tissues with which they come in contact or by  inhalation set up acute inflammation. When any corrosive agent is taken  into the stomach in poisonous quantities, a group of symptoms is developed  which is common to all. The tissues with which the agent comes in contact  are destroyed, sloughing and acute inflammation of the surrounding  structures take place; intense pain in the abdomen and death ensue. In a  like manner, but with less rapidity, the same result is reached if the  agent used be not of a sufficiently corrosive nature to destroy the  tissues, but sufficiently irritating to set up acute inflammation of the  mucous membrane of the digestive tract. If the poison exerts a remote  influence alone, the action is quite different, little or no local effect  being produced upon the digestive organs.    To produce an effect on some part of the body distant from the channel of  entrance, a poison must have been absorbed and carried in the blood to the  central nervous system or other region involved. The poisonous effect of  any substance is modified by the quantity used; by its chemical  combinations; by the part of the animal structure with which it comes in  contact; by the physical condition of the subject; and also by the rapidity  with which the poison is excreted. As an illustration, opium may be given  with safety in much larger doses to an animal suffering from acute pain  than to one free from pain, and to an adult animal with greater safety than  to a young one. The rapidity with which the poison is absorbed, owing to  the part of the body with which it is brought in contact, is also an  important factor. So marked is this quality that some agents which have the  power of destroying life with almost absolute certainty when introduced  beneath the skin, may be taken into the stomach without causing  inconvenience, as curara, the arrow poisons, or the venomous secretion of  snakes. Other agents in chemical combination may tend to intensify, lessen,  or wholly neutralize the poisonous effect. For example, arsenic in itself  has well-marked poisonous properties, but when brought in contact with  dialyzed iron it forms an insoluble compound and becomes innocuous.  Idiosyncrasies are not so noticeable in cattle practice as in practice  among human beings, but the uncertainty with which some drugs exert their  influence would lead us to believe that well-marked differences in  susceptibility exist. Even in some cases a tolerance for poison is  engendered, so that in a herd of animals equally exposed injurious or fatal  effects do not appear with uniformity. For example, among cattle that are  compelled to drink water holding in solution a salt of lead the effects of  the poisoning will be found varying all the way from fatality to  imperceptibility.      GENERAL SYMPTOMS OF POISONING.    It is not always easy to differentiate between poisoning and some disease.  Indeed, examination during the life of the animal is sometimes wholly  inadequate to the formation of an opinion as to whether the case is one of  poisoning or, if it is, as to what the poison may be. A chemical and  physical examination after the death of the animal may be necessary to  clear up the doubt. On the other hand, the symptoms may be of such a nature  as to point unmistakably to poisoning with a certain agent. In general, the  following classes of symptoms may be regarded as indicative of poisoning:  Sudden onset of the disease without visible cause, a number of animals  being similarly affected at once, with severe gastrointestinal disorder or  derangement of the nervous system, or both; sudden alteration of heart  action in relation to frequency, force, or rhythm; local irritation,  dyspnea, or change in the urine or urination.    After death, lesions of the greatest variety may be found, and it is  necessary for one to be skilled in anatomy and pathology in order to  determine their significance. Oftentimes the stomach and intestines are  red, have thick walls, and contain blood. This signifies a severe irritant,  such as arsenic or corrosive sublimate. Other alterations sometimes found  are inflammation of the kidneys or bladder, points of hemorrhage in various  organs, changes in the blood, congestion of the lungs, and certain  microscopic changes.      GENERAL TREATMENT.    The treatment of animals suffering from poison must vary according to the  nature of the toxic agent. There are a few general plans of action,  however, which should be followed so far as possible. In man and in some of  the smaller animals it is possible to eliminate unabsorbed poison by the  use of the stomach pump or by causing vomiting. These proceedings are  impracticable in cattle. It is well, therefore, in many cases to endeavor  to expel the unabsorbed poison by emptying the digestive tract, so far as  may be, with a nonirritating purge. Castor oil in doses of 1 pint to 2  quarts is adapted to this purpose. If the poison is known to be  nonirritant--as a narcotic plant--from 10 to 20 drops of croton oil may be  given with a quart of castor oil. When poisons are somewhat prolonged in  their effect, Epsom salt in doses of 1 pound can be given advantageously.  To protect the mucous membrane from the action of strong irritants, one may  give flaxseed tea, barley water, the whites of eggs, milk, butter, olive  oil, or fresh lard. Chemical antidotes may sometimes be used for special  poisons, as advised below. In general, if an acid has been taken it may be  neutralized with an alkali, such as chalk, magnesia, bicarbonate of soda  (baking soda), ammonia (diluted), or soap. If the poison is an alkali, such  as caustic soda or potash (lye), or ammonia, an acid, such as diluted (1  per cent) sulphuric acid or vinegar, may be administered. Special  treatments and antidotes are considered below.    A poisonous agent may be so gradually introduced into the system as to  slowly develop the power of resistance against its own action. In other  cases where the poison is introduced slowly the poisonous action becomes  accumulative, and, although there is no increase in the quantity taken,  violent symptoms are suddenly developed, as if the whole amount, the  consumption of which may have extended over a considerable period, had been  given in one dose. Other agents, poisonous in their nature, tend to  deteriorate some of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3032"],[0,"The Fathers of the Constitution: A Chronicle of the Establishment of the Union (#14)"],[1,"the Formation of the  Constitution,\" vol. ii, Appendix, pp. 399-400.      Among these \"men denominated 'gentlemen'\" to whom the French Charge  d'Affaires alludes, was James Madison of Virginia. He was one of the  younger men, unfitted by temperament and physique to be a soldier, who  yet had found his opportunity in the Revolution. Graduating in 1771  from Princeton, where tradition tells of the part he took in patriotic  demonstrations on the campus--characteristic of students then as now--he  had thrown himself heart and soul into the American cause. He was a  member of the convention to frame the first State Constitution for  Virginia in 1776, and from that time on, because of his ability, he was  an important figure in the political history of his State and of his  country. He was largely responsible for bringing about the conference  between Virginia and Maryland and for the subsequent steps resulting  in the trade convention at Annapolis. And yet Madison seldom took a  conspicuous part, preferring to remain in the background and to  allow others to appear as the leaders. When the Annapolis Convention  assembled, for example, he suffered Alexander Hamilton of New York to  play the leading role.    Hamilton was then approaching thirty years of age and was one of the  ablest men in the United States. Though his best work was done in  later years, when he proved himself to be perhaps the most brilliant  of American statesmen, with an extraordinary genius for administrative  organization, the part that he took in the affairs of this period was  important. He was small and slight in person but with an expressive  face, fair complexion, and cheeks of \"almost feminine rosiness.\" The  usual aspect of his countenance was thoughtful and even severe, but in  conversation his face lighted up with a remarkably attractive smile. He  carried himself erectly and with dignity, so that in spite of his small  figure, when he entered a room \"it was apparent, from the respectful  attention of the company, that he was a distinguished person.\" A  contemporary, speaking of the opposite and almost irreconcilable traits  of Hamilton's character, pronounced a bust of him as giving a complete  exposition of his character: \"Draw a handkerchief around the mouth of  the bust, and the remnant of the countenance represents fortitude and  intrepidity such as we have often seen in the plates of Roman heroes.  Veil in the same manner the face and leave the mouth and chin only  discernible, and all this fortitude melts and vanishes into almost  feminine softness.\"    Hamilton was a leading spirit in the Annapolis Trade Convention and  wrote the report that it adopted. Whether or not there is any truth in  the assertion of the French charge that Hamilton and others thought  it advisable to disguise their purposes, there is no doubt that the  Annapolis Convention was an all-important step in the progress of  reform, and its recommendation was the direct occasion of the calling of  the great convention that framed the Constitution of the United States.    The recommendation of the Annapolis delegates was in the form of a  report to the legislatures of their respective States, in which they  referred to the defects in the Federal Government and called for \"a  convention of deputies from the different states for the special purpose  of entering into this investigation and digesting a Plan for supplying  such defects.\" Philadelphia was suggested as the place of meeting, and  the time was fixed for the second Monday in May of the next year.    Several of the States acted promptly upon this recommendation and in  February, 1787, Congress adopted a resolution accepting the proposal and  calling the convention \"for the sole and express purpose of revising  the Articles of Confederation and reporting. .. such alterations... as  shall... render the Federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of  Government and the preservation of the Union.\" Before the time fixed for  the meeting of the Philadelphia Convention, or shortly after that  date, all the States had appointed deputies with the exception of New  Hampshire and Rhode Island. New Hampshire was favorably disposed toward  the meeting but, owing to local conditions, failed to act before the  Convention was well under way. Delegates, however, arrived in time to  share in some of the most important proceedings. Rhode Island alone  refused to take part, although a letter signed by some of the prominent  men was sent to the Convention pledging their support.        CHAPTER VI. THE FEDERAL CONVENTION    The body of delegates which met in Philadelphia in 1787 was the  most important convention that ever sat in the United States. The  Confederation was a failure, and if the new nation was to be justified  in the eyes of the world, it must show itself capable of effective  union. The members of the Convention realized the significance of the  task before them, which was, as Madison said, \"now to decide forever  the fate of Republican government.\" Gouverneur Morris, with unwonted  seriousness, declared: \"The whole human race will be affected by the  proceedings of this Convention.\" James Wilson spoke with equal gravity:  \"After the lapse of six thousand years since the creation of the world  America now presents the first instance of a people assembled to weigh  deliberately and calmly and to decide leisurely and peaceably upon  the form of government by which they will bind themselves and their  posterity.\"    Not all the men to whom this undertaking was entrusted, and who were  taking themselves and their work so seriously, could pretend to social  distinction, but practically all belonged to the upper ruling class. At  the Indian Queen, a tavern on Fourth Street between Market and Chestnut,  some of the delegates had a hall in which they lived by themselves.  The meetings of the Convention were held in an upper room of the State  House. The sessions were secret; sentries were placed at the door to  keep away all intruders; and the pavement of the street in front of  the building was covered with loose earth so that the noises of passing  traffic should not disturb this august assembly. It is not surprising  that a tradition grew up about the Federal Convention which hedged it  round with a sort of awe and reverence. Even Thomas Jefferson referred  to it as \"an assembly of demigods.\" If we can get away from the glamour  which has been spread over the work of the Fathers of the Constitution  and understand that they were human beings, even as we are, and  influenced by the same motives as other men, it may be possible to  obtain a more faithful impression of what actually took place.    Since representation in the Convention was to be by States, just as it  had been in the Continental Congress, the presence of delegations from  a majority of the States was necessary for organization. It is a  commentary upon the times, upon the difficulties of travel, and upon the  leisurely habits of the people, that the meeting which had been called  for the 14th of May could not begin its work for over ten days. The 25th  of May was stormy, and only twenty-nine delegates were on hand when  the Convention organized. The slender attendance can only partially be  attributed to the weather, for in the following three months and a half  of the Convention, at which fifty-five members were present at one time  or another, the average attendance was only slightly larger than that  of the first day. In such a small body personality counted for much,  in ways that the historian can only surmise. Many compromises of  conflicting interests were reached by informal discussion outside of  the formal sessions. In these small gatherings individual character was  often as decisive as weighty argument.    George Washington was unanimously chosen as the presiding officer of the  Convention. He sat on a raised platform; in a large, carved, high-backed  chair, from which his commanding figure and dignified bearing exerted  a potent influence on the assembly; an influence enhanced by the formal  courtesy and stately intercourse of the times. Washington was the great  man of his day and the members not only respected and admired him; some  of them were actually afraid of him. When he rose to his feet he was  almost the Commander-in-Chief again. There is evidence to show that  his support or disapproval was at times a decisive factor in the  deliberations of the Convention.    Virginia, which had taken a conspicuous part in the calling of the  Convention, was looked to for leadership in the work that was to be  done. James Madison, next to Washington the most important member of  the Virginia delegation, was the very opposite of Washington in many  respects--small and slight in stature, inconspicuous in dress as in  figure, modest and retiring, but with a quick, active mind and wide  knowledge obtained both from experience in public affairs and from  extensive reading. Washington was the man of action; Madison, the  scholar in politics. Madison was the younger by nearly twenty years,  but Washington admired him greatly and gave him the support of his  influence--a matter of no little consequence, for Madison was the  leading expert worker of the Convention in the business of framing the  Constitution. Governor Edmund Randolph, with his tall figure, handsome  face, and dignified manner, made an excellent impression in the position  accorded to him of nominal leader of the Virginia delegation. Among  others from the same State who should be noticed were the famous  lawyers, George Wythe and George Mason.    Among the deputies from Pennsylvania the foremost was James Wilson, the  \"Caledonian,\" who probably stood next in importance in the convention to  Madison and Washington. He had come to America as a young man just  when the troubles with England were beginning and by sheer ability had  attained a position of prominence. Several times a"]]]
