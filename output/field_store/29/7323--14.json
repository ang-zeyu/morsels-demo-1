[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30850"],[0,"Philippine Mats (#14)"],[1,"American soldiers were stationed in the  vicinity of the town, there grew up a great demand for mats, and the  weavers, taking advantage of their need and their little knowledge of  values in the Philippines, demanded exorbitant prices and received  them. Most of the Basey people spent their time producing mats,  and to a great extent sacrificed quality for quantity. The grade  of mat that sold for P18 several years ago can now be bought for  about P8; that which sold for P3 two years ago can be bought to-day  for P2. Lately there has been a rise in price owing to increased  commercial demand. Mats made to order, particularly special mats, cost  more than those bought already woven, the price depending upon the  size of the article, the character of the design, and the fineness of  the straw and the weave. A mat two meters by one meter, made of the  finest grade of tikug, would require several months for completion  and would probably cost between P30 and P40. There is hardly a limit  to the size of the mat which can be woven. Three years ago one having  dimensions of 10 meters by 12 meters was made for a church, as many  as 30 women working on it at the same time.    Basey mats are of two general kinds: those with plaid designs woven in  and those on which the designs are embroidered. The former are the more  difficult to weave; but as there is no decoration to be added, they  are the cheapest mats obtainable, the prices for the ordinary grades  ranging from P0.80 to P3 each. Some weavers turn out only blank mats  of one color and do neither designing nor decorating. Straw used on  these is usually dyed, very few mats of natural colors being made. They  are worth from P0.50 to P2 each and are generally sold to girls who  are skillful in embroidering designs. These girls decorate the mats  and sell them for from P2.50 to P6 each, the price depending upon the  original cost of the mat and the amount of decoration put upon it. The  ideas for the designs on Basey mats are usually obtained from pictures  or textiles. The straws, both bleached and dyed, are split in two  for embroidering purposes. This makes them thinner and more pliable.    The time necessary for making a plaid mat sold for two pesos was  found to be as follows, an eight-hour day being used as the basis of  a day's work:                                                           Days.          Gathering tikug                                1.00          Dyeing tikug                                    .25          Flattening tikug                                .25          Weaving mat                                    3.50                                                         ----          Total time                                     5.00      The selling price of the mat was one peso, the cost of the dye 15  centavos, which left the weaver a balance of 85 centavos for five days'  labor. The plaids used in Basey mats are simple, but the embroidered  designs are extremely intricate. They consist for the most part of  foliage, flowers, and animals. Weavers are often given a contract to  make a stated number of mats in accordance with a design furnished  them. A few are capable of reproducing almost any pattern presented,  [29] but if they are not told exactly what colors to use they employ  every shade, color and tint they can secure. The Basey mats are  distinguished by the multitude of colors used. In general it may be  stated that the chief criticism of this product is the gaudy effect  produced by the colors used. In some cases the colors are well toned  and harmoniously combined, but the majority of the mats produced  contain vivid colors which are not all harmonious. Through the schools,  efforts have been made to reduce the number of colors and to modify the  gaudy and complicated floral designs. An improvement is seen each year.    The ordinary mat is usually about 2 meters by 1 1/2 meters, though  smaller and larger ones are made. During the past three years  the weavers have been encouraged to make mats about the size of an  ordinary cot and to use no more than two colors in weaving them. A  few mats suitable for placing under dining tables are also made.    Sulat weavers produce fewer mats than those of Basey but make them of  fine, closely woven straw. Most of the mats with a woven-on border  come from Sulat. These people, while able to produce a fine, soft,  pliable mat, can not embroider decorations on them nearly so well as  do the people of Basey.    Samar mats wear well. Wall mats last indefinitely and sleeping mats  are used from two to ten years or more. [30]        The Marketing of Basey Mats.    The port of Tacloban, Leyte, due to its proximity to Basey, is the  chief center for the distribution of Samar mats. As soon as the mats  are completed the weavers take them across the straits to Tacloban,  where they are sold to Chinese brokers, transients and residents,  both American and native. Few ships leave Tacloban that do not carry  away from 5 to 20 mats; often they take away as many as 50, the amount  generally depending upon the number of passengers aboard the boat. Some  of the ship's employees are regular customers of the weavers and buy  mats at stated prices to sell them again at a reasonable profit at  Manila and other ports of call. Besides, there is quite a sale of mats  in the towns of Samar, Leyte, and Cebu through vendors, residents of  Basey, who secure the mats in their home town at low prices and sell  them at a profit. These persons usually deal only in the mats, and sell  them for cash, not trading for other articles. Plaid Basey mats are  on sale in nearly all the Chinese general merchandise stores of Manila.    As yet there is little supervision by brokers in Basey. The  mat industry there needs but the introduction of some system of  supervision by brokers to regulate the size, quality, design and  color scheme of the mats, and a foreign market to become a much more  extended industry. The schools have already done much toward improving  workmanship and design; it must remain for individual enterprise,  however, to get in touch with foreign demand and supervise the weaving  of mats to suit it. [31]        Bohol Mats. [32]    Tikug mats are made in large numbers in Bohol. The straw for the most  part is finer than that used in Samar and the patterns are chiefly  stripes and checks. Very little embroidering is attempted.    Bohol mats are used principally for sleeping purposes. In northern  Bohol there is scarcely a family that has not three or more large  mats, which are rolled up and laid away during the day time and are  unrolled upon the floor at night for a bed. They are durable and  last for years. Large sleeping mats may be purchased in quantities  as high as 40 to 100 during the Sunday market day in Talibon or on  the Saturday market day in Ypil, a barrio of the same town. In price  they range from one to three pesos each.    The second use of Bohol mats is for decorating walls, tables, and  floors. Those so employed are smaller than the sleeping mats, usually  square, but sometimes round. More care is exercised in their weaving  and only fine young straws are used. The preparation of the straw  and the dyeing are done with great care. Mats of the best quality  are quite difficult to secure and the schools have recently been  encouraging their production.    As in other regions, the tikug from which Bohol mats are made, grows  wild in the rice fields after the harvest. It is found in abundance  in northern Bohol in the municipalities of Getafe, Talibon and Ubay,  and sparingly in other towns of the island (see map). The straws  are gathered from the field by pulling them, thus breaking them off  at the roots, and they are tied into bundles about 3 decimeters  in circumference and sold in the market. The largest market for  such bundles is found in the barrio of Ypil in the municipality of  Talibon. The price is usually about 10 centavos per bundle. From two  to four of these bundles are required to make a mat.    The tikug is not kept in the original bundles longer than one or  two days, for it will turn black. The material is usually separated  into two parts, one to be dyed, the other to be bleached. That to be  dyed is spread in the sun and thoroughly dried for one or two days,  care being taken that rain does not fall upon it and blacken it. The  other part is boiled in a solution of acetic acid for twenty minutes,  after which it is thoroughly dried in the sun and thus bleached.    The natural dyes used in Bohol for coloring tikug are dauda and  turmeric. The former produces permanent colors, the latter fugitive  ones. The artificial dyes bought at Chinese stores are also used  in producing shades and tints of green, violet and ruby which are  satisfactory. In general, those in crystal form have proven more  satisfactory than the powder dyes. Before dyeing, the sheath-like leaf  is pulled from the bottom of each straw and the material is looped  into small bundles. Often the straws are dampened with water. Dyeing  is usually done in a 5-gallon petroleum can two-thirds full of water,  heated to boiling. If the artificial dyes are used the powder is  stirred in and dissolved and the bundles of tikug are then pressed  down into the liquid so that all the material is well covered. A stone  is often laid upon the straws so as to keep them down in the boiling  dye. It usually requires about twenty minutes to obtain the desired  shade, which is nearly always a deep one. Where fresh dauda leaves  are employed, about 2 pounds are placed in the water and boiled a few  minutes before the tikug is put in. If dried leaves are used about one  pound is soaked in cold water for a few minutes and the whole mass  is then added to the boiling water. Turmeric roots are pounded in a  mortar and then added to the boiling water, after which the tikug is  added. All the dyes noted are combined to produce other "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30889"],[0,"The Mechanism of the Human Voice (#14)"],[1," action or inaction of the  pyramids determines the break between the Lower Thick and the Upper  Thick, as they are cartilages--_i.e._, pieces of gristle--and cannot,  therefore, by any vibrations of their own assist in the production of  tone. The tension of the vocal ligaments increases as we sing up the  scale until the ring-shield aperture has quite disappeared. But while it  remains so closed, and without the vocal ligaments being any further  stretched, we can yet sing higher still. The gradations of tone are now  no longer formed by the action of the ring-shield muscles (see p. 34),  but by the shield-pyramid muscles which press the vocal ligaments more  and more closely together, until at last scarcely any trace of a slit  remains between them. Another result of this action of the  shield-pyramid muscles must also be to narrow the space _below_ the  vocal chink, which, as we know from the experiments of J. Mueller, has  the effect of raising the pitch of tones. I think it very likely,  therefore, that the change from the lower to the upper thick is really  brought about by the shield-pyramid muscles coming into play after the  ring-shield muscles have done their share.      THE THIN REGISTER.    \"All the tones of the thin register are produced by vibrations only of  the fine, inner, slender edges of the vocal ligaments. In this action  the vocal ligaments are not so near together, but allow of a fine linear  space between them, and the pocket ligaments are pressed further back  than in the production of the tones of the thick register. The rest of  the action of the glottis is, however, entirely the same. With the  beginning of the thin register at F[#] [Illustration: musical notation]  the whole vocal chink appears again longer, and the vocal ligaments are  much looser than in the highest tones of the thick register. The united  action, already described, of the pyramids and the vocal ligaments in  forming the deeper tones of the thin register, extends to C, C[#]  [Illustration: musical notation] in the female voice, and in the male  voice to E[b], E [Illustration: musical notation] commonly written thus,  E[b], E [Illustration: musical notation] but which only rarely occurs in  composition, and then is sung by tenors as I have given it; that is, one  octave lower.    \"With the C[#] [Illustration: musical notation] in the female voice, and  the E[b], E [Illustration: musical notation] in the male voice, the  pyramids cease again to act, and, as before, in the Upper Thick, leave  the formation of the sounds to the vocal ligaments alone, which at this  change appear again longer and looser, but with every higher tone  tighten up to F, F[#] [Illustration: musical notation] in the female  voice, and in the male voice to G [Illustration: musical notation] or as  it is commonly written, [Illustration: musical notation]. In the thin  register the voicebox preserves its natural position as in quiet  breathing.\"    I must say here that I have never had any very clear conception of  Madame Seiler's meaning when she speaks of the action or inaction of the  pyramids in the formation of the registers. In the lower thick register  there is, as a rule, a small triangular space between them which gets  gradually smaller as the tones ascend, until it is quite closed in the  upper thick. Dr. Merkel, also, has made the same observation. So far,  therefore, we are agreed. But even of this I can find no trace in the  thin register, where I have always noticed that the pyramids are quite  close together. On this point, my assertion is borne out by Dr. Merkel,  who insists upon the same thing. I also demur to Madame Seiler's  statement that in this register again the vocal ligaments relax at the  beginning of the upper division, and I invite the reader to test the  matter by reference to the ring-shield aperture. The evidence furnished  by this experiment is conclusive, because the vocal ligaments cannot  possibly relax without a corresponding enlargement of the ring-shield  aperture. A very striking illustration of this occurs during the  transition from the Upper Thick to the Lower Thin. During the highest  tones of the Upper Thick, when the tension of the vocal ligaments is  greatest, the ring-shield aperture, as we have seen before, completely  closes, while immediately opening very widely during the lowest tones of  the Lower Thin, when the vocal ligaments are quite relaxed. Nothing of  the kind takes place during the change either from the Lower Thin to the  Upper Thin, or from the Lower Thick to the Upper Thick. It appears to me  that Madame Seiler has rather exaggerated the importance of these minor  breaks, while she does not make enough of the great break between the  Upper Thick and the Lower Thin. If there is straining anywhere, it is  during the attempt to carry the mechanism of the Upper Thick beyond its  natural limit. In this case the tension of the vocal ligaments, as  indeed of all surrounding parts, becomes so tremendous that at last the  whole thing looks as though it were literally going to fly to pieces in  every direction. Now change into the Lower Thin, and the relief is  wonderful. Let tenors make a note of this. If they _will_ violate  Nature, they must pay the penalty!    As regards the transition from the Lower Thin to the Upper Thin, I would  suggest the following explanation:--The vocal chink is at first, as  Madame Seiler says, linear, and the gradations of tone are caused by  simple tension of the vocal ligaments, which is proved by the diminution  of the ring-shield aperture. While this goes on we are in the Lower  Thin. Now the laryngoscope reveals another method of still further  raising the pitch, which consists in a gradual shortening of the vocal  chink. This is caused by the shield-pyramid muscles pressing together  the ends of the vocal ligaments, thereby giving the vocal chink a  slightly elliptic shape. When this mechanism comes into play we are in  the Upper Thin.      THE SMALL REGISTER.    \"When in the observation of the thin register I had sung upwards to its  highest tones, and then sang still higher, I became aware, with the F[#]  [Illustration: musical notation] of a change in the motions of the  organ of singing, and the tones thus produced had a different _timbre_  from those of the Thin. It required long and patient practice before I  finally succeeded in drawing forward the lid so that I could see the  glottis in its whole length. Not until then was I able to observe the  following: With the F[#] [Illustration: musical notation] the vocal  ligaments suddenly closed firmly together to their middle, with their  fine edges one over the other. This closing appeared as a fine red line  extending, from the pyramids at the back, forward to the middle of the  vocal ligaments, and leaving free only a third part of the whole  glottis, immediately under the lid, to the front wall of the voicebox.           *       *       *       *       *    \"The foremost part of the glottis formed an oval orifice, which, with  every higher tone, seemed to contract more and more, and so became  smaller and rounder. The fine edges of the vocal ligaments which formed  this orifice were alone vibrating, and the vibrations seemed at first  looser, but, with every higher tone, the ligaments were more stretched.\"           *       *       *       *       *    I have repeatedly had the opportunity of observing the mechanism of the  small register, and I only differ from Madame Seiler in this, that I did  not notice that \"with every higher tone the ligaments were more  stretched.\" It appeared to me, on the contrary, as though the raising of  the pitch was produced by a contraction of the vocal ligaments. In all  other respects I entirely agree with the above description. According to  Madame Seiler the small register is formed by the action of the wedges,  as described on p. 54.    We have thus become acquainted with the mechanism of the registers of  the human voice. We have also seen that it is possible to carry these up  beyond their natural limits, though the process is accompanied by  visible signs of straining. The practice of teachers, therefore, whose  aim it is to \"extend\" voices upwards, and who are very proud, especially  in tenors, of their \"made tones,\" is strongly to be condemned, and is  sure to have disastrous results. It is, on the other hand, equally  possible to carry the registers down several tones below the places  called the breaks, so that at the limits of each register there are a  number of tones which may be produced by two different mechanisms. The  carrying down of a register causes no fatigue, and though its volume is  weak as compared with the corresponding lower register, it is surprising  how soon it can, by judicious practice, be made to acquire fulness and  power.    In order to prevent misunderstandings, it may be well to add that the  breaks as indicated in the preceding pages are intended only to show  the average compass in the great majority of voices. As, for instance,  there are basses who have an exceptional extension of the Lower Thick  downwards, so there are, undoubtedly, tenors who have an exceptional  extension of the Upper Thick upwards. It must, therefore, be the voice  trainer's business very carefully to ascertain the exact limits of the  registers in every single case. In choral singing, however, where  individual attention is impossible, the breaks as given above may be  implicitly relied upon. Not only should the registers never be carried  above these points, but if the teacher is wise he will insist upon his  pupils forming the habit of changing the mechanism a tone or two below.    NEVER \"EXTEND\" LOWER REGISTERS UPWARDS, BUT STRENGTHEN THE UPPER  REGISTERS, AND CARRY THEM DOWNWARDS, THUS EQUALIZING THE VOICES FROM TOP  TO BOTTOM, AND ENABLING YOUR PUPILS TO SING WITHOUT STRAINING. That is  the great lesson taught by the investigations described in "]]]
