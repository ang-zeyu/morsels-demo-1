To assist him in the management of his craft, the Pirate has under him  an engineer and a Dutch lad. The former of these has, of course, his  special duties; the latter is cook and steward, sailor, landing-agent,  and general utility man. He goes by the name of \"The Crew.\" To beguile  the tedium and monotony of constant voyaging, \"The Crew\" is wont to  exercise his mind by conversation with such passengers as there may be.  He is of a very inquiring disposition, and asks leading questions of a  very personal nature. Seeing that I am a new-chum, he begins to ask me  my name, age, birthplace, who my parents were, where I formerly lived,  what I did, what my cousins and aunts are, their names, and all about  them, and so on, a series of interminable catechetical questions on  subjects that, one would think, could not possibly have any interest for  him. This would be gross impertinence, were it not that \"The Crew\" is  perfectly unconscious of giving any offence. He only asks for  information, like Rosa Dartle; and this questioning is his idea of  polite sociability.    Among the points of interest about the _Lily_, the most noticeable are  the engines with which she is supplied. These are fearfully and  wonderfully contrived. How such rusty, battered, old-fashioned,  rough-and-ready machinery can be got to work at all, it is hard to say;  but it does. Of course the engines are continually breaking down, or  bursting, or doing something or other offensive. But whatever may  happen, the Pirate and his two aids consider themselves equal to the  emergency, and make shift to tinker up the mishap somehow. Such unlooked  for examples of misapplied force are constantly occurring, the  consequence being that repairs are as often called for. Thus it is that  the engines present a very extraordinary and uncommon appearance. Report  has, perhaps, added somewhat to the truth, but numerous legends are  current in the Kaipara about the _Lily_, her engines, and her captain.    These amateur artificers are not in the least particular as to the  materials they use for effecting their repairs, nor are they given to  considering the relative differences of the metals. On one occasion,  rust had eaten a hole through the boiler, and leakage ensued. Promptly  they set to work, and soldered the lid of a biscuit-tin over the weak  place. Then the boat went on as usual.    Once again, so it is said, something or other gave way--some screw, or  cock, or lever failed to act. The boat became unmanageable, could not be  stopped, or slowed, or done anything with. In short, she ran away. But  Pirate Tom was not to be imposed on by any such feeble tricks. He  immediately steered the _Lily_ slap into the nearest bank and tied her  up to a tree. Then the three went on shore, with a bottle of rum and a  pack of cards, and sat down at a respectful distance to await the  progress of events, and to enjoy a game of cut-throat euchre.    The engineer bet Pirate Tom a note--colonial for a sovereign--that the  engines would blow up, and the latter laid on the chance that the rebel  craft would spend herself kicking at the bank. After churning up the  mud, plunging at the bank, and straining at her tether for an hour or  so, the _Lily_ quieted down, all her steam having worked off. So the  Pirate won and pocketed the engineer's note; and then the party  adjourned on board again, to resume their ordinary avocation of  tinkering up.    In the log of the _Lily_ there is supposed to be an entry, which would  seem to indicate that the Pirate is not invariably so lucky as on the  last-mentioned occasion. It is his rule never to spend any more money on  repairs than what cannot possibly be avoided. There was an unsafe  steam-pipe, which might easily have been replaced at a trifling cost;  but, of course, the Pirate would spend nothing on it, and relied on his  own usual resources. One day the steam-pipe burst, when a number of  passengers were on board, and a woman got her legs scalded. After that,  the Pirate found it absolutely necessary to get a new steam pipe; and  was, besides, heavily mulcted in an action brought against him by the  injured lady. The entry referred to probably runs like this:--                                                      L  s.  d.    To a new steam-pipe                             0  10   0    To fine and costs                               3  12   6    To damages awarded to Mrs. ---- by the Court    5   0   0    To doctor's fees for attendance on Mrs. ----    4   0   0    On the whole, Pirate Tom did not take much by his economy on that  occasion. But the lesson was not of any lasting use. He will go on in  his old way, and will take his chance of accidents.    The defects of the _Lily_ do not cause us any annoyance, on this  occasion of our first voyage aboard of her. She is on her best  behaviour, for a wonder, and neither breaks down, nor bursts up, nor  runs away. We steam over a great stretch of the harbour, noticing here  that strange effect, when the distant land seems to be lifted above the  horizon, and to have a belt of sky between it and the water.    Then we pass into river after river, proceeding up each some miles, to  the townships, or stations, where we have to call, then descending into  the harbour again, only to go on to the entrance of yet another river.  The scenery is very varied, and there is much in it to attract our  regard. Sometimes we pass below lofty bluffs, by wild rocky shores and  islets, sometimes along great stretches of mud-bank or mangrove swamp.    The land on all sides is a primitive wilderness for the most part. Range  after range sweeps and rolls away, while ravines and gullies and basins  open upon the rivers, with tumbling creeks or graceful cascades pouring  through them. One might suppose that some giant of yore had ploughed out  this country and left it. A newly-ploughed field must seem, to an ant's  vision, something like the contour of this to ours.    The land is richly wooded. Here and there we see the heavy bush, mammoth  trees soaring up, overhung with creepers and ferns; but the heavy bush  is chiefly at some distance from the waterside. What we see most of here  is the light bush; dense thickets of shrubs, and smaller trees,  resembling our remembrance of the denes and copses of England, or Epping  and the New Forest.    To us new-chums it seems absurd to call this bush \"light,\" but we can  see that it is so by comparison with the primeval forest, where the  tree-trunks run from ten to forty feet in girth. Once upon a time, when  they numbered millions, the Maoris inhabited these shores pretty  thickly. They preferred to be near the water, as settlers do now, for  the same reason of convenience in communication, and also because fish  was a chief article of their diet. All the land near the rivers has been  at some time under their cultivation, and the light bush has grown up  upon it since.    So late as fifty years ago, the Ngatewhatua tribe, who were lords of the  Kaipara, were very numerous; but were then nearly exterminated in a war  with the Ngapuhi of the north. Still, numerous as they may have been  then, they could not have held the immense tracts here under  cultivation. That must date from a more remote period. But the places  where their villages stood, in the early part of this century, are now  buried under such a wealth of scrub and shrubbery, as to show very  clearly how rich is the soil and how fruitful the climate.    We see at last what we have long been looking for, hitherto to no  purpose, namely, Maoris and their habitations. Brown, gypsey-like people  they appear in the distance, wearing ordinary clothes like Europeans,  only dirty and ragged usually. Here and there we pass a cluster of their  whares, low down near the beach--brown huts of thatch-like appearance,  for they are made of raupo grass. Some of them are very neat, with  carved and painted doors and fronts. Near them is usually some fenced-in  cultivation, and possibly a rough-grassed clearing, on which may be a  few cattle or horses. There are always pigs and dogs visible, and brown  naked children disporting themselves on the beach, where canoes are  drawn up, fishing nets spread out, and a scaffolding erected to dry  shark-meat upon.    Few and far between are these evidences of the native race, and few and  far between, also, are evidences of the new nation that is supplanting  it. Frere, the statesman, speaking of Spain, said--he loved it because  God had so much land there in His own holding. If he could say that of  Spain's bare sierras and bleak barrancas, what would he not have said of  this land, whose splendid woods and forests clothe the hills and fill  the glens with verdure.    Here and there we lie off some settler's station, a white wooden  homestead, perhaps with a few outbuildings beside it, perhaps alone;  round it the pastures won by the axe and the fire, a mere bite out of  the boundless woods behind. At such places \"The Crew\" paddles ashore in  the dingey, or possibly a boat comes off to us, bearing two or three  bushmen, who, may be, think that the opportunity for getting a nobbler  ought not to be suffered to pass by.    We have three or four townships to call at, places where the Government  has set aside a certain tract of land for a future town. A township site  is cut up--on paper--into allotments, which are sold, or kept in the  Land Office until wanted. From what we see of the Kaipara towns, they  are very much in embryo as yet. Te Otamatea, for instance, is a single  house and nothing more. This is our ideal of a bush settlement; it is as  it should be--not too much humanity and crowd. The house, a rambling,  wooden building, is of a good size though, being an hotel and store.  Round it are several hundred acres of grass. Sometimes it is very  festive, for a large Maori kainga is not far off;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29084"],[0,"The Cook and Housekeeper's Complete and Universal Dictionary; Including a System (#14)"],[1,"will be fit for use in a  fortnight; but it is not calculated for keeping, especially in warm  weather. Beer brewed in this way will not cost one halfpenny a pint. An  agreeable table beer may be made ready for drinking in three or four  days, consisting of treacle and water, fermented with a little yeast.  Boil six or seven gallons of water, pour it on the same quantity of cold  water in a cask, and a gallon of treacle. Stir them well together; and  when the fermentation is abated, close the bung-hole in the usual way. A  little of the outer rind of an orange peel infused into the beer, and  taken out as soon as it has imparted a sufficient degree of bitterness,  will give it an agreeable flavour, and assist in keeping the beer from  turning sour. A little gentian root boiled in the water, either with or  without the orange peel, will give a wholesome and pleasant bitter to  this beer. A small quantity, by way of experiment, may be made thus. To  eight quarts of boiling water, put one ounce of treacle, a quarter of  an ounce of ginger, and two bay leaves. Let the whole boil a quarter of  an hour; then cool and work it with yeast, the same as other beer.  Another way to make a cheap malt liquor is to take a bushel of malt,  with as much water and hops as if two bushels of malt were allowed in  the common way, and put seven pounds of the coarsest brown sugar into  the boiling wort. This makes a very pleasant liquor; is as strong, and  will keep as long without turning sour or flat, as if two bushels had  been employed. Twenty gallons of good beer may be made from a bushel of  malt, and three quarters of a pound of hops, if care be taken to extract  all their goodness. For this purpose boil twenty-four gallons of water,  and steep the malt in it for three hours: then tie up the hops in a hair  cloth, and boil malt, hops, and wort, all together for three quarters of  an hour, which will reduce it to about twenty gallons. Strain it off,  and set it to work when lukewarm. See BREWING.--As however it does not  suit some persons to brew, in any way whatever, it may be necessary to  add a few brief remarks on the distinguishing qualities of sound beer,  that persons may know what it is they purchase, and how far their health  may be affected by it. Wholesome beer then ought to be of a bright  colour, and perfectly transparent, neither too high nor too pale. It  should have a pleasant and mellow taste, sharp and agreeably bitter,  without being hard or sour. It should leave no pungent sensation on the  tongue; and if drank in any tolerable quantity, it must neither produce  speedy intoxication, nor any of the usual effects of sleep, nausea,  headache, or languor; nor should it be retained too long after drinking  it, or be too quickly discharged. If beer purchased at the alehouse be  suspected of having been adulterated with the infusion of vitriol, for  the purpose of adding to its strength, it may be detected by putting in  a few nut galls, which will immediately turn it black, if it have been  so adulterated; and the beer ought by all means to be rejected, as  highly injurious to the constitution, and may be fatal even to life  itself.      BEES. A hive of bees may be considered as a populous city, containing  thirty thousand inhabitants. This community is in itself a monarchy,  composed of a queen, of males which are the drones, and of working bees  called neuters. The combs being composed of pure wax, serve as a  magazine for their stores, and a nursery for their young. Between the  combs there is a space sufficient for two bees to march abreast, and  there are also transverse defiles by which they can more easily pass  from one comb to another.--The queen bee is distinguishable from the  rest by the form of her body. She is much longer, unwieldy, and of a  brighter colour, and seldom leaves the parent hive; but when she goes to  settle a new colony, all the bees attend her to the place of  destination. A hive of bees cannot subsist without a queen, as she  produces their numerous progeny; and hence their attachment to her is  unalterable. When a queen dies, the bees immediately cease working,  consume their honey, fly about at unusual times, and eventually pine  away, if not supplied with another sovereign. The death of the queen is  proclaimed by a clear and uninterrupted humming, which should be a  warning to the owner to provide the bees if possible with another queen,  whose presence will restore vigour and exertion; of such importance is a  sovereign to the existence and prosperity of this community. It is  computed that a pregnant queen bee contains about five thousand eggs,  and that she produces from ten to twelve thousand bees in the space of  two months.--Drones are smaller than the queen, but larger than the  working bees, and when on the wing they make a greater noise. Their  office is to impregnate the eggs of the queen after they are deposited  in the cells; but when this is effected, as they become useless to the  hive, they are destroyed by the working bees and thrown out; and having  no sting, they are without the power of resistance. After the season of  the encrease of the bees is past, and when they attend to the collection  of winter stores, every vestige of the drones is destroyed to make room  for the honey. When drones are observed in a hive late in autumn, it is  usually a sign that the stock is poor.--Working bees compose the most  numerous body of the state. They have the care of the hive, collect the  wax and honey, fabricate the wax into combs, feed the young, keep the  hive clean, expel all strangers, and employ themselves in promoting the  general prosperity. The working bee has two stomachs, one to contain the  honey, and another for the crude wax. Among the different kinds of  working bees, those are to be preferred which are small, smooth, and  shining, and of a gentle disposition.--Considering the rich productions  of these little insects, and the valuable purposes to which they may be  applied, it is truly astonishing that so important an object in rural  economy has been so little attended to by the inhabitants of this  country. In Egypt, the cultivation of bees forms a leading object, and  their productions constitute a part of its riches. About the end of  October, when sustenance cannot be provided for them at home, the  inhabitants of Lower Egypt embark their bees on the Nile, and convey  them to the distant regions of Upper Egypt, when the inundation is  withdrawn, and the flowers are beginning to bud. These insects are thus  conducted through the whole extent of that fertile country; and after  having gathered all the rich produce of the banks of the Nile, are  re-conducted home about the beginning of February. In France also,  floating bee-hives are very common. One barge contains from sixty to a  hundred hives, which are well defended from the inclemency of the  weather. Thus the owners float them gently down the stream, while they  gather the honey from the flowers along its banks, and a little  bee-house yields the proprietors a considerable income. At other times  they convey bees by land, to places where honey and wax may be  collected. The hives are fastened to each other by laths placed on a  thin packcloth, which is drawn up on each side and tied with packthread  several times round their tops. Forty or fifty hives are then laid in a  cart, and the owner takes them to distant places where the bees may feed  and work. But without this labour the industrious bee might be  cultivated to great advantage, and thousands of pounds weight of wax and  honey collected, which now are suffered to be wasted on the desert air,  or perish unheeded amidst the flowers of the field.--Those whose  attention may be directed to the subject by these remarks, and who  intend to erect an apiary, should purchase the stocks towards the close  of the year, when bees are cheapest; and such only as are full of combs,  and well furnished with bees. To ascertain the age of the hives it  should be remarked, that the combs of the last year are white, while  those of the former year acquire a darkish yellow. Where the combs are  black, the hive should be rejected as too old, and liable to the inroads  of vermin. In order to obtain the greatest possible advantage from the  cultivation of bees, it is necessary to supply them with every  convenience for the support of themselves and their young. And though it  may be too much trouble to transport them to distant places, in order  to provide them with the richest food, and to increase their abundant  stores; yet in some instances this plan might in part be adopted with  considerable success. It has been seen in Germany, as well as in other  parts of the continent, that forty large bee hives have been filled with  honey, to the amount of seventy pounds each, in one fortnight, by their  being placed near a large field of buck wheat in flower; and as this and  various other plants adapted to enrich the hive are to be found in many  parts of England, there is no reason why a similar advantage might not  be derived from such an experiment.--Besides providing for them the  richest food in summer, in order to facilitate their labours, it is  equally necessary to attend to their preservation in the winter. To  guard against the effects of cold, the bees should be examined during  the winter; and if instead of being clustered between the combs, they  are found in numbers at the bottom of the hive, they should be carried  to a warmer place, where they will soon recover. In very severe seasons,  lay on the bottom of an old cask the depth of half a foot of fine earth  pressed down hard; place the stool on this with the hive, and cut a hole  in the cask opposite to the entrance of the hive, in which fix a piece  of reed or hollow elder, and then cover the whole with dry earth. This  will preserve a communication with the external air, and at the same"]]]
