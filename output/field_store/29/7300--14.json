There he  was well protected from the owl by an impenetrable prickly roof, while  he could readily elude, by diving, any stray creature attacking him from  land.    Winter dragged slowly on its course, and, just as the first prophecy of  spring was breathed by the awakening woodlands, the warm west breezes  ceased to blow, and the bleak north wind moaned drearily among the  trees. Night after night a sheet of ice spread and thickened from the  shallows to the edge of the current, the wild ducks came down to the  river from the frost-bound moors, and great flocks of geese, whistling  loudly in the starlit sky, passed on their southward journey to the  coast.    For the first few nights Brighteye left his chamber only when acute  hunger drove him to his storehouse in the wood. Directly he had fed, he  returned home, and settled once more to sleep. At last his supplies were  exhausted, and he was forced to subsist almost entirely on the pith  beneath the bark of the willows. The pond by the hedgerow was sealed  with ice, and he suffered much from the lack of his customary food.  Half-way between his sleeping chamber and its water-entrance, a floor of  ice prevented ready access to the river; and, under this floor, a  hollow, filled with air, was gradually formed as the river receded from  the level it had reached on the first night of frost. Brighteye's only  approach to the outer world was, therefore, through the upper doorway.  All along the margin of the pool, as far as the swift water beyond the  stakes, the ice-shelf was now so high above the river that even to a  large animal like the otter it offered no landing place. Only at the  stakes, where the dark, cold stream flowed rapidly between two blocks of  ice, could Brighteye enter or leave the river. Partly because, if he  should be pursued, the swiftness of the stream was likely to lessen his  chances of escape, and partly because of a vague but ever-present  apprehension of danger, he avoided this spot. It was fortunate that he  did so; Lutra, knowing well the ways of the riverside people, often  lurked in hiding under the shelf of ice beyond the stakes, and, when she  had gone from sight, the big, gaunt trout came slyly from his refuge by  the boulder and resumed his tireless scrutiny of everything that passed  his \"hover.\" At last a thaw set in, and Brighteye, awakening on the  second day from his noontide sleep, heard the great ice-sheet crack, and  groan, and fall into the river.    When darkness came he hurried to the water's brink, and, almost reckless  with delight, plunged headlong into the pool. He tucked his fore-paws  beneath his chin, and, with quick, free strokes of his hind-legs, dived  deep to the very bottom of the backwater. Thence he made a circle of the  little bay, and, floating up to the arch before his dwelling, sought the  inner entrance, where, however, the ice had not yet melted. He dived  once more, and gained the outer entrance in the front of the buttress,  but there, also, the ice was thick and firm. He breathed the cold, damp  air in the hollow beneath the ice, then glided out and swam to land. The  tiny specks of dirt, which, since the frost kept him from the river, had  matted his glossy fur, seemed now completely washed away, and he felt  delightfully fresh and vigorous as he sat on the grass, and licked and  brushed each hair into place. His toilet completed, he ran gaily up the  bank to his storehouse under the tree, but only to find it empty. Not in  the least disheartened, he climbed the rabbit-track, rustled over the  hedge-bank to the margin of the pond, and there, as in the nights before  the frost, feasted eagerly on duckweed and watercress. On the following  day the ice melted in the shaft below his chamber, and he was thus saved  the trouble of tunnelling a third water-passage--as a ready means of  escape from the otter and the big trout, as well as from a chance weasel  or stoat--which, if the ice had not disappeared, he surely would have  made as soon as his vigour was fully restored.          V.    THE COURAGE OF FEAR.      The dawn, with easy movement, comes across the eastern hills; the mists  roll up from steaming hollows to a cloudless sky; the windows of a  farm-house in the dingle gleam and sparkle with the light. So came the  fair, unhesitating spring; so rolled the veil of winter's gloom away; so  gleamed and sparkled with responsive greeting every tree and bush and  flower in the awakened river valley. The springs and summers of our life  are few, yet in each radiant dawn and sunrise they may, in brief, be  found.    Filled with the restlessness of springtide life--a restlessness felt by  all wild creatures, and inherited by man from far distant ages when,  depending on the hunt for his sustenance, he followed the migrations of  the beasts--Brighteye often left his retreat much earlier in the  afternoon than had been his wont, and stole along the river-paths even  while the sunshine lingered on the crest of the hill and on the ripples  by the stakes below the pool.    Prompted by an increasing feeling of loneliness and a strong desire that  one of his kindred should share with him his comfortable home, he  occupied much of his time in enlarging the upper chamber of the burrow  till it formed a snug, commodious sleeping place ceiled by the twisted  willow-roots; and, throwing the soil behind him down the shaft, he  cleared the floor till it was smooth and level. Then he boldly sallied  forth, determined to wander far in search of a mate rather than remain a  bachelor. He proceeded down-stream beside the trout-reach, and for a  long time his journey was in vain. He heard a faint plash on the surface  of the water, and at once his little heart beat fast with mingled hope  and fear; but the sound merely indicated that the last of winter's  withered oak-leaves, pushed gently aside by a swelling bud, had fallen  from the bough. Suddenly, from the ruined garden above him on the brow  of the slope, came the dread hunting cry of his old enemy, the tawny  owl. Even as the first weird note struck with far-spreading resonance on  the silence of the night, all longing and hope forsook the vole.  Realising only that he was in a strange place far from home, and exposed  to many unknown dangers, he sat as moveless as the pebbles around him,  till, from a repetition of the cry, he learned that the owl was  departing into the heart of the wood. Then, silently, he journeyed  onward. Further and still further--past the rocky shelf where he had  landed after his escape from the salmon, and into a region honeycombed  with old, deserted rat-burrows, and arched with prostrate trees and  refuse borne by flood--he ventured, his fear forgotten in the strength  of his desire.    Close beside the river's brink, as the shadows darkened, he found the  fresh scent of a female vole. He followed it eagerly, through shallow  and whirlpool and stream, to a spit of sand among some boulders, where  he met, not the reward of his labour and longing, but a jealous admirer  of the dainty lady he had sought to woo. After the manner of their kind  in such affairs, the rivals ruffled with rage, kicked and squealed as  if to declare their reckless bravery, and closed in desperate battle.  Their polished teeth cut deeply, and the sand was furrowed and pitted by  their straining feet. Several times they paused for breath, but only to  resume the fight with renewed energy. The issue was, however, at last  decided. Brighteye, lying on his back, used his powerful hind-claws with  such effect that, when he regained his footing, he was able, almost  unresisted, to get firm hold of his tired opponent, and to thrust him,  screaming with pain and baffled rage, into the pool.    The female vole had watched the combat from a recess in the bank; and,  when the victor returned from the river, she crept out trustfully to  meet him, and licked his soiled and ruffled fur. But for the moment  Brighteye was not in a responsive mood. Though his body thrilled at the  touch of her warm, soft tongue, he recognised that his first duty was to  make his conquest sure. His strength had been taxed to the utmost, and,  since his rage was expended and his tiny wounds were beginning to smart,  he feared a second encounter and the possible loss of his lady-love.  So, with simulated anger, he drove her before him along the up-stream  path and into the network of deserted run-ways by the trout-reach. There  his mood entirely changed; and soon, in simple, happy comradeship, he  led her to his home.    Brighteye was a handsome little fellow. At all times he had been careful  in his toilet, but now, pardonably vain, he fastidiously occupied every  moment of leisure in brushing and combing his long, fine, soft fur. Both  in appearance and habits he was altogether different from the  garbage-loving rat. His head was rounder and blunter than the rat's, his  feet were larger and softer, and his limbs and his tail were shorter. On  the under side his feet were of a pale pink colour, but on the upper  side they were covered, like the field-vole's, with close, stiff hair  set in regular lines from the toes to the elbows of the front limbs and  to the ankles of the hind-legs, where the long, fine fur of the body  took its place. A slight webbing crossed the toes of his hind-feet--so  slight, indeed, that it assisted him but little in swimming--and his  tiny, polished claws were plum-coloured. Except when he was listening  intently for some sign of danger, his small, round ears were almost  concealed in his thick fur. His mate was of smaller and more delicate  build--this was especially noticeable when once I saw her swim with  Brighteye through the clear water beneath the bank--and she was clad in  sombre brown and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29362"],[0,"The Goat-gland Transplantation (#14)"],[1,"hold her at the point she has now  reached. Frankly, this is pure experiment. I do not know. After another  ten years of work in this gland-surgery I might be able to give her a  definite opinion, but not at this stage, seeing that my oldest cases go  back only three years. On one point only I can speak with positiveness,  namely, if I cannot answer this question there is no man living who can  answer it, because I am the only man alive who can give an opinion on  this work that is founded on first-hand knowledge. We learn in this work  only by experience, and we draw just conclusions only from +quantity+ of  experience. No other man alive has had this experience in sufficient  quantity to justify him in forming a conclusion derived from his facts.  This is my answer not only to those who listen to encouraging advice  regarding the effects of this operation tendered by surgeons who are  embarking in this goat-gland operation, but also to those general  practitioners who inform patients asking their opinion in the matter  that the operation is useless because the glands are certain to slough,  I hold that they are not qualified to speak on the subject because they  have no knowledge. I have the most positive knowledge that when the  operation is rightly performed the glands do NOT slough, and my  knowledge is founded upon the hard facts of much experience. In another  ten years I shall know more than I know today because I shall have added  to my facts, and among those facts there may be some which confirm the  hope of the woman of forty alluded to above that this gland  transplantation may hold the condition of youth steady as something  static, which will not be suffered to pass. At present I do not know,  and if I offer an opinion it is to be understood that it is only a  guess. My guess, then, would be that in this case the operation would be  a waste, producing no effect whatever, neither adding to nor detracting  from the condition of health and normal function which is present today.                 *       *       *       *       *             *       *       *       *    The One Best Way Series of New Thought Books.
