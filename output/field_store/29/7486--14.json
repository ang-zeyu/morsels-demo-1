A  mere hyphen upon the broad, white page, lay the Western-bound train.  The fires in the locomotives (there were two of them), had been  suffered to go out, and the great creatures waited silently together,  left alone in the storm, while the snow drifted higher and higher upon  their patient backs.    When Bob had waked that morning to find the tempest more furious than  ever and the train stuck fast in a huge snow-bank, his first thought  was of dismay at the possible detention in the narrow limits of the  Pullman, which seemed much colder than it had before; his next was to  wonder how the change of fortune would affect Gertrude Raymond. Of  course he had long ago become acquainted with the brown traveling suit  and fur collar. Of course there had been numberless little services  for him to perform for her and the old gentleman, who had indeed  proved to be her father. Bob had already begun to dread the end of the  journey. He had gone to his berth the night before, wishing that San  Francisco were ten days from Boston, instead of six. Providence having  taken him at his word, and indicated that the journey would be of at  least that duration, if not more, he was disposed, like no few of his  fellow-mortals, to grumble.    Once more he became misanthropic. \"There's Miss Raymond, now,\" he  growled to himself, knocking his head savagely against the upper berth  in his attempt to look out through the frosty pane, \"sitting over  across the aisle day after day with her kid gloves, and all that. Nice  enough, of course,\" recalling one or two spirited conversations where  hours had slipped by like minutes, \"but confoundedly useless, like the  rest of 'em. If she were like mother, now, there'd be no trouble.  She'd take care of herself. But as it is, the whole car will be turned  upside down for her to-day, for fear she'll freeze, or starve, or  spoil her complexion, or something.\"    Here Bob turned an extremely cold shoulder on the window, and having  performed a sort of horizontal toilet, emerged from his berth, his  hair on end, and his face expressive of utter defiance to the world in  general, and contempt of fashionable young ladies in particular.    At that moment Miss Raymond appeared in the aisle, sweet and rosy as a  June morning, her cheeks glowing, and her eyes sparkling with fun.    \"Good-morning, Mr. Estabrook,\" she said demurely, settling the fur  collar about her neck.    Bob endeavored to look dignified, and was conscious of failure.    \"Good-mo-morning,\" he replied with some stiffness, and a shiver which  took him by surprise. It _was_ cold, jumping out of that warm berth.    \"I understand we must stay--but don't let me detain you,\" she added  with a sly glance at his hair.    Bob turned and marched off solemnly to the masculine end of the car,  washed in ice-water, completed his toilet, and came back refreshed.  Breakfast was formally served as usual, and then a council of war was  held. Conductor, engineers and brakemen being consulted, and  inventories taken, it was found that while food was abundant, the  stock of wood in the bins would not last till noon. There were twelve  railroad men and thirty-five passengers on board, some twenty of the  latter being immigrants in a second-class behind the two Pullmans.    The little company gathered in the snow-bound car looked blankly at  each other, some of them instinctively drawing their wraps more  tightly about their shoulders, as if they already felt the approaching  chill.    It was miles to the nearest station in either direction. Above, below,  on all sides, was the white blur of tumultuous, wind-lashed snow.    The silence was broken pleasantly. Once more Bob felt the power of  those clear, sweet tones.    \"The men must make up a party to hunt for wood,\" she said. \"While  you're gone, we women will do what we can for those who are left.\"    The necessity for immediate action was evident, and without further  words the council broke up, to obey her suggestion.    A dozen men, looking like amateur Esquimaux, and floundering up to  their armpits at the first step, started off through the drifts. One  of the train-men, who knew the line of the road thoroughly, was sure  they must be near a certain clump of trees where plenty of wood could  be obtained. Taking the precaution to move in single line, one of the  engineers, a broad-shouldered six-footer, leading the way, and  steering by compass, they were soon out of sight. As they struck off  at right angles to the track, Bob thought he recognized a face pressed  close to the pane and watching them anxiously; but he could not be  sure.    Two hours later the men appeared once more, some staggering under huge  logs, some with axes, some with bundles of lighter boughs for  kindling. In another five minutes smoke was going up cheerily from the  whole line of cars; for the trees had proved to be less than a quarter  of a mile distant, and the supply would be plentiful before night.    When Bob Estabrook stamped into his own car, hugging up a big armful  of wood, he was a different looking fellow from the trim young lawyer  who was wont to stand before the jury seats in the Boston Court House.  He had on a pair of immense blue yarn mittens, loaned by a kindly  brakeman, his face was scratched with refractory twigs, his eyebrows  were frosted, his mustache an icy caret, two fingertips frozen, and  with all this, he looked and felt more manly than ever before in his  life.    His eye roved through the length of the car as it had that first night  in the depot. She was not there. He was as anxious as a boy for her  praise.    \"Guess I'll take it into the next car,\" he said apologetically to the  nearest passenger; \"there's more coming, just behind.\"    She was not in the second Pullman. Of course she wasn't in the  baggage-car. Was it possible--? He entered the third and last car,  recoiling just a bit at the odor of crowded and unclean poverty which  met him at the door.    Sure enough, there she sat--his idle, fashionable type of  inutility--with one frowsy child upon the seat beside her, two very  rumpled-looking boys in front, and in her arms a baby with terra-cotta  hair. Somehow, the baby's hair against the fur collar didn't look so  badly as you would expect, either. She seemed to be singing it to  sleep, and kept on with her soft crooning as she glanced up over its  tangled red locks at snowy Bob and his armful of wood, with a look in  her eyes that would have sent him cheerfully to Alaska for more, had  there been need.      III    With the comfortable heat of the fires, the kind offices of nearly all  the well-dressed people to the poorer ones--for they were not slow,  these kid-gloved Pullman passengers, to follow Miss Raymond's  example--the day wore on quietly and not unpleasantly toward its  close. Then some one suddenly remembered that it was Christmas Eve.    \"Dear me!\" cried Miss Raymond, delightedly, reaching round the baby to  clap her hands; \"let's have a Christmas party!\"    A few sighed and shook their heads, as they thought of their own home  firesides; one or two smiled indulgently on the small enthusiast;  several chimed in at once. Conductor and baggage-master were  consulted, and the spacious baggage-car \"specially engaged for the  occasion,\" the originator of the scheme triumphantly announced.  Preparations commenced without delay. All the young people put their  heads together in one corner, and many were the explosions of laughter  as the programme grew. Trunks were visited by their owners and small  articles abstracted therefrom to serve as gifts for the immigrants and  train-men, to whose particular entertainment the evening was by common  consent to be devoted.    Just as the lamps were lighted in the train, our hero, who had  disappeared early in the afternoon, returned dragging after him a  small, stunted pine tree, which seemed to have strayed away from its  native forests on purpose for the celebration. On being admitted to  the grand hall, Bob further added to the decorations a few strings of  a queer, mossy sort of evergreen. Hereupon a very young man with light  eyebrows, who had hitherto been inconspicuous, suddenly appeared from  the depths of a battered trunk, over the edge of which he had for some  time been bent like a siphon, and with a beaming face produced a box  of veritable, tiny wax candles! He was \"on the road,\" he explained,  for a large wholesale toy-shop, and these were samples. He guessed he  could make it all right with the firm.    Of course the affair was a great success. I have no space to tell of  the sheltered walk that Bob constructed of rugs, from car to car; of  the beautified interior of the old baggage-car, draped with shawls and  brightened with bits of ribbon; of the mute wonder of the poor  immigrants, a number of whom had just arrived from Germany, and could  not speak a word of English; of their unbounded delight when the  glistening tree was disclosed, and the cries of \"_Weihnachtsbaum!  Weihnachtsbaum!_\" from their rumpled children, whose faces waked into  a glow of blissful recollection at the sight. Ah! if you could have  seen the pretty gifts; the brave little pine (which all the managers  agreed couldn't possibly have been used had it been an inch taller);  the improvised tableaux, wherein Bob successively personated an  organ-grinder, a pug dog, and Hamlet, amid thunders of applause from  the brakemen and engineers! Then the passengers sang a simple  Christmas carol, Miss Raymond leading with her pure soprano, and Bob  chiming in like the diapason of an organ.    Just as the last words died away a sudden hush came over the audience.  Could it be an illusion, or did they hear the muffled but sweet notes  of a church bell faintly sounding without? Tears came into the eyes of  some of the roughest of the immigrants as they listened, and thought  of a wee belfry somewhere"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4320"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (#14)"],[1,"ws, and are moved by the same objects.    Why do philosophers infer, with the greatest certainty, that the moon is  kept in its orbit by the same force of gravity, that makes bodies fall  near the surface of the earth, but because these effects are, upon  computation, found similar and equal? And must not this argument bring  as strong conviction, in moral as in natural disquisitions?    To prove, by any long detail, that all the qualities, useful to  the possessor, are approved of, and the contrary censured, would be  superfluous. The least reflection on what is every day experienced in  life, will be sufficient. We shall only mention a few instances, in  order to remove, if possible, all doubt and hesitation.    The quality, the most necessary for the execution of any useful  enterprise, is discretion; by which we carry on a safe intercourse with  others, give due attention to our own and to their character, weigh each  circumstance of the business which we undertake, and employ the  surest and safest means for the attainment of any end or purpose. To a  Cromwell, perhaps, or a De Retz, discretion may appear an alderman-like  virtue, as Dr. Swift calls it; and being incompatible with those vast  designs, to which their courage and ambition prompted them, it might  really, in them, be a fault or imperfection. But in the conduct of  ordinary life, no virtue is more requisite, not only to obtain success,  but to avoid the most fatal miscarriages and disappointments. The  greatest parts without it, as observed by an elegant writer, may be  fatal to their owner; as Polyphemus, deprived of his eye, was only the  more exposed, on account of his enormous strength and stature.    The best character, indeed, were it not rather too perfect for  human nature, is that which is not swayed by temper of any kind; but  alternately employs enterprise and caution, as each is useful to the  particular purpose intended. Such is the excellence which St. Evremond  ascribes to Mareschal Turenne, who displayed every campaign, as he grew  older, more temerity in his military enterprises; and being now, from  long experience, perfectly acquainted with every incident in war, he  advanced with greater firmness and security, in a road so well known to  him. Fabius, says Machiavel, was cautious; Scipio enterprising: And  both succeeded, because the situation of the Roman affairs, during the  command of each, was peculiarly adapted to his genius; but both would  have failed, had these situations been reversed. He is happy, whose  circumstances suit his temper; but he is more excellent, who can suit  his temper to any circumstances.    What need is there to display the praises of industry, and to extol its  advantages, in the acquisition of power and riches, or in raising what  we call a FORTUNE in the world? The tortoise, according to the fable, by  his perseverance, gained the race of the hare, though possessed of  much superior swiftness. A man's time, when well husbanded, is like a  cultivated field, of which a few acres produce more of what is useful to  life, than extensive provinces, even of the richest soil, when over-run  with weeds and brambles.    But all prospect of success in life, or even of tolerable subsistence,  must fail, where a reasonable frugality is wanting. The heap, instead  of increasing, diminishes daily, and leaves its possessor so much more  unhappy, as, not having been able to confine his expences to a large  revenue, he will still less be able to live contentedly on a small one.  The souls of men, according to Plato [Footnote: Phaedo.], inflamed with  impure appetites, and losing the body, which alone afforded means of  satisfaction, hover about the earth, and haunt the places, where their  bodies are deposited; possessed with a longing desire to recover the  lost organs of sensation. So may we see worthless prodigals, having  consumed their fortune in wild debauches, thrusting themselves into  every plentiful table, and every party of pleasure, hated even by the  vicious, and despised even by fools.    The one extreme of frugality is avarice, which, as it both deprives a  man of all use of his riches, and checks hospitality and every social  enjoyment, is justly censured on a double account. PRODIGALITY, the  other extreme, is commonly more hurtful to a man himself; and each of  these extremes is blamed above the other, according to the temper of the  person who censures, and according to his greater or less sensibility to  pleasure, either social or sensual.    Qualities often derive their merit from complicated sources. Honesty,  fidelity, truth, are praised for their immediate tendency to promote the  interests of society; but after those virtues are once established upon  this foundation, they are also considered as advantageous to the person  himself, and as the source of that trust and confidence, which can alone  give a man any consideration in life. One becomes contemptible, no less  than odious, when he forgets the duty, which, in this particular, he  owes to himself as well as to society.    Perhaps, this consideration is one CHIEF source of the high blame, which  is thrown on any instance of failure among women in point of CHASTITY.  The greatest regard, which can be acquired by that sex, is derived from  their fidelity; and a woman becomes cheap and vulgar, loses her rank,  and is exposed to every insult, who is deficient in this particular. The  smallest failure is here sufficient to blast her character. A female  has so many opportunities of secretly indulging these appetites, that  nothing can give us security but her absolute modesty and reserve; and  where a breach is once made, it can scarcely ever be fully repaired.  If a man behave with cowardice on one occasion, a contrary conduct  reinstates him in his character. But by what action can a woman, whose  behaviour has once been dissolute, be able to assure us, that she has  formed better resolutions, and has self-command enough to carry them  into execution?    All men, it is allowed, are equally desirous of happiness; but few  are successful in the pursuit: One considerable cause is the want of  strength of mind, which might enable them to resist the temptation of  present ease or pleasure, and carry them forward in the search of more  distant profit and enjoyment. Our affections, on a general prospect of  their objects, form certain rules of conduct, and certain measures of  preference of one above another: and these decisions, though really  the result of our calm passions and propensities, (for what else can  pronounce any object eligible or the contrary?) are yet said, by a  natural abuse of terms, to be the determinations of pure REASON and  reflection. But when some of these objects approach nearer to us, or  acquire the advantages of favourable lights and positions, which  catch the heart or imagination; our general resolutions are frequently  confounded, a small enjoyment preferred, and lasting shame and sorrow  entailed upon us. And however poets may employ their wit and eloquence,  in celebrating present pleasure, and rejecting all distant views to  fame, health, or fortune; it is obvious, that this practice is the  source of all dissoluteness and disorder, repentance and misery. A man  of a strong and determined temper adheres tenaciously to his general  resolutions, and is neither seduced by the allurements of pleasure, nor  terrified by the menaces of pain; but keeps still in view those distant  pursuits, by which he, at once, ensures his happiness and his honour.    Self-satisfaction, at least in some degree, is an advantage, which  equally attends the fool and the wise man: But it is the only one; nor  is there any other circumstance in the conduct of life, where they are  upon an equal footing. Business, books, conversation; for all of these,  a fool is totally incapacitated, and except condemned by his station  to the coarsest drudgery, remains a useless burthen upon the earth.  Accordingly, it is found, that men are extremely jealous of their  character in this particular; and many instances are seen of profligacy  and treachery, the most avowed and unreserved; none of bearing patiently  the imputation of ignorance and stupidity. Dicaearchus, the Macedonian  general, who, as Polybius tells us [Footnote: Lib. xvi. Cap. 35.],  openly erected one altar to impiety, another to injustice, in order to  bid defiance to mankind; even he, I am well assured, would have started  at the epithet of FOOL, and have meditated revenge for so injurious an  appellation. Except the affection of parents, the strongest and most  indissoluble bond in nature, no connexion has strength sufficient to  support the disgust arising from this character. Love itself, which  can subsist under treachery, ingratitude, malice, and infidelity, is  immediately extinguished by it, when perceived and acknowledged; nor  are deformity and old age more fatal to the dominion of that passion.  So dreadful are the ideas of an utter incapacity for any purpose or  undertaking, and of continued error and misconduct in life!    When it is asked, whether a quick or a slow apprehension be most  valuable? Whether one, that, at first view, penetrates far into a  subject, but can perform nothing upon study; or a contrary character,  which must work out everything by dint of application? Whether a  clear head or a copious invention? Whether a profound genius or a sure  judgement? In short, what character, or peculiar turn of understanding,  is more excellent than another? It is evident, that we can answer  none of these questions, without considering which of those qualities  capacitates a man best for the world, and carries him farthest in any  undertaking.    If refined sense and exalted sense be not so USEFUL as common sense,  their rarity, their novelty, and the nobleness of their objects make  some compensation, and render them the admiration of mankind: As gold,  though "]]]
