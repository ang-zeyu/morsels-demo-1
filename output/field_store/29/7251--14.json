Arrived at  Versailles, they stopped at the Fleur-de-lys inn, but there the sickness  which the boy had complained of during the journey became very serious,  and the innkeeper, having young children, and believing that he  recognised symptoms of smallpox, which just then was ravaging  Versailles, refused to receive them, saying he had no vacant room. This  might have disconcerted anyone but Derues, but his audacity, activity,  and resource seemed to increase with each fresh obstacle. Leaving  Edouard in a room on the ground floor which had no communication with  the rest of the inn, he went at once to look for lodgings, and hastily  explored the town. After a fruitless search, he found at last, at the  junction of the rue Saint-Honore with that of the Orangerie, a cooper  named Martin, who had a furnished room to spare. This he hired at thirty  sous per day for himself and his nephew, who had been taken suddenly  ill, under the name of Beaupre. To avoid being questioned later, he  informed the cooper in a few words that he was a doctor; that he had  come to Versailles in order to place his nephew in one of the offices of  the town; that in a few days the latter's mother would arrive to join  him in seeing and making application to influential persons about the  court, to whom he had letters of introduction. As soon as he had  delivered this fable with all the appearance of truth with which he knew  so well how to disguise his falsehoods, he went back to the young de  Lamotte, who was already so exhausted that he was hardly able to drag  himself as far as the cooper's house. He fainted on arrival, and was  carried into the hired room, where Derues begged to be left alone with  him, and only asked for certain beverages which he told the people how  to prepare.    Whether it was that the strength of youth fought against the poison, or  that Derues took pleasure in watching the sufferings of his victim, the  agony of the poor lad was prolonged until the fourth day. The sickness  continuing incessantly, he sent the cooper's wife for a medicine which  he prepared and administered himself. It produced terrible pain, and  Edouard's cries brought the cooper and his wife upstairs. They  represented to Derues that he ought to call in a doctor and consult with  him, but he refused decidedly, saying that a doctor hastily fetched  might prove to be an ignorant person with whom he could not agree, and  that he could not allow one so dear to him to be prescribed for and  nursed by anyone but himself.    \"I know what the malady is,\" he continued, raising his eyes to heaven;  \"it is one that has to be concealed rather than acknowledged. Poor  youth! whom I love as my own son, if God, touched by my tears and thy  suffering, permits me to save thee, thy whole life will be too short for  thy blessings and thy gratitude!\" And as Madame Martin asked what this  malady might be, he answered with hypocritical blushes--    \"Do not ask, madame; there are things of which you do not know even the  name.\"    At another time, Martin expressed his surprise that the young man's  mother had not yet appeared, who, according to Derues, was to have met  him at Versailles. He asked how she could know that they were lodging in  his house, and if he should send to meet her at any place where she was  likely to arrive.    \"His mother,\" said Derues, looking compassionately at Edouard, who lay  pale, motionless, and as if insensible,--\"his mother! He calls for her  incessantly. Ah! monsieur, some families are greatly to be pitied! My  entreaties prevailed on her to decide on coming hither, but will she  keep her promise? Do not ask me to tell you more; it is too painful to  have to accuse a mother of having forgotten her duties in the presence  of her son . . . there are secrets which ought not to be told--unhappy  woman!\"    Edouard moved, extended his arms, and repeated, \"Mother! . . . mother!\"    Derues hastened to his side and took his hands in his, as if to warm  them.    \"My mother!\" the youth repeated. \"Why have I not seen her? She was to  have met me.\"    You shall soon see her, dear boy; only keep quiet.\"    \"But just now I thought she was dead.\"    \"Dead!\" cried Derues. \"Drive away these sad thoughts. They are caused by  the fever only.\"    \"No! oh no! . . . I heard a secret voice which said, 'Thy mother is  dead!' . . . And then I beheld a livid corpse before me . . . It was  she! . . . I knew her well! and she seemed to have suffered so much----\"    \"Dear boy, your mother is not dead . . . . My God! what terrible  chimeras you conjure up! You will see her again, I assure you; she has  arrived already. Is it not so, madame?\" he asked, turning towards the  Martins, who were both leaning against the foot of the bed, and signing  to them to support this pious falsehood, in order to calm the young man.  \"Did she not arrive and come to his bedside and kiss him while he slept,  and she will soon come again?\"    \"Yes, yes,\" said Madame Martin, wiping her eyes; \"and she begged my  husband and me to help your uncle to take great care of you--\"    The youth moved again, and looking round him with a dazed expression,  said, \"My uncle--?\"    \"You had better go,\" said Derues in a whisper to the Martins. \"I am  afraid he is delirious again; I will prepare a draught, which will give  him a little rest and sleep.\"    \"Adieu, then, adieu,\" answered Madame Martin; \"and may Heaven bless you  for the care you bestow on this poor young man!\"    On Friday evening violent vomiting appeared to have benefited the  sufferer. He had rejected most of the poison, and had a fairly quiet  night. But on the Saturday morning Derues sent the cooper's little girl  to buy more medicine, which he prepared, himself, like the first. The  day was horrible, and about six in the evening, seeing his victim was at  the last gasp, he opened a little window overlooking the shop and  summoned the cooper, requesting him to go at once for a priest. When the  latter arrived he found Derues in tears, kneeling at the dying boy's  bedside. And now, by the light of two tapers placed on a table, flanking  the holy water-stoup, there began what on one side was an abominable and  sacrilegious comedy, a disgraceful parody of that which Christians  consider most sacred and most dear; on the other, a pious and consoling  ceremony. The cooper and his wife, their eyes bathed in tears, knelt in  the middle of the room, murmuring such prayers as they could remember.    Derues gave up his place to the priest, but as Edouard did not answer  the latter's questions, he approached the bed, and bending over the  sufferer, exhorted him to confession.    \"Dear boy,\" he said, \"take courage; your sufferings here will be counted  to you above: God will weigh ahem in the scales of His infinite mercy.  Listen to the words of His holy minister, cast your sins into His bosom,  and obtain from Him forgiveness for your faults.\"    \"I am in such terrible pain!\" cried Edouard. \"Water! water! Extinguish  the fire which consumes me!\"    A violent fit came on, succeeded by exhaustion and the death-rattle.  Derues fell on his knees, and the priest administered extreme unction.  There was then a moment of absolute silence, more impressive than cries  and sobs. The priest collected himself for a moment, crossed himself,  and began to pray. Derues also crossed himself, and repeated in a low  voice, apparently choked by grief    \"Go forth, O Christian soul, from this world, in the name of God the  Father Almighty, who created thee; in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son  of the living God, who suffered for thee; in the name of the Holy Ghost,  who was poured out upon thee.\"    The youth struggled in his bed, and a convulsive movement agitated his  limbs. Derues continued--    \"When thy soul departs from this body may it be admitted to the holy  Mountain of Sion, to the Heavenly Jerusalem, to the numerous company of  Angels, and to the Church of the First-born, whose names are written in  Heaven----\"    \"Mother! . . . My mother!\" cried Edouard. Derues resumed--    \"Let God arise, and let the Powers of Darkness be dispersed! let the  Spirits of Evil, who reign over the air, be put to flight; let them not  dare to attack a soul redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ.\"    \"Amen,\" responded the priest and the Martins.    There was another silence, broken only by the stifled sobs of Derues.  The priest again crossed himself and took up the prayer.    \"We beseech Thee, O beloved and only Son of God, by the merits of Thy  sacred Passion, Thy Cross and Thy Death, to deliver this Thy servant  from the pains of Hell, and to lead him to that happy place whither Thou  didst vouchsafe to lead the thief, who, with Thee, was bound upon the  Cross: Thou, who art God, living and reigning with the Father and the  Holy Ghost.\"    \"Amen,\" repeated those present. Derues now took up the prayer, and his  voice mingled with the dying gasps of the sufferer.    \"And there was a darkness over all the earth----    \"To Thee, O Lord, we commend the soul of this Thy servant, that, being  dead to the world, he may, live to Thee: and the sins he hath committed  through the frailty of his mortal nature, do Thou in Thy most merciful  goodness, forgive and wash away. Amen.\"    After which all present sprinkled holy water on the body....    When the priest had retired, shown out by Madame Martin, Derues said to  her husband--    \"This unfortunate young man has died without the consolation of  beholding his mother.... His last thought was for her.... There now  remains the last duty, a very painful one to accomplish, but my poor  nephew imposed it on me. A few hours ago, feeling that his end was near,  he asked me, as a last mark of friendship, not to entrust these final  duties to the hands of strangers.\"    While he applied himself to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2749"],[0,"La Constantin (#14)"],[1,"to conceal from everyone. To Angelique  herself, it is true, the position was not new, and she felt neither  grief nor shame, regarding the coming event as a means of making her  future more secure by forging a new link in the chain which bound the  duke to her. But he, sure that but for himself Angelique would never  have strayed from virtue's path, could not endure the thought of her  losing her reputation and becoming an object for scandal to point her  finger at; so that Angelique, who could not well seem less careful of  her good name than he, was obliged to turn his song of woe into a duet,  and consent to certain measures being taken.    One evening, therefore, shortly before Maitre Quennebert's marriage, the  fair lady set out, ostensibly on a journey which was to last a fortnight  or three weeks. In reality she only made a circle in a post-chaise round  Paris, which she re-entered at one of the barriers, where the duke  awaited her with a sedan-chair. In this she was carried to the very  house to which de Jars had brought his pretended nephew after the duel.  Angelique, who had to pay dearly for her errors, remained there only  twenty-four hours, and then left in her coffin, which was hidden in a  cellar under the palace of the Prince de Conde, the body being covered  with quicklime. Two days after this dreadful death, Commander de Jars  presented himself at the fatal house, and engaged a room in which he  installed the chevalier.    This house, which we are about to ask the reader to enter with us, stood  at the corner of the rue de la Tixeranderie and the rue Deux-Portes.  There was nothing in the exterior of it to distinguish it from any  other, unless perhaps two brass plates, one of which bore the words  MARIE LEROUX-CONSTANTIN, WIDOW, CERTIFIED MIDWIFE, and the other CLAUDE  PERREGAUD, SURGEON. These plates were affixed to the blank wall in the  rue de la Tixeranderie, the windows of the rooms on that side looking  into the courtyard. The house door, which opened directly on the first  steps of a narrow winding stair, was on the other side, just beyond the  low arcade under whose vaulted roof access was gained to that end of the  rue des Deux-Portes. This house, though dirty, mean, and out of repair,  received many wealthy visitors, whose brilliant equipages waited for  them in the neighbouring streets. Often in the night great ladies  crossed its threshold under assumed names and remained there for several  days, during which La Constantin and Claude Perregaud, by an infamous  use of their professional knowledge, restored their clients to an  outward appearance of honour, and enabled them to maintain their  reputation for virtue. The first and second floors contained a dozen  rooms in which these abominable mysteries were practised. The large  apartment, which served as waiting and consultation room, was oddly  furnished, being crowded with objects of strange and unfamiliar form. It  resembled at once the operating-room of a surgeon, the laboratory of a  chemist and alchemist, and the den of a sorcerer. There, mixed up  together in the greatest confusion, lay instruments of all sorts,  caldrons and retorts, as well as books containing the most absurd  ravings of the human mind. There were the twenty folio volumes of  Albertus Magnus; the works of his disciple, Thomas de Cantopre, of  Alchindus, of Averroes, of Avicenna, of Alchabitius, of David de  Plaine-Campy, called L'Edelphe, surgeon to Louis XIII and author of the  celebrated book The Morbific Hydra Exterminated by the Chemical  Hercules. Beside a bronze head, such as the monk Roger Bacon possessed,  which answered all the questions that were addressed to it and foretold  the future by means of a magic mirror and the combination of the rules  of perspective, lay an eggshell, the same which had been used by Caret,  as d'Aubigne tells us, when making men out of germs, mandrakes, and  crimson silk, over a slow fire. In the presses, which had sliding-doors  fastening with secret springs, stood Jars filled with noxious drugs, the  power of which was but too efficacious; in prominent positions, facing  each other, hung two portraits, one representing Hierophilos, a Greek  physician, and the other Agnodice his pupil, the first Athenian midwife.    For several years already La Constantin and Claude Perregaud had carried  on their criminal practices without interference. A number of persons  were of course in the secret, but their interests kept them silent, and  the two accomplices had at last persuaded themselves that they were  perfectly safe. One evening, however, Perregaud came home, his face  distorted by terror and trembling in every limb. He had been warned  while out that the suspicions of the authorities had been aroused in  regard to him and La Constantin. It seemed that some little time ago,  the Vicars-General had sent a deputation to the president of the chief  court of justice, having heard from their priests that in one year alone  six hundred women had avowed in the confessional that they had taken  drugs to prevent their having children. This had been sufficient to  arouse the vigilance of the police, who had set a watch on Perregaud's  house, with the result that that very night a raid was to be made on it.  The two criminals took hasty counsel together, but, as usual under such  circumstances, arrived at no practical conclusions. It was only when the  danger was upon them that they recovered their presence of mind. In the  dead of night loud knocking at the street door was heard, followed by  the command to open in the name of the king.    \"We can yet save ourselves!\" exclaimed surgeon, with a sudden flash of  inspiration.    Rushing into the room where the pretended chevalier was lying, he called  out--    \"The police are coming up! If they discover your sex you are lost, and  so am I. Do as I tell you.\"    At a sign from him, La Constantin went down and opened the door. While  the rooms on the first floor were being searched, Perregaud made with a  lancet a superficial incision in the chevalier's right arm, which gave  very little pain, and bore a close resemblance to a sword-cut. Surgery  and medicine were at that time so inextricably involved, required such  apparatus, and bristled with such scientific absurdities, that no  astonishment was excited by the extraordinary collection of instruments  which loaded the tables and covered the floors below: even the titles of  certain treatises which there had been no time to destroy, awoke no  suspicion.    Fortunately for the surgeon and his accomplice, they had only one  patient--the chevalier--in their house when the descent was made. When  the chevalier's room was reached, the first thing which the officers of  the law remarked were the hat, spurred boots, and sword of the patient.  Claude Perregaud hardly looked up as the room was invaded; he only made  a sign to those--who came in to be quiet, and went on dressing the  wound. Completely taken in, the officer in command merely asked the name  of the patient and the cause of the wound. La Constantin replied that  it' was the young Chevalier de Moranges, nephew of Commander de Jars,  who had had an affair of honour that same night, and being sightly  wounded had been brought thither by his uncle hardly an hour before.  These questions and the apparently trustworthy replies elicited by them  being duly taken down, the uninvited visitors retired, having discovered  nothing to justify their visit.    All might have been well had there been nothing the matter but the wound  on the chevalier's sword-arm. But at the moment when Perregaud gave it  to him the poisonous nostrums employed by La Constantin were already  working in his blood. Violent fever ensued, and in three days the  chevalier was dead. It was his funeral which had met Quennebert's  wedding party at the church door.    Everything turned out as Quennebert had anticipated. Madame Quennebert,  furious at the deceit which had been practised on her, refused to listen  to her husband's justification, and Trumeau, not letting the grass grow  under his feet, hastened the next day to launch an accusation of bigamy  against the notary; for the paper which had been found in the nuptial  camber was nothing less than an attested copy of a contract of marriage  concluded between Quennebert and Josephine-Charlotte Boullenois. It was  by the merest chance that Trumeau had come on the record of the  marriage, and he now challenged his rival to produce a certificate of  the death of his first wife. Charlotte Boullenois, after two years of  marriage, had demanded a deed of separation, which demand Quennebert had  opposed. While the case was going on she had retired to the convent of  La Raquette, where her intrigue with de Jars began. The commander easily  induced her to let herself be carried off by force. He then concealed  his conquest by causing her to adopt male attire, a mode of dress which  accorded marvellously well with her peculiar tastes and rather masculine  frame. At first Quennebert had instituted an active but fruitless search  for his missing wife, but soon became habituated to his state of  enforced single blessedness, enjoying to the full the liberty it brought  with it. But his business had thereby suffered, and once having made the  acquaintance of Madame Rapally, he cultivated it assiduously, knowing  her fortune would be sufficient to set him straight again with the  world, though he was obliged to exercise the utmost caution and reserve  in has intercourse with her, as she on her side displayed none of these  qualities. At last, however, matters came to such a pass that he must  either go to prison or run the risk of a second marriage. So he  reluctantly named a day for the ceremony, resolving to leave Paris with  Madame Rapally as soon as he had settled with his creditors.    In the short interval which ensued, and while Trumeau was hugging the  knowledge of"]]]
