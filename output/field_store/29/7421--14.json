Direct correlation exists between growth rate and average monthly  precipitation in the season of growth (April to September) (Fig. 12).  In nine of eleven years, the curve for growth rate followed the trend  of the curve for precipitation; but because other climatic conditions  also influenced growth, the fluctuations in the two curves were not  proportional to one another.    Grasshoppers form an important element in the diet of box turtles.  Smith (1954) traced the relative abundance of grasshoppers over a  period of 100 years in Kansas, and this information is of significance  for comparison with data concerning growth of box turtles. In general,  the growth index was higher when favorable weather and large  populations of grasshoppers occurred in the same year.    In the following summary, the numbers (1 to 5) used to express the  relative abundance of grasshoppers are from Smith (_op. cit._). Maxima  and minima refer to the twelve-year period, 1943-1954. The growth  index for each year (shown as a graph in Fig. 12) appears in brackets  and indicates the percentage of normal growth attained by all turtles  in that year.    _Years Favorable for Growth_    =1954= [126.3]: Growth was better than average for turtles of all  ages. Grasshopper populations were highest (4+) since 1948.  Continuously warm weather, beginning in the last few days of March,  permitted emergence in the first week of April; thereafter conditions  were more or less continuously favorable for activity until late  October. Although there was less than an inch of precipitation in  September, precipitation in August and October was approximately twice  normal and more or less evenly distributed. Warm weather in early  November permitted an additional two weeks of activity.    =1945= [125.5]: This was the second most favorable year for growth and  the second wettest year. Records of growth are all from young turtles  (one to four years old), all of which grew more than average. Daily  maximum temperatures higher than 60 degrees Fahrenheit on 18 of the  last 19 days of March, combined with twice the normal amount of  precipitation in the same period, stimulated early emergence. August  and October were both dry (each with less than one inch of  precipitation) but diurnal temperatures remained warm through the  first week in November and probably prolonged activity of box turtles  at least until then. Grasshoppers were more abundant (3.7) than  normal.    _Years Unfavorable for Growth_    =1944= [83.1]: This was the poorest growing year for the period  considered. The lack of a continuously warm, wet period in early  spring probably delayed emergence until the last week in April.  Temperatures remained warm enough for activity until early November,  but dry weather in September and October probably curtailed activity  for inducing long periods of quiescence; most of the precipitation  that occurred in the latter two months fell in a one-week period  beginning in the last few days of September. Grasshopper populations  were higher (4.0) than normal.    =1953= [85.6]: This was the second poorest growing year and the driest  year in the period considered. Intermittently cold weather in spring  delayed emergence until the last week in April when nearly an inch of  rain fell. Temperatures were higher than normal from June to October.  The period from September to the end of October was dry and the small  amount of precipitation that occurred was concentrated chiefly at the  beginning and end of that period. Temperatures in late October and  early November were lower than normal. Grasshopper populations were  low (2.2).    =1952= [88.3]: Environmental conditions were poor for growth and much  like the conditions described for 1953. In both years growth was much  less than normal in turtles of all ages except for one group (adults  that were 10 and 11 years old in 1952 and 1953, respectively) that was  slightly below normal in 1952 and slightly above normal in 1953.    The small number of records for 1955 were not considered in Figure  12. Warm weather in the last half of March lengthened the growing  season, and environmental conditions, as in 1954, were more or less  favorable throughout the rest of the summer; 1955 probably ranks with  1954 as an exceptionally good year for growth of box turtles.    Although the number of records available for turtles hatched in the  period from 1950 to 1954 is small, a few records are available for all  these years except 1951. In general, small samples of turtles hatched  in these years reflect only the difficulty of collecting hatchlings  and juveniles. In 1951, conditions for incubation and hatching were  poor and the lack of records for that year actually represents a high  rate of prenatal and postnatal mortality. Rainfall in the nesting  season was two to three times normal and temperatures were below  normal. Flooding occurred in low areas of Douglas County and many eggs  may have been destroyed when nests were inundated. Cold weather  probably increased the time of incubation for surviving eggs so that  only a few turtles could hatch before winter. Flooding and cold, wet  weather in the season of growth and reproduction, affecting primarily  eggs and hatchlings, may act as checks on populations of _T. ornata_  in certain years.       [Illustration: FIG. 12. The relation of growth rate in         _Terrapene o. ornata_ (solid line) to precipitation (dotted         line) in eastern Kansas. \"Normal\" rate of growth was determined         by averaging records of increase in length of plastron for         turtles in each age group. The growth index is expressed as a         percentage of normal growth and is the mean departure from         normal of all age groups in each calendar year. Precipitation         is for the period, April to September (inclusive), at Lawrence,         Douglas Co., Kansas. The means for precipitation (4.3) and         growth index (100) are indicated by horizontal lines at the         right of the graph.]    The environmental factors governing activity of terrestrial turtles  seem to differ at least in respect to threshold, from the factors  influencing the activity of aquatic turtles. A single month that was  drier or cooler than normal probably would not noticeably affect  growth and activity of aquatic emyids in northeast Kansas, but might  greatly curtail growth of box turtles.    Cagle (1948:202) found that growth of slider turtles (_Pseudemys  scripta_) in Illinois paralleled the growth of bass and bluegills in  the same lake; in the two years in which the fish grew rapidly, the  turtles did also, owing, he thought to \"lessened total population  pressure\" and \"reduced competition for food.\" Growth of five-lined  skinks (_Eumeces fasciatus_) on the Natural History Reservation  paralleled growth of box turtles, probably because at least some of  the same environmental factors influence the growth of both species.  Calculations of departure from normal growth in _E. fasciatus_, made  by me from Fitch's graph (1954:84, Fig. 13), show that relative  success of growth in the period he considered can be ranked by year,  in descending order, as: 1951, 1949, 1948, 1950, 1952. This  corresponds closely to the sequence, 1951, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1952, for  _T. ornata_.      Number of Growing Years    Growth almost stops after the thirteenth year in females and after the  eleventh or twelfth year in males, approximately three years, on the  average, after sexual maturity is attained. The oldest individuals in  which plastral length had increased measurably in the season of  capture were females 14 (2 specimens) and 15 (1) years old. The age of  the oldest growing male was 13 years.    The germinal layer of the epidermis probably remains semiactive  throughout life but functions chiefly as a repair mechanism in adults  that are no longer growing. Growth-rings continue to form irregularly  in some older adults. Growth-rings formed after the period of regular  growth are so closely approximated that they are unmeasurable and  frequently indistinguishable to the unaided eye. If the continued  formation of growth-rings is not accompanied by wear at the edges of  the laminae, the laminae meeting at an interlaminal seam descend, like  steps, into the seam (Pl. 22, Fig. 2). Interlaminal seams of the  plastron deepen with advancing age in most individuals.    Some individuals that are well past the age of regular growth show  measurable increments in years when conditions are especially  favorable. The three oldest growing females were collected in 1954--an  exceptionally good year for growth. Allowing some latitude for  irregular periods of growth in favorable years subsequent to the  period of regular, more or less steady growth, 15 to 20 years is a  tenable estimate of the total growing period.    Longevity    Practically nothing is known about longevity in _T. ornata_ or in  other species of _Terrapene_ although the several plausible records of  ages of 80 to more than 100 years for _T. carolina_ (Oliver,  1955:295-6) would indicate that box turtles, as a group, are  long-lived. There is no known way to determine accurately the age of  an adult turtle after it has stopped growing. It was possible  occasionally to determine ages of 20 to 30 years with fair accuracy by  counting all growth-rings (including those crowded into the  interabdominal seam) of specimens having unworn shells. Without the  presence of newly formed epidermis as a landmark, however, it was  never certain how many years had passed since the last ring was  formed.       [Illustration: FIG. 13.

Twin fetuses were found  in each of two adult does examined.    Twelve deer were checked for body fat in one or all of the following  areas: back (subcutaneous), kidneys, heart, omenta. Of these animals,  seven had large amounts of fat, but five were almost depleted of fat  from these stores. These five were all killed in February or March  1969; three were fawns, and two were yearlings that had not yet shed  their deciduous premolars.    Of 69 animals examined for femur marrow condition, two had fat-depleted  marrow. One was a fawn killed in March 1969 that had not shed its  deciduous first incisors, and the other was a 5-1/2-year-old buck  killed in February 1966.    A fawn and a yearling that had died in February 1969 from unknown  causes also had fat-depleted, marrow. These animals might have been  killed by wolves, for wolves had fed on them. However, they could have  died from malnutrition and been eaten as carrion.      _Table 7.--Pathological conditions in the lower limbs of deer  killed by wolves or hunters_    --------:---:-----:------:--------------------------------------------          :   :     :Cause :  Specimen:Sex: Age :  of  :        Condition   number :   :     :death :  --------:---:-----:------:--------------------------------------------              _Years_     M-28     M  5-1/2 Wolves Right hind foot: \"Old healed ankylosis of                            the pastern joint ... a spontaneously healed                            bacterial arthritis with the destroyed joint                            cavity filled in by solid bone.

M. Barnes. Personal correspondence to L. D. Mech, April 11,  1967.    [32] D. M. Barnes. Undated laboratory report transmitted to L. D. Mech  in 1969.      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS    It has been established that wolves hunting Dall sheep (Murie 1944),  caribou (Crisler 1956), moose (Mech 1966a), and other species usually  have a low percentage of success. In the case of a pack of 15 wolves  hunting moose on Isle Royale during winter, only 4.6 percent of all the  moose detected by the pack were killed; considering only the moose that  the wolves caught up to or held at bay, the kill rate was 7.6 percent  (Mech 1966a).    What little evidence there is about wolves hunting deer indicates that  the success rate is also low with this prey species, at least in  winter. The senior author has now observed a total of 14 deer being  chased by wolves in northeastern Minnesota, mostly by packs of five,  seven or eight wolves (Mech 1966b, and see Mech _et al._, p. 1). In  only one case (6.7 percent) did the wolves (a pair) succeed in catching  their prey.    Low hunting success rates imply that the circumstances influencing  hunts are seldom favorable enough, or the prey animals encountered are  seldom vulnerable enough for the wolves to succeed. When the evidence  cited earlier that most wolf-killed animals are inferior members of  their populations is considered, the most cogent explanation for the  low hunting success of wolves is that relatively few prey animals are  vulnerable.      _Table 8.--Incidence of various abnormalities and pathological  conditions in wolf-killed deer compared with that in hunter-killed  deer_    #: _Number_  %: _Percent_    ---------------------:----------------:----------------:-------------                       :   Wolf-kills   :  Hunter-kills  :                       :------:---------:------:---------:   Level of       Condition       : Deer :  Deer   : Deer :  Deer   : significance                       :  in  :  with   :  in  :  with   :                       :sample:condition:sample:condition:  ---------------------:------:---------:------:---------:-------------                          #     #    %     #     #    %         %    Dental abnormalities   142    8   5.6   259    5   1.9    [34]90    Jaw necrosis, lumps,   142    6   4.2   259    1   0.4    [34]95    or fractures[33]    Pathology of lower      75    5   6.7   126    1   0.8        95    limbs  ---------------------:------:---------:------:---------:-------------    FOOTNOTES:    [33] Two mandibles from wolf-killed deer had large lumps from healed  fractures in the region of the diastemas.

[Illustration: _Figure 12.--When internal organs were present in kills,  they were examined in the field. (Photo courtesy of L. D. Mech.)_]      Age Structure    Our data strongly indicate that in northeastern Minnesota wolves prey  much more heavily on the older members of the deer population, at least  during winter (fig. 7). Substantial vulnerability to wolves seems to  begin at about the age of 5 years (fig. 13), because the percentage of  wolf-killed deer in each year class increases from 9 percent for  4-1/2-year-old animals to 15 percent for 5-1/2-year-olds (table 4).  Indeed, 48 percent of the wolf-kills were aged 5-1/2 and over, which  compares favorably with the Ontario figure of 58 percent for these age  classes (Pimlott _et al._ 1969).    [Illustration: _Figure 13.--Relative rates of predation on deer of  various ages, based on comparisons of the ages of wolf-killed deer with  those of a theoretical population (dashed line) and those of the  hunter-killed population. See figure 7._]    These figures assume added significance when compared with a sample of  deer killed by hunters in the same general area (fig. 1). Only 10  percent of the hunter-killed deer were 5-1/2 years old or older, and  the percent killed in each year class dropped off suddenly from 13  percent aged 4-1/2 to 6 percent aged 5-1/2. If the age structure of the  hunter-kill sample is reasonably representative of the age structure of  the population at large, the wolf-kill data show that wolf predation in  our study area during winter has a definite selective effect on the  deer population.    There is no direct way of knowing that the age structure of the  hunter-killed deer represents the age structure of the deer population  at large. However, sampling hunter-kills is the most practical means  available for gaining an index to the age structure of the existing  herd. Further, there are three indirect pieces of evidence indicating  that the hunter-kill sample represents the actual age structure of the"]]]
