With so many shams in the market, how is a woman to know what she is  buying and whether it will wear? There are a few simple tests that are  helpful. Ravel a piece of silk and examine the warp and woof. If they  are of nearly the same size, the silk is not so likely to split. See  how strong the thread is. Burn a thread. If it burns with a little  flame, it is cotton. If it curls up and smells like burning wool, it  is probably silk. Another test by fire is to burn a piece of the  goods. If it is silk, it will curl up; if it is heavily weighted, it  will keep its shape. If you boil a sample in caustic potash, all the  silk in it will dissolve, but the cotton will remain. If the whole  sample disappears, you may be sure that it was all silk. Soft, finely  woven silks are safest because they will not hold so much weighting.  Crepe de chine is made of a hard twisted thread and therefore wears  well. Taffeta can carry a large amount of weighting, and is always  doubtful; it may wear well, and it may not. There is always a reason  for a bargain sale of silks. The store may wish to clear out a  collection of remnants or to get rid of a line of goods which are no  longer to be carried; but aside from this, there is usually some  defect in the goods themselves or else they have failed to please the  fashionable whim of the moment. Silk is always silk, and if you want  it, you must pay for it.

The total phase  lasted for about a minute and a half, and the eclipse was well observed  from a great many points along the line. A representation of the corona,  as it appeared on this occasion, will be found on Plate VII. (B), p.  142.    The track of the other eclipse to which we have alluded, _i.e._ that of  August 30, 1905, crossed Spain about 200 miles to the northward of that  of 1900. It stretched from Winnipeg in Canada, through Labrador, and  over the Atlantic; then traversing Spain, it passed across the Balearic  Islands, North Africa, and Egypt, and ended in Arabia (see Fig. 6, p.  81). Much was to be expected from a comparison between the photographs  taken in Labrador and Egypt on the question as to whether the corona  would show any alteration in shape during the time that the shadow was  traversing the intervening space--some 6000 miles. The duration of the  total phase in this eclipse was nearly four minutes. Bad weather,  however, interfered a good deal with the observations. It was not  possible, for instance, to do anything at all in Labrador. In Spain the  weather conditions were by no means favourable; though at Burgos, where  an immense number of people had assembled, the total phase was,  fortunately, well seen. On the whole, the best results were obtained at  Guelma in Algeria. The corona on the occasion of this eclipse was a very  fine one, and some magnificent groups of prominences were plainly  visible to the naked eye (see the Frontispiece).    The next total eclipse after that of 1905 was one which occurred on  January 14, 1907. It passed across Central Asia and Siberia, and had a  totality lasting two and a half minutes at most; but it was not observed  as the weather was extremely bad, a circumstance not surprising with  regard to those regions at that time of year.    The eclipse of January 3, 1908, passed across the Pacific Ocean. Only  two small coral islands--Hull Island in the Phoenix Group, and Flint  Island about 400 miles north of Tahiti--lay in the track. Two  expeditions set out to observe it, _i.e._ a combined American party from  the Lick Observatory and the Smithsonian Institution of Washington, and  a private one from England under Mr. F.K. McClean. As Hull Island  afforded few facilities, both parties installed their instruments on  Flint Island, although it was very little better. The duration of the  total phase was fairly long--about four minutes, and the sun very  favourably placed, being nearly overhead. Heavy rain and clouds,  however, marred observation during the first minute of totality, but the  remaining three minutes were successfully utilised, good photographs of  the corona being obtained.    The next few years to come are unfortunately by no means favourable  from the point of view of the eclipse observer. An eclipse will take  place on June 17, 1909, the track stretching from Greenland across the  North Polar regions into Siberia. The geographical situation is,  however, a very awkward one, and totality will be extremely short--only  six seconds in Greenland and twenty-three seconds in Siberia.    The eclipse of May 9, 1910, will be visible in Tasmania. Totality will  last so long as four minutes, but the sun will be at the time much too  low in the sky for good observation.    The eclipse of the following year, April 28, 1911, will also be  confined, roughly speaking, to the same quarter of the earth, the track  passing across the old convict settlement of Norfolk Island, and then  out into the Pacific.    The eclipse of April 17, 1912, will stretch from Portugal, through  France and Belgium into North Germany. It will, however, be of  practically no service to astronomy. Totality, for instance, will last  for only three seconds in Portugal; and, though Paris lies in the  central track, the eclipse, which begins as barely total, will have  changed into an _annular_ one by the time it passes over that city.    The first really favourable eclipse in the near future will be that of  August 21, 1914. Its track will stretch from Greenland across Norway,  Sweden, and Russia. This eclipse is a return, after one saros, of the  eclipse of August 9, 1896.    The last solar eclipse which we will touch upon is that predicted for  June 29, 1927. It has been already alluded to as the first of those in  the future to be _total_ in England. The central line will stretch from  Wales in a north-easterly direction. Stonyhurst Observatory, in  Lancashire, will lie in the track; but totality there will be very  short, only about twenty seconds in duration.      [6] _Knowledge_, vol. xx. p. 9, January 1897.    [7] The _first photographic representation of the corona_ had, however,  been made during the eclipse of 1851. This was a daguerreotype taken by  Dr. Busch at Koenigsberg in Prussia.          CHAPTER IX    FAMOUS ECLIPSES OF THE MOON      The earliest lunar eclipse, of which we have any trustworthy  information, was a total one which took place on the 19th March, 721  B.C., and was observed from Babylon. For our knowledge of this eclipse  we are indebted to Ptolemy, the astronomer, who copied it, along with  two others, from the records of the reign of the Chaldean king,  Merodach-Baladan.    The next eclipse of the moon worth noting was a total one, which took  place some three hundred years later, namely, in 425 B.C. This eclipse  was observed at Athens, and is mentioned by Aristophanes in his play,  _The Clouds_.    Plutarch relates that a total eclipse of the moon, which occurred in 413  B.C., so greatly frightened Nicias, the general of the Athenians, then  warring in Sicily, as to cause a delay in his retreat from Syracuse  which led to the destruction of his whole army.    Seven years later--namely, in 406 B.C., the twenty-sixth year of the  Peloponnesian War--there took place another total lunar eclipse of which  mention is made by Xenophon.    Omitting a number of other eclipses alluded to by ancient writers, we  come to one recorded by Josephus as having occurred a little before the  death of Herod the Great. It is probable that the eclipse in question  was the total lunar one, which calculation shows to have taken place on  the 15th September 5 B.C., and to have been visible in Western Asia.  This is very important, for we are thus enabled to fix that year as the  date of the birth of Christ, for Herod is known to have died in the  early part of the year following the Nativity.    In those accounts of total lunar eclipses, which have come down to us  from the Dark and Middle Ages, the colour of the moon is nearly always  likened to \"blood.\" On the other hand, in an account of the eclipse of  January 23, A.D. 753, our satellite is described as \"covered with a  horrid black shield.\" We thus have examples of the two distinct  appearances alluded to in Chapter VII., _i.e._ when the moon appears of  a coppery-red colour, and when it is entirely darkened.    It appears, indeed, that, in the majority of lunar eclipses on record,  the moon has appeared of a ruddy, or rather of a coppery hue, and the  details on its surface have been thus rendered visible. One of the best  examples of a _bright_ eclipse of this kind is that of the 19th March  1848, when the illumination of our satellite was so great that many  persons could not believe that an eclipse was actually taking place. A  certain Mr. Foster, who observed this eclipse from Bruges, states that  the markings on the lunar disc were almost as visible as on an \"ordinary  dull moonlight night.\" He goes on to say that the British Consul at  Ghent, not knowing that there had been any eclipse, wrote to him for an  explanation of the red colour of the moon on that evening.    Out of the _dark_ eclipses recorded, perhaps the best example is that  of May 18, 1761, observed by Wargentin at Stockholm. On this occasion  the lunar disc is said to have disappeared so completely, that it could  not be discovered even with the telescope. Another such instance is the  eclipse of June 10, 1816, observed from London. The summer of that year  was particularly wet--a point worthy of notice in connection with the  theory that these different appearances are due to the varying state of  our earth's atmosphere.    Sometimes, indeed, it has happened that an eclipse of the moon has  partaken of both appearances, part of the disc being visible and part  invisible. An instance of this occurred in the eclipse of July 12, 1870,  when the late Rev. S.J. Johnson, one of the leading authorities on  eclipses, who observed it, states that he found one-half the moon's  surface quite invisible, both with the naked eye and with the telescope.    In addition to the examples given above, there are three total lunar  eclipses which deserve especial mention.    1. A.D. 755, November 23. During the progress of this eclipse the moon  occulted the star Aldebaran in the constellation of Taurus.    2. A.D. 1493, April 2. This is the celebrated eclipse which is said to  have so well served the purposes of Christopher Columbus. Certain  natives having refused to supply him with provisions when in sore  straits, he announced to them that the moon would be darkened as a sign  of the anger of heaven. When the event duly came to pass, the savages  were so terrified that they brought him provisions as much as he needed.    3. A.D. 1610, July 6. The eclipse in question is notable as having been  seen through the telescope, then a recent invention. It was without  doubt the first so observed, but unfortunately the name of the observer  has not come down to us.          CHAPTER X    THE GROWTH OF OBSERVATION      The earliest astronomical observations must have been made in the Dawn  of Historic Time by the men who tended their flocks upon the great  plains. As they watched the clear night sky they no doubt soon noticed  that, with the exception of the moon and those brilliant wandering"]]]
