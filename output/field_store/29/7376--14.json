Perhaps he is at Tokay now.\"  Pride in the flourishing state of the business here triumphed over her  shyness, and she continued: \"We opened up a good trade with Potocki and  Czartoryski last spring, so we now import wines direct from Tokay, as  well as from the Rhine.\"    \"I congratulate you on doing so well!\" he said, lightly, and passed into  the _casino_.    This was their first conversation, and Herr von Bolwinski could not have  found any love-making in it, even after his thirtieth pint.    The ice was, however, broken, and many similar conversations followed,  sometimes about the weather, or trade, or little everyday events. It was  strange that while they were on distant terms, they were shy of one  another; but on knowing each other better, they became firm friends.  They might now be said to stand at cross-roads. Their simple daily  intercourse might put an end to the peculiar feelings toward each other  that had been produced by their first acquaintance, and subsequent  coldness of manner; or it might bring about a still more dangerous  juxtaposition. They were unconscious of the different paths that lay  before them, and as they saw more of one another, and enjoyed the  pleasure of each other's society more and more, they did not know that  they had already entered upon the road which must lead to sorrow and  renunciation, or to shame....    Surely, had they known they would not have ventured on dangerous  subjects of conversation, which gave opportunities for the expression of  deep feeling and the revelation of each other's hearts. For instance,  she allowed him to know that Herr von Bolwinski had told her of his love  for one who had died. She almost joked about it, but was immediately  sorry when she saw the gravity of his face.    \"I have wounded you,\" she said, regretfully.    \"No, no,\" he answered, \"but I should have liked to be the first to tell  you.\"    He then told her the simple story of his first love.    When he was a student in Munich he had fallen in love with a young girl  of noble family, to whom he gave lessons. She returned his affection;  but the world was too strong for them, and she married some one else,  only to die after a short wedded life.    To the Jewess his story sounded like a fairy tale. A few months before,  she would not have understood his feeling at all, and even now it was  partly incomprehensible to her. She showed this by her next question.    \"And you love her still?\" she asked.    \"She is dead,\" he replied, \"and I do not love her in the same way as I  loved the living woman; but her memory will be dear to me as long as I  live. I shall never forget her.\"    Chane looked thoughtfully before her.    \"Love must be strong,\" she whispered.    He made no reply. Perhaps he had not heard what she said.    Weeks fled rapidly, and the time of the great feast came nearer. Nathan  would soon return home, and they talked of him continually, praising his  industry, his honorable character, and his good honest heart. It is  surprising that they should have spoken of him so often, but perhaps  they did it because they felt they ought to strengthen their  recollection of his existence. He was the barrier that stood between  them, and respect for him was their last safeguard.    The day of Nathan's arrival dawned; it was the Friday before the Jewish  new year. The decisive word was yet unspoken. The fatal time was,  however, near when the scales should fall from their eyes, and they  should see the abyss that yawned beneath them.           *       *       *       *       *    It was October. The rain had fallen ceaselessly all night, making the  country and the dark little town look doubly desolate. Toward morning  the wind rose and scattered the clouds, blowing down the narrow,  tortuous streets, and robbing the poplars of the last red leaves that  clung to their branches. It was one of those miserable days when sorrow  and loneliness seem doubly heavy to those who have to bear their weight.    Chane was alone in the shop. No customers were likely to come in such  weather. She watched the wind sporting with the leaves. Without any  apparent reason for unhappiness, her heart felt heavy.    At last Rosel Juster came in. She was a very poor, but pretty and lively  girl. She made great purchases of sugar, almonds, raisins, and spices.    \"You are preparing for your betrothal,\" said Chane in a friendly tone.  \"I have heard of it, and wish you every happiness. He is a lucky man.\"    \"Thank you,\" answered the girl; \"the betrothal is to be on Tuesday, and  the wedding will be on the second Sabbath after that. We have to think  of his little children--he is a widower.\"    \"You will have a great deal to do.\"    \"Oh, I should think nothing of the work, but he has a sister living with  him, and he is an old man; but what is the good of talking about it?\"    \"Then you would rather not marry him?\"    Rosel looked at her in surprise. \"When are we women ever consulted as to  what we should like?\" she asked. \"I am a poor girl, and he takes me, and  provides for me--that is all that I have to do with it.\" She shrugged  her shoulders, passed her hand over her eyes, and went on quickly:  \"Please give me two ounces of ginger.\"    Chane said no more, but turned to weigh out the requisite quantity of  ginger. Her hands trembled as she twisted up the little paper packet,  and she made several mistakes with the weights.    \"You are not well, I am sure,\" said Rosel, as she prepared to go. \"You  look so pale!\"    \"I am tired,\" answered Chane, sinking into a chair.    As the door closed behind the girl, she let her face fall between her  hands, and sat a long time buried in thought. The words spoken by Rosel  rang in her ears: \"When are we women ever consulted as to what we should  like? I am a poor girl, and he has taken me, and provided for me, that  is all--my God, all!...\"    She kept her eyes firmly closed, but she could not shut them to the  truth any longer. Her whole life lay before her, and she knew that she  was living a lie. \"I belong to Nathan, body and soul--not because it was  my will--not because it was his will--but because our fathers desired  it. And now, when I feel that I am a human being, with a heart and will  of my own--when I love another, I must either be miserable, or ...\"    She did not finish her sentence, for she was no longer able to control  her thoughts. She was filled with self-commiseration, and burning tears  fell from her eyes. She forgot where she was, and that he whom she  loved, and yet feared to meet, might come at any moment. She was first  roused by the monastery bell ringing at twelve o'clock, and tried to  recover her composure.    It was too late. He stood within the door he had just opened.    They had never hitherto spoken of their love for each other. They had  scarcely known that it existed. But when he came near her, and took her  hand in his, gazing into her large, soft, tearful eyes, which were fixed  pathetically upon his face, their love was revealed to him, and all the  sorrow it must bring. She, too, knew that her love was returned as he  gently smoothed her hair back from her forehead, and tried to comfort  her. Then he let her hands fall and left her side.    \"We shall have much to endure,\" he said, as if their love and all its  consequences were mutually understood. \"But we must be firm. I have much  to say to you, but this is not the right time or place; and this  evening\"--he hesitated, and then continued: \"your husband is coming  back, and I will not ask you to give me an interview in secret from him.  I will write to you, and tell you what I think we ought to do.\"    He pressed her hand and went into the _casino_.    Chane got up from her chair, and sent the apprentice, who had been  rubbing up the silver and brass utensils in preparation for the feast,  into the shop. She remained in the kitchen preparing for the Sabbath,  and for the return of her husband. She did everything carefully, but her  manner was different from usual.    \"Have you a headache, ma'am?\" asked the maid-servant, seeing her  suddenly clasp her hands upon her brow, as if she were trying to  recollect something. She felt confused and at a loss, but yet there was  some secret source of joy.    In the evening the office-boy brought her a note.    \"From the district judge to your husband,\" he said; but when she opened  the envelope, she found that it contained a letter addressed to herself.  She did not open it, trembling for its purport.    Dusk had fallen, and candles were brought. She repeated the beautiful  old prayer dutifully, that light and peace should dwell in the house,  and that God's mercy should avert every sorrow, pain, and grief.... She  knew the few words of the formula by heart, and yet this evening they  fell slowly from her lips. She doubted that she was worthy to pray to  God--she a Jewess, who had in her possession a letter from her Christian  lover!    Overcome with fatigue and anxiety, she sank upon a chair, and looked at  the outside of the letter. It was sealed. It was a sin to break a seal  upon the Sabbath. \"It is not my greatest sin,\" she thought, as she tore  open the letter.    Herr von Negrusz wrote of his love for her, and that he must die or go  mad without her. \"Become a Christian, and be my wife. The sin against  your husband will not be so great as the sin against our love, if you  refuse. I know that you love me. Only tell me that you will come to me,  and all else is my care.\"    She crushed the letter in her hand, and threw it down. Then she picked  it up, straightened it out, and reread it. Her hands fell from the  table, and bending over them, her tears fell fast. She stammered  convulsively: \"O my God! help me, enlighten me. Let me not become like  Esther Freudenthal, and end my days in shame and remorse. I have been a  faithful wife....

Will the tactics  of the caterpillar-hunters, who stab and stab again, be repeated here?  No, for the difficulty of movement under ground prohibits so complicated  an operation. Only the tactics of the paralysers of armour-clad insects  are practicable now, for, since there is but one thrust of the dagger,  the feat of surgery is reduced to its simplest terms, a necessary  consequence of the difficulties of an underground operation. The  Scoliae, then, whose destiny it is to hunt and paralyse under the soil  the victuals for their family, require a prey made highly vulnerable  by the close assemblage of the nerve-centres, as are the Weevils and  Buprestes of the Cerceres; and this is why it has fallen to their lot to  share among them the larvae of the Scarabaeidae.    Before they obtained their allotted portion, so closely restricted and  so judiciously selected; before they discovered the precise and almost  mathematical point at which the sting must enter to produce a sudden  and a lasting immobility; before they learnt how to consume, without  incurring the risk of putrefaction, so corpulent a prey: in brief,  before they combined these three conditions of success, what did the  Scoliae do?    The Darwinian school will reply that they were hesitating, essaying,  experimenting. A long series of blind gropings eventually hit upon the  most favourable combination, a combination henceforth to be perpetuated  by hereditary transmission. The skilful co-ordination between the end  and the means was originally the result of an accident.    Chance! A convenient refuge! I shrug my shoulders when I hear it invoked  to explain the genesis of an instinct so complex as that of the Scoliae.  In the beginning, you say, the creature gropes and feels its way; there  is nothing settled about its preferences. To feed its carnivorous larvae  it levies tribute on every species of game which is not too much for  the huntress' power or the nurseling's appetite; its descendants try  now this, now that, now something else, at random, until the accumulated  centuries lead to the selection which best suits the race. Then habit  grows fixed and becomes instinct.    Very well. Let us agree that the Scolia of antiquity sought a different  prey from that adopted by the modern huntress. If the family throve upon  a diet now discontinued, we fail to see that the descendants had any  reason to change it: animals have not the gastronomic fancies of an  epicure whom satiety makes difficult to please. Because the race did  well upon this fare, it became habitual; and instinct became differently  fixed from what it is to-day. If, on the other hand, the original food  was unsuitable, the existence of the family was jeopardized; and any  attempt at future improvement became impossible, because an unhappily  inspired mother would leave no heirs.    To escape falling into this twofold trap, the theorists will reply that  the Scoliae are descended from a precursor, an indeterminate creature,  of changeable habits and changing form, modifying itself in accordance  with its environment and with the regional and climatic conditions and  branching out into races each of which has become a species with the  attributes which distinguish it to-day. The precursor is the deus  ex machina of evolution. When the difficulty becomes altogether  too importunate, quick, a precursor, to fill up the gaps, quick, an  imaginary creature, the nebulous plaything of the mind! This is seeking  to lighten the darkness with a still deeper obscurity; to illumine the  day by piling cloud upon cloud. Precursors are easier to find than sound  arguments. Nevertheless, let us put the precursor of the Scoliae to the  test.    What did she do? Being capable of everything, she did a bit of  everything. Among its descendants were innovators who developed a taste  for tunnelling in sand and vegetable mould. There they encountered the  larvae of the Cetonia, the Oryctes, the Anoxia, succulent morsels on  which to rear their families. By degrees the indeterminate Wasp adopted  the sturdy proportions demanded by underground labour. By degrees she  learnt to stab her plump neighbours in scientific fashion; by degrees  she acquired the difficult art of consuming her prey without killing it;  at length, by degrees, aided by the richness of her diet, she became the  powerful Scolia with whom we are familiar. Having reached this point,  the species assumes a permanent form, as does its instinct.    Here we have a multiplicity of stages, all of the slowest, all of the  most incredible nature, whereas the Wasp cannot found a race except on  the express condition of complete success from the first attempt. We  will not insist further upon the insurmountable objection; we will admit  that, amid so many unfavourable chances, a few favoured individuals  survive, becoming more and more numerous from one generation to the  next, in proportion as the dangerous art of rearing the young is  perfected. Slight variations in one and the same direction form a  definite whole; and at long last the ancient precursor has become the  Scolia of our own times.    By the aid of a vague phraseology which juggles with the secret of  the centuries and the unknown things of life, it is easy to build up a  theory in which our mental sloth delights, after being discouraged by  difficult researches whose final result is doubt rather than positive  statement. But if, so far from being satisfied with hazy generalities  and adopting as current coin the terms consecrated by fashion, we have  the perseverance to explore the truth as far as lies in our power, the  aspect of things will undergo a great change and we shall discover that  they are far less simple than our overprecipitate views declared them  to be. Generalization is certainly a most valuable instrument: science  indeed exists only by virtue of it. Let us none the less beware  of generalizations which are not based upon very firm and manifold  foundations.    When these foundations are lacking, the child is the great generalizer.  For him, the feathered world consists merely of birds; the race of  reptiles merely of snakes, the only difference being that some are big  and some are little. Knowing nothing, he generalizes in the highest  degree; he simplifies, in his inability to perceive the complex. Later  he will learn that the Sparrow is not the Bullfinch, that the Linnet is  not the Greenfinch; he will particularize and to a greater degree each  day, as his faculty of observation becomes more fully trained. In the  beginning he saw nothing but resemblances; he now sees differences, but  still not plainly enough to avoid incongruous comparisons.    In his adult years he will almost to a certainty commit zoological  blunders similar to those which my gardener retails to me. Favier, an  old soldier, has never opened a book, for the best of reasons. He barely  knows how to cipher: arithmetic rather than reading is forced upon us by  the brutalities of life. Having followed the flag over three-quarters of  the globe, he has an open mind and a memory crammed with reminiscences,  which does not prevent him, when we chat about animals, from making the  most crazy assertions. For him the Bat is a Rat that has grown wings;  the Cuckoo is a Sparrow-hawk retired from business; the Slug is a Snail  who has lost his shell with the advance of years; the Nightjar (Known  also as the Goatsucker, because of the mistaken belief that  the bird sucks the milk of Goats, and, in America, as the  Whippoorwill.--Translator's Note.), the Chaoucho-grapaou, as he calls  her, is an elderly Toad, who, becoming enamoured of milk-food, has grown  feathers, so that she may enter the byres and milk the Goats. It is  impossible to drive these fantastic ideas out of his head. Favier  himself, as will be seen, is an evolutionist after his own fashion,  an evolutionist of a very daring type. In accounting for the origin of  animals nothing gives him pause. He has a reply to everything: \"this\"  comes from \"that.\" If you ask him why, he answers:    \"Look at the resemblance!\"    Shall we reproach him with these insanities, when we hear another,  misled by the Monkey's build, acclaim the Pithecanthropus as man's  precursor? Shall we reject the metamorphosis of the Chaoucho-grapaou,  when people tell us in all seriousness that, in the present stage of  scientific knowledge, it is absolutely proved that man is descended from  some rough-hewn Ape? Of the two transformations, Favier's strikes me as  the more credible. A painter of my acquaintance, a brother of the great  composer Felicien David (Felicien Cesar David (1810-1876). His chief  work was the choral symphony \"Le Desert\":--Translator's Note.), favoured  me one day with his reflections on the human structure:    \"Ve, moun bel ami,\" he said. \"Ve, l'home a lou dintre d'un por et lou  defero d'uno mounino.\" \"See, my dear friend, see: man has the inside of  a pig and the outside of a monkey.\"    I recommend the painter's aphorism to those who might like to discover  man's origin in the Hog when the Ape has gone out of fashion. According  to David, descent is proved by internal resemblances:    \"L'home a lou dintre d'un por.\"    The inventory of precursory types sees nothing but organic resemblances  and disdains the differences of aptitude. By consulting only the bones,  the vertebrae, the hair, the nervures of the wings, the joints of the  antennae, the imagination may build up any sort of genealogical tree  that will fit with our theories of classification, for, when all is  said, the animal, in its widest generalization, is represented by a  digestive tube. With this common factor, the way lies open to every kind  of error. A machine is judged not by this or that train of wheels, but  by the nature of the work accomplished.
