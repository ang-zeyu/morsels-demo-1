[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31425"],[0,"Report of the Decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the (#14)"],[1,"in Congress is unquestionable,  and in this we entirely concur, and nothing will be found in this  opinion to the contrary. The power stands firmly on the latter  alternative put by the court--that is, as \"_the inevitable consequence  of the right to acquire territory_.\"    And what still more clearly demonstrates that the court did not mean  to decide the question, but leave it open for future consideration, is  the fact that the case was decided in the Circuit Court by Mr. Justice  Johnson, and his decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court. His  opinion at the circuit is given in full in a note to the case, and in  that opinion he states, in explicit terms, that the clause of the  Constitution applies only to the territory then within the limits of  the United States, and not to Florida, which had been acquired by  cession from Spain. This part of his opinion will be found in the note  in page 517 of the report. But he does not dissent from the opinion of  the Supreme Court; thereby showing that, in his judgment, as well as  that of the court, the case before them did not call for a decision on  that particular point, and the court abstained from deciding it. And  in a part of its opinion subsequent to the passage we have quoted,  where the court speak of the legislative power of Congress in Florida,  they still speak with the same reserve. And in page 546, speaking of  the power of Congress to authorize the Territorial Legislature to  establish courts there, the court say: \"They are legislative courts,  created in virtue of the general right of sovereignty which exists in  the Government, or in virtue of that clause which enables Congress to  make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory  belonging to the United States.\"    It has been said that the construction given to this clause is new,  and now for the first time brought forward. The case of which we are  speaking, and which has been so much discussed, shows that the fact is  otherwise. It shows that precisely the same question came before Mr.  Justice Johnson, at his circuit, thirty years ago--was fully  considered by him, and the same construction given to the clause in  the Constitution which is now given by this court. And that upon an  appeal from his decision the same question was brought before this  court, but was not decided because a decision upon it was not required  by the case before the court.    There is another sentence in the opinion which has been commented on,  which even in a still more striking manner shows how one may mislead  or be misled by taking out a single sentence from the opinion of a  court, and leaving out of view what precedes and follows. It is in  page 546, near the close of the opinion, in which the court say: \"In  legislating for them,\" (the territories of the United States,)  \"Congress exercises the combined powers of the General and of a State  Government.\" And it is said, that as a State may unquestionably  prohibit slavery within its territory, this sentence decides in effect  that Congress may do the same in a Territory of the United States,  exercising there the powers of a State, as well as the power of the  General Government.    The examination of this passage in the case referred to, would be more  appropriate when we come to consider in another part of this opinion  what power Congress can constitutionally exercise in a Territory, over  the rights of person or rights of property of a citizen. But, as it is  in the same case with the passage we have before commented on, we  dispose of it now, as it will save the court from the necessity of  referring again to the case. And it will be seen upon reading the page  in which this sentence is found, that it has no reference whatever to  the power of Congress over rights of person or rights of property--but  relates altogether to the power of establishing judicial tribunals to  administer the laws constitutionally passed, and defining the  jurisdiction they may exercise.    The law of Congress establishing a Territorial Government in Florida,  provided that the Legislature of the Territory should have legislative  powers over \"all rightful objects of legislation; but no law should be  valid which was inconsistent with the laws and Constitution of the  United States.\"    Under the power thus conferred, the Legislature of Florida passed an  act, erecting a tribunal at Key West to decide cases of salvage. And  in the case of which we are speaking, the question arose whether the  Territorial Legislature could be authorized by Congress to establish  such a tribunal, with such powers; and one of the parties, among other  objections, insisted that Congress could not under the Constitution  authorize the Legislature of the Territory to establish such a  tribunal with such powers, but that it must be established by Congress  itself; and that a sale of cargo made under its order, to pay salvors,  was void, as made without legal authority, and passed no property to  the purchaser.    It is in disposing of this objection that the sentence relied on  occurs, and the court begin that part of the opinion by stating with  great precision the point which they are about to decide.    They say: \"It has been contended that by the Constitution of the  United States, the judicial power of the United States extends to all  cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; and that the whole of  the judicial power must be vested 'in one Supreme Court, and in such  inferior courts as Congress shall from time to time ordain and  establish.' Hence it has been argued that Congress cannot vest  admiralty jurisdiction in courts created by the Territorial  Legislature.\"    And after thus clearly stating the point before them, and which they  were about to decide, they proceed to show that these Territorial  tribunals were not constitutional courts, but merely legislative, and  that Congress might, therefore, delegate the power to the Territorial  Government to establish the court in question; and they conclude that  part of the opinion in the following words: \"Although admiralty  jurisdiction can be exercised in the States in those courts only which  are established in pursuance of the third article of the Constitution,  the same limitation does not extend to the Territories. In legislating  for them, Congress exercises the combined powers of the General and  State Governments.\"    Thus it will be seen by these quotations from the opinion, that the  court, after stating the question it was about to decide in a manner  too plain to be misunderstood, proceeded to decide it, and announced,  as the opinion of the tribunal, that in organizing the judicial  department of the Government in a Territory of the United States,  Congress does not act under, and is not restricted by, the third  article in the Constitution, and is not bound, in a Territory, to  ordain and establish courts in which the judges hold their offices  during good behaviour, but may exercise the discretionary power which  a State exercises in establishing its judicial department, and  regulating the jurisdiction of its courts, and may authorize the  Territorial Government to establish, or may itself establish, courts  in which the judges hold their offices for a term of years only; and  may vest in them judicial power upon subjects confided to the  judiciary of the United States. And in doing this, Congress  undoubtedly exercises the combined power of the General and a State  Government. It exercises the discretionary power of a State Government  in authorizing the establishment of a court in which the judges hold  their appointments for a term of years only, and not during good  behaviour; and it exercises the power of the General Government in  investing that court with admiralty jurisdiction, over which the  General Government had exclusive jurisdiction in the Territory.    No one, we presume, will question the correctness of that opinion; nor  is there anything in conflict with it in the opinion now given. The  point decided in the case cited has no relation to the question now  before the court. That depended on the construction of the third  article of the Constitution, in relation to the judiciary of the  United States, and the power which Congress might exercise in a  Territory in organizing the judicial department of the Government. The  case before us depends upon other and different provisions of the  Constitution, altogether separate and apart from the one above  mentioned. The question as to what courts Congress may ordain or  establish in a Territory to administer laws which the Constitution  authorizes it to pass, and what laws it is or is not authorized by the  Constitution to pass, are widely different--are regulated by different  and separate articles of the Constitution, and stand upon different  principles. And we are satisfied that no one who reads attentively the  page in Peters's Reports to which we have referred, can suppose that  the attention of the court was drawn for a moment to the question now  before this court, or that it meant in that case to say that Congress  had a right to prohibit a citizen of the United States from taking any  property which he lawfully held into a Territory of the United States.    This brings us to examine by what provision of the Constitution the  present Federal Government, under its delegated and restricted powers,  is authorized to acquire territory outside of the original limits of  the United States, and what powers it may exercise therein over the  person or property of a citizen of the United States, while it remains  a Territory, and until it shall be admitted as one of the States of  the Union.    There is certainly no power given by the Constitution to the Federal  Government to establish or maintain colonies bordering on the United  States or at a distance, to be ruled and governed at its own pleasure;  nor to enlarge its territorial limits"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31427"],[0,"Miscellaneous Writings, 1883-1896 (#14)"],[1," of man in the glory of his Father; and  judges, through the stern mandate of Science, all human  systems of etiology and teleology. [10]    _If God does not recognize matter, how did Jesus, who was_  _\"__the way, the truth, and the life,__\"__ cognize it?_    Christ Jesus' sense of matter was the opposite of that  which mortals entertain: his nativity was a spiritual and  immortal sense of the ideal world. His earthly mission [15]  was to translate substance into its original meaning,  Mind. He walked upon the waves; he turned the water  into wine; he healed the sick and the sinner; he raised  the dead, and rolled away the stone from the door of his  own tomb. His demonstration of Spirit virtually van- [20]  quished matter and its supposed laws. Walking the  wave, he proved the fallacy of the theory that matter is  substance; healing through Mind, he removed any sup-  position that matter is intelligent, or can recognize or  express pain and pleasure. His triumph over the grave [25]  was an everlasting victory for Life; it demonstrated the  lifelessness of matter, and the power and permanence  of Spirit. He met and conquered the resistance of the  world.    If you will admit, with me, that matter is neither [30]  substance, intelligence, nor Life, you may have all that    [Page 75.]    is left of it; and you will have touched the hem of the [1]  garment of Jesus' idea of matter, Christ was \"the way;\"  since Life and Truth were the way that gave us, through  a human person, a spiritual revelation of man's possible  earthly development. [5]    _Why do you insist that there is but one Soul, and that_  _Soul is not in the body?_    _First:_ I urge this fundamental fact and grand verity  of Christian Science, because it includes a rule that must  be understood, or it is impossible to demonstrate the Sci- [10]  ence. Soul is a synonym of Spirit, and God is Spirit.  There is but one God, and the infinite is not within the  finite; hence Soul is one, and is God; and God is not in  matter or the mortal body.    _Second:_ Because Soul is a term for Deity, and this [15]  term should seldom be employed except where the word  _God_ can be used and make complete sense. The word  _Soul_ may sometimes be used metaphorically; but if this  term is warped to signify human quality, a substitution  of _sense_ for _soul_ clears the meaning, and assists one to [20]  understand Christian Science. Mary's exclamation,  \"\"My _soul_ doth magnify the Lord,\" is rendered in Sci-  ence, \"My _spiritual sense_ doth magnify the Lord;\"  for the name of Deity used in that place does not bring  out the meaning of the passage. It was evidently an [25]  illuminated sense through which she discovered the  spiritual origin of man. \"The soul that sinneth, it shall  die,\" means, that mortal man (_alias_ material sense) that  sinneth, shall die; and the commonly accepted view is  that _soul_ is deathless. Soul is the divine Mind,--for [30]  Soul cannot be formed or brought forth by human    [Page 76.]    thought,--and must proceed from God; hence it must [1]  be sinless, and destitute of self-created or derived capacity  to sin.    _Third:_ Jesus said, \"If a man keep my saying, he  shall never see death.\" This statement of our Master [5]  is true, and remains to be demonstrated; for it is the  ultimatum of Christian Science; but this immortal saying  can never be tested or proven true upon a false premise,  such as the mortal belief that soul is in body, and life  and intelligence are in matter. That doctrine is not [10]  theism, but pantheism. According to human belief the  bodies of mortals are mortal, but they contain immortal  souls! hence these bodies must die for these souls to  escape and be immortal. The theory that death must  occur, to set a human soul free from its environments, [15]  is rendered void by Jesus' divine declaration, who spake  as never man spake,--and no man can rationally reject  his authority on this subject and accept it on other topics  less important.    Now, exchange the term _soul_ for _sense_ whenever this [20]  word means the so-called soul in the body, and you will  find the right meaning indicated. The misnamed human  soul is material sense, which sinneth and shall die; for  it is an error or false sense of mentality in matter, and  matter has no sense. You will admit that Soul is the [25]  Life of man. Now if Soul sinned, it would die; for \"the  wages of sin is death.\" The Scripture saith, \"When  Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also  appear with him in glory.\" The Science of Soul, Spirit,  involves this appearing, and is essential to the fulfilment [30]  of this glorious prophecy of the master Metaphysician,  who overcame the last enemy, death.    [Page 77.]    _Did the salvation of the eunuch depend merely on his_ [1]  _believing that Jesus Christ was the Son of God?_    It did; but this believing was more than faith in the  fact that Jesus was the Messiah. Here the verb _believe_  took its original meaning, namely, to be _firm_,--yea, to [5]  _understand_ those great truths asserted of the Messiah:  it meant to discern and consent to that infinite demand  made upon the eunuch in those few words of the apostle.  Philip's requirement was, that he should not only ac-  knowledge the incarnation,--God made manifest through [10]  man,--but even the eternal unity of man and God, as  the divine Principle and spiritual idea; which is the in-  dissoluble bond of union, the power and presence, in  divine Science, of Life, Truth, and Love, to support their  ideal man. This is the Father's great Love that He [15]  hath bestowed upon us, and it holds man in endless  Life and one eternal round of harmonious being. It  guides him by Truth that knows no error, and with  supersensual, impartial, and unquenchable Love. To  _believe_ is to _be firm_. In adopting all this vast idea of [20]  Christ Jesus, the eunuch was to _know_ in whom he be-  lieved. To _believe_ thus was to enter the spiritual sanctuary  of Truth, and there learn, in divine Science, somewhat  of the All-Father-Mother God. It was to understand  God and man: it was sternly to rebuke the mortal [25]  belief that man has fallen away from his first estate; that  man, made in God's own likeness, and reflecting Truth,  could fall into mortal error; or, that man is the father  of man. It was to enter unshod the Holy of Holies, where  the miracle of grace appears, and where the miracles of [30]  Jesus had their birth,--healing the sick, casting out  evils, and resurrecting the human _sense_ to the belief    [Page 78.]    that Life, God, is not buried in matter. This is the spirit- [1]  ual dawn of the Messiah, and the overture of the  angels. This is when God is made manifest in the  flesh, and thus it destroys all sense of sin, sickness, and  death,--when the brightness of His glory encompasseth [5]  all being.    _Can Christian Science Mind-healing be taught to those_  _who are absent?_    The Science of Mind-healing can no more be taught  thus, than can science in any other direction. I know [10]  not how to teach either Euclid or the Science of Mind  silently; and never dreamed that either of these partook  of the nature of occultism, magic, alchemy, or necro-  mancy. These \"ways that are vain\" are the inventions  of animal magnetism, which would deceive, if possible, [15]  the very elect. We will charitably hope, however, that  some people employ the _et cetera_ of ignorance and self-  conceit unconsciously, in their witless ventilation of false  statements and claims. Misguiding the public mind and  taking its money in exchange for this abuse, has become [20]  too common: we will hope it is the froth of error passing  off; and that Christian Science will some time appear all  the clearer for the purification of the public thought con-  cerning it.    _Has man fallen from a state of perfection?_ [25]    If God is the Principle of man (and He is), man is the  idea of God; and this idea cannot fail to express the ex-  act nature of its Principle,--any more than goodness,  to present the quality of good. Human hypotheses are  always human vagaries, formulated views antagonistic [30]    [Page 79.]    to the divine order and the nature of Deity. All these [1]  mortal beliefs will be purged and dissolved in the cru-  cible of Truth, and the places once knowing them will  know them no more forever, having been swept clean  by the winds of history. The grand verities of Science [5]  will sift the chaff from the wheat, until it is clear to hu-  man comprehension that man was, and is, God's perfect  likeness, that reflects all whereby we can know God. In  Him we live, move, and have being. Man's origin and  existence being in Him, man is the ultimatum of per- [10]  fection, and by no means the medium of imperfection.  Immortal man is the eternal idea of Truth, that cannot  lapse into a mortal belief or error concerning himself  and his origin: he cannot get out of the focal distance of  infinity. If God is upright and eternal, man as His like- [15]  ness is erect in goodness and perpetual in Life, Truth,  and Love. If the great cause is perfect, its effect is per-  fect also; and cause and effect in Science are immutable  and immortal. A mortal who is sinning, sick, and dying,  is not immortal man; and never was, and never can be, [20]  God's image and likeness, the true ideal of immortal  man's divine Principle. The spiritual man is that per-  fect and unfallen likeness, coexistent and coeternal with  God. \"As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be  made alive.\" [25]    _What course should Christian Scientists take in regard_  _to aiding persons brought before the courts for violation of_  _medical statutes?_    Beware of joining any medical league which in any  way obligates you to assist--because they chance to be [30]  under arrest--vendors of patent pills, mesmerists,    [Page 80.]    occultists, sellers of impure literature, and authors of [1]"]]]
