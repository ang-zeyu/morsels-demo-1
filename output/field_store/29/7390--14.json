[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35413"],[0,"A Review of the Middle American Tree Frogs of the Genus Ptychohyla (#14)"],[1," factor in the distribution of  _Ptychohyla_. As has been shown previously, the tadpoles of  _Ptychohyla_ are adapted for existence in torrential streams, where  the water is cool, and the amount of oxygen is high. Clearly these  tadpoles are unsuited for life in ponds or sluggish streams in the  lowlands, where the temperature of the water is high, a layer of silt  on the bottom is deep, and the amount of oxygen is low. The tadpoles  cling to rocks on the bottom of the streams; there they move slowly  across the rocks, apparently feeding on the thin covering of algae.  Tadpoles were not observed on rocks having a thick covering of algae  or moss. The tadpoles were observed to swim against the current in  torrential streams, in which no fishes were found. Therefore, it seems  as though the presence of the stream-habitat for the tadpoles is a  significant factor in the ecological distribution of the species of  _Ptychohyla_.                                Interspecific Competition    At localities where two species of _Ptychohyla_ occur sympatrically  (_P. ignicolor_ and _P. leonhardschultzei_ at Vista Hermosa, Oaxaca,  and _P. euthysanota euthysanota_ and _P. schmidtorum schmidtorum_ at  Finca La Paz, Depto. San Marcos, Guatemala) effort was made to  determine what, if any, ecological interspecific relationships  existed. Although adults of the sympatric species were found on  adjacent leaves or branches of bushes overhanging the streams at both  localities, segregation at the time of breeding seems to be maintained  by the notably different breeding calls in sympatric species (see  discussion of breeding calls). Thus, as has been shown by Blair  (1956), Fouquette (1960), and others working on a variety of  pond-breeding frogs and toads, the breeding call in _Ptychohyla_ acts  as an important reproductive isolating mechanism.    At no locality were _Ptychohyla_ and associated species of hylids  found so abundantly as were species of pond-breeding hylids in the  lowlands. Apparently reproductive activity is not concentrated in a  short breeding season, and it is highly doubtful if the populations of  these frogs are as large as those of the lowland pond-breeders. The  continual humid conditions and abundance of insect food throughout the  year in the cloud forest are perhaps indicative of little  interspecific competition among adults of _Ptychohyla_ and other  sympatric hylids.    At Finca La Paz, Guatemala, tadpoles of two species of _Ptychohyla_  were ecologically segregated. The tadpoles of _P. euthysanota  euthysanota_ were found in riffles in the streams, whereas those of  _P. schmidtorum schmidtorum_ were found in slower water, chiefly in  small pools in the streams. At Vista Hermosa, Oaxaca, tadpoles of _P.  leonhardschultzei_ were found in riffles, and tadpoles of the  sympatric _P. ignicolor_ were found in a small pool in a stream.  Similar ecological relationships were observed for several species of  Costa Rican hylids. Throughout the range of _Ptychohyla_ east of the  Isthmus of Tehuantepec, members of the genus occur with species of  _Plectrohyla_, all of which are larger than _Ptychohyla_, and all of  which have tadpoles that live in torrential streams. Tadpoles of  _Ptychohyla spinipollex_ have been found in streams inhabited by the  tadpoles of _Plectrohyla guatemalensis_ and _P. quecchi_; tadpoles of  _Ptychohyla euthysanota euthysanota_ and _P. schmidtorum schmidtorum_  were found in streams inhabited by tadpoles of _Plectrohyla  guatemalensis_, _P. matudai_, and _P. sagorum_. In some streams great  numbers of tadpoles occur. The habitat is rather restricted, and the  food supply is limited. Consequently, interspecific competition among  the various species of hylids whose tadpoles live in the torrential  streams probably is highest during the larval stage. Unfortunately,  this aspect of salientian population ecology has received no intensive  study.                               Reproduction and Development    Since the cloud forests inhabited by _Ptychohyla_ are daily bathed in  clouds and have a fairly evenly distributed rainfall throughout the  year, the frogs living in these forests are active throughout the  year. At least some of the species evidently have a long breeding  season, for I found calling males of _P. leonhardschultzei_ in  February, March, and August, and found tadpoles in February, March,  June, and August. Tadpoles of the various species have been obtained  throughout much of the year, as follows: _P. euthysanota euthysanota_,  February, March, May, and July; _P. euthysanota macrotympanum_, March,  June, and August; _P. spinipollex_, February, March, April, June,  July, and August; _P. schmidtorum schmidtorum_, March, May, June,  July, and August; _P. schmidtorum chamulae_, June and August; _P.  ignicolor_, June. I suspect that this temporal distribution more  accurately reflects the seasonal activities of collectors than of the  frogs.    Calling frogs usually are on vegetation adjacent to or overhanging  streams; some calling males of _P. spinipollex_ were on rocks in or by  streams. Clasping pairs of _P. euthysanota_ and _P. schmidtorum_ were  observed on vegetation by streams. Despite intensive search, no eggs  were found. It is doubtful if _Ptychohyla_ deposit eggs on vegetation  overhanging streams, as do centrolenids and _Phyllomedusa_, for  egg-clutches of these frogs are easily found. Possibly the eggs are  laid separately on vegetation above the stream, in which case they  could be overlooked easily. In streams where _Ptychohyla_ and other  hylid tadpoles occur, empty egg capsules have been found on the lee  sides of rocks, but there is no way to determine which species laid  the eggs.    Numbers of eggs were counted in gravid females; the largest eggs have  diameters ranging from 2.5 to 3.0 mm. The smaller species, comprising  the _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ group, have fewer eggs than do the larger  species. Numbers of eggs found in females of the various species are:  _P. euthysanota euthysanota_, 108; _P. euthysanota macrotympanum_, 136,  160; _P. leonhardschultzei_, 141; _P. spinipollex_, 119, 134, 143;  _P. schmidtorum schmidtorum_, 59, 61, 90; _P. schmidtorum chamulae_,  60, 71, 89.    Duration of the larval stage is unknown. Metamorphosing young have  been found from May through August. From two to six completely  metamorphosed young are available for each of the species, except for  _P. ignicolor_ of which none is available. The smallest young frog is  a _P. euthysanota_ having a snout-vent length of 14.2 mm.; the largest  young frog is a _P. schmidtorum schmidtorum_ having a snout-vent  length of 17.0 mm.                                 PHYLOGENY OF PTYCHOHYLA      The preceding data on morphology, life histories, and behavior form  the basis for the following interpretation of the phylogeny of  _Ptychohyla_. Additional data are needed to support some of the ideas  discussed below; many of the data that are available for _Ptychohyla_  are lacking for other, possibly related, hylids. The family Hylidae is  composed of several hundred species, and most of the species are  poorly known. Consequently, any attempt to place _Ptychohyla_ in the  over-all scheme of hylid phylogeny would be premature at this time.  But, as between the five species of two species-groups here recognized  as constituting the genus _Ptychohyla_, some estimate of relationships  can be made. First, it is necessary to determine the validity of the  genus itself.                        Ptychohyla as a Natural Assemblage    As stated in the diagnosis of the genus, the only character that sets  this group of species apart from other hylids is the presence of  ventrolateral glands in the breeding males. To many systematists the  thought of being able to identify to genus only breeding males is  sufficiently disturbing to cause them to view with disfavor the  recognition of the genus. Nonetheless, the question is raised: Do the  five species herein placed in the genus _Ptychohyla_ constitute a  natural assemblage? If the genus is considered to be more than a  category of convenience, that is to say, a group of related species  having a common origin, the primary problem is to determine whether or  not the five species form a phylogenetic unit.    The species of _Ptychohyla_ are divided into two groups on the basis  of external morphology, breeding calls, and tadpoles. The _Ptychohyla  euthysanota_ group seems to be a natural group composed of three  species, all of which are more closely related to one another than to  any other hylid. Likewise, the species comprising the _Ptychohyla  schmidtorum_ group seem to represent a natural unit. If the presence  of ventrolateral glands in breeding males is ignored, a student of  salientian systematics might derive the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group  from a hylid stock containing _Hyla miotympanum_ and _Hyla  mixomaculata_. Likewise, _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ could be placed with  _Hyla uranochroa_ and related species in Costa Rica. Nonetheless, the  fact remains that all of the species assigned to the genus  _Ptychohyla_ have ventrolateral glands in the breeding males;  furthermore, ventrolateral glands are unknown in other hylids. If the  _P. schmidtorum_ group and the _P. euthysanota_ group each evolved  from separate hylid stocks, then the ventrolateral glands must have  developed independently in both groups. That ventrolateral glands  developed independently in five species of frogs in southern Mexico  and northern Central America and not in any of the other approximately  500 species of hylids in the world is untenable. It is more logical to  assume that the development of the glands took place only once in a  stock of hylids that gave rise to the five species herein recognized  as members of the genus _Ptychohyla_.                                  Generic Relationships    The affinities of _Ptychohyla_ apparently are not with any of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35448"],[0,"Herd Record of the Association of Breeders of Thorough-Bred Neat Stock (#14)"],[1,"t.: calved  September 6th, 1860; got by John Bull, _{*}40, 3025, Dam Madonna 3d, by  Kirkleavington, 610,--              2d dam Madonna, by imported Wolviston, 1109,            3d--Marchioness, by imported Yorkshireman, 189,            4th---Narcissus, by Bertram 2d, 21,            5th--Nonpareil, by Young Denton, (963)            6th--imported Arabella, by North Star, (460)            7th--Aurora, by Comet, (155) 8th-- ---- by Henry,            (301) 9th-- ---- by Danby, (190).      =Madonna 5th,=    Red roan, bred and owned by AARON M.
