The longest plates, located near the middle of  each jaw, are reported to reach 12 feet (3.7 m), or more, in length.  (_Photo by D. R. Patten._)]          RIGHT WHALE (B)    _Eubalaena glacialis_ (Borowski 1781)      Other Common Names    Black right whale, Biscayan right whale, Biscay whale, Nordcaper right  whale.      Description    These right whales reach a length of about 53 feet (16.2 m).    The body is rotund and completely lacking a dorsal fin or a dorsal  ridge. The upper jaw is long, narrow, and highly arched. The lips are  similarly highly arched. The top of the head has a series of bumps or  callosities, the largest one of which is known as the \"bonnet,\" on the  upper surface in front of the blowholes. Yellowish-brown lice and, less  frequently, barnacles grow on the callosities. The color and extent of  the callosities varies from one individual to the next.    The two blowholes are widely separated, resulting in the projection of  the blow upward as two distinct spouts. The body is dark on the back,  sometimes black, more often brown or mottled, usually has a region of  white on the chin and belly, and sometimes has numerous small  grayish-white scars of unknown origin. The baleen plates are up to 7.2  feet (2.2 m) long, very narrow, and variable in color from dark brownish  through dark gray to black in color. When the animals swim, mouth agape  near the surface, the baleen sometimes appears pale yellowish gray in  color.      Natural History Notes    Right whales are usually not wary of boats and may often be approached  very closely.    Like sperm and humpback whales, they usually throw their flukes high  into the air when beginning a long dive.    Right whales feed primarily on copepods.    Historically, this whale was nearly exterminated by hunters, who took  advantage of its slow speed and who knew that its carcass floats, to  harvest these animals for their great yield of whalebone and oil. It was  these characteristics which prompted whalers to dub these animals the  \"right\" whales to kill (as opposed to the ones that were too fast to  catch and sank when killed).      May Be Confused With    The distinct blow of the right whales and their smooth dark back, devoid  of any traces of a dorsal fin, make it unlikely that the species will be  confused with any other large whales except, perhaps, the bowhead whale.  In the event that the expansion of their ranges again causes these two  species to overlap in distribution, they can be distinguished from one  another by the characteristics discussed on p. 49.    If only the flukes are seen as the animal begins a dive, right and  bowhead whales may be distinguished from the other two species of large  whales exhibiting this behavior, the sperm and the humpback, in this  way: the flukes of right and bowhead whales are broad, pointed on the  tips, greatly concave towards a deep fluke notch, and dark below: those  of the sperm whale are more nearly triangular, while those of the  humpback whale have a jagged irregular or rippled rear margin and are  sometimes variously white below.      Distribution    Like its more northern relative, the bowhead whale, the right whale was  once the object of a widespread and extensive whale fishery, which  reduced the species to critically low numbers.    Though the former range of right whales is not clearly known, the  species is thought to have been abundant from the Davis Straits south at  least to the Carolinas and Bermuda and to have occurred in winter to  Florida and perhaps into the Gulf of Mexico.    Currently, right whales are known from Iceland south to Florida. Animals  move north along the eastern Florida coast between early January and  late March. During this time the species has also been observed in the  Gulf of Mexico off southwestern Florida and Texas. Right whales pass the  coast of New England in fair numbers in spring and continue as far north  as at least Nova Scotia. Right whales are also found off Iceland, though  the migration routes to and from Iceland waters are not known. The  recent apparent increases in numbers at the northern and southern  coastal approaches in New England and Florida, respectively, lend  credibility to the hopeful contention that the species will again  recolonize its historical range.      Stranded Specimens    Stranded right whales can be easily identified by all the characters  discussed on p. 49 and summarized in Table 2.    [Illustration: Figure 47.--The V-shaped blow characteristic of right  whales. Note the two distinct spouts, bushy in appearance. (_Photo off  Cape Cod by W. A. Watkins._)]    [Illustration: Figure 48.--A right whale off the northeastern Florida  coast.

Note that this species, like the bowhead, lacks  the series of ventral grooves which characterize all other baleen whales  of the western North Atlantic.

Some right whales, however, do have extensive regions of white on  the ventral surface, including the chin. (_Photo from U.S. National  Museum, courtesy of J. G.

Description    Male sperm whales have been reported to reach a length of 69 feet (20.9  m), though today individuals larger than 50 feet (15.2 m) are rare.  Females are much smaller, rarely exceeding 38 feet (11.6 m).    A sperm whale is among the easiest of whales to identify at sea even  when comparatively little of the animal is visible. It has a huge head,  which comprises from a fourth to a third of the animal's total length.  (The proportion is considerably higher for males than for females.) The  blunted \"squarish\" snout, which may project up to 5 feet (1.5 m) beyond  the tip of the lower jaw, houses a large reservoir containing a  high-quality oil called spermaceti.    The single blowhole is located well to the left of the midline and far  forward on the head. As a consequence the small bushy blow, usually less  than 8 feet (2.4 m), emerges forward at a sharp angle from the head and  towards the left. Under good wind conditions this feature alone may  permit positive identification of sperm whales even at considerable  distances.    Sperm whales have a distinct dorsal hump, usually rounded in its  appearance about two-thirds of the way back from the tip of the snout.  Immediately behind the hump is a series of knuckles or crenulations  along the midline. This hump and the crenulations are clearly visible  when the animals arch the tail before beginning a dive. There is a  ventral keel, which may also be visible as animals \"sound\" (dive). The  flukes of sperm whales are broad and triangular in shape, are not  concaved, but are deeply notched on the rear margin.    Sperm whales usually are dark brownish gray in color. The body has a  \"corrugated\" or \"shriveled\" appearance. The belly and the front of the  head may be grayish to off-white.

Except on the Pacific lowlands, this species is abundant throughout the  state. It has been collected from sea level to 2800 meters, the greatest  altitudinal range of any amphibian in Michoacan. It has been found  frequently in the Tepalcatepec Valley; it is not a distinctly highland  species in southern Michoacan, as stated by Peters (1954:9). One  specimen from Aguililla (UMMZ 119257) is an albino. In this specimen  there is a faint pattern on the hind limbs; otherwise the entire body is  creamy white; the eyes are pink.      ~Rana pustulosa~ Boulenger         _Rana pustulosa_ Boulenger, Ann.

Although _Rana pustulosa_ seems to be absent from the Mexican Plateau in  Michoacan, it has been collected at elevations of 850 to 2150 meters on  the slopes of the Cordillera Volcanico and in the Sierra de Coalcoman.  Usually the frogs are found along rocky streams, but at Coalcoman they  were found in a hyacinth-choked old river channel, and at El Sabino, in  irrigation ditches.    In most specimens the dorsum is dark olive-brown; in some it is pale  olive-tan with dense dark brown mottling on the back and dark transverse  bands on the hind limbs.    Thirteen tadpoles (UMMZ 94271) taken from a seepage pool by a stream  near Uruapan closely resemble the description of tadpoles of this  species given by Taylor (1942b).

Sci. Soc. Philom., 2:89,       1800.         Beach between Rio Motin and Rio Colotlan (2); Maruata; Playa       Azul (4).    Green sea turtles are abundant along the coast of Michoacan. Laying  females and fresh nests were found on August 6-12, 1950, July 14-16,  1951, and July 8-10, 1955. The general account of sea turtles on the  coast of Michoacan that was given by Peters (1957) is supplemented here  by my field notes on the actions of one female observed on the night of  July 14, 1951, near Maruata by Donald D. Brand and I. Because of a full  moon, visibility was excellent.    In the course of the day several _Chelonia_ were seen in the surf;  shortly after dark the first turtle was observed on the beach. Several  were observed to come out on the beach and crawl nearly to the strand  line, only to return to the sea.    At 10:20 p. m. one turtle was seen about 15 meters from the water. We  watched this turtle from some distance and observed that by 10:26 p. m.  she had moved about ten meters to a bank of sand about two meters high.  Ten minutes later she had climbed the bank and disappeared over the top  into the brush. We moved closer and remained hidden below the bank.  Although we could not see the turtle, we could hear her movements.  Between 10:37 and 10:57 p. m. the turtle dug, often flipping the dry  sand for a distance of about two meters. When this energetic digging  ceased, we moved up the bank to see that she was facing inland and  sitting in a depression about one and one-half meters in diameter and 30  centimeters in depth. She had cleaned out this depression in the past 20  minutes. Between 11:00 and 11:36 p. m. she dug the nest hole by first  scooping sand with one hind flipper and then with the other; when sand  was thrown by one flipper, there was a similar, but weaker, motion by  the other flipper. At 11:36 p. m. she stopped digging. By crawling up  behind the turtle we were able to examine the nest cavity, which  measured 21 centimeters across the top and 38 centimeters deep. The  diameter of the bottom of the hole was estimated to be about 50  centimeters. At 11:40 p. m. she released the first egg; a minute later  she dropped the second. At 11:42 p. m. the third and fourth eggs were  released; these were coherent, as were the fifth and sixth eggs released  at 11:43 p. m. After this, as many as three eggs were dropped at a  time. After laying about 60 eggs, she paused for a minute and then  continued laying. By 11:55 p. m. she had laid 98 eggs; after this, the  process of deposition slowed considerably. She dropped a fragment of an  egg followed by normal eggs. At midnight she deposited a miniature egg  about 20 mm. in diameter. This terminated the deposition. Immediately  she began to cover the nest.    Within ten minutes after the last egg was deposited the nest had been  covered. The turtle first had been seen at 10:20 p. m.; judging from its  speed and its distance from the water, the turtle probably had been on  land for about ten minutes. About 25 minutes were used in crawling from  the water to the nesting site. One hour and 33 minutes were spent at the  nesting site; of this time twenty minutes were taken for egg deposition.  The turtle was not followed back to the water, but if the return trip  took approximately the same amount of time as required to travel from  the ocean to the nesting site, the total elapsed time from departure to  return to the water was about two and one-half hours.    We collected the eggs as they were deposited. There were 106 eggs, each  having a diameter of about 40 mm., plus one small egg and a fragment of  another. The turtle had a carapace about one meter in length.    From our limited observations of sea turtles and their tracks on the  beaches, and from the accounts of these animals by the residents of the  coastal region, great numbers of sea turtles use these relatively  uninhabited beaches for nesting grounds. However, the turtles do not go  unmolested. The natives capture turtles and collect their eggs. Opened  and emptied nests also showed signs of predatory activity on the part of  other mammals. In the vicinity of Playa Azul several turtles were killed  by dogs.      ~Kinosternon hirtipes hirtipes~ Wagler         _Cinosternon hirtipes_ Wagler, Naturl. Syst. Amph., p. 37,       1830.--Mexico.

Excepting Lago de Patzcuaro, _Kinosternon integrum_ occupies all  permanent and temporary ponds, lakes, and streams below 2200 meters  throughout the state. At Coalcoman the species was in roadside ditches,  small puddles, flooded fields, a hyacinth-choked ox-bow of the Rio  Coalcoman, as well as in the Rio Coalcoman and its tributaries.  Specimens from Arteaga and Barranca de Herradero were found in clear  rocky streams; the one from Las Higuertas was found in a small muddy  pond in pine-oak forest.    On August 26, 1960, James R. Dixon found a copulating pair in a pool at  Capirio. The large series from Coalcoman contains juveniles and adults;  these turtles formed the basis for the study of relative growth of  plastral scutes in this species by Mosimann (1956).      ~Geoemyda rubida perixantha~ Mosimann and Rabb         _Geoemyda rubida perixantha_ Mosimann and Rabb, Occ.
