[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4075"],[0,"The Intrusion of Jimmy (#14)"],[1," something of a shock to come suddenly out  of his dreams, and face the fact that she was in reality practically  a stranger. He felt as one might with a friend whose memory has been  wiped out. It went against the grain to have to begin again from the  beginning after all the time they had been together.    A curious constraint fell upon him.    \"Why, how do you do, Mr. Pitt?\" she said, holding out her hand.    Jimmy began to feel better. It was something that she remembered his  name.    \"It's like meeting somebody out of a dream,\" said Molly. \"I have  sometimes wondered if you were real. Everything that happened that  night was so like a dream.\"    Jimmy found his tongue.    \"You haven't altered,\" he said, \"you look just the same.\"    \"Well,\" she laughed, \"after all, it's not so long ago, is it?\"    He was conscious of a dull hurt. To him, it had seemed years. But he  was nothing to her--just an acquaintance, one of a hundred. But what  more, he asked himself, could he have expected? And with the thought  came consolation. The painful sense of having lost ground left him.  He saw that he had been allowing things to get out of proportion. He  had not lost ground. He had gained it. He had met her again, and she  remembered him. What more had he any right to ask?    \"I've crammed a good deal into the time,\" he explained. \"I've been  traveling about a bit since we met.\"    \"Do you live in Shropshire?\" asked Molly.    \"No. I'm on a visit. At least, I'm supposed to be. But I've lost the  way to the place, and I am beginning to doubt if I shall ever get  there. I was told to go straight on. I've gone straight on, and here  I am, lost in the snow. Do you happen to know whereabouts Dreever  Castle is?\"    She laughed.    \"Why,\" she said, \"I am staying at Dreever Castle, myself.\"    \"What?\"    \"So, the first person you meet turns out to be an experienced guide.  You're lucky, Mr. Pitt.\"    \"You're right,\" said Jimmy slowly, \"I am.\"    \"Did you come down with Lord Dreever? He passed me in the car just  as I was starting out. He was with another man and Lady Julia Blunt.  Surely, he didn't make you walk?\"    \"I offered to walk. Somebody had to. Apparently, he had forgotten to  let them know he was bringing me.\"    \"And then he misdirected you! He's very casual, I'm afraid.\"    \"Inclined that way, perhaps.\"    \"Have you known Lord Dreever long?\"    \"Since a quarter past twelve last night.\"    \"Last night!\"    \"We met at the Savoy, and, later, on the Embankment. We looked at  the river together, and told each other the painful stories of our  lives, and this morning he called, and invited me down here.\"    Molly looked at him with frank amusement.    \"You must be a very restless sort of person,\" she said. \"You seem to  do a great deal of moving about.\"    \"I do,\" said Jimmy. \"I can't keep still. I've got the go-fever, like  that man in Kipling's book.\"    \"But he was in love.\"    \"Yes,\" said Jimmy. \"He was. That's the bacillus, you know.\"    She shot a quick glance at him. He became suddenly interesting to  her. She was at the age of dreams and speculations. From being  merely an ordinary young man with rather more ease of manner than  the majority of the young men she had met, he developed in an  instant into something worthy of closer attention. He took on a  certain mystery and romance. She wondered what sort of girl it was  that he loved. Examining him in the light of this new discovery, she  found him attractive. Something seemed to have happened to put her  in sympathy with him. She noticed for the first time a latent  forcefulness behind the pleasantness of his manner. His self-possession  was the self-possession of the man who has been tried and  has found himself.    At the bottom of her consciousness, too, there was a faint stirring  of some emotion, which she could not analyze, not unlike pain. It  was vaguely reminiscent of the agony of loneliness which she had  experienced as a small child on the rare occasions when her father  had been busy and distrait, and had shown her by his manner that she  was outside his thoughts. This was but a pale suggestion of that  misery; nevertheless, there was a resemblance. It was a rather  desolate, shut-out sensation, half-resentful.    It was gone in a moment. But it had been there. It had passed over  her heart as the shadow of a cloud moves across a meadow in the  summer-time.    For some moments, she stood without speaking. Jimmy did not break  the silence. He was looking at her with an appeal in his eyes. Why  could she not understand? She must understand.    But the eyes that met his were those of a child.    As they stood there, the horse, which had been cropping in a  perfunctory manner at the short grass by the roadside, raised its  head, and neighed impatiently. There was something so human about  the performance that Jimmy and the girl laughed simultaneously. The  utter materialism of the neigh broke the spell. It was a noisy  demand for food.    \"Poor Dandy!\" said Molly. \"He knows he's near home, and he knows  it's his dinner-time.\"    \"Are we near the castle, then?\"    \"It's a long way round by the road, but we can cut across the  fields. Aren't these English fields and hedges just perfect! I love  them. Of course, I loved America, but--\"    \"Have you left New York long?\" asked Jimmy.    \"We came over here about a month after you were at our house.\"    \"You didn't spend much time there, then.\"    \"Father had just made a good deal of money in Wall Street. He must  have been making it when I was on the Lusitania. He wanted to leave  New York, so we didn't wait. We were in London all the winter. Then,  we went over to Paris. It was there we met Sir Thomas Blunt and Lady  Julia. Have you met them? They are Lord Dreever's uncle and aunt.\"    \"I've met Lady Julia.\"    \"Do you like her?\"    Jimmy hesitated.    \"Well, you see--\"    \"I know. She's your hostess, but you haven't started your visit yet.  So, you've just got time to say what you really think of her, before  you have to pretend she's perfect.\"    \"Well--\"    \"I detest her,\" said Molly, crisply. \"I think she's hard and  hateful.\"    \"Well, I can't say she struck me as a sort of female Cheeryble  Brother. Lord Dreever introduced me to her at the station. She  seemed to bear it pluckily, but with some difficulty.\"    \"She's hateful,\" repeated Molly. \"So is he, Sir Thomas, I mean. He's  one of those fussy, bullying little men. They both bully poor Lord  Dreever till I wonder he doesn't rebel. They treat him like a  school-boy. It makes me wild. It's such a shame--he's so nice and  good-natured! I am so sorry for him!\"    Jimmy listened to this outburst with mixed feelings. It was sweet of  her to be so sympathetic, but was it merely sympathy? There had been  a ring in her voice and a flush on her cheek that had suggested to  Jimmy's sensitive mind a personal interest in the down-trodden peer.  Reason told him that it was foolish to be jealous of Lord Dreever, a  good fellow, of course, but not to be taken seriously. The primitive  man in him, on the other hand, made him hate all Molly's male  friends with an unreasoning hatred. Not that he hated Lord Dreever:  he liked him. But he doubted if he could go on liking him for long  if Molly were to continue in this sympathetic strain.    His affection for the absent one was not put to the test. Molly's  next remark had to do with Sir Thomas.    \"The worst of it is,\" she said, \"father and Sir Thomas are such  friends. In Paris, they were always together. Father did him a very  good turn.\"    \"How was that?\"    \"It was one afternoon, just after we arrived. A man got into Lady  Julia's room while we were all out except father. Father saw him go  into the room, and suspected something was wrong, and went in after  him. The man was trying to steal Lady Julia's jewels. He had opened  the box where they were kept, and was actually holding her rope of  diamonds in his hand when father found him. It's the most  magnificent thing I ever saw. Sir Thomas told father he gave a  hundred thousand dollars for it.\"    \"But, surely,\" said Jimmy, \"hadn't the management of the hotel a  safe for valuables?\"    \"Of course, they had; but you don't know Sir Thomas. He wasn't going  to trust any hotel safe. He's the sort of a man who insists on doing  everything in his own way, and who always imagines he can do things  better himself than anyone else can do them for him. He had had this  special box made, and would never keep the diamonds anywhere else.  Naturally, the thief opened it in a minute. A clever thief would  have no difficulty with a thing like that.\"    \"What happened?\"    \"Oh, the man saw father, and dropped the jewels, and ran off down  the corridor. Father chased him a little way, but of course it was  no good; so he went back and shouted, and rang every bell he could  see, and gave the alarm; but the man was never found. Still, he left  the diamonds. That was the great thing, after all. You must look at  them to-night at dinner. They really are wonderful. Are you a judge  of precious stones at all?\"    \"I am rather,\" said Jimmy. \"In fact, a jeweler I once knew told me I  had a natural gift in that direction. And so, of course, Sir Thomas  was pretty grateful to your father?\"    \"He simply gushed. He couldn't do enough for him. You see, if the  diamonds had been stolen, I'm sure Lady Julia would have made Sir  Thomas buy her another rope just as good. He's terrified of her, I'm  certain. He tries not to show it, but he is. And, besides having to  pay another hundred thousand dollars, he would never have heard the  last of it. It would have ruined his reputation for being infallible  and doing everything better than anybody else.\"    \"But didn't the mere fact that the thief got the jewels, and was  only stopped by a fluke from getting away with them, do that?\"    Molly bubbled with laughter.    \"She never knew. Sir Thomas got back to the hotel an hour before she  did.

Both the masses and the feast were attended by the  women. Frequently the guilds also had a religious ceremonial to affirm  their bonds of fidelity. They readily became connected with the  exercise of trades and with the training of apprentices. They promoted  and took on public purposes such as the repairing of roads and bridges,  the relief of pilgrims, the maintenance of schools and almshouses, and  the periodic performance of pageants and miracle plays telling  scriptural history, which could last for several days. The devil often  was prominent in miracle plays.            Many of these London guilds were known by the name of their  founding member. There were also Frith Guilds (peace guilds) and a  Knights' Guild. The Frith Guild's main object was to enforce the King's  laws, especially the prevalent problem of theft. They were especially  established by bishops and reeves. Members met monthly and contributed  about 4d. to a common fund, which paid a compensation for items stolen.  They each paid 1s. towards the pursuit of the thief. The members were  grouped in tens. Members with horses were to track the thief. Members  without horses worked in the place of the absent horse owners until  their return. When caught, the thief was tried and executed.  Overwhelming force was used if his kindred tried to protect him. His  property was used to compensate the victim for his loss and then  divided between the thief's wife, if she was innocent, the King, and  the guild. Owners of slaves paid into a fund to give one half  compensation to those who lost slaves by theft or escape, and  recaptured slaves were to be stoned to death or hanged. The members of  the peace guild also feasted and drank together. When one died, the  others each sang a song or paid for the singing of fifty psalms for his  soul and gave a loaf.            The Knights' Guild was composed of thirteen military persons to  whom King Edgar granted certain waste land in the east of London,  toward Aldgate, and also Portsoken, which ran outside the eastern wall  of the city to the Thames, for prescribed services performed, probably  defense of the vulnerable east side of the city. This concession was  confirmed by King Edward the Confessor in a charter at the suit of  certain citizens of London, the successors of these knights. Edward  granted them sake and soke, the right to hold a court for the offender  and to receive the profits of jurisdiction, over their men.            Edward the Confessor made these rules for London:    1. Be it known that within the space of three miles from all parts  outside of the city a man ought not to hold or hinder another, and also  should not do business with him if he wish to come to the city under  its peace. But when he arrives in the city, then let the market be the  same to the rich man as to the poor.    2. Be it also known that a man who is from the court of the king or the  barons ought not to lodge in the house of any citizen of London for  three nights, either by privilege or by custom, except by consent of  the host. For if he force the host to lodge him in his house and there  be killed by the host, let the host choose six from his relatives and  let him as the seventh swear that he killed him for the said cause. And  thus he will remain quit of the murder of the - - deceased towards the  king and relatives and lords of the deceased.    3. And after he has entered the city, let a foreign merchant be lodged  wherever it please him. But if he bring dyed cloth, let him see to it  that he does not sell his merchandise at retail, but that he sell not  less than a dozen pieces at a time. And if he bring pepper, or cumin,  or ginger, or alum, or brasil wood, or resin, or incense, let him sell  not less than fifteen pounds at a time. But if he bring belts, let him  sell not less than a thousand at a - - time. And if he bring cloths of  silk, or wool or linen, let him see that he cut them not, but sell them  whole. But if he bring wax, let him sell not less than one quartanum.  Also a foreign merchant may not buy dyed cloth, nor make the dye in the  city, nor do any work which belongs by right to the citizens.    4. Also no foreign merchant with his partner may set up any market  within the city for reselling goods in the city, nor may he approach a  citizen for making a bargain, nor may he stop longer in the City.            Every week in London there was a folkmote at St. Paul's  churchyard, where majority decision was a tradition. By 1032, it had  lost much of its power to the husting [household assembly in Danish]  court. The folkmote then had responsibility for order and was the sole  authority for proclaiming outlaws. It met three times a year at St.  Paul's churchyard and there acclaimed its sheriff and its justiciar, or  if the king had chosen his officer, heard who was chosen and listened  to his charge. It also yearly arranged the watch and dealt with risks  of fire. It was divided into wards, each governed by an alderman who  presided over the wardmote, and represented his ward at the folkmote.  Each guild became a ward. The chief alderman was the portreeve. London  paid one-eighth of all the taxes of England.            Later in the towns, merchant guilds grew out of charity  associations whose members were bound by oath to each other and got  together for a guild feast every month. Some traders of these merchant  guilds became so prosperous that they became landholders. Many market  places were dominated by a merchant guild, which had a monopoly of the  local trade. In the great mercantile towns all the land and houses  would be held by merchants and their dependents, all freeholders were  connected with a trade, and everyone who had a claim on public office  or magistry would be a member of the guild. The merchant guild could  admit into their guild country villeins, who became freemen if  unclaimed by their lords for a year and a day. Every merchant who had  made three long voyages on his own behalf and at his own cost ranked as  a thegn. There were also some craft guilds composed of handicraftsmen  or artisans. Escaped bonded agricultural workers, poor people, and  traders without land migrated to towns to live, but were not citizens.            Towns were largely self-sufficient, but salt and iron came from  a distance. The King's established in every shire at least one town  with a market place where purchases would be witnessed, and a mint  where reliable money was coined by a moneyer, who put his name on his  coins. There were eight moneyers in London. Coins were issued to be of  value for only a couple of years. Then one had to exchange them for  newly issued ones at a rate of about 10 old for 8 or 9 new. The  difference constituted a tax. Roughly 10% of the people lived in towns.  Some took surnames such as Tanner, Weaver, or Carpenter. Some had  affectionate or derisive nicknames such as clear-hand, fresh friend,  soft bread, foul beard, money taker, or penny purse. Craftsmen in the  1000s included goldsmiths, embroiderers, illuminators of manuscripts,  and armorers.            Edward the Confessor, named such for his piety, was a king of  24 years who was widely respected for his intelligence,  resourcefulness, good judgment, and wisdom. His educated Queen Edith,  whom he relied on for advice and cheerful courage, was a stabilizing  influence on him. They were served by a number of thegns, who had  duties in the household, which was composed of the hall, the courtyard,  and the bedchamber. They were important men - thegns by rank. They were  landholders, often in several areas, and held leading positions in the  shires. They were also priests and clerics, who maintained the  religious services and performed tasks for which literacy was  necessary. Edward was the first king to have a \"Chancellor\", who was  the first great officer of state. He kept a royal seal and was the  chief royal chaplain. He did all the secretarial work of the household  and court, drew up and sealed the royal writs, conducted the king's  correspondence, and kept all the royal accounts. The word \"chancellor\"  signified a screen behind which the secretarial work of the household  was done. He had the special duty of securing and administering the  royal revenue from vacant benefices. The second great office was that  of Treasurer, who headed the Exchequer. The most important royal  officers were the chamberlains, who took care of the royal bedchamber  and adjoining wardrobe used for dressing and storage of valuables, and  the priests. These royal officers had at first been responsible only  for domestic duties, but gradually came to assume public administrative  tasks.            Edward wanted to avoid the pressures and dangers of living in  the rich and powerful City of London. So he rebuilt a monastic church,  an abbey, and a palace at Westminster about two miles upstream. He  started the growth of Westminster as a center of royal and political  power; kings' councils met there. Royal coronations took place at the  abbey. Since Edward traveled a lot, he established a  storehouse-treasury at Winchester to supplement his traveling wardrobe.  At this time, Spanish stallions were imported to improve English  horses. London came to have the largest and best trained army in  England.            The court invited many of the greatest magnates and prelates  [highest ecclesiastical officials, such as bishops] of the land to the  great ecclesiastical festivals, when the king held more solemn courts  and feasted with his vassals for several days.
