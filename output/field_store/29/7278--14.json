For they said that Philip, the  general of his army, had betrayed the royal palace and the Roman forces  that were in Jerusalem, and that it was done by his command. When  Vespasian heard of this report, he rebuked the Tyrians for abusing a man  who was both a king and a friend to the Romans; but he exhorted the king  to send Philip to Rome, to answer for what he had done before Nero. But  when Philip was sent thither, he did not come into the sight of Nero,  for he found him very near death, on account of the troubles that then  happened, and a civil war; and so he returned to the king. But when  Vespasian was come to Ptolemais, the chief men of Decapolis of Syria  made a clamor against Justus of Tiberias, because he had set their  villages on fire: so Vespasian delivered him to the king, to be put to  death by those under the king's jurisdiction; yet did the king only put  him into bonds, and concealed what he had done from Vespasian, as I have  before related. But the people of Sepphoris met Vespasian, and saluted  him, and had forces sent him, with Placidus their commander: he also  went up with them, as I also followed them, till Vespasian came into  Galilee. As to which coming of his, and after what manner it was  ordered, and how he fought his first battle with me near the village  Taricheae, and how from thence they went to Jotapata, and how I was  taken alive, and bound, and how I was afterward loosed, with all that  was done by me in the Jewish war, and during the siege of Jerusalem,  I have accurately related them in the books concerning the War of the  Jews. However, it will, I think, be fit for me to add now an account of  those actions of my life which I have not related in that book of the  Jewish war.    75. For when the siege of Jotapata was over, and I was among the Romans,  I was kept with much Care, by means of the great respect that Vespasian  showed me. Moreover, at his command, I married a virgin, who was from  among the captives of that country [25] yet did she not live with me  long, but was divorced, upon my being freed from my bonds, and my going  to Alexandria. However, I married another wife at Alexandria, and was  thence sent, together with Titus, to the siege of Jerusalem, and was  frequently in danger of being put to death; while both the Jews were  very desirous to get me under their power, in order to haw me punished.  And the Romans also, whenever they were beaten, supposed that it was  occasioned by my treachery, and made continual clamors to the emperors,  and desired that they would bring me to punishment, as a traitor to  them: but Titus Caesar was well acquainted with the uncertain fortune  of war, and returned no answer to the soldiers' vehement solicitations  against me. Moreover, when the city Jerusalem was taken by force, Titus  Caesar persuaded me frequently to take whatsoever I would of the ruins  of my country; and did that he gave me leave so to do. But when my  country was destroyed, I thought nothing else to be of any value, which  I could take and keep as a comfort under my calamities; so I made this  request to Titus, that my family might have their liberty: I had also  the holy books by Titus's concession. Nor was it long after that I  asked of him the life of my brother, and of fifty friends with him, and  was not denied. When I also went once to the temple, by the permission  of Titus, where there were a great multitude of captive women and  children, I got all those that I remembered as among my own friends  and acquaintances to be set free, being in number about one hundred  and ninety; and so I delivered them without their paying any price of  redemption, and restored them to their former fortune. And when I was  sent by Titus Caesar with Cerealins, and a thousand horsemen, to a  certain village called Thecoa, in order to know whether it were a place  fit for a camp, as I came back, I saw many captives crucified, and  remembered three of them as my former acquaintance. I was very sorry at  this in my mind, and went with tears in my eyes to Titus, and told him  of them; so he immediately commanded them to be taken down, and to have  the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet two of  them died under the physician's hands, while the third recovered.    76. But when Titus had composed the troubles in Judea, and conjectured  that the lands which I had in Judea would bring me no profit, because a  garrison to guard the country was afterward to pitch there, he gave me  another country in the plain. And when he was going away to Rome, he  made choice of me to sail along with him, and paid me great respect: and  when we were come to Rome, I had great care taken of me by Vespasian;  for he gave me an apartment in his own house, which he lived in before  he came to the empire. He also honored me with the privilege of a Roman  citizen, and gave me an annual pension; and continued to respect me to  the end of his life, without any abatement of his kindness to me; which  very thing made me envied, and brought me into danger; for a certain  Jew, whose name was Jonathan, who had raised a tumult in Cyrene, and  had persuaded two thousand men of that country to join with him, was the  occasion of their ruin. But when he was bound by the governor of that  country, and sent to the emperor, he told him that I had sent him both  weapons and money. However, he could not conceal his being a liar from  Vespasian, who condemned him to die; according to which sentence he was  put to death. Nay, after that, when those that envied my good fortune  did frequently bring accusations against me, by God's providence I  escaped them all. I also received from Vespasian no small quantity of  land, as a free gift, in Judea; about which time I divorced my wife  also, as not pleased with her behavior, though not till she had been  the mother of three children, two of whom are dead, and one whom I named  Hyrcanus, is alive. After this I married a wife who had lived at Crete,  but a Jewess by birth: a woman she was of eminent parents, and such as  were the most illustrious in all the country, and whose character was  beyond that of most other women, as her future life did demonstrate. By  her I had two sons; the elder's name was Justus, and the next Simonides,  who was also named Agrippa. And these were the circumstances of my  domestic affairs. However, the kindness of the emperor to me continued  still the same; for when Vespasian was dead, Titus, who succeeded him  in the government, kept up the same respect for me which I had from his  father; and when I had frequent accusations laid against me, he would  not believe them. And Domitian, who succeeded, still augmented his  respects to me; for he punished those Jews that were my accusers, and  gave command that a servant of mine, who was a eunuch, and my accuser,  should be punished. He also made that country I had in Judea tax free,  which is a mark of the greatest honor to him who hath it; nay, Domitia,  the wife of Caesar, continued to do me kindnesses. And this is the  account of the actions of my whole life; and let others judge of my  character by them as they please. But to thee, O Epaphroditus, [28]  thou most excellent of men! do I dedicate all this treatise of our  Antiquities; and so, for the present, I here conclude the whole.          Footnotes      [Footnote 1: We may hence correct the error of the Latin copy of the  second book Against Apion, sect. 8, [for the Greek is there lost,]  which says, there were then only four tribes or courses of the priests,  instead of twenty-four. Nor is this testimony to be disregarded, as if  Josephus there contradicted what he had affirmed here; because even the  account there given better agrees to twenty-four than to four courses,  while he says that each of those courses contained above 5000 men,  which, multiplied by only four, will make not more than 20,000 priests;  whereas the number 120,000, as multiplied by 24, seems much the most  probable, they being about one-tenth of the whole people, even after the  captivity. See Ezra 2:36-39; Nehemiah 7:39-42; 1 Esdras 5:24, 25, with  Ezra 2;64; Nehemiah 7:66; 1 Esdras 5:41. Nor will this common reading or  notion of but four courses of priests, agree with Josephus's own further  assertion elsewhere, Antiq. B. VII. ch. 14. sect. 7, that David's  partition of the priests into twenty-four courses had continued to that  day.]    [Footnote 2: An eminent example of the care of the Jews about their  genealogies, especially as to the priests. See Against Ap. B. 1 sect.  7.]    [Footnote 3: When Josephus here says, that from sixteen to nineteen, or  for three years, he made trial of the three Jewish sects, the Pharisees,  the Sadducees, and the Essens, and yet says presently, in all our  copies, that he stayed besides with one particular ascetic, called  Banus, with him, and this still before he was nineteen, there is little  room left for his trial of the three other sects. I suppose, therefore,  that for, with him, the old reading might be, with them; which is a very  small emendation, and takes away the difficulty before us. Nor is  Dr. Hudson's conjecture, hinted at by Mr. Hall in his preface to the  Doctor's edition of Josephus, at all improbable, that this Banus, by  this his description, might well be a follower of John the Baptist, and  that from him Josephus might easily imbibe such notions, as afterwards  prepared him to have a favorable opinion of Jesus Christ himself, who  was attested to by John the Baptist.]    [Footnote 4: We may note here, that religious men among the Jews, or at  least those that were priests, were sometimes ascetics also, and, like  Daniel and his companions in Babylon, Daniel 1:8-16, ate no flesh, but  figs and nuts, etc. only. This was like the  austere diet of the  Christian ascetics in Passion-week. Constitut. V. 18.]    [Footnote 5: It has been thought the number of Paul"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2848"],[0,"Antiquities of the Jews (#14)"],[1,"he showed in this his piety, he was  delighted in having bestowed such blessings upon him; and that he would  not be wanting in all sort of concern about him, and in bestowing other  children upon him; and that his son should live to a very great age;  that he should live a happy life, and bequeath a large principality to  his children, who should be good and legitimate.\" He foretold also, that  his family should increase into many nations 29 and that those  patriarchs should leave behind them an everlasting name; that they  should obtain the possession of the land of Canaan, and be envied by all  men. When God had said this, he produced to them a ram, which did not  appear before, for the sacrifice. So Abraham and Isaac receiving each  other unexpectedly, and having obtained the promises of such great  blessings, embraced one another; and when they had sacrificed, they  returned to Sarah, and lived happily together, God affording them his  assistance in all things they desired.              CHAPTER 14. Concerning Sarah Abraham's Wife; And How She Ended Her Days.    Now Sarah died a little while after, having lived one hundred and  twenty-seven years. They buried her in Hebron; the Canaanites publicly  allowing them a burying-place; which piece of ground Abraham bought for  four hundred shekels, of Ephron, an inhabitant of Hebron. And both  Abraham and his descendants built themselves sepulchers in that place.              CHAPTER 15. How The Nation Of The Troglodytes Were Derived From Abraham  By Keturah.    Abraham after this married Keturah, by whom six sons were born to him,  men of courage, and of sagacious minds: Zambran, and Jazar, and Madan,  and Madian, and Josabak, and Sous. Now the sons of Sous were Sabathan  and Dadan. The sons of Dadan were Latusim, and Assur, and Luom. The sons  of Madiau were Ephas, and Ophren, and Anoch, and Ebidas, and Eldas. Now,  for all these sons and grandsons, Abraham contrived to settle them in  colonies; and they took possession of Troglodytis, and the country of  Arabia the Happy, as far as it reaches to the Red Sea. It is related of  this Ophren, that he made war against Libya, and took it, and that his  grandchildren, when they inhabited it, called it [from his name] Africa.  And indeed Alexander Polyhistor gives his attestation to what I here  say; who speaks thus: \"Cleodemus the prophet, who was also called  Malchus, who wrote a History of the Jews, in agreement with the History  of Moses, their legislator, relates, that there were many sons born to  Abraham by Keturah: nay, he names three of them, Apher, and Surim, and  Japhran. That from Surim was the land of Assyria denominated; and that  from the other two [Apher and Japbran] the country of Africa took its  name, because these men were auxiliaries to Hercules, when he fought  against Libya and Antaeus; and that Hercules married Aphra's daughter,  and of her he begat a son, Diodorus; and that Sophon was his son, from  whom that barbarous people called Sophacians were denominated.\"              CHAPTER 16. How Isaac Took Rebeka To Wife.    1. Now when Abraham, the father of Isaac, had resolved to take Rebeka,  who was grand-daughter to his brother Nahor, for a wife to his son  Isaac, who was then about forty years old, he sent the ancientest of his  servants to betroth her, after he had obliged him to give him the  strongest assurances of his fidelity; which assurances were given after  the manner following:They put each other's hands under each other's  thighs; then they called upon God as the witness of what was to be done.  He also sent such presents to those that were there as were in esteem,  on account that that they either rarely or never were seen in that  country, The servant got thither not under a considerable time; for it  requires much time to pass through Meopotamia, in which it is tedious  traveling, both in the winter for the depth of the clay, and in summer  for want of water; and, besides this, for the robberies there committed,  which are not to be avoided by travelers but by caution beforehand.  However, the servant came to Haran; and when he was in the suburbs, he  met a considerable number of maidens going to the water; he therefore  prayed to God that Rebeka might be found among them, or her whom Abraham  sent him as his servant to espouse to his son, in case his will were  that this marriage should be consummated, and that she might be made  known to him by the sign, That while others denied him water to drink,  she might give it him.    2. With this intention he went to the well, and desired the maidens to  give him some water to drink: but while the others refused, on pretense  that they wanted it all at home, and could spare none for him, one only  of the company rebuked them for their peevish behavior towards the  stranger; and said, What is there that you will ever communicate to  anybody, who have not so much as given the man some water? She then  offered him water in an obliging manner. And now he began to hope that  his grand affair would succeed; but desiring still to know the truth, he  commended her for her generosity and good nature, that she did not  scruple to afford a sufficiency of water to those that wanted it, though  it cost her some pains to draw it; and asked who were her parents, and  wished them joy of such a daughter. \"And mayst thou be espoused,\" said  he, \"to their satisfaction, into the family of an agreeable husband, and  bring him legitimate children.\" Nor did she disdain to satisfy his  inquiries, but told him her family. \"They,\" says she, \"call me Rebeka;  my father was Bethuel, but he is dead; and Laban is my brother; and,  together with my mother, takes care of all our family affairs, and is  the guardian of my virginity.\" When the servant heard this, he was very  glad at what had happened, and at what was told him, as perceiving that  God had thus plainly directed his journey; and producing his bracelets,  and some other ornaments which it was esteemed decent for virgins to  wear, he gave them to the damsel, by way of acknowledgment, and as a  reward for her kindness in giving him water to drink; saying, it was but  just that she should have them, because she was so much more obliging  than any of the rest. She desired also that he would come and lodge with  them, since the approach of the night gave him not time to proceed  farther. And producing his precious ornaments for women, he said he  desired to trust them to none more safely than to such as she had shown  herself to be; and that he believed he might guess at the humanity of  her mother and brother, that they would not be displeased, from the  virtue he found in her; for he would not be burdensome, but would pay  the hire for his entertainment, and spend his own money. To which she  replied, that he guessed right as to the humanity of her parents; but  complained that he should think them so parsimonious as to take money,  for that he should have all on free cost. But she said she would first  inform her brother Laban, and, if he gave her leave, she would conduct  him in.    3. As soon then as this was over, she introduced the stranger; and for  the camels, the servants of Laban brought them in, and took care of  them; and he was himself brought in to supper by Laban. And, after  supper, he says to him, and to the mother of the damsel, addressing  himself to her, \"Abraham is the son of Terah, and a kinsman of yours;  for Nahor, the grandfather of these children, was the brother of  Abraham, by both father and mother; upon which account he hath sent me  to you, being desirous to take this damsel for his son to wife. He is  his legitimate son, and is brought up as his only heir. He could indeed  have had the most happy of all the women in that country for him, but he  would not have his son marry any of them; but, out of regard to his own  relations, he desired him to match here, whose affection and inclination  I would not have you despise; for it was by the good pleasure of God  that other accidents fell out in my journey, and that thereby I lighted  upon your daughter and your house; for when I was near to the city, I  saw a great many maidens coming to a well, and I prayed that I might  meet with this damsel, which has come to pass accordingly. Do you  therefore confirm that marriage, whose espousals have been already made  by a Divine appearance; and show the respect you have for Abraham, who  hath sent me with so much solicitude, in giving your consent to the  marriage of this damsel.\" Upon this they understood it to be the will of  God, and greatly approved of the offer, and sent their daughter, as was  desired. Accordingly Isaac married her, the inheritance being now come  to him; for the children by Keturah were gone to their own remote  habitations.              CHAPTER 17. Concerning The Death Of Abraham.    A Little while after this Abraham died. He was a man of incomparable  virtue, and honored by God in a manner agreeable to his piety towards  him. The whole time of his life was one hundred seventy and five years,  and he was buried in Hebron, with his wife Sarah, by their sons Isaac  and Ismael.              CHAPTER 18. Concerning The Sons Of Isaac, Esau And Jacob; Of Their  Nativity And Education.    1. Now Isaac's wife proved with child, after the death of Abraham; 30  and when her belly was greatly burdened, Isaac was very anxious, and  inquired of God; who answered, that Rebeka should bear twins; and that  two nations should take the names of those sons; and that he who  appeared the second should excel the elder. Accordingly she, in a little  time, as God had foretold, bare twins; the elder of whom, from his head  to his feet, was very rough and hairy; but the younger took hold of his  heel as they were in the birth. Now the father loved the elder, who was  called Esau, a name agreeable to his roughness, for the Hebrews call  such a hairy roughness [Esau, 31 or] Seir;"]]]
