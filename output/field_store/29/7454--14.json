Volume 1 (#14)"],[1,"had been kindly treated by the settlers, and told that at one of the  neighbouring islands 1,700 seals had been captured in one season. Telling  this to a brother when he at last reached home in the Fatherland, the two  of them, fired with the ambition of acquiring money quickly, determined to  exile themselves for a while to the islands. By taking passage on an  outward-bound steamer from Southampton, and later transferring themselves  to a whaler, they reached their destination in safety on the 27th of  November, 1871. They had purchased an old whale-boat--mast, sails, and oars  complete--and landed with a fair supply of flour, biscuit, coffee, tea,  sugar, salt, and tobacco, sufficient for present needs. They had blankets  and some covers, which were easily filled with bird's feathers--a German  could hardly forget his national luxury, his feather-bed. They had  provided themselves with a wheelbarrow, sundry tools, pot and kettles; a  short Enfield rifle, and an old fowling-piece, and a very limited supply  of powder, bullets, and shot. They had also sensibly provided themselves  with some seeds, so that, all in all, they started life on the island  under favourable circumstances.    The west side of the island, on which they landed, consisted of a beach  some three miles in length, with a bank of earth, covered with the strong  long tussock grass, rising to the cliff, which it was just possible to  scale. The walls of rock by which the island is bounded afforded few  opportunities for reaching the comparatively level plateau at the top.  Without the aid of the grass it was impossible, and in one place, which  had to be climbed constantly, it took them an hour and a half of hard  labour, holding on with hands and feet, and _even teeth_, to reach the  summit. Meantime, they had found on the north side a suitable place for  building their hut, near a waterfall that fell from the side of the  mountain, and close to a wood, from which they could obtain all the  firewood they required. Their humble dwelling was partly constructed of  spars from the vessel that had brought them to the island, and was  thatched with grass. About this time (December) the seals were landing in  the coast, it being the pupping season, and they killed nineteen. In  hunting them their whale-boat, which was too heavy for two men to handle,  was seriously damaged in landing through the surf; but yet, with constant  bailing, could be kept afloat. A little later they cut it in halves, and  constructed from the best parts a smaller boat, which was christened the  _Sea Cart_. During the summer rains their house became so leaky that they  pulled it down, and shifted their quarters to another spot. At the  beginning of April the tussock grass, by which they had ascended the  cliff, caught fire, and their means of reaching game, in the shape of wild  pigs and goats, was cut off. Winter (about our summer-time, as in  Australia, &c.) was approaching, and it became imperative to think of  laying in provisions. By means of the _Sea Cart_ they went round to the  west side, and succeeded in killing two goats and a pig, the latter of  which furnished a bucket of fat for frying potatoes. The wild boars there  were found to be almost uneatable; but the sows were good eating. The  goats' flesh was said to be very delicate. An English ship passed them far  out at sea, and they lighted a fire to attract attention, but in vain;  while the surf was running too high, and their _Cart_ too shaky to attempt  to reach it.    Hitherto they had experienced no greater hardships than they had expected,  and were prepared for. But in June [mid-winter] their boat was, during a  storm, washed off the beach, and broken up. This was to them a terrible  disaster; their old supplies were exhausted, and they were practically cut  off from not merely the world in general, but even the rest of the island.  They got weaker and weaker, and by August were little better than two  skeletons.    The sea was too tempestuous, and the distance too great for them to  attempt to swim round (as they afterwards did) to another part of the  island. But succour was at hand; they were saved by the penguins, a very  clumsy form of relief. The female birds came ashore in August to lay their  eggs in the nests already prepared by their lords and masters, the male  birds, who had landed some two or three weeks previously. Our good Germans  had divided their last potato, and were in a very weak and despondent  condition when the pleasant fact stared them in the face that they might  now fatten on eggs _ad libitum_. Their new diet soon put fresh heart and  courage in them, and when, early in September, a French bark sent a boat  ashore, they determined still to remain on the island. They arranged with  the captain for the sale of their seal-skins, and bartered a quantity of  eggs for some biscuit and a couple of pounds of tobacco. Late in October a  schooner from the Cape of Good Hope called at the island, and on leaving,  promised to return for them, as they had decided to quit the island, not  having had any success in obtaining peltries or anything else that is  valuable; but she did not re-appear, and in November their supplies were  again at starvation-point. Selecting a calm day, the two Crusoes  determined to swim round the headland to the eastward, taking with them  their rifles and blankets, and towing after them an empty oil-barrel  containing their clothes, powder, matches, and kettle. This they repeated  later on several occasions, and, climbing the cliffs by the tussock grass,  were able to kill or secure on the plateau a few of the wild pigs.  Sometimes one of them only would mount, and after killing a pig would cut  it up and lower the hams to his brother below. They caught three little  sucking-pigs, and towed them alive through the waves, round the point of  their landing-place, where they arrived half drowned. They were put in an  enclosure, and fed on green stuff and penguin's eggs--good feeding for a  delicate little porker. Attempting on another occasion to tow a couple in  the same way, the unfortunate pigs met a watery grave in the endeavour to  weather the point, and one of the brothers barely escaped, with some few  injuries, through a terrible surf which was beating on their part of the  coast. Part of their time was passed in a cave during the cold weather.  When the _Challenger_ arrived their only rifle had burst in two places,  and was of little use, while their musket was completely burst in all  directions, and was being used as a blow-pipe to freshen the fire when it  got low. Their only knives had been made by themselves from an old saw.  Their library consisted of eight books and an atlas, and these, affording  their only literary recreation for two years, they knew almost literally  by heart. When they first landed they had a dog and two pups, which they,  doubtless, hoped would prove something like companions. The dogs almost  immediately left, and made for the penguin rookeries, where they killed  and worried the birds by hundreds. One of them became mad, and the  brothers thought it best to shoot the three of them. Captain Nares gave  the two Crusoes a passage to the Cape, where one of them obtained a good  situation; the other returned to Germany, doubtless thinking that about a  couple of dozen seal-skins--all they obtained--was hardly enough to reward  them for their two years' dreary sojourn on Inaccessible Island.

Dr. Johnson, whose personal weight seems to have had something to do with  that carried by his opinion, considered going to sea a species of  insanity.(30) \"No man,\" said he, \"will be a sailor who has contrivance  enough to get himself into a jail: for being in a ship is being in a jail,  with the chance of being drowned.\" The great lexicographer knew Fleet  Street better than he did the fleet, and his opinion, as expressed above,  was hardly even decently patriotic or sensible. Had all men thought as he  professed to do--probably for the pleasure of saying something ponderously  brilliant for the moment--we should have had no naval or commercial  superiority to-day--in short, no England.    The dangers of the sea are serious enough, but need not be exaggerated.  One writer(31) indeed, in serio-comic vein, makes his sailors sing in a  gale--      \"When you and I, Bill, on the deck      Are comfortably lying,    My eyes! what tiles and chimney-pots      About their heads are flying!\"    leading us to infer that the dangers of town-life are greater than those  of the sea in a moderate gale. We might remind the reader that Mark Twain  has conclusively shown, from statistics, that more people die in bed  comfortably at home than are killed by all the railroad, steamship, or  other accidents in the world, the inference being that going to bed is a  dangerous habit! But the fact is, that wherever there is danger there will  be brave men found to face it--even when it takes the desperate form just  indicated! So that there is nothing surprising in the fact that in all  times there have been men ready to go to sea.

Available measurements of three, of  the four _T. aurispinosa_, resemble those given by Carter and Davis  (_op. cit._) for their specimens. Measurements of the fourth cranium  are smaller (greatest length of skull, 19.4; zygomatic breadth, 11.1;  interorbital constriction, 3.7; cranial breadth, 9.1; mastoid breadth,  10.7; basal length, 16.3; length of maxillary tooth-row, 7.4; breadth  across M3, 7.9), but not outside the expected range of individual  variation if we can judge by the range recorded by Jones and Alvarez  (1962) for the related _Tadarida laticaudata_.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 4, from [Cueva       del Abra], 6 mi.

Specimens from three miles south and 16 miles west of Piedra were found  in a crevice inside a cave. Two days previously _Desmodus rotundus_ and  _Natalus stramineus_ were obtained from the same cave. All other  specimens from the Sierra de Tamaulipas were caught in mist nets.  _Nycticeus humeralis_, _Myotis velifer_, _Eptesicus fuscus_, _Lasiurus  borealis_ and _L. intermedius_ were taken in nets that also captured  _T. laticaudata_.    All specimens taken (June 19-23) in the Sierra de Tamaulipas were  females, except one. Of 33 females taken, 27 carried a single embryo  each, the embryos averaging 27.0 (25-28) mm. in crown-rump length; the  other five were lactating. Weight of the pregnant females averaged 16.0  (13-18) grams and that of the five lactating individuals averaged 13.0  (12-14) grams. A male weighed 22 grams.    For the taxonomic status of this species in North America see Jones and  Alvarez (1962).         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 65: Sierra de       Tamaulipas, 2 mi. S, 10 mi.

At Rancho Pano Ayuctle, according to the field notes of the collector  (Schaldach), the red mastiff bat was common, and found daytime retreats  in hollows in cypress trees. Schaldach twice found groups of bats in  such hollows. _M. a. nigricans_ is an early forager and most  individuals seen were in flight before sunset, usually flying in a more  or less straight line at heights of 25 to 60 feet above the ground. The  odor of the chest gland was described by Schaldach as \"strong\" and  \"geranium-like.\" A female obtained three miles northeast of Guemes on  August 19 carried a single embryo that was 33 mm. in crown-rump length.    Specimens examined average slightly smaller than the type specimen,  especially in total length, length of hind foot, length of skull and  length of maxillary tooth-row. Davis (1951:219) also noted some of  these same differences in a specimen examined by him from two miles  south of Ciudad Victoria. The variation in color is great among  Tamaulipan specimens. Of the 15 examined, two are Dark Mummy Brown, six  are Mummy Brown, six are Sudan Brown, and one is paler than Sudan  Brown.

No specimens of this monkey have been taken in Tamaulipas although  Kellogg and Goldman (1944:34) pointed out that it probably occurred in  the tropical forest of the southern part of the state. Later, Villa  (1958:347) reported that A. Malaga Alba saw monkeys in 1954 at  Barranca de Caballeros, approximately 25 kilometers north-northwest of  Ciudad Victoria. No other report of their occurrence in the state has  been forthcoming.      =Dasypus novemcinctus mexicanus= Peters    Nine-banded Armadillo         1864. _Dasypus novemcinctus_ var. _mexicanus_ Peters,       Montsb. preuss Akad.

A 13-pound female from four kilometers west-southwest of La Purisima  was captured after it was forced by the collector (Dalquest) and his  dog out of the burrow that was under a log. A young specimen examined  from seven kilometers southwest of La Purisima was captured by a dog. A  partial skeleton including the skull was picked up on the barrier beach  at a place 33 miles south of Washington Beach.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 3 (see text       immediately above).

This species occurs only in western Tamaulipas. Hall and Kelson  (1959:267, map 187) mistakenly plotted El Mulato, as being in the  eastern part of the state; actually this locality is in the San Carlos  Mountains of the west, near the boundary between Tamaulipas and Nuevo  Leon.         _Records of occurrence._--One specimen examined from 4 mi.

Specimens from 10 kilometers north and eight kilometers west  of El Encino and 70 kilometers south of Ciudad Victoria, judging by  their large size, dark color, and ochraceous brown (rather than pale  ochraceous as in _S. f. chapmani_) upper sides of the hind feet are  assignable to _connectens_.    Goodwin (1954:7) reported specimens from Chamal, Joya de Salas, Gomez  Farias, and Pano Ayuctle as _S. f. chapmani_, remarking that they were  intergrades between _chapmani_ and _connectens_. Specimens reported by  Goodwin are here assigned to _S. f. connectens_ because the  measurements of the specimen from eight kilometers west of El Encino  are typical of that"]]]
