[Illustration]           *       *       *       *       *          NEW PHOTOGLYPTIC PROCESS.[1]    [Footnote 1: A communication to the Photographic Society of France.]      WALTER B. WOODBURY.    It is now thirteen years since I had the honor of introducing in  France my new photoglyptic process, which, up to the present time, has  remained in the hands of very few, owing to the great expense hitherto  necessary to start the working of it. For some time I have been  engaged in making experiments with a view to discover a system which  should be at the same time simple and inexpensive; and the process  which I have this evening the honor to bring before your notice is the  result of my researches.    The summary of the new system is as follows:    To obtain from negatives reliefs on glass similar to transparencies by  the carbon process, but modified in the quantity of materials used.    To attach, and keep in absolute contact with the relief so obtained, a  sheet of tin foil.    To solidify this sheet of tinfoil by coating it with copper; then  backing it up with another sheet of plate glass covered with a  composition; and then to detach the whole from the first relief--the  result being a mould ready to place in the press and print one  thousand or more proofs.    I commence by showing you the relief made from the negative, and  explaining how this is obtained.    I take a sheet of plate glass of a convenient size, and place it in  hot water, together with a sheet of paper a little smaller; then,  having driven out the excess of water by means of a squeegee, I  place it on a leveling stand. Having prepared a solution composed of  gelatine 200 parts, water 1,000 parts, glycerine 20 parts, white sugar  30 parts, with a little Indian ink, and filtered the same, I pour a  sufficient quantity on the paper and spread it up to the corners with  the finger. These plates are then dried in a dry place and can be kept  until wanted.    To sensitize the plates I employ a bath of bichromate of potash of  six per cent., and again dry them. Without doubt this method is rather  long; but one should consider that each proof made is capable of  giving five or ten thousand prints if necessary, as the same relief  will make many printing moulds. I tried, with the aid of the Autotype  Company, of London, to get a suitable tissue; but as this requires  a uniform thickness of half a millimeter the ordinary system did not  succeed. When the sensitized plate is dry the edges are cut with a  knife, the glasses serving over and over again. I show you a piece of  this prepared paper.    As in the carbon process, it is necessary to place a border of black  paper at the back of the negative, and to cut the sensitized tissue a  little larger than the opening.    After the exposure the gelatine is fixed on a collodionized glass by  placing them both in water and squeegeeing the surface; but in dry  weather it is as well to use albumen in place of collodion, as used  by M. Ferrier for his transparencies in carbon. The glass holding the  gelatine is now placed in a hot water bath heated to 42 deg. Centigrade,  and left till the paper comes away from the gelatine, when it is  placed in this apparatus by the frame holding the grooves.    By means of this small gas regulator the temperature is kept always  the same, namely, 50 deg. Centigrade. The water should be now and then  agitated by lifting up and down the frame holding the glasses.    After a space of three or four hours the reliefs will be sufficiently  washed, and can be taken out and placed in alcohol to dry quickly  and sharp at the same time. In this stage of the process all spots or  scratches that may have been on the negative can be removed (being in  relief on the gelatine) by means of a piece of glass. The relief is  now ready to be covered with the tin. You will observe that up to the  present the operations have been almost the same as those necessary to  produce a transparency in carbon.    As it is of the first necessity that the tin should be kept in  absolute contact with the gelatine relief, I prepare the latter by  rubbing it over with a piece of flannel charged with a greasy matter  (pomatum answers as well as anything). I then make a border of  India-rubber in benzine round the glass. The effect of this is to  prevent any air from returning between the tin and the relief when  once it has been driven out.    Taking care that the back of the glass is perfectly clean, it is now  placed on the steel or glass bed of a rolling-press. A sheet of tin  foil (without holes) that has been smoothed on a sheet of glass by a  soft brush is now laid on it, and then three or four thicknesses of  blotting paper. The whole is then passed under the cylinder several  times, each time increasing the pressure. The surface of the tin  is now ready to place in the electrotyping cell, but must first be  cleaned with a solution of caustic potash to remove any grease, and  bordered with shellac varnish to prevent the copper from depositing  where not required.    Electric contact is made by means of the small apparatus, on removing  a small proportion of the lac varnish. After two or three hours  sufficient copper will have been deposited, and after drying can be  then attached to another glass, on which it will remain.    This glass is covered while hot with a composition of shellac, resin,  and Venice turpentine, and can be prepared in advance, using an iron  plate heated direct by the gas flame. The same iron plate is employed  to again soften the composition and attach it to the copper; but this  time heated only by boiling water, this temperature being sufficient  to soften it until it enters into all the hollows of the copper. On  placing a weight on the two glasses the excess of the composition is  forced out at the edges. When cold the glass plate on which the copper  and tin are now attached can be separated from the relief, which can  then be used over and over again to produce fresh matrices.    The matrix or intaglio is now ready to place in the printing press,  and the remaining operations of printing are exactly the same as those  used in the old process of photoglyptic printing.    In placing the mould in the press it is advisable to place one or  two thicknesses of stout blotting paper, previously wetted, under the  mould to give to it a slight amount of elasticity and, at the same  time, to keep it in place.    As in all other mechanical processes a reversed or pellicle negative  is required; but it is very simple to print upon a specially prepared  transfer paper, and, instead of mounting the print with the face  uppermost, to attach it under water to the mount, and when dry to  detach the paper on which the print has been made. By this means there  remains only one thickness of paper instead of two, thus doing away  with an objection which has often been found in mounted photographs  for book illustration.           *       *       *       *       *          NEW INVENTIONS.    An improved combined cutting and clinching tool has been patented by  Mr. Peter D. Graham, of Black Hawk, Col. The object of this invention  is to provide a new, useful, and convenient tool for cutting and  clinching horseshoe nails.    Mr. John J. Berger, of Brooklyn, N. Y., has patented an improved  hand perforating or check stamp of the class which are used to cut or  perforate the paper with figures and letters as a safeguard against  alterations of the check; and the object of this improvement is to  perforate the check with needle points, and at the same time ink  the perforations, whereby the numbers may be clearly marked without  cutting large openings in the paper.    An improved apparatus for the manufacture of nitric acid has been  patented by Mr. Paul Marcelin, of Black Rock, Conn. The object of this  invention is to furnish apparatus for manufacturing nitric acid so  constructed that the stronger acid may be separated from the weaker  acid as the acid passes from the retort to the receiving bottles,  to obtain a strong acid suitable for use in manufacturing  nitro-glycerine.    Mr. Max Rubin, of New York city, has patented an improved shawl strap,  so constructed that either strap may be wound up alone, or both may be  wound up together, or one may be wound up tighter than the other, by  adjusting the handle.    Mr. Ambrose Madden, of Asbury Park, N. J., has patented an attachment  for use with halters for preventing horses from cribbing and to  cure them of that pernicious habit; and the invention consists in a  combination of rigid arms and straps hung upon the halter and carrying  a spiked plate, which is retained beneath the animal's under lip in  such manner that the motions of the horse in the act of cribbing cause  the spikes to prick.           *       *       *       *       *          BUSINESS AND PERSONAL.    _The Charge for Insertion under this head is One Dollar a line for  each insertion; about eight words to a line.

So many workers are compelled to remain always on one spot,  in order to keep up the heat that is required for those who are molding  the wax and rearing the brood, that they are unable to erect more than a  single comb; whereas, if they have the least shelter, they will build  four or five more, thereby increasing the wealth and population of the  hive. And so we find that every species of bee that lives in cold and  temperate regions has given up building its hive in exposed places. Its  intelligence has decided that it is better to select more sheltered  spots. But it is none the less true that, in forsaking the open sky that  was so dear to them, and seeking shelter in the hollow of a tree or a  cave, the bees have been guided by what was at first a daring idea,  which came to them through their observation, experience and reasoning.      There can be no doubt that they have made great progress. We have  already mentioned the intelligence they show in using flour instead of  pollen, cement in place of wax. We have seen with what skill they are  able to adapt a new building to their requirements, and the amazing  cleverness they display in the matter of combs made of foundation wax.  They handle these marvelous combs, which are so curiously useful and yet  so incomplete, in the most ingenious fashion, and actually contrive to  meet interfering man half-way.    Imagine for a moment that we had for centuries past been building our  cities, not with bricks, stones and lime, but with a substance as soft  as is the wax secreted by the bees. One day an all-powerful being lifts  us into the air and places us in the midst of a fairy city. We recognize  that it is made of a substance resembling the wax that we have been  using; but, as regards all the rest, we are merely lost and bewildered.  We are called upon to make this city suit our requirements. Each of the  houses in it is so small that our two hands can cover it. We can  distinguish the beginnings of thousands of incomplete walls. There are  many things that we have never come across before; there are gaps to be  filled and joined up with the rest, there are many parts that have to be  propped up and supported. We see a chance of getting things right, but  around us there is nothing but hardship and danger. Some superior  intellect, able to guess at most of our desires, has evidently been at  work, but has been baffled and confused by the vastness and variety of  the necessary details.    It becomes our business, therefore, to disentangle this confusion, to  induce order where now is disorder; we must find out what this superior  intellect wanted us to do; we must build in a few days what would  normally have taken us years; we must alter our methods of labor, we  must change these in accordance with the work that has already been  done. In the meanwhile we must deal with all the problems that arise, we  must meet all the difficulties that the superior intellect had not  foreseen; we must learn how to make the fullest use of the wonderful  opportunities that have been provided. This is more or less what the  bees are doing to-day in our modern hives.    What one may call the local self-government, the bees' methods of  dealing with their own affairs--such as the swarm, for instance, or the  treatment of queens--these vary in every hive. Syrian hives have been  known to produce 120 queens, whereas our own will never rear more than  ten or twelve. In one hive in Syria 120 dead queen-mothers were found,  together with ninety living ones. The bee is capable, too, of altering  her ways, should conditions require it; of changing her methods. Take  one of them to California or Australia, and her habits will become quite  other than when she was in Europe. Having discovered that summer always  abides in the land and that flowers never are absent, she will, after a  time, be content to live from day to day, and gather only honey and  pollen sufficient for her immediate requirements; and her observation  of the new conditions will teach her that it is not necessary to make  provision for the winter. All this she will learn in a year or two; and  in fact it becomes necessary for the bee-keeper to deprive her of the  fruits of her labor, in order to maintain her activity. Similarly it is  said that, in the Barbadoes, the bees in such hives as are close to the  sugar-refineries will entirely cease visiting the flowers, but will  gather their store from the vast quantity of sweets that surround them.      Of wild bees no less than 4500 varieties are known. Some naturalists  believe that the \"Prosopis,\" a little wild bee that is found all over  the world, is the original kind from which all the others have sprung.  This unfortunate little insect is to our domestic bee more or less what  a cave-dweller would be to a highly-civilized man of to-day. You will  probably more than once have seen it, hovering over the bushes in a  deserted corner of your garden, and it will never have occurred to you  that there, fluttering before you, was the first-comer of those to whom  we probably owe most of our flowers and plants; for it is a fact that  more than a hundred varieties of plants would disappear if they were not  regularly visited by the bees.    The prosopis is nimble and not unattractive, the French variety being  elegantly marked with white over a black background. She leads a  miserable life of starvation and solitude. Her body is almost bare; she  has not the warm and sumptuous fleece of her happier sisters. She has no  baskets in which to gather the pollen, no brushes, no towering plumes.  With her tiny claws she must scratch away the powder from the cups of  the flowers; and she must swallow this powder in order to bring it home.  She has no tools to work with, nothing but her tongue, her mouth and her  claws; and her tongue is short, her claws are feeble and her jaws  without strength. Unable to form any wax, to bore holes through wood or  dig in the earth, she builds clumsy galleries in the soft pith of dry  berries; she puts up a few shapeless cells, and stores these with a  little food for the young whom she never will see. And then, having done  all this as best she can, she goes off and dies in some hidden corner,  as lonely now at the end as she has been through all her poor life.      As the bees progress from wildness to civilization, we note that their  tongue gradually lengthens, thus enabling more nectar to be drawn from  the flowers; hairs and tufts grow and develop, and brushes for  collecting the pollen; mandibles and claws become firmer and stronger  and the bees acquire the intellect that enables them to make  improvements in their dwellings. To relate all the different changes  would require a whole volume; I will merely dwell on one or two  instances of their development.    We have seen the unhappy prosopis living her lonely little life in the  midst of this vast and indifferent universe. Some of her more civilized  sisters, who have tools of their own and are skilled in the use of them,  still exist in absolute solitude. If by chance some creature attach  itself to them and share their dwelling, it will be an enemy or, more  often, what is known as a parasite. For the world of bees contains many  strange phantoms; and there are some species which will have a kind of  indolent double, a creature exactly similar to the victim it has chosen  to live with, save only that its uninterrupted idleness has caused it to  lose one by one its implements of labor. It never works, or tries to  work, it collects no food itself, but lives on that which is painfully  got together by the unfortunate bee on whom it has fastened.    Little by little, by slow degrees and slow stages, the bees advance in  civilization and intellect till we find them dwelling together in the  regular life of a city. They have abandoned their solitude, their  isolation; their existence, formerly so narrow and incomplete, has now  become more assured, more concerned with the existence of those round  about them. Instead of thinking only of their own offspring, they have  learned that they must devote themselves to the race, that they must  live and work together in order to make the future sure and safe.      There are certain building-bees which dig holes in the earth, and unite  in large colonies to construct their nests. Between the individual  members of the crowd, however, there is no communication and no  understanding; they join together in a common task, but each one thinks  only of her own particular interest. A little higher up in the scale we  come to a race of bees, known as the Panurgi, who seem to have  recognized the advantage of living and working as one community. They  build in the same haphazard fashion as the others, each one digging its  own underground chambers, but the entrance is common to all, as is also  the gallery which winds from the surface to the different cells below.  Here we find the idea of fellowship beginning to penetrate into the  life of the bee, and it progresses with their civilization. As this  increases, their manners and methods soften; what was formerly a mere  instinct, due to the fear of cold and hunger, has become an active  intelligence, working in the interests of life.      The bumble-bees, the great, hairy creatures that are so familiar to us  all, so inoffensive although they appear so fierce, begin their life in  solitude. In the first days of March the mother-bee, who has survived  the winter, will start to construct her nest, either underground or in a  bush, according to the species to which she belongs. She is alone in the  world, and around her is only the miracle of awakening spring. She  chooses a spot that seems favorable; she clears the rubbish away, digs  down and builds her cells. Into these, which will have no special shape  of their own, she will store the honey and pollen that she"]]]
