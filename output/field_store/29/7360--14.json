They are nocturnal animals and are seldom seen by daylight. In their  travels they follow the streams mostly, and catch fish by feeling under  the stones in shallow water. Whenever possible, they wash their food  before eating.    The raccoon has a peculiar cry, which is heard sometimes, on still  nights, during the summer. It is a quavering note somewhat resembling  that of the screech owl, but lower and softer, and seems to come from a  distance, though really close by. To one inexperienced in the ways of  this animal, the cry would not be recognized.    The fur of the raccoon meets with ready sale at fair prices, and there  is also sale for the flesh in many markets. There is considerable  difference in color in individual animals, some of them being very dark,  and others quite pale. Of course the northern animals are more heavily  furred than those of the south.    The darker and larger specimens, as a rule, are secured in the northern  states--New York, Pennsylvania, Northern Ohio, Northern Indiana,  Northern Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest. The  greatest numbers, but smaller and lighter colored, are secured from the  southern states, those bordering on the Gulf of Mexico, Tennessee,  Arkansas, Missouri, and Kentucky.    While raccoon can be raised in nearly all parts of America, the best  furred specimens can only be raised where the climate is productive of  good fur,--say north of 40 degrees. This would be on a line passing  through Philadelphia, south of Pittsburg, just north of Columbus,  through Central Indiana and Illinois, northern Missouri, boundary  between Kansas and Nebraska, north of Denver, and on to the Pacific  Ocean.    It is not meant that coon cannot be profitably raised south of this line  indicated, for they can. The chances, however, are that far south of the  line mentioned, the skins would not be as valuable and being nearer the  coon-producing section, there would not be as ready a market for the  carcasses.    The coon raiser should secure good dark males and females for breeding  purposes, from northern sections. If unable to do this, a good male or  two crossed with the females, would help to produce larger and darker  animals. This is important, as the larger and darker the pelt, the more  valuable, and the larger the carcass the more it brings.    That raccoons do well in captivity is well known from the many kept in  zoos, parks, etc. Countless numbers have been caught while young, when  they soon become tame and interesting pets. Even those caught when  grown, soon become accustomed to their owners and keepers. They can be  handled and become amusing pets. They know strangers and will often put  their paws over their eyes and look between their toes, thinking  perhaps, that the stranger cannot see them, while their paws are over  their eyes.    Large numbers of raccoons could be raised by fencing in a piece of  woods, embracing a few acres, with a creek running through. If the fence  was considerable distance from the edge of the woods, it is doubtful if  the animals would make much effort to escape. The places they would be  apt to frequent the most, would be where the stream entered and left the  enclosure. At these places the fence should be extra high, strong and  secure.    The raccoon and opossum farmer have a double advantage where their  \"farm\" is situated near a city. First, if the fur farm is one containing  a large number of animals, the supplying of food will be quite a problem  and the city offers a means of plenty and cheap food for your animals,  such as offals from slaughter houses and other feed. Second, the city  offers a market for the meat at \"killing time\".    While raccoon will eat decayed meat to some extent, it should be  furnished them fresh, in which condition it is much better for them.  Most animals will eat carrion, yet it is doubtful if it is advisable to  feed when in such condition. Putrid flesh is unhealthy and some claim,  causes fur-bearing animals to become affected with mange.    Raccoon are naturally a clean animal, and in their wild state are  particular that their food is clean. They seldom, if ever, eat left-over  food or flesh that has become tainted.    [Illustration: Barrel Shelter for Female and Young.]    That raccoon raising promises well is borne out from the fact that they  are easily handled, eat a variety of food easily secured, and their fur  and meat both have a ready cash market. The pelt of a full grown and  dark raccoon is worth from $1.00 to $2.00, depending upon the section;  to this add from 40c to 75c for the carcass and it will be seen that the  raccoon brings to its owner $1.40 to $2.50 or upwards. This price is for  the better grade. The smaller and lighter colored skins from the more  southerly sections, will perhaps only bring two-thirds as much--75 cents  to $1.50 for the pelts and 25 to 50 cents for the carcass.    At what other \"branch of farming\" is there greater profit? No one is  going to become immensely rich \"at coon raising\" in a few years, but if  they enter the business and give the same attention and care to it that  they would to poultry, sheep, horses and cattle, there is reason to  believe that the profits will be as large if not larger. Again, the  person who loves the handling of fur-bearing animals will be making his  living at the business he enjoys most.    [Illustration: Fur Farm on Open Ground.]    Those who expect to raise coon in a small enclosure, should have the  wire turned in several feet at the top, or the chances are they will  follow along the under side to the edge and thus escape. In the  enclosure for raccoon, the strip of tin around the fence some three or  four feet high is strongly recommended. There should be some logs, dens,  and low, branchy trees for the animals to play in is to their liking.  The more homelike their enclosure, the sooner they become contented.  This means that they grow faster, which is all to the financial interest  of the coon raiser.    An enclosure of several acres for coon, taking in trees suitable for  dens, could be used for fox raising as well. The coon would raise their  young in the \"den trees\" and therefore would not bother the foxes, as  those having young would be in pens. The male foxes having access to the  entire enclosure might steal the feed for the female coon left at the  roots of the den trees. Should there be trouble on this point, the food  could be placed on a platform against the body of the tree out of reach  of the foxes.          CHAPTER XI.    THE BEAVER AND OTTER.      These two very important fur-bearing animals were once quite numerous  throughout practically the whole of the United States and Canada, but  because of the persistency with which they were hunted, have become rare  in many of the sections where they were once found in abundance.  Especially is this true of the beaver. Almost all of the states in which  beavers are still found, as well as the various provinces of Canada,  have made laws to protect these animals, but they are still hunted and  trapped, and the day is not far distant when the beaver will be extinct.    The otter is a more wary animal than the beaver, and as a consequence  will linger within the bounds of civilization long after the beaver has  disappeared, but for all this they are becoming very rare in most of the  settled sections. As these animals both belong to different orders and  their habits are entirely different, it will be necessary to take up  each separately.    THE BEAVER.--As before mentioned, the beaver has become extinct in many  sections where it was once found, and at present they are practically  confined to Canada, Alaska, the Northern States and the Western mountain  regions. A few are still found in the more isolated portions of the  South, but there they are quite rare except in a few small sections.  Thruout the Central and many of the Eastern and Southern States, they  have entirely disappeared. There is only one species of the beaver, but  there are several varieties, all of which are very much alike in  appearance and the habits of all are the same, except where it is  changed because of difference in food, climate, etc.    The beaver has always been an interesting animal, not only to those  directly interested in furs, but to all others, and practically  everybody knows something regarding the habits of the animal. One of  their most remarkable habits is that of building dams on the stream, or  at the outlet of the pond or lake on which they are located. These dams  are intended to regulate the height of the water. They will vary from  two to five feet in height, and from twenty to one hundred yards in  length, according to the size of the stream and the nature of the  shores.    The dams are composed of sticks and chunks of wood, stones, sods, etc.  They always watch the dam closely and keep it in repair, and each fall  it is strengthened by adding new material. In addition to the main dam  there are, as a rule, one or more smaller dams built lower down stream.  What these small dams are for is not known for a certainty, but  sometimes, when the lower dam backs the water up to the large one, the  beavers will, in the fall after the ice has formed, dig a passage  through the upper dam, which allows the water to fall and leaves an air  space between the water and the ice, and it is perhaps for this reason  that the smaller dams are constructed.    Somewhere on the edge of the pool where the water is not too deep, the  beavers make their lodge, or house. These houses sometimes rise eight  feet above the water and will measure fifteen feet in diameter. They are  constructed of the same materials as used for the dam, and are always  repaired and strengthened before freezing weather comes. There are two"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33852"],[0,"British Butterflies: Figures and Descriptions of Every Native Species (#14)"],[1,"(_Manicipium_).    _Daplidice_ is a slow insect--slower than the Common Whites--and it is an  easy matter to catch it, when recognized, which the peculiarly heavy flight  might aid one in doing.    May and August are the months in which to look after this gem of the  _Pontia_ genus.           *       *       *       *       *    {91}    THE ORANGE-TIP BUTTERFLY. (_Euchloe Cardamines._)    (Plate V. fig. 1, Male; 1_a_, Female.)    Few vernal ramblers in the country, whether entomological or no, can fail  to have noticed, and been charmed by, this merry blossom-like insect, as it  gaily flits along by hedge-row and wood-side, pausing anon to taste its own  sweet flowers of May, and looking, even when on the wing, so unlike any  other of our native butterflies. Truly it is an exquisite and loveable  little creature, this Orange-Tip--sometimes styled the Wood Lady; but this  latter title is somewhat awkward in its application, inasmuch as the  \"_lady_\" insect is entirely without the characteristic _orange_ adornment,  and would hardly be suspected as being the same species with her handsome  lord.    The _male Orange-Tip_ needs no description, for the purpose of recognition,  beyond that conveyed by his name; but as the _female_ is less known, and  has been on several occasions mistaken for the rare Bath White  (_Daplidice_), it will be well to point out her chief distinguishing  characters. The difference between the two insects certainly is obvious  enough, when the two are _seen_ together, but their written descriptions  read rather alike. {92}    The female _Cardamines_ has the wings white _above_, with a greyish black  tip, and a _small oval_, or _crescent-shaped black spot_ (much smaller than  that of Daplidice) near the _centre_ of the front wings; _beneath_, a white  ground, with green marblings, that are much more sharply defined than those  in _Daplidice_. Near the centre of the front wing is a _clear black spot_,  corresponding in position with that on the upper surface, _and not shaded  off with green, as in Daplidice_.    We speak of the _green_ marblings of this species--and, to the naked eye,  they do appear to be of quite a bright green--but under a microscope or  powerful lens that colour disappears, being resolved into a combination of  bright yellow and pure black scales, which, with the dazzling snow-white  ground scales that surround them, form a microscopic tableau of  extraordinary beauty. This can, however, only be seen by daylight, for  under artificial light the yellow, on which the whole effect depends, is  entirely lost.    The _caterpillar_ is slightly hairy, and green, with a white stripe on each  side. It has been generally stated that the _Cardamine impatiens_ is the  common food plant of this species, _apropos_ of which I will quote the  following communication from Mr. Doubleday to the editor of the  _Zoologist_:--    \"In reply to your query about the food of the larva of _Cardamines_, I may  say that I have found it upon several plants. I believe that _Cardamine  pratensis_ (common cuckoo-flower) is the one on which the eggs {93} are  most frequently deposited, but the greater part of the _larvae_ must perish  in this neighbourhood, because the fields are mowed before the larvae are  full-grown. I have very often seen the larvae on the seed-pods of _Erysimum  Alliaria_, and have several times found the _pupae_ on the dead stems of  this plant in winter; I think that it is the principal food of Cardamines  at Epping; it also probably feeds on _E. barbarea_, and other similar  plants. Some years ago we used to have a quantity of a large single rocket  in the garden, and there was always a number of the larvae of _Cardamines_  feeding on the seed-pods. _Cardamine impatiens_ is so local a plant _that  it cannot be the common food of the larvae of Cardamines_.\"    The _chrysalis_ is of the very singular shape shown at fig. 17, Plate I., a  shape quite unique among British butterflies, though that of the next  slightly approaches it. It is to be looked for in autumn and winter on the  dry, dead stems of the plants named in the foregoing paragraph.    The perfect butterfly, which is very common throughout the country, is met  with from the end of April to the end of May or beginning of June.           *       *       *       *       *    {94}    THE WOOD-WHITE BUTTERFLY. (_Leucophasia Sinapis._)    (Plate V. fig. 2.)    A glance at the figure of this graceful little butterfly (on Plate V.) will  suffice to distinguish it at once, and clearly, from all our other Whites.  The most ordinary form of the insect is there represented, but there are  specimens occasionally met with that have the blackish spot at the tip of  the wings very much fainter; and sometimes, as in one that I possess, this  spot is totally wanting. The shape of the wings in these is also different,  being much rounder, and proportionately shorter, than in the ordinary  shape. This difference in outline is, I believe, a sexual distinction, the  more rounded form belonging to the female insect.    The slender, fragile wings and the attenuated body of the Wood-white give  it a look of almost ghostly lightness, and its manners befit its spectral  aspect, for it seems to _haunt_ the still and lonely wood glades, flitting  about slowly and restlessly, and being seldom seen to settle.    From its weak flight, it is a very easy insect to capture. It appears to be  addicted to early rising, _twenty-six_ specimens having been taken _one  morning before breakfast_ by a gentleman at Grange, in North Lancashire.  {95}    The _caterpillar_ is green, striped on each side with yellow; it feeds on  the Bird's-foot Trefoil, and other leguminous plants.    The _chrysalis_ is shown on Plate I. fig. 18, and in shape somewhat  approaches that of the Orange-tip.    The _butterfly_ appears in May and August, and though by no means a common  or generally distributed insect, is found--and sometimes abundantly--in  many localities throughout the country, as far north as Carlisle; some of  these are here given. Woods in neighbourhood of Brighton, Horsham (Sussex),  Dorchester, New Forest, Exeter, Epping, West Wickham Wood, Monkswood,  Huntingdonshire, Plymouth, Wavendon, Worcester, Kent and Surrey,  Teignmouth, Gloucestershire, Carlisle, Lake District, Leicester,  Manchester, North Lancashire. _Unknown in Scotland._           *       *       *       *       *    THE MARBLED WHITE BUTTERFLY. (_Arge Galathea._)    (Plate V. fig. 3.)    This highly interesting and elegant insect would, by the uninitiated,  probably be classed among the last group of Butterflies--the Whites--from  the similarity in its colours; but from all those it may be readily  distinguished by having _only four walking legs_ (instead of the _six_  which all our other white butterflies possess), {96} and also by the  _eye-like_ spots most visible on the under side.    The colouring may be described as consisting of nearly equal quantities of  _black_ and _creamy-white_, or _pale yellow_, so arranged as to form a  _marbled_ pattern of great richness. This description applies to the upper  surface; on the under, the pale tint very much preponderates, many of the  black masses of the upper side being here reduced to mere lines.    Many an entomologist, whose hunting ground has been limited to a small  district, has collected for years without once seeing this pretty creature  on the wing; and then visiting another neighbourhood, perhaps not far  distant, he will suddenly find it in profusion. I well remember the  feelings of surprised delight with which, under these circumstances, I  first made its acquaintance. The scene of the event was a grassy opening in  a wooded hill-side in Kent, and here were literally hundreds visible at  once, making the air all alive as they fluttered about in sportive groups:  it was a sight not to be forgotten; while a hundred yards from this spot  not a solitary one was to be seen, so closely limited is the local range of  this species.    The _caterpillar_, which feeds on grasses, like the rest of its tribe, is  green, with yellowish stripes on each side, and has a reddish head and  tail. The form is shown at fig. 3, Plate I.--a form common to all the tribe  to which this species belongs.    July and August are the months when we should {97} look for this charming  butterfly, in wood clearings and meadows near woods.    Some of the localities in which it has been observed are: Isle of Wight,  Surrey Hills, Eastwell Park (Kent), Dover, Lewes, Brighton, Epping,  Gloucestershire, Kingsbury, Darenth Wood, New Forest, Rockingham Park,  Teignmouth, York, Barnwell Wold, South Wales. _Not known in Scotland._           *       *       *       *       *    THE SPECKLED WOOD BUTTERFLY. (_Lasiommata Egeria._)    (Plate V. fig. 4.)    Every one who has wandered through green woodland ridings, or coppiced  paths, must be familiar with a lively, spotted brown insect that trips  along just ahead of one, in a sociable way, for some distance, finding time  to turn aside into the leafy recesses on either side without losing ground;  then, having had enough of our company, mounting overhead, and retracing  its course in the same playful way, and soon lost in the winding of the  path.    This is the Speckled Wood, or Wood Argus Butterfly, a very pretty insect on  both sides, and receiving the latter name--Argus, \"the many-eyed\"--from the  rows of rich black _eyes_ that grace its pinions. {98}    Over nearly the whole of England it is to be met with commonly wherever  there is wooded ground; but in several parts of Scotland it is quite  unknown.    The prevailing colour of the wings is deep brown, spotted with various  shades of buff or lighter brown. The \"eyes\" are velvety black, with a pure  white centre-spot.    The _caterpillar_--a grass feeder--is dull green, with broad white side  stripes.    The _chrysalis_, which is of a beautiful grass-green colour, may be found  "]]]
