The _haram_ has a  balcony all round it, on which a number of reception and living rooms  open, and though not grand or elaborately decorated, is convenient and  comfortable.    The Turkish host evidently did not know what to do with such an  embarrassing guest as a European woman, and solved the difficulty by  giving me the guest-chamber in the men's house, a most fortunate  decision, as I have had quiet and privacy for three days. Besides,  this room has a projecting window, with panes of glass held in by  nails, and there is not only a view of the alley with its slush, but  into the house of some poor folk, and over that to the Holwan,  sometimes in spate, sometimes falling, and through all the hours of  daylight frequented by grooms for the purpose of washing their horses.  Some shingle banks, now overflowed, sustain a few scraggy willows, and  on the farther side is some low-lying land. There may be much besides,  but the heavy rain-clouds blot out all else.    My room is whitewashed, and is furnished with Persian rugs, Austrian  bent-wood chairs, and a divan in the window, on which I sleep. Lamps,  _samovars_, and glasses are kept in recesses, and a black slave is  often in and out for them. Otherwise no one enters but Hadji. I get my  food somewhat precariously. It is carved and sent from table at the  beginning of meals, chiefly pillau, curry, _kabobs_, and roast  chicken, but apparently it is not etiquette for me to get it till  after the men have dined, and it is none the better for being cold.    The male part of the household consists of the Governor and his  brother-in-law, a Moslem judge, and the quarantine doctor, a Cretan,  takes his meals in the house. The Governor and doctor speak French. My  fellow-traveller lives with them.    The night we arrived, the Governor in some agitation asked me to go  and see his wife, who is very ill. The cholera has only just  disappeared, and the lady had had a baby, which died of it in three  days, and \"being a boy her heart was broken,\" and \"something had come  under her arm.\" So I went with him into the _haram_, which seemed  crowded with women of various races and colours, peeping from behind  curtains and through chinks of doors, tittering and whispering. The  wife's room is richly carpeted and thoroughly comfortable, with a huge  charcoal brazier in the centre, and cushions all over the floor,  except at one end, where there is a raised alcove with a bed in it.    On this the lady sat--a rather handsome Kurdish woman, about  thirty-five, dressed in a silk quilted jacket, and with a black gauze  handkerchief round her head, and a wadded quilt over her crossed legs.  She was supported by a pile of pillows. Since then I have been sent  for to see her several times every day, and found her always in the  same position. There is surely something weird about it. She says she  sits there all night, and has not lain down for two months. A black  slave was fanning her, and two women, shrouded in veils of tinselled  gauze, sat on the bed combing her luxuriant hair. She is not really  beautiful at all, but her husband assures me constantly that she is  \"_une femme savante_.\" She has property and the consideration which  attaches to it. She was burning with fever and very weak.    I had scarcely returned to my room when my host sent again, begging  that I would go back and see the doctor. I found that it was expected  that I should persuade the lady to consent to have the abscess, or  whatever it is, reopened. The room was full of women and eunuchs, and  the chief eunuch, an elderly Arab, sat on the bed and supported her  while the doctor dressed the wound, and even helped him with it. Her  screams were fearful, and five people held her with difficulty. Her  husband left the room, unable to bear her cries.    Quite late I was sent for again, and that time by the lady, to know if  I thought she would die. It appears that her brother, the judge,  remains here to see that she is not the victim of foul play, but I  don't like to ask to whom the suspicion points, or whether our host,  although the civil governor, keeps him here that he may not be  suspected in case his rich wife dies.    Except for the repeated summonses to the sick-room, a walk on the  slime of the roof when the rain ceases for a time, and on the balcony  of the _haram_ when it does not, and a study of the habits of my  neighbours over the way, it is very dull. I have patched and mended  everything that gave any excuse for either operation, have written  letters which it is not safe to post, and have studied my one book on  Persia till I know it throughout, and still the rain falls nearly  without cessation and the quagmires outside deepen.    So bad is it that, dearly as Orientals love bazars and _hammams_,  Hadji refuses leave to go to either. I remarked to him that he must be  glad of such a rest, and he replied in his usual sententious fashion:  \"They who have to work must work. God knows all.\" I fear he is very  lazy, and he has no idea of making one comfortable or of keeping  anything clean. He stamps the mud of the courtyard into the carpets,  and wipes my plates without washing them, with his shirt. He considers  that our host has attained the height of human felicity. \"What is  there left to wish for?\" he says. \"He has numbers of slaves, and he's  always buying more, and he's got numbers of women and eunuchs, and  everything, and when he wants money he just sends round the villages.  God is great! _Ya Allah!_\"    Khannikin, being the nearest town to the Persian frontier, should be a  place of some importance. It is well situated at an altitude of 1700  feet among groves of palms, on both banks of the Holwan, and having  plenty of water, the rich alluvium between it and Yakobiyeh is able to  support its own population, though it has to import for caravans. Most  of the Persian trade with Baghdad and thousands of Shiah pilgrims  annually pass through it. It is a customs station, and has a regiment  of soldiers. Nevertheless, it is very ruinous, and its population has  diminished of late years from 5000 to about 1800 (exclusive of the  troops), and of this number a fifth have been carried off by cholera  within the last few weeks. It has no schools, and no special  industries. The stamp of decay rests upon it. Exactions, crushing  hope out of the people, the general insecurity of property, and the  misrule which has blighted these fine Asiatic provinces everywhere,  sufficiently explain its decadence.    The imposition of quarantine on arrivals from Persia has all but  stopped the supply of charcoal, and knowing the scarcity in the house,  I am going without a fire, as most of the inhabitants are doing. A  large caravanserai outside the walls is used as a quarantine station,  and three others are taken as lazarettos. Out of these arrangements  the officials make a great deal of money in fees, but anything more  horrible than the sanitary state of these places cannot be conceived.  The water appears to be the essence of typhoid fever and cholera, and  the unfortunate _detenus_ are crowded into holes unfit for beasts,  breathing pestiferous exhalations, and surrounded by such ancient and  modern accumulations of horrors that typhus fever, cholera, and even  the plague might well be expected to break out.    Yesterday, for a brief interval, hills covered with snow appeared  through rolling black clouds, and a change seemed probable, but rain  fell in torrents all night; there is a spate in the river, and though  we were ready to start at eight this morning, the _katirgis_ declined  to move, saying that the road could not be travelled because of the  depth of the fords and the mud.    The roof, though a good one, is now so leaky that I am obliged to  sleep under my waterproof cloak, and the un-puttied window-frames let  in the rain. Early this morning a gale from the south-west came on,  and the howling and roaring have been frightful, the rain falling in  sheets most of the time. Sensations are not wanting. One of the  orderlies is seriously ill, and has to be left behind under medical  care till he can be sent to India,--the second man who has broken  down. A runner came in with the news that all caravans are stopped in  the Zagros mountains by snow, which has been falling for five days,  and that the road is not expected to be open for a fortnight. Later,  the Persian agent called to say that on the next march the road, which  is carried on a precipice above the river, has slid down bodily, and  that there are fifteen feet of water where there should be only two.  Of course this prolonged storm is \"exceptional.\" The temperature is  falling, and it is so cold without a fire that though my bed is only a  blanket-covered dais of brick and lime, dripped upon continually, in a  window with forty draughts, I am glad to muffle myself up in its  blankets and write among wraps.    The Governor, recognising the craze of Europeans for exercise, sent  word that M---- might walk in the balcony of the _haram_ if I went to  chaperon him, and this great concession was gladly accepted, for it  was the only possible way of getting warm. The apparition of a strange  man, and a European, within the precincts of the _haram_ was a great  event, and every window, curtain, and doorway was taken advantage of  by bright dark eyes sparkling among folds of cotton and gauze. The  enjoyment was surreptitious, but possibly all the more keen, and  sounds of whispering and giggling surged out of every crevice. There  are over thirty women, some of them negresses. Some are Kurds and very  handsome, but the faces of the two handsomest, though quite young,  have something fiendish in their expression. I have seldom seen a  _haram_ without its tragedies of jealousy and hate, and every fresh  experience makes me believe that the system is as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38828"],[0,"Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, Volume 2 (of 2) (#14)"],[1,"knocked out--a regular hospital  case. Her brother, they said, had quarrelled with her and had thrown  stones at her only the day before, but they had already filled up the  wounds with some horrible paste. I asked Sardah Khan why the Khan did  not have the man thrashed for such a brutality, and he replied that no  one would touch him, as he had killed three men last winter.    I spent two hours upon the poor creature, and the relief was so great  that her gratitude was profuse, and the blessings invoked manifold. It  was a great pleasure to me. But many things were taken out of the tent  while I sat outside attending to her. The Khan's brothers,  _tufangchis_ with their long guns, Seyyids with their green turbans  and contemptuous scowl, women, and children were all pressing upon me,  hindering and suffocating me in a temperature of nearly 100 deg. They  seem to have no feeling for pain or shrinking from painful spectacles,  and rather to enjoy the groans of the sufferer. Each time a piece of  stone was taken out of the wounds they exclaimed \"God is great!\"  Occasionally, when the crush interfered with what I was doing, a man  beat them with his gun, or Aziz Khan threw stones at them, but it was  useless.    The people tell our men that _Kafirs_ have never before entered their  valley, and that if we were not under the Shah's protection they would  take all that we have. I imagine that the difficulties are far greater  than I know, for the Agha, who minimises all danger, remarked last  night that this is a most anxious time, and that he should be most  thankful to get every one out of the country, for it was impossible to  say what a day might bring forth. All idea of my returning to Julfa is  now abandoned. Bad as it is it is safer to go on.    As the welcome darkness fell the hillsides near and far blazed with  fires, and Aslam Khan's camp immediately below was a very picturesque  sight, its thirty-one tents forming a circle, with the Khan's two  tents in the middle, each having a fire in front. Supper was prepared  in large pots; the men ate first, then the women, children, and dogs.  The noise suggested pandemonium. The sheep and goats bleated, the big  dogs barked, the men and women shouted and shrieked all together, at  the top of their voices, rude musical instruments brayed and  clanged,--it sounded diabolical. Doubtless the inroad of the Feringhis  was the topic of talk. Savage life does not bear a near view. Its  total lack of privacy, its rough brutality, its dirt, its undisguised  greed, its unconcealed jealousies and hatreds, its falseness, its pure  selfishness, and its treachery are all painful on a close inspection.    The following morning early we came up to the Gunak, the narrow top of  a pass in the Kala Kuh range with an altitude of 10,200 feet, crossing  on the way a steep and difficult snow-slide, and have halted here for  two days. Marching with the caravan is a necessary precaution, but a  most tedious and fatiguing arrangement. No more galloping, only a  crawl at \"caravan pace,\" about two and a half miles an hour for five,  six, or seven hours, and though one is up at 2.45 it is fully five  before the mules are under way, and meantime one is the centre of that  everlasting crowd which, on some pretext or other, asks for medicine.  If no ailment can be produced at present, then the request is, \"Give  me something from the leather box, I've a cough in the winter,\" or an  uncovered copper bowl is brought, the contents of which would  evaporate in a fortnight in this climate, with the plaint, \"I've a  brother,\" or some other relative, \"who has sore eyes in spring, please  give me some eye-lotion.\" Nothing is appreciated made from their own  valuable medicinal herbs. \"Feringhi medicine\" is all they care for,  and in their eyes every Feringhi is a _Hak[=i]m_.    I have often wondered that the Moslem contempt for women does not  prevent even the highest chiefs from seeking a woman's medical help,  but their own _Hak[=i]ms_, of whom there are a few, though I have  never seen any, are mostly women, and the profession is hereditary.  The men, they say, are too unsettled to be _Hak[=i]ms_. Some of these  women are renowned for their skill as bullet extractors. If a father  happens to have any medical knowledge he communicates it to his  daughter rather than to his son. Aziz's grandmother learned medicine  from a native Indian doctor in Fars, and his mother had a repute as a  bullet extractor. A woman extracted the three bullets by which he has  been wounded. The \"fees\" are very high, but depend entirely on the  cure. A poor man pays for the extraction of a bullet and the cure of  the wound from fifteen to twenty _tumans_ (from L5 to L6:10s.), a rich  man from forty to sixty. In all cases they only give medicine so long  as they think there is hope of recovery, and have no knowledge of any  treatment which can alleviate the sufferings of the dying. When death  seems inevitable they stuff the nose with a paste made of aromatic  herbs.    They dress wounds with an astringent paste made from a very small  gall-nut found on one species of oak. For dyspeptic pains and \"bad  blood\" they eat bitumen. For snake-bite, which is common, they keep  the bitten person moving about and apply the back part of live hens to  the wound till the hens cease to be affected, or else the intestines  of a goat newly killed. For rheumatism, headache, and debility they  have no remedies, but for fever they use an infusion of willow bark,  which is not efficacious. They have great faith in amulets and charms,  and in chewing and swallowing verses of the Koran in case of illness.  They are rigid \"abstainers,\" and _arak_ is not to be procured in the  Bakhtiari country. This partly accounts for the extreme and almost  startling rapidity of the healing of surgical wounds.    Ophthalmia, glaucoma, bulging eyeballs, inflamed eyes and eyelids,  eczema, rheumatism, dyspepsia, and coughs are the prevailing maladies,  and among men, bad headaches, which they describe as periodical and  incapacitating, are common. The skin maladies and some of the eye  maladies come from dirt, and the parasites which are its offspring.  Among the common people the clothes are only washed once a year, and  then in cold water, with the root of a very sticky soap wort. They  attribute all ailments but those of the skin and eyes to \"wind.\"  Rheumatism doubtless comes from sleeping in cotton clothing, and  little enough of it, on the damp ground.    There are no _sages femmes_. Every woman is supposed to be able to  help her neighbour in her hour of need. Maternity is easy. The mother  is often at work the day after the birth of her child, and in less  than a week regains her usual strength.    Possession by bad spirits is believed in, and cowardice is attributed  to possession. In the latter case medicine is not resorted to, but a  _mollah_ writes a text from the Koran and binds the paper on the  coward's arm. If this does not cure him he must visit a graveyard on  the night of the full moon, and pass seven times under the body of one  of the sculptured lions on the graves, repeating an Arabic prayer.    This pass gives a little rest. It is solitary, cold (the mercury 48 deg.  at 10 P.M.), and very windy. I appreciate the comparatively low  temperature all the more because the scenery beyond the Zalaki valley,  in which scorched valleys and reddish rocky ranges are repeated _ad  nauseam_, lies under a blazing sun and in a hot dust haze like that of  the Indian plains. The ridge is only just wide enough for the camps,  and falls down in abrupt descents to the source of the Ab-i-Sefid.  Tremendous precipices and the naked peaks of the Kala Kuh surround us,  and to the east the Zard Kuh and the long straight-topped range of the  Kuh-i-Gokun (or Kainu?), deeply cleft, to allow of the exit of the  Ab-i-Gokun, wall in the magnificent prospect, woods and streams and  blue and violet depths suggesting moisture and coolness. The ridge has  a remarkably rich alpine flora.    Life is now only a \"struggle for existence\" on the lower altitudes,  with their heat and hubbub; there is no comfort or pleasure in  occupation under 9000 feet. Here there are only the sick people of the  camps to attend to. The guides and guards all need eye-lotion, one bad  wound needs dressing, and the Khan's brother has had fever severely,  which is cured, and he offers me as a present a boy of five years old.  Aslam Khan's face of Judas is not for nothing, but his brother is  beautiful, and has the face of St. John. I. L. B.      FOOTNOTE:    [5] From Kalahoma for the rest of the route the predatory character of  the tribes, the growing weakness of the Ilkhani's authority, the  \"blood feuds\" and other inter-tribal quarrels, and the unsettled state  of the Feili Lurs, produced a general insecurity and continual peril  for travellers, which rendered constant vigilance and precautions  necessary, as well as an alteration of arrangements.          LETTER XIX           CAMP SHUTURUN, _July 25_.    After that uplifted halt, which refreshed the Europeans but did not  suit the health of the attendants, we descended, crossed the Zalaki  valley and a low ridge, with populous camps, into the valley of the  Mauri Zarin, where the nomads were busy harvesting, forded the river,  and proceeded up its left bank to a dusty level on which a deep ravine  opens, _apparently_ blocked up by a castellated and nearly  inaccessible rock of great height. At this place, where the Badush  joins the Mauri Zarin, we were obliged to camp close to some Ilyat  tents, which involved crowds, many demands, much noise, and much  vigilance.    We were then in the territory of Mirab Khan, the chief of the Isawand  tribe, between whom and Aslam Khan there is a blood feud, with most  deadly enmity. He sent word that he was not well, and asked the Agha  to go to see him, which he did, telling him that the _Hak[=i]m_ would "]]]
