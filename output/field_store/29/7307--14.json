Its very name denotes that it was used as an incense in  Greek temples. No doubt it was the Common Thyme (T. vulgaris), an  erect, tall plant cultivated in gardens here as a savory, that  Horace says the Romans used so extensively for bee culture.    Dense cushions of creeping thyme usually contain two forms of  blossoms on separate plants - hermaphrodite (male and female  which are much the commoner; and pistillate, or only female,  flowers, in which the stamens develop no pollen. The latter are  more fertile; none can fertilize itself. But blossoms so rich in  nectar naturally attract quantities of insects - bees and  butterflies chiefly. A newly opened hermaphrodite flower, male on  the first day, dusts its visitors as they pass the ripe stamens.  This pollen they carry to a flower two days old, which, having  reached the female stage, receives it on the mature two-cleft  stigma, now erect and tall, whereas the stamens are past  maturity.      GARDEN, SPEAR, or MACKEREL MINT    (Mentha spicata; M. viridis of Gray)  Mint family    Flowers - Small, pale bluish, or pinkish purple, in whorls,  forming terminal, interrupted, narrow spikes, 2 to 4 in. long in  fruit, the central one surpassing lateral ones. Calyx  bell-shaped, toothed; corolla tubular, 4-cleft. Stamens 4; style  2-cleft. Stem: Smooth, 1 to 1 1/2 ft. high, branched. Leaves:  Opposite, narrowly oblong, acute, saw-edged, aromatic.  Preferred Habitat - Moist soil.  Flowering Season  - July-September.  Distribution - Eastern half of Canada and United States. Also  Europe and Asia.    The poets tell us that Proserpine, Pluto's wife, in a fit of  jealousy changed a hated rival into the mint plant, whose name  Mentha, in its Latin form, or Minthe, the Greek equivalent, is  still that of the metamorphosed beauty, a daughter of Cocytus,  who was also Pluto's wife. Proserpine certainly contrived to keep  her rival's memory fragrant. But how she must delight in seeing  her under the chopping-knife and served up as sauce!    It is a curious fact that among the Labiates, or two-lipped  blossoms to which thymes and mints belong, there very frequently  occur species bearing flowers that are male on the first day  (staminate) and female, or pistillate, on the second day, and  also smaller female flowers on distinct plants. Muller believed  this plan was devised to attract insects, first by the more showy  hermaphrodite flower, that they might carry its pollen to the  less conspicuous female flower, which they would naturally visit  last; but this interesting theory has yet to be proved. Nineteen  species of flies, to which the mints are specially adapted, have  been taken in the act of transferring pollen. Ten varieties of  the lower hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and others) commonly resort  to the fragrant spikes of bloom.    PEPPERMINT (M. piiterita), similar in manner of growth to the  preceding, is another importation from Europe now thoroughly at  home here in wet soil. The volatile oil obtained by distilling  its leaves has long been an important item of trade in Wayne  County, New York. One has only to crush the leaves in one's hand  to name the flower.    Our native WILD MINT (M. Canadensis), common along brook-sides  and in moist soil from New Brunswick to Virginia and far  westward, has its whorls of small purplish flowers seated in the  leaf axils. Its odor is like pennyroyal. The true PENNYROYAL, not  to be confused with our spurious woodland annual, is M. Pulegium,  a native of Europe, whence a number of its less valuable  relatives, all perennials, have traveled to become naturalized  Americans.    In dry open woods and thickets and by the roadside, from late  August throughout September, we find blooming the aromatic  fragrant STONE MINT, SWEET HORSE-MINT, or AMERICAN DITTANY  (Cunila origanoides; C. Mariana of Gray). Its small pink-purple,  lilac, or whitish flowers, that are only about half as long as  the protruding pair of stamens, are borne in loose terminal  clusters at the ends of the stiff, branched, slender, sometimes  reddish, stem. A pair of rudimentary, useless stamens remain  within the two-lipped tube; the exserted pair, affording the most  convenient alighting place for the visiting flies, dust their  undersides with pollen the first day the flower opens; on the  next, the stigma will be ready to receive pollen carried from  young flowers.      NIGHTSHADE; BLUE BINDWEED; FELONWORT; BITTERSWEET; SCARLET or  SNAKE BERRY; POISON-FLOWER; WOODY NIGHTSHADE    (Solanum Dulcamara)  Potato family    Flowers - Blue, purple, or, rarely, white with greenish spots on  each lobe; about 1/2 in. broad, clustered in slender, drooping  cymes. Calyx 5-lobed, oblong, persistent on the berry; corolla  deeply, sharply 5-cleft, wheel-shaped, or points curved backward;  5 stamens inserted on throat, yellow, protruding, the anthers  united to form a cone; stigma small. Stem: Climbing or  straggling, woody below, branched, 2 to 8 ft. long. Leaves:  Alternate, 2 to 4 in. long, 1 to 2 1/2 in. wide, pointed at the  apex, usually heart-shaped at base; some with 2 distinct leaflets  below on the petiole, others have leaflets united with leaf like  lower lobes or wings. Fruit: A bright red, oval berry.  Preferred Habitat - Moist thickets, fence rows.  Flowering Season - May-September.  Distribution - United States east of Kansas, north of New Jersey.  Canada, Europe, and Asia.    More beautiful than the graceful flowers are the drooping cymes  of bright berries, turning from green to yellow, then to orange  and scarlet, in the tangled thicket by the shady roadside in  autumn, when the unpretending, shrubby vine, that has crowded its  way through the rank midsummer vegetation, becomes a joy to the  eye. Another bittersweet, so-called, festoons the hedgerows with  yellow berries which, bursting, show their scarlet-coated seeds.  Rose hips and mountain-ash berries, among many other conspicuous  bits of color, arrest attention, but not for us were they  designed. Now the birds are migrating, and, hungry with their  long flight, they gladly stop to feed upon fare so attractive.  Hard, indigestible seeds traverse the alimentary canal without  alteration and are deposited many miles from the parent that bore  them. Nature's methods for widely distributing plants cannot but  stir the dullest imagination.    The purple pendent flowers of this nightshade secrete no nectar,  therefore many insects let them alone; but it is now believed  that no part of the plant is poisonous. Certainly one that claims  the potato, tomato, and eggplant among its kin has no right to be  dangerous. The BLACK, GARDEN, or DEADLY NIGHTSHADE, also called  MOREL (S. nigrum), bears jet-black berries that are alleged to be  fatal. Nevertheless, female bumblebees, to which its white  flowers are specially adapted, visit them to draw out pollen from  the chinks of the anthers with their jaws, just as they do in the  case of the wild, sensitive plant, and with no more disastrous  result. It has been well said that the nightshades are a blessing  both to the sick and to the doctors. The present species takes  its name from dulcis, sweet, and amaras, bitter, referring to the  taste of the juice; the generic name is derived from solamen,  solace or consolation, referring to the relief afforded by the  narcotic properties of some of these plants.      BLUE or WILD TOADFLAX; BLUE LINARIA    (Linaria Canadensis)  Figwort family    Flowers - Pale blue to purple, small, irregular, in slender  spikes. Calyx 5-pointed; corolla 2-lipped, with curved spur  longer than its tube, which is nearly closed by a white, 2-ridged  projection or palate; the upper lip erect, 2-lobed; lower lip  3-lobed, spreading. Stamens 4, in pairs, in throat; 1 pistil.  Stem: Slender, weak, of sterile shoots, prostrate; flowering  stem, ascending or erect, 4 in. to 2 ft. high. Leaves: Small,  linear, alternately scattered along stem, or oblong in pairs or  threes on leafy sterile shoots.  Preferred Habitat - Dry soil, gravel, or sand.  Flowering Season - May-October.  Distribution - North, Central, and South Americas.    Sometimes lying prostrate in the dust, sometimes erect, the  linaria's delicate spikes of bloom wear an air of injured  innocence, yet the plant, weak as it looks, has managed to spread  over three Americas from ocean to ocean. More beautiful than the  rather scrawny flowers are the tufts of cool green foliage made  by the sterile shoots that take complete possession of a wide  area around the parent plants.    Unlike its relative butter-and-eggs, the corolla of this toadflax  is so contracted that bees cannot enter it; but by inserting  their long tongues, they nevertheless manage to drain it. Small,  short-tongued bees contrive to reach only a little nectar. The  palate, so valuable to the other linaria, has in this one lost  its function; and the larger flies, taking advantage of the  flower's weakness, pilfer both sweets and pollen. Butterflies, to  which a slender spurred flower is especially attractive, visit  this one in great numbers, and as they cannot regale themselves  without touching the anthers and stigma, they may be regarded as  the legitimate visitors.    Wolf, rat, mouse, sow, cow, cat, snake, dragon, dog, toad, are  among the many animal prefixes to the names of flowers that the  English country people have given for various and often most  interesting reasons. Just as dog, used as a prefix, expresses an  idea of worthlessness to them, so toad suggests a spurious plant;  the toadflax being made to bear what is meant to be an odious  name because before flowering it resembles the true flax, linum,  from which the generic title is derived.

The performance of the ship on both voyages  was perfection. Even in the tortuous Alpine passes which she was  forced to navigate on her trip to Lucerne she moved with the  steadiness and certainty of a great ship at sea. The rarification of  the air at high altitudes, the extreme and sudden variations in  temperature, the gusts of wind that poured from the ice-bound peaks  down through the narrow canyons affected her not at all. When to  this experience was added the triumphant tour of the six German  cities, Count von Zeppelin might well have thought his triumph was  complete.    But once again the cup of victory was dashed from his lips. After  his landing a violent wind beat upon the ship. An army of men strove  to hold her fast, while an effort was made to reduce her bulk by  deflation. That effort, which would have been entirely successful in  the case of a non-rigid balloon, was obviously futile in that of a  Zeppelin. Not the gas in the ballonets, but the great rigid frame  covered with water-proofed cloth constituted the huge bulk that made  her the plaything of the winds. In a trice she was snatched from the  hands of her crew and hurled against the trees in a neighbouring  grove. There was a sudden and utterly unexpected explosion and the  whole fabric was in flames. The precise cause of the explosion will  always be in doubt, but, as already pointed out, many scientists  believe that the great volume of electricity accumulated in the  metallic frame was suddenly released in a mighty spark which set  fire to the stores of gasoline on board.    With this disaster the iron nerve of the inventor was for the first  time broken. It followed so fast upon what appeared to be a complete  triumph that the shock was peculiarly hard to bear. It is said that  he broke down and wept, and that but for the loving courage and  earnest entreaties of his wife and daughter he would then have  abandoned the hope and ambition of his life. But after all it was  but that darkest hour which comes just before the dawn. The  demolition of \"No. IV.\" had been no accident which reflected at all  upon the plan or construction of the craft--unless the great bulk of  the ship be considered a fundamental defect. What it did demonstrate  was that the Zeppelin, like the one-thousand-foot ocean liner, must  have adequate harbour and docking facilities wherever it is to land.  The one cannot safely drop down in any convenient meadow, any more  than the other can put into any little fishing port. Germany has  learned this lesson well enough and since the opening of the Great  War her territory is plentifully provided with Zeppelin shelters at  all strategic points.    [Illustration: _The Death of a Zeppelin._    Photo by Paul Thompson.]    Fortunately for the Count the German people judged his latest  reverse more justly than he did. They saw the completeness of the  triumph which had preceded the disaster and recognized that the  latter was one easily guarded against in future. Enthusiasm ran high  all over the land. Begging was no longer necessary. The Emperor,  who had heretofore expressed rather guarded approval of the  enterprise, now flung himself into it with that enthusiasm for which  he is notable. He bestowed upon the Count the Order of the Black  Eagle, embraced him in public three times, and called aloud that all  might hear, \"Long life to his Excellency, Count Zeppelin, the  Conqueror of the Air.\" He never wearied of assuring his hearers that  the Count was the \"greatest German of the century.\" With such august  patronage the Count became the rage. Next to the Kaiser's the face  best known to the people of Germany, through pictures and statues,  was that of the inventor of the Zeppelin. The pleasing practice of  showing affection for a public man by driving nails into his wooden  effigy had not then been invented by the poetic Teutons, else von  Zeppelin would have outdone von Hindenburg in weight of metal.    The story that Zeppelin had refused repeated offers from other  governments was widely published and evoked patriotic enthusiasm.  With it went shrewd hints that in these powerful aircraft lay the  way to overcome the hated English navy, and even to carry war to the  very soil of England. It was then eight years before the greatest  war of history was to break out, but even at that date hatred of  England was being sedulously cultivated among the German people by  those in authority.    As a result of this national attitude Count Zeppelin's enterprise  was speedily put on a sound financial footing. Though \"No. IV.\" had  been destroyed by an accident it had been the purpose of the  government to buy her, and $125,000 of the purchase price was now  put at the disposal of the Count von Zeppelin. A popular Zeppelin  fund of $1,500,000 was raised and expended in building great works.  Thenceforward there was no lack of money for furthering what had  truly become a great national interest.    But the progress of the construction of Zeppelins for the next few  years was curiously compounded of success and failure. Fate seemed  to have decreed to every Zeppelin triumph a disaster. Each mischance  was attributed to exceptional conditions which never could happen  again, but either they did occur, or some new but equally effective  accident did. Outside of Germany, where the public mind had become  set in an almost idolatrous confidence in Zeppelin, the great  airships were becoming a jest and a byword notwithstanding their  unquestioned accomplishments. Indeed when the record was made up  just before the declaration of war in 1914 it was found that of  twenty-five Zeppelins thus far constructed only twelve were  available. Thirteen had been destroyed by accident--two of them  modern naval airships only completed in 1913. The record was not one  to inspire confidence.    In 1909, during a voyage in which he made nine hundred miles in  thirty-eight hours, the rumour was spread that von Zeppelin would  continue it to Berlin. Some joker sent a forged telegram to the  Kaiser to that effect signed \"Zeppelin.\" It was expected to be the  first appearance of one of the great ships at the capital, and the  Emperor hastened to prepare a suitable welcome. A great crowd  assembled at the Templehoff Parade Ground. The Berlin Airship  Battalion was under orders to assist in the landing. The Kaiser  himself was ready to hasten to the spot should the ship be sighted.  But she never appeared. If von Zeppelin knew of the exploit which  rumour had assigned to him--which is doubtful--he could not have  carried it out. His ship collided with a tree--an accident  singularly frequent in the Zeppelin records--so disabling it that  it could only limp home under half power. A rather curt telegram  from his Imperial master is said to have been Count von Zeppelin's  first intimation that he had broken an engagement.    However, he kept it two months later, flying to Berlin, a distance  of 475 miles. He was greeted with mad enthusiasm and among the crowd  to welcome him was Orville Wright the American aviator. It is a  curious coincidence that on the day the writer pens these words the  New York newspapers contain accounts of Mr. Wright's proffer of his  services, and aeronautical facilities, to the President in case an  existing diplomatic break with Germany should reach the point of  actual war. Mr. Wright accompanied his proffer by an appeal for a  tremendous aviation force, \"but,\" said he, \"I strongly advise  against spending any money whatsoever on dirigible balloons of any  sort.\"    Thereafter the progress of Count von Zeppelin was without  interruption for any lack of financial strength. His great works at  Friedrichshaven expanded until they were capable of putting out a  complete ship in eight weeks. He was building, of course, primarily  for war, and never concealed the fact that the enemy he expected to  be the target of his bomb throwers was England. What the airships  accomplished in this direction, how greatly they were developed, and  the strength and weakness of the German air fleet, will be dwelt  upon in another chapter.    But, though building primarily for military purposes, Zeppelin did  not wholly neglect the possibilities of his ship for non-military  service. He built one which made more than thirty trips between  Munich and Berlin, carrying passengers who paid a heavy fee for the  privilege of enjoying this novel form of travel. The car was fitted  up like our most up-to-date Pullmans, with comfortable seats, bright  lights, and a kitchen from which excellent meals were served to  the passengers. The service was not continued long enough to  determine whether it could ever be made commercially profitable,  but as an aid to firing the Teutonic heart and an assistance in  selling stock it was well worth while. The spectacle of one of these  great cars, six hundred or more feet long, floating grandly on even  keel and with a steady course above one of the compact little towns  of South Germany, was one to thrill the pulses.    But the ill luck which pursued Count von Zeppelin even in what  seemed to be his moments of assured success was remorseless. In 1912  he produced the monster _L-I_, 525 feet long, 50 feet in diameter,  of 776,900 cubic feet capacity, and equipped with three sets of  motors, giving it a speed of fifty-two miles an hour. This ship was  designed for naval use and after several successful cross-country  voyages she was ordered to Heligoland, to participate in naval  manoeuvres with the fleet there stationed. One day, caught by a  sudden gust of wind such as are common enough on the North Sea, she  proved utterly helpless. Why no man could tell, her commander being  drowned, but in the face of the gale she lost all control, was  buffeted by the elements at their will, and dropped into the sea  where she was a total loss. Fifteen of her twenty-two officers and  men were drowned. "]]]
