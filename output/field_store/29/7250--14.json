[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2744"],[0,"Mary Stuart (#14)"],[1,"slanderously, certain talk which was circulating among the young  noblemen of the time came to James's ears; it was said that together  with her royal lover the beautiful favourite had another, whom she had  chosen, no doubt from curiosity, from the very lowest class. It was  added that this Porterfeld, or Porterfield, was the real father of the  child who had already received the name of James Stuart, and whom the  king was educating as his son at the monastery of St. Andrews. These  rumours, well founded or not, had therefore stopped James V at the  moment when, in gratitude to her who had given him a son, he was on the  point of raising her to the rank of queen; so that, instead of marrying  her himself, he had invited her to choose among the nobles at court; and  as she was very handsome, and the king's favour went with the marriage,  this choice, which fell on Lord William Douglas of Lochleven, did not  meet with any resistance on his part. However, in spite of this direct  protection, that James V preserved for her all his life, Lady Douglas  could never forget that she had fingered higher fortune; moreover, she  had a hatred for the one who, according to herself, had usurped her  place, and poor Mary had naturally inherited the profound animosity that  Lady Douglas bore to her mother, which had already come to light in the  few words that the two women had exchanged. Besides, in ageing, whether  from repentance for her errors or from hypocrisy, Lady Douglas had  become a prude and a puritan; so that at this time she united with the  natural acrimony of her character all the stiffness of the new religion  she had adopted.    William Douglas, who was the eldest son of Lord Lochleven, on his  mother's side half-brother of Murray, was a man of from thirty-five to  thirty-six years of age, athletic, with hard and strongly pronounced  features, red-haired like all the younger branch, and who had inherited  that paternal hatred that for a century the Douglases cherished against  the Stuarts, and which was shown by so many plots, rebellions, and  assassinations. According as fortune had favoured or deserted Murray,  William Douglas had seen the rays of the fraternal star draw near or  away from him; he had then felt that he was living in another's life,  and was devoted, body and soul, to him who was his cause of greatness or  of abasement. Mary's fall, which must necessarily raise Murray, was thus  a source of joy for him, and the Confederate lords could not have chosen  better than in confiding the safe-keeping of their prisoner to the  instinctive spite of Lady Douglas and to the intelligent hatred of her  son.    As to Little Douglas, he was, as we have said, a child of twelve, for  some months an orphan, whom the Lochlevens had taken charge of, and whom  they made buy the bread they gave him by all sorts of harshness. The  result was that the child, proud and spiteful as a Douglas, and knowing,  although his fortune was inferior, that his birth was equal to his proud  relatives, had little by little changed his early gratitude into lasting  and profound hatred: for one used to say that among the Douglases there  was an age for loving, but that there was none for hating. It results  that, feeling his weakness and isolation, the child was self-contained  with strength beyond his years, and, humble and submissive in  appearance, only awaited the moment when, a grown-up young man, he could  leave Lochleven, and perhaps avenge himself for the proud protection of  those who dwelt there. But the feelings that we have just expressed did  not extend to all the members of the family: as much as from the bottom  of his heart the little Douglas detested William and his mother, so much  he loved George, the second of Lady Lochleven's sons, of whom we have  not yet spoken, because, being away from the castle when the queen  arrived, we have not yet found an opportunity to present him to our  readers.    George, who at this time might have been about twenty-five or twenty-six  years old, was the second son of Lord Lochleven; but by a singular  chance, that his mother's adventurous youth had caused Sir William to  interpret amiss, this second son had none of the characteristic features  of the Douglases' full cheeks, high colour, large ears, and red hair.  The result was that poor George, who, on the contrary, had been given by  nature pale cheeks, dark blue eyes, and black hair, had been since  coming into the world an object of indifference to his father and of  dislike to his elder brother. As to his mother, whether she were indeed  in good faith surprised like Lord Douglas at this difference in race,  whether she knew the cause and inwardly reproached herself, George had  never been, ostensibly at least, the object of a very lively maternal  affection; so the young man, followed from his childhood by a fatality  that he could not explain, had sprung up like a wild shrub, full of sap  and strength, but uncultivated and solitary. Besides, from the time when  he was fifteen, one was accustomed to his motiveless absences, which the  indifference that everyone bore him made moreover perfectly explicable;  from time to time, however, he was seen to reappear at the castle, like  those migratory birds which always return to the same place but only  stay a moment, then take their way again without one's knowing towards  what spot in the world they are directing their flight.    An instinct of misfortune in common had drawn Little Douglas to George.  George, seeing the child ill-treated by everyone, had conceived an  affection for him, and Little Douglas, feeling himself loved amid the  atmosphere of indifference around him, turned with open arms and heart  to George: it resulted from this mutual liking that one day, when the  child had committed I do not know what fault, and that William Douglas  raised the whip he beat his dogs with to strike him, that George, who  was sitting on a stone, sad and thoughtful, had immediately sprung up,  snatched the whip from his brother's hands and had thrown it far from  him. At this insult William had drawn his sword, and George his, so that  these two brothers, who had hated one another for twenty years like two  enemies, were going to cut one another's throats, when Little Douglas,  who had picked up the whip, coming back and kneeling before William,  offered him the ignominious weapon, saying,    \"Strike, cousin; I have deserved it.\"    This behaviour of the child had caused some minutes' reflection to the  two young men, who, terrified at the crime they were about to commit,  had returned their swords to their scabbards and had each gone away in  silence. Since this incident the friendship of George and Little Douglas  had acquired new strength, and on the child's side it had become  veneration.    We dwell upon all these details somewhat at length, perhaps, but no  doubt our readers will pardon us when they see the use to be made of  them.    This is the family, less George, who, as we have said, was absent at the  time of her arrival, into the midst of which the queen had fallen,  passing in a moment from the summit of power to the position of a  prisoner; for from the day following her arrival Mary saw that it was by  such a title she was an inmate of Lochleven Castle. In fact, Lady  Douglas presented herself before her as soon as it was morning, and with  an embarrassment and dislike ill disguised beneath an appearance of  respectful indifference, invited Mary to follow her and take stock of  the several parts of the fortress which had been chosen beforehand for  her private use. She then made her go through three rooms, of which one  was to serve as her bedroom, the second as sitting-room, and the third  as ante-chamber; afterwards, leading the way down a spiral staircase,  which looked into the great hall of the castle, its only outlet, she had  crossed this hall, and had taken Mary into the garden whose trees the  queen had seen topping the high walls on her arrival: it was a little  square of ground, forming a flower-bed in the midst of which was an  artificial fountain. It was entered by a very low door, repeated in the  opposite wall; this second door looked on to the lake and, like all the  castle doors, whose keys, however, never left the belt or the pillow of  William Douglas, it was guarded night and day by a sentinel. This was  now the whole domain of her who had possessed the palaces, the plains,  and the mountains of an entire kingdom.    Mary, on returning to her room, found breakfast ready, and William  Douglas standing near the table he was going to fulfil about the queen  the duties of carver and taster.    In spite of their hatred for Mary, the Douglases would have considered  it an eternal blemish on their honour if any accident should have  befallen the queen while she was dwelling in their castle; and it was in  order that the queen herself should not entertain any fear in this  respect that William Douglas, in his quality of lord of the manor, had  not only desired to carve before the queen, but even to taste first in  her presence, all the dishes served to her, as well as the water and the  several wines to be brought her. This precaution saddened Mary more than  it reassured her; for she understood that, while she stayed in the  castle, this ceremony would prevent any intimacy at table. However, it  proceeded from too noble an intention for her to impute it as a crime to  her hosts: she resigned herself, then, to this company, insupportable as  it was to her; only, from that day forward, she so cut short her meals  that all the time she was at Lochleven her longest dinners barely lasted  more than a quarter of an hour.    Two days after her arrival, Mary, on sitting down to table for  breakfast, found on her plate a letter addressed to her which had been  put there by William Douglas. Mary recognised Murray's handwriting, and  her first feeling was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2746"],[0,"Urbain Grandier (#14)"],[1," provosts, marshals, and other  officers, and to all our subjects in general, to lend whatever  assistance is necessary to carry out above order; and they are commanded  by these presents to obey all orders given by the said Sieur; and all  governors and lieutenants-general are also hereby commanded to furnish  the said Sieur with whatever aid he may require at their hands.\"    This document being the completion of the other, it was immediately  resolved, in order to show that they had the royal authority at their  back, and as a preventive measure, to arrest Grandier at once, without  any preliminary investigation. They hoped by this step to intimidate any  official who might still be inclined to take Grandier's part, and any  witness who might be disposed to testify in his favour. Accordingly,  they immediately sent for Guillaume Aubin, Sieur de Lagrange and  provost's lieutenant. De Laubardemont communicated to him the commission  of the cardinal and the order of the king, and requested him to arrest  Grandier early next morning. M. de Lagrange could not deny the two  signatures, and answered that he would obey; but as he foresaw from  their manner of going to work that the proceedings about to be  instituted would be an assassination and not a fair trial, he sent, in  spite of being a distant connection of Memin, whose daughter was married  to his (Lagrange's) brother, to warn Grandier of the orders he had  received. But Grandier with his usual intrepidity, while thanking  Lagrange for his generous message, sent back word that, secure in his  innocence and relying on the justice of God, he was determined to stand  his ground.    So Grandier remained, and his brother, who slept beside him, declared  that his sleep that night was as quiet as usual. The next morning he  rose, as was his habit, at six o'clock, took his breviary in his hand,  and went out with the intention of attending matins at the church of  Sainte-Croix. He had hardly put his foot over the threshold before  Lagrange, in the presence of Memin, Mignon, and the other conspirators,  who had come out to gloat over the sight, arrested him in the name of  the king. He was at once placed in the custody of Jean Pouguet, an  archer in His Majesty's guards, and of the archers of the provosts of  Loudun and Chinon, to be taken to the castle at Angers. Meanwhile a  search was instituted, and the royal seal affixed to the doors of his  apartments, to his presses, his other articles of furniture-in fact, to  every thing and place in the house; but nothing was found that tended to  compromise him, except an essay against the celibacy of priests, and two  sheets of paper whereon were written in another hand than his, some  love-poems in the taste of that time.          CHAPTER IX      For four months Grandier languished in prison, and, according to the  report of Michelon, commandant of Angers, and of Pierre Bacher, his  confessor, he was, during the whole period, a model of patience and  firmness, passing his days in reading good books or in writing prayers  and meditations, which were afterwards produced at his trial. Meanwhile,  in spite of the urgent appeals of Jeanne Esteye, mother of the accused,  who, although seventy years of age, seemed to recover her youthful  strength and activity in the desire to save her son, Laubardemont  continued the examination, which was finished on April 4th. Urbain was  then brought back from Angers to Loudun.    An extraordinary cell had been prepared for him in a house belonging to  Mignon, and which had formerly been occupied by a sergeant named  Bontems, once clerk to Trinquant, who had been a witness for the  prosecution in the first trial. It was on the topmost story; the windows  had been walled up, leaving only one small slit open, and even this  opening was secured by enormous iron bars; and by an exaggeration of  caution the mouth of the fireplace was furnished with a grating, lest  the devils should arrive through the chimney to free the sorcerer from  his chains. Furthermore, two holes in the corners of the room, so formed  that they were unnoticeable from within, allowed a constant watch to be  kept over Grandier's movements by Bontem's wife, a precaution by which  they hoped to learn something that would help them in the coming  exorcisms. In this room, lying on a little straw, and almost without  light, Grandier wrote the following letter to his mother:    \"MY MOTHER,--I received your letter and everything you sent me except  the woollen stockings. I endure any affliction with patience, and feel  more pity for you than for myself. I am very much inconvenienced for  want of a bed; try and have mine brought to me, for my mind will give  way if my body has no rest: if you can, send me a breviary, a Bible, and  a St. Thomas for my consolation; and above all, do not grieve for me. I  trust that, God will bring my innocence to light. Commend me to my  brother and sister, and all our good friends.--I am, mother, your  dutiful son and servant, \"GRANDIER\"    While Grandier had been in prison at Angers the cases of possession at  the convent had miraculously multiplied, for it was no longer only the  superior and Sister Claire who had fallen a prey to the evil spirits,  but also several other sisters, who were divided into three groups as  follows, and separated:--    The superior, with Sisters Louise des Anges and Anne de Sainte-Agnes,  were sent to the house of Sieur Delaville, advocate, legal adviser to  the sisterhood; Sisters Claire and Catherine de la Presentation were  placed in the house of Canon Maurat; Sisters Elisabeth de la Croix,  Monique de Sainte-Marthe, Jeanne du Sainte-Esprit, and Seraphique Archer  were in a third house.    A general supervision was undertaken by Memin's sister, the wife of  Moussant, who was thus closely connected with two of the greatest  enemies of the accused, and to her Bontems' wife told all that the  superior needed to know about Grandier. Such was the manner of the  sequestration!    The choice of physicians was no less extraordinary. Instead of calling  in the most skilled practitioners of Angers, Tours, Poitiers, or Saumur,  all of them, except Daniel Roger of Loudun, came from the surrounding  villages, and were men of no education: one of them, indeed, had failed  to obtain either degree or licence, and had been obliged to leave Saumur  in consequence; another had been employed in a small shop to take goods  home, a position he had exchanged for the more lucrative one of quack.    There was just as little sense of fairness and propriety shown in the  choice of the apothecary and surgeon. The apothecary, whose name was  Adam, was Mignon's first cousin, and had been one of the witnesses for  the prosecution at Grandier's first trial; and as on that occasion--he  had libelled a young girl of Loudun, he had been sentenced by a decree  of Parliament to make a public apology. And yet, though his hatred of  Grandier in consequence of this humiliation was so well known,--perhaps  for that very reason, it was to him the duty of dispensing and  administering the prescriptions was entrusted, no one supervising the  work even so far as to see that the proper doses were given, or taking  note whether for sedatives he did not sometimes substitute stimulating  and exciting drugs, capable of producing real convulsions. The surgeon  Mannouri was still more unsuitable, for he was a nephew of Memin de  Silly, and brother of the nun who had offered the most determined  opposition to Grandier's demand for sequestration of the possessed  sisters, during the second series of exorcisms. In vain did the mother  and brother of the accused present petitions setting forth the  incapacity of the doctors and the hatred of Grandier professed by the  apothecary; they could not, even at their own expense, obtain certified  copies of any of these petitions, although they had witnesses ready to  prove that Adam had once in his ignorance dispensed crocus metallorum  for crocus mantis--a mistake which had caused the death of the patient  for whom the prescription was made up. In short, so determined were the  conspirators that this time Grandier should be done to death, that they  had not even the decency to conceal the infamous methods by which they  had arranged to attain this result.    The examination was carried on with vigour. As one of the first  formalities would be the identification of the accused, Grandier  published a memorial in which he recalled the case of Saint-Anastasius  at the Council of Tyre, who had been accused of immorality by a fallen  woman whom he had never seen before. When this woman entered the hall of  justice in order to swear to her deposition, a priest named Timothy went  up to her and began to talk to her as if he were Anastasius; falling  into the trap, she answered as if she recognised him, and thus the  innocence of the saint was shown forth. Grandier therefore demanded that  two or three persons of his own height and complexion should be dressed  exactly like himself, and with him should be allowed to confront the  nuns. As he had never seen any of them, and was almost certain they had  never seen him, they would not be able, he felt sure, to point him out  with certainty, in spite of the allegations of undue intimacy with  themselves they brought against him. This demand showed such conscious  innocence that it was embarrassing to answer, so no notice was taken of  it.    Meanwhile the Bishop of Poitiers, who felt much elated at getting the  better of the Archbishop of Bordeaux, who of course was powerless  against an order issued by the cardinal-duke, took exception to Pere  l'Escaye and Pere Gaut, the exorcists appointed by his superior, and  named instead his own chaplain, who had been judge at Grandier's first  trial, and had passed sentence on him, and Pere Lactance, a Franciscan  monk. These two, making no secret of the side with which they  sympathised, put"]]]
