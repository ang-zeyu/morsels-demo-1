Amid those strange people he seemed to her ever  nearer, ever dearer, altogether true, and devoted with his whole soul.  He pacified her; he promised to rescue her from the house of Caesar; he  promised not to desert her, and said that he would serve her. Besides,  he had spoken before at Aulus's only in general about love and the  happiness which it can give; but now he said directly that he loved her,  and that she was dear and most precious to him. Lygia heard such words  from a man's lips for the first time; and as she heard them it seemed  to her that something was wakening in her as from a sleep, that some  species of happiness was embracing her in which immense delight was  mingled with immense alarm. Her cheeks began to burn, her heart to beat,  her mouth opened as in wonder. She was seized with fear because she was  listening to such things, still she did not wish for any cause on earth  to lose one word. At moments she dropped her eyes; then again she raised  her clear glance to Vinicius, timid and also inquiring, as if she wished  to say to him, \"Speak on!\" The sound of the music, the odor of flowers  and of Arabian perfumes, began to daze her. In Rome it was the custom to  recline at banquets, but at home Lygia occupied a place between Pomponia  and little Aulus. Now Vinicius was reclining near her, youthful,  immense, in love, burning; and she, feeling the heat that issued from  him, felt both delight and shame. A kind of sweet weakness, a kind of  faintness and forgetfulness seized her; it was as if drowsiness tortured  her.    But her nearness to him began to act on Vinicius also. His nostrils  dilated, like those of an Eastern steed. The beating of his heart with  unusual throb was evident under his scarlet tunic; his breathing grew  short, and the expressions that fell from his lips were broken. For the  first time, too, he was so near her. His thoughts grew disturbed; he  felt a flame in his veins which he tried in vain to quench with wine.  Not wine, but her marvellous face, her bare arms, her maiden breast  heaving under the golden tunic, and her form hidden in the white folds  of the peplus, intoxicated him more and more. Finally, he seized her arm  above the wrist, as he had done once at Aulus's, and drawing her toward  him whispered, with trembling lips,--\"I love thee, Callina,--divine  one.\"    \"Let me go, Marcus,\" said Lygia.    But he continued, his eyes mist-covered, \"Love me, my goddess!\"    But at that moment was heard the voice of Acte, who was reclining on the  other side of Lygia.    \"Caesar is looking at you both.\"    Vinicius was carried away by sudden anger at Caesar and at Acte. Her  words had broken the charm of his intoxication. To the young man even  a friendly voice would have seemed repulsive at such a moment, but he  judged that Acte wished purposely to interrupt his conversation with  Lygia. So, raising his head and looking over the shoulder of Lygia at  the young freedwoman, he said with malice:    \"The hour has passed, Acte, when thou didst recline near Caesar's side  at banquets, and they say that blindness is threatening thee; how then  canst thou see him?\"    But she answered as if in sadness: \"Still I see him. He, too, has short  sight, and is looking at thee through an emerald.\"    Everything that Nero did roused attention, even in those nearest  him; hence Vinicius was alarmed. He regained self-control, and began  imperceptibly to look toward Caesar. Lygia, who, embarrassed at the  beginning of the banquet, had seen Nero as in a mist, and afterward,  occupied by the presence and conversation of Vinicius, had not looked at  him at all, turned to him eyes at once curious and terrified.    Acte spoke truly. Caesar had bent over the table, half-closed one eye,  and holding before the other a round polished emerald, which he used,  was looking at them. For a moment his glance met Lygia's eyes, and the  heart of the maiden was straitened with terror. When still a child on  Aulus's Sicilian estate, an old Egyptian slave had told her of dragons  which occupied dens in the mountains, and it seemed to her now that all  at once the greenish eye of such a monster was gazing at her. She caught  at Vinicius's hand as a frightened child would, and disconnected, quick  impressions pressed into her head: Was not that he, the terrible, the  all-powerful? She had not seen him hitherto, and she thought that he  looked differently. She had imagined some kind of ghastly face, with  malignity petrified in its features; now she saw a great head, fixed on  a thick neck, terrible, it is true, but almost ridiculous, for from a  distance it resembled the head of a child. A tunic of amethyst color,  forbidden to ordinary mortals, cast a bluish tinge on his broad and  short face. He had dark hair, dressed, in the fashion introduced by  Otho, in four curls.    He had no beard, because he had sacrificed it recently to Jove,--for  which all Rome gave him thanks, though people whispered to each other  that he had sacrificed it because his beard, like that of his whole  family, was red. In his forehead, projecting strongly above his  brows, there remained something Olympian. In his contracted brows the  consciousness of supreme power was evident; but under that forehead of  a demigod was the face of a monkey, a drunkard, and a comedian,--vain,  full of changing desires, swollen with fat, notwithstanding his youth;  besides, it was sickly and foul. To Lygia he seemed ominous, but above  all repulsive.    After a while he laid down the emerald and ceased to look at her. Then  she saw his prominent blue eyes, blinking before the excess of light,  glassy, without thought, resembling the eyes of the dead.    \"Is that the hostage with whom Vinicius is in love?\" asked he, turning  to Petronius.    \"That is she,\" answered Petronius.    \"What are her people called?\"    \"The Lygians.\"    \"Does Vinicius think her beautiful?\"    \"Array a rotten olive trunk in the peplus of a woman, and Vinicius will  declare it beautiful. But on thy countenance, incomparable judge, I read  her sentence already. Thou hast no need to pronounce it! The sentence is  true: she is too dry, thin, a mere blossom on a slender stalk; and thou,  O divine aesthete, esteemest the stalk in a woman. Thrice and four times  art thou right! The face alone does not signify. I have learned much in  thy company, but even now I have not a perfect cast of the eye. But I am  ready to lay a wager with Tullius Senecio concerning his mistress, that,  although at a feast, when all are reclining, it is difficult to judge  the whole form, thou hast said in thy mind already, 'Too narrow in the  hips.'\"    \"Too narrow in the hips,\" answered Nero, blinking.    On Petronius's lips appeared a scarcely perceptible smile; but Tullius  Senecio, who till that moment was occupied in conversing with Vestinius,  or rather in reviling dreams, while Vestinius believed in them, turned  to Petronius, and though he had not the least idea touching that of  which they were talking, he said,--\"Thou art mistaken! I hold with  Caesar.\"    \"Very well,\" answered Petronius. \"I have just maintained that thou hast  a glimmer of understanding, but Caesar insists that thou art an ass pure  and simple.\"    \"Habet!\" said Caesar, laughing, and turning down the thumb, as was done  in the Circus, in sign that the gladiator had received a blow and was to  be finished.    But Vestinius, thinking that the question was of dreams,  exclaimed,--\"But I believe in dreams, and Seneca told me on a time that  he believes too.\"    \"Last night I dreamt that I had become a vestal virgin,\" said Calvia  Crispinilla, bending over the table.    At this Nero clapped his hands, other followed, and in a moment clapping  of hands was heard all around,--for Crispinilla had been divorced  a number of times, and was known throughout Rome for her fabulous  debauchery.    But she, not disconcerted in the least, said,--\"Well! They are all old  and ugly. Rubria alone has a human semblance, and so there would be two  of us, though Rubria gets freckles in summer.\"    \"But admit, purest Calvia,\" said Petronius, \"that thou couldst become a  vestal only in dreams.\"    \"But if Caesar commanded?\"    \"I should believe that even the most impossible dreams might come true.\"    \"But they do come true,\" said Vestinius. \"I understand those who do not  believe in the gods, but how is it possible not to believe in dreams?\"    \"But predictions?\" inquired Nero. \"It was predicted once to me, that  Rome would cease to exist, and that I should rule the whole Orient.\"    \"Predictions and dreams are connected,\" said Vestinius. \"Once a certain  proconsul, a great disbeliever, sent a slave to the temple of Mopsus  with a sealed letter which he would not let any one open; he did this  to try if the god could answer the question contained in the letter. The  slave slept a night in the temple to have a prophetic dream; he returned  then and said: 'I saw a youth in my dreams; he was as bright as the sun,  and spoke only one word, \"Black.\"' The proconsul, when he heard this,  grew pale, and turning to his guests, disbelievers like himself, said:  'Do ye know what was in the letter?'\" Here Vestinius stopped, and,  raising his goblet with wine, began to drink.    \"What was in the letter?\" asked Senecio.    \"In the letter was the question: 'What is the color of the bull which I  am to sacrifice: white or black?'\"    But the interest roused by the narrative was interrupted by Vitelius,  who, drunk when he came to the feast, burst forth on a sudden and  without cause in senseless laughter.    \"What is that keg of tallow laughing at?\" asked Nero.    \"Laughter distinguishes men from animals,\" said Petronius, \"and he has  no other proof that he is not a wild boar.\"    Vitelius stopped half-way in his laughter, and smacking his lips,  shining from fat and sauces, looked at those present with as much  astonishment as if "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28536"],[0,"The Astronomy of the Bible (#14)"],[1," may seem so  erroneous as to be absurd. It is little more than a century since one of  the greatest of astronomers, Sir William Herschel, contended that the  central globe of the sun might be a habitable world, sheltered from the  blazing photosphere by a layer of cool non-luminous clouds. Such an  hypothesis was not incompatible with what was then known of the  constitution of the heavenly bodies, though it is incompatible with what  we know now. It was simply a matter on which more evidence was to be  accumulated, and the holding of such a view does not, and did not,  detract from the scientific status of Sir William Herschel.    The hypotheses of science require continual restatement in the light of  new evidence, and, as to the weight and interpretation to be given to  such evidence, there is continual conflict--if it may so be  called--between the old and the new science, between the science that is  established and the science that is being established. It is by this  conflict that knowledge is rendered sure.    Such a conflict took place rather more than 300 years ago at the opening  of the Modern Era of astronomy. It was a conflict between two schools of  science--between the disciples of Aristotle and Claudius Ptolemy on the  one hand and the disciples of Copernicus on the other. It has often been  represented as a conflict between religion and science, whereas that  which happened was that the representatives of the older school of  science made use of the powers of the Church to persecute the newer  school as represented by Galileo. That persecution was no doubt a  flagrant abuse of authority, but it should be impossible at the present  day for any one to claim a theological standing for either theory,  whether Copernican or Ptolemaic.    So long as evidence sufficient to demonstrate the Copernican hypothesis  was not forthcoming, it was possible for a man to hold the Ptolemaic,  without detracting from his scientific position, just as it is thought  no discredit to Sir William Herschel that he held his curious idea of a  cool sun under the conditions of knowledge of a hundred years ago. Even  at the present day, we habitually use the Ptolemaic phraseology. Not  only do we speak of \"sunrise\" and \"sunset,\" but astronomers in strictly  technical papers use the expression, \"acceleration of the sun's motion\"  when \"acceleration of the earth's motion\" is meant.    The question as to whether the earth goes round the sun or the sun goes  round the earth has been decided by the accumulation of evidence. It was  a question for evidence to decide. It was an open question so long as  the evidence available was not sufficient to decide it. It was perfectly  possible at one time for a scientific or a religious man to hold either  view. Neither view interfered with his fundamental standing or with his  mental attitude towards either sun or earth. In this respect--important  as the question is in itself--it might be said to be a mere detail,  almost a matter of indifference.    But it is not a mere detail, a matter of indifference to either  scientist or religious man, as to what the sun and earth _are_--whether  he can treat them as things that can be weighed, measured, compared,  analyzed, as, a few pages back, we have shown has been done, or whether,  as one of the chief astrologers of to-day puts it, he--         \"Believes that the sun is the body of the Logos of this solar       system, 'in Him we live and move and have our being.' The       planets are his angels, being modifications in the       consciousness of the Logos,\"    and that the sun         \"Stands as Power, having Love and Will united.\"    The difference between these two points of view is fundamental, and one  of root principle. The foundation, the common foundation on which both  the believer and the scientist build, is threatened by this false  science and false religion. The calling, the very existence of both is  assailed, and they must stand or fall together. The believer in one God  cannot acknowledge a Sun-god, a Solar Logos, these planetary angels; the  astronomer cannot admit the intrusion of planetary influences that obey  no known laws, and the supposed effects of which are in no way  proportional to the supposed causes. The Law of Causality does not run  within the borders of astrology.    It is the old antithesis restated of the Hebrew and the heathen. The  believer in one God and the scientist alike derive their heritage from  the Hebrew, whilst the modern astrologer claims that the astrology of  to-day is once more a revelation of the Chaldean and Assyrian religions.  But polytheism--whether in its gross form of many gods, of planetary  angels, or in the more subtle form of pantheism,--is the very negation  of sane religion; and astrology is the negation of sane astronomy.         \"For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the       world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that       are made, even His eternal power and Godhead; so that they are       without excuse: because that, when they knew God, they       glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but became       vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was       darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,       and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image       made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted       beasts, and creeping things.\"      FOOTNOTES:    [68:1] Josephus, _Antiquities_, XIII. iii. 1.          CHAPTER VII    THE MOON         \"The balmy moon of blessed Israel          Floods all the deep-blue gloom with beams divine:        All night the splintered crags that wall the dell          With spires of silver shine.\"      So, in Tennyson's words, sang Jephthah's daughter, as she recalled the  days of her mourning before she accomplished her self-sacrifice.    It is hard for modern dwellers in towns to realize the immense  importance of the moon to the people of old. \"The night cometh when no  man can work\" fitly describes their condition when she was absent. In  sub-tropical countries like Palestine, twilight is short, and, the sun  once set, deep darkness soon covers everything. Such artificial lights  as men then had would now be deemed very inefficient. There was little  opportunity, when once darkness had fallen, for either work or  enjoyment.    But, when the moon was up, how very different was the case. Then men  might say--         \"This night, methinks, is but the daylight sick;          It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,        Such as the day is when the sun is hid.\"    In the long moonlit nights, travelling was easy and safe; the labours  of the field and house could still be carried on; the friendly feast  need not be interrupted. But of all men, the shepherd would most rejoice  at this season; all his toils, all his dangers were immeasurably  lightened during the nights near the full. As in the beautiful rendering  which Tennyson has given us of one of the finest passages in the  _Iliad_--               \"In heaven the stars about the moon       Look beautiful, when all the winds are laid,       And every height comes out, and jutting peak       And valley, and the immeasurable heavens       Break open to their highest, and all the stars       Shine, and the Shepherd gladdens in his heart.\"    A large proportion of the people of Israel, long after their settlement  in Palestine, maintained the habits of their forefathers, and led the  shepherd's life. To them, therefore, the full of the moon must have been  of special importance; yet there is no single reference in Scripture to  this phase as such; nor indeed to any change of the moon's apparent  figure. In two cases in our Revised Version we do indeed find the  expression \"at the full moon,\" but if we compare these passages with the  Authorized Version, we find them there rendered \"in the time appointed,\"  or \"at the day appointed.\" This latter appears to be the literal  meaning, though there can be no question, as is seen by a comparison  with the Syriac, that the period of the full moon is referred to. No  doubt it was because travelling was so much more safe and easy than in  the moonless nights, that the two great spring and autumn festivals of  the Jews were held at the full moon. Indeed, the latter feast, when the  Israelites \"camped out\" for a week \"in booths,\" was held at the time of  the \"harvest moon.\" The phenomenon of the \"harvest moon\" may be briefly  explained as follows. At the autumnal equinox, when the sun is crossing  from the north side of the equator to the south, the full moon is  crossing from the south side of the equator to the north. It is thus  higher in the sky, when it souths, on each succeeding night, and is  therefore up for a greater length of time. This counterbalances to a  considerable extent its movement eastward amongst the stars, so that,  for several nights in succession, it rises almost at sundown. These  nights of the Feast of Tabernacles, when all Israel was rejoicing over  the ingathered fruits, each family in its tent or arbour of green  boughs, were therefore the fullest of moonlight in the year.[81:1]    Modern civilization has almost shut us off from the heavens, at least in  our great towns and cities. These offer many conveniences, but they  remove us from not a few of the beauties which nature has to offer. And  so it comes that, taking the population as a whole, there is perhaps  less practically known of astronomy in England to-day than there was  under the Plantagenets. A very few are astronomers, professional and  amateur, and know immeasurably more than our forefathers did of the  science. Then there is a large, more or less cultured, public that know  something of the science at secondhand through books. But the great  majority know nothing of the heavenly bodies except of the sun; they  need to \"look in the almanack\" to \"find out moonshine.\" But"]]]
