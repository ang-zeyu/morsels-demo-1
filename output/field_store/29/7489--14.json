As, for instance, she would say to herself, and believe it: \"Isn't  it good that I can have a vacation and a rest. What shall I do to  get all I can out of it?    \"I think I will go and see what they are doing in the grammar  school. Maybe when I get there it will amuse me to teach some of the  children. It is always interesting to see how children are going to  take what you say to them and to see the different ways in which  they recite their lessons.\"    By the time she got to school she was very much cheered. Looking up  she said to herself: \"This must be the building.\"    She had been in it every school day for five years past, but through  the process of her little game it looked quite new and strange now.    She went in the door and when the children said \"good morning,\" and  some of them seemed glad to see her, she said to herself: \"Why, they  seem to know me; I wonder how that happens?\" Occasionally she was so  much amused at her own consistency in keeping up the game that she  nearly laughed outright. She heard each class recite as if she were  teaching for the first time. She looked upon each separate child as  if she had never seen him before and he was interesting to her as a  novel study.    She found the schoolroom more cheerful and was surprised into  perceiving a pleasant sort of silent communication that started up  between her pupils and herself.    When school was over she put on her hat and coat to go home, with  the sense of having done something restful; and when she appeared to  her mother, it was with a smiling, cheerful face, which made her  mother laugh outright; and then they both laughed and went out for a  walk in the fresh air, before coming in to go to bed, and be ready  to begin again the next day.    In the morning the mother felt a little anxious and asked timidly:  \"Do you believe you can make it work again today, just as well as  yesterday?\"    \"Yes, indeed and better,\" said the daughter. \"It is too much fun not  to go on with it.\"    After breakfast the mother with a little roguish twinkle, said:  \"Well, what do you think you will do to amuse yourself to-day,  Alice?\"    \"Oh! I think--\" and then they both laughed and Alice started off on  her second day's \"vacation.\"    By the end of a week she was out of that tired rut and having a very  good time. New ideas had come to her about the school and the  children; in fact, from being dead and heavy in her work, she had  become alive.    When she found the old tired state coming on her again, she and her  mother always \"took a vacation,\" and every time avoided the tired  rut more easily.    If one only has imagination enough, the helpfulness and restfulness  of playing \"take a vacation\" will tell equally well in any kind of  work.    You can play at dressmaking--play at millinery--play at keeping  shop. You can make a game of any sort of drudgery, and do the work  better for it, as well as keep better rested and more healthy  yourself. But you must be steady and persistent and childlike in the  way you play your game.    Do not stop in the middle and exclaim, \"How silly!\"--and then slump  into the tired state again.    What I am telling you is nothing more nor less than a good healthy  process of self-hypnotism. Really, it is more the attitude we take  toward our work that tires us than the work itself. If we could only  learn that and realize it as a practical fact, it would save a great  deal of unnecessary suffering and even illness.    We do not need to play vacation all the time, of course. The game  might get stale then and lose its power. If we play it for two or  three days, whenever we get so tired that it seems as if we could  not bear it--play it just long enough to lift ourselves out of the  rut--then we can \"go to work again\" until we need another vacation.    We need not be afraid nor ashamed to bring back that childlike  tendency--it will be of very great use to our mature minds.    If we try to play the vacation game, it is wiser to say nothing  about it. It is not a game that we can be sure of sharing profitably  either to ourselves or to others.    If you find it works, and give the secret to a friend, tell her to  play it without mentioning it to you, even though she shares your  work and is sitting in the next chair to you.    Another most healthy process of resting while you work is by means  of lowering the pressure.    Suppose you were an engine, whose normal pressure was six hundred  pounds, we will say. Make yourself work at a pressure of only three  hundred pounds.    The human engine works with so much more strain than is necessary  that if a woman gets overtired and tries to lighten her work by  lightening the pressure with which she does it, she will find that  really she has only thrown off the unnecessary strain, and is not  only getting over her fatigue by working restfully, but is doing her  work better, too.    In the process of learning to use less pressure, the work may seem  to be going a little more slowly at first, but we shall find that it  will soon go faster, and better, as time establishes the better  habit.    One thing seems singular; and yet it appeals entirely to our common  sense as we think of it. There never comes a time when we cannot  learn to work more effectively at a lower pressure. We never get to  where we cannot lessen our pressure and thus increase our power.    The very interest of using less pressure adds zest to our work,  however it may have seemed like drudging before, and the possibility  of resting while we work opens to us much that is new and  refreshing, and gives us clearer understanding of how to rest more  completely while we rest.    All kinds of resting, and all kinds of working, can bring more  vitality than most of us know, until we have learned to rest and to  work without strain.          CHAPTER XIII    _The Woman at the Next Desk_      IT may be the woman sewing in the next chair; it may be the woman  standing next at the same counter; it may be the woman next at a  working table, or it may be the woman at the next desk.    Whichever one it is, many a working woman has her life made wretched  by her, and it would be a strange thing for this miserable woman to  hear and a stranger thing--at first--for her to believe that the  woman at the next desk need not trouble her at all.    That, if she only could realize it, the cause of the irritation  which annoyed her every day and dragged her down so that many and  many a night she had been home with a sick headache was entirely and  solely in herself and not at all in the woman who worked next to  her, however disagreeable that woman may have been.    Every morning when she wakes the woman at the next desk rises before  her like a black specter. \"Oh, I would not mind the work; I could  work all day happily and quietly and go home at night and rest; the  work would be a joy to me compared to this torture of having to live  all day next to that woman.\"    It is odd, too, and true, that if the woman at the next desk finds  that she is annoying our friend, unconsciously she seems to ferret  out her most sensitive places and rub them raw with her sharp,  discourteous words.    She seems to shirk her own work purposely and to arrange it so that  the woman next her must do the work in her place. Then, having done  all in her power to give the woman next her harder labor, she snaps  out a little scornful remark about the mistakes that have been made.    If she--the woman at the next desk--comes in in the morning feeling  tired and irritable herself, she vents her irritability on her  companion until she has worked it off and goes home at night feeling  much better herself, while her poor neighbor goes home tired out and  weak.    The woman at the next desk takes pains to let little disagreeable  hints drop about others--if not directly in their hearing at least  in ways which she knows may reach them.    She drops hint to others of what those in higher office have said or  appeared to think, which might frighten \"others\" quite out of their  wits for fear of their being discharged, and then, where should they  get their bread and butter?    All this and more that is frightful and disagreeable and mean may  the woman at the next desk do; or she may be just plain, every-day  _ugly._    Every one knows the trying phases of her own working neighbor. But  with all this, and with worse possibilities of harassment than I  have even touched upon, the woman at the next desk is powerless, so  far as I am concerned, if I choose to make her so.    The reason she troubles me is because I resist her. If she hurts my  feelings, that is the same thing. I resist her, and the resistance,  instead of making me angry, makes me sore in my nerves and makes me  want to cry. The way to get independent of her is not to resist her,  and the way to learn not to resist her is to make a daily and hourly  study of dropping all resistances to her.    This study has another advantage, too; if we once get well started  on it, it becomes so interesting that the concentration on this new  interest brings new life in itself.    Resistance in the mind brings contraction in the body. If, when we  find our minds resisting that which is disagreeable in another, we  give our attention at once to finding the resultant contraction in  our bodies, and then concentrate our wills on loosening out of the  contraction, we cannot help getting an immediate result.    Even though it is a small result at the beginning, if we persist,  results will grow until we, literally, find ourselves free from the  woman at the next desk.    This woman says a disagreeable thing; we contract to it mind and  body. We drop the contraction from our bodies, with the desire to  drop it from our minds, for loosening the physical tension reacts  upon the mental strain and relieves it.    We "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4341"],[0,"Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (#14)"],[1,"its, moving to new abodes, and taking to new  sorts of food. In all such cases there will be no extermination, even no  competition--the new adaptation being a relief from competition, if it  ever existed; and yet there will be, after a time, an absence of  intermediate links, in consequence of a mere survival of those which are  best fitted for the new conditions--as surely as under the hypothesis of  extermination of the parental form. It hardly need be added that if we  admit, with Spencer, all the Lamarckians, and Darwin himself, the  modifying influence of the surroundings upon the species, there remains  still less necessity for the extermination of the intermediate forms.    The importance of migration and of the consequent isolation of groups of  animals, for the origin of new varieties and ultimately of new species,  which was indicated by Moritz Wagner, was fully recognized by Darwin  himself. Consequent researches have only accentuated the importance of  this factor, and they have shown how the largeness of the area occupied  by a given species--which Darwin considered with full reason so  important for the appearance of new varieties--can be combined with the  isolation of parts of the species, in consequence of local geological  changes, or of local barriers. It would be impossible to enter here into  the discussion of this wide question, but a few remarks will do to  illustrate the combined action of these agencies. It is known that  portions of a given species will often take to a new sort of food. The  squirrels, for instance, when there is a scarcity of cones in the larch  forests, remove to the fir-tree forests, and this change of food has  certain well-known physiological effects on the squirrels. If this  change of habits does not last--if next year the cones are again  plentiful in the dark larch woods--no new variety of squirrels will  evidently arise from this cause. But if part of the wide area occupied  by the squirrels begins to have its physical characters altered--in  consequence of, let us say, a milder climate or desiccation, which both  bring about an increase of the pine forests in proportion to the larch  woods--and if some other conditions concur to induce the squirrels to  dwell on the outskirts of the desiccating region--we shall have then a  new variety, i.e. an incipient new species of squirrels, without there  having been anything that would deserve the name of extermination among  the squirrels. A larger proportion of squirrels of the new, better  adapted variety would survive every year, and the intermediate links  would die in the course of time, without having been starved out by  Malthusian competitors. This is exactly what we see going on during the  great physical changes which are accomplished over large areas in  Central Asia, owing to the desiccation which is going on there since the  glacial period.    To take another example, it has been proved by geologists that the  present wild horse (Equus Przewalski) has slowly been evolved during the  later parts of the Tertiary and the Quaternary period, but that during  this succession of ages its ancestors were not confined to some given,  limited area of the globe. They wandered over both the Old and New  World, returning, in all probability, after a time to the pastures which  they had, in the course of their migrations, formerly left.(34)  Consequently, if we do not find now, in Asia, all the intermediate links  between the present wild horse and its Asiatic Post-Tertiary ancestors,  this does not mean at all that the intermediate links have been  exterminated. No such extermination has ever taken place. No exceptional  mortality may even have occurred among the ancestral species: the  individuals which belonged to intermediate varieties and species have  died in the usual course of events--often amidst plentiful food, and  their remains were buried all over the globe.    In short, if we carefully consider this matter, and, carefully re-read  what Darwin himself wrote upon this subject, we see that if the word  \"extermination\" be used at all in connection with transitional  varieties, it must be used in its metaphoric sense. As to \"competition,\"  this expression, too, is continually used by Darwin (see, for instance,  the paragraph \"On Extinction\") as an image, or as a way-of-speaking,  rather than with the intention of conveying the idea of a real  competition between two portions of the same species for the means of  existence. At any rate, the absence of intermediate forms is no argument  in favour of it.    In reality, the chief argument in favour of a keen competition for the  means of existence continually going on within every animal species  is--to use Professor Geddes' expression--the \"arithmetical argument\"  borrowed from Malthus.    But this argument does not prove it at all. We might as well take a  number of villages in South-East Russia, the inhabitants of which enjoy  plenty of food, but have no sanitary accommodation of any kind; and  seeing that for the last eighty years the birth-rate was sixty in the  thousand, while the population is now what it was eighty years ago, we  might conclude that there has been a terrible competition between the  inhabitants. But the truth is that from year to year the population  remained stationary, for the simple reason that one-third of the  new-born died before reaching their sixth month of life; one-half died  within the next four years, and out of each hundred born, only seventeen  or so reached the age of twenty. The new-comers went away before having  grown to be competitors. It is evident that if such is the case with  men, it is still more the case with animals. In the feathered world the  destruction of the eggs goes on on such a tremendous scale that eggs are  the chief food of several species in the early summer; not to, say a  word of the storms, the inundations which destroy nests by the million  in America, and the sudden changes of weather which are fatal to the  young mammals. Each storm, each inundation, each visit of a rat to a  bird's nest, each sudden change of temperature, take away those  competitors which appear so terrible in theory.    As to the facts of an extremely rapid increase of horses and cattle in  America, of pigs and rabbits in New Zealand, and even of wild animals  imported from Europe (where their numbers are kept down by man, not by  competition), they rather seem opposed to the theory of over-population.  If horses and cattle could so rapidly multiply in America, it simply  proved that, however numberless the buffaloes and other ruminants were  at that time in the New World, its grass-eating population was far below  what the prairies could maintain. If millions of intruders have found  plenty of food without starving out the former population of the  prairies, we must rather conclude that the Europeans found a want of  grass-eaters in America, not an excess. And we have good reasons to  believe that want of animal population is the natural state of things  all over the world, with but a few temporary exceptions to the rule. The  actual numbers of animals in a given region are determined, not by the  highest feeding capacity of the region, but by what it is every year  under the most unfavourable conditions. So that, for that reason alone,  competition hardly can be a normal condition. But other causes intervene  as well to cut, down the animal population below even that low standard.  If we take the horses and cattle which are grazing all the winter  through in the Steppes of Transbaikalia, we find them very lean and  exhausted at the end of the winter. But they grow exhausted not because  there is not enough food for all of them--the grass buried under a thin  sheet of snow is everywhere in abundance--but because of the difficulty  of getting it from beneath the snow, and this difficulty is the same for  all horses alike. Besides, days of glazed frost are common in early  spring, and if several such days come in succession the horses grow  still more exhausted. But then comes a snow-storm, which compels the  already weakened animals to remain without any food for several days,  and very great numbers of them die. The losses during the spring are so  severe that if the season has been more inclement than usual they are  even not repaired by the new breeds--the more so as all horses are  exhausted, and the young foals are born in a weaker condition. The  numbers of horses and cattle thus always remain beneath what they  otherwise might be; all the year round there is food for five or ten  times as many animals, and yet their population increases extremely  slowly. But as soon as the Buriate owner makes ever so small a provision  of hay in the steppe, and throws it open during days of glazed frost, or  heavier snow-fall, he immediately sees the increase of his herd. Almost  all free grass-eating animals and many rodents in Asia and America being  in very much the same conditions, we can safely say that their numbers  are not kept down by competition; that at no time of the year they can  struggle for food, and that if they never reach anything approaching to  over-population, the cause is in the climate, not in competition.    The importance of natural checks to over-multiplication, and especially  their bearing upon the competition hypothesis, seems never to have been  taken into due account. The checks, or rather some of them, are  mentioned, but their action is seldom studied in detail. However, if we  compare the action of the natural checks with that of competition, we  must recognize at once that the latter sustains no comparison whatever  with the other checks. Thus, Mr. Bates mentions the really astounding  numbers of winged ants which are destroyed during their exodus. The dead  or half-dead bodies of the formica de fuego (Myrmica saevissima) which  had been blown into the river during a gale \"were heaped in a line"]]]
