But we cannot linger over the wedding festivities.    Adieu, young friends! and may joy crown you, love bless you, God speed  your career!      \"Some natural tears they dropp'd, but wip'd them soon;    The world was all before them, where to choose    Their place of rest, and Providence their guide.    They, hand in hand, with wand'ring steps and slow,    Through Eden took their solitary way.\"          CHAPTER IX.    HONEYMOONING.         \"The importance of the honeymoon, which had been so much vaunted       to him by his father, had not held good.\"--_The Married Life of       Albert Durer._      The \"honeymoon\" is defined by Johnson to be \"the first month after  marriage, when there is nothing but tenderness and pleasure.\" And  certainly it ought to be the happiest month in our lives; but it may,  like every other good thing, be spoiled by mismanagement. When this is  the case, we take our honeymoon like other pleasures--sadly. Instead of  happy reminiscences, nothing is left of it except its jars.    You take, says the philosophical observer, a man and a woman, who in  nine cases out of ten know very little about each other (though they  generally fancy they do), you cut off the woman from all her female  friends, you deprive the man of his ordinary business and ordinary  pleasures, and you condemn this unhappy pair to spend a month of  enforced seclusion in each other's society. If they marry in the summer  and start on a tour, the man is oppressed with a plethora of  sight-seeing, while the lady, as often as not, becomes seriously ill  from fatigue and excitement.    A newly-married man took his bride on a tour to Switzerland for the  honeymoon, and when there induced her to attempt with him the ascent of  one of the high peaks. The lady, who at home had never ascended a hill  higher than a church, was much alarmed, and had to be carried by the  guides with her eyes blindfolded, so as not to witness the horrors of  the passage. The bridegroom walked close to her, expostulating  respecting her fear. He spoke in honeymoon whispers; but the rarefaction  of the air was such that every word was audible. \"You told me, Leonora,  that you always felt happy--no matter where you were--so long as you  were in my company. Then why are you not happy now?\" \"Yes, Charles, I  did,\" replied she; sobbing hysterically; \"but I never meant above the  snow line.\" It is at such times as these that awkward angles of temper  make themselves manifest, which, under a more sensible system, might  have been concealed for years, perhaps for ever.    Boswell called upon Dr. Johnson on the morning of the day on which he  was to leave for Scotland--for matrimonial purposes. The prospect of  connubial felicity had made the expectant husband voluble; he therefore  took courage to recite to the sage a little love-song which he had  himself composed and which Dibdin was to set to music:      A MATRIMONIAL THOUGHT.      \"In the blythe days of honeymoon,      With Kate's allurements smitten,    I loved her late, I loved her soon,      And called her dearest kitten.      But now my kitten's grown a cat,      And cross like other wives,    Oh! by my soul, my honest Mat,      I fear she has nine lives.\"    _Johnson_: \"It is very well, sir, but you should not swear.\" Whereupon  the obnoxious \"Oh! by my soul,\" was changed on the instant to \"Alas!  alas!\"    If the kitten should develop into a cat even before the \"blythe days of  honeymoon\" are ended, it is no wonder, considering the way some young  couples spend the first month of married life, rushing from one  continental city to another, and visiting all the churches and  picture-galleries, however scorching may be the weather or however great  may be their secret aversion to art and antiquity. The lady gives way to  fatigue, and is seized with a violent headache. For a while the young  husband thinks that it is rather nice to support his Kate's head, but  when she answers his sympathetic inquiries sharply and petulantly, he in  turn becomes less amiable, dazzling, enchanting, and, in a word, all  that as a _fiance_ he had been.    Winter honeymooning is even more trying to the temper, for then short  days and unfavourable weather compel the young couple to stay in one  place. Imagine the delights of a month spent in lodgings at the seaside,  with nothing to do except to get photographed, which is a favourite  pastime of the newly-married. The bride may be indifferent to the rain  and sleet beating against the windows, for she can spend the time  writing to her friends long and enthusiastic descriptions of her  happiness; but what can the unlucky bridegroom do? He subscribes to the  circulating library, reads a series of novels aloud to his wife, and  illustrates every amatory passage with a kiss. But the \"dear old boy\"  (as the bride calls him) tires of this sort of thing after a week, and  how can he then amuse himself? He stares out of windows, he watches the  arrival of the milkman and the butcher with the liveliest interest; he  envies the coastguardsman, who is perpetually on the look-out for  invisible smugglers through a portentously long telescope. Cases have  been known where the bridegroom--a City man--being driven to  desperation, has privately ordered the office journal and ledger to be  sent down by luggage train, and has devoted his evenings to checking the  additions in those interesting volumes.    When Hodge and his sweetheart crown their pastoral loves in the quiet  old country church, they take a pleasant drive or a walk in their  finery, and settle down at once to connubial comfort in the cot beside  the wood. Why do their richer neighbours deny themselves this happiness  and invent special troubles? Why, during the early weeks of married  life, do they lay up sad memories of provoking mistakes, of trunks which  will not pack, of trains which will not wait, of tiresome sight-seeing,  of broiling sun, of headache, of \"the fretful stir unprofitable, and the  fever\" of honeymooning abroad? Many a bridegroom but just returned from  a \"delightful tour on the Continent\" will be able to sympathize in the  remark of the country farmer to a companion in the train, as he went to  town to buy hay. \"Yes, it's been a bad winter for some folk. Old  Smith's dead, and so is Jones, and my wife died yesterday. And how be  the hay, master?\"    We do not want excitement during the honeymoon, for are we not in love  (if we are not we ought to be ashamed of ourselves), and is not love  all-sufficient? Last week we only saw the object of our affections by  fits and starts as it were; now we have her or him all to ourselves.      \"Who hath not felt that breath in the air,    A perfume and freshness strange and rare,    A warmth in the light, and a bliss everywhere,      When young hearts yearn together?    All sweets below, and all sunny above,    Oh! there's nothing in life like making love,      Save making hay in fine weather.\"    Let cynics say what they will, the honeymoon, when not greatly  mismanaged, _is_ a halcyon period. It is a delightful lull between two  distinct states of existence, and the married man is not to be envied  who can recall no pleasant reminiscences of it. What profane outsiders  consider very dull has a charm of its own to honeymoon lovers who  \"illumine life with dreaming,\" and who see--      \"Golden visions wave and hover,    Golden vapours, waters streaming,    Landscapes moving, changing, gleaming!\"    Still, we cannot but think that if a wedding tour must be taken it  should be short, quiet, free-and-easy, and inexpensive. At some future  time, when the young people are less agitated and have learned to  understand each other better, the time and money saved will be  available for a more extended holiday. During the honeymoon there should  be \"marches hymeneal in the land of the ideal\" rather than  globe-trotting; \"thoughts moved o'er fields Elysian\" rather than over  the perplexing pages of \"Bradshaw's General Railway and Steam Navigation  Guide.\"    In reference to the honeymoon, as to other matters, people's opinions  differ according to their temperaments and circumstances. So we shall  conclude this chapter by quoting two nearly opposite opinions, and ask  our readers to decide for themselves.    In the \"Memoir of Daniel Macmillan\" his opinion is thus stated: \"That  going out for the honeymoon is a most wise and useful invention; it  enables you to be so constantly together, and to obtain a deeper  knowledge of each other; and it also helps one to see and feel the  preciousness of such intimacy as nothing else could. Intercourse in the  presence of others never leads below the surface, and it is in the very  depths of our being that true calm, deep and true peace and love lie.  Nothing so well prepares for the serious duties of after-life.\"    \"As to long honeymoons,\" says the Bishop of Rochester, \"most sensible  people have come utterly to disbelieve in them. They are a forced homage  to utterly false ideas; they are a waste of money at a moment when every  shilling is wanted for much more pressing objects; they are a loss of  time, which soon comes to be dreary and weary. Most of all, they are a  risk for love, which ought not so soon to be so unpleasantly tested by  the inevitable petulances of a secret _ennui_. Six days by all means,  and then, oh! happy friends, go straight home.... Whenever you come  back, six weeks hence or one, you will have just as much to stand the  fire of a little hard staring which won't hurt you, and of bright  pleasantness which need not vex you; and the sooner you are at home, the  sooner you will find out what married happiness means.\"          CHAPTER X.    MARRIAGE VOWS.         \"Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou       shouldest vow and not pay.\"--_Ecclesiastes_ v. 5.      The honeymoon is over, and our young couple have exchanged their  chrysalis condition for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35545"],[0,"Sanders of the River (#14)"],[1,"cruelties, and his little wars  within the boundaries of his state. Also he sought relaxation therein.    One day, just after the rains, when the world was cool and the air  filled with the faint scent of African spring, Sanders made a tour  through the little provinces. These are those lands which lie away from  the big rivers. Countries curled up in odd corners, bisected sharply on  the map by this or that international boundary line, or scattered on the  fringe of the wild country vaguely inscribed by the chartographer as  \"Under British Influence.\"    It was always an interesting journey--Sanders made it once a year--for  the way led up strange rivers and through unfamiliar scenes, past  villages where other white men than Sanders were never seen. After a  month's travel the Commissioner came to Icheli, which lies on the border  of the great king's domain, and with immense civility he was received by  the elders and the chiefs.    \"Lord, you have come at a good moment,\" said the chief solemnly,  \"to-night Daihili dances.\"    \"And who is Daihili?\" asked Sanders.    They told him; later they brought for his inspection a self-conscious  girl, a trifle pert, he thought, for a native.    A slim girl, taller than the average woman, with a figure perfectly  modelled, a face not unpleasant even from the European standpoint,  graceful in carriage, her every movement harmonious. Sanders, chewing  the end of his cigar, took her in at one glance.    \"My girl, they tell me that you dance,\" he said.    \"That is so, master,\" she said; \"I am the greatest dancer in all the  world.\"    \"So far I cannot go,\" said the cautious Commissioner; \"but I do not  doubt that your dancing is very wonderful.\"    \"Lord,\" she said, with a gesture, \"when I dance men go mad, losing their  senses. To-night when the moon is high I will show you the dance of the  Three Lovers.\"    \"To-night,\" said Sanders briefly, \"I shall be in bed--and, I trust,  asleep.\"    The girl frowned a little, was possibly piqued, being a woman of  fifteen, and in no wise different to women elsewhere in the world. This  Sanders did not know, and I doubt whether the knowledge would have  helped him much if he did.    He heard the tom-tom beating, that night as he lay in bed, and the  rhythmical clapping of hands, and fell asleep wondering what would be  the end of a girl who danced so that men went mad.    The child was the chief's daughter, and at parting Sanders had a few  words to say concerning her.    \"This daughter of yours is fifteen, and it would be better if she were  married,\" he said.    \"Lord, she has many lovers, but none rich enough to buy her,\" said the  proud father, \"because she is so great a dancer. Chiefs and headmen from  villages far distant come to see her.\" He looked round and lowered his  voice. \"It is said,\" he whispered, \"that the Great One himself has  spoken of her. Perhaps he will send for her, offering this and that. In  such a case,\" said the chief hopefully, \"I will barter and bargain,  keeping him in suspense, and every day the price will rise----\"    \"If the Great One need her, let her go,\" said Sanders, \"lest instead of  money presents he sends an army. I will have no war, or women palaver,  which is worse than war, in my country--mark that, chief.\"    \"Lord, your word is my desire,\" said the chief conventionally.    Sanders went back to his own people by easy stages. At Isisi he was  detained for over a week over a question of witch-craft; at Belembi (in  the Isisi country) he stopped three days to settle a case of murder by  fetish. He was delivering judgment, and Abiboo, the Sergeant of Police,  was selecting and testing his stoutest cane for the whipping which was  to follow, when the chief of the Icheli came flying down the river with  three canoes, and Sanders, who, from where he sat, commanded an  uninterrupted view of the river, knew there was trouble--and guessed  what that trouble was.    \"Justice!\" demanded the chief, his voice trembling with the rage and  fear he had nursed, \"justice against the Old One, the stealer of girls,  the destroyer of cities--may death go to him. Iwa!----\"    The very day Sanders had left, the messenger of the great king had come,  and with him a hundred warriors, demanding the dancing girl. True to his  pre-arranged scheme, the chief began the inevitable bargaining over  terms. The presents offered were too small. The girl was worth a hundred  thousand rods--nay, a thousand bags of salt.    \"You were mad,\" said Sanders calmly; \"no woman is worth a thousand bags  of salt.\"    \"Well, that might be,\" admitted the outraged father; \"yet it would be  folly to begin by naming a price too low. The bargaining went on  through the night and all the next day, and in the end the envoy of the  great king grew impatient.    \"Let the woman be sent for,\" he said, and obedient to the summons came  Daihili, demure enough, yet with covert glances of encouragement to the  unemotional ambassador, and with subtle exhibitions of her charms.    \"Woman,\" said the messenger, \"the greatest of kings desires you, will  you come?\"    \"Lord,\" said the girl, \"I wish for nothing better.\"    With that, the hundred armed warriors in attendance at the palaver  closed round the girl.    \"And so,\" said Sanders, \"you got nothing?\"    \"Lord, it is as you say,\" moaned the old chief.    \"It is evident,\" said Sanders, \"that an injustice has been done; for no  man may take a woman unless he pay. I think,\" he added, with a flash of  that mordant humour which occasionally illuminated his judgments, \"that  the man pays twice, once to the father, and all his life to his  wife--but that is as may be.\"    Six weeks later, after consultation, Sanders sent a messenger to the  great king, demanding the price of the woman.    What happened to the messenger I would rather not describe. That he was  killed, is saying the least. Just before he died, when the glaze of  death must have been on his eyes, and his poor wrecked body settling to  the rest of oblivion, he was carried to a place before the king's hut,  and Daihili danced the Dance of the Spirits. This much is now known.    Sanders did nothing; nor did the British Government, but hurried notes  were exchanged between ambassadors and ministers in Paris, and that was  the end of the incident.    Two Icheli spies went up into the great king's country. One came back  saying that the dancing girl was the favourite wife of the old king, and  that her whims swayed the destinies of the nation. Also he reported that  because of this slim girl who danced, many men, councillors, and  captains of war had died the death.    The other spy did not come back.    It may have been his discovery that induced the girl to send an army  against the Icheli, thinking perchance that her people were spying upon  her.    One day the city of Icheli was surrounded by the soldiers of the great  king, and neither man, woman nor child escaped.    The news of the massacre did not come to Sanders for a long time. The  reason was simple there was none to carry the message, for the Icheli  are isolated folk. One day, however, an Isisi hunting party, searching  for elephants, came upon a place where there was a smell of burning and  many skeletons--and thus Sanders knew----    \"We cannot,\" wrote Monsieur Leon Marchassa, Minister for Colonial  Affairs, \"accept responsibility for the misdoings of the king of the  Yitingi, and my Government would regard with sympathetic interest any  attempt that was made by His Majesty's Government to pacify this  country.\"    But the British Government did nothing, because war is an expensive  matter, and Sanders grinned and cursed his employers genially.    Taking his life in his hands, he went up to the border of Yitingi, with  twenty policemen, and sent a messenger--a Yitingi messenger--to the  king. With the audacity which was not the least of his assets, he  demanded that the king should come to him for a palaver.    This adventure nearly proved abortive at the beginning, for just as the  _Zaire_ was steaming to the borders Sanders unexpectedly came upon  traces of a raiding expedition. There were unmistakable signs as to the  author.    \"I have a mind to turn back and punish that cursed Bosambo, Chief of the  Ochori,\" he said to Sergeant Abiboo, \"for having sworn by a variety of  gods and devils that he would keep the peace; behold he has been raiding  in foreign territory.\"    \"He will keep, master,\" said Abiboo, \"besides which, he is in the  neighbourhood, for his fires are still warm.\"    So Sanders went on, and sent his message to the king.    He kept steam in his little boat--he had chosen the only place where the  river touches the Yitingi border--and waited, quite prepared to make an  ignominious, if judicious, bolt.    To his astonishment, his spies brought word that the king was coming. He  owed this condescension to the influence of the little dancing girl, for  she, woman-like, had a memory for rebuffs, and had a score to settle  with Mr. Commissioner Sanders.    The great king arrived, and across the meadow-like lands that fringe the  river on both sides Sanders watched the winding procession with mingled  feelings. The king halted a hundred yards from the river, and his big  scarlet umbrella was the centre of a black line of soldiers spreading  out on either hand for three hundred yards.    Then a party detached itself and came towards the dead tree by the water  side, whereon hung limply in the still air the ensign of England.    \"This,\" said Sanders to himself, \"is where I go dead one time.\"    It is evidence of the seriousness of the situation, as it appealed to  him, that he permitted himself to descend to Coast English.    \"The king, the Great One, awaits you, white man, offering you safety in  his shadow,\" said the king's messenger; and Sanders nodded. He walked  leisurely toward the massed troops, and presently appeared before the  old man squatting on a heap of skins"]]]
