Colonel Wood did not understand Kaffir, but Dick, who was standing by,  said--    \"He says, sir, that there is a great Zulu army marching below.\"    Colonel Wood mounted a fresh horse, and making his way with great  difficulty across some broken ground reached a point where he could see  the plain.  There, in five continuous columns, the Zulu army from  Ulundi, 20,000 strong, was sweeping along at its usual rapid pace.  It  was evident at once that only by a speedy retreat could any of the force  hope to escape.  Colonel Wood despatched a message at once to Colonel  Russell, who had with his force by this time commenced the ascent at the  extreme westerly point, to retrace his steps instantly, and to cover as  far as possible the retreat of the native allies with the cattle.    Colonel Buller above had also seen the coming danger.  So far he had  accomplished his work admirably.  The Zulu position had been  triumphantly stormed, and a large number of cattle taken and driven off.    Had Colonel Wood's force and Wetherby's troop arrived on the scene of  action immediately after Buller had ascended to the plateau, the retreat  could have been made in time, and the expedition would have been  successful at all points.  The unfortunate incident of their losing the  track, the delay caused thereby, and their inability to rejoin him had  given time for the Ulundi army to come up.    Colonel Buller found that it was impossible now to descend to the plain  by the path by which he had ascended.  Not only would he have to fight  his way back through the whole force of Umbelleni, but his retreat by  that route would be cut off by the Ulundi men.  Consequently, pursued by  a great body of exulting Zulus, he made his way along the plateau to the  steep path at its extremity.    The scene here was terrible.  The Zulus blocked the way in front and  lined both sides.  Buller himself, with Piet-Uys, defended the rear,  assisting the wounded, and often charging desperately into the ranks of  the Zulus pressing upon him.  The path was slippery with blood and  strewn with dead.  As the last of his troop made their way down it,  Piet-Uys, a most gallant Dutchman, fell dead across the body of his  horse, with six Zulus, whom he had shot with his revolver, around him.    Wetherby's troop was surrounded, and forty-five out of his eighty men  killed.  The colonel himself and his boy both fell, the latter refusing  to leave his father, although the latter urged him to gallop off and  join the column, which appeared to be making its way through the Zulus.  Colonel Russell's command got through without so much opposition; but  Buller's horse, Piet-Uys' troop, and Wetherby's command suffered  terribly.    Fortunately the Ulundi army did not follow the retreat; first, because  the tremendous three days' march which they had made had in a great  measure exhausted the men, who had started in such haste that they had  brought no provisions with them, and secondly, on account of the steady  attitude and resolute bearing of Russell's command.    Buller's force reached Kambula camp at half-past seven at night.  It had  set in stormy, and torrents of rain were falling.  Although he had been  in the saddle for forty-eight hours, Colonel Buller, on hearing that a  small party of the survivors had taken refuge in hiding ten miles away,  collected a party of volunteers, and, taking led horses, set out to  rescue them.  This was effected; the fugitives were found to be seven in  number, and returned with their rescuers safely to camp.    The boys had both escaped, two of Wetherby's men, who accompanied  Colonel Wood, taking them on their saddles behind them.  The total loss  was ten officers and seventy-eight men.    For the night the boys were handed over to the charge of one of the  officers of the staff, but in the morning Colonel Wood sent for them,  and they then told him the story of their adventures since the battle of  Isandula, with which he was greatly interested.  He said that he would  at once have sent them to Utrecht, but that the camp would probably be  attacked during the day.    The troops had been on the alert all night, expecting an attack.  Before  daylight Captain Raaff was sent out with twenty-five men to reconnoitre,  and returned with one of Oham's natives.  This man had joined the Zulu  army as it advanced, and was, fortunately for himself, not recognised by  them as being one of Oham's people.  In the night he had slipped away.  He reported the Zulus 20,000 strong, a great portion of them being armed  with rifles.    Fortunately little preparation was necessary at Kambula.  Nothing had  been left to chance here, and there was therefore no fear of a  repetition of the Isandula disaster.  Each corps, each subdivision, each  section, and each man had his place allotted to him, and had been told  to be in that place at the sound of the bugle.    The little fort was in a strong position, laid out upon an elevated  narrow reach of table-land.  A precipice, inaccessible to a white man,  guarded the right flank; on the left a succession of steep terraces had  been utilised and carefully intrenched, each successive line commanding  that below it.  At one end there was a narrow slip of land swept by two  7-pounders.  Immediately in the rear, upon an eminence 120 feet higher  than the fort, was a small work, armed with two guns.  The camp  consisted of an outer defence of 100 waggons, and an inner one of  fifty--the whole protected by earthworks and ditches.    CHAPTER SEVEN.    KAMBULA.    Immediately Oham's Zulu had made his report, the bugle sounded, and the  garrison quietly and quickly took up the places assigned to them.  Messengers went out to order a fatigue-party, which had gone out  wood-cutting, to return at once.  These men reported that they had seen  the Zulus scouting, about five miles to the west.  The tents were  struck, the men lined the shelter-trenches, and ammunition was served  out by fatigue-parties told off for this duty.  The white conductors and  commissariat men, most of whom were old settlers and good shots, were  told off to the different faces of the laager.  A small party were  provided with stretchers, in order to carry the wounded to the hospital  in the centre.    Dick and Tom, having no duty and being without arms, thought that they  might as well make themselves useful at this work, and therefore, taking  a stretcher, they proceeded to one of the outer shelter-trenches.    It was nearly eleven o'clock when the Zulus were seen approaching, and  halted just out of musket-range.  Here apparently a council of war was  held, and it was more than an hour before any forward movement was made.  Then a body of them, about 7000 strong, ran at a tremendous pace along  a ledge situated at the edge of the cultivated land.  The troops were  ordered not to fire, as it was thought better to wait until the Zulus  came on in earnest.  At half-past one a cloud of skirmishers advanced  from the Zulu army, and fed by supports began to scale the north front  of the English position.  Here, behind the outermost line of  intrenchments, some of Buller and Russell's dismounted men, and a  portion of the band of the gallant Piet-Uys were stationed, and these  opened fire upon the Zulus.  Scarcely one of them but was a dead-shot,  and no sooner did a head or a shield appear above rock or boulder or  tuft of grass than the deadly rifle rang out, and in most cases there  was an enemy the less to encounter.    The Boers particularly distinguished themselves at this work.  Most of  these men are certain shots, being trained from childhood in the use of  their large single-barrelled guns, carrying an enormous bullet, and  suited for the destruction of big game.  Animated by a hatred of the  Zulus, and a longing for vengeance for the death of their late leader,  the Boers picked off their foes with unerring aim.  The enemy's  skirmishers now retired, and a more solid line took their place,  supported by a dense column in its rear.  The cavalry remounted and fell  slowly back, and Major Russell, with twenty of his men, made a brilliant  charge on a party of Zulus who were running to take possession of a  sheltering ledge of rocks, and, after cutting down a great many,  retreated without the loss of a man.    Buller and Russell now retired slowly within the laager, their retreat  being covered by Colonel Gilbert and four companies of the 13th, who  were posted at this face of the works.  One company of the 13th, under  Captain Cox, held the cattle-laager, which was situated outside the  line, and so were able to take the enemy in flank, as they attacked the  main work.  This little garrison and Colonel Gilbert's men poured a  tremendous fire upon the Zulus, who still, however, pushed forward.    Major Hackett was now ordered to take a couple of companies of the 90th,  and to advance up the slope, round the rear of the cattle-laager.  Taking post here, they opened a deliberate and deadly fire upon the  enemy, and then advancing drove back the Zulus with great loss.  The  Zulu general, however, led a party of his best marksmen round to his  right, and opened a heavy fire upon the 90th, as they fell back upon  their intrenchments.  Lieutenant Bright fell mortally wounded, and in  running forward to pick him up Major Hackett was struck by a ball  sideways, which passed through both eyes and destroyed his sight for  ever.  Meanwhile, from the works on the heights, Captain Nicholson was  doing great execution with his two 7-pounders.  The Zulu main body had  now come within range, and grape and canister were poured into their  heavy masses.  As Nicholson was standing on the parapet, field-glass in  hand, directing the pointing of two guns, a bullet struck him on the  temple and he fell dead.  He was seen from the laager to fall,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32947"],[0,"On Snake-Poison: Its Action and Its Antidote (#14)"],[1,"on these occasions were evidently not Banerjees, but the  very reverse of their Indian confrere. They do not appear to have had  very clear ideas of the absolute antagonism existing between the two  poisons, and entirely disregarded the most important point in the  treatment, namely, the necessity of administering the antidote until it  has completely subdued the snake poison, regardless of the quantity that  may be required for that purpose. In a few instances the treatment was  correct enough at first, but when, as is often the case, a relapse took  place after the patient had apparently recovered, the large quantity of  the antidote already administered appears to have given rise to the  erroneous notion that it would be useless to resort to it a second time,  and thus, through this error and the fear of strychnine-convulsions, the  patients were allowed to die. In most of the six fatal cases collected  by the writer, however, the doses and total quantities given were  altogether inadequate to cope with the poison. They did probably more  harm than good, for the snake-poison when only partially checked by  strychnine seems to renew its onslaught on the nerve-cells even more  insidiously than when not interfered with at all. Convulsions also, as  shown in cases, are sometimes called forth by this timid use of the  antidote.    A few instances will show the correctness of these observations. Thus an  old woman sleeping in a shed is awakened at daylight by a tiger snake  having fastened on to her wrist. She pulls off the snake, alarms the  neighbours, and a doctor, living only a mile away from the place, is  sent for. He appears on the scene four hours afterwards, when complete  coma and collapse has set in, makes two injections of gr. 1/15 each,  which of course had no effect and the patient is allowed to die without  any further effort on the part of her medical attendant. Case 2.--A boy  of 10 years is admitted to a N. S. Wales hospital in a state of complete  collapse, barely alive, having been bitten by a brown snake 22 hours  before admission. Instead of a rousing injection of at least 15 minims  and the same or smaller ones repeated at short intervals, he receives  only 5 minims of liq. strychniae P.B. every twenty minutes, when death  was imminent, and dies 65 minutes after admission. Case 3 is also that  of a boy in an hospital. He is admitted fully conscious and apparently  but slightly under the influence of snake-poison, for a five minims  injection is reported to have removed the symptoms. On the following  day, however, he became comatose, and instead of having the antidote  freely administered, gets only one more injection of five minims and  dies in coma. Case 4 is even worse. A little girl of 3 years, bitten by  a tiger snake, receives three minim injections every half-hour, and  after three of them, whilst in a state of complete coma, gets  convulsions. These are attributed to the strychnine, which thereupon is  withheld, the finale being death in coma.    There can be no doubt that in all these cases life could have been  preserved under a more energetic treatment. Hereafter, when theory and  treatment are better understood, and when officialdom has seen fit to  issue instructions as to the proper treatment of snakebite to medical  practitioners, such cases as those cited will be put down as malpractice  and have to be accounted for. Until then the guardians of the health and  the lives of her Majesty's subjects, and a certain portion of the  medical press of Australia, superciliously and persistently ignoring the  subject, are more responsible for the lives lost than the busy country  practitioner, who may not have had time or opportunity to inform himself  thoroughly on a comparatively new subject, more especially at a period  when Banerjee had not yet taught us that in administering strychnine as  antidote to snake-poison we can venture into grains of it with impunity.           *       *       *       *       *    Since the above chapters were put in proof, the writer has seen a fatal  case of tiger snake bite, conveying two lessons of such interest and  importance that it must be placed on record here. It illustrates in an  extraordinary and forcible degree the erratic, capricious, and insidious  course the snake-poison takes at times.           *       *       *       *       *    A handsome girl of 17 is bitten in a bathroom on the back of the second  right toe at dusk on a Sunday evening by a half-grown tiger snake,  subsequently caught and killed in the room. She does not suspect  snakebite, and no ligature is applied until the poison has been  absorbed and overpowers her. Instead of sinking into coma, she becomes  unconscious for a short time only. Her brain then clears itself, and all  symptoms seem to disappear so completely that when a medical man of  undoubted ability and skill sees her a few hours after the bite, she  declares herself quite well again, and does not appear to require any  treatment, least of all that by strychnine injections. She passes a good  night, but on Monday morning symptoms denoting paresis of the  respiratory and glosso-pharyngeal centres make their appearance, almost  identical with those described by Indian writers as following  cobra-bite. She has difficulty in breathing and swallowing, but one  injection of 1/10th of a grain removes it completely and speedily, and  once more all danger is thought to be past. On Monday evening, however,  dyspnoea and dysphagia appear again in an aggravated form. The urine  also becomes scanty and loaded with albuminates. Strychnine now is again  resorted to, but it fails to act as before, and from hour to hour the  young lady's condition becomes more critical. When the writer reached  her on Tuesday afternoon, 42 hours after the bite, paralysis of the  centres named was imminent, and her case appeared a hopeless one, unless  a vigorous use of strychnine yet turned the scales in her favour.  One-tenth grain doses were therefore injected every half-hour, and  continued until the physiological action of the drug showed itself. This  took place, but failed to have the least effect on the affected  centres; and complete paralysis ensued 45 hours after the infliction of  the fatal bite.    The first lesson the Australian practitioner should learn from this sad  case is that of extreme care and caution in dealing with any case of  snakebite, no matter how slight it may appear at first sight. It is not  for the first time we have been taught this lesson, though it has  rarely, if ever, been conveyed in so singular a manner. Recent  utterances about the innocuousness of Australian snake-poison find a  fitting answer in this melancholy occurrence.    The second lesson it conveys is a new one, even to the writer. From the  fact of one strychnine injection removing all poison-symptoms early on  Monday, but the free use of the antidote failing entirely to have this  effect on Monday night and on Tuesday, we are warranted to draw the  conclusion that the antidote can only be relied on within the first 24  hours after the bite; and that, after this period, the snake-poison  produces organic changes in the affected nerve-cells, preventing their  depressed functional activity from being restored by the antidote.  Further observations, of course, are required to confirm these  conclusions. Their correctness, however, appears to be borne out by the  fact observed by the writer, that the larger domestic animals, who  sometimes linger on for days after being bitten by a snake, usually  recover under the strychnine treatment if it is applied immediately or  soon after a bite, but die when found and treated in an advanced stage  of the malady.    That the grave kidney complication, checking the elimination of the  poison from the system, militated against recovery in this case, and  greatly influenced the singular course of the poisoning process, cannot  be doubted.    [Illustration]          CONCLUSION.      In the little work submitted herewith to the medical profession and the  general public, for both of whom it is intended, the author may justly  claim to have solved the difficult and long-standing problem of  snake-poison. We have at last a correct theory of its action, and, what  is of more importance to the public, we have an effective antidote.  These facts, being as fully established in these pages as any scientific  facts can be, the most exacting and even captious criticism will not  upset, nor can further research add anything very material to the  writer's deductions and their final result.    In order to show how an obscure Australian country practitioner  succeeded in a discovery, for which all his predecessors in this field  of research had laboured in vain, it will be necessary in conclusion to  give a short history of the discovery as by slow degrees it has  originated and matured in the writer's mind, who during the last 35  years with respect to this subject had followed the advice which  Schiller gives in his grand poem, \"Die Glocke:\"--        Wer etwas Treffliches leisten will,      Haett' gern was Grossesgeboren,      Der sammle still und unerschlafft      Im kleinsten Punkte die groesste Kraft,    which, translated into English, means that whoever aims at any great  achievement must quietly, but indefatigably, concentrate the highest  force on the smallest point. Now this smallest point has to the writer  been snake-poison from the very commencement of his Australian career.  When yet a new-chum, a vigorous tiger snake gave him the first lesson on  the action of the insidious venom which nearly cost him his life, but  afforded some valuable glimpses into the mystery of snakebite--in fact,  gave him the key to unlock that mystery. On analysing the horrid  sensations he had experienced before he lost consciousness, and even  after regaining it, he saw \"depressed nerve-action, emanating from the  central"]]]
