There are  persons who can sit a horse gracefully and well, but who have not the  instinctive gift of hand. The horse is aware of this almost as soon as  the rider has been seated in the saddle. In that case, whether the horse  be first-class or not, there will be no comfort for the animal, and no  ease for the rider.    If such a person puts his horse at a fence, the animal will not be  thoroughly convinced that his rider wishes him to take it. There are  more accidents occasioned by a \"bad hand\" than by any other cause. If  this is the case with a horse well bitted, what must be the result  should an elephant be guided by a mahout of uncertain temperament? The  great trouble when travelling on an elephant is the difficulty in  getting the mahout to obey an order immediately, and at the same time to  convey that order to the animal without the slightest hesitation.  Natives frequently hesitate before they determine the right from left.  This is exasperating to the highest degree, and is destructive to the  discipline of an elephant. There must be no uncertainty; if there is the  slightest vacillation, it will be felt instinctively in the muscles of  the rider, and the animal, instead of obeying mechanically the requisite  pressure of knee or foot, feels that the mahout does not exactly know  what he is about. This will cause the elephant to swing his head,  instead of keeping steady and obeying the order without delay. In the  same manner, when tiger-shooting, the elephant will at once detect  anything like tremor on the part of his mahout. Frequently a good  elephant may be disgraced by the nervousness of his guide, nothing being  so contagious as fear.    Although I may be an exception in the non-admiration of the elephant's  sagacity to the degree in which it is usually accepted, there is no one  who more admires or is so foolishly fond of elephants. I have killed  some hundreds in my early life, but I have learnt to regret the past,  and 1 nothing would now induce me to shoot an elephant unless it were  either a notorious malefactor, or in self-defence. There is, however, a  peculiar contradiction in the character of elephants that tends to  increase the interest in the animal. If they were all the same, there  would be a monotony; but this is never the case, either among animals or  human beings, although they may belong to one family. The elephant, on  the other hand, stands so entirely apart from all other animals, and its  performances appear so extraordinary owing to the enormous effect which  its great strength produces instantaneously, that its peculiarities  interest mankind more than any smaller animal. Yet, when we consider the  actual aptitude for learning, or the natural habits of the creature, we  are obliged to confess that in proportion to its size the elephant is a  mere fool in comparison with the intelligence of many insects. If the  elephant could form a home like the bee, and store up fodder for a  barren season; if it could build a nest of comfort like a bird, to  shelter itself from inclement weather; if it could dam up a river like  the beaver, to store water for the annual drought; if it could only,  like the ordinary squirrel or field mouse, make a store for a season of  scarcity, how marvellous we should think this creature, simply because  it is so huge! It actually does nothing remarkable, unless specially  instructed; but it is this inertia that renders it so valuable to man.  If the elephant were to be continually exerting its natural  intelligence, and volunteering all manner of gigantic performances in  the hope that they would be appreciated by its rider, it would be  unbearable; the value of the animal consists in its capacity to learn,  and in its passive demeanour, until directed by the mahout's commands.    Nothing can positively determine the character of any elephant; every  animal, I believe, varies more or less in courage according to its state  of health, which must influence the nervous system. The most courageous  man may, if weakened by sickness, be disgusted with himself by starting  at an unexpected sound, although upon ordinary occasions he would not be  affected. Animals cannot describe their feelings, and they may sometimes  feel \"out of sorts\" without being actually ill, but the nervous system  may be unstrung.    I once saw a ridiculous example of sudden panic in an otherwise most  dependable elephant. This was a large male belonging to the Government,  which had been lent to me for a few months, and was thoroughly staunch  when opposed to a charging tiger; in fact, I believe that Moolah Bux was  afraid of nothing, and he was the best shikar elephant I have ever  ridden. One day we were driving a rocky hill for a tiger that was  supposed to be concealed somewhere among the high grass and broken  boulders, and, as the line of beaters was advancing, I backed the  elephant into some thick jungle, which commanded an open but narrow  glade at the foot of the low hill. Only the face of the elephant was  exposed, and as this was grayish brown, something similar to the colour  of the leafless bushes, we were hardly noticeable to anything that might  break covert.    The elephant thoroughly understood the work in hand; and as the loud  yells and shouts of the beaters became nearer, Moolah Bux pricked his  ears and kept a vigilant look-out. Suddenly a hare emerged about 100  yards distant; without observing our well-concealed position it raced at  full speed directly towards us, and in a few seconds it ran almost  between the elephant's legs as it made for the protection of the jungle.  The mighty Moolah Bux fairly bolted with a sudden terror as this  harmless and tiny creature dashed beneath him, and although he recovered  himself after 5 or 6 yards, nevertheless for the moment the monster was  scared almost by a mouse.    It is this uncertainty of character that has rendered the elephant  useless for military purposes in the field since the introduction of  fire-arms. In olden times there can be no doubt that a grand array of  elephantine cavalry, with towers containing archers on their backs,  would have been an important factor when in line of battle; but  elephants are useless against fire-arms, and in our early battles with  the great hordes brought against us by the princes of India, their  elephants invariably turned tail, and added materially to the defeat of  their army.    Only a short time ago, at Munich, a serious accident was occasioned by a  display of ten or twelve elephants during some provincial fete, when  they took fright at the figure of a dragon vomiting fire, and a general  stampede was the consequence, resulting in serious injuries to fifteen  or sixteen persons.    I once had an elephant who ought to have killed me upon several  occasions through sheer panic, which induced him to run away like a  railway locomotive rushing through a forest. This was the tusker Lord  Mayo, who, although a good-tempered harmless creature, appeared to be  utterly devoid of nerves, and would take fright at anything to which it  was unaccustomed. The sound of the beaters when yelling and shouting in  driving jungle was quite sufficient to start this animal off in a  senseless panic, not always for a short distance, as on one occasion it  ran at full speed for upwards of a mile through a dense forest, in spite  of the driving-hook of the mahout, which had been applied with a maximum  severity.    It is curious to observe how all the education of an elephant appears to  vanish when once the animal takes fright and bolts for the nearest  jungle. That seems to be the one idea which is an instinct of original  nature, to retreat into the concealment of a forest.    I was on one occasion mounted upon Lord Mayo in the Balagh district when  the beaters were not dependable. A tiger had killed a bullock at the  foot of a wooded hill bordered by an open plain. As the beaters had  misbehaved upon several occasions by breaking their line, I determined  to take command of the beat in person. I therefore formed the line in  the open, with every man equidistant, there being about a hundred and  twenty villagers. I had placed my shikari with a rifle in a convenient  position about 200 yards in advance, upon a mucharn or platform that had  been constructed for myself.    Having after some trouble arranged the beaters in a proper line, I gave  the order for an advance. In an instant the shouts arose, and three or  four tom-toms added to the din.    I was mounted upon Lord Mayo near the centre of the line in the open  glade. No sooner had the noise begun, than a violent panic seized this  senseless brute, and without the slightest warning it rushed straight  ahead for the thick forest at a pace that would nearly equal that of a  luggage train. It was in vain that the mahout dug the iron spike into  its head and alternately seized its ears by the unsparing hook, away it  ran, regardless of all punishment or persuasion, until it reached the  jungle, and with a crash we entered in full career!    Fortunately there was no howdah, only a pad well secured by thick ropes.  To clutch these tightly, and to dodge the opposing branches by ducking  the head, now swinging to the right, then doubling down upon the left to  allow the bending trees to sweep across the pad, then flinging oneself  nearly over the flank to escape a bough that threatened instant  extermination; all these gymnastics were performed and repeated in a few  seconds only, as the panic-stricken brute ploughed its way, regardless  of all obstructions, which threatened every instant to sweep us off its  back. The active mahout of my other elephant, knowing the character of  Lord Mayo, had luckily accompanied us with a spear, and although at the  time I was unaware of his presence, he was exerting himself to the  utmost in a vain endeavour to overtake our runaway elephant. At first I  imagined that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3668"],[0,"The Albert N'Yanza, Great Basin of the Nile, And Explorations of the Nile (#14)"],[1,"set of savages that can be imagined; so emaciated, that they have no  visible posteriors; they look as though they had been planed off, and  their long thin legs and arms give them a peculiar gnat-like appearance.  At night they crouch close to the fires, lying in the smoke to escape  the clouds of mosquitoes. At this season the country is a vast swamp,  the only dry spots being the white ant-hills; in such places the natives  herd like wild animals, simply rubbing themselves with wood-ashes to  keep out the cold.    Jan. 20th.--The river from this spot turns sharp to the east, but an  arm equally broad comes from S. 20 degrees E. to this point. There is no  stream from this arm. The main stream runs round the angle with a rapid  current of about two and a half miles per hour. The natives say that  this arm of dead water extends for three or four days' sailing, and is  then lost in the high reeds. My reis Diabb declares this to be a mere  backwater, and that it is not connected with the main river by any  positive channel.    So miserable are the natives of the Kytch tribe, that they devour both  skins and bones of all dead animals; the bones are pounded between  stones, and when reduced to powder they are boiled to a kind of  porridge; nothing is left even for a fly to feed upon, when an animal  either dies a natural death, or is killed. I never pitied poor creatures  more than these utterly destitute savages; their method of returning  thanks is by holding your hand and affecting to spit upon it; which  operation they do not actually perform, as I have seen stated in works  upon the White Nile. Their domestic arrangements are peculiar. Polygamy  is of course allowed, as in all other hot climates and savage countries;  but when a man becomes too old to pay sufficient attention to his  numerous young wives, the eldest son takes the place of his father and  becomes his substitute. To every herd of cattle there is a sacred bull,  which is supposed to exert an influence over the prosperity of the  flocks; his horns are ornamented with tufts of feathers, and frequently  with small bells, and he invariably leads the great herd to pasture. On  starting in the early morning from the cattle kraal the natives address  the bull, telling him \"to watch over the herd; to keep the cows from  straying; and to lead them to the sweetest pastures, so that they shall  give abundance of milk,\" &c.    Jan. 21st.--Last night a sudden squall carried away Koorshid Aga's  mast by the deck, leaving him a complete wreck. The weather to-day is  dull, oppressive, and dead calm. As usual, endless marshes, and  mosquitoes. I never either saw or heard of so disgusting a country as  that bordering the White Nile from Khartoum to this point. Course S.E.  as nearly as I can judge, but the endless windings, and the absence of  any mark as a point, make it difficult to give an accurate course--the  river about a hundred yards in width of clear water; alive with floating  vegetation, with a current of about two miles per hour.    Jan. 22d.--The luxuries of the country as usual--malaria, marshes,  mosquitoes, misery; far as the eye can reach, vast treeless marshes  perfectly lifeless. At times progressing slowly by towing, the men  struggling through the water with the rope; at other times by running  round the boat in a circle, pulling with their hands at the grass, which  thus acts like the cogs of a wheel to move us gradually forward. One of  my horses, \"Filfil,\" out of pure amusement kicks at the men as they  pass, and having succeeded several times in kicking them into the river,  he perseveres in the fun, I believe for lack of other employment.    Hippopotami are heard snorting in the high reeds both day and night, but  we see very few. The black women on board are daily quarrelling together  and fighting like bull-dogs; little Gaddum Her is a regular black toy  terrier, rather old, wonderfully strong, very short, but making up in  spirit for what she lacks in stature; she is the quintessence of vice,  being ready for a stand-up fight at the shortest notice. On one occasion  she fought with her antagonist until both fell down the hold, smashing  all my water jars; on another day they both fell into the river. The  ennui of this wretched voyage appears to try the temper of both man and  beast; the horses, donkeys, and camels are constantly fighting and  biting at all around.    Jan. 23d.--At 8 a.m. arrived at Aboukooka, the establishment of a  French trader. It is impossible to describe the misery of the land; in  the midst of the vast expanse of marsh is a little plot of dry ground  about thirty-five yards square, and within thirty yards of the river,  but to be reached only by wading through the swamp. The establishment  consisted of about a dozen straw huts, occupied by a wretched  fever-stricken set of people; the vakeel, and others employed, came to  the boats to beg for corn. I stopped for ten minutes at the charming  watering-place Aboukooka to obtain the news of the country. The current  at this point is as usual very strong, being upwards of two and a half  miles per hour; the river is quite bank-full although not actually  flooding, the windings endless; one moment our course is due north, then  east, then again north, and as suddenly due south; in fact, we face  every point of the compass within an hour. Frequently the noggurs that  are far in the rear appear in advance; it is a heartbreaking river  without a single redeeming point; I do not wonder at the failure of all  expeditions in this wretched country. There is a breeze to-day, thus the  oppressive heat and stagnated marsh atmosphere is relieved. I have  always remarked that when the sky is clouded we suffer more from heat  and oppression than when the day is clear; there is a weight in the  atmosphere that would be interesting if tested by the barometer.    The water is excessively bad throughout the White Nile, especially  between the Shillook and the Kytch tribes; that of the Bahr Gazal is  even worse. The reis Diabb tells me that the north wind always fails  between the Nuehr and the upper portion of the Kytch. I could not  believe that so miserable a country existed as the whole of this land.  There is no game to be seen at this season, few birds, and not even  crocodiles show themselves; all the water-animals are hidden in the high  grass; thus there is absolutely nothing living to be seen, but day after  day is passed in winding slowly through the labyrinth of endless marsh,  through clouds of mosquitoes.    At 4.20 a.m. arrived at the Austrian mission-station of St. Croix, and  I delivered a letter to the chief of the establishment, Herr Morlang.    Jan. 24th.--Took observations of the sun, making latitude 6 degrees  39'.    The mission-station consists of about twenty grass huts on a patch of  dry ground close to the river. The church is a small hut, but neatly  arranged. Herr Morlang acknowledged, with great feeling, that the  mission was absolutely useless among such savages; that he had worked  with much zeal for many years, but that the natives were utterly  impracticable. They were far below the brutes, as the latter show signs  of affection to those who are kind to them; while the natives, on the  contrary, are utterly obtuse to all feelings of gratitude. He described  the people as lying and deceitful to a superlative degree; the more they  receive the more they desire, but in return they will do nothing.    Twenty or thirty of these disgusting, ash-smeared, stark naked brutes,  armed with clubs of hard wood brought to a point, were lying idly about  the station. The mission having given up the White Nile as a total  failure, Herr Morlang sold the whole village and mission-station to  Koorshid Aga this morning for 3,000 piastres, 30 pounds! I purchased a  horse of the missionaries for 1,000 piastres, which I christened  \"Priest\" as coming from the mission; he is a good-looking animal, and  has been used to the gun, as the unfortunate Baron Harnier rode him  buffalo-hunting. This good sportsman was a Prussian nobleman, who with  two European attendants, had for some time amused himself by collecting  objects of natural history and shooting in this neighbourhood. Both his  Europeans succumbed to marsh fever.    The end of Baron Harnier was exceedingly tragic.  Having wounded a  buffalo, the animal charged a native attendant and threw him to the  ground; Baron Harnier was unloaded, and with great courage he attacked  the buffalo with the butt-end of his rifle to rescue the man then  beneath the animal's horns. The buffalo left the man and turned upon his  new assailant. The native, far from assisting his master, who had thus  jeopardized his life to save him, fled from the spot. The unfortunate  baron was found by the missionaries trampled and gored into an  undistinguishable mass; and the dead body of the buffalo was found at a  short distance, the animal having been mortally wounded. I went to see  the grave of this brave Prussian, who had thus sacrificed so noble a  life for so worthless an object as a cowardly native. It had been well  cared for by the kind hands of the missionaries and was protected by  thorn bushes laid around it, but I fear it will be neglected now that  the mission has fallen into unholy hands. It is a pitiable sight to  witness the self-sacrifice that many noble men have made in these  frightful countries without any good results. Near to the grave of Baron  Harnier are those of several members of the mission, who have left their  bones in this horrid land, while not one convert has been made from the  mission of St. Croix.    The river divides into two branches, about five miles above this  station, forming an island. Upon this is a fishing-station of the  natives; the native name of the spot is Pomone. The country is swampy  and scantily covered with bushes and small trees, but no actual timber.  As usual, the entire country is"]]]
