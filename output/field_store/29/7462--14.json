There are many others, not possessors  of telescopes, who would like to know how one can be acquired, and to  whom hints in this direction will be valuable. We shall therefore give  such information as we are able respecting the construction of a  telescope, and the more interesting celestial objects to which it may  be applied.    Whether the reader does or does not feel competent to undertake the  making of a telescope, it may be of interest to him to know how it is  done. First, as to the general principles involved, it is generally  known that the really vital parts of the telescope, which by their  combined action perform the office of magnifying the object looked at,  are two in number, the OBJECTIVE and the EYE-PIECE. The former brings  the rays of light which emanate from the object to the focus where the  image of the object is formed. The eye-piece enables the observer to  see this image to the best advantage.    The functions of the objective as well as those of the eye-piece may,  to a certain extent, each be performed by a single lens. Galileo and  his contemporaries made their telescopes in this way, because they knew  of no way in which two lenses could be made to do better than one. But  every one who has studied optics knows that white light passing through  a single lens is not all brought to the same focus, but that the blue  light will come to a focus nearer the objective than the red light.  There will, in fact, be a succession of images, blue, green, yellow,  and red, corresponding to the colors of the spectrum. It is impossible  to see these different images clearly at the same time, because each of  them will render all the others indistinct.    The achromatic object-glass, invented by Dollond, about 1750, obviates  this difficulty, and brings all the rays to nearly the same focus.  Nearly every one interested in the subject is aware that this  object-glass is composed of two lenses--a concave one of flint-glass  and a convex one of crown-glass, the latter being on the side towards  the object. This is the one vital part of the telescope, the  construction of which involves the greatest difficulty. Once in  possession of a perfect object-glass, the rest of the telescope is a  matter of little more than constructive skill which there is no  difficulty in commanding.    The construction of the object-glass requires two completely distinct  processes: the making of the rough glass, which is the work of the  glass-maker; and the grinding and polishing into shape, which is the  work of the optician. The ordinary glass of commerce will not answer  the purpose of the telescope at all, because it is not sufficiently  clear and homogeneous. OPTICAL GLASS, as it is called, must be made of  materials selected and purified with the greatest care, and worked in a  more elaborate manner than is necessary in any other kind of glass. In  the time of Dollond it was found scarcely possible to make good disks  of flint-glass more than three or four inches in diameter. Early in the  present century, Guinand, of Switzerland, invented a process by which  disks of much larger size could be produced. In conjunction with the  celebrated Fraunhofer he made disks of nine or ten inches in diameter,  which were employed by his colaborer in constructing the telescopes  which were so famous in their time. He was long supposed to be in  possession of some secret method of avoiding the difficulties which his  predecessors had met. It is now believed that this secret, if one it  was, consisted principally in the constant stirring of the molten glass  during the process of manufacture. However this may be, it is a curious  historical fact that the most successful makers of these great disks of  glass have either been of the family of Guinand, or successors, in the  management of the family firm. It was Feil, a son-in-law or near  relative, who made the glass from which Clark fabricated the lenses of  the great telescope of the Lick Observatory. His successor, Mantois, of  Paris, carried the art to a point of perfection never before  approached. The transparency and uniformity of his disks as well as the  great size to which he was able to carry them would suggest that he and  his successors have out-distanced all competitors in the process. He it  was who made the great 40-inch lens for the Yerkes Observatory.    As optical glass is now made, the material is constantly stirred with  an iron rod during all the time it is melting in the furnace, and after  it has begun to cool, until it becomes so stiff that the stirring has  to cease. It is then placed, pot and all, in the annealing furnace,  where it is kept nearly at a melting heat for three weeks or more,  according to the size of the pot. When the furnace has cooled off, the  glass is taken out, and the pot is broken from around it, leaving only  the central mass of glass. Having such a mass, there is no trouble in  breaking it up into pieces of all desirable purity, and sufficiently  large for moderate-sized telescopes. But when a great telescope of two  feet aperture or upward is to be constructed, very delicate and  laborious operations have to be undertaken. The outside of the glass  has first to be chipped off, because it is filled with impurities from  the material of the pot itself. But this is not all. Veins of unequal  density are always found extending through the interior of the mass, no  way of avoiding them having yet been discovered. They are supposed to  arise from the materials of the pot and stirring rod, which become  mixed in with the glass in consequence of the intense heat to which all  are subjected. These veins must, so far as possible, be ground or  chipped out with the greatest care. The glass is then melted again,  pressed into a flat disk, and once more put into the annealing oven. In  fact, the operation of annealing must be repeated every time the glass  is melted. When cooled, it is again examined for veins, of which great  numbers are sure to be found. The problem now is to remove these by  cutting and grinding without either breaking the glass in two or  cutting a hole through it. If the parts of the glass are once  separated, they can never be joined without producing a bad scar at the  point of junction. So long, however, as the surface is unbroken, the  interior parts of the glass can be changed in form to any extent.  Having ground out the veins as far as possible, the glass is to be  again melted, and moulded into proper shape. In this mould great care  must be taken to have no folding of the surface. Imagining the latter  to be a sort of skin enclosing the melted glass inside, it must be  raised up wherever the glass is thinnest, and the latter allowed to  slowly run together beneath it.    [Illustration with caption: THE GLASS DISK.]    If the disk is of flint, all the veins must be ground out on the first  or second trial, because after two or three mouldings the glass will  lose its transparency. A crown disk may, however, be melted a number of  times without serious injury. In many cases--perhaps the majority--the  artisan finds that after all his months of labor he cannot perfectly  clear his glass of the noxious veins, and he has to break it up into  smaller pieces. When he finally succeeds, the disk has the form of a  thin grindstone two feet or upward in diameter, according to the size  of the telescope to be made, and from two to three inches in thickness.  The glass is then ready for the optician.    [Illustration with caption: THE OPTICIAN'S TOOL.]    The first process to be performed by the optician is to grind the glass  into the shape of a lens with perfectly spherical surfaces. The convex  surface must be ground in a saucer-shaped tool of corresponding form.  It is impossible to make a tool perfectly spherical in the first place,  but success may be secured on the geometrical principle that two  surfaces cannot fit each other in all positions unless both are  perfectly spherical. The tool of the optician is a very simple affair,  being nothing more than a plate of iron somewhat larger, perhaps a  fourth, than the lens to be ground to the corresponding curvature. In  order to insure its changing to fit the glass, it is covered on the  interior with a coating of pitch from an eighth to a quarter of an inch  thick. This material is admirably adapted to the purpose because it  gives way certainly, though very slowly, to the pressure of the glass.  In order that it may have room to change its form, grooves are cut  through it in both directions, so as to leave it in the form of  squares, like those on a chess-board.    [Illustration with caption: THE OPTICIAN'S TOOL.]    It is then sprinkled over with rouge, moistened with water, and gently  warmed. The roughly ground lens is then placed upon it, and moved from  side to side. The direction of the motion is slightly changed with  every stroke, so that after a dozen or so of strokes the lines of  motion will lie in every direction on the tool. This change of  direction is most readily and easily effected by the operator slowly  walking around as he polishes, at the same time the lens is to be  slowly turned around either in the opposite direction or more rapidly  yet in the same direction, so that the strokes of the polisher shall  cross the lens in all directions. This double motion insures every part  of the lens coming into contact with every part of the polisher, and  moving over it in every direction.    Then whatever parts either of the lens or of the polisher may be too  high to form a spherical surface will be gradually worn down, thus  securing the perfect sphericity of both.    [Illustration with caption: GRINDING A LARGE LENS.]    When the polishing is done by machinery, which is the custom in Europe,  with large lenses, the polisher is slid back and forth over the lens by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4069"],[0,"The Dawn of Canadian History : A Chronicle of Aboriginal Canada (#14)"],[1," Latin, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, and French dealing with  exploration.
