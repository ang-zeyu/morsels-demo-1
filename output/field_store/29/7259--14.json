When the fluid parts have been much dissipated, or when we have  taken, by the mouth, any dry food, or acrid substance, we experience  a sensation of heat in the fauces, and at the same time a great  desire of swallowing liquids. The former sensation is called hunger,  and the latter thirst.    From the back part of the mouth passes a tube, called the oesophagus  or gullet, its upper end is wide and open, spread behind the tongue  to receive the masticated aliment: the lower part of this pipe, after  it has passed through the thorax, and pierced the diaphragm, enters  the stomach, which is a membranous bag, situated under the left side  of the diaphragm: its figure nearly resembles the pouch of a bagpipe,  the left end being most capacious; the upper side is concave, and the  lower convex: it has two orifices, both on its upper part; the left,  which is a continuation of the oesophagus, and through which the food  passes into the stomach, is named cardia; and the right, through  which the food is conveyed out of the stomach, is called pylorus:  within this last orifice is a circular valve, which, in some degree,  prevents the return of the aliment into the stomach.    From the pylorus, or right orifice of the stomach, arise the  intestines, or bowels, which consist of a long and large tube, making  several circumvolutions, in the cavity of the abdomen; this tube is  about five or six times as long as the body to which it belongs.  Though it is one continued pipe, it has been divided, by anatomists,  into six parts, three small, three large. The three small intestines  are the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum; the duodenum commences  at the pylorus, and is continued into the jejunum, which is so called  from its being generally found empty: the ileum is only a  prolongation of the jejunum, and terminates in the first of the great  intestines, called the caecum. The other great guts are the colon and  the rectum.    The whole of what has been described is only a production of the same  tube, beginning at the oesophagus. It is called by anatomists the  intestinal canal, or prima via, because it is the first passage of  the food. It has circular muscular fibres, which give it a power of  contracting when irritated by distension; and this urges forward the  food which is contained in it. This occasions a worm like motion of  the whole intestines, which is called their peristaltic motion.    The mesentery is a membrane beginning loosely on the loins, and  thence extending to all the intestines; which it preserves from  twisting by their peristaltic motion. It serves also to sustain all  the vessels going to and from the intestines, namely the arteries,  veins, lacteals, and nerves; it also contains several glands, called,  from their situation, mesenteric glands.    The lacteal vessels consist of a vast number of fine pellucid tubes,  which arise by open mouths from the intestines, and proceeding thence  through the mesentery, they frequently unite, and form fewer and  larger vessels, which pass through the mesenteric glands, into a  common receptacle or bag, called the receptacle of the chyle. The use  of these vessels is to absorb the fluid part of the digested aliment,  called chyle, and convey it into the receptacle of the chyle, that it  may be thence carried through the thoracic duct into the blood.    The receptacle of the chyle is a membranous bag, about two thirds of  an inch long, and one third of an inch wide, at its superior part it  is contracted into a slender membranous pipe, called the thoracic  duct, because its course is principally through the thorax; it passes  between the aorta and the vena azygos, then obliquely over the  oesophagus, and great curvature of the aorta, and continuing its  course towards the internal jugular vein, it enters the left  subclavian vein on its superior part.    There are several other viscera besides those I have described, which  are subservient to digestion; among these may be mentioned the liver,  gall bladder, and pancreas. The liver is the largest gland in the  body, and is situated immediately under the diaphragm, principally on  the right side. Its blood vessels that compose it as a gland, are the  branches of the vena portarum, which, as I mentioned in the last  lecture, enters the liver and distributes its blood like an artery.  From this blood the liver secretes the bile, which is conveyed by the  hepatic duct, towards the intestines: before this duct reaches the  intestines, it is joined by another, coming from the gall bladder:  these two ducts uniting, form a common duct, which enters the  duodenum obliquely, about four inches below the pylorus of the  stomach.    The gall bladder, which is a receptacle of bile, is situated between  the stomach and the liver; and the bile which comes from the liver,  along the hepatic duct, partly passes into the duodenum, and partly  along the cystic duct into the gall bladder. When the stomach is  full, it presses on the gall bladder, which will squeeze out the bile  into the duodenum at the time when it is most wanted.    The bile is a thick bitter fluid, of a yellowish green colour,  composed chiefly of soda and animal oil, forming a soap; and it is  most probably in consequence of this saponaceous property that it  assists digestion, by causing the different parts of the food to  unite together by intermediate affinity. When the bile is prevented  from flowing into the intestines, by any obstruction in the ducts,  digestion is badly performed, costiveness takes place, and the  excrements are of a white colour, from being deprived of the bile.  This fluid, stagnating in the gall bladder, is absorbed by the  lymphatics, and carried into the blood, communicating to the whole  surface of the body a yellow tinge, and other symptoms of jaundice.    The jaundice therefore is occasioned by an obstruction to the passage  of the bile into the intestines, and its subsequent absorption into  the blood: this obstruction may be caused either by concretions of  the bile, called gall stones, or by a greater viscidity of the fluid,  or by a spasm, or paralysis of the biliary ducts.    The pancreas, or sweet bread, is a large gland lying across the upper  and back part of the abdomen, near the duodenum. It has a short  excretory duct, about half as wide as a crow quill, which enters the  duodenum at the same place where the bile duct enters it.    The food being received into the mouth, is there masticated or broken  down, by the teeth, and impregnated with saliva, which is pressed out  of the salivary glands, by the motions of the jaw and the muscles of  the mouth. It then descends, through the oesophagus, into the  stomach, where it becomes digested, and, in a great measure,  dissolved, by the gastric juice, which is secreted by the arteries of  the stomach. It is then pushed through the pylorus, or right orifice  of the stomach into the duodenum, where it becomes mixed with the  bile from the gall bladder and liver, and the pancreatic juice from  the pancreas. These fluids seem to complete the digestion: after  this, the food is continually moved forwards by the peristaltic  motion of the intestines.    The chyle, or thin and milky part of the aliment, being absorbed by  the lacteals, which rise, by open mouths, from the intestines, is  carried into the receptacle of the chyle, and from thence the  thoracic duct carries it to the subclavian vein, where it mixes with  the blood, and passes with it to the heart.    The food of animals is derived from the animal or vegetable kingdoms.  There are some animals which eat only vegetables, while others live  only on animal substances. The number and form of the teeth, and the  structure of the stomach, and bowels, determine whether an animal be  herbivorous, or carnivorous. The first class have a considerable  number of grinders, or dentes molares; and the intestines are much  more long and bulky; in the second class, the cutting teeth are  predominant, and the intestines are much shorter.    Man seems to form an intermediate link between these two classes: his  teeth, and the structure of the intestines, show, that he may subsist  both on vegetable and animal food; and, in fact, he is best nourished  by a proper mixture of both. This appears from those people who live  solely on vegetables, as the Gentoo tribes, and those who subsist  solely on animals, as the fish eaters of the northern latitudes,  being a feebler generation than those of this country, who exist on a  proper mixture of both. A due proportion, therefore, of the two kinds  of nourishment, seems undoubtedly the best.    Having taken a general view of the course of the aliment into the  blood, I shall now examine more particularly, how each part of the  organs concerned in digestion, or connected with that function,  contributes to that end.    The food being received into the mouth, undergoes various  preparations, which fit it for those changes it is afterwards to  undergo. By the teeth the parts of it are divided and ground,  softened and liquified by the saliva, and properly compressed by the  action of the tongue and mastication.    The mouth, in most animals, is armed with very hard substances,  which, by the motion of the lower jaw, are brought strongly into  contact. Those parts of the teeth which are above the sockets, are  not simply bony, they are much harder than the bones, and possess the  property of resisting putrefaction, as long as this hard crust  continues to cover them. The teeth are divided into three classes:  1st. The cutting teeth, which are sharp and thin, and which serve to  cut or divide the food: 2nd. The canine teeth, which serve to tear it  into pieces still smaller: 3rd. The grinders, which present large and  uneven surfaces, and actually"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27778"],[0,"Outlines of Dairy Bacteriology, 8th edition (#14)"],[1,"milk, the conditions under which the  test is made cause such a rapid growth of the same that the evidence of  the abnormal fermentation may be readily seen in the spongy texture of  the curd (Fig. 20). If the undesirable organisms are not very abundant  and the conditions not especially suited to their growth, the \"pin  holes\" will be less frequent.    [Illustration: FIG. 19. Curd from a good milk. The large irregular holes  are mechanical.]    Sometimes the curds show no evidence of gas, but their abnormal  condition can be recognized by the \"mushy\" texture and the presence of  \"off\" flavors that are rendered more apparent by keeping them in closed  bottles. This condition is abnormal and is apt to produce quite as  serious results as if gas was formed.    ~Overcoming taints by use of starters.~ Another method of combatting  abnormal fermentations that is often fruitful, is that which rests upon  the inability of one kind of bacteria to grow in the same medium in  competition with certain other species.    Some of the undesirable taints in factories can be controlled in large  part by the introduction of starters made from certain organisms that  are able to obtain the ascendency over the taint-producing germ. Such a  method is commonly followed when a lactic ferment, either a commercial  pure culture, or a home-made starter, is added to milk to overcome the  effect of gas-generating bacteria.    [Illustration: FIG. 20. Curd from a badly tainted milk. Large ragged  holes are mechanical; numerous small holes due to gas. This curd was a  \"floater.\"]    A similar illustration is seen in the case of the \"lange wei\" (slimy  whey), that is used in the manufacture of Edam cheese to control the  character of the fermentation of the milk.    This same method is sometimes applied in dealing with certain abnormal  fermentations that are apt to occur on the farm. It is particularly  useful with those tainted milks known as \"sweet curdling.\" The ferment  organisms concerned in this change are unable to develop in the  presence of lactic acid bacteria, so the addition of a clean sour milk  as a starter restores the normal conditions by giving the ordinary milk  bacteria the ascendency.    ~Chemical disinfection.~ In exceptional instances it may be necessary to  employ chemical disinfectants to restore the normal conditions. Of  course with such diseases as tuberculosis, very stringent measures are  required, as they are such a direct menace to human life, but with these  abnormal or taint-producing fermentations, care and cleanliness, well  directed, will usually overcome the trouble.    If it becomes necessary to employ chemical substances as disinfecting  agents, their use should always be preceded by a thorough cleansing with  hot water so that the germicide may come in direct contact with the  surface to be disinfected.    It must be borne in mind that many chemicals act as deodorants, _i.e._,  destroy the offensive odor, without destroying the cause of the trouble.    _Sulfur_ is often recommended as a disinfecting agent, but its use  should be carefully controlled, otherwise the vapors have but little  germicidal power. The common practice of burning a small quantity in a  room or any closed space for a few moments has little or no effect upon  germ life. The effect of sulfur vapor (SO_{2}) alone upon germ life is  relatively slight, but if this gas is produced in the presence of  moisture, sulfurous acid (H_{2}SO_{3}) is formed, which is much more  efficient. To use this agent effectively, it must be burned in large  quantities in a moist atmosphere (three lbs. to every 1,000 cubic feet  of space), for at least twelve hours. After this operation, the space  should be thoroughly aired.    _Formalin_, a watery solution of a gas known as formaldehyde, is a new  disinfectant that recent experience has demonstrated to be very useful.  It may be used as a gas where rooms are to be disinfected, or applied as  a liquid where desired. It is much more powerful in its action than  sulfur, and it has a great advantage over mercury and other strong  disinfectants, as it is not so poisonous to man as it is to the lower  forms of life.    _Bleaching powder or chloride of lime_ is often recommended where a  chemical can be advantageously used. This substance is a good  disinfectant as well as a deodorant, and if applied as a wash, in the  proportion of four to six ounces of the powder to one gallon of water,  it will destroy most forms of life. In many cases this agent is  inapplicable on account of its odor.    _Corrosive sublimate_ (HgCl_{2}) for most purposes is a good  disinfectant, but it is such an intense poison that its use is dangerous  in places that are at all accessible to stock.    For the disinfection of walls in stables and barns, common thin _white  wash_ Ca(OH)_{2} is admirably adapted if made from freshly-burned quick  lime. It possesses strong germicidal powers, increases the amount of  light in the barn, is a good absorbent of odors, and is exceedingly  cheap.    Carbolic acid, creosote, and such products, while excellent  disinfectants, cannot well be used on account of their odor, especially  in factories.    For gutters, drains, and waste pipes in factories, _vitriol salts_  (sulfates of copper, iron and zinc) are sometimes used. These are  deodorants as well as disinfectants, and are not so objectionable to use  on account of their odor.    These suggestions as to the use of chemicals, however, only apply to  extreme cases and should not be brought into requisition until a  thorough application of hot water, soap, a little soda, and the  scrubbing brush have failed to do their work.

Practical experience with epidemic disease has abundantly demonstrated  the fact that milk not infrequently serves as a vehicle for the  dissemination of contagion. Attention has been prominently called to  this relation by Ernest Hart,[78] who in 1880 compiled statistical  evidence showing the numerous outbreaks of various contagious diseases  that had been associated with milk infection up to that time. Since  then, further compilations have been made by Freeman,[79] and also by  Busey and Kober,[80] who have collected the data with reference to  outbreaks from 1880 to 1899.    These statistics indicate the relative importance of milk as a factor in  the dissemination of disease.    The danger from this source is much intensified for the reason that  milk, generally speaking, is consumed in a raw state; and also because a  considerable number of disease-producing bacteria are able, not merely  to exist, but actually thrive and grow in milk, even though the normal  milk bacteria are also present. Moreover the recognition of the presence  of such pathogenic forms is complicated by the fact that often they do  not alter the appearance of the milk sufficiently so that their  presence can be detected by a physical examination. These facts which  have been experimentally determined, coupled with the numerous clinical  cases on record, make a strong case against milk serving as an agent in  the dissemination of disease.    ~Origin of pathogenic bacteria in milk.~ Disease-producing bacteria may be  grouped with reference to their relation toward milk into two classes,  depending upon the manner in which infection occurs:    Class I. Disease-producing bacteria capable of being transmitted  directly from a diseased animal to man through the medium of infected  milk.    Class II. Bacteria pathogenic for man but not for cattle which are  capable of thriving in milk after it is drawn from the animal.    In the first group the disease produced by the specific organism must be  common to both cattle and man. The organism must live a parasitic life  in the animal, developing in the udder, and so infect the milk supply.  It may, of course, happen that diseases toward which domestic animals  alone are susceptible may be spread from one animal to another in this  way without affecting human beings.    In the second group, the bacterial species lives a saprophytic  existence, growing in milk, if it happens to find its way therein. In  such cases"]]]
