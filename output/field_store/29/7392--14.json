Zygodactyla seen in profile.]    The large digestive cavity hangs from the centre of the under side of  the disk (Fig. 75), terminating in the proboscis, which, in this kind  of Jelly-fish, is short in proportion to the diameter of the disk,  while the opening of the mouth is very large. (Fig. 74.) It is  unfortunate that a variety of inappropriate names, likely to mislead  rather than aid the unscientific observer, have been applied to  different parts of the Jelly-fish. What we call here digestive cavity,  proboscis, and mouth, are, in fact, parts of one organ. An exceedingly  delicate, transparent, filmy membrane hangs from the under side of the  disk; that membrane forms the outer wall of the digestive cavity,  which it encloses; it narrows toward its lower margin, leaving open  the circular aperture called the mouth; this narrowing of the membrane  is produced by a number of folds in its lower part, while at its  margin these folds spread out to form ruffles around the edge of the  mouth, and these ruffles again extend into the long scalloped fringes  hanging down below.    The motion of these Jelly-fishes is very slow and sluggish. Like all  their kind, they move by the alternate dilatation and contraction of  the disk, but in the Zygodactyla these undulations have a certain  graceful indolence, very unlike the more rapid movements of many of  the Medusae. It often remains quite motionless for a long time, and  then, if you try to excite it by disturbing the water in the tank, or  by touching it, it heaves a slow, lazy sigh, with the whole body  rising slightly as it does so, and then relapses into its former  inactivity. Indeed, one cannot help being reminded, when watching the  variety in the motions of the different kinds of Jelly-fishes, of the  difference of temperament in human beings. There are the alert and  active ones, ever on the watch, ready to seize the opportunity as it  comes, but missing it sometimes from too great impatience; and the  slow, steady people, with very regular movements, not so quick  perhaps, but as successful in the long run; and the dreamy, indolent  characters, of which the Zygodactyla is one, always floating languidly  about, and rarely surprised into any sudden or abrupt expression. One  would say, too, that they have their aristocratic circles; for there  is a delicate, high-bred grace about some of them quite wanting in the  coarser kinds. The lithe, flexible form of the greyhound is not in  stronger contrast to the heavy, square build of the bull dog, than are  some of the lighter, more frail species of Jelly-fish to the more  solid and clumsy ones. Among these finer kinds we would place the  Tima. (Fig. 76.)      _Tima_. (_Tima formosa_ AG.)    One's vocabulary is soon exhausted in describing the different degrees  of consistency in the substance of Jelly-fishes. Delicate and  transparent as is the Tima, it has yet a certain robustness and  solidity beside the Oceania, described above. In fact, all are  gelatinous, all are more or less transparent, and it is not easy to  describe the various shades of solidity in jelly. Perhaps they may be  more accurately represented by the impression made upon the touch than  upon the sight. If, for instance, you place your hand upon a  Zygodactyla, you feel that you have come in contact with a substance  that has a positive consistency; but if you dip your finger into a  bowl where a Tima is swimming, and touch its disk, you will feel no  difference between it and the water in which it floats, and will not  be aware that you have reached it till the animal shrinks away from  the contact.        [Illustration: Fig. 76. Tima; half natural size.]        [Illustration: Fig. 77. One of the lips of the mouth at the      extremity of the long proboscis; _m_ mouth, _d_ digestive cavity,      _c_ chymiferous tube.]    The adult Tima, represented in Fig. 76, is not more than an inch and a  half or two inches in diameter. Instead of countless tubes diverging  from the digestive cavity to the margin of the disk, as in the  Zygodactyla, there are but four. The digestive cavity in the Tima is  much smaller than in the Zygodactyla, and is placed at the end of the  proboscis, which is long, and hangs down far below the disk. This  removal of the digestive cavity to the extremity of the proboscis  gives to the tubes arising from it a very different and much sharper  curve than they have in the Zygodactyla. In the Tima they start from  the end of the proboscis, as may be seen in the wood-cut (Fig. 76),  and then turn abruptly off, when they arrive at the under surface of  the disk, to reach its margin. The disk has, as usual, its veil and  its fringe of tentacles; the tentacles in the full-grown Tima are  few,--seven in all the four intermediate spaces between the tubes,  with one at the base of each tube, making thirty-two in all. The  ovaries, which are milk-white, follow the line of the tubes, as in the  Zygodactyla, and have very undulating folds when full of eggs. The  tubes meet in the digestive cavity, the margin of which spreads out to  form four ruffled edges that hang down from it. One of these ruffles,  considerably magnified, is represented in Fig. 77. In Fig. 78 we have  a portion of the Hydroid stock from which this Jelly-fish arises, also  greatly magnified. The Tima is very active, yet not abrupt in its  motions; but when in good condition it is constantly moving about,  rising to the surface by the regular pulsations of the disk, or  swimming from side to side, or poising itself quietly in the water,  giving now and then a gentle undulation to keep itself in position.        [Illustration: Fig. 78. Magnified head of Hydrarium of Tima.]    Though not a very frequent visitor of our shores, the appearance of  the Tima is not limited by the seasons, since they are found at all  times of the year. It is a fact, unexplained as yet, that the Tima and  many other Jelly-fishes are never seen except when full grown. What  may be the haunts and habits of these animals from the time of their  hatching till they make their appearance again in the adult condition,  is not known, though it is probable that they remain at the bottom  during this period, and only come to the surface to spawn. This  impression is confirmed by the observations made upon a very young  Cyanea which was kept for a long time in confinement; but a question  of this kind cannot of course be settled by a single experiment.[6]    [Footnote 6: Since the above was written, I have had an opportunity of  learning some additional facts respecting the habits of the young  Cyanea, which may, perhaps, apply to other Jelly-fishes also. Having  occasion to visit the wharves at Provincetown at about four o'clock  one morning, I was surprised to find thousands of the spring brood of  Cyaneae, hitherto supposed to pass the early period of their existence  wholly in deep water, floating about near the surface. They varied in  size, some being no larger than a three-cent-piece, while others were  from an inch in diameter to three inches. It would seem that they make  their appearance only during the earliest morning hours, for at seven  o'clock, when I returned to the same spot, they had all vanished. It  may be that other young Medusae have the same habits of early rising,  and that instead of coming to bask in the midday sunshine, like their  elders, they prefer the cooler hours of the dawn. (_A. Agassiz_.)]      _Melicertum_. (_Melicertum campanula_ PER. et LES.)    A pretty Medusa, smaller and far more readily obtained than the Tima,  is the Melicertum. (Fig. 80.) Its disk has a yellowish hue, and from  its margin hangs a heavy row of yellow tentacles, while the eight  ovaries (Fig. 79) are of a darker shade of the same color. This little  golden-tinted Jelly-fish, moving through the water with short, quick  throbs, produced by the rapid rise and fall of the disk, is a very  graceful object. Its bright color, made particularly prominent by the  darker undulating lines of the ovaries, which become very marked near  the spawning season, renders it more conspicuous in the water than one  would suppose from its size; for it does not measure more than an inch  in height when full grown. (See Fig. 80.)        [Illustration: Fig. 79. Melicertum campanula seen from above; _m_      mouth, _o o_ ovaries, _t t_ tentacles. (_Agassiz_.)]      _Development of Melicertum and Tima_.        [Illustration: Fig. 80. Melicertum seen in profile; natural size.]    In the Melicertum and Tima we have had the good fortune to trace the  process by which the eggs are changed into Hydroid communities. If any  one has a curiosity to follow for themselves this singular history of  alternate generations, the Melicertum is a good subject for the  experiment, as it thrives well in confinement. After keeping a number  of them in a large glass jar for a couple of days at the time of  spawning, it will be found that the ovaries, which were at first quite  full of eggs, are emptied, and that a number of planulae; are swimming  about near the bottom of the vessel. After a day or two the outline of  these planulae, spherical at first, becomes pear-shaped (see Fig. 81),  and presently they attach themselves by the blunt end to the bottom of  the jar. (Fig. 82.) Thus their Hydroid life begins; they elongate  gradually, the horny sheath is formed around them, tentacles arise on  the upper end, short and stunted at first, but tapering rapidly out  into fine flexible feelers, the stem branches, and we have a little  Hydroid community (Fig. 83), upon which, in the course of the  following spring, the reproductive calycles containing the Medusae buds  will be developed, as in the case of the Eucope and Clytia. The Tima  passes through exactly the same process, though the shape of the  planulae and the appearance of the young differ from that of the  Melicertum, as may be seen in Fig."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35514"],[0,"The Great Apostasy, Considered in the Light of Scriptural and Secular History (#14)"],[1,"of  those that were seized discovered a great multitude of their  accomplices, and they were all convicted, not so much for the crime of  setting fire to the city, as for their hatred of human kind. They died  in torments, and their torments were embittered by insults and  derision. Some were nailed on crosses; others sewn up in the skins of  wild beasts and exposed to the fury of dogs; others, again, smeared  over with combustible materials, were used as torches to illuminate  the darkness of the night. The gardens of Nero were destined for the  melancholy spectacle, which was accompanied with a horse-race, and  honored with the presence of the emperor, who mingled with the  populace in the dress and attitude of a charioteer. The guilt of the  Christians deserved indeed the most exemplary punishments, but the  public abhorrence was changed into commiseration, from the opinion  that those unhappy wretches were sacrificed, not so much to the public  welfare as to the cruelty of a jealous tyrant.\"--(Tacitus, Annals,  Book 15, ch. 44.)    10. There is some disagreement among historians as to whether the  Neronian persecution is to be regarded as a local infliction,  practically confined to the city of Rome, or as general throughout the  provinces.--(See Note 3, end of chapter.) The consensus of opinion  favors the belief that the provinces followed the example of the  metropolis, and that the persecution was common throughout the Church.    11. This, the first persecution by Roman edict, practically ended with  the death of the tyrant Nero, A. D. 68. According to tradition handed  down from the early Christian writers, the Apostles Paul and Peter  suffered martyrdom at Rome, the former by beheading, the latter by  crucifixion, during this persecution; and it is further stated that  Peter's wife was put to death shortly before her husband; but the  tradition is neither confirmed nor disproved by authentic record.    12. _Persecution under Domitian_. The second officially appointed  persecution under Roman authority began 93 or 94 A. D. in the reign of  Domitian. Both Christians and Jews came under this prince's  displeasure, because they refused to reverence the statues he had  erected as objects of adoration. A further cause for his special  animosity against Christians, as affirmed by early writers, is as  follows. The emperor was persuaded that he was in danger of losing his  throne, in view of a reputed prediction that from the family to which  Jesus belonged there would arise one who would weaken if not overthrow  the power of Rome. With this as his ostensible excuse, this wicked  ruler waged terrible destruction on an innocent people. Happily, the  persecution thus started was of but few years duration. Mosheim and  others aver that the end of the persecution was caused by the  emperor's untimely death; though Eusebius, who wrote in the fourth  century, quotes an earlier writer as declaring that Domitian had the  living descendants of the Savior's family brought before him, and that  after questioning them he became convinced that he was in no danger  from them; and thereupon dismissed them with contempt and ordered the  persecution to cease. It is believed that while the edict of Domitian  was in force the Apostle John suffered banishment to the isle of  Patmos.    13. _Persecution under Trajan_. What is known in ecclesiastical  history as the third persecution of the Christian Church took place in  the reign of Trajan, who occupied the imperial throne from 98 to 117  A. D. He was and is regarded as one of the best of the Roman emperors,  yet he sanctioned violent persecution of the Christians owing to their  \"inflexible obstinacy\" in refusing to sacrifice to Roman gods. History  has preserved to us a very important letter asking instructions from  the emperor, by the younger Pliny, who was governor of Pontus, and the  emperor's reply thereto. This correspondence is instructive as showing  the extent to which Christianity had spread at that time, and the way  in which believers were treated by the officers of the state.    14. Pliny inquired of the emperor as to the policy to be pursued in  dealing with the Christians within his jurisdiction. Were young and  old, tender and robust, to be treated alike, or should punishment be  graded? Should opportunity be given the accused to recant, or was the  fact that they had once professed Christianity to be considered an  unpardonable offense? Were those convicted as Christians to be  punished for their religion alone, or only for specific offenses  resulting from their membership in the Christian Church? After  propounding such queries the governor proceeded to report to the  emperor what he had done in the absence of definite instructions. In  reply the emperor directed that the Christians were not to be hunted  nor sought after vindictively, but if accused and brought before the  judgment seat, and if then they refused to denounce their faith, they  were to be put to death.--(See Note 4, end of chapter.)    15. _Persecution under Marcus Aurelius_. Marcus Aurelius reigned from  161 to 180 A. D. He was noted as one who sought the greatest good of  his people; yet under his government the Christians suffered added  cruelties. Persecution was most severe in Gaul (now France.) Among  those who met the martyr's fate at that time, were Polycarp, bishop of  Smyrna, and Justin Martyr, known in history as the philosopher. With  reference to the seeming anomaly that even the best of rulers  permitted and even prosecuted vigorous opposition to Christian  devotees, as exemplified by the acts of this emperor, a modern writer  has said: \"It should be noted that the persecution of the Christians  under the pagan emperors sprung from political rather than religious  motives, and that is why we find the names of the best emperors, as  well as those of the worst, in the list of persecutors. It was  believed that the welfare of the state was bound up with the careful  performance of the rites of the national worship; and hence, while the  Roman rulers were usually very tolerant allowing all forms of worship  among their subjects, still they required that men of every faith  should at least recognize the Roman gods, and burn incense before  their statues. This the Christians steadily refused to do. Their  neglect of the service of the temple, it was believed, angered the  gods, and endangered the safety of the state, bringing upon it  drought, pestilence, and every disaster. This was the main reason of  their persecution by the pagan emperors.\"--(General History by P. V.  N. Myers, edition of 1889, p. 322.)    16. _Later Persecutions_. With occasional periods of partial  cessation, the Christian believers continued to suffer at the hands of  heathen opponents throughout the second and third centuries. A violent  persecution marked the reign of Severus (193-211 A. D.) in the first  decade of the third century; another characterized the reign of  Maximin (235-238 A. D.) A period of unusual severity in persecution  and suffering befell the Christians during the short reign of Decius  known also as Decius Trajan (219-251 A. D.) The persecution under  Decius is designated in ecclesiastical history as the seventh  persecution of the Christian Church. Others followed in rapid  succession. Some of these periods of specific oppression we pass over  and come to the consideration of the    17. _Diocletian Persecution_, which is spoken of as the tenth, and  happily the last. Diocletian reigned from 284 to 305 A. D. At first he  was very tolerant toward Christian belief and practice; indeed it is  of record that his wife and daughter were Christians, though \"in some  sense, secretly.\" Later, however, he turned against the Church and  undertook to bring about a total suppression of the Christian  religion. To this end he ordered a general destruction of Christian  books, and decreed the penalty of death against all who kept such  works in their possession.    18. Fire broke out twice in the royal palace at Nicomedia, and on each  occasion the incendiary act was charged against the Christians with  terrible results. Four separate edicts, each surpassing in vehemence  the earlier decrees, were issued against the believers; and for a  period of ten years they were the victims of unrestrained rapine,  spoliation and torture. At the end of the decade of terror the Church  was in a scattered and seemingly in a hopeless condition. Sacred  records had been burnt; places of worship had been razed to the  ground; thousands of Christians had been put to death; and every  possible effort had been made to destroy the Church and abolish  Christianity from the earth. Descriptions of the horrible extremes to  which brutality was carried are sickening to the soul. A single  example must suffice. Eusebius, referring to the persecutions in  Egypt, says: \"And such too was the severity of the struggle which was  endured by the Egyptians, who wrestled gloriously for the faith at  Tyre. Thousands, both men, and women and children, despising the  present life for the sake of our Savior's doctrine, submitted to death  in various shapes. Some, after being tortured with scrappings and the  rack, and the most dreadful scourgings, and other innumerable agonies  which one might shudder to hear, were finally committed to the flames;  and some plunged and drowned in the sea, others voluntarily offering  their own heads to their executioners, others dying in the midst of  their torments, some wasted away by famine, and others again fixed to  the cross. Some, indeed, were executed as malefactors usually were;  others, more cruelly, were nailed with the head downwards, and kept  alive until they were destroyed by starving on the cross  itself.\"--(Eusebius, \"Eccl. Hist.,\" Book 8, ch. 8.)    19. A modern writer, whose tendency ever was to minimize the extent of  Christian persecution, is Edward Gibbon. His account of the"]]]
