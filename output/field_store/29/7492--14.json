Inside the entrance was a domed hall with a flight of stairs leading  to an upper balcony. Around the hall were several doorways hung with  curtains made of woven seaweeds. Chairs and benches stood against  the wall, and these astonished the visitors because neither stairs  nor chairs seemed useful in a kingdom where every living thing was  supposed to swim and have a fish's tail. In Queen Aquareine's  palaces benches for reclining were used, and stairs were wholly  unnecessary, but in the Palace of Zog the furniture and fittings  were much like those of a house upon earth, and except that every  space here was filled with water instead of air, Trot and Cap'n Bill  might have imagined themselves in a handsome earthly castle.    The little group paused half fearfully in the hall, yet so far there  was surely nothing to be afraid of. They were wondering what to do  next when the curtains of an archway were pushed aside and a boy  entered. To Trot's astonishment, he had legs and walked upon them  naturally and with perfect ease. He was a delicate, frail-looking  little fellow, dressed in a black velvet suit with knee breeches.  The bows at his throat and knees were of colored seaweeds, woven  into broad ribbons. His hair was yellow and banged across his  forehead. His eyes were large and dark, with a pleasant, merry  sparkle in them. Around his neck he wore a high ruff, but in spite  of this Trot could see that below his plump cheeks were several  scarlet-edged slits that looked like the gills of fishes, for they  gently opened and closed as the boy breathed in the water by which  he was surrounded. These gills did not greatly mar the lad's  delicate beauty, and he spread out his arms and bowed low and  gracefully in greeting.    \"Hello,\" said Trot.    \"Why, I'd like to,\" replied the boy with a laugh, \"but being a mere  slave, it isn't proper for me to hello. But it's good to see earth  people again, and I'm glad you're here.\"    \"We're not glad,\" observed the girl. \"We're afraid.\"    \"You'll get over that,\" declared the boy smilingly. \"People lose a  lot of time being afraid. Once I was myself afraid, but I found it  was no fun, so I gave it up.\"    \"Why were we brought here?\" inquired Queen Aquareine gently.    \"I can't say, madam, being a mere slave,\" replied the boy. \"But you  have reminded me of my errand. I am sent to inform you all that Zog  the Forsaken, who hates all the world and is hated by all the world,  commands your presence in his den.\"    \"Do you hate Zog, too?\" asked Trot.    \"Oh no,\" answered the boy. \"People lose a lot of time in hating  others, and there's no fun in it at all. Zog may be hateful, but I'm  not going to waste time hating him. You may do so, if you like.\"    \"You are a queer child,\" remarked the Mermaid Queen, looking at him  attentively. \"Will you tell us who you are?\"    \"Once I was Prince Sacho of Sacharhineolaland, which is a sweet  country, but hard to pronounce,\" he answered. \"But in this domain I  have but one title and one name, and that is 'Slave.'\"    \"How came you to be Zog's slave?\" asked Clia.    \"The funniest adventure you ever heard of,\" asserted the boy with  eager pride. \"I sailed in a ship that went to pieces in a storm. All  on board were drowned but me, and I came mighty near it, to tell the  truth. I went down deep, deep into the sea, and at the bottom was  Zog, watching the people drown. I tumbled on his head, and he  grabbed and saved me, saying I would make a useful slave. By his  magic power he made me able to live under water as the fishes live,  and he brought me to this castle and taught me to wait upon him as  his other slaves do.\"    \"Isn't it a dreadful, lonely life?\" asked Trot.    \"No indeed,\" said Sacho. \"We haven't any time to be lonely, and the  dreadful things Zog does are very exciting and amusing, I assure  you. He keeps us guessing every minute, and that makes the life here  interesting. Things were getting a bit slow an hour ago, but now  that you are here, I'm in hopes we will all be kept busy and amused  for some time.\"    \"Are there many others in the castle besides you and Zog?\" asked  Aquareine.    \"Dozens of us. Perhaps hundreds. I've never counted them,\" said the  boy. \"But Zog is the only master; all the rest of us are in the same  class, so there is no jealousy among the slaves.\"    \"What is Zog like?\" Cap'n Bill questioned.    At this the boy laughed, and the laugh was full of mischief. \"If I  could tell you what Zog is like, it would take me a year,\" was the  reply. \"But I can't tell you. Every one has a different idea of what  he's like, and soon you will see him yourselves.\"    \"Are you fond of him?\" asked Trot.    \"If I said yes, I'd get a good whipping,\" declared Sacho. \"I am  commanded to hate Zog, and being a good servant, I try to obey. If  anyone dared to like Zog, I am sure he'd be instantly fed to the  turtles; so I advise you not to like him.\"    \"Oh, we won't,\" promised Trot.    \"But we're keeping the master waiting, and that is also a dangerous  thing to do,\" continued the boy. \"If we don't hurry up, Zog will  begin to smile, and when he smiles there is trouble brewing.\"    The queen sighed. \"Lead the way, Sacho,\" she said. \"We will follow.\"    The boy bowed again, and going to an archway, held aside the  curtains for them. They first swam into a small anteroom which led  into a long corridor, at the end of which was another curtained  arch. Through this Sacho also guided them, and now they found  themselves in a cleverly constructed maze. Every few feet were  twists and turns and sharp corners, and sometimes the passage would  be wide, and again so narrow that they could just squeeze through in  single file. \"Seems like we're gettin' further into the trap,\"  growled Cap'n Bill. \"We couldn't find our way out o' here to save  our lives.\"    \"Oh yes we could,\" replied Clia, who was just behind him. \"Such a  maze may indeed puzzle you, but the queen or I could lead you safely  through it again, I assure you. Zog is not so clever as he thinks  himself.\"    The sailor, however, found the maze very bewildering, and so did  Trot. Passages ran in every direction, crossing and recrossing, and  it seemed wonderful that the boy Sacho knew just which way to go.  But he never hesitated an instant. Trot looked carefully to see if  there were any marks to guide him, but every wall was of plain,  polished marble, and every turning looked just like all the others.  Suddenly Sacho stopped short. They were now in a broader passage,  but as they gathered around their conductor they found further  advance blocked. Solid walls faced them, and here the corridor  seemed to end.    \"Enter!\" said a clear voice.    \"But we can't!\" protested Trot.    \"Swim straight ahead,\" whispered the boy in soft tones. \"There is no  real barrier before you. Your eyes are merely deceived by magic.\"    \"Ah, I understand,\" said Aquareine, nodding her pretty head. And  then she took Mayre's hand and swam boldly forward, while Cap'n Bill  followed holding the hand of Clia. And behold! the marble wall  melted away before them, and they found themselves in a chamber more  splendid than even the fairy mermaids had ever seen before.          CHAPTER 13    PRISONERS OF THE SEA MONSTER      The room in the enchanted castle which Zog called the \"den\" and in  which the wicked sea monster passed most of his time was a perfectly  shaped dome of solid gold. The upper part of this dome was thickly  set with precious jewels--diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds,  which sparkled beautifully through the crystal water. The lower  walls were as thickly studded with pearls, all being of perfect  shape and color. Many of the pearls were larger than any which may  be found upon earth, for the sea people knew where to find the very  best and hide them away where men cannot discover them.    The golden floor was engraved with designs of rare beauty, depicting  not only sea life, but many adventures upon land. In the room were  several large, golden cabinets, the doors of which were closed and  locked, and in addition to the cabinets there were tables, chairs  and sofas, the latter upholstered with softest sealskins. Handsome  rugs of exquisitely woven seaweeds were scattered about, the colors  of which were artistically blended together. In one corner a  fountain of air bubbled up through the water. The entire room was  lighted as brilliantly as if exposed to the direct rays of the sun,  yet where this light came from our friends could not imagine. No  lamp or other similar device was visible anywhere.    The strangers at first scarcely glanced at all these beautiful  things, for in an easy chair sat Zog himself, more wonderful than  any other living creature, and as they gazed upon him, their eyes  seemed fascinated as if held by a spell. Zog's face was the face of  a man, except that the tops of his ears were pointed like horns and  he had small horns instead of eyebrows and a horn on the end of his  chin. In spite of these deformities, the expression of the face was  not unpleasant or repulsive. His hair was carefully parted and  brushed, and his mouth and nose were not only perfect in shape but  quite handsome.    Only the eyes betrayed Zog and made him terrible to all beholders.  They seemed like coals of glowing fire and sparkled so fiercely that  no one ever cared to meet their gaze for more than an instant.  Perhaps the monster realized this, for he usually drooped his long  lashes over his fiery eyes to shut out their glare. Zog had two  well-shaped legs which ended in the hoofs of beasts instead of feet,  and these hoofs were shod with gold. His body was a shapeless mass  covered with richly embroidered raiment, over which a great robe of  cloth of gold fell in many folds. This robe was intended to hide the  magician's body from view, but Trot noticed that the cloth moved  constantly in little ripples, as if"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/436"],[0,"The Master Key (#14)"],[1,"et, while  his comrades laughed at him.  The boy was now rifled of seventeen cents  in pennies, a broken pocket knife and a lead-pencil, the last article  seeming to be highly prized.    After they had secured all the booty they could find, the tall Turk,  who seemed the leader of the three, violently kicked at the prisoner  with his heavy boot.  His surprise was great when the Garment of  Repulsion arrested the blow and nearly overthrew the aggressor in turn.  Snatching a dagger from his sash, he bounded upon the boy so fiercely  that the next instant the enraged Turk found himself lying upon his  back three yards away, while his dagger flew through the air and landed  deep in the desert sands.    \"Keep it up!\" cried Rob, bitterly.  \"I hope you'll enjoy yourself.\"    The other Turks raised their comrade to his feet, and the three stared  at one another in surprise, being unable to understand how a bound  prisoner could so effectually defend himself.  But at a whispered word  from the leader, they drew their long pistols and fired point blank  into Rob's face.  The volley echoed sharply from the city walls, but as  the smoke drifted slowly away the Turks were horrified to see their  intended victim laughing at them.    Uttering cries of terror and dismay, the three took to their heels and  bounded towards the wall, where a gate quickly opened to receive them,  the populace feeling sure the Tatar horde was upon them.    Nor was this guess so very far wrong; for as Rob, sitting disconsolate  upon the sand, raised his eyes, he saw across the desert a dark line  that marked the approach of the invaders.    Nearer and nearer they came, while Rob watched them and bemoaned the  foolish impulse that had led him to fall asleep in an unknown land  where he could so easily be overpowered and robbed of his treasures.    \"I always suspected these electrical inventions would be my ruin some  day,\" he reflected, sadly; \"and now I'm side-tracked and left helpless  in this outlandish country, without a single hope of ever getting home  again.  They probably won't be able to kill me, unless they find my  Garment of Repulsion and strip that off; but I never could cross this  terrible desert on foot and, having lost my food tablets, I'd soon  starve if I attempted it.\"    Fortunately, he had eaten one of the tablets just before going to  sleep, so there was no danger of immediate starvation.  But he was  miserable and unhappy, and remained brooding over his cruel fate until  a sudden shout caused him to look up.          14.  Turk and Tatar      The Tatars had arrived, swiftly and noiselessly, and a dozen of the  warriors, still mounted, were surrounding him.    His helpless condition aroused their curiosity, and while some of them  hastily cut away his bonds and raised him to his feet, other plied him  with questions in their own language.  Rob shook his head to indicate  that he could not understand; so they led him to the chief--an immense,  bearded representative of the tribe of Kara-Khitai, the terrible and  relentless Black Tatars of Thibet.  The huge frame of this fellow was  clothed in flowing robes of cloth-of-gold, braided with jewels, and he  sat majestically upon the back of a jet-black camel.    Under ordinary circumstances the stern features and flashing black eyes  of this redoubtable warrior would have struck a chill of fear to the  boy's heart; but now under the influence of the crushing misfortunes he  had experienced, he was able to gaze with indifference upon the  terrible visage of the desert chief.    The Tatar seemed not to consider Rob an enemy.  Instead, he looked upon  him as an ally, since the Turks had bound and robbed him.    Finding it impossible to converse with the chief, Rob took refuge in  the sign language.  He turned his pockets wrong side out, showed the  red welts left upon his wrists by the tight cord, and then shook his  fists angrily in the direction of the town.    In return the Tatar nodded gravely and issued an order to his men.    By this time the warriors were busily pitching tents before the walls  of Yarkand and making preparations for a formal siege.  In obedience to  the chieftain's orders, Rob was given a place within one of the tents  nearest the wall and supplied with a brace of brass-mounted pistols and  a dagger with a sharp, zigzag edge.  These were evidently to assist the  boy in fighting the Turks, and he was well pleased to have them.  His  spirits rose considerably when he found he had fallen among friends,  although most of his new comrades had such evil faces that it was  unnecessary to put on the Character Markers to judge their natures with  a fair degree of accuracy.    \"I can't be very particular about the company I keep,\" he thought, \"and  this gang hasn't tried to murder me, as the rascally Turks did.  So for  the present I'll stand in with the scowling chief and try to get a shot  at the thieves who robbed me.  If our side wins I may get a chance to  recover some of my property.  It's a slim chance, of course, but it's  the only hope I have left.\"    That very evening an opportunity occurred for Rob to win glory in the  eyes of his new friends.  Just before sundown the gates of the city  flew open and a swarm of Turks, mounted upon fleet horses and camels,  issued forth and fell upon their enemies.  The Tatars, who did not  expect the sally, were scarcely able to form an opposing rank when they  found themselves engaged in a hand-to-hand conflict, fighting  desperately for their lives.  In such a battle, however, the Turks were  at a disadvantage, for the active Tatars slipped beneath their horses  and disabled them, bringing both the animals and their riders to the  earth.    At the first onslaught Rob shot his pistol at a Turk and wounded him so  severely that he fell from his horse.  Instantly the boy seized the  bridle and sprang upon the steed's back, and the next moment he had  dashed into the thickest part of the fray.  Bullets and blows rained  upon him from all sides, but the Garment of Repulsion saved him from a  single scratch.    When his pistols had been discharged he caught up the broken handle of  a spear, and used it as a club, galloping into the ranks of the Turks  and belaboring them as hard as he could.  The Tatars cheered and  followed him, and the Turks were so amazed at his miraculous escape  from their bullets that they became terrified, thinking he bore a  charmed life and was protected by unseen powers.    This terror helped turn the tide of battle, and before long the enemy  was pressed back to the walls and retreated through the gates, which  were hastily fastened behind them.    In order to prevent a repetition of this sally the Tatars at once  invested the gates, so that if the Turks should open them they were as  likely to let their foes in as to oppose them.    While the tents were being moved up Rob had an opportunity to search  the battlefield for the bodies of the three Turks who had robbed him,  but they were not among the fallen.    \"Those fellows were too cowardly to take part in a fair fight,\"  declared the boy; but he was much disappointed, nevertheless, as he  felt very helpless without the electric tube or the traveling machine.    The Tatar chief now called Rob to his tent and presented him with a  beautiful ring set with a glowing pigeon's-blood ruby, in  acknowledgment of his services.  This gift made the boy feel very  proud, and he said to the chief:    \"You're all right, old man, even if you do look like a pirate.  If you  can manage to capture that city, so I can get my electrical devices  back, I'll consider you a trump as long as I live.\"    The chief thought this speech was intended to express Rob's gratitude,  so he bowed solemnly in return.    During the night that followed upon the first engagement of the Turks  and Tatars, the boy lay awake trying to devise some plan to capture the  city.  The walls seemed too high and thick to be either scaled or  broken by the Tatars, who had no artillery whatever; and within the  walls lay all the fertile part of the oasis, giving the besieged a good  supply of water and provisions, while the besiegers were obliged to  subsist on what water and food they had brought with them.    Just before dawn Rob left his tent and went out to look at the great  wall.  The stars gave plenty of light, but the boy was worried to find  that, according to Eastern custom, no sentries or guards whatever had  been posted and all the Tatars were slumbering soundly.    The city was likewise wrapped in profound silence, but just as Rob was  turning away he saw a head project stealthily over the edge of the wall  before him, and recognized in the features one of the Turks who had  robbed him.    Finding no one awake except the boy the fellow sat upon the edge of the  wall, with his feet dangling downward, and grinned wickedly at his  former victim.  Rob watched him with almost breathless eagerness.    After making many motions that conveyed no meaning whatever, the Turk  drew the electric tube from his pocket and pointed his finger first at  the boy and then at the instrument, as if inquiring what it was used  for.  Rob shook his head.  The Turk turned the tube over several times  and examined it carefully, after which he also shook his head, seeming  greatly puzzled.    By this time the boy was fairly trembling with excitement.  He longed  to recover this valuable weapon, and feared that at any moment the  curious Turk would discover its use.  He held out his hand toward the  tube, and tried to say, by motions, that he would show the fellow how  to use it.  The man seemed to understand, by he would not let the  glittering instrument out of his possession.    Rob was almost in despair, when he happened to notice upon his hand the  ruby ring given him by the chief.  Drawing the jewel from his finger he  made offer, by signs, that he would exchange it for the tube.    The Turk was much pleased"]]]
