The investigators are  of the opinion that these organisms exhibit the essential characters of  the algae known as Chlamydomonadae, and that after they have entered the  worm they play for it the part of an excretory system.         [Footnote Q: Q. J. Microsc. Sci. London, xxii. p. 229       (1882).]         [Footnote R: Arch. Naturg. Berlin, lix (i), p. 260 (1893).]    As they exist in the cells of _Spongilla_ the corpuscles are minute oval  bodies of a bright green colour and each containing a highly refractile  colourless granule. A considerable number may be present in a single  cell. It is found in European sponges that they lose their green colour  if the sponge is not exposed to bright sunlight. In India, however,  where the light is stronger, this is not always the case. Even when the  colour goes, the corpuscles can still be distinguished as pale images of  their green embodiment. They are called _Chlorella_ by botanists, who  have studied their life-history but have not yet discovered the full  cycle. See Beyerinck in the Botan. Zeitung for 1890 (vol. xlviii, p.  730, pl. vii; Leipzig), and for further references West's 'British  Freshwater Algae,' p. 230 (1904).    The list of beneficent organisms less commonly present than the green  corpuscles includes a _Chironomus_ larva that builds parchment-like  tubes in the substance of _Spongilla carteri_ and so assists in  supporting the sponge, and of a peculiar little worm (_Chaetogaster  spongillae_[S]) that appears to assist in cleaning up the skeleton of the  same sponge at the approach of the hot weather and in setting free the  gemmules (p. 93).         [Footnote S: Journ. As. Soc. Beng. n. s. ii, 1906, p. 189.]    (c) _Organisms that take shelter in the Sponge or adhere to it  externally._    There are many animals which take shelter in the cavities of the sponge  without apparently assisting it in any way. Among these are the little  fish _Gobius alcockii_, which lays its eggs inside the oscula of _S.  carteri_, thus ensuring not only protection but also a proper supply of  oxygen for them (p. 94); the molluscs (_Corbula_, spp.) found inside _S.  alba_ var. _bengalensis_ (p. 78); and the Isopod (_Tachaea  spongillicola_) that makes its way into the oscula of _Spongilla  carteri_ and _S. crateriformis_ (pp. 86, 94).    In Europe a peculiar ciliated Protozoon (_Trichodina spongillae_) is  found attached to the external surface of freshwater sponges. I have  noticed a similar species at Igatpuri on _Spongilla crateriformis_, but  it has not yet been identified. It probably has no effect, good or bad,  on the sponge.      FRESHWATER SPONGES IN RELATION TO MAN.    In dealing with _Spongilla carteri_ I have suggested that sponges may be  of some hygienic importance in absorbing putrid organic matter from  water used both for ablutionary and for drinking purposes, as is so  commonly the case with regard to ponds in India. Their bad odour has  caused some species of Spongillidae to be regarded as capable of  polluting water, but a mere bad odour does not necessarily imply that  they are insanitary.    Unless my suggestion that sponges purify water used for drinking  purposes by absorbing putrid matter should prove to be supported by  fact, the Spongillidae cannot be said to be of any practical benefit to  man. The only harm that has been imputed to them is that of polluting  water[T], of blocking up water-pipes by their growth--a very rare  occurrence,--and of causing irritation to the human skin by means of  their spicules--a still rarer one. At least one instance is, however,  reported in which men digging in a place where a pond had once been were  attacked by a troublesome rash probably due to the presence of  sponge-spicules in the earth, and students of the freshwater sponges  should be careful not to rub their eyes after handling dried specimens.         [Footnote T: See Potts, Proc. Ac. Philad. 1884, p. 28.]      INDIAN SPONGILLIDAE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF OTHER COUNTRIES.    In Weltner's catalogue of the freshwater sponges (1895) seventy-six  recent species of Spongillidae (excluding _Lubosmirskia_) are enumerated,  and the number now known is well over a hundred. In India we have  twenty-nine species, subspecies, and varieties, while from the whole of  Europe only about a dozen are known. In the neighbourhood of Calcutta  nine species, representing three genera and a subgenus, have been found;  all of them occur in the Museum tank. The only other region of similar  extent that can compare with India as regards the richness of its  freshwater sponge fauna is that of the Amazon, from which about twenty  species are known. From the whole of North America, which has probably  been better explored than any other continent so far as Spongillidae are  concerned, only twenty-seven or twenty-eight species have been recorded.    The Indian species fall into seven genera, one of which (_Spongilla_)  consists of three subgenera. With one exception (that of  _Pectispongilla_, which has only been found in Southern India) these  genera have a wide distribution over the earth's surface, and this is  also the case as regards the subgenera of Spongilla. Four genera  (_Heteromeyenia_, _Acalle_, _Parmula_, and _Uruguaya_) that have not yet  been found in India are known to exist elsewhere.    Five of the Indian species are known to occur in Europe, viz.,  _Spongilla lacustris_, _S. crateriformis_, _S. carteri_, _S. fragilis_,  _Trochospongilla pennsylvanica_; while _Ephydatia meyeni_ is  intermediate between the two commonest representatives of its genus in  the Holarctic Zone, _Ephydatia fluviatilis_ and _E. muelleri_. Of the  species that occur both in India and in Europe, two (_Spongilla  lacustris_ and _S. fragilis_) are found in this country in forms  sufficiently distinct to be regarded as subspecies or local races.  Perhaps this course should also be taken as regards the Indian forms of  _S. carteri_, of which, however, the commonest of the Indian races would  be the typical one; but _S. crateriformis_ and _T. pennsylvanica_ seem  to preserve their specific characters free from modification, whether  they are found in Europe, Asia, or America.    The freshwater sponges of Africa have been comparatively little studied,  but two Indian species have been discovered, _S. bombayensis_ in Natal  and _S. alba_ var. _cerebellata_ in Egypt. Several of the species from  the Malabar Zone are, moreover, closely allied to African forms (p. 11).      FOSSIL SPONGILLIDAE.    The Spongillidae are an ancient family. Young described a species  (_Spongilla purbeckensis_) from the Upper Jurassic of Dorset (Geol. Mag.  London (new series) v, p. 220 (1878)), while spicules, assigned by  Ehrenberg to various genera but actually those of _Spongilla lacustris_  or allied forms, have been found in the Miocene of Bohemia (see  Ehrenberg's 'Atlas fuer Micro-Geologie,' pl. xi (Leipzig, 1854), and  Traxler in Foeldt. Koezl., Budapest, 1895, p. 211). _Ephydatia_ is also  known in a fossil condition, but is probably less ancient than  _Spongilla_.    Ehrenberg found many sponge spicules in earth from various parts of the  Indian Empire (including Baluchistan, Mangalore, Calcutta, the Nicobars  and Nepal) and elsewhere, and it might be possible to guess at the  identity of some of the more conspicuous species figured in his 'Atlas.'  The identification of sponges from isolated spicules is, however, always  a matter of doubt, and in some cases Ehrenberg probably assigned  spicules belonging to entirely different families or even orders to the  same genus, while he frequently attributed the different spicules of the  same species to different genera. Among his fossil (or supposed fossil)  genera that may be assigned to the Spongillidae wholly or in part are  _Aphidiscus_, _Spongolithis_, _Lithastericus_ and _Lithosphaeridium_,  many of the species of these \"genera\" certainly belonging to _Spongilla_  and _Ephydatia_.      ORIENTAL SPONGILLIDAE NOT YET FOUND IN INDIA.    Few freshwater sponges that have not been found in India are as yet  known from the Oriental Region, and there is positive as well as  negative evidence that Spongillidae are less abundant in Malaysia than in  this country. The following list includes the names of those that have  been found, with notes regarding each species. It is quite possible that  any one of them may be found at any time within the geographical  boundaries laid down for this 'Fauna.' I have examined types or co-types  in all cases except that of _Ephydatia fortis_, Weltner.    I. _Spongilla_ (_Euspongilla_) _microsclerifera_*, Annandale  (Philippines). P. U.S. Mus. xxxvii, p. 131 (1909).    This sponge is closely related to _S. lacustris_, but apparently does  not produce branches. It is remarkable for the enormous number of  microscleres in its parenchyma.    II. _S._ (_Euspongilla_) _philippinensis_*, Annandale (Philippines). P.  U.S. Mus. xxxvi, p. 629 (1909).    Related to _S. alba_ and still more closely to _S. sceptrioides_ of  Australia. From the former it is readily distinguished by having  minutely spined megascleres, green corpuscles, slender gemmule-spicules  with short spines and no free microscleres.    III. _S._ (? _Euspongilla_) _yunnanensis_*, Annandale (W. China). Rec.  Ind. Mus. v, p. 197 (1910).    Apparently allied to _S. philippinensis_ but with smooth  skeleton-spicules and a more delicate skeleton.    IV. _S._ (_Stratospongilla_) _sinensis_*, Annandale (Foochow, China). P.  U.S. Mus. xxxviii, p. 183 (1910).    This species and _S. clementis_ are referred to _Stratospongilla_ with  some doubt. Their gemmules are intermediate in structure between those  of that subgenus and those of _Euspongilla_.  In _S. sinensis_ the  gemmules are packed together in groups at the base of the sponge, and  their spicules are smooth, stout, and gradually pointed.

A white form from the tent,--a glance,--a cry.      Where art thou, Theseus?--Theseus! Theseus! where?      Why hast thou stolen thus with earliest dawn,      Forth from thy couch--forth from these faithless arms,      That even in slumber should have clasped thee still!      Truant! ah me! and hast thou learnt to fly      So early from thy Ariadne's love!      Where art thou? Is it well to fright me thus,----      To scare me for a moment with the dread      Of one abandoned! Art thou in the woods      With all that could have told me where thou art!      Cruel! and couldst thou not have left me one,      Ere this to have laughed away my idle fears!      He could have told thee all--the start--the shriek----      The pallid face, with which I found thee gone,      And furnished laughter for thy glad return;      But thus! to leave me, cruel! thus alone!      There is no sound of horns among the hills,      No shouts that tell they track or bay the boar.      O fearful stillness! O that one would speak!      O would that I were fronting wolf or pard      But by thy side this moment! so strange fear      Possesses me, O love! apart from thee;      The galley? gone? Ye Gods! is it not gone?      Here, by this rock it lay but yesternight.      Gone! through this track its keel slid down by the shore;      And I slept calmly as it cleft the sea.      Gone? gone? where gone?--that sail! 'tis his! 'tis his!      Return, O Theseus! Theseus! love! return!      Thou wilt return. Thou dost but try my love?      Thou wilt return to make my foolish fears      Thy jest. Return, and I will laugh with thee!      Return! return! and canst thou hear my shrieks,      Nor heed my cry! And wouldst thou have me weep,      Weep! I that wept--white with wild fear--the while      Thou slew'st the abhorred monster! If it be      Thou takest pleasure in these bitter tears,      Come back, and I will weep myself away----      A streaming Niobe--to win thy smiles!      O stony heart! why wilt thou wring me thus!      O heart more cold unto my shrilling cries      Than these wild hills that wail to thee, return,      Than all these island rocks that shriek, return.      Come back! Thou seest me rend this blinding hair;      Hast thou not sworn each tress thou didst so prize,      That sight of home, and thy gray father's face,      Were less a joy to thee, and lightlier held!      Thy sail! thy sail! O do my watery eyes      Take part with thee, so loved! to crush me down!        Gone! Gone! and wilt thou--wilt thou not return?      Heartless, unfearing the just Gods, wilt thou,      Theseus! my lord! my love! desert me thus!      Thus leave me, stranger in this strange wild land,      Friendless, afar from all I left for thee,      Crete, my old home, and my ancestral halls,      My father's love, and the remembered haunts      Of childhood,--all that knew me--all I knew----      All--all--woe! woe! that I shall know no more.      Why didst thou lure me, craftiest, from my home?      There if, thy love grown cold, thou thus hadst fled,      I had found comfort in fond word and smiles      Familiar, and the pity of my kin,      Tears wept with mine--tears wept by loving eyes,      That had washed out thy traces from my heart,      Perchance, in years, had given me back to joy.      O that thy steps had never trodden Crete!      O that these eyes had never on thee fed!      O that, weak heart! I ne'er had looked my love.      Or looking, thou hadst thrust it back with hate!      Did I not save thee? I? was it for this,      Despite Crete's hate--despite my father's wrath,      Perchance to slay me, that I ventured all      For thee--for thee--forgetting all for thee!      Thou know'st it all,--who knows it if not thou,      Save the just Gods--the Gods who hear my cry,      And mutter vengeance o'er thy flying head,      Forsworn! And, lo! on thy accused track      Rush the dread furies; lo! afar I see      The hoary AEgeus, watching for his son,      His son that nears him still with hastening oars,      Unknown, that nears him but to dash him down,      Moaning, to darkness and the dreadful shades      The while, thy grief wails after him in vain:      And, lo, again the good Gods glad my sight      With vengeance; blood again, thy blood, I see      Streaming;--who bids Hippolytus depart      But thou--thou, sword of lustful Phaedra's hate      Against thy boy--thy son--thy fair-haired boy;      I see the ivory chariot whirl him on----      The maddened horses down the rocky way      Dashing--the roaring monster in their path;      And plates and ivory splinters of the car,      And blood and limbs, sprung from thee, crushed and torn,      Poseidon scatters down the shrieking shores;      And thou too late--too late, bewail'st in vain.      Thy blindness and thy hapless darling's fate.      And think'st of me, abandoned, and my woe;      Thou who didst show no pity, to the Gods      Shrieking for pity, that my vengeful cries      Drag thee not down unto the nether gloom,      To endless tortures and undying woe.      Dread Gods! I know these things shall surely be!      But other, wilder whispers throng my ears,      And in my thought a fountain of sweet hope      Mingles its gladness with my lorn despair.      Lo! wild flushed faces reel before mine eyes.      And furious revels, dances, and fierce glee,      Are round me,--tossing arms and leaping forms.      Skin-clad and horny-hoofed, and hands that clash      Shrill cymbals, and the stormy joy of flutes      And horns, and blare of trumpets, and all hues      Of Iris' watery bow, on bounding nymphs,      Vine-crowned and thyrsus-sceptred, and one form,      God of the roaring triumph, on a car      Golden and jewel-lustred, carved and bossed,      As by Hephaestus, shouting, rolls, along,      Jocund and panther-drawn, and through the sun,      Down, through the glaring splendor, with wild bound,      Leaps, as he nears me, and a mighty cup,      Dripping, with odorous nectar, to my lips      Is raised, and mad sweet mirth--frenzy divine      Is in my veins--hot love burns through mine eyes,      And o'er the roar and rout I roll along,      Throned by the God, and lifted by his love      Unto forgetfulness of mortal pains,      Up to the prayers and praise and awe of earth.                                          W. C. B.    FOOTNOTES:    [8] By the kindness of a friend these fine poems are printed for the first  time in _The International Magazine_.          A STORY WITHOUT A NAME.[9]    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE    BY G. P. R. JAMES, ESQ.      CHAPTER XLII.    Mrs. Hazleton was an observer of all small particulars. On the present  occasion she had been kept alone fully ten minutes in the drawing-room, and  she was not at all pleased with this want of alacrity. Though her face was  as smooth as ever when she entered the sick room, she saw that a change of  feeling, or at least a change of purpose, had taken place, and that Lady  Hastings felt embarrassed by a consciousness which she might not choose to  communicate. But success had made her bold, and she loved to steer her  course through agitated waters.    \"Well, my dear friend,\" she said, with the sweet tones of her voice falling  from her lips like drops of liquid honey, \"you do not seem quite so well  to-day. I hope this business which you were to undertake has not agitated  you. Or perhaps you have not executed your intention. It could be very well  put off until you are better.\"    This was intended to lead to confession; she suspected some shame at a want  of resolution. But Lady Hastings remained silent, playing with her rings,  and Mrs. Hazleton, a little angry--but very little--gave her one of those  delightful little scratches which she was practised in administering,  saying, \"No one knew any thing about your intentions but myself; so no one  can accuse you of weakness or vacillation.\"    \"I care very little,\" said Lady Hastings, most untruly, \"of what people  accuse me. I shall of course form my own resolutions from what I know, and  execute them or not, dear Mrs. Hazleton, according to circumstances--which  are ever changing. What is inexpedient one day may be quite expedient the  next.\"    Now, no one was more fully aware than Mrs. Hazleton that expediency is  always the argument of weak minds, and that changing circumstances afford  every day fair excuses to men and to multitudes for every kind of weakness  under the sun. Her belief was strengthened that Lady Hastings had not acted  as she had promised her to act, and she replied, with an easy, quiet,  half-pitying smile, \"Well, it is not of the slightest consequence whether  you do it now, or a week hence, or not at all. The worst that could come  would be Emily's marriage with Marlow, and if you do not care about it, who  should? I take it for granted, of course, that you have not acted in the  matter so boldly and decidedly as we proposed.\"    There was an implied superiority in Mrs. Hazleton's words and manner which  Lady Hastings did not like. It roused and elevated her, and she replied,  somewhat sharply, \"You are quite mistaken, my dear friend; I did all that  was ever intended. I sent for Emily and my husband, told them that I  believed I should not live long, and made it my last request that the  engagement with Marlow should be broken off.\"    \"Indeed!\" exclaimed Mrs. Hazleton, with even too much eagerness. \"What did  they say? Did they consent?\"    \"Far from it,\" answered Lady Hastings. \"My husband said he had made a  promise which he could not violate on any account or consideration  whatever, and Emily was much in the same story.\"    \"That shows that your decision was not strongly enough expressed,\" replied  her visitor. \"I do not believe"]]]
