The admission of  California was a bitter pill for the Southern ultras, but they were  forced to take it. The Fugitive Slave Law was a taunt and a reproach to  that part of the North where the anti-slavery sentiment ruled supremely,  and was deemed a partial compensation.\" Clay expressed surprise that  States from which few slaves escaped demanded a more stringent law than  Kentucky, from which many escaped.    Whatever may have been the motives leading to the enactment, its  immediate effect was the elimination of one of the great national  parties, thus paving the way for the formation of parties along  sectional lines. Two years after the passage of the compromise acts the  Democratic national convention assembled to nominate a candidate for  the Presidency. The platform adopted by the party promised a faithful  execution of the acts known as the compromise measures and added \"the  act for reclaiming fugitives from service or labor included; which act,  being designed to carry out an express provision of the Constitution,  cannot, with fidelity thereto, be repealed nor so changed as to destroy  or impair its efficiency.\" When this was read, the convention broke out  in uproarious applause. Then there was a demand that it should be read  again. Again there was loud applause.    Why was there this demand that a law which every one knew had proved a  complete failure should be made a permanent part of the Constitution?  And why the ungovernable hilarity over the demand that its \"efficiency\"  should never be impaired? Surely the motive was something other than a  desire to recover lost property. Upon the Whig party had been fastened  the odium for the enactment of the law, and the act unrepealed meant the  death of the party. The Democrats saw good reason for laughter.        CHAPTER VIII. THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD    Wherever there are slaves there are fugitives if there is an available  place of refuge. The wilds of Florida were such a refuge during the  early part of last century. When the Northern States became free,  fugitive slaves began to escape thither, and Canada, when it could be  reached, was, of course, the goal of perfect security and liberty for  all.    A professed object of the early anti-slavery societies was to prevent  the enslavement of free negroes and in other ways to protect their  rights. During the process of emancipation in Northern States large  numbers of colored persons were spirited off to the South and sold into  slavery. At various places along the border there were those who made  it their duty to guard the rights of negroes and to prevent kidnapping.  These guardians of the border furnished a nucleus for the development of  what was later known as the Underground Railroad.    In 1796 President Washington wrote a letter to a friend in New Hampshire  with reference to obtaining the return of a negro servant. He was  careful to state that the servant should remain unmolested rather than  \"excite a mob or riot or even uneasy sensations in the minds of well  disposed citizens.\" The result was that the servant remained free.  President Washington here assumed that \"well disposed citizens\" would  oppose her return to slavery. Three years earlier the President had  himself signed a bill to facilitate by legal process the return of  fugitives escaping into other States. He was certainly aware that such  an act was on the statute books when he wrote his request to his friend  in New Hampshire, yet he expected that, if an attempt were made to  remove the refugee by force, riot and resistance by a mob would be the  result.    Not until after the foreign slave-trade had been prohibited and the  domestic trade had been developed, and not until there was a pro-slavery  reaction in the South which banished from the slave States all  anti-slavery propaganda, did the systematic assistance rendered  to fugitive slaves assume any large proportions or arouse bitter  resentment. It began in the late twenties and early thirties of  the nineteenth century, extended with the spread of anti-slavery  organization, and was greatly encouraged and stimulated by the enactment  of the law of 1850.    The Underground Railroad was never coextensive with the abolition  movement. There were always abolitionists who disapproved the practice  of assisting fugitives, and others who took no part in it. Of those  who were active participants, the larger proportion confined their  activities to assisting those who had escaped and would take no part in  seeking to induce slaves to leave their masters. Efforts of that kind  were limited to a few individuals only.    Incidents drawn from the reminiscences of Levi Coffin, the reputed  president of the Underground Railroad, may serve to illustrate the  origin and growth of the system. He was seven years old when he first  saw near his home in North Carolina a coffle of slaves being driven to  the Southern market by a man on horseback with a long whip. \"The driver  was some distance behind with the wagon. My father addressed the slaves  pleasantly and then asked, 'Well, boys, why do they chain you?' One  of the men whose countenance betrayed unusual intelligence and whose  expression denoted the deepest sadness replied: 'They have taken us from  our wives and children and they chain us lest we should make our escape  and go back to them.\"' When Coffin was fifteen, he rendered assistance  to a man in bondage. Having an opportunity to talk with the members of a  gang in the hands of a trader bound for the Southern market, he learned  that one of the company, named Stephen, was a freeman who had been  kidnapped and sold. Letters were written to Northern friends of Stephen  who confirmed his assertion. Money was raised in the Quaker meeting and  men were sent to recover the negro. Stephen was found in Georgia and  after six months was liberated.    During the year 1821 other incidents occurred in the Quaker community at  New Garden, near Greensboro, North Carolina, which illustrate different  phases of the subject. Jack Barnes was the slave of a bachelor who  became so greatly attached to his servant that he bequeathed to him  not only his freedom but also a large share of his property. Relatives  instituted measures to break the will, and Jack in alarm took refuge  among the Quakers at New Garden. The suit went against the negro, and  the newspapers contained advertisements offering a hundred dollars for  information which should result in his recovery. To prevent his return  to bondage, it was decided that Jack should join a family of Coffins who  were moving to Indiana.    At the same time a negro by the name of Sam had for several months been  abiding in the Quaker neighborhood. He belonged to a Mr. Osborne, a  prototype of Simon Legree, who was so notoriously cruel that other  slave-owners assisted in protecting his victims. After the Coffins, with  Jack, had been on the road for a few days, Osborne learned that a negro  was with them and, feeling sure that it was his Sam, he started in hot  haste after them. This becoming known to the Friends, young Levi Coffin  was sent after Osborne to forestall disaster. The descriptions given of  Jack and Sam were practically identical and it was surmised that when  Osborne should overtake the party and discover his mistake, he would  seize Jack for the sake of the offered reward. Coffin soon came up with  Osborne and decided to ride with him for a time to learn his plans.  In the course of their conversation, it was finally agreed that Coffin  should assist in the recovery of Sam. Osborne was also generous and  insisted that if it proved to be the other \"nigger\" who was with the  company, Coffin should have half the reward. How the young Quaker  outwitted the tyrant, gained his point, sent Jack on his way to liberty,  and at the same time retained the confidence of Osborne so that upon  their return home he was definitely engaged to assist Osborne in finding  Sam, is a fascinating story. The abolitionist won from the slaveholder  the doubtful compliment that \"there was not a man in that neighborhood  worth a d--n to help him hunt his negro except young Levi Coffin.\"    Sam was perfectly safe so long as Levi Coffin was guide for the  hunting-party, but matters were becoming desperate. For the fugitive  something had to be done. Another family was planning to move to  Indiana, and in their wagon Sam was to be concealed and thus conveyed to  a free State. The business had now become serious. The laws of the State  affixed the death penalty for stealing a slave. At night when young  Coffin and his father, with Sam, were on their way to complete  arrangements for the departure, horsemen appeared in the road near by.  They had only time to throw themselves flat on the ground behind a  log. From the conversation overheard, they were assured that they had  narrowly escaped the night-riders on the lookout for stray negroes. The  next year, 1822, Coffin himself joined a party going to Indiana by the  southern route through Tennessee and Kentucky. In the latter State they  were at one time overtaken by men who professed to be looking for a pet  dog, but whose real purpose was to recover runaway slaves. They insisted  upon examining the contents of the wagons, for in this way only a short  time previous a fugitive had been captured.    These incidents show the origin of the system. The first case of  assistance rendered a negro was not in itself illegal, but was intended  merely to prevent the crime of kidnapping. The second was illegal in  form, but the aid was given to one who, having been set free by will,  was being reenslaved, it was believed, by an unjust decision of a court.  The third was a case of outrageous abuse on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30396"],[0,"Books and Authors (#14)"],[1,"nks, and water drinks,      Is never worth a dump:    Then fill your cup, and drink it up,      May he be made a pump.\"           *       *       *       *       *      DANGEROUS FOOLS.    Sydney Smith writes:--If men are to be fools, it were better that they  were fools in little matters than in great; dulness, turned up with  temerity, is a livery all the worse for the facings; and the most  tremendous of all things is a magnanimous dunce.           *       *       *       *       *      BULWER'S POMPEIAN DRAWING-ROOM.    In 1841, the author of _Pelham_ lived in Charles-street, Berkeley-square,  in a small house, which he fitted up after his own taste; and an odd  _melee_ of the classic and the baronial certain of the rooms presented.  One of the drawing-rooms, we remember, was in the Elizabethan style,  with an imitative oak ceiling, bristled with pendents; and this room  opened into another apartment, a fac-simile of a chamber which Bulwer  had visited at Pompeii, with vases, candelabra, and other furniture to  correspond.    James Smith has left a few notes of his visit here: \"Our host,\" he says,  \"lighted a perfumed pastile, modelled from Vesuvius. As soon as the  cone of the mountain began to blaze, I found myself an inhabitant of  the devoted city; and, as Pliny the elder, thus addressed Bulwer, my  supposed nephew:--'Our fate is accomplished, nephew! Hand me yonder  volume! I shall die as a student in my vocation. Do thou hasten to take  refuge on board the fleet at Misenum. Yonder cloud of hot ashes chides  thy longer delay. Feel no alarm for me; I shall live in story. The author  of _Pelham_ will rescue my name from oblivion.' Pliny the younger made  me a low bow, &c.\" We strongly suspect James of quizzing \"our host.\"  He noted, by the way, in the chamber were the busts of Hebe, Laura,  Petrarch, Dante, and other worthies; Laura like our Queen.           *       *       *       *       *      STERNE'S SERMONS.    Sterne's sermons are, in general, very short, which circumstance gave  rise to the following joke at Bull's Library, at Bath:--A footman had  been sent by his lady to purchase one of Smallridge's sermons, when, by  mistake, he asked for a _small religious_ sermon. The bookseller being  puzzled how to reply to his request, a gentleman present suggested,  \"Give him one of Sterne's.\"    It has been observed, that if Sterne had never written one line more  than his picture of the mournful cottage, towards the conclusion of his  fifth sermon, we might cheerfully indulge the devout hope that the  recording angel, whom he once invoked, will have blotted out many of  his imperfections.           *       *       *       *       *      \"TOM HILL.\"    A few days before the close of 1840, London lost one of its choicest  spirits, and humanity one of her kindest-hearted sons, in the death of  Thomas Hill, Esq.--\"Tom Hill,\" as he was called by all who loved and  knew him. His life exemplified one venerable proverb, and disproved  another; he was born in May, 1760, and was, consequently, in his 81st  year, and \"as old as the hills;\" having led a long life and a merry one.  He was originally a drysalter; but about the year 1810, having sustained  a severe loss by a speculation in indigo, he retired upon the remains of  his property to chambers in the Adelphi, where he died; his physician  remarking to him, \"I can do no more for you--I have done all I can. I  cannot cure age.\"    Hill, when in business at the unlettered Queenhithe, found leisure  to accumulate a fine collection of books, chiefly old poetry, which  afterwards, when misfortune overtook him, was valued at 6000_l._ Hill  was likewise a Maecenas: he patronized two friendless poets, Bloomfield  and Kirke White. The _Farmer's Boy_ of the former was read and admired  by him in manuscript, and was recommended to a publisher. Hill also  established _The Monthly Mirror_, to which Kirke White was a contributor.  Hill was the Hull of Hook's _Gilbert Gurney_. He happened to know  everything that was going on in all circles; and was at all \"private  views\" of exhibitions. So especially was he favoured, that a wag recorded,  when asked whether he had seen the new comet, he replied--\"Pooh! pooh! I  was present at the private view.\"    Hill left behind him an assemblage of literary rarities, which it  occupied a clear week to sell by auction. Among them was Garrick's cup,  formed from the mulberry tree planted by Shakespeare in his garden at  New Place, Stratford-upon-Avon; this produced forty guineas. A small  vase and pedestal, carved from the same mulberry-tree, and presented to  Garrick, was sold with a coloured drawing of it, for ten guineas. And a  block of wood, cut from the celebrated willow planted by Pope, at his  villa at Twickenham, brought one guinea.           *       *       *       *       *      TYCHO BRAHE'S NOSE.    Sir David Brewster relates that in the year 1566, an accident occurred  to Tycho Brahe, at Wittenberg, which had nearly deprived him of his  life. On the 10th of December, Tycho had a quarrel with a noble  countryman, Manderupius Rasbergius, and they parted ill friends. On the  27th of the same month, they met again; and having renewed their  quarrel, they agreed to settle their differences by the sword. They  accordingly met at seven o'clock in the evening of the 29th, and fought  in total darkness. In this blind combat, Manderupius cut off the whole  of the front of Tycho's nose, and it was fortunate for astronomy that  his more valuable organs were defended by so faithful an outpost. The  quarrel, which is said to have originated in a difference of opinion  respecting their mathematical attainments, terminated here; and Tycho  repaired his loss by cementing upon his face a nose of gold and silver,  which is said to have formed a good imitation of the original. Thus,  Tycho was, indeed, a \"Martyr of Science.\"           *       *       *       *       *      FOOTE'S WOODEN LEG.    George Colman, the younger, notes:--\"There is no Shakspeare or Roscius  upon record who, like Foote, supported a theatre for a series of years  by his own acting, in his own writings; and for ten years of the time,  upon a wooden leg! This prop to his person I once saw standing by his  bedside, ready dressed in a handsome silk stocking, with a polished  shoe and gold buckle, awaiting the owner's getting up: it had a kind of  tragic, comical appearance, and I leave to inveterate wags the ingenuity  of punning upon a Foote in bed, and a leg out of it. The proxy for a  limb thus decorated, though ludicrous, is too strong a reminder of  amputation to be very laughable. His undressed supporter was the  common wooden stick, which was not a little injurious to a well-kept  pleasure-ground. I remember following him after a shower of rain, upon  a nicely rolled terrace, in which he stumped a deep round hole at every  other step he took, till it appeared as if the gardener had been there  with his dibble, preparing, against all horticultural practice, to plant  a long row of cabbages in a gravel walk.\"           *       *       *       *       *      RIVAL REMEMBRANCE.    _Mr. Gifford to Mr. Hazlitt._     \"What we read from your pen, we remember no   more.\"    _Mr. Hazlitt to Mr. Gifford._     \"What we read from your pen, we remember before.\"           *       *       *       *       *      WHO WROTE \"JUNIUS'S LETTERS\"?    This question has not yet been satisfactorily answered. In 1812, Dr.  Mason Good, in an essay he wrote on the question, passed in review all  the persons who had then been suspected of writing these celebrated  letters. They are, Charles Lloyd and John Roberts, originally treasury  clerks; Samuel Dyer, a learned man, and a friend of Burke and Johnson;  William Gerard Hamilton, familiarly known as \"Single-speech Hamilton;\"  Mr. Burke; Dr. Butler, late Bishop of Hereford; the Rev. Philip  Rosenhagen; Major-General Lee, who went over to the Americans, and took  an active part in their contest with the mother-country; John Wilkes;  Hugh Macaulay Boyd; John Dunning, Lord Ashburton; Henry Flood; and Lord  George Sackville.    Since this date, in 1813, John Roche published an Inquiry, in which he  persuaded himself that Burke was the author. In the same year there  appeared three other publications on Junius: these were, the Attempt of  the Rev. J. B. Blakeway, to trace them to John Horne Tooke; next were  the \"Facts\" of Thomas Girdlestone, M.D., to prove that General Lee was  the author; and, thirdly, a work put forth by Mrs. Olivia Wilmot Serres,  in the following confident terms:--\"Life of the Author of _Junius's  Letters_,--the Rev. J. Wilmot, D.D., Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford;\"  and, like most bold attempts, this work attracted some notice and  discussion.    In 1815, the Letters were attributed to Richard Glover, the poet of  _Leonidas_; and this improbable idea was followed by another, assigning  the authorship of the Letters to the Duke of Portland, in 1816. In the  same year appeared \"Arguments and Facts,\" to show that John Louis de  Lolme, author of the famous Essay on the Constitution of England, was  the writer of these anonymous epistles. In 1816, too, appeared Mr.  John Taylor's \"Junius Identified,\" advocating the claims of Sir Philip  Francis so successfully that the question was generally considered to  be settled. Mr. Taylor's opinion was supported by Edward Dubois, Esq.,  formerly the confidential friend and private secretary of Sir Philip,  who, in common with Lady Francis, constantly entertained the conviction  that his deceased patron was identical with Junius.    In 1817, George Chalmers, F.S.A., advocated the pretensions of Hugh  Macaulay Boyd to the authorship of Junius. In 1825, Mr. George Coventry  maintained with great ability that Lord George Sackville was Junius; and  two writers in America adopted this theory.    Thus was the whole question re-opened; and, in 1828, Mr. E. H. Barker,  of Thetford, refuted the"]]]
