But  where was I, when I was seeking Thee? And Thou wert before me, but I had  gone away from Thee; nor did I find myself, how much less Thee!    I would lay open before my God that nine-and-twentieth year of mine  age. There had then come to Carthage a certain Bishop of the Manichees,  Faustus by name, a great snare of the Devil, and many were entangled  by him through that lure of his smooth language: which though I did  commend, yet could I separate from the truth of the things which I was  earnest to learn: nor did I so much regard the service of oratory as the  science which this Faustus, so praised among them, set before me to  feed upon. Fame had before bespoken him most knowing in all valuable  learning, and exquisitely skilled in the liberal sciences. And since I  had read and well remembered much of the philosophers, I compared some  things of theirs with those long fables of the Manichees, and found the  former the more probable; even although they could only prevail so far  as to make judgment of this lower world, the Lord of it they could by  no means find out. For Thou art great, O Lord, and hast respect unto the  humble, but the proud Thou beholdest afar off. Nor dost Thou draw near,  but to the contrite in heart, nor art found by the proud, no, not though  by curious skill they could number the stars and the sand, and measure  the starry heavens, and track the courses of the planets.    For with their understanding and wit, which Thou bestowedst on them,  they search out these things; and much have they found out; and  foretold, many years before, eclipses of those luminaries, the sun  and moon,--what day and hour, and how many digits,--nor did their  calculation fail; and it came to pass as they foretold; and they wrote  down the rules they had found out, and these are read at this day, and  out of them do others foretell in what year and month of the year, and  what day of the month, and what hour of the day, and what part of its  light, moon or sun is to be eclipsed, and so it shall be, as it is  foreshowed. At these things men, that know not this art, marvel and are  astonished, and they that know it, exult, and are puffed up; and by  an ungodly pride departing from Thee, and failing of Thy light, they  foresee a failure of the sun's light, which shall be, so long before,  but see not their own, which is. For they search not religiously whence  they have the wit, wherewith they search out this. And finding that Thou  madest them, they give not themselves up to Thee, to preserve what Thou  madest, nor sacrifice to Thee what they have made themselves; nor slay  their own soaring imaginations, as fowls of the air, nor their own  diving curiosities (wherewith, like the fishes of the sea, they wander  over the unknown paths of the abyss), nor their own luxuriousness, as  beasts of the field, that Thou, Lord, a consuming fire, mayest burn up  those dead cares of theirs, and re-create themselves immortally.    But they knew not the way, Thy Word, by Whom Thou madest these things  which they number, and themselves who number, and the sense whereby  they perceive what they number, and the understanding, out of which they  number; or that of Thy wisdom there is no number. But the Only Begotten  is Himself made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification,  and was numbered among us, and paid tribute unto Caesar. They knew not  this way whereby to descend to Him from themselves, and by Him ascend  unto Him. They knew not this way, and deemed themselves exalted amongst  the stars and shining; and behold, they fell upon the earth, and their  foolish heart was darkened. They discourse many things truly concerning  the creature; but Truth, Artificer of the creature, they seek not  piously, and therefore find Him not; or if they find Him, knowing Him  to be God, they glorify Him not as God, neither are thankful, but  become vain in their imaginations, and profess themselves to be wise,  attributing to themselves what is Thine; and thereby with most perverse  blindness, study to impute to Thee what is their own, forging lies of  Thee who art the Truth, and changing the glory of uncorruptible God  into an image made like corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed  beasts, and creeping things, changing Thy truth into a lie, and  worshipping and serving the creature more than the Creator.    Yet many truths concerning the creature retained I from these men, and  saw the reason thereof from calculations, the succession of times, and  the visible testimonies of the stars; and compared them with the saying  of Manichaeus, which in his frenzy he had written most largely on these  subjects; but discovered not any account of the solstices, or equinoxes,  or the eclipses of the greater lights, nor whatever of this sort I  had learned in the books of secular philosophy. But I was commanded to  believe; and yet it corresponded not with what had been established by  calculations and my own sight, but was quite contrary.    Doth then, O Lord God of truth, whoso knoweth these things, therefore  please Thee? Surely unhappy is he who knoweth all these, and knoweth not  Thee: but happy whoso knoweth Thee, though he know not these. And whoso  knoweth both Thee and them is not the happier for them, but for Thee  only, if, knowing Thee, he glorifies Thee as God, and is thankful, and  becomes not vain in his imaginations. For as he is better off who knows  how to possess a tree, and return thanks to Thee for the use thereof,  although he know not how many cubits high it is, or how wide it spreads,  than he that can measure it, and count all its boughs, and neither owns  it, nor knows or loves its Creator: so a believer, whose all this world  of wealth is, and who having nothing, yet possesseth all things, by  cleaving unto Thee, whom all things serve, though he know not even  the circles of the Great Bear, yet is it folly to doubt but he is in a  better state than one who can measure the heavens, and number the stars,  and poise the elements, yet neglecteth Thee who hast made all things in  number, weight, and measure.    But yet who bade that Manichaeus write on these things also, skill in  which was no element of piety? For Thou hast said to man, Behold  piety and wisdom; of which he might be ignorant, though he had perfect  knowledge of these things; but these things, since, knowing not, he most  impudently dared to teach, he plainly could have no knowledge of piety.  For it is vanity to make profession of these worldly things even when  known; but confession to Thee is piety. Wherefore this wanderer to this  end spake much of these things, that convicted by those who had truly  learned them, it might be manifest what understanding he had in the  other abstruser things. For he would not have himself meanly thought of,  but went about to persuade men, \"That the Holy Ghost, the Comforter and  Enricher of Thy faithful ones, was with plenary authority personally  within him.\" When then he was found out to have taught falsely of the  heaven and stars, and of the motions of the sun and moon (although these  things pertain not to the doctrine of religion), yet his sacrilegious  presumption would become evident enough, seeing he delivered things  which not only he knew not, but which were falsified, with so mad a  vanity of pride, that he sought to ascribe them to himself, as to a  divine person.    For when I hear any Christian brother ignorant of these things, and  mistaken on them, I can patiently behold such a man holding his opinion;  nor do I see that any ignorance as to the position or character of the  corporeal creation can injure him, so long as he doth not believe any  thing unworthy of Thee, O Lord, the Creator of all. But it doth injure  him, if he imagine it to pertain to the form of the doctrine of piety,  and will yet affirm that too stiffly whereof he is ignorant. And yet  is even such an infirmity, in the infancy of faith, borne by our mother  Charity, till the new-born may grow up unto a perfect man, so as not  to be carried about with every wind of doctrine. But in him who in such  wise presumed to be the teacher, source, guide, chief of all whom he  could so persuade, that whoso followed him thought that he followed,  not a mere man, but Thy Holy Spirit; who would not judge that so great  madness, when once convicted of having taught any thing false, were  to be detested and utterly rejected? But I had not as yet clearly  ascertained whether the vicissitudes of longer and shorter days and  nights, and of day and night itself, with the eclipses of the greater  lights, and whatever else of the kind I had read of in other books,  might be explained consistently with his sayings; so that, if they by  any means might, it should still remain a question to me whether it  were so or no; but I might, on account of his reputed sanctity, rest my  credence upon his authority.    And for almost all those nine years, wherein with unsettled mind I had  been their disciple, I had longed but too intensely for the coming of  this Faustus. For the rest of the sect, whom by chance I had lighted  upon, when unable to solve my objections about these things, still held  out to me the coming of this Faustus, by conference with whom these  and greater difficulties, if I had them, were to be most readily and  abundantly cleared. When then he came, I found him a man of pleasing  discourse, and who could speak fluently and in better terms, yet still  but the self-same things which they were wont to say. But what availed  the utmost neatness of the cup-bearer to my thirst for a more precious  draught? Mine ears were already cloyed with the like, nor did they seem  to me therefore better, because better said; nor therefore true, because  eloquent; nor the soul therefore wise, because the face was comely,  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32982"],[0,"Student's Hand-book of Mushrooms of America, Edible and Poisonous (#14)"],[1,"of  garden soil sifted over the surface of the bed. Tamp the bed surface  gently with the back of a spade. Mushrooms may be expected for table use  in about six or seven weeks, provided the spawn is good and the  temperature has not fallen below 50 F. In outdoor culture the beds must  be well covered with straw or canvas, and had better be under a shed  roof with southern exposure.    The spawn used by this grower is the \"brick\" spawn, imported from Carter  & Holborn, London, England.      CULTIVATION OF MUSHROOMS IN JAPAN.    The Japanese are very successful in cultivating a mushroom which they  call \"Shiitake\" or \"Lepiota shiitake.\" China also produces the same  mushroom, but of an inferior quality. The Chinese therefore prefer the  mushroom cultivated by the Japanese, which they import from Japan in  large quantities. It is cultivated on a variety of trees, but is said to  grow best on the \"Shiinoki,\" a species of oak (Quercus cuspidata).    There are three varieties of \"Shiitake,\" the spring, summer, and autumn  crops differing somewhat in quality. The method of growing the  \"Shiitake\" is given by the Japanese Commissioner of Agriculture as  follows:    \"Trees of from twenty to fifty years' growth are cut down at the  approach of winter when the sap has ceased to run, and after the lapse  of twenty or thirty days, according to the condition of the drying of  the wood, are sawed into logs of 4 or 5 feet in length. Into each of  these logs incisions are made with a hatchet, at intervals of about 6  inches, and they are piled regularly upon a frame-work erected at a  height of about 1 foot above the ground, under the trees. The location  of the ground selected for piling the logs should be the slopes of a  forest, facing southeast or southwest. After keeping the logs as above  described for from two to three years, they are immersed in water for  twenty-four hours in the middle of November, and again laid one upon  another for about four days; if it is in a cold district, the pile is  covered with straw or mats. At the expiration of the fourth day the logs  are obliquely tilted against poles fixed horizontally to the trees at a  height of about 4 feet in a well-ventilated and sunny situation. The  mushrooms soon appear in quantity, and, after twenty or thirty days'  growth, are ready for harvesting.\"    Recent reports of the Japanese Agricultural Department show the total  value of the annual export of \"Shiitake\" to be nearly five hundred  thousand \"yen\" (silver).      MANUFACTURE OF SPAWN.    As many tons of artificial spawn are yearly imported into this country,  it would seem that the manufacture of spawn in the United States might  prove a profitable form of investment.      \"BRICK SPAWN.\"    For commercial purposes the English method of making the spawn into  bricks has some advantages over the French \"flake\" process. Its compact  and uniform shape makes the brick more convenient for storage and  general handling, and greatly facilitates its transportation to long  distances. Brick spawn is made in the following manner: Clean horse  droppings, cow manure, loam, and road sweepings are beaten up in a  mortar-like consistency and then formed into bricks, moulds being used,  slightly differing in shape with different makers, but usually thinner  and wider than common building bricks. The following proportions are  given: (1) Horse droppings the chief part; one-fourth cow dung;  remainder loam. (2) Fresh horse droppings mixed with short litter for  the greater part; cow dung, one third; and the rest mould or loam. (3)  Horse dung, cow dung, and loam, in equal parts. When about half dry,  depressions are made in the bricks, sometimes in the centre, and  sometimes in each corner, and small pieces of good spawn are placed in  these depressions, and plastered over with the material of the brick.  The cakes are then laid out to dry, standing on their edges, and when  nearly dry are piled in pairs with the spawn-larded surfaces face to  face. The bricks are then stacked away, and covered with sweet  fermenting litter, sufficiently to cause a heat of 60 F. It should not  be over 70 F. One spawn manufacturer says that the most rapid and  successful growth of the mycelium is attained when the temperature is  from 63 F. to 67 F. The bricks are examined frequently during the  process, and when the mycelium of the old spawn has permeated the whole  mass like a fine white mould, the bricks are taken out and dried in a  well-ventilated dark place. They are then placed in a cool, dark  storehouse, where they are not subject to dampness and where the  temperature is about 50 F., not over 65 or below 35 F. Slight  ventilation is necessary, but not enough to make the bricks dust-dry.  Keeping the spawn dry merely suspends its growth; as soon as it is again  submitted to favorable conditions of moisture and heat, its pristine  activity returns. Dampness, combined with heat, stimulates the growth of  mycelium; frost also destroys the vitality of the spawn. It is evident,  therefore, that these conditions should not exist in the store-room.    One manufacturer advocates piling the bricks, after spawning, on a clay  floor, packing closely four bricks deep, and covering them with sifted  loam. By this method it is claimed that danger of \"fire fang\" will be  avoided, as the bricks will be kept at a perfectly uniform temperature  of about 60 or 66, which causes the spawn to run quickly and  uniformly. In from four to six weeks they are ready to take out and dry  for use or storage.    The French or \"Flake\" spawn comes in light masses of loose, dry litter.  It is obtained in the following way: A bed is made up as if for  mushrooms in the ordinary way, and spawned with \"virgin\" spawn, and when  the bed is thoroughly impregnated with spawn, it is broken up and set  aside to dry. This spawn is usually sold in small boxes, containing from  two to five pounds, but it also can be obtained in bulk when it is  purchased by weight. The French or \"flake\" spawn is much more expensive  than the English or \"brick\" spawn. It is claimed by some very successful  growers, who have tried both, that the brick spawn produces heavier and  fleshier mushrooms than the French \"flake.\"      \"MILL TRACK\" SPAWN.    \"Mill track\" spawn was formerly considered the best in England, but  since horse power has given place to steam power in the mills there is  now no further supply of mill track, and it is practically superseded by  the \"brick\" spawn. The real \"mill track\" is the natural spawn that has  spread through the thoroughly amalgamated horse droppings in mill  tracks, or the sweepings from mill tracks.      SPAWN PRODUCED IN A MANURE HEAP.    During the past year I have made some experiments in the pine and oak  woods of Hynesboro' Park, Maryland, with relation to spawn culture, an  account of which may prove of interest to students in this line of  investigation. Several loads of stable manure and oak-leaf bedding were  well mixed and formed into a mound about three feet in height, having a  diameter of six feet, and tapering to about four inches in depth at the  outer edge. The mass was quite moist and slightly tamped to give it  general consistency. It was exposed to the open air, without protection,  during the months of September, October, and November. In the meantime,  frequent rains occurred. On examination it was found that the rains did  not penetrate to a depth of more than four inches. On opening up the  centre of the mound, it was observed that the portion thus exposed  consisted of highly decomposed leaves, and presented a white mass of  matted, \"burned\" mycelium. It was evident that the temperature at that  point had risen considerably above 100 Fahr. The mycelium was,  doubtless, produced in abundance before the temperature reached 100  Fahr. and became scorched as the temperature increased. On examining the  outer edges, where the depth was only twelve inches, I found an  abundance of mycelium which did not show any appearance of having been  scorched by undue temperature. Since no mycelium had been added to the  mound, it is evident that the spores which produced it must have been  present, although unobserved, and awaiting only the proper conditions  for development, _i. e._, for budding and the production of mycelium. At  the end of the third month, groups of the common meadow mushroom,  Agaricus campestris, together with some fine examples of Tricholoma  terreum, an edible mushroom, common to these woods, appeared on the  edges of the mound.
