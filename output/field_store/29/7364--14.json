Leading  to this core of the temple, which was sometimes called \"the divine  house,\" were various halls the roofs of which were supported by  columns--those hypostyle halls which one sees perpetually in Egypt.  Before the first of these halls was a courtyard surrounded by a  colonnade. In the courtyard the priests of the temple assembled. The  people were allowed to enter the colonnade. A gateway with towers gave  entrance to the courtyard. If one visits many of the Egyptian temples,  one soon becomes aware of the subtlety, combined with a sort of high  simplicity and sense of mystery and poetry, of these builders of the  past. As a great writer leads one on, with a concealed but beautiful  art, from the first words to which all the other words are ministering  servants; as the great musician--Wagner in his \"Meistersinger,\" for  instance--leads one from the first notes of his score to those final  notes which magnificently reveal to the listeners the real meaning  of those first notes, and of all the notes which follow them: so the  Egyptian builders lead the spirit gently, mysteriously forward from the  gateway between the towers to the distant house divine. When one enters  the outer court, one feels the far-off sanctuary. Almost unconsciously  one is aware that for that sanctuary all the rest of the temple was  created; that to that sanctuary everything tends. And in spirit one is  drawn softly onward to that very holy place. Slowly, perhaps, the body  moves from courtyard to hypostyle hall, and from one hall to another.  Hieroglyphs are examined, cartouches puzzled out, paintings of  processions, or bas-reliefs of pastimes and of sacrifices, looked at  with care and interest; but all the time one has the sense of waiting,  of a want unsatisfied. And only when one at last reaches the sanctuary  is one perfectly at rest. For then the spirit feels: \"This is the  meaning of it all.\"    One of the means which the Egyptian architects used to create this sense  of approach is very simple, but perfectly effective. It consisted  only in making each hall on a very slightly higher level than the one  preceding it, and the sanctuary, which is narrow and mysteriously dark  on the highest level of all. Each time one takes an upward step, or  walks up a little incline of stone, the body seems to convey to the soul  a deeper message of reverence and awe. In no other temple is this sense  of approach to the heart of a thing so acute as it is when one walks in  Edfu. In no other temple, when the sanctuary is reached, has one such a  strong consciousness of being indeed within a sacred heart.    The color of Edfu is a pale and delicate brown, warm in the strong  sunshine, but seldom glowing. Its first doorway is extraordinarily  high, and is narrow, but very deep, with a roof showing traces of that  delicious clear blue-green which is like a thin cry of joy rising up in  the solemn temples of Egypt. A small sphinx keeps watch on the right,  just where the guardian stands; this guardian, the gift of the past,  squat, even fat, with a very perfect face of a determined and handsome  man. In the court, upon a pedestal, stands a big bird, and near it is  another bird, or rather half of a bird, leaning forward, and very much  defaced. And in this great courtyard there are swarms of living birds,  twittering in the sunshine. Through the doorway between the towers one  sees a glimpse of a native village with the cupolas of a mosque.    I stood and looked at the cupolas for a moment. Then I turned, and  forgot for a time the life of the world without--that men, perhaps, were  praying beneath those cupolas, or praising the Moslem's God. For when I  turned, I felt, as I have said, as if all the worship of the world must  be concentrated here. Standing far down the open court, in the full  sunshine, I could see into the first hypostyle hall, but beyond only a  darkness--a darkness which led me on, in which the further chambers of  the house divine were hidden. As I went on slowly, the perfection of  the plan of the dead architects was gradually revealed to me, when the  darkness gave up its secrets; when I saw not clearly, but dimly, the  long way between the columns, the noble columns themselves, the gradual,  slight upward slope--graduated by genius; there is no other word--which  led to the sanctuary, seen at last as a little darkness, in which all  the mystery of worship, and of the silent desires of men, was surely  concentrated, and kept by the stone for ever. Even the succession of the  darknesses, like shadows growing deeper and deeper, seemed planned by  some great artist in the management of light, and so of shadow effects.  The perfection of form is in Edfu, impossible to describe, impossible  not to feel. The tremendous effect it has--an effect upon the soul--is  created by a combination of shapes, of proportions, of different levels,  of different heights, by consummate graduation. And these shapes,  proportions, different levels, and heights, are seen in dimness. Not  that jewelled dimness one loves in Gothic cathedrals, but the heavy  dimness of windowless, mighty chambers lighted only by a rebuked  daylight ever trying to steal in. One is captured by no ornament,  seduced by no lovely colors. Better than any ornament, greater than  any radiant glory of color, is this massive austerity. It is like  the ultimate in an art. Everything has been tried, every strangeness  _bizarrerie_, absurdity, every wild scheme of hues, every preposterous  subject--to take an extreme instance, a camel, wearing a top-hat, and  lighted up by fire-works, which I saw recently in a picture-gallery  of Munich. And at the end a genius paints a portrait of a wrinkled old  woman's face, and the world regards and worships. Or all discords have  been flung together pell-mell, resolution of them has been deferred  perpetually, perhaps even denied altogether, chord of B major has been  struck with C major, works have closed upon the leading note or the  dominant seventh, symphonies have been composed to be played in the  dark, or to be accompanied by a magic-lantern's efforts, operas been  produced which are merely carnage and a row--and at the end a genius  writes a little song, and the world gives the tribute of its breathless  silence and its tears. And it knows that though other things may be  done, better things can never be done. For no perfection can exceed any  other perfection.    And so in Edfu I feel that this untinted austerity is perfect; that  whatever may be done in architecture during future ages of the world,  Edfu, while it lasts, will remain a thing supreme--supreme in form and,  because of this supremacy, supreme in the spell which it casts upon the  soul.    The sanctuary is just a small, beautifully proportioned, inmost chamber,  with a black roof, containing a sort of altar of granite, and a great  polished granite shrine which no doubt once contained the god Horus. I  am glad he is not there now. How far more impressive it is to stand in  an empty sanctuary in the house divine of \"the Hidden One,\" whom the  nations of the world worship, whether they spread their robes on the  sand and turn their faces to Mecca, or beat the tambourine and sing  \"glory hymns\" of salvation, or flagellate themselves in the night before  the patron saint of the Passionists, or only gaze at the snow-white  plume that floats from the snows of Etna under the rose of dawn, and  feel the soul behind Nature. Among the temples of Egypt, Edfu is the  house divine of \"the Hidden One,\" the perfect temple of worship.          XV    KOM OMBOS    Some people talk of the \"sameness\" of the Nile; and there is a lovely  sameness of golden light, of delicious air, of people, and of scenery.  For Egypt is, after all, mainly a great river with strips on each side  of cultivated land, flat, green, not very varied. River, green plains,  yellow plains, pink, brown, steel-grey, or pale-yellow mountains, wail  of shadoof, wail of sakieh. Yes, I suppose there is a sameness, a sort  of golden monotony, in this land pervaded with light and pervaded with  sound. Always there is light around you, and you are bathing in it, and  nearly always, if you are living, as I was, on the water, there is a  multitude of mingling sounds floating, floating to your ears. As there  are two lines of green land, two lines of mountains, following the  course of the Nile; so are there two lines of voices that cease their  calling and their singing only as you draw near to Nubia. For then, with  the green land, they fade away, these miles upon miles of calling and  singing brown men; and amber and ruddy sands creep downward to the  Nile. And the air seems subtly changing, and the light perhaps growing  a little harder. And you are aware of other regions unlike those you are  leaving, more African, more savage, less suave, less like a dreaming.  And especially the silence makes a great impression on you. But before  you enter this silence, between the amber and ruddy walls that will lead  you on to Nubia, and to the land of the crocodile, you have a visit to  pay. For here, high up on a terrace, looking over a great bend of the  river is Kom Ombos. And Kom Ombos is the temple of the crocodile god.    Sebek was one of the oldest and one of the most evil of the Egyptian  gods. In the Fayum he was worshipped, as well as at Kom Ombos, and  there, in the holy lake of his temple, were numbers of holy crocodiles,  which Strabo tells us were decorated with jewels like pretty women. He  did not get on with the other gods, and was sometimes confused with Set,  who personified natural darkness, and who also was worshipped by the  people about Kom Ombos.    I have spoken of the golden sameness of the Nile, but this sameness is  broken by the variety of the temples. Here you have a striking instance  of this variety. Edfu, only forty miles from "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34076"],[0,"Fox Trapping: A Book of Instruction Telling How to Trap, Snare, Poison and Shoot (#14)"],[1,"old head, and set the trap out away from the head as far as the  chains will let them go, by driving the stake right close to the  head. Then dig a small place in the sand so the trap will set just  level with the surface of the sand, for each trap to set in. Take a  small piece of cotton batton and put enough under each pan of the  traps to keep the sand from getting under pans so they won't spring.  Now take the sand that you took out of the places for the traps and  cover them all over, traps, chains and all. Then take a small bush  and brush out all your tracks and over the traps. If you have done  your work well you can hardly tell where the traps are. You can use  some good scent on the sand or on the old head, but I don't think it  needs it. Fix the old head in the sand quite a little while before  you want to trap. All I ever caught I caught in this way. If you do  everything right I am sure of your success.      * * *    I have visited hundreds of trappers in Maine and Canada, and have  learned many of the secrets of successful trapping from them and also  from my own personal experience and observation, writes N. C.  Burbank. I have come to the conclusion that the basis of all the most  successful secret decoys for catching fox is the substance taken from  the glands of the female fox during the running season, mixed with  grease of some sort, together with contents of the glands of the  skunk, preferably the female taken in the spring or latter part of  the winter. I do not pretend to say that every one will be successful  who uses that decoy. I am of the opinion, if directions are closely  followed in the following method of water trapping for fox, you are  reasonably sure to catch them if you use that decoy.    During the month of August or September select some spring or place  about a foot and a half from the edge, or in the center of a circular  spring that is not over 4 feet wide, a sod 8 or 10 inches across, and  arrange a place to set the trap a few inches from the outside. This  must be done early in the season, so all evidence of human work and  scent will be removed before trapping time.      [Illustration: THE SPRING AND SOD SET.]    When the season arrives you are ready to set your trap, and you do so  in the following manner: In selecting springs you must find one that  has an outlet so you can walk in the water for a distance of three  rods, six or eight is better. Set your trap and take it up to the  spring or place selected, walking in the water and using the greatest  care not to touch bushes or anything to leave the scent of yourself.  Place the trap in the place prepared in the early season, being sure  it is covered over entirely, chain and all, by water. Then cover with  dead leaves or whatever is on the bottom of the spring. Place upon  the trap pan a small sod as light a one as possible, allowing it to  be out of the water at least one inch so that the fox in reaching for  the bait will step on the sod, which should be six or eight inches  from the shore. Fox, like the human being, do not like to wet their  feet.    Now you have the trap set and then comes the baiting. Take a small  piece of meat and place it on the larger sod, using great care not to  leave human scent, take a few drops of this decoy and place on the  bait. Also take a rotten stick and break off a piece 6 or 8 inches  long, being careful of handling, and place two or three drops on the  end and stick it into the sod so it will stick up two inches or such  a matter above it. Your trap is now ready for Reynard, and if you use  great care in setting and in visiting your traps I am certain of your  success.    There are many methods of catching foxes and I am acquainted with  them, not all, perhaps, as each man has a little different way, but I  am satisfied the above for a water set it correct.      * * *    Here in the East where I am trapping near the mountains, if we could  not catch fox on the snow path we would not get any prime fur, says  J. H. Shufelt, of Canada.    I will give one of my snow sets that I use here for fox. It may not  fit your case as every locality calls for its own method, and foxes  are slyer in some places than others. I use a No. 3 Blake & Lamb trap  with a three foot chain and grapple. How to fix the trap? I take a  large kettle and fill with water and put my traps in and get the  water boiling hot. For every dozen of traps I put in one-half pint of  lime not air slacked, and boil for ten minutes. Now take out your  traps, which will be odorless and white as snow, and use gloves in  handling and setting them.      [Illustration: ODORLESS AND WHITE AS SNOW.]    When you get ready to set your traps go out in a large field where  foxes are traveling, make a good path across the field by traveling  back and forth. Where you want to make a set leave a little partition  across the path to guide the fox in the trap, which is covered with  white paper and a little snow. Be careful in setting and not leave  tracks outside of the path nor lay any sticks across. When going to  your traps walk in the path, which makes it better, and don't let too  much snow get over them. Be careful and you will get your fox.    Do foxes eat skunk? I might say in answer to this question they do,  and they will kill skunk if found outside of their dens. And if a fox  is run in a den where there is a skunk, their odor is most always  sure to prove fatal to a fox in a very short time. Several instances  of this kind have happened in this locality where I am hunting and  trapping.    Foxes are very fond of skunk for food, and the musk makes a good  scent for trapping foxes. A good scent for cold weather, for it never  freezes.  No doubt a good trapper will say, give me fresh bait. I  might say give me a strong smelling bait, for when the fox is  smelling a strong bait or scent he cannot smell anything else at the  same time.    Now for instance, if you were going out for a fox hunt, and your  hound got scented by skunk, it would spoil his scenting anything, and  he could not follow the trail. Several experiences have led me to  think this is one reason why we make a better catch on a damp or  rainy night. The bait smells so much stronger that it takes up more  of the game's sense of smell and makes our chance of a catch better.  The old trapper will oftimes make this remark, \"Boys, I am going to  make a big catch tonight--why, because it is going to be a damp and  rainy night.\" Who knows why?    I trap foxes by land and water set. I sometimes use a set called the  all around land set. Every locality calls for its own method. I use  two kinds of traps, Blake & Lamb and Newhouse. They are both all  right. My trapping grounds are near the mountains where the foxes  defy fox hounds, for they have dens in the rocks.    The Hunter-Trader-Trapper, Columbus, Ohio, is in touch with fox  trappers, hunters and owners of hounds from all parts of America, so  that interesting articles are constantly being received and  published.      [Illustration: CANADIAN TRAPPER AND FIFTEEN REDS.]    The following, by W. J. Taylor, of New York, is his method for  trapping the red fox: Choose a rotten stump near their runways, cut  out a cavity in the top of the stump deep enough to set trap and  allow one-half inch of finely pulverized rotten wood to cover trap,  spring and chain. Do not handle pulverized wood with your hands. Have  your traps thoroughly greased, chain and all, then smoke with  hemlock, spruce, cedar or pine boughs. Smoke until trap and chain are  black. This is to stop the smell of steel. Sometimes I use a moss  covered stump, that is a stump with moss growing all or partly around  its sides. Cut the cavity the same in stump, cover lightly with  pulverized rotten wood.    Now go to another moss covered stump, cut moss enough to cover top of  stump, cut a circular piece out a little smaller than jaws of trap,  place this right on top of trap, then place the rest on top of stump,  trim outsides to match outside of stump. Handle moss with sharpened  stick and knife, never with bare hands unless set is made one week  before baiting and scenting. I generally make my sets two weeks  before placing bait and scent.    Place bait about six or eight feet from stump, always on lower  hillside. Daub your fox scent on top of stump, side towards your  bait. For bait I use muskrat carcasses, skunk, dead hens, rabbits,  fish or partly decomposed meat. My receipt for fox scent is fish oil  one-half pint (made by placing fish in glass can in summer and  hanging in sun until decomposed) the musk sacks of ten or more  muskrats, one or more fox matrix which are obtained from the female  fox, also fat from the inside of either sex is good. Mix all  together. It will surely draw the fox.      [Illustration: ADIRONDACK TRAPPER.]        CHAPTER XVII.    REYNARD OUTWITTED.    A good fox year can be counted upon with reasonable certainty once  every five years, says Martin Hunter, on the Labrador coast, at least  so say the oldest residents. The year before they begin to come down  from the interior, then the climax for great numbers. Then the  following year they decrease in numbers to what they were two years  before, and the winter following so few that one or two about in  miles of coast is a rarity.    Such was the case in the winter of 71; 69 had been a great fox year.  What was not trapped in the winter of 70 had migrated back to the  remote interior. Between the posts of Scum Islands and Moisie, a  distance of twenty-one miles of coast, there was only known to be one  fox--a red one--with a claw missing on his right paw, and he was as  cunning an old fellow as ever bothered a trapper. For a night or two  he would play all kinds of tricks down about Moisie, and then we  would hear of him around Seven Islands. There being no kind of  hunting, the people got anxious as to who would succeed in catching  the old rascal.    Bait would be"]]]
