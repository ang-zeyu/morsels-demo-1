But a splendid show they made as, marching to drum  and fife, they filed down _Las Sierpes_ and stretched \"in never ending  line\" across the _plaza_. Our most Holy Mary of Hope, who followed,  wearing a fair white tunic and a gold-embroidered mantle of green, the  color of the hopeful season, drowned the memory of that stern military  music in a silver concert of flutes.    After this sumptuous display, the fourth band of Nazarenes, gliding  through the _plaza_ between night and day in their garb of black and  white, could arouse but little enthusiasm, although their Crucifixion  was one of the most artistic, and their Lady of the Presentation had  her poorest garment of fine satin.    A pearly lustre was stealing through the sky, and the chill in the air  was thinning the rows of spectators on the grand stand, when  mysterious, dim-white shapes, like ghosts, bore by in utter silence a  pageant of Christ fainting beneath the burden of the cross. But soon  the clamor of drums and fifes ushered in another long array of Roman  soldiers, a rainbow host in red and pink and blue, crimson plumes  alternating with white, and golden shields with silver. The electric  lights, globed high overhead, took one look at this fantastic  cavalcade and went out with a gasp.    It was now clear day. Canaries began to sing in their cages, and  parrots to scream for chocolate. Sleepy-eyed servant-maids appeared on  the balconies, and market women, leading green-laden donkeys, peered  forth from the side streets into the square. The morning light made  havoc with the glamour of the pageants. Something frank and practical  in the sunshine stripped those candle-lighted litters of their  dignity. Busy people dodged through the procession lines, and one  Nazarene after another might be seen slipping out of the ranks and  hurrying awkwardly, in his cumbersome dress, with the half-burned  taper under his arm, to the refuge of his own mosquito-netting and  orange tree. The tired crowd grew critical and irreverent, and openly  railed upon the Virgin of this ghostly _cofradia_ because her velvet  mantle was comparatively plain. \"Bah! how poor it is! Are we to sit  here all the night for such stingy shows as that?\"    But the last brotherhood in the _madrugada_ processions had, with  their white frocks and blue caps and capes, suited themselves to the  colors of the day. The stumbling children, blind with sleep, whom  fathers were already leading off the square, turned back for a drowsy  gaze at the resplendent tunic of the Christ in the Via Dolorosa  _paso_, a tunic claimed to be the richest of all the garments worn by  the effigies of Jesus. So lovely was this trooping company in their  tints of sky and cloud, bearing a great blue banner and a shining  ivory cross, that they brought order and decorum with them.    The division that escorted the Virgin marched on with especial  steadiness, not a peaked cap drooping, nor a boyish acolyte faltering  under the weight of his tall gilded censer. This most Holy Mary of  Anguish, whose litter and canopy were all of white and gold, swept by  in triumphal peals of music while the clocks were striking six. In  some mental confusion, I said good night to the people I left on the  balcony, and good morning to the people I met on the stairs, and ate  my breakfast before I went to bed.    It seemed as if human nature could bear no more; the eyes ached with  seeing, and phantasmal processions went sweeping through our dreams;  yet Friday afternoon at five o'clock found our balcony, like all the  rest, full to overflowing. Some twenty thousand people were massed in  the _plaza_, and it was estimated that over one hundred thousand  waited along the line of march. Our Spanish entertainers, still  unrefreshed by any chance for sleep, were as gayly and punctiliously  attentive to their guests as ever, from our gallant host, who  presented the ladies with fragrant bouquets of roses and orange  blossoms, to the little pet of the household, who at the most  engrossing moments in the ceremonial would slip away from her  privileged stand on a footstool against the railing to summon any  member of the party who might be missing the spectacle.    The Spanish colors floated out from city hall and court-house, but the  great concourse below was all in hues of mourning, the black mantillas  often falling over dresses of plain purple. The senoritas in the  balconies had substituted knots of black ribbon for the customary  flowers in the hair. Jet trimmings abounded, and the waving fans were  black.    The coming procession, we were assured on every hand, would be the  most solemn of all and the most sumptuous. The habits of the Nazarenes  would be of satin, silk, and velvet. The images of Christ and the  Virgin would be attired with all possible magnificence of damask and  ermine, gold and jewels. Brotherhood would vie with brotherhood in  splendor, and one prodigy of luxury would succeed another.    The leading company, whose far-trailing robes carpeted the street with  fine black velvet, stood for the olive industry. This _cofradia_ had  been poor and unimportant for generations, but in recent years a  devoted brother, a manufacturer of olive packing-barrels, had poured  forth his accumulated fortune upon the society, with the result that  their _pasos_ are now second in ostentation and expense to none. The  donor, long since too feeble to bear his taper in the line, lives in  humble obscurity, but his old heart swells with joy this great day of  the year when he sees, following the elaborate carving of the  Crucifixion, the dazzling chariot of Our Lady of Solitude. Upon her  mantle, which enjoys the proud distinction of being the very costliest  of all, he has lavished twenty thousand dollars. Longer by a yard than  any of the others, it was yet unable to find place for all the gold  which the zealous Nazarene had given for it, and the residue was  bestowed about the pedestal and canopy. The _paso_ is so heavy with  gold that it requires a double force of men to carry it; but each of  these hidden bearers, getting air as best he can through a silver  breathing-tube, is sure of a dollar for his recompense as well as two  glasses of good wine.      [Illustration: GRANADA. LOOKING TOWARD THE DARRO]    All the adornment of the litter is of pure gold, and such wealth of  jewels glinted from the Virgin's glorious raiment that a triple force  of Civil Guards was detailed for her protection. Her ardent worshipper  has denied her nothing. The very columns that uphold her canopy are  exquisite in carving, and it is his yearly pride to see that her  clouds of incense are the thickest, and her train of musicians the  most extended, in all that glittering line.    The second _cofradia_ exhibited but a single pageant, relying for  effect upon the beauty of the sculpture. The Mater Dolorosa was bowed  in her desolation at the foot of the Holy Rood, from which hung only  the white folds of the winding-sheet.    But the third brotherhood had bethought themselves to introduce,  between their austere Crucifixion and their shining image of Mary,  another preposterous parade of Roman soldiers--flower-colored,  plume-tossing, butterfly creatures far too bright, if not too good,  \"for human nature's daily food.\" One whiff from Caesar's iron breast  would have blown them away like soap bubbles.    The silversmiths trooped by in graver, more majestic state, their  purple velvet habits girded with gold cords. Upon a gilded pedestal,  wrought with high relief, was seen their Christ, bowed beneath a  precious cross of tortoise-shell and silver. Our Lady of Expectation  gleamed with gold and gems, and this haughty brotherhood received a  full meed of applause.    Black from top to toe was the fifth procession. Their Jesus of the Via  Dolorosa bent beneath a sombre cross of ebony embossed with gold, but  the blithe young voices of the countless choir-boys, singing like  birds before the dawn, ushered in a sun-bright image of Mary.    But something was amiss with the processional order. Where were the  stately ranks of Montserrat? Alas and alas! Scarcely had this  aristocratic _cofradia_ gone a hundred paces from their chapel when,  in the narrow street of Murillo, a leaning candle touched the lace  skirt of the Virgin and instantly all the front of the litter was in  flames. It was hardly a matter of minutes. From the balconies above  were dashed down pailfuls and pitcherfuls of water. The Nazarenes,  wrenching away the blue velvet mantle wondrously embroidered in gold  with castles, lions, and _fleurs de lis_, succeeded in rescuing a  ragged half of it, and the Civil Guards, drawing their swords and  forming a circle about the smoking litter, saved the jewels from  robbery. Perhaps the other _paso_, too, Christ of the Conversion of  the Penitent Thief, had some protecting influence. But in all this ado  about her finery, the poor Virgin's face, beloved for its winsome  look, was completely burned away. In sorry plight Our Lady of  Montserrat was hurried back to her chapel, and the swift rumor of the  disaster sent a superstitious trouble through the city.    But more and more solemnly the taper-bearing troops of Nazarenes  poured by with the culminating pictures of the Passion. These last  three _cofradias_ presented each a single pageant. An escort in dark  purple conducted an impressive Descent from the Cross. The Virgin, her  crowned head bowed in anguish, clasps the drooping body of Christ to  her heart, while John and Mary Magdalene look on in hopeless sorrow.  Figures in black and white came after, with their sixteenth-century  carving, Christ of the Dying Breath, beneath the cross standing Our  Lady of Tears. And last of all, in slow, sad movement, their white  trains streaming like a line of light along the stone-paved way,  passed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38777"],[0,"Lad: A Dog (#14)"],[1," never been in a city or in a crowd. To him the universe was  bounded by the soft green mountains that hemmed in the valley and the  lake. The Place stood on the lake's edge, its meadows running back to  the forest. There were few houses nearer than the mile-distant  village. It was an ideal home for such a dog as Lad, even as Lad was  an ideal dog for such a home.    A guest started all the trouble--a guest who spent a week-end at The  Place and who loved dogs far better than he understood them. He made  much of Lad, being loud-voiced in his admiration of the stately  collie. Lad endured the caresses when he could not politely elude  them.    \"Say!\" announced the guest just before he departed, \"If I had a dog  like Lad, I'd 'show' him--at the big show at Madison Square, you  know. It's booked for next month. Why not take a chance and exhibit  him there? Think what it would mean to you people to have a Westminster  blue ribbon the big dog had won! Why, you'd be as proud as Punch!\"    It was a careless speech and well meant. No harm might have come from  it, had not the Master the next day chanced upon an advance notice of  the dog-show in his morning paper. He read the press-agent's  quarter-column proclamation. Then he remembered what the guest had  said. The Mistress was called into consultation. And it was she, as  ever, who cast the deciding vote.    \"Lad is twice as beautiful as any collie we ever saw at the Show,\" she  declared, \"and not one of them is half as wise or good or _human_ as  he is. And--a blue ribbon is the greatest honor a dog can have, I  suppose. It would be something to remember.\"    After which, the Master wrote a letter to a friend who kept a show  kennel of Airedales. He received this answer:      \"I don't pretend to know anything, professionally, about    collies--Airedales being my specialty. But Lad is a beauty, as I    remember him, and his pedigree shows a bunch of old-time    champions. I'd risk it, if I were you. If you are in doubt and    don't want to plunge, why not just enter him for the Novice class?    That is a class for dogs that have never before been shown. It will    cost you five dollars to enter him for a single class, like    that. And in the Novice, he won't be up against any champions or    other dogs that have already won prizes. That will make it    easier. It isn't a grueling competition like the 'Open' or even the    'Limit.' If he wins as a Novice, you can enter him, another time, in    something more important. I'm inclosing an application-blank for    you to fill out and send with your entrance-fee, to the    secretary. You'll find his address at the bottom of the blank. I'm    showing four of my Airedales there--so we'll be neighbors.\"    Thus encouraged, the Master filled in the blank and sent it with a  check. And in due time word was returned to him that \"Sunnybank Lad\"  was formally entered for the Novice class, at the Westminster Kennel  Club's annual show at Madison Square Garden.    By this time both the Mistress and the Master were infected with the  most virulent type of the Show Germ. They talked of little else than  the forthcoming Event. They read all the dog-show literature they  could lay hands on.    As for Lad, he was mercifully ignorant of what was in store for him.    The Mistress had an inkling of his fated ordeal when she read the  Kennel Club rule that no dog could be taken from the Garden, except  at stated times, from the moment the show should begin, at ten  A.M. Wednesday morning, until the hour of its close, at ten o'clock  Saturday night. For twelve hours a day--for four consecutive  days--every entrant must be there. By paying a forfeit fee, dog owners  might take their pets to some nearby hotel or stable, for the  remainder of the night and early morning--a permission which, for  obvious reasons, would not affect most dogs.    \"But Lad's never been away from home a night in his life!\" exclaimed  the Mistress in dismay. \"He'll be horribly lonely there, all that  while--especially at night.\"    By this time, with the mysterious foreknowledge of the best type of  thoroughbred collie, Lad began to be aware that something unusual had  crept into the atmosphere of The Place. It made him restless, but he  did not associate it with himself--until the Mistress took to giving  him daily baths and brushings.    Always she had brushed him once a day, to keep his shaggy coat fluffy  and burnished; and the lake had supplied him with baths that made him  as clean as any human. But never had he undergone such searching  massage with comb and brush as was now his portion. Never had he known  such soap-infested scrubbings as were now his daily fate, for the week  preceding the show.    As a result of these ministrations his wavy fur was like spun silk in  texture; and it stood out all over him like the hair of a Circassian  beauty in a dime museum. The white chest and forepaws were like  snow. And his sides and broad back and mighty shoulders shone like  dark bronze.    He was magnificent--but he was miserable. He knew well enough, now,  that he was in some way the center of all this unwonted stir and  excitement which pervaded The Place. He loathed change of any sort--a  thoroughbred collie being ever an ultra-conservative. This particular  change seemed to threaten his peace; also it kept his skin scraped  with combs and his hair redolent of nasty-smelling soaps.    To humans there was no odor at all in the naphtha soap with which the  Mistress lathered the dog, and every visible atom of it was washed  away at once with warm water. But a human's sense of smell, compared  with the best type of collie's, is as a purblind puppy's power of  sight in comparison to a hawk's.    All over the East, during these last days before the Show, hundreds of  high-bred dogs were undergoing preparation for an exhibition which to  the beholder is a delight--and which to many of the canine exhibits is  a form of unremitting torture. To do justice to the Master and the  Mistress, they had no idea--then--of this torture. Otherwise all the  blue ribbons ever woven would not have tempted them to subject their  beloved chum to it.    In some kennels Airedales were \"plucked,\" by hand, to rid them of the  last vestige of the soft gray outer coat which is an Airedale's chief  natural beauty--and no hair of which must be seen in a show.  \"Plucking\" a dog is like pulling live hairs from a human head, so far  as the sensation goes. But show-traditions demand the anguish.    In other kennels, bull-terriers' white coats were still further  whitened by the harsh rubbing of pipeclay into the tender skin.  Sensitive tails and still more sensitive ears were sandpapered,  for the victims' greater beauty--and agony. Ear-interiors, also, were  shaved close with safety-razors.    Murderous little \"knife-combs\" were tearing blithely away at collies'  ear-interiors and heads, to \"barber\" natural furriness into painful  and unnatural trimness. Ears were \"scrunched\" until their wearers  quivered with stark anguish--to impart the perfect tulip-shape;  ordained by fashion for collies.    And so on, through every breed to be exhibited--each to its own form  of torment; torments compared to which Lad's gentle if bothersome  brushing and bathing were a pure delight!    Few of these ruthlessly \"prepared\" dogs were personal pets. The bulk  of them were \"kennel dogs\"--dogs bred and raised after the formula for  raising and breeding prize hogs or chickens, and with little more of  the individual element in it. The dogs were bred in a way to bring out  certain arbitrary \"points\" which count in show-judging, and which  change from year to year.    Brain, fidelity, devotion, the _human_ side of a dog--these were  totally ignored in the effort to breed the perfect physical animal.  The dogs were kept in kennel-buildings and in wire \"runs\" like  so many pedigreed cattle--looked after by paid attendants, and trained  to do nothing but to be the best-looking of their kind, and to win  ribbons. Some of them did not know their owners by sight--having been  reared wholly by hirelings.    The body was everything; the heart, the mind, the namelessly  delightful quality of the master-raised dog--these were nothing. Such  traits do not win prizes at a bench-show. Therefore fanciers, whose  sole aim is to win ribbons and cups, do not bother to cultivate  them. (All of this is extraneous; but may be worth your remembering,  next time you go to a dog-show.)    Early on the morning of the Show's first day, the Mistress and the  Master set forth for town with Lad. They went in their little car,  that the dog might not risk the dirt and cinders of a train.    Lad refused to eat a mouthful of the tempting breakfast set before him  that day. He could not eat, when foreboding was hot in his throat. He  had often ridden in the car. Usually he enjoyed the ride; but now he  crawled rather than sprang into the tonneau. All the way up the drive,  his great mournful eyes were turned back toward the house in dumb  appeal. Every atom of spirit and gayety and dash were gone from  him. He knew he was being taken away from the sweet Place he loved,  and that the car was whizzing him along toward some dreaded fate. His  heart was sick within him.    To the born and bred show-dog this is an everyday occurrence--painful,  but inevitable. To a chum-dog like Lad, it is heartbreaking. The big  collie buried his head in the Mistress' lap and crouched hopelessly at  her feet as the car chugged cityward.    A thoroughly unhappy dog is the most thoroughly unhappy thing on  earth. All the adored Mistress' coaxings and pettings could not rouse  Lad from his dull apathy of despair. This was the hour when he was  wont to make his stately morning rounds of The Place, at the heels of  one of his two deities. And now, instead, these deities were carrying  him away to something direfully unpleasant. A lesser dog would have  howled or would"]]]
