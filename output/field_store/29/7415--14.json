Thus in this form the question reduces to the question whether we can  know that objects of sense, or any other objects not our own thoughts  and feelings, exist at times when we are not perceiving them. This form,  in which the difficult word \"independent\" no longer occurs, is the form  in which we stated the problem a minute ago.    Our question in the above form raises two distinct problems, which it is  important to keep separate. First, can we know that objects of sense, or  very similar objects, exist at times when we are not perceiving them?  Secondly, if this cannot be known, can we know that other objects,  inferable from objects of sense but not necessarily resembling them,  exist either when we are perceiving the objects of sense or at any other  time? This latter problem arises in philosophy as the problem of the  \"thing in itself,\" and in science as the problem of matter as assumed in  physics. We will consider this latter problem first.    Owing to the fact that we feel passive in sensation, we naturally  suppose that our sensations have outside causes. Now it is necessary  here first of all to distinguish between (1) our sensation, which is a  mental event consisting in our being aware of a sensible object, and (2)  the sensible object of which we are aware in sensation. When I speak of  the sensible object, it must be understood that I do not mean such a  thing as a table, which is both visible and tangible, can be seen by  many people at once, and is more or less permanent. What I mean is just  that patch of colour which is momentarily seen when we look at the  table, or just that particular hardness which is felt when we press it,  or just that particular sound which is heard when we rap it. Each of  these I call a sensible object, and our awareness of it I call a  sensation. Now our sense of passivity, if it really afforded any  argument, would only tend to show that the _sensation_ has an outside  cause; this cause we should naturally seek in the sensible object. Thus  there is no good reason, so far, for supposing that sensible objects  must have outside causes. But both the thing-in-itself of philosophy and  the matter of physics present themselves as outside causes of the  sensible object as much as of the sensation. What are the grounds for  this common opinion?    In each case, I think, the opinion has resulted from the combination of  a belief that _something_ which can persist independently of our  consciousness makes itself known in sensation, with the fact that our  sensations often change in ways which seem to depend upon us rather than  upon anything which would be supposed to persist independently of us. At  first, we believe unreflectingly that everything is as it seems to be,  and that, if we shut our eyes, the objects we had been seeing remain as  they were though we no longer see them. But there are arguments against  this view, which have generally been thought conclusive. It is  extraordinarily difficult to see just what the arguments prove; but if  we are to make any progress with the problem of the external world, we  must try to make up our minds as to these arguments.    A table viewed from one place presents a different appearance from that  which it presents from another place. This is the language of common  sense, but this language already assumes that there is a real table of  which we see the appearances. Let us try to state what is known in terms  of sensible objects alone, without any element of hypothesis. We find  that as we walk round the table, we perceive a series of gradually  changing visible objects. But in speaking of \"walking round the table,\"  we have still retained the hypothesis that there is a single table  connected with all the appearances. What we ought to say is that, while  we have those muscular and other sensations which make us say we are  walking, our visual sensations change in a continuous way, so that, for  example, a striking patch of colour is not suddenly replaced by  something wholly different, but is replaced by an insensible gradation  of slightly different colours with slightly different shapes. This is  what we really know by experience, when we have freed our minds from the  assumption of permanent \"things\" with changing appearances. What is  really known is a correlation of muscular and other bodily sensations  with changes in visual sensations.    But walking round the table is not the only way of altering its  appearance. We can shut one eye, or put on blue spectacles, or look  through a microscope. All these operations, in various ways, alter the  visual appearance which we call that of the table. More distant objects  will also alter their appearance if (as we say) the state of the  atmosphere changes--if there is fog or rain or sunshine. Physiological  changes also alter the appearances of things. If we assume the world of  common sense, all these changes, including those attributed to  physiological causes, are changes in the intervening medium. It is not  quite so easy as in the former case to reduce this set of facts to a  form in which nothing is assumed beyond sensible objects. Anything  intervening between ourselves and what we see must be invisible: our  view in every direction is bounded by the nearest visible object. It  might be objected that a dirty pane of glass, for example, is visible  although we can see things through it. But in this case we really see a  spotted patchwork: the dirtier specks in the glass are visible, while  the cleaner parts are invisible and allow us to see what is beyond. Thus  the discovery that the intervening medium affects the appearances of  things cannot be made by means of the sense of sight alone.    Let us take the case of the blue spectacles, which is the simplest, but  may serve as a type for the others. The frame of the spectacles is of  course visible, but the blue glass, if it is clean, is not visible. The  blueness, which we say is in the glass, appears as being in the objects  seen through the glass. The glass itself is known by means of the sense  of touch. In order to know that it is between us and the objects seen  through it, we must know how to correlate the space of touch with the  space of sight. This correlation itself, when stated in terms of the  data of sense alone, is by no means a simple matter. But it presents no  difficulties of principle, and may therefore be supposed accomplished.  When it has been accomplished, it becomes possible to attach a meaning  to the statement that the blue glass, which we can touch, is between us  and the object seen, as we say, \"through\" it.    But we have still not reduced our statement completely to what is  actually given in sense. We have fallen into the assumption that the  object of which we are conscious when we touch the blue spectacles still  exists after we have ceased to touch them. So long as we are touching  them, nothing except our finger can be seen through the part touched,  which is the only part where we immediately know that there is  something. If we are to account for the blue appearance of objects other  than the spectacles, when seen through them, it might seem as if we must  assume that the spectacles still exist when we are not touching them;  and if this assumption really is necessary, our main problem is  answered: we have means of knowing of the present existence of objects  not given in sense, though of the same kind as objects formerly given in  sense.    It may be questioned, however, whether this assumption is actually  unavoidable, though it is unquestionably the most natural one to make.  We may say that the object of which we become aware when we touch the  spectacles continues to have effects afterwards, though perhaps it no  longer exists. In this view, the supposed continued existence of  sensible objects after they have ceased to be sensible will be a  fallacious inference from the fact that they still have effects. It is  often supposed that nothing which has ceased to exist can continue to  have effects, but this is a mere prejudice, due to a wrong conception of  causality. We cannot, therefore, dismiss our present hypothesis on the  ground of _a priori_ impossibility, but must examine further whether it  can really account for the facts.    It may be said that our hypothesis is useless in the case when the blue  glass is never touched at all. How, in that case, are we to account for  the blue appearance of objects? And more generally, what are we to make  of the hypothetical sensations of touch which we associate with  untouched visible objects, which we know would be verified if we chose,  though in fact we do not verify them? Must not these be attributed to  permanent possession, by the objects, of the properties which touch  would reveal?    Let us consider the more general question first. Experience has taught  us that where we see certain kinds of coloured surfaces we can, by  touch, obtain certain expected sensations of hardness or softness,  tactile shape, and so on. This leads us to believe that what is seen is  usually tangible, and that it has, whether we touch it or not, the  hardness or softness which we should expect to feel if we touched it.  But the mere fact that we are able to infer what our tactile sensations  would be shows that it is not logically necessary to assume tactile  qualities before they are felt. All that is really known is that the  visual appearance in question, together with touch, will lead to certain  sensations, which can necessarily be determined in terms of the visual  appearance, since otherwise they could not be inferred from it.    We can now give a statement of the experienced facts concerning the blue  spectacles, which will supply an interpretation of common-sense beliefs  without assuming anything beyond the existence of sensible objects at  the times when they are sensible.

Next day I stayed quietly in camp, and then  started back to the camp where I had left my heavy baggage. On the way I  picked up another black bear. My feet were in a frightful condition, but  I had had a fortnight's excellent sport.    I then went on to Cashmere, and on May 6th reached Siringur. The scenery  was beautiful beyond description, and the whole life of the natives very  attractive to look at. However, something did not agree with me, for I  was very sick and had to go to bed for several days. There were one or  two American friends there, and these and the Englishmen, to whom I had  letters of introduction, treated me with extreme courtesy. As soon as I  got well, I started off for the real mountains, hoping especially to get  ibex and markhoor. The ibex is almost exactly the same as the European  animal of that name. The markhoor is a magnificent goat, with long  whitish hair and great spiral horns. They also have in these Cashmere  valleys a big stag called the barramigh, which is a good deal like our  wapiti, only not half so large. On May 21st I started off, first by  boat, but I was bothered from the beginning by chills and fever. I was  weak, and glad I didn't have to march. At first, all I did in shooting  was to have my coolies beat some brush patches near camp. Out of one of  them they started a little musk-deer, which I shot. Soon I began to get  very much better and we took up our march. I was going toward Astor, but  encountered much snow, as it was still early in the season for these  high mountains. I saw some grand barramigh, but their horns were, of  course, only just growing, and I didn't molest them.    Very soon I got into a country where the red bears literally swarmed.  From May 26th to June 5th, during which time I was traveling and hunting  all the time, I shot no less than sixteen, together with two musk-deer,  but saw nothing else. The marching was very hard, and some of the passes  dangerous. I met a British officer, Lieutenant Carey, on the 30th, who  treated me very well indeed. The scenery was very beautiful, although  rather bleak. I did not pick up strength as much as I had hoped. On June  3d I christened my camp Camp Good Luck, because of the phenomenal  success I had with the bears. That morning we left by 4 to cross the  river before the snow had melted. The thermometer would go down to 30  degrees, even in the valleys, at night, so that everything would freeze,  and then would go up to 110 in the day, and when the snow melted the  streams would come down in a perfect torrent. Not two miles beyond the  river I saw three bears on the side of a hill, a she and two  two-year-old cubs. My shikari made a splendid stalk and brought me  within forty yards, and I got all three with a shot apiece. The delight  of my camp followers was amusing. I then left the tents, and, taking  only my blankets and a lunch basket with me, started off again. At  midday I slept, and at 2 o'clock started up the nullah, seeing a number  of bears. One of them I got within fifty yards, and two others, right  and left, at 100 yards. The skinning took a long time, and the stream  which I had to cross was up with the evening flood, so that I didn't get  back to camp until 10 o'clock. I had shot unusually well, I had been  happy and was all tired out, and it is needless to say how I slept.    Soon after this I began to suffer from fever, and I had to work very  hard indeed, as I was now on the ibex ground. For several days, though I  saw ibex, I was unable to get near them. Finally, on June 9th, I got my  first one, a young buck with small horns. I had to hunt way up the  mountain, even beyond bush vegetation, and the hot sun at midday was  awful. Nevertheless, by very hard climbing, I managed on this day to get  within shot first of a herd of nine females, which I did not touch, and  then of the young buck, which I killed. On June 13th, by another  heart-breaking climb, very high up, I got a second small buck. I did not  get back to camp that night till half past 9--tired out, feet badly cut  with the stones and bruised all over; but in spite of the fever I  enjoyed every day--the scenery was so grand and the life so  exhilarating. Four days afterwards came a red-letter day. I started  early in the morning, clambering up among the high mountains. Until noon  I saw nothing; then several flocks of ibex came in sight, one of them of  eleven big bucks. I had to wait four hours to get into a position to  stalk; then by quick work and awful climbing I came within close range  and killed three. It was half past 10 in the evening before I got back  to camp, very nearly done up, but exultant over my good luck.    The traveling now became very severe and I had a great deal of  difficulty even with the coolies, and though I hunted hard I got little  game until July 8th. I had been shifting, trying to get on markhoor  ground, and on this day I killed my first markhoor. The shikaris and I  left the coolies to go around the path while we went over the mountain,  a five hours' climb, keeping a sharp lookout for game. Just at the  beginning of the ascent we saw three fine-looking markhoor grazing in a  nullah, and after a stalk of about a mile, during which time it began to  rain, the beasts went into a jungle on the steep side of the mountain.  Through this we still-hunted and I got a shot through the bushes at 100  yards. By good luck I hit and great was the rejoicing. Five days later I  got two ibex, which at a distance we had mistaken for markhoor. Then I  was attacked by a terrible dysentery and was within an ace of dying. For  a fortnight I was unable to leave camp, excepting when I was carried  slowly along by the coolies in the effort to get me out of the  mountains. On August 1st I shot a second markhoor. We were journeying at  the time. In the very rough places I had to walk, though awfully weak;  elsewhere the coolies carried me. The markhoor was just below us, round  a turn in the Indus Valley. I was in advance with one of the shikaris  and got a quiet shot, and more by good luck than anything else--for I  was very weak--I killed. I now began gradually to pick up strength, and  when near Astor I got a urial, a kind of wild sheep.    I had no other experience of note till I got back to Siringur, where I  stayed to recuperate, and at the end of August went off once more into  the foothills, this time after barramigh. In a week's work I killed  three, but again became sick, and had to give up and come in.    I forthwith returned to India, the hot weather being by this time pretty  well over. As I was very anxious to kill an elephant, I went down to  Ceylon, reaching that island the end of October and going out to Kandy.  I met a number of Englishmen, who were very kind to me, as were some  Eurasian gentlemen. On November 16th I left Minerva for a regular hunt.  It was very interesting shooting through the tropical jungle and I had  good luck. There were plenty of elephants, but at first I didn't get  any, though I shot five spotted deer and a boar. Finally, however, I got  two of the big brutes I was mainly after. One of them, which I killed on  the 20th of the month, was said to be a rogue that had killed two  villagers and done at intervals a good deal of damage to the crops. An  old native tracker had guaranteed to show me this elephant. He kept his  word. For three or four miles we had a very exciting track, and then  came on him standing in the jungle, occasionally flapping his ears, and  crept up to within thirty yards. I think he was asleep and I got a  perfectly good shot, but, extraordinary to say, I missed. However, when  he ran I went after him, and, getting very close, I shot him in the hip,  so injuring his leg that he could not get away. He could still get round  after us, and we passed a most lively half-hour, he trumpeting and  charging incessantly, until, after expending a great quantity of  cartridges, I finally put a bullet behind his eye, and down he went.    Soon after this I went back to Kandy, and early in December left India  for good.    _Elliott Roosevelt._          [Illustration: HOW OUR OUTFIT WAS CARRIED.]    Dog Sledging in the North      A good many years ago, my friends, Boies Penrose, Granville Keller, and  I concluded that it would be a fitting termination to a very successful  summer and fall hunting trip in the Rocky Mountains to endeavor to kill  some moose and caribou in the Lake Winnipeg country, Manitoba. Thus we  should combine very different kinds of sport amid surroundings more  dissimilar than we imagined at the time. The whole of this rather  memorable trip occupied nearly six months.    Our adventures during the latter part of the hunt, that is, during our  sojourn in the far north--while a part of the every-day experience of  those familiar with the winter life in the woods of that country--were  of a character totally unknown to the majority of sportsmen in the  United States, and for this reason it has been thought worth while to  give a short account of them.    If my recollection serves me correctly, we arrived at Selkirk, at the  lower end of Lake Winnipeg, in the latter part of October, to find  navigation already closed. We had hoped to reach the upper part of the  lake by means of a steamer, but found this impossible, and were  therefore obliged to go on sleds to our first hunting ground--a moose  country to the south of the head waters of the Fisher River, between  Lake Winnipeg and Lake Winnipegosis.    At Selkirk we were joined by a Mr. Phillips, and we had there employed  an Indian boy to look after the dogs. This Indian was a magnificent  specimen physically, and certainly the best walker that I have ever  known. With the exception of a pardonable fondness for our whisky, he  behaved very well at first, but afterward became so insufferably lazy  that he was scarcely fit for the simple work of driving one of the dog  teams--a change which"]]]
