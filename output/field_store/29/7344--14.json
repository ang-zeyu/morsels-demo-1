The corporal then led off his band to the spot where he last saw traces  of the animal, and tracked on till sundown; while Grant and myself went  out pot-hunting and brought home a bag consisting of one striped  eland, one saltiana antelope, four guinea-fowl, four ringdoves, and one  partridge--a welcome supply, considering we were quite out of flesh.    Next day, as there were no signs of the trackers, I went again to the  place of the elands, wounded a fine male, but gave up the chase, as I  heard the unmistakable gun-firing return of the party, and straightway  proceeded to camp. Sure enough, there they were; they had tracked the  animal back to Marenga Mkhali, through jungle--for he had not taken to  the footpath. Then finding he had gone on, they returned quite tired  and famished. To make the most of a bad job, I now sent Grant on to the  Robeho (or windy) Pass, on the top of the western chain, with the mules  and heavy baggage, and directions to proceed thence across the brow of  the hill the following morning, while I remained behind with the tired  men, promising to join him by breakfast-time. I next released the  prisoners, much to their disgust, for they had not known such good  feeding before, and dreaded being turned adrift again in the jungles to  live on calabash seeds; and then, after shooting six guinea-fowl, turned  in for the night.    Betimes in the morning we were off, mounting the Robeho, a good stiff  ascent, covered with trees and large blocks of granite, excepting only  where cleared for villages; and on we went rapidly, until at noon the  advance party was reached, located in a village overlooking the great  interior plateau--a picture, as it were, of the common type of African  scenery. Here, taking a hasty meal, we resumed the march all together,  descended the great western chain, and, as night set in, camped in a  ravine at the foot of it, not far from the great junction-station Ugogi,  where terminate the hills of Usagara.

Making a double march of it, we first stopped to  breakfast at the quiet little settlement of Inenge, where cattle were  abundant, but grain so scarce that the villagers were living on calabash  seeds. Proceeding thence across fields delightfully checkered with  fine calabash and fig trees, we marched, carrying water through thorny  jungles, until dark, when we bivouacked for the night, only to rest  and push on again next morning, arriving at Marenga Mkhali (the saline  water) to breakfast. Here a good view of the Usagara hills is obtained.  Carrying water with us, we next marched half-way to the first settlement  of Ugogo, and bivouacked again, to eat the last of our store of Mbumi  grain.    At length the greater famine lands had been spanned; but we were not  in lands of plenty--for the Wagogo we found, like their neighbours  Wasagara, eating the seed of the calabash, to save their small stores of  grain.    The East Coast Range having been passed, no more hills had to be  crossed, for the land we next entered on is a plateau of rolling ground,  sloping southward to the Ruaha river, which forms a great drain running  from west to east, carrying off all the rainwaters that fall in its  neighbourhood through the East Coast Range to the sea. To the northward  can be seen some low hills, which are occupied by Wahumba, a subtribe  of the warlike Masai; and on the west is the large forest-wilderness of  Mgunda Mkhali. Ugogo, lying under the lee side of the Usagara hills,  is comparatively sterile. Small outcrops of granite here and there poke  through the surface, which, like the rest of the rolling land, being  covered with bush, principally acacias, have a pleasing appearance after  the rains have set in, but are too brown and desert-looking during  the rest of the year. Large prairies of grass also are exposed in many  places, and the villagers have laid much ground bare for agricultural  purposes.    Altogether, Ugogo has a very wild aspect, well in keeping with the  natives who occupy it, who, more like the Wazaramo than the Wasagara,  carry arms, intended for use rather than show. The men, indeed, are  never seen without their usual arms--the spear, the shield, and the  assage. They live in flat-topped, square, tembe villages, wherever  springs of water are found, keep cattle in plenty, and farm enough  generally to supply not only their own wants, but those of the thousands  who annually pass in caravans. They are extremely fond of ornaments,  the most common of which is an ugly tube of the gourd thrust through the  lower lobe of the ear. Their colour is a soft ruddy brown, with a slight  infusion of black, not unlike that of a rich plum. Impulsive by  nature, and exceedingly avaricious, they pester travellers beyond all  conception, by thronging the road, jeering, quizzing, and pointing at  them; and in camp, by intrusively forcing their way into the midst of  the kit, and even into the stranger's tent. Caravans, in consequence,  never enter their villages, but camp outside, generally under the big  \"gouty-limbed\" trees--encircling their entire camp sometimes with a  ring-fence of thorns to prevent any sudden attack.    To resume the thread of the journey: we found, on arrival in Ugogo, very  little more food than in Usagara for the Wagogo were mixing their small  stores of grain with the monkey-bread seeds of the gouty-limbed tree.  Water was so scarce in the wells at this season that we had to buy it  at the normal price of country beer; and, as may be imagined where such  distress in food was existing, cows, goats, sheep, and fowls were also  selling at high rates.    Our mules here gave us the slip again, and walked all the way back to  Marenga Mkhali, where they were found and brought back by some Wagogo,  who took four yards of merikani in advance, with a promise of four more  on return, for the job--their chief being security for their fidelity.  This business detained us two days, during which time I shot a new  variety of florikan, peculiar in having a light blue band stretching  from the nose over the eye to the occiput. Each day, while we resided  here, cries were raised by the villagers that the Wahumba were coming,  and then all the cattle out in the plains, both far and near, were  driven into the village for protection.    At last, on the 26th, as the mules were brought it, I paid a hongo or  tax of four barsati and four yards of chintz to the chief, and departed,  but not until one of my porters, a Mhehe, obtained a fat dog for his  dinner; he had set his heart on it, and would not move until he had  killed it, and tied it on to his load for the evening's repast. Passing  through the next villages--a collection called Kifukuro--we had to pay  another small tax of two barsati and four yards of chintz to the chief.  There we breakfasted, and pushed on, carrying water to a bivouac in the  jungles, as the famine precluded our taking the march more easily.    Pushing on again, we cleared out of the woods, and arrived at the  eastern border of the largest clearance of Ugogo, Kanyenye. Here we  were forced to halt a day, as the mules were done up, and eight of the  Wanyamuezi porters absconded, carrying with them the best part of their  loads. There was also another inducement for stopping here; for, after  stacking the loads, as we usually did on arriving in camp, against a  large gouty-limbed tree, a hungry Mgogo, on eyeing our guns, offered  his services to show us some bicornis rhinoceros, which, he said paid  nightly visits to certain bitter pools that lay in the nullah bottoms  not far off. This exciting intelligence made me inquire if it was not  possible to find them at once; but, being assured that they lived very  far off, and that the best chance was the night, I gave way, and settled  on starting at ten, to arrive at the ground before the full moon should  rise.    I set forth with the guide and two of the sheikh's boys, each carrying  a single rifle, and ensconced myself in the nullah, to hide until our  expected visitors should arrive, and there remained until midnight. When  the hitherto noisy villagers turned into bed, the silvery moon shed her  light on the desolate scene, and the Mgogo guide, taking fright, bolted.  He had not, however, gone long, when, looming above us, coming over the  horizon line, was the very animal we wanted.    In a fidgety manner the beast then descended, as if he expected some  danger in store--and he was not wrong; for, attaching a bit of white  paper to the fly-sight of my Blissett, I approached him, crawling under  cover of the banks until within eighty yards of him, when, finding that  the moon shone full on his flank, I raised myself upright and planted a  bullet behind his left shoulder. Thus died my first rhinoceros.    To make the most of the night, as I wanted meat for my men to cook, as  well as a stock to carry with them, or barter with the villagers for  grain, I now retired to my old position, and waited again.    After two hours had elapsed, two more rhinoceros approached me in the  same stealthy, fidgety way as the first one."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3287"],[0,"The Man from Glengarry: A Tale of the Ottawa (#14)"],[1,"tudy.    But he could have adopted no better means of awakening Maimie's interest  in Ranald than by the recital of his various escapades. Women love good  men, but are interested in men whose goodness is more or less impaired.  So Maimie was determined that she would know more of Ranald, and hence  took every opportunity of encouraging Hughie to sing the praises of his  hero and recount his many adventures. She was glad, too, that her aunt  had fixed the sugaring-off for a time when she could be present. But  neither at church on Sunday nor during the week that followed did she  catch sight of his face, and though Hughie came in with excited reports  now and then of having seen or heard of Ranald, Maimie had to content  herself with these; and, indeed, were it not that the invitation had  already been given, and the day fixed for her visit to the camp, the  chances are that Maimie's acquaintance with Ranald would have ended  where it began, in which case both had been saved many bitter days.        CHAPTER VIII    THE SUGARING-OFF      The sugar time is, in many ways, the best of all the year. It is  the time of crisp mornings, when \"the crust bears,\" and the boys go  crunching over all the fields and through the woods; the time, too, of  sunny noons and chilly nights. Winter is still near, but he has lost  most of his grip, and all his terror. For the earth has heard the call  of spring from afar, and knows that soon she will be seen, dancing her  shy dances, in the sunny spaces of the leafless woods. Then, by and by,  from all the open fields the snow is driven back into the fence corners,  and lies there in soiled and sullen heaps. In the woods it still lies  deep; but there is everywhere the tinkle of running water, and it is not  long till the brown leaf carpet begins to show in patches through the  white. Then, overhead, the buds begin to swell and thrill with the new  life, and when it is broad noon, all through the woods a thousand voices  pass the glad word that winter's day is gone and that all living things  are free. But when night draws up over the treetops, and the shadows  steal down the forest aisles, the jubilant voices die down and a chill  fear creeps over all the gleeful, swelling buds that they have been  too sure and too happy; and all the more if, from the northeast, there  sweeps down, as often happens, a stinging storm of sleet and snow,  winter's last savage slap. But what matters that? The very next  day, when the bright, warm rays trickle down through the interlacing  branches, bathing the buds and twigs and limbs and trunks and flooding  all the woods, the world grows surer of its new joy. And so, in  alternating hope and fear, the days and nights go by, till an evening  falls when the air is languid and a soft rain comes up from the south,  falling all night long over the buds and trees like warm, loving  fingers. Then the buds break for very joy, and timid green things push  up through the leaf-mold; and from the swamps the little frogs begin  to pipe, at first in solo, but soon in exultant chorus, till the whole  moist night is vocal, and then every one knows that the sugar time is  over, and troughs and spiles are gathered up, and with sap-barrels and  kettles, are stored in the back shed for another year.    But no rain came before the night fixed for the sugaring-off. It was a  perfect sugar day, warm, bright, and still, following a night of sharp  frost. The long sunny afternoon was deepening into twilight when the  Camerons drove up to the sugar-camp in their big sleigh, bringing with  them the manse party. Ranald and Don, with Aunt Kirsty, were there to  receive them. It was one of those rare evenings of the early Canadian  spring. The bare woods were filled with the tangled rays of light from  the setting sun. Here and there a hillside facing the east lay in  shadow that grew black where the balsams and cedars stood in clumps. But  everywhere else the light fell sweet and silent about the bare trunks,  filling the long avenues under the arching maple limbs with a yellow  haze.    In front of the shanty the kettles hung over the fire on a long pole  which stood in an upright crutch at either end. Under the big kettle the  fire was roaring high, for the fresh sap needed much boiling before the  syrup and taffy could come. But under the little kettle the fire burned  low, for that must not be hurried.    Over the fire and the kettles Ranald presided, black, grimy, and silent,  and to Don fell the duty of doing the honors of the camp; and right  worthily did he do his part. He greeted his mother with reverence,  cuffed his young brother, kissed his little sister Jennie, tossing her  high, and welcomed with warm heartiness Mrs. Murray and her niece. The  Airds had not yet come, but all the rest were there. The Finlaysons and  the McKerachers, Dan Campbell's boys, and their sister Betsy, whom every  one called \"Betsy Dan,\" redheaded, freckled, and irrepressible; the  McGregors, and a dozen or more of the wildest youngsters that could be  found in all the Indian Lands. Depositing their baskets in the shanty,  for they had no thought of fasting, they crowded about the fire.    \"Attention!\" cried Don, who had a \"gift of the gab,\" as his mother  said. \"Ladies and gentlemen, the program for this evening is as follows:  games, tea, and taffy, in the order mentioned. In the first, all MUST  take part; in the second, all MAY take part; but in the third, none NEED  take part.\"    After the laughter and the chorus of \"Ohs\" had subsided, Don proceeded:  \"The captains for the evening are, Elizabeth Campbell, better known  as 'Betsy Dan,' and John Finlayson, familiar to us all as 'Johnnie the  Widow,' two young people of excellent character, and I believe, slightly  known to each other.\"    Again a shout went up from the company, but Betsy Dan, who cared not at  all for Don's banter, contented herself with pushing out her lower lip  at him with scorn, in that indescribable manner natural to girls, but to  boys impossible.    Then the choosing began. Betsy Dan, claiming first choice by virtue of  her sex, immediately called out, \"Ranald Macdonald.\"    But Ranald shook his head. \"I cannot leave the fire,\" he said, blushing;  \"take Don there.\"    But Betsy demurred. \"I don't want Don,\" she cried. \"Come on, Ranald; the  fire will do quite well.\" Betsy, as indeed did most of the school-girls,  adored Ranald in her secret heart, though she scorned to show it.    But Ranald still refused, till Don said, \"It is too bad, Betsy, but  you'll have to take me.\"    \"Oh, come on, then!\" laughed Betsy; \"you will be better than nobody.\"    Then it was Johnnie the Widow's choice: \"Maimie St. Clair.\"    Maimie hesitated and looked at her aunt, who said, \"Yes, go, my dear, if  you would like.\"    \"Marget Aird!\" cried Betsy, spying Marget and her brothers coming down  the road. \"Come along, Marget; you are on my side--on Don's side, I  mean.\" At which poor Marget, a tall, fair girl, with sweet face and shy  manner, blushed furiously, but, after greeting the minister's wife and  the rest of the older people, she took her place beside Don.    The choosing went on till every one present was taken, not even Aunt  Kirsty being allowed to remain neutral in the coming games. For an hour  the sports went on. Racing, jumping, bear, London bridge, crack the  whip, and lastly, forfeits.    Meantime Ranald superintended the sap-boiling, keeping on the opposite  side of the fire from the ladies, and answering in monosyllables any  questions addressed to him. But when it was time to make the tea, Mrs.  Cameron and Kirsty insisted on taking charge of this, and Mrs. Murray,  coming round to Ranald, said: \"Now, Ranald, I came to learn all about  sugar-making, and while the others are making tea, I want you to teach  me how to make sugar.\"    Ranald gladly agreed to show her all he knew. He had been feeling  awkward and miserable in the noisy crowd, but especially in the presence  of Maimie. He had not forgotten the smile of amusement with which  she had greeted him at the manse, and his wounded pride longed for an  opportunity to pour upon her the vials of his contempt. But somehow,  in her presence, contempt would not arise within him, and he was driven  into wretched silence and self-abasement. It was, therefore, with  peculiar gratitude that he turned to Mrs. Murray as to one who both  understood and trusted him.    \"I thank you for the books, Mrs. Murray,\" he began, in a low, hurried  voice. \"They are just wonderful. That Rob Roy and Ivanhoe, oh! they are  the grand books.\" His face was fairly blazing with enthusiasm. \"I never  knew there were such books at all.\"    \"I am very glad you like them, Ranald,\" said Mrs. Murray, in tones of  warm sympathy, \"and I shall give you as many as you like.\"    \"I cannot thank you enough. I have not the words,\" said the boy, looking  as if he might fall down at her feet. Mrs. Murray was greatly touched  both by his enthusiasm and his gratitude.    \"It is a great pleasure to me, Ranald, that you like them,\" she said,  earnestly. \"I want you to love good books and good men and noble deeds.\"    Ranald stood listening in silence.    \"Then some day you will be a good and great man yourself,\" she added,  \"and you will do some noble work.\"    The boy stood looking far away into the woods, his black eyes filled  with a mysterious fire. Suddenly he threw back his head and said, as  if he had forgotten Mrs. Murray's presence, \"Yes, some day I will be a  great man. I know it well.\"    \"And good,\" softly added Mrs. Murray.    He turned and looked at her a moment as if in a dream. Then, recalling  himself, he answered, \"I suppose that is the best.\"    \"Yes, it is the best, Ranald,\" she replied. \"No man is great who is not  good. But come now and give me my lesson.\"    Ranald stepped out into the bush, and from a tree near by he lifted a  trough of sap and emptied it into the big kettle.    \"That's"]]]
