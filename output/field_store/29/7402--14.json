The same house  had sold forty thousand copies of Macaulay's History of England, at  the end of the first three months, at prices varying from fifty cents  to four dollars, while other houses had sold twenty thousand copies,  and this sale of sixty thousand copies while Longman was selling  fifteen thousand at one pound twelve shillings.           *       *       *       *       *    The Countess HAHN-HAHN, who for several years has occupied in German  literature a position corresponding to that of George Sand in France,  with whose views of life and society she strongly sympathized, and  whose \"Faustina\" and other works were republished here, has recently  become a Roman Catholic, as our readers will have seen, and has just  written the following letter to a Hamburg journal:         \"To correct some misapprehension, I feel it to be my duty to       declare that the new edition of my complete works announced       by Alexander Duncker in Berlin is no new series, but an       edition with a new title. A new series of those writings       will never appear, as I no longer recognize as my own the       spirit in which they were written.                                 IDA, COUNTESS HAHN-HAHN.\"               *       *       *       *       *    DAVID COPPERFIELD has been translated into German, with the  peculiarities of speech of the different classes of characters  unattempted. Old Pegotty and Ham speak \"pure Castilian.\" It is easy to  see how the dramatic character of the book is thus lost. Indeed,  Dickens is almost the only very famous English author who is not much  translated. The Battle of Life, one of the least valuable and  characteristic of his works, is well known upon the Continent, because  it was so easy to translate. But what can a descendant of Dante, for  instance, ever know of the drolleries of Sam Weller? Fancy a  _spiritual_ Frenchman trying to catch the fun of Pickwick!           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Judd's _Richard Edney_ induces a German critic to say of him,  \"This is a new English poet of the Carlyle and Emerson school, who,  inspired by the example of Jean Paul, turn the English language  topsy-turvy, and introduce a jargon that makes us satisfied with our  own romantic barbarism.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mrs. S. C. HALL'S _Sorrows of Women_ has been also translated into  German, and is highly praised.           *       *       *       *       *    In Vienna, most of the recent publications have more or less relation  to affairs. There is very little of pure literature. M. de Zsedenyi,  one of the most capable Hungarian political writers, has published a  work entitled _Responsibility of the Cabinet and the State of  Hungary_. The author of _The Genesis of the Revolution_, (supposed to  be Count Hartig, who was a Minister without portfolio under Prince  Metternich) has again appeared before the public with 146 closely  printed pages of _Night Thoughts_, some of which had better never have  seen the light of day. A Mr. Schwarz has published a work advocating  \"protection,\" and in it he spares neither England nor the Austrian  Minister of Commerce. Free trade notions have indeed been attacked in  a score of books by continental thinkers lately, and free trade  opinions seem to have received, throughout Europe, a most decided  check.           *       *       *       *       *    The late Prince VALDIMAR, of Russia, made three or four years ago a  journey to India, and besides taking part with the British army in  sundry engagements, occupied himself busily in investigating the  manners and customs of the people, the antiquities, history, and  natural productions of the country. He wrote an account of his  journey, and illustrated it with numerous drawings. His family is now  causing this to be printed and the drawings to be engraved, and in a  short time the work will be completed. Only three hundred copies are  to be struck off, and they are to be presented to royal and  illustrious personages. The getting up of the publication will cost  40,000 thalers.           *       *       *       *       *    M. LEON DE MONBEILLARD has written a little treatise upon the _Ethics  of Spinoza_, in which--being a spiritualist who admits the dogma of  the creation and of human personality--he is said to have refuted the  great philosopher, yet without calumniating or disfiguring his  doctrines, and with a constant admiration of all that is truly  admirable in Spinoza.    The work has not yet crossed the sea, but we cannot help thinking that  the colossal views of so great a mind are not to be entirely disproved  in the delicate dimensions of an \"_opuscule_,\" as the able little  treatise of M. Montbeillard is called by the critics.           *       *       *       *       *    JOSEPH RUSSEGGER, imperial director of the mines at Schemnitz, has  published the results of five years' travel in Europe, Asia, and  Africa, comprising a universal scientific and artistic as well as  social and picturesque view of those countries. It is in four volumes,  very splendidly illustrated in all these departments, and is published  at a cost of forty dollars.           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. DAVID FRIEDRICH STRAUSS, the famous rationalist, has published a  work entitled _Christian Marklein_, a picture of life and character  from the present time, giving charming if not very new views of the  Wurtemberg theological schools.           *       *       *       *       *    In the _German Universities_, it appears from the census just taken,  with the exceptions of those of Koenigsberg, Kiel, and Rostock, the  numbers for which have not been officially returned, there were for  the last term on the registers 11,945 students. The universities may  be classed, according to the number of students at each, in this  order: Berlin, Munich, Bonn, Leipsic, Breslau, Tubingen, Goettingen,  Wurzburg, Halle, Heidelberg, Giessen, Erlangen, Friburg, Jena,  Marburg, Greifswalde. Berlin has 2,107 students, and Greifswalde only  189. The number studying the law is 3,973; of theological students,  2,539; pursuing the study of philosophy and philology, 2,357; medical  students, 2,146; and there are 549 engaged in political economy. Halle  reckons the greatest proportional number of theological students,  there being 330 out of a total of 597; Heidelberg has most students of  law; Wurzburg, most of medicine; and Jena, most students of theology.  The greatest numbers of foreign students are to be found at  Heidelberg, Gottingen, Jena, Wurzburg, and Leipsic.           *       *       *       *       *    The _Independence Belge_ gives an account of Frau Pfeiffer, a woman  who left Vienna several years ago to travel alone in the most distant  and unfrequented parts of the world. After visiting Palestine and  Egypt, Scandinavia and Iceland, she landed in Brazil, penetrated the  primitive forests, and lived among the natives; from Valparaiso she  traversed the Pacific to Otaheite, thence to China, Singapore, Ceylon,  Hindostan, to the caves of Adjunta and Ellora to Bombay, whence she  sailed up the Tigris, to Bagdad, and then entered upon the arduous  journey to Babylon, Nineveh, and into Kurdistan; and passing to the  Caucasus, she embarked for Constantinople, visiting Greece in her way  home to Germany. She is now in London, visiting the Great Exposition.           *       *       *       *       *    FERDINAND HILLER, Superintendent of the Cologne Musical Academy, and a  contemporary and friend of Mendelssohn, whom, in the beginning, it was  supposed he would surpass as a composer, has been recently in Paris,  renewing his old experiences. He saw there most of the famous literary  and artistic notabilities, and gossips pleasantly about them in the  _feuilleton_ of a German journal. He saw Henry Heine, whose body is  almost dead, but whose mind is as vigorous as ever. Hiller says that  Heine chatted with him about God and himself, of the King of Prussia,  and of Hiller--of the Frankfort Parliament and his own songs. Heine's  features, he says, are interesting, and even more beautiful than they  were formerly. The fallen cheeks leave the noble oval of the head and  the delicately chiselled nose mournfully apparent. The eyes are  closed. He can only see with the left, by elevating the lid with his  finger. He wears a close-trimmed beard, and his hair is as brown and  luxuriant as ever. The slim white hand is ideally beautiful. It  belongs, according to the doctrine of Carns, to the class of the  purely psychological. Heine had just written a song for a German  composer; and that no poet can sing more sweetly for music, the many  of his verses which Schubert has \"married to immortal\" tune  sufficiently indicate. Mendelssohn also composed the most dreamily  delicate music to Heine's \"Moonlight on the Ganges.\"    Ingres, the painter, now seventy years old, the pride and model of the  severe classicists of the French school, is a comely old man, with  rich dark hair, luminous eye, and smooth brow. He is still light and  active in movement, and a genial serenity broods over his whole  character and manner. His love of music is no less enthusiastic than  that of a lover for his mistress. The great German composers are great  gods to Ingres. The remembrance of a beautiful sonata fills his eyes  with tears. Ingres has recently finished a portrait, which is not  inferior to any thing he has ever done.    Of musical men, Hiller saw Halevy, a successful composer and genial  companion, with a gentle strain of irony in his conversation. Hector  Berlioz has not grown to be fifty without some of the snowy tracks of  time, but the volcanic genius is still alive. His conversation is like  an eruption, now a burning lava-stream of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3623"],[0,"The Golden Bough: A Study of Magic and Religion (#14)"],[1,"application of the maxim that like produces like is seen in  the Chinese belief that the fortunes of a town are deeply affected  by its shape, and that they must vary according to the character of  the thing which that shape most nearly resembles. Thus it is related  that long ago the town of Tsuen-cheu-fu, the outlines of which are  like those of a carp, frequently fell a prey to the depredations of  the neighbouring city of Yung-chun, which is shaped like a  fishing-net, until the inhabitants of the former town conceived the  plan of erecting two tall pagodas in their midst. These pagodas,  which still tower above the city of Tsuen-cheu-fu, have ever since  exercised the happiest influence over its destiny by intercepting  the imaginary net before it could descend and entangle in its meshes  the imaginary carp. Some forty years ago the wise men of Shanghai  were much exercised to discover the cause of a local rebellion. On  careful enquiry they ascertained that the rebellion was due to the  shape of a large new temple which had most unfortunately been built  in the shape of a tortoise, an animal of the very worst character.  The difficulty was serious, the danger was pressing; for to pull  down the temple would have been impious, and to let it stand as it  was would be to court a succession of similar or worse disasters.  However, the genius of the local professors of geomancy, rising to  the occasion, triumphantly surmounted the difficulty and obviated  the danger. By filling up two wells, which represented the eyes of  the tortoise, they at once blinded that disreputable animal and  rendered him incapable of doing further mischief.    Sometimes homoeopathic or imitative magic is called in to annul an  evil omen by accomplishing it in mimicry. The effect is to  circumvent destiny by substituting a mock calamity for a real one.  In Madagascar this mode of cheating the fates is reduced to a  regular system. Here every man's fortune is determined by the day or  hour of his birth, and if that happens to be an unlucky one his fate  is sealed, unless the mischief can be extracted, as the phrase goes,  by means of a substitute. The ways of extracting the mischief are  various. For example, if a man is born on the first day of the  second month (February), his house will be burnt down when he comes  of age. To take time by the forelock and avoid this catastrophe, the  friends of the infant will set up a shed in a field or in the  cattle-fold and burn it. If the ceremony is to be really effective,  the child and his mother should be placed in the shed and only  plucked, like brands, from the burning hut before it is too late.  Again, dripping November is the month of tears, and he who is born  in it is born to sorrow. But in order to disperse the clouds that  thus gather over his future, he has nothing to do but to take the  lid off a boiling pot and wave it about. The drops that fall from it  will accomplish his destiny and so prevent the tears from trickling  from his eyes. Again, if fate has decreed that a young girl, still  unwed, should see her children, still unborn, descend before her  with sorrow to the grave, she can avert the calamity as follows. She  kills a grasshopper, wraps it in a rag to represent a shroud, and  mourns over it like Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to  be comforted. Moreover, she takes a dozen or more other  grasshoppers, and having removed some of their superfluous legs and  wings she lays them about their dead and shrouded fellow. The buzz  of the tortured insects and the agitated motions of their mutilated  limbs represent the shrieks and contortions of the mourners at a  funeral. After burying the deceased grasshopper she leaves the rest  to continue their mourning till death releases them from their pain;  and having bound up her dishevelled hair she retires from the grave  with the step and carriage of a person plunged in grief. Thenceforth  she looks cheerfully forward to seeing her children survive her; for  it cannot be that she should mourn and bury them twice over. Once  more, if fortune has frowned on a man at his birth and penury has  marked him for her own, he can easily erase the mark in question by  purchasing a couple of cheap pearls, price three halfpence, and  burying them. For who but the rich of this world can thus afford to  fling pearls away?        3. Contagious Magic    THUS far we have been considering chiefly that branch of sympathetic  magic which may be called homoeopathic or imitative. Its leading  principle, as we have seen, is that like produces like, or, in other  words, that an effect resembles its cause. The other great branch of  sympathetic magic, which I have called Contagious Magic, proceeds  upon the notion that things which have once been conjoined must  remain ever afterwards, even when quite dissevered from each other,  in such a sympathetic relation that whatever is done to the one must  similarly affect the other. Thus the logical basis of Contagious  Magic, like that of Homoeopathic Magic, is a mistaken association of  ideas; its physical basis, if we may speak of such a thing, like the  physical basis of Homoeopathic Magic, is a material medium of some  sort which, like the ether of modern physics, is assumed to unite  distant objects and to convey impressions from one to the other. The  most familiar example of Contagious Magic is the magical sympathy  which is supposed to exist between a man and any severed portion of  his person, as his hair or nails; so that whoever gets possession of  human hair or nails may work his will, at any distance, upon the  person from whom they were cut. This superstition is world-wide;  instances of it in regard to hair and nails will be noticed later on  in this work.    Among the Australian tribes it was a common practice to knock out  one or more of a boy's front teeth at those ceremonies of initiation  to which every male member had to submit before he could enjoy the  rights and privileges of a full-grown man. The reason of the  practice is obscure; all that concerns us here is the belief that a  sympathetic relation continued to exist between the lad and his  teeth after the latter had been extracted from his gums. Thus among  some of the tribes about the river Darling, in New South Wales, the  extracted tooth was placed under the bark of a tree near a river or  water-hole; if the bark grew over the tooth, or if the tooth fell  into the water, all was well; but if it were exposed and the ants  ran over it, the natives believed that the boy would suffer from a  disease of the mouth. Among the Murring and other tribes of New  South Wales the extracted tooth was at first taken care of by an old  man, and then passed from one headman to another, until it had gone  all round the community, when it came back to the lad's father, and  finally to the lad himself. But however it was thus conveyed from  hand to hand, it might on no account be placed in a bag containing  magical substances, for to do so would, they believed, put the owner  of the tooth in great danger. The late Dr. Howitt once acted as  custodian of the teeth which had been extracted from some novices at  a ceremony of initiation, and the old men earnestly besought him not  to carry them in a bag in which they knew that he had some quartz  crystals. They declared that if he did so the magic of the crystals  would pass into the teeth, and so injure the boys. Nearly a year  after Dr. Howitt's return from the ceremony he was visited by one of  the principal men of the Murring tribe, who had travelled some two  hundred and fifty miles from his home to fetch back the teeth. This  man explained that he had been sent for them because one of the boys  had fallen into ill health, and it was believed that the teeth had  received some injury which had affected him. He was assured that the  teeth had been kept in a box apart from any substances, like quartz  crystals, which could influence them; and he returned home bearing  the teeth with him carefully wrapt up and concealed.    The Basutos are careful to conceal their extracted teeth, lest these  should fall into the hands of certain mythical beings who haunt  graves, and who could harm the owner of the tooth by working magic  on it. In Sussex some fifty years ago a maid-servant remonstrated  strongly against the throwing away of children's cast teeth,  affirming that should they be found and gnawed by any animal, the  child's new tooth would be, for all the world, like the teeth of the  animal that had bitten the old one. In proof of this she named old  Master Simmons, who had a very large pig's tooth in his upper jaw, a  personal defect that he always averred was caused by his mother, who  threw away one of his cast teeth by accident into the hog's trough.  A similar belief has led to practices intended, on the principles of  homoeopathic magic, to replace old teeth by new and better ones.  Thus in many parts of the world it is customary to put extracted  teeth in some place where they will be found by a mouse or a rat, in  the hope that, through the sympathy which continues to subsist  between them and their former owner, his other teeth may acquire the  same firmness and excellence as the teeth of these rodents. For  example, in Germany it is said to be an almost universal maxim among  the people that when you have had a tooth taken out you should  insert it in a mouse's hole. To do so with a child's milk-tooth  which has fallen out will prevent the child from having toothache.  Or you should go behind the stove and throw your tooth backwards  over your head, saying \"Mouse, give me your iron tooth; I will give  you my bone tooth.\" After that your other teeth will remain good.  Far away from Europe, at Raratonga, in the Pacific, when a child's  tooth was extracted, the following prayer used to be recited:          \"Big rat! little rat!       Here is my old tooth.       Pray give"]]]
