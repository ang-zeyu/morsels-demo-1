Stark walked across the glowing ice of the valley,  toward the cairn. The sword of Ban Cruach hung at his side. He had taken  the talisman and replaced it in the boss, and he was himself again.    Ciara and Balin walked beside him. The color had come back into their  faces, but faintly, and they were still weak enough to be glad of  Stark's hands to steady them.    At the foot of the cairn they stopped, and Stark mounted it alone.    He looked for a long moment into the face of Ban Cruach. Then he took  the sword, and carefully turned the rings upon it so that the radiation  spread out as it had before, to close the Gates of Death.    Almost reverently, he replaced the sword in Ban Cruach's hands. Then he  turned and went down over the tumbled stones.    The shimmering darkness brooded still over the distant tower. Underneath  the ice, the elfin city still spread downward. The shining ones would  rebuild their bridges in the shaft, and go on as they had before,  dreaming their cold dreams of ancient power.    But they would not go out through the Gates of Death. Ban Cruach in his  rusty mail was still lord of the pass, the warder of the Norlands.    Stark said to the others, \"Tell the story in Kushat. Tell it through the  Norlands, the story of Ban Cruach and why he guards the Gates of Death.  Men have forgotten. And they should not forget.\"    They went out of the valley then, the two men and the woman. They did  not speak again, and the way out through the pass seemed endless.    Some of Ciara's chieftains met them at the mouth of the pass above  Kushat. They had waited there, ashamed to return to the city without  her, but not daring to go back into the pass again. They had seen the  creatures of the valley, and they were still afraid.    They gave mounts to the three. They themselves walked behind Ciara, and  their heads were low with shame.    They came into Kushat through the riven gate, and Stark went with Ciara  to the King City, where she made Balin follow too.    \"Your sister is there,\" she said. \"I have had her cared for.\"    The city was quiet, with the sullen apathy that follows after battle.  The men of Mekh cheered Ciara in the streets. She rode proudly, but  Stark saw that her face was gaunt and strained.    He, too, was marked deep by what he had seen and done, beyond the Gates  of Death.    They went up into the castle.    Thanis took Balin into her arms, and wept. She had lost her first wild  fury, and she could look at Ciara now with a restrained hatred that had  a tinge almost of admiration.    \"You fought for Kushat,\" she said, unwillingly, when she had heard the  story. \"For that, at least, I can thank you.\"    She went to Stark then, and looked up at him. \"Kushat, and my brother's  life....\" She kissed him, and there were tears on her lips. But she  turned to Ciara with a bitter smile.    \"No one can hold him, any more than the wind can be held. You will learn  that.\"    She went out then with Balin, and left Stark and Ciara alone, in the  chambers of the king.           *       *       *       *       *    Ciara said, \"The little one is very shrewd.\" She unbuckled the hauberk  and let it fall, standing slim in her tunic of black leather, and walked  to the tall windows that looked out upon the mountains. She leaned her  head wearily against the stone.    \"An evil day, an evil deed. And now I have Kushat to govern, with no  reward of power from beyond the Gates of Death. How man can be misled!\"    Stark poured wine from the flagon and brought it to her. She looked at  him over the rim of the cup, with a certain wry amusement.    \"The little one is shrewd, and she is right. I don't know that I can be  as wise as she.... Will you stay with me, Stark, or will you go?\"    He did not answer at once, and she asked him, \"What hunger drives you,  Stark? It is not conquest, as it was with me. What are you looking for  that you cannot find?\"    He thought back across the years, back to the beginning--to the boy  N'Chaka who had once been happy with Old One and little Tika, in the  blaze and thunder and bitter frosts of a valley in the Twilight Belt of  Mercury. He remembered how all that had ended, under the guns of the  miners--the men who were his own kind.    He shook his head. \"I don't know. It doesn't matter.\" He took her  between his two hands, feeling the strength and the splendor of her, and  it was oddly difficult to find words.    \"I want to stay, Ciara. Now, this minute, I could promise that I would  stay forever. But I know myself. You belong here, you will make Kushat  your own. I don't. Someday I will go.\"    Ciara nodded. \"My neck, also, was not made for chains, and one country  was too little to hold me. Very well, Stark. Let it be so.\"    She smiled, and let the wine-cup fall."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32677"],[0,"The Invention of the Sewing Machine (#14)"],[1,"MACHINE was another interesting  design patent. S. B. Ellithorp had received a mechanical patent for a  two-thread, stationary-bobbin machine on August 26, 1857. That same  month he published a picture of his machine, shown here as republished  in the _Sewing Machine News_, vol. 7, no. 11, November 1885. The machine  was designed in the shape of \"the ordinary gray squirrel so common  throughout this country--an animal that is selected as a type of  provident care and forethought, for its habits of frugality and for  making provision for seasons of scarcity and want in times of  plenty--and the different parts of the animal are each put to a useful  purpose; the moving power being placed within its body, the needle stock  through its head, one of its fore feet serving to guide the thread, and  the other to hold down the cloth while being sewed, and the tip of its  tail forming a support to the spool from which the thread is supplied.\"    Although the design patent was not secured until June 7, 1859, the  inventor was reported to have been perfecting his machine for  manufacture in 1857. Ellithorp planned \"to place them in market at a  price that will permit families and individuals that have heretofore  been deterred from purchasing a machine by the excessive and exorbitant  price charged for those now in use, to possess one.\" Patent rights were  sold under the name of Ellithorp & Fox, but the machine was never  manufactured on a large scale, if at all. No squirrel machines are known  to have survived. (Smithsonian photo 53112.)]    [Illustration: Figure 48.--HEYER'S POCKET SEWING MACHINE patent model,  November 17, 1863. This patent model is one piece, and measures about  two inches in height and two inches in length. It will stitch--but only  coarse, loosely woven fabrics. As can be expected, a great deal of  manual dexterity is required to compensate for the omission of  mechanical parts. Heyer advertised patent rights for sale, but evidence  of manufactured machines of this type has yet to be discovered.  (Smithsonian photo 18115-D[a].)]    [Illustration: Figure 49.--HEYER'S MACHINE as illustrated in _Scientific  American_, July 30, 1864. The smallest and most original of all the  attempts to simplify machine sewing, Heyer's machine, which made a  chainstitch, was constructed of a single strip of metal. The _Scientific  American_ stated: \"It is simply a steel spring ingeniously bent and  arranged and it is said to sew small articles very well. The whole  affair can easily be carried in the coat pocket.\"    One method of operation, vibrating with the finger, was illustrated. The  machine could be operated also by holding it in the hand and pressuring  it between two fingers. Cloth was inserted at _c_, and the prongs of the  spring feed _f_ carried it along after each stitch. It was stated that  the needle could be cut from the same strip of metal, but it was advised  also that the needle could be made as a separate piece and attached.

The patent  model above is a small brass implement with crimping gears that forced  the fabric onto an ordinary sewing needle. The full needle was then  removed from its position, and the thread was pulled through the fabric  by hand. (Smithsonian photo 45524.)]    [Illustration: THE FAIRY SEWING-MACHINE. A HOLIDAY GIFT FOR THE  WORK-TABLE    Figure 51.--ONE OF THE EARLY COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURERS of the Palmer  patent was Madame Demorest, a New York dressmaker. She advertised her  Fairy sewing machine in _Godey's Lady's Book_, vol. 66, 1863, and  stated: \"In the first place it will attract attention from its  diminutive, fairy-like size, and with the same ease with which it can be  carried, an important matter to a seamstress or dressmaker employed from  house to house ... What no other sewing machine attempts to do, it runs,  and does not stitch, it sews the more delicate materials an ordinary  sewing machine cuts or draws....\" (Smithsonian photo 43690.)]    [Illustration: Figure 52.--THE FAIRY SEWING MACHINE sold for five  dollars and was adequate for its advertised purpose, sewing or running  very lightweight fabrics. The machine was marked with the Palmer patent,  the date May 13, 1862, and the name \"Mme. Demorest.\"    A machine identical to the Fairy, but bearing both Palmer patent dates,  May 13, 1862, and June 19, 1863, and the name \"Gold Medal,\" was  manufactured by a less-scrupulous company. This machine was advertised  as follows: \"A first class sewing machine, handsomely ornamented, with  all working parts silver plated. Put up in a highly polished mahogany  case, packed ready for shipment. Price $10.00. This machine uses a  common sewing needle, is very simple. A child can operate it. Cash with  order.\" Some buyers felt they were swindled, as they had expected a  heavy-duty machine, but no recourse could be taken against the  advertiser. Another similar machine was also manufactured under the name  \"Little Gem.\" (Smithsonian photo 45525.)]    [Illustration: Figures 53 and 54.--RUNNING-STITCH MACHINES were also  attempted by several other inventors. Shaw & Clark, manufacturers of  chainstitch machines, patented this running-stitch machine on April 21,  1863. From the appearance of the patent model, it was already in  commercial production. On May 26, 1863, John D. Dale also received a  patent for an improvement related to the method of holding the needle  and regulating the stitches in a running-stitch machine. Dale's patent  model was a commercial machine.    John Heberling patented several improvements in 1878 and 1880. His  machine, which was a little larger and in appearance resembled a more  conventional type of sewing machine, was a commercial success.

In  a description of the new Willcox and Gibbs sewing machine the following  observation is made: \"It is astonishing how, in a few years, the sewing  machine has made such strides in popular favor, and become, from being a  mechanical wonder, a household necessity and extensive object of  manufacture. While the higher priced varieties have such a large sale,  it is no wonder that the cheaper ones sell in such tremendous  quantities, and that our inventors are always trying to produce  something new and cheap.\"    [68] Op. cit.

Notes on the Development and Commercial Use of the Sewing Machine      INTRODUCTION    While researching the history of the invention and the development of  the sewing machine, many items of related interest concerning the  machine's economic value came to light. The manufacture of the machines  was in itself a boost to the economy of the emerging \"industrial United  States,\" as was the production of attachments for specialized stitching  and the need for new types of needles and thread. Moreover, the  machine's ability to speed up production permitted it to permeate the  entire field of products manufactured by any type of stitching, from  umbrellas to tents. Since this aspect of the story was not completed for  this study, no attempt will be made to include any definitive statements  on the economic importance of the sewing machine at home or abroad. This  related information is of sufficient interest, however, to warrant  inclusion in this first Appendix. Perhaps these notes will suggest areas  of future research for students of American technology.      READY-MADE CLOTHING    Whether of the expensive or the inexpensive type, the sewing machine was  much more than a popular household appliance. Its introduction had  far-reaching effects on many different types of manufacturing  establishments as well as on the export trade. The newly developing  ready-made clothing industry was not only in a state of development to  welcome the new machine but also was, in all probability, responsible  for its immediate practical application and success.    Until the early part of the second quarter of the 19th century, the  ready-made clothing trade in the United States was confined almost  entirely to furnishing the clothing required by sailors about to ship  out to sea. The stores that kept these supplies were usually in the  neighborhood of wharf areas. But other than the needs of these seamen,  there was little market for ready-made goods. Out of necessity many of  the families in the early years in this country had made their own  clothing. As wealth was acquired and taste could be cultivated,  professional seamstresses and tailors were in increasing demand, moved  into the cities and towns, and even visited the smaller villages for as  long as their services were needed. At the same time a related trade was  also growing in the cities, especially in New York City, that of dealing  in second-hand clothing. Industrious persons bought up old clothes,  cleaned, repaired and refinished them, and sold the clothing to  immigrants and transients who wished to avoid the high cost of new  custom-made clothing.    The repairing of this second-hand clothing led to the purchase of cheap  cloth at auction--\"half-burnt,\" \"wet-goods,\" and other"]]]
