The former,  manipulated by Northern politicians, opposed that measure, lest it  should defeat the Republican party in the pending elections at the  North. This stultification of principle, of radical public sentiment,  stirred the soul of Miss Dickinson, and she desired to speak. But a  rule that none but delegates should be allowed that privilege,  prevented her. However, as the Southern men had never heard a woman  speak in public, and felt great curiosity to hear her, they adjourned  the Convention, resolved themselves into a committee of the whole, and  invited her to address them.    An eye-witness[37] thus describes the scene: \"As the young maiden  stepped forward to deliver a speech as denunciatory as was ever  listened to against the action of the Border States, on her right sat  Brownlow, on her left John Minor Botts with his lips tightly  compressed, and his face telling plainly that he remained there from  courtesy, and would remain a patient listener to the end. She began;  and for the first time since it met, the Convention was so still that  the faintest whisper could be heard.\"    She had not spoken long before she declared that Maryland had no  business in the Convention, but should have been with delegates that  came to welcome. There was vehement applause from the Border States.  \"This is a direct insult,\" shouted a delegate from Maryland. She went  on in spite of interruptions, reviewing the conduct of the Border  States with scorn, and an eloquence never equalled in any of her  previous efforts, in favor of an open, manly declaration of the real  opinion of the Convention for justice to the colored Loyalist, not in  the courts only, but at the ballot-box. The speech was in Miss  Dickinson's noblest style throughout--bold, but tender, and often so  pathetic that she brought tears to every eye. Every word came from her  heart, and it went right to the hearts of all. Kentucky and Maryland  now listened as eagerly as Georgia and Alabama; Brownlow's iron  features and Botts' rigid face soon relaxed, and tears stood in the  old Virginian's eyes; while the noble Tennesseean moved his place, and  gazed at the inspired girl with an interest and wonderment which no  other orator had moved before. She had the audience in hand, as easily  as a mother holds her child, and like the child, this audience heard  her heart beat. It was a marvelous speech. Its greatness lay in its  manner and effect, as well as its argument. When she finished, one  after another of the Southern delegates came forward and pinned on her  dress the badges of their States until she wore the gifts of Alabama,  Missouri, Tennessee, Texas, Florida, Louisiana, and Maryland.    And thus it was from time to time that this remarkable girl uttered  the highest thought in American politics in that crisis of our  nation's history. While in camp and hospital she spoke words of  tenderness and love to the sick and dying, she did not hesitate to  rebuke the incapacity and iniquity of those in high places. She was  among the first to distrust McClellan and Lincoln, and in a lecture,  entitled \"My Policy,\" to unveil his successor, Andrew Johnson, to the  people. She saw the scepter of power grasped by the party of freedom,  and the first gun fired at Sumter in defence of slavery. She saw our  armies go forth to battle, the youth, the promise, the hope of the  nation--two millions strong--and saw them return with their ranks  thinned and broken, their flags tattered and stained, the maimed, the  halt and the blind, the weary and worn; and this, she said, is the  price of liberty. She saw the dawn of the glorious day of emancipation  when four million African slaves were set free, and that night of  gloom when the darkest page in American history was written in the  blood of its chief. Through the nation's agony was this young girl  born into a knowledge of her power; and she drew her inspiration from  the great events of her day.      THE WOMAN'S NATIONAL LOYAL LEAGUE.    MAMMOTH PETITION.    Those who had been specially engaged in the Woman Suffrage movement,  suspended their Conventions during the war and gave their time and  thought wholly to the vital issues of the hour. Seeing the political  significance of the war, they urged the emancipation of the slaves as  the sure, quick way of cutting the gordion knot of the rebellion. To  this end they organized a National League, and rolled up a mammoth  petition, urging Congress to so amend the Constitution as to prohibit  the existence of slavery in the United States.    From their headquarters in Cooper Institute, New York, they sent out  their appeals to the President, Congress, and the people at large;  tracts and forms of petition, franked by members of Congress, were  scattered like snowflakes from Maine to Texas. Meetings were held  every week, in which the policy of the Government was freely  discussed, approved or condemned. Robert Dale Owen, chairman of the  Freedman's Commission, then residing in New York, aided and encouraged  this movement from the beginning, frequently speaking in the public  meetings.    That this League did a timely educational work, is manifested by the  letters received from generals, statesmen, editors, and from women in  most of the Northern States, fully endorsing its action and  principles.[38] The clearness of thinking women on the cause of the  war; the true policy in waging it; their steadfastness in maintaining  the principles of freedom, are worthy of consideration. With this  League, Abolitionists and Republicans heartily co-operated. In a  course of lectures secured for its benefit in Cooper Institute, we  find the names of Horace Greeley, George William Curtis, William D.  Kelly, Wendell Phillips, E. P. Whipple, Frederick Douglass, Theodore  D. Weld, Rev. Dr. Tyng, Dr. Bellows, and Mrs. Frances D. Gage. Many  letters are on its files from Charles Sumner, approving its measures,  and expressing great satisfaction at the large number of emancipation  petitions being rolled into Congress. The Republican press, too, was  highly complimentary. The _New York Tribune_ said: \"The women of the  Loyal League have shown great practical wisdom in restricting their  efforts to one object, the most important which any society can aim  at, in this hour, and great courage in undertaking to do what never  has been done in the world before, to obtain one million of names to a  petition.\"    The leading journals vied with each other in praising the patience and  prudence, the executive ability, the loyalty, the patriotism of the  women of the League, and yet these were the same women, who when  demanding civil and political rights, privileges, and immunities for  themselves, had been uniformly denounced as \"unwise,\" \"imprudent,\"  \"fanatical,\" \"impracticable.\" During the six years they held their own  claims in abeyance to the slaves of the South, and labored to inspire  the people with enthusiasm for the great measures of the Republican  party, they were highly honored as \"wise, loyal, and clear-sighted.\"  But again when the slaves were emancipated and they asked that women  should be recognized in the reconstruction as citizens of the  Republic, equal before the law, all these transcendent virtues  vanished like dew before the morning sun. And thus it ever is so long  as woman labors to second man's endeavors and exalt _his sex_ above  her own, her virtues pass unquestioned; but when she dares to demand  rights and privileges for herself, her motives, manners, dress,  personal appearance, character, are subjects for ridicule and  detraction.    In March, 1863, an appeal[39] to the women of the Republic, was  published in the _New York Tribune_, and in tract form extensively  circulated with \"a call\"[40] for a National Convention in New York,  which assembled in Dr. Cheever's church May 14th. An immense audience,  mostly women, representing a large number of the States, crowded the  house at an early hour. Miss Susan B. Anthony called the Convention to  order and nominated Lucy Stone for President; the other officers[41]  of the Convention being chosen, Mrs. Stanton made the opening address,  and stated the objects of the meeting.    Miss Anthony having received large numbers of letters[42] which it  was impossible to read, said that the one word which had come up from  all quarters showed an earnestness of purpose on the part of women to  do everything in their power to aid the Government in the prosecution  of this war to the glorious end of freedom. The President in  introducing Angelina Grimke Weld, said:         This lady, once a South Carolina slaveholder, not only gave       freedom to all her slaves twenty years ago, but has spent the       strength of her younger years in going up and down among the       people, urging the Northern States to make their soil sacred to       freedom, to so amend their laws and constitutions that slavery       can find no protection within their borders.         MRS. WELD said: I came here with no desire and no intention to       speak; but my heart is full, my country is bleeding, my people       are perishing around me. But I feel as a South Carolinian, I am       bound to tell the North, go on! go on! Never falter, never       abandon the principles which you have adopted. I could not say       this if we were now where we stood two years ago. I could not say       thus when it was proclaimed in the Northern States that the Union       was all that we sought. No, my friends, such a Union as we had       then, God be praised that it has perished. Oh, never for one       moment consent that such a Union should be re-established in our       land. There was a time when I looked upon the Fathers of the       Revolution with the deepest sorrow and the keenest reproach. I       said to their shadows in another world, \"Why did you leave this       accursed system of slavery for us to suffer and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28056"],[0,"Music and Some Highly Musical People (#14)"],[1,"raised       than her musical powers. Well, she has visited our place,       and given our citizens an opportunity of judging for       themselves. We are ignorant of music, and unqualified to       criticise. But a large audience was in attendance at       Ringueberg Hall last evening: among those present were our       musical amateurs; and we heard but one expression in regard       to the new vocalist, and that was wonder and astonishment at       the extraordinary power and compass of her voice; and the       ease with which she passed from the highest to the lowest       notes seemed without an effort. Her first notes of 'Where       are now the hopes?' startled the whole audience; and the       interchange of glances, succeeded by thunders of applause at       the end of the first verse, showed that her success was       complete. She was loudly encored, and in response sang the       baritone, 'When stars are in the quiet sky,' which took down       the whole house.         \"We have neither time nor space to follow her through her       different pieces. Suffice it to say, that there never was a       concert given in this town which appeared to give more       general satisfaction; and every person we met on leaving       the hall expressed their entire approbation of her       performance. No higher compliment could be paid to the       'Swan' than the enthusiastic applause which successfully       greeted her appearance, and the encore which followed her       several pieces.         \"There was a very general expression among the audience that       the sable vocalist should give another concert; and, at the       earnest solicitation of several of our citizens, Col. Wood,       her gentlemanly manager, has consented to give another       entertainment to-morrow evening, when the 'Black Swan' will       give a new programme, consisting of some of Jenny Lind's       most popular songs.         \"The concert on Thursday evening was what in other cases       would have been called a triumph. The house was full, the       audience a fashionable one, the applause decided, and the       impression made by the singer highly favorable.         \"We can safely say that Miss Greenfield possesses a voice of       remarkable qualities; singular for its power, softness, and       depth. She has applied herself with praiseworthy       perseverance and assiduity to the cultivation of her       extraordinary powers, and has attained great proficiency in       the art which is evidently the bent of her genius. By her       own energy, and unassisted, she has made herself mistress of       the harp, guitar, and piano. We are informed that the       proceeds of the entertainment this evening are to be wholly       appropriated to the completion of her musical education in       Paris under the world-famed Garcia. We predict for Miss       Greenfield a successful and brilliant future.\"    \"The Rochester American\" says,--         \"Corinthian Hall contained a large and fashionable audience       on the occasion of the concert by this new candidate for       popular favor on Thursday evening. We have never seen an       audience more curiously expectant than this was for the       _debut_ of this new vocalist. Hardly had her first note       fallen upon their ears, however, before their wonder and       astonishment were manifest in an interchange of glances and       words of approval; and the hearty applause that responded to       the first verse she sang was good evidence of the       satisfaction she afforded. The aria, 'O native scenes!' was       loudly encored; and in response she gave the pretty ballad,       'When stars are in the quiet sky.'\"    The Buffalo \"Commercial Advertiser\" says,--         \"Miss Greenfield is about twenty-five years of age, and has       received what musical education she has in the city of       Philadelphia: she is, however, eminently self-taught,       possessing fine taste and a nice appreciation, with a voice       of wonderful compass, clearness, and flexibility. She       renders the compositions of some of the best masters in a       style which would be perfectly satisfactory to the authors       themselves. Her low, or properly _bass_ notes, are       wonderful, especially for a female voice; and in these she       far excels any singing we have ever heard.         \"We learn that this singer (soon to become celebrated, we       opine) will give a concert in this city on Thursday next.       There is no doubt that the novelty of hearing a colored       woman perform the most difficult music with extraordinary       ability will give _eclat_ to the concert. All       representations unite in ascribing to Miss Greenfield the       most extraordinary talents, and a power and sweetness of       vocalization that are really unsurpassed.\"    \"The Daily State Register,\" Albany, Jan. 19, 1852, said,--         \"THE 'BLACK SWAN'S' CONCERT.--Miss Greenfield made her       _debut_ in this city on Saturday evening, before a large and       brilliant audience, in the lecture-room of the Young Men's       Association. The concert was a complete triumph for her;       won, too, from a discriminating auditory not likely to be       caught with chaff, and none too willing to suffer admiration       to get the better of prejudice. Her singing more than met       the expectations of her hearers, and elicited the heartiest       applause and frequent encores. She possesses a truly       wonderful voice; and, considering the poverty of her       advantages, she uses it with surprising taste and effect. In       sweetness, power, compass, and flexibility, it nearly equals       any of the foreign vocalists who have visited our country;       and it needs only the training and education theirs have       received to outstrip them all.         \"The compass of her marvellous voice embraces twenty-seven       notes, reaching from the sonorous bass of a baritone to a       few notes above even Jenny Lind's highest. The defects which       the critic cannot fail to detect in her singing are not from       want of voice, or power of lung, but want of training       alone. If her present tour proves successful, as it now bids       fair to, she will put herself under the charge of the best       masters of singing in Europe; and with her enthusiasm and       perseverance, which belong to genius, she cannot fail to       ultimately triumph over all obstacles, and even conquer the       prejudice of color,--perhaps the most formidable one in her       path.         \"She plays with ability upon the piano, harp, and guitar. In       her deportment she bears herself well, and, we are told,       converses with much intelligence. We noticed among the       audience Gov. Hunt and his family, both Houses of the       Legislature, State officers, and a large number of our       leading citizens. All came away astonished and delighted.\"    A New-York paper says,--         \"MISS GREENFIELD'S SINGING.--We yesterday had the pleasure       of hearing the singer who is advertised in our columns as       the 'Black Swan.' She is a person of ladylike manners,       elegant form, and not unpleasing, though decidedly African       features. Of her marvellous powers, she owes none to any       tincture of European blood. Her voice is truly wonderful,       both in its compass and truth. A more correct intonation, so       far as our ear can decide, there could not be. She strikes       every note on the exact centre, with unhesitating       decision.... She is a nondescript, an original. We cannot       think any common destiny awaits her.\"    \"The Evening Transcript,\" Boston, Feb. 4, 1852, said,--         \"Miss Greenfield, the 'Black Swan,' made her _debut_ before       a Boston audience last evening at the Melodeon. In       consequence of the price of the tickets being put at a       dollar, the house was not over two-thirds full. She was well       received, and most vociferously applauded and encored in       every piece. She sings with great ease, and apparently       without any effort. Her pronunciation is very correct, and       her intonation excellent. Her voice has a wonderful compass,       and in many notes is remarkably sweet in tone.\"    From \"The Daily Capital City Fact,\" Columbus, O., March 3, 1852:--         \"Last evening proved that the 'Black Swan' was all that the       journals say of her; and Miss Greenfield stands confessedly       before the Columbus world a swan of excellence. She is       indeed a remarkable swan. Although colored as dark as       Ethiopia, she utters notes as pure as if uttered in the       words of the Adriatic.\"    From \"The Milwaukee Sentinel,\" April, 1852:--         \"What shall we say? That we were delighted and surprised?       All who were present know that, from their own feelings. We       can only say, that we have never heard a voice like       hers,--one that with such ease, and with such absence of all       effort, could range from the highest to the lowest notes.\"    Said a Rochester (N.Y.) paper of May 6, 1852,--         ... \"The magnificent quality of her voice, its great power,       flexibility, and compass, her self-taught genius, energy,       and perseverance, combine to render Miss Greenfield an       object of uncommon interest to musicians.         \"We have been spell-bound by the ravishing tones of Patti,       Sontag, Malibran, and Grisi; we have heard the wondrous       warblings of '_the Nightingale_;' and we have listened with       delight to the sweet melodies of the fair daughter of Erin:       but we hesitate not to assert, that, with one year's tuition       from the world-famed Emanuel Garcia, Miss Greenfield would       not only compare favorably with any of the distinguished       artists above named, but incomparably excel them all.\"    \"The Globe,\" Toronto, May 12-15, 1852, said,--         \"Any one who went to the concert of Miss Greenfield"]]]
