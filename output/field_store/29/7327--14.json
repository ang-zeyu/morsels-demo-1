Interview With:     Fannie Moore, Ex-slave,                      151 Valley Street,                      Asheville, N.C.      \"Nowadays when I heah folks a'growlin an' a'grumblin bout not habbin  this an' that I jes think what would they done effen they be brought up  on de Moore plantation. De Moore plantation b'long to Marse Jim Moore,  in Moore, South Carolina. De Moores had own de same plantation and de  same niggers and dey children for yeahs back. When Marse Jim's pappy  die he leave de whole thing to Marse Jim, effen he take care of his  mammy. She shore was a rip-jack. She say niggers didn't need nothin' to  eat. Dey jes like animals, not like other folks. She whip me, many time  wif a cow hide, til I was black and blue.    \"Marse Jim's wife war Mary Anderson. She war the sweetest woman I ebber  saw. She was allus good to evah nigger on de plantation. Her mother was  Harriet Anderson and she visit de Missus for long time on de farm. All  de little niggers like to work fo' her. She nebber talk mean. Jes smile  dat sweet smile and talk in de soffes' tone. An when she laugh, she  soun' jes like de little stream back ob de spring house gurglin' past  de rocks. An' her hair all white and curly, I can 'member her always.    \"Marse Jim own de bigges' plantation in de whole country. Jes thousands  acres ob lan'. An de ole Tiger Ribber a runnin' right through de middle  ob de plantation. On one side ob de ribber stood de big house, whar de  white folks lib and on the other side stood de quarters. De big house  was a purty thing all painted white, a standin' in a patch o' oak  trees. I can't remember how many rooms in dat house but powerful many.  O'corse it was built when de Moores had sech large families. Marse Jim  he only hab five children, not twelve like his mammy had. Dey was  Andrew and Tom, den Harriet, Nan, and Nettie Sue. Harriett was jes like  her granny Anderson. She was good to ebberbody. She git de little  niggers down an' teach em dey Sunday School lesson. Effen ole Marse  Jim's mammy ketch her she sho' raise torment. She make life jes as hard  for de niggers as she can.    \"De quarters jes long row o' cabins daubed wif dirt. Ever one in de  family lib in one big room. In one end was a big fireplace. Dis had to  heat de cabin and do de cookin too. We cooked in a big pot hung on a  rod over de fire and bake de co'n pone in de ashes or else put it in de  skillet and cover de lid wif coals. We allus hab plenty wood to keep us  warm. Dat is ef we hab time to get it outen de woods.    \"My granny she cook for us chillens while our mammy away in de fiel.  Dey wasn't much cookin to do. Jes make co'n pone and bring in de milk.  She hab big wooden bowl wif enough wooden spoons to go 'roun'. She put  de milk in de bowl and break it up. Den she put de bowl in de middle of  de flo' an' all de chillun grab a spoon.    \"My mammy she work in de fiel' all day and piece and quilt all night.  Den she hab to spin enough thread to make four cuts for de white fo'ks  ebber night. Why sometime I nebber go to bed. Hab to hold de light for  her to see by. She hab to piece quilts for de white folks too. Why dey  is a scar on my arm yet where my brother let de pine drip on me. Rich  pine war all de light we ebber hab. My brother was a holdin' de pine  so's I can help mammy tack de quilt and he go to sleep and let it  drop.    \"I never see how my mammy stan' sech ha'd work. She stan' up fo' her  chillun tho'. De ol' overseeah he hate my mammy, case she fight him for  beatin' her chillun. Why she git more whuppins for dat den anythin'  else. She hab twelve chillun. I member I see de three oldes' stan' in  de snow up to dey knees to split rails, while de overseeah stan off an'  grin.    \"My mammy she trouble in her heart bout de way they treated. Ever night  she pray for de Lawd to git her an' her chillun out ob de place. One  day she plowin' in de cotton fiel. All sudden like she let out big  yell. Den she sta't singin' an' a shoutin', an' a whoopin' an' a  hollowin'. Den it seem she plow all de harder. When she come home,  Marse Jim's mammy say: 'What all dat goin' on in de fiel? Yo' think we  sen' you out there jes to whoop and yell? No siree, we put you out  there to work and you sho' bettah work, else we git de overseeah to  cowhide you ole black back.' My mammy jes grin all over her black  wrinkled face and say: 'I's saved. De Lawd done tell me I's saved. Now  I know de Lawd will show me de way, I ain't gwine a grieve no more. No  matter how much yo' all done beat me an' my chillun de Lawd will show  me de way. An' some day we nevah be slaves.' Ole granny Moore grab de  cowhide and slash mammy cross de back but mammy nebber yell. She jes go  back to de fiel a singin'.    \"My mammy grieve lots over brothah George, who die wif de fever. Granny  she doctah him as bes' she could, evah time she git way from de white  folks kitchen. My mammy nevah git chance to see him, 'cept when she git  home in de evenin'. George he jes lie. One day I look at him an' he had  sech a peaceful look on his face, I think he sleep and jes let him  lone. Long in de evenin I think I try to wake him. I touch him on de  face, but he was dead. Mammy nebber know til she come at night. Pore  mammy she kneel by de bed an' cry her heart out. Ol' uncle Allen, he  make pine box for him an' carry him to de graveyard over on de hill. My  mammy jes plow and cry as she watch em' put George in de groun'.    \"My pappy he was a blacksmith. He shoe all de horses on de plantation.  He wo'k so hard he hab no time to go to de fiel'. His name war Stephen  Moore. Mars Jim call him Stephen Andrew. He was sold to de Moores, and  his mammy too. She war brought over from Africa. She never could speak  plain. All her life she been a slave. White folks never recognize 'em  any more than effen dey was a dog.    \"It was a tubble sight to see de speculators come to de plantation. Dey  would go through de fields and buy de slaves dey wanted. Marse Jim  nebber sell pappy or mammy or any ob dey chillun. He allus like pappy.  When de speculator come all de slaves start a shakin'. No one know who  is a goin'. Den sometime dey take 'em an' sell 'em on de block. De  'breed woman' always bring mo' money den de res', ebben de men. When  dey put her on de block dey put all her chillun aroun her to show folks  how fas she can hab chillun. When she sold her family nebber see her  agin. She nebber know [HW: how] many chillun she hab. Some time she hab  colored children an' sometime white. Taint no use to say anything case  effen she do she jes git whipped. Why on de Moore plantation Aunt  Cheney, everbody call her Aunt Cheney, have two chillun by de  overseeah. De overseeah name war Hill. He war as mean as de devil. When  Aunt Cheney not do what he ask he tell granny Moore. Ole Granny call  Aunt Cheney to de kitchen and make her take her clothes off den she  beat her til she jest black an' blue. Many boys and girls marry dey own  brothers and sisters an' nebber know de difference lest they get to  talkin' bout dey parents and where dey uster lib.    \"De niggers allus hab to get pass to go anywhere offen de plantation.  Dey git de pass from de massa or de missus. Den when de paddyrollers  come dey had to show de pass to dem, if you had no pass dey strip you  an' beat you.    \"I remember one time dey was a dance at one ob de houses in de  quarters. All de niggers was a laughin an' a pattin' dey feet an' a  singin', but dey was a few dat didn't. De paddyrollers shove de do'  open and sta't grabbin' us. Uncle Joe's son he decide dey was one time  to die and he sta't to fight. He say he tired standin' so many  beatin's, he jes can't stan' no mo. De paddyrollers start beatin' him  an' he sta't fightin'. Oh, Lawdy it war tubble. Dey whip him wif a  cowhide for a long time den one of dem take a stick an' hit him over de  head, an' jes bus his head wide open. De pore boy fell on de flo' jes a  moanin' an' a groanin. De paddyrollers jes whip bout half dozen other  niggers an' sen' em home and leve us wif de dead boy.    \"None o' the niggers have any learnin', warn't never 'lowed to as much  as pick up a piece o' paper. My daddy slip an' get a Webster book and  den he take it outen de fiel and he larn to read. De white folks 'fraid  to let de children learn anythin'. They fraid dey get too sma't and be  harder to manage. Dey nebber let em know anything about anythin'. Never  have any church. Effen you go you set in de back of de white folks  chu'ch. But de niggers slip off an' pray an' hold prayer-meetin' in de  woods den dey tu'n down a big wash pot and prop it up wif a stick to  drown out de soun' ob de singin'. I 'member some of de songs we uster  sing. One of dem went somethin' like dis:        \"'Hark from de tomb a doleful soun'      My ears hear a tender cry.      A livin' man come through the groun'      Whar we may shortly lie.      Heah in dis clay may be you bed      In spite ob all you toil      Let all de wise bow revrant head      Mus' lie as low as ours.'    \"Then dey sing one I can hardly remember but dis is some of de words:        \"'Jesus can make you die in bed      He sof' as downs in pillow there      On my bres' I'll lean my head      Grieve my life sweetly there.      In dis life of heaby load      Let us share de weary traveler      Along de heabenly road.'    \"Back in dose time dey wasn't no way to put away fruit and things fo'  winter like dey is today. In de fall of de yeah it certainly was a busy  time. We peel bushels of apples and peaches to dry. Dey put up lots o'  brandied peaches too. De way dey done"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31234"],[0,"A History of the English Church in New Zealand (#14)"],[1,"thus describes the meeting: \"River covered by a thick fog,  everything dripping wet. After rowing a few miles in the early morning  we came to a small sandy landing place. Here, under some canvas thrown  over the shrubs, we found Mr. Morgan and three missionaries'  wives--Mesdames Brown, Chapman, and Morgan--and with them two or three  native girls (bearers of their luggage from Matamata). These poor ladies  had all the appearance of fugitives, and such they really were. They had  slept in their clothes on the wet ground, and their chief comfort was a  little fire struggling for existence with wet green wood. On hearing the  noise of our boat landing, I saw from under the canvas a weary pale  face, nearly on a level with the wet earth, looking to see what it was.  How glad they were to see us! What a change in their countenances from  sorrow to gladness! Now--for a time at least--their troubles were over.  In a few minutes we had them packed and arranged in our little boat, and  sent them down the Waihou on their way to the Puriri.\"    Though the ladies had escaped unharmed, their belongings had not. The  Matamata station was no safe place for anything, on account of the  marauding bands who infested the country. As soon as possible therefore  the most valuable articles were packed and sent off towards the river.  News soon arrived that the convoy had been plundered. Morgan and Knight  set out in pursuit and encountered a band of armed men, whose grotesque  appearance brought a laugh to the missionaries' faces in spite of the  danger of the situation. Most of the party were dressed in white shirts,  and \"one man was marching before the rest, with the utmost consequence,  his head and olive-coloured face being enveloped in a black silk bonnet  belonging to Mrs. Chapman, while a strip of cotton print, tied round his  neck, formed the remainder of his apparel--he having left his own  clothes at home, in order to his being lighter for fighting or anything  else he might have to do.\"    The humour of the moment was not lessened when it was found that the  strangely clad procession consisted not of the actual robbers, but of a  friendly party who had robbed them in turn. The hero of the bonnet  episode was, in fact, a son of Waharoa, who shortly afterwards embraced  Christianity, and under the new name of Wiremu Tamihana (William  Thomson) witnessed a good confession in the midst of his savage  compatriots, and actually built a new _pa_, in which he allowed no one  to live who did not join with him and his followers in worshipping God  and in keeping the elementary rules of morality.    Troubles continued to thicken, but the missionaries clung to their posts  as long as they could. Wilson went to the help of Chapman at Rotorua,  and together they retired across the lake to the island which has become  famous through the legend of Hinemoa. The beauty of its traditions could  hardly be appreciated by the fugitive missionaries: \"The hut in which we  live,\" they wrote, \"is small and damp, has neither chimney nor window,  and on rainy days, which confine us inside, we construct a lamp with  lard and cotton to read by, as best we can.\" But Chapman, like his wife,  never complained. Without a word of reproach or repining, he took his  friend over the ruins of the old station, which he had made the most  beautiful of all the mission properties. His one desire was to make  peace among his people, and for this purpose he sent once and again to  Henry Williams for his help. But even Wiremu, with all his efforts,  could not soften the heart of Waharoa nor of the Rotorua leaders. The  war accordingly went on, though now in desultory fashion. The Matamata  station was finally stripped, and its occupants driven to the north. The  Committee now withdrew Chapman to Tauranga, and finally with Wilson to  the Bay of Islands. They arrived there at about the same time as did the  refugees from the Thames.    The forward movement appeared thus to issue in failure. But the  abandonment was not for long, nor had the work already done been in  vain. Waharoa died a heathen, but he complained before his death that  his sons, under mission influence, were becoming too mild and forgiving.  The case of one of these--Tamihana--has already been noticed. Still more  remarkable is that of his warlike nephew, Ngakuku, whose name brings us  to one of the most touching incidents in the history of Maori  Christianity.    Ngakuku was not an avowed Christian, but he had sent his little  daughter, Tarore, to live with Mrs. Brown--one of the ladies whom we  found sheltering by the river bank in their flight from Matamata. In the  mission house the child Tarore had learned to read, and had been given a  copy of the Gospel of St. Luke. In the middle of October her father took  her and a younger brother on a journey to Tauranga. The party consisted  of several Maoris, and an Englishman who was connected with the mission.  At night they encamped at the foot of Wairere, where a magnificent  cascade falls from the high forest land above. After their meal, Ngakuku  offered prayers to the God whom he was just beginning to know, and when  they laid down to rest, Tarore pillowed her head upon her precious  Gospel. But their fire had been noticed by a party of Rotoruas far up  the valley. These crept down during the night, and just before daylight  made a sudden attack upon the camp. The Englishman's tent was the first  to be entered, and while it was being stripped, Ngakuku had time to  seize his little son and to escape into the bush. He tried to arouse  Tarore also, but the child was heavy with sleep and had to be abandoned.  When the enemy departed, the agonised father came down from his retreat  and found lying in the hut the mangled corpse of his little girl. He  carried it to Mr. Brown at Matamata, with the words, \"My heart is sad,  for I do not know whether my child has gone to heaven or to the Reinga.\"  After evening prayers in the chapel, he rose and spoke to those present  from the words so new to him, \"In my Father's house are many mansions.\"  Next day Tarore was buried amidst a scene of the deepest solemnity. The  father spoke at the close with strong feeling: \"There lies my child; she  has been murdered as a payment for your bad conduct. But do not you  rise up to obtain satisfaction for her. God will do that. Let this be  the conclusion of the war with Rotorua. Let peace be now made. My heart  is not sad for Tarore, but for you. You wished teachers to come to you:  they came, but now you are driving them away.\"    \"God will obtain satisfaction,\" said Ngakuku. Bishop Williams remarks on  the notable circumstance that, in an attack made upon Matamata some  weeks afterwards, out of five Rotorua natives who were killed, four were  concerned in this tragedy. Higher satisfaction still was made some years  afterwards when Uita, the man who led the attack, having a desire to  embrace Christianity, first sought reconciliation with Ngakuku. Nor did  the effects of the little maiden's death stop even here. What had become  of her Gospel? Who could tell?           *       *       *       *       *    The moment when the refugees arrived in the Bay of Islands was a  particularly interesting one. Samuel Marsden was making his last visit  to New Zealand. He had come, as he came ten years before, to bring cheer  to his missionaries in a time of war and confusion. But the conditions  in 1837 were very different from those of 1827. _Then_, there was  darkness everywhere; _now_, in spite of the troubles in the south, there  was gladness and a feeling of success. The older stations had indeed  joyful tales to tell concerning the work of the last five years.  Whatever might have been the fate of the forward movement, it had  certainly coincided with a real religious awakening at the base in the  north. At Waimate this was especially evident. Richard Davis could tell  of days when he had over a hundred people coming to him with anxious  enquiries about their souls. Numbers of converts had been admitted,  after most stringent tests, not only to Baptism but to the Holy  Communion. At Paihia the schools had undoubtedly suffered through the  withdrawal of the teachers for the southern stations, but their work  had been done. Large numbers of the people could now read, and those who  had learned at the mission schools were teaching others in the villages  far and wide. And, above all, a printing press had been received at  Paihia in 1835. This event aroused extraordinary interest. The Maoris  danced before the ponderous case as it was drawn up the beach, and  acclaimed Colenso, the printer, as if he had been a victorious general.  Distant chiefs came bringing bags of potatoes for the precious books.  Two thousand copies of the Epistles to the Ephesians and the Philippians  were the first books to be published in this country; then came the  Gospel of St. Luke. This booklet was so eagerly sought for that the  printers could not bind the copies fast enough. Into regions previously  inaccessible the gracious words of divine wisdom penetrated. Tarore's  copy was not the only one that found its way into the wild southern  lands.    Hence it was that Marsden's last visit bore the aspect of a triumphal  progress. Landing at the Wesleyan station on the Hokianga River at the  end of February, he was received with the utmost joy by the  missionaries, who remembered his constant kindness to them, especially  at the time of their flight from Whangaroa. From Hokianga he was carried  on a litter by a procession of 70 men for 20 miles to Waimate, where he  was met by Messrs. W. Williams, Davis, and Clarke. With pride they  showed him the products of native workmanship in various  departments--the church, the mill, the flourishing farm, the road to  Kerikeri with its solid bridges. Marsden had always believed in the  capacity of the Maori for industrial pursuits: now the evidences of this  "]]]
