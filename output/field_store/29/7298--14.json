The stem is about two inches long, hollow, solid at the base, smooth,  cartilaginous, tough, rooting. The spores are 9-10x7-8u.    It differs from T. album in having the odor of new meal strongly marked.  It is found in open woods during September and October.      _Tricholoma fumescens. Pk._    SMOKY TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 54.--Tricholoma fumescens.]    Fumescens means growing smoky.    Pileus convex or expanded, dry, clothed with a very minute appressed  tomentum, whitish.    The gills are narrow, crowded, rounded behind, whitish or pale cream  color, changing to smoky blue or blackish where bruised.    The stem is short, cylindrical, whitish. Spores are oblong-elliptical,  5-6x5u. Pileus is one inch broad. Stem one to one and a half inches  high. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.    The caps are quite a bit larger in the specimens found in Ohio than  those described by Dr. Peck. So much so that I was in doubt as to the  correct identification. I sent some specimens to Dr. Peck for his  determination. The species will be readily identified by the fine  crowded gills and the smoky blue or blackish hue they assume when  bruised. The caps are frequently wavy, as will be seen in Figure 54.    I found the plants in Poke Hollow near Chillicothe, September to  November.      _Tricholoma terreum. Schaeff._    THE GRAY TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 55.--Tricholoma terreum. Cap grayish-brown or  mouse color.]    Terreum is from _terra_, the earth; so called from the color. This is  quite a variable species in color and size, as well as manner of growth.    The pileus is one to three inches broad, dry, fleshy, thin, convex,  expanded, nearly plane, often having a central umbo; floccose-scaly,  ashy-brown, grayish-brown or mouse-color.    The gills are adnexed, subdistant, white, becoming grayish, edges more  or less eroded. Spores, 5-6u.    The stem is whitish, fibrillose, equal, paler than the cap, varying from  solid to stuffed or hollow, one to three inches high.    I find this plant on north hillsides, in beech woods. It is not  plentiful. There are several varieties:    Var. orirubens. Q. Edge of gills reddish.    Var. atrosquamosum. Chev. Pileus gray with small black scales; g.  whitish.    Var. argyraceum. Bull. Entirely pure white, or pileus grayish.    Var. chrysites. Jungh. Pileus tinged yellowish or greenish.    The plants in Figure 55 were found in Poke Hollow near Chillicothe.  Their time is September to November.      _Tricholoma saponaceum. Fr._    [Illustration: Figure 56.--Tricholoma saponaceum.]    Saponaceum is from _sapo_, soap, so called from its peculiar odor.    The pileus is two to three inches broad, convex, then plane, involute at  first as will be seen in Figure 56, smooth, moist in wet weather but not  viscid, often cracked into scales or punctate, grayish or livid-brown,  often with a tinge of olive, flesh firm, becoming more or less red when  cut or wounded.    The gills are uncinately emarginate, thin, quite entire, not crowded,  white, sometimes tinged with green. Spores subglobose, 5x4u.    The stem is solid, unequal, rooting, smooth, sometimes reticulated with  black fibrils or scaly.    This species is found quite frequently about Chillicothe. It is quite  variable in size and color, but can be readily recognized from its  peculiar odor and the flesh's becoming reddish when wounded. It is not  poisonous but its odor will prevent any one from eating it. Found in  mixed woods from August to November.      _Tricholoma cartilagineum. Bull._    THE CARTILAGINOUS TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 57.--Tricholoma cartilagineum. Two-thirds natural  size.]    Cartilagineum means gristly or cartilaginous.    The pileus is two to three inches broad, cartilaginous, elastic, fleshy,  convex, soon expanded, wavy, as seen in Figure 57, margin incurved,  smooth, inclined to be blackish at first, then broken up into small  black spots.    The gills are slightly notched, adnexed, somewhat crowded, grayish.    The stem is one to two inches long, rather firm, stuffed, equal, smooth,  white, often striate and mealy. Taste and odor pleasant.    A number of my friends ate it because of its inviting taste and odor. It  grew in quantities among the clover in our city park during the wet  weather of the last of May and the first of June.      _Tricholoma squarrulosum. Bres._    [Illustration: Figure 58.--Tricholoma squarrulosum. Caps showing black  squamules.]    Squarrulosum means full of scales.    The pileus is two to three inches broad, convex, then expanded,  umbonate, dry; fuscous then lurid tan, center black, with black  squamules; edge fibrillose, exceeding gills.    The gills are broad, crowded, whitish-gray, reddish when bruised.    The stem is of the same color as the pileus, punctato-squamulose. The  spores are elliptical, 7-9x4-5u.    This is a beautiful plant, growing in mixed woods among the leaves. The  stem is short and apparently the same color as the pileus. The latter is  covered with black squamules which give rise to the name of the species.  I have succeeded in finding the plants only in October. The specimens in  Figure 58 were found in Poke Hollow, near Chillicothe.      _Tricholoma maculatescens. Pk._    SPOTTED TRICHOLOMA.    [Illustration: Figure 59.--Tricholoma maculatescens. One-third natural  size.]    Maculatescens means growing spotted; so called because when the specimen  is dried the cap becomes more or less spotted.    The pileus is one and a half to three inches broad, compact, spongy,  reddish-brown, convex, then expanded, obtuse, even, slightly viscid when  wet, becoming rivulose and brown spotted in drying, flesh whitish,  margin inflexed, exceeding the gills.    The gills are slightly emarginate, rather narrow, cinereous.    The stem is spongy-fleshy, equal, sometimes abruptly narrowed at the  base, solid, stout, fibrillose, pallid or whitish. The spores are oblong  or subfusiform, pointed at the ends, uninucleate, .0003 inch long,  .00016 broad. _Peck._    I found the plant on several occasions in the month of November, but was  unable to fix it satisfactorily until Prof. Morgan helped me out. The  specimens in Figure 59 were found on Thanksgiving day in the Morton  woods, in Gallia County, Ohio. I had found several specimens about  Chillicothe, previous to this.    This species seems to be very near T. flavobrunneum, T. graveolens, and  T. Schumacheri, but may be distinguished from them by the spotting of  the pileus when drying and the peculiar shape of the spores.    It is found among the leaves in mixed woods even during freezing  weather. It is no doubt edible, but I should try it cautiously for the  first time.      _Tricholoma flavobrunneum. Fr._    THE YELLOW-BROWN TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    Flavobrunneum is from flavus, yellow; brunneus, brown; so called from  the brown caps and yellow flesh.    The pileus is three to four or more inches broad, fleshy, conical, then  convex, expanded, subumbonate, viscid, brownish-bay, scaly-streaked,  flesh yellow, then tinged with red.    The gills are pale yellow, emarginate, slightly decurrent, somewhat  crowded, and often tinged with red.    The stem is three to four inches long, hollow, slightly ventricose,  brownish, flesh yellow, at first viscid, sometimes reddish-brown. The  spores are 6-7x4-5. Found in mixed woods among leaves.      _Tricholoma Schumacheri. Fr._    Schumacheri in honor of C. F. Schumacher, author of \"Plantarum  Saellandiae.\" The pileus is from two to three inches broad, spongy,  convex, then plane, obtuse, even, livid gray, moist, edge beyond gills  incurved.    The gills are narrow, close, pure white, slightly emarginate.    The stem is three to four inches long, solid, fibrillosely-striate,  white and fleshy.    This seems to be a domestic plant, found in greenhouses.      _Tricholoma grande. Pk._    THE LARGE TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    Grande, large, showy. This was quite abundant in Haines' Hollow and on  Ralston's Run during the wet weather of the fall of 1905. It seems to be  very like T. columbetta and is found in the same localities.    The pileus is thick, firm, hemispherical, becoming convex, often  irregular, dry, scaly, somewhat silky-fibrillose toward the margin,  white, the margin at first involute. Flesh grayish-white, taste  farinaceous.    The gills are close, rounded behind, adnexed, white.    The stem is stout, solid, fibrillose, at first tapering upward, then  equal or but slightly thickened at the base, pure white. The spores are  elliptical, 9-11x6u.    The pileus is four to five inches broad, the stem two to four inches  long, and an inch to an inch and a half thick. _Peck_, 44th Rep.    This is a very large and showy plant, growing among leaves after heavy  rains. Both this and T. columbetta, as well as a white variety of T.  personatum, were very plentiful in the same woods. They grow in groups  so closely crowded that the caps are often quite irregular. The darker  and scaly disk and larger sized spore will help you to distinguish it  from T. columbetta. The very large specimens are too coarse to be good.  Found in damp woods, among leaves, from August to November.      _Tricholoma sejunctum. Sow._    THE SEPARATING TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 60.--Tricholoma sejunctum. One-half natural size.]    Sejunctum means having separated. It refers to the separation of the  gills from the stem. Pileus fleshy, convex, then expanded, umbonate,  slightly viscid, streaked with innate brown or blackish fibrils, whitish  or yellow, sometimes greenish-yellow, flesh white and fragile.    The gills are broad, subdistant, rounded behind or notched, white.    The stem is solid, stout, often irregular, white. The spores are  subglobose, .00025 inch broad. The pileus is one to three inches broad;  stem one to four inches long and from four to eight lines thick.  _Peck's_ Report.

Telephones - mobile cellular:  This entry gives the total number of  mobile cellular telephone subscribers.    Television broadcast stations:  This entry gives the total number of  separate broadcast stations plus any repeater stations.    Terminology:  Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook  database, some collective generic terms have to be used. For example,  the word Country in the Country name entry refers to a wide variety of  dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and  other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent  states. Military is also used as an umbrella term for various civil  defense, security, and defense activities in many entries. The  Independence entry includes the usual colonial independence dates and  former ruling states as well as other significant nationhood dates such  as the traditional founding date or the date of unification,  federation, confederation, establishment, or state succession that are  not strictly independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of  their dependency status noted in this same entry.    Terrain:  This entry contains a brief description of the topography.    Time difference:  This entry is expressed in The World Factbook in two  ways. First, it is stated as the difference in hours between the  capital of an entity and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) during  Standard Time. Additionally, the difference in time between the capital  of an entity and that observed in Washington, D.C. is also provided.  Note that the time difference assumes both locations are simultaneously  observing Standard Time or Daylight Saving Time.    Time zones:  Ten countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia,  Kazakhstan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, and the United States)  and the island of Greenland observe more than one official time  depending on the number of designated time zones within their  boundaries. An illustration of time zones throughout the world and  within countries can be seen in the Standard Time Zones of the World  map included in the Reference Maps section of The World Factbook.    Total fertility rate:  This entry gives a figure for the average number  of children that would be born per woman if all women lived to the end  of their childbearing years and bore children according to a given  fertility rate at each age. The total fertility rate (TFR) is a more  direct measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate,  since it refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential  for population change in the country. A rate of two children per woman  is considered the replacement rate for a population, resulting in  relative stability in terms of total numbers. Rates above two children  indicate populations growing in size and whose median age is declining.  Higher rates may also indicate difficulties for families, in some  situations, to feed and educate their children and for women to enter  the labor force. Rates below two children indicate populations  decreasing in size and growing older. Global fertility rates are in  general decline and this trend is most pronounced in industrialized  countries, especially Western Europe, where populations are projected  to decline dramatically over the next 50 years.    Total renewable water resources:  This entry provides the long-term  average water availability for a country in cubic kilometers of  precipitation, recharged ground water, and surface inflows from  surrounding countries. The values have been adjusted to account for  overlap resulting from surface flow recharge of groundwater sources.  Total renewable water resources provides the water total available to a  country but does not include water resource totals that have been  reserved for upstream or downstream countries through international  agreements. Note that these values are averages and do not accurately  reflect the total available in any given year. Annual available  resources can vary greatly due to short-term and long-term climatic and  weather variations.    Trafficking in persons:  Trafficking in persons is modern-day slavery,  involving victims who are forced, defrauded, or coerced into labor or  sexual exploitation. The International Labor Organization (ILO), the UN  agency charged with addressing labor standards, employment, and social  protection issues, estimates that 12.3 million people worldwide are  enslaved in forced labor, bonded labor, forced child labor, sexual  servitude, and involuntary servitude at any given time. Human  trafficking is a multi-dimensional threat, depriving people of their  human rights and freedoms, risking global health, promoting social  breakdown, inhibiting development by depriving countries of their human  capital, and helping fuel the growth of organized crime. In 2000, the  US Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA),  reauthorized in 2003 and 2005, which provides tools for the US to  combat trafficking in persons, both domestically and abroad. One of the  law's key components is the creation of the US Department of State's  annual Trafficking in Persons Report, which assesses the government  response (i.e., the current situation) in some 150 countries with a  significant number of victims trafficked across their borders who are  recruited, harbored, transported, provided, or obtained for forced  labor or sexual exploitation. Countries in the annual report are rated  in three tiers, based on government efforts to combat trafficking. The  countries identified in this entry are those listed in the 2007  Trafficking in Persons Report as Tier 2 Watch List or Tier 3 based on  the following tier rating definitions:    Tier 2 Watch List countries do not fully comply with the minimum  standards for the elimination of trafficking but are making significant  efforts to do so, and meet one of the following criteria:    1. they display high or significantly increasing number of victims,    2. they have failed to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat  trafficking in persons, or,    3. they have committed to take action over the next year.    Tier 3 countries neither satisfy the minimum standards for the  elimination of trafficking nor demonstrate a significant effort to do  so. Countries in this tier are subject to potential non-humanitarian  and non-trade sanctions.    Transnational issues:  This category includes four entries - Disputes -  international, Refugees and internally displaced persons, Trafficking  in persons, and Illicit drugs - that deal with current issues going  beyond national boundaries.    Transportation:  This category includes the entries dealing with the  means for movement of people and goods.    Transportation - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous  transportation information of significance not included elsewhere.    UTC (Coordinated Universal Time):  See entry for Coordinated Universal  Time.    Unemployment rate:  This entry contains the percent of the labor force  that is without jobs. Substantial underemployment might be noted.    Waterways:  This entry gives the total length of navigable rivers,  canals, and other inland bodies of water.    Weights and Measures:  This information is presented in Appendix G:  Weights and Measures and includes mathematical notations (mathematical  powers and names), metric interrelationships (prefix; symbol; length,  weight, or capacity; area; volume), and standard conversion factors.    Years:  All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless  indicated as fiscal year (FY). The calendar year is an accounting  period of 12 months from 1 January to 31 December. The fiscal year is  an accounting period of 12 months other than 1 January to 31 December.
