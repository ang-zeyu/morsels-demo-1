The day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.    Yes! the register of the wicked is in Sidjin.1    And who shall make thee understand what Sidjin is?    It is a book distinctly written.    Woe, on that day, to those who treated our signs as lies,    Who treated the day of judgment as a lie!    None treat it as a lie, save the transgressor, the criminal,    Who, when our signs are rehearsed to him, saith, \"Tales of the Ancients!\"    Yes; but their own works have got the mastery over their hearts.    Yes; they shall be shut out as by a veil from their Lord on that day;    Then shall they be burned in Hell-fire:    Then shall it be said to them, \"This is what ye deemed a lie.\"    Even so. But the register of the righteous is in Illiyoun.    And who shall make thee understand what Illiyoun is?    A book distinctly written;    The angels who draw nigh unto God attest it.    Surely, among delights shall the righteous dwell!    Seated on bridal couches they will gaze around;    Thou shalt mark in their faces the brightness of delight;    Choice sealed wine shall be given them to quaff,    The seal of musk. For this let those pant who pant for bliss    Mingled therewith shall be the waters of Tasnim2    Fount whereof they who draw nigh to God shall drink.    The sinners indeed laugh the faithful to scorn:    And when they pass by them they wink at one another,    And when they return to their own people, they return jesting,    And when they see them they say, \"These are the erring ones.\"    And yet they have no mission to be their guardians.    Therefore, on that day the faithful shall laugh the infidels to scorn,    As reclining on bridal couches they behold them.    Shall not the infidels be recompensed according to their works?      _______________________    1 Sidjin is a prison in Hell which gives its name to the register of actions  there kept, as Illiyoun, a name of the lofty apartments of Paradise, is  transferred to the register of the righteous.    2 Derived from the root sanima, to be high: this water being conveyed to the  highest apartments in the Pavilions of Paradise.

Themoud and Ad treated the day of Terrors1 as a lie.    So as to Themoud,2 they were destroyed by crashing thunder bolts;    And as to Ad, they were destroyed by a roaring and furious blast.    It did the bidding of God3 against them seven nights and eight days together,  during which thou mightest have seen the people laid low, as though they had  been the trunks of hollow palms;    And couldst thou have seen one of them surviving?    Pharaoh also, and those who flourished before him, and the overthrown cities,  committed sin,    And disobeyed the Sent one of their Lord; therefore did he chastise them with  an accumulated chastisement.    When the Flood rose high, we bare you in the Ark,    That we might make that event a warning to you, and that the retaining ear  might retain it.    But when one blast shall be blown on the trumpet,    And the earth and the mountains shall be upheaved, and shall both be crushed  into dust at a single crushing,    On that day the woe that must come suddenly shall suddenly come,4    And the heaven shall cleave asunder, for on that day it shall be fragile;    And the angels shall be on its sides, and over them on that day eight shall  bear up the throne of thy Lord.    On that day ye shall be brought before Him: none of your hidden deeds shall  remain hidden:    And he who shall have his book given to him in his right hand, will say to  his friends, \"Take ye it; read ye my book;    I ever thought that to this my reckoning I should come.\"    And his shall be a life that shall please him well,    In a lofty garden,    Whose clusters shall be near at hand:    \"Eat ye and drink with healthy relish, as the meed of what ye sent on  beforehand in the days which are past.\"    But he who shall have his book given into his left hand, will say, \"O that my  book had never been given me!    And that I had never known my reckoning!    O that death had made an end of me!    My wealth hath not profited me!    My power hath perished from me!\"    \"Lay ye hold on him and chain him,    Then at the Hell-fire burn him,    Then into a chain whose length is seventy cubits thrust him;    For he believed not in God, the Great,    And was not careful to feed the poor;    No friend therefore shall he have here this day,    Nor food, but corrupt sores,    Which none shall eat but the sinners.\"    It needs not that I swear by what ye see,    And by that which ye see not,    That this verily is the word of an apostle worthy of all honour!    And that it is not the word of a poethow little do ye believe!    Neither is it the word of a soothsayer (Kahin)how little do ye receive  warning!    It is a missive from the Lord of the worlds.    But if Muhammad had fabricated concerning us any sayings,    We had surely seized him by the right hand,    And had cut through the vein of his neck.5    Nor would We have withheld any one of you from him.    But, verily, It (the Koran) is a warning for the God-fearing;    And we well know that there are of you who treat it as a falsehood.    But it shall be the despair of infidels,    For it is the very truth of sure knowledge.

True, indeed, is that with which ye are threatened,    And lo! the judgment will surely come.2    By the star-tracked heaven!    Ye are discordant in what ye say;    But whose turneth him from the truth, is turned from it by a divine decree.    Perish the liars,    Who are bewildered in the depths of ignorance!    They ask, \"When this day of judgment?\"    On that day they shall be tormented at the fire.    \"Taste ye of this your torment, whose speedy coming ye challenged.\"    But the God-fearing shall dwell amid gardens and fountains,    Enjoying what their Lord hath given them, because, aforetime they were well-  doers:    But little of the night was it that they slept,    And at dawn they prayed for pardon,    And gave due share of their wealth to the suppliant and the outcast.    On Earth are signs for men of firm belief,    And also in your own selves: Will ye not then behold them?    The Heaven hath sustenance for you, and it containeth that which you are  promised.    By the Lord then of the heaven and of the earth, I swear that this is the  truth, even as ye speak yourselves.3    Hath the story reached thee of Abraham's honoured guests?4    When they went in unto him and said, \"Peace!\" he replied, \"Peace:they are  strangers.\"    And he went apart to his family, and brought a fatted calf,    And set it before them. He said, \"Eat ye not?\"    And he conceived a fear of them. They said to him, \"Fear not;\" and announced  to him a wise son.    His wife came up with outcry: she smote her face and said, \"What I, old and  barren!\"    They said, \"Thus saith thy Lord. He truly is the Wise, the Knowing.\"    Said he, \"And what, O messengers, is your errand?\"    They said, \"To a wicked people are we sent,    To hurl upon them stones of clay,    Destined5 by thy Lord for men guilty of excesses.\"    And we brought forth the believers who were in the city:    But we found not in it but one family of Muslims.    And signs we left in it for those who dread the afflictive chastisement,    And in Moses: when we sent him to Pharaoh with manifest power:    But relying on his forces6 he turned his back and said, \"Sorcerer, or  Possessed.\"    So we seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea; for of all blame  was he worthy.    And in Ad: when we sent against them the desolating blast:    It touched not aught over which it came, but it turned it to dust.    And in Themoud:7 when it was said to them, \"Enjoy yourselves for yet a  while.\"    But they rebelled against their Lord's command: so the tempest took them as  they watched its coming.8    They were not able to stand upright, and could not help themselves.

Once or twice a  year all the material should be taken out and a fresh start made.    [Illustration: Fig. 73. House for a dozen fowls. Floor, 8 ft. x 8 ft.;  height at sides, 4 ft.; height in middle, 7 ft.]    When kept in a house having an earth floor, fowls will scratch aside the  litter from small spaces and wallow and dust themselves. In houses  having hard floors, shallow boxes about 2 ft. square, containing  several inches of dry earth, are placed for the birds' dust baths. Fresh  earth must be provided frequently or they will not use the bath as  freely as is desirable. For use in winter the earth must be so dry that  it will not freeze, but the birds prefer earth that is slightly moist.  The first function of the dust bath is to clean the feathers, and damp  earth does this much better than earth that is very dry. In wallowing to  clean their plumage fowls also rid themselves of lice. When it is not  convenient to store much earth, the same material may do double  service--first in the dust bath, then on the droppings board.    [Illustration: Fig. 74. Small houses in back yard]    In a bare yard the soil should be turned over often, all the matter that  can be raked up with a fine rake having first been removed. A yard that  is in grass requires little care except near the house, where the ground  may be bare. Here it should be forked over occasionally.    =Feeding.= The feeding of a small flock of fowls is a very simple  process. The table and kitchen waste of an ordinary family will furnish  all the soft food that they need, and usually enough green food to  prevent their suffering for lack of such foods if no other provision is  made for supplying them. This waste should not be carried from the house  as it is made, and thrown on the ground for the fowls to pick out of the  dirt. A better way is to provide a covered jar large enough to hold the  accumulation of this material for a day. Into this may be put all the  leavings from the table, except such things as orange and banana  peelings, large bones, and pieces of fat meat. Once a day, at whatever  time is most convenient, the contents of the jar should be mixed with as  much corn meal and bran (equal parts by measure) as will take up the  water in them and make a moist but not sloppy mash. This should be fed  in a clean trough. If the trough stands high enough from the floor to  keep the contents clean, it will do no harm if more food is given than  the birds will eat up at once, but the quantity given should never be so  great that it will not be eaten before the next feeding time.    Most people find the morning the most convenient time to give the mash.  If the mash is fed in the morning, a small feed of hard grain should be  given about noon, and a more liberal one an hour or two before sunset.  Some poultry keepers feed the different grains separately; others mix  them before feeding. Advocates of different practices often imagine  advantages for that which they favor, but no advantage can be  demonstrated for either. Wheat and cracked corn are the grains most used  in this country; they are about equal in feeding value. As corn is  nearly always cheaper than wheat, the usual practice is to feed about  twice as much corn. When the grains are mixed, one part (by measure) of  wheat is used to two parts of cracked corn. When they are fed  separately, it is usual to feed the wheat at noon, as the light feed,  and the corn in the evening, as the heavy feed. All the common grains  except rye make good poultry foods. Why fowls do not like rye is one of  the puzzles of poultry keeping. In some countries it is used for poultry  to a greater extent than in the United States, and fowls forced to eat  it here have done very well for short periods, but will not eat it  readily if they are accustomed to other grains and can get enough to  sustain life without it. Fowls do not like dry oats so well as corn and  wheat, but have not such a dislike for them as for rye. They are very  fond of oats soaked in water and partly sprouted.    [Illustration: Fig. 75. With curtains closed]    [Illustration: Fig. 76. With one curtain open]    [Illustration: Fig. 77. As an open-front house]    POULTRY HOUSE USED AT THE CENTRAL EXPERIMENT STATION, OTTAWA, CANADA.  (Photograph from the station)    The quantity of grain to be given any flock of fowls must be determined  by trial and observation. The grain should not be fed in troughs from  which the birds can eat it very quickly, but scattered in the litter on  the floor, so that the fowls will take exercise scratching it out, and  eat slowly. There is an advantage in giving some soft and quickly  digested food, but if too much of the food can be eaten quickly, the  birds do not take exercise enough. When there is grass in the poultry  yard, it is a good plan to scatter the grain in the grass sometimes in  fine weather. The hens will find it all, and in scratching it out will  bring up the dead grass, and a better sod will grow afterward.    [Illustration: Fig. 78. Flock of Barred Plymouth Rocks]    A dozen medium-sized fowls, if fed in the morning with the mash  described above, would probably need a little over a pint of grain in  the middle of the day and about a quart toward evening. An experienced  feeder can usually tell by the eagerness of the fowls for their food  whether to increase or diminish the quantity; but the most expert  poultry keeper does not rely upon this kind of observation alone.  Occasionally, before giving food, he looks in the litter to see if there  is grain left there from previous feedings, and if he finds much, gives  no more until the birds have eaten this all up clean.    Water should be given as often as is necessary to keep the supply quite  fresh. In cool (but not freezing) weather, once a day is usually  sufficient. In hot weather the water should be fresh two or three times  a day, in order that the birds may have cool drinks. In freezing weather  many poultry keepers give the water warm, because then it does not  freeze so quickly. The advantage of this is very slight, and wattles  that are wet with warm water in extreme cold weather become especially  susceptible to frost. It is not really necessary to give fowls water  when they can get snow or ice in a form in which they can eat it.    [Illustration: Fig. 79. Flock of Single-Comb White Leghorns]    Hens that are laying must be well supplied with oyster shells or lime in  some form for the shells of the eggs. They can get a part of the lime  required for this purpose from the lime in foodstuffs, but not nearly  enough to make good thick shells for all their eggs when they are laying  well. Ground oyster shells are sold by all dealers in poultry supplies.    [Illustration: Fig. 80. White Wyandotte hen and chicks]    =Growing chickens.= Where old fowls have to be kept in close  confinement, very little can be done in growing chickens. Some amateur  poultry keepers raise in small, bare yards birds that are as good as the  average chickens grown under more favorable conditions, but where one  succeeds in doing this a hundred fail. Most of the chickens grown in  close quarters are very poor indeed in comparison with farm-grown  chickens, and quite unfit to be kept for laying or breeding purposes.  Those who succeed in growing good chickens in a small place usually give  a great deal more time to the work than the chickens produced are worth.  The best way for a poultry keeper so situated to get as much as possible  of the pleasure of this interesting line of work is to hatch a few  broods and, when the chicks are large enough, broil, eat, or sell all  but a few of the best pullets and one or two cockerels. If these  thrive, they may be worth keeping for a year; but if, as they mature,  they do not seem rugged, it is not wise to use them for laying stock.    Where there is room to give young chickens a good grass yard, a limited  number can be grown to maturity year after year on a town lot and used  for laying and breeding purposes. Many town poultry keepers who might  grow a few very good chickens never grow a good one because they always  try to raise too many for the space at their disposal. Fifty or a  hundred chickens may be kept until two months old on a plot of land only  large enough to carry twelve or fifteen to maturity. So people start out  with a great many more chickens than they ought to have on their land,  never thinking that the better their chickens do at the start the sooner  they will begin to overcrowd their quarters, and that when that stage is  reached, the promising results of several months' work may in a few days  be ruined beyond remedy. After they are two or three months old, young  chickens will not make the best growth of which they are capable unless  they have either a great deal of room or a great deal more care than  most people who raise only a few, and have other work to do, can afford  to give them.      SMALL FLOCKS ON ORDINARY FARMS    =Numbers in flocks.= The ordinary farm flock consists of from fifty to  one hundred adult fowls and, during the growing season, from one hundred  to two hundred chickens. The old stock is usually kept in one or more  small houses located among the other outbuildings, and all run together  during the day. If the farmer wants to keep the fowls out of the  dooryard and the kitchen garden, he does not make yards for the fowls,  but incloses the dooryard and garden. Outside of these the birds go  where they please. The coops for the young chickens are often kept in  the dooryard or the garden until the chickens are weaned, but after  that the young birds are nearly always turned out to take their chances  with the old ones.
