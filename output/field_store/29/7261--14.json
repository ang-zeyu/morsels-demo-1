FOOTNOTE:    [Footnote 39: This practice appears to have been prevalent in some parts  of India from a very ancient time. The \"Shushruta,\" a work on medicine  some two thousand years old, describes the wounding of the lingam with  the teeth as one of the causes of a disease treated upon in that work.  Traces of the practice are found as far back as the eighth century, for  various kinds of the Auparishtaka are represented in the sculptures of  many Shaiva temples at Bhuvaneshwara, near Cuttack, in Orissa, and which  were built about that period. From these sculptures being found in such  places, it would seem that this practice was popular in that part of the  country at that time. It does not seem to be so prevalent now in  Hindustan, its place perhaps is filled up by the practice of sodomy,  introduced since the Mahomedan period.]          CHAPTER X.    OF THE WAY HOW TO BEGIN AND HOW TO END THE CONGRESS.    DIFFERENT KINDS OF CONGRESS AND LOVE QUARRELS.      In the pleasure-room, decorated with flowers, and fragrant with  perfumes, attended by his friends and servants, the citizen should  receive the woman, who will come bathed and dressed, and will invite her  to take refreshment and to drink freely. He should then seat her on his  left side, and holding her hair, and touching also the end and knot of  her garment, he should gently embrace her with his right arm. They  should then carry on an amusing conversation on various subjects, and  may also talk suggestively of things which would be considered as  coarse, or not to be mentioned generally in society. They may then sing,  either with or without gesticulations, and play on musical instruments,  talk about the arts, and persuade each other to drink. At last when the  woman is overcome with love and desire, the citizen should dismiss the  people that may be with him, giving them flowers, ointment, and betel  leaves, and then when the two are left alone, they should proceed as has  been already described in the previous chapters.    Such is the beginning of sexual union. At the end of the congress, the  lovers with modesty, and not looking at each other, should go separately  to the washing-room. After this, sitting in their own places, they  should eat some betel leaves, and the citizen should apply with his own  hand to the body of the woman some pure sandal wood ointment, or  ointment of some other kind. He should then embrace her with his left  arm, and with agreeable words should cause her to drink from a cup held  in his own hand, or he may give her water to drink. They can then eat  sweetmeats, or anything else, according to their likings, and may drink  fresh juice,[40] soup, gruel, extracts of meat, sherbet, the juice of  mangoe fruits, the extract of the juice of the citron tree mixed with  sugar, or anything that may be liked in different countries, and known  to be sweet, soft, and pure. The lovers may also sit on the terrace of  the palace or house, and enjoy the moonlight, and carry on an agreeable  conversation. At this time, too, while the woman lies in his lap, with  her face towards the moon, the citizen should show her the different  planets, the morning star, the polar star, and the seven Rishis, or  Great Bear.    This is the end of sexual union.    Congress is of the following kinds, viz.:       Loving congress.     Congress of subsequent love.     Congress of artificial love.     Congress of transferred love.     Congress like that of eunuchs.     Deceitful congress.     Congress of spontaneous love.    (1). When a man and a woman, who have been in love with each other for  some time, come together with great difficulty, or when one of the two  returns from a journey, or is reconciled after having been separated on  account of a quarrel, then congress is called the \"loving congress.\" It  is carried on according to the liking of the lovers, and as long as they  choose.    (2). When two persons come together, while their love for each other is  still in its infancy, their congress is called the \"congress of  subsequent love.\"    (3). When a man carries on the congress by exciting himself by means of  the sixty-four ways, such as kissing, etc., etc., or when a man and a  woman come together, though in reality they are both attached to  different persons, their congress is then called \"congress of artificial  love.\" At this time all the ways and means mentioned in the Kama Shastra  should be used.    (4). When a man, from the beginning to the end of the congress, though  having connection with the women, thinks all the time that he is  enjoying another one whom he loves, it is called the \"congress of  transferred love.\"    (5). Congress between a man and a female water carrier, or a female  servant of a caste lower than his own, lasting only until the desire is  satisfied, is called \"congress like that of eunuchs.\" Here external  touches, kisses, and manipulations are not to be employed.    (6). The congress between a courtezan and a rustic, and that between  citizens and the women of villages, and bordering countries, is called,  \"deceitful congress.\"    (7). The congress that takes place between two persons who are attached  to one another, and which is done according to their own liking is  called \"spontaneous congress.\"    Thus ends the kinds of congress.    We shall now speak of love quarrels.    A woman who is very much in love with a man cannot bear to hear the name  of her rival mentioned, or to have any conversation regarding her, or to  be addressed by her name through mistake. If such takes place, a great  quarrel arises, and the woman cries, becomes angry, tosses her hair  about, strikes her lover, falls from her bed or seat, and, casting aside  her garlands and ornaments, throws herself down on the ground.    At this time, the lover should attempt to reconcile her with  conciliatory words, and should take her up carefully and place her on  her bed. But she, not replying to his questions, and with increased  anger, should bend down his head by pulling his hair, and having kicked  him once, twice, or thrice on his arms, head, bosom or back, should then  proceed to the door of the room. Dattaka says that she should then sit  angrily near the door and shed tears, but should not go out, because she  would be found fault with for going away. After a time, when she thinks  that the conciliatory words and actions of her lover have reached their  utmost, she should then embrace him, talking to him with harsh and  reproachful words, but at the same time showing a loving desire for  congress.    When the woman is in her own house, and has quarrelled with her lover,  she should go to him and show how angry she is, and leave him.  Afterwards the citizen having sent the Vita,[41] the Vidushaka[41] or  the Pithamurda[41] to pacify her, she should accompany them back to the  house, and spend the night with her lover.    Thus end the love quarrels.    In conclusion.    A man, employing the sixty-four means mentioned by Babhravya, obtains  his object, and enjoys the woman of the first quality. Though he may  speak well on other subjects, if he does not know the sixty-four  divisions, no great respect is paid to him in the assembly of the  learned. A man, devoid of other knowledge, but well acquainted with the  sixty-four divisions, becomes a leader in any society of men and women.  What man will not respect the sixty-four parts,[42] considering they are  respected by the learned, by the cunning, and by the courtezans. As the  sixty-four parts are respected, are charming, and add to the talent of  women, they are called by the Acharyas dear to women. A man skilled in  the sixty-four parts is looked upon with love by his own wife, by the  wives of others, and by courtezans.

ABOUT THE ACQUISITION OF A WIFE.          CHAPTER I.    ON MARRIAGE.      When a girl of the same caste, and a virgin, is married in accordance  with the precepts of Holy Writ, the results of such an union are: the  acquisition of Dharma and Artha, offspring, affinity, increase of  friends, and untarnished love. For this reason a man should fix his  affections upon a girl who is of good family, whose parents are alive,  and who is three years or more younger than himself. She should be born  of a highly respectable family, possessed of wealth, well connected, and  with many relations and friends. She should also be beautiful, of a good  disposition, with lucky marks on her body, and with good hair, nails,  teeth, ears, eyes, and breasts, neither more nor less than they ought to  be, and no one of them entirely wanting, and not troubled with a sickly  body. The man should, of course, also possess these qualities himself.  But at all events, says Ghotakamukha, a girl who has been already joined  with others (_i.e._, no longer a maiden) should never be loved, for it  would be reproachable to do such a thing.    Now in order to bring about a marriage with such a girl as described  above, the parents and relations of the man should exert themselves, as  also such friends on both sides as may be desired to assist in the  matter. These friends should bring to the notice of the girl's parents,  the faults, both present and future, of all the other men that may wish  to marry her, and should at the same time extol even to exaggeration  all the excellencies, ancestral, and paternal, of their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2785"],[0,"The Elusive Pimpernel (#14)"],[1,"and  of triumph with which Candeille calmly regarded her.    Afterwards she would willingly have bitten out her tongue for her  vehemence, but for the moment she was absolutely incapable of checking  the torrent of her own emotions.    \"Mademoiselle Candeille, indeed?\" she said in wrathful scorn, \"Desiree  Candeille, you mean, Lady Blakeney! my mother's kitchen-maid, flaunting  shamelessly my dear mother's jewels which she has stolen mayhap...\"    The young girl was trembling from head to foot, tears of anger obscured  her eyes; her voice, which fortunately remained low--not much above a  whisper--was thick and husky.    \"Juliette! Juliette! I entreat you,\" admonished Marguerite, \"you must  control yourself, you must, indeed you must. Mademoiselle Candeille, I  beg of you to retire....\"    But Candeille--well-schooled in the part she had to play--had no  intention of quitting the field of battle. The more wrathful and excited  Mademoiselle de Marny became the more insolent and triumphant waxed  the young actress' whole attitude. An ironical smile played round the  corners of her mouth, her almond-shaped eyes were half-closed, regarding  through dropping lashed the trembling figure of the young impoverished  aristocrat. Her head was thrown well back, in obvious defiance of  the social conventions, which should have forbidden a fracas in Lady  Blakeney's hospitable house, and her fingers provocatively toyed with  the diamond necklace which glittered and sparkled round her throat.    She had no need to repeat the words of a well-learnt part: her own wit,  her own emotions and feelings helped her to act just as her employer  would have wished her to do. Her native vulgarity helped her to assume  the very bearing which he would have desired. In fact, at this moment  Desiree Candeille had forgotten everything save the immediate present: a  more than contemptuous snub from one of those penniless aristocrats, who  had rendered her own sojourn in London so unpleasant and unsuccessful.    She had suffered from these snubs before, but had never had the chance  of forcing an esclandre, as a result of her own humiliation. That spirit  of hatred for the rich and idle classes, which was so characteristic of  revolutionary France, was alive and hot within her: she had never had  an opportunity--she, the humble fugitive actress from a minor Paris  theatre--to retort with forcible taunts to the ironical remarks made at  and before her by the various poverty-stricken but haughty emigres who  swarmed in those very same circles of London society into which she  herself had vainly striven to penetrate.    Now at last, one of this same hated class, provoked beyond self-control,  was allowing childish and unreasoning fury to outstrip the usual calm  irony of aristocratic rebuffs.    Juliette had paused awhile, in order to check the wrathful tears which,  much against her will, were choking the words in her throat and blinding  her eyes.    \"Hoity! toity!\" laughed Candeille, \"hark at the young baggage!\"    But Juliette had turned to Marguerite and began explaining volubly:    \"My mother's jewels!\" she said in the midst of her tears, \"ask her  how she came by them. When I was obliged to leave the home of my  fathers,--stolen from me by the Revolutionary Government--I contrived to  retain my mother's jewels... you remember, I told you just now.... The  Abbe Foucquet--dear old man! Saved them for me... that and a little  money which I had... he took charge of them... he said he would place  them in safety with the ornaments of his church, and now I see them  round that woman's neck... I know that he would not have parted with  them save with his life.\"    All the while that the young girl spoke in a voice half-choked with  sobs, Marguerite tried with all the physical and mental will at her  command to drag her out of the room and thus to put a summary ending to  this unpleasant scene. She ought to have felt angry with Juliette for  this childish and senseless outburst, were it not for the fact that  somehow she knew within her innermost heart that all this had been  arranged and preordained: not by Fate--not by a Higher Hand, but by the  most skilful intriguer present-day France had ever known.    And even now, as she was half succeeding in turning Juliette away from  the sight of Candeille, she was not the least surprised or startled  at seeing Chauvelin standing in the very doorway through which she had  hoped to pass. One glance at his face had made her fears tangible and  real: there was a look of satisfaction and triumph in his pale, narrow  eyes, a flash in them of approbation directed at the insolent attitude  of the French actress: he looked like the stage-manager of a play,  content with the effect his own well-arranged scenes were producing.    What he hoped to gain by this--somewhat vulgar--quarrel between the two  women, Marguerite of course could not guess: that something was lurking  in his mind, inimical to herself and to her husband, she did not for a  moment doubt, and at this moment she felt that she would have given  her very life to induce Candeille and Juliette to cease this passage of  arms, without further provocation on either side.    But though Juliette might have been ready to yield to Lady Blakeney's  persuasion, Desiree Candeille, under Chauvelin's eye, and fired by her  own desire to further humiliate this overbearing aristocrat, did not  wish the little scene to end so tamely just yet.    \"Your old calotin was made to part with his booty, m'dear,\" she said,  with a contemptuous shrug of her bare shoulders. \"Paris and France have  been starving these many years past: a paternal government seized all  it could with which to reward those that served it well, whilst all that  would have been brought bread and meat for the poor was being greedily  stowed away by shameless traitors!\"    Juliette winced at the insult.    \"Oh!\" she moaned, as she buried her flaming face in her hands.    Too late now did she realise that she had deliberately stirred up a  mud-heap and sent noisome insects buzzing about her ears.    \"Mademoiselle,\" said Marguerite authoritatively, \"I must ask you to  remember that Mlle. de Marny is my friend and that you are a guest in my  house.\"    \"Aye! I try not to forget it,\" rejoined Candeille lightly, \"but of a  truth you must admit, Citizeness, that it would require the patience  of a saint to put up with the insolence of a penniless baggage, who but  lately has had to stand her trial in her own country for impurity of  conduct.\"    There was a moment's silence, whilst Marguerite distinctly heard a  short sigh of satisfaction escaping from the lips of Chauvelin. Then a  pleasant laugh broke upon the ears of the four actors who were enacting  the dramatic little scene, and Sir Percy Blakeney, immaculate in his  rich white satin coat and filmy lace ruffles, exquisite in manners and  courtesy, entered the little boudoir, and with his long back slightly  bent, his arm outstretched in a graceful and well-studied curve, he  approached Mademoiselle Desiree Candeille.    \"May I have the honour,\" he said with his most elaborate air of courtly  deference, \"of conducting Mademoiselle to her chaise?\"    In the doorway just behind him stood His Royal Highness the Prince of  Wales chatting with apparent carelessness to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and  Lord Anthony Dewhurst. A curtain beyond the open door was partially  drawn aside, disclosing one or two brilliantly dressed groups, strolling  desultorily through the further rooms.    The four persons assembled in the little boudoir had been so absorbed  by their own passionate emotions and the violence of their quarrel  that they had not noticed the approach of Sir Percy Blakeney and of his  friends. Juliette and Marguerite certainly were startled and Candeille  was evidently taken unawares. Chauvelin alone seemed quite indifferent  and stood back a little when Sir Percy advanced, in order to allow him  to pass.    But Candeille recovered quickly enough from her surprise: without  heeding Blakeney's proffered arm, she turned with all the airs of an  insulted tragedy queen towards Marguerite.    \"So 'tis I,\" she said with affected calm, \"who am to bear every insult  in a house in which I was bidden as a guest. I am turned out like some  intrusive and importunate beggar, and I, the stranger in this land, am  destined to find that amidst all these brilliant English gentlemen there  is not one man of honour.    \"M. Chauvelin,\" she added loudly, \"our beautiful country has, meseems,  deputed you to guard the honour as well as the worldly goods of your  unprotected compatriots. I call upon you, in the name of France, to  avenge the insults offered to me to-night.\"    She looked round defiantly from one to the other of the several faces  which were now turned towards her, but no one, for the moment, spoke or  stirred. Juliette, silent and ashamed, had taken Marguerite's hand in  hers, and was clinging to it as if wishing to draw strength of character  and firmness of purpose through the pores of the other woman's delicate  skin.    Sir Percy with backbone still bent in a sweeping curve had not relaxed  his attitude of uttermost deference. The Prince of Wales and his friends  were viewing the scene with slightly amused aloofness.    For a moment--seconds at most--there was dead silence in the room,  during which time it almost seemed as if the beating of several hearts  could be distinctly heard.    Then Chauvelin, courtly and urbane, stepped calmly forward.    \"Believe me, Citizeness,\" he said, addressing Candeille directly and  with marked emphasis, \"I am entirely at your command, but am I not  helpless, seeing that those who have so grossly insulted you are of your  own irresponsible, if charming, sex?\"    Like a great dog after a nap, Sir Percy Blakeney straightened his long  back and stretched it out to its full length.    \"La!\" he said pleasantly, \"my ever "]]]
