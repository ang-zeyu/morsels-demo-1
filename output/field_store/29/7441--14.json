[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38356"],[0,"Speciation of the Wandering Shrew (#14)"],[1,"the Rocky Mountains show an amazing series of relationships with  the montane _S. v. obscurus_. In Utah, as previously pointed out,  complete intergradation occurs. At 1 mi. N Heath, Washington Co.,  Idaho, the lowland and the highland forms approach each other within a  short distance and still maintain a degree of distinctness, especially  in size. In northwestern Montana intergradation is extensive  (Clothier, 1950). In northeastern Washington distinctly separable  populations occur within a few miles of one another. In southern  British Columbia some populations are clearly intergrades while at 6  mi. S Yahk intergradation seemingly has not taken place. Where some  intergradation has occurred the result often has been increased size  of the lowland shrews, although they usually retain the reddish summer  pelage rather than acquiring the more grayish pelage of _obscurus_.  The name _dobsoni_ was based upon shrews from a place where lowland  and highland forms occur almost together with only a slight amount of  intergradation. Examples of \"_dobsoni_\" may not with certainty be  distinguished from typical _vagrans_ except that they are, as Merriam  (1895:68-69) points out, somewhat larger. Merriam (_loc. cit._)  further notes that _dobsoni_ is \"intermediate in size and cranial  characters between _S. vagrans_ and _obscurus_;\" a statement which  hits very close to the heart of the matter. I consider the name  _dobsoni_ to apply to intergrades. To attempt to apply the name to the  highly variable populations of intergrades from British Columbia to  southern Idaho seems inadvisable. I have examined the possibility of  using the name _amoenus_ for the animals from this region. The  characters which set _amoenus_ apart from _vagrans_, slightly shorter  tail and slightly darker summer pelage, however, are not universally  found in shrews from the Columbian Plateau and eastern Great Basin and  furthermore these differences between _amoenus_ and _vagrans_ do not  seem to me to be of great enough magnitude to warrant subspecific  recognition of the former. Thus the name _S. v. vagrans_ may apply to  shrews in the region under consideration. The subspecies, as thus  thought of, embraces several incipient subspecies, namely (1) the  populations on the isolated mountain ranges of Nevada, (2) the coastal  rain forest population and possibly (3) the population on the  Columbian Plateau.    In western British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon no evidences of  intergradation between _S. v. vagrans_ and the races _setosus_,  _permiliensis_, _bairdi_, _yaquinae_, or _pacificus_ are seen. In this  region _S. v. vagrans_ occurs sympatrically with one or the other of  these subspecies. Different degrees of differentiation thus obtain  between the subspecies _vagrans_ as here defined and the surrounding  subspecies of _Sorex vagrans_ to wit: complete intergradation and  allopatry in Utah with _S. v. obscurus_; partial intergradation and  partial sympatry with _S. v. obscurus_ in the foothill region from  Idaho to British Columbia; no intergradation and complete sympatry  with all the other races of _Sorex vagrans_ from the Cascades to the  coast and south to San Francisco Bay. The relationship of _S. v.  vagrans_ to the wandering shrews of the high Sierra is discussed on  page 58.    Throughout most of the Great Basin and Columbian Plateau _Sorex  vagrans_ is, with the exception of the rare _S. merriami_ and _S.  preblei_, the only small shrew. In the Cascades and in the coastal  lowlands it is the only small shrew except for _S. cinereus_ and _S.  trigonirostris_, both extremely rare and local in this region. _S.  vagrans_ seemingly competes to a certain extent with the larger _S.  trowbridgii_ in western Washington and seems to be partially dominant  to _trowbridgii_, at least in marshy habitats (Dalquest, 1941:171).    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 1197.

It is, indeed, well known to the intelligent  and well-informed part of the Company's servants, that an extensive and  numerous tribe of Indians, called E-arch-e-thinnews, whose country lies  far West of any of the Company's or Canadian settlements, must have  traffic with the Spaniards on the West side of the Continent; because  some of the Indians who formerly traded to York Fort, when at war with  those people, frequently found saddles, bridles, muskets, and many other  articles, in their possession, which were undoubtedly of Spanish  manufactory.    I have seen several Indians who have been so far West as to cross the  top of that immense chain of mountains which run from North to South of  the continent of America. Beyond those mountains all rivers run to the  Westward. I must here observe, that all the Indians I ever heard relate  their excursions in that country, had invariably got so far to the  South, that they did not experience any Winter, nor the least appearance  of either frost or snow, though sometimes they have been absent eighteen  months, or two years.[21]    [21] In the year 1745 Anthony Hendry, under instructions from the  Hudson's Bay Company, had travelled inland from York Factory to the  upper waters of the Saskatchewan River, where he met the  E-arch-e-thinnews or Blackfeet Indians.    [P] As to a passage through the continent of America by the way of  Hudson's Bay, it has so long been explored, notwithstanding what Mr.  Ellis has urged in its favour, and the place it has found in the  visionary Map of the American Traveller, that any comment on it would be  quite unnecessary. My latitude only will be a sufficient proof that no  such passage is in existence.

November 6th.]    [Sidenote: 1769. November.]    Having made every necessary arrangement for my departure on the sixth of  November, I took leave of the Governor, and my other friends, at Prince  of Wales's Fort, and began my journey, under the salute of seven  cannon.    [Sidenote: 8th.]    {2} The weather at that time being very mild, made it but indifferent  hauling,[Q] and all my crew being heavy laden, occasioned us to make but  short journeys; however, on the eighth, we crossed the North branch of  Po-co-ree-kis-co River,[22] and that night put up in a small tuft of  woods, which is between it and Seal River. In the night, one of the  Northern Indians deserted; and as all the rest of my crew were heavy  laden, I was under the necessity of hauling the sledge he had left,  which however was not very heavy, as it scarcely exceeded sixty pounds.    [Sidenote: 9th.]    The weather still continued very fine and pleasant; we directed our  course to the West North West, and early in the day crossed Seal River.  In the course of this day's journey we met several Northern Indians, who  were going to the factory with furs and venison; and as we had not  killed any deer from our leaving the Fort, I got several joints of  venison from those strangers, and gave them a note on the Governor for  payment, which seemed perfectly agreeable to all parties.    [Sidenote: 1769. November.]    When on the North West side of Seal River, I asked Captain Chawchinahaw  the distance, and probable time it would take, before we could reach the  main woods; which he assured me would not exceed four or five days  journey. This put both me and my companions in good {3} spirits, and we  continued our course between the West by North and North West, in daily  expectation of arriving at those woods, which we were told would furnish  us with every thing the country affords. These accounts were so far from  being true, that after we had walked double the time here mentioned, no  signs of woods were to be seen in the direction we were then steering;  but we had frequently seen the looming of woods to the South West.    [Sidenote: 19th.]    The cold being now very intense, our small stock of English provisions  all expended, and not the least thing to be got on the bleak hills we  had for some time been walking on, it became necessary to strike more to  the Westward, which we accordingly did, and the next evening arrived at  some small patches of low scrubby woods, where we saw the tracks of  several deer,[23] and killed a few partridges. The road we had traversed  for many days before, was in general so rough and stony, that our  sledges were daily breaking; and to add to the inconveniency, the land  was so barren, as not to afford us materials for repairing them: but the  few woods we now fell in with, amply supplied us with necessaries for  those repairs; and as we were then enabled each night to pitch proper  tents, our lodging was much more comfortable than it had been for many  nights before, while we were on the barren grounds, where, in general,  we thought ourselves well off if we could scrape together as many shrubs  as would make a fire; but it {4} was scarcely ever in our power to make  any other defence against the weather, than by digging a hole in the  snow down to the moss, wrapping ourselves up in our clothing, and lying  down in it, with our sledges set up edgeways to windward.    [Sidenote: 21st.]    [Sidenote: 1769. November.]    On the twenty-first, we did not move; so the Indian men went a hunting,  and the women cut holes in the ice and caught a few fish in a small  lake, by the side of which we had pitched our tents. At night the men  returned with some venison, having killed three deer, which was without  doubt very acceptable; but our number being great, and the Indians  having such enormous stomachs, very little was left but fragments after  the two or three first good meals. Having devoured the three deer, and  given some necessary repairs to our sledges and snow shoes, which only  took one day, we again proceeded on toward the North West by West and  West North West, through low scrubby pines,[24] intermixed with some  dwarf larch,[25] which is commonly called juniper in Hudson's Bay. In  our road we frequently saw the tracks of deer, and many musk-oxen,[26]  as they are called there; but none of my companions were so fortunate as  to kill any of them: so that a few partridges were all we could get to  live on, and those were so scarce, that we seldom could kill as many as  would amount to half a bird a day for each man; which, considering we  had nothing else for the twenty-four hours, was in reality next to  nothing.    [Sidenote: 26th.]    {5} By this time I found that Captain Chawchinahaw had not the  prosperity of the undertaking at heart; he often painted the  difficulties in the worst colours, took every method to dishearten me  and my European companions, and several times hinted his desire of our  returning back to the factory: but finding I was determined to proceed,  he took such methods as he thought would be most likely to answer his  end; one of which was, that of not administering toward our support;  so that we were a considerable time without any other subsistence, but  what our two home-guard (Southern) Indians procured, and the little that  I and the two European men could kill; which was very disproportionate  to our wants, as we had to provide for several women and children who  were with us.    [Sidenote: 29th.]    Chawchinahaw finding that this kind of treatment was not likely to  complete his design, and that we were not to be starved into compliance,  at length influenced several of the best Northern Indians to desert in  the night, who took with them several bags of my ammunition, some pieces  of iron work, such as hatchets, ice chissels, files, &c., as well as  several other useful articles.    [Sidenote: 30th.]    [Sidenote: 1769. November.]    When I became acquainted with this piece of villany, I asked  Chawchinahaw the reason of such behaviour. To which he answered, that he  knew nothing of the affair: but as that was the case, it would not be  {6} prudent, he said, for us to proceed any farther; adding, that he and  all the rest of his countrymen were going to strike off another way, in  order to join the remainder of their wives and families: and after  giving us a short account which way to steer our course for the nearest  part of Seal River, which he said would be our best way homeward, he and  his crew delivered me most of the things which they had in charge,  packed up their awls, and set out toward the South West, making the  woods ring with their"]]]
