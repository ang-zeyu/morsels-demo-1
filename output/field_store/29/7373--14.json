A  specimen has been taken by Cross (C-24-51) in the headwaters of the  Walnut River.    5. _Notropis boops._ The westernmost record is station G-5 on Grouse  Creek. This fish has been reported slightly west of this in Oklahoma on  Big Beaver Creek in Kay County (number 4776, Oklahoma A & M College  Museum of Zoology).    6. _Notropis volucellus._ Two specimens were taken at station G-8 on  Silver Creek.    7. _Percina copelandi._ The westernmost record is from station G-1, two  miles above the mouth of Grouse Creek.    The easternmost occurrences of four species are in the area studied.  These species are _Hybopsis aestivalis tetranemus_ (Station A-2),  _Notropis blennius_ (Station A-1), _Notropis girardi_ (Station A-2),  and _Fundulus kansae_ (Station A-2 and Walnut River). These fish are  associated with the Arkansas River proper and its sandy western  tributaries. In Oklahoma, these fish are found in the Arkansas River  as it proceeds eastward and in the downstream portions of some of its  tributaries. These fish show little tendency to ascend the streams of  the Flint Hills.          SUMMARY      The fish fauna of the area studied is transitional between the Ozarkian  and Great Plains faunas.    Fluctuation in water level seemed especially important in determining  distribution of fishes in the area studied. Variable climate  characteristic of the region studied causes recurrent floods and  intermittency in streams. Both of these conditions have probably been  accentuated by man's modifications of the habitat. The effects of  intermittency were most strikingly demonstrated in small creeks of the  uplands. The number of species of fish in the highly intermittent  streams was small--especially in the uppermost pools sampled--but the  actual number of fish was often high even though the number of species  was low. In several instances the only fishes found in these isolated  pools were _Lepomis cyanellus_ and _Ictalurus melas_. This phenomenon of  concentrated numbers of individuals of a few species would indicate the  presence of limiting factors that allow only those species most  tolerant of the particular factor to flourish.    Soon after rains restored flow in these intermittent creeks _L.  cyanellus_ and _I. melas_ appeared in parts of the channels that had  previously been several miles from the nearest water. Rapid upstream  movements of other species after rains was also noted.    It was impossible to ascertain the precise effects of gradient and  bottom-type on distribution, but certain species such as _Notropis  blennius_, _Notropis girardi_, and _Fundulus kansae_ were taken only in  streams with sandy bottoms. _Notropis deliciosus_ and _Hybognathus  placita_ were most abundant over sandy bottoms.    The high gradient of upland tributaries in the Flint Hills area produced  turbulence and bottoms predominantly of rubble. A fauna of which  _Etheostoma spectabile_ and _Campostoma anomalum_ were characteristic  existed in these waters while they were flowing. As flow decreased and  intermittency commenced, qualitative and quantitative changes in the  fish faunas were observed. Gradient did not change during drought, but  turbulence did. Because turbulence varies with water level as well as  gradient, the effect of gradient on fish distribution ultimately is  linked to climate.    Probably the small number of fish taken on the Walnut River in  comparison with other eastern Kansas rivers (Verdigris, Neosho) results,  in part, from the long-term pollution of the stream noted by Clapp  (1920:33) and Doze (1924). No percid fishes, black bass, or madtom  catfish were taken on the Walnut in Cowley County and the species of  _Notropis_ numbered only three.    Four faunal associations seem to be recognizable in the area.      _Arkansas River Fauna_    This fauna contained _Notropis girardi_, _Notropis blennius_, _Hybopsis  aestivalis tetranemus_, and _Fundulus kansae_ which, in this area, did  not seem to wander far from the sandy main stream of the Arkansas.  Minnows abounded; _Notropis lutrensis_ and _N. deliciosus missuriensis_  predominated; and _Notropis girardi_, _N. percobromus_, and _Hybognathus  placita_ were common. In quiet backwaters, coves, and shallow pools  _Gambusia affinis_ occurred in great numbers. _Lepisosteus osseus_  seemed to be the most important predator.      _Lower Walnut River Fauna_    The Walnut River in Cowley County supported large populations of  deep-bodied suckers, carp, and gar. _Notropis lutrensis_ and _N.  percobromus_ were characteristic minnows. _Lepomis_ _humilis_ abounded  at some stations. The fauna of the main stream of the Walnut River was  somewhat intermediate between that of the Arkansas River and that of the  three streams considered below. Fifteen of the species common to the Big  Caney, Elk, and Grouse systems were also taken in the Walnut River main  stream. Thirteen species were common to the Walnut and Arkansas rivers.  Seven species were common to all these streams.      _Caney-Elk-Grouse Main Stream Fauna_    This fauna includes fishes living not only in the main streams but also  in the lower parts of the larger tributaries of these streams. The fauna  was comparatively rich: in the main stream of Big Caney River 39 species  were taken, in Grouse Creek 35 species, in the Walnut River main stream  21 species, and in the Arkansas River 19 species. It has been pointed  out that large rivers such as the Walnut and Arkansas have been  subjected to greater direct and indirect modification by man, possibly  resulting in a less diverse fauna than would otherwise occur in these  streams. At present, there is a paucity of ecological niches in the  upland tributaries and large rivers, as compared with streams of  intermediate size. Fishes typical of the Caney-Elk-Grouse association  were _Notropis umbratilis_, _Lepomis megalotis_, _Lepomis humilis_,  _Labidesthes sicculus_, _Fundulus notatus_, and the two species of  _Micropterus (Micropterus punctulatus_ was not taken in Grouse Creek).      _Upland Tributary Fauna_    Tributary faunas were divisible into two categories: (1) Those of the  Walnut River and Grouse Creek (intermittency was severe, species were  few, with _Ictalurus melas_ and _Lepomis cyanellus_ predominating); (2)  those of Big Caney River (stream-flow was more stable, and eastern  fishes, some of which have Ozarkian affinities, occurred in greater  abundance than in any other part of the area surveyed). In the latter  streams _Campostoma anomalum_ and _Etheostoma spectabile_ usually were  dominant. _Pimephales notatus_, _Notropis volucellus_, _N. camurus_, _N.  boops_, and _N. rubellus_ characteristically occurred. _Notropis  lutrensis_ was sparsely represented in flowing tributaries. _Notropis  umbratilis_, which seems to prefer habitats intermediate between those  of _Notropis lutrensis_ and Ozarkian shiners, was usually represented.  Deep-bodied suckers and carp were not taken in upland tributaries but  _Moxostoma erythrurum_ was common and _Minytrema melanops_ was taken.    The kinds and numbers of shiners (_Notropis_) taken at different points  along Grouse Creek seem significant. _N. lutrensis_ and _N. umbratilis_  occurred throughout the stream but were rare in sluggish areas where  populations of _Gambusia affinis_, _Fundulus notatus_, and _Labidesthes  sicculus_ flourished. At the lowermost station _Notropis percobromus_  and _N. buchanani_ were taken; these were not present in other  collections. In the uppermost stations where water remained plentiful,  _N. boops_ and _N. volucellus_ were taken, and _N. rubellus_ has been  recorded.    In the broader distributional sense those fishes that seemed most  tolerant of intermittency (_Lepomis cyanellus_, _Lepomis humilis_,  _Ictalurus melas_, _Notropis lutrensis_) are widely distributed in the  Arkansas River Basin, and are common in the western part of the Arkansas  River Basin. Species less tolerant of intermittency are _Notropis  boops_, _Notropis camurus_, _Notropis rubellus_, _Notropis volucellus_,  and _Pimephales tenellus_; they have not been taken far west of the area  studied, and become more common east of it.

Once Dale, halting his horse, pointed with long arm, and Helen,  following the direction, descried several gray deer standing in a glade,  motionless, with long ears up. They made a wild and beautiful picture.  Suddenly they bounded away with remarkable springy strides.    The forest on the whole held to the level, open character, but there  were swales and stream-beds breaking up its regular conformity. Toward  noon, however, it gradually changed, a fact that Helen believed she  might have observed sooner had she been more keen. The general lay of  the land began to ascend, and the trees to grow denser.    She made another discovery. Ever since she had entered the forest she  had become aware of a fullness in her head and a something affecting  her nostrils. She imagined, with regret, that she had taken cold. But  presently her head cleared somewhat and she realized that the thick pine  odor of the forest had clogged her nostrils as if with a sweet pitch.  The smell was overpowering and disagreeable because of its strength.  Also her throat and lungs seemed to burn.    When she began to lose interest in the forest and her surroundings  it was because of aches and pains which would no longer be denied  recognition. Thereafter she was not permitted to forget them and they  grew worse. One, especially, was a pain beyond all her experience.  It lay in the muscles of her side, above her hip, and it grew to be a  treacherous thing, for it was not persistent. It came and went. After it  did come, with a terrible flash, it could be borne by shifting or easing  the body. But it gave no warning. When she expected it she was mistaken;  when she dared to breathe again, then, with piercing swiftness,  it returned like a blade in her side. This, then, was one of the  riding-pains that made a victim of a tenderfoot on a long ride. It  was almost too much to be borne. The beauty of the forest, the living  creatures to be seen scurrying away, the time, distance--everything  faded before that stablike pain. To her infinite relief she found that  it was the trot that caused this torture. When Ranger walked she did not  have to suffer it. Therefore she held him to a walk as long as she dared  or until Dale and Bo were almost out of sight; then she loped him ahead  until he had caught up.    So the hours passed, the sun got around low, sending golden shafts  under the trees, and the forest gradually changed to a brighter, but a  thicker, color. This slowly darkened. Sunset was not far away.    She heard the horses splashing in water, and soon she rode up to see the  tiny streams of crystal water running swiftly over beds of green moss.  She crossed a number of these and followed along the last one into a  more open place in the forest where the pines were huge, towering,  and far apart. A low, gray bluff of stone rose to the right, perhaps  one-third as high as the trees. From somewhere came the rushing sound of  running water.    \"Big Spring,\" announced Dale. \"We camp here. You girls have done well.\"    Another glance proved to Helen that all those little streams poured from  under this gray bluff.    \"I'm dying for a drink,\" cried Bo with her customary hyperbole.    \"I reckon you'll never forget your first drink here,\" remarked Dale.    Bo essayed to dismount, and finally fell off, and when she did get to  the ground her legs appeared to refuse their natural function, and she  fell flat. Dale helped her up.    \"What's wrong with me, anyhow?\" she demanded, in great amaze.    \"Just stiff, I reckon,\" replied Dale, as he led her a few awkward steps.    \"Bo, have you any hurts?\" queried Helen, who still sat her horse, loath  to try dismounting, yet wanting to beyond all words.    Bo gave her an eloquent glance.    \"Nell, did you have one in your side, like a wicked, long  darning-needle, punching deep when you weren't ready?\"    \"That one I'll never get over!\" exclaimed Helen, softly. Then, profiting  by Bo's experience, she dismounted cautiously, and managed to keep  upright. Her legs felt like wooden things.    Presently the girls went toward the spring.    \"Drink slow,\" called out Dale.    Big Spring had its source somewhere deep under the gray, weathered  bluff, from which came a hollow subterranean gurgle and roar of water.  Its fountainhead must have been a great well rushing up through the cold  stone.    Helen and Bo lay flat on a mossy bank, seeing their faces as they bent  over, and they sipped a mouthful, by Dale's advice, and because they  were so hot and parched and burning they wanted to tarry a moment with a  precious opportunity.    The water was so cold that it sent a shock over Helen, made her teeth  ache, and a singular, revivifying current steal all through her,  wonderful in its cool absorption of that dry heat of flesh, irresistible  in its appeal to thirst. Helen raised her head to look at this water. It  was colorless as she had found it tasteless.    \"Nell--drink!\" panted Bo. \"Think of our--old spring--in the  orchard--full of pollywogs!\"    And then Helen drank thirstily, with closed eyes, while a memory of home  stirred from Bo's gift of poignant speech.        CHAPTER VII    The first camp duty Dale performed was to throw a pack off one of the  horses, and, opening it, he took out tarpaulin and blankets, which he  arranged on the ground under a pine-tree.    \"You girls rest,\" he said, briefly.    \"Can't we help?\" asked Helen, though she could scarcely stand.    \"You'll be welcome to do all you like after you're broke in.\"    \"Broke in!\" ejaculated Bo, with a little laugh. \"I'm all broke UP now.\"    \"Bo, it looks as if Mr. Dale expects us to have quite a stay with him in  the woods.\"    \"It does,\" replied Bo, as slowly she sat down upon the blankets,  stretched out with a long sigh, and laid her head on a saddle. \"Nell,  didn't he say not to call him Mister?\"    Dale was throwing the packs off the other horses.    Helen lay down beside Bo, and then for once in her life she experienced  the sweetness of rest.    \"Well, sister, what do you intend to call him?\" queried Helen,  curiously.    \"Milt, of course,\" replied Bo.    Helen had to laugh despite her weariness and aches.    \"I suppose, then, when your Las Vegas cowboy comes along you will call  him what he called you.\"    Bo blushed, which was a rather unusual thing for her.    \"I will if I like,\" she retorted. \"Nell, ever since I could remember  you've raved about the West. Now you're OUT West, right in it good and  deep. So wake up!\"    That was Bo's blunt and characteristic way of advising the elimination  of Helen's superficialities. It sank deep. Helen had no retort. Her  ambition, as far as the West was concerned, had most assuredly not been  for such a wild, unheard-of jaunt as this. But possibly the West--a  living from day to day--was one succession of adventures, trials,  tests, troubles, and achievements. To make a place for others to live  comfortably some day! That might be Bo's meaning, embodied in her  forceful hint. But Helen was too tired to think it out then. She found  it interesting and vaguely pleasant to watch Dale.    He hobbled the horses and turned them loose. Then with ax in hand he  approached a short, dead tree, standing among a few white-barked  aspens. Dale appeared to advantage swinging the ax. With his coat off,  displaying his wide shoulders, straight back, and long, powerful arms,  he looked a young giant. He was lithe and supple, brawny but not bulky.  The ax rang on the hard wood, reverberating through the forest. A few  strokes sufficed to bring down the stub. Then he split it up. Helen was  curious to see how he kindled a fire. First he ripped splinters out of  the heart of the log, and laid them with coarser pieces on the ground.  Then from a saddlebag which hung on a near-by branch he took flint and  steel and a piece of what Helen supposed was rag or buckskin, upon  which powder had been rubbed. At any rate, the first strike of the steel  brought sparks, a blaze, and burning splinters. Instantly the flame  leaped a foot high. He put on larger pieces of wood crosswise, and the  fire roared.    That done, he stood erect, and, facing the north, he listened. Helen  remembered now that she had seen him do the same thing twice before  since the arrival at Big Spring. It was Roy for whom he was listening  and watching. The sun had set and across the open space the tips of the  pines were losing their brightness.    The camp utensils, which the hunter emptied out of a sack, gave forth a  jangle of iron and tin. Next he unrolled a large pack, the contents  of which appeared to be numerous sacks of all sizes. These evidently  contained food supplies. The bucket looked as if a horse had rolled over  it, pack and all. Dale filled it at the spring. Upon returning to the  camp-fire he poured water into a washbasin, and, getting down to his  knees, proceeded to wash his hands thoroughly. The act seemed a habit,  for Helen saw that while he was doing it he gazed off into the woods  and listened. Then he dried his hands over the fire, and, turning to the  spread-out pack, he began preparations for the meal.    Suddenly Helen thought of the man and all that his actions implied.  At Magdalena, on the stage-ride, and last night, she had trusted  this stranger, a hunter of the White Mountains, who appeared ready to  befriend her. And she had felt an exceeding gratitude. Still, she had  looked at him impersonally. But it began to dawn upon her that chance  had thrown her in the company of a remarkable man. That impression  baffled her. It did not spring from the fact that he was brave and kind  to help a young woman in peril, or that he appeared deft and quick at  camp-fire chores. Most Western men were brave, her uncle had told her,  and many were roughly kind, and all of them could cook. This hunter was  physically a wonderful"]]]
