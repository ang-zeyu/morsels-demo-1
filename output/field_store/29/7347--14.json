[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32950"],[0,"Camp and Trail (#14)"],[1," thongs. The stirrups themselves should have  light hood tapaderos, or coverings. They will help in tearing through  brush, will protect your toes, and will keep your feet dry in case of  rain. I prefer the round rather than the square skirts.    [Sidenote: Cinches]    In a cow country you will hear many and heated discussions over the  relative merits of the single broad cinch crossing rather far back; and  the double cinches, one just behind the shoulder and the other on the  curve of the belly. The double cinch is universally used by Wyoming and  Arizona cowmen; and the \"center fire\" by Californians and Mexicans--and  both with equally heated partisanship. Certainly as it would be  difficult to say which are the better horsemen, so it would be unwise to  attempt here a dogmatic settlement of the controversy.    [Illustration: _Proper Way of Arranging Straps on Holster and Saddle._]    [Illustration: _Saddle Holster--Usual Arrangement of Straps._]    [Sidenote: How to Attach the Cinch]    For ordinary mountain travel, however, I think there can be no doubt  that the double cinch is the better. It is less likely to slip forward  or back on steep hills; it need not be so tightly cinched as the \"center  fire,\" and can be adjusted, according to which you draw the tighter,  for up or down hill. The front cinch should be made of hair. I have  found that the usual cord cinches are apt to wear sores just back of the  shoulder. Webbing makes a good back cinch. The handiest rig for  attaching them is that used by the Texan and Wyoming cowmen. It is a  heavy oiled latigo strap, punched with buckle holes, passing through a  cinch ring supplied with a large buckle tongue. You can reach over and  pull it up a hole or so without dismounting. It differs from an ordinary  buckle only in that, in case the rig breaks, the strap can still be  fastened like an ordinary latigo in the diamond knot.    [Sidenote: Saddle Bags and Saddle Blankets]    On the right-hand side of your pommel will be a strap and buckle for  your riata. A pair of detachable leather saddle bags are handy. The  saddle blanket should be thick and of first quality; and should be  surmounted by a \"corona\" to prevent wrinkling under the slight movement  of the saddle.    [Sidenote: Quirts]    A heavy quirt is indispensable, both for your own mount, if he prove  refractory, but also for the persuasion of the pack horse.    [Sidenote: Sling Shots]    When with a large outfit, however, I always carry a pea shooter or sling  shot. With it a man can spot a straying animal at considerable distance,  generally much to the truant's astonishment. After a little it will  rarely be necessary to shoot; a mere snapping of the rubbers will bring  every horse into line.    [Sidenote: Bridles]    The handiest and best rig for a riding bridle can be made out of an  ordinary halter. Have your harness maker fasten a snap hook to either  side and just above the corners of the horse's mouth. When you start in  the morning you snap your bit and reins to the hooks. When you arrive in  the evening you simply unsnap the bit, and leave the halter on.    [Sidenote: Riatas and Spurs]    Rope and spurs will be necessary. I prefer the Mexican grass rope with a  brass honda to the rawhide riata, because I am used to it. I once used a  linen rope with weighted honda that was soft and threw well. The spurs  will be of good steel, of the cowboy pattern, with blunt rowels. The  smaller spurs are not so easy to reach a small horse with, and are apt  to overdo the matter when they do. The wide spur leathers are to protect  the boot from chafing on the stirrups.    [Sidenote: Scabbards]    There remains only your rifle to attend to. The usual scabbard is  invariably slung too far forward. I always move the sling strap as near  the mouth of the scabbard as it will go. The other sling strap I detach  from the scabbard and hang loopwise from the back latigo-ring. Then I  thrust the muzzle of the scabbarded rifle between the stirrup leathers  and through this loop, hang the forward sling strap over the pommel--and  there I am! The advantage is that I can remove rifle and scabbard  without unbuckling any straps. The gun should hang on the left side of  the horse so that after dismounting you need not walk around him to get  it. A little experiment will show you how near the horizontal you can  sling it without danger of its jarring out.    [Sidenote: Pack Outfits]    So much for your own riding horse. The pack outfit consists of the pack  saddle, with the apparatus to keep it firm; its padding; the kyacks, or  alforjas--sacks to sling on either side; and the lash rope and cinch  with which to throw the hitches.    [Sidenote: Pack Saddles]    The almost invariable type of pack saddle is the sawbuck. If it is  bought with especial reference to the animal it is to be used on, it is  undoubtedly the best. But nothing will more quickly gouge a hole in a  horse's back than a saddle too narrow or too wide for his especial  anatomy. A saddle of this sort bolted together can be taken apart for  easier transportation by baggage or express.    Another and very good type of pack rig is that made from an old riding  saddle. The stirrup rigging is removed, and an upright spike bolted  strongly to the cantle. The loops of the kyacks are to be hung over the  horn and this spike. Such a saddle is apt to be easy on a horse's back,  but is after all merely a make-shift for a properly constructed sawbuck.    [Illustration: _Under Side of Pack Saddles._]    [Illustration: _Shape of Collar Pad--for Pack Saddles._]    [Sidenote: Aparejos]    I shall only mention the aparejos. This rig is used for freighting boxes  and odd-shaped bundles. It is practically nothing but a heavy pad, and  is used without kyacks. You will probably never be called upon to use  it; but in another chapter I will describe one \"sling\" in order that you  may be forearmed against contingencies.    [Sidenote: Pads]    We will assume that you are possessed of a good sawbuck saddle of the  right size for your pack animal. It will have the double cinch rig. To  the under surfaces tack firmly two ordinary collar-pads by way of  softening. Beneath them you will use two blankets, each as heavy as the  one you place under your riding saddle. This abundance is necessary  because a pack \"rides dead\"--that is, does not favor the horse as does a  living rider. By way of warning, however, too much is almost as bad as  too little.    [Sidenote: Breasting and Breeching]    The almost universal saddle rigging in use the West over is a breast  strap of webbing fastened at the forward points of the saddle, and a  breech strap fastened to the back points of the saddle, with guy lines  running from the top to prevent its falling too far down the horse's  legs. This, with the double cinch, works fairly well. Its main trouble  is that the breech strap is apt to work up under the horse's tail, and  the breast strap is likely to shut off his wind at the throat.    [Sidenote: The Britten Pack Rig]    Mr. Ernest Britten, a mountaineer in the Sierras, has, however, invented  a rig which in the nicety of its compensations, and the accuracy of its  adjustments is perfection. Every one becomes a convert, and hastens to  alter his own outfit.    [Illustration: _Mr. Ernest Britten's Pack Rig._]    The breasting is a strap (_a_) running from the point of the saddle to a  padded ring in the middle of the chest. Thence another strap (_b_) runs  to the point of the saddle on the other side, where it buckles. A third  strap (_c_) in the shape of a loop goes between the fore legs and  around the front cinch.    [Sidenote: The Britten Pack Rig]    The breeching is somewhat more complicated. I think, however, with a few  rivets, straps, and buckles you will be able to alter your own saddle in  half an hour.    [Illustration: _Ordinary and Inferior Pack Rig Usually Employed._]    The back cinch you remove. A short strap (_d_), riveted to the middle of  the front cinch, passes back six inches to a ring (_e_). This ring will  rest on the middle of the belly. From the ring two other straps (_ff_)  ascend diagonally to the buckles (_g_) in the ends of the breeching.  From the ends of the breeching other straps (_h_) attach to what would  be the back cinch ring (_k_). That constitutes the breeching rig. It is  held up by a long strap (_m_) passing from one side to the other over  the horse's rump through a ring on top. The ring is attached to the  saddle by a short strap (_n_).    [Illustration: Nearing a crest and in sight of game]    Such a rig prevents the breeching from riding up or dropping down; it  gives the horse all his wind going up hill, but holds firmly going down;  when one part loosens, the other tightens; and the saddle cinch, except  to keep the saddle from turning, is practically useless and can be left  comparatively loose. I cannot too strongly recommend you, both for your  horse's comfort and your own, to adopt this rigging.    [Sidenote: Kyacks]    The kyacks, as I have said, are two sacks to be slung one on each side  of the horse. They are provided with loops by which to hang them over  the sawbucks of the saddle, and a long strap passes from the outside of  one across the saddle to a buckle on the outside of the other.    Undoubtedly the best are those made of rawhide. They weigh very little,  will stand all sorts of hard usage, hold the pack rope well, are so  stiff that they well protect the contents, and are so hard that  miscellaneous sharp-cornered utensils may be packed in them without fear  of injury either to them or the animal. They are made by lacing wet  hides, hair out, neatly and squarely over one of the wooden boxes built  to pack two five gallon oil cans. A round hardwood stick is sewn along  the top on one side--to this the sling straps are to be attached. After  the hide has dried hard, the wooden box is removed.

[4] In an article by Dr. Rees upon Bannerets, and also in the last edition  of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, we are told that Captain John Smith,  Lieutenant of Lord Stewart's troop, was the last banneret knighted upon  the field of battle. The order was conferred only for distinction in the  field of battle, and was a very high one, ranking above all other knights,  excepting the Knights of the Garter. The two tails of the pointed pennon  carried by ordinary knights were cut off, and the flag thus made square.  Hence they were called knights of the square flag.
