The author of a recent work, entitled \"Among the Spanish  People,\" describes it as being systematically gathered in Spain, where  it is regarded as a fine stomachic and cordial. It is used either in the  form of a cold decoction, sweetened, or five or six leaves are put into  a teacup, and hot tea poured upon them. The author says that the flavor  of the tea thus prepared \"is simply delicious, and no one who has drunk  his Pekoe with it will ever again drink it without a sprig of lemon  verbena.\" And he further states that if this be used one need \"never  suffer from flatulence, never be made nervous or old-maidish, never have  cholera, diarrhea, or loss of appetite.\"           *       *       *       *       *                             =A VELOCIPEDE FEAT EXTRAORDINARY.=    Two intrepid velocipedists, M. le Baron Emanuel de Graffenried de  Burgenstein, aged twenty years and six months, and a member of the  Society of Velocipede Sport, of Paris, has accomplished, with M. A.  Laumaille d'Angers, the greatest distance that has been made with a  velocipede in France.    Leaving Paris on March 16, they returned on the 24th of April, after  having traveled a distance of more than three thousand miles.    [Illustration: =A VELOCIPEDE FEAT EXTRAORDINARY.=]    Their route extended through a part of the west, the middle, and the  south of France, Italy, and southern Switzerland. They traveled through  Orleans, Tours, Poitiers, Angouleme, Bordeaux, Montauban, Toulouse,  Montpellier, Marseilles, Toulon, Nice, Menton, San-Remo, Genoa, Turin,  Milan, the Simplon--where they barely escaped destruction by an  avalanche--Vevay, Berne, Lausanne, Geneva, Dijon, Troy, and Provins. The  longest distance that they accomplished in a single day, was between  Turin and Milan, a distance of 90 miles, which they made in 9-1/2 hours.           *       *       *       *       *                          =Superior Excellence of American Goods.=    The _Post_, of Birmingham, England, remarks with regard to American  competition, that \"perhaps the most humiliating feature of the business  for British manufacturers is the fact that their competitors are  prevailing, not through the cheapness, but through the excellence of  their goods. Time was when English workmanship ranked second to none,  and the names of our great manufacturing firms were a guarantee for the  sterling quality of the goods they turned out; but competitions, trades  unions, piece work, short hours, and other incidents of the 'march of  progress' have altered all that. Complaints, received by hardware  merchants from their customers abroad, are not confined to the goods of  second class firms. Manufacturers who have obtained a world-wide  reputation for their products are frequently convicted of sending out  scamped and unfinished work, and they do not venture to deny the  impeachment, pleading only that the most vigilant must be sometimes at  fault, and that their men, unfortunately, are not to be depended upon.  In other cases it is the merchants or their customers who are to blame  for the inferior quality of the articles by cutting prices so low as to  preclude the possibility of honest work, thinking, probably, that  anything is good enough for a foreign or colonial market. But whatever  the cause, the fact is now undeniable, that a great deal of the  manufactured produce shipped from this country of late years has been of  a very low standard, and that the American manufacturers have  consequently had an easy task in beating it.\"           *       *       *       *       *                              =Petroleum Oils as Lubricators.=    Oils from petroleum are now produced suitable for nearly every  mechanical process for which animal oils have heretofore been used, not  excepting those intended for cylinder purposes. A serious objection  attaching to the animal oils is present in petroleum. If, through the  exhaust steam, some of the oil be carried into the boiler, foaming or  priming is the consequence, but the same thing happening in the case of  petroleum is rather a benefit than otherwise, for it not only does not  cause foaming, but it prevents incrustation or adhesion of the scale or  deposit, and this aids in the preservation of the boiler, and is perhaps  the best preventive of the many everywhere suggested.    Often, in removing the cylinder head and the plate covering the valves  of an engine, we see evidences of corrosion or action on the surfaces,  differing entirely from ordinary wear, and the engineer is generally at  a loss how to account for it. According to the general impression grease  or animal oil is the preservative of the metal, and is the last thing  suspected of being the cause of its general disintegration. The reason  of this is that vegetable and animal oils consist of fatty acids, such  as stearic, magaric, oleic, etc. They are combined with glycerin as a  base, and, under ordinary conditions, are neutrals to metals generally,  and on being applied they keep them from rusting by shielding them from  the action of air and moisture. But in the course of time the influence  of the air causes decomposition and oxidation, the oils become rancid,  as it is called, which is acid, and they act on the metals. What happens  at the ordinary temperature slowly goes on rapidly in the steam  cylinder, where a new condition is reached. The oils are subjected to  the heat of high pressure steam, which dissociates or frees these acids  from their base, and in this condition they attack the metal and hence  destroy it.    This applies as well to vegetable as to oils of animal origin, fish or  sperm oil included. Petroleum and oils derived therefrom (generally  called mineral oils) are entirely free from this objection. Petroleum  contains no oxygen, and hence it cannot form an acid, and therefore  cannot attack metal. It is entirely neutral, and so bland that it may be  and is used medicinally as a dressing to wounds and badly abraded  surfaces where cerates of ordinary dressing would give pain.--_Coal  Trade Journal._           *       *       *       *       *                        =Influence of Light on Plants and Animals.=    Professor Paul Bert, who has recently devoted a great deal of attention  to the study of the influence of light on animals and plants, denies  that the leaves of the sensitive plant close on the approach of evening,  the same as if they had been touched by the hand. On the contrary, he  finds that from 9 in the evening, after drooping, they expand again and  attain the maximum of rigidity at 2 in the morning. What is commonly  called the \"sensitiveness\" of plants is but the external manifestations  of the influences of light. Professor Bert placed plants in lanterns of  different colored glass; those under the influence of green glass  drooped in the course of a few days as completely as if placed in utter  darkness, proving that green rays are useless, and equal to none at all.  In a few weeks all plants without exception thus treated died. It has  been proved by the experiments of Zimiriareff that the reducing power of  the green matter of plants is proportionate to the quantity of red rays  absorbed, and Bert shows that green glass precisely intercepts these  colored rays, and that plants exist more or less healthily in blue and  violet rays. In the animal world phenomena of a directly opposite nature  are found, and of a more complex character. Here the light acts on the  skin and the movements of the body, either directly or through the  visual organs. M. Pouchet has shown the changes in color that certain  animals undergo, according to the medium in which they live. For  instance, young turbots resting on white sand assume an ashy tint, but  when resting on a black bottom become brown; when deprived of its eyes  the fish exhibits no change of color in its skin; the phenomenon,  therefore, seems to be nervous or optical. Professor Bert placed a piece  of paper with a cut design on the back of a sleeping chameleon; on  bringing a lamp near the animal the skin gradually became brown, and on  removing the paper a well defined image of the pattern appeared. In this  case the light acted directly, and without nervous intervention. If,  however, the eye of the chameleon be extracted, the corresponding side  of the animal becomes insensible to the influence of the light.    Professor Bert's conclusion, therefore, is that the circulation in the  transparent layers of the skin must be affected by light. According to  Dr. Bouchard a sunstroke is the effect of the direct action of light  upon the skin, produced by the blue and violet rays. The heat producing  rays have no part in such accidents, as proved by the fact that workmen  exposed to intense heats do not feel their fatal effect. Professor Bert,  in a series of experiments on a variety of animals, found that none  avoided light, but all rather sought it; and the lowest forms, like the  highest, absorbed the same rays. As regards intensity of color, however,  there was a difference, some being more partial to one ray than another.  Thus the microscopic daphne of the pond preferred yellow; violet was  less in request; spiders seemed to enjoy blue rather than red rays--so  resembling people suffering from color blindness. No two persons are  sensible to the same shades or tones, while absorbing the same light;  and this would seem to indicate that the retina possesses a selective  power.           *       *       *       *       *                                =New Mechanical Inventions.=    An improved Weighing Scale has been patented by Hosea Willard, of  Vergennes, Vt.

On the former, crested pigeons were  numerous, several of which were shot. We had likewise procured some of the  rose-coloured and grey parrots, mentioned by Mr. Oxley, and a small  paroquet of beautiful plumage; but there was less of variety in the  feathered race than I expected to find, and most of the other birds we had  seen were recognised by me as similar to specimens I had procured from  Melville Island, and were, therefore, most probably birds of passage.    ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY, AND THE RIVER.    As we neared Mount Harris, the Macquarie became more sluggish in its flow,  and fell off so much as scarcely to deserve the name of a river. In  breadth, it averaged from thirty-five to forty-five yards, and in the  height of its banks, from fifteen to eighteen. Mr. Hume had succeeded in  taking some fish at one of the stock stations; but if I except those  speared by the natives, we had since been altogether unsuccessful with the  hook, a circumstance which I attribute to the lowness of the river itself.    About thirty miles from the cataract the country declines to the north as  a medium point, and again changes somewhat in its general appearance. To  the S. and S.W. it appeared level and wooded, while to the N. the plains  became more frequent, but smaller, and travelling over them was extremely  dangerous, in consequence of the large fissures by which they were  traversed. The only trees to be observed were dwarf-box and the acacia  pendula, both of stunted growth, although flooded-gum still prevailed upon  the river.    On the 20th we travelled on a N.W. course, and in the early part of the  day passed over tolerably good soil. It was succeeded by a barren scrub,  through which we penetrated in the direction of Welcome Rock, a point we  had seen from one of the Plains and had mistaken for Mount Harris.    ARRIVAL AT MOUNT HARRIS.    On a nearer approach, however, we observed our error, and corrected it by  turning more to the left; and we ultimately encamped about a mile to the  W.S.W. of the latter eminence. On issuing from the scrub we found  ourselves among reeds and coarse water-grass; and, from the appearance of  the country, we were led to conclude that we had arrived at a part of the  interior more than ordinarily subject to overflow.    As soon as the camp was fixed, Mr. Hume and I rode to Mount Harris, over  ground subject to flood and covered for the most part by the polygonum,  being too anxious to defer our examination of its neighbourhood even for a  few hours.    VESTIGES OF MR. OXLEY'S ENCAMPMENT.    Nearly ten years had elapsed since Mr. Oxley pitched his tents under the  smallest of the two hills into which Mount Harris is broken. There was no  difficulty in hitting upon his position. The trenches that had been cut  round the tents were still perfect, and the marks of the fire-places  distinguishable; while the trees in the neighbourhood had been felled,  and round about them the staves of some casks and a few tent-pegs were  scattered. Mr. Oxley had selected a place at some distance from the river,  in consequence of its then swollen state. I looked upon it from the same  ground, and could not discern the waters in its channel; so much had they  fallen below their ordinary level. He saw the river when it was  overflowing its banks; on the present occasion it had scarcely sufficient  water to support a current. On the summit of the greater eminence, which  we ascended, there remained the half-burnt planks of a boat, some clenched  and rusty nails, and an old trunk; but my search for the bottle Mr. Oxley  had left was unsuccessful.    A reflection naturally arose to my mind on examining these decaying  vestiges of a former expedition, whether I should be more fortunate than  the leader of it, and how far I should be enabled to penetrate beyond the  point which had conquered his perseverance. Only a week before I left  Sydney I had followed Mr. Oxley to the tomb. A man of uncommon quickness,  and of great ability, the task of following up his discoveries was not  less enviable than arduous; but, arrived at that point at which his  journey may be said to have terminated and mine only to commence, I knew  not how soon I should be obliged, like him, to retreat from the marshes  and exhalations of so depressed a country. My eye instinctively turned to  the North-West, and the view extended over an apparently endless forest.  I could trace the river line of trees by their superior height; but saw no  appearance of reeds, save the few that grew on the banks of the stream.    Mount Foster, somewhat higher than Mount Harris, on the opposite side of  the river, alone broke the line of the horizon to the North N.W. at a  distance of five miles. From that point all round the compass, the low  lands spread, like a dark sea, before me; except where a large plain  stretching from E. to W., and lying to the S.E. broke their monotony;  and if there was nothing discouraging, there certainly was nothing  cheering, in the prospect.    ILLNESS OF TWO OF THE MEN.    On our return to the camp, I was vexed to find two of the men, Henwood and  Williams, with increased inflammation of the eyes, of which they had  previously been complaining, and I thought it advisable to bleed the  latter.    In consequence of the indisposition of these men, we remained stationary  on the 21st, which enabled me to pay a second visit to Mount Harris. On  ascending the smaller hill, I was surprised to find similar vestiges on  its summit to those I had noticed on the larger one; in addition to which,  the rollers still continued on the side of the hill, which had been used  to get the boat up it. [Mr. Oxley had two boats; one of which he dragged  to the top of each of these hills, and left them turned bottom upwards,  buryinq a bottle under the head of the larger boat, which was conveyed to  the more distant hill.]    Mount Harris is of basaltic formation, but I could not observe any  columnar regularity in it, although large blocks are exposed above the  ground. The rock is extremely hard and sonorous.    MOUNT FOSTER AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD.    We moved leisurely towards Mount Foster, on the 22nd, and arrived opposite  to it a little before sunset. The country between the two is mostly open,  or covered only with the acacia pendula and dwarf-box. The soil, although  an alluvial deposit, is not of the best; nor was vegetation either fresh  or close upon it. As soon as the party stopped, I crossed the river, and  lost no time in ascending the hill, being anxious to ascertain if any  fresh object was visible from its summit, I thought that from an eminence  so much above the level of the surrounding objects, I might obtain a view  of the marshes, or of water; but I was wholly disappointed. The view was  certainly extensive, but it was otherwise unsatisfactory. Again to the  N.W. the lowlands spread in darkness before me; there were some  considerable plains beyond the near wood; but the country at the foot of  the hill appeared open and promising. Although the river line was lost in  the distance, it was as truly pointed out by the fires of the natives,  which rose in upright columns into the sky, as if it had been marked by  the trees upon its banks.    To the eastward, Arbuthnot's range rose high above the line of the  horizon, bearing nearly due East, distant seventy miles. The following  sketch of its outlines will convey a better idea of its appearance from  Mount Foster than any written description.    [small sketch here--not shown in etext]    I stayed on the mount until after sunset, but I could not make out any  space that at all resembled the formidable barrier I knew we were so  rapidly approaching. I saw nothing to check our advance, and I therefore  returned to the camp, to advise with Mr. Hume upon the subject. Not having  been with me on Mount Foster, he took the opportunity to ascend it on the  following morning; and on his return concurred with me in opinion, that  there was no apparent obstacle to our moving onwards. As the men were  considerably better, I had the less hesitation in closing with the  marshes. We left our position, intending to travel slowly, and to halt  early.    The first part of our journey was over rich flats, timbered sufficiently  to afford a shade, on which the grass was luxuriant; but we were obliged  to seek more open ground, in consequence of the frequent stumbling of the  cattle.    We issued, at length, upon a plain, the view across which was as dreary as  can be imagined; in many places without a tree, save a few old stumps  left by the natives when they fired the timber, some of which were still  smoking in different parts of it. Observing some lofty trees at the  extremity of the plain, we moved towards them, under an impression that  they indicated the river line. But on this exposed spot the sun's rays  fell with intense power upon us, and the dust was so minute and  penetrating, that I soon regretted having left the shady banks of the  river.    About 2.p.m. we neared the trees for which we had been making, over ground  evidently formed by alluvial deposition, and were astonished to find that  reeds alone were growing under the trees as far as the eye could  penetrate. It appeared that we were still some distance from the river,  and it was very doubtful how far we might be from water, for which the  men were anxiously calling. I therefore halted, and sent Fraser into the  reeds towards some dead trees, on which a number of spoonbills were  sitting. He found that there was a small lake in the centre of the reeds,  the resort of numerous wild"]]]
