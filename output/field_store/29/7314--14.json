And tramping with the Footies ain't as easy as it looks,    They scarcely ever see a Boer except in picture books.    They do a march of twenty mile that leaves 'em nearly dead,    And then they find the bloomin' Boers is twenty miles ahead.    Each Footy is as full of fight as any bulldog pup,    But walking forty miles to fight -- well, I'm fed up!      So after all I think that when I leave the Cavalry    I'll either join the ambulance or else the A.S.C.;    They've always tucker in the plate and coffee in the cup,    But Bully Beef and Biscuits -- well! I'm fair fed up!          Jock!          There's a soldier that's been doing of his share    In the fighting up and down and round about.    He's continually marching here and there    And he's fighting, morning in and morning out.      The Boer, you see, he generally runs;    But sometimes when he hides behind a rock,    And we can't make no impression with the guns,    Oh, then you'll hear the order, 'Send for Jock!'      Yes, it's Jock -- Scotch Jock.    He's the fellow that can give or take a knock.    For he's hairy and he's hard,    And his feet are by the yard,    And his face is like the face what's on a clock.    But when the bullets fly you will mostly hear the cry --    'Send for Jock!'      The Cavalry have gun and sword and lance,    Before they choose their weapon, why, they're dead.    The Mounted Fut are hampered in advance    By holding of their helmets on their head.      And when the Boer has dug himself a trench    And placed his Maxim gun behind a rock,    These mounted heroes -- pets of Johnny French --    They have to sit and wait and send for Jock!      Yes, the Jocks -- Scotch Jocks,    With their music that'd terrify an ox!    When the bullets kick the sand    You can hear the sharp command --    'Forty-Second!  At the double!  Charge the rocks!'    And the charge is like a flood    When they've warmed the Highland blood    Of the Jocks!          Santa Claus          Halt!  Who goes there?  The sentry's call    Rose on the midnight air    Above the noises of the camp,    The roll of wheels, the horses' tramp.    The challenge echoed over all --    Halt!  Who goes there?      A quaint old figure clothed in white,    He bore a staff of pine,    An ivy-wreath was on his head.    'Advance, oh friend,' the sentry said,    Advance, for this is Christmas night,    And give the countersign.'      'No sign nor countersign have I,    Through many lands I roam    The whole world over far and wide,    To exiles all at Christmastide,    From those who love them tenderly    I bring a thought of home.      'From English brook and Scottish burn,    From cold Canadian snows,    From those far lands ye hold most dear    I bring you all a greeting here,    A frond of a New Zealand fern,    A bloom of English rose.      'From faithful wife and loving lass    I bring a wish divine,    For Christmas blessings on your head.'    'I wish you well,' the sentry said,    But here, alas! you may not pass    Without the countersign.'      He vanished -- and the sentry's tramp    Re-echoed down the line.    It was not till the morning light    The soldiers knew that in the night    Old Santa Claus had come to camp    Without the countersign.          From a section of Advertisements, 1909.          THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER,  AND OTHER VERSES.         By A. B. Paterson.    *  \"The immediate success of this book of bush ballads is without parallel  in Colonial literary annals, nor can any living English or American poet  boast so wide a public, always excepting Mr. Rudyard Kipling.\"    *  \"These lines have the true lyrical cry in them.  Eloquent and ardent verses.\"    *  \"Swinging, rattling ballads of ready humour, ready pathos,  and crowding adventure.  . . .  Stirring and entertaining ballads  about great rides, in which the lines gallop like the very hoofs  of the horses.\"    *  \"At his best he compares not unfavourably with the author  of 'Barrack-Room Ballads'.\"    *  Mr. A. Patchett Martin (London):  \"In my opinion,  it is the absolutely un-English, thoroughly Australian style and character  of these new bush bards which has given them such immediate popularity,  such wide vogue, among all classes of the rising native generation.\"    *  \"Australia has produced in Mr. A. B. Paterson a national poet  whose bush ballads are as distinctively characteristic of the country  as Burns's poetry is characteristic of Scotland.\"    *  \"A book like this . . . is worth a dozen of the aspiring,  idealistic sort, since it has a deal of rough laughter  and a dash of real tears in its composition.\"    *  \"These ballads . . . are full of such go that the mere reading of them  make the blood tingle. . . .  But there are other things  in Mr. Paterson's book besides mere racing and chasing,  and each piece bears the mark of special local knowledge, feeling, and colour.  The poet has also a note of pathos, which is always wholesome.\"    *  \"He gallops along with a by no means doubtful music,  shouting his vigorous songs as he rides in pursuit of wild bush horses,  constraining us to listen and applaud by dint of his manly tones  and capital subjects . . .  We turn to Mr. Paterson's roaring muse  with instantaneous gratitude.\"          RIO GRANDE'S LAST RACE, AND OTHER VERSES.         By A. B. Paterson.    *  \"There is no mistaking the vigour of Mr. Paterson's verse;  there is no difficulty in feeling the strong human interest  which moves in it.\"    *  \"Every way worthy of the man who ranks with the first of Australian poets.\"    *  \"At once naturalistic and imaginative, and racy without being slangy,  the poems have always a strong human interest of every-day life  to keep them going.  They make a book which should give an equal pleasure  to simple and to fastidious readers.\"    *  \"Now and again a deeper theme, like an echo from the older,  more experienced land, leads him to more serious singing, and proves that  real poetry is, after all, universal.  It is a hearty book.\"    *  \"Mr. Paterson has powerful and varied sympathies,  coupled with a genuine lyrical impulse, and some skill,  which makes his attempts always attractive and usually successful.\"    *  \"These are all entertaining, their rough and ready wit  and virility of expression making them highly acceptable,  while the dash of satire gives point to the humour.\"    *  \"He catches the bush in its most joyous moments, and writes of it  with the simple charm of an unaffected lover.\"    *  \"Will be welcome to that too select class at home who follow  the Australian endeavour to utter a fresh and genuine poetic voice.\"    *  \"Mr. Paterson now proves beyond question that Australia has produced  at least one singer who can voice in truest poetry the aspirations  and experiences peculiar to the Commonwealth, and who is to be ranked  with the foremost living poets of the motherland.\"    *  \"Fine, swinging, stirring stuff, that sings as it goes along.  The subjects are capital, and some of the refrains haunt one.  There is always room for a book of unpretentious, vigorous verse  of this sort.\"    *  \"These ballads make bright and easy reading; one takes up the book,  and, delighted at the rhythm, turns page after page,  finding entertainment upon each.\"          Biographical Note:    Andrew Barton Paterson was born at Narambla, in New South Wales, on 17  February 1864, but grew up at Buckenbah and Illalong. He became a lawyer  but devoted much of his time to writing, and gained popularity  especially for his poetry and ballads. His best known poems are The Man  from Snowy River (1892) on which a motion picture was loosely based, and  Waltzing Matilda (1895) which slowly became an Australian symbol and  national song. The poems he wrote for a Sydney newspaper led him into  reporting, and he went to South Africa to cover the Boer War.  Always a  fair man, he had his doubts about the war and was a little too vocal  about it for the tastes of some of his readers.  During the First World  War he served in Egypt as a Major in a Remount Unit, training horses for  the war.  This fit one of his main interests in life -- horses --a  preoccupation which is very evident in his poems, and even in his choice  of pseudonym --\"The Banjo\" was a race-horse.    The works for which Paterson is famous were mostly written before the  First World War, and are collected in three books of poems, The Man from  Snowy River and Other Verses (1895), Rio Grande's Last Race and Other  Verses (1902), and Saltbush Bill, J.P. and Other Verses (1917). His  prose works include An Outback Marriage (1906), and Three Elephant Power  and Other Stories (1917), the latter of which is a collection of tall  tales and serious (but often humourous) reporting.  In fact, above all  else it is perhaps Paterson's sense of humour that sets him apart from  such balladists as Rudyard Kipling and Robert Service. It should also be  noted that Paterson was writing his ballads before either of these  became well-known, and there was little, if any, influence from either  side.  More likely, Paterson was influenced by the Scottish tradition of  poetry (Paterson was of Scottish descent) which had been popularized in  Australia by Adam Lindsay Gordon and others. Banjo Paterson died of a  heart attack on 5 February, 1941.    A.

Their increasing numbers and rugged independence were forming them  also into an organized political party with decided tendencies, as it  afterwards appeared, towards forming a separate state.    The extreme narrowness of the Scotch-Irish, however, misled them. The  only real safety for the province lay in regularly constituted and  strong expeditions, like that of Bouquet, which would drive the main  body of the savages far westward. But the Scotch-Irish could not see  this; and with that intensity of passion which marked all their  actions they turned their energy and vengeance upon the Quakers and  semicivilized Indians in the eastern end of the colony. Their preachers,  who were their principal leaders and organizers, encouraged them in  denouncing Quaker doctrine as a wicked heresy from which only evil  could result. The Quakers had offended God from the beginning by making  treaties of kindness with the heathen savages instead of exterminating  them as the Scripture commanded: \"And when the Lord thy God shall  deliver them before thee, thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy  them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them.\"  The Scripture had not been obeyed; the heathen had not been destroyed;  on the contrary, a systematic policy of covenants, treaties,  and kindness had been persisted in for two generations, and as a  consequence, the Ulstermen said, the frontiers were now deluged in  blood. They were particularly resentful against the small settlement of  Indians near Bethlehem, who had been converted to Christianity by the  Moravians, and another little village of half civilized basketmaking  Indians at Conestoga near Lancaster. The Scotch-Irish had worked  themselves up into a strange belief that these small remnants were  sending information, arms, and ammunition to the western tribes; and  they seemed to think that it was more important to exterminate these  little communities than to go with such expeditions as Bouquet's to  the West. They asked the Governor to remove these civilized Indians and  assured him that their removal would secure the safety of the frontier.  When the Governor, not being able to find anything against the Indians,  declined to remove them, the Scotch-Irish determined to attend to the  matter in their own fashion.    Bouquet's victory at Bushy Run, much to the surprise of the  Scotch-Irish, stopped Indian raids of any seriousness until the  following spring. But in the autumn there were a few depredations, which  led the frontiersmen to believe that the whole invasion would begin  again. A party of them, therefore, started to attack the Moravian  Indians near Bethlehem; but before they could accomplish their object,  the Governor brought most of the Indians down to Philadelphia for  protection. Even there they were narrowly saved from the mob, for the  hostility against them was spreading throughout the province.    Soon afterwards another party of Scotch-Irish, ever since known as the  \"Paxton Boys,\" went at break of day to the village of the Conestoga  Indians and found only six of them at home--three men, two women, and a  boy. These they instantly shot down, mutilated their bodies, and burned  their cabins. As the murderers returned, they related to a man on the  road what they had done, and when he protested against the cruelty of  the deed, they asked, \"Don't you believe in God and the Bible?\" The  remaining fourteen inhabitants of the village, who were away selling  brooms, were collected by the sheriff and put in the jail at Lancaster  for protection. The Paxtons heard of it and in a few days stormed the  jail, broke down the doors, and either shot the poor Indians or cut them  to pieces with hatchets.    This was probably the first instance of lynch law in America. It raised  a storm of indignation and controversy; and a pamphlet war persisted  for several years. The whole province was immediately divided into  two parties. On one side were the Quakers, most of the Germans, and  conservatives of every sort, and on the other, inclined to sympathize  with the Scotch-Irish, were the eastern Presbyterians, some of the  Churchmen, and various miscellaneous people whose vindictiveness towards  all Indians had been aroused by the war. The Quakers and conservatives,  who seem to have been the more numerous, assailed the Scotch-Irish in no  measured language as a gang of ruffians without respect for law or order  who, though always crying for protection, had refused to march with  Bouquet to save Fort Pitt or to furnish him the slightest assistance.  Instead of going westward where the danger was and something might  be accomplished, they had turned eastward among the settlements and  murdered a few poor defenseless people, mostly women and children.    Franklin, who had now returned from England, wrote one of his best  pamphlets against the Paxtons, the valorous, heroic Paxtons, as he  called them, prating of God and the Bible, fifty-seven of whom, armed  with rifles, knives, and hatchets, had actually succeeded in killing  three old men, two women, and a boy. This pamphlet became known as the  \"Narrative\" from the first word of its title, and it had an immense  circulation. Like everything Franklin wrote, it is interesting reading  to this day.    One of the first effects of this controversy was to drive the excitable  Scotch-Irish into a flame of insurrection not unlike the Whisky  Rebellion, which started among them some years after the Revolution.  They held tumultuous meetings denouncing the Quakers and the whole  proprietary government in Philadelphia, and they organized an expedition  which included some delegates to suggest reforms. For the most part,  however, it was a well equipped little army variously estimated at from  five hundred to fifteen hundred on foot and on horseback, which marched  towards Philadelphia with no uncertain purpose. They openly declared  that they intended to capture the town, seize the Moravian Indians  protected there, and put them to death. They fully expected to be  supported by most of the people and to have everything their own way.  As they passed along the roads, they amused themselves in their rough  fashion by shooting chickens and pigs, frightening people by thrusting  their rifles into windows, and occasionally throwing some one down and  pretending to scalp him.    In the city there was great excitement and alarm. Even the classes who  sympathized with the Scotch-Irish did not altogether relish having their  property burned or destroyed. Great preparations were made to meet the  expedition. British regulars were summoned. Eight companies of militia  and a battery of artillery were hastily formed. Franklin became a  military man once more and superintended the preparations. On all sides  the Quakers were enlisting; they had become accustomed to war; and this  legitimate chance to shoot a Scotch-Irish Presbyterian was too much for  the strongest scruples of their religion. It was a long time, however,  before they heard the end of this zeal; and in the pamphlet war which  followed they were accused of clamorously rushing to arms and demanding  to be led against the enemy.    It is amusing now to read about it in the old records. But it was  serious enough at the time. When the Scotch-Irish army reached the  Schuylkill River and found the fords leading to the city guarded, they  were not quite so enthusiastic about killing Quakers and Indians. They  went up the river some fifteen miles, crossed by an unopposed ford, and  halted in Germantown ten miles north of Philadelphia. That was as far as  they thought it safe to venture. Several days passed, during which the  city people continued their preparations and expected every night to be  attacked. There were, indeed, several false alarms. Whenever the alarm  was sounded at night, every one placed candles in his windows to light  up the streets. One night when it rained the soldiers were allowed  to shelter themselves in a Quaker meeting house, which for some hours  bristled with bayonets and swords, an incident of which the Presbyterian  pamphleteers afterwards made much use for satire. On another day all the  cannon were fired to let the enemy know what was in store for him.    Finally commissioners with the clever, genial Franklin at their head,  went out to Germantown to negotiate, and soon had the whole mighty  difference composed. The Scotch-Irish stated their grievances. The  Moravian Indians ought not to be protected by the government, and all  such Indians should be removed from the colony; the men who killed  the Conestoga Indians should be tried where the supposed offense was  committed and not in Philadelphia; the five frontier counties had  only ten representatives in the Assembly while the three others had  twenty-six--this should be remedied; men wounded in border war should be  cared for at public expense; no trade should be carried on with hostile  Indians until they restored prisoners; and there should be a bounty on  scalps.    While these negotiations were proceeding, some of the Scotch-Irish  amused themselves by practicing with their rifles at the weather vane,  a figure of a cock, on the steeple of the old Lutheran church in  Germantown--an unimportant incident, it is true, but one revealing the  conditions and character of the time as much as graver matters do. The  old weather vane with the bullet marks upon it is still preserved. About  thirty of these same riflemen were invited to Philadelphia and were  allowed to wander about and see the sights of the town. The rest  returned to the frontier. As for their list of grievances, not one of  them was granted except, strange and sad to relate, the one which asked  for a scalp bounty. The Governor, after the manner of other colonies,  it must be admitted, issued the long desired scalp proclamation, which  after"]]]
