She bare also the fruitless  deep with his raging swell, Pontus, without sweet union of love. But  afterwards she lay with Heaven and bare deep-swirling Oceanus, Coeus and  Crius and Hyperion and Iapetus, Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne and  gold-crowned Phoebe and lovely Tethys. After them was born Cronos the  wily, youngest and most terrible of her children, and he hated his lusty  sire.    (ll. 139-146) And again, she bare the Cyclopes, overbearing in spirit,  Brontes, and Steropes and stubborn-hearted Arges [1606], who gave Zeus  the thunder and made the thunderbolt: in all else they were like the  gods, but one eye only was set in the midst of their fore-heads. And  they were surnamed Cyclopes (Orb-eyed) because one orbed eye was set in  their foreheads. Strength and might and craft were in their works.    (ll. 147-163) And again, three other sons were born of Earth and  Heaven, great and doughty beyond telling, Cottus and Briareos and Gyes,  presumptuous children. From their shoulders sprang an hundred arms, not  to be approached, and each had fifty heads upon his shoulders on their  strong limbs, and irresistible was the stubborn strength that was in  their great forms. For of all the children that were born of Earth and  Heaven, these were the most terrible, and they were hated by their own  father from the first.    And he used to hide them all away in a secret place of Earth so soon as  each was born, and would not suffer them to come up into the light: and  Heaven rejoiced in his evil doing. But vast Earth groaned within, being  straitened, and she made the element of grey flint and shaped a great  sickle, and told her plan to her dear sons. And she spoke, cheering  them, while she was vexed in her dear heart:    (ll. 164-166) 'My children, gotten of a sinful father, if you will  obey me, we should punish the vile outrage of your father; for he first  thought of doing shameful things.'    (ll. 167-169) So she said; but fear seized them all, and none of them  uttered a word. But great Cronos the wily took courage and answered his  dear mother:    (ll. 170-172) 'Mother, I will undertake to do this deed, for I reverence  not our father of evil name, for he first thought of doing shameful  things.'    (ll. 173-175) So he said: and vast Earth rejoiced greatly in spirit, and  set and hid him in an ambush, and put in his hands a jagged sickle, and  revealed to him the whole plot.    (ll. 176-206) And Heaven came, bringing on night and longing for love,  and he lay about Earth spreading himself full upon her [1607].    Then the son from his ambush stretched forth his left hand and in his  right took the great long sickle with jagged teeth, and swiftly lopped  off his own father's members and cast them away to fall behind him. And  not vainly did they fall from his hand; for all the bloody drops that  gushed forth Earth received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the  strong Erinyes and the great Giants with gleaming armour, holding long  spears in their hands and the Nymphs whom they call Meliae [1608] all  over the boundless earth. And so soon as he had cut off the members with  flint and cast them from the land into the surging sea, they were swept  away over the main a long time: and a white foam spread around them from  the immortal flesh, and in it there grew a maiden. First she drew near  holy Cythera, and from there, afterwards, she came to sea-girt Cyprus,  and came forth an awful and lovely goddess, and grass grew up about  her beneath her shapely feet. Her gods and men call Aphrodite, and the  foam-born goddess and rich-crowned Cytherea, because she grew amid the  foam, and Cytherea because she reached Cythera, and Cyprogenes because  she was born in billowy Cyprus, and Philommedes [1609] because sprang  from the members. And with her went Eros, and comely Desire followed her  at her birth at the first and as she went into the assembly of the gods.  This honour she has from the beginning, and this is the portion allotted  to her amongst men and undying gods,--the whisperings of maidens and  smiles and deceits with sweet delight and love and graciousness.    (ll. 207-210) But these sons whom he begot himself great Heaven used to  call Titans (Strainers) in reproach, for he said that they strained and  did presumptuously a fearful deed, and that vengeance for it would come  afterwards.    (ll. 211-225) And Night bare hateful Doom and black Fate and Death,  and she bare Sleep and the tribe of Dreams. And again the goddess murky  Night, though she lay with none, bare Blame and painful Woe, and the  Hesperides who guard the rich, golden apples and the trees bearing fruit  beyond glorious Ocean. Also she bare the Destinies and ruthless avenging  Fates, Clotho and Lachesis and Atropos [1610], who give men at their  birth both evil and good to have, and they pursue the transgressions of  men and of gods: and these goddesses never cease from their dread anger  until they punish the sinner with a sore penalty. Also deadly Night bare  Nemesis (Indignation) to afflict mortal men, and after her, Deceit and  Friendship and hateful Age and hard-hearted Strife.    (ll. 226-232) But abhorred Strife bare painful Toil and Forgetfulness  and Famine and tearful Sorrows, Fightings also, Battles, Murders,  Manslaughters, Quarrels, Lying Words, Disputes, Lawlessness and Ruin,  all of one nature, and Oath who most troubles men upon earth when anyone  wilfully swears a false oath.    (ll. 233-239) And Sea begat Nereus, the eldest of his children, who is  true and lies not: and men call him the Old Man because he is trusty and  gentle and does not forget the laws of righteousness, but thinks just  and kindly thoughts. And yet again he got great Thaumas and proud  Phorcys, being mated with Earth, and fair-cheeked Ceto and Eurybia who  has a heart of flint within her.    (ll. 240-264) And of Nereus and rich-haired Doris, daughter of Ocean  the perfect river, were born children [1611], passing lovely amongst  goddesses, Ploto, Eucrante, Sao, and Amphitrite, and Eudora, and Thetis,  Galene and Glauce, Cymothoe, Speo, Thoe and lovely Halie, and Pasithea,  and Erato, and rosy-armed Eunice, and gracious Melite, and Eulimene, and  Agaue, Doto, Proto, Pherusa, and Dynamene, and Nisaea, and Actaea, and  Protomedea, Doris, Panopea, and comely Galatea, and lovely Hippothoe,  and rosy-armed Hipponoe, and Cymodoce who with Cymatolege [1612] and  Amphitrite easily calms the waves upon the misty sea and the blasts  of raging winds, and Cymo, and Eione, and rich-crowned Alimede, and  Glauconome, fond of laughter, and Pontoporea, Leagore, Euagore, and  Laomedea, and Polynoe, and Autonoe, and Lysianassa, and Euarne, lovely  of shape and without blemish of form, and Psamathe of charming figure  and divine Menippe, Neso, Eupompe, Themisto, Pronoe, and Nemertes [1613]  who has the nature of her deathless father. These fifty daughters sprang  from blameless Nereus, skilled in excellent crafts.    (ll. 265-269) And Thaumas wedded Electra the daughter of deep-flowing  Ocean, and she bare him swift Iris and the long-haired Harpies, Aello  (Storm-swift) and Ocypetes (Swift-flier) who on their swift wings keep  pace with the blasts of the winds and the birds; for quick as time they  dart along.    (ll 270-294) And again, Ceto bare to Phorcys the fair-cheeked Graiae,  sisters grey from their birth: and both deathless gods and men who walk  on earth call them Graiae, Pemphredo well-clad, and saffron-robed Enyo,  and the Gorgons who dwell beyond glorious Ocean in the frontier land  towards Night where are the clear-voiced Hesperides, Sthenno, and  Euryale, and Medusa who suffered a woeful fate: she was mortal, but  the two were undying and grew not old. With her lay the Dark-haired One  [1614] in a soft meadow amid spring flowers. And when Perseus cut off  her head, there sprang forth great Chrysaor and the horse Pegasus who  is so called because he was born near the springs (pegae) of Ocean;  and that other, because he held a golden blade (aor) in his hands. Now  Pegasus flew away and left the earth, the mother of flocks, and came  to the deathless gods: and he dwells in the house of Zeus and brings to  wise Zeus the thunder and lightning. But Chrysaor was joined in love  to Callirrhoe, the daughter of glorious Ocean, and begot three-headed  Geryones. Him mighty Heracles slew in sea-girt Erythea by his shambling  oxen on that day when he drove the wide-browed oxen to holy Tiryns,  and had crossed the ford of Ocean and killed Orthus and Eurytion the  herdsman in the dim stead out beyond glorious Ocean.    (ll. 295-305) And in a hollow cave she bare another monster,  irresistible, in no wise like either to mortal men or to the undying  gods, even the goddess fierce Echidna who is half a nymph with glancing  eyes and fair cheeks, and half again a huge snake, great and awful, with  speckled skin, eating raw flesh beneath the secret parts of the holy  earth. And there she has a cave deep down under a hollow rock far from  the deathless gods and mortal men. There, then, did the gods appoint her  a glorious house to dwell in: and she keeps guard in Arima beneath the  earth, grim Echidna, a nymph who dies not nor grows old all her days.    (ll. 306-332) Men say that Typhaon the terrible, outrageous and lawless,  was joined in love to her, the maid with glancing eyes. So she conceived  and brought forth fierce offspring; first she bare Orthus the hound of  Geryones, and then again she bare a second, a monster not to be  overcome and that may not be described, Cerberus who eats raw flesh, the  brazen-voiced hound of Hades, fifty-headed, relentless and strong.  And again she bore a third, the evil-minded Hydra of Lerna, whom the  goddess, white-armed Hera nourished, being angry beyond measure with  the mighty Heracles. And her Heracles, the son of Zeus,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34804"],[0,"Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religion as Illustrated (#14)"],[1,"gave him  some Tepitoton, or little household gods, to take with him, and as a  rule they killed a dog to serve as his guide in the mysterious and  painful journey which he was about to undertake. Sometimes a very rich  man would go so far as to have his chaplain slaughtered, that he might  not be deprived of his support in the other world. But in all this there  is nothing to distinguish the Mexican religion from the beliefs that  stretched over the whole of America, and there is no indication that any  moral conception had as yet vivified and hallowed the prospect beyond  the grave. The mass of ordinary mortals remained in the sombre, dreary,  monotonous realm of Mictlan; for in Mexico, as in Polynesia, a really  happy immortality was a privilege reserved for the aristocracy. There  were several paradises, including that of Tlaloc, and above all the  \"mansion of the Sun,\" destined to receive the kings, the nobles and the  warriors. There they hunt, they dance, they accompany the sun in his  course, they can change themselves into clouds or humming-birds. An  exception is made, however, irrespective of social rank, in favour of  warriors who fall in battle and women who die in child-bed, as well as  for the victims sacrificed in honour of the celestial deities and  destined to become their servants. So, too, the paradise of Tlaloc, a  most beauteous garden, is opened to all who have been drowned (for the  god of the waters has taken them to himself), to all who have died of  the diseases caused by moisture, and to the children who have been  sacrificed to him. We recognize in these exceptions an unquestionable  tendency to introduce the idea of justice as qualifying the desolating  doctrine of aristocratic privilege; and probably this principle of  justice would have become preponderant, here as elsewhere, had not the  destinies of the Mexican religion been suddenly broken off. Nor is it  easy to explain the asceticism and austerities of which we have spoken,  except on the supposition that those who practised them all their lives  believed they were thereby acquiring higher rights in the future life.  It must be admitted, however, that it is not in its doctrine of a future  life that the Mexican religion reached its higher developments.    We must postpone till we have examined the Peruvian religion, which  presents so many analogies to that of Mexico, while at the same time  differing from it so considerably, the final considerations suggested by  the strange compound of beliefs, now so barbarous and now so refined,  which we have passed in review. Spanish monks, as we all know, succeeded  within a few years in bringing the populations who had submitted to the  hardy conquerors within the pale of their Church. It was no very  difficult task. The whole past had vanished. The royal families, the  nobility, the clergy, all had perished. Faith in the national gods had  been broken by events. The new occupants laid a grievous yoke upon the  subject peoples, whom they crushed and oppressed with hateful tyranny;  but we must do the Franciscan monks, who were first on the field in the  work of conversion, the justice of testifying that they did whatever in  them lay to soften the fate of their converts and to plead their cause  before the Court of Spain. Nor were their efforts always unsuccessful.  They were rewarded by the unstinted confidence and affection of the  unhappy natives, who found little pity or comfort save at the hands of  the good Fathers. Let us add that many of the peoples, especially those  from whom the human tithes of which we have spoken had been exacted by  the Aztecs, were sensible of the humane and charitable aspects of a  religion that repudiated these hideous sacrifices in horror, and raised  up the hearts of the oppressed by its promises of a future bliss  conditioned by neither birth nor social rank.[37]    But the worthy monks could not give what they had not got. And the  religious education which they gave their converts reflected only too  faithfully their own narrow and punctilious monastic spirit, itself  almost as superstitious, though in another way, as what it supplanted.  Nay, more: in spite of the best dispositions on either side, it was  inevitable that the ancient habits and beliefs should long maintain  themselves, though more or less shrouded beneath the new orthodoxy. In  1571, the terrible Inquisition of Spain came and established itself in  Mexico to put an end to this state of things; and alas! it found as  many heretics as it could wish to show that it had not come for nothing.  And when the natives saw the fearful tribunal at work, when the fires of  the _autos-da-fe_ were kindled on the plain of Mexico and consumed by  tens or hundreds the victims condemned by the Holy Office, do you  suppose that the new converts felt well assured in their own hearts that  the God of the Gospel was, after all, much better than Uitzilopochtli  and Tezcatlipoca?[38]    But we are stepping beyond the domain of history we have marked out for  ourselves. The religion of Mexico is dead, and we cannot desire a  resurrection for it. But the memory it has left behind is at once  mournful and instructive. It has enriched history with its confirmatory  evidence as to the genesis, the power and the tragic force of religion  in human nature; and he who inspects its annals, now so poetical and now  so terror-laden, pauses in pensive thought before the grotesque but  imposing monument which thrills him with admiration even while he  recoils with horror.          LECTURE IV.    PERU.--ITS CIVILIZATION AND CONSTITUTION, THE LEGEND OF THE INCAS: THEIR  POLICY AND HISTORY.      LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,    We pass to-day from North to South America; and as in the former we  confined ourselves to the district which presented the Europeans of the  sixteenth century with the unlooked-for spectacle of a native  civilization and religion in an advanced stage of development, so in the  latter we shall specially study that other indigenous civilization,  likewise supported and patronized by a very curious and original  religion, which established itself along the Cordilleras on the  immensely long but comparatively narrow strip of land between those  mountains and the ocean. Peru, like Mexico, was the country of an  organized solar religion; but the former, even more than the latter,  displays this religion worked into the very tissues of a most remarkable  social structure, with which it is so completely identified as not to be  so much as conceivable without it. The empire of the Incas is one of the  most complete and absolute theocracies--perhaps the very most complete  and absolute--that the world has seen. But in order to get a clear idea  of what the Peruvian religion was, we must first say a word as to the  country itself, its physical constitution and its history.    The Peru of the Incas, as discovered and conquered by the Spaniards,  transcended the boundaries of the country now so called, inasmuch as it  included the more ancient kingdom of Quito (corresponding pretty closely  to the modern republic of Ecuador), and extended over parts of the  present Chili and Bolivia. We learn from our ordinary maps that this  whole territory was narrowly confined between the mountains and the sea.  Observe, however, that it was nearly two thousand five hundred miles in  length, four times as long as France, and that its breadth varied from  about two hundred and fifty to about five hundred miles. From West to  East it presents three very different regions. 1. A strip along the  coast where rain hardly ever falls, but where the night dews are very  heavy and the produce of the soil tropical. 2. The _Sierra_ formed by  the first spurs of the Cordilleras, and already high enough above the  level of the sea to produce the vegetation of the temperate regions.  Here maize was cultivated on a large scale, and great herds of vicunias,  alpacas and llamas were pastured. And here we may note a great point of  advantage enjoyed by Peru over Mexico; for the llama, though not very  strong, serves as a beast of burden and traction, its flesh is well  flavoured and its wool most useful. 3. The _Montana_, consisting of a  region even yet imperfectly known, over which extend unmeasured forests,  the home of the jaguar and the chinchilla, of bright-plumed birds and of  dreaded serpents. Above these forests stretch the dizzy peaks and the  volcanos. The most remarkable natural phenomenon of the country is the  lake Titicaca, about seven times as great as the lake of Geneva, not  far distant from the ancient capital Cuzco, and serving, like Anahuac,  the lake district of Mexico, as the chief focus of Peruvian civilization  and religion. The mysterious disappearance beneath the ground of the  river by which it empties itself, stimulated yet further the  myth-forming imagination of the dwellers on its shores.    There is a remarkable difference between the ways in which the two  civilizations of which we are speaking formed and consolidated  themselves in Mexico and Peru respectively. We have seen that in Mexico  the state of things to which the Spanish conquest put an end was the  result of a long series of revolutions and wars, in which successive  peoples had ruled and served in turn; and the Aztecs had finally seized  the hegemony, while adopting a civilization the origins of which must be  sought in Central America. In Peru things had followed a more regular  and stable course. The dynasty of the Incas had maintained itself for  about six centuries as the patron of social progress and of a remarkably  advanced culture. Starting from its native soil on the shores of Lake  Titicaca, and long confined in its authority to Cuzco and its immediate  territory, this family had finally succeeded in indefinitely extending  its dominion between the mountains and the sea, sometimes by successful  wars and sometimes by pacific means; for "]]]
