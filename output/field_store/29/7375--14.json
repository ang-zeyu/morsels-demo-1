The Pope himself was deeply affected at his death,  and requested Bembo to compose the epitaph which is now read on his  tomb; and his loss was considered as a national calamity throughout all  Italy. True indeed it is, that soon after his decease, Rome herself, and  her territory, experienced such unheard of calamities, that many had  just cause to envy him, not only the celebrity of his life, but the  opportune period of his death. He was not doomed to see the illustrious  Leo X., at a time when he extended the most exalted patronage to the  arts, poisoned by a sacrilegious hand; nor Clement VII., pressed by an  enraged enemy, seeking shelter in the Castle of S. Angelo, afterwards  compelled to fly for his life, and obliged to purchase, at enormous  sums, the liberty of his servants. Nor did he witness the horrors  attending the sacking of Rome, the nobility robbed and plundered in  their own palaces, the violation of hapless females in the convents;  prelates unrelentingly dragged to the scaffold, and priests torn from  the altars, and from the images of their saints, to whom they looked in  vain for refuge, slaughtered by the sword, and their bodies thrown out  of the churches a prey to the dogs. Nor did he survive to see that city,  which he had so illustrated by his genius, and where he had for so many  years shared the public admiration and esteem, wasted with fire and  sword. But of this we shall speak in another place, and shall here  adduce some observations on his style, selected from various authors,  and more particularly from Mengs, who has ably criticised it in his  works already enumerated by me, as well as in some others.    Raffaello is by common consent placed at the head of his art; not  because he excelled all others in every department of painting, but  because no other artist has ever possessed the various parts of the art  united in so high a degree. Lazzarini even asserts, that he was guilty  of errors, and that he is only the first, because he did not commit so  many as others. He ought, however, to have allowed, that his defects  would be excellences in any other artist, being nothing more in him than  the neglect of that higher degree of perfection to which he was capable  of attaining. The art, indeed, comprehends so many and such difficult  parts, that no individual artist has been alike distinguished in all;  even Apelles was said to yield to Amphion in disposition and harmony, to  Asclepiadorus in proportion, and to Protogenes in application.    The style of design of Raffaello, as seen in those drawings, divested of  colours, which now form the chief ornaments of cabinets, presents us, if  we may use the term, with the pure transcript of his imagination, and we  stand in amaze at the contours, grace, precision, diligence, and genius,  which they exhibit. One of the most admired of his drawings I once saw  in the gallery of the Duke of Modena, a most finished and superior  specimen, uniting in style all the invention of the best painters of  Greece, and the execution of the first artists of Italy. It has been  made a question whether Raffaello did not yield to Michelangiolo in  drawing; and Mengs himself confesses, that he did, as far as regards the  anatomy of the muscles, and in strong expression, in which he considers  Raffaello to have imitated Michelangiolo. But we need not say with  Vasari, that in order to prove that he understood the naked figure as  well as Michelangiolo, he appropriated to himself the designs of that  great master. On the contrary, in the figures of the two youths in the  Incendio di Borgo, criticised by Vasari, one of whom is in the act of  leaping from a wall to escape the flames, and the other is fleeing with  his father on his shoulders, he not only proved that he had a perfect  knowledge of the action of the muscles and the anatomy requisite for a  painter, but prescribed the occasion when this style might be used  without impropriety, as in figures of a robust form engaged in violent  action. He moreover commonly marked the principal parts in the naked  figure, and indicated the others after the example of the better ancient  masters, and where he wrought from his own ideas, his execution was most  correct. On this subject Bellori may be consulted at page 223 of the  work already quoted, and the annotations to vol. ii. of Mengs, (page  197,) made by the Cavaliere d'Azzara, minister of the king of Spain at  Rome, an individual, who, in conferring honour on the artist, has by his  own writing conferred honour on art itself.    In chasteness of design, Raffaello was by some placed on a level with  the Greeks, though this praise we must consider as extravagant. Agostino  Caracci commends him as a model of symmetry; and in that respect, more  than in any other, he approached the ancients; except, observes Mengs,  in the hands, which being rarely found perfect in the ancient statues,  he had not an equal opportunity of studying, and did not therefore  design them so elegantly as the other parts. He selected the beautiful  from nature, and as Mariette observes, whose collection was rich in his  designs, he copied it with all its imperfections, which he afterwards  gradually corrected, as he proceeded with his work. Above all things, he  aimed at perfecting the heads, and from a letter addressed to  Castiglione on the Galatea of the Palazzo Chigi, or of the Farnesina, he  discovers how intent he was to select the best models of nature, and to  perfect them in his own mind.[48] His own Fornarina assisted him in this  object. Her portrait, by Raffaello's own hand, was formerly in the  Barberini palace, and it is repeated in many of his Madonnas, in the  picture of S. Cecilia, in Bologna, and in many female heads. Critics  have often expressed a wish that these heads had possessed a more  dignified character, and in this respect he was, perhaps, excelled by  Guido Reni, and however engaging his children may be, those of Titian  are still more beautiful. His true empire was in the heads of his men,  which are portraits selected with judgment, and depicted with a dignity  proportioned to his subject. Vasari calls the air of these heads  superhuman, and calls on us to admire the expression of age in the  patriarchs, simplicity of life in the apostles, and constancy of faith  in the martyrs; and in Christ in the Transfiguration, he says, there is  a portion of the divine essence itself transferred to his countenance,  and made visible to mortal eyes.    This effect is the result of that quality that is called expression, and  which, in the drawing of Raffaello has attracted more admiration of late  years than formerly. It is remarkable, that not only Zuccaro, who was  indeed a superficial writer, but that Vasari, and Lomazzo himself, so  much more profound than either of them, should not have conferred on him  that praise which he afterwards received from Algarotti, Lazzarini, and  Mengs. Lionardo was the first, as we shall see in the Milanese School,  to lead the way to delicacy of expression; but that master, who painted  so little, and with such labour, is not to be compared to Raffaello, who  possessed the whole quality in its fullest extent. There is not a  movement of the soul, there is not a character of passion known to the  ancients, and capable of being expressed by art, that he has not caught,  expressed, and varied, in a thousand different ways, and always within  the bounds of propriety. We have no tradition of his having, like Da  Vinci, frequented the public streets to seek for subjects for his  pencil; and his numerous pictures prove that he could not have devoted  so much time to this study, while his drawings clearly evince, that he  had not equal occasion for such assistance. Nature, as I have before  remarked, had endowed him with an imagination which transported his mind  to the scene of the event, either fabulous or remote, in which he was  engaged, and awoke in him the very same emotions which the subjects of  such story must themselves have experienced; and this vivid conception  assisted him until he had designed his subject with that distinctness  which he had either observed in other countenances, or found in his own  mind. This faculty, seldom found in poets, and still more rarely in  painters, no one possessed in a more eminent degree than Raffaello. His  figures are passions personified; and love, fear, hope, and desire,  anger, placability, humility, or pride, assume their places by turns, as  the subject changes; and while the spectator regards the countenances,  the air, and the gestures of his figures, he forgets that they are the  work of art, and is surprised to find his own feelings excited, and  himself an actor in the scene before him. There is another delicacy of  expression, and this is the gradation of the passions, by which every  one perceives whether they are in their commencement or at their height,  or in their decline. He had observed their shades of difference in the  intercourse of life, and on every occasion he knew how to transfer the  result of his observations to his canvas. Even his silence is eloquent,  and every actor      \"Il cor negli occhi, e nella fronte ha scritto:\"    the smallest perceptible motion of the eyes, of the nostrils, of the  mouth, and of the fingers, corresponds to the chief movements of every  passion; the most animated and vivid actions discover the violence of  the passion that excites them; and what is more, they vary in  innumerable degrees, without ever departing from nature, and conform  themselves to a diversity of character without ever risking propriety.  His heroes possess the mien of valour; his vulgar, an air of debasement;  and that, which neither the pen nor the tongue could describe, the  genius and art of Raffaello would delineate with a few strokes of the  pencil.

I have never been able to get much help from cook-books, or the scores  of recipes published in various works on out-door sport. Take, for  example, Frank Forester's \"Fish and Fishing.\" He has more than seventy  recipes for cooking fish, over forty of which contain terms or names in  French. I dare say they are good--for a first-class hotel. I neither  cook nor converse in French, and I have come to know that the plainest  cooking is the best, so that it be well done and wholesome. In making up  the rations for camping out, the first thing usually attended to is  bread. And if this be light, well-made bread, enough may be taken along  to last four or five days, and this may be eked out with Boston  crackers, or the best hard-tack, for a couple or three days more,  without the least hardship. Also, there are few camps in which some one  is not going out to the clearings every few days for mail, small stores,  etc., and a supply of bread can be arranged for, with less trouble than  it can be made. There are times, however, when this is not feasible, and  there are men who prefer warm bread all the time. In this case the usual  resort, from Maine to Alaska, is the universal flapjack. I do not like  it; I seldom make it; it is not good. But it may be eaten, with maple  syrup or sugar and butter. I prefer a plain water Johnnycake, made as  follows (supposing your tins are something like those described in  Chapter II): Put a little more than a pint of water in your kettle and  bring it to a sharp boil, adding a small teaspoonful of salt, and two of  sugar. Stir in slowly enough good corn meal to make a rather stiff mush,  let it cook a few minutes, and set it off the fire; then grease your  largest tin dish and put the mush in it, smoothing it on top. Set the  dish on the out-door range described in the previous chapter, with a  lively bed of coal beneath--but no blaze. Invert the second sized tin  over the cake, and cover the dish with bright live coals, that bottom  and top may bake evenly, and give it from thirty-five to forty minutes  for baking. It makes wholesome, palatable bread, which gains on the  taste with use.    Those who prefer wheat bread can make a passable article by using the  best wheat flour with baking powders, mixing three tablespoonfuls of the  powders to a quart of flour. Mix and knead thoroughly with warm water to  a rather thin dough, and bake as above. Use the same proportions for  pancake batter. When stopping in a permanent camp with plenty of time to  cook, excellent light bread may be made by using dry yeast cakes, though  it is not necessary to \"set\" the sponge as directed on the papers.  Scrape and dissolve half a cake of the yeast in a gill of warm water,  and mix it with the flour. Add warm water enough to make it pliable, and  not too stiff; set in a warm place until it rises sufficiently, and  bake as directed above. It takes several hours to rise.    I am afraid I shall discount my credit on camp cooking when I admit  that--if I must use fine flour--I prefer unleavened bread; what my  friends irreverently call \"club bread.\" Not that it was ever made or  endorsed by any club of men that I know of, but because it is baked on a  veritable club, sassafras or black birch. This is how to make it: Cut a  club two feet long and three inches thick at the broadest end; peel or  shave off the bark smoothly, and sharpen the smaller end neatly. Then  stick the sharpened end in the ground near the fire, leaning the broad  end toward a bed of live coals, where it will get screeching hot. While  it is heating, mix rather more than a half pint of best Minnesota flour  with enough warm water to make a dough. Add a half teaspoonful of salt,  and a teaspoonful of sugar, and mould and pull the dough until it  becomes lively. Now, work it into a ribbon two inches wide and half an  inch thick, wind the ribbon spirally around the broad end of the club,  stick the latter in front of the fire so that the bread will bake evenly  and quickly to a light brown, and turn frequently until done, which will  be in about thirty minutes. When done take it from the fire, stand the  club firmly upright, and pick the bread off in pieces as you want it to  eat. It will keep hot a long time, and one soon becomes fond of it.    [Sidenote: _Coffee_]    To make perfect coffee, just two ingredients are necessary, and only  two. These are water and coffee. It is owing to the bad management of  the latter that we drink poor coffee.    Mocha is generally considered to be the best type of coffee, with Java a  close second. It is the fashion at present to mix the two in proportions  to suit, some taking two parts Java to one of Mocha, others reversing  these proportions. Either way is good, or the Mocha is quite as good  alone. But there is a better berry than either for the genuine coffee  toper. This is the small, dark green berry that comes to market under  the generic name of Rio, that name covering half a dozen grades of  coffee raised in different provinces of Brazil, throughout a country  extending north and south for more than 1,200 miles. The berry alluded  to is produced along the range of high hills to the westward of Bahia,  and extending north toward the Parnahiba. It has never arrested  attention as a distinct grade of the article, but it contains more  coffee or caffein to the pound than any berry known to commerce. It is  the smallest, heaviest and darkest green of any coffee that comes to our  market from Brazil, and may be known by these traits. I have tested it  in the land where it is grown, and also at home, for the past sixteen  years, and I place it at the head of the list, with Mocha next. Either  will make perfect coffee, if treated as follows: Of the berry, browned  and ground, take six heaping tablespoonfuls, and add three pints of cold  water; place the kettle over the fire and bring to a sharp boil; set it  a little aside where it will bubble and simmer until wanted, and just  before pouring, drip in a half gill of cold water to settle it. That is  all there is to it. The quantity of berry is about twice as much as  usually given in recipes; but if you want coffee, you had better add two  spoonfuls than cut off one.    In 1867, and again in 1870, I had occasion to visit the West India  Islands and Brazil. In common with most coffee topers, I had heard much  of the super-excellence ascribed to \"West India coffee\" and \"Brazilian  coffee.\" I concluded to investigate. I had rooms at the Hotel d'Europe,  Para, North Brazil. There were six of us, English and American boarders.  Every morning, before we were out of our hammocks, a barefooted, half  naked Mina negress came around and served each of us with a small cup of  strong, black coffee, and sugar ad libitum. There was not enough of it  for a drink; it was rather in the nature of a medicine, and so  intended--\"To kill the biscos,\" they said. The coffee was above  criticism.    I went, in the dark of a tropical morning, with Senhor Joao, to the  coffee factory where they browned the berry, and saw him buy a pound,  smoking hot, for which he paid twenty-five cents, or quite as much as it  would cost in New York. In ten minutes the coffee was at the hotel, and  ground. This is the way they brewed it: A round-bottomed kettle was  sitting on the brick range, with a half gallon of boiling water in it.  Over the kettle a square piece of white flannel was suspended, caught up  at the corners like a dip net. In this the coffee was placed, and a  small darky put in his time steadily with a soup ladle, dipping the  boiling water from the kettle and pouring it on the coffee. There was a  constant stream percolating through coffee and cloth, which, in the  course of half an hour, became almost black, and clear as brandy. This  was \"Brazilian coffee.\" As the cups used were very small, and as none  but the Northerners drank more than one cup, I found that the hotel did  not use over two quarts of coffee each morning. It struck me that a  pound of fresh Rio coffee berry ought to make a half gallon of rather  powerful coffee.    On my arrival home--not having any small darky or any convenient  arrangement for the dip net--I had a sack made of light, white flannel,  holding about one pint. In this I put one-quarter pound of freshly  ground berry, with water enough for five large cups. It was boiled  thoroughly, and proved just as good as the Brazilian article, but too  strong for any of the family except the writer. Those who have a fancy  for clear, strong \"Brazilian coffee,\" will see how easily and simply it  can be made.    But, on a heavy knapsack-and-rifle tramp among the mountains, or a lone  canoe cruise in a strange wilderness, I do not carry coffee. I prefer  tea. Often, when too utterly tired and beaten for further travel, I have  tried coffee, whisky or brandy, and a long experience convinces me that  there is nothing so restful and refreshing to an exhausted man as a dish  of strong, green tea. To make it as it should be made, bring the water  to a high boil, and let it continue to boil for a full minute. Set it  off the fire and it will cease boiling; put in a handful of tea, and it  will instantly boil up again; then set it near the fire, where it will  simmer for a few minutes, when it will be ready for use. Buy the best  green tea you can find, and use it freely on a hard tramp. Black, or  Oolong tea, is excellent in camp. It should be put in the pot with cold  water and brought to the boiling point.    [Sidenote: _Potatoes_]    Almost any man can cook potatoes, but few cook them well. Most people  think them best boiled in their jackets, and to cook them perfectly in  this manner is so simple and easy, that the wonder is how any one can  fail. A kettle of screeching hot water with a small handful of salt in  it, good potatoes of nearly equal size, washed clean and clipped at the  ends, "]]]
