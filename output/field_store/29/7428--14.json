He       may be subject,--like other Americans more or less _ideologists_       and system-mongers,--to illusions; but he has the true remedy: his       _ideal_ is well placed; he can sympathize fervently with all the       pursuits and employments of human activity; he cherishes a profound       respect for prudence, and moderation; for an enlarging survey and       indulgence of human necessities; for that generosity and virtue       which is tender above all of what has life, and seeks to conciliate       a complete transformation in the ideas of men. Until now, it would       have been difficult to find a thinker who, in judging the Romans,       would not have celebrated their inordinate patriotism, as their       chief glory. Their heroes were admired precisely for the ardor with       which they sacrificed everything--even their children or their       conscience--to the interests of country or party. Mr. Elliot, on       the contrary, discovers in this heroism only a lamentable       deficiency of true virtue and honor; of a sound moral sense and       equitable liberality. To our apprehension, a great reform--an       historical event--is to be recognized in this new moral       repugnance--this new tendency to deem the spirit of _party_ an evil       and a danger. Formerly, nothing was conceived to be nobler than to       serve your party, without stint or reservation;--nothing more       disgraceful than to abandon it even when you could not entertain       the same opinions. The condemnation and reversal of this doctrine       would be a moral advancement more important for human futurity,       than many of the occurrences or the revolutions of the last sixty       years, that have made the most noise.\"    We believe Mr. Elliot's leisure is not to be seriously interrupted by  public employments, and trust, therefore, that he will proceed, with as  much rapidity as possible, with his grand survey of the advance of  Liberty, down even to our own day--which it is not unlikely will  conclude a very important era of his subject.           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Bowring, who is now, we believe, British Consul at Canton, was the  editor of the last and only complete edition of Jeremy Bentham's works;  he has been one of the most voluminous contributors to the Westminster  Review, and he is eminent as a linguist, though if we may judge by some  of his performances, not very justly so. He translated and edited  specimens of the poetry of several northern nations, and it has often  been charged as an illustration of his dishonesty, that he omitted a  stanza of the sublime hymn of Derzhaven, a Russian, to the Deity,  because it recognized the divinity of Christ, as it is held by  Trinitarians--the Doctor being a Unitarian. He is sharply satirized, and  treated frequently with extreme and probably quite undeserved contempt,  in the Diaries and Correspondence of the late Hugh Swinton Legare.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Henry Rogers, of Birmingham, has published in London two stout  volumes of his contributions to the _Edinburgh Review_. They are not the  best things that ever appeared under the old \"buff and blue,\" though  they are neat and very readable. Hitherto Professor Rogers has not been  known in literature, except by an edition of the works of Burke. The  reviewals or essays in this collection are divided into biographical,  critical, theological, and political. The first volume consists  principally of a series of sketches of great minds,--in the style,  half-biographical, half-critical, of which so many admirable specimens  have adorned the literature of this age. Indeed, such _demonstrations_  in mental anatomy have been a favorite study in all ages. Among Mr.  Rogers's subjects, are Pascal, Luther, Leibnitz, and Plato, and he  promises sketches of Descartes, Malabranche, Hobbes, Berkeley, and  Locke. The first article, on Thomas Fuller, may look rather dry at  first; but the interest increases, we admire the quaintness of old  Fuller, and not less the fine, accurate, and complete picture given of  his life, character, and works. In this, as in the other biographical  articles, Mr. Rogers tells his story fluently. If he has not the wit of  Sydney Smith, nor the brilliance of Macaulay, he has not the prosiness  of Alison, nor the bitterness of Gifford. He is witty with Fuller,  sarcastic with Marvell, energetic with Luther, philosophical and precise  with Leibnitz, quietly satirical with Pascal, and reflective and  intellectual with Plato. \"Dead as a last year's reviewal\" is no longer  among the proverbs. Books are too numerous to be read, and people make  libraries of the quarterlies,--thanks to the facilities afforded by Mr.  Leonard Scott! And reviews, properly written,--evincing some knowledge  of the books which furnish their titles, are very delightful and useful  reading, frequently more so than the productions which suggest them, of  which they ought always to give an intelligible description. And this  condition is fulfilled almost always by the reviews published in London  and Edinburgh. Our _North American_ sometimes gives us tolerably  faithful abstracts, and its readers would be glad if its writers would  confine themselves to such labors. But we read an article in it not long  ago, under the title of Mr. Carey's \"Past and Present,\" which contained  no further allusion to this book, nor the slightest evidence that the  \"reviewer\" had ever seen it. On the other hand, the last number contains  a paper on the Homeric question, purporting to have been occasioned by  Mr. Grote's History of Greece, but deriving its learning, we understand,  altogether from Mr. Mure's History of Greek Literature, a work so  extensive that it is not likely to be reprinted, or largely imported.    This custom which now obtains, of reprinting reviewals, we believe was  begun in this country, where Mr. Emerson brought out a collection of  Carlyle's Essays, Andrews Norton one of Macaulay's, Dr. Furness one of  Professor Wilson's, Mr. Edward Carey one of Lord Jeffrey's, &c. several  years before any such collections appeared in England.           *       *       *       *       *    Respecting the Holy Land, no work of so much absolute value has appeared  since Dr. Robinson's, as the Historical and Geographical Sketch by Rabbi  Joseph Schwartz, in a large and thick octavo, with numerous  illustrations, lately published in Philadelphia by Mr. Hart. Rabbi  Schwartz resided in Palestine sixteen years, and he is the only Jew of  eminence who has written of the country from actual observation, since  the time of Benjamin of Tudela. The learned author wrote his work in  Hebrew, and it has been translated by Rabbi Isaac Leeser, one of the  ablest divines in Philadelphia. It is addressed particularly to Jewish  readers, to whom the translator remarks in his preface, \"It is hoped  that it may contribute to extend the knowledge of Palestine, and rouse  many to study the rich treasures which our ancient literature affords,  and also to enkindle sympathy and kind acts for those of our brothers  who still cling to the soil of our ancestors and love the dust in which  many of our saints sleep in death, awaiting a glorious resurrection and  immortality.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. John R. Thompson, the accomplished and much esteemed editor of the  _Southern Literary Messenger_, whose genuine and intelligent love of  literature is illustrated in every number of his excellent magazine, has  just published a wise and eloquent address on the present state of  education in Virginia, which was delivered before the literary societies  of Washington College, at Lexington. It discloses the causes of the  ignorance of reading and writing by seventy thousand adults in Virginia,  and forcibly and impressively urges the necessity of a thorough literary  culture to the common prosperity.           *       *       *       *       *    A New Play by Mr. Marston, founded on the story of Philip Augustus of  France and Marie de Meranie, has been put into rehearsal at the Olympic  Theater in London.           *       *       *       *       *    The Leipzic _Grenzboten_ notices Mrs. Maberly's new romance of \"Fashion\"  (which we believe has not yet been republished in America) with great  praise, as a work of striking power and artistic management.  Nevertheless, says the critic, this romance has excited in England as  much anger as attention, and this he attributes to the truth with which  the authoress has depicted the aristocratic world. He then makes the  following remarks, which are curious enough to be translated: \"The  meaning of the word 'fashion' cannot be rendered in a foreign language.  _La mode_ and its tyranny approach somewhat to the sense, but still it  remains unintelligible to us Germans, because we have no idea of the  capricious, silly, and despotic laws of fashion in England. They do not  relate, as with us, to mere outward things, as clothes and furniture,  but especially to position and estimation in high society. In order to  play a part on that stage it is necessary to understand the mysterious  conditions and requirements which the goddess Fashion prescribes. High  birth and riches, wit and beauty, find no mercy with her if her  whimsical laws are not obeyed. In what these laws consist no living soul  can say: they are double, yes three-fold, the _je ne sais quoi_ of the  French. The exclusiveness of English society is well known, a  peculiarity in which it is only excelled by its copyist the American  society of New York and Boston. But it is not enough to have obtained  admission into the magic circle: there, too, fashion implacably demands  its victims, and to her as to Moloch earthly and heavenly goods, wealth,  and peace of soul,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3788"],[0,"Haydn (#14)"],[1," to our favoured isle, Already partial to thy name  and style; Long may thy fountain of invention run In streams as rapid  as it first begun; While skill for each fantastic whim provides, And  certain science ev'ry current guides! Oh, may thy days, from human  suff'rings, free, Be blest with glory and felicity, With full fruition,  to a distant hour, Of all thy magic and creative pow'r! Blest in  thyself, with rectitude of mind, And blessing, with thy talents, all  mankind!    Like \"the man Sterne\" after the publication of Tristram Shandy, he was  soon deep in social engagements for weeks ahead. \"I could dine out every  day,\" he informs his friends in Germany. Shortly after his arrival he  was conducted by the Academy of Ancient Music into a \"very handsome  room\" adjoining the Freemasons' Hall, and placed at a table where covers  were laid for 200. \"It was proposed that I should take a seat near the  top, but as it so happened that I had dined out that very day, and  ate more than usual, I declined the honour, excusing myself under the  pretext of not being very well; but in spite of this, I could not  get off drinking the health, in Burgundy, of the harmonious gentlemen  present. All responded to it, but at last allowed me to go home.\"  This sort of thing strangely contrasted with the quiet, drowsy life  of Esterhaz; and although Haydn evidently felt flattered by so much  attention, he often expressed a wish that he might escape in order to  have more peace for work.    Ideas of London    His ideas about London were mixed and hesitating. He was chiefly  impressed by the size of the city, a fact which the Londoner of to-day  can only fully appreciate when he remembers that in Haydn's time  Regent Street had not been built and Lisson Grove was a country lane.  Mendelssohn described the metropolis as \"that smoky nest which is fated  to be now and ever my favourite residence.\" But Haydn's regard was less  for the place itself than for the people and the music. The fogs  brought him an uncommonly severe attack of rheumatism, which he naively  describes as \"English,\" and obliged him to wrap up in flannel from head  to foot. The street noises proved a great distraction--almost as much as  they proved to Wagner in 1839, when the composer of \"Lohengrin\" had to  contend with an organ-grinder at each end of the street! He exclaimed in  particular against \"the cries of the common people selling their wares.\"  It was very distracting, no doubt, for, as a cynic has said, one cannot  compose operas or write books or paint pictures in the midst of a row.  Haydn desired above all things quiet for his work, and so by-and-by, as  a solace for the evils which afflicted his ear, he removed himself  from Great Pulteney Street to Lisson Grove--\"in the country amid lovely  scenery, where I live as if I were in a monastery.\"    Haydn at Court    For the present the dining and the entertaining went on. The 12th of  January found him at the \"Crown and Anchor\" in the Strand, where the  Anacreonatic Society expressed their respect and admiration in the usual  fashion. The 18th of the same month was the Queen's birthday, and  Haydn was invited to a Court ball in the evening. This was quite an  exceptional distinction, for he had not yet been \"presented\" at Court.  Probably he owed it to the Prince of Wales, afterwards George IV. The  Prince was a musical amateur, like his father and his grandfather, whose  enthusiasm for Handel it is hardly necessary to recall. He played the  'cello--\"not badly for a Prince,\" to parody Boccherini's answer to his  royal master--and liked to take his part in glees and catches. Haydn was  charmed by his affability. \"He is the handsomest man on God's earth,\"  wrote the composer. \"He has an extraordinary love for music, and a great  deal of feeling, but very little money.\" These courtesies to Haydn may  perhaps be allowed to balance the apparent incivility shown to Beethoven  and Weber, who sent compositions to the same royal amateur that were  never so much as acknowledged.    But even the attentions of princes may become irksome and unprofitable.  Haydn soon found that his health and his work were suffering from the  flood of social engagements which London poured upon him. The dinner  hour at this time was six o'clock. He complained that the hour was too  late, and made a resolve to dine at home at four. He wanted his mornings  for composition, and if visitors must see him they would have to wait  till afternoon. Obviously he was beginning to tire of \"the trivial  round.\"    Unreasoning Rivalries    The Salomon concerts should have begun in January, but London, as it  happened, was suffering from one of those unreasoning rivalries which  made a part of Handel's career so miserable, and helped to immortalize  the names of Gluck and Piccini. It is hardly worth reviving the details  of such ephemeral contests now. In the present case the factionists were  to some extent swayed by financial interests; to a still greater extent  by professional jealousies. The trouble seems to have arisen originally  in connection with Gallini's preparations for the opening of a new Opera  House in the Haymarket. Salomon had engaged Cappelletti and David as his  principal vocalists; but these, it appeared, were under contract not to  sing in public before the opening of the Opera House. One faction did  not want to have the Opera House opened at all. They were interested in  the old Pantheon, and contended that a second Italian Opera House was  altogether unnecessary.    Temporarily eclipsed    Salomon's first concert, already postponed to February 25, had been  fixed for the 11th of March, on which date David, by special permission,  was to appear \"whether the Opera house was open or not.\" The delay was  extremely awkward for both Haydn and Salomon, particularly for Haydn. He  had been brought to London with beat of drum, and here he was compelled  to hide his light while the directors of the professional concerts shot  ahead of him and gained the ear of the public before he could assert his  superiority. By this time also the element of professional jealousy  had come into free play. Depreciatory paragraphs appeared in the public  prints \"sneering at the composer as 'a nine days' wonder,' whom closer  acquaintance would prove to be inferior to either Cramer or Clementi;  and alluding to the 'proverbial avarice' of the Germans as tempting so  many artists, who met with scanty recognition from their own countrymen  to herald their arrival in England with such a flourish of trumpets as  should charm the money out of the pockets of easily-gulled John Bull.\"  These pleasantries were continued on rather different lines, when at  length Haydn was in a position to justify the claims made for him.    Band and Baton    Haydn, meanwhile, had been rehearsing the symphony for his opening  concert. Two points are perhaps worth noting here: First, the size and  strength of the Salomon Orchestra; and second, the fact that Haydn did  not, as every conductor does now, direct his forces, baton in hand.  The orchestra numbered between thirty-five and forty performers--a very  small company compared with our Handel Festival and Richter Orchestras,  but in Haydn's time regarded as quite sufficiently strong. There were  sixteen violins, four tenors, three 'celli, four double basses, flutes,  oboes, bassoons, trumpets and drums.    Salomon played the first violin and led the orchestra, and Haydn sat  at the harpsichord, keeping the band together by an occasional chord  or two, as the practice then was. Great composers have not always  been great conductors, but Haydn had a winning way with his band, and  generally succeeded in getting what he wanted.    A Rehersal Incident    An interesting anecdote is told by Dies of his first experience with the  Salomon Orchestra. The symphony began with three single notes, which the  orchestra played much too loudly; Haydn called for less tone a second  and a third time, and still was dissatisfied. He was growing impatient.  At this point he overheard a German player whisper to a neighbour in his  own language: \"If the first three notes don't please him, how shall we  get through all the rest?\" Thereupon, calling for the loan of a violin,  he illustrated his meaning to such purpose that the band answered to  his requirements in the first attempt. Haydn was naturally at a great  disadvantage with an English orchestra by reason of his ignorance of  the language. It may be true, as he said, that the language of music \"is  understood all over the world,\" but one cannot talk to an orchestra in  crotchets and semi-breves.    The Hanover Square Rooms    At length the date of the first concert arrived, and a brilliant  audience rewarded the enterprise, completely filling the Hanover Square  Rooms, at that time the principal concert hall in London. It had been  opened in 1775 by J. C. Bach, the eleventh son of the great Sebastian,  when the advertisements announced that \"the ladies' tickets are red and  the gentlemen's black.\" It was there that, two years after the date  of which we are writing, \"Master Hummel, from Vienna,\" gave his first  benefit; Liszt appeared in 1840, when the now familiar term \"recital\"  was first used; Rubinstein made his English debut in 1842; and in the  same year Mendelssohn conducted his Scotch Symphony for the first time  in England. In 1844 the \"wonderful little Joachim,\" then a youth of  thirteen in a short jacket, made the first of his many subsequent visits  to London, and played in the old \"Rooms.\"    Hoops and Swords    So much for the associations of the concert hall in which Haydn directed  some of his finest symphonies. And what about the audiences of Haydn's  time? It was the day of the Sedan chair, when women waddled in hoops,  like that of the lady mentioned in the Spectator, who appeared \"as if  she stood in a large drum.\" Even the royal princesses were, in Pope's  phrase, \"armed"]]]
