Fear is a good  thing for the wild creatures to have in superabundance. It often saves  them from real danger. But how undiscriminating it is! It is said  that an iron hoop or wagon-tire placed around a setting hen in the  woods will protect her from the foxes.    Animals are afraid on general principles. Anything new and strange  excites their suspicions. In a herd of animals, cattle, or horses,  fear quickly becomes a panic and rages like a conflagration. Cattlemen  in the West found that any little thing at night might kindle the  spark in their herds and sweep the whole mass away in a furious  stampede. Each animal excites every other, and the multiplied fear of  the herd is something terrible. Panics among men are not much  different.    In a discussion like the present one, let us use words in their strict  logical sense, if possible. Most of the current misconceptions in  natural history, as in other matters, arise from a loose and careless  use of words. One says teach and train and instruct, when the facts  point to instinctive imitation or unconscious communication.    That the young of all kinds thrive better and develop more rapidly  under the care of their parents than when deprived of that care is  obvious enough. It would be strange if it were not so. Nothing can  quite fill the place of the mother with either man or bird or beast.  The mother provides and protects. The young quickly learn of her  through the natural instinct of imitation. They share her fears, they  follow in her footsteps, they look to her for protection; it is the  order of nature. They are not trained in the way they should go, as a  child is by its human parents--they are not trained at all; but their  natural instincts doubtless act more promptly and surely with the  mother than without her. That a young kingfisher or a young osprey  would, in due time, dive for fish, or a young marsh hawk catch mice  and birds, or a young fox or wolf or coon hunt for its proper prey  without the parental example, admits of no doubt at all; but they  would each probably do this thing earlier and better in the order of  nature than if that order were interfered with.    The other day I saw a yellow-bellied woodpecker alight upon a decaying  beech and proceed to drill for a grub. Two of its fully grown young  followed it and, alighting near, sidled up to where the parent was  drilling. A hasty observer would say that the parent was giving its  young a lesson in grub-hunting, but I read the incident differently.  The parent bird had no thought of its young. It made passes at them  when they came too near, and drove them away. Presently it left the  tree, whereupon one of the young examined the hole its parent had made  and drilled a little on its own account. A parental example like this  may stimulate the young to hunt for grubs earlier than they would  otherwise do, but this is merely conjecture. There is no proof of it,  nor can there be any.    The mother bird or beast does not have to be instructed in her  maternal duties: they are instinctive with her; it is of vital  importance to the continuance of the species that they should be. If  it were a matter of instruction or acquired knowledge, how precarious  it would be!    The idea of teaching is an advanced idea, and can come only to a being  that is capable of returning upon itself in thought, and that can form  abstract conceptions--conceptions that float free, so to speak,  dissociated from particular concrete objects.    If a fox, or a wolf, for instance, were capable of reflection and of  dwelling upon the future and upon the past, it might feel the need of  instructing its young in the matter of traps and hounds, if such a  thing were possible without language. When the cat brings her kitten a  live mouse, she is not thinking about instructing it in the art of  dealing with mice, but is intent solely upon feeding her young. The  kitten already knows, through inheritance, about mice. So when the hen  leads her brood forth and scratches for them, she has but one  purpose--to provide them with food. If she is confined to the coop,  the chickens go forth and soon scratch for themselves and snap up the  proper insect food.    The mother's care and protection count for much, but they do not take  the place of inherited instinct. It has been found that newly hatched  chickens, when left to themselves, do not know the difference between  edible and non-edible insects, but that they soon learn. In such  matters the mother hen, no doubt, guides them.    A writer in \"Forest and Stream,\" who has since published a book about  his \"wild friends,\" pushes this notion that animals train their young  so far that it becomes grotesque. Here are some of the things that  this keen observer and exposer of \"false natural history\" reports that  he has seen about his cabin in the woods: He has seen an old crow that  hurriedly flew away from his cabin door on his sudden appearance,  return and beat its young because they did not follow quickly enough.  He has seen a male chewink, while its mate was rearing a second brood,  take the first brood and lead them away to a bird-resort (he probably  meant to say to a bird-nursery or kindergarten); and when one of the  birds wandered back to take one more view of the scenes of its  infancy, he has seen the father bird pounce upon it and give it a  \"severe whipping and take it to the resort again.\"    He has seen swallows teach their young to fly by gathering them upon  fences and telegraph wires and then, at intervals (and at the word of  command, I suppose), launching out in the air with them, and swooping  and circling about. He has seen a song sparrow, that came to his  dooryard for fourteen years (he omitted to say that he had branded him  and so knew his bird), teach _his year-old boy to sing_ (the italics  are mine). This hermit-inclined sparrow wanted to \"desert the fields  for a life in the woods,\" but his \"wife would not consent.\" Many a  featherless biped has had the same experience with his society-spoiled  wife. The puzzle is, how did this masterly observer know that this  state of affairs existed between this couple? Did the wife tell him,  or the husband? \"Hermit\" often takes his visitors to a wood thrushes'  singing-school, where, \"as the birds forget their lesson, they drop  out one by one.\"    He has seen an old rooster teaching a young rooster to crow! At first  the old rooster crows mostly in the morning, but later in the season  he crows throughout the day, at short intervals, to show the young  \"the proper thing.\" \"Young birds removed out of hearing will not learn  to crow.\" He hears the old grouse teaching the young to drum in the  fall, though he neglects to tell us that he has seen the young in  attendance upon these lessons. He has seen a mother song sparrow  helping her two-year-old daughter build her nest. He has discovered  that the cat talks to her kittens with her ears: when she points them  forward, that means \"yes;\" when she points them backward, that means  \"no.\" Hence she can tell them whether the wagon they hear approaching  is the butcher's cart or not, and thus save them the trouble of  looking out.    And so on through a long list of wild and domestic creatures. At first  I suspected this writer was covertly ridiculing a certain other  extravagant \"observer,\" but a careful reading of his letter shows him  to be seriously engaged in the worthy task of exposing \"false natural  history.\"    Now the singing of birds, the crowing of cocks, the drumming of  grouse, are secondary sexual characteristics. They are not necessary  to the lives of the creatures, and are probably more influenced by  imitation than are the more important instincts of self-preservation  and reproduction. Yet the testimony is overwhelming that birds will  sing and roosters crow and turkeys gobble, though they have never  heard these sounds; and, no doubt, the grouse and the woodpeckers drum  from promptings of the same sexual instinct.    I do not wish to accuse \"Hermit\" of willfully perverting the facts of  natural history. He is one of those persons who read their own fancies  into whatever they look upon. He is incapable of disinterested  observation, which means he is incapable of observation at all in the  true sense. There are no animals that signal to each other with their  ears. The movements of the ears follow the movements of the eye. When  an animal's attention is directed to any object or sound, its ears  point forward; when its attention is relaxed, the ears fall. But with  the cat tribe the ears are habitually erect, as those of the horse are  usually relaxed. They depress them and revert them, as do many other  animals, when angered or afraid.    Certain things in animal life lead me to suspect that animals have  some means of communication with one another, especially the  gregarious animals, that is quite independent of what we mean by  language. It is like an interchange or blending of subconscious  states, and may be analogous to telepathy among human beings. Observe  what a unit a flock of birds becomes when performing their evolutions  in the air. They are not many, but one, turning and flashing in the  sun with a unity and a precision that it would be hard to imitate. One  may see a flock of shore-birds that behave as one body: now they turn  to the sun a sheet of silver; then, as their dark backs are presented  to the beholder, they almost disappear against the shore or the  clouds. It would seem as if they shared in a communal mind or spirit,  and that what one felt they all felt at the same instant.    In Florida I many times saw large schools of mullets fretting and  breaking the surface of the water with what seemed to be the tips of  their tails. A large area would be agitated and rippled by the backs  or tails of a host of fishes. Then suddenly, while I looked,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3029"],[0,"Real Soldiers of Fortune (#14)"],[1,"overnment, unwillingly, to appoint a committee to  investigate the need of economy. For a beginner this was a distinct  triumph.    With Lord Hugh Cecil, Lord Percy, Ian Malcolm, and other clever young  men, he formed inside the Conservative Party a little group that in its  obstructive and independent methods was not unlike the Fourth Party of  his father. From its leader and its filibustering, guerilla-like tactics  the men who composed it were nicknamed the \"Hughligans.\" The Hughligans  were the most active critics of the Ministry and of all in their own  party, and as members of the Free Food League they bitterly attacked  the fiscal proposals of Mr. Chamberlain. When Balfour made Chamberlain's  fight for fair trade, or for what virtually was protection, a measure  of the Conservatives, the lines of party began to break, and men were no  longer Conservatives or Liberals, but Protectionists or Free Traders.    Against this Churchill daily protested, against Chamberlain, against his  plan, against that plan being adopted by the Tory Party. By tradition,  by inheritance, by instinct, Churchill was a Tory.    \"I am a Tory,\" he said, \"and I have as much right in the party as has  anybody else, certainly as much as certain people from Birmingham. They  can't turn us out, and we, the Tory Free Traders, have as much right  to dictate the policy of the Conservative Party as have any reactionary  Fair Traders.\" In 1904 the Conservative Party already recognized  Churchill as one working outside the breastworks. Just before the Easter  vacation of that year, when he rose to speak a remarkable demonstration  was made against him by his Unionist colleagues, all of them rising and  leaving the House.    To the Liberals who remained to hear him he stated that if to his  constituents his opinions were obnoxious, he was ready to resign his  seat. It then was evident he would go over to the Liberal Party. Some  thought he foresaw which way the tidal wave was coming, and to being  slapped down on the beach and buried in the sand, he preferred to be  swept forward on its crest. Others believed he left the Conservatives  because he could not honestly stomach the taxed food offered by Mr.  Chamberlain.    In any event, if he were to be blamed for changing from one party to  the other, he was only following the distinguished example set him by  Gladstone, Disraeli, Harcourt, and his own father.    It was at the time of this change that he was called \"the best hated  man in England,\" but the Liberals welcomed him gladly, and the National  Liberal Club paid him the rare compliment of giving in his honor a  banquet. There were present two hundred members. Up to that time this  dinner was the most marked testimony to his importance in the political  world. It was about then, a year since, that he prophesied: \"Within  nine months there will come such a tide and deluge as will sweep through  England and Scotland, and completely wash out and effect a much-needed  spring cleaning in Downing Street.\"    When the deluge came, at Manchester, Mr. Balfour was defeated, and  Churchill was victorious, and when the new Government was formed the  tidal wave landed Churchill in the office of Under-Secretary for the  Colonies.    While this is being written the English papers say that within a  month he again will be promoted. For this young man of thirty the only  promotion remaining is a position in the Cabinet, in which august body  men of fifty are considered young.    His is a picturesque career. Of any man of his few years speaking our  language, his career is probably the most picturesque. And that he is  half an American gives all of us an excuse to pretend we share in his  successes.          CAPTAIN PHILO NORTON McGIFFIN    IN the Chinese-Japanese War the battle of the Yalu was the first battle  fought between warships of modern make, and, except on paper, neither  the men who made them nor the men who fought them knew what the ships  could do, or what they might not do. For years every naval power had  been building these new engines of war, and in the battle which was to  test them the whole world was interested. But in this battle Americans  had a special interest, a human, family interest, for the reason that  one of the Chinese squadron, which was matched against some of the same  vessels of Japan which lately swept those of Russia from the sea, was  commanded by a young graduate of the American Naval Academy. This young  man, who, at the time of the battle of the Yalu, was thirty-three years  old, was Captain Philo Norton McGiffin. So it appears that five years  before our fleet sailed to victory in Manila Bay another graduate of  Annapolis, and one twenty years younger than in 1898 was Admiral Dewey,  had commanded in action a modern battleship, which, in tonnage, in  armament, and in the number of the ships' company, far outclassed  Dewey's _Olympia_.    McGiffin, who was born on December 13, 1860, came of fighting stock.  Back in Scotland the family is descended from the Clan MacGregor and the  Clan MacAlpine.    \"These are Clan-Alpine's warriors true, And, Saxon--I am Roderick Dhu.\"    McGiffin's great-grandfather, born in Scotland, emigrated to this  country and settled in \"Little Washington,\" near Pittsburg, Pa. In the  Revolutionary War he was a soldier. Other relatives fought in the War of  1812, one of them holding a commission as major. McGiffin's own father  was Colonel Norton McGiffin, who served in the Mexican War, and in  the Civil War was Lieutenant-Colonel of the Eighty-fifth Pennsylvania  Volunteers. So McGiffin inherited his love for arms.    In Washington he went to the high school and at the Washington Jefferson  College had passed through his freshman year. But the honors that might  accrue to him if he continued to live on in the quiet and pretty old  town of Washington did not tempt him. To escape into the world he  wrote his Congressman, begging him to obtain for him an appointment to  Annapolis. The Congressman liked the letter, and wrote Colonel McGiffin  to ask if the application of his son had his approval. Colonel McGiffin  was willing, and in 1877 his son received his commission as cadet  midshipman. I knew McGiffin only as a boy with whom in vacation time I  went coon hunting in the woods outside of Washington. For his age he was  a very tall boy, and in his midshipman undress uniform, to my youthful  eyes, appeared a most bold and adventurous spirit.    At Annapolis his record seems to show he was pretty much like other  boys. According to his classmates, with all of whom I find he was very  popular, he stood high in the practical studies, such as seamanship,  gunnery, navigation, and steam engineering, but in all else he was near  the foot of the class, and in whatever escapade was risky and reckless  he was always one of the leaders. To him discipline was extremely  irksome. He could maintain it among others, but when it applied to  himself it bored him. On the floor of the Academy building on which was  his room there was a pyramid of cannon balls--relics of the War of 1812.  They stood at the head of the stairs, and one warm night, when he could  not sleep, he decided that no one else should do so, and, one by one,  rolled the cannon balls down the stairs. They tore away the banisters  and bumped through the wooden steps and leaped off into the lower halls.  For any one who might think of ascending to discover the motive power  back of the bombardment they were extremely dangerous. But an officer  approached McGiffin in the rear, and, having been caught in the act, he  was sent to the prison ship. There he made good friends with his jailer,  an old man-of-warsman named \"Mike.\" He will be remembered by many naval  officers who as midshipmen served on the _Santee_. McGiffin so won  over Mike that when he left the ship he carried with him six charges of  gunpowder. These he loaded into the six big guns captured in the Mexican  War, which lay on the grass in the centre of the Academy grounds, and at  midnight on the eve of July 1st he fired a salute. It aroused the entire  garrison, and for a week the empty window frames kept the glaziers busy.    About 1878 or 1879 there was a famine in Ireland. The people of New York  City contributed provisions for the sufferers, and to carry the supplies  to Ireland the Government authorized the use of the old _Constellation_.  At the time the voyage was to begin each cadet was instructed to  consider himself as having been placed in command of the _Constellation_  and to write a report on the preparations made for the voyage, on the  loading of the vessel, and on the distribution of the stores. This  exercise was intended for the instruction of the cadets; first in the  matter of seamanship and navigation, and second in making official  reports. At that time it was a very difficult operation to get a gun out  of the port of a vessel where the gun was on a covered deck. To do this  the necessary tackles had to be rigged from the yard-arm and the yard  and mast properly braced and stayed, and then the lower block of the  tackle carried in through the gun port, which, of course, gave the fall  a very bad reeve. The first part of McGiffin's report dealt with a new  method of dismounting the guns and carrying them through the gun ports,  and so admirable was his plan, so simple and ingenious, that it was  used whenever it became necessary to dismount a gun from one of the  old sailing ships. Having, however, offered this piece of good work,  McGiffin's report proceeded to tell of the division of the ship into  compartments that were filled with a miscellaneous assortment of stores,  which included the old \"fifteen puzzles,\" at that particular time very  popular. The report terminated with a description of the joy of the  famished Irish as they received the puzzle-boxes. At another time the  cadets were required to write a report telling of the suppression of the"]]]
