The  result was that there was much talking and fighting, and nothing was  actually done until some head-man would come and take control and decide  the dispute. The method of adjudication was as follows:--From each of  the families who were regarded as responsible for the supply of a  transport animal was taken one of the embroidered garters by which the  man's felt boots are kept in their place. These garters were shuffled,  as one might shuffle a pack of cards, after which a single garter was  laid upon each load. The family to which the garter belonged thereupon  became responsible for that load and had to pack it upon the animal's  back. Although we had only ninety animals, there were forty-five  different families supplying them.    The march from Tinki to Chushar Nango was about 14 miles and was up the  valley behind Tinki to the Tinki Pass. On the way we passed  well-irrigated fields of barley and then climbed up a spur covered with  a small yellow cistus. After this a long gentle pull brought us to the  top of the pass, 17,100 feet. There was a very fine view from here to  the East looking over Tinki and Khamba Dzong and along the Northern  slopes of the Himalayas. I climbed up a hill about 600 feet above the  pass, whence I had a more extensive view still. I could see far away to  the East to Chomolhari, while in the foreground was the large and  picturesque lake called Tsomotretung backed by the rugged chain of  peaks that separated us from the valley of the Brahmaputra. To the West  we looked down into the valley of the Yaru, which flowed gently through  a broad and flat valley. To the South-west was a range of sharp granite  peaks rising up to 22,000 feet, which ran North and South and forced the  Yaru to flow round them before it could find its way into Nepal. The  descent from the pass was much steeper. We passed many of our old  friends the pink trumpet-shaped flowers, also a curious white and pink  flower, rather like a daphne in shape, and smelling very sweetly, which  grew in masses along the path. It was evidently poisonous as no animal  would touch it. I picked some flowers of it and put them in my  buttonhole, but was warned by the Tibetans not to do so, as they said it  was poisonous and would give me a headache. Lower down the valley was  full of small dwarf gorse bushes--1 foot to 18 inches high--which  carpeted the ground. Everywhere were flocks of sheep and cattle grazing  in the valley. Our camp was pitched on a grassy flat just below the  village of Chushar Nango with its fine old ruined tower of stone with  machicolated galleries all round it. To the South of us was the Nila  Pass, which afforded an easy way into Nepal. The climate here was fairly  warm, but the wind blew very strongly all that evening. Next day we saw  the mountains all covered with fresh snow down to 16,000 feet, but we  only experienced a slight drizzle as most of the snowflakes evaporated  before they reached the ground, though clouds remained overhead all the  morning. Morshead and his surveyors had been kept very busy up till now  surveying and plotting in the intervening country from the tops of the  hills, but owing to the clouds they were unable to do anything. We were  all very late in starting, as our transport animals had been changed and  the yaks that were supplied to us were very wild. In the first few  minutes after starting we saw the plain strewn with our kits and stores,  and yaks careering off in every direction with their tails in the air.    The march to Gyangkar Nangpa to-day was only a short one and led across  a wide plain through which flowed the muddy and sluggish waters of the  Yaru. The existing maps of this country were quite misleading and we  could no longer depend on them. The rivers flowed in opposite directions  to those shown on the map and mountains were shown where there were  none. After about 2 or 3 miles, we had to ford the river, which was  about 80 yards wide and not quite 3 feet deep. We then rode on across  the plain, which was in some parts sandy and in others muddy or  gravelly; evidently during the rainy season a shallow lake. In places  the dwarf gorse grew on it. The sandy tracks were covered with curious  hillocks 5 to 6 feet in height formed by the drifting sand and the gorse  bushes. These in order to keep alive were compelled to push their  branches through the sand which in its turn became piled up around them.  Towards the West end of the plain were marshes and shallow lakes around  which we had to make big detours.    Gyangkar Nangpa, which was our destination, was the country residence of  the Phari Jongpen. His brother, who was acting as agent for him, rode  out to meet us and escorted us to his house, a fine solid stone building  dominating all the small houses. The tops of the walls were covered with  gorse and juniper, rather suggestive of Christmas decorations. Tents  were pitched for us in a grass paddock close to a grove of willows. We  were then conducted upstairs into a pleasant room where were some fine  gilt Chinese cabinets and some good Chinese rugs. Here the Jongpen had a  meal prepared for us. We were first given tea, milk and beer, after  which some fifteen dumplings apiece, each as big as a small apple, were  put down in front of us together with three other bowls. In one of these  was a black Chinese sauce, in another a chillie paste, and a third  contained a barley soup. We were then given chopsticks with which we  were expected to convey the dumplings into the barley soup, break them  up there, season them with the various sauces, and then convey them to  our mouths--a not too easy feat. This meal was so satisfying that we  felt that we did not want to eat anything for a long time afterwards. We  were told that in the rainy season the river here was unfordable, as it  rose several feet and flooded over the plains, and it was then necessary  to keep to the North or to the South of it. In the evening the agent  came to make an official call and presented us with a sheep and a number  of eggs. We invited him to dinner and gave him his first taste of such  European cooking as could be provided by our native cooks.    [Illustration: GYANGKA RANGE FROM NEAR CHUSHAR.]    There was a slight frost during the night, but the day turned out very  fine. Our host accompanied us to the village of Rongkong, one of the  villages belonging to his brother, and here he said good-bye to us. The  day's march was uninteresting. We followed along the left bank of the  Yaru past well-irrigated barley fields, for there was any amount of  water here, until the valley narrowed and the sides came down steeper,  when it became covered with gorse bushes. This valley we descended for  about 10 miles until it debouched into another, a broader sandy valley  where the Yaru changed its course to the South. We forded it at a point  where it was about 90 yards wide and 31/2 feet deep, and we then sat down  and waited for our transport to come up. Beyond us lay a wide sandy  valley through which a stream flowed sometimes on the surface, but more  often underground, when it formed dangerous quicksands. When the  transport came up, our drivers were very anxious to cross immediately,  as there was a strong wind blowing and a violent sandstorm. They said  that it would be much safer to cross now that all the fresh sand had  blown over the wet sand. In the morning, they said, after a still night,  it was very dangerous, so following their advice we started off, every  one dressed up as though for a gas attack, with goggles over the eyes  and comforters or handkerchiefs tied over the mouth and nose to keep the  sand out. At first we wound our way through big sand dunes, off which  the sand was blowing like smoke. Under one of these sand dunes we found  our coolies halted and lost. Some of the donkeys, too, had been  unloaded here, as they could not find their way across in the sandstorm.  After leaving the dunes, there were wide stretches of wet sand to cross,  over which the dried sand from the dunes was being blown like long wisps  of smoke so that the whole ground appeared to be moving. In places where  the wet sand shook and quivered we galloped along. Eventually we and our  transport arrived on the far side of the plain in safety. It was now too  late, however, to go on any further, so we camped on the dunes near the  quicksands in the teeth of the gale. The sand was being whirled up on to  us and into our tents until everything and every one was full of sand.  Water was handy, but yak dung, our only fuel, was scarce and scanty.    Just before dark a very beautiful and lofty peak appeared to the  Southwards. Our drivers called it Chomo Uri (The Goddess of the  Turquoise Peak) and we had many discussions as to what mountain this  was. In the morning, after taking its bearings carefully, we decided  that this could be no other than Mount Everest. We found out afterwards  that the name, Chomo Uri, was purely a local name for the mountain.  Throughout Tibet it was known as Chomolungma--Goddess Mother of the  Country--and this is its proper Tibetan name.    Next morning, after an uncomfortable and windy night, we rode for  several miles across a plain covered with sand dunes 20 feet or more in  height. On reaching the entrance to the valley of Bhong-chu, I  determined to separate myself from the main party in order to explore a  peak which attracted my attention on the North side of the valley and  seemed to promise good views of Mount Everest and its surroundings.  After a climb of some 3,000 feet, I found myself on a spur from which I  had a very wonderful view. The view extended to the East from beyond  Chomolhari--over 120 miles away--and embraced practically all the high  snow peaks from Chomolhari to Gosainthan, a distance of some 250 miles.  In the centre Mount Everest stood"]]]
