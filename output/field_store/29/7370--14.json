[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3424"],[0,"For the Term of His Natural Life (#14)"],[1,"this way?\"    \"A 'fellow' should be able to take care of himself, Mr. Frere. I didn't  ask you to fall in love with me, did I? If you don't please me, it is  not your fault, perhaps.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"You soldiers have so many things to think of--your guards and sentries,  and visits and things. You have no time to spare for a poor woman like  me.\"    \"Spare!\" cries Frere, in amazement. \"Why, damme, you won't let a fellow  spare! I'd spare fast enough, if that was all.\" She cast her eyes down  to the deck and a modest flush rose in her cheeks. \"I have so much to  do,\" she said, in a half-whisper. \"There are so many eyes upon me, I  cannot stir without being seen.\"    She raised her head as she spoke, and to give effect to her words,  looked round the deck. Her glance crossed that of the young soldier  on the forecastle, and though the distance was too great for her to  distinguish his features, she guessed who he was--Miles was jealous.  Frere, smiling with delight at her change of manner, came close to  her, and whispered in her ear. She affected to start, and took the  opportunity of exchanging a signal with the Crow.    \"I will come at eight o'clock,\" said she, with modestly averted face.    \"They relieve the guard at eight,\" he said deprecatingly.    She tossed her head. \"Very well, then, attend to your guard; I don't  care.\"    \"But, Sarah, consider--\"    \"As if a woman in love ever considers!\" said she, turning upon him a  burning glance, which in truth might have melted a more icy man than he.  --She loved him then! What a fool he would be to refuse. To get her to  come was the first object; how to make duty fit with pleasure would be  considered afterwards. Besides, the guard could relieve itself for once  without his supervision.    \"Very well, at eight then, dearest.\"    \"Hush!\" said she. \"Here comes that stupid captain.\"    And as Frere left her, she turned, and with her eyes fixed on the  convict barricade, dropped the handkerchief she held in her hand over  the poop railing. It fell at the feet of the amorous captain, and with a  quick upward glance, that worthy fellow picked it up, and brought it to  her.    \"Oh, thank you, Captain Blunt,\" said she, and her eyes spoke more than  her tongue.    \"Did you take the laudanum?\" whispered Blunt, with a twinkle in his eye.    \"Some of it,\" said she. \"I will bring you back the bottle to-night.\"    Blunt walked aft, humming cheerily, and saluted Frere with a slap on the  back. The two men laughed, each at his own thoughts, but their laughter  only made the surrounding gloom seem deeper than before.    Sarah Purfoy, casting her eyes toward the barricade, observed a change  in the position of the three men. They were together once more, and the  Crow, having taken off his prison cap, held it at arm's length with  one hand, while he wiped his brow with the other. Her signal had been  observed.    During all this, Rufus Dawes, removed to the hospital, was lying flat on  his back, staring at the deck above him, trying to think of something he  wanted to say.    When the sudden faintness, which was the prelude to his sickness, had  overpowered him, he remembered being torn out of his bunk by fierce  hands--remembered a vision of savage faces, and the presence of  some danger that menaced him. He remembered that, while lying on  his blankets, struggling with the coming fever, he had overheard a  conversation of vital importance to himself and to the ship, but of  the purport of that conversation he had not the least idea. In vain he  strove to remember--in vain his will, struggling with delirium, brought  back snatches and echoes of sense; they slipped from him again as fast  as caught. He was oppressed with the weight of half-recollected thought.  He knew that a terrible danger menaced him; that could he but force his  brain to reason connectedly for ten consecutive minutes, he could give  such information as would avert that danger, and save the ship. But,  lying with hot head, parched lips, and enfeebled body, he was as one  possessed--he could move nor hand nor foot.    The place where he lay was but dimly lighted. The ingenuity of Pine had  constructed a canvas blind over the port, to prevent the sun striking  into the cabin, and this blind absorbed much of the light. He could but  just see the deck above his head, and distinguish the outlines of three  other berths, apparently similar to his own. The only sounds that broke  the silence were the gurgling of the water below him, and the Tap tap,  Tap tap, of Pine's hammers at work upon the new partition. By and by the  noise of these hammers ceased, and then the sick man could hear gasps,  and moans, and mutterings--the signs that his companions yet lived.    All at once a voice called out, \"Of course his bills are worth four  hundred pounds; but, my good sir, four hundred pounds to a man in my  position is not worth the getting. Why, I've given four hundred pounds  for a freak of my girl Sarah! Is it right, eh, Jezebel? She's a  good girl, though, as girls go. Mrs. Lionel Crofton, of the Crofts,  Sevenoaks, Kent--Sevenoaks, Kent--Seven----\"    A gleam of light broke in on the darkness which wrapped Rufus Dawes's  tortured brain. The man was John Rex, his berth mate. With an effort he  spoke.    \"Rex!\"    \"Yes, yes. I'm coming; don't be in a hurry. The sentry's safe, and the  howitzer is but five paces from the door. A rush upon deck, lads, and  she's ours! That is, mine. Mine and my wife's, Mrs. Lionel Crofton,  of Seven Crofts, no oaks--Sarah Purfoy, lady's-maid and nurse--ha!  ha!--lady's-maid and nurse!\"    This last sentence contained the name-clue to the labyrinth in which  Rufus Dawes's bewildered intellects were wandering. \"Sarah Purfoy!\"  He remembered now each detail of the conversation he had so strangely  overheard, and how imperative it was that he should, without delay,  reveal the plot that threatened the ship. How that plot was to be  carried out, he did not pause to consider; he was conscious that he was  hanging over the brink of delirium, and that, unless he made himself  understood before his senses utterly deserted him, all was lost.    He attempted to rise, but found that his fever-thralled limbs refused to  obey the impulse of his will. He made an effort to speak, but his tongue  clove to the roof of his mouth, and his jaws stuck together. He could  not raise a finger nor utter a sound. The boards over his head waved  like a shaken sheet, and the cabin whirled round, while the patch of  light at his feet bobbed up and down like the reflection from a wavering  candle. He closed his eyes with a terrible sigh of despair, and resigned  himself to his fate. At that instant the sound of hammering ceased, and  the door opened. It was six o'clock, and Pine had come to have a last  look at his patients before dinner. It seemed that there was somebody  with him, for a kind, though somewhat pompous, voice remarked upon the  scantiness of accommodation, and the \"necessity--the absolute necessity\"  of complying with the King's Regulations.    Honest Vickers, though agonized for the safety of his child, would not  abate a jot of his duty, and had sternly come to visit the sick men,  aware as he was that such a visit would necessitate his isolation from  the cabin where his child lay. Mrs. Vickers--weeping and bewailing  herself coquettishly at garrison parties--had often said that \"poor dear  John was such a disciplinarian, quite a slave to the service.\"    \"Here they are,\" said Pine; \"six of 'em. This fellow\"--going to the  side of Rex--\"is the worst. If he had not a constitution like a horse, I  don't think he could live out the night.\"    \"Three, eighteen, seven, four,\" muttered Rex; \"dot and carry one. Is  that an occupation for a gentleman? No, sir. Good night, my lord, good  night. Hark! The clock is striking nine; five, six, seven, eight! Well,  you've had your day, and can't complain.\"    \"A dangerous fellow,\" says Pine, with the light upraised. \"A very  dangerous fellow--that is, he was. This is the place, you see--a regular  rat-hole; but what can one do?\"    \"Come, let us get on deck,\" said Vickers, with a shudder of disgust.    Rufus Dawes felt the sweat break out into beads on his forehead. They  suspected nothing. They were going away. He must warn them. With a  violent effort, in his agony he turned over in the bunk and thrust out  his hand from the blankets.    \"Hullo! what's this?\" cried Pine, bringing the lantern to bear upon it.  \"Lie down, my man. Eh!--water, is it? There, steady with it now\"; and he  lifted a pannikin to the blackened, froth-fringed lips. The cool draught  moistened his parched gullet, and the convict made a last effort to  speak.    \"Sarah Purfoy--to-night--the prison--MUTINY!\"    The last word, almost shrieked out, in the sufferer's desperate efforts  to articulate, recalled the wandering senses of John Rex. \"Hush!\" he  cried. \"Is that you, Jemmy? Sarah's right. Wait till she gives the  word.\"    \"He's raving,\" said Vickers.    Pine caught the convict by the shoulder. \"What do you say, my man? A  mutiny of the prisoners!\"    With his mouth agape and his hands clenched, Rufus Dawes, incapable of  further speech, made a last effort to nod assent, but his head fell upon  his breast; the next moment, the flickering light, the gloomy prison,  the eager face of the doctor, and the astonished face of Vickers,  vanished from before his straining eyes. He saw the two men stare at  each other, in mingled incredulity and alarm, and then he was floating  down the cool brown river of his boyhood, on his way--in company with  Sarah Purfoy and Lieutenant Frere--to raise the mutiny of the Hydaspes,  that lay on the stocks in the old house at Hampstead.          CHAPTER IX. WOMAN'S WEAPONS.        The two discoverers of this awkward secret held a council of war.  Vickers was for at once calling the guard, and announcing to the  prisoners that the plot--whatev"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34259"],[0,"Hunting Dogs (#14)"],[1,"of run and chase up  and down the full length for hours at a time, then be content and  restful.    By nature dogs are cleanly and will not soil their bed or kennel if  to be avoided. Being shut up in a small place may cause them to be  uncleanly and soil the floor, making it disagreeable, as by rolling  in play all the dogs will constantly present soiled appearance.  However, even in a small kennel this can be regulated as follows:  Thoroughly clean out the place and scrub; in one corner bore some  holes into floor and spread sawdust over this part only; litter the  rest of space with clean straw and besprinkle this with some strong  disinfectant. Turn in the dogs. At once one or more will go to  sawdust portion,--this done the ice is broken and henceforth all the  dogs will use this part only as retiring place, leaving the remainder  perfectly clean.    Teach your hound not to be afraid of water, and to circle the tree  and to keep an eye on the coon and to bark treed, but never allow him  to get whipped by any coon at first as this will discourage him. Not  only this, but the coon may blind him should he strike him in the  eye. It is better always to hold or tie the dog before shooting the  coon, and when he drops to make sure that he cannot fight much more  before allowing the dog near him.        CHAPTER XVI.    AILMENTS OF THE DOG.    Dogs as well as people sometimes fall ill. Proper care and sanitary  lodgings will reduce the danger, but sickness will occasionally  occur, no matter how great the precautions.    Dog owners should therefore acquaint themselves with the commoner  forms of ailment to which dogs are subject and thus be in a position  to quickly administer such relief as is possible, thereby frequently  stopping a sick spell promptly that might otherwise result seriously  if not fatally.    The dog is very similar to man in his ailments as well as in his  susceptibility to drugs. As a general thing medicine that is good for  a human being is good for a dog under similar circumstances. \"While  no definite rule can be laid down\" says an eminent authority, \"it may  be said that a dose suitable for an adult person is correct for the  largest dogs, such as St. Bernards; for dogs from forty to fifty  pounds the dose should correspond with that given to a child twelve  to fourteen years of age, and so on down.\"    Few veterinarians make a study of the dog, and they rarely are of any  use when called. However, those who have made a special study may be  consulted with advantage and saving.    We have not the space here to go into an exhaustive recitation of dog  diseases, symptoms, treatment and remedies. If you are at a loss  concerning your dog, write to one of the Dog Doctors, whose  advertisements appear in sporting magazines, and he can no doubt  diagnose the case and forward the medicine you require at a minimum  cost. In nearly all cases he will forward you a free booklet  describing the prevalent diseases and his remedies applicable to  same.    The following from the pen of H. Clay Glover, V. S., will no doubt  give many readers some light on one of the common afflictions that  prove so troublesome.    INDIGESTION IN DOGS.    Eczema is a frequent symptom, and let me state right here that I find  more cases of eczematous eruptions arising from a disordered  condition of the digestion than any other cause. Doubtless many who  will read this will recognize the fact that at some time some certain  dog has had some obstinate skin trouble, all kinds of which are by  the layman diagnosed as \"mange\", and that, after trying various mange  cures to which the trouble has not yielded, the blood has been  treated with no better results.    To any one who have, or may have in the future, indigestion cases,  let me advise the following treatment, viz.: Feed rather sparingly  three times a day on raw or scraped beef, this being the most readily  accepted and most easily digested of all foods when the digestion is  disordered, allowing no other diet, and giving immediately after each  meal one of the digestive pills. Add to the drinking water lime water  in the proportion of one to thirty.    By following this treatment as laid down, many cases of eczema will  disappear. Some probably, may be accelerated by the use of a skin  lotion in conjunction. Eczema in these cases is merely a symptom  appearing in evidence of disordered digestion. Indigestion may be  considered as a mild form of gastritis, which if not corrected, will  be followed by true gastritis, the stomach then being in such  condition that nothing is retained, even water being returned  immediately after drinking. This will be accompanied by fever, colic,  emaciation and only too often followed by death.    DISTEMPER.    We quote further from Dr. Glover's booklet, some practical  information on another of the more common dog ailments:    The term distemper is particularly applied to animals of the brute  creation; to the dog when afflicted with that disease somewhat  resembling typhus fever in the human race. We have now become quite  familiar with the nature of the disease and the remedies indicated;  consequently the loss by death is comparatively small when proper  treatment and attention are employed. In early days, those dogs that  were fortunate enough to survive this disease did so merely through  strength of constitution and not from the assistance of any remedial  agent, as utter ignorance of the subject then prevailed. The disease  doubtless then appeared in a much milder form than that with which  our present highly bred animals are afflicted.    Owing to more or less inbreeding that has been indulged in to  intensify certain forms and characteristics in dogs of most all  breeds, constitution has to some extent been sacrificed. Animals bred  in this way are in consequence less able to resist or combat disease  than those with less pretentious claims to family distinction.    CAUSES--Bad sanitary conditions, crowded or poorly drained kennels,  exposure to dampness, insufficient or over feeding, improper diet,  lack of fresh air and exercise, all conduce to the development of  distemper. It is contagious, infectious, and will frequently appear  spontaneously without any apparent cause in certain localities,  assuming an epidemic form. Age is no exemption from distemper, though  it more frequently attacks young animals than adults. Very few dogs  pass through life without having it at some period.    SYMPTOMS--In early stages, dullness, loss of appetite, sneezing,  chills, fever, undue moisture of the nose, congestion of the eyes,  nausea, a gagging cough accompanied by the act of vomition, though  rarely anything is voided (if anything, it will be a little mucous),  thirst, a desire to lie in a warm place, and rapid emaciation. This  is quickly followed by mucopurulent discharge from the eyes and nose;  later, perhaps, ulceration of either eyes or eyelids. Labored  respiration, constipation or obstinate diarrhoea, usually the latter,  which frequently runs into inflammation of the bowels.    In some cases many of the above symptoms will be absent, the bowels  being the first parts attacked. The following, which sometimes, but  not necessarily, occur with distemper, I classify as complications,  viz.: Fits, Chorea, Paralysis, Pneumonia or Bronco-Pneumonia,  Jaundice, and Inflammation of the Bowels, and will require treatment  independent of any one remedy that may be given.    TREATMENT--The animal should be placed in warm, dry quarters, and  hygienic conditions strictly observed. With puppies, at the start  give vermifuge, as nearly all have worms which add greatly to the  irritation of stomach, bowels and nervous system.    The bedding should be changed daily and the apartment disinfected  twice a week.    Feed frequently on easily digested, nutritious diet, such as beef tea  or mutton broth, thickened with rice. Let all food be slightly cool,  and keep fresh cold water at all times within reach of the animal. If  constipation be present give warm water and glycerine enemas, and an  occasional dose of castor oil if necessary. Should the bowels become  too much relaxed with any tendency to inflammation, feed entirely  upon food, such as arrowroot, farina or corn starch with well boiled  milk, as even beef tea is somewhat of an irritation to the stomach  and bowels.    In the treatment of distemper, one great object is to keep up the  general strength, so in case of extreme debility a little whisky in  milk or milk punches may be allowed.    If your efforts are not successful and you are in danger of losing  one or more good dogs, write a specialist. It would require fifty  pages of this book to go into the subject fully.    RHEUMATISM.    Acute rheumatism in the dog is similar to that in the human body,  effecting the joints. Muscular rheumatism settles in the muscles. If  given early 5 to 15 grains, twice a day, of salicate of sodium is a  most excellent preventative measure. A severe case demands more  elaborate care.    RICKETS.    Those accustomed to dogs have seen cases of rickets. It is a  constitutional or inherited affliction, and attacks puppies most  frequently. Nothing can be done save kill the sufferer if the attack  is severe, or build up the health generally, toward outgrowing the  trouble, if mild.    These are only a few of the ailments the faithful dog is heir to; yet  in a general way, a healthy dog is no more subject to disease than a  healthy person, and in many cases the old family watch dog will pass  a long and useful life with no more serious trouble than he can  readily cope with, with the assistance of nature.    We add some practical advice from Mr. Amer Braley of Dade Co.,  Florida, as to what will cure canker in the ears of dogs, a prevalent  and aggravating trouble: Will say I have cured cases of it of long  standing by working boracic acid well into their ears, usually a few  applications does the work."]]]
