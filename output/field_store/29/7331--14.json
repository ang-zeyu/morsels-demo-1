Old One, I could sit and keep state in the  House of the Hasturs, and even death could not touch me until I grew  weary of living! But I preferred to learn new lives from new men. The  Terrans have something to teach even the Hasturs, and they can learn a  remedy against the trailmen's fever.\" He looked round at me, turning the  discussion over to me again, and I said:    \"I am no alien from another world, Old One. I have been a son in your  house. Perhaps I was sent to teach you to fight destiny. I cannot  believe you are indifferent to death.\"    Suddenly, hardly knowing what I was going to do until I found myself on  my knees, I knelt and looked up into the quiet stern remote face of the  nonhuman:    \"My father,\" I said, \"you took a dying man and a dying child from a  burning plane. Even those of their own kind might have stripped their  corpses and left them to die. You saved the child, fostered him and  treated him as a son. When he reached an age to be unhappy with you, you  let a dozen of your people risk their lives to take him to his own. You  cannot ask me to believe that you are indifferent to the death of a  million of my people, when the fate of one could stir your pity!\"           *       *       *       *       *    There was a moment's silence. Finally the Old One said,  \"Indifferent--no. But helpless. My people die when they leave the  mountains. The air is too rich for them. The food is wrong. The light  blinds and tortures them. Can I send them to suffer and die, those  people who call me father?\"    And a memory, buried all my life, suddenly surfaced. I said urgently,  \"Father, listen. In the world I live in now, I am called a wise man. You  need not believe me, but listen; I know your people, they are my people.  I remember when I left you, more than a dozen of my foster-parents'  friends offered, knowing they risked death, to go with me. I was a  child; I did not realize the sacrifice they made. But I watched them  suffer, as we went lower in the mountains, and I resolved ... I resolved  ...\" I spoke with difficulty, forcing the words through a reluctant  barricade, \"... that since others had suffered so for me ... I would  spend my life in curing the sufferings of others. Father, the Terrans  call me a wise doctor, a man of healing. Among the Terrans I can see  that my people, if they will come to us and help us, have air they can  breathe and food which will suit them and that they are guarded from the  light. I don't ask you to send anyone, father. I ask only--tell your  sons what I have told you. If I know your people--who are my people  forever--hundreds of them will offer to return with me. And you may  witness what your foster-son has sworn here; if one of your sons dies,  your alien son will answer for it with his own life.\"    The words had poured from me in a flood. They were not all mine; some  unconscious thing had recalled in me that Jay Allison had power to make  these promises. For the first time I began to see what force, what  guilt, what dedication working in Jay Allison had turned him aside from  me. I remained at the Old One's feet, kneeling, overcome, ashamed of the  thing I had become. Jay Allison was worth ten of me. Irresponsible,  Forth had said. Lacking purpose, lacking balance. What right had I to  despise my soberer self?    At last I felt the Old One touch my head lightly.    \"Get up, my son,\" he said, \"I will answer for my people. And forgive me  for my doubts and my delays.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Neither Regis nor I spoke for a minute after we left the audience room;  then, almost as one, we turned to each other. Regis spoke first,  soberly.    \"It was a fine thing you did, Jason. I didn't believe he'd agree to it.\"    \"It was your speech that did it,\" I denied. The sober mood, the  unaccustomed surge of emotion, was still on me, but it was giving way to  a sudden upswing of exaltation. Damn it, I'd _done_ it! Let Jay Allison  try to match _that_ ...    Regis still looked grave. \"He'd have refused, but you appealed to him as  one of themselves. And yet it wasn't quite that ... it was something  more ...\" Regis put a quick embarrassed arm around my shoulders and  suddenly blurted out, \"I think the Terran Medical played hell with your  life, Jason! And even if it saves a million lives--it's hard to forgive  them for that!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Late the next day the Old One called us in again, and told us that a  hundred men had volunteered to return with us and act as blood donors  and experimental subjects for research into the trailmen's disease.    The trip over the mountains, so painfully accomplished was easier in  return. Our escort of a hundred trailmen guaranteed us against attack,  and they could choose the easiest paths.    Only as we undertook the long climb downward through the foothills did  the trailmen, un-used to ground travel at any time, and suffering from  the unaccustomed low altitude, begin to weaken. As we grew stronger,  more and more of them faltered, and we travelled more and more slowly.  Not even Kendricks could be callous about \"inhuman animals\" by the time  we reached the point where we had left the pack animals. And it was Rafe  Scott who came to me and said desperately, \"Jason, these poor fellows  will never make it to Carthon. Lerrys and I know this country. Let us go  ahead, as fast as we can travel alone, and arrange at Carthon for  transit--maybe we can get pressurized aircraft to fly them from here. We  can send a message from Carthon, too, about accommodations for them at  the Terran HQ.\"    I was surprised and a little guilty that I had not thought of this  myself. I covered it with a mocking, \"I thought you didn't give a damn  about 'any of my friends.'\"    Rafe said doggedly, \"I guess I was wrong about that. They're going  through this out of a sense of duty, so they must be pretty different  than I thought they were.\"    Regis, who had overheard Rafe's plan, now broke in quietly, \"There's no  need for you to travel ahead, Rafe. I can send a quicker message.\"    I had forgotten that Regis was a trained telepath. He added, \"There are  some space and distance limitations to such messages, but there is a  regular relay net all over Darkover, and one of the relays is a girl who  lives at the very edge of the Terran Zone. _If_ you'll tell me what will  give her access to the Terran HQ--\" he flushed slightly and explained,  \"from what I know of the Terrans, she would not be very fortunate  relaying the message if she merely walked to the gate and said she had a  relayed telepathic message for someone, would she?\"    I had to smile at the picture that conjured up in my mind. \"I'm afraid  not,\" I admitted. \"Tell her to go to Dr. Forth, and give the message  from Dr. Jason Allison.\"    Regis looked at me curiously--it was the first time I had spoken my own  name in the hearing of the others. But he nodded, without comment. For  the next hour or two he seemed somewhat more pre-occupied than usual,  but after a time he came to me and told me that the message had gone  through. Sometime later he relayed an answer; that airlift would be  waiting for us, not at Carthon, but a small village near the ford of the  Kadarin where we had left our trucks.    When we camped that night there were a dozen practical problems needing  attention; the time and exact place of crossing the ford, the  reassurance to be given to terrified trailmen who could face leaving  their forests but not crossing the final barricade of the river, the  small help in our power to be given the sick ones. But after everything  had been done that I could do, and after the whole camp had quieted  down, I sat before the low-burning fire and stared into it, deep in  painful lassitude. Tomorrow we would cross the river and a few hours  later we would be back in the Terran HQ. And then....    And then ... and then nothing. I would vanish, I would utterly cease to  exist anywhere, except as a vagrant ghost troubling Jay Allison's  unquiet dreams. As he moved through the cold round of his days I would  be no more than a spent wind, a burst bubble, a thinned cloud.    The rose and saffron of the dying fire-colors gave shape to my dreams.  Once more, as in the trailcity that night, Kyla slipped through  firelight to my side, and I looked up at her and suddenly I knew I could  not bear it. I pulled her to me and muttered, \"Oh, Kyla--Kyla, I won't  even remember you!\"    She pushed my hands away, kneeling upright, and said urgently, \"Jason,  listen. We are close to Carthon, the others can lead them the rest of  the way. Why go back to them at all? Slip away now and never go back! We  can--\" she stopped, coloring fiercely, that sudden and terrifying  shyness overcoming her again, and at last she said in a whisper,  \"Darkover is a wide world, Jason. Big enough for us to hide in. I don't  believe they would search very far.\"    They wouldn't. I could leave word with Kendricks--not with Regis, the  telepath would see through me immediately--that I had ridden ahead to  Carthon, with Kyla. By the time they realized that I had fled, they  would be too concerned with getting the trailmen safely to the Terran  Zone to spend much time looking for a runaway. As Kyla said, the world  was wide. And it was my world. And I would not be alone in it.    \"Kyla, Kyla,\" I said helplessly, and crushed her against me, kissing  her. She closed her eyes and I took a long, long look at her face. Not  beautiful, no. But womanly and brave and all the other beautiful things.  It was a farewell look, and I knew it, if she didn't.    After the briefest time, she pulled a little away, and her flat voice  was gentler and more breathless than usual. \"We'd better leave before  the others waken.\" She saw that I did not move. \"Jason--?\"    I could not look at her. Muffled behind my hands, I said, \"No, Kyla.

The common bees will never use their sting upon the queen; if she is  to be disposed of they starve her to death; and the queen herself will  sting nothing but royalty--nothing but a rival queen.    The queen, I say, is the mother bee; it is undoubtedly complimenting her  to call her a queen and invest her with regal authority, yet she is  a superb creature, and looks every inch a queen. It is an event to  distinguish her amid the mass of bees when the swarm alights; it awakens  a thrill. Before you have seen a queen you wonder if this or that bee,  which seems a little larger than its fellows, is not she, but when you  once really set eyes upon her you do not doubt for a moment. You  know that is the queen. That long, elegant, shining, feminine-looking  creature can be none less than royalty. How beautifully her body tapers,  how distinguished she looks, how deliberate her movements! The bees  do not fall down before her, but caress her and touch her person.  The drones or males, are large bees too, but coarse, blunt,  broad-shouldered, masculine-looking. There is but one fact or incident  in the life of the queen that looks imperial and authoritative: Huber  relates that when the old queen is restrained in her movements by the  workers, and prevented from destroying the young queens in their cells,  she assumes a peculiar attitude and utters a note that strikes every bee  motionless, and makes every head bow; while this sound lasts not a bee  stirs, but all look abashed and humbled, yet whether the emotion is one  of fear, or reverence, or of sympathy with the distress of the queen  mother, is hard to determine. The moment it ceases and she advances  again toward the royal cells, the bees bite and pull and insult her as  before.    I always feel that I have missed some good fortune if I am away from  home when my bees swarm. What a delightful summer sound it is; how  they come pouring out of the hive, twenty or thirty thousand bees each  striving to get out first; it is as when the dam gives way and lets the  waters loose; it is a flood of bees which breaks upward into the air,  and becomes a maze of whirling black lines to the eye and a soft chorus  of myriad musical sounds to the ear. This way and that way they drift,  now contracting, now expanding, rising, sinking, growing thick about  some branch or bush, then dispersing and massing at some other point,  till finally they begin to alight in earnest, when in a few moments the  whole swarm is collected upon the branch, forming a bunch perhaps as  large as a two-gallon measure. Here they will hang from one to three or  four hours, or until a suitable tree in the woods is looked up, when, if  they have not been offered a hive in the mean time, they are up and  off. In hiving them, if any accident happens to the queen the enterprise  miscarries at once. One day I shook a swarm from a small pear-tree into  a tin pan, set the pan down on a shawl spread beneath the tree, and put  the hive over it. The bees presently all crawled up into it, and all  seemed to go well for ten or fifteen minutes, when I observed that  something was wrong; the bees began to buzz excitedly and to rush about  in a bewildered manner, then they took to the wing and all returned to  the parent stock. On lifting up the pan, I found beneath it the queen  with three or four other bees. She had been one of the first to fall,  had missed the pan in her descent, and I had set it upon her. I conveyed  her tenderly back to the hive, but either the accident terminated  fatally with her or else the young queen had been liberated in the  interim, and one of them had fallen in combat, for it was ten days  before the swarm issued a second time.    No one, to my knowledge, has ever seen the bees house-hunting in the  woods. Yet there can be no doubt that they look up new quarters either  before or on the day the swarm issues. For all bees are wild bees and  incapable of domestication; that is, the instinct to go back to nature  and take up again their wild abodes in the trees is never eradicated.  Years upon years of life in the apiary seems to have no appreciable  effect towards their final, permanent domestication. That every new  swarm contemplates migrating to the woods, seems confirmed by the fact  that they will only come out when the weather is favorable to such an  enterprise, and that a passing cloud or a sudden wind, after the bees  are in the air, will usually drive them back into the parent hive. Or  an attack upon them with sand or gravel, or loose earth or water, will  quickly cause them to change their plans. I would not even say but  that, when the bees are going off, the apparently absurd practice, now  entirely discredited by regular bee-keepers but still resorted to by  unscientific folk, of beating upon tin pans, blowing horns, and creating  an uproar generally, might not be without good results. Certainly not by  drowning the \"orders\" of the queen, but by impressing the bees as  with some unusual commotion in nature. Bees are easily alarmed and  disconcerted, and I have known runaway swarms to be brought down by a  farmer ploughing in the field who showered them with handfuls of loose  soil.    I love to see a swarm go off--if it is not mine, and if mine must go I  want to be on hand to see the fun. It is a return to first principles  again by a very direct route. The past season I witnessed two such  escapes. One swarm had come out the day before, and, without alighting,  had returned to the parent hive--some hitch in the plan, perhaps, or may  be the queen had found her wings too weak. The next day they came out  again, and were hived. But something offended them, or else the tree in  the woods--perhaps some royal old maple or birch holding its head  high above all others, with snug, spacious, irregular chambers and  galleries--had too many attractions; for they were presently discovered  filling the air over the garden, and whirling excitedly around.  Gradually they began to drift over the street; a moment more, and they  had become separated from the other bees, and, drawing together in a  more compact mass or cloud, away they went, a humming, flying vortex of  bees, the queen in the centre, and the swarm revolving around her as a  pivot,--over meadows, across creeks and swamps, straight for the heart  of the mountain, about a mile distant,--slow at first, so that the youth  who gave chase kept up with them, but increasing their speed till only a  fox hound could have kept them in sight. I saw their pursuer laboring  up the side of the mountain; saw his white shirt-sleeves gleam as he  entered the woods; but he returned a few hours afterward without any  clew as to the particular tree in which they had taken refuge out of the  ten thousand that covered the side of the mountain.    The other swarm came out about one o'clock of a hot July day, and  at once showed symptoms that alarmed the keeper, who, however, threw  neither dirt nor water. The house was situated on a steep side-hill.  Behind it the ground rose, for a hundred rods or so, at an angle of  nearly forty-five degrees, and the prospect of having to chase them up  this hill, if chase them we should, promised a good trial of wind  at least; for it soon became evident that their course lay in this  direction. Determined to have a hand, or rather a foot, in the chase,  I threw off my coat and hurried on, before the swarm was yet fairly  organized and under way. The route soon led me into a field of  standing rye, every spear of which held its head above my own. Plunging  recklessly forward, my course marked to those watching from below by the  agitated and wriggling grain, I emerged from the miniature forest just  in time to see the runaways disappearing over the top of the hill, some  fifty rods in advance of me. Lining them as well as I could, I soon  reached the hill-top, my breath utterly gone and the perspiration  streaming from every pore of my skin. On the other side the country  opened deep and wide. A large valley swept around to the north, heavily  wooded at its head and on its sides. It became evident at once that the  bees had made good their escape, and that whether they had stopped on  one side of the valley or the other, or had indeed cleared the opposite  mountain and gone into some unknown forest beyond, was entirely  problematical. I turned back, therefore, thinking of the honey-laden  tree that some of these forests would hold before the falling of the  leaf.    I heard of a youth in the neighborhood, more lucky than myself on a like  occasion. It seems that he had got well in advance of the swarm, whose  route lay over a hill, as in my case, and as he neared the summit, hat  in hand, the bees had just come up and were all about him. Presently he  noticed them hovering about his straw hat, and alighting on his arm; and  in almost as brief a time as it takes to relate it, the whole swarm  had followed the queen into his hat. Being near a stone wall, he  coolly deposited his prize upon it, quickly disengaged himself from the  accommodating bees, and returned for a hive. The explanation of this  singular circumstance no doubt is, that the queen, unused to such long  and heavy flights, was obliged to alight from very exhaustion. It is  not very unusual for swarms to be thus found in remote fields, collected  upon a bush or branch of a tree.    When a swarm migrates to the woods in this manner, the individual bees,  as I have intimated, do not move in right lines or straight forward,  like a flock of birds, but round and round, like chaff in a whirlwind.  Unitedly they form a humming, revolving, nebulous mass, ten or fifteen  feet across, which keeps just high enough to clear all obstacles, except  in crossing deep valleys, when, of course, it may be very high. The  swarm seems to be guided by a line of couriers, which may be seen (at"]]]
