I have always felt repelled by him; but he is the intimate  friend of M. Lagors.\"    While Sigault was writing down these answers, M. Patrigent was racking  his brain to imagine what could have occurred between M. Bertomy and his  son, to cause this transformation in Prosper.    \"One more thing,\" said the judge: \"how did you spend the evening, the  night before the crime?\"    \"When I left my office, at five o'clock, I took the St.-Germain train,  and went to Vesinet, M. de Lagors's country seat, to carry him fifteen  hundred francs which he had asked for; and, finding him not at home, I  left it with his servant.\"    \"Did he tell you that M. de Lagors was going away?\"    \"No, monsieur. I did not know that he had left Paris.\"    \"Where did you go when you left Vesinet?\"    \"I returned to Paris, and dined at a restaurant with a friend.\"    \"And then?\"    Prosper hesitated.    \"You are silent,\" said M. Patrigent; \"then I shall tell you how you  employed your time. You returned to your rooms in the Rue Chaptal,  dressed yourself, and attended a _soiree_ given by one of those women  who style themselves dramatic artistes, and who are a disgrace to  the stage; who receive a hundred crowns a year, and yet keep their  carriages, at Mlle. Wilson's.\"    \"You are right, monsieur.\"    \"There is heavy playing at Wilson's?\"    \"Sometimes.\"    \"You are in the habit of visiting places of this sort. Were you not  connected in some way with a scandalous adventure which took place at  the house of a woman named Crescenzi?\"    \"I was summoned to testify, having witnessed a theft.\"    \"Gambling generally leads to stealing. And did you not play baccarat at  Wilson's, and lose eighteen hundred francs?\"    \"Excuse me, monsieur, only eleven hundred.\"    \"Very well. In the morning you paid a note of a thousand francs.\"    \"Yes, monsieur.\"    \"Moreover, there remained in your desk five hundred francs, and you had  four hundred in your purse when you were arrested. So that altogether,  in twenty-four hours, four thousand five hundred francs--\"    Prosper was not discountenanced, but stupefied.    Not being aware of the powerful means of investigation possessed by the  law, he wondered how in so short a time the judge could have obtained  such accurate information.    \"Your statement is correct, monsieur,\" he said finally.    \"Where did all this money come from? The evening before you had so  little that you were obliged to defer the payment of a small bill.\"    \"The day to which you allude, I sold through an agent some bonds I had,  about three thousand francs; besides, I took from the safe two thousand  francs in advance on my salary.\"    The prisoner had given clear answers to all the questions put to him,  and M. Patrigent thought he would attack him on a new point.    \"You say you have no wish to conceal any of your actions; then why did  you write this note to one of your companions?\" Here he held up the  mysterious note.    This time the blow struck. Prosper's eyes dropped before the inquiring  look of the judge.    \"I thought,\" he stammered, \"I wished--\"    \"You wished to screen this woman?\"    \"Yes, monsieur; I did. I knew that a man in my condition, accused of  a robbery, has every fault, every weakness he has ever indulged in,  charged against him as a great crime.\"    \"Which means that you knew that the presence of a woman at your house  would tell very much against you, and that justice would not excuse this  scandalous defiance of public morality. A man who respects himself so  little as to associate with a worthless woman, does not elevate her to  his standard, but he descends to her base level.\"    \"Monsieur!\"    \"I suppose you know who the woman is, whom you permit to bear the honest  name borne by your mother?\"    \"Mme. Gypsy was a governess when I first knew her. She was born at  Oporto, and came to France with a Portuguese family.\"    \"Her name is not Gypsy; she has never been a governess, and she is not a  Portuguese.\"    Prosper began to protest against this statement; but M. Patrigent  shrugged his shoulders, and began looking over a large file of papers on  his desk.    \"Ah, here it is,\" he said, \"listen: Palmyre Chocareille, born at Paris  in 1840, daughter of James Chocareille, undertaker's assistant, and of  Caroline Piedlent, his wife.\"    Prosper looked vexed and impatient; he did not know that the judge was  reading him this report to convince him that nothing can escape the  police.    \"Palmyre Chocareille,\" he continued, \"at twelve years of age was  apprenticed to a shoemaker, and remained with him until she was sixteen.  Traces of her for one year are lost. At the age of seventeen she is  hired as a servant by a grocer on the Rue St. Denis, named Dombas, and  remains there three months. She lives out during this same year,  1857, at eight different places. In 1858 she entered the store of a  fan-merchant in Choiseul Alley.\"    As he read, the judge watched Prosper's face to observe the effect of  these revelations.    \"Toward the close of 1858 she was employed as a servant by Madame Munes,  and accompanied her to Lisbon. How long she remained in Lisbon, and  what she did while she remained there, is not reported. But in 1861 she  returned to Paris, and was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for  assault and battery. Ah, she returned from Portugal with the name of  Nina Gypsy.\"    \"But I assure you, monsieur,\" Prosper began.    \"Yes, I understand; this history is less romantic, doubtless, than the  one related to you; but then it has the merit of being true. We lose  sight of Palmyre Chocareille, called Gypsy, upon her release from  prison, but we meet her again six months later, having made the  acquaintance of a travelling agent named Caldas, who became infatuated  with her beauty, and furnished her a house near the Bastille. She  assumed his name for some time, then she deserted him to devote herself  to you. Did you ever hear of this Caldas?\"    \"Never, monsieur.\"    \"This foolish man so deeply loved this creature that her desertion drove  him almost insane from grief. He was a very resolute man, and publicly  swore that he would kill his rival if he ever found him. The current  report afterward was, that he committed suicide. He certainly sold  the furniture of the House occupied by Chocareille, and suddenly  disappeared. All the efforts made to discover him proved fruitless.\"    The judge stopped a moment as if to give Prosper time for reflection,  and then slowly said:    \"And this is the woman whom you made your companion, the woman for whom  you robbed the bank!\"    Once more M. Patrigent was on the wrong track, owing to Fanferlot's  incomplete information.    He had hoped that Prosper would betray himself by uttering some  passionate retort when thus wounded to the quick; but he remained  impassible. Of all the judge said to him his mind dwelt upon only one  word--Caldas, the name of the poor travelling agent who had killed  himself.    \"At any rate,\" insisted M. Patrigent, \"you will confess that this girl  has caused your ruin.\"    \"I cannot confess that, monsieur, for it is not true.\"    \"Yet she is the occasion of your extravagance. Listen.\" The judge here  drew a bill from the file of papers. \"During December you paid her  dressmaker, Van Klopen, for two walking dresses, nine hundred francs;  one evening dress, seven hundred francs; one domino, trimmed with lace,  four hundred francs.\"    \"I spent this money cheerfully, but nevertheless I was not especially  attached to her.\"    M. Patrigent shrugged his shoulders.    \"You cannot deny the evidence,\" said he. \"I suppose you will also say  that it was not for this girl's sake you ceased spending your evenings  at M. Fauvel's?\"    \"I swear that she was not the cause of my ceasing to visit M. Fauvel's  family.\"    \"Then why did you cease, suddenly, your attentions to a young lady whom  you confidently expected to marry, and whose hand you had written to  your father to demand for you?\"    \"I had reasons which I cannot reveal,\" answered Prosper with emotion.    The judge breathed freely; at last he had discovered a vulnerable point  in the prisoner's armor.    \"Did Mlle. Madeleine banish you?\"    Prosper was silent, and seemed agitated.    \"Speak,\" said M. Patrigent; \"I must tell you that this circumstance is  one of the most important in your case.\"    \"Whatever the cost may be, on this subject I am compelled to keep  silence.\"    \"Beware of what you do; justice will not be satisfied with scruples of  conscience.\"    M. Patrigent waited for an answer. None came.    \"You persist in your obstinacy, do you? Well, we will go on to the next  question. You have, during the last year, spent fifty thousand francs.  Your resources are at an end, and your credit is exhausted; to continue  your mode of life was impossible. What did you intend to do?\"    \"I had no settled plan. I thought it might last as long as it would, and  then I----\"    \"And then you would draw from the safe!\"    \"Ah, monsieur, if I were guilty, I should not be here! I should never  have been such a fool as to return to the bank; I should have fled.\"    M. Patrigent could not restrain a smile of satisfaction, and exclaimed:    \"Exactly the argument I expected you to use. You showed your shrewdness  precisely by staying to face the storm, instead of flying the country.  Several recent suits have taught dishonest cashiers that flight abroad  is dangerous. Railways travel fast, but telegrams travel faster. A  French thief can be arrested in London within forty-eight hours after  his description has been telegraphed. Even America is no longer a  refuge. You remained prudently and wisely, saying to yourself, 'I will  manage to avoid suspicion; and, even if I am found out, I shall be free  again after three or five years'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38032"],[0,"Game Birds and Game Fishes of the Pacific Coast (#14)"],[1," the dull gray of  the breast is a narrow white stripe, or collar. This some times is  very faint, and, in fact, some times, though very rarely, absent. This  absence of the collar is quite likely caused by its inter-grading with  the Hutchins goose.    =Nest and Eggs=--The same as the Canada goose.    =Measurements=--Wing, never more than 16 inches; bill, not more  than 1-1/4 inches.      THE HUTCHINS GOOSE    (Branta canadensis hutchinsii)    We have on the Pacific Coast four varieties of the =Branta  canadensis=, or that species to which belongs the Canada goose, all  resembling each other closely except in size. Two of these species are  generally considered honkers by most of our sportsmen, while others  have two or three local names for them, among which are Mexican goose  and Lower California goose. The fact is that while the Canada goose is  quite common on the coasts of Mexico, neither the Hutchins goose nor  the white-cheeked goose migrate that far south.    The Hutchins goose so closely resembles the Canada goose, or honker as  it is popularly called, that it is principally distinguished by its  smaller size and a considerable difference in the call. The Hutchins  goose ranges as far east as the Mississippi valley, and on the Pacific  Coast south only to about Santa Barbara county, California. This is  one of the two varieties that is given the local names of Mexican and  Lower California goose.    =Color=--Same as the Canada goose, from which it is only distinguished  by its smaller size and a considerable difference in its call.    =Nest and Eggs=--Same as the Canada goose.    =Measurements=--Wing, not more than 17 inches; bill, 1-1/2 inches.      THE CACKLING GOOSE, OR BROWN BRANT    (Branta canadensis minima)    The cackling goose, known also as brown brant and gray brant, is the  most common of the four varieties and much the smallest. (See  illustration.) Its markings are the same as the Canada goose, but its  under parts are somewhat darker. While in total length it is fully  half that of the honker, in weight it is not more than one-third. The  cackling geese are commonly found in flocks of the white geese, both  in their feeding and their migrations. This species ranges east as far  as the Mississippi valley and south on the Coast as far as the mouth  of the Colorado river and to some extent into Lower California. It is  more numerous than any other of the dark colored geese of the Pacific  Coast.    =Color=--The same as the Canada goose, with the exception that it is a  little darker on the under parts.    =Nest and Eggs=--The same as the Canada goose, but the eggs number as  high as ten.    =Measurements=--Wing, 13 to 14-1/2 inches; bill, from one to one and  one-eighth.        [Illustration: LESSER SNOW GOOSE     ROSS GOOSE                   (Chen hyperborea)     (Chen rossi)]      THE SNOW GOOSE, OR WHITE GOOSE    (Chen hyperborea)    The lesser snow geese, commonly called white geese, are the larger of  the two species of white geese so numerous on the Coast. They not only  feed, but migrate in great flocks, and these migrations often take  place at night when their sharp cries will be heard high in the air.  The lesser snow goose is found as far east as the Mississippi valley  and south on the Pacific Coast to San Diego. Occasionally a few are  seen at Ensenada and the valley of the Palms in Lower California. The  meat is tough and poor in flavor and, therefore, they are hunted but  little except by the market hunters, who, somehow, succeed in selling  a good number of them to the uninitiated.    =Color=--Pure white, with black bill and legs; the primaries, or long  feathers of the wings, are black.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nests are made close to the water's edge and  contain about ten dirty white eggs.    =Measurements=--Wing, about 16 inches; bill, 2-1/4 inches.      THE ROSS GOOSE LITTLE WHITE GOOSE    (Chen rossii)    The Ross goose has been given the name of China goose by many who  wanted some distinguishing nomenclature for them, when in fact the  Ross goose is purely an American Pacific Coast bird. Like the snow  goose it is pure white with black primary plumes. Young birds of both  species are occasionally seen in the early part of the season more or  less mottled on the breast with yellowish gray feathers. The Ross  goose is only about half the size of the snow goose. Aside from this  it can always be known by the warty appearance of the upper half of  the bill. They are commonly seen, both in feeding and in their  migrations, mixed in the flocks of the snow geese. Occasionally they  are seen as far east as Utah and Montana, but only in small numbers.  The Ross goose migrates as far south as Central Mexico, great numbers  of them congregating on Lake Chapala, in the state of Jalisco.    =Color=--Same as the snow goose.    =Measurements=--Wing, about 14 inches; bill, 2-1/4, with warty  excresences on the upper part.        [Illustration: WHITE-FRONTED GOOSE, OR SPECKLE-BREAST                  (Anser albifrons gambeli)]      WHITE FRONTED GOOSE    (Anser albifrons gambeli)    The white-fronted goose, or speckle-breast as it is commonly called,  is quite common on the Coast south to Mexico, where great numbers  congregate on Lake Chapala, Jalisco. This is another western species,  though ranging to some extent as far east as the Mississippi valley  and an occasional flock wanders even to the Atlantic coast. The  breasts of the old birds are commonly profusely speckled with black  feathers. The white-fronted goose is a little more exclusive in its  habits than any of the others named, being generally found in flocks  by themselves. As a table bird the meat is quite palatable, and large  numbers are sold in the markets.    =Color=--Head, grayish brown, with a white spot at the junction of the  bill, but this is absent from the young birds; neck, lighter, shading  into white or dull white on the breast, mottled with black; back, ashy  gray, edged with brown; shafts of the quills, white; bill and legs,  light pink.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is usually well made and lined with feathers  and down. The eggs number about seven or eight, and are of a pale  greenish white.    =Measurements=--Wing, 16 inches; bill, 2 inches.        [Illustration: EMPEROR GOOSE (Philacte canagica)]      THE EMPEROR GOOSE    (Philacte canagica)    The Emperor goose is a north Pacific species, breeding principally on  the islands of the Alaska coast. The great majority of these birds  winter well to the north of us, though a number venture southward into  California to Humboldt bay and even south of that. A small flock or  two is seen almost every winter on the marshes near San Francisco. A  close watch of the markets will reveal one or two offered for sale  almost every winter.    =Color=--Head and back of neck, white; throat, brownish gray, shading  into light gray on the breast and abdomen; back, a little darker; the  feathers being gray, tipped with lighter gray, with a subterminal band  of brownish gray; legs, flesh color.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nests are usually found on the small islands of  the salt marshes, and contain eight to ten eggs of a dull white color.    =Measurements=--Wing, about 15-1/2 inches; bill, 1-1/2 inches.        [Illustration: BLACK SEA BRANT (Branta nigricans)]      THE BLACK SEA BRANT    (Branta nigricans)    The black sea brant is another purely Pacific Coast species, found  nowhere else except as a straggler. They resemble the barnacle brant  of the Atlantic (=Branta barnicla=) except in the shape of the head  and bill. A differing characteristic, however, is that the white  speckling on the sides of the neck of the barnacle brant extends all  around the front of the neck in the case of the black sea brant. As  their name implies, these are purely seabirds, rarely flying over the  land even, and only found in such bays as produce the eel grass on  which they feed almost exclusively. I only know of the following  places within the Pacific Coast shooting grounds where the black sea  brant is found. These are: Puget sound, Washington; Coos bay, Oregon;  Humboldt, Tomales, Moro and San Diego bays, California, and Magdalena  bay, Lower California. In most of these places they ate plentiful  during the winter season. Of all birds that fall to the aim of the  sportsman, the black sea brant is the most difficult to get within  range of. This is only accomplished by great caution and a good deal  of strategy, but when they are brought to bag the reward is a full  compensation, for of all the waterfowl their flesh is the most  delicious. The sea brant is rarely found away from the haunts  mentioned, yet the bird from which the accompanying illustration was  made was killed from a small flock that had strayed into the lower end  of San Francisco bay, near Redwood City, and was mounted by that  accomplished sportsman and taxidermist, Chase Littlejohn, of that  place.    =Color=--General color, black; throat, with a white or speckled ring  all around the neck, except a small portion of the back; flanks,  mottled white and black; under tail feathers, white.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is only a depression on the ground, but  nicely lined with down. The eggs, numbering six to eight, are of a  dull white.    =Measurements=--Wing, 13 inches; bill, 1-1/2 inches.      THE SWANS    (Olor columbianus) and (Olor buccinator)    (Subfamily, CYGNINAE)    Both the whistling swan (=Olor columbianus=) and the trumpeter swan  (=Olor buccinator=) were once very plentiful on the Pacific Coast  hunting grounds, as far south as central California, and especially so  on the Columbia river and the lakes of Oregon and Washington. A few  were met with also as far south as San Diego county, California.    I shall never forget the first two swans I ever killed and my  experience with them. It was the first winter after I came to  California and I was living in Los Angeles, then a little Mexican  village, and "]]]
