The cape is distant from the place where the Christians were murdered 150  leagues towards the east, and this cape is 8 deg. from the equinoctial line  to the south. In navigating we saw one day a great multitude of people  on the beach, gazing at the wonderful sight of our ships. As we sailed  we turned the ship towards them, anchored in a good place, and went on  shore with the boats. We found the people to be better conditioned than  those we had met with before, and, responding to our overtures, they  soon made friends, and treated with us. We were five days in this place,  and found _canna fistola_ very thick and green, and dry on the tops of  the trees. We determined to take a pair of men from this place, that  they might teach us their language, and three of them came voluntarily  to go to Portugal.    Lest your Magnificence should be tired of so much writing, you must know  that, on leaving this port, we sailed along on a westerly course, always  in sight of land, continually making many landings, and speaking with  an infinite number of people. We were so far south that we were outside  the Tropic of Capricorn, where the South Pole rises above the horizon  32 deg. We had lost sight altogether of _Ursa Minor_ and _Ursa Major_,  which were far below and scarcely seen on the horizon.[115] We guided  ourselves by the stars of the South Pole, which are numerous and much  larger and brighter than those of our Pole. I traced the figure of the  greater part of those of the first magnitude, with a declaration of their  orbits round the South Pole, and of their diameters and semi-diameters,  as may be seen in my FOUR VOYAGES. We sailed along that coast for 750  leagues, 150 from the cape called _St. Augustine_, to the west, and 600  to the south.    Desiring to recount the things I saw on that coast, and what happened  to us, as many more leaves would not suffice me. On the coast we saw an  infinite number of trees, brazil wood[116] and _cassia_, and those trees  which yield myrrh, as well as other marvels of nature which I am unable  to recount. Having now been ten months on the voyage, and having seen  that there was no mining wealth whatever in that land, we decided upon  taking leave of it, and upon sailing across the sea for some other part.  Having held a consultation, it was decided that the course should be  taken which seemed good to me; and the command of the fleet was entrusted  to me. I gave orders that the fleet should be supplied with wood and  water for six months, such being the decision of the officers of the  ships. Having made our departure from this land, we began our navigation  with a southerly course on the 15th of February, when already the sun  moved towards the equinoctial, and turned towards our Hemisphere of the  North. We sailed so far on this course that we found ourselves where the  South Pole had a height above our horizon of 52 deg. and we could no longer  see the stars of _Ursa Minor_ or of _Ursa Major_. We were then 500 leagues  to the south of the port whence we had departed, and this was on the 3rd  of April. On this day such a tempest arose on the sea that all our sails  were blown away, and we ran under bare poles, with a heavy southerly gale  and a tremendous sea; the air being very tempestuous. The gale was such  that all the people in the fleet were much alarmed. The nights were very  long, for the night we had on the 7th of April lasted fifteen hours,  the sun being at the end of Aries, and in that region it was winter,  as your Magnificence will be well aware. Sailing in this storm, on the  7th of April we came in sight of new land,[117] along which we ran for  nearly 20 leagues, and found it all a rocky coast, without any port or  inhabitants. I believe this was because the cold was so great that no one  in the fleet could endure it. Finding ourselves in such peril, and in such  a storm that we could scarcely see one ship from another, owing to the  greatness of the waves and the blinding mist, it was agreed with the  principal captain that a signal should be made to the ships that they  should make for land, and then shape a course for Portugal. This was  very good counsel, for it is certain that if we had delayed another  night all would have been lost; for, as we wore round on the next day,  we were met by such a storm that we expected to be swamped. We had to  undertake pilgrimages and perform other ceremonies, as is the custom  of sailors at such times. We ran for five days, always coming towards  the equinoctial line, where the air and sea became more temperate. It  pleased God to deliver us from such peril. Our course was now between  the north and north-east, for our intention was to reach the coast of  Ethiopia, our distance from it being 300 leagues, in the Gulf of the  Atlantic Sea. By the grace of God, on the 10th day of May, we came in  sight of land, where we were able to refresh ourselves, the land being  called _La Serra Liona_. We were there fifteen days, and thence shaped  a course to the islands of the _Azores_, which are distant nearly 750  leagues from that _Serra_. We reached the islands in the end of July,  where we remained fifteen days taking some recreation. Thence we departed  for Lisbon, distant 300 leagues to the west, and arrived at that port of  Lisbon on the 7th of September 1502, may God be thanked for our salvation,  with only two ships. We burnt the other at _Serra Liona_, because she  was no longer seaworthy. We were employed on this voyage nearly fifteen  months; and for eleven days we navigated without seeing the North Star,  nor the Great or Little Bears, which they call _el corno_, and we were  guided by the stars of the other Pole. This is what I saw on this voyage.           *       *       *       *       *      _Letter on his Third Voyage from_ AMERIGO VESPUCCI _to_ LORENZO PIETRO  FRANCESCO DI MEDICI.                                                    _March (or April) 1503._    Alberico Vesputio to Lorenzo Pietro di Medici, salutation. In passed  days I wrote very fully to you of my return from the new countries,  which have been found and explored with the ships, at the cost, and by  the command, of this Most Serene King of Portugal; and it is lawful to  call it a new world, because none of these countries were known to our  ancestors, and to all who hear about them they will be entirely new.  For the opinion of the ancients was, that the greater part of the world  beyond the equinoctial line to the south was not land, but only sea,  which they have called the Atlantic; and if they have affirmed that any  continent is there, they have given many reasons for denying that it  is inhabited. But this their opinion is false, and entirely opposed to  the truth. My last voyage has proved it, for I have found a continent  in that southern part; more populous and more full of animals than our  Europe, or Asia, or Africa, and even more temperate and pleasant than any  other region known to us, as will be explained further on. I shall write  succinctly of the principal things only, and the things most worthy of  notice and of being remembered, which I either saw or heard of in this  new world, as presently will become manifest.    We set out, on a prosperous voyage, on the 14th of May[118] 1501,  sailing from Lisbon, by order of the aforesaid King, with three ships,  to discover new countries towards the west; and we sailed towards the  south continuously for twenty months.[119] Of this navigation the order  is as follows: Our course was for the Fortunate Islands, so called  formerly, but now we call them the Grand Canary Islands, which are in  the third climate, and on the confines of the inhabited west. Thence we  sailed rapidly over the ocean along the coast of Africa and part of  Ethiopia to the Ethiopic Promontory, so called by Ptolemy, which is  now called Cape Verde, and by the Ethiopians _Biseghier_, and that  country _Mandraga_, 13 deg. within the Torrid Zone, on the north side of  the equinoctial line. The country is inhabited by a black race. Having  taken on board what we required, we weighed our anchors and made sail,  taking our way across the vast ocean towards the Antarctic Pole, with some  westing. From the day when we left the before-mentioned promontory, we  sailed for the space of two months and three days.[120] Hitherto no land  had appeared to us in that vast sea. In truth, how much we had suffered,  what dangers of shipwreck, I leave to the judgment of those to whom the  experience of such things is very well known. What a thing it is to seek  unknown lands, and how difficult, being ignorant, to narrate briefly what  happened. It should be known that, of the sixty-seven days of our voyage,  we were navigating continuously forty-four. We had copious thunderstorms  and perturbations, and it was so dark that we never could see either the  sun in the day or the moon at night. This caused us great fear, so that  we lost all hope of life. In these most terrible dangers of the sea it  pleased the Most High to show us the continent and the new countries,  being another unknown world. These things being in sight, we were as  much rejoiced as anyone may imagine who, after calamity and ill-fortune,  has obtained safety.    It was on the 7th August[121] 1501, that we reached those countries,  thanking our Lord God with solemn prayers, and celebrating a choral  Mass. We knew that land to be a continent, and not an island, from its  long beaches extending without trending round, the infinite number of  inhabitants, the numerous tribes and peoples, the numerous kinds of wild  animals unknown in our country, and many others never seen before by us,  touching which it would take long to make reference. The clemency of God  was shown forth to us by being brought to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36962"],[0,"My Attainment of the Pole (#14)"],[1,"own estimate of value.    Would we not place ourselves at ease and stay for a day or two, as their  husbands would soon return? We were forced to decline their hospitality,  for without the harbor there was too much wind to keep the schooner  waiting. Eskimos have no salutation except a greeting smile or a parting  look of regret. We got both at the same time as we stepped into the  launch and shouted good-bye.    The captain was told to proceed to Cape Robertson. The wind eased, and a  descending fog soon blotted out part of the landscape, horizon and sky.  It hung like a gray pall a thousand feet above us, leaving the air below  this bright and startlingly clear.          TO THE LIMITS OF NAVIGATION    EXCITING HUNTS FOR GAME WITH THE ESKIMOS--ARRIVAL AT ETAH--SPEEDY  TRIP TO ANNOATOK, THE WINDY PLACE, WHERE SUPPLIES ARE FOUND IN  ABUNDANCE--EVERYTHING AUSPICIOUS FOR DASH TO THE POLE--DETERMINATION  TO ESSAY THE EFFORT--BRADLEY INFORMED--DEBARK FOR THE POLE--THE  YACHT RETURNS    IV    ALONE WITH OUR DESTINY, SEVEN HUNDRED MILES FROM THE POLE      We awoke off Cape Robertson early on August 13, and went ashore before  breakfast. The picturesque coast here rises suddenly to an altitude of  about two thousand feet, and is crowned with a gleaming, silver ice cap.  Large bays, blue glacial walls and prominent headlands give a pleasing  variety. It is much like the coast of all Greenland. On its southern  exposure the eroded Huronian rocks provide shelter for millions of  little auks. They dart incessantly from cliff to sea in a chattering  cloud of wings. Rather rich and grassy verdure offers an oasis for the  Arctic hare, while the blue fox finds life easy here, for he can fill  his winter den with the fat feathered creatures which teem by millions.    The Eskimos profit by the combination, and pitch their camp at the foot  of the cliffs, for the chase on sea is nearly as good here as in other  places, while land creatures literally tumble into the larder.    As we approached the shore, ten men, nine women, thirty-one children and  one hundred and six dogs came out to meet us. I count the children and  dogs for they are equally important in Eskimo economy. The latter are by  far the most important to the average Caucasian in the Arctic.    Only small game had fallen to the Eskimos' lot, and they were eager to  venture out with us after big game. Mr. Bradley gathered a suitable  retinue of native guides, and we were not long in arranging a compact.    Free passage, the good graces of the cook, and a knife each were to be  their pay. A caribou hunt was not sufficiently novel to merit a return  to Olrik's Bay, where intelligent hunting is always rewarded, but it was  hoped we might get a hunt at Kookaan, near the head of Robertson Bay.[4]    Although hunting in the bay was not successful from a practical  standpoint, it afforded exciting pleasure in perilous waters. Even  during these hours of sport, my mind was busy with tentative plans for a  Polar journey. Whenever I aimed my gun at a snorting walrus, or at some  white-winged Arctic bird, I felt a thrill in the thought that upon the  skill of my arms, of my aim, and upon that of the natives we were later  to join, would depend the getting of food sufficient to enable me to  embark upon my dream. Everything I did now began to have some bearing  upon this glorious, intoxicating prospect; it colored my life, day and  night. I realized how easily I might fail even should conditions be  favorable enough to warrant the journey; for this reason, because of the  unwelcome doubt which at times chilled my enthusiasm, I did not yet  confide to Bradley my growing ambition.    Returning to the settlement, we paid our hunting guides, made presents  to the women and children, and set sail for Etah. An offshore breeze  filled the big wings of the canvas. As borne on the back of some great  white bird, we soared northward into a limpid molten sea. From below  came the music of our phonograph, curiously shouting its tunes, classic  and popular, in that grim, golden region of glory and death.    It is curious how ambition sets the brain on fire, and quickens the  heart throbs. As we sped over the magical waters, the wild golden air  electric about me, I believe I felt an ecstasy of desire such as mystics  achieved from fasting and prayer. It was the surge of an ambition which  began to grow mightily within me, which I felt no obstacle could  withstand, and which, later, I believe carried me forward with its wings  of faith when my body well nigh refused to move. We passed Cape  Alexander and entered Smith Sound. We sped by storm-chiselled cliffs,  whereupon the hand of nature had written a history, unintelligible to  humans, as with a pen of iron. The sun was low. Great bergs loomed up in  the radiant distance, and reflecting silver-shimmering halos, seemed to  me as the silver-winged ghosts of those who died in this region and who  were borne alone on the wind and air.    Nature seemed to sing with exultation. Approaching a highland of emerald  green and seal brown, I heard the wild shouting of hawks from the  summit, and from below the shrill chattering of millions of auks with  baby families. And nearer, from the life enraptured waters, the minor  note of softly cooing ducks and mating guillemots. From the interior  land of ice, rising above the low booming of a sapphire glacier moving  majestically to the sea, rang the bark of foxes, the shrill notes of the  ptarmigan, and from an invisible farther distance the raucous wolf howl  of Eskimo dogs.    Before us, at times, would come a burst of spouting spray, and a whale  would rise to the surface of the sea. Nearby, on a floating island of  ice, mother walrus would soothingly murmur to her babies. From invisible  places came the paternal voices of the oogzook, and as we went forward,  seals, white whales and unicorns appeared, speaking perhaps the sign  language of the animal deaf and dumb in the blue submarine.    Occasionally, there was an explosion, when thunder as from a hundred  cannons echoed from cliff to cliff. A berg was shattered to ruins.  Following this would rise the frightened voices of every animal above  water. Now and then, from ultramarine grottoes issued weird, echoing  sounds, and almost continually rising to ringing peals and shuddering  into silence, reiterant, incessant, came nature's bugle-calls--calls of  the wind, of sundering glaciers, of sudden rushes of ice rivers, of  exploding gases and of disintegrating bergs. With those sounds pealing  in our ears clarion-like, we entered the \"Gates of Hades,\" the Polar  gateway, bound for the harbor where the last fringe of the world's  humanity straggles finally up on the globe.    As we entered Foulke Fiord, half a gale came from the sea. We steered  for the settlement of Etah. A tiny settlement it was, for it was  composed of precisely four tents, which for this season, had been  pitched beside a small stream, just inside of the first projecting point  on the north shore. Inside this point there was sheltered water for the  Eskimo's kayaks, and it also made a good harbor for the schooner. It is  possible in favorable seasons to push through Smith Sound, over Kane  Basin, into Kennedy Channel, but the experiment is always at the risk of  the vessel.    So, as there was no special reasons for us to hazard life in making this  attempt, we decided to prepare the schooner here for the return voyage.    These preparations would occupy several days. We determined to spend as  much of this time as possible in sport, since much game abounded in this  region. Before we landed we watched the Eskimos harpoon a white whale.  There were no unexplored spots in this immediate vicinity, as both  Doctor Kane and Doctor Hayes, in the middle of the last century, had  been thoroughly over the ground. The little auks kept us busy for a day  after our arrival, while hares, tumbling like snowballs over  wind-polished, Archaean rocks, gave another day of gun recreation. Far  beyond, along the inland ice, were caribou, but we preferred to confine  our hunting to the seashore. The bay waters were alive with eider-ducks  and guillemots, while, just outside, walruses dared us to venture in  open contest on the wind-swept water.    After satisfying our desire for the hunt, we prepared to start for  Annoatok, twenty-five miles to the northward. This is the northernmost  settlement of the globe, a place beyond which even the hardy Eskimos  attempt nothing but brief hunting excursions, and where, curiously,  money is useless because it has no value.    We decided to go in the motor boat, so the tanks were filled with  gasoline and suitable food and camp equipment were loaded. On the  morning of August 24, we started for Annoatok.    It was a beautiful day. The sun glowed in a sky of Italian blue. A light  air crossed the sea, which glowed dully, like ground glass. Passing  inside of Littleton Island, we searched for relics along Lifeboat Cove.  There the _Polaris_ was stranded in a sinking condition in 1872, with  fourteen men on board. The desolate cliffs of Cape Hatherton were a  midsummer blaze of color and light that contrasted strongly with the  cold blue of the many towering bergs.    As we went swiftly past the series of wind-swept headlands, the sea and  air became alive with seals, walruses and birds. We did little shooting  as we were eagerly bent on reaching Annoatok.    As we passed the sharp rocks of Cairn Point, we saw a cluster of nine  tents on a small bay under Cape Inglefield.    \"Look, look! There is Annoatok!\" cried Tung-we, our native guide.  Looking farther, we saw that the entire channel beyond was blocked with  a jam of ice. Fortunately we were able to take our boat as far as we  desired. A perpendicular cliff served as a pier to which to fasten it.  Here it could rise and fall with the tide, and in little danger from  drifting ice.    Ordinarily, Annoatok is a "]]]
