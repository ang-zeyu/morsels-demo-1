It will thus be seen that a trapper in the North can attend more  deadfalls and snares than one in the South or even in the Central  States. No trapper should have more traps or longer lines than he can  properly attend to. The fur bearing animals are none too numerous  without having them caught and their pelts and fur spoiled before the  arrival of the trapper.        CHAPTER XXII.    WHEN TO TRAP.    The proper season to begin trapping is when cold weather comes. The  old saying that fur is good any month that has an \"r\" in does not  hold good except in the North. Even there September is too early to  begin, yet muskrat and skunk are worth something as well as other  furs. In the spring April is the last month with an \"r.\" In most  sections muskrat, bear, beaver, badger and otter are good all thru  April, but other animals began shedding weeks before.    The rule for trappers to follow is to put off trapping in the fall  until nights are frosty and the ground freezes.    Generally speaking in Canada and the more Northern States trappers  can begin about November 1 and should cease March 1, with the  exception of water animals, bear and badger, which may be trapped a  month later. In the Central and Southern States trappers should not  begin so early and should leave off in the spring from one to four  weeks sooner--depending upon how far South they are located.    At the interior Hudson Bay posts, where their word is law, October 25  is appointed to begin and May 25th to quit hunting and trapping with  the exception of bear, which are considered prime up to June 10.  Remember that the above dates are for the interior or Northern H. B.  Posts, which are located hundreds of miles north of the boundary  between the United States and Canada.    The skunk is the first animal to become prime, then the coon, marten,  fisher, mink and fox, but the latter does not become strictly prime  until after a few days of snow, says an old Maine trapper. Rats and  beaver are late in priming up as well as otter and mink, and tho the  mink is not strictly a land animal, it becomes prime about with the  later land animals. The bear, which is strictly a land animal, is not  in good fur until snow comes and not strictly prime until February or  March.      * * *    With the first frosts and cool days many trappers begin setting and  baiting their traps. That it is easier to catch certain kinds of  fur-bearing animals early in the season is known to most trappers and  for this reason trapping in most localities is done too early in the  season.    Some years ago when trapping was done even earlier than now, we  examined mink skins that were classed as No. 4 and worth 10 or 15  cents, that, had they been allowed to live a few weeks longer, their  hides would have been No. 1 and worth, according to locality, from  $1.50 to $3.50 each. This early trapping is a loss to the trapper if  they will only pause and think. There are only so many animals in a  locality to be caught each winter and why catch them before their fur  is prime?    In the latitude of Southern Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, etc., skunk  caught in the month of October are graded back from one to three  grades (and even sometimes into trash), where if they were not caught  until November 15th how different would be the classification. The  same is true of opossum, mink, muskrat, coon, fox, etc.      * * *    Skunk are one of the animals that become prime first each fall. The  date that they become prime depends much on the weather. Fifteen  years ago, when trapping in Southern Ohio, the writer has sold skunk  at winter prices caught as early as October 16, while other seasons  those caught the 7th of November, or three weeks later, blued and  were graded back. Am glad to say that years ago I learned not to put  out traps until November.    That the weather has much to do with the priming of furs and pelts  there is no question. If the fall is colder than usual the furs will  become prime sooner, while if the freezing weather is later the pelts  will be later in \"priming up.\"    In the sections where weasel turn white (then called ermine by many),  trappers have a good guide. When they become white they are prime and  so are most other land animals. In fact, some are fairly good a week  or two before.    When a pelt is put on the stretcher and becomes blue in a few days it  is far from prime and will grade no better than No. 2. If the pelt  turns black the chances are that the pelt will grade  No. 3 or 4, In  the case of mink, when dark spots only appear on the pelt, it is not  quite prime.    Trappers and hunters should remember that no pelt is prime or No. 1  when it turns the least blue. Opossum skins seldom turn blue even if  caught early--most other skins do.        CHAPTER XXIII.    SEASON'S CATCH.    The reason that many trappers make small catches, each season, is  from the fact that they spend only an hour or so each day at  trapping, while at most other business the party devotes the entire  day. The trapper who looks out his grounds some weeks in advance of  the trapping season is not idling his time away. He should also have  a line of traps constructed in advance of the trapping season.    There is a fascination connected with trapping that fills one with a  strange feeling when all alone constructing deadfalls and snares or  on the rounds to see what success has been yours. I have often  visited traps of old trappers, where from two to five carcasses were  hanging from a nearby sapling.    There are several instances on record where two animals have been  caught in one deadfall at the same time. A well-known trapper of Ohio  claims to have caught three skunk in one deadfall at one time a few  years since. Whether such is an actual fact or not we are unable to  say. The cases on record where two animals have been caught are so  well substantiated that there is little room left to doubt the truth  of same.    The catching of two animals at the same time is not such an  extraordinary occurrence as many, at first, think. If two animals  should come along at the same time and, smelling the bait, begin a  meal, the result is easily seen.    While trapping with deadfalls is a humane way of catching fur-bearing  animals, another thing in their favor is that skunk are usually  killed without \"perfuming\" themselves, trap and trapper as well.  Then, again, if once caught, there is no getting away.    Trappers in the forest always have the necessary tools, axe or heavy  hatchet and knife, with which to build a deadfall, while their steel  traps may all be exhausted and none set within miles. A deadfall is  built and perhaps on the trapper's return an animal is lying dead  between the poles.      * * *    During extreme cold weather there is but little use to look at traps  set for skunk, raccoon, etc., as they do not travel. Before a thaw or  warm spell the entire line should be gone over and all old bait  removed and replaced with fresh bait.    Like many another trapper you will visit your traps time after time  without catching much if any fur, yet if your traps are properly  constructed and are spread over a large area, you will catch  considerable fur during the season.    Deadfalls and snares can be strung out for miles and while they  should be looked at every other day, in good trapping weather, they  can be neglected, if the trapper cannot get around more than twice a  week, without game escaping. If you visit your traps frequently there  will be no loss from injury to fur. While it is true, should a small  animal be caught in a heavy trap, one built for much larger game, it  will be considerably flattened out, yet the skin or fur is not  damaged. There is nothing to damage your catch, in most sections,  unless you do not visit your traps often enough in warm weather, when  they may be faintly tainted. Most trapping is done, however, in cool  weather, but occasionally there may come a warm spell when skins  become tainted. If found in such condition skin as soon as possible  and place upon boards or stretchers.    Another thing greatly to the advantage of the deadfall and snare  trapper is the fact that a trapper never knows just when he will be  able to visit his traps again; the unexpected often happens, and  should it be a day or so longer than expected the deadfall or snare  still securely holds the game.    As all experienced trappers know, the first night of a cold spell is  a splendid one for animals to travel (they seem forewarned about the  weather) and a good catch is the result. If the trapper is a \"weather  prophet\" his traps are all freshly baited and in order, for this is  the time that game is on the move--often looking up new and warm dens  and generally hungry. Should the next days be cold and stormy the  trapper should get over the line as promptly as possible. After once  getting over the line after the \"cold spell,\" it is not so important  that traps be looked at for some days again.    The successful trapper will always be on the watch of the weather.  Some animals, it is true, travel during the coldest weather, but  there are many that do not, so that the trapper who sees that his  deadfalls are freshly baited when the signs point to warmer weather.  After days and nights of severe weather most animals are hungry and  when the weather moderates they are on the move.      * * *    \"I have more than one hundred deadfalls and catch large numbers of  skunk,\" writes a Connecticut trapper. \"A few years ago a trapper  within two miles of here caught more than 60 coon in deadfalls. Since  then coon have been rather scarce, but I am going to try them this  coming fall. I prefer red squirrel for skunk bait to anything else,  and extract of valerian for scent. Try it, trapper--it can't be beat.

But in all, whether  apparently active or not, certain important internal changes are at  work. We have already noticed that, even in the last days of the  _larval_ existence, some of the organs of the future imago are to be  traced. But these are as yet imperfectly developed. We have also  observed that a continuation of these changes, gradually carried on,  would be impossible in a voracious feeder; so the insect, now fully  grown, and no longer requiring a supply of food, settles down in perfect  quiet, submitting itself quite passively to any further changes that  nature may demand.    It has already suffered the loss of its claspers. Its wonderful jaws  that did so much damage (for good or evil as the case may be) to the  vegetable world are now gone, and the bulky digestive apparatus has  rapidly dwindled to useless dimensions. These and other changes, already  in progress, have to be perfected while the creature is in a restful and  helpless condition, though they may often be retarded or even suspended  during cold weather when progress would certainly bring it to an  untimely end.    But now the grandest of all these transformation scenes is nigh at hand.  The protective skin is already loosening from the almost perfect imago,  and consequently feels softer and far more yielding than it did when in  close contact with the body: the swaddled butterfly or moth (for such  the pupa is) is slowly preparing to throw off its imprisoning garb. The  wings and large compound eyes are assuming their final colours, which  now begin to show themselves through the more or less transparent skin,  and the long legs, the perfectly formed antennae, and the slender  proboscis, all of which are folded closely under the creature's thorax,  now begin to move within their loosened sheaths.    Now let us watch it closely, for one of the most wonderful sights ever  witnessed by a naturalist is about to be presented to our view. We think  we can observe slight movements; and, it may be, we can actually see the  struggling insect endeavouring to set itself free. The legs and  proboscis are moving within the loosened skin; and lo! as we watch these  motions, the prison wall bursts with a slight snapping noise (at least,  such is the case with some of the larger species), and in a moment out  pop a few long legs which immediately struggle for a foothold. The  proboscis also appears, alternately lengthening itself out and coiling  into a spiral, as if impatient to reach the sweet nectar from the bottom  of some fragrant flower cup.    [Illustration: FIG. 36--A BUTTERFLY, JUST AFTER EMERGING.]    All this takes place in less time than one requires to describe it; and,  before many seconds have passed, the struggling insect has quite  completed its last moult, and is bidding good-bye to the rent garment  that has done it good service for so long a time.    But how dreadfully disappointing! Did we not say only a few minutes  since, that a beautiful butterfly or moth was about to emerge? How,  then, is this? Here is an odd-looking creature, such as we have never  seen before! True, it has the right kind of body, though even that is so  soft and heavy that it is fairly dragged along as the insect walks. Its  antennae, too, seem to be just the right thing--that is, just what we  were expecting to see. But oh! the wings! Are we looking at a  deformity?--a failure on the part of Nature to produce what she ought?    We will not judge hastily, but continue to watch it a little longer. It  seems very restless at first, and, with the fluttering apologies for  wings, drags its heavy body along till it reaches some surface up which  it can climb. If nothing of the kind is close at hand you may place a  _rough_ upright stick in its path, and it will immediately begin to  ascend. Its motto is now 'Excelsior!' and its ambition to rise may be so  great that, on reaching the very top of the stick provided for it, it  struggles for a still higher position in life till, failing to get a  foothold in the air itself, it falls to the ground and has to retrace  its steps.    I once thought I would like to test the perseverance of a large moth in  performing its first upward journey; and as it was one from a chrysalis  to be found in nature at the foot of a tree that attains some  considerable height, I was, of course, prepared to exercise a little  patience myself.    As soon as the moth had emerged, I placed it at the bottom of a window  curtain that hung from about eight feet high to the floor. In less than  half a minute it had reached the top, and was struggling hard to get  still higher. I took it down, and again placed it at the bottom. Up it  went as fast as before; and this was repeated nine times with exactly  the same result. For the tenth time I placed the persevering creature at  the bottom of the curtain; and, after it had walked about halfway up, it  _suddenly_ stopped, apparently quite satisfied with having travelled a  distance of over seventy feet in an upward direction. Its six legs were  immediately arranged symmetrically in a business-like manner, and there  it settled quite still, as if it had some definite object in stopping  just exactly in that spot.    But we must now return to our own insect, which has by this time settled  itself in a similar manner on the stick we provided for it. The peculiar  organs which represent the wings, though so very small, show distinctly,  in miniature, the colour and pattern of the fully developed wings of the  species. An interesting change is just now commencing. These wings are  apparently growing larger, but the development is very unequal, so that  they become curled and crumpled till they are even more unsightly than  before. All seems to be going amiss. But this lasts only for a short  time. The fluid from the body steadily rushes into the _nervures_,  causing the wings to expand, and in a few minutes the beautiful pinions  are stretched to the full extent, assume their normal shape, and expose  the full glory of their brilliant colours.    It may be interesting if I give an example showing the exact time taken  for the full development of the wings of a certain insect. So I will  here quote an entry from my note book; and, by the way, let me strongly  advise all my young readers who follow up this subject to habitually  enter in a book kept specially for the purpose all facts which strike  them as they pursue their study of nature. The note to which I refer  runs as follows:    'Early on the evening of the 22nd [April] I selected a few chrysalides  of Populi [the Poplar Hawk Moth, page 209] which, from the looseness of  their cases, were thought to be just on the point of emerging. At 8.46  one of them showed signs of restlessness; and, after a few vigorous  movements, during which it rolled itself over on the glass [I had placed  the pupae on a piece of plate glass so that slight movements might be  more easily detected], the front of its case was suddenly thrust off  with considerable force; and in _less than four seconds_ the imago was  quite free and crawling on the table. After trying hard to reach a  higher point than was provided for about four minutes, it rested to  expand its wings--now about seven-sixteenths of an inch long, or  one-third the total length of the body. At 9 o'clock the wings reached  half the length of the body, and were much curled. At 9.12 they were  fully expanded and straightened out.'    From this extract we see that the whole period from the bursting of the  case to the full expansion of the wings was only twenty-six minutes; and  it will be well to remind the reader that the process occupies even a  much shorter time than this with many species, both of butterflies and  moths. It will be observed, also, that the _evening_ was chosen as the  time for the observation. There was a reason for this. The Poplar Hawk  Moth, as is the case with many others, almost invariably emerges from  the chrysalis in the evening--usually after dark. But it may be  mentioned in passing that a far larger number of the _Lepidoptera_ as  invariably emerge in the morning.    Again we will return to our newly emerged insect, for there are still  one or two interesting points to observe. The wings have fully expanded,  it is true, but how very limp they are! Take the creature on the tip of  your finger and hold it so that its body is in a horizontal position.  Immediately the wings bend downward with their own weight, so soft and  flexible are they. The body, too, is still very soft, and apparently  much too heavy for flight. Then, if you place it on a flat surface, it  will immediately try to find some perpendicular or overhanging surface  from which it can suspend itself by means of its legs, so that the  pendant and straightened wings are in the best possible position for  drying. As the insect walks away in search of such a resting place, the  body still drags as it did before, and the wings bend over, either both  on one side or one on each side of the body.    It is some time before the wings are sufficiently dry and rigid for  flight, but the period varies greatly with different species. Some of  the small butterflies and moths take to flight long before an hour has  passed, but in many cases several hours elapse before the creature  starts from its first resting place. Butterflies that emerge in the  morning spend their first day actively on the wing; but the nocturnal  moths that emerge early in the day do not fly till evening twilight.  When, however, the time arrives, the insect flutters its wings as if to  test their power before committing itself to the air; and frequently,  after only a few seconds spent in this preparatory exercise, off it  darts with astonishing rapidity. But others seem far more cautious. They"]]]
