In America it would exclude from our conventions all       persons of color, for there customs, habits, tastes, prejudices,       would be outraged by _their_ admission. And I do not wish to be       deprived of the aid of those who have done so much for this       cause, for the purpose of gratifying any mere custom or       prejudice. Women have furnished most essential aid in       accomplishing what has been done in the State of Massachusetts.       If, in the Legislature of that State, I have been able to do       anything in furtherance of that cause, by keeping on my legs       eight or ten hours day after day, it was mainly owing to the       valuable assistance I derived from the women. And shall such       women be denied seats in this Convention? My friend George       Thompson, yonder, can testify to the faithful services rendered       to this cause by those same women. He can tell you that when       \"gentlemen of property and standing\" in \"broad day\" and       \"broadcloth,\" undertook to drive him from Boston, putting his       life in peril, it was our women who made their own persons a       bulwark of protection around him. And shall such women be refused       seats here in a Convention seeking the emancipation of slaves       throughout the world? What a misnomer to call this a World's       Convention of Abolitionists, when some of the oldest and most       thorough-going Abolitionists in the world are denied the right to       be represented in it by delegates of their own choice.    And thus for the space of half an hour did Mr. Bradburn, six feet high  and well-proportioned, with vehement gesticulations and voice of  thunder, bombard the prejudices of England and the hypocrisies of  America.         George Thompson: I have listened to the arguments advanced on       this side and on that side of this vexed question. I listened       with profound attention to the arguments of Mr. Burnet, expecting       that from him, as I was justified in expecting, I should hear the       strongest arguments that could be adduced on this, or any other       subject upon which he might be pleased to employ his talents, or       which he might adorn with his eloquence. What are his arguments?       Let it be premised, as I speak in the presence of American       friends, that that gentleman is one of the best controversialists       in the country, and one of the best authorities upon questions of       business, points of order, and matters of principle. What are       the strongest arguments, which one of the greatest champions on       any question which he chooses to espouse, has brought forward?       They are these:              1st. That English phraseology should be construed according            to English usage.              2d. That it was never contemplated by the anti-slavery            committee that ladies should occupy a seat in this            Convention.              3d. That the ladies of England are not here as delegates.              4th. That he has no desire to offer an affront to the ladies            now present.         Here I presume are the strongest arguments the gentleman has to       adduce, for he never fails to use to the best advantage the       resources within his reach. I look at these arguments, and I       place on the other side of the question, the fact that there are       in this assembly ladies who present themselves as delegates from       the oldest societies in America. I expected that Mr. Burnet       would, as he was bound to do, if he intended to offer a       successful opposition to their introduction into this Convention,       grapple with the constitutionality of their credentials. I       thought he would come to the question of title. I thought he       would dispute the right of a convention assembled in       Philadelphia, for the abolition of slavery, consisting of       delegates from different States in the Union, and comprised of       individuals of both sexes, to send one or all of the ladies now       in our presence. I thought he would grapple with the fact, that       those ladies came to us who have no slavery from a country in       which they have slaves, as the representatives of two millions       and a half of captives. Let gentlemen, when they come to vote on       this question, remember, that in receiving or rejecting these       ladies, they acknowledge or despise [loud cries of No, no]. I ask       gentlemen, who shout \"no,\" if they know the application I am       about to make. I did not mean to say you would despise the       ladies, but that you would, by your vote, acknowledge or despise       the parties whose cause they espouse. It appears we are prepared       to sanction ladies in the employment of all means, so long as       they are confessedly unequal with ourselves. It seems that the       grand objection to their appearance amongst us is this, that it       would be placing them on a footing of equality, and that would be       contrary to principle and custom. For years the women of America       have carried their banner in the van, while the men have humbly       followed in the rear. It is well known that the National Society       solicited Angelina Grimke to undertake a mission through New       England, to rouse the attention of the women to the wrongs of       slavery, and that that distinguished woman displayed her talents       not only in the drawing-room, but before the Senate of       Massachusetts. Let us contrast our conduct with that of the       Senators and Representatives of Massachusetts who did not disdain       to hear her. It was in consequence of her exertions, which       received the warmest approval of the National Society, that that       interest sprung up which has awakened such an intense feeling       throughout America. Then with reference to efficient management,       the most vigorous anti-slavery societies are those which are       managed by ladies.         If now, after the expression of opinion on various sides, the       motion should be withdrawn with the consent of all parties, I       should be glad. But when I look at the arguments against the       title of these women to sit amongst us, I can not but consider       them frivolous and groundless. The simple question before us is,       whether these ladies, taking into account their credentials, the       talent they have displayed, the sufferings they have endured, the       journey they have undertaken, should be acknowledged by us, in       virtue of these high titles, or should be shut out for the       reasons stated.         Mr. Phillips, being urged on all sides to withdraw his motion,       said: It has been hinted very respectfully by two or three       speakers that the delegates from the State of Massachusetts       should withdraw their credentials, or the motion before the       meeting. The one appears to me to be equivalent to the other. If       this motion be withdrawn we must have another. I would merely ask       whether any man can suppose that the delegates from Massachusetts       or Pennsylvania can take upon their shoulders the responsibility       of withdrawing that list of delegates from your table, which       their constituents told them to place there, and whom they       sanctioned as their fit representatives, because this Convention       tells us that it is not ready to meet the ridicule of the morning       papers, and to stand up against the customs of England. In       America we listen to no such arguments. If we had done so we had       never been here as Abolitionists. It is the custom there not to       admit colored men into respectable society, and we have been told       again and again that we are outraging the decencies of humanity       when we permit colored men to sit by our side. When we have       submitted to brick-bats, and the tar tub and feathers in America,       rather than yield to the custom prevalent there of not admitting       colored brethren into our friendship, shall we yield to parallel       custom or prejudice against women in Old England? We can not       yield this question if we would; for it is a matter of       conscience. But we would not yield it on the ground of       expediency. In doing so we should feel that we were striking off       the right arm of our enterprise. We could not go back to America       to ask for any aid from the women of Massachusetts if we had       deserted them, when they chose to send out their own sisters as       their representatives here. We could not go back to Massachusetts       and assert the unchangeableness of spirit on the question. We       have argued it over and over again, and decided it time after       time, in every society in the land, in favor of the women. We       have not changed by crossing the water. We stand here the       advocates of the same principle that we contend for in America.       We think it right for women to sit by our side there, and we       think it right for them to do the same here. We ask the       Convention to admit them; if they do not choose to grant it, the       responsibility rests on their shoulders. Massachusetts can not       turn aside, or succumb to any prejudices or customs even in the       land she looks upon with so much reverence as the land of       Wilberforce, of Clarkson, and of O'Connell. It is a matter of       conscience, and British virtue ought not to ask us to yield.         Mr. Ashurst: You are convened to influence society upon a subject       connected with the kindliest feelings of our nature; and being       the first assembly met to shake hands with other nations, and       employ your combined efforts to annihilate slavery throughout the       world, are you to commence by saying, you will take away the       rights of one-half of creation!

FERRUCCIO BENVENUTO BUSONI    Biographical      Ferruccio Benvenuto Busoni was born at Empoli, near Florence, Italy,  April 1, 1866. His father was a clarinetist and his mother whose maiden  name was Weiss, indicating her German ancestry was an excellent pianist.  His first teachers were his parents. So pronounced was his talent that  he made his debut at the age of eight in Vienna, Austria. He then  studied in the Austrian city of Graz with W. A. Remy, whose right name  was Dr. Wilhelm Mayer. This able teacher aside from being a learned  jurist was also devoted to music and had among his other pupils no less  a person than Felix Weingartner.    In 1881 Busoni toured Italy and was made a member of the Reale Accademia  Filharmonica at Bologna. In 1886 he went to reside at Leipsic. Two years  later he became teacher of pianoforte at the Helsingfors Conservatory in  the Finnish capital. In 1890 he captured the famous Rubinstein prizes  for both pianoforte and composition. In the same year he became  Professor of pianoforte playing at the Moscow Imperial Conservatory. The  next year he accepted a similar position in the New England Conservatory  at Boston,--returning to Europe for another tour in 1893. After many  successful tours he accepted the position of director of the  Meisterschule at the Imperial Conservatory in Vienna. His compositions  include over one hundred published opus numbers, the most pretentious  probably being his _Choral Concerto_. His editions of Bach are  masterpieces of technical and artistic erudition.    (The following Conference was conducted in English.)    [Illustration: FERRUCCIO B. BUSONI]          VII    IMPORTANT DETAILS IN PIANO STUDY    FERRUCCIO BENVENUTO BUSONI      THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DETAIL    \"Some years ago I met a very famous artist whose celebrity rested upon  the wonderful colored glass windows that he had produced. He was  considered by most of his contemporaries the greatest of all makers of  high-art windows. His fame had extended throughout the artistic circles  of all Europe. A little remark he made to me illustrates the importance  of detail better than anything of which I can think at present.    \"He said, 'If a truly great work of art in the form of a stained glass  window should be accidentally shattered to little bits, one should be  able to estimate the greatness of the whole window by examining one of  the fragments even though all the other pieces were missing.'    \"In fine piano playing all of the details are important. I do not mean  to say that if one were in another room that one could invariably tell  the ability of an artist by hearing him strike one note, but if the note  is heard in relation to the other notes in a composition, its  proportionate value should be so delicately and artistically estimated  by the highly trained performer, that it forms part of the artistic  whole.    \"For instance, it is quite easy to conceive of compositions demanding a  very smooth running performance in which one jarring or harsh note  indicating faulty artistic calculation upon the part of the player would  ruin the entire interpretation. As examples of this one might cite the  Bach _Choral Vorspiel_, _Nun Freut euch_, of which I have made an  arrangement, and such a composition as the Chopin Prelude Opus 28, No.  3, with its running accompaniment in the left hand.    \"It is often perfection in little things which distinguishes the  performance of the great pianist from that of the novice. The novice  usually manages to get the so-called main points, but he does not work  for the little niceties of interpretation which are almost invariably  the defining characteristic of the interpretations of the real  artist--that is, the performer who has formed the habit of stopping at  nothing short of his highest ideal of perfection.      LEARNING TO LISTEN    \"There is a detail which few students observe which is of such vast  importance that one is tempted to say that the main part of successful  musical progress depends upon it. This is the detail of learning to  listen. Every sound that is produced during the practice period should  be heard. That is, it should be heard with ears open to give that sound  the intelligent analysis which it deserves.    \"Anyone who has observed closely and taught extensively must have  noticed that hours and hours are wasted by students strumming away on  keyboards and giving no more attention to the sounds they produce than  would the inmates of a deaf and dumb asylum. These students all expect  to become fine performers even though they may not aim to become  virtuosos. To them the piano keyboard is a kind of gymnasium attached to  a musical instrument. They may of course acquire strong fingers, but  they will have to learn to listen before they can hope to become even  passable performers.    \"At my own recitals no one in the audience listens more attentively than  I do. I strive to hear every note and while I am playing my attention is  so concentrated upon the one purpose of delivering the work in the most  artistic manner dictated by the composer's demands and my conception of  the piece, that I am little conscious of anything else. I have also  learned that I must continually have my mind alert to opportunities for  improvement. I am always in quest of new beauties and even while playing  in public it is possible to conceive of new details that come like  revelations.    \"The artist who has reached the period when he fails to be on the  outlook for details of this kind and is convinced that in no possible  way could his performances be improved, has reached a very dangerous  stage of artistic stagnation which will result in the ruin of his  career. There is always room for improvement, that is the development of  new details, and it is this which gives zest and intellectual interest  to the work of the artist. Without it his public efforts would become  very tame and unattractive.      SELF DEVELOPMENT    \"In my own development as an artist it has been made evident to me, time  and time again, that success comes from the careful observance of  details. All students should strive to estimate their own artistic  ability very accurately. A wrong estimate always leads to a dangerous  condition. If I had failed to attend to certain details many years ago,  I would have stopped very far short of anything like success.    \"I remember that when I concluded my term as professor of piano at the  New England Conservatory of Music I was very conscious of certain  deficiencies in my style. Notwithstanding the fact that I had been  accepted as a virtuoso in Europe and in America and had toured with  great orchestras such as the Boston Symphony Orchestra, I knew better  than anyone else that there were certain details in my playing that I  could not afford to neglect.    \"For instance, I knew that my method of playing the trill could be  greatly improved and I also knew that I lacked force and endurance in  certain passages. Fortunately, although a comparatively young man, I was  not deceived by the flattery of well-meaning, but incapable critics, who  were quite willing to convince me that my playing was as perfect as it  was possible to make it. Every seeker of artistic truth is more widely  awake to his own deficiencies than any of his critics could possibly be.    \"In order to rectify the details I have mentioned as well as some I have  not mentioned, I have come to the conclusion that I must devise an  entirely new technical system. Technical systems are best when they are  individual. Speaking theoretically, every individual needs a different  technical system. Every hand, every arm, every set of ten fingers, every  body and, what is of greatest importance, every intellect is different  from every other. I consequently endeavored to get down to the basic  laws underlying the subject of technic and make a system of my own.    \"After much study, I discovered what I believed to be the technical  cause of my defects and then I returned to Europe and for two years I  devoted myself almost exclusively to technical study along the  individual lines I had devised. To my great delight details that had  always defied me, the rebellious trills, the faltering bravura passages,  the uneven runs, all came into beautiful submission and with them came a  new delight in playing.      FINDING INDIVIDUAL FAULTS    \"I trust that my experience will set some ambitious piano students to  thinking and that they may be benefited by it. There is always a way of  correcting deficiencies if the way can only be found. The first thing,  however, is to recognize the detail itself and then to realize that  instead of being a detail it is a matter of vast importance until it has  been conquered and brought into submission. In playing, always note  where your difficulties seem to lie. Then, when advisable, isolate those  difficulties and practice them separately. This is the manner in which  all good technical exercises are devised.    \"Your own difficulty is the difficulty"]]]
