RICHMOND.      Noticing in the journals some brief but very just remarks upon the  character of the eminent Roman Catholic historian of England, who died  July 17th, at the good old age of more than four-score years, I am  induced to think that an account of a visit which I had the honor to  make this celebrated scholar, may not be altogether without interest  for your readers.    March 12, 1850, having a leisure day at Lancaster, and having already  visited John of Gaunt's castle, in company with several of those  genial spirits who afford me an unusually delightful social  remembrance of the dingy buildings and narrow crooked streets of that  famous old town, one of them happened to mention the name of Dr.  Lingard. I instantly inquired after him with interest, and, observing  my enthusiasm, Mr. T. J---- proposed a drive to his residence at  Hornby, a village some twelve or thirteen miles distant. I of course  gladly acceded to the proposal, and we were soon on our way, with a  fleet horse, over the absolutely perfect English turnpike road--for  the roads in England are always passable, and not \"_improved_,\" like  some of those around New-York, in so continued a manner as to be  useless.    After a fine rural drive, crossing the river Loon, and through  Lonsdale, we came within sight of an old church and castle. I took the  church to be that of the historian, but found, to my surprise, that  the famous old sage was placed in entire seclusion, and ministered to  a very few, and those very poor, sheep, in a little chapel, or room,  under his own roof. In this remote and by no means picturesque  village, at an antiquated house, we knocked, and were told by the aged  domestic that the venerable historian had been very feeble of late,  and had gone out, on this fine day in the spring, for a walk. After  many inquiries among the villagers, by whom he was as well known as  beloved, I proposed to take the line of the new railway, and, after  quite a walk, met a feeble old man, with a scholar's face, a bright  twinkling black eye, supporting his steps on a staff, and wrapped up  with all the care which an aged and faithful housekeeper could bestow  upon a long-tried and most indulgent master. I pronounced his name,  and gave him my own; stated that I was a presbyter in the holy (though  not Roman) Catholic church, that I had long admired his integrity and  faithfulness as an historian, and that it was by no means the least of  my happy days in England that I was now permitted to speak to him face  to face. The kind and gentle old man seemed truly astonished that any  one who had come so far, and seen so much, should care for seeing  _him_, and rewarded my enthusiasm with a hearty grasp of the hand that  had wielded so admired a pen. We then walked on together towards his  house, and you will not blame me for saying, that I was proud to offer  the support of my arm to this fine octogenarian, who had not suffered  the spirit of the priest to becloud the candor of the historian. We  conversed with the greatest freedom upon our points of difference, and  he repeated to me, personally, _his entire disbelief in the fable of  the nag's head ordination_. He seemed to be only _historically_ aware  of a disruption between us, for the benevolence of his heart would  acknowledge no actual difference.    I cannot refrain from quoting a somewhat amusing illustration of his  infinite and childlike simplicity of character, combined with an utter  ignorance of those rudiments of modern science which would be much  more familiar to our district school-boys than to many men educated in  those classic homes of ancient learning, the English universities.  Some posts had been set in the ground, and were bound together, for  strength, by iron wires; and the venerable sage said, \"I suppose this  is the Electric Telegraph.\" I was obliged to insist with a kind of  explanatory and playful pertinacity, that this supposition must be  incorrect, because electricity could not be conducted, unless the  wires were at least continued _through_ the thick posts, instead of  being wound _around_ them. At his house, we found the study not very  well supplied with books, for the aged scholar had now almost ceased  to peruse these. At my request he wrote out very slowly, but in a  wonderfully distinct hand for eighty, his own name and the date, \"John  Lingard, Hornby, March 12, 1850;\" and voluntarily added a Latin  punning inscription, which he had made the evening before, which he  humorously proposed to have engraved upon the new Menai bridge. In  this he had spoken of the _builder of the bridge_, the celebrated  Stephens, as _Pontifex Maximus_. I need not say that I shall preserve  these papers among the most precious of my English mementos. I was  sorry I could have no hopes that the branch which he gave me from the  tree that he had transplanted with his own hands from the battle-field  of Cannae to the quiet of his garden at Hornby, would ever flourish in  America. After many hospitable invitations, which other engagements  obliged us to decline, and many modest expressions of the gratitude  which he seemed deeply to feel for the pains that I had taken to come  so far to visit him, we bade farewell to the candid priest, who began,  as he told me, an essay to defend his Church against the aspersions of  Hume, and had ended by producing a voluminous as well as luminous  history.

The funeral rites of the lamented Calhoun have been performed. So  deeply has the mournful pageant impressed me, so vividly have memories  of the past been recalled, that I am incapable of thinking or writing  on any other theme. My heart prompts me to garner up my recollections  of this illustrious statesman. I can better preserve these invaluable  memories by committing them to paper, and as you enjoyed but one brief  interview with Mr. Calhoun, these pages shall be addressed to you.    An eloquent member of the House of Representatives, from your state,  has compared this southern luminary to that remarkable constellation  the Southern Cross. A few years since, in sailing to a West Indian  island, I had a perilous voyage, but have ever felt that the sight of  that Southern Cross, which had long haunted my imagination, almost  repaid me for its excitement and suffering. And thus do I regard an  acquaintance with this intellectual star as one great compensation for  a separation from my early home. It would have been a loss not to have  seen that poetic group, which greets the traveller as he sails  southward, but how much greater the loss, never to have beheld that  unique luminary which has set to rise no more upon our visible  horizon.    Mr. Calhoun's public character is so well known to you that I shall  speak of him principally in his private relations, and shall refer to  his opinions only as expressed in conversation--for it was in the  repose of his happy home, in the tranquillity of domestic life, and in  the freedom of social intercourse, that I knew him.    While the clarion-notes of his fame resound among the distant hills  and valleys of our land, while those who in political strife crossed  lances with this champion of the south nobly acknowledge his valor and  his honor, while Carolina chants a requiem for her departed dead, may  not one who knows his moral elevation, and who has witnessed his  domestic virtues, have the consolation of adding an unaffected tribute  to his memory? While his devoted constituents, with impressive symbols  and mournful pageants, perform funereal rites, erect for him the  costly marble, weave for him the brilliant chaplet, be it mine to  scatter over his honored tomb simple but ever green leaflets. While in  glowing colors the orator portrays him on his peerless career in the  political arena, be it mine to delineate the daily beauty of his life.    In Mr. Calhoun were united the simple habits of the Spartan lawgiver,  the inflexible principles of the Roman senator, the courteous bearing  and indulgent kindness of the American host, husband, and father. This  was indeed a rare union. Life with him was solemn and earnest, and yet  all about him was cheerful. I never heard him utter a jest; there was  an unvarying dignity and gravity in his manner; and yet the playful  child regarded him fearlessly and lovingly. Few men indulge their  families in as free, confidential, and familiar intercourse as did  this great statesman. Indeed, to those who had an opportunity of  observing him in his own house, it was evident that his cheerful and  happy home had attractions for him superior to those which any other  place could offer. Here was a retreat from the cares, the observation,  and the homage of the world. In few homes could the transient visitor  feel more at ease than did the guest at Fort Hill. Those who knew Mr.  Calhoun only by his senatorial speeches may suppose that his heart and  mind were all engrossed in the nation's councils, but there were  moments when his courtesy, his minute kindnesses, made you forget the  statesman.

Its history, (#14)"],[1,"past to  assure ourselves that, in general, epizootics have been coincident with  some violent change of season, such as extreme droughts, or  superabundant rains; that is to say, when the cattle, disturbed in the  physiological conditions of their health, have become favourable to the  incubation of the miasmatic leaven scattered through the air, or else  when these animals were living under irregular conditions, and had to  endure unwonted fatigues and privations, as in the folds of campaigning  armies, for instance.    These epizootics have appeared to depend not only on the state of the  soil and of the health of the cattle, but also (we repeat it designedly)  on an element no less indispensable to the propagation of the disease--a  special state of the air, which favours the development and preservation  of typhic miasma: for sometimes a sudden change of temperature has  proved sufficient to stop the rampant progress of the contagion, the  other conditions remaining unaltered.    These relations of cause and effect between the contagious principle,  the predisposition of the animals, and the state of the atmosphere,  evidently are subject to some exceptions; but we must allow that in the  present epizootic they are absolutely and completely applicable. For, in  truth, the years 1864 and 1865 have been distinguished, if not by the  persistency of a high rate of temperature not often witnessed, at least  by an excessive drought during the months which are both hot and rainy;  and this has happened in the various countries of Europe, thereby  producing a falling off in the pasture and fodder both as respects their  quantity and quality.    As to England, a country usually cold and damp, but renowned for its  spacious green fields and meadows, it has suffered more than any other  country from these unfavourable conditions, and their destructive  influence on the grass and corn; the herds having found a great  reduction of food where formerly they met with abundance. Everybody has  seen, as we have ourselves, large herds of cattle, wandering in  amazement from field to field, and seeking for something to browse on a  parched and arid soil. A supplementary provision of corn, roots, malt,  and the grounds of the beer vat or spirit barrel, no doubt served to  mitigate the sad effects of these privations on the health of cattle;  but in spite of all that could be done, their blood became impoverished,  their strength and vital resistance sank, and (like the animals which we  transferred at will into a soil more favourable to the spread of  parasitic diseases), they afforded last June, as they do now, an unusual  predisposition to suffer and transform the morbific principles of  typhus, which in all probability they would have been proof against at  any other time. We may very fairly infer this much, for we must of  necessity believe that the regular importation of cattle from those  countries which are considered as the permanent focus of typhus, has  from time to time transported the miasmatic germs of this malady into  England, although the virus did not take effect on British cattle at  those periods, for want of one or other of the conditions necessary to  its generation and development.    We may likewise infer, and a watchful appreciation of the facts  contained in the veterinary medical journals would show that this  opinion is not unfounded, that the special disease which constitutes  this typhus (similar in that respect to epidemic diseases), may develop  itself in one beast by accident, spontaneously, sporadically--that is to  say, without immediate contagion; in a word, _apart from those epizootic  conditions which alone render its propagation possible_. To be brief, we  think that an isolated case of cattle typhus may by chance be detected,  when there is no epizootia prevailing to account for it, just as we  occasionally meet with cases of typhus or cholera among men during  seasons absolutely free from these epidemics. It would not, therefore,  appear to us altogether impossible, that under the influence of very  special conditions, the contagious typhus of the ox might have its birth  in England; and this would favour the theory of those reasoners who  maintain that this typhus met with the first causes, and the origin of  its development, in the stalls and cowsheds of London. But such has not  been the cause of cattle typhus in the epizootia which we see at  present.    No doubt some animals suffered great privations, but, whatever  alteration their health may have sustained, all this is nothing to be  compared to the sufferings endured by the cattle in the steppes under  the influence of deleterious conditions of the most exceptional  character, which do, indeed, give birth to this typhus, and which we  have already described.    No, certainly not! _Nothing authorizes us to believe that the typhus now  under our observation was bred and born, at first, within the stalls and  cowsheds of London._ It was most assuredly imported. But it is true,  nevertheless, that this cruel scourge found the horned cattle of England  predisposed to receive it, and it likewise met with atmospheric  conditions favourable to its subsequent diffusion; in a word, it met  with the epizootic genius proper for the generation and propagation of  the typhus miasma.    It is thus that we may account for and reconcile the two contending  theories, one of which refers the cause of this typhus to foreign  importation, whilst the other insists that it originated in the filthy  and half-ventilated cowsheds of the metropolis.    But if this typhus could not spring up spontaneously out of the bovine  race of England, it must be confessed that, independently of the general  predisposition due to a great and protracted drought, it found in the  sickening sheds of the metropolitan and country cattle the most  favourable conditions for its incubation and subsequent diffusion.    It would, indeed, be difficult to conceive of anything more directly  adverse to the hygienic laws of health in cattle than the stalls and  sheds dotted over the densely populated districts of London. Most of  these pent-up cribs are situated in narrow lanes and yards, in filthy  streets and blind alleys; and within these close, hot, and steaming  receptacles the miserable cows, pressed against each other, without  ever moving a limb, waste away and become phthisical in a very short  space of time. We may readily imagine what a prey to the contagion must  be afforded by these animals, already more or less ailing, some of which  are fed in a great measure on malt, so sour and acrid that the very  smell of it is intolerable. The milk from these cows is, moreover, of so  wretched a quality, that in a cowhouse containing 48 of these poor  creatures, at Kensington, I found only one, the milk of which exhibited  the taste and quality fit for a sick child, for whom I ordered a milk  diet.    It is not, therefore, to be wondered at that the present epizootia,  during this late tropical season[E] especially, should have met with all  the conditions most conducive to its development and propagation.    When the cattle distemper first broke out, the graziers, not suspecting  its gravity, attempted to treat the animals themselves, but soon  afterwards perceiving the fruitlessness of all their remedial measures,  they felt that the best thing they could do was to turn their sick  beasts to whatever account they could, by driving them to market or to  the slaughter-houses, an expedient which they were the more disposed to  adopt, inasmuch as the diseased cows had ceased to give milk. And then,  the removal of these animals, in various stages of the disorder, became  the most rapid means of disseminating the contagion, which, had it been  concentrated and pent-up at first within its narrow focus, would  otherwise have spread with less fearful havoc.[F]    In the meanwhile the sick cows being commingled with thousands of heads  of cattle exposed for sale at the different markets, communicated far  and wide the principle of the disease; and as a certain number of these  animals remaining unsold were driven back to the farms, into stalls  until then removed from every cause of contagion, they introduced among  their sound companions the fatal germs of the distemper; and as, again,  this effectual means of propagating the evil was repeated several times  in the same week, the consequence was that, by the end of July--a little  more than a month after the outbreak--the whole of the south of England  was in some sort contaminated. Thence the contagion extended to the  north of the kingdom, and passed into Scotland; so that, at present, the  cattle-typhus has spread its ramifications over a great number of the  counties of Great Britain.[G]    In the first instance, the contagion spread from animal to animal by  means of an infecting influence in some degree direct, among cattle  sheltered beneath the same roof, or collected in swarms within the same  markets. But very soon the air itself was impregnated and polluted by  the vaporization and diffusion of the typhic miasma; and herds of cattle  which had no contact, either direct or indirect, with infected animals,  were seen to be tainted with the distemper. Whether this contamination  was produced by the passage of attainted cattle along the public roads  (having fields on the right and left), or otherwise, nothing but an  absolute isolation, an utter impossibility of contact, appeared to offer  a perfect immunity against the spread of the evil.    The miasma, condensed by the fogs and transported in all directions by  the winds, now began to overleap every natural or artificial barrier,  and the favoured herds, ruminating at their ease in the manorial farms  of the wealthy patricians, in their well-kept parks and amid every  luxury, were suddenly smitten with an evil which in their case seemed an  anomaly.
