It is evident that this  form, while favorable to coherence and unity, is lacking in scope and  in opportunity for variety and contrast. It did, however, emphasize  the principle of recapitulation; in fact it became the convention (as  we shall see in the dances of the Suite) for the closing measures of  the second part to be an exact duplicate in the home-key of that which  had been presented at the end of part one. We shall observe, as we  continue our studies, that the trend of musical composition gradually  swung over to the Three-part form, the essential feature of which is  restatement after _intervening contrast_.    [Footnote 65: See _The Appreciation of Music_ by Surette and Mason, p.  36.]    For illustrations of the Two-part Form see the Supplement Nos. 20, 21,  22, 23, 24.    Only in such comparatively simple examples as those just cited is  found this perfect balance in the length of the two parts. We often  observe extended sentences in the first part; and it became the custom  for the second part to be considerably lengthened, to include  modulations into more remote keys and even to display certain  developments of the main material. For a striking example of a  movement which, although definitely in Two-part form, (_i.e._, it is  in two clear divisions and has but _one_ theme) is yet of considerable  scope and variety, see the Allegretto of Beethoven's Fourth Sonata. It  was, in fact, this instinct for contrasting variety in the second  part[66] which (as can be shown from historical examples)[67]  gradually led to the developing and establishment of the Three-part  form.    [Footnote 66: As an illustration of this tendency see the Scherzo of  Beethoven's Second Sonata, the second part of which has a new theme of  its own, although the movement as a whole is clearly in Two-part  form.]    [Footnote 67: See _The Sonata Form_ by W.H. Hadow, Chapter III.]    The essentials of this structure, so frequent in all pianoforte  literature, are the existence of _three_ distinct _parts_--hence the  name: a clause of assertion in the home-key; a second clause,  affording a genuine _contrast_ to the first part in regard to key,  melodic outline and general treatment, and a third clause of  reassertion, which shall repeat--either literally or in varied  form--the material of part one.[68] In the Three-part form, as  employed in the classic Minuet and Scherzo, each of the three parts  _taken by itself_ is in complete Two-part form; and as the third part  was generally a literal repetition of part one, it was not written  out, but at the end of the middle part (called the Trio, because it  was originally written in three-voiced harmony) we find the direction  \"Minuet or Scherzo da capo,\" meaning a return to the first part. A  coda or tail-piece is often added to round out the form. As the  student will become thoroughly familiar with the Three-part form, in  connection with the classic Symphonies soon to be studied (each  Minuet, Scherzo or Trio being an example), our illustrations show the  use of this form in independent pieces and are chiefly taken from  modern literature; the object being so to interest the student in the  beauty of these compositions as to convince him that in all good music  content and design go hand is hand. For examples[69] see Supplement  Nos. 25, 26, 27.    [Footnote 68: The three-part form is derived partly from the Italian  \"da Capo Aria\" and partly from the fundamental instinct for  restatement which we have seen in the Folk-song.]    [Footnote 69: Additional illustrations, which will repay study are the  following: the Allegretto of Beethoven's Sixth Sonata; the Schubert  Impromptu, op. 90, No. 4; Brahms's Intermezzo, op. 117, No. 1 and the  Ballade in G minor, op. 118, No. 3, and for orchestra--in extended  treatment--Debussy's _Prelude a l'apres-midi d'un Faune_.]          CHAPTER VI    THE CLASSICAL AND THE MODERN SUITE      No sooner had the Two-and Three-part forms become accepted as definite  means of instrumental expression, than composers were eager to try  their skill in combining dance-movements in such forms into larger  groups. These compositions--known in France as Ordres, in Germany as  Suites and Partitas and in England as Lessons--though all the  movements were in the _same key_, yet showed considerable variety by  reason of the contrast in the dance rhythms. They were, moreover,  simple, direct and easily understood of the people.[70] This  development was furthered by the perfecting of two groups of  instruments: The violins, by the great Italian masters; and those  precursors of our modern pianoforte, the harpsichord, clavichord and  spinet. We find, consequently, the Italians--of whom Corelli was most  prominent--combining these dances into groups called Sonate da Ballo:  and the French composers Couperin and Rameau, developing the  possibilities of keyed stringed instruments in graceful pieces to  which fantastic titles, such as _La Poule_, _Le Rappel des Oiseaux_,  etc., were often given. The greatest master of instrumental style in  these early days was the Italian, Domenico Scarlatti (1685-1757). He  was famous both as composer and performer--the first, in fact, of the  long line of key-board virtuosi--and in his compositions in dance form  and in those of a more abstract type there is a sparkling fancy and an  adjustment of the thought to his instrument, which will keep them  forever immortal.[71]    [Footnote 70: For an interesting and comprehensive account of this  development see Grove's Dictionary, Volume IV, article on the Suite.]    [Footnote 71: For extensive comments on Scarlatti's style see _The  History of the Pianoforte and Pianoforte Players_ by Oscar Bie, pp.  68-90.]    The grouping together of dance forms reached its highest development  through the genius of Sebastian Bach in the so-called _French and  English Suites_.[72] In these compositions--in the Partitas and in the  orchestral Suite in D major, which contains the well-known Aria, often  played in transcription for Violin solo--the dance-forms are not  employed literally but are made a vehicle for the expression of varied  types of human emotion and sentiment. Nor should we overlook the  twelve _Harpsichord Lessons_ of Handel--especially the superb Fugue in  E minor in the Fourth Suite--which are noteworthy for their vigor,  though, in freshness and delicacy of invention, not to be compared  with Bach's.    [Footnote 72: These titles, according to Parry (see his life of Bach,  Chapters IV and XII passim), were not given by Bach himself but were  assigned, in the case of the French Suites, to denote the delicacy of  treatment found therein, and in the English, a certain massive style.]    We now give a tabulated list of the customary dance forms, both as  found in the Classic and the modern Suite or used as independent  pieces; and we shall then analyze those which have the most  characteristic rhythmic pattern.

When five years old, she was stolen and       taken to the slave market in New Orleans. Failing to sell her       there, the slave traders took her to Jefferson, Texas, and sold her       to Bill Tumlin. Francis stayed with him five years after she was       freed, then married and moved to Cass County, Texas. She became       blind a year ago, and now lives at the Bagland Old Folks Home, 313       Elm St., Texarkana, Texas.      \"My name am Francis Black, and I don't know jes' how old I is, but  'members lots 'bout them slave days. I was a big gal, washin' and  ironin', when they sot the darkies free. From that, I cal'late I'm in my  eighties.    \"I was born in Grand Bluff, in Mississippi, on Old Man Carlton's  plantation, and I was stole from my folks when I was a li'l gal and  never seed them no more. Us kids played in the big road there in  Mississippi, and one day me and 'nother gal is playin' up and down the  road and three white men come 'long in a wagon. They grabs us up and  puts us in the wagon and covers us with quilts. I hollers and yells and  one the men say, 'Shet up, you nigger, or I'll kill you.' I told him,  'Kill me if you wants to--you stole me from my folks.'    \"Them men took us to New Orleans to the big slave market. I had long  hair and they cut it off like a boy and tried to sell me, but I told  them men what looks at me, the men cut my hair off and stole me. The man  what cut my hair off cursed me and said if I didn't hush he'd kill me,  but he couldn't sell us at New Orleans and took us to Jefferson.    \"I never knowed what they done with the other gal, but they sold me to  Marse Bill Tumlin, what run a big livery stable in Jefferson, and I  'longed to him till surrender. I lived in the house with them, 'cause  they had a boy and gal and I did for them. They bought me clothes and  took good care of me but I never seed no money till surrender. I et what  they et, after they got through. Missy say she didn't 'lieve in feedin'  the darkies scraps, like some folks.    \"I played with them two chillen all day, then sot the table. I was so  small I'd git in a chair to reach the dishes out of the safe. I had to  pull a long flybrush over the table whilst the white folks et.    \"Marse Tumlin had a farm 'bout four mile from town, and a overseer, and  I seed him buckle the niggers crost a log and whip them. Marse lived in  Jefferson, heself, and when he'd go to the farm he allus took his boy  with him. We'd be playin' in the barn and Marse call from the house,  'Come on, Jimmie, we're gwine to the farm.' Jimmie allus say to me,  'Come on, nigger, let's ride round the farm.' I'd say, 'I ain't no  nigger.' He'd say, 'Yes, you is, my pa paid $200 for you. He bought you  for to play with me.'    \"Jefferson was a good town till it burned up. I 'members the big fire  what looked like the whole town gwineter burn up.

He lives in       Beaumont, Texas.      \"I was plowing and hoeing before the freedom and I talk more of the  French 'cause I comes from St. Martinville Parish. I was born there in  Louisiana and my mama was Angeline Jean Pierre and she was slave born.  My papa was Olivier Blanchard and he white man carpenter on old  plantation.

They paddle  them clean on the rocks and then wash them in the water.    \"One time one big bayou 'gator come up and bite a woman's arm off. She  my sister in law. But they keep on washing the clothes in the bayou just  the same.    \"We have plenty to eat and peaches and muscadines and pecans, 'cause  there right smart woods and swamp there. We play in the woods and most  time in the bayou on boats with planks what would float. We had the good  time and had a little pet coon.
