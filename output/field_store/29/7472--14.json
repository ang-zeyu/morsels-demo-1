When this had been completed,  everyone except the doctor, Carnes, and Lieutenant Leffingwell left the  cave. These three crouched behind the search-light which sent a mild  beam of ultra-violet onto the platform where the steer was held. The  engine outside the cave was started, and the three men waited with tense  nerves.    For several hours nothing happened. The steer tried from time to time to  move and, finding it impossible, set up plaintive bellows for liberty.    \"I wish something would happen,\" muttered the lieutenant. \"This is  getting on my nerves.    \"Something is about to happen,\" replied Dr. Bird grimly. \"Listen to that  steer.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The bellowing of the steer had suddenly increased in volume and, added  to the note of discontent, was a note of fright which had previously  been absent. Dr. Bird bent over his ultra-violet search-light and made  some adjustments. He handed a helmetlike arrangement to each of his  companions and slipped one on over his head.    \"I can't see a thing, Doctor,\" said Carnes in a muffled voice.    \"The objects at which you are looking absorb rather than reflect  ultra-violet light,\" said the doctor. \"This is a sort of a fluoroscope  arrangement, and it isn't perfect at all. However, when the monster  comes along, I am pretty sure that you will be able to see it. You may  see a little more as your eyes get accustomed to it.\"    \"I can see very dimly,\" announced the lieutenant in a moment.    Dimly the walls of the cave and the platform before them began to take  vague shape. The three stared intently down the beam of ultra-violet  light which the doctor directed down the passageway leading deeper into  the cave.    \"Good Lord!\" ejaculated Carnes suddenly.    Slowly into the field of vision came the hideous figure they had seen on  the film. As it moved forward a rustling, slithering sound could be  heard, even over the bellowing of the steer and the hum of the  apparatus. The odor of musk became evident.    Along the floor toward them the thing slid. Presently it reared up on  its hind legs and its enormous bulk became evident. It turned somewhat  sideways and the correctness of Dr. Bird's hypothesis as to its peculiar  shape was proved. All of the bulk of the creature was in two dimensions.  Forward it moved, and the horrible human hands stretched forward, while  the mouth split in a wide, toothless grin. Nearer the doomed steer the  creature approached, and then the reaching hands closed on the animal.    There was a blinding flash, and the monster was hurled backward as  though struck by a thunderbolt, while a horrible smell of musk and  burned flesh filled the air.    \"After it! Quick!\" cried the doctor as he sprang forward.           *       *       *       *       *    Before he could reach the prostrate creature it moved and then, slowly  at first, but with rapidly gaining speed, it slithered over the floor in  retreat. Dr. Bird's hand swung through an arc, and there was a deafening  crash as a hand-grenade exploded on the back of the fleeing monster.    An unearthly scream came from the creature, and its motion changed from  a steady forward glide to a series of convulsive jerks. Leffingwell and  Carnes threw grenades, but they went wide of their mark, and the monster  began to again increase its speed. Another volley of grenades was thrown  and one hit scored, which slowed the monster somewhat but did not arrest  the steady forward movement.    \"Any more bombs?\" demanded the doctor.    \"Damn!\" he cried as he received negative answers. \"The current wasn't  strong enough. It's going to get away.\"    Carnes jerked his automatic from under his armpit and poured a stream of  bullets into the fleeing monster. Slower and slower the motion of the  creature became, and its movements again became jerky and convulsive.    \"Keep it in sight!\" cried the doctor. \"We may get it yet!\"    Cautiously the three men followed the retreating horror, Leffingwell  pushing before him the platform holding the ultra-violet ray apparatus.  The chase led them over familiar ground.    \"There is the crack!\" cried the lieutenant.    \"Too late!\" replied the doctor.    He rushed forward and seized the lower limb of the monster and tried  with all his strength to arrest its flight, but despite all that he  could do it slid sideways through the crack in the wall and disappeared.  A final backward kick of its leg threw the doctor twenty feet against  the far wall of the cave.    \"Are you hurt, Doctor?\" cried Carnes.    \"No, I'm all right. Put on your masks and start the gas! Quick! That may  stop it before it gets in far!\"           *       *       *       *       *    The three adjusted gas masks and thrust the mouths of two gas cylinders  which were on the light truck into the crack, and opened the valves. The  hissing of the gas was accompanied by a thrashing, writhing sound from  the bowels of the earth for a few minutes, but the sound retreated and  finally died away into an utter silence.    \"And that's that!\" cried the doctor half an hour later as they took off  their gas masks outside the cave. \"It got away from us. Carnes, how soon  can we get a train back to Washington?\"    \"What kind of a report are you going to make to the Bureau, Doctor?\"  asked Carnes as they sat in the smoker of a southern train, headed for  the capital.    \"I'm not going to put in any report, Carnes,\" replied the doctor. \"I  haven't got the creature or any part of it to show, and no one would  believe me. I am going to maintain a discreet silence about the whole  matter.\"    \"But you have your photograph to show, Doctor, and you have my evidence  and Lieutenant Leffingwell's.\"    \"The photograph might have been faked and I might have doped both of  you. In any case, your words are no better than mine. No, indeed,  Carnes, when I failed to make the current strong enough to kill it  outright I made the first of the moves which bind me to silence,  although I thought that two hundred thousand volts would be enough.    \"The second failure I made was when I missed him with my second grenade,  although I doubt if all six would have stopped him. My third failure was  when we failed to get a sufficient concentration of cyanide gas into  that hole in a hurry. The thing is so badly crippled that it will die,  but it may take hours, or even days, for it to do so. It has already  made its way so far into the earth that we couldn't reach it by blasting  without danger of bringing the whole place down on our heads. Even if we  could blast our way into the place it came from I wouldn't dare open a  path which would allow Lord only knows what terrible monsters to invade  the earth. When the soldiers have finished stopping that crack with ten  feet of solid masonry, I think the barrier will hold, even against that  critter's papa and mamma and all its relatives. Then Mammoth Cave will  be safe for visitors again. That latter fact is the only report which I  will make.\"    \"It is a dandy story to go to waste,\" said Carnes soberly.    \"Tell it then, if you wish, and get laughed at for your pains. No,  Carnes, you must learn one thing. A man like Bolton, for instance, will  implicitly believe that a four leaf clover in his watch-charm will bring  him good luck, and that carrying a buckeye keeps rheumatism away from  him; but tell him a bit of sober fact like this, attested by three  reliable witnesses and a good photograph, and you'll just get laughed at  for your pains. I'm going to keep my mouth shut.\"    \"So be it, then!\" replied Carnes with a sigh.          Phantoms of Reality    A COMPLETE NOVEL    _By Ray Cummings_    [Illustration: _The office room faded.... I was lying on another  floor.... New walls sprang around me._]    [Sidenote: Red Sensua's knife came up dripping--and the two adventurers  knew that chaos and bloody revolution had been unleashed in that shadowy  kingdom of the fourth dimension.]          CHAPTER I    _Wall Street--or the Open Road?_      When I was some fifteen years old, I once made the remark, \"Why, that's  impossible.\"    The man to whom I spoke was a scientist. He replied gently, \"My boy,  when you are grown older and wiser you will realize that nothing is  impossible.\"    Somehow, that statement stayed with me. In our swift-moving wonderful  world I have seen it proven many times. They once thought it impossible  to tell what lay across the broad, unknown Atlantic Ocean. They thought  the vault of the heavens revolved around the earth. It was impossible  for it to do anything else, because they could see it revolve. It was  impossible, too, for anything to be alive and yet be so small that one  might not see it. But the microscope proved the contrary. Or again, to  talk beyond the normal range of the human voice was impossible, until  the telephone came to show how simply and easily it might be done.    I never forgot that physician's remark. And it was repeated to me some  ten years later by my friend, Captain Derek Mason, on that memorable  June night of 1929.    My name is Charles Wilson. I was twenty-five that June of 1929. Although  I had lived all of my adult life in New York City, I had no relatives  there and few friends.           *       *       *       *       *    I had known Captain Mason for several years. Like myself, he seemed one  who walked alone in life. He was an English gentleman, perhaps thirty  years old. He had been stationed in the Bermudas, I understood, though  he seldom spoke of it.    I always felt that I had never seen so attractive a figure of a man as  this Derek Mason. An English aristocrat, he was, straight and tall and  dark, and rather rakish, with a military swagger. He affected a small,  black mustache.
