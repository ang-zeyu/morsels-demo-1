Old, feeble and poor, unable to borrow,       and ashamed to beg, he steals cuttings, and subjects himself to the       penalty assigned to theft. Aged beavers are often found dead with       gashes in their bodies, showing that they have been killed by their       mates. In the fall of 1864, a very aged beaver was caught in one of       the dams of the Esconawba River, and this was the reflection of a       great authority on the occasion, one Ah-she-goes, an Ojibwa       trapper: 'Had he escaped the trap he would have been killed before       the winter was over, by other beavers, for stealing cuttings.'         \"When the beavers are about two or three years old, their teeth are       in their best condition for cutting. On the Upper Missouri, they       cut the cotton tree and the willow bush; around Hudson's Bay and       Lake Superior, in addition to the willow they cut the poplar and       maple, hemlock, spruce and pine. The cutting is round and round,       and deepest upon the side on which they wish the tree to fall.       Indians and trappers have seen beavers cutting trees. The felling       of a tree is a family affair. No more than a single pair with two       or three young ones are engaged at a time. The adults take the       cutting in turns, one gnawing and the other watching; and       occasionally a youngster trying his incisors. The beaver whilst       gnawing sits on his plantigrade hind legs, which keep him       conveniently upright. When the tree begins to crackle the beavers       work cautiously, and when it crashes down they plunge into the       pond, fearful lest the noise should attract an enemy to the spot.       After the tree-fall, comes the lopping of the branches. A single       tree may be winter provision for a family. Branches five or six       inches thick have to be cut into proper lengths for transport, and       are then taken home.\"    The lodge of a beaver is generally about six feet in diameter, on the  inside, and about half as high. They are rounded or dome-shaped on the  outside, with very thick walls, and communicate with the land by  subterranean passages, below the depth at which the water freezes in  winter. Each lodge is made to accommodate several inmates, who have  their beds ranged round the walls, much as the Indian does in his tent.  They are very cleanly, too, and after eating, carry out the sticks that  have been stripped, and either use them in repairing their dam, or throw  them into the stream below.    During the summer months the beavers abandon their lodges, and disport  themselves about the streams, sometimes going on long journeys; or if  any remain at home, they are the mothers of young families. About the  last of August the community returns to its home, and begins  preparations for the domestic cares of the long winter months.    An exception to this rule is that of certain individuals, who have no  families, make no dam, and never live in lodges, but burrow in  subterranean tunnels. They are always found to be males, whom the French  trappers call \"les parasseux,\" or idlers; and the American trappers,  \"bachelors.\" Several of them are sometimes found in one abode, which the  trappers facetiously denominate \"bachelor's hall.\" Being taken with less  difficulty than the more domestic beaver, the trapper is always glad to  come upon their habitations.    The trapping season is usually in the spring and autumn. But should the  hunters find it necessary to continue their work in winter, they capture  the beaver by sounding on the ice until an aperture is discovered, when  the ice is cut away and the opening closed up. Returning to the bank,  they search for the subterranean passage, tracing its connection with  the lodge; and by patient watching succeed in catching the beaver on  some of its journeys between the water and the land. This, however, is  not often resorted to when the hunt in the fall has been successful; or  when not urged by famine to take the beaver for food.    \"Occasionally it happens,\" says Captain Bonneville, \"that several  members of a beaver family are trapped in succession. The survivors then  become extremely shy, and can scarcely be \"brought to medicine,\" to use  the trappers' phrase for \"taking the bait.\" In such case, the trapper  gives up the use of the bait, and conceals his traps in the usual paths  and crossing places of the household. The beaver being now completely  \"up to trap,\" approaches them cautiously, and springs them, ingeniously,  with a stick. At other times, he turns the traps bottom upwards, by the  same means, and occasionally even drags them to the barrier, and  conceals them in the mud. The trapper now gives up the contest of  ingenuity, and shouldering his traps, marches off, admitting that he is  not yet \"up to beaver.\"    Before the camp moved from the forks of the Snake River, the haunting  Blackfeet made their appearance openly. It was here that Meek had his  first battle with that nation, with whom he subsequently had many a  savage contest. They attacked the camp early in the morning, just as the  call to turn out had sounded. But they had miscalculated their  opportunity: the design having evidently been to stampede the horses and  mules, at the hour and moment of their being turned loose to graze. They  had been too hasty by a few minutes, so that when they charged on the  camp pell-mell, firing a hundred guns at once, to frighten both horses  and men, it happened that only a few of the animals had been turned out,  and they had not yet got far off. The noise of the charge only turned  them back to camp.    In an instant's time, Fitzpatrick was mounted, and commanding the men to  follow, he galloped at headlong speed round and round the camp, to drive  back such of the horses as were straying, or had been frightened from  their pickets. In this race, two horses were shot under him; but he  escaped, and the camp-horses were saved. The battle now was to punish  the thieves. They took their position, as usual with Indian fighters, in  a narrow ravine; from whence the camp was forced to dislodge them, at a  great disadvantage. This they did do, at last, after six hours of hard  fighting, in which a few men were wounded, but none killed. The thieves  skulked off, through the canyon, when they found themselves defeated,  and were seen no more until the camp came to the woods which cover the  western slope of the Rocky Mountains.    But as the camp moved eastward, or rather in a northeasterly direction,  through the pine forests between Pierre's Hole and the head-waters of  the Missouri, it was continually harrassed by Blackfeet, and required a  strong guard at night, when these marauders delighted to make an attack.  The weather by this time was very cold in the mountains, and chilled the  marrow of our young Virginian. The travel was hard, too, and the  recruits pretty well worn out.    One cold night, Meek was put on guard on the further side of the camp,  with a veteran named Reese. But neither the veteran nor the youngster  could resist the approaches of \"tired Nature's sweet restorer,\" and went  to sleep at their post of duty. When, during the night, Sublette came  out of his tent and gave the challenge--\"All's well!\" there was no  reply. To quote Meek's own language, \"Sublette came round the horse-pen  swearing and snorting. He was powerful mad. Before he got to where Reese  was, he made so much noise that he waked him; and Reese, in a loud  whisper, called to him, 'Down, Billy! Indians!' Sublette got down on his  belly mighty quick. 'Whar? whar?' he asked.    \"'They were right there when you hollered so,' said Reese.    \"'Where is Meek?' whispered Sublette.    \"'He is trying to shoot one,' answered Reese, still in a whisper.    \"Reese then crawled over to whar I war, and told me what had been said,  and informed me what to do. In a few minutes I crept cautiously over to  Reese's post, when Sublette asked me how many Indians had been thar, and  I told him I couldn't make out their number. In the morning a pair of  Indian moccasins war found whar Reese _saw the Indians_, which I had  _taken care to leave there_; and thus confirmed, our story got us the  credit of vigilance, instead of our receiving our just dues for neglect  of duty.\"    It was sometime during the fall hunt in the Pine Woods, on the west side  of the Rocky Mountains, that Meek had one of his earliest adventures  with a bear. Two comrades, Craig and Nelson, and himself, while out  trapping, left their horses, and traveled up a creek on foot, in search  of beaver. They had not proceeded any great distance, before they came  suddenly face to face with a red bear; so suddenly, indeed, that the men  made a spring for the nearest trees. Craig and Meek ascended a large  pine, which chanced to be nearest, and having many limbs, was easy to  climb. Nelson happened to take to one of two small trees that grew close  together; and the bear, fixing upon him for a victim, undertook to climb  after him. With his back against one of these small trees, and his feet  against the other, his bearship succeeded in reaching a point not far  below Nelson's perch, when the trees opened with his weight, and down  he went, with a shock that fairly shook the ground. But this bad luck  only seemed to infuriate the beast, and up he went again, with the same  result, each time almost reaching his enemy. With the second tumble he  was not the least discouraged; but started up the third time, only to be  dashed once more to the ground when he had attained a certain height. At  the third fall, however, he became thoroughly disgusted with his want of  success, and turned and ran at full speed into the woods.    \"Then,\" says Meek, \"Craig began to sing, and I began to laugh; but  Nelson took to swearing. 'O yes, you can laugh and sing now,' says"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39471"],[0,"Zoological Illustrations, Volume 1 (#14)"],[1,"hitherto  seen. The latter (here figured) came from Bahia in South America. The whole  shell is very finely marked with longitudinal striae, and the colouring  better seen than described: the buff tinge at the base is occasioned by the  remaining epidermis.    This shell belongs to the second division of the genus _Achatina_ as  mentioned at Plate 30, having the aperture much shorter than the spire and  the base nearly entire. _Bulla virginea_ of Linn. seems to connect the two  divisions, having the lengthened spire of one and the truncated base of the  other.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 37    [Illustration]    PROCNIAS cucullata.    _Hooded Berry-eater._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 21.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _P. corpore, collo, pectore nigro cucullata; tergo fusco, alis caudaque      nigris; tegminum apice, pectoris lateribus, et corpore subtus flavis;      capite subcristato._        Head, neck and fore-part of the breast hooded with black; back brown,      wings and tail black; tip of the wing-covers, sides of the breast and      body beneath yellow; head subcrested.           *       *       *       *       *    I am indebted for this new bird to Miss E.

Such is the case with the present  insect, which will not agree with any described by Fabricius, or figured by  Cramer.    During my travels in Brazil I never met with this species, but am indebted  to my liberal friend Dr. Langdorff, Russian Consul-general at Rio de  Janeiro, for the specimens I possess, as well as a number of other rare and  fine insects of this family, which were then not in my own collection.    On each side of the palpi adjoining the eye are two yellowish round dots,  and another behind: the posterior wings above have a narrow whitish margin,  the colour beneath much paler; but the nerves on this, as well as at the  tips of the anterior wings, are blackish-brown; the legs at the base and  the tarsi are black.    This is a male insect; the other sex I have not seen.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 40    [Illustration]    HESPERIA Cynisca.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 28.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _Hesp.

(Div. 2.) Wings blackish-brown; anterior above with a three-cleft      yellow band, which in the female is white; posterior beneath      immaculate, chesnut-brown, margined externally with yellow.           *       *       *       *       *    The different sexes of this insect will appear so strikingly dissimilar to  those who are familiarised only with the nice distinctions that separate  the species of European _Lepidoptera_, that this affinity by such may be  doubted; nevertheless, observations in their native country, and the close  examination of several specimens, will we are persuaded confirm the fact.    The male insect is distinguished (like all the _Hesperidae_) by having the  eyes considerably larger, and the anterior wings more narrowed than in the  other sex: in this species the bands on their wings assume the form of  three yellowish spots, adjoining which, on the inner side, is a  semi-lunular villous mark, an almost constant indication (where it exists)  of this sex. The straw-coloured border beneath the posterior wings is  narrower and darker than in the female; but in both it forms a slender  marginal fringe on the upper surface. Legs deep rufous; antennae black; the  club beneath and lunule round the eye straw-coloured.    Inhabits South Brazil, but is not common.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 41    [Illustration]    ACHATINA pallida,    _Pale Achatina._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 21.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _A._ (div. 2.) _testa cinereo-alba, fasciis duabus angustis fuscis,      spira elongata recta, anfractibus 7 sub-ventricosis, labio interiore      roseo, columella basi recta, integra, apertura ovato-oblonga_.

The shell now figured  might, on a cursory glance, very well pass for one of the Protean varieties  of the Linnaean _Bulla fasciata_; but a comparison with that shell will at  once point out the strong specific difference that exists between them in  the formation of the mouth. In this, the lower half of the inner lip, or  more properly the pillar, is nearly straight; the base entire, or without  any notch or truncated appearance: whereas in the true _A. fasciata_, the  inner lip at the base is very much curved inward, and notched before it  joins the outer lip. The mouth is also short and broad: whereas in this it  is much more oblong, and the base round. Other more obvious characters  exist in the form of the whorls, spire, and more particularly in the  colour, of these two shells; but these are in comparison of minor  importance.    I regret having but one example of this shell, as it prevents me from  tracing how far the characters here detailed hold good in other specimens.
