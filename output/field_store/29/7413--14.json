I had hard work to get out of the box without smiling, for even then the  pain in my head was acute, and I was not right for weeks after. I knew,  however, that my wound was a dangerous possession, and close attention  to my thick, soft hair, enabled me to hide it, always providing that it  was not too closely examined. My companion was less fortunate, and his  share of the proceedings, poor fellow, was \"two months.\"    [Illustration]    Here is the record of another encounter. There was a certain wood, the  timber in which had been felled and carted. It had previously contained  a good deal of \"coppice,\" and after the wood-cutters had done their  work, this had been utilized by the charcoal burners. The ashes from the  charcoal had promoted quite an unseasonable growth, and everywhere about  the stoles of the ash roots and hazel snags, fresh green grass and  clover were springing. The hares on the neighbouring estate had found  out this, and came nightly to the clearing to feed. As there were  neither gaps nor gates we found it impossible to net them, and so had to  resort to another device. Before the wood had been cleared rabbits had  swarmed in it, and these had found ingress and egress through \"smoots\"  in the stone fences. Upon examination we found that the larger of these  were regularly used by our quarry, and, as we could not net them, we  determined to plant a purse net at every smoot, drive the wood with fast  dogs, and so bag our game. When everything was ready the lurchers  commenced their work, and, thoroughly grasping the programme, worked up  to it admirably. Each dog that \"found\" drove its hare fast and furiously  (this was necessary), and, in an hour, a dozen were bagged. There was  only this disadvantage. The wood was so large, the smoots so far apart,  that many of the hares screamed for some seconds before they could be  dispatched. The continuance of this screaming brought up the keepers,  and our game was up, and with it what we had bagged. The watchers  numbered four or five, and, leaving everything, we ran. In our line of  retreat was an abandoned hut built by the charcoal burners, consisting  of poles, with heather and fern for roof and sides. We made for this,  hoping, in the darkness, to elude our pursuers, then double in our  tracks as soon as they had passed. But they were not so easily deceived.  As soon as the crackling of the dead sticks caused by our tread had  ceased, they evidently suspected some trick, and knew that we were still  in the wood. And the hut was the first object of search. As they were  quite unaware of our number they declined to enter, but invited us into  the open. We replied by barricading the narrow doorway with poles and  planks which we found within. Of course this was only completing our  imprisonment, but we felt that one or more of their number would be sent  for further help, and that then we would make a dash to escape. We  agreed to take off in different directions, to divide the attacking  force, and then lead them across the roughest country we could find. A  deep stream was not far off, and here we would probably escape. But our  scheme went wrong--or, rather, we had no opportunity to put it into  practice. After waiting and listening awhile we saw lights glisten in  the chinks of the heather walls, and then fumes of smoke began to creep  up them. They were burning us out. Quietly as we could we undid the  barricading, and, as the air rushed in, tiny tongues of flame shot up  the heather. Now we lay low with our faces on the damp floor. Then a  pole was thrust through. Another current of air and the flames shot  everywhere. The thick smoke nearly stifled us, and the heat became  intense. The fire ran up the poles, and burning bits of the heather roof  began to fall. Then came the crisis. A fir pole had been raised without,  and then was to crash through the hut. This was the first outside  proceeding we had seen--we saw it through the riddled walls. As soon as  the men loosed their hold of the tree for its fall we sprang from the  doorway; and then for a few seconds the sight was magnificent. As the  roof crashed in the whole hut was one bright mass of flame, and a sheet  of fire shot upwards into the night. The burning brackens and ling sent  out myriads of sparks, and these falling around gave us a few seconds'  start. As agreed, we each hurled a burning brand among the keepers, then  disappeared in the darkness. Certainly no one followed us out of the  wood. We had simply scored by lying low with the fire about us, taking  advantage of the confusion and dazzling light, and then knowing our way  out of the difficulty. The squire's son, we saw, was one of the  attacking party. We were a bit burnt, we lost the game and nets, but  were quite content to have escaped so easily.    [Illustration]    There is another incident which I have good cause to remember all my  life. It is of a somewhat different nature to the foregoing, and  occurred on the estuary of the river which I used frequently to net with  good results. Someone who was certainly not very friendly disposed had  seen me and my companion start for our fishing ground, and had made the  most of their knowledge. After getting to the near vicinity of our work,  we lay down beneath a hay-rick to wait for a degree of darkness. Then we  crawled on hands and knees by the side of a fence until it brought us to  a familiar pool which we knew to be well stocked with salmon and trout.  As we surveyed the water we heard voices, and knew that the pool was  watched. These sounds seemed to come from the lower limbs of a big tree,  and soon one of the watchers hidden in the branches stupidly struck a  match to light his pipe. This not only frescoed two forms against the  night, but lit up their faces with a red glow. The discovery was a  stroke of luck. We knew where we had the water bailiffs, and the rest  was easy. We got quietly away from the spot, and soon were at work in a  pool further up stream. No one but a gaunt heron objected to our  fishing, and we made a splendid haul. The salmon and sea-trout had begun  to run, and swarmed everywhere along the reaches. We hid our net in the  \"otter\" holes, and, under heavy loads, made for home across the meadows.  We were well aware that the local police changed duty at six in the  morning, and timed our entry into town precisely at that hour. But our  absence of the previous night had gone further abroad, and the local  Angling Association, the Conservancy Board, and the police had each  interested themselves in our doings. It was quite unsafe to hide the  spoil, as was usual, and home it must be carried. I was now alone. In  the open I felt comparatively safe, but as I neared my destination I  knew not whom I should meet round the next turn. Presently, however, it  seemed as though I was in luck. Every wall, every hedgerow, every  mound aided my going. Now a dash across an open field would land me  almost at my own door. Then I should be safe. I had hardly had time to  congratulate myself on my getting in unobserved when a constable, then a  second, and a third were all tearing down upon me from watch points,  where they had been in hiding. The odds were against me, but I grasped  my load desperately, drew it tightly upon my shoulders, and ran. The  police had thrown down their capes, and were rapidly gaining upon me. I  got into a long slouching trot, however, determined to make a desperate  effort to get in, where I should have been safe. This they knew. Strong  and fleet as I was I was too heavily handicapped, but I felt that even  though I fell exhausted on the other side of the door-way, I would gain  it. My pursuers--all heavy men--were blown, and in trouble, and I knew  there was now no obstacle before me. Now it was only a distance of  twenty yards--now a dozen. The great thuds of the men's feet were close  upon me, and they breathed like beaten horses. My legs trembled beneath  me, and I was blinded by perspiration. \"Seize him,\" \"seize him,\" gasped  the sergeant--but I was only a yard from the door. With a desperate  feeling that I had won, I grasped the handle and threw my whole weight  and that of my load against the door, only to find it--locked. I fell  back on to the stones, and the stern chase was ended.    For a minute nobody spoke--nobody was able to. I lay where I fell, and  the men leaned against what was nearest them. Then the sergeant  condescended to say \"poor beggar\"--and we all moved off. The fish were  turned out on the grass in the police station yard, and were a sight to  see. There were ninety trout, thirty-seven salmon-morts, and two salmon.  I was not detained. One of the men handed me a mort, telling me I would  be ready for a substantial breakfast. I knew what it all meant, and  first thought of bolting, then settled that I would do as I had always  done--face it out. But I little knew what this meant, as will  presently be seen. I knew sufficient of the law to forsee that I should  be charged with trespassing; with night poaching; with being in illegal  possession of fish; with illegally killing and taking salmon; perhaps  other counts besides. But what I did _not_ know was that I should be  charged, in addition, with being in illegal possession of one hundred  and twenty-nine salmon and trout _during the close season_.    [Illustration]    And this is how it came about. There had been an agitation throughout  the whole of the Conservancy district. It was contended that the fishing  season extended too far into Autumn by a fortnight--that by that time  the fish had begun to spawn. The old condition of things had held for  years, and the new Conservancy bye-laws had only just come into  operation. And so I was trapped. The case came on, and a great shoal of  magistrates with it. Two of them were personally interested, and were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36974"],[0,"Old Trails on the Niagara Frontier (#14)"],[1," ultimately the boys reached Albany and their friends. Then there is  the story of Nancy Bundy, who, her husband and children being killed,  was brought to Fort Niagara and sold into servitude for $8. There was  the famous Indian fighter, Moses Van Campen, whose adventures and  captivity in our region are the subject of a whole book. There were  Horatio Jones and Jasper Parrish, who passed from Indian captives into  the useful role of interpreters for the whites.    Thus I might go on, naming by the score the heroes and heroines of  Indian captivities whose sufferings and whose adventures make up the  most romantic chapter in our home annals, as yet for the most part  unwritten. But I take time now to dwell, briefly as possible, upon but  one of these captivities--one of the notable incidents during Col.  Bolton's time at Fort Niagara. This was the capture of the Gilbert  family. It made so great a stir, even in those days accustomed to war  and Indian raids, that in 1784 a little book was published in  Philadelphia giving the history of it. The original edition[14] has long  since been one of the scarcest of Americana. But in the unpublished  correspondence between Gen. Haldimand and the officers at Fort Niagara,  I find sundry allusions to \"the Quaker's family,\" and statements which  go to show that the British at least were disposed to treat them well,  and to effect their exchange as soon as possible. Notwithstanding, it  was a long and cruel captivity, and presents some features of peculiar  significance in our local history.    About sunrise on the morning of April 25, 1780, a party of eleven  painted Indians suddenly issued from the woods bordering Mahoning Creek,  in Northampton County, Penn. They had come from Fort Niagara, and were  one of those scalping parties for the success of which so many  encouraging messages had passed from Whitehall to Quebec, and from  Quebec to the frontier, and to stimulate which Guy Johnson had been so  lavish with the fine linen, silver ornaments and port wine. The party  was commanded by Rowland Montour, John Montour being second in command.  Undiscovered, they surrounded the log house of the old Quaker miller,  Benjamin Gilbert. With tomahawk raised and flint-locks cocked they  suddenly appeared at door and windows. The old Quaker offered his hand  as a brother. It was refused. Partly from the Quaker habit of  non-resistance, partly from the obvious certainty that to attempt to  escape meant death, the whole household submitted to be bound, while  their home was plundered and burned. Loading three of Gilbert's horses  with booty, and placing heavy packs on the back of each prisoner old  enough to bear them, the expedition took the trail for Fort Niagara,  more than 200 miles away. This was \"war\" in \"the good old days.\"    There were twelve prisoners in the party, of whom but five were men.  The patriarch of the household, Benjamin, was sixty-nine years old;  Elizabeth, his wife, was fifty-five; Joseph, Benjamin's son by a former  wife, aged forty-one; another son, Jesse, aged nineteen, and his wife  Sarah, the same age. There were three younger children, Rebecca, Abner  and Elizabeth, respectively sixteen, fourteen and twelve; Thomas Peart,  son to Benjamin Gilbert's wife by a former husband, aged twenty-three; a  nephew, Benjamin Gilbert, aged eleven; a hired man, Andrew Harrigar,  twenty-six; and Abigail Dodson, the fourteen-year-old daughter of a  neighbor; she had had the ill-luck to come to Gilbert's mill that  morning for grist, and was taken with the rest. Half a mile distant  lived Mrs. Gilbert's oldest son, Benjamin Peart, aged twenty-seven, his  wife Elizabeth, who was but twenty, and their nine-months-old child.  Montour added these to his party, making fifteen prisoners in all,  burned their house and urged all along the trail, their first stop being  near \"Mochunk.\" (Mauch Chunk.)    I must omit most of the details of their march northward. On the evening  of the first day Benjamin Peart fainted from fatigue and Rowland Montour  was with difficulty restrained from tomahawking him. At night the men  prisoners were secured in a way which was usual on these raids,  throughout Western New York and Pennsylvania, during those dismal years.  The Indians cut down a sapling five or six inches in diameter, and cut  notches in it large enough to receive the ankles of the prisoners. After  fixing their legs in these notches, they placed another pole over the  first, and thus secured them as in stocks. This upper pole was then  crossed at each end by stakes driven into the ground. The prisoners thus  lay on the ground, on their backs. Straps or ropes around their necks  were made fast to near-by trees. Sometimes a blanket was granted them  for covering, sometimes not. What rest might be had, preparatory to  another day's forced march, I leave to the imagination.    During the early stages of this march the old couple were constantly  threatened with death, because unable to keep up. On the fourth day four  negroes who claimed that they were loyal to the King, that they had  escaped from the Americans and had set out for Fort Niagara, were taken  up by Montour from a camp where he had left them on his way down the  valley. These negroes frequently whipped and tortured the prisoners for  sport, Montour making no objection. On the 4th of May, the Indians  separated into two companies; one taking the westward path, and with  this party went Thomas Peart, Joseph Gilbert, Benjamin Gilbert--the  little boy of eleven--and Sarah, wife of Jesse. The others kept on the  northerly course. Andrew Harrigar, terrified by the Indian boast that  those who had gone with the other party \"were killed and scalped, and  you may expect the same fate tonight,\" took a kettle, under pretence of  bringing water, but ran away under cover of darkness. After incredible  hardships he regained the settlements. His escape so angered Rowland  Montour that he threw Jesse Gilbert down, and lifted his tomahawk for  the fatal blow; Elizabeth, Jesse's mother, knelt over him, pressed her  head to her son's brow and begged the captain to spare his life. Montour  kicked her over and tied them both by their necks to a tree; after a  time, his passion cooling, he loosed them, bade them pack up and take  the trail. This is but a sample incident. I pass over many.    None suffered more on the march than Elizabeth Peart, the girl mother.  The Indians would not let her husband relieve her by carrying her child,  and she was ever the victim of the whimsical moods of her captors. At  one time they would let her ride one of the horses; at another, would  compel her to walk, carrying the child, and would beat her if she lagged  behind. By the 14th of May Elizabeth Gilbert had become so weak that she  could only keep the trail when led and supported by her children. On  this day the main party was rejoined by a portion of the party that had  branched off to westward; with them were two of the four captives,  Benjamin Gilbert, Jr., and Sarah, wife of Jesse. On this day old  Benjamin was painted black, the custom of the Indians with prisoners  whom they intended to kill. Later on they were joined by British  soldiers, who took away the four negroes and did something to alleviate  the sufferings of the white prisoners. The expedition had exhausted its  provisions and all that had been taken from the Gilberts. A chance  hedgehog, and roots dug in the woods, sustained them for some days. May  the 17th they ferried across the Genesee River on a log raft.  Provisions were brought from Fort Niagara, an Indian having been sent  ahead, on the best horse; and on the morning of the 21st of May they  heard, faintly booming beyond the intervening forest, the morning gun at  Fort Niagara. An incident of that day's march was a meeting with  Montour's wife. She was the daughter of the great Seneca Sayenqueraghta,  the man who led the Indians at Wyoming,[15] and whose influence was  greater in this region, at the time we are studying, than even that of  Brant himself. He was the Old King of the Senecas, called Old Smoke by  the whites. Smoke's Creek, the well-known stream which empties into Lake  Erie just beyond the southwest limit of Buffalo, between South Park and  Woodlawn Beach, preserves his name to our day. It was there that he  lived in his last years; and somewhere on its margin, in a now unknown  grave, he was buried. His daughter the \"Princess,\" was, next to Molly  Brant, the grandest Indian woman of the time on the Niagara. As she met  the wretched Gilberts, \"she was dressed altogether in the Indian  costume, and was shining with gold lace and silver baubles.\" To her  Rowland Montour presented the girl Rebecca, as a daughter. The princess  took a silver ring from her finger and put it on Rebecca's, which act  completed the adoption of this little Quaker maid of sixteen into one  of the most famous--possibly the most infamous--family of the Niagara  region during the Revolutionary period.    At a village not far from Fort Niagara, apparently near the present  Tuscarora village on the heights east of Lewiston, Montour painted  Jesse, Abner, Rebecca and Elizabeth Gilbert, Jr., as Indians are  painted, and gave each a belt of wampum; but while these marks of favor  were shown to the young people, the mother, because of her feebleness,  was continually the victim of the displeasure and the blows of the  Indians. On May 23d, being at the Landing--what is now Lewiston--they  were visited by Captains Powell and Dace from the fort, and the next  day, just one month from the time of their capture, they trudged down  the trail which is now the pleasant river road, towards the old fort,  protected with difficulty from the blows of the Indians along the way.    Now followed the dispersion of this unhappy family. After the Indian  custom, the young and active prisoners were sought by the Indians for  adoption. Many brave American boys"]]]
