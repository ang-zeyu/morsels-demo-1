She had noticed, when Robert went to the  door at seven and she closed it after him, that some snow was falling.  But she had not thought of it again. She had kissed him, told him to  keep up good heart, and had come back to her baby.    Then the doctor told her that the storm which had begun before daybreak  had been gathering more and more severely; that the drifts were already  heavier than he remembered them in all his Boston life; that after half  an hour's trial in his sleigh he had been glad to get back to the stable  with his horse; and that all he had done since he had done on foot, with  difficulty she could not conceive of. He had been so long down stairs  while he brushed the snow off, that he might be fit to come near the  child.    \"And really, Mrs. Walter, we are doing so well here,\" he said  cheerfully, \"that I will not try to come round this afternoon, unless  you see a change. If you do, your husband must come up for me, you know.  But you will not need me, I am sure.\"    Mary felt quite brave to think that they should not need him really for  twenty-four hours, and said so; and added, with the first smile he had  seen for a fortnight: \"I do not know anybody to whom it is of less  account than to me, whether the streets are blocked or open. Only I am  sorry for you.\"    Poor Mary, how often she thought of that speech, before Christmas day  went by! But she did not think of it all through St. Victoria's day. Her  husband did not come home to dinner. She did not expect him. The  children came from school at two, rejoicing in the long morning session  and the half holiday of the afternoon which had been earned by it. They  had some story of their frolic in the snow, and after dinner went  quietly away to their little play-room in the attic. And Mary sat with  her baby all the afternoon,--nor wanted other company. She could count  his breathing now, and knew how to time it by the watch, and she knew  that it was steadier and slower than it was the day before. And really  he almost showed an appetite for the hourly dole. Her husband was not  late. He had taken care of that, and had left the shop an hour early.  And as he came in and looked at the child from the other side of the  crib, and smiled so cheerfully on her, Mary felt that she could not  enough thank God for his mercy.      III.    ST. VICTORIA'S DAY IN THE COUNTRY.    Five and twenty miles away was another mother, with a baby born the same  day as Jamie. Mary had never heard of her and never has heard of her,  and, unless she reads this story, never will hear of her till they meet  together in the other home, look each other in the face, and know as  they are known. Yet their two lives, as you shall see, are twisted  together, as indeed are all lives, only they do not know it--as how  should they?    A great day for Huldah Stevens was this St. Victoria's day. Not that she  knew its name more than Mary did. Indeed it was only of late years that  Huldah Stevens had cared much for keeping Christmas day. But of late  years they had all thought of it more; and this year, on Thanksgiving  day, at old Mr. Stevens's, after great joking about the young people's  housekeeping, it had been determined, with some banter, that the same  party should meet with John and Huldah on Christmas eve, with all  Huldah's side of the house besides, to a late dinner or early supper, as  the guests might please to call it. Little difference between the meals,  indeed, was there ever in the profusion of these country homes. The men  folks were seldom at home at the noon-day meal, call it what you will.  For they were all in the milk-business, as you will see. And, what with  collecting the milk from the hill-farms, on the one hand, and then  carrying it for delivery at the three o'clock morning milk-train, on the  other hand, any hours which you, dear reader, might consider systematic,  or of course in country life, were certainly always set aside. But,  after much conference, as I have said, it had been determined at the  Thanksgiving party that all hands in both families should meet at John  and Huldah's as near three o'clock as they could the day before  Christmas; and then and there Huldah was to show her powers in  entertaining at her first state family party.    So this St. Victoria's day was a great day of preparation for Huldah,  if she had only known its name, as she did not. For she was of the kind  which prepares in time, not of the kind that is caught out when the  company come with the work half done. And as John started on his  collection beat that morning at about the hour Robert, in town, kissed  Mary good-by, Huldah stood on the step with him, and looked with  satisfaction on the gathering snow, because it would make better  sleighing the next day for her father and mother to come over. She  charged him not to forget her box of raisins when he came back, and to  ask at the express if anything came up from town, bade him good-by, and  turned back into the house, not wholly dissatisfied to be almost alone.  She washed her baby, gave him his first lunch and put him to bed. Then,  with the coast fairly clear,--what woman does not enjoy a clear coast,  if it only be early enough in the morning?--she dipped boldly and wisely  into her flour-barrel, stripped her plump round arms to their work, and  began on the pie-crust which was to appear to-morrow in the fivefold  forms of apple, cranberry, Marlboro', mince, and squash,--careful and  discriminating in the nice chemistry of her mixtures and the nice  manipulations of her handicraft, but in nowise dreading the issue. A  long, active, lively morning she had of it. Not dissatisfied with the  stages of her work, step by step she advanced, stage by stage she  attained of the elaborate plan which was well laid out in her head, but,  of course, had never been intrusted to words, far less to tell-tale  paper. From the oven at last came the pies,--and she was satisfied with  the color; from the other oven came the turkey, which she proposed to  have cold,--as a relay, or _piece de resistance_, for any who might not  be at hand at the right moment for dinner. Into the empty oven went the  clove-blossoming ham, which, as it boiled, had given the least  appetizing odor to the kitchen. In the pretty moulds in the woodshed  stood the translucent cranberry hardening to its fixed consistency. In  other moulds the obedient calf's foot already announced its willingness  and intention to \"gell\" as she directed. Huldah's decks were cleared  again, her kitchen table fit to cut out \"work\" upon,--all the pans and  plates were put away, which accumulate so mysteriously where cooking is  going forward; on its nail hung the weary jigger, on its hook the spicy  grater, on the roller a fresh towel. Everything gave sign of victory,  the whole kitchen looking only a little nicer than usual. Huldah herself  was dressed for the afternoon, and so was the baby; and nobody but as  acute observers as you and I would have known that she had been in  action all along the line and had won the battle at every point, when  two o'clock came, the earliest moment at which her husband ever  returned.    Then for the first time it occurred to Huldah to look out doors and see  how fast the snow was gathering. She knew it was still falling. But the  storm was a quiet one, and she had had too much to do to be gaping out  of the windows. She went to the shed door, and to her amazement saw that  the north wood-pile was wholly drifted in! Nor could she, as she stood,  see the fences of the roadway!    Huldah ran back into the house, opened the parlor door and drew up the  curtain, to see that there were indeed no fences on the front of the  house to be seen. On the northwest, where the wind had full  sweep,--between her and the barn, the ground was bare. But all that  snow--and who should say how much more?--was piled up in front of her;  so that unless Huldah had known every landmark, she would not have  suspected that any road was ever there. She looked uneasily out at the  northwest windows, but she could not see an inch to windward: dogged  snow--snow--snow--as if it would never be done.    Huldah knew very well then that there was no husband for her in the next  hour, nor most like in the next or the next. She knew very well too what  she had to do; and, knowing it, she did it. She tied on her hood, and  buttoned tight around her her rough sack, passed through the shed and  crossed that bare strip to the barn, opened the door with some  difficulty, because snow was already drifting into the doorway, and  entered. She gave the cows and oxen their water and the two night horses  theirs,--went up into the loft and pitched down hay enough for  all,--went down stairs to the pigs and cared for them,--took one of the  barn shovels and cleared a path where she had had to plunge into the  snow at the doorway, took the shovel back, and then crossed home again  to her baby. She thought she saw the Empsons' chimney smoking as she  went home, and that seemed companionable. She took off her over-shoes,  sack, and hood, said aloud, \"This will be a good stay-at-home day,\"  brought round her desk to the kitchen table, and began on a nice long  letter to her brother Cephas in Seattle.    That letter was finished, eight good quarto pages written, and a long  delayed letter to Emily Tabor, whom Huldah had not seen since she was  married; and a long pull at her milk accounts had brought them up to  date,--and still no John. Huldah had the table all set, you may be sure  of that; but, for herself, she had had no heart to go through the  formalities of lunch or dinner. A cup of tea and something to eat with  it as she wrote did better, she thought, for her,--and she could eat  when the men came. It is a way women have. Not till it became quite  dark, and she set her kerosene lamp in the window that he might have a  chance to see it when he turned the"]]]
