[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31987"],[0,"Territory in Bird Life (#14)"],[1," me, and as the growing reeds were only a few  inches in height, a female could scarcely have escaped detection. Yet  time and again disputes arose, and males pursued and pecked one  another, striving to attain that isolation for which racial preparation  had fitted them.    But on account of their violence, or their novelty, or because the  absence of a female was beyond question, some battles stand out in one's  memory more prominently than others. An instance of this was a struggle  between two Whitethroats which happened in the latter part of April and  lasted for three successive days. The scene of its occurrence was more  or less the same on each occasion, and the area over which the birds  wandered was comparatively small. The fighting was characterised by  persistent effort and was of a most determined kind, and so engrossed  did the assailants become that they even fluttered to the ground at my  feet. No trace of a female was to be seen at any time during these three  days, nor, during the pauses in the conflict, was the emotional  behaviour of a kind which led me to suppose that a female was anywhere  in the vicinity. And, if she had been near, she must have made her  presence known, for the belief that she is a timid creature, skulking on  such occasions in the undergrowth, is by no means borne out by  experience.    Even more impressive was a battle between two male Cuckoos. It occurred  high up in the air above the tops of some tall elm-trees which roughly  marked the boundary line between their respective areas, and the actions  of the birds were plainly visible. At the moment of actual collision  the opponents were generally in a vertical position, and wings, feet,  and beaks were made use of in turn; one could plainly see them strike at  one another with their feet, and one could observe the open bill which  generally denotes exhaustion, but may of course have been due to anger,  or used as a means of producing terror. Yet no female appeared in the  locality until six days after the occurrence of this struggle--and  she certainly is not easily overlooked, for her note is unmistakable  even when the behaviour of the male does not betray her arrival.    [Illustration: Male Cuckoos fighting before the arrival of a female    Emery Walker ph.sc.]    That the actual presence of the respective females exercised any  influence on the course of these struggles is more than doubtful. Not  only did one fail to detect them, but one's failure to do so was  confirmed by the knowledge that they had not yet arrived in those  particular localities. Hence the fact of the male preceding the female  is a valuable aid to the interpretation of subsequent behaviour; and one  appreciates it the more after having experienced the difficulty of  deciding whether she is present during the conflicts between resident  males, for no matter how carefully we may observe the conditions which  lead up to, and which accompany, such conflicts, or how closely we may  scrutinise the surrounding trees, undergrowth, or ground, there always  remains the possibility that she may, after all, have been overlooked.  But this must not be taken to imply that in such cases direct  observation alone can lead to no serviceable result, or that the  evidence gained therefrom is worthless. Far from it. Failure to detect a  female is so very common an occurrence that, even if we lacked the  corroborative evidence supplied in the life of the migratory male, it  would still be unreasonable to suppose that it were solely due to  mistaken observation. We mark her absence during the conflicts between  the respective males of many common species--the Finches, Buntings, and  Thrushes that occupy their territories early in the season when the  hedgerows and trees are still bare; but more frequently amongst those  that inhabit open ground, because the movements of the birds are there  more accessible to observation. For instance, half a dozen or more  Lapwings can be kept in view at the same time, and as they stand at dawn  in solitary state, keeping watch upon their respective territories, they  are conspicuous objects on the short, frosted grass; no stranger can  enter the arena without the observer being aware of it, no commotion can  occur but one detects it, no movement however small need be missed. And  so they fight, in a manner which leaves no doubt as to the reality of  the struggle, when their prospective mates are absent not only from the  particular territories in which the conflicts take place, but absent too  from those adjoining.    If the fact that males fight before they are paired and in the absence  of a female could be placed beyond all question, it would no longer be  possible to regard her possession as the end for which they are  contending, and consequently there would be no need to produce further  evidence. But the examples which I have given refer, of course, to only  a few migrants and a few residents--and moreover it must be admitted  that a female _is_ often conspicuous during the battles--so that by  themselves they must be regarded, and rightly so, as inconclusive. We  must therefore pass on to consider evidence of a somewhat different  character.    I spoke of the complexity of the strife. By this I mean that it is not  merely a matter of disputes between adjoining males, but that it is a  far more comprehensive business involving both sexes. Thus female fights  with female and pair with pair, or a male will attack a female, or,  again, a pair will combine against a single male or a single female. And  from all this complexity of strife we gain much valuable evidence in  regard to the question immediately before us. For when one pair attacks  another, or males that are definitely paired fight with one another, or  an unpaired male attacks either sex of a neighbouring pair  indiscriminately, there is surely little ground for supposing that the  possession of a mate is the reason of it all.    The battles between pairs of the same species are by no means uncommon.  Observe, for example, the central pair of three pairs of Reed-Buntings  occupying adjoining territories, and keep a daily record of the routine  of activity practised by both sexes during the early hours of the  morning; then, at the close of the season, summarise all the fighting  under different headings, and it will be found that the number of  occasions upon which the central pair attacked, or was attacked by,  neighbouring pairs will form a considerable portion of the whole.    Or watch the Moor-Hen, and for the purpose choose some sheet of water  large enough to accommodate three or more pairs, and so situated that  the birds can always be kept in view. Early in February the pool will be  haunted by numbers of individuals of both sexes, all swimming about  together, and, if the pool is surrounded by arable land, wandering over  that land subject to no territorial restrictions, apparently free to  seek food where they will. But as time goes by, their number gradually  decreases until a few pairs only remain, and these will occupy definite  areas. If careful watch is then kept and the relations of the pairs  closely studied, there will be no difficulty in observing the particular  kind of warfare to which I am alluding, and it will be noticed that the  encounters are of a particularly violent description. Thus two pairs  approach one another, and, when they meet, throw themselves upon their  backs, each bird striking at its adversary with its feet or seizing hold  of it with its beak; and though, in the commotion that ensues, it is  almost impossible to determine what exactly is happening, there is  reason to believe that the sexes attack one another indiscriminately.    A struggle between two pairs of Pied Wagtails is worth mentioning. It  impressed itself upon my memory because of the unusual vigour with which  it was conducted. The battle lasted for fifteen minutes or more, and  the four birds, collecting together, pursued and attacked one  another--at one moment in the air, at another upon the roof of a house  where they would alight and flutter about on the slates, uttering their  call-note without ceasing--until finally they disappeared from view,  still, however, continuing the struggle.    [Illustration: Two pairs of Pied Wagtails fighting in defence of their  territories.    Emery Walker ph.sc.]    Such is the nature of the warfare which prevails between neighbouring  pairs, and which can be observed in the life of many other species--the  Chaffinch, Stonechat, Blackbird, Partridge, Jay, to mention but a few.    The conflicts between males that are definitely paired are of such  common occurrence that it is scarcely necessary to mention specific  instances. But the occasions on which a male attacks either sex of a  neighbouring pair indiscriminately, or on which a pair combine to attack  a female, are less frequent.    Now if it be true that males fight for no other purpose than to gain  possession of a mate, what meaning are we to attach to the battles  between the pairs, or what explanation are we to give of the fact that  paired males are so frequently hostile? Those who hold this view will  probably argue thus: \"The presence of the female is the condition under  which the pugnacious instinct of the male is rendered susceptible to  appropriate stimulation, and the stimulus is supplied by a rival male;  we admit that all the fighting which occurs after pairing has taken  place has nothing to do strictly speaking with gaining a mate, but,  inasmuch as the fact of possession is always liable to be  challenged--and no male can differentiate between a paired and an  unpaired intruder--we contend that it would add to the security of  possession if the pugnacious instinct remained susceptible to  stimulation so long as there were any possibility of challenge from an  unpaired male; and we think that the waste of energy involved in the  struggles between"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32023"],[0,"The Boy's Voice (#14)"],[1,"Mr. Sergison, which explain his success as a  choirmaster.      ST. MARK'S COLLEGE, CHELSEA.    This is a Training College for schoolmasters, which has long been noted  for its musical services. Mr. Owen Breden, the present organist and  choirmaster, is the successor of Dr. Hullah, Mr. May, and the Rev. F.  Helmore. The choir-boys, who number 26, only sing on Sundays. They are  drawn from the practicing school, which contains 800 boys. They enter  the choir at nine years of age, and there are always six or eight  probationers, who attend the practices and are ready to fill vacancies.  Thus a good style of singing is maintained. People say to Mr. Breden,  \"There is no telling one voice from another, your boys are so much  alike.\" At the bi-weekly practice with Mr. Breden the boys have  voice-training. They sing to _la_ and sol-fa syllables scales gradually  rising. They are not trained above G, but if a boy has a good G he can  always go higher. The boys can all read from the Sol-fa modulator, and  Mr. Breden gives them ear-tests. The alto part is taken entirely by boys  at St. Mark's. The choir-boys, past and present, perform an operetta in  costume every Christmas. Anthems like Macfarren's \"The Lord is my  Shepherd,\" Bennett's \"God is a Spirit,\" Goss's \"O Saviour of the world,\"  &c., are sung unaccompanied. In fact, whenever the organ part merely  duplicates the voices, they take the opportunity at St. Mark's to enjoy  the pure chording of human voices.      ST. MARY'S CHURCH, BERLIN.    My friend, Herr Th. Krause, the organist and choirmaster of this church,  allowed me to attend a rehearsal of the eighty boys and twenty men who  form his fine choir. The large number of boys is explained by the fact  that nearly half of them are altos. The motet of the Lutheran church is  invariably unaccompanied. It closely resembles in form our anthem, but  the German Protestants look upon the _a capella_ style, which continues  the tradition of the Sistine Chapel at Rome, as the purest and highest  in church music. On no account would they use the organ to accompany a  motet. This gives rise to elaborate compositions, often like  Mendelssohn's \"Judge me, O God,\" in eight parts. By treating the boys  and men as separate choirs, each in four parts, and getting responses  between them, a variety of tone colour, which is almost orchestral, is  obtained; and when both choirs unite in solid eight-part harmony, the  result is imposing. As the Germans are usually not sight-singers, the  labour involved in learning these motets is immense. The higher register  of the boys is well trained. They sing up to B flat without effort, and  with purest tone. The same may be said of the Dom Choir, for which  Mendelssohn wrote his motets. At my last visit to Leipzig, I carried an  introduction to Dr. Rust, trainer of the Thomas Church choir, but I was  there just after Whitsuntide, when the yearly shifting of classes had  just taken place, and Dr. Rust, who wished me to hear his boys at their  best, asked me not to come to a rehearsal. Speaking generally, the  voices of German boys are thinner than those of English boys, more like  fifes than flutes.      ST. CLEMENT DANES, STRAND.    The choirmaster here, Mr. F. J. Knapp, is also master of the parish day  school. Here he insists on quiet singing, and stops coarseness directly.  The boys are taught on the Tonic Sol-fa system, which, says Mr. Knapp,  has alone enabled him to produce his results. Some time ago at St.  Stephens, Walworth, he was called upon to produce a choir in a week, and  he did this, by nightly rehearsals, to the satisfaction of everyone.  Complete oratorios, with band, were frequently given by this choir of  sol-faists. At St. Clement Danes he had to produce a choir in five days,  and here again he succeeded by the use of Tonic Sol-fa. \"Our  choir-boys,\" he says, \"can now sing at sight almost anything I put  before them. We never have more than two or three practices (one only,  full) for the most difficult anthems we do. There is an anthem every  Sunday, a choral communion once a month, offertory sentences on  alternate Sundays, cantatas and oratorios at Festivals.\" Mr. Knapp  adopts the useful plan of \"tuning-up\" his boys before the morning  service. Flattening, when it occurs, is due, he considers, to damp  weather, a cold church, &c. But he is rarely troubled with it. The boys'  voice exercises are taken at the harmonium, first slow notes to  \"koo-ah,\" or to \"oo-ay-ah-ee,\" or to a sentence containing consonants.  This exercise is done both ascending and descending, but especially  descending. He also uses the chromatic scale from B flat up to  F:--[Illustration: A music staff with a treble clef on the left. Two  quarter notes: B flat below the staff and F on the top line.] He tells  the boys nothing about the registers, but watches constantly against  shouting.      SALZUNGEN CHOIR.    This (Protestant) choir of men and boys is well-known in Germany, and  not only sings at Salzungen, but occasionally makes tours, and gives  concerts. Herr Muehlfeld, the trainer, tells me that he takes the boys  from 11 years of age upwards, and that before entering the choir they  have a fair knowledge of notes, and can sing at sight. The voices are  examined on entry, low ones being put to sing alto, and high ones being  put to sing soprano. The boys have two lessons of an hour each per week,  in which they practise exercises, _choraele_, school songs, and church  music. Flattening, according to Herr Muehlfeld, is due to (1) bad ear,  (2) imperfect training, (3) fatigue of the voice. The boys are taught to  listen to each note that they sing, and to make it blend with the  instrument or the leading voice. In order to do this they must sing  softly, and thus hear their neighbours' voices. The 3rd, 6th, 7th, and  8th tones of the scale are, says Herr Muehlfeld, often sung flat, and  exercises should be specially given to secure the intonation of these  sounds. The boys must also learn the intervals, and whenever they appear  to be tired a pause must be made.      UPTON CROSS BOARD SCHOOL.    This is not a church, but a boys' school, from which a good many  choristers are drawn, and where excellent results have been obtained.  The boys have often won prizes in choral competitions. Mr. H. A. Donald,  the headmaster, tells me that he examines the voices of the boys one by  one in his own room, once a year. Those who can take G and A  [Illustration: musical notation] sweetly and easily are put down as  first trebles. Those who can go below C [Illustration: musical notation]  are altos. The rest are second trebles. He finds that after a year a  boy's voice will often have changed--a treble become an alto, or vice  versa. In modulator practice, and as far as possible in pieces of music,  he keeps the trebles above [Illustration: musical notation]. Below this  they get coarse. He never gives on the modulator an ascending passage  which begins below this G. One may leap up, and come down by step, but  not ascend by step. He uses Mr. Proudman's \"Voice-training Exercises\"  (J. Curwen & Sons) for first trebles, and his contralto exercises for  contraltos. Coarseness he checks at once, and he silences boys whose  voices are breaking.    [Illustration: Decoration]          CHAPTER XIII.    ALTO BOYS.      How is the alto part, in a church choir consisting of males, to be sung?  In our cathedrals this part has been given, ever since the Restoration,  to adult men, generally with bass voices singing in their \"thin\"  register. For this voice our composers of the English cathedral school  wrote, carrying the part much lower than they would have done if they  had been writing for women or boy-singers. For this voice, also, Handel  wrote, and the listener at the Handel Festival cannot but feel the  strength and resonance which the large number of men altos give to the  harmony when the range of the part is low. The voice of the man alto,  however, was never common, and is becoming less common than it was. It  occupies a curious position, never having been recognised as a solo  voice. I have heard of an exceptionally good man alto at Birmingham who  was accustomed to sing songs at concerts, but this is an isolated case.  The voice seems to have been generally confined to choral music.    This voice is entirely an English institution, unknown on the continent.  Historians say that after the Restoration, when it was very difficult to  obtain choir-boys, adult men learned to sing alto, and even low treble  parts, in falsetto, in order to make harmony possible.    Let us concede at once that for music of the old cathedral school this  voice is in place. The churches are, however, getting more and more  eclectic, and are singing music from oratorios, cantatas, and masses  that was composed for women altos, and is far too high in compass for  men. We may admit that because the alto part lies so much upon the break  into the thick or chest register of boys, it is very difficult to get  them to sing it well. The dilemma is that in parish churches, especially  in country places, the adult male alto is not to be had, and the choice  is between boy altos, and no altos at all.    There is no doubt, moreover, that the trouble of voice-management in boy  altos can be conquered by watchfulness and care. At the present time  there are, as the information I have collected shows, a number of very  good cathedral and church choirs in which the alto part is being  sustained by boys.           *       *       *       *       *    The following is from Mr. James Taylor, organist and choirmaster of New  College, Oxford:--    \"New College, Oxford, _Dec._ 13, 1890.    \"Dear Sir,--In reply to your letter, I can confidently recommend boy  altos in parish or other choirs, provided they are carefully trained. We  have introduced them into this choir for more than two years, and the  experiment has fully come up to my expectations."]]]
