But now let us return to the kingdom of God organized in the days of  the Apostles; you discover that three thousand persons were adopted  into the kingdom the first day the door was opened. These, together  with the numerous additions which were afterwards made, were the  subjects of this kingdom; which, being fitly framed together, grew  into a holy temple in the Lord. Thus, we have cleared away the rubbish  of sectarian tradition and superstition, which arose in heaps around  us; and having searched carefully, we have at length discovered the  kingdom of God, as it existed at its first organization in the days of  the Apostles; and we have seen that it differs widely from all modern  systems of religion, both in its offices, ordinances, powers, and  privileges, insomuch that no man need ever mistake the one for the  other.    Having made this discovery, we shall proceed to examine the progress  of the kingdom among Jew and Gentile; and what were its fruits, gifts,  and blessings as enjoyed by its citizens.    Soon after the organization of the kingdom of God at Jerusalem, Philip  came to Samaria, and there preached the Gospel: and when they believed  Philip, they were baptized, both men and women, and had great joy. And  afterwards, Peter and John came from Jerusalem, and prayed, and laid  their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. Mark here, they  first believed, and then were baptized, having great joy, and yet had  not received the Holy Ghost. But that was afterwards given, by the  laying on of hands and prayer, in the name of Jesus. O how different  from the systems of men!    Witness Paul's conversion while on his journey to Damascus: the Lord  Jesus appeared to him in the way; but instead of telling him his sins  were forgiven, and pouring the Holy Ghost upon him, He sent him to  Damascus, telling him that it should there be told him what he should  do. And coming to Damascus, Ananias being sent, commanded him not to  tarry, but to \"arise and be baptized, and wash away his sins, calling  on the name of the Lord;\" then he arose and was baptized, and was even  filled with the Holy Ghost, and straightway preached that Jesus was  the Christ.    Again, witness Peter going to Cornelius, a Gentile of great piety,  whose prayers were heard, and whose alms were remembered, and who had  even attained to the ministering of an angel; yet with all his piety,  and the Holy Ghost poured out upon him and his friends, before they  were baptized, they must be baptized, or they could not be saved. Why?  Because the Lord had commanded the Apostles to preach to every  creature, and every creature who would not believe and be baptized,  should be damned, without one exception. Witness the words of the  angel to Cornelius: \"He (Peter) shall tell thee words whereby thou and  all thy house shall be saved.\" Now, query, could Cornelius have been  saved without obeying the words of Peter? If so, the angel's errand  was in vain.    Now, perhaps a minister, who should find a man as good as Cornelius  was, would say to him: \"Go on, brother, you can be saved, you have  experienced religion, you may indeed be baptized to answer a good  conscience, if you feel it your duty; or, if not, it is no matter, a  new heart is all that is really necessary to salvation,\" etc.; as much  as to say, that the commandments of Jesus are not absolutely necessary  to salvation; a man may call him Lord, Lord, and be saved, just as  well as by keeping His commandments. Oh vain and foolish doctrine! Oh  ye children of men, how have you perverted the Gospel! In vain do ye  call Him Lord, Lord, and do not obey His commandments.    Next, we call to mind the jailor and his household, who were baptized  the same hour they believed, without waiting for the day; and Lydia  and her household, who attended to the ordinance the first sermon they  heard on the subject. Also Philip and the eunuch, who stopped the  chariot at the first water they came to, in order to attend to the  ordinance, although the eunuch had heard of Jesus, for the first time,  only a few minutes before. Now, I gather from all those examples of  ancient days, and from the precepts laid down in them, that baptism  was the initiating ordinance, by which all those who believed and  repented were received and adopted into the church or kingdom of God,  so as to be entitled to the remission of sins, and the blessing of the  Holy Ghost; indeed, it was the ordinance through which they became  sons and daughters; and because they were sons, the Lord shed forth  the Spirit of His Son into their hearts, crying, Abba, Father. It is  true, the Lord poured out the Holy Ghost upon Cornelius and his  friends, before they were baptized; but it seemed necessary, in order  to convince the believing Jews that the Gentiles also had part in this  salvation. And I believe this is the only instance, in the whole  record, of the people receiving the Holy Ghost without first obeying  the laws of adoption. But mark! Obeying the laws of adoption would  not constitute a man an heir of the kingdom, a citizen entitled to the  blessings and gifts of the Spirit, unless those laws and ordinances  were administered by one who had proper authority, and was duly  commissioned from the King; and a commission given to one individual  could never authorize another to act in his stead. This is one of the  most important points to be understood, as it brings to the test every  minister in Christendom; and questions the organization of every  church on earth, and all that have existed since direct inspiration  ceased.    Now, in order to come at this subject in plainness, let us examine the  constitution of earthly governments in regard to the authority and  laws of adoption. We will say, for instance, the President of the  United States writes a commission to A. B., duly authorizing him to  act in some office in the government, and, during his administration,  two gentlemen from Europe come to reside in this country, and, being  strangers and foreigners wishing to become citizens, they go before A.  B., and he administers the oath of allegiance in due form, and  certifies the same, and this constitutes them legal citizens, entitled  to all the privileges of those who are citizens or subjects by birth.  After these things, A. B. is taken away by death, and C. D., in  looking over his papers, happens to find the commission given to A.  B., and, applying it to his own use, assumes the vacant office;  meantime, two foreigners arrive, and apply for citizenship, and being  informed by persons ignorant of the affairs of government, that C. D.  could administer the laws of adoption, they submit to be administered  unto by C. D., without once examining his authority; C. D. certifies  of their citizenship, and they suppose they have been legally adopted,  the same as the others, and are entitled to all the privileges of  citizenship. But by and by, their citizenship is called in question,  and they produce the certificate of C. D.; the President inquires--  \"Who is C. D.? I never gave him a commission to act in any office, I  know him not, and you are strangers and foreigners to the  commonwealth, until you go before the legally appointed successor of  A. B., or some other of like authority, who has a commission from the  President direct in his own name.\" In the meantime, C. D. is taken and  punished according to law, for practising imposition, and usurping  authority which was never conferred upon him.    And so it is with the kingdom of God. The Lord authorized the Apostles  and others by direct revelation, and by the spirit of prophecy, to  preach and baptize, and build up His church and kingdom; but after a  while they died, and a long time passed away, and men, reading over  their commission, where it says to the eleven Apostles--\"Go ye into  all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature,\" etc., have had  the presumption to apply these sayings as their authority, and without  any other commission, have gone forth professing to preach the Gospel,  and baptize, and build up the church and kingdom of God; but those  whom they baptize never receive the same blessings and gifts which  characterized a saint or citizen of the kingdom in the days of the  Apostles. Why? Because they are yet foreigners and strangers, for the  commission given to the Apostles never commissioned any other man to  act in their stead. This was a prerogative the Lord reserved unto  himself. No man has a right to take this ministry upon himself, but he  that is called by revelation, and duly qualified to act in his calling  by the Holy Ghost.    But the reader inquires with astonishment, \"What! are none of all the  ministers of the present day called to the ministry, and legally  commissioned?\" Well, my reader, I will tell you how you may ascertain  from their own mouths, and that will be far better than an answer from  me; go to the clergy, and ask them if God has given them any direct  revelation since the New Testament was finished; inquire of them  whether the gift of prophecy ceased with the early age of the church;  and, in short, ask them if revelations, prophets, the ministering of  angels, etc., are needed or expected in these days, or whether they  believe that these things are done away, no more to return to the  earth; and their answer will be that the Bible contains sufficient,  and that since the canon of Scripture was filled, revelation, the  spirit of prophecy and the ministering of angels have ceased, because  no longer needed. In short, they will denounce every man as an  impostor who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3567"],[0,"Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte — Complete (#14)"],[1,"replied that the matter  was no longer in his hands, and that it was now under the cognisance of  the public administrators of the laws. The Minister then stepped into  his carriage, and the writer was conducted to several offices in his  hotel. She passed through them with a broken heart, for she met with  none but harsh men, who told her that the prisoner deserved death. From  them she learned that on the following day he would be brought before  the judge of the peace for his Section, who would decide whether there  was ground for putting him on his trial. In fact, this proceeding took  place next day. He was conveyed to the house of the judge of the peace  for the Section of Bondy, Rue Grange-sue-Belles, whose name was Lemaire.  His countenance was mild; and though his manner was cold, he had none of  the harshness and ferocity common to the Government agents of that time.  His examination of the charge was long, and he several times shook  his head. The moment of decision had arrived, and everything seemed  to indicate that the termination would be to place the prisoner under  accusation. At seven o'clock be desired me to be called. I hastened to  him, and beheld a most heart rending scene. Bourrienne was suffering  under a hemorrhage, which had continued since two o'clock, and had  interrupted the examination. The judge of the peace, who looked sad,  sat with his head resting on his hand. I threw myself at his feet and  implored his clemency. The wife and the two daughters of the judge  visited this scene of sorrow, and assisted me in softening him. He was  a worthy and feeling man, a good husband and parent, and it was evident  that he struggled between compassion and duty. He kept referring to the  laws on the subject, and, after long researches said to me, \"To-morrow  is Decadi, and no proceedings can take place on that day. Find, madams,  two responsible persons, who will answer for the appearance of your  husband, and I will permit him to go home with you, accompanied by the  two guardians.\" Next day two friends were found, one of whom was  M. Desmaisons, counsellor of the court, who became bail for M. de  Bourrienne. He continued under these guardians six months, until a law  compelled the persons who were inscribed on the fatal list to remove to  the distance of ten leagues from Paris. One of the guardians was a man  of straw; the other was a knight of St. Louis. The former was left in  the antechamber; the latter made, every evening, one of our party at  cards. The family of M. de Bourrienne have always felt the warmest  gratitude to the judge of the peace and his family. That worthy man  saved the life of M. de Bourrienne, who, when he returned from Egypt,  and had it in his power to do him some service, hastened to his house;  but the good judge was no more!    The letters mentioned in the narrative were at this time stolen from me  by the police officers.    Everyone was now eager to pay court to a man who had risen from the  crowd in consequence of the part he had acted at an extraordinary  crisis, and who was spoken of as the future General of the Army of  Italy. It was expected that he would be gratified, as he really was, by  the restoration of some letters which contained the expression of  his former very modest wishes, called to recollection his unpleasant  situation, his limited ambition, his pretended aversion for public  employment, and finally exhibited his intimate relations with those who  were, without hesitation, characterised as emigrants, to be afterwards  made the victims of confiscation and death.    The 13th of Vendemiaire (5th October 1795) was approaching. The National  Convention had been painfully delivered of a new constitution, called,  from the epoch of its birth, \"the Constitution of Year III.\" It was  adopted on the 22d of August 1795. The provident legislators did not  forget themselves. They stipulated that two-thirds of their body should  form part of the new legislature. The party opposed to the Convention  hoped, on the contrary, that, by a general election, a majority would be  obtained for its opinion. That opinion was against the continuation of  power in the hands of men who had already so greatly abused it.    The same opinion was also entertained by a great part of the most  influential Sections of Paris, both as to the possession of property and  talent. These Sections declared that, in accepting the new constitution,  they rejected the decree of the 30th of August, which required the  re-election of two-thirds The Convention, therefore, found itself  menaced in what it held most dear--its power;--and accordingly resorted  to measures of defence. A declaration was put forth, stating that the  Convention, if attacked, would remove to Chalons-sur-Marne; and the  commanders of the armed force were called upon to defend that body.    The 5th of October, the day on which the Sections of Paris attacked the  Convention, is certainly one which ought to be marked in the wonderful  destiny of Bonaparte.    With the events of that day were linked, as cause and effect, many great  political convulsions of Europe. The blood which flowed ripened the  seeds of the youthful General's ambition. It must be admitted that the  history of past ages presents few periods full of such extraordinary  events as the years included between 1795 and 1815. The man whose name  serves, in some measure, as a recapitulation of all these great events  was entitled to believe himself immortal.    Living retired at Sens since the month of July, I only learned what had  occasioned the insurrection of the Sections from public report and the  journals. I cannot, therefore, say what part Bonaparte may have taken in  the intrigues which preceded that day. He was officially characterised  only as secondary actor in the scene. The account of the affair  which was published announces that Barras was, on that very day,  Commander-in-chief of the Army of the Interior, and Bonaparte second in  command. Bonaparte drew up that account. The whole of the manuscript was  in his handwriting, and it exhibits all the peculiarity of his style and  orthography. He sent me a copy.    Those who read the bulletin of the 13th Vendemiaire, cannot fail to  observe the care which Bonaparte took to cast the reproach of shedding  the first blood on the men he calls rebels. He made a great point of  representing his adversaries as the aggressors. It is certain he long  regretted that day. He often told me that he would give years of his  life to blot it out from the page of his history. He was convinced that  the people of Paris were dreadfully irritated against him, and he would  have been glad if Barras had never made that Speech in the Convention,  with the part of which, complimentary to himself, he was at the time so  well pleased. Barras said, \"It is to his able and prompt dispositions  that we are indebted for the defence of this assembly, around which he  had posted the troops with so much skill.\" This is perfectly true, but  it is not always agreeable that every truth should be told. Being out  of Paris, and a total stranger to this affair, I know not how far he was  indebted for his success to chance, or to his own exertions, in the part  assigned to him by the miserable Government which then oppressed France.  He represented himself only as secondary actor in this sanguinary  scene in which Barras made him his associate. He sent to me, as already  mentioned, an account of the transaction, written entirely in his  own hand, and distinguished by all the peculiarities of his style and  orthography.         --[Joseph Bonaparte, in a note on this peerage, insinuates that the     account of the 13th Vendemiaire was never sent to Sens, but was     abstracted by Bourrienne, with other documents, from Napoleon's     Cabinet (Erreurs, tome i. p. 239).]--    \"On the 13th,\" says Bonaparte, \"at five o'clock in the morning, the  representative of the people, Barras, was appointed Commander-in-chief  of the Army of the Interior, and General Bonaparte was nominated second  in command.    \"The artillery for service on the frontier was still at the camp of  Sablons, guarded solely by 150 men; the remainder was at Marly with  200 men. The depot of Meudon was left unprotected. There were at the  Feuillans only a few four-pounders without artillerymen, and but 80,000  cartridges. The victualling depots were dispersed throughout Paris.  In many Sections the drums beat to arms; the Section of the Theatre  Francais had advanced posts even as far as the Pont Neuf, which it had  barricaded.    \"General Barras ordered the artillery to move immediately from the camp  of Sablons to the Tuileries, and selected the artillerymen from the  battalions of the 89th regiment, and from the gendarmerie, and placed  them at the Palace; sent to Meudon 200 men of the police legion whom he  brought from Versailles, 50 cavalry, and two companies of veterans; he  ordered the property which was at Marly to be conveyed to Meudon; caused  cartridges to be brought there, and established a workshop at that place  for the manufacture of more. He secured means for the subsistence of the  army and of the Convention for many days, independently of the depots  which were in the Sections.    \"General Verdier, who commanded at the Palais National, exhibited great  coolness; he was required not to suffer a shot to be fired till the  last extremity. In the meantime reports reached him from all quarters  acquainting him that the Sections were assembled in arms, and had formed  their columns. He accordingly arrayed his troops so as to defend the  Convention, and his artillery was in readiness to repulse the rebels.  His cannon was planted at the Feuillans to fire down the Rue Honore.  Eight-pounders were pointed at every opening, and in the event of any  mishap, General Verdier had cannon in reserve to fire in flank upon  the column which should have forced a"]]]
