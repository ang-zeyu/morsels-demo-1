This is probably in part due to their training.  Mothers, as a rule, instruct their daughters carefully regarding their  relations with boys and men. It is in part due to the instinctive and  inherent purity of mind of the normal woman.    Nature has devised a retribution for illicit intercourse in the form  of venereal disease. If the parties observe fidelity to the marriage  vows venereal disease is experienced in wedlock only on very rare  occasions, and then through some accidental infection, as from contact  with some public utensils, as a public water closet, a public towel or  drinking cup. So rare is this unfortunate accident, however, that we  may say, that intercourse in undefiled wedlock results normally in  pleasure and gratification to both parties, while intercourse out of  wedlock, or illicit intercourse, is destined, as a rule, to be visited  with retribution.    What form does this retribution that nature metes out to the vice of  illicit intercourse take? Besides the various psychic punishments, the  principal of which are remorse, and impure thoughts, there are  physical punishments in the form of venereal diseases. So prevalent  are these venereal diseases among lewd women, whether prostitutes or  clandestines, that specialists in this field say that \"_all lewd women  are diseased part of the time and some lewd women are diseased all the  time_.\"    These sexual diseases are contagious--that is, transmitted by contact.  They are all germ diseases; one of them is practically local, one is  capable of spreading the infection to contiguous organs and one is  systemic.    a. =Chancroid or Soft Chancre.=--This is the least dangerous of the  venereal diseases. It is a contagious disease of purely local type,  usually acquired during the sexual act, the infection taking place  through a break in the continuity of the mucous membrane.    Chancroid may be single, though most often is multiple. It makes its  appearance in from one to five days after exposure, anywhere on the  penis, but most frequently on the under side of the glans beside the  fraenulum as a small red spot. This rapidly takes the form of a blister  containing serum and pus, and in a few days may become the size of a  ten-cent piece. When the roof is removed the ulcer has the appearance  of having been punched out, the floor being covered with pus. It is  surrounded by a zone of inflammation and is painful.    If uncomplicated the disease runs its course in from two to five  weeks. The most common complication is swollen and suppurating glands  of the groin on one or both sides. This condition is termed _bubo_ or  \"blue ball\" in common language.    Sometimes serious complications arise which may prove dangerous and  require the individual to be confined to his bed for weeks.    b. =Gonorrhea.=--This is incomparably more serious than chancroid.  This disease is very prevalent among the incontinent, and it is  claimed by some specialists in this field that from sixty to  seventy-five per cent. of men have had gonorrhea before the age of  thirty.    It is a contagious disease, acquired usually during intercourse,  though the individual may become infected innocently from water  closets, bath tubs, etc.    To become infected it is not necessary that there be an abrasion of  the mucous membrane.    The disease manifests itself in from three to seven days after  exposure by swelling of the orifice of the urethra, peculiar  sensations between tickling and itching, and smarting or burning  during urination. The peculiar sensations fix the attention to the  genitals, thus causing frequent passage of urine.    These symptoms increase for about a week, when the disease reaches its  maximum degree of severity, which is maintained a variable time, the  discharge from the urethra being thick, creamy and of a greenish  yellow color.    In the majority of carefully treated cases, the discharge ceases in  from three to six weeks with apparent recovery. Unfortunately,  however, there is frequently a tendency for the disease to become  chronic. The discharge becomes thin and more watery and persists for  an indefinite period. This condition--chronic gonorrhea--is commonly  known as \"gleet.\"    c. =Syphilis=, popularly termed the \"pox,\" is a constitutional  affection of the type known as \"blood diseases.\"    It is by far the most important and most greatly to be feared of the  venereal diseases. No disease has been so wide-spread in its  dissemination or more potent in its influence upon humanity.    It has been known for centuries, having been mentioned by Japanese  historians and in Chinese writings two thousand years ago.    Syphilis is contagious and is transmitted by inoculation. The  infectious material enters the broken surface of either the skin or  mucous membrane, called \"contact\" or \"acquired\" syphilis. When it is  transmitted by the mother to the embryo, it is called \"hereditary\" or  \"inherited\" syphilis.    The disease manifests itself first in a \"_primary lesion_\" which is a  local ulcer (hard chancre) at the point or points of inoculation at a  period ranging from ten to thirty days after exposure. It may appear  as an erosion or as a dry scaling and indurated papule, varying in  size from a pin-head to a silver dollar. The base of the ulcer is  indurated. It is oval in shape, perhaps somewhat irregular, with a raw  surface and red colored base devoid of pus.    Immediately following the appearance of the chancre, the glands in  direct connection with it become enlarged, hard and rarely painful,  but they have no tendency to suppurate like the enlarged glands of  chancroid.    The chancre disappears in a few weeks and then there is a period when  the individual has no outward manifestations of the disease. In about  six weeks after the chancre the so-called _secondary symptoms_ make  their appearance. They are heralded by headache, pains in the limbs  and back, nausea, sleeplessness and nervous irritability and fever,  followed by the appearance of a rash upon the face and body, falling  out of the hair, sore throat and mouth. These symptoms disappear to be  again followed by a period free from symptoms. After a longer or  shorter time the so-called _tertiary symptoms_ make their appearance,  which are many and varied.    The disease presents a succession of morbid constitutional  disturbances, appearing at variable intervals, and pursues a chronic  course.    This disease remains in the body for years and affects the most vital  organs, particularly the brain and spinal cord.    When one is infected with this disease he should seek the services of  a reputable physician. The treatment of this extends over a long  period, usually about three years, and must be strictly and  conscientiously carried out. Marriage upon the part of an individual  once infected should be only upon the approval of a physician.    After having detailed, as above, the terrible consequences of the  venereal diseases, it is hardly necessary to add that the young man  who deliberately seeks any of the usual chances for illicit  intercourse, is more than taking his life in his hands. If infection  with a venereal disease meant simply the death of the infected  individual, it would really be very much less deleterious to society  than is the present condition. When the young man \"sows wild oats\" and  catches incidently gonorrhea, that twenty years ago was considered a  sort of a \"good joke,\" he will, in a large proportion of cases, lay  the foundation for broken health and will run a serious risk of  transmitting the disease to an innocent, pure wife.    When a woman catches this disease, particularly from her husband, she  is very likely to interpret the discharge as a leucorrhea, may say  nothing about it to her husband or her physician, but adopt simple  home treatment with antiseptic and astringent douches. Such treatment  will usually result in allaying the inflammation in the superficial  organs, but will not eradicate it from the deeper organs. It spreads  to the uterus, Fallopian tubes and ovaries and may even affect  peritoneal tissues, first of the pelvis, then of the abdomen--may even  finally affect the heart and joints. Of course, these are rather the  extreme limit, but they are not at all rare cases. Once this terrible  disease gets into a woman's organs, it is very likely to lead to a  sojourn in a hospital where she loses some portion of her body as a  sacrifice to this mogul of gonorrhea.    It is claimed by specialists in this field that at least sixty-five  per cent. of the operations that women are subjected to in the  hospitals for diseases of the pelvic organs are the results of  gonorrheal infection. Besides the cases that require operation, a  large proportion of cases of sterility is due to gonorrheal infection,  either in the man or woman, or both.    If we consider the revolting sequences of syphilis with its train of  operations, and progeny of scrofulous children, it would seem to make  the natural retribution for illicit intercourse infinitely outweigh  any brief pleasures derived from the enjoyment of the stolen fruits.    It hardly seems possible that any young man who knows the whole truth  about these venereal diseases and their terrible after-effects could  be tempted to indulge in illicit intercourse.      2. MASTURBATION.    The vice of masturbation or self-abuse is very likely to be learned in  boyhood, perhaps even by boys of six or eight years of age through  their associations with obscene playmates. It not infrequently  happens, however, that the habit is learned independent of these evil  associations. It has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24714"],[0,"Fairy Tales from Brazil: How and Why Tales from Brazilian Folk-Lore (#10)"],[1," her mistress to eat for  dinner she noticed a black speck on the pigeon's breast. She thought  that it was a speck of dirt and tried to brush it away. To her  surprise she could not brush it off easily because it was a pin firmly  embedded in the pigeon's breast. She pulled and pulled but could not  pull it out so she sent for her master to come and see what he could  do to remove it. He at once pulled out the pin and then a wonderful  thing happened. The pigeon was transformed into a beautiful maiden. He  at once recognised her as the same lovely maiden who had sprung forth  from his melon by the fountain and whom he had left hidden in the  tree.    When the young man's black wife learned that her husband had found the  beautiful maiden again after all these years she confessed her deceit  and soon died. The young man married the beautiful maiden who was  still just as beautiful as she was the first time he saw her. They  were very happy together but the wife never forgot about the time she  had been a pigeon.    Up to that time pigeons had been wild birds who built their nests in  the deep forest. The wife often wished that they would build their  nests in her beautiful garden so she had little bird houses built and  set up there.    One day a pigeon, bolder than the rest, flew through the garden and  spied the little bird houses. He moved his family there at once and  told the other pigeons that there were other houses there for them  too. The other pigeons were timid and so they waited to see what  terrible calamity might happen to the bold pigeon and his family, but  not a single unpleasant thing occurred. They were just as happy as  happy could be in their new home.    After a while other pigeon families moved into the garden and were  happy too. Thus it came about that after years and years the pigeons  no longer build their nests in the deep forest, but they always make  their homes near the homes of men. The pigeons, themselves, do not  know how it all came about, but the beautiful woman who was once a  pigeon, when she had children of her own, told them about it, and they  told their children. Thus it happens that the mothers in Brazil tell  their children this story about the pigeon.          XVII    Why the Sea Moans      Once upon a time there was a little princess who lived in a  magnificent royal palace. All around the palace there was a beautiful  garden full of lovely flowers and rare shrubs and trees. The part of  the garden which the princess liked most of all was a corner of it  which ran down to the sea. She was a very lonely little princess and  she loved to sit and watch the changing beauty of the sea. The name of  the little princess was Dionysia and it often seemed to her that the  sea said, as it rushed against the shore, \"Di-o-ny-si-a,  Di-o-ny-si-a.\"    One day when the little princess was sitting all alone by the sea she  said to herself, \"O! I am so lonely. I do so wish that I had somebody  to play with. When I ride out in the royal chariot I see little girls  who have other little boys and girls to play with them. Because I am  the royal princess I never have anybody to play with me. If I have to  be the royal princess and not play with other children I do think I  might have some sort of live thing to play with me.\"    Then a most remarkable thing happened. The sea said very slowly and  distinctly and over and over again so there couldn't be any mistake  about it, \"Di-o-ny-si-a, Di-o-ny-si-a.\"    The little princess walked up close to the sea, just as close as she  dared to go without danger of getting her royal shoes and stockings  wet. Straight out of the biggest wave of all there came a sea serpent  to meet her. She knew that it was a sea serpent from the pictures in  her royal story books even though she had never seen a sea serpent  before, but somehow this sea serpent looked different than the  pictures. Instead of being a fierce monster it looked kind and gentle  and good. She held out her arms to it right away.    \"Come play with me,\" said Dionysia.    \"I am Labismena and I have come to play with you,\" replied the sea  serpent.    After that the little princess was very much happier. The sea serpent  came out of the sea to play with her every day when she was alone. If  any one else came near Labismena would disappear into the sea so no  one but Dionysia ever saw her.    The years passed rapidly and each year the little princess grew to be  a larger and larger princess. At last she was sixteen years old and a  very grown-up princess indeed. She still enjoyed her old playmate,  Labismena, and they were often together on the seashore.    One day when they were walking up and down together beside the sea the  sea serpent looked at Dionysia with sad eyes and said, \"I too have  been growing older all these years, dear Dionysia. Now the time has  come that we can no longer play together. I shall never come out of  the sea to play with you any more, but I shall never forget you and I  shall always be your friend. I hope that you will never have any  trouble, but if you ever should, call my name and I will come to help  you.\" Then the sea serpent disappeared into the sea.    About this time the wife of a neighbouring king died and as she lay  upon her death bed she gave the king a jewelled ring. \"When the time  comes when you wish to wed again,\" she said, \"I ask you to marry a  princess upon whose finger this ring shall be neither too tight nor  too loose.\"    After a while the king began to look about for a princess to be his  bride. He visited many royal palaces and tried the ring upon the  finger of many royal princesses. Upon some the ring was too tight and  upon others it was too loose. There was no princess whose finger it  fitted perfectly.    At last in his search the king came to the royal palace where the  princess Dionysia lived. The princess had dreams of her own of a young  and charming prince who would some day come to wed her, so she was not  pleased at all. The king was old and no longer handsome, and when he  tried the ring upon Dionysia's finger she hoped with all her heart  that it would not fit. It fitted perfectly.    The princess Dionysia was frightened nearly to death. \"Will I really  have to marry him?\" she asked her royal father. Her father told her  what a very wealthy king he was with a great kingdom and a wonderful  royal palace ever so much more wonderful and grand than the palace  the princess Dionysia had always had for her home. Her father had no  patience at all with her for not being happy about it. \"You ought to  consider yourself the most fortunate princess in all the world,\" he  said.    Dionysia spent her days and nights weeping. Her father was afraid that  she would grow so thin that the ring would no longer fit her finger,  so he hastened the plans for the wedding.    One day Dionysia walked up and down beside the sea, crying as if her  heart would break. All at once she stopped crying. \"How stupid I have  been,\" she said. \"My old playmate Labismena told me that if ever I was  in trouble she would come back and help me. With all my silly crying I  had forgotten about it.\"    Dionysia walked up close to the sea and called softly, \"Labismena,  Labismena.\" Out of the sea came the sea serpent just as she used to  come. The princess told the sea serpent all about the dreadful trouble  which was threatening to spoil her life.    \"Have no fear,\" said Labismena, \"tell your father that you will marry  the king when the king presents you with a dress the colour of the  fields and all their flowers and that you will not marry him until he  gives it to you.\" Then the sea serpent disappeared again into the sea.    Dionysia sent word through her father to her royal suitor that she  would wed him only when he procured her a dress the colour of the  fields and all their flowers. The king was very much in love with  Dionysia, so he was secretly filled with joy at this request. He  searched everywhere for a dress the colour of the fields and all their  flowers. It was a very difficult thing to find but at last he procured  one. He sent it to Dionysia at once.    When Dionysia saw that the king had really found the dress for her she  was filled with grief. She thought that there was no escape and that  she would have to marry the king after all. As soon as she could get  away from the palace without being noticed she ran down to the sea and  again called, \"Labismena, Labismena.\"    The sea serpent at once came out of the sea. \"Do not fear,\" she said  to Dionysia. \"Go back and say that you will not wed the king until he  gives you a dress the colour of the sea and all its fishes.\"    When the king heard this new request of Dionysia's he was rather  discouraged. However he searched for the dress and, at last, after  expending a great sum of money, he procured such a gown.    When Dionysia saw that a dress the colour of the sea and all its  fishes had been found for her she again went to seek counsel from her  old playmate. \"Do not be afraid,\" Labismena again said to her. \"This  time you must ask the king to get you a dress the colour of the sky  and all its stars. You may also tell him that this is the last present  you will ask him to make you.\"    When the king heard about the demand for a dress the colour of the sky  and all its stars he was completely disheartened, but when he heard  that Dionysia had promised that this would be the last present she  would ask he decided that it might be a good investment after all. He  set out to procure the dress with all possible speed. At last he found  one.    When Dionysia saw the dress the colour of the sky and all its stars  she thought that this time there was no escape from marrying the king.  She called the sea serpent with an anxious heart for she was afraid  that now even Labismena could do nothing to help her.    Labismena came out of the sea in answer to her call.    \"Go home to the palace and get your"]]]
