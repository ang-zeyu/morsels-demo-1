If we come across another of  the strange fruit we must avoid it.\"    Calling the piglets to him he picked them all up, one by one, and put  them away in his pocket; for although he could not see them he could  feel them, and when he had buttoned his coat he knew they were safe for  the present.    The travellers now resumed their walk toward the cottage, which they  presently reached. It was a pretty place, with vines growing thickly  over the broad front porch. The door stood open and a table was set in  the front room, with four chairs drawn up to it. On the table were  plates, knives and forks, and dishes of bread, meat and fruits. The meat  was smoking hot and the knives and forks were performing strange antics  and jumping here and there in quite a puzzling way. But not a single  person appeared to be in the room.    \"How funny!\" exclaimed Dorothy, who with Zeb and the Wizard now stood in  the doorway.    A peal of merry laughter answered her, and the knives and forks fell to  the plates with a clatter. One of the chairs pushed back from the table,  and this was so astonishing and mysterious that Dorothy was almost  tempted to run away in fright.    \"Here are strangers, mama!\" cried the shrill and childish voice of some  unseen person.    \"So I see, my dear,\" answered another voice, soft and womanly.    \"What do you want?\" demanded a third voice, in a stern, gruff accent.    \"Well, well!\" said the Wizard; \"are there really people in this room?\"    \"Of course,\" replied the man's voice.    \"And--pardon me for the foolish question--but, are you all invisible?\"    \"Surely,\" the woman answered, repeating her low, rippling laughter.  \"Are you surprised that you are unable to see the people of Voe?\"    \"Why, yes,\" stammered the Wizard. \"All the people I have ever met before  were very plain to see.\"    \"Where do you come from, then?\" asked the woman, in a curious tone.    \"We belong upon the face of the earth,\" explained the Wizard, \"but  recently, during an earthquake, we fell down a crack and landed in the  Country of the Mangaboos.\"    \"Dreadful creatures!\" exclaimed the woman's voice. \"I've heard of them.\"    \"They walled us up in a mountain,\" continued the Wizard; \"but we found  there was a tunnel through to this side, so we came here. It is a  beautiful place. What do you call it?\"    \"It is the Valley of Voe.\"    \"Thank you. We have seen no people since we arrived, so we came to this  house to enquire our way.\"    \"Are you hungry?\" asked the woman's voice.    \"I could eat something,\" said Dorothy.    \"So could I,\" added Zeb.    \"But we do not wish to intrude, I assure you,\" the Wizard hastened to  say.    \"That's all right,\" returned the man's voice, more pleasantly than  before. \"You are welcome to what we have.\"    As he spoke the voice came so near to Zeb that he jumped back in alarm.  Two childish voices laughed merrily at this action, and Dorothy was sure  they were in no danger among such light-hearted folks, even if those  folks couldn't be seen.    \"What curious animal is that which is eating the grass on my lawn?\"  enquired the man's voice.    \"That's Jim,\" said the girl. \"He's a horse.\"    \"What is he good for?\" was the next question.    \"He draws the buggy you see fastened to him, and we ride in the buggy  instead of walking,\" she explained.    \"Can he fight?\" asked the man's voice.    \"No! he can kick pretty hard with his heels, and bite a little; but Jim  can't 'zactly fight,\" she replied.    \"Then the bears will get him,\" said one of the children's voices.    \"Bears!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"Are these bears here?\"    \"That is the one evil of our country,\" answered the invisible man. \"Many  large and fierce bears roam in the Valley of Voe, and when they can  catch any of us they eat us up; but as they cannot see us, we seldom get  caught.\"    \"Are the bears invis'ble, too?\" asked the girl.    \"Yes; for they eat of the dama-fruit, as we all do, and that keeps them  from being seen by any eye, whether human or animal.\"    \"Does the dama-fruit grow on a low bush, and look something like a  peach?\" asked the Wizard.    \"Yes,\" was the reply.    \"If it makes you invis'ble, why do you eat it?\" Dorothy enquired.    \"For two reasons, my dear,\" the woman's voice answered. \"The dama-fruit  is the most delicious thing that grows, and when it makes us invisible  the bears cannot find us to eat us up. But now, good wanderers, your  luncheon is on the table, so please sit down and eat as much as you  like.\"    [Illustration]          CHAPTER 9.    THEY FIGHT THE INVISIBLE BEARS      The strangers took their seats at the table willingly enough, for they  were all hungry and the platters were now heaped with good things to  eat. In front of each place was a plate bearing one of the delicious  dama-fruit, and the perfume that rose from these was so enticing and  sweet that they were sorely tempted to eat of them and become invisible.    But Dorothy satisfied her hunger with other things, and her companions  did likewise, resisting the temptation.    \"Why do you not eat the damas?\" asked the woman's voice.    \"We don't want to get invis'ble,\" answered the girl.    \"But if you remain visible the bears will see you and devour you,\" said  a girlish young voice, that belonged to one of the children. \"We who  live here much prefer to be invisible; for we can still hug and kiss one  another, and are quite safe from the bears.\"    \"And we do not have to be so particular about our dress,\" remarked the  man.    \"And mama can't tell whether my face is dirty or not!\" added the other  childish voice, gleefully.    \"But I make you wash it, every time I think of it,\" said the mother;  \"for it stands to reason your face is dirty, Ianu, whether I can see it  or not.\"    Dorothy laughed and stretched out her hands.    \"Come here, please--Ianu and your sister--and let me feel of you,\" she  requested.    They came to her willingly, and Dorothy passed her hands over their  faces and forms and decided one was a girl of about her own age and the  other a boy somewhat smaller. The girl's hair was soft and fluffy and  her skin as smooth as satin. When Dorothy gently touched her nose and  ears and lips they seemed to be well and delicately formed.    \"If I could see you I am sure you would be beautiful,\" she declared.    The girl laughed, and her mother said:    \"We are not vain in the Valley of Voe, because we can not display our  beauty, and good actions and pleasant ways are what make us lovely to  our companions. Yet we can see and appreciate the beauties of nature,  the dainty flowers and trees, the green fields and the clear blue of the  sky.\"    \"How about the birds and beasts and fishes?\" asked Zeb.    \"The birds we cannot see, because they love to eat of the damas as much  as we do; yet we hear their sweet songs and enjoy them. Neither can we  see the cruel bears, for they also eat the fruit. But the fishes that  swim in our brooks we can see, and often we catch them to eat.\"    \"It occurs to me you have a great deal to make you happy, even while  invisible,\" remarked the Wizard. \"Nevertheless, we prefer to remain  visible while we are in your valley.\"    Just then Eureka came in, for she had been until now wandering outside  with Jim; and when the kitten saw the table set with food she cried out:    \"Now you must feed me, Dorothy, for I'm half starved.\"    The children were inclined to be frightened by the sight of the small  animal, which reminded them of the bears; but Dorothy reassured them by  explaining that Eureka was a pet and could do no harm even if she wished  to. Then, as the others had by this time moved away from the table, the  kitten sprang upon the chair and put her paws upon the cloth to see what  there was to eat. To her surprise an unseen hand clutched her and held  her suspended in the air. Eureka was frantic with terror, and tried to  scratch and bite, so the next moment she was dropped to the floor.    \"Did you see that, Dorothy?\" she gasped.    \"Yes, dear,\" her mistress replied; \"there are people living in this  house, although we cannot see them. And you must have better manners,  Eureka, or something worse will happen to you.\"    She placed a plate of food upon the floor and the kitten ate greedily.    \"Give me that nice-smelling fruit I saw on the table,\" she begged, when  she had cleaned the plate.    \"Those are damas,\" said Dorothy, \"and you must never even taste them,  Eureka, or you'll get invis'ble, and then we can't see you at all.\"    The kitten gazed wistfully at the forbidden fruit.    \"Does it hurt to be invis'ble?\" she asked.    \"I don't know,\" Dorothy answered; \"but it would hurt me dre'fully to  lose you.\"    \"Very well, I won't touch it,\" decided the kitten; \"but you must keep it  away from me, for the smell is very tempting.\"    \"Can you tell us, sir or ma'am,\" said the Wizard, addressing the air  because he did not quite know where the unseen people stood, \"if there  is any way we can get out of your beautiful Valley, and on top of the  Earth again.\"    \"Oh, one can leave the Valley easily enough,\" answered the man's voice;  \"but to do so you must enter a far less pleasant country. As for  reaching the top of the earth, I have never heard that it is possible to  do that, and if you succeeded in getting there you would probably fall  off.\"    \"Oh, no,\" said Dorothy, \"we've been there, and we know.\"    \"The Valley of Voe is certainly a charming place,\" resumed the Wizard;  \"but we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22567"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 2 (#10)"],[1,"crossed, checked his pursuers. But on March 15th, re-enforced  to about 4,000, the Quaker general offered battle to Cornwallis at  Guilford Court-House, N. C. He drew up his forces on a wooded hill in  three lines one behind the other. The first line, consisting of raw  North Carolina militia, fled before the British bayonet charge, hardly  firing a shot. The Virginia brigade constituting the second line made a  brave resistance, but was soon driven back. On swept the British  columns, flushed with victory, against the third line. Here Greek met  Greek. The Continentals stood their ground like the veterans they were.  After a long and bloody fight the British were driven back. The  fugitives, however, presently rallied under cover of theartillery, when  Greene, fearing to risk more, withdrew from the field. The British lost  500; the Americans, 400, besides a large part of the militia, who  dispersed to their homes. Cornwallis, with his \"victorious but ruined  army,\" retreated to the southern part of the State. The last of April he  forsook Carolina, and marched into Virginia with 1,400 men.      [Illustration: Several men in a rowboat, one holding a white flag.]  Arnold's Escape.      Greene, his force reduced to 1,800, carried the war into South Carolina.  Defeated at Hobkirk's Hill, near Camden, and compelled by the approach  of General Rawdon to raise the siege of Ninety-Six, he retreated north.  Meantime Marion and Lee had brought about the evacuation of Camden and  Augusta. Rawdon soon evacuated Ninety-Six, and moved toward the coast,  followed by Greene.    A ceaseless guerilla warfare was kept up, attended with many  barbarities. Slave-stealing was a favorite pursuit on both sides. It is  noteworthy that the followers of Sumter, fighting in the cause of  freedom, were paid largely in slaves. The whole campaign was marked by  severities unknown at the North. The British shot as deserters all who,  having once accepted royal protection, were taken in arms against the  king. In a few cases Americans dealt similarly with Americans fighting  for the British, but in general their procedure was infinitely the more  humane.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  General Nathaniel Greene.      The battle of Eutaw Springs practically ended the war in the South. The  British were victorious, but all the advantages of the battle accrued to  the Americans. The British loss was nearly 1,000; the American, 600. In  ten months Greene had driven the British from all Georgia and the  Carolinas except Wilmington, Charleston, and Savannah.    Destiny decreed that Washington should strike the last blow for his  country's freedom on the soil of his own State. Cornwallis found himself  in Virginia, the last of May, at the head of 7,000 troops. He ravaged  the State, destroying $10,000,000 worth of property. Lafayette, pitted  against him with 3,000 men, could do little. In August Cornwallis  withdrew into Yorktown, and began fortifications. Lafayette's quick eye  saw that the British general had caged himself. Posting his army so as  to prevent Cornwallis's escape, he advised Washington to hasten with his  army to Virginia. Meanwhile a French fleet blocked up the mouth of  Chesapeake Bay and of James River and York River, cutting off  Cornwallis's escape by water. The last of September Washington's army,  accompanied by the French troops under Rochambeau, appeared before  Yorktown. Clinton, deceived by Washington into the belief that New York  was to be attacked, was still holding that city with 18,000 men. The  American army, 16,000 strong--7,000 French--began a regular siege.  Cornwallis was doomed.        [Illustration: Cornwallis in center on horse, with hat off. Washington  and aides on right also on horses, with hats on.]  Surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  General Daniel Morgan.      Two advanced redoubts of the British works were soon carried by a  brilliant assault in which the French and the American troops won equal  honors. On the 19th Cornwallis surrendered. The captive army, numbering  7,247, marched with cased colors between two long lines of American and  French troops, and laid down their arms.    The news of Cornwallis's surrender flew like wild-fire over the country.  Everywhere the victory was hailed as virtually ending the war. Bonfires  and booming cannon told of the joy of the people. Congress assembled,  and marching to church in a body, not as a mere form, we may well  believe, gave thanks to the God of battles, so propitious at last.        CHAPTER VII.    PEACE    [1782]    The peace party and spirit in England increased month by month.  Burgoyne's surrender had dissipated the hope of speedily suppressing the  rebellion. And as the war dragged on and Englishmen by bitter experience  came to realize the bravery, endurance, and national feeling of the  Americans, the conviction spread that three millions of such people,  separated from the mother-country by three thousand miles of boisterous  ocean, could never be conquered by force. Discouragement arose, too,  from the ill conduct of the war. There was no broad plan or consistency  in management. Generals did not agree or co-operate, and were changed  too often. Clinton and Cornwallis hated each other. Burgoyne superseded  Carleton, a better man. But for Lord Germain's \"criminal negligence\" in  waiting to go upon a visit before sending the proper orders, Clinton  might have met and saved Burgoyne.    There were enormous and needless expenses. By 1779 England's national  debt had increased 63,000,000 pounds; by 1782 it had doubled. Rents were  declining. The price of land had fallen one-third. Hence the war became  unpopular with the landed aristocracy. British manufacturers suffered by  the narrowing of their foreign markets. American privateers, prowling in  all seas, had captured hundreds of British merchant-men. English  sentiment, too, revolted at certain features of the war. Ravaging and  the use of mercenaries and Indians were felt to be barbarous. Time made  clearer the initial error of the government in invoking war over the  doubtful right of taxing America. An increasing number of lawyers took  the American view. Practical men figured out that each year of  hostilities cost more than the proposed tax would have yielded in a  century.    In February, 1778, Parliament almost unanimously adopted proposals to  restore the state of things which existed in America before the war, at  the same time declaring its intention not to exercise its right of  taxing the colonies. Washington spoke for America when he said, \"Nothing  but independence will now do.\" The proposals were rejected by Congress  and by the States separately.    England's difficulties were greatly increased by the help extended to  America from abroad. France, eager for revenge on England, early in the  war lent secret aid by money and military supplies. Later, emboldened by  the defeat of Burgoyne, the French Government recognized the United  States as an independent nation. By a treaty, offensive and defensive,  the two nations bound themselves to fight together for that  independence, neither to conclude a separate peace.    The benefit from this treaty was moral and financial rather than  martial. At Yorktown, to be sure, the French forces rendered invaluable  aid. Without De Grasse's French fleet at the mouths of the York and  James rivers, the British might have relieved Cornwallis by sea. But  Congress needed money more than foreign soldiers, and without France's  liberal loans it is difficult to see how the government could have  struggled through.    Spain, too, joined the alliance of France and the United States and  declared war against England, though from no love for the young  republic. This action hastened the growth of public opinion in England  against the continuance of the American war. In the House of Commons,  Lord Cavendish made a motion for ordering home the troops. Lord North,  prime minister, threw out hints that it was useless to continue the war.  But George III., summoning his ministers, declared his unchanging  resolution never to yield to the rebels, and continued prodding the  wavering North to stumble on in his stupid course.    It was struggling against fate. The next year saw Holland at war with  England, while Catherine, Empress of Russia, was actively organizing the  Armed Neutrality, by which all the other states of Europe leagued  together to resist England's practice of stopping vessels on the high  seas and searching them for contraband goods.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Lord Cornwallis.      England was now involved in four wars, without money to carry them on.  North's majorities in Parliament grew steadily smaller. No doubt much of  the opposition was simply factious and partisan, but it had, after all,  solid basis in principle. England was fighting her own  policy--economically, for she was destined to free trade, and  politically, inasmuch as the freedom which our fathers sought was  nothing but English freedom.    The surrender of Cornwallis tipped the scale. Lord North, when he heard  the news, paced the room in agony, exclaiming again and again, \"O God,  it is all over!\" The House of Commons, without even a division, resolved  to \"consider as enemies to His Majesty and the country\" all who should  advise a further prosecution of the war. North resigned, and Shelburne,  Secretary of State in the new ministry, hastened to open peace  negotiations with Franklin at Paris.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Benjamin Franklin.      Benjamin Franklin, now venerable with years, had been doing at the court  of Versailles a work hardly less important than that of Washington on  the battlefields of America.
