Maybe we can locate some of  them here.\"    He knew that Thorvald would be reluctant to work the raft in shore, to  spare time for such hunting. But there would be no arguing with hungry  wolverines, and he did not propose to lose the animals for the officer's  whim.    However, Thorvald did not protest. They poled the raft out of the main  pull of the current, sending it in toward the southern shore in the lee  of a clump of light-willows. Shann scrambled ashore, the wolverines  after him, sniffling along at his heels while he overturned likely  looking rocks to unroof some odd underwater dwellings. The fish with the  rudimentary legs were present and not agile enough even in their native  element to avoid well-clawed paws which scooped them neatly out of the  river shallows. There was also a sleek furred creature with a broad flat  head and paddle-equipped forepaws, rather like a miniature seal, which  Taggi appropriated before Shann had a chance to examine it closely. In  fact, the wolverines wrought havoc along a half-mile section of bank  before the Terran could coax them back to the raft.    As they hunted, Shann got a better idea of the land about the river. It  was sere, the vegetation dwindling except for some rough spikes of  things pushing through the parched ground like flayed fingers, their  puffed redness in contrast to the usual amethystine coloring of  Warlock's growing things. Under the climbing sun that whole stretch of  country was revealed in a stark bareness which at first repelled, and  then began to interest him.    He discovered Thorvald standing on the upper bluff, looking out toward  the waiting mountains. The officer turned as Shann urged the wolverines  to the raft, and when he jumped down the drop to join them, Shann saw he  carried a map strip unrolled in his hand.    \"The situation is not as good as we hoped,\" he told the younger man.  \"Well have to leave the river to cross the heights.\"    \"Why?\"    \"There're rapids--bending in a falls.\" The officer squatted down,  spreading out the strip and making stabs at it with a nervous finger  tip. \"Here we have to leave. This is all rough ground. But lying to the  south there's a gap which may be a pass. This was made from an aerial  survey.\"    Shann knew enough to realize to what extent such a guide could go wrong.  Main features of the landscape would be clear enough from aloft, but  there might be unsurmountable difficulties at ground level which were  not distinguishable from the air. Yet Thorvald had planned this journey  as if he had already explored their escape route and that it was as open  and easy as a stroll down Tyr's main transport way. Why was it so  necessary that they try to reach the sea? However, since he had no  objection to voice except a dislike for indefinite information, Shann  did not question the other's calm assumption of command, not yet,  anyway.    As they embarked and worked back into the current, Shann studied his  companion. Thorvald had freely listed the difficulties lying before  them. Yet he did not seem in the least worried about their being able to  win through to the sea--or if he was, his outer shell of unconcern  remained uncracked. Before their first day together had ended, the  younger Terran had learned that to Thorvald he was only another tool, to  be used by the Survey officer in some project which the other believed  of primary importance. And his resentment of the valuation was under  control so far. He valued Thorvald's knowledge, but the other's attitude  chilled and rebuffed his need for something more than a half partnership  of work.    Why had Thorvald come back to Warlock in the first place? And why had it  been necessary for him to risk his life--perhaps more than his life if  their theory was correct concerning the Throgs' wish to capture a  Terran--to get that set of maps from the plundered camp? When he had  first talked of that raid, his promised loot had been supplies to fill  their daily needs; there had been no mention of maps. By all signs  Thorvald was engaged on some mission. And what would happen if he,  Shann, suddenly stopped being the other's obedient underling and  demanded a few explanations here and now?    Only Shann knew enough about men to also know that he would not get any  information out of Thorvald that the latter was not ready to give, and  that such a showdown, coming prematurely, would only end in his own  discomfiture. He smiled wryly now, remembering his emotions when he had  first seen Ragnar Thorvald months ago. As if the officer ever considered  the likes, dislikes--or dreams--of one Shann Lantee. No, reality and  dreams seldom approached each other. Dreams....    \"On any of those shoreline maps,\" he asked suddenly, \"do they have  marked a mountain shaped like a skull?\"    Thorvald thrust with his pole. \"Skull?\" he repeated, a little absently,  as he so often did in answer to Shann's questions unless they dealt with  some currently important matter.    \"A queer sort of skull,\" Shann said. Just as vividly as when he had  first awakened, he could picture that skull mountain with the flying  things about its eye sockets. And that, too, was odd; dream impressions  usually faded with the passing of waking hours. \"It has a protruding  lower jaw and the waves wash that ... red-and-purple rock----\"    \"What?\"    He had Thorvald's complete attention now.    \"Where did you hear about it?\" That demand followed quickly.    \"I didn't hear about it. I dreamed of it last night. I stood there right  in front of it. There were birds--or things flying like birds--going in  and out of the eyeholes----\"    \"What else?\" Thorvald leaned across his pole, his eyes alive, avid, as  if he would pull the reply he wanted out of Shann by force.    \"That was all I remember--the skull mountain.\" He did not add his other  impression, that he was meant to find that skull, that he _must_ find  it.    \"Nothing....\" Thorvald paused, and then spoke slowly, with a visible  reluctance. \"Nothing else? No cavern with a green veil--a wide green  veil--strung across it?\"    Shann shook his head. \"Just the skull mountain.\"    Thorvald looked as if he didn't quite believe that, but Shann's  expression must have been convincing, for he laughed shortly.    \"Well, there goes one nice neat theory up in smoke!\" he commented. \"No,  your skull doesn't appear on any of our maps, and so probably my cavern  does not exist either. They may both be smoke screens----\"    \"What--?\" But Shann never finished that query.    A wind was rising in the desert to blow across the slit which held the  river, carrying with it a fine shifting of sand which coasted down into  the water as a gray haze, coating men, animals, and raft, and sighing as  snow sighs when it falls.    Only that did not drown out another cry, a thin cry, diluted by the  miles of land stretching behind them, but yet carrying that long  ululating howl they had heard in the Throg camp. Thorvald grinned  mirthlessly.    \"The hound's on trail.\"    He bent to the pole, using it to aid the pace of the current. Shann,  chilled in spite of the sun's heat, followed his example, wondering if  time had ceased to fight on their side.          6. THE HOUND      The sun was a harsh ball of heat baking the ground and then, in some odd  manner, drawing back that same fieriness. In the coolness of the eastern  mountains Shann would not have believed that Warlock could hold such  heat. The men discarded their jackets early as they swung to dip the  poles. But they dared not strip off the rest of their clothing lest  their skin burn. And again gusts of wind now drove sand over the edge of  the cut to blanket the water.    Shann wiped his eyes, pausing in his eternal push-push, to look at the  rocks which they were passing in threatening proximity. For the slash  which held the river had narrowed. And the rock of its walls was naked  of earth, save for sheltered pockets holding the drift of sand dust,  while boulders of all sizes cut into the path of the flowing water.    He had not been mistaken; they were going faster, faster even than their  efforts with the poles would account for. With the narrowing of the bed  of the stream, the current was taking on a new swiftness. Shann said as  much and Thorvald nodded.    \"We're approaching the first of the rapids.\"    \"Where we get off and walk around,\" Shann croaked wearily. The dust  gritted between his teeth, irritated his eyes. \"Do we stay beside the  river?\"    \"As long as we can,\" Thorvald replied somberly. \"We have no way of  transporting water.\"    Yes, a man could live on very slim rations of food, continue to beat his  way over a bad trail if he had the concentrate tablets they carried. But  there was no going without water, and in this heat such an effort would  finish them quickly. Always they both listened for another cry from  behind, a cry to tell them just how near the Throg hunting party had  come.    \"No Throg flyers yet,\" Shann observed. He had expected one of those  black plates to come cruising the moment the hound had pointed the  direction for their pursuers.    \"Not in a storm such as this.\" Thorvald, without releasing his hold on  the raft pole, pointed with his chin to the swirling haze cloaking the  air above the cut walls. Here the river dug yet deeper into the  beginning of a canyon. They could breathe better. The dust still sifted  down but not as thickly as a half hour earlier. Though over their heads  the sky was now a grayish lid, shutting out the sun, bringing a portion  of coolness to the travelers.    The Survey officer glanced from side to side, watching the banks as if  hunting for some special mark or sign. At last he used his pole as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20796"],[0,"The Colors of Space (#10)"],[1,"take off  in the direction of Antares. There's a ship, due to come in here in  about ten days, called the _Swiftwing_, which is just about due to make  the Antares run. Captain Steele had managed to arrange--I don't know  how, and I don't want to know how--for a vacancy on that ship, and  somehow he got credentials. You see, it's a very good spy system, a  network between the stars, but the weak link is this: everything, every  message, every man, has to travel back and forth by the Lhari ships  themselves.\"    He rose, shaking it all off impatiently. \"Well, it's finished now. Your  father is dead. What are you going to do? If you want to go back to  Vega, you can probably convince the Lhari you're just an innocent  bystander. They _don't_ hurt bystanders or children, Bart. They aren't  bad people. They're just protecting their business monopoly.    \"The safest way to handle it would be this: let me erase your memories  of what I've told you tonight. Then just let the Lhari capture you. They  won't kill you. They'll just give you a light psych-check. When they  find out you don't know anything, they'll send you back to Vega, and you  can spend the rest of your life in peace, running Vega Interplanet and  Eight Colors.\"    Bart turned on him furiously. \"You mean, go home like a good little boy,  and pretend none of this ever happened? What do you think I am, anyhow?\"  Bart's chin set in the new, hard line. \"What I want is a chance to go on  where Dad left off!\"    \"It won't be easy, and it could be dangerous,\" Raynor Three said, \"but  there's nothing else to be done. We had the arrangements all made; and  now somebody's got to take the dangerous risk of calling them off. Are  you game for a little plastic surgery--just enough to change your looks  again, with new forged papers? You can't go by the _Swiftwing_--it  doesn't carry passengers--but there's another route you can take.\"    Bart sprang up. \"No,\" he said, \"I know a better way. Let me go on the  _Swiftwing_--in Dad's place--_as a Lhari_!\"    \"Bart, no,\" Raynor Three said. \"You'd never get away with it. It's too  dangerous.\" But his gold eyes glinted.    \"Why not? I speak Lhari better than Dad ever did. And my eyes can stand  Lhari lights. You said yourself, it's going to be a dangerous job just  calling off all the arrangements. So let's _not_ call them off. Just let  me take Dad's place!\"    \"Bart, you're only a boy--\"    \"What was Dave Briscoe? No, Raynor. Dad left me a lot more than Vega  Interplanet, and you know it. I'll finish what he started, and then  maybe I'll begin to deserve what he left me.\"    Raynor Three gripped Bart's hand. He said, in a voice that shook, \"All  right, Bart. You're your father's son. I can't say more than that. I  haven't any right to stop you.\"          CHAPTER SEVEN      \"All right, Bart, today we'll let you look at yourself,\" Raynor Three  said.    Bart smiled under the muffling layers of bandage around his face. His  hands were bandaged, too, and he had not been permitted to look in a  mirror. But the transition had been surprisingly painless--or perhaps  his sense of well-being had been due to Raynor Three slipping him some  drug.    He'd been given injections of a chemical that would change the color of  his skin; there had been minor operations on his face, his hands, his  feet.    \"Let's see you get up and walk around.\"    Bart obeyed awkwardly, and Raynor frowned. \"Hurt?\"    \"Not exactly, but I feel as if I were limping.\"    \"That's to be expected. I changed the angle of the heel tendon and the  muscle of the arch. You're using a different set of muscles when you  walk; until they harden up, you'll have some assorted Charley horses.  Have any trouble hearing me?\"    \"No, though I'd hear better without all these bandages,\" Bart said  impatiently.    \"All in good time. Any trouble breathing?\"    \"No, except for the bandages.\"    \"Fine. I changed the shape of your ears and nostrils, and it might have  affected your hearing or your breathing. Now, listen, Bart: I'm going to  take the bandages off your hands first. Sit down.\"    Bart sat across the table from him, obediently sticking out his hands.  Raynor Three said, \"Shut your eyes.\"    Bart did as he was told and felt Raynor Three's long fingers working at  the bandages.    \"Move each finger as I touch it.\" Bart obeyed, and Raynor said  neutrally, \"Good. Now, take a deep breath and then open your eyes.\"    Impatiently Bart flicked his lids open. In spite of the warning, his  breath went out in a harsh, jolting gasp. His hands lay on the table  before him--but they were not his hands.    The narrow, long fingers were pearl-gray, tipped with whitish-pink claws  that curved out over the tips. Nervously Bart moved one finger, and the  long claw flicked out like a cat's, retracted. He swallowed.    \"Golly!\" He felt strangely wobbly.    \"A beautiful job, if I do say so. Be careful not to scratch yourself,  and practice picking up small things.\"    Bart saw that the long grayish claws were trembling. \"How did you  make--the claws?\"    \"Quite simple, really,\" Raynor beamed. \"I injected protein compounds  into the nail matrix, which speeded up nail growth terrifically, and  then, as they grew, shaped them. Joining on those tiny muscles for the  retracting mechanism was the tricky part though.\"    Bart was moving his hands experimentally. Once over the shock, they felt  quite normal. The claws didn't get in his way half so much as he'd  expected when he picked up a pen that lay beside him and, with the blunt  tip, made a few of the strange-looking dots and wedges that were the  Lhari alphabet.    \"Practice writing this,\" said Raynor Three, and laid a plastic-encased  folder down beside him. It was a set of ship's papers printed in Lhari.  Bart read it through, seeing that it was made out to the equivalent of  Astrogator, First Class, Bartol.    \"That's your name now, the name your father would have used. Memorize  it, get used to the sound of it, practice writing it. Don't worry too  much about the rating; it's an elementary one, what we'd call Apprentice  rating, and I have a training tape for you anyhow. My brother got hold  of it, don't ask me how--and don't ask him!\"    \"When am I going to see my face?\"    \"When I think you're ready for the shock,\" Raynor said bluntly. \"It  almost threw you when I showed you your hands.\"    He made Bart walk around some more briefly, slowly, he unwound the  bandages; then turned and picked up a mirror at the bottom of his  medic's case, turning it right side up. \"Here. But take it easy.\"    But when Bart looked in the mirror he felt no unexpected shock, only an  unnerving revulsion.    His hair was bleached-white and fluffy, almost feathery to the touch.  His skin was grayish-rose, and his eyelids had been altered just enough  to make his eyes look long, narrow and slanted. His nostrils were mere  slits, and he moved his tongue over lips that felt oddly thin.    \"I did as little to your teeth as I thought I could get away with-capped  the front ones,\" Raynor Three told him. \"So if you get a toothache  you're out of luck--you won't dare go to a Lhari dentist. I could have  done more, but it would have made you look too freakish when we changed  you back to human again--if you live that long,\" he added grimly.    _I hadn't thought about that. And if Raynor is going to forget me, who  will do it?_ The cold knot of fear, never wholly absent, moved in him  again.    Watching his face, Raynor Three said gently, \"It's a big network, Bart.  I'm not telling you much, for your own safety. But when you get to  Antares, they'll tell you all you need to know.\"    He lifted Bart's oddly clawed hands. \"I warned you, remember--the change  isn't completely reversible. Your hands will always look--strange. The  fingers had to be lengthened, for instance. I wanted to make you as safe  as possible among the Lhari. I think you'll pass anything but an X-ray.  Just be careful not to break any bones.\"    He gave Bart a package. \"This is the Lhari training tape. Listen to it  as often as you can, then destroy it--_completely_--before you leave  here. The _Swiftwing_ is due in port three days from now, and they stay  here a week. I don't know how we'll manage it, but I'll guarantee  there'll be a vacancy of one Astrogator, First Class, on that ship.\" He  rose. \"And now I'm going back to town and erase the memory.\" He stopped,  looking intently at Bart.    \"So if you see me, stay away from me and don't speak, because I won't  know you from any other Lhari. Understand? From here on, you're on your  own, Bart.\"    He held out his hand. \"This is the rough part, Son.\" His face moved  strangely. \"I'm part of this network between the stars, but I don't know  what I've done before, and I'll never know how it comes out. It's funny  to stand here and look at you and realize that I won't even remember  you.\" The gold-glinted eyes blinked rapidly. \"Goodbye, Bart. And--good  luck, Son.\"    Bart took his hand, deeply moved, with the strange sense that this was  another death--a worse one than Briscoe's. He tried to speak and  couldn't.    \"Well--\" Raynor's mouth twisted into a wry grin. \"Ouch! Careful with  those claws. The Lhari don't shake hands.\"    He turned abruptly and went out of the door and out of Bart's life,  while Bart stood at the dome-window, feeling alone as he had never felt  alone before.           *       *       *       *       *    He had to wait six days, and they felt like six eternities. He played  the training tape over and over. With his Academy background, it wasn't  nearly so difficult as he'd feared. He read and reread the set of papers  identifying him as Astrogator, First Class, Bartol. Forged, he supposed.  Or was there, somewhere, a real Bartol?    The last morning he slept uneasily late. He finished his last meal as a  human, spent part of the day removing all traces of his presence from  Raynor's home, burned the training tape, and"]]]
