You are the kind of fellow that always comes out on top, simply because  you will not allow yourself to be kept down.  Now, look here, I am going  to make a proposition to you--and, understand me, it is on purely  selfish grounds that I am going to make it.  I am going out to South  Africa because I want to forget a--well, a very bitter disappointment  that I have recently sustained, and the particulars of which I will  perhaps tell you some day if you fall in with my proposition, as I hope  you will.  The way in which I propose to conquer this disappointment of  mine is to go in for a life of adventure--exploration of the interior,  big-game shooting, and that sort of thing, you understand.  I have heard  some most thrilling stories of the wonderful things and people that are  to be found in the interior of Africa, and, while many of them are  doubtless lies, there is evidence enough of a perfectly reliable  character to prove that there is at least a certain amount of truth in  others; and it is my purpose to ascertain at firsthand the exact measure  of that truth.  Take, for example, the contention of certain  antiquarians that the ruins of Ophir must exist somewhere upon the east  coast.  I have read pretty nearly everything that has been written upon  that subject, and I am convinced of the soundness of the contention, as  I am also of the contention that Zimbabwe is not ancient Ophir.  Then,  again, there is the statement of the existence of a mysterious white  race in the far interior, which persistently crops up at intervals.  It  would be interesting in the extreme to be able to settle that matter  beyond a doubt, wouldn't it?  Very well, then; my idea is to attempt to  find ancient Ophir, and also the mysterious white race, if possible.    \"Of course I know that what I propose is scarcely in the nature of a  picnic; it no doubt means a good deal of hardship, privation, and  danger; in fact, my friends without exception pronounced me a fool for  thinking of engaging in such an undertaking, while at least half of them  confidently prophesy that if I make the attempt I shall never return.  Well, that is as may be; plenty of better fellows than I have gone under  in such excursions, but, on the other hand, as big duffers as I am have  done great things and turned up again all right, so there is no  particular reason that I can see why I should not do the same.  And so  far as money is concerned I have more than enough to enable me to equip  the expedition in such a manner as to ensure the minimum of discomfort  with the maximum of everything necessary to success.  The only item that  I have had any doubt as to my ability to obtain is--a suitable  companion; for of course in my maddest moments I have never been ass  enough to contemplate going into so big a thing single-handed.  But the  precise kind of man that I want was not to be found either among my  friends or elsewhere at home, so I came away without him, trusting that  I should be lucky enough to pick him up somewhere on the way; and, by  Jove, Maitland, the event has justified my trust; for I have found in  you exactly the kind of man I have had in my mind all along--or, rather,  somebody better, for in addition to your other qualifications you have  very considerable skill as a physician and surgeon, which is what I  never hoped to secure, even in my most sanguine moments.\"    \"Do you wish me to infer, then, that you are proposing to take me as a  hired assistant--or what?\" demanded Dick.    \"Well, yes--and no,\" answered Grosvenor, with a somewhat embarrassed  laugh.  \"As a hired assistant, certainly, because the services of a  fellow like yourself would be of incalculable value to me, especially  when the inevitable sickness comes along.  But I want particularly to  secure you because--well, to be perfectly plain and blunt, because I  have taken a great fancy to you, and because I recognise in you exactly  the qualities that would make of you not only an invaluable assistant  but also a perfectly ideal partner, friend, and companion.  Therefore,  in your capacity as medical attendant to the expedition I propose to  offer you a regular fixed salary of, let us say, two guineas a day, or,  taking one month with another, sixty-five pounds a month--the first six  months to be paid in advance--and, in your capacity of partner, all the  ivory, skins, and other matters which we may accumulate during the  progress of the expedition, except what I may desire to appropriate as  trophies wherewith to adorn the ancestral halls.\"    Dick laughed.  \"Thank you very much,\" he said, \"but I couldn't possibly  accede to your terms; they are altogether too glaringly unfair.  The  salaried part I don't at all object to, because of course if you desire  to include a medical man in your retinue you must pay him a fair salary,  and two guineas a day is not too much, in my opinion.  But when you come  to talk about my share of the spoils, in my capacity of your partner, it  becomes a different matter altogether, since I cannot contribute a  farthing to the expenses of the expedition, therefore I cannot by any  process of reasoning be entitled to any share of its possible profits.  No; if you care to engage me as doctor, at the salary that you have  named, I will accept the post with pleasure and my most hearty thanks,  because the pay will suffice to keep the dear old Mater going; and when  we return to civilisation--if we ever do--I shall be able to set about  the task in earnest of `making my fortune.'\"    \"But, look here my dear fellow,\" remonstrated Grosvenor, \"it is just  nonsense in you--if you will excuse my saying so--to refuse the second  part of my proposal, for this reason.  I am not undertaking this  expedition as a speculation, or with any idea of making it pay.  I have  already a much larger income than I know what to do with, and for that  and other reasons money does not come into the question at all.  Like  other fellows who go hunting, I shall naturally desire to have a few  trophies to exhibit as tokens of my prowess; but, beyond those, I shall  have no use at all for ivory, skins, horns, and such other matters as we  may acquire; therefore you may as well have them as anyone else,  especially as you are avowedly out fortune-hunting.  Besides, two  guineas a day is an altogether inadequate rate of remuneration for a  young fellow of your exceptional ability--why, before you had been  practising a month you would be earning four or five times that amount,  and you will be sacrificing that possibility for an indefinite period if  you elect to join forces with me.  Therefore I contend that if any  profits of any kind accrue to the expedition, you are justly entitled to  them, and I shall not be content unless you consent to take them; indeed  if you refuse I shall be obliged to withdraw my offer altogether, much  as I shall regret having to do so.\"    Under those circumstances there was of course nothing more to be said;  and finally Dick agreed to Grosvenor's proposal in its entirety, the  more readily that, after all, when he came to reflect upon it, there was  much truth in what Grosvenor had said with regard to the possible loss  which Dick might sustain by attaching himself to the expedition and  burying himself in the wilds for a more or less indefinite period.    As time went on there could be no doubt as to the fact that Grosvenor  was genuinely pleased with the arrangement by which he had secured Dick  as his companion in the projected expedition, nor did he make any secret  of the fact that he regarded the terms of the agreement as eminently  satisfactory from his own point of view; while Dick, for his part, felt  that he had done not at all badly in securing a post at a salary of  sixty-five pounds a month, to be enjoyed the moment that he set foot on  shore.  Moreover, that salary was a sure thing for at least six months,  and since Grosvenor insisted upon paying in advance for that period Dick  would be in a position to remit quite a nice little sum home to his  mother, immediately upon his arrival on South African soil.  Both  parties to the agreement were thus equally satisfied, and thenceforward  devoted much of their time to elaborating their plans, in order that no  time should be lost upon their arrival.    Grosvenor, with the confidence of the inexperienced, was quite prepared  unhesitatingly to plunge into the very heart of darkest Africa with no  other companions than Dick, and a few Kafir or Hottentot \"boys\" as  servants; but Dick, although the younger of the two, had discretion  enough to understand that this would be a very unwise thing to do, and  that it would be altogether more prudent in every way to secure the  services of some white man, well acquainted with the country, and the  ways and language of the natives, to act as a sort of general overseer  and factotum, and this view Grosvenor at length somewhat unwillingly  accepted.    Meanwhile, Tom, the injured man, made the most extraordinarily rapid  progress toward recovery, under Dick's skilled treatment, much to the  enhancement of that young gentleman's reputation; and some appreciable  time before the period that Dick had named he was out again and on duty,  very little the worse for his accident save that his right cheek bore a  scar which he would carry with him to his grave.    At length a day arrived when Captain Roberts, having worked out his  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21070"],[0,"A Middy of the Slave Squadron: A West African Story (#10)"],[1,"of a  suppressed snigger from the boat's crew, Mr Perry, with a brief \"Make  way, there, lads,\" sprang upon the thwarts and, striding rapidly from  thwart to thwart, rushed along the length of the boat, placed one foot  lightly on the gunwale, close to the stem head, and leaped out on to the  sand, with me close at his heels.    Together we raced for the crest of the spit; but even before we had  reached it the terrible truth lay plain before us.  For there, about a  quarter of a mile to the southward of us, on the seaward side of the  spit, lay the _Psyche_, hard and fast aground, dismasted, and on her  beam-ends, with the surf pounding at her, and her spars and rigging,  worked up into a raft, floating in the swirl alongside the beach; while  on the shore, opposite where she lay, the little company that had been  left aboard to take care of her laboured to save such flotsam and jetsam  as the surf flung up within their reach.    For a full minute the new skipper, thus by a cruel stroke of malicious  fortune robbed of the command that had been his for such a few brief  hours, stood gazing with stern, set features at the melancholy scene.  Then he turned to me and said--very quietly--    \"Mr Fortescue, be good enough to go down to Mr Hoskins, and request  him, with my compliments, to take the boats back up the river until they  are abreast the spot where the wreck lies, and there beach them; after  which, leaving a boat-keeper to watch each boat, he will take the men  over to the other side of the spit to assist in salving such matters as  may come ashore.  Having delivered this message, you will please join me  yonder.\"  And he pointed to where the little group of men were toiling  on the beach.    \"Ay, ay, sir!\"  I answered.  And, touching my hat, I turned and hurried  down to the river bank, alongside which the other boats were now lying,  with lowered sails, evidently awaiting orders.  Meanwhile Mr Perry  strode off over the ridge in the direction of the wreck.    I quickly found Mr Hoskins and delivered my message, with the result  that the entire flotilla pushed off again and headed up-stream, one of  the men having landed upon the narrow spit and ascended to its ridge in  order that he might notify the boats' crews when they should have  arrived at the spot on the seaward side of which lay the wreck; while I,  burning with curiosity to learn how the disaster had been brought about,  hurried after the skipper.  As he walked, while I ran, I managed to  overtake him at the precise moment when Mr Purchase, who had been left  by Captain Harrison in charge of the ship, met him at a little distance  from the spot where the party of salvors were at work.    \"Mr Purchase,\" said the skipper, as the two men met and halted, \"I  deeply regret to inform you that Captain Harrison is dead--killed this  morning, with one other, while gallantly leading us to the attack of a  strongly defended slave barracoon.  We have both bodies in the boats,  yonder, and it was my intention to have buried them at sea to-night; but  that, I perceive, is no longer possible.  And now, sir, perhaps you will  be good enough to explain to me how the _Psyche_ comes to be where I see  her.\"    \"Ah, sir!\" answered Mr Purchase, removing his hat and mopping his  forehead in great perturbation of spirit, \"I wish I could tell you.  All  I know--all that _any_ of us knows, so far as I have been able to  ascertain--is that we were cut adrift--both cables, sir, cut through as  clean as a whistle--and allowed to drive ashore!\"    \"Cut adrift?\" reiterated the captain incredulously.  \"_Cut adrift_?  Really, my dear Purchase, you must excuse me if I say that I utterly  fail to understand you.  How the mischief could you possibly be cut  adrift from where you were anchored; and by whom?  You surely do not  intend to insinuate that any one of the ship's company--?\"    \"No--no; certainly not,\" interrupted Purchase.  \"Nothing of the kind.  Let me tell you the whole yarn, Perry; then you will be as wise as  myself, and can give me your opinion of the affair, which I admit is  most extraordinary.    \"Nothing in the least remarkable occurred for some hours after the boats  left the ship yesterday morning.  I stood aft and watched you through  the starboard stern port until you had all safely crossed the bar and  disappeared behind the sand spit; and then I set the hands to work upon  various small jobs; after which I went round the ship and satisfied  myself that everything was perfectly safe and snug on deck and below.  Then, feeling tolerably certain that you would not return until to-day  at the earliest, and that consequently it would be necessary for me to  be up and about during the greater part of the coming night, I went  below and turned in all standing, to get as much sleep as possible,  leaving the boatswain's mate in charge of the deck, together with  midshipmen Keene and Parkinson.    \"The day passed quite uneventfully; everything went perfectly smoothly;  the ship rode easily to her anchors; and there had been nothing to  report.  But about two bells in the first dog-watch I noticed that the  sky was beginning to look a bit windy away down in the western quarter--  nothing to speak of, you understand, or to cause any uneasiness; but it  made me take a look at the barometer, and I saw that it had dropped a  trifle since eight bells; and at the same time the wind was distinctly  freshening and the swell gathering weight.  All this, of course, meant  more wind within the next few hours; I therefore kept a sharp eye on the  barometer; and when at four bells I found it still dropping I decided to  let go the two stream anchors, as a precautionary measure, while we had  light enough to see what we were doing; and this I did, at the same time  paying out an extra fifty fathoms on each cable, after which I felt that  we were perfectly safe in the face of anything short of a hurricane.\"    The new skipper nodded his approval, but said nothing; and Purchase  proceeded with his story.    \"Well, as you probably noticed, shortly after sunset the wind breezed up  quite strongly; but I was not in the least uneasy, for the barometer had  ceased to drop before eight bells, and, although the sky was overcast  and the night very dark, there was nothing threatening in the look of  the weather, and it was only occasionally that we really tautened out  our cables.  Still, I made up my mind to remain on deck all night,  having had a good spell of sleep during the day.    \"As the night wore on and the wind held fresh but steady, I felt that  after all I really need not have let go the streams, for the bowers  alone would have held us quite easily against six times as much wind and  sea as we had; you may therefore perhaps be able to picture to yourself  my amazement and consternation when, a few minutes before six bells in  the middle watch, I became aware that the ship was adrift and fast  driving down toward the breakers!\"    \"How did you discover that the ship was adrift?  Did you feel her cables  parting?\" demanded the skipper.    \"No,\" answered Purchase; \"we never felt anything of that kind; but I  suddenly noticed that she was falling off and canting broadside-on to  the wind and sea, so I knew at once that something was wrong--that in  fact we had, in some incomprehensible way, struck adrift.  I therefore  sang out to Thompson, the boatswain's mate, to pipe all hands to make  sail, intending to run her into the river, if possible.  But by the time  that we had got the mizzen and fore-topmast staysail upon her, and were  loosing the main-topmast staysail, we were in the first line of  breakers; and a moment later she struck heavily.  Then a big comber came  roaring in and broke over us, lifted us up, swept us shoreward a good  twenty fathoms, and we struck again, with such violence this time that  all three masts went over the side together.  After that we had a very  bad half-hour, for every roller that came in swept clean over us,  carrying away everything that was movable, smashing the bulwarks flat,  and hammering the poor old barkie so furiously upon the sand that I  momentarily expected her to go to pieces under our feet.  To add to our  difficulties, it was so intensely dark that we could not see where we  were; true, the water all round us was ablaze with phosphorescence,  which enabled us to discern that land of some sort lay about a couple of  cables' lengths to leeward of us, but it was quite indistinguishable,  and the water between us and it was leaping and spouting so furiously  that I did not feel justified in making any attempt to get the men  ashore, especially as we were then being swept so heavily that we had  all our work cut out to hold on for our lives.  About half an hour  later, however, the tide turned and began to ebb, and then matters  improved a bit.    \"But it was not until daybreak that we were able to do anything really  useful; and then all hands of us got to work and built a raft of sorts,  after which we got up a good supply of provisions and water, sails to  serve as tents, light line, and, in short, everything likely to be  useful, and managed to get ashore without very much difficulty.  But  before I left the ship I had the cables hauled in through the hawse-  pipes, and examined them most carefully.  They were both unmistakably  cut through--a clean cut, sir, evidently done with a sharp knife--at  about the level of the water's edge.\"    \"Most extraordinary!\" commented Perry.  \"And I presume nobody saw  anything, either immediately before you went adrift or afterwards--no  boat, or anything of that kind, I mean--to account for the affair?\"    \"No,\" answered Purchase, \"nothing.  Yet I was not only wide-awake and on  the alert myself, but I took care that the anchor watch should be so  also; for I felt the responsibility of having such a ship as the  _Psyche_ to take care of, with only twenty hands, all told, to"]]]
