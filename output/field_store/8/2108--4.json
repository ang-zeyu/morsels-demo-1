By the statutes of the university, the bookseller was  not allowed to expose his transcripts for sale, without first submitting  them to the inspection of certain officers appointed by the university,  and if an error was discovered, the copies were ordered to be burnt or a  fine levied on them, proportionate to their inaccuracy. Harsh and  stringent as this may appear at first sight, we shall modify our opinion,  on recollecting that the student was in a great degree dependent upon the  care of the transcribers for the fidelity of his copies, which rendered a  rule of this nature almost indispensable; nor should we forget the great  service it bestowed in maintaining the primitive accuracy of ancient  writers, and in transmitting them to us through those ages in their  original purity.[71]    In these times of free trade and unrestrained commercial policy, we shall  regard less favorably a regulation which they enforced at Paris,  depriving the bookseller of the power of fixing a price upon his own  goods. Four booksellers were appointed and sworn in to superintend this  department, and when a new transcript was finished, it was brought by the  bookseller, and they discussed its merits and fixed its value, which  formed the amount the bookseller was compelled to ask for it; if he  demanded of his customer a larger sum, it was deemed a fraudulent  imposition, and punishable as such. Moreover, as an advantage to the  students, the bookseller was expected to make a considerable reduction in  his profits in supplying them with books; by one of the laws of the  university, his profit on each volume was confined to four deniers to  student, and six deniers to a common purchaser. The librarii were still  further restricted in the economy of their trade, by a rule which forbade  any one of them to dispose of his entire stock of books without the  consent of the university; but this, I suspect, implied the disposal of  the stock and trade together, and was intended to intimate that the  introduction of the purchaser would not be allowed, without the  cognizance and sanction of the university.[72] Nor was the bookseller  able to purchase books without her consent, lest they should be of an  immoral or heretical tendency; and they were absolutely forbidden to buy  any of the students, without the permission of the rector.    But restricted as they thus were, the book merchants nevertheless grew  opulent, and transacted an important and extensive trade; sometimes they  purchased parts and sometimes they had whole libraries to sell.[73] Their  dealings were conducted with unusual care, and when a volume of peculiar  rarity or interest was to be sold, a deed of conveyance was drawn up with  legal precision, in the presence of authorized witnesses.    In those days of high prices and book scarcity, the poor student was  sorely impeded in his progress; to provide against these disadvantages,  they framed a law in 1342, at Paris, compelling all public booksellers to  keep books to lend out on hire. The reader will be surprised at the idea  of a circulating library in the middle ages! but there can be no doubt  of the fact, they were established at Paris, Toulouse, Vienna, and  Bologne. These public librarians, too, were obliged to write out regular  catalogues of their books and hang them up in their shops, with the  prices affixed, so that the student might know beforehand what he had to  pay for reading them. I am tempted to give a few extracts from these  lists:        St. Gregory's Commentaries upon Job, for reading 100 pages, 8 sous.      St. Gregory's Book of Homilies, 28 pages for 12 deniers.      Isidore's De Summa bona, 24 pages, 12 deniers.      Anselm's De Veritate de Libertate Arbitrii, 40 pages, 2 sous.      Peter Lombard's Book of Sentences, 3 sous.      Scholastic History, 3 sous.      Augustine's Confessions, 21 pages, 4 deniers.      Gloss on Matthew, by brother Thomas Aquinas, 57 pages, 3 sous.      Bible Concordance, 9 sous.      Bible, 10 sous.[74]    This rate of charge was also fixed by the university, and the students  borrowing these books were privileged to transcribe them if they chose;  if any of them proved imperfect or faulty, they were denounced by the  university, and a fine imposed upon the bookseller who had lent out the  volume.    This potent influence exercised by the universities over booksellers  became, in time, much abused, and in addition to these commercial  restraints, they assumed a still less warrantable power over the  original productions of authors; and became virtually the public censors  of books, and had the power of burning or prohibiting any work of  questionable orthodoxy. In the time of Henry the Second, a book was  published by being read over for two or three successive days, before one  of the universities, and if they approved of its doctrines and bestowed  upon it their approbation, it was allowed to be copied extensively for  sale.    Stringent as the university rules were, as regards the bookselling trade,  they were, nevertheless, sometimes disregarded or infringed; some  ventured to take more for a book than the sum allowed, and, by  prevarication and secret contracts, eluded the vigilance of the laws.[75]  Some were still bolder, and openly practised the art of a scribe and the  profession of a bookseller, without knowledge or sanction of the  university. This gave rise to much jealousy, and in the University of  Oxford, in the year 1373, they made a decree forbidding any person  exposing books for sale without her licence.[76]    Now, considering all these usages of early bookselling, their numbers,  their opulence, and above all, the circulating libraries which the  librarii established, can we still retain the opinion that books were so  inaccessible in those ante-printing days, when we know that for a few  sous the booklover could obtain good and authenticated copies to peruse,  or transcribe? It may be advanced that these facts solely relate to  universities, and were intended merely to insure a supply of the  necessary books in constant requisition by the students, but such was not  the case; the librarii were essentially public _Librorum Venditores_, and  were glad to dispose of their goods to any who could pay for them.  Indeed, the early bibliomaniacs usually flocked to these book marts to  rummage over the stalls, and to collect their choice volumes. Richard de  Bury obtained many in this way, both at Paris and at Rome.    Of the exact pecuniary value of books during the middle ages, we have no  means of judging. The few instances that have accidentally been recorded  are totally inadequate to enable us to form an opinion. The extravagant  estimate given by some as to the value of books in those days is merely  conjectural, as it necessarily must be, when we remember that the price  was guided by the accuracy of the transcription, the splendor of the  binding, which was often gorgeous to excess, and by the beauty and  richness of the illuminations.[77] Many of the manuscripts of the middle  ages are magnificent in the extreme. Sometimes they inscribed the gospels  and the venerated writings of the fathers with liquid gold, on parchment  of the richest purple,[78] and adorned its brilliant pages with  illuminations of exquisite workmanship.    The first specimens we have of an attempt to embellish manuscripts are  Egyptian. It was a common practice among them at first to color the  initial letter of each chapter or division of their work, and afterwards  to introduce objects of various kinds into the body of the manuscript.    The splendor of the ancient calligraphical productions of Greece,[79] and  the still later ones of Rome, bear repeated testimony that the practice  of this art had spread during the sixth century, if not earlier, to these  powerful empires. England was not tardy in embracing this elegant art. We  have many relics of remote antiquity and exquisite workmanship existing  now, which prove the talent and assiduity of our early Saxon forefathers.    In Ireland the illuminating art was profusely practised at a period as  early as the commencement of the seventh century, and in the eighth we  find it holding forth eminent claims to our respect by the beauty of  their workmanship, and the chastity of their designs. Those well versed  in the study of these ancient manuscripts have been enabled, by extensive  but minute observation, to point out their different characteristics in  various ages, and even to decide upon the school in which a particular  manuscript was produced.    These illuminations, which render the early manuscripts of the monkish  ages so attractive, generally exemplify the rude ideas and tastes of the  time. In perspective they are wofully deficient, and manifest but little  idea of the picturesque or sublime; but here and there we find quite a  gem of art, and, it must be owned, we are seldom tired by monotony of  coloring, or paucity of invention. A study of these parchment  illustrations afford considerable instruction. Not only do they indicate  the state of the pictorial art in the middle ages, but also give us a  comprehensive insight into the scriptural ideas entertained in those  times; and the bible student may learn much from pondering on these  glittering pages; to the historical student, and to the lover of  antiquities, they offer a verdant field of research, and he may obtain in  this way many a glimpse of the manners and customs of those old times  which the pages of the monkish chroniclers have failed to record.    But all this prodigal decoration greatly enhanced the price of books, and  enabled them to produce a sum, which now to us sounds enormously  extravagant. Moreover, it is supposed that the scarcity of parchment  limited the number of books materially, and prevented their increase to  any extent;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21632"],[0,"Fame and Fortune; or, The Progress of Richard Hunter (#10)"],[1," be decidedly in favor of it. That  reminds me that you were late to breakfast this morning, Miss Peyton.\"    \"Oh, ladies mustn't be expected to pay fines,\" said Miss Peyton, shaking  her ringlets. \"They never have any money, you know.\"    \"Then I think we must let Mr. Hunter off,\" said Mrs. Browning.    \"If he will tell us what has detained him. You must excuse my curiosity,  Mr. Hunter, but ladies, you know, are privileged to be curious.\"    \"I don't mind telling,\" said Dick, helping himself to a piece of toast.  \"I'm talking of buying some lots up-town, and went up with a friend to  look at them.\"    Fosdick looked at Dick, inquiringly, not knowing if he were in earnest  or not.    \"Indeed!\" said Mr. Clifton. \"May I inquire where the lots are situated?\"    \"I'll tell you if I buy them,\" said Dick; \"but I don't want to run the  risk of losing them.\"    \"You needn't be afraid of my cutting you out,\" said Clifton. \"I paid my  washerwoman this morning, and haven't got but a dollar and a half over.  I suppose that won't buy the property.\"    \"I wish it would,\" said Dick. \"In that case I'd buy half a dozen lots.\"    \"I suppose, from your investing in lots, Mr. Hunter, that you are  thinking of getting married, and living in a house of your own,\" said  Miss Peyton, simpering.    \"No,\" said Dick, \"I shan't get married for a year. Nobody ought to be  married before they're seventeen.\"    \"That's just my age,\" said Miss Peyton.    Mr. Clifton afterwards informed Dick that Miss Peyton was twenty-five,  but did not mention how he had ascertained. He likewise added that when  he first came to the boarding-house, she had tried her fascinations upon  him.    \"She'd have married me in a minute,\" he said complacently; \"but I'm too  old a bird to be caught that way. When you see Mrs. Clifton, gentlemen,  you'll see style and beauty, and--_money_\" he added, after a moment's  reflection.    Mr. Clifton had a tolerably good opinion of himself, as may be inferred  from this remark. In fact, he valued himself rather more highly than the  ladies appeared to do; but such cases are not remarkable.    \"Mrs. Clifton will be a lucky woman,\" said Dick, with a sober face.    \"You're very kind to say so,\" said Mr. Clifton, modestly. \"I believe I'm  tolerably good-looking, and nobody'll deny that I've got style. But  money,--that's my weak point. You couldn't lend me five dollars, could  you, till next week?\"    \"I'm afraid not,\" said Dick. \"My up-town lots cost so much, and then  there'll be the taxes afterwards.\"    \"Oh, it's of no consequence. I thought a little of going to the opera  to-night, and I need a new pair of gloves. It costs a sight to keep a  fellow in gloves.\"    \"So it does,\" said Dick. \"I bought a pair for fifty cents six months  ago, and now I've got to buy another pair.\"    \"Ha, ha! good joke! By the way, I wonder you fellows don't take a better  room.\"    \"Why should we? Isn't this good enough?\" asked Fosdick.    \"Oh, it's comfortable and all that,\" said Clifton; \"but you know what I  mean. You wouldn't want any of your fashionable friends to call upon you  here.\"    \"That's a fact,\" said Dick. \"Suppose,\" he said, turning to Fosdick, with  a twinkle in his eye, \"Johnny Nolan should call upon us here. What would  he think of our living in such a room?\"    \"He would probably be surprised,\" said Fosdick, entering into the joke.    \"Is he one of your Madison-Avenue friends?\" asked Clifton, a little  mystified.    \"I don't know where he lives,\" said Dick, with truth; \"but he's a friend  of mine, in business down town.\"    \"Wholesale or retail?\"    \"Retail I should say,--shouldn't you, Fosdick?\"    \"Yes,\" said Fosdick, amused at Clifton's evident mystification.    \"Well, good-evening, gents,\" said Clifton, sauntering out of the room.  \"Call and see me when you haven't anything better to do.\"    \"Thank you. Good-night.\"    \"Were you in earnest, Dick, about the up-town lots,\" asked Fosdick,  after Clifton had left the room.    \"Yes,\" said Dick. \"It's an investment that Mr. Murdock advised. I'll  tell you about it, and then you can tell me what you think of it.\"    Dick thereupon gave an account of the conversation that had taken place  between him and the head clerk, and what they proposed to do. \"What do  you think of it?\" he concluded.    \"I have no doubt it is an excellent plan,\" said Fosdick; \"but of course  my opinion isn't worth much. I don't see but you stand a chance to be a  rich man some time, Dick.\"    \"By the time I get to be a hundred,\" said Dick.    \"A good while before that, I presume. But there's something else we must  not forget.\"    \"What is that?\"    \"Money is a good thing to have, but a good education is better. I was  thinking to-day that since we have come here we haven't done any  studying to amount to anything.\"    \"That is true.\"    \"And the sooner we begin the better.\"    \"All right. I agree to that.\"    \"But we shall need assistance. I've taught you about all I know myself,  and now we want to go higher.\"    \"What shall we do?\"    \"I'll tell you, Dick. Have you noticed the young man that has a room  just opposite ours?\"    \"His name is Layton,--isn't it?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"What about him?\"    \"I heard yesterday that he was a teacher in a private school. We might  engage him to teach us in the evening, or, at any rate, see if he is  willing.\"    \"All right. Is he in now, I wonder?\"    \"Yes. I heard him go into his room a few minutes since.\"    \"Very well; suppose we go in and speak to him.\"    The boys at once acted upon this suggestion, and, crossing the entry,  knocked at the door.    \"Come in!\" said a voice from within.    The door being opened, they found themselves in the presence of a young  man of pleasant appearance, apparently about twenty-five years of age.    \"Good-evening, gentlemen,\" he said. \"I am glad to see you. Will you have  seats?\"    \"Thank you,\" said Fosdick. \"We came in on a little business. I  understand you are a teacher, Mr. Layton.\"    \"Yes, I am engaged in a private school in the city.\"    \"My friend and myself are engaged in business during the day, but we  feel that our education is quite deficient, and we want to make  arrangements to study evenings. We cannot do this to advantage without  assistance. Are you occupied during the evenings?\"    \"No, I am not.\"    \"Perhaps you would not like teaching in the evening, after being engaged  in the daytime.\"    \"On the contrary, I have been hoping to secure scholars; but I hardly  knew how to set about it.\"    \"Are you acquainted with the French language, Mr. Layton?\"    \"Yes, I am tolerably familiar with it. I studied it at college with a  native teacher.\"    \"If you are a college graduate, then, you will be able to teach us  whatever we desire to learn. But I am afraid we may not be able to make  it worth your while. We have neither of us large salaries. But if four  dollars a week--two dollars for each of us--would be satisfactory--\"    \"I shall be satisfied with it,\" said Mr. Layton. \"In fact,\" he added,  frankly, \"I shall consider it quite a welcome addition to my salary. My  father died a year since, and my mother and sister are compelled to  depend upon me in part for support. But I have not been able to do as  much for them as I wished. This addition to my earnings will give me the  means of increasing their comforts.\"    \"Then it will be a pleasant arrangement all round,\" said Fosdick. \"What  would you advise us to study?\"    After a few inquiries as to their present attainments, Mr. Layton  recommended a course of mathematics, beginning with algebra, history,  and the French language. He gave the boys a list of the books they would  be likely to need.    The next evening the boys commenced studying, and determined to devote  an hour and a half each evening to mental improvement. They found Mr.  Layton an excellent teacher, and he on his side found them very apt  pupils.    Dick had an active, intelligent mind, and an excellent capacity, and  Fosdick had always had a thirst for learning, which he was now able to  gratify. As his salary would have been insufficient to pay his expenses  and the teacher besides, he was obliged to have recourse to his little  fund in the savings bank. Dick offered to assist him, but Fosdick would  not consent. Just as his savings were about exhausted, his wages were  raised two dollars a week, and this enabled him to continue the  arrangement without assistance.    In the course of a few weeks the boys commenced reading French, and  found it quite interesting.          CHAPTER IX.    ROSWELL CRAWFORD AT HOME.      While Fosdick and Dick are devoting their evenings to study, under the  guidance of Mr. Layton, we will direct the reader's attention to a young  gentleman who considered himself infinitely superior in the social scale  to either. Roswell Crawford could never forget that Dick had once been a  boot-black, and looked upon it as an outrage that such a boy should be  earning a salary of ten dollars a week, while he--a gentleman's son--was  only paid four, which he regarded as a beggarly pittance. Roswell's  father had once kept a small dry goods store on Broadway, but failed  after being in business a little less than a year. This constituted his  claim to gentility. After his failure, Mr. Crawford tried several kinds  of business, without succeeding in any. His habits were not strictly  temperate, and he had died two years previous. His wife hired a house in  Clinton Place, and took boarders, barely succeeding in making both ends  meet at the end of the year. The truth was that she was not a good  manager, and preferred to talk of her gentility and former wealth to  looking after the affairs of the household. She was very much like her  son in this respect.    Among Mrs. Crawford's boarders was Mr. Gilbert, who is already known to  the reader as the book-keeper of Rockwell & Cooper. It has been  mentioned also that he was Roswell's cousin, being a son of Mrs.  Crawford's only brother."]]]
