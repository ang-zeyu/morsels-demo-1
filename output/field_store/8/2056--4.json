Truman, 24 Jun 53. Last two in Nichols                     Collection, CMH. These interviews are among many                     compiled by Nichols as part of his program                     associated with the production of _Breakthrough on                     the Color Front_ (New York: Random House, 1954).                     Nichols, a journalist, presented this collection of                     interviews, along with other documents and                     materials, to the Center of Military History in                     1972. The interviews have proved to be a valuable                     supplement to the official record. They capture the                     thoughts of a number of important participants,                     some no longer alive, at a time relatively close to                     the events under consideration. They have been                     checked against the sources whenever possible and                     found accurate.]                       [Footnote 2-3: Memo, ACofS, G-3, for CofS, 3 Jun 40,                     sub: Employment of Negro Manpower, G-3/6541-527.]    The White House tried to adjust the conflicting demands of the civil  rights leaders and the Army traditionalists. Eager to placate and  willing to compromise, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sought an  accommodation by directing the War Department to provide jobs for  Negroes in all parts of the Army. The controversy over integration  soon became more public, the opponents less reconcilable; in the weeks  following the President's meeting with black representatives on 27  September 1940 the Army countered black demands for integration with a  statement released by the White House on 9 October. To provide \"a fair  and equitable basis\" for the use of Negroes in its expansion program,  the Army planned to accept Negroes in numbers approximate to their  proportion in the national population, about 10 percent. Black  officers and enlisted men were to serve, as was then customary, only  in black units that were to be formed in each major branch, both  combatant and noncombatant, including air units to be created as soon  as pilots, mechanics, and technical specialists were trained. There  would be no racial intermingling in regimental organizations because  the practice of separating white and black troops had, the Army staff  said, proved satisfactory over a long period of time. To change would  destroy morale and impair preparations for national defense. Since  black units in the Army were already \"going concerns, accustomed  through many years to the present system\" of segregation, \"no  experiments should be tried ... at this critical time.\"[2-4]                       [Footnote 2-4: Memo, TAG for CG's et al., 16 Oct 40,                     sub: War Department Policy in Regard to Negroes, AG                     291.21 (10-9-40) M-A-M.]    The President's \"OK, F.D.R.\" on the War Department statement       (p. 019)  transformed what had been a routine prewar mobilization plan into a  racial policy that would remain in effect throughout the war. In fact,  quickly elevated in importance by War Department spokesmen who made  constant reference to the \"Presidential Directive,\" the statement  would be used by some Army officials as a presidential sanction for  introducing segregation in new situations, as, for example, in the  pilot training of black officers in the Army Air Corps. Just as  quickly, the civil rights leaders, who had expected more from the tone  of the President's own comments and more also from the egalitarian  implications of the new draft law, bitterly attacked the Army's  policy.    Black criticism came at an awkward moment for President Roosevelt, who  was entering a heated campaign for an unprecedented third term and  whose New Deal coalition included the urban black vote. His opponent,  the articulate Wendell L. Willkie, was an unabashed champion of civil  rights and was reportedly attracting a wide following among black  voters. In the weeks preceding the election the President tried to  soften the effect of the Army's announcement. He promoted Col.  Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., to brigadier general, thereby making Davis the  first Negro to hold this rank in the Regular Army. He appointed the  commander of reserve officers' training at Howard University, Col.  Campbell C. Johnson, Special Aide to the Director of Selective  Service. And, finally, he named Judge William H. Hastie, dean of the  Howard University Law School, Civilian Aide to the Secretary of War.    A successful lawyer, Judge Hastie entered upon his new assignment with  several handicaps. Because of his long association with black causes,  some civil rights organizations assumed that Hastie would be their man  in Washington and regarded his duties as an extension of their crusade  against discrimination. Hastie's War Department superiors, on the  other hand, assumed that his was a public relations job and expected  him to handle all complaints and mobilization problems as had his  World War I predecessor, Emmett J. Scott. Both assumptions proved  false. Hastie was evidently determined to break the racial logjam in  the War Department, yet unlike many civil rights advocates he seemed  willing to pay the price of slow progress to obtain lasting  improvement. According to those who knew him, Hastie was confident  that he could demonstrate to War Department officials that the Army's  racial policies were both inefficient and unpatriotic.[2-5]                       [Footnote 2-5: The foregoing impressions are derived                     largely from Interviews, Lee Nichols with James C.                     Evans, who worked for Judge Hastie during World War                     II, and Ulysses G. Lee (c. 1953). Both in Nichols                     Collection, CMH.]    Judge Hastie spent his first ten months in office observing what was  happening to the Negro in the Army. He did not like what he saw. To  him, separating black soldiers from white soldiers was a fundamental  error. First, the effect on black morale was devastating. \"Beneath the  surface,\" he wrote, \"is widespread discontent. Most white persons are  unable to appreciate the rancor and bitterness which the Negro, as a  matter of self-preservation, has learned to hide beneath a smile, a  joke, or merely an impassive face.\" The inherent paradox of trying to  inculcate pride, dignity, and aggressiveness in a black soldier while  inflicting on him the segregationist's concept of the Negro's      (p. 020)  place in society created in him an insupportable tension. Second,  segregation wasted black manpower, a valuable military asset. It was  impossible, Hastie charged, to employ skilled Negroes at maximum  efficiency within the traditionally narrow limitations of black units.  Third, to insist on an inflexible separation of white and black  soldiers was \"the most dramatic evidence of hypocrisy\" in America's  professed concern for preserving democracy.    Although he appreciated the impossibility of making drastic changes  overnight, Judge Hastie was disturbed because he found \"no apparent  disposition to make a beginning or a trial of any different plan.\" He  looked for some form of progressive integration by which qualified  Negroes could be classified and assigned, not by race, but as  individuals, according to their capacities and abilities.[2-6]                       [Footnote 2-6: Memo, William H. Hastie for SW, with                     attachment, 22 Sep 41, sub: Survey and                     Recommendations Concerning the Integration of the                     Negro Soldiers Into the Army, G-1/15640-120. See                     also Intervs, Nichols with Evans and Lee.]    [Illustration: JUDGE HASTIE.]    Judge Hastie gained little support from the Secretary of War, Henry L.  Stimson, or the Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, when he  called for progressive integration. Both considered the Army's  segregated units to be in accord with prevailing public sentiment  against mixing the races in the intimate association of military life.  More to the point, both Stimson and Marshall were sensitive to  military tradition, and segregated units had been a part of the Army  since 1863. Stimson embraced segregation readily. While conveying to  the President that he was \"sensitive to the individual tragedy which  went with it to the colored man himself,\" he nevertheless urged  Roosevelt not to place \"too much responsibility on a race which was  not showing initiative in battle.\"[2-7] Stimson's attitude was not  unusual for the times. He professed to believe in civil rights for  every citizen, but he opposed social integration. He never tried to  reconcile these seemingly inconsistent views; in fact, he probably did  not consider them inconsistent. Stimson blamed what he termed Eleanor  Roosevelt's \"intrusive and impulsive folly\" for some of the criticism  visited upon the Army's racial policy, just as he inveighed against  the \"foolish"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2060"],[0,"The History of Caliph Vathek (#10)"],[1,"patience; he began to  bellow, and even beat himself (for there was no seeing in the dark).  The  rumour every instant increased, and Bababalouk, finding no good could be  done with his master, stopped both his ears against the hurly-burly of  the harem, and called out aloud: \"Come, ladies and brothers! all hands to  work! strike light in a moment! never shall it be said that the Commander  of the Faithful served to regale these infidel brutes.\"    Though there wanted not in this bevy of beauties a sufficient number of  capricious and wayward, yet on the present occasion they were all  compliance; fires were visible in a twinkling in all their cages; ten  thousand torches were lighted at once; the Caliph himself seized a large  one of wax; every person followed his example, and, by kindling ropes'  ends dipped in oil and fastened on poles, an amazing blaze was spread.  The rocks were covered with the splendour of sunshine; the trails of  sparks wafted by the wind communicated to the dry fern, of which there  was plenty.  Serpents were observed to crawl forth from their retreats  with amazement and hissings, whilst the horses snorted, stamped the  ground, tossed their noses in the air, and plunged about without mercy.    One of the forests of cedar that bordered their way took fire, and the  branches that overhung the path, extending their flames to the muslins  and chintzes which covered the cages of the ladies, obliged them to jump  out, at the peril of their necks.  Vathek, who vented on the occasion a  thousand blasphemies, was himself compelled to touch with his sacred feet  the naked earth.    Never had such an incident happened before.  Full of mortification,  shame, and despondence, and not knowing how to walk, the ladies fell into  the dirt.  \"Must I go on foot?\" said one; \"Must I wet my feet?\" cried  another; \"Must I soil my dress?\" asked a third; \"Execrable Bababalouk!\"  exclaimed all; \"Outcast of hell! what hadst thou to do with torches?  Better were it to be eaten by tigers than to fall into our present  condition! we are for ever undone!  Not a porter is there in the army,  nor a currier of camels, but hath seen some part of our bodies, and, what  is worse, our very faces!\"  On saying this the most bashful amongst them  hid their foreheads on the ground, whist such as had more boldness flew  at Bababalouk; but he, well apprized of their humour, and not wanting in  shrewdness, betook himself to his heels along with his comrades, all  dropping their torches and striking their tymbals.    It was not less light than in the brightest of the dog-days, and the  weather was hot in proportion; but how degrading was the spectacle, to  behold the Caliph bespattered like an ordinary mortal!  As the exercise  of his faculties seemed to be suspended, one of his Ethiopian wives (for  he delighted in variety) clasped him in her arms, threw him upon her  shoulder like a sack of dates, and finding that the fire was hemming them  in, set off with no small expedition, considering the weight of her  burden.  The other ladies, who had just learnt the use of their feet,  followed her, their guards galloped after, and the camel-drivers brought  up the rear as fast as their charge would permit.    They soon reached the spot where the wild beasts had commenced the  carnage, and which they had too much spirit to leave, notwithstanding the  approaching tumult and the luxurious supper they had made; Bababalouk  nevertheless seized on a few of the plumpest, which were unable to budge  from the place, and began to flay them with admirable adroitness.  The  cavalcade being got so far from the conflagration as that the heat felt  rather grateful than violent, it was immediately resolved on to halt.  The tattered chintzes were picked up, the scraps left by the wolves and  tigers interred, and vengeance was taken on some dozens of vultures that  were too much glutted to rise on the wing.  The camels, which had been  left unmolested to make sal ammoniac, being numbered, and the ladies once  more enclosed in their cages, the imperial tent was pitched on the  levellest ground they could find.    Vathek, reposing upon a mattress of down, and tolerably recovered from  the jolting of the Ethiopian, who to his feelings seemed the roughest  trotting jade he had hitherto mounted, called out for something to eat.  But, alas! those delicate cakes which had been baked in silver ovens for  his royal mouth, those rich manchets, amber comfits, flagons of Schiraz  wine, porcelain vases of snow, and grapes from the banks of the Tigris,  were all irremediably lost!  And nothing had Bababalouk to present in  their stead but a roasted wolf, vultures _a la daube_, aromatic herbs of  the most acrid poignancy, rotten truffles, boiled thistles, and such  other wild plants as most ulcerate the throat and parch up the tongue.  Nor was he better provided in the article of drink, for he could procure  nothing to accompany these irritating viands but a few vials of  abominable brandy, which had been secreted by the scullions in their  slippers.    Vathek made wry faces at so savage a repast, and Bababalouk answered them  with shrugs and contortions; the Caliph, however, ate with tolerable  appetite, and fell into a nap that lasted six hours.  The splendour of  the sun reflected from the white cliffs of the mountains, in spite of the  curtains that enclosed him, at length disturbed his repose; he awoke  terrified, and stung to the quick by those wormwood-coloured flies, which  emit from their wings a suffocating stench.  The miserable monarch was  perplexed how to act, though his wits were not idle in seeking  expedients, whilst Bababalouk lay snoring amidst a swarm of those  insects, that busily thronged to pay court to his nose.  The little  pages, famished with hunger, had dropped their fans on the ground, and  exerted their dying voices in bitter reproaches on the Caliph, who now  for the first time heard the language of truth.    Thus stimulated, he renewed his imprecations against the Giaour, and  bestowed upon Mahomet some soothing expressions.  \"Where am I?\" cried he;  \"what are these dreadful rocks? these valleys of darkness? are we arrived  at the horrible Kaf? is the Simurgh coming to pluck out my eyes, as a  punishment for undertaking this impious enterprise!\"  Having said this,  he bellowed like a calf and turned himself towards an outlet in the side  of his pavilion; but, alas! what objects occurred to his view! on one  side a plain of black sand that appeared to be unbounded, and on the  other perpendicular crags, bristled over with those abominable thistles  which had so severely lacerated his tongue.  He fancied, however, that he  perceived, amongst the brambles and briers, some gigantic flowers, but  was mistaken; for these were only the dangling palampores and variegated  tatters of his gay retinue.  As there were several clefts in the rock  from whence water seemed to have flowed, Vathek applied his ear, with the  hope of catching the sound of some latent runnel, but could only  distinguish the low murmurs of his people, who were repining at their  journey, and complaining for the want of water.    \"To what purpose,\" asked they, \"have we been brought hither?  Hath our  Caliph another tower to build? or have the relentless Afrits, whom  Carathis so much loves, fixed in this place their abode?\"    At the name of Carathis Vathek recollected the tablets he had received  from his mother, who assured him they were fraught with preternatural  qualities, and advised him to consult them as emergencies might require.  Whilst he was engaged in turning them over he heard a shout of joy and a  loud clapping of hands; the curtains of his pavilion were soon drawn  back, and he beheld Bababalouk, followed by a troop of his favourites,  conducting two dwarfs, each a cubit high, who brought between them a  large basket of melons, oranges, and pomegranates.  They were singing in  the sweetest tones the words that follow:    \"We dwell on the top of these rocks in a cabin of rushes and canes; the  eagles envy us our nest; a small spring supplies us with Abdest, and we  daily repeat prayers which the Prophet approves.  We love you, O  Commander of the Faithful! our master, the good Emir Fakreddin, loves you  also; he reveres in your person the vicegerent of Mahomet.  Little as we  are, in us he confides; he knows our hearts to be good as our bodies are  contemptible, and hath placed us here to aid those who are bewildered on  these dreary mountains.  Last night, whilst we were occupied within our  cell in reading the holy Koran, a sudden hurricane blew out our lights  and rocked our habitation; for two whole hours a palpable darkness  prevailed, but we heard sounds at a distance which we conjectured to  proceed from the bells of a Cafila passing over the rocks; our ears were  soon filled with deplorable shrieks, frightful roarings, and the sound of  tymbals.  Chilled with terror, we concluded that the Deggial, with his  exterminating angels, had sent forth their plagues on the earth.  In the  midst of these melancholy reflections we perceived flames of the deepest  red glow in the horizon, and found ourselves in a few moments covered  with flakes of fire; amazed at so strange an appearance, we took up the  volume dictated by the blessed Intelligence, and, kneeling by the light  of the fire that surrounded us, we recited the verse which says: 'Put no  trust in anything but the mercy of Heaven; there is no help save in the  holy Prophet; the mountain of Kaf itself may tremble, it is the power of  Allah only that cannot be moved.'  After having pronounced these words we  felt consolation, and our minds were hushed into a sacred repose; silence  ensued, and our ears clearly distinguished a voice in the air, saying:  'Servants of my faithful servant! go down to the happy valley of  Fakreddin; tell him that an illustrious opportunity now offers to satiate  the"]]]
