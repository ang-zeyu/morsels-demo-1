After writing it, place it in a square or oblong envelope--round  ones are no longer fashionable--seal it on the back and write a  legible address on the front; then take a two-cent stamp, give it a  good licking and retire it to the corner--the upper, right-hand  corner, on the outside--never inside, as the postmaster is not a  clairvoyant. Drop it in a letter-box and trust to luck. If it's a  love letter, it will probably reach her all right, for Cupid is a  faithful postman and carries a stout pair of wings. If it's a bill,  by all means have it registered; otherwise, your debtor will swear  he never got it. If it's cash for your tailor, heed the post-office  warning, \"Don't send money through the mails.\" Wait until you happen  to meet him on the street. If he sees you first, you lose.      =First-class Matter.=    Anything you are ashamed to have the postmaster or postmistress  read, and therefore seal up, is known as first-class matter. Also,  postal cards, where you're only allowed to argue on one side. If you  think your letter should travel slowly, invest ten cents in a  Special Delivery Stamp. This will insure a nice, leisurely journey,  lasting from one to two days longer than by the cheap two-cent  route.      =Second-class Matter.=    This class was originated for the benefit of Patent Medicine Mixers,  who print circulars on \"What Ails You\" four times a year, and pepper  the land with \"Before-and-after-taking\" caricatures, at the rate of  one cent a pound.      =Third-class Matter.=    While the quack nostrums travel second-class for one cent a pound,  books, engravings, manuscript copy, and works of art have to go  third-class and are taxed one cent for every two ounces. They must  also be left open for inspection, thus affording the post-office  employee a fleeting acquaintance with something really useful.      =Fourth-class Matter.=    Everything not included in the above, except poisons, explosives,  live animals, insects, inflammable articles, and things giving off a  bad odor.

They  believed that a select company of angels were appointed guardians of  mankind, but that, notwithstanding this, evil increased: men grew  wicked and perverse in their ways, and therefore the deluge was sent  to sweep them away. The Gaures had their guardian angels for every  month and day throughout the year, and to them they devoted their  prayers. New Year's Day was a high day with them, and they had a great  many lucky and unlucky days.    The Persians hold that at the last judgment every man must pass along  a bridge no wider than a razor's edge; that the unbelievers and the  wicked will certainly in their passage fall into hell, there to be for  ever and ever tormented; but that the faithful shall be so guided and  supported that they shall pass the bridge swifter than a bird can fly  through the air, and enter into paradise, and seat themselves on the  banks of the river of delight, which, they say, is shaded by a tree  of such immense size, that if a man were to ride forty thousand years,  he would not pass the extent of one of its leaves. In Persia it was a  common belief that there were many prophets living between the days of  Adam and Mohammed, who were created before the world was made. Their  prophets, according to history, were possessed of the power of working  miracles; and charms and amulets were common in the country.    Pilgrims who went to Mecca invariably kissed a black stone, regarding  which there is a curious legend: Abraham, we are informed, tied his  camel to this stone when he went to sacrifice Ishmael, for the  Mohammedans represent Hagar as Abraham's lawful wife, and Ishmael his  heir. There is another tradition, that when Abraham was about to build  the Kaaba, held in great veneration, the stones marched thither of  themselves ready hewn and polished, and that the black stone, being  left out when the building was completed, demanded of Abraham why it  had not been used in the sacred structure. The prophet told the stone  not to be disappointed, for he would cause it to be more honoured than  any stone in the building, by commanding all the faithful to kiss it  as they went in procession. The faithful people were wont to meet at  the place which they supposed was Adam and Eve's trysting place after  the expulsion, for it is related in one of their legends that the  first man and woman wandered about the world, separately, hundreds of  years after the Fall.    The Persians were extremely addicted to the study and practice of the  black art and all magical incantations, supposing that by such  mysterious operations they could influence the elements and all the  products of nature. When any one was suspected to have died an  unnatural death, the surviving relatives consulted spirits, with the  view of discovering the cause of it. Sometimes the relatives alleged  that a spell had been cast on the spirits consulted, which prevented  their giving answers to interrogatories. In that case, magicians were  employed to remove the fascination. A suspected murderer was submitted  to a severe ordeal:--A particular liquid was poured upon the arm or  thigh of the unfortunate person; but before the fluid was used it was  boiled, while the supposed criminal's name was repeatedly mentioned.  The moment the liquid began to boil, they commenced to address their  imaginary spirits in the following terms: \"Is the party on whom I pour  this water guilty or not? If he is, may it scald him and shrivel up  his skin.\" If the application of the boiling liquid did not injure the  suspected person he was declared innocent, but if it burned him he was  pronounced guilty. People anxious to know the result of approaching  warlike engagements put a vessel full of water, mixed with particular  ingredients, over a fire. As soon as the water commenced to boil they  performed magical incantations, which, as they imagined, irresistibly  attracted the titular genius of their enemies, and obliged the spirit  or god to plunge himself into it. In this painful situation they  confined him for a considerable time. When he had endured sufficient  penance to humble him, he was questioned relative to the success of  the war. The information sought was delivered, as the people thought,  through the appearance of the scum on the water. By turning a red-hot  pot upside down, attended with magical incantations, they imagined the  courage of their soldiers exposed to its heat could be raised.    Canaanites, Syrians, and Arabians were all superstitious, and given to  idolatry. These people had various idols, regarding which there are  strange fables. An idol worshipped by the Philistines and Syrians,  called Derceto, has an interesting history. Near Askelon there was a  deep lake, abounding with fish. Not far from the lake stood the temple  of this famous goddess, the mother of Semiramis, who had the face of a  woman, and the rest of her body resembling part of a fish, for which  the Syrians assigned the following reason:--Venus having conceived a  hatred against Derceto, caused her to fall in love with a young  Syrian, whom she subsequently murdered, and then threw herself into  the lake, where she was transformed into the shape of a fish with a  woman's face; for which reason the Syrians did not eat any fish, but  worshipped them as gods. There is a legend of Abraham, before he left  Ur of the Chaldeans, which exhibits the contempt he had of idols. It  is said he took an opportunity of breaking in pieces all the idols he  could reach, except Baal, and that he suspended about the neck of this  idol the axe with which he had performed the destruction. The people  coming to see what had been done, supposed that Baal was the author of  the mischief. Some say that Abraham accomplished the exploit in his  father's shop during his absence, and that Terah, returning home,  inquired how the work of destruction had taken place. Abraham told him  that the idols had quarrelled about an offering of flour that an old  woman had brought them, and that Baal had proved the strongest, and  broke all the rest to pieces.    The Arabians, Ishmael's offspring, were equally guilty of idolatry. So  far did they carry this sin, that they actually worshipped idols under  the shape of Egyptian thorns. In early times the thorns were adored in  the open fields, but subsequently altars and temples were erected for  their worship. The Arabians worshipped Assaf under the shape of a  calf; and they had a goddess named Beltha, supposed to be the Venus of  the Greeks. The Sabeans were the principal worshippers of this  goddess; and such was their devotion to her, that they regularly  presented to her a portion of their plunder.    The religion of the Carthaginians and Tyrians was horrid and  barbarous. Nothing of moment was undertaken without consulting the  gods, which was done in various ridiculous ways. Hercules was the god  in whom the people placed most confidence. He was invoked before they  went on any important expedition; and when their armies were  victorious, sacrifices were offered to him. One of the chief deities  that they worshipped was Urania, or the moon, to whom they appealed  when overtaken by calamities, such as drought, excessive rain,  destructive hail, thunder, and dangerous storms. Urania was the queen  of heaven mentioned in the Scriptures, to whom even the Jewish women  offered cakes, etc. Carthaginians, in worshipping Saturn, offered up  human sacrifices to him. Even princes and other great men were wont,  in times of distress, to sacrifice their most beloved children to this  deity. People who had not any children of their own, purchased infants  that they might offer them as victims to this idol, with the view of  inducing him to fulfil their desires. Diodorus relates that when  Agathocles was going to besiege Carthage, the people imputed all their  misfortunes to the anger of Saturn, because, that instead of offering  up to him children nobly born, he had been fraudulently put off with  the offspring of slaves and foreigners. To atone for past  shortcomings, two hundred children of the best families in Carthage  were sacrificed, and further, to obtain the god's favour, three  hundred adult citizens immolated themselves.    Nimrod, the great-grandson of Noah, was an idolator, as were also his  descendants. Nineveh was the seat of his empire. As the sun and moon  became early objects of worship among the Assyrians, so in later days  they adored the fire as their substitute,--a form of worship that was  common among the ancients in many lands. The Assyrians published  abroad that the gods of other nations could not stand before their  fire-gods. A competition took place. A vast number of idols were  brought from foreign nations, but as they were composed of wood, the  god Ur (or fire) consumed them. After many contests, an Egyptian  priest discovered a plan of destroying the reputation of this idol,  which had become the terror of alien people. He caused the hollow  figure of an image to be made of perforated earth, with the holes  stuffed with wax, and the large internal cavity filled with water. He  then challenged the god Ur to oppose his god Canopus,--a challenge  which was accepted by the Chaldean priests. No sooner did the heat  that was expected to devour the Egyptian idol begin to take effect,  than, the wax being melted, the water gushed out and extinguished the  fire. Before the Assyrian empire was joined to that of Babylon,  Nisroch was the god worshipped in Nineveh, and it was in the temple of  this idol that the great Sennacherib was murdered. This idol was in  the shape of a bird--a dove or an eagle--made, if we can believe the  Jewish rabbis, from a plank of Noah's ark. The people repented at the  preaching of Jonah, but it was not long before they relapsed into  their former"]]]
