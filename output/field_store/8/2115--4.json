The principles by which each are attained are so contrary to  each other, that they seem, in my opinion, incompatible, and as  impossible to exist together, as to unite in the mind at the same time  the most sublime ideas and the lowest sensuality.    The subjects of the Venetian painters are mostly such as give them an  opportunity of introducing a great number of figures, such as feasts,  marriages, and processions, public martyrdoms, or miracles.  I can easily  conceive that Paul Veronese, if he were asked, would say that no subject  was proper for an historical picture but such as admitted at least forty  figures; for in a less number, he would assert, there could be no  opportunity of the painter's showing his art in composition, his  dexterity of managing and disposing the masses of light, and groups of  figures, and of introducing a variety of Eastern dresses and characters  in their rich stuffs.    But the thing is very different with a pupil of the greater schools.  Annibale Caracci thought twelve figures sufficient for any story: he  conceived that more would contribute to no end but to fill space; that  they would, be but cold spectators of the general action, or, to use his  own expression, that they would be figures to be let.  Besides, it is  impossible for a picture composed of so many parts to have that effect,  so indispensably necessary to grandeur, of one complete whole.  However  contradictory it may be in geometry, it is true in taste, that many  little things will not make a great one.  The sublime impresses the mind  at once with one great idea; it is a single blow: the elegant indeed may  be produced by a repetition, by an accumulation of many minute  circumstances.    However great the difference is between the composition of the Venetian  and the rest of the Italian schools, there is full as great a disparity  in the effect of their pictures as produced by colours.  And though in  this respect the Venetians must be allowed extraordinary skill, yet even  that skill, as they have employed it, will but ill correspond with the  great style.  Their colouring is not only too brilliant, but, I will  venture to say, too harmonious to produce that solidity, steadiness, and  simplicity of effect which heroic subjects require, and which simple or  grave colours only can give to a work.  That they are to be cautiously  studied by those who are ambitious of treading the great walk of history  is confirmed, if it wants confirmation, by the greatest of all  authorities, Michael Angelo.  This wonderful man, after having seen a  picture by Titian, told Vasari, who accompanied him, \"that he liked much  his colouring and manner; but then he added, that it was a pity the  Venetian painters did not learn to draw correctly in their early youth,  and adopt a better manner of study.\"    By this it appears that the principal attention of the Venetian painters,  in the opinion of Michael Angelo, seemed to be engrossed by the study of  colours, to the neglect of the ideal beauty of form, or propriety of  expression.  But if general censure was given to that school from the  sight of a picture of Titian, how much more heavily, and more justly,  would the censure fall on Paulo Veronese, or more especially on Tintoret?  And here I cannot avoid citing Vasari's opinion of the style and manner  of Tintoret.  \"Of all the extraordinary geniuses,\" says he, \"that have  ever practised the art of painting, for wild, capricious, extravagant,  and fantastical inventions, for furious impetuosity and boldness in the  execution of his work, there is none like Tintoret; his strange whims are  even beyond extravagance; and his works seem to be produced rather by  chance than in consequence of any previous design, as if he wanted to  convince the world that, the art was a trifle, and of the most easy  attainment.\"    For my own part, when I speak of the Venetian painters, I wish to be  understood to mean Paulo Veronese and Tintoret, to the exclusion of  Titian; for though his style is not so pure as that of many other of the  Italian schools, yet there is a sort of senatorial dignity about him,  which, however awkward in his imitators, seems to become him exceedingly.  His portraits alone, from the nobleness and simplicity of character which  he always gave them, will entitle him to the greatest respect, as he  undoubtedly stands in the first rank in this branch of the art.    It is not with Titian, but with the seducing qualities of the two former,  that I could wish to caution you, against being too much captivated.  These are the persons who may be said to have exhausted all the powers of  florid eloquence, to debauch the young and unexperienced, and have,  without doubt, been the cause of turning off the attention of the  connoisseur and of the patron of art, as well as that of the painter,  from those higher excellences of which the art is capable, and which  ought to be required in every considerable production.  By them, and  their imitators, a style merely ornamental has been disseminated  throughout all Europe.  Rubens carried it to Flanders, Voet to France,  and Luca Giordano to Spain and Naples.    The Venetian is indeed the most splendid of the schools of elegance; and  it is not without reason that the best performances in this lower school  are valued higher than the second-rate performances of those above them;  for every picture has value when it has a decided character, and is  excellent in its kind.  But the student must take care not to be so much  dazzled with this splendour as to be tempted to imitate what must  ultimately lead from perfection.  Poussin, whose eye was always steadily  fixed on the sublime, has been often heard to say, \"That a particular  attention to colouring was an obstacle to the student in his progress to  the great end and design of the art; and that he who attaches himself to  this principal end will acquire by practice a reasonably good method of  colouring.\"    Though it be allowed that elaborate harmony of colouring, a brilliancy of  tints, a soft and gradual transition from one to another, present to the  eye what an harmonious concert of music does to the ear, it must be  remembered that painting is not merely a gratification of the sight.  Such  excellence, though properly cultivated where nothing higher than elegance  is intended, is weak and unworthy of regard, when the work aspires to  grandeur and sublimity.    The same reasons that have been urged why a mixture of the Venetian style  cannot improve the great style will hold good in regard to the Flemish  and Dutch schools.  Indeed, the Flemish school, of which Rubens is the  head, was formed upon that of the Venetian; like them, he took his  figures too much from the people before him.  But it must be allowed in  favour of the Venetians that he was more gross than they, and carried all  their mistaken methods to a far greater excess.  In the Venetian school  itself, where they all err from the same cause, there is a difference in  the effect.  The difference between Paulo and Bassano seems to be only  that one introduced Venetian gentlemen into his pictures, and the other  the boors of the district of Bassano, and called them patriarchs and  prophets.    The painters of the Dutch school have still more locality.  With them, a  history piece is properly a portrait of themselves; whether they describe  the inside or outside of their houses, we have their own people engaged  in their own peculiar occupations, working or drinking, playing or  fighting.  The circumstances that enter into a picture of this kind are  so far from giving a general view of human life that they exhibit all the  minute particularities of a nation differing in several respects from the  rest of mankind.  Yet, let them have their share of more humble praise.  The painters of this school are excellent in their own way; they are only  ridiculous when they attempt general history on their own narrow  principles, and debase great events by the meanness of their characters.    Some inferior dexterity, some extraordinary mechanical power, is  apparently that from which they seek distinction.  Thus, we see, that  school alone has the custom of representing candle-light, not as it  really appears to us by night, but red, as it would illuminate objects to  a spectator by day.  Such tricks, however pardonable in the little style,  where petty effects are the sole end, are inexcusable in the greater,  where the attention should never be drawn aside by trifles, but should be  entirely occupied by the subject itself.    The same local principles which characterise the Dutch school extend even  to their landscape painters; and Rubens himself, who has painted many  landscapes, has sometimes transgressed in this particular.  Their pieces  in this way are, I think, always a representation of an individual spot,  and each in its kind a very faithful but very confined portrait.    Claude Lorraine, on the contrary, was convinced that taking nature as he  found it seldom produced beauty.  His pictures are a composition of the  various draughts which he has previously made from various beautiful  scenes and prospects.  However, Rubens in some measure has made amends  for the deficiency with which he is charged; he has contrived to raise  and animate his otherwise uninteresting views, by introducing a rainbow,  storm, or some particular accidental effect of light.  That the practice  of Claude Lorraine, in respect to his choice, is to be adopted by  landscape painters, in opposition to that of the Flemish and Dutch  schools, there can be no doubt, as its truth is founded upon the same  principle as that by which the historical painter acquires perfect form.  But whether landscape painting has a right to aspire so far as to reject  what the painters call accidents of nature is not easy to determine.  It  is certain"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21781"],[0,"Text Book of Biology, Part 1: Vertebrata (#10)"],[1,"differs from the pectoral in most land  vertebrata in being articulated with the vertebral column. This  difference does not exist in fishes. It consist in the rabbit of four  bones; the ilium (i.), the ischium (is.), the pubis (pb.), and the small  cotyloid bone-- the first two and the latter one meeting in the  acetabular fossa (ac.) in which the head of the femur works. The  pubes and ischia are fused along the mid-ventral line. Many  morphologists regard, the ilium as equivalent to, that is, strictly  corresponding in its relation, to the scapula, the pubis to the  cartilaginous substratum of the clavicle, and the ischium to the  coracoid.      Section 85. These bones will be studied at the greatest advantage  when dissected out from a boiled rabbit. Prepared and wired  skeletons, disarticulated skeletons, plates of figures, and written  descriptions are in succession more tedious and less satisfactory  ways to a real comprehension, of this matter. This chapter directs the  student's attention to the most important points in the study of the  skeleton, but it is in no way intended to mitigate the necessity of  practical work. It is a guide simply.      Section 86. The mammalian skull will be better understood after the  study of that of some lower vertebrate. We shall describe its main  features now, but their meaning will be much clearer after the lower  type is read. Our figures are of Canis. In section (Figure VI., Sheet 6),  we perceive a brain case (cranium) opening behind by a large  aperture, the foramen magnum (F.M.). In front of this is an extensive  passage, the nasal passage (E.N. to P.N.) which is divided from the  mouth by a bony floor, the palate, and which opens into the pharynx  behind at the posterior nares (P.N.) and to the exterior by the anterior  or external nares (E.N.). It is divided into right and left passages by a  middle partition, the nasal septum. Outside the skull, on its wings, is  a flask-like bone, the bulla tympani (b. in Figures 2 and 3), protecting  the middle ear, and from above this there passes an arch, the cheek  bone (ju. in Figures 1, 2, and 3), to the upper jaw, forming in front the  bony lower protection of the cavity containing the eye, the orbit. The  cheek arch, nasal passage, and jaws, form collectively the \"facial  apparatus,\" as distinguished from the cranium, and the whole skull is  sometimes referred to as, the \"cranio-facial apparatus.\" Two  eminences for articulation with the atlas vertebra, the condyles (c.), lie  one on each side of the lower boundary of the foramen magnum.      Section 87. The floor of the cranium consists of a series of cartilage  bones, the basi-occipital (b.o.), basi-sphenoid (b.sp.), pre-sphenoid  (p.sp.), and in front, the ethmoid (eth.), which sends down a median  plate, not shown, in the figure, to form the nasal septum between right  and left nasal passages. Like extended wings on either side of the  basi-occipital are the ex-occipital (e.o.) (the bone is marked  in Figure 4, but the letters are a little obscured by shading).  Similarly the ali-sphenoids (a.s.), are wings to the basi-, and the  orbito-sphenoids (o.s.), to the pre-sphenoid bone (p.sp.). Between the  ex-occipital and ali-sphenoid there is wedged in a bone, the periotic  (p.o.) containing the internal ear (Section 115). Above the foramen  magnum the median supra-occipital bone completes what is called  the occipital arch. A pair of parietals (pa.) come above the  ali-sphenoids, and a pair of frontals (f.) above the orbito-sphenoids. At  the side the brain case is still incomplete, and here the aquamosal  (sq.) enters into its wall. In the external view (Figure 3) the bulla hides  the periotic bone from without. The student should examine all four  figures for these bones before proceeding.      Section 88. The outer edge of the upper jaw and the cheek arch are  made up of three paired bones. First comes the premaxilla (p.m.)  (not p.m.1 or p.m.4), containing in the dog, the three incisors of either  side. Then comes the maxilla, bearing the rest of the teeth.* The jugal  or malar (ju.) reaches over from the maxilla to meet a zygomatic  process (= connecting outgrowth) (z.p.) of the squamosal bone.    * In the dog a sabre-like canine (c.), four premolars (p.m.1 and  p.m.4) and two molars (m.1 and m.2).      Section 89. In the under view of the skull (Figure 2) it will be seen that  the maxilla sends in a plate to form the front part of the hard palate.  Behind, the hard palate is completed by the pair of palatine bones  (pal.), which conceal much of the pre- and orbito-sphenoid in the  ventral view, and which run back as ridges to terminate in two small  angular bones, the pterygoids (pt.) which we shall find represent much  more important structures in the lower vertebrata.      Section 90. The pre-maxillae and maxillae bound the sides of the  nasal passage, and it is completed above by a pair of splints, the  nasals. Along the floor of the nasal passage, on the middle line, lies a  splint of bone formed by the coalescence of two halves. It embraces  in a V-like groove the mesethmoid (nasal septum) above, and lies on  the palate.       {Lines from First Edition only.}     -Its position is indicated by a heavy black line in 4, and it is     called, the vomer bone (vo.).-       {Lines from Second Edition only.}     [In the frog it is represented by two laterally situated bones.     This is the vomer bone (vo.).]    The nasal passages are partially blocked by foliated bony outgrowths,  from the inner aspect of their walls, which in life are covered with  mucous membrane, and increase the surface sensitive to smell. The  ethmoid ends in the ethmo-turbinal (e.t.); the nasal, the naso-turbinal  (n.t.); and the maxilla, the maxillo-turbinal (m.t.). In the anterior  corner of the orbit there is a bone, the lachrymal (lc. Figure 1), which  is hidden by the maxilla in the side view of the skull.      Section 91. The lower jaw (mandible) is one continuous bone in the  mammal. Three incisors bite against the three of the upper jaw. Then  comes a canine, four premolars, and three molars, the first of which is  blade-like (sectorial tooth), and bites against the similar sectorial  tooth (last premolar) of the upper jaw. The third molar is small. The  arrangement of tooth is indicated in the following dental formula:--  I. 3.3/3.3, C. 1.1/1.1, P.M. 4.4/4.4, M. 2.2/3.3      Section 92. Attached just behind the bulla above, and passing round  on either side of the throat to meet at the base of the tongue, is the  hyoid apparatus (Figure 6). The stylohyal (s.h.), epihyal (e.h.), and  ceratohyal (c.h.) form the anterior cornu of the hyoid. The body of the  hyoid (b.h.) forms a basis for the tongue. The posterior coruna (t.h.) of  the hyoid are also called the thyrohyals.      Section 93. The following table presents these bones in something  like their relative positions. A closer approximation to the state of the  case will be reached if the student will imagine the maxilla raised up  so as to overlie and hide the palatine and presphenoid, the  squamosal similarly overlying the periotic bone, and the jugal reaching  between them. Membrane bones are distinguished by capital letters.       -Cranium_          -Nasal_ (paired), Ethmoid Bone (median), -Vomer_        -Frontal_ (paired), -Lachrymal_ (paired), Orbito-sphenoid (paired),        Pre-sphenoid (median), Eye        -Parietal_ (Paired), Ali-sphenoid (paired), Basi-sphenoid (median)*,        Periotic Bone (paired)        -Bulla_ (paired)        Supra-occipital (median), Ex-occipital (paired), Basi-occipital           (median)       -Upper Jaw_          -Pre-Maxilla_ (paired)        Palatine (paired)        Pterygoid (paired)       -Lower Jaw_          -Maxilla_ (paired)        -Jugal_ (paired)        -Squamosal_ (paired)       *In this table the small bones of the ear are simply indicated by an     asterisk.      Section 94. Hidden by the bulla, and just external to the periotic bone,  are the auditory ossicles, the incus, malleus, os orbiculare,  and stapes. These will be more explicitly treated when we discuss the  ear.      Section 95. When we come to the study of the nerves, we shall  revert to the skull, and treat of its perforations. The student should not  fail, before proceeding, to copy and recopy our figures, and to make  himself quite familiar with them, and he should also obtain and handle  an actual skull. For all practical purposes the skull of a  sheep or cat will be almost as useful as that of the dog.        6. _Muscle and Nerve_    Section 96. We have, in the skeleton, a complicated apparatus of  parts hinged and movable upon one another; the agent moving these  parts is the same agent that we find in the heart walls propelling the  blood through the circulation, in the alimentary canal squeezing the  food along its course, and universally in the body where motion  occurs, except in the case of the creeping phagocytes, and the ciliary  waving of ciliated epithelium. This agent is muscle. We have, in  muscular tissue, a very wide departure from the structure of the  primordial cell; to use a common biological expression, a very great  amount of modification (= differentiation). Sheet 7 represents the  simpler kind of muscular tissue, unstriated muscle, in which the  cell character is still fairly obvious. The cells are fusiform  (spindle-shaped), have a distinct nucleus and faint longitudinal  striations (striations along their length), but no transverse  striations.      Section 97. In striated muscle extensive modifications mask the cell  character. Under a 1/4 inch objective, transverse striations of the  fibres are also distinctly visible, and under a much higher power we  discern in a fibre (Sheet 7) transverse columns of rod-like sarcous  elements (s.e.), the columns separated by lines of dots, the  membranes of Krause (k.m.), and nuclei (n.), flattened and  separated into portions, and lying, in"]]]
