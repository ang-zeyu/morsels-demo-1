[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21035"],[0,"The Adventures of a Three-Guinea Watch (#10)"],[1,"m, where  are blacks and reds; I'm just in the humour for a rubber, aren't you?\"    The host produced from a locked desk a dirty and much-worn pack of  cards, and the party sat down to play.    They played for penny points, and as Gus and Margetson were partners, it  is hardly necessary to say that Drift and his ill-looking friend lost  every game.    Before this amiable and congenial quartet separated, Gus had referred  again to the scheme of getting Charlie to Gurley races, and got Drift to  promise he would secure his victim next day.    Next day, accordingly, as Charlie was in the midst of a desperate game  of fives with his friend Jim, a small boy came to him and said that Tom  Drift wanted him.    \"What for?\" demanded Charlie, who, since his talk with the elder  Halliday, had felt somewhat \"shy\" about Tom.    \"I don't know,\" said the boy.    \"Your turn, Charlie,\" called out Jim from the end of the court.    Charlie took his turn while he was revolving on his answer to this  mysterious summons.    \"What does that child want?\" inquired Jim, with all the loftiness of a  second-form boy speaking of a first.    \"He says Tom Drift wants me.\"    \"Whew!\" whistled Jim, who of course knew the whole mystery of the affair  between his chum and Tom; \"tell him to go to Jericho!  Look out for  yourself!\"    And so saying, he took his turn with the ball.    \"That wouldn't do,\" said Charlie; \"I don't want to rile him.\"    \"_I'd_ like to have a chance,\" retorted the implacable Jim.  \"Well,  then, tell him you can't come.  Here, young un, tell Tom Drift Charlie  can't come.  Do you hear?  Cut your sticks!\"    But Charlie called the messenger back.  \"I _could_, go if I wanted, Jim.  Better tell him I'd rather not come.  Say that, youngster--I'd rather  not.\"    So off the youngster ran, and Charlie and Jim finished their game.  Of  coarse, the youthful messenger gave Tom a full, true, and particular  account of this conversation in all its details, which rendered that  young gentleman rather less eager than ever for his enterprise.  However, he had the fear of Gus before his eyes, and strolled out into  the playground on the chance of coming across Charlie.    And he did come across him, arm-in-arm with the faithful Jim.  Tom  worked his face into the ghastly similitude of a friendly smile as he  approached, and said, in as genial a voice as he could pretend, \"I'm  glad I met you, Newcome, because I want to speak to you, if you don't  mind taking a turn round the playground.\"    Charlie, of course, was astonished; he had expected at the very least to  be kicked over the wall when he saw Tom approach, and he was utterly at  a loss to understand this not unfriendly greeting.  Innocent boy! it  never occurred to him the demonstration could be anything but real.  Jim  would have been a tougher subject to deal with.  Indeed, as he let go  Charlie's arm, and saw him walk off with Tom, he muttered to himself,  not caring particularly whether the latter heard him or not.    \"Gammon! that's what it is.\"    Charlie had not long to wait before his companion began the  conversation.    \"I suppose you wonder why I want you, Newcome?\" said he.  \"The fact is,  I've been thinking I wasn't altogether right in being down on you the  other day about lending me that watch, especially as you were a new boy;  and I'm sorry if I hurt you.\"    Charlie sprung towards him and caught his arm.    \"Oh, Tom Drift, don't say that, please!  It was my fault--all my fault,  and I have been so sorry ever since.  And you will be friends now, won't  you?  I do so want to be, because I promised your mother--\"    Tom gave a quick gesture of impatience, which, if Charlie had  understood, he would have known how near receiving a kick he was at that  moment.    Tom, however, restrained himself, and said,--    \"Oh, yes, for her sake I'd like to be friends, of course, and I hope  you'll forget all about that wretched quarrel.\"    \"Indeed I will,\" cried Charlie; \"and don't let us say any more about it.  I am ever so much happier now, and it was so good of you to come to me  and make it up.\"    \"Well,\" said Tom loftily, \"you know it's no use for two fellows to be at  loggerheads when it can be helped, and I dare say we shall get on all  the better now.  How are you going on in the second?\"    Whereupon Charlie launched into a lengthy and animated account of his  experiences, to which Tom pretended to listen, but scarcely heard a  word.    \"So you are fond of fishing?\" he said, casually, after the boy had  mentioned something on that subject.    \"Ain't I, though?\" cried Charlie, now quite happy, and his old self  again.  \"I say, Tom Drift, would you like to see the new lance-wood top  I've got to my rod?  It's a stunner, I can tell you.  I'll lend it you,  you know, any time you like.\"    \"Have you caught much since you were here!\" asked Tom, anxious to get  this hateful business over.    \"No.  You know the brook here isn't a good one for fish, and I don't  know anywhere else near.\"    \"Well, I'll tell you what,\" said Tom, as if the idea had then for the  first time occurred to him.  \"Suppose we go off for a regular good day  on Saturday?  It's a holiday, you know, and we could go and try up the  Sharle, near Gurley.  There's lots of trout there, and we are certain to  have a good day.\"    \"How jolly!\" exclaimed Charlie.  \"It would be grand.  But I say, Tom  Drift, are you sure you wouldn't mind coming?  It wouldn't be a bother  to you, would it?\"    \"Not a bit.  I like a good day's fishing.  But, I say, young un, you'd  better not say anything about it to any one, or we shall have a swarm of  fellows come too, and that will spoil all the sport.\"    \"All right,\" said Charlie.  \"I say what a day we shall have!  I'll bring  my watch and knife, you know, and some grub, and we can picnic there,  eh?\"    \"That'll be splendid.  Well, I must go in now, so good-bye, Newcome, and  shake hands.\"    What a grip was that! on one side all trust and fervour, and on the  other all fraud and malice!    Tom Drift was not yet utterly bad.  Would that he had allowed his  conscience to speak and his better self prevail!  Half a dozen times in  the course of his walk from the playground to the school he repented of  the wicked part he was playing in the scheme to injure Charlie.  But  half a dozen times the thought of Gus and his taunts, and the  recollection of his own bruised forehead came to drive out all passing  sentiments of pity or remorse.    Charlie rejoined his chum with a beaming face.    \"Well,\" asked Jim, \"what has he been saying to humbug you this time?\"    \"Nothing very particular; and I won't let you call him a humbug.  I say,  Jim, old boy, he's made it up at last, and we're friends, Tom Drift and  I!  Hurrah!  I was never so glad, isn't it jolly?\"    Jim by no means shared his friend's enthusiasm.  Like his elder brother,  he instinctively disliked Tom Drift, without exactly being able to give  a reason.    His reserve, however, had no effect on Charlie's high spirits.  At last  the wish of his heart had been gained!  No longer did he walk with the  burden of a broken promise weighting his neck; no longer did the  consciousness of having an enemy oppress him.    \"Simpleton!\" many of my readers will exclaim.  Perhaps he was; but even  if you laugh at him, I think you will hardly despise him for his simple-  mindedness, for who would not rather be such a one than the tempter, Tom  Drift?    All that week he was jubilant.  Boys looked round in astonishment at the  shrillness of his whistle and the ring of his laughter.  His corner of  the class room was a simple Babel, and the number of apples he bestowed  in charity was prodigious.    Something, every one could see, had happened to make him happier than  ever.  Few knew what that something was, and fewer still knew what it  meant.    \"What are you up to to-morrow?\" asked the elder Halliday of his fag on  the Friday evening.    \"Fishing,\" briskly replied the boy.    \"You're for ever fishing,\" said Joe.  \"I suppose that young brother of  mine is going with you?\"    \"No; Jim's going to play in the match against the Badgers.\"    The \"Badgers,\" let me explain, was the name of a scratch cricket eleven  made up of boys in the first, second and third forms.    \"Are you going alone, then?\"    Charlie felt uncomfortable as he answered,--    \"No.\"    \"Whom are you going with?\" pursued the inquiring Joe.    \"A fellow in the fifth who asked me to come.\"    \"What's his name?\"    Charlie had no help for it now.    \"Tom Drift,\" he faltered.    \"Tom Drift!  I thought you and he were at loggerheads.\"    \"Oh, don't you know we've made it up?  He was awfully kind about it, and  said he was sorry, when it was really my fault, and we shook hands, and  to-morrow we are going to fish in a place he knows where there's no end  of trout.\"    \"Where's that?\"    \"He didn't want me to tell, for fear everybody should come and spoil the  sport; but I suppose I can tell you, though; it's up the Sharle, near  Gurley.\"    \"Humph!  I've fished there before now.  Not such a wonderful lot of  fish, either.\"    \"I suppose you won't be there to-morrow?\" asked Charlie nervously,  afraid of losing the confidence of Tom Drift by attracting strangers to  his waters.    \"Not if I know it,\" replied Joe.  \"I say, youngster, I thought you had  given up the notion of making up to that fellow?\"    \"I didn't make up to him, only I can't be sorry to be friends with  him--\"    \"Well, I hope you won't be sorry now you've done it.  Take care what  you're about, that's all.\"    Charlie was again perplexed to understand why Halliday seemed to have  such a dislike to poor Tom.    Just as he was going off to bed Joe stopped him and asked,--    \"By the way, shall you be using your watch to-morrow?\"    \"Well, I promised I'd take it, to see how the time went; but I dare say  we could do without it, and I would like to lend it to you, Halliday.\"    \"Not a bit of it,\" replied the other."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21036"],[0,"My Friend Smith: A Story of School and City Life (#10)"],[1,"e!\"    So it was.  It shook as we stood upon it.    \"We might be able to move it,\" said Jack.    So we knelt down and with all our might tugged away at the stone that  divided us from our water-pipe.  It was obstinate at first, but by dint  of perseverance it yielded to pressure at last, and we were able  triumphantly to lift it from its place.    It was easy enough now reaching the pipe.  But here a new peril arose.  Sliding down water-pipes is an acquired art, and not nearly as easy as  it seems.  Jack, who volunteered to make the first descent, looked a  little blue as he found the pipe was so close to the wall that he  couldn't get his hands round, much less his feet.    \"You'll have to grip it hard with your ankles and elbows,\" he said,  beginning to slide down an inch or two; \"and go slow, whatever you do.\"    It was nervous work watching him, and still more nervous work when at  length I braced myself up to the effort and proceeded to embrace the  slender pipe.  How I ever managed to get to the bottom I can't say.  I  remember reflecting about half way down that this would be good daily  exercise for the Henniker, and the mere thought of her almost sent me  headlong to the bottom.    At last, however, I stood safe beside my chum on the gravel walk.    \"Now!\" said he.    \"Now,\" I replied, \"where shall we go?\"    \"London, I think,\" said he, solemnly as ever, \"All right--how many  miles?\"    \"Eighty or ninety, I fancy--but where's your coat?\"    \"In the dormitory.  I was too much flurried to put it on.\"    \"Never mind, we can use mine turn about.  But I wish we'd got boots  instead of slippers.\"    \"So do I,\" replied I, who even as I stood felt the sharp gravel cutting  my feet; \"ninety miles in slippers will be rather rough.\"    \"Never mind,\" said Jack, \"come on.\"    \"Come on,\" said I.    At that moment, to our dismay and misery, we heard a window above us  stealthily opened, close to the water-pipe, and looking up beheld the  Henniker's head and yellow-and-black body suddenly thrust out.    \"Batchelor and Smith--Mr Ladislaw,\" (here her voice rose to pretty  nearly a shriek)--\"Mr Ladislaw! come at once, please--Batchelor and  Smith, running away.  Mr Ladislaw, quick!  Batchelor and Smith!\"    We stood motionless, with no spirit left to fly, until the door was  opened, and Mr Ladislaw, Miss Henniker, and Mr Hashford, all three,  sallied out to capture us.    Among them we were dragged back, faint and exhausted, into Stonebridge  House, all thoughts of freedom, and London, effectually banished from  our heads, and still worse, with the bitter sense of disappointment  added to our other miseries.    Mr Hashford was set to watch us for the rest of the night in the empty  schoolroom.  And he had an easy task.  For even though he fell asleep  over it, we had no notion of returning to our old scheme.  Indeed, I was  shivering so, I had no notion of anything but the cold.  Jack made me  put on his coat, but it made very little difference.  The form I was on  actually shook with my shivering.  Mr Hashford, good soul that he was,  lent me his own waistcoat, and suggested that if we all three sat close  together--I in the middle--I might get warmer.  We tried it, and when at  six o'clock that same eventful morning the servant came to sweep the  room she found us all three huddled together--two of us asleep and one  in a fever.    I have only a dim recollection of what happened during the next week or  so.  I was during that time the most comfortable boy in all Stonebridge  House.  For the doctor came every day, ordered me all sorts of good  things, and insisted on a fire being kept in my room, and no lessons.  And if I wished to see any of my friends I might do so, and on no  account was I to be allowed to fret or be disturbed in mind.  I couldn't  help feeling half sorry for Miss Henniker being charged with all these  uncongenial tasks; but Stonebridge House depended a great deal on what  the doctor said of it, and so she had to obey his orders.    I took advantage of the permission to see my friends by requesting the  presence of Smith very frequently.  But as the Henniker generally  thought fit to sit in my room at the same time, I didn't get as much  good out of my chum as I might have done.  I heard he had had a very  smart flogging for his share of that eventful night's proceedings, and  that another was being saved up for me when I got well.    It was quite a melancholy day for me when the doctor pronounced me  convalescent, and said I might resume my ordinary duties.  It was  announced to me at my first appearance in school, that on account of my  delinquencies I was on the \"strict silence\" rule for the rest of the  term, that my bed was removed to the other dormitory, and that I was  absolutely forbidden to hold any further communication, either by word  or gesture, with my friend Smith.    Thus cheerfully ended my first term at Stonebridge House.        CHAPTER SIX.    HOW THINGS CAME TO A CRISIS AT STONEBRIDGE HOUSE.    A year passed, and found us at the end of it the same wretched,  spiritless boys as ever.  Stonebridge House had become no more  tolerable, the Henniker had grown no less terrible, and our fellow  \"backward and troublesome boys\" were just as unpleasant as they had  been.  No new boys had come to give us a variety, and no old boys had  left.  Except for the one fact that we were all of us a year older,  everything was precisely the same as it had been at the time of the  adventure related in my last chapter.  But that one year makes a good  deal of difference.  When Smith and I slid down the water-pipe a year  ago we were comparatively new friends, now we had grown to love one  another like brothers.  When the Henniker, on the same occasion, put an  end to our scheme of escape, we had endured her persecutions but three  months, now we had endured them for fifteen.  A great deal of secret  working may go on in a fellow's mind during a year, and in that way the  interval _had_ wrought a change, for we were a good deal more to one  another, Smith and I, and a good deal more desperate at our hard lot,  both of us, than we had been a year ago.    It had been a miserable time.  My holidays alone with my uncle had been  almost as cheerless as my schooldays at Stonebridge House with Miss  Henniker.  If it hadn't been for Smith I do believe I should have lost  every vestige of spirit.  But happily he gave me no chance of falling  into that condition.  He seemed always on the verge of some explosion.  Now it was against Hawkesbury, now against the Henniker, now against Mr  Ladislaw, and now against the whole world generally, myself included.  I  had a busy time of it holding him in.    He still showed aversion to Hawkesbury, although I differed from him on  this point, and insisted that Hawkesbury was not such a bad fellow.  Luckily, however, no outbreak happened.  How could it, when Hawkesbury  was always so amiable and forgiving and friendly?  It was a wonder to me  how Jack _would_ persist in disliking this fellow.  Sometimes I used to  be quite ashamed to see the scornful way in which he repulsed his  favours and offers of friendship.  On the whole I rather liked  Hawkesbury.    The summer term was again drawing to a close, and for fear, I suppose,  lest the fact should convey any idea of pleasure to our minds, the  Henniker was down on us more than ever.  The cane was in constant  requisition, and Mr Ladislaw was always being summoned up to administer  chastisement.    Even Hawkesbury, who generally managed to escape reproach, came in for  her persecution now and then.    One day, I remember, we were all in class, and she for some reason  quitted the room, leaving Mr Hashford in charge.    Now, no one minded Mr Hashford very much.  He was a good-natured  fellow, who did his best to please both us and his mistress; but he was  \"Henpecked,\" we could see, like all the rest of us, and we looked upon  him more as a big schoolfellow than as a master, and minded him  accordingly.  We therefore accepted the Henniker's departure as a signal  for leaving off work and seizing the opportunity to loosen our tongues  and look about us.  Hawkesbury happened to be sitting next to me.  He  put down his pen, and, leaning back against the desk behind him, yawned  and said, \"I say, Batchelor, I hope you and Smith haven't been  quarrelling?\"    \"Quarrelling!\" exclaimed I, astounded at the bare notion.  \"Why,  whatever puts that into your head?\"    \"Oh,\" said he, with his usual smile, \"only fancy.  But I'm glad it isn't  the case.\"    \"Of course it isn't,\" said I, warmly.    \"I haven't seen you talking to him so often lately; that's why,\" said  Hawkesbury; \"and it always seems a pity when good friends fall out.\"    I smiled and said, \"How can I talk to him, except on the sly, in this  place?  Never fear, Jack Smith and I know one another too well to fall  out.\"    \"Ah, he is a mysterious fellow, and he lets so few people into his  secrets.\"    \"Yes,\" said I, colouring a little.  \"He doesn't even let me into them.\"    Hawkesbury looked surprised.  \"Of course you know where he came from  first of all, and all that?\"    \"No, I don't,\" I said.    \"What, not know about-- But I'd better not talk about it.  It's not  honourable to talk about another boy's affairs.\"    \"Hawkesbury,\" said Mr Hashford at this moment, \"don't talk.\"    This was quite a remarkable utterance for the meek and mild Mr Hashford  to make in the Henniker's absence, and we all started and looked up in a  concerned way, as if he must be unwell.    But no, he seemed all right, and having said what he had to say, went on  with his work.    Hawkesbury took no notice of the interruption, and went on.  \"And, on  the whole, I think it would be kinder not to say anything about it, as  he has kept it a secret himself.  You see--\"    \"Hawkesbury,\" again said Mr Hashford, \"you must not talk.\"    Hawkesbury smiled in a pitiful sort of way at Mr Hashford, and"]]]
