Whoever desires  to help others to a fair view of current events must try not only to be  impartial, but also to avoid expressing opinions when the grounds for  those opinions cannot be fully stated; and where controversy is raging  round the events to be described, no judgment passed on individual  actors could fail to be deemed partial by one set of partizans or by the  other. Feeling sure that the present problems will take some time to  solve, I have sought to write what those who desire to understand the  country may find useful even after the next few years have passed. And,  so far from wishing to champion any view or to throw any fresh logs on  the fire of controversy that has been blazing for the last few years, I  am convinced that the thing now most needed in the interests of South  Africa is to let controversies die out, to endeavour to forget the  causes of irritation, and to look at the actual facts of the case in a  purely practical spirit.    Altogether apart from its recent troubles, South Africa is an  interesting, and indeed fascinating subject of study. There are, of  course, some things which one cannot expect to find in it. There has not  yet been time to evolve institutions either novel or specially  instructive, nor to produce new types of character (save that of the  Transvaal Boer) or new forms of social life. There are no ancient  buildings, except a few prehistoric ruins; nor have any schools of  architecture or painting or literature been as yet developed. But  besides the aspects of nature, often weird and sometimes beautiful,  there are the savage races, whose usages and superstitions open a wide  field for research, and the phenomena of whose contact with the whites  raise some grave and gloomy problems. There are the relations of the two  European races--races which ought long ago to have been happily blended  into one, but which have been kept apart by a train of untoward events  and administrative errors. Few of the newer countries have had a more  peculiar or more chequered history; and this history needs to be studied  with a constant regard to the physical conditions that have moulded it.  Coming down to our own time, nowhere are the struggles of the past seen  to be more closely intertwined with the troubles of the present; nor  does even Irish history furnish a better illustration of the effect of  sentiment upon practical politics. Few events of recent times have  presented more dramatic situations, and raised more curious and  intricate issues of political and international morality, than those  which have lately been set before us by the discovery of the Transvaal  gold-fields and the rush of nineteenth-century miners and speculators  into a pastoral population which retains the ideas and habits of the  seventeenth-century. Still more fascinating are the problems of the  future. One can as yet do little more than guess at them; but the world  now moves so fast, and has grown so small, and sees nearly every part of  itself so closely bound by ties of commerce or politics to every other  part, that it is impossible to meditate on any great and new country  without seeking to interpret its tendencies by the experience of other  countries, and to conjecture the role it will be called on to play in  the world-drama of the centuries to come. I have sought, therefore, not  only to make South Africa real to those who do not know it, and to give  them the materials for understanding what passes there and following its  fortunes with intelligence, but also to convey an impression of the kind  of interest it awakens. It is still new: and one sees still in a fluid  state the substance that will soon crystallize into new forms. One  speculates on the result which these mingled forces, these ethnic habits  and historical traditions, and economic conditions, will work out. And  reflecting on all these things, one feels sure that a country with so  commanding a position, and which has compressed so much history into the  last eighty years of its life, will hold a conspicuous place in that  southern hemisphere which has in our own times entered into the  political and industrial life of the civilized world.          PART I    _NATURE_          CHAPTER I    PHYSICAL FEATURES      To understand the material resources and economic conditions of South  Africa, and, indeed, to understand the history of the country and the  political problems which it now presents, one must first know something  of its physical structure. The subject may seem dry, and those readers  who do not care for it may skip this chapter. But it need not be  uninteresting, and it is certainly not uninstructive. For myself, I can  say that not only South African history, but also the prospects of South  African industry and trade, were dark matters to me till I had got, by  travelling through the country, an idea of those natural features of the  southern part of the continent which have so largely governed the course  of events and have stamped themselves so deeply upon the habits of the  people. Some notion of these features I must now try to convey.  Fortunately, they are simple, for nature has worked in Africa, as in  America, upon larger and broader lines than she has done in Europe. The  reader will do well to keep a map beside him, and refer[3] constantly to  it, for descriptions without a map avail little.    Africa south of the Zambesi River consists, speaking broadly, of three  regions. There is a strip of lowland lying along the coast of the Indian  Ocean, all the way round from Cape Town, past Durban and Delagoa Bay and  Beira, till you reach the mouth of the Zambesi. On the south, between  Cape Town and Durban, this strip is often very narrow, for in many  places the hills come, as they do at Cape Town, right down to the sea.  But beyond Durban, as one follows the coast along to the north-east, the  level strip widens. At Delagoa Bay it is some fifteen or twenty miles  wide; at Beira it is sixty or eighty miles wide, so that the hills  behind cannot be seen from the coast; and farther north it is still  wider. This low strip is in many places wet and swampy, and, being  swampy, is from Durban northward malarious and unhealthful in the  highest degree. Its unhealthfulness is a factor of prime importance in  what may be called the general scheme of the country, and has had, as we  shall presently see, the most important historical consequences.    Behind the low coast strip rise the hills whose slopes constitute the  second region. They rise in most places rather gradually, and they  seldom (except in Manicaland, to be hereafter described) present  striking forms. The neighbourhood of Cape Town is almost the only place  where high mountains come close to the shore--the only place, therefore,  except the harbour of St. John's far to the east, where there is  anything that can be called grand coast scenery. As one travels inland  the hills become constantly higher, till at a distance of thirty or  forty miles from the sea they have reached an average height of from  3000 to 4000 feet, and sixty miles from 5000 to 6000 feet. These hills,  intersected by valleys which grow narrower and have steeper sides the  farther inland one goes, are the spurs or outer declivity of a long  range of mountains which runs all the way from Cape Town to the Zambesi  Valley, a distance of sixteen hundred miles, and is now usually called  by geographers (for it has really no general name) the Drakensberg or  Quathlamba Range. Their height varies from 3000 to 7000 feet, some of  the highest lying not far to the north-east of Cape Town. In one region,  however, several summits reach to 11,000 feet. This is Basutoland, the  country that lies at the corner where Cape Colony, Natal, and the Orange  Free State meet. It is a region remarkable in several respects, for its  scenery as well as for its history, and for the condition of the native  race that inhabits it, and I shall have to give some account of it in a  later chapter. These mountains of Basutoland are the loftiest in Africa  south of Kilimandjaro, and keep snow on their summits for several months  in the year.    Behind the Quathlamba Range the country spreads out to the north and  west in a vast tableland, sometimes flat, sometimes undulating,  sometimes intersected by ridges of rocky hills. This is the third  region. Its average height above the sea varies from 3000 to 5000 feet,  and the hills reach in places nearly 6000. Thus the Quathlamba Range may  be regarded as being really the edge of the tableland, and when in  travelling up from the coast one reaches the water-shed, or \"divide\" (an  American term which South Africans have adopted), one finds that on the  farther or northerly side there is very little descent. The peaks which  when seen from the slopes towards the coast looked high and steep are on  this inner side insignificant, because they rise so little above the  general level of the plateau. This plateau runs away inland to the west  and north-west, and occupies seven-eighths of the surface of South  Africa. It dips gently on the north to the valley of the Zambesi; but on  the west spreads out over the Kalahari Desert and the scarcely less arid  wastes of Damaraland, maintaining (except along the lower course of the  Orange River) an altitude of from 3000 to 4000 feet above the sea, until  within a comparatively short distance of the Atlantic Ocean.    The physical structure of the country is thus extremely simple. There is  only one considerable mountain-chain, with a vast table-land filling the  interior behind it, and a rough, hilly country lying between the  mountains and the low belt which borders on the Indian Ocean. Let the  reader suppose himself to be a traveller wishing to cross the continent  from east to west. Starting from a port, say Delagoa Bay or Beira, on  the Portuguese coast, the traveller will in a few hours, by either"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2233"],[0,"A Damsel in Distress (#10)"],[1,"the wheel removed his goggles, pulled out  a watch, and addressed the stout young man at his side.    \"Two hours and eighteen minutes from Hyde Park Corner, Boots. Not  so dusty, what?\"    His companion made no reply. He appeared to be plunged in thought.  He, too, removed his goggles, revealing a florid and gloomy face,  equipped, in addition to the usual features, with a small moustache  and an extra chin. He scowled forbiddingly at the charming scene  which the goggles had hidden from him.    Before him, a symmetrical mass of grey stone and green ivy, Belpher  Castle towered against a light blue sky. On either side rolling  park land spread as far as the eye could see, carpeted here and  there with violets, dotted with great oaks and ashes and Spanish  chestnuts, orderly, peaceful and English. Nearer, on his left, were  rose-gardens, in the centre of which, tilted at a sharp angle,  appeared the seat of a pair of corduroy trousers, whose wearer  seemed to be engaged in hunting for snails. Thrushes sang in the  green shrubberies; rooks cawed in the elms. Somewhere in the  distance sounded the tinkle of sheep bells and the lowing of cows.  It was, in fact, a scene which, lit by the evening sun of a perfect  spring day and fanned by a gentle westerly wind, should have  brought balm and soothing meditations to one who was the sole  heir to all this Paradise.    But Percy, Lord Belpher, remained uncomforted by the notable  co-operation of Man and Nature, and drew no solace from the  reflection that all these pleasant things would one day be his own.  His mind was occupied at the moment, to the exclusion of all other  thoughts, by the recollection of that painful scene in Bow Street  Police Court. The magistrate's remarks, which had been tactless and  unsympathetic, still echoed in his ears. And that infernal night in  Vine Street police station . . . The darkness . . . The hard bed. . .  The discordant vocalising of the drunk and disorderly in the  next cell. . . . Time might soften these memories, might lessen the  sharp agony of them; but nothing could remove them altogether.    Percy had been shaken to the core of his being. Physically, he was  still stiff and sore from the plank bed. Mentally, he was a  volcano. He had been marched up the Haymarket in the full sight of  all London by a bounder of a policeman. He had been talked to like  an erring child by a magistrate whom nothing could convince that he  had not been under the influence of alcohol at the moment of his  arrest. (The man had said things about his liver, kindly  be-warned-in-time-and-pull-up-before-it-is-too-late things, which  would have seemed to Percy indecently frank if spoken by his  medical adviser in the privacy of the sick chamber.) It is perhaps  not to be wondered at that Belpher Castle, for all its beauty of  scenery and architecture, should have left Lord Belpher a little  cold. He was seething with a fury which the conversation of Reggie  Byng had done nothing to allay in the course of the journey from  London. Reggie was the last person he would willingly have chosen  as a companion in his hour of darkness. Reggie was not soothing. He  would insist on addressing him by his old Eton nickname of Boots  which Percy detested. And all the way down he had been breaking out  at intervals into ribald comments on the recent unfortunate  occurrence which were very hard to bear.    He resumed this vein as they alighted and rang the bell.    \"This,\" said Reggie, \"is rather like a bit out of a melodrama.  Convict son totters up the steps of the old home and punches the  bell. What awaits him beyond? Forgiveness? Or the raspberry? True,  the white-haired butler who knew him as a child will sob on his  neck, but what of the old dad? How will dad take the blot of the  family escutcheon?\"    Lord Belpher's scowl deepened.    \"It's not a joking matter,\" he said coldly.    \"Great Heavens, I'm not joking. How could I have the heart to joke  at a moment like this, when the friend of my youth has suddenly  become a social leper?\"    \"I wish to goodness you would stop.\"    \"Do you think it is any pleasure to me to be seen about with a man  who is now known in criminal circles as Percy, the Piccadilly  Policeman-Puncher? I keep a brave face before the world, but  inwardly I burn with shame and agony and what not.\"    The great door of the castle swung open, revealing Keggs, the  butler. He was a man of reverend years, portly and dignified, with  a respectfully benevolent face that beamed gravely on the young  master and Mr. Byng, as if their coming had filled his cup of  pleasure. His light, slightly protruding eyes expressed reverential  good will. He gave just that touch of cosy humanity to the scene  which the hall with its half lights and massive furniture needed to  make it perfect to the returned wanderer. He seemed to be  intimating that this was a moment to which he had looked forward  long, and that from now on quiet happiness would reign supreme. It  is distressing to have to reveal the jarring fact that, in his  hours of privacy when off duty, this apparently ideal servitor was  so far from being a respecter of persons that he was accustomed to  speak of Lord Belpher as \"Percy\", and even as \"His Nibs\". It was,  indeed, an open secret among the upper servants at the castle, and  a fact hinted at with awe among the lower, that Keggs was at heart  a Socialist.    \"Good evening, your lordship. Good evening, sir.\"    Lord Belpher acknowledged the salutation with a grunt, but Reggie  was more affable.    \"How are you, Keggs? Now's your time, if you're going to do it.\" He  stepped a little to one side and indicated Lord Belpher's crimson  neck with an inviting gesture.    \"I beg your pardon, sir?\"    \"Ah. You'd rather wait till you can do it a little more privately.  Perhaps you're right.\"    The butler smiled indulgently. He did not understand what Reggie  was talking about, but that did not worry him. He had long since  come to the conclusion that Reggie was slightly mad, a theory  supported by the latter's valet, who was of the same opinion. Keggs  did not dislike Reggie, but intellectually he considered him  negligible.    \"Send something to drink into the library, Keggs,\" said Lord  Belpher.    \"Very good, your lordship.\"    \"A topping idea,\" said Reggie. \"I'll just take the old car round to  the garage, and then I'll be with you.\"    He climbed to the steering wheel, and started the engine. Lord  Belpher proceeded to the library, while Keggs melted away through  the green baize door at the end of the hall which divided the  servants' quarters from the rest of the house.    Reggie had hardly driven a dozen yards when he perceived his  stepmother and Lord Marshmoreton coming towards him from the  direction of the rose-garden. He drew up to greet them.    \"Hullo, mater. What ho, uncle! Back again at the old homestead,  what?\"    Beneath Lady Caroline's aristocratic front agitation seemed to  lurk.    \"Reggie, where is Percy?\"    \"Old Boots? I think he's gone to the library. I just decanted him  out of the car.\"    Lady Caroline turned to her brother.    \"Let us go to the library, John.\"    \"All right. All right. All right,\" said Lord Marshmoreton  irritably. Something appeared to have ruffled his calm.    Reggie drove on. As he was strolling back after putting the car  away he met Maud.    \"Hullo, Maud, dear old thing.\"    \"Why, hullo, Reggie. I was expecting you back last night.\"    \"Couldn't get back last night. Had to stick in town and rally round  old Boots. Couldn't desert the old boy in his hour of trial.\"  Reggie chuckled amusedly. \"'Hour of trial,' is rather good, what?  What I mean to say is, that's just what it was, don't you know.\"    \"Why, what happened to Percy?\"    \"Do you mean to say you haven't heard? Of course not. It wouldn't  have been in the morning papers. Why, Percy punched a policeman.\"    \"Percy did what?\"    \"Slugged a slop. Most dramatic thing. Sloshed him in the midriff.  Absolutely. The cross marks the spot where the tragedy occurred.\"    Maud caught her breath. Somehow, though she could not trace the  connection, she felt that this extraordinary happening must be  linked up with her escapade. Then her sense of humour got the  better of apprehension. Her eyes twinkled delightedly.    \"You don't mean to say Percy did that?\"    \"Absolutely. The human tiger, and what not. Menace to Society and  all that sort of thing. No holding him. For some unexplained reason  the generous blood of the Belphers boiled over, and then--zing.  They jerked him off to Vine Street. Like the poem, don't you know.  'And poor old Percy walked between with gyves upon his wrists.' And  this morning, bright and early, the beak parted him from ten quid.  You know, Maud, old thing, our duty stares us plainly in the  eyeball. We've got to train old Boots down to a reasonable weight  and spring him on the National Sporting Club. We've been letting a  champion middleweight blush unseen under our very roof tree.\"    Maud hesitated a moment.    \"I suppose you don't know,\" she asked carelessly, \"why he did it? I  mean, did he tell you anything?\"    \"Couldn't get a word out of him. Oysters garrulous and tombs chatty  in comparison. Absolutely. All I know is that he popped one into  the officer's waistband. What led up to it is more than I can tell  you. How would it be to stagger to the library and join the  post-mortem?\"    \"The post-mortem?\"    \"Well, I met the mater and his lordship on their way to the  library, and it looked to me very much as if the mater must have  got hold of an evening paper on her journey from town. When did she  arrive?\"    \"Only a short while ago.\"    \"Then that's what's happened. She would have bought an evening  paper to read in the train. By Jove, I wonder if she got hold of  the one that had the poem about it. One chappie was so carried away  by the beauty of the episode that he treated it in verse. I think  we ought to"]]]
