CHAPTER VII    POSTAGE BY STRATEGY      Life at Pretoria was at this time far from pleasant for the Boers who  remained loyal to their cause.    Most people who had the means, or were not bound to the country by the  closest ties, let their houses and went to Europe until the war was  over. Many of those who did not leave of their own free will were sent  away to the coast, where they were considered safe from plotting  against the British, and the few remaining Boer families were  apparently on their best behaviour, above all dreading the fate of  their fellow-countrymen.    The inmates of Harmony, perhaps more than any other Boers, feared  being sent away, because they knew that watching events from afar  would be a thousand times worse than enduring the restrictions of  English martial law, and that banishment would make it impossible for  them to render their fighting men any services. But they found the  time of inactivity terribly trying, so much so that they began to cast  about in their minds for work, for mischief--for anything, in fact, to  relieve the daily, deadening suspense and the dread, of what they knew  not, with which they were consumed.    Very galling was the severe censorship of their letters. Mrs. van  Warmelo's high spirit rebelled against the continued surveillance of  her correspondence and she determined to outwit the censor.    Then began an exciting period of smuggling and contriving, which led  to the most complete independence on their part of the services of Mr.  Censor, and ended in a well-organised and exceedingly clever system of  communication with friends in every part of the world.    On one occasion a sympathiser, leaving the country for good, offered  to smuggle through to Mrs. Cloete any document Mrs. van Warmelo might  wish to send.    There was nothing ready at the time, but Mrs. van Warmelo decided to  make use of this opportunity for some future occasion, and wrote to  her daughter on a tiny piece of tissue-paper, \"Whatever you may  receive in future, marked with a small blue cross, examine closely.\"    This was smuggled through in some way unknown to the sender and safely  delivered to Mrs. Cloete, for people were leaving Pretoria daily, and  it was not difficult to find suitable envoys.    Hansie had--and has to this day in her possession as a priceless  memento of the war--a small morocco case with a maroon velvet lining,  which travelled backwards and forwards between Harmony and Alphen  until some better way of communication was contrived. With a sharp  instrument Mrs. van Warmelo had removed the entire tray-like bottom of  the case, packed two or three closely-written sheets of tissue paper  in the opening, and pressed the little tray firmly down in its place  again. A tiny blue cross carelessly pasted on the bottom of the case  carried its own message to the conspirator at Alphen.    A few weeks later the case came back to Harmony with an antique gold  bracelet for Hansie and a long uncensored letter, in the snug  hiding-place, for Mrs. van Warmelo.    The next adventure was with a charming lady, whom we shall call \"the  English lady,\" she was so _very_ English. (If the truth were known,  she was not really English, but Cape Colonial, and, as is often the  case, more English than the English themselves, and more loyal than  the Queen.)    She unwisely said to a friend of Hansie's, who naturally repeated her  words to Hansie, that she would take good care not to convey letters  or parcels for the van Warmelos when she left for England, as she  shortly intended doing, because she was quite sure they \"smuggled,\"  or, if she did consent to take anything, she would examine it  thoroughly and destroy whatever it contained of a doubtful character.    When this reached Hansie's ears she made up her mind that \"the English  lady,\" and no other, would be her next messenger to Alphen. She  dismissed the morocco case from her mind as unsuitable for the  occasion, and deliberated long with her mother. At last she was sent  to town to buy three medium-sized dolls.    It did not matter much what kind of dolls they were, but they had to  have hollow porcelain heads, and they were to be bought from one man  only, an indispensable fellow-conspirator in one of the principal  stores in Church Street.    When she came home with the dolls her mother seemed pretty well  satisfied with the heads; they looked fairly roomy from the outside,  and so they were found to be when one of them had been carefully  steamed until the glue melted and the head dropped off.    Hansie had been writing, without lifting her head, while her mother  prepared the doll. The sheets of paper, rolled up into pellets, were  then forced through the slender neck, and the dolls weighed to see if  the difference in weight were noticeable. It was not. The head was  glued on again, a blue cross was marked on the body, and the dolls  were neatly wrapped in a brown-paper parcel.    \"The English lady\" soon after came to pay her farewell call. After the  usual formalities had been exchanged she remarked that she hoped to  visit Alphen soon after her arrival in Cape Town.    Mrs. van Warmelo was charmed and delighted, and asked whether she  would be good enough to take a parcel of three dolls for Mrs. Cloete's  little daughters.    There was just one moment's hesitation, then \"the English lady rapidly  made up her mind.\" \"Yes, with pleasure, but I must have the parcel  to-morrow, because my trunks have to be closed and sent on ahead.\"    Mrs. van Warmelo turned to her daughter in grave consultation. \"Let me  see, it is too late now, the shops will be closed, but you can perhaps  go to town on your bicycle early to-morrow morning to buy the dolls  and have them sent straight to Mrs. ----'s house.\"    \"Yes, mother, I'll do that with pleasure, but I won't have them sent.  I'll take them to her myself to be quite sure that she will have them  before twelve o'clock.\"    The next morning Hansie took the dolls to her fellow-conspirator  behind the counter and had them made up into an unmistakably  _professional_-looking parcel, tied and sealed with the label of the  shop.    Thus were the suspicions of \"the English lady\" lulled to rest. For her  comfort, should this ever reach her eye, I may say that there were no  dangerous communications in the doll's head, and should she feel  resentful at having been outwitted, she should have known better than  to _dare_ one of her country-women under martial law.    On other occasions sympathetic friends were willingly made use of, and  the methods of smuggling were so carefully planned in every case that  none of the bearers ever got into trouble, with one exception.    A foreign gentleman of high position, through his own carelessness,  found himself in a difficult and unpleasant situation. He was leaving  for Europe and expressed his willingness to take letters or documents,  provided they were packed so carefully that there would be no danger  of their being discovered.    Mrs. van Warmelo asked him if he could let her have any little article  in daily use and which he was in the habit of carrying about in his  pockets. He said that he would think about it, and sent her, next day,  a silver cigarette-case with a watered-silk lining. It did not take  long to remove the lining and to pack the letters under it. When the  lining was replaced and the cigarettes lay in neat rows against it,  the most careful observer could not detect anything unusual. These  letters were destined for Mr. W.T. Stead and contained a full account  of the condition of the Irene Concentration Camp.    In addition to this, Hansie gave her friend a photo of herself in a  sturdy frame, containing a hidden letter for Mrs. Cloete, whilst  instructing him to destroy the epistle if he could not hand it over to  Mrs. Cloete personally, moreover, not to remove the letter from the  cigarette-case until he arrived in London.    At Cape Town he met at the hotel a man who professed to be a great  pro-Boer and with whom he soon became so friendly that he, finding it  impossible to go out to Alphen himself, indiscreetly entrusted Mrs.  Cloete's letter into the hands of this stranger, with the result that  it was taken direct to the military authorities.    Our friend was arrested the next day as he was boarding the ocean  liner, and was kept under strict surveillance while his luggage was  being overhauled.    We were told afterwards by friends who witnessed the scene that,  during the process, he sat on deck with the utmost unconcern, smoking  cigarettes and toying with a silver case! No further evidence having  been found against him, he was allowed to sail away in peace, and Mrs.  Cloete too escaped without so much as a warning, perhaps because the  contents of the letter were not considered sufficiently incriminating.    Mr. Stead received the documents hidden in the cigarette-case in due  time and made full use of their contents in his monthly magazine, _The  Review of Reviews_.    Although, surprising to relate, no steps were taken against the  conspirators at Harmony, they soon noticed an extraordinary increase  in the vigilance of the censor, so much so, that the most harmless  communications failed to reach their destination, and when by chance  anything was allowed to pass through it was mutilated beyond  recognition, whole sentences being smirched with printer's ink or  pages cut away by the ruthless hand of the censor.    It may seem a small thing now, but this state of affairs, when letters  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20195"],[0,"Wood-Block Printing (#10)"],[1,"large number of successive impressions gave one an increasingly  delicate control of a block, and a high percentage of perfect  impressions. After the initial experiments and practice, the failures in  the later batches of the print were reduced to only 4 or 5 per cent. of  the completed prints. The work was done in batches of 250 prints, each  print receiving eight impressions, as shown on pages 98 to 109. Each of  the four printers took charge of a particular series of the blocks,  which were printed in a regular order. It was found most convenient to  print the key-block last of all, as the heavy blacks in it were inclined  to offset under the pressure of the baren and slightly soil the  colour-blocks, if the key-block was printed first, as is usually the  practice.    The colour-blocks were printed in the order in which they are placed in  the Appendix.    The best quality of work was done on nearly dry paper. The damping  sheets were placed among the new paper at the end of the day's work and  removed after ten or fifteen minutes, the printing paper then was left  standing over night between boards, ready for work in the morning, and  was not damped again until after receiving several impressions. Then it  was very slightly damped again by means of a damping sheet to every ten  or twelve prints placed there for a very few minutes.    As one printer finished the impressions from one of his blocks, the  batch of papers was passed on to the others, each in turn. In this way  three batches of 250 were printed without haste in one week, working  eight hours a day for five and a half days.    The chief difficulty experienced was in keeping to the exact colour and  quality of the type print, each printer being inclined to vary according  to individual preferences. To counteract this tendency, it is necessary  for one individual to watch and control the others in these respects.    Otherwise the work proceeded easily and made very clear the  possibilities of the craft for the printing of large numbers of prints  for special purposes where the qualities required are not obtainable by  machine printing. Obviously the best results will always be obtained by  the individual printing of his own work by an artist. This can only be  done, however, in comparatively small numbers, yet the blocks are  capable of printing very large quantities without deterioration. The set  of blocks used for the example given here showed very little  deterioration after 4000 impressions had been taken. The key-block was  less worn than any, the pressure being very slight for this block, and  the ink perfectly smooth. The impression of which a reproduction is  given on page 109 was taken after 4000 had been printed from the  key-block. Block No. 2 was much more worn by the gritty nature of the  burnt sienna used in its printing. It would be an easy matter, however,  to replace any particular colour-block that might show signs of wear in  a long course of printing.    Other examples given in the Appendix show qualities and methods of  treatment that are instructive or suggestive.    No. 6 is the key impression of a Japanese print in which an admirable  variety of resource is shown by its design; the character of each kind  of form being rendered by such simple yet so expressive indications. It  is instructive to study the means by which this is done, and to notice  how interior form is sometimes suggested by groups of spots or black  marks of varied shape while the indication of the external form is left  entirely to the shape of the colour-block subsequently to be printed.    Plate XVI is a reproduction of a print by Hiroshige and shows the  suggestive use of the key-block in rendering tree forms. Plates XVII and  XVIII show in greater detail this kind of treatment.    Plates XXIII-XXIV are key-blocks of modern print designs.
