If any other persons  were caught making a mess they were banished; and there was another law  that was perfectly awful.\"    \"What-was-it-go-ahead?\" said the nephew, running all his words together,  he was so anxious to know.    \"Why, if any person was found clearing up anywhere, and it turned out to  be a mess that the royal twins had made, the person was thrown from a  tower.\"    \"Did it kill them?\" the niece inquired, rather faintly.    \"Well, no, it didn't _kill_ them exactly, but it bounced them up pretty  high. You see, they fell on a bed of India-rubber about twenty feet  deep. It gave them a good scare; and that's the great thing in throwing  persons from a high tower.\"    The nephew hastened to improve the opportunity which seemed to be given  for asking questions.    \"What do you mean exactly by making a mess, uncle?\"    \"Oh, scattering scraps of paper about, or scuffing the landscape, or  getting jam or molasses on the face of nature, or having bonfires in the  back yard of the palace, or leaving dolls around on the throne. But what  did I say about asking questions? Now there's another thing about this  story: when it comes to the exciting part, if you move the least bit, or  even breathe loud, the story stops, just as if you didn't know which was  the Prince and which was the Princess. _Now_ do you understand?\"    The children both said \"Yes\" in a very small whisper, and cowered down  almost under the clothing, and held on tight, so as to keep from  stirring.    [Illustration: \"THE YOUNG KHAN AND KHANT ENTERED THE KINGDOM WITH A  MAGNIFICENT RETINUE.\"]    The papa went on: \"Well, about the time they had got these two laws in  full force, and forty or fifty thousand boys and girls had been banished  for making a mess, and pretty nearly all the neat old ladies in the  kingdom had been thrown from a high tower for cleaning up after the  Prince and Princess Butterflyflutterby and Flutterbybutterfly, the  young Khan and Khant of Tartary entered the kingdom with a magnificent  retinue of followers, to select a bride and groom from the children of  the royal family. As there were no children in the royal family except  the twins, the choice of the Khan and Khant naturally fell upon the  Prince--\"    \"Butterflyflutterby!\"    \"And the Princess--\"    \"Flutterbybutterfly!\"    \"Correct. It also happened that the Khan and the Khant were brother and  sister; but if you can't tell which was the brother and which was the  sister, the story stops at this point.\"    \"Why, but, uncle,\" said the little girl, reproachfully, \"you haven't  ever told us which is which yourself yet!\"    \"I know it. Because I'm waiting to find out. You see, with these Asiatic  names it's impossible sometimes to tell which is which. You have to wait  and see how they will act. If there had been a battle anywhere, and one  of them had screamed, and run away, then I suppose I should have been  pretty sure it was the sister; but even then I shouldn't know which was  the Khan and which was the Khant.\"    \"Well, what are we going to do about it, then?\" asked the nephew.    \"I don't know,\" said the papa. \"We shall just have to keep on and see.  Perhaps when they meet the Prince and Princess we shall find out. I  don't suppose a boy would fall in love with a boy.\"    \"No,\" said the niece; \"but he might want to go off with him and have  fun, or something.\"    \"That's true,\" said the papa. \"We've got to all watch out. Of course the  Khan and the Khant scuffed the landscape awfully, as they came along  through the kingdom, and got the face of nature all daubed up with  marmalade--they were the greatest persons for marmalade--and when they  reached the palace of the Prince and Princess they had to camp out in  the back yard, and they had to have bonfires to cook by, and they made a  frightful mess.    \"Well, there was the greatest excitement about it that there ever was.  The General-in-Chief kept his men under arms night and day, and the  fairy godmother was so worked up she almost had a brain-fever; and if  she had not taken six of aconite every night when she went to bed she  _would_ have had. You see, the question was what to do about the mess  that the Khan and Khant made. They were visitors, and it wouldn't have  been polite to banish them; and they belonged to a royal family, and so  nobody dared to clean up after them. The whole kingdom was in the most  disgusting state, and whenever the fairy godmother looked into the back  yard of the palace she felt as if she would go through the floor.    [Illustration: \"SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE THE CASE INTO HER OWN HANDS.\"]    \"Well, it kept on going from bad to worse. The only person that enjoyed  herself was the wicked enchantress; _she_ never had such a good time in  her life; and when the fairy godmother got hold of the Grand Vizier and  the Cadi, and told them to make a new law so as to allow the army to  clean up after royal visitors, without being thrown from a high tower,  the wicked enchantress enchanted the whole mess, so that the army could  not tell which the Prince and Princess had made, and which the Khan and  Khant had made; they were all four always playing together, anyway.    \"It seemed as if the poor old fairy godmother would go perfectly wild,  and she almost made the General crazy giving orders in one breath, and  taking them back in the next. She said that now something had got to be  done; she had stood it long enough; and she was going to take the case  into her own hands. She saw that she should have no peace of her life  till the Prince and Princess and the Khan and Khant were married. She  sent for the head Imam, and told him to bring those children right in  and marry them, and she would be responsible.    \"The Imam put his head to the floor--and it was pretty hard on him, for  he was short and stout, and he had to do it kind of sideways--and said  to hear was to obey; but he could not marry them unless he knew which  was which.    \"The fairy godmother screamed out: 'I don't _care_ which is which! Marry  them all, just as they are!'    \"But when she came to think it over, she saw that this would not do, and  so she tried to invent some way out of the trouble. One morning she woke  up with a splendid idea, and she could hardly wait to have breakfast  before she sent for the General-in-Chief. Her nerves were all gone, and  as soon as she saw him, she yelled at him: 'A sham battle--to-day--now--this  very instant! Right away, right away, right away!'    [Illustration: \"THE IMAM PUT HIS HEAD TO THE FLOOR.\"]    \"The General got her to explain herself, and then he understood that she  wanted him to have a grand review and sham battle of all the troops, in  honor of the Khan and Khant; and the whole court had to be present, and  especially the timidest of the ladies, that would almost scare a person  to death by the way they screamed when they were frightened. The General  was just going to say that the guns and cannon had all got rusty, and  the powder was spoiled from not having been used for so long, with the  everlasting cleaning up that had been going on; but the fairy godmother  stamped her foot and sent him flying. So the only thing he could do was  to set all the gnomes at work making guns and cannon and powder, and  about twelve o'clock they had them ready, and just after lunch the sham  battle began.    \"The troops marched and counter-marched, and fired away the whole  afternoon, and sprang mines and blew up magazines, and threw cannon  crackers and cannon torpedoes. There was such an awful din and racket  that you couldn't hear yourself think, and some of the court ladies were  made perfectly sick by it. They all asked to be excused, but the fairy  godmother wouldn't excuse one of them. She just kept them there on the  seats round the battle-field, and let them shriek themselves hoarse. So  many of them fainted that they had to have the garden hose brought, and  they kept it sprinkling away on their faces all the afternoon.    [Illustration: \"THEY BEGAN TO SCREAM, 'OH, THE COW! THE COW!'\"]    \"But it was a failure as far as the Khan and the Khant were concerned.  The fairy godmother expected that as soon as the loudest firing began,  the girl, whichever it was, would scream, and so they would know  which was which. But the Khan and Khant's father had been a famous  warrior, and he had been in the habit of taking his children to battle  with him from their earliest years, partly because his wife was dead and  he didn't dare trust them with the careless nurse at home, and partly  because he wanted to harden their nerves. So now they just clapped their  hands, and enjoyed the sham battle down to the ground.    \"About sunset the fairy godmother gave it up. She had to, anyway. The  troops had shot away all their powder, and the gnomes couldn't make any  more till the next day. So she set out to return to the city, with all  the court following her diamond chariot, and I can tell you she felt  pretty gloomy. She told the Grand Vizier that now she didn't see any end  to the trouble, and she was just going into hysterics when a barefooted  boy came along driving his cow home from the pasture. The fairy  godmother didn't mind it much, for she was in her chariot; but the court  ladies were on foot, and they began to scream, 'Oh, the cow! the cow!'  and to take hold of the knights, and to get on to the fence, till it was  perfectly packed with them; and who do you think the fairy godmother  found had scrambled up on top of her chariot?\"    The nephew and niece were afraid to risk a guess, and the papa had to  say:    \"The Khant! The fairy godmother pulled her inside and hugged her and  kissed her, she was so glad to find out that she was the one; and she  stopped the procession on the spot, and she called up the Imam, and he  married the Khant to Prince--\"    The papa stopped, and as the niece and nephew hesitated, he said, very  sternly, \"Well?\"    The fact is, they had "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22521"],[0,"The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus (#10)"],[1,"here.\"    \"I didn't know you had sons,\" said Mike, the attendant, regarding Kit  and William with some curiosity.    \"I haven't. One of these young men is an acrobat, who will be one of us.  The other is his friend. Bring along the grub as quick as possible--we  are all hungry.\"    \"All right, sir.\"    Running the length of the tent, which was about twenty feet by ten, was  a long table surrounded by benches.    The giant took his seat and placed the boys one on each side of him.  Just opposite sat a woman of twenty-five or thereabouts, who was already  eating breakfast.    \"Good morning, Mlle. Louise,\" said the giant.    \"Good morning, Mr. Henderson,\" responded the lady. \"Who are your young  companions?\"    \"I don't know their names, but this one,\" placing his hand on Kit's  shoulder, \"has been engaged by Mr. Barlow as an acrobat.\"    \"Indeed! He looks young.\"    \"I am sixteen,\" volunteered Kit.    \"What circus have you traveled with before this season?\" asked Mlle.  Louise.    \"I have never traveled with any, madam.\"    \"But you are an acrobat?\"    \"I have had my practice in a gymnasium.\"    \"How came Mr. Barlow to engage you?\"    \"At Smyrna I practiced a little with the Vincenti brothers.\"    \"At Smyrna? Why, that's where the lion dashed into the arena!\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Do you know the boy who had the courage to face him?\"    Kit blushed.    \"I am the boy,\" he said.    \"You don't mean it!\" exclaimed the lady, vivaciously. \"Why, you're a  hero. I must shake hands with you,\" and she reached across the table and  gave Kit a hearty grasp of the hand.    \"Is that so?\" interposed Achilles. \"Why, I didn't know you were the boy.  I was not present at the time, and only heard of it afterwards. Mlle.  Louise is right. You are a brave fellow.\"    \"I am much obliged to you both for your favorable opinion,\" said Kit  modestly, \"but I didn't realize my danger till afterwards.\"    \"Oh, heavens! I can see him now--that wicked beast!\" exclaimed the lady.  \"I was nearly scared out of my senses. As for poor Dupont, he was nearer  death than I ever want to be till my time comes.\"    \"Was Dupont the clown?\" asked Kit.    \"Yes. The lion held him down, with his foot upon the poor clown's back,  and but for your brave act he would have torn the poor fellow to pieces.  Mr. Henderson, you missed the most thrilling act of the evening.\"    \"So I begin to think. By the way, boys, I ought to have introduced this  lady. She is the famous aerial artist, whom you saw the other evening in  her wonderful feats upon the trapeze.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mlle. Louise, complacently, \"I think I have a pretty good  act. I get plenty of applause, eh, Mr. Henderson?\"    \"That's true. I think I should leave the circus if I had to appear in  your act. I never could summon up courage.\"    The lady laughed.    \"Monsieur Achilles,\" she said, \"I wouldn't advise you to emulate me. I  don't believe you could find a rope strong enough to support you, and if  you should fall, I pity the audience.\"    \"You have convinced me. I shall give up all thoughts of it,\" said the  giant, with mock gravity. \"It would suit better our young friend here,  who is an acrobat.\"    \"Did you ever practice on a trapeze?\" asked Mlle. Louise, turning to  Kit.    \"Yes, often,\" answered Kit, \"but never at a great height.\"    \"Would it frighten you to find yourself so high up in the air?\"    \"I don't think so; I have a cool head.\"    \"You must practice. I will give you a few hints myself. If you are cool  and courageous, as I judge you will soon learn. By the way, what is your  name?\"    \"Kit Watson.\"    \"It'll be something else when you begin work.\"    \"Do all performers have assumed names?\"    \"Generally. Here I am Mademoiselle Louise Lefroy, but it isn't a bit  like my real name.\"    Before this the boys had been served with breakfast. The steak was  rather tough, and the coffee not of the best quality, but Kit and  William thoroughly enjoyed it, and thought it about the best breakfast  they had ever eaten. Mlle. Louise continued to converse with them, and  was very gracious.    \"Are you too an acrobat?\" she asked William.    William became so confused that he swallowed some coffee the wrong way,  and came near choking.    \"No, ma'am,\" he answered bashfully, \"but I'd like to go round with the  show.\"    \"You'll be better off at home if you've got one,\" said the giant. \"You  are not a performer; you are too small for a property man, and not  strong enough for a razorback.\"    \"What's a razorback?\" asked William, in amazement.    Achilles smiled.    \"It's a boy or man who helps load and unload the circus cars,\" he  answered. \"It is heavy work, and you would be thrown among a low lot of  people--canvasmen, and such. Our young friend here, on the other hand,  will have a good sleeping berth, eat at the first table, and be well  provided for generally.\"    William looked disappointed. He had never thought particularly about  traveling with a circus till now, but his meeting with Kit had given him  a circus fever.    At ten o'clock Mr. Barlow came to the grounds, and Achilles volunteered  to go with Kit to speak with him about his engagement.          CHAPTER XIV.    SOME CIRCUS PEOPLE.      Mr. Barlow recognized Kit instantly.    \"So you have kept your promise, my young friend,\" he said. \"Well, have  you come to join us?\"    \"Yes, sir, if your offer holds good.\"    \"My offers always hold good; I never go back on my word.\"    Kit was glad to hear this, for he would have been placed in an  embarrassing position if, like some men, Mr. Barlow had forgotten an  offer made on the impulse of the moment.    \"Have you any directions to give, sir?\"    \"You may report to my manager, Mr. Bryant. First, however, it may be  well for you to see the Vincenti brothers, and arrange for a joint act.\"    \"When do you wish me to appear, sir?\"    \"Whenever you are ready. You may take a week to rehearse, if necessary.  Your pay will commence at once.\"    \"Thank you, Mr. Barlow; you are very kind and considerate.\"    Mr. Barlow smiled, and, waving his hand, passed on.    He was very popular with all who were in his employ, and had a high  reputation for kindness and strict integrity.    \"I'd like to work for him,\" said William Morris, who had listened to the  conversation between Kit and the circus proprietor.    \"I should like to have you along with me,\" replied Kit, \"but from what  Mr. Henderson says there is no good opening.\"    It was not till eleven o'clock that Kit met his future partners, the  Vincenti brothers.    \"Good!\" said Alonzo, in a tone of satisfaction. \"We must get up a joint  act. I suppose you haven't got a suit of tights?\"    \"No. I never expected to need one.\"    \"I have an extra one which I think will fit you. Though I am ten years  older than you we are about the same size.\"    Kit had occasion to remark that circus performers are short as a rule.  Many of them do not exceed five feet four inches in height, but  generally they are compactly built, with well developed muscles, and  possess unusual strength and agility.    The circus suit was brought out. It proved to be an excellent fit.    William Morris eyed Kit with admiration.    \"You look like a regular circus chap, Kit!\" he exclaimed. \"I wish I was  in your shoes.\"    \"Wait till you see whether I am a success, William,\" replied Kit.    \"Now, if you are ready, we will have a little practice,\" said Alonzo  Vincenti.    \"May I look on?\" asked William.    \"Oh, yes; we don't generally admit spectators, but you are a friend of  the boy.\"    They all entered the tent, and for an hour Kit was kept hard at work.    In the act devised by the Vincenti brothers, he stood on the shoulders  of the second, who in his turn stood on the shoulders of the first.  Various changes were gone through, in all of which Kit proved himself an  adept, and won high compliments from his new associates.    \"Can you tumble?\" asked Antonio.    Kit smiled.    \"I was afraid I should when I first got on your shoulders,\" he answered.    \"That was what I meant,--something like this,\" and he whirled across the  arena, rolling over and over on hands and feet in the manner of a cart  wheel.    Kit imitated Antonio rather slowly and awkwardly at first, but rapidly  showed improvement.    \"You'll soon learn,\" said Antonio. \"Now let me show you something else.\"    This something else was a succession of somersaults, made in the most  rapid manner.    Kit tried this also, slowly at first, as before, but proving a rapid  learner.    \"In the course of three or four days you will be able to do it in  public,\" said Alonzo.    \"When do you advise me to make my first appearance?\" asked Kit.    \"To-night, in our first act.\"    \"But shall I be ready?\"    \"You'll do. We may as well make a beginning.\"    \"I wish I could see you, Kit,\" said William.    \"Can't you?\"    \"I was going to the afternoon performance. It would make me too late  home if I stayed in the evening.\"    \"Won't there be some people over from Oakford that you can ride back  with?\"    \"I didn't think of that. Yes, John Woods told me that his father was  coming, and would bring him along. I could ride home with them.\"    \"Good! then you'd better stay.\"    \"Perhaps I'd better go over and buy a ticket.\"    But to William's satisfaction he was given free admission as a friend of  Kit. Not only that, but he was invited to take dinner and supper at the  circus table. In fact, he was treated with distinguished consideration.    \"Kit,\" he said, \"I was in luck to meet you.\"    \"And it was lucky for me that I met you. I shouldn't like to have met  Aaron Bickford single handed.\"    \"I wish old Bickford would come to the circus to-night. Wouldn't he be  surprised to see you performing in tights?\"    \"I think it would rather take him by surprise,\" said Kit, smiling.    Kit and William occupied seats at the afternoon performance as  spectators, it having been arranged that Kit's _debut_ should be made in  the evening. Our hero regarded "]]]
