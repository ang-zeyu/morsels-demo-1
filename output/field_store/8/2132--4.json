The huntsman's wife lit the fire, and soon the pine logs flashed up into  a blaze, and made the hut bright and warm. She then brought forth a  peggin of milk and a cake of barley-bread.    \"You must be hungry, sir,\" she said.    \"Hungry I am,\" said he; \"but I wouldn't ask for better fare than this if  I were in the king's palace.\"    \"Thank you kindly, sir,\" said she, \"and I hope you will eat enough, and  that it will do you good.\"    \"And while you are eating your supper,\" said the huntsman, \"I'll make  you a bed of fresh rushes.\"    \"Don't put yourself to that trouble,\" said the little man. \"When I have  done my supper I'll lie down here by the fire, if it is pleasing to you,  and I'll sleep like a top until morning. And now go back to your beds  and leave me to myself, and maybe some time when you won't be expecting  it I'll do a good turn for your kindness to the poor wayfarer.\"    \"Oh, it's no kindness at all,\" said the huntsman's wife. \"It would be  a queer thing if an Irish cabin would not give shelter and welcome in  a wild night like this. So good night, now, and we hope you will sleep  well.\"    \"Good night,\" said the little man, \"and may you and yours never sup  sorrow until your dying day.\"    The huntsman and his wife and Fergus then went back to their beds, and  the little man, having finished his supper, curled himself up by the  fire, and was soon fast asleep.    About an hour after a loud clap of thunder awakened Fergus, and before  it had died away he heard three knocks at the door. He aroused his parents  and told them.    \"Get up at once,\" said his mother, \"this is no night to keep a stranger  outside our door.\"    Fergus rose and opened the door, and a flash of lightning showed him a  little old woman, with a shuttle in her hand, standing outside.    \"Come in, and welcome,\" said he, and the little old woman stepped into  the room.    \"Blessings be on them who give welcome to a wanderer on a wild night  like this,\" said the old woman.    \"And who wouldn't give welcome on a night like this?\" said the  huntsman's wife, coming forward with a peggin of milk and a barley cake  in her hand, \"and sorry we are we have not better fare to offer you.\"    \"Enough is as good as a feast,\" said the little woman, \"and now go back  to your beds and leave me to myself.\"    \"Not till I shake down a bed of rushes for you,\" said the huntsman's  wife.    \"Don't mind the rushes,\" said the little woman; \"go back to your beds.  I'll sleep here by the fire.\"    [Illustration: \"Fergus knew it was the Pooka, the wild horse of the  mountains\"]    The huntsman's wife went to bed, and the little old woman, having eaten  her supper, lay down by the fire, and was soon fast asleep.    About an hour later another clap of thunder startled Fergus. Again he  heard three knocks at the door. He roused his parents, but he did not  wait for orders from them. He opened the door, and a flash of lightning  showed him outside the threshold a low-sized, shaggy, wild-looking  horse. And Fergus knew it was the Pooka, the wild horse of the  mountains. Bold as Fergus was, his heart beat quickly as he saw fire  issuing from the Pooka's nostrils. But, banishing fear, he cried out:    \"Come in, and welcome.\"    \"Welcome you are,\" said the huntsman, \"and sorry we are that we have not  better shelter or fare to offer you.\"    \"I couldn't wish a better welcome,\" said the Pooka, as he came over near  the fire and sat down on his haunches.    \"Maybe you would like a little bit of this, Master Pooka,\" said the  huntsman's wife, as she offered him a barley cake.    \"I never tasted anything sweeter in my life,\" said the Pooka, crunching  it between his teeth, \"and now if you can give me a sup of milk, I'll  want for nothing.\"    The huntsman's wife brought him a peggin of milk. When he had drunk it,  \"Now,\" says the Pooka, \"go back to your beds, and I'll curl myself up by  the fire and sleep like a top till morning.\"    And soon everybody in the hut was fast asleep.    When the morning came the storm had gone, and the sun was shining  through the windows of the hut. At the song of the lark Fergus got up,  and no one in the world was ever more surprised than he when he saw no  sign of the little old man, or the little old woman, or the wild horse  of the mountains. His parents were also surprised, and they all thought  that they must have been dreaming until they saw the empty peggins  around the fire and some pieces of broken bread; and they did not know  what to think of it all.    From that day forward the desire grew stronger in the heart of Fergus  for a change of life; and one day he told his parents that he was  resolved to seek his fortune. He said he wished to be a soldier, and that  he would set out for the king's palace, and try to join the ranks of the  Feni.    About a week afterwards he took leave of his parents, and having  received their blessing he struck out for the road that led to the  palace of the High King of Erin. He arrived there just at the time when  the great captain of the Fenian host was recruiting his battalions,  which had been thinned in recent battle.    The manly figure of Fergus, his gallant bearing, and handsome face, all  told in his favor. But before he could be received into the Fenian ranks  he had to prove that he could play the harp like a bard, that he could  contend with staff and shield against nine Fenian warriors, that he  could run with plaited hair through the tangled forest without loosening  a single hair, and that in his course he could jump over trees as high  as his head, and stoop under trees as low as his knee, and that he could  run so lightly that the rotten twigs should not break under his feet.  Fergus proved equal to all the tests, thanks to the wandering minstrel  who taught him the use of the harp, to his own brave heart, and to his  forest training. He was enrolled in the second battalion of the Feni,  and before long he was its bravest and ablest champion.    At that very time it happened that the niece of the High King of  Erin was staying with the king and queen in their palace at Tara. The  princess was the loveliest lady in all the land. She was as proud as  she was beautiful. The princes and chieftains of Erin in vain sought her  hand in marriage. From Alba and Spain, and the far-off isles of Greece,  kings came to woo her. From the northern lands came vikings in stately  galleys with brazen prows, whose oarsmen tore the white foam from the  emerald seas as they swept towards the Irish coasts. But the lady had  vowed she would wed with no one except a battle champion who could excel  in music the chief bard of the High King of Erin; who could outstrip on  his steed in the great race of Tara the white steed of the plains; and  who could give her as a wedding robe a garment of all the colors of the  rainbow, so finely spun that when folded up it would fit in the palm of  her small white hand. To fulfill these three conditions was impossible  for all her suitors, and it seemed as if the loveliest lady of the land  would go unmarried to her grave.    It chanced that once, on a day when the Fenian battalions were engaged  in a hurling-match, Fergus beheld the lady watching the match from her  sunny bower. He no sooner saw her than he fell over head and ears in  love with her, and he thought of her by night, and he thought of her by  day, and believing that his love was hopeless, he often wished he had  never left his forest-home.    The great fair of Tara[8] was coming on, and all the Feni were busy from  morning till night practicing feats of arms and games, in order to take  part in the contests to be held during the fair. And Fergus, knowing  that the princess would be present, determined to do his best to win the  prizes which were to be contended for before the ladies' eyes.    The fair began on the 1st of August, but for a whole week before the  five great roads of Erin were thronged with people of all sorts. Princes  and warriors on their steeds, battle champions in their chariots,  harpers in hundreds, smiths with gleaming spears and shields and  harness for battle steeds and chariots; troops of men and boys leading  racehorses; jewelers with gold drinking-horns, and brooches, and pins,  and earrings, and costly gems of all kinds, and chessboards of silver  and gold, and golden and silver chessmen in bags of woven brass; dyers  with their many-colored fabrics; bands of jugglers; drovers goading on  herds of cattle; shepherds driving their sheep; huntsmen with spoils  of the chase; dwellers in the lakes or by the fish-abounding rivers  with salmon and speckled trout; and countless numbers of peasants on  horseback and on foot, all wending their way to the great meeting-place  by the mound, which a thousand years before had been raised over the  grave of the great queen. For there the fair was to be held.    On the opening day the High King, attended by the four kings of Erin,  set out from the palace, and with them went the queen and the ladies of  the court in sparkling chariots. The princess rode in the chariot with  the High Queen, under an awning made of the wings of birds, to protect  them from the rays of the sun. Following the queen were the court ladies  in other chariots, under awnings of purple or of yellow silk.

Again  and again it seemed impossible that Da[=u]d could escape, but  Grimani's Fabian policy delivered the enemy out of his hands, and when  finally the Turkish fleet sailed triumphantly into the Gulf of Patras,  where it was protected by the Sultan's artillery at Lepanto, the Grand  Prior of Auvergne, who commanded the French squadron, sailed away in  disgust at the pusillanimity of his colleague. Lepanto fell, August  28th; and Grimani was imprisoned, nominally for life, for his  blundering: nevertheless, after twenty-one years he was made Doge.[17]    Venice never recovered from her defeat. The loss of Lepanto and the  consequent closing of the gulfs of Patras and Corinth were followed by  the capture of Modon, commanding the strait of Sapienza: the east  coast of the Adriatic and Ionian seas was no longer open to Christian  vessels. The Oriental trade of the republic was further seriously  impaired by the Turkish conquest of Egypt (1517),[18] which deprived  her of her most important mart; and the discovery of the New World  brought Spanish traders into successful competition with her own.  Venice indeed was practically an Oriental city; her skilled workmen  learned their arts in Egypt and Mesopotamia; her bazaars were filled  with the products of the East, with the dimity and other cloths and  silks and brocades of Damietta, Alexandria, Tinnis, and Cairo, cotton  from Ba'lbekk, silk from Baghd[=a]d, atlas satin from Ma'din in  Armenia; and she introduced to Europe not only the products of the  East, but their very names. Sarcenet is Saracen stuff; tabby is named  after a street in Baghd[=a]d where watered silk was made; Baldacchini  are simply \"Baldac,\" _i.e._, Baghd[=a]d, canopies; samite is  Sh[=a]m[=i], \"Syrian,\" fabric; the very coat of the Egyptian, the  _jubba_, is preserved in giuppa, jupe.[19] With the loss of her  Oriental commerce, which the hostility of the Turks involved, Venice  could no longer hold her own. She bowed to her fate and acknowledged  the Turkish supremacy by sea as well as by land. She even paid the  Sultan tribute for the island of Cyprus. When Suleym[=a]n the  Magnificent succeeded Sel[=i]m and took Belgrade (1521), Venice  hastily increased her payment and did homage for Zante as well. So  meek had now become the Bride of the Sea.    Turkey still suffered the annoyance of the Rhodian Corsairs, and till  they were removed her naval supremacy was not complete. Genoa and  Venice had been humbled: the turn of the Knights of St. John was  come. Sel[=i]m had left his son, the great Suleym[=a]n, the legacy of  a splendid fleet, prepared for this very enterprize. One hundred and  three swift galleys, thirty-five galleasses, besides smaller craft,  and 107 transports, \"naves, fustes, mahones, tafforees, galions, et  esquirasses,\"[20] formed a noble navy, and Rhodes fell, after an  heroic defence, at the close of 1522. For six months the Knights held  out, against a fleet which had swollen to four hundred sail and an  army of over a hundred thousand men commanded by the Sultan in person.  It was a crisis in the history of Europe: the outpost of Christendom  was at bay. The Knights realized their duty nobly, but they had the  best engineers in the world against them, and all the resources of a  now mighty empire, wielded by a master-mind. Suleym[=a]n surrounded  the city with his works, and made regular approaches for his advancing  batteries and mines; yet at the end of a month not a wall was down,  and the eight bastions of the eight Tongues of the Order--the English,  French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, German, Provencal, and  Auvergnat--were so far unmoved. Gabriel Martinego of Candia  superintended the countermines with marked success.[21] At last the  English bastion was blown up; the Turks swarmed to the breach, and  were beaten back with a loss of two thousand men. A second assault  failed, but on September 24th they succeeded in getting a foothold,  and the destruction of the Spanish, Italian, and Provencal bastions by  the Turkish mines and the consequent exposure of the exhausted  garrison rendered the defence more and more perilous. The Ottoman army  too was suffering severely, from disease, as well as from the deadly  weapons of the Knights, and in the hope of sparing his men Suleym[=a]n  offered the garrison life and liberty if they would surrender the  city. At first they proudly rejected the offer, but within a  fortnight, finding their ammunition exhausted and their numbers sadly  thinned, on December 21st they begged the Sultan to repeat his  conditions, and, with an honourable clemency, Suleym[=a]n let them all  depart unmolested in his own ships to such ports in Europe as seemed  best to them.[22]    The fall of Rhodes removed the last obstacle to the complete  domination of the Ottoman fleet in the eastern basin of the  Mediterranean. Henceforward no Christian ship was safe in those waters  unless by the pleasure of the Sultan. The old maritime Republics were  for the time reduced to impotence, and no power existed to challenge  the Ottoman supremacy in the Aegean, Ionian, and Adriatic Seas.    Almost at the same time the brothers Barbarossa had effected a similar  triumph in the west. The capture of Algiers and the firm establishment  of various strong garrisons on the Barbary coast had given the Turkish  Corsairs the command of the western basin of the Mediterranean.  Suleym[=a]n the Magnificent saw the necessity of combination; he knew  that Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n could teach the Stambol navigators and  ship-builders much that they ought to learn; his Grand Vez[=i]r  Ibrah[=i]m strenuously urged a closer relation between the Turkish  powers of the east and west; and Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n received the Imperial  command to present himself at Constantinople.

VII.    DORIA AND BARBAROSSA.    1533.      Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n was in no hurry to visit the Sublime Porte. He had to  provide for the safety and government of Algiers during his absence,  when exposed to the dangers both of foreign attack and internal  intrigue. He had to reckon with the galleys of the Knights of St.  John, who, after wandering homeless for a longer time than was at all  creditable to that Christendom which they had so heroically defended  at Rhodes, had finally settled in no less convenient a spot than  Malta, whence they had every opportunity of harassing the operations  of the Corsairs (1530). Moreover Andrea Doria was cruising about, and  he was not the sort of opponent Barbarossa cared to meet by hazard.  The great Genoese admiral considered it a personal duel with  Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n. Each held the supreme position on his own side of the  water. Both were old men and had grown old in arms. Born in 1468, of a  noble Genoese family, Doria was sixty-five years of age, of which  nearly fifty had been spent in warfare. He had been in the Pope's  guard, and had seen service under the Duke of Urbino and Alfonso of  Naples, and when he was over forty he had taken to the sea and found  himself suddenly High Admiral of Genoa (1513). His appointment to the  command of his country's galleys was due to his zealous services on  shore, and not to any special experience of naval affairs; indeed the  commander of the galleys was as much a military as a naval officer.  Doria, however, late as he adopted his profession, possessed undoubted  gifts as a seaman, and his leadership decided which of the rival  Christian Powers should rule the Mediterranean waves. He devoted his  sword to France in 1522, when a revolution overthrew his party in his  own republic; and so long as he was on the French side the command of  the sea, so far as it did not belong to the Barbary Corsairs, belonged  to France. When in 1528 he judged himself and his country ill-used by  Francis I., he carried over his own twelve galleys to the side of  Charles V.; and then the Imperial navies once more triumphed. Doria  was the arbiter of fortune between the contending states. Doria was  the liberator of Genoa, and, refusing to be her king, remained her  idol and her despot. No name struck such terror into the hearts of the  Turks; many a ship had fallen a prey to his devouring galleys, and  many a Moslem slave pulled at his oars or languished in Genoese  prisons. Officially an admiral, he was at the same time personally a  Corsair, and used his private galleys to increase his wealth.    Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n's fame among Christians and Turks alike was at least  as great and glorious as his rival's. He had driven the Spaniards out  of Algiers and had inflicted incalculable injuries upon the ships and  shores of the Empire. Though the two had roved the same sea for twenty  years, they had never met in naval combat: perhaps each had respected  the other too much to risk an encounter. Long ago, when  Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n was unknown to fame, Doria had driven him from the  Goletta (1513); and in 1531 the Genoese admiral made a descent upon  Shersh[=e]l, which Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n had been strengthening, to the  great detriment and anxiety of the opposite coast of Spain. The  Imperialists landed in force, surprised the fort, and liberated seven  hundred Christian slaves. Then, contrary to"]]]
