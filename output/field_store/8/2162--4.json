In  a matter concerning the integrity of national territory acquired so  dearly, King Constantine felt that he could not afford to allow any  ambiguity or uncertainty: he was willing to waive the other two points,  but not that.  He therefore begged his brother to see M. Poincare and  solicit in his name the President's help to secure that indispensable  assurance.  \"The essential thing,\" he said, \"is that the Entente Powers  should give us a solemn promise that they will respect and make others  respect, until the re-establishment of peace, our territorial  integrity, and that they will not permit any damage to it by the future  Peace Treaty.  Remark to him that Greece has the right to be astonished  that friendly Powers ready to accept her as an ally decline to explain  themselves clearly with her.\" [13]  What was in the King's mind may be  seen from the President's answer: The Powers did not wish to give a  formal pledge in as many words lest the Bulgars should be stirred to  {39} hostile action on realizing that Cavalla was lost to them.[14]    Prince George, in reporting M. Poincare's reply, added that the fear of  any damage being inflicted on Greek territorial integrity by the future  Peace Treaty was completely devoid of foundation; that, having himself  expressed this fear, he had been answered: \"How can you imagine that we  could dispose of any part whatever of the territory of an allied State  without its consent?\" [15]    These fair words failed to reassure the Hellenic Government, which,  after mature reflection, concluded that the formula suggested by M.  Delcasse did not sufficiently safeguard Greece against combinations  likely to affect her territorial integrity.  Its misgivings, which  sprang in the first instance from the refusal of an explicit promise,  were strengthened by the reason given by M. Poincare for that refusal.  Consequently, it regretted that the Entente Powers did not see their  way to come to an understanding for a collaboration which both sides  desired, and repeated the assurance of a most benevolent neutrality  towards them.[16]    The Greek position was plain: Greece made proposals which constituted a  break with the policy pursued deliberately since the beginning of the  War--proposals for an active partnership, and in return put forward  conditions which ultimately narrowed down to a mere pledge that she  should not, as the end of it all, find herself robbed of Cavalla.  There were certain things she could do and, therefore, wished to do.  There were certain things she could not do, and must be assured that  she would not be made to do them.  The Entente Powers, on the other  hand, would bind themselves to nothing: which is preferable, they said  in effect, the elaborate letter of a bargaining bond, or the spirit of  spontaneous co-operation; a legal obligation or the natural union of  hearts?  What Greece needs, rather than rigid clauses with a seal and a  signature, is the steady, unwavering sympathy of her friends.  If you  come with us in a courageous forward campaign for the {40} liberation  of the world and righteousness, how could we fail to be with you in  every single question affecting compensations or the integrity of your  territories?  That's all very fine, said the Greeks.  But----    The mistrust of the Greeks was only too well founded.  Although  Bulgaria received arms from Austria and allowed the free passage of  German munitions which enabled Turkey to carry on the defence of  Gallipoli, the Entente Powers, satisfied with her Premier's  explanations and professions of sympathy, would not give up the hope of  seeing her on their side.  Indeed, they were more hopeful than ever; M.  Poincare told Prince George he would not be surprised to see that  happen \"in two or three days,\" [17] and the British Minister at Sofia,  being less hopeful and giving proofs of perspicacity, was replaced.    About the same time it came to the knowledge of the Entente Governments  that the Greek General Staff had resumed its efforts to induce the  Servian military authorities to concert measures for their mutual  safety, pointing out that, the moment Bulgarian troops crossed the  Servian frontier, it would be too late.  Whereupon both Servia and  Greece were sternly warned against wounding Bulgarian  susceptibilities--and threatened with the displeasure of the Powers,  who wanted to maintain between the Balkan States good fellowship--by  the unhappy project which was once more to the fore.  And ere the end  of May both States learnt that their territories were actually on offer  to Bulgaria.    They received the intelligence as might have been expected.  The  Servian Premier, after consulting with the King, the Crown Prince, the  Cabinet, and all prominent statesmen, informed the representatives of  the Entente that Servia, in spite of her desire to meet the wishes of  her friends and allies, could not agree to put herself in their hands:  the Constitution forbade the cession of territory without the sanction  of the National Assembly.  He asked them to understand that this  decision was final, and that no future Servian Government could be  counted upon to {41} give a different answer, seeing that the present  Government embraced every political party.[18]    Not less uncompromising was the attitude of Greece.  When the news  reached Athens from Paris, the Hellenic Government could hardly believe  it: \"It is so contrary to the principles of justice and liberty  proclaimed by the Entente Powers--it seems to us absolutely impossible  to despoil a neutral State, and one, too, whose friendly neutrality has  been so consistently useful to the Allies, in order to buy with its  territories the help of a people which has hitherto done all it could  to help the enemies of the Entente.  By what right, and on what ground  could they mutilate our country?  The opinions once expressed by M.  Venizelos, and since abandoned even by their author, do not constitute  a sufficient ground for spoliation.  The whole thing is an unthinkable  outrage: it shows that our fears were justified and our demand for a  guarantee was absolutely indispensable.\" [19]    France, through M. Delcasse, and England, through Lord Crewe, sought to  dispel these fears by formally disclaiming any intention to press upon  Greece a mutilation to which she objected, and explaining that the  eventual cession of Cavalla was only envisaged on condition that she  should consent of her own accord.  M. Zographos, however, who had done  his best to bring Greece in on reasonable terms, convinced of his  failure, resigned; and after his departure the Gounaris Government  would permit itself no further discussion upon the subject of  intervention.    During the lull that ensued, the Greek General Staff once more, in  June, approached the Servian Government with detailed suggestions for a  common plan against Bulgaria, dwelling on the necessity of a  preliminary concentration of sufficient Servian troops along the  Graeco-Serbo-Bulgarian frontier to counterbalance the Bulgarian  advantage in rapidity of mobilization.  These steps proved as barren as  all the preceding: while Servia would not try to conjure the Bulgarian  peril by the sacrifices which the Entente recommended, she could not  provide against it by entering into arrangements with Greece which the  Entente disapproved.    {42}    Matters came to a head on 3 August, when the British Minister at Sofia  made to the Bulgarian Government a formal offer of Cavalla and an  undefined portion of its hinterland, as well as of Servian territory in  Macedonia, stating that Great Britain would bring pressure to bear on  those countries, and make the cession to them of any compensations  elsewhere conditional on their consent to this transaction.    The shock lost nothing of its intensity by being long anticipated.  M.  Passitch, the Servian Premier, in an interview with the Greek Minister  at Nish, expressed his profound dismay at the corner into which Servia  was driven; much as she resented this proposal, the fact that she was  entirely dependent on the Entente--whose high-handed methods he did not  fail to criticize--forced her to give it consideration.    If Servia had been dismayed, Greece was enraged.  M. Gounaris addressed  a strongly-worded remonstrance to the British Minister at Athens,  reminding him that in May his Government had protested against the  offer of Greek territory to Bulgaria, and that both Lord Crewe and M.  Delcasse had disavowed any intention to bring the least pressure to  bear upon Greece, who had thus the right to count on her independence  being respected.  The Entente Powers, he went on, thought they could  promise Bulgaria an agreement in which their own will took the place of  Greece's consent, with the idea of exacting her acceptance afterwards.  But they were greatly mistaken.  The Hellenic Government, voicing the  unanimous sentiments of the people as well as its own judgment,  repelled with indignation the idea of making the national heritage an  object of a bargain; and while thanking the Entente Powers for the  courtesy which inspired their notification, it protested in the most  energetic and solemn"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22690"],[0,"Rembrandt and His Works (#10)"],[1,"ce. As far as engraving is concerned, it is but  fair to notice that Lawrence had Rembrandt on his side, of whose works  he was a great admirer.    [Illustration: DOCTOR FAUSTUS]    I may appear to have dwelt too long upon this subject of engraving,  but as the etchings of Rembrandt form so large a portion of his  popularity, we cannot enter too minutely into the various sources of  their excellence. I shall now proceed to describe the etching of \"Doctor  Faustus,\" a copy of which I have given. Some think that it represents  Fust, the partner of Guttenburg, who, by his publication of Bibles in  Paris, was looked upon by the people as a dealer in the black art. The  papers hung up by the side of the window look like the sheets of his  letter-press, and the diagram that attracts his attention, and rouses  him from his desk, indicates by words and symbols a connexion with Holy  Writ. But the general opinion is, that it is Dr. John Faustus, a German  physician, in his study. This Dr. Faustus was supposed to have dealings  with familiar spirits, one of which has raised this cabalistic vision,  that enters the window with overwhelming splendour, like the bursting  of a shell, communicating its radiance to the head and breast of the  figure, and, descending by his variegated garment, is extended in a  spread of light over the whole lower part of the composition. The light  of the window being surrounded by a mass of dark, receives intense  importance, and is carried as far as the art can go. It is also, I may  observe, rendered less harsh and cutting by its shining through the  papers at the side, and by the interruption of the rays of the diagram.  The light passing behind the figure, and partially thrown upon a skull,  gives an awe-striking appearance to the whole; while the flat breadth of  light below is left intentionally with the objects in mere outline. This  etching seems never to have been touched on from the first impressions  to the last--the first state is dark with excess of burr; the last is  merely the burr worn off.    Before quitting this subject, I wish to make a few remarks. It has been  said by some of Rembrandt's biographers, that he made alterations in his  prints for the sake of enhancing their value; but we know by experience  that every alteration he made, however it might be for the better,  struck off a certain portion of its money value. I believe his desire  to better the effect was the only incitement. Many were improved by his  working upon them after the first proofs, and many were deteriorated in  effect; but every additional line at the least struck off a guilder.  I have mentioned that in this etching the brilliancy of the light in the  window is enhanced by its being surrounded by a mass of dark; but the  same advantage would have accrued from its extension by a mass of half  light, as it would then have had a greater breadth of soft light. This  subject was a great favourite with the late Sir David Wilkie, and he  introduced this window in his picture of \"The School;\" but this being  a light composition, he treated it in the way I have mentioned above.  It was a common practice with Wilkie to adopt some part of a celebrated  work as a point to work from, and carry out his design upon this  suggestion. The spectator, by this means, was drawn into a  predisposition of its excellence, without knowing whence it had arisen.  Thus, in his \"John Knox Preaching,\" there are many points of similarity  with the \"St. Paul Preaching,\" by Raffaelle. I may also mention here  what we often perceive in the works of Rembrandt--in place of having the  light hemmed in by a dark boundary, it is spread out into a mass of  half-light; and the same treatment is adopted with regard to his extreme  darks, they communicate their properties to the surrounding ground.  These qualities are the foundation of breadth and softness of effect.    These observations may appear iterations of what has been mentioned  before--but truths get strengthened by being placed in new positions.  In dividing a work of this kind into portions, it is difficult to give  a preference to any department, especially with such an artist as  Rembrandt, who was equally celebrated in all--and I have only given  a priority to historical subjects as they hold a higher rank than  portraiture. But his portraits are those productions of his pencil  which are most peculiar to himself.    [Illustration: BURGOMASTER SIX]          PORTRAIT OF THE BURGOMASTER SIX.      This is the most finished and perfect of all the etchings of Rembrandt;  and as it was done expressly for his friend and patron, we can easily  imagine that the painter exerted himself to the utmost, so as to render  it worthy of the subject. I have been at some trouble to get an account  of the family of Jan Six, but have gleaned little from those books  connected with the history of Holland. During the war with England, in  the reign of Charles the Second, he was Secretary of State to the City  of Amsterdam, and his family was afterwards connected with some of their  most celebrated men. But what has rendered his name more famous than  intermarrying with the families of Van Tromp or De Ruyter, is his  patronage of Rembrandt--in the same way that Lord Southampton's name  is ennobled by his patronage of Shakspere. We know he was devoted to  literature as well as the fine arts, having left a tragedy on the story  of Medea, a copy of which is mentioned in the catalogue of Rembrandt's  effects, and an etching by the artist was prefixed to the work--viz.,  the \"Marriage of Jason and Creusa;\" the rare states of this print are  before the quotation of the Dutch verses underneath--also the statue of  Juno is without the diadem, which was afterwards added. I have mentioned  that this portrait was a private plate; in fact, the copper is still  in the possession of the family. In a sale which took place in 1734,  for a division of the property among the various branches, fourteen  impressions were sold, but brought comparatively small prices, from the  number to be contended for. Two proofs, however, on India paper are  still in the portfolio of his descendants, which in five years will, it  is said, be brought to the hammer, as by that time the parties will be  of age. These proofs will in all probability realize two hundred guineas  each. The ease and natural attitude of the figure in this work are  admirable: the intensity of the light, with the delicacy and truth of  the reflected lights, are rendered with the strong stamp of genius; the  diffusion of the light also, by means of the papers on the chair, and  the few sparkling touches in the shadow, completely take this etching  out of the catalogue of common portraiture. The only work I can at  present think of that can be brought into competition with it, is the  full-length portrait of Charles the First, by Vandyke, in the Queen's  Collection, and which is rendered so familiar by Strange's admirable  engraving.    In entering into an examination of the execution of this print, it is  evident the whole effect is produced by means of the dry point, which  must have been a work of great labour. The best impressions are on India  paper; and I perceive, by referring to Gersaint's catalogue, that at the  sale of the Burgomaster's property, they only brought about eighteen  florins. The next portrait amongst his etchings that at all approaches  to the Burgomaster, is that of \"Old Haring,\" which has always struck  me as one of the foundations for the style of Sir Joshua Reynolds in  portraiture. A fine impression of this work, on India paper, is more  like Sir Joshua than many prints after his own pictures; and with all  the high veneration I have for Reynolds, I cannot omit noticing how  very ambiguously he frequently speaks of this great genius. We know  his master, Hudson, had an excellent collection of Rembrandt's works,  and therefore he must have been early imbued with their merits and  peculiarities. This, however, we shall have a better opportunity of  noticing when we come to the treatment of colour. The next etching  in excellence I should mention is the \"Portrait of John Lutma, the  Goldsmith,\" with the light background; this was afterwards softened  down by the introduction of a window. And here I must observe, that  though he often had light backgrounds to his prints, yet in his finished  pictures they were generally the reverse. The etching of \"Ephraim Bonus,  the Jewish Physician,\" is also one of his most effective works; the  introduction of the balustrade, on which he leans descending the  staircase, removes it from the ordinary level of mere portraiture.  On the hand that rests upon the balustrade, is a ring, which in the  very rare impressions, from its being done with the dry point, prints  dark from the burr. These are invaluable, as in that state the whole  work has the fulness and richness of a picture. A very large sum was  given for the impression of the print in this state--now in the British  Museum--in fact, one hundred and sixty pounds; though at the Verstolke  sale, where this print was purchased, the commission given amounted to  two hundred and fifty pounds: but when we consider that the collection  in the British Museum is now the finest in existence, no extra price  should be spared to complete the collection, especially as these works  are foundations for the sure improvement of the fine arts in the  country. The crown jewels are exhibited as a necessary appendage to the  rank of the nation--but there the value stops; now the works of art in  this country are not only valuable, but intrinsically beneficial. We  know that Charles the Second pawned the crown pearls to the Dutch for a  few thousands; but our collection of Rembrandts would realize in Holland  at least ten thousand pounds. This, of course, is a digression, and is  merely mentioned here to show how absurd the hue and cry is, that the  country is"]]]
