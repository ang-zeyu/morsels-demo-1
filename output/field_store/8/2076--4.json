[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/209"],[0,"The Turn of the Screw (#10)"],[1,"the two or three dim elements of comfort  that still remained to me. I should not for instance have been able to  asseverate to my friend that I was certain--which was so much to the  good--that _I_ at least had not betrayed myself. I should not have been  prompted, by stress of need, by desperation of mind--I scarce know what  to call it--to invoke such further aid to intelligence as might spring  from pushing my colleague fairly to the wall. She had told me, bit by  bit, under pressure, a great deal; but a small shifty spot on the wrong  side of it all still sometimes brushed my brow like the wing of a bat;  and I remember how on this occasion--for the sleeping house and the  concentration alike of our danger and our watch seemed to help--I felt  the importance of giving the last jerk to the curtain. \"I don't  believe anything so horrible,\" I recollect saying; \"no, let us put it  definitely, my dear, that I don't. But if I did, you know, there's  a thing I should require now, just without sparing you the least bit  more--oh, not a scrap, come!--to get out of you. What was it you had in  mind when, in our distress, before Miles came back, over the letter from  his school, you said, under my insistence, that you didn't pretend for  him that he had not literally EVER been 'bad'? He has NOT literally  'ever,' in these weeks that I myself have lived with him and so closely  watched him; he has been an imperturbable little prodigy of delightful,  lovable goodness. Therefore you might perfectly have made the claim for  him if you had not, as it happened, seen an exception to take. What was  your exception, and to what passage in your personal observation of him  did you refer?\"    It was a dreadfully austere inquiry, but levity was not our note, and,  at any rate, before the gray dawn admonished us to separate I had got  my answer. What my friend had had in mind proved to be immensely to the  purpose. It was neither more nor less than the circumstance that for  a period of several months Quint and the boy had been perpetually  together. It was in fact the very appropriate truth that she had  ventured to criticize the propriety, to hint at the incongruity, of  so close an alliance, and even to go so far on the subject as a frank  overture to Miss Jessel. Miss Jessel had, with a most strange manner,  requested her to mind her business, and the good woman had, on this,  directly approached little Miles. What she had said to him, since I  pressed, was that SHE liked to see young gentlemen not forget their  station.    I pressed again, of course, at this. \"You reminded him that Quint was  only a base menial?\"    \"As you might say! And it was his answer, for one thing, that was bad.\"    \"And for another thing?\" I waited. \"He repeated your words to Quint?\"    \"No, not that. It's just what he WOULDN'T!\" she could still impress upon  me. \"I was sure, at any rate,\" she added, \"that he didn't. But he denied  certain occasions.\"    \"What occasions?\"    \"When they had been about together quite as if Quint were his tutor--and  a very grand one--and Miss Jessel only for the little lady. When he had  gone off with the fellow, I mean, and spent hours with him.\"    \"He then prevaricated about it--he said he hadn't?\" Her assent was clear  enough to cause me to add in a moment: \"I see. He lied.\"    \"Oh!\" Mrs. Grose mumbled. This was a suggestion that it didn't matter;  which indeed she backed up by a further remark. \"You see, after all,  Miss Jessel didn't mind. She didn't forbid him.\"    I considered. \"Did he put that to you as a justification?\"    At this she dropped again. \"No, he never spoke of it.\"    \"Never mentioned her in connection with Quint?\"    She saw, visibly flushing, where I was coming out. \"Well, he didn't show  anything. He denied,\" she repeated; \"he denied.\"    Lord, how I pressed her now! \"So that you could see he knew what was  between the two wretches?\"    \"I don't know--I don't know!\" the poor woman groaned.    \"You do know, you dear thing,\" I replied; \"only you haven't my dreadful  boldness of mind, and you keep back, out of timidity and modesty and  delicacy, even the impression that, in the past, when you had, without  my aid, to flounder about in silence, most of all made you miserable.  But I shall get it out of you yet! There was something in the boy that  suggested to you,\" I continued, \"that he covered and concealed their  relation.\"    \"Oh, he couldn't prevent--\"    \"Your learning the truth? I daresay! But, heavens,\" I fell, with  vehemence, athinking, \"what it shows that they must, to that extent,  have succeeded in making of him!\"    \"Ah, nothing that's not nice NOW!\" Mrs. Grose lugubriously pleaded.    \"I don't wonder you looked queer,\" I persisted, \"when I mentioned to you  the letter from his school!\"    \"I doubt if I looked as queer as you!\" she retorted with homely force.  \"And if he was so bad then as that comes to, how is he such an angel  now?\"    \"Yes, indeed--and if he was a fiend at school! How, how, how? Well,\"  I said in my torment, \"you must put it to me again, but I shall not be  able to tell you for some days. Only, put it to me again!\" I cried in a  way that made my friend stare. \"There are directions in which I must  not for the present let myself go.\" Meanwhile I returned to her first  example--the one to which she had just previously referred--of the boy's  happy capacity for an occasional slip. \"If Quint--on your remonstrance  at the time you speak of--was a base menial, one of the things Miles  said to you, I find myself guessing, was that you were another.\" Again  her admission was so adequate that I continued: \"And you forgave him  that?\"    \"Wouldn't YOU?\"    \"Oh, yes!\" And we exchanged there, in the stillness, a sound of the  oddest amusement. Then I went on: \"At all events, while he was with the  man--\"    \"Miss Flora was with the woman. It suited them all!\"    It suited me, too, I felt, only too well; by which I mean that it suited  exactly the particularly deadly view I was in the very act of forbidding  myself to entertain. But I so far succeeded in checking the expression  of this view that I will throw, just here, no further light on it than  may be offered by the mention of my final observation to Mrs. Grose.  \"His having lied and been impudent are, I confess, less engaging  specimens than I had hoped to have from you of the outbreak in him of  the little natural man. Still,\" I mused, \"They must do, for they make me  feel more than ever that I must watch.\"    It made me blush, the next minute, to see in my friend's face how much  more unreservedly she had forgiven him than her anecdote struck me as  presenting to my own tenderness an occasion for doing. This came out  when, at the schoolroom door, she quitted me. \"Surely you don't accuse  HIM--\"    \"Of carrying on an intercourse that he conceals from me? Ah, remember  that, until further evidence, I now accuse nobody.\" Then, before  shutting her out to go, by another passage, to her own place, \"I must  just wait,\" I wound up.          IX      I waited and waited, and the days, as they elapsed, took something from  my consternation. A very few of them, in fact, passing, in constant  sight of my pupils, without a fresh incident, sufficed to give to  grievous fancies and even to odious memories a kind of brush of the  sponge. I have spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary childish  grace as a thing I could actively cultivate, and it may be imagined if  I neglected now to address myself to this source for whatever it  would yield. Stranger than I can express, certainly, was the effort to  struggle against my new lights; it would doubtless have been, however,  a greater tension still had it not been so frequently successful. I  used to wonder how my little charges could help guessing that I thought  strange things about them; and the circumstances that these things only  made them more interesting was not by itself a direct aid to keeping  them in the dark. I trembled lest they should see that they WERE so  immensely more interesting. Putting things at the worst, at all events,  as in meditation I so often did, any clouding of their innocence could  only be--blameless and foredoomed as they were--a reason the more for  taking risks. There were moments when, by an irresistible impulse, I  found myself catching them up and pressing them to my heart. As soon as  I had done so I used to say to myself: \"What will they think of that?  Doesn't it betray too much?\" It would have been easy to get into a sad,  wild tangle about how much I might betray; but the real account, I feel,  of the hours of peace that I could still enjoy was that the immediate  charm of my companions was a beguilement still effective even under the  shadow of the possibility that it was studied. For if it occurred to me  that I might occasionally excite suspicion by the little outbreaks of my  sharper passion for them, so too I remember wondering if I mightn't see  a queerness in the traceable increase of their own demonstrations.    They were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me;  which, after all, I could reflect, was no more than a graceful response  in children perpetually bowed over and hugged. The homage of which they  were so lavish succeeded, in truth, for my nerves, quite as well as if  I never appeared to myself, as I may say, literally to catch them at a  purpose in it. They had never, I think, wanted to do so many things for  their poor protectress; I mean--though they got their lessons better and  better, which was naturally what would please her most--in the way of  diverting, entertaining, surprising her; reading her passages, telling  her stories, acting her charades, pouncing out at her, in disguises, as  animals and historical characters, and above all astonishing her by the  \"pieces\" they had secretly got by heart and could interminably recite. I  should never get to the bottom--were I to let myself go even "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20906"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 3, 1918 (#10)"],[1,"and permit them to obtain  another employee.

[36] Many Negroes were returned to slavery by the Courts. An owner of  slaves in Mississippi brought them voluntarily into California before  the adoption of the Constitution by the State. The slaves asserted  their freedom and for some months were engaged in business for  themselves. The owner under the provision of the Fugitive Slave Act of  1852 brought them before the Justice of Peace, who allowed the claim  of the owners and ordered them into his custody. The slaves then  petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus which came before the Supreme.  Court and after hearing the case the Court ordered that the writ be  dismissed and the slaves remanded to their owners.--_California  Reports_, II, 424-426.    The case of Alvin Coffey is equally as interesting. This account was  given by a lifelong friend of the subject.    Alvin Coffey was born in 1822, in Saint Louis, Missouri. He came to  California with his sick master, a Mr. Duvall, who landed in San  Francisco, September 1, 1849. They went to Sacramento, October 13,  1849. During the next eight months the slave earned for his master  $5,000, working in the mines, and by washing for the miners and mining  for himself after night, he earned $700 of his own. As the master  continued in poor health he decided to return with Alvin to Missouri  at the expiration of two years. When they reached Kansas City,  Missouri, the master sold Alvin to Nelson Tindle, first taking from  him the $5,000, earned for the master, and also the $700 earned for  himself.    Nelson Tindle took a great liking to Alvin and in a short time made  him overseer over a number of slaves. Alvin, however, longed to return  to California and, in order to earn his freedom, bought his time from  his master and took contracts to build railroads. One day Nelson  Tindle said to Alvin that he was too smart a man to be a slave and  ought to try and purchase his freedom. Whereupon Alvin told him if he  would let him return to California, he could easily earn enough money  to effect the purchase. Alvin was permitted to return to California,  and in a short time sent his master the $1,500 to pay for his freedom.  Alvin then undertook to earn the money to pay for the freedom of his  wife and daughters, who were slaves of Doctor Bassett, of Missouri. He  earned the required sum and returned for his family. After paying for  their freedom, he went with them to Canada, where he left his  daughters to be educated. He and his wife Mahalia came to California.  It cost him for the freedom of himself and family together with the  trips to and from California about $7000. See Bancroft, \"_History of  California_,\" VI, p. 382.    [37] Some of these cases are more than interesting. Daniel Rodgers  came across the plains with his master from Little Rock, Arkansas,  worked in the mines in Sonora, California, during the day for his  master and at night for himself, earning and paying his master $1,100  for his freedom. Soon afterward the master returned with him to Little  Rock and sold him. A number of the leading white gentlemen of Little  Rock raised a sum of money, paid for his freedom and set him free.  William Pollock and wife from North Carolina came to California with  their master who located at Cold Springs, Coloma, California. He paid  $1,000 for himself and $800 for his wife. The money was earned by  washing for the miners at night and making doughnuts. They removed to  Placerville, California, and afterward earned their living as  caterers. In 1849, a slaveholder brought his slave to California. Not  wishing to take the Negro back to his native State, Alabama, he  concluded to sell him by auction. An advertisement was put in the  papers, the boy was purchased for $1,000, by Caleb T. Fay, a strong  abolitionist, who gave the boy his freedom.    A Mississippi slaveholder brought several slaves from that State and  promised to give them their freedom in two years. They all ran away  save one, Charles Bates, when they learned that they were already  free. The owner, finding mining did not pay, started east, taking  Charles with him. On the Isthmus of Panama, Charles was persuaded to  leave his master. He returned to California and to Stockton with his  true friend. On the street one day he was recognized by a party who  had lent money to Charles's master. The debtor got out an attachment  for the former slave as chattel property, and according to the State  law, the Negro was put up and sold at auction. A number of  anti-slavery men bought the boy for $750 and gave him his  freedom.--_California Reports_, I, 424-426.    [38] Bancroft, \"_History of California_,\" VI, p. 716.

DOCUMENTS      CALIFORNIA FREEDOM PAPERS[41]    To determine the sources of the Negroes first brought into California  their treatment by the whites and the methods employed to obtain their  freedom no documents are more valuable than the manumission papers  found in the archives of that State. These throw much light also on  the personal history of Negroes, many of whom later became useful  citizens of that State.           E. H.
