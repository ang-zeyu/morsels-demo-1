And one day, when the evening came, he grew drowsy, and fell  asleep; and his wife filled a bowl with milk, and placed it by his side,  and sat to watch him as he slept. Then a great serpent came out of his  hole to bite the youth. But his wife was watching, and she made the  servants give the milk to the serpent, and he drank till he could not  move. Then the Princess killed the serpent with blows of her dagger. So  she woke her husband, and he was astonished to see the serpent lying  dead, and his faithful wife said to him, \"Behold, God has given one of  thy dooms into thy hand; He will also give the others.\" And the Prince  made sacrifice to God, and praised Him.    Now, it fell on a day that the Prince went out to walk in his estate,  and his dog went with him. And as they walked, the dog ran after some  game, and the Prince followed the dog. They came to the River Nile, and  the dog went into the river, and the Prince followed him. Then a great  crocodile rose in the river, and laid hold on the youth, and said, \"I am  thy doom, following after thee.\" ...    But just here the old papyrus roll on which the story is written is torn  away, and we do not know what happened to the Doomed Prince. I fancy  that, in some way or other, his dog would save him from the crocodile,  and that later, by some accident, the poor faithful dog would be the  cause of his master's death. At least, it looks as if the end of the  story must have been something like that; for the Egyptians believed  that no one could escape from the doom that was laid upon him, but had  to suffer it sooner or later. Perhaps, some day, one of the explorers  who are searching the land of Egypt for relics of the past may come on  another papyrus roll with the end of the story, and then we shall find  out whether the dog did kill the Prince, or whether God gave all his  dooms into his hand, as his wife hoped.    These are some of the stories that little Tahuti and Sen-senb used to  listen to in the long evenings when they were tired of play. Perhaps  they seem very simple and clumsy to you; but I have no doubt that, when  they were told in those old days, the black eyes of the little Egyptian  boys and girls used to grow very big and round, and the wizard who could  fasten on heads which had been cut off seemed a very wonderful person,  and the talking serpents and crocodiles seemed very real and very  dreadful.    Anyhow, you have heard the oldest stories in all the world--the fathers  and mothers, so to speak, of all the great family of wonder-tales that  have delighted and terrified children ever since.          CHAPTER IX    EXPLORING THE SOUDAN      There is no more wonderful or interesting story than that which tells  how bit by bit the great dark continent of Africa has been explored, and  made to yield up its secrets. But did you ever think what a long story  it is, and how very early it begins? It is in Egypt that we find the  first chapters of the story; and they can still be read, written in the  quaint old picture writing which the Egyptians used, on the rock  tombs of a place in the south of Egypt, called Elephantine.    [Illustration: Plate 11  THE SPHINX AND THE SECOND PYRAMID. _Page_ 79]    In early days the land of Egypt used to end at what was called the First  Cataract of the Nile, a place where the river came down in a series of  rapids among a lot of rocky islets. The First Cataract has disappeared  now, for British engineers have made a great dam across the Nile just at  this point, and turned the whole country, for miles above the dam, into  a lake. But in those days the Egyptians used to believe that the Nile,  to which they owed so much, began at the First Cataract. Yet they knew  of the wild country of Nubia beyond and, in very early times indeed,  about 5,000 years ago, they used to send exploring expeditions into that  half-desert land which we have come to know as the Soudan.    Near the First Cataract there lies the island of Elephantine, and when  the Egyptian kingdom was young the great barons who owned this island  were the Lords of the Egyptian Marches, just as the Percies and the  Douglases were the Lords of the Marches in England and Scotland. It was  their duty to keep in order the wild Nubian tribes south of the  Cataract, to see that they allowed the trading caravans to pass safely,  and sometimes to lead these caravans through the desert themselves. A  caravan was a very different thing then from the long train of camels  that we think of now when we hear the name. For, though there are some  very old pictures which show that, before Egyptian history begins at  all, the camel was known in Egypt, somehow that useful animal seems to  have disappeared from the land for many hundreds of years. The Pharaohs  and their adventurous barons never used the queer, ungainly creature  that carries the desert postman in our picture (Plate 12), and the  ivory, gold-dust, and ebony that came from the Soudan had to be carried  on the backs of hundreds of asses.    The barons of Elephantine bore the proud title of \"Keepers of the Door  of the South,\" and, in addition, they display, seemingly just as  proudly, the title \"Caravan Conductors.\" In those days it was no easy  task to lead a caravan through the Soudan, and bring it back safe with  its precious load through all the wild and savage tribes who inhabited  the land of Nubia. More than one of the barons of Elephantine set out  with a caravan never to return, but to leave his bones, and those of his  companions, to whiten among the desert sands; and one of them has told  us how, hearing that his father had been killed on one of these  adventurous journeys, he mustered his retainers, marched south with a  train of a hundred asses, punished the tribe which had been guilty of  the deed, and brought his father's body home, to be buried with all due  honours.    Some of the records of these early journeys, the first attempts to  explore the interior of Africa, may still be read, carved on the walls  of the tombs where the brave explorers sleep. One baron, called Herkhuf,  has told us of no fewer than four separate expeditions which he made  into the Soudan. On his first journey, as he was still young, he went in  company with his father, and was away for seven months. The next time he  was allowed to go alone, and brought back his caravan safely after an  absence of eight months.    On his third journey he went farther than before, and gathered so large  a quantity of ivory and gold-dust that three hundred asses were required  to bring his treasure home. So rich a caravan was a tempting prize  for the wild tribes on the way; but Herkhuf persuaded one of the  Soudanese chiefs to furnish him with a large escort, and the caravan was  so strongly guarded that the other tribes did not venture to attack it,  but were glad to help its leader with guides and gifts of cattle.  Herkhuf brought his treasures safely back to Egypt, and the King was so  pleased with his success that he sent a special messenger with a boat  full of delicacies to refresh the weary traveller.    [Illustration: PLATE 12.  A DESERT POSTMAN.]    But the most successful of all his expeditions was the fourth. The King  who had sent him on the other journeys had died, and was succeeded by a  little boy called Pepy, who was only about six years old when he came to  the throne, and who reigned for more than ninety years--the longest  reign in the world's history. In the second year of Pepy's reign, the  bold Herkhuf set out again for the Soudan, and this time, along with  other treasures, he brought back something that his boy-King valued far  more than gold or ivory.    You know how, when Stanley went in search of Emin Pasha, he discovered  in the Central African forests a strange race of dwarfs, living by  themselves, and very shy of strangers. Well, for all these thousands of  years, the forefathers of these little dwarfs must have been living in  the heart of the Dark Continent. In early days they evidently lived not  so far away from Egypt as when Stanley found them, for, on at least one  occasion, one of Pharaoh's servants had been able to capture one of the  little men, and bring him down as a present to his master, greatly to  the delight of the King and Court. Herkhuf was equally fortunate. He  managed to secure a dwarf from one of these pigmy tribes, and brought  him back with his caravan, that he might please the young King with his  quaint antics and his curious dances.    When the King heard of the present which his brave servant was bringing  back for him, he was wild with delight. The thought of this new toy was  far more to the little eight-year-old, King though he was, than all the  rest of the treasure which Herkhuf had gathered; and he caused a letter  to be written to the explorer, telling him of his delight, and giving  him all kinds of advice as to how careful he should be that the dwarf  should come to no harm on the way to Court.    The letter, through all its curious old phrases, is very much the kind  of letter that any boy might send on hearing of some new toy that was  coming to him. \"My Majesty,\" says the little eight-year-old Pharaoh,  \"wisheth to see this pigmy more than all the tribute of Punt. And if  thou comest to Court having this pigmy with thee sound and whole, My  Majesty will do for thee more than King Assa did for the Chancellor  Baurded.\" (This was the man who had brought back the other dwarf in  earlier days.) Little King Pepy then gives careful directions that  Herkhuf is to provide proper people to see that the precious dwarf does  not fall into the Nile on his way down the river; and these guards are  to watch behind the place where he sleeps, and look into his bed ten  times each night, that they may be sure that nothing has gone wrong.

To the same effect is an    observation of Pliny: 'Scientiam feminarum in _veneficiis_    praevalere.'    According to the earlier Christian writers, the frailer sex is  addicted to infernal practices by reason of their innate  wickedness: and in the opinion of the 'old Fathers' they are  fitted by a corrupt disposition to be the recipients and agents  of the devil's will upon earth. The authors of the _Witch-Hammer_  have supported their assertions of the proneness of women to evil  in general, and to sorcery in particular, by the respectable  names and authority of St. Chrysostom, Augustin, Dionysius  Areopagiticus, Hilary, &c. &c.[42] The Golden-mouthed is adduced  as especially hostile in his judgment of the sex; and his 'Homily  on Herodias' takes its proper place with the satires of  Aristophanes and Juvenal, of Boccaccio and Boileau.[43]      [42]                               'They style a wife         The dear-bought curse and lawful plague of life,         A bosom-serpent and a domestic evil.'      [43] The royal author of the _Demonologie_ finds no    difficulty in accounting for the vastly larger proportion of    the female sex devoted to the devil's service. 'The reason    is easy,' he declares; 'for as that sex is frailer than man    is, so is it easier to be entrapped in the gross snares of    the devil, as was over-well proved to be true by the    serpent's deceiving of Eva at the beginning, which makes him    the homelier with that sex sensine:' and it is profoundly    observed that witches cannot even shed tears, though women    in general are, like the crocodile, ready to weep on every    light occasion.    Reginald Scot gives the reasons alleged by the apologists of  witchcraft. 'This gift and natural influence of fascination  may be increased in man according to his affections and  perturbations, as through anger, fear, love, hate, &c. For by  hate, saith Varius, entereth a fiery inflammation into the eye of  man, which being violently sent out by beams and streams infect  and bewitch those bodies against whom they are opposed. And  therefore (he saith) that is the cause that women are oftener  found to be witches than men. For they have such an unbridled  force of fury and concupiscence naturally, that by no means is it  possible for them to temper or moderate the same. So as upon  every trifling occasion they, like unto the beasts, fix their  furious eyes upon the party whom they bewitch.... Women also  (saith he) are oftenlie filled full of superfluous humours, and  with them the melancholike blood boileth, whereof spring vapours,  and are carried up and conveyed through the nostrils and mouth,  to the bewitching of whatsoever it meeteth. For they belch up a  certain breath wherewith they bewitch whomsoever they list. And  of all other women lean, hollow-eyed, old, beetle-browed women  (saith he) are the most infectious.'[44] Why _old_ women are  selected as the most proper means of doing the devil's will may  be discovered in their peculiar characteristics. The repulsive  features, moroseness, avarice, malice, garrulity of his hags are  said to be appropriate instruments. Scot informs us, 'One sort of  such as are said to be witches are women which be commonly old,  lame, blear-eyed, pale, foul, and full of wrinkles, poor, sullen,  superstitious, and _papists_, or such as know no religion, in  whose drowsy minds the devil hath got a fine seat. They are lean  and deformed, showing melancholy in their faces, to the horror of  all that see them. They are doting, scolds, mad, devilish ...  neither obtaining for their service and pains, nor yet by their  art, nor yet at the devil's hands, with whom they are said to  make a perfect visible bargain, either beauty, money, promotion,  wealth, worship, pleasure, honour, knowledge, or any other  benefit whatsoever.' As to the preternatural gifts of these hags,  he sensibly argues: 'Alas! what an unapt instrument is a  toothless, old, impotent, unwieldy woman to fly in the air;  truly, the devil little needs such instruments to bring his  purposes to pass.'[45]      [44] _Discoverie of Witchcraft_, book xii. 21.--We shall    have occasion hereafter to notice this great opponent of the    devil's regime in the sixteenth century. We may be inclined    to consider a more probable reason--that spirits, being in    the general belief (so Adam infers that God had 'peopled    highest heaven with spirits masculine') of the masculine    gender, the recipients of their inspiration are naturally of    the other sex: evil spirits could propagate their human or    half-human agents with least suspicion and in the most    natural way.      [45] _Discoverie_, i. 3, 6.--Old women, however, may be    negatively useful. One of the writers on the subject (John    Nider) recommends them to young men since '_Vetularum    aspectus et colloquia amorem excutiunt_.'    Dr. Glanvil, who wrote in the latter half of the seventeenth  century, and is bitterly opposed to the 'Witch-Advocate' and his  followers, defends the capabilities of hags and the like for  serving the demons. He conjectures, 'Peradventure 'tis one of  the great designs, as 'tis certainly the interest, of those  wicked agents and machinators industriously to hide from us their  influences and ways of acting, and to work as near as 'tis  possible _incognito_; upon which supposal it is easy to conceive  a reason why they most commonly work by and upon the weak and the  ignorant, who can make no cunning observations or tell credible  tales to detect their artifice.'[46] The act of bewitching is  defined to be 'a supernatural work contrived between a corporal  old woman and a spiritual devil' ('Discoverie,' vi. 2). The  method of initiation is, according to a writer on the subject, as  follows: A decrepit, superannuated, old woman is tempted by a man  in black to sign a contract to become his, both soul and body. On  the conclusion of the agreement (about which there was much  cheating and haggling), he gives her a piece of money, and causes  her to write her name and make her mark on a slip of parchment  with her own blood. Sometimes on this occasion also the witch  uses the ceremony of putting one hand to the sole of her foot and  the other to the crown of her head. On departing he delivers to  her an imp or familiar. The familiar, in shape of a cat, a mole,  miller-fly, or some other insect or animal, at stated times of  the day sucks her blood through teats in different parts of her  body.[47] If, however, the proper vulgar witch is an old woman,  the younger and fairer of the sex were not by any means exempt  from the crime. Young and beautiful women, children of tender  years, have been committed to the rack and to the stake on the  same accusation which condemned the old and the ugly.

Tremendous as was the power of the witch in earlier Christendom,  it was not yet degraded into the thoroughly diabolistic character  of her more recent successors. Diabolism advanced in the same  proportion with the authority of the Church and the ignorant  submission of the people. In the civil law, the Emperor Leo, in  the sixth century, abrogated the Constantinian edict as too  indulgent or too credulous: from that time all sorts of charms,  all use of them, beneficial or injurious, were declared worthy of  punishment. The different states of Europe, founded on the ruins  of the Western Empire, more or less were engaged in providing  against the evil consequences of sorcery. Charlemagne pursued the  criminals with great severity. He 'had several times given orders  that all necromancers, astrologers, and witches should be driven  from his states; but as the number of criminals augmented daily,  he found it necessary at last to resort to severer measures. In  consequence, he published several edicts, which may be found at  length in the \"Capitulaire de Baluse.\" By these every sort of  magic, enchantment, and witchcraft was forbidden, and the  punishment of death decreed against those who in any way evoked  the devil, compounded love-philters, afflicted either man or  woman with barrenness, troubled the atmosphere, excited tempests,  destroyed the fruits of the earth, dried up the milk of cows, or  tormented their fellow-creatures with sores and diseases. All  persons found guilty of exercising these execrable arts were to  be executed immediately upon conviction, that the earth might be  rid of the curse and burden of their presence; and those who  consulted them might also be punished with death.'[48]      [48] M. Garinet's _Histoire de la Magic en France_, quoted    in _Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions_.    The Saxons, in the fifth century, imported into Britain the pagan  forms of the Fatherland; and the Anglo-Saxon (Christian) laws are  usually directed against practices connected with heathen  worship, of which many reminiscences were long preserved. Their  Hexe, or witch,[49] appears to be half-divine, half-diabolic, a  witch-priestess who derived her inspiration as much from heavenly  as from hellish sources; from some divinity or genius presiding  at a sacred grove or fountain. King Athelstan is said to have  made a law against witchcraft and similar acts which inflict  death; that if one by them be made away, and the thing cannot be  denied, such practicers shall be put to death; but if they  endeavour to purge themselves, and be cast by the"]]]
