When the proclamation went abroad requiring all Hebrews to  be numbered at the cities of their birth-- That is my business  here, Rabbi.\"    Joseph's face remained stolid as a mask, while he remarked, \"I have  come for that also--I and my wife.\"    The stranger glanced at Mary and kept silence. She was looking  up at the bald top of Gedor. The sun touched her upturned  face, and filled the violet depths of her eyes, and upon her  parted lips trembled an aspiration which could not have been to  a mortal. For the moment, all the humanity of her beauty seemed  refined away: she was as we fancy they are who sit close by the  gate in the transfiguring light of Heaven. The Beth-Dagonite saw  the original of what, centuries after, came as a vision of genius  to Sanzio the divine, and left him immortal.    \"Of what was I speaking? Ah! I remember. I was about to say that  when I heard of the order to come here, I was angry. Then I thought  of the old hill, and the town, and the valley falling away into  the depths of Cedron; of the vines and orchards, and fields of  grain, unfailing since the days of Boaz and Ruth, of the familiar  mountains--Gedor here, Gibeah yonder, Mar Elias there--which, when  I was a boy, were the walls of the world to me; and I forgave the  tyrants and came--I, and Rachel, my wife, and Deborah and Michal,  our roses of Sharon.\"    The man paused again, looking abruptly at Mary, who was now looking  at him and listening. Then he said, \"Rabbi, will not your wife go  to mine? You may see her yonder with the children, under the leaning  olive-tree at the bend of the road. I tell you\"--he turned to Joseph  and spoke positively--\"I tell you the khan is full. It is useless to  ask at the gate.\"    Joseph's will was slow, like his mind; he hesitated, but at length  replied, \"The offer is kind. Whether there be room for us or not  in the house, we will go see your people. Let me speak to the  gate-keeper myself. I will return quickly.\"    And, putting the leading-strap in the stranger's hand, he pushed  into the stirring crowd.    The keeper sat on a great cedar block outside the gate. Against the  wall behind him leaned a javelin. A dog squatted on the block by  his side.    \"The peace of Jehovah be with you,\" said Joseph, at last confronting  the keeper.    \"What you give, may you find again; and, when found, be it many  times multiplied to you and yours,\" returned the watchman, gravely,  though without moving.    \"I am a Bethlehemite,\" said Joseph, in his most deliberate way.  \"Is there not room for--\"    \"There is not.\"    \"You may have heard of me--Joseph of Nazareth. This is the house  of my fathers. I am of the line of David.\"    These words held the Nazarene's hope. If they failed him, further  appeal was idle, even that of the offer of many shekels. To be a  son of Judah was one thing--in the tribal opinion a great thing;  to be of the house of David was yet another; on the tongue of a  Hebrew there could be no higher boast. A thousand years and more  had passed since the boyish shepherd became the successor of Saul  and founded a royal family. Wars, calamities, other kings, and the  countless obscuring processes of time had, as respects fortune,  lowered his descendants to the common Jewish level; the bread  they ate came to them of toil never more humble; yet they had  the benefit of history sacredly kept, of which genealogy was the  first chapter and the last; they could not become unknown, while,  wherever they went In Israel, acquaintance drew after it a respect  amounting to reverence.    If this were so in Jerusalem and elsewhere, certainly one of the  sacred line might reasonably rely upon it at the door of the khan of  Bethlehem. To say, as Joseph said, \"This is the house of my fathers,\"  was to say the truth most simply and literally; for it was the very  house Ruth ruled as the wife of Boaz, the very house in which Jesse  and his ten sons, David the youngest, were born, the very house in  which Samuel came seeking a king, and found him; the very house  which David gave to the son of Barzillai, the friendly Gileadite;  the very house in which Jeremiah, by prayer, rescued the remnant  of his race flying before the Babylonians.    The appeal was not without effect. The keeper of the gate slid  down from the cedar block, and, laying his hand upon his beard,  said, respectfully, \"Rabbi, I cannot tell you when this door first  opened in welcome to the traveller, but it was more than a thousand  years ago; and in all that time there is no known instance of a good  man turned away, save when there was no room to rest him in. If it  has been so with the stranger, just cause must the steward have who  says no to one of the line of David. Wherefore, I salute you again;  and, if you care to go with me, I will show you that there is not  a lodging-place left in the house; neither in the chambers, nor in  the lewens, nor in the court--not even on the roof. May I ask when  you came?\"    \"But now.\"    The keeper smiled.    \"'The stranger that dwelleth with you shall be as one born among  you, and thou shalt love him as thyself.' Is not that the law,  Rabbi?\"    Joseph was silent.    \"If it be the law, can I say to one a long time come, 'Go thy way;  another is here to take thy place?'\"    Yet Joseph held his peace.    \"And, if I said so, to whom would the place belong? See the many  that have been waiting, some of them since noon.\"    \"Who are all these people?\" asked Joseph, turning to the crowd.  \"And why are they here at this time?\"    \"That which doubtless brought you, Rabbi--the decree of the  Caesar\"--the keeper threw an interrogative glance at the Nazarene,  then continued--\"brought most of those who have lodging in the house.  And yesterday the caravan passing from Damascus to Arabia and Lower  Egypt arrived. These you see here belong to it--men and camels.\"    Still Joseph persisted.    \"The court is large,\" he said.    \"Yes, but it is heaped with cargoes--with bales of silk, and pockets  of spices, and goods of every kind.\"    Then for a moment the face of the applicant lost its stolidity;  the lustreless, staring eyes dropped. With some warmth he next said,  \"I do not care for myself, but I have with me my wife, and the night  is cold--colder on these heights than in Nazareth. She cannot live  in the open air. Is there not room in the town?\"    \"These people\"--the keeper waved his hand to the throng before the  door--\"have all besought the town, and they report its accommodations  all engaged.\"    Again Joseph studied the ground, saying, half to himself, \"She is  so young! if I make her bed on the hill, the frosts will kill her.\"    Then he spoke to the keeper again.    \"It may be you knew her parents, Joachim and Anna, once of Bethlehem,  and, like myself, of the line of David.\"    \"Yes, I knew them. They were good people. That was in my youth.\"    This time the keeper's eyes sought the ground in thought. Suddenly he  raised his head.    \"If I cannot make room for you,\" he said, \"I cannot turn you away.  Rabbi, I will do the best I can for you. How many are of your party?\"    Joseph reflected, then replied, \"My wife and a friend with his  family, from Beth-Dagon, a little town over by Joppa; in all,  six of us.\"    \"Very well. You shall not lie out on the ridge. Bring your people,  and hasten; for, when the sun goes down behind the mountain, you know  the night comes quickly, and it is nearly there now.\"    \"I give you the blessing of the houseless traveller; that of the  sojourner will follow.\"    So saying, the Nazarene went back joyfully to Mary and the  Beth-Dagonite. In a little while the latter brought up his  family, the women mounted on donkeys. The wife was matronly,  the daughters were images of what she must have been in youth;  and as they drew nigh the door, the keeper knew them to be of  the humble class.    \"This is she of whom I spoke,\" said the Nazarene; \"and these are  our friends.\"    Mary's veil was raised.    \"Blue eyes and hair of gold,\" muttered the steward to himself,  seeing but her. \"So looked the young king when he went to sing  before Saul.\"    Then he took the leading-strap from Joseph, and said to Mary,  \"Peace to you, O daughter of David!\" Then to the others, \"Peace to  you all!\" Then to Joseph, \"Rabbi, follow me.\"    The party were conducted into a wide passage paved with stone,  from which they entered the court of the khan. To a stranger the  scene would have been curious; but they noticed the lewens that  yawned darkly upon them from all sides, and the court itself,  only to remark how crowded they were. By a lane reserved in the  stowage of the cargoes, and thence by a passage similar to the  one at the entrance, they emerged into the enclosure adjoining  the house, and came upon camels, horses, and donkeys, tethered  and dozing in close groups; among them were the keepers, men of  many lands; and they, too, slept or kept silent watch. They went  down the slope of the crowded yard slowly, for the dull carriers  of the women had wills of their own. At length they turned into  a path running towards the gray limestone bluff overlooking the  khan on the west.    \"We are going to the cave,\" said Joseph, laconically.    The guide lingered till Mary came to his side.    \"The cave to which we are going,\" he said to her, \"must have been  a resort of your ancestor David. From the field below us, and from  the well down in the valley, he used to drive his flocks to it for  safety; and afterwards, when he was king, he came back to the old  house here for rest and health, bringing great trains of animals.  The mangers yet remain as they were in his day. Better a bed on  the floor where he has slept than one in the court-yard or out by  the roadside. Ah, here is the house before the cave!\"    This speech must not be taken as an apology for the lodging offered.  There was no need of apology. The place was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/215"],[0,"The Call of the Wild (#10)"],[1,"why  such as they should adventure the North is part of the mystery of things  that passes understanding.    Buck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the  Government agent, and knew that the Scotch half-breed and the mail-train  drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of Perrault and  Francois and the others who had gone before. When driven with his mates  to the new owners' camp, Buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair, tent  half stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in disorder; also, he saw a  woman. \"Mercedes\" the men called her. She was Charles's wife and Hal's  sister--a nice family party.    Buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent  and load the sled. There was a great deal of effort about their manner,  but no businesslike method. The tent was rolled into an awkward bundle  three times as large as it should have been. The tin dishes were packed  away unwashed. Mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her men and  kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice. When they put  a clothes-sack on the front of the sled, she suggested it should go on  the back; and when they had put it on the back, and covered it over  with a couple of other bundles, she discovered overlooked articles which  could abide nowhere else but in that very sack, and they unloaded again.    Three men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on, grinning and  winking at one another.    \"You've got a right smart load as it is,\" said one of them; \"and it's  not me should tell you your business, but I wouldn't tote that tent  along if I was you.\"    \"Undreamed of!\" cried Mercedes, throwing up her hands in dainty dismay.  \"However in the world could I manage without a tent?\"    \"It's springtime, and you won't get any more cold weather,\" the man  replied.    She shook her head decidedly, and Charles and Hal put the last odds and  ends on top the mountainous load.    \"Think it'll ride?\" one of the men asked.    \"Why shouldn't it?\" Charles demanded rather shortly.    \"Oh, that's all right, that's all right,\" the man hastened meekly to  say. \"I was just a-wonderin', that is all. It seemed a mite top-heavy.\"    Charles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could,  which was not in the least well.    \"An' of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption  behind them,\" affirmed a second of the men.    \"Certainly,\" said Hal, with freezing politeness, taking hold of the  gee-pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other. \"Mush!\" he  shouted. \"Mush on there!\"    The dogs sprang against the breast-bands, strained hard for a few  moments, then relaxed. They were unable to move the sled.    \"The lazy brutes, I'll show them,\" he cried, preparing to lash out at  them with the whip.    But Mercedes interfered, crying, \"Oh, Hal, you mustn't,\" as she caught  hold of the whip and wrenched it from him. \"The poor dears! Now you  must promise you won't be harsh with them for the rest of the trip, or I  won't go a step.\"    \"Precious lot you know about dogs,\" her brother sneered; \"and I wish  you'd leave me alone. They're lazy, I tell you, and you've got to whip  them to get anything out of them. That's their way. You ask any one. Ask  one of those men.\"    Mercedes looked at them imploringly, untold repugnance at sight of pain  written in her pretty face.    \"They're weak as water, if you want to know,\" came the reply from one  of the men. \"Plum tuckered out, that's what's the matter. They need a  rest.\"    \"Rest be blanked,\" said Hal, with his beardless lips; and Mercedes said,  \"Oh!\" in pain and sorrow at the oath.    But she was a clannish creature, and rushed at once to the defence of  her brother. \"Never mind that man,\" she said pointedly. \"You're driving  our dogs, and you do what you think best with them.\"    Again Hal's whip fell upon the dogs. They threw themselves against the  breast-bands, dug their feet into the packed snow, got down low to it,  and put forth all their strength. The sled held as though it were an  anchor. After two efforts, they stood still, panting. The whip was  whistling savagely, when once more Mercedes interfered. She dropped on  her knees before Buck, with tears in her eyes, and put her arms around  his neck.    \"You poor, poor dears,\" she cried sympathetically, \"why don't you pull  hard?--then you wouldn't be whipped.\" Buck did not like her, but he  was feeling too miserable to resist her, taking it as part of the day's  miserable work.    One of the onlookers, who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot  speech, now spoke up:--    \"It's not that I care a whoop what becomes of you, but for the dogs'  sakes I just want to tell you, you can help them a mighty lot by  breaking out that sled. The runners are froze fast. Throw your weight  against the gee-pole, right and left, and break it out.\"    A third time the attempt was made, but this time, following the advice,  Hal broke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow. The  overloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead, Buck and his mates struggling  frantically under the rain of blows. A hundred yards ahead the path  turned and sloped steeply into the main street. It would have required  an experienced man to keep the top-heavy sled upright, and Hal was not  such a man. As they swung on the turn the sled went over, spilling  half its load through the loose lashings. The dogs never stopped. The  lightened sled bounded on its side behind them. They were angry because  of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust load. Buck was  raging. He broke into a run, the team following his lead. Hal cried  \"Whoa! whoa!\" but they gave no heed. He tripped and was pulled off his  feet. The capsized sled ground over him, and the dogs dashed on up the  street, adding to the gayety of Skaguay as they scattered the remainder  of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare.    Kind-hearted citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered  belongings. Also, they gave advice. Half the load and twice the dogs,  if they ever expected to reach Dawson, was what was said. Hal and  his sister and brother-in-law listened unwillingly, pitched tent, and  overhauled the outfit. Canned goods were turned out that made men laugh,  for canned goods on the Long Trail is a thing to dream about. \"Blankets  for a hotel\" quoth one of the men who laughed and helped. \"Half as  many is too much; get rid of them. Throw away that tent, and all those  dishes,--who's going to wash them, anyway? Good Lord, do you think  you're travelling on a Pullman?\"    And so it went, the inexorable elimination of the superfluous. Mercedes  cried when her clothes-bags were dumped on the ground and article  after article was thrown out. She cried in general, and she cried in  particular over each discarded thing. She clasped hands about knees,  rocking back and forth broken-heartedly. She averred she would not go  an inch, not for a dozen Charleses. She appealed to everybody and to  everything, finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even  articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries. And in her zeal,  when she had finished with her own, she attacked the belongings of her  men and went through them like a tornado.    This accomplished, the outfit, though cut in half, was still a  formidable bulk. Charles and Hal went out in the evening and bought six  Outside dogs. These, added to the six of the original team, and Teek  and Koona, the huskies obtained at the Rink Rapids on the record  trip, brought the team up to fourteen. But the Outside dogs, though  practically broken in since their landing, did not amount to much. Three  were short-haired pointers, one was a Newfoundland, and the other  two were mongrels of indeterminate breed. They did not seem to know  anything, these newcomers. Buck and his comrades looked upon them with  disgust, and though he speedily taught them their places and what not  to do, he could not teach them what to do. They did not take kindly  to trace and trail. With the exception of the two mongrels, they were  bewildered and spirit-broken by the strange savage environment in which  they found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received. The  two mongrels were without spirit at all; bones were the only things  breakable about them.    With the newcomers hopeless and forlorn, and the old team worn out by  twenty-five hundred miles of continuous trail, the outlook was anything  but bright. The two men, however, were quite cheerful. And they were  proud, too. They were doing the thing in style, with fourteen dogs. They  had seen other sleds depart over the Pass for Dawson, or come in from  Dawson, but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen dogs. In  the nature of Arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen dogs should  not drag one sled, and that was that one sled could not carry the food  for fourteen dogs. But Charles and Hal did not know this. They had  worked the trip out with a pencil, so much to a dog, so many dogs,  so many days, Q.E.D. Mercedes looked over their shoulders and nodded  comprehensively, it was all so very simple.    Late next morning Buck led the long team up the street. There was  nothing lively about it, no snap or go in him and his fellows. They were  starting dead weary. Four times he had covered the distance between Salt  Water and Dawson, and the knowledge that, jaded and tired, he was facing  the same trail once more, made him bitter. His heart was not in  the work, nor was the heart of any dog. The Outsides were timid and  frightened, the Insides without confidence in their masters.    Buck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and the  woman. They did not know how to do anything, and as the days went by  it became apparent that they could not learn. They were slack in all  things, without order or discipline. It took them half the night to  pitch a slovenly camp, and"]]]
