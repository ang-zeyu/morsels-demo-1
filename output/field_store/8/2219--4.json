When they have absorbed the sauce, complete the cooking with  broth or, failing that, with water.      110    STUFFED TOMATOES    (Pomodori ripieni)    Select ripe middle-sized tomatoes, cut them in two equal parts and scoop  out the inside seeds. Season with salt and pepper and fill the tomatoes  with the following hash, in such a way as to make the stuffing come over  the edge of the half tomato:    Make a hash with onion, parsley and celery, put it on the fire with a  piece of butter and when it is browned, put in a small handful of dried  mushrooms previously softened in water and chopped very fine: add a  tablespoonful of bread crumbs soaked in milk, season with salt and  pepper and let the compound simmer, moistening with water if necessary.  When you take from the fire add, when it is still lukewarm, grated  cheese and a beaten yolk (or two) of egg, but seeing that the compound  does not become too liquid.    When the tomatoes are filled, take them in the oven with a little butter  and oil mixed together and serve them as a side-dish for roast beef or  steak.    The stuffed tomatoes can be made simpler with a hash of garlic and  parsley mixed with bread crumbs, salt and pepper and seasoned with oil  when they are in the saucepan.      111    CAULIFLOWER WITH BALSAMELLA    (Cavolfiore colla balsamella)    Remove from a good sized cauliflower the external leaves and the green  ribs, make a deep cut crosswise in the stalk and cook it in salted  water. Then cut it in sections and brown with butter, salt and pepper.  Put it in a baking tin, throw over a small pinch of grated cheese, cover  with the =balsamella= (No. 54) and brown the surface.    Serve this cauliflower as an =entremets= or as a side-dish with boiled  chicken or a stew.      112    STUFFED CABBAGE    (Cavolo ripieno)    Take a big cabbage, remove the hard outside leaves, cut the stem off  even with the leaves and give it half cooking in salt water. Put it  upside down to drain, then open the leaves one by one until the heart is  exposed and on this put the stuffing. Bring up all the leaves, close  them and tie with thread crosswise.    The stuffing can be made with milk veal stewed alone, or with sweetbread  or chicken liver, all chopped fine. To make it more delicate, add some  =balsamella= (No 54) a pinch of grated cheese, one yolk of egg and a  taste of nutmeg. Complete the cooking of the cabbage in the sauce of  this stew, adding a little butter, on a low fire or in the oven kept  low.    Instead of filling the whole cabbage, the larger leaves may be filled  one by one, rolling and tying them.      113    SIDE-DISH OF SPINACH    (Spinaci per contorno)    After cooking the spinach in boiling water and chopping them fine, the  spinach can be cooked in different ways:    1. With butter, salt and pepper, adding a little brown stock, if you  have it, or a few tablespoonfuls of broth, or milk.    2. With onion sauce (onion chopped very fine) and butter.    3. With butter salt and pepper, adding a very small pinch of grated  cheese.    4. With butter, a drop of olive oil and tomato sauce (No. 12) or tomato  paste diluted with soup stock or water.      114    ASPARAGUS    (Sparagi)    Asparagus can be prepared in many different ways, but the simplest and  best is that of boiling them and serving them seasoned with olive oil  and vinegar or lemon juice. However there are other ways as, for  instance, the following: Put them whole to brown a little with the green  part in butter and, after seasoning them with salt, pepper and a pinch  of grated cheese, pour over the melted butter when it is browned. Or  else divide the white from the green part and place them as follows in a  fireproof plate: Dust the bottom with grated cheese and dispose over the  points of the asparagus one near the other; season with salt, pepper,  grated cheese and little pieces of butter. Make another layer of  asparagus and, seasoning in the same way, continue until you have them.  Be moderate in the seasoning. Cross the layers of asparagus like a  trestle, put on the oven and keep until the seasoning, is melted. Serve  hot.    If you have some brown stock, parboil them first and complete the  cooking with brown stock, adding a little bust and dusting moderately  with grated cheese.      115    FISH WITH BREAD CRUMBS    (Pesce col pane grattato)    This, which can also be served as a side-dish, is made especially when  you have boiled fish of good quality left over.    Cut it into little pieces, remove carefully all the bones, then put it  in the =balsamella= (No. 54) and season with enough salt, grated cheese  and some mushrooms chopped fine. If dried mushrooms soften in water  first. Then take a fireproof plate, grease it evenly with butter and  dust with bread crumbs ground fine; pour into it the fish prepared as  above and cover with a thin layer of bread crumbs. Finally put over a  piece of butter, brown in the oven and serve hot.      116    STEWED FISH CUTLETS    (Pesce a taglio in umido)    The fish that can be used for this dish are the tunny, the umber or  grayling, the sword fish and any piece of fish of large size and good  savor. A pound may be sufficient for four or five persons.    Remove the scales, clean and dry well, dip in flour and put to brown in  a little oil. Remove dry, throw away the oil that remains and clean the  saucepan. Make a hash, chopped very fine, with half a middle sized  onion, a piece of white celery and a good pinch of parsley. Put this to  brown on the fire with sufficient oil and season with salt, pepper and  one whole clove. When it is browned put abundant tomato sauce (No 12) or  tomato paste diluted in broth or water. Let it simmer for a while, then  place the fish to complete the cooking, turning it over frequently. The  fish must be served with this thick gravy that ought to be abundant.      117    WHITING WITH ANCHOVY SAUCE    (Merluzzo alla Palermitana)    Take one whiting, one pound or a little more, and trim all the fins,  leaving the tail and the head. Split it to remove the bone, and season  with a little salt and pepper. Turn it on the back, grease with oil,  season with salt and pepper, dust with bread crumbs then lay it with two  tablespoonfuls of oil on a fireproof plate or baking tin.    Take three or four good sized anchovies, bone and clean them, chop them  and put on the fire with two tablespoonfuls of oil, but do not allow it  to boil. With this sauce cover the back of the fish and dust it all with  bread crumbs, putting also some leaves of rosemary. Bake in the oven,  allowing a little crust to form over, but see that it doesn't dry up,  pouring over to this purpose more oil. Before removing from the tin  squeeze half a lemon over.    This dish can be served surrounded by little toast with caviar, or  anchovies and butter.      118    STEWED EEL    (Anguille in umido)    For this dish it is preferable to have good sized eels that must not be  skinned, but cut in small pieces.    Chop some onion and parsley, put it on the fire with oil, salt, and  pepper, and when the onion is browned, add the pieces of eel. Wait until  it has absorbed the taste of the onion sauce and then complete the  cooking with tomato sauce (No. 12).    See that there is plenty of gravy and serve with little squares or  diamonds of toast.      119    EELS WITH PEAS    (Anguille coi piselli)    Cook the eels as above with the onion sauce and when it is cooked remove  it dry to cook the green peas in the sauce. The pieces of eel should be  put back in the sauce to be warmed. No tomato sauce is necessary here.      120    MUSSELS WITH EGG SAUCE    (Arselle in salsa d'uovo)    A good washing with fresh water is sufficient for mussels that do not  have any sand to be cleaned away. Put them on the fire with a sauce of  oil, garlic, parsley and a pinch of pepper. Shake them and keep the  saucepan covered seeing that they do not absorb all of the sauce. Take  them out when they are open and prepare the following sauce: one or more  yolks of egg, according to the quantity, lemon juice, one teaspoonful of  flour, broth and some of their own juice. Cook this sauce until it  becomes a smooth cream and pour it on the mussels when they are served.      121    MUSSELS WITH TOMATO SAUCE    (Arselle alla livornese)    Chop fine half an onion and put it on the fire with oil and a pinch of  pepper. When the onion begins to brown add a pinch of parsley chopped  not very fine and after put in the mussels with tomato sauce (No. 12)  or tomato paste diluted in water. Shake them often and when they are  open, put them over slices of toast prepared beforehand and arranged on  a plate.      122    CODFISH    (Baccala)    I    Freshen and soak the codfish in cold water, changing the water two or  three times, or, better, keeping it for some time in a vase under  running cold water. Then cut it into pieces as large as the palm of the  hand and dip them in flour until they are well covered. Then put a  kettle or a saucepan on the fire with plenty of oil and two or three  cloves of garlic, whole but a little crushed. When the garlic begins to  brown put in the codfish and brown it on both sides, stirring it often,  so that it doesn't burn. Salt is not necessary, or at least only a  little after tasting, but a little pepper will not be amiss. Finally  pour over some tomato sauce (No. 12) or tomato paste diluted in water,  let it boil a little more and serve.      123    II    The following is another way to prepare the codfish, slightly different  from the preceding. Cut the codfish as above, then put it as it is in  saucepan with some olive oil. Spread over it a hash of garlic and  parsley and season with a pinch of pepper, oil and little pieces of  butter.

Besides these two  rare volumes there are sixteen folio volumes of drawings by Abbot in the  Library of the British Museum. This work is of especial interest to the  American student as it illustrates the early stages of many of our  butterflies and moths.    Indeed the study of insects possesses most of its interest when we  observe their habits and transformations. Caterpillars are always to be  found, and with a little practice are easy to raise; we would therefore  advise any one desirous of beginning the study of insects to take up the  butterflies and moths. They are perhaps easier to study than any other  group of insects, and are more ornamental in the cabinet. As a  scientific study we would recommend it to ladies as next to botany in  interest and in the ease in which specimens may be collected and  examined. The example of Madam Merian, and several ladies in this  country who have greatly aided science by their well filled cabinets,  and critical knowledge of the various species and their transformations,  is an earnest of what may be expected from their followers. Though the  moths are easy to study compared with the bees, flies, beetles and bugs,  and dragon flies, yet many questions of great interest in philosophical  entomology have been answered by our knowledge of their structure and  mode of growth. The great works of Herold on the evolution of a  caterpillar; of Lyonet on the anatomy of the Cossus; of Newport on that  of the Sphinx; and of Siebold on the parthenogenesis of insects, are  proofs that the moths have engaged the attention of some of the master  minds in science.    The study of the transformations of the moths is also of great  importance to one who would acquaint himself with the questions  concerning the growth and metamorphoses and origin of animals. We should  remember that the very words \"metamorphosis\" and \"transformation,\" now  so generally applied to other groups of animals and used in  philosophical botany, were first suggested by those who observed that  the moth and butterfly attain their maturity only by passing through  wonderful changes of form and modes of life.    The knowledge of the fact that all animals pass through some sort of a  metamorphosis is very recent in physiology. Moreover the fact that these  morphological eras in the life of an individual animal accord most  unerringly with the gradation of forms in the type of which it is a  member, was the discovery of the eminent physiologist Von Baer. Up to  this time the true significance of the luxuriance and diversity of  larval forms had never seriously engaged the attention of systematists  in entomology.    What can possibly be the meaning of all this putting on and taking off  of caterpillar habiliments, or in other words, the process of moulting,  with the frequent changes in ornamentation, and the seeming  fastidiousness and queer fancies and strange conceits of these young and  giddy insects seems hidden and mysterious to human observation. Indeed,  few care to spend the time and trouble necessary to observe the insect  through its transformations; and that done, if only the larva of the  perfect insect can be identified and its form sketched how much was  gained! A truthful and circumstantial biography, in all its relations,  of a single insect has yet to be written!    We should also apply our knowledge of the larval forms of insects to the  details of their classification into families and genera, constantly  collating our knowledge of the early stages with the structural  relations that accompany them in the perfect state.    The simple form of the caterpillar seems to be a concentration of the  characters of the perfect insect, and presents easy characters by which  to distinguish the minor groups; and the relative rank of the higher  divisions will only be definitely settled when their forms and methods  of transformation are thoroughly known. Thus, for example, in two groups  of the large Attacus-like moths, which are so amply illustrated in Dr.  Harris's \"Treatise on Insects injurious to Vegetation\"; if we take the  different forms of the caterpillars of the Tau moth of Europe, which are  figured by Duponchel and Godard, we find that the very young larva has  four horn-like processes on the front, and four on the back part of the  body. The full grown larva of the Regalis moth, of the Southern and  Middle states, is very similarly ornamented. It is an embryonic form,  and therefore inferior in rank to the Tau moth. Multiply these horns  over the surface of the body, lessen their size, and crown them with  hairs, and we have our Io moth, so destructive to corn. Now take off the  hairs, elongating and thinning out the tubercles, and make up the loss  by the increased size of the worm, and we have the caterpillar of our  common Cecropia moth. Again, remove the naked tubercles almost wholly,  smooth off the surface of the body, and contract its length, thus giving  a greater convexity and angularity to the rings, and we have before us  the larva of the stately Luna moth that tops this royal family. Here are  certain criteria for placing these insects before our minds in the order  that nature has placed them. We have certain facts for determining which  of these three insects is highest and which lowest in the scale, when we  see the larva of the Luna moth throwing off successively the Io and  Cecropia forms to take on its own higher features. So that there is a  meaning in all this shifting of insect toggery.    This is but an example of the many ways in which both pleasure and  mental profit may be realized from the thoughtful study of caterpillar  life.    In collecting butterflies and moths for cabinet specimens, one needs a  gauze net a foot and a half deep, with the wire frame a foot in  diameter; a wide-mouthed bottle containing a parcel of cyanide of  potassium gummed on the side, in which to kill the moths, which should,  as soon as life is extinct, be pinned in a cork-lined collecting box  carried in the coat pocket. The captures should then be spread and dried  on a grooved setting board, and a cabinet formed of cork-lined boxes or  drawers; as a substitute for cork, frames with paper tightly stretched  over them may be used, or the pith of corn-stalks or palm wood.  Caterpillars should be preserved in spirits, or in glycerine with a  little alcohol added.    Some persons ingeniously empty the skins and inflate them over a flame  so that they may be pinned by the side of the adult.    Some of the most troublesome and noxious insects are found among the  moths. I need only mention the canker worm and American tent  caterpillar, and the various kinds of cut worms, as instances.    [Illustration: 43. Parasite of the American Silk Worm.]    We must not, however, forget the good done by insects. They undoubtedly  tend by their attacks to prevent an undue growth of vegetation. The  pruning done to a tree or herb by certain insects undoubtedly causes a  more healthy growth of the branches and leaves, and ultimately a greater  production fruit. Again, as pollen-bearers, insects are a most powerful  agency in nature. It is undoubtedly the fact that the presence, of bees  in orchards increases the fruit crop, and thus the thousands of moths  (though injurious as caterpillars), wild bees and other insects, that  seem to live without purpose, are really, though few realize it, among  the best friends and allies of man.    Moreover, insects are of great use as scavengers; such are the young or  maggots of the house fly, the mosquitoes, and numerous other forms, that  seem created only to vex us when in the winged state. Still a larger  proportion of insects are directly beneficial from their habit of  attacking injurious species, such as the ichneumons (Fig. 43, the  ichneumon of the American silk worm) and certain flies (Fig. 44,  Tachina); also many carnivorous species of wasps beetles and flies,  dragon flies and Aphis lions (Fig. 45, the lace-winged fly; adult, larva  and eggs).    [Illustration: 44. Tachina, parasite of Colorado Potato Beetle.]    [Illustration: 45. The Lace-winged Fly, Its Larva and Eggs.]    But few, however, suspect how enormous are the losses to crops in this  country entailed by the attacks of the injurious species. In Europe, the  subject of applied entomology has always attracted a great deal of  attention. Most sumptuous works, elegant quartos prepared by naturalists  known the world over, and published at government expense, together with  smaller treatises, have frequently appeared; while the subject is taught  in the numerous agricultural colleges and schools, especially of  Germany.    In the densely populated countries of Europe, the losses occasioned by  injurious insects are most severely felt, though from many causes, such  as the greater abundance of their insect parasites, and the far greater  care taken by the people to exterminate their insect enemies, they have  not proved so destructive as in our own land.    In this connection I may quote from one of Dr. Asa Fitch's reports on  the noxious insects of New York, where he says: \"I find that in our  wheat-fields here, the midge formed 59 per cent. of all the insects on  this grain the past summer; whilst in France, the preceding summer, only  7 per cent. of the insects on wheat were of this species. In France the  parasitic destroyers amounted to 85 per cent.; while in this country our  parasites form only 10 per cent.\"    \"A true knowledge of practical entomology may well be said to be in its  infancy in our own country, when, as is well-known to agriculturists,  the cultivation of wheat has almost been given up in New England, New  York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia, from the attacks of the wheat  midge, Hessian fly, joint worm, and chinch bug.
