Food calculated to stimulate  the greatest flow of milk will naturally increase these veins, and give  them more than usual prominence.      THE MILK-MIRROR.    The discovery of M. Guenon, of Bordeaux, in France--a man of remarkable  practical sagacity, and a close observer of stock--consisted in the  connection between the milking qualities of the cow and certain external  marks on the udder, and on the space above it, called the perineum,  extending to the buttocks. To these marks he gave the name of  milk-mirror, or escutcheon, which consists in certain perceptible spots  rising up from the udder in different directions, forms and sizes, on  which the hair grows upward, whilst the hair on other parts of the body  grows downward. The reduction of these marks into a system, explaining  the value of particular forms and sizes of the milk-mirror, belongs  exclusively to Guenon.    [Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [A.]]    He divided the milk-mirror into eight classes, and each class into eight  orders, making in all no less than sixty-four divisions, which he  afterward increased by subdivisions, thus rendering the whole system  complicated in the extreme, especially as he professed to be able to  judge with accuracy, by means of the milk-mirror, not only of the exact  quantity a cow would give, but also of the quality of the milk, and of  the length of time it would continue. He endeavored to prove too much,  and was, as a matter of consequence, frequently at fault himself.    Despite the strictures which have been passed upon Guenon's method of  judging of cows, the best breeders and judges of stock concur in the  opinion, as the result of their observations, that cows with the most  perfectly developed milk-mirrors are, with rare exception, the best  milkers of their breed; and that cows with small and slightly developed  milk-mirrors are, in the majority of cases, bad milkers. There are,  undoubtedly, cows with very small mirrors, which are, nevertheless,  very fair in the yield of milk; and among those with middling quality of  mirrors, instances of rather more than ordinary milkers often occur,  while at the same time it is true that cases now and then are found  where the very best marked and developed mirrors are found on very poor  milkers. These apparent exceptions, however, are to be explained, in the  large majority of cases, by causes outside of those which affect the  appearance of the milk-mirror. It is, of course, impossible to estimate  with mathematical accuracy either the quantity, quality, or duration of  the milk, since it is affected by so many chance circumstances, which  cannot always be known or estimated by even the most skillful judges;  such, for example, as the food, the treatment, the temperament,  accidental diseases, inflammation of the udder, premature calving, the  climate and season, the manner in which she has been milked, and a  thousand other things which interrupt or influence the flow of milk,  without materially changing the size or shape of the milk-mirror. It  has, indeed, been very justly observed that we often see cows equally  well formed, with precisely the same milk-mirror, and kept in the same  circumstances, yet giving neither equal quantities nor similar qualities  of milk. Nor could it be otherwise; since the action of the organs  depends, not merely on their size and form, but, to a great extent, on  the general condition of each individual.    [Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [B.]]    [Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [C.]]    The different forms of milk-mirrors are represented by the shaded parts  of cuts, lettered A, B, C, D; but it is necessary to premise that upon  the cows themselves they are always partly concealed by the thighs, the  udder, and the folds of the skin, which are not shown, and therefore  they are not always so uniform in nature as they appear in the cuts.    [Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [D.]]    Their size varies as the skin is more or less folded or stretched; while  the cuts represent the skin as uniform or free from folds, but not  stretched out. It is usually very easy to distinguish the milk-mirrors  by the upward direction of the hair which forms them. They are sometimes  marked by a line of bristly hair growing in the opposite direction,  which surrounds them, forming a sort of outline by the upward and  downward growing hair. Yet, when the hair is very fine and short, mixed  with longer hairs, and the skin much folded, and the udder voluminous  and pressed by the thighs, it is necessary, in order to distinguish the  part enclosed between the udder and the legs, and examine the full size  of the mirrors, to observe them attentively, and to place the legs wide  apart, and to smooth out the skin, in order to avoid the folds.    The mirrors may also be observed by holding the back of the hand against  the perineum, and drawing it from above downward, when the nails rubbing  against the up-growing hair, make the parts covered by it very  perceptible.    As the hair of the milk-mirror has not the same direction as the hair  which surrounds it, it may often be distinguished by a difference in the  shade reflected by it. It is then sufficient to place it properly to the  light in order to see the difference in shade, and to make out the part  covered by the upward-growing hair. Most frequently, however, the hair  of the milk-mirror is thin and fine, and the color of the skin can  easily be seen. If the eye alone is trusted, we shall often be deceived.    [Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [E.]]    In some countries cattle-dealers shave the back part of the cow. Just  after this operation the mirrors can neither be seen nor felt; but this  inconvenience ceases in a few days. It may be added that the  shaving--designed, as the dealers say, to beautify the cow--is generally  intended simply to destroy the milk-mirror, and to deprive buyers of one  means of judging of the milking qualities of the cows. It is unnecessary  to add that the cows most carefully shaven are those which are badly  marked, and that it is prudent to take it for granted that cows so shorn  are bad milkers.    Milk-mirrors vary in position, extent, and the figure which they  represent. They may be divided according to their position, into mirrors  or escutcheons, properly so called, or into lower and upper tufts, or  escutcheons. The latter are very small in comparison with the former,  and are situated in close proximity to the vulva, as seen at 1, in cut  E. They are very common on cows of bad milking races, but are very  rarely seen on the best milch cows. They consist of one or two ovals, or  small bands of up-growing hair, and serve to indicate the continuance of  the flow of milk. The period is short, in proportion as the tufts are  large. They must not be confounded with the escutcheon proper, which is  often extended up to the vulva. They are separated from it by bands of  hair, more or less large, as in cut marked F.    [Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [F.]]    Milk-mirrors are sometimes symmetrical, and sometimes without symmetry.  When there is a great difference in the extent of the two halves, it  almost always happens that the teats on the side where the mirror is  best developed give more milk than those of the opposite side. The left  half of the mirror, it may be remarked, is almost always the largest;  and so, when the perinean part is folded into a square, it is on this  side of the body that it unfolds. Of three thousand cows in Denmark,  but a single one was found, whose escutcheon varied even a little from  this rule.    The mirrors having a value in proportion to the space which they occupy,  it is of great importance to attend to all the rows of down-growing  hairs, which diminish the extent of surface, whether these tufts are in  the midst of the mirror, or form indentations on its edges.    These indentations, concealed in part by the folds of the skin, are  sometimes seen with difficulty; but it is important to take them into  account, since in a great many cows they materially lessen the size of  the mirror. Cows are often found, whose milk-mirrors at first sight  appear very large, but which are only medium milkers; and it will  usually be found that lateral indentations greatly diminish the surface  of up-growing hair. Many errors are committed in estimating the value of  such cows, from a want of attention to the real extent of the mirror.    All the interruptions in the surface of the mirror indicate a diminution  in the quantity of the milk, with the exception, however, of small oval  or elliptical plates which are found in the mirror, on the back part of  the udders of the best cows, as represented in the cut already given,  marked A. These ovals have a peculiar tint, which is occasioned by the  downward direction of the hair which forms them. In the best cows these  ovals exist with the lower mirrors very well developed, as represented  in the cut just named.    In short, it should be stated that, in order to determine the extent and  significance of a mirror, it is necessary to consider the state of the  perineum as to fat, and that of the fullness of the udder. In a fat cow,  with an inflated udder, the mirror would appear larger than it really  is; whilst in a lean cow, with a loose and wrinkled udder, it appears  smaller. Fat will cover faults--a fact to be borne in mind when  selecting a cow.    In bulls, the mirrors present the same peculiarities as in cows; but  they are less varied in their form, and especially much less in size.    In calves, the mirrors show the shapes which they are afterwards to  have, only they are more contracted, because the parts which they cover  are but slightly developed. They are easily seen after birth; but the  hair which then covers them is long, coarse, and stiff; and when this  hair falls off, the calf's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22775"],[0,"Psychotherapy (#10)"],[1,"by the  foregoing causes. But the psychologist has good reason to discriminate  between those actions which result from the normal psychophysical  factors and such actions as result from broken machinery. If the brain  is poisoned by alcohol or in fever, if an infectious disease has  destroyed the brain cells, action is no longer the outcome of the  normal cooeperation of the organs, and even those clusters of neural  activities which are accompanied by the consciousness of the own  personality lose their control of the motor outcome. The man in delirium  or paralysis acts without causal connection with his past; the action  is, therefore, not the product of his whole personality, and the  psychologist is justified in calling the man unfree. But, whenever the  motor response results from the undisturbed cooeperation of the normal  brain parts, then the inherited equipment and the whole experience and  the whole training, the acquired habits and the acquired inhibitions  will count in bringing about the reaction. This is the psychological  freedom of man. The unity of an interconnected composite and the freedom  of causal determination through normal cooeperation of all its parts  characterize the only personality which the psychologist has to  recognize.          IV    PSYCHOLOGY AND MEDICINE      We are now ready to take the first step towards an examination of the  problem of curing suffering mankind. So far we have spoken only of the  meaning of psychology, of its principles and of its fundamental theories  as to mind and brain. We have moved in an entirely theoretical sphere.  Now we approach a field in which everything is controlled by a practical  aim, the treatment of the sick. Yet our discussion of psychology should  have brought us much nearer to the point where we can enter this realm  of medicine. Everything depends on the right point of entrance. That an  influence on the inner life of man may be beneficial for his health is a  commonplace truth to-day for everybody. Every serious discussion of the  question has to consider which influences are appropriate, and in which  cases of illness the influence on inner life is advisable. The popular  treatises usually start this chapter by speaking of the \"mental and  moral\" factors; and this coupling of mental influences and moral  influences characterizes large parts of the discussions of the Christian  Scientists and the Christian half-scientists. Yet we must insist that  the right entrance to psychotherapy is missed if the difference between  morality and mentality is not clearly recognized from the beginning. The  confusion of the two harms every statement. To avoid such a fundamental  mistake, we had to take the long way around and to examine carefully  what psychology really means and what it does not mean.    We know now that inner life can be looked on from two entirely different  standpoints: a purposive one and a causal one, and we have seen that  these two ways of looking on inner life bring about entirely different  aspects of man's inner experience, serve different aims, and stand in  different relations to the immediate needs of our real life. We know  that the one, the causal aspect, belongs to psychology, while the  non-psychological, the purposive aspect, belongs to our immediate mutual  understanding in the walks of life. If the physician is to make use of  inner experience in the interests of overcoming sickness, he must first  decide whether to take the causal or the purposive point of view in  dealing with the patient's mind. This problem is too carelessly ignored  and through that neglect arises much of the popular confusion. Of course  just this carelessness becomes in some ways the ground for apparent  strength for many a superstition and prejudice. If the doors of the  causal mind and of the purposive mind are both open, and the spectator  does not notice that there are two, any trick on thought and reason can  easily be played. Whatever cannot pass through the causal door slips in  through the other, and whatever does not go in through the door of  purpose marches through the entrance of causality. With such methods  anything can be proved, and the most unscrupulous doctrines can be  nicely demonstrated. If we are to avoid such logical smuggling, we must  see clearly which attitude towards mental life belongs properly to the  domain of psychotherapy.    But what we have discussed now leaves little doubt as to the necessary  decision. The physician is interested in the mental life with the aim of  producing a certain effect, namely, that of health. Thus the mental life  of the whole personality comes in question for him as belonging to a  chain of causes and effects; whichever levers he may move, everything is  to be a cause which, in accordance with causal laws, is to produce a  certain change. Inner life is thus, in the interests of medical  treatment, necessarily a part of a causal system. This means the  standpoint of scientific psychology is the only adequate one. The  purposive view of inner life ought not to be in question when the  patient enters the doctor's office.    To characterize the difference, it may be said at once that it is a  purposive view which belongs to the minister. If the minister says to  his despairing parishioner, \"Be courageous, my friend, and be faithful,\"  nothing but a strictly purposive view gives meaning to the situation.  The word friend indicates it, that one subject of will approaches  another subject of will, with the intention of sympathy and  understanding of the attitude of the other; and the advice to be  courageous and faithful means an appeal which has its whole meaning in  the relation to aims and ends. The speaker and the hearer are both  moving in a sphere of will relations, purposes and ideals, sin and  virtue, hope and belief. To take the other extreme: if the neurasthenic  in his state of depression and in his feeling of inability seeks relief  from the nerve specialist, he too may say: \"My friend, be courageous and  faithful,\" yet his words have an entirely different purpose. They are  not appeals to a common interest of belief; they are subtle tools with  which to touch and to change certain psychophysical processes, certain  states in mind and brain; there each word is a sound which awakens  certain mental associations, and these associations are expected to be  causes of certain effects and these effects are to inhibit those  disturbing states of emotional depression. If a few grains of sodium  bromide were to produce the same effect, they would be just as welcome.  The whole consideration moves in a sphere in which only physiological  and psychological processes are happening. Thus the physician may work  with the ideas of religious belief, but those ideas are then no longer  religious values but natural psychophysical material, which is to be  applied whenever it appears as the right means to secure a certain  effect.    On the other hand the minister also knows, of course, that every word  which he speaks has its psychological effect, but he abstracts from that  entirely, as his belief should appeal directly to the struggling will of  the man. As minister, he is thus not a psychologist. He works with  moral means; the physician, with causal means. The view which the doctor  has to take of the man before him is therefore thoroughly psychological;  whereas that of the religious friend is thoroughly unpsychological, or  better, apsychological. Indeed it is misleading, or at least demands a  special kind of definition, if people say that the minister has to be a  good psychologist. It is just as misleading as the claim, which we hear  so often, that for instance Shakespeare was a great psychologist. No,  the poet deals with human beings from the purposive standpoint of life  and the mere resolving of complex purposes into parts of purposes is not  psychology in the technical sense of the term. The poet makes us  understand the inner life, but he does not describe or explain it; he  makes us feel with other people, but he does not make those feelings  causally understood. The realistic novelists sometimes undertake this  psychological task, but they are then on the borderland of literature,  the analysis of their heroes becomes then a psychological one.  Shakespeare understood human beings better than anyone and therefore the  men and women whom his imagination created are so fully lifelike that  the psychologist may feel justified in using them as material for his  psychological analysis, but Shakespeare himself did not enter into that  psychological dissection; he kept the purposive point of view. In the  same way certainly the minister--the same holds true for the lawyer or  the tradesman or anyone who enters into practical dealings with his  neighbor--may resolve complex attitudes of will into their components,  but each part still remains a will attitude which has to be understood  and to be interpreted and to be appreciated, while the psychologist  would take every one of those parts as a conscious content to be  described and to be explained. But here we abstract from the purposive  relations. Our attention belongs now to the doctor's dealing with man;  for him cause and effect are the only vehicles of connection. Thus he  has to exclude the purposive interpretation of inner life and has to  understand every factor involved from a psychological point of view: his  psychotherapy must be thoroughly applied psychology.    The day of applied psychology is only dawning. The situation is indeed  surprising. The last three or four decades have given to the world at  last a really scientific study of psychology, a study not unworthy of  being compared with that of physics or chemistry or biology. In the  center of the whole movement stood the psychological laboratory with its  equipment for the most subtle analysis and explanatory investigation of  mental phenomena."]]]
