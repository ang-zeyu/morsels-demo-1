To my surprise, the flock did  not take flight, but continued to advance as before, until they were  almost among the horse's feet.  I could stand it no longer.  I drove the  spurs deeply, and galloped into their midst, striking right and left as  they fluttered up round me.  Of course they were soon off; but of those  that had been trodden upon by my horse, and others I had knocked down, I  counted no less than twenty-seven!  Proud of my exploit, I gathered the  birds into my bag, and rode in search of my companions.    \"Our party on this day numbered over 800 head killed; but, to our  surprise and chagrin, our antagonists had beaten us by more than a  hundred!    \"The gentlemen of `ours' were wretched.  The belles were monopolised by  our antagonists; we were scouted, and debarred every privilege.    \"It was not to be endured; something must be done.  What was to be done?  counselled we.  If fair means will not answer, we must try the opposite.  It was evident that our antagonists were better shots than we.    \"The colonel, too, was one of them, and he was sure to kill every time  he pulled trigger.  The odds were against us; some plan must be devised;  some _ruse_ must be adopted, and the idea of one had been passing  through my mind during the whole of that day.  It was this:--I had  noticed, what has been just remarked, that, although the pigeons will  not allow the sportsman to come within range of a fowling-piece, yet at  a distance of little over a hundred yards they neither fear man nor  beast.  At that distance they sit unconcerned, thousands of them upon a  single tree.  It struck me that a gun large enough to throw shot among  them would be certain of killing hundreds at each discharge; but where  was such a gun to be had?  As I reflected thus, `mountain howitzers'  came into my mind.  I remembered the small mountain howitzers I had seen  at Covington.  One of these loaded with shot would be the very weapon.  I knew there was a battery of them at the Barracks.  I knew that a  friend of mine commanded the battery.  By steamer, should one pass, it  was but a few hours to Covington.  I proposed sending for a `mountain  howitzer.'    \"I need hardly say that my proposal was hailed with a universal welcome  on the part of my companions; and without dropping a hint to the other  party, it was at once resolved that the design should be carried into  execution.  It was carried into execution.  An `up-river' boat chanced  to pass in the nick of time.  A messenger was forthwith, despatched to  Covington, and before twelve o'clock upon the following day another boat  on her down trip brought the howitzer, and we had it secretly landed and  conveyed to a place in the woods previously agreed upon.  My friend,  Captain C--, had sent a `live corporal' along with it, and we had no  difficulty in its management.    \"As I had anticipated, it answered our purpose as though it had been  made for it.  Every shot brought down a shower of dead birds, and after  one discharge alone the number obtained was 123!  At night our  `game-bag' counted over three thousand birds!  We were sure of the  ladies for the morrow.    \"Before returning home to our certain triumph, however, there were some  considerations.  To-morrow we should have the ladies in our company;  some of the fair creatures would be as good as sure to `split' upon the  howitzer.  What was to be done to prevent this?    \"We eight had sworn to be staunch to each other.  We had taken every  precaution; we had only used our `great gun' when far off, so that its  report might not reach the ears of our antagonists; but how about  to-morrow?  Could we trust our fair companions with a secret?  Decidedly  not.  This was the unanimous conclusion.  A new idea now came to our  aid.  We saw that we might dispense with the howitzer, and still manage  to out-count our opponents.  We would make a depository of birds in a  safe place.  There was a squatter's house near by: that would do.  So we  took the squatter into our council, and left some 1500 birds in his  charge, the remainder being deemed sufficient for that day.  From the  1500 thus left, we might each day take a few hundred to make up our  game-bag just enough to out-number the other party.  We did not send  home the corporal and his howitzer.  We might require him again; so we  quartered him upon the squatter.    \"On returning home, we found that our opponents had also made a `big  day's work of it;' but they were beaten by hundreds.  The ladies were  ours!    \"And we kept them until the end of the hunt, to the no little  mortification of the gentlemen in the `minority:' to their surprise, as  well; for most of them being crack-shots, and several of us not at all  so, they could not comprehend why they were every day beaten so  outrageously.  We had hundreds to spare, and barrels of the birds were  cured for winter use.    \"Another thing quite puzzled our opponents, as well as many good people  in the neighbourhood.  That was the loud reports that had been heard in  the woods.  Some argued they were thunder, while others declared they  must have proceeded from an earthquake.  This last seemed the more  probable, as the events I am narrating occurred but a few years after  the great earthquake in the Mississippi Valley, and people's minds were  prepared for such a thing.    \"I need not tell you how the knowing ones enjoyed the laugh for several  days, and it was not until the colonel's _reunion_ was about to break  up, that our secret was let out, to the no small chagrin of our  opponents, but to the infinite amusement of our host himself, who,  although one of the defeated party, often narrates to his friends the  story of the `Hunt with a Howitzer.'\"        CHAPTER SIX.    KILLING A COUGAR.    Although we had made a five miles' march from the place where we had  halted to shoot the pigeons, our night-camp was still within the  boundaries of the flock.  During the night we could hear them at  intervals at no great distance off.  A branch occasionally cracked, and  then a fluttering of wings told of thousands dislodged or frightened by  its fall.  Sometimes the fluttering commenced without any apparent  cause.  No doubt the great-horned owl (_Strix virginiana_), the wild cat  (_felis rufa_), and the raccoon, were busy among them, and the silent  attacks of these were causing the repeated alarms.    Before going to rest, a torch-hunt was proposed by way of variety, but  no material for making good torches could be found, and the idea was  abandoned.  Torches should be made of dry pine-knots, and carried in  some shallow vessel.  The common frying-pan, with a long handle, is best  for the purpose.  Link-torches, unless of the best pitch-pine (_Pinus  resinosa_), do not burn with sufficient brightness to stultify the  pigeons.  They will flutter off before the hunter can get his long pole  within reach, whereas with a very brilliant light, he may approach  almost near enough to lay his hands upon them.  As there were no  pitch-pine-trees in the neighbourhood, nor any good torch-wood, we were  forced to give up the idea of a night-hunt.    During the night strange noises were heard by several who chanced to be  awake.  Some said they resembled the howling of dogs, while others  compared them to the screaming of angry cats.  One party said they were  produced by wolves; another, that the wild cats (lynxes) made them.  But  there was one that differed from all the rest.  It was a sort of  prolonged hiss, that all except Ike believed to be the snort of the  black bear, lice, however, declared that it was not the bear, but the  \"sniff,\" as he termed it, of the \"painter\" (cougar).  This was probable  enough, considering the nature of the place.  The cougar is well-known  to frequent the great roosts of the passenger-pigeon, and is fond of the  flesh of these birds.    In the morning our camp was still surrounded by the pigeons, sweeping  about among the tree-trunks, and gathering the mast as they went.  A few  shots were fired, not from any inclination to continue the sport of  killing them, but to lay in a fresh stock for the day's dinner.  The  surplus from yesterday's feast was thrown away, and left by the deserted  camp--a banquet for the preying creatures that would soon visit the  spot.    We moved on, still surrounded by masses upon the wing.  A singular  incident occurred as we were passing through a sort of avenue in the  forest.  It was a narrow aisle, on both sides walled in by the thick  foliage of the beeches.  We were fairly within this hall-like passage,  when it suddenly darkened at the opposite end.  We saw that a cloud of  pigeons had entered it, flying towards us.  They were around our heads  before they had noticed us.  Seeing our party, they suddenly attempted  to diverge from their course, but there was no other open to them,  except to rise upward in a vertical direction.  This they did on the  instant--the clatter of their wings producing a noise like the continued  roar of thunder.  Some had approached so near, that the men on  horseback, striking with their guns, knocked several to the ground; and  the Kentuckian, stretching upward his long arm, actually caught one of  them on the wing.  In an instant they were out of sight; but at that  instant two great birds appeared before us at the opening of the forest,  which were at once recognised as a brace of white-headed eagles (_Falco  leucocephalus_).  This accounted for the rash flight of the pigeons; for  the eagles had evidently been in pursuit of them, and had driven them to  seek shelter under the trees.  We were desirous of emptying our guns at  the great birds of prey, and there was a simultaneous spurring of horses  and cocking of guns: to no purpose, however.  The eagles were on the  alert.  They had already espied us; and, uttering their maniac screams,  they wheeled suddenly, and disappeared over the tree-tops. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23519"],[0,"The Mormon Menace: The Confessions of John Doyle Lee, Danite (#10)"],[1,"had been sent as a warning messenger, to let it  return again, and I would follow it. We then traveled on some two  miles, when the messenger returned the third time and appeared,  if possible, more determined than before to turn us towards home.  I turned my team and started, as straight as I could go, for  Adam-on-Diamond.    As we passed over the prairie we saw the smoke rising from many  farms and houses in the vicinity of where we had left our bee  trees. This smoke showed us that our enemies were at work, and  that had we kept on in the course we were first intending to  travel we would have fallen into the hands of the lawless and  lost our lives.    Before we got home the news of the attack upon the settlements  had reached there. It was also reported, and we afterwards  learned that the report was true, that many of the Mormon  settlers had been tied to trees and whipped with hickory withes,  some of them being horribly mangled by the mob. This conduct on  the part of the Gentiles roused every Mormon to action, and the  excitement was very great.    Joseph the Prophet was then sent for. Col. White called together  every man and boy that could carry arms. When the forces were  assembled Col. White made a war speech. As he spoke he stood by  his fine brown horse. There was a bearskin on his saddle. He had  a red handkerchief around his head, regular Indian fashion, with  the knot in front; he stood bareheaded, in his shirt sleeves,  with collar open, showing his naked breast. He held a large  cutlass in his right hand. His manner of address struck terror to  his enemies, while it charged his brethren with enthusiastic zeal  and forced them to believe they were invincible and bullet-proof.  We were about three hundred and seventy-five strong. I stood near  Col. White while he was speaking, and I judge of its effect upon  others by the way it affected me.    While our Colonel was in the midst of his speech the aid-de-camp  of the militia colonel came up with a dispatch to Col. White, to  the effect that the militia had become mutinous and could no  longer be controlled, but were going to join the mob; that the  colonel would disband his forces, and would then go and report to  the Governor the true condition of the country; that Col. White  must take and make use of all the means in his power to protect  the people from the mob, for the Government officers were  powerless to aid him.    The aid did not deliver his message, for as he rode up close to  where Col. White was standing speaking to his men, he stopped and  listened a short time; then he wheeled his horse and rode back to  the militia camp and reported that Col. White had fifteen  thousand men under arms, in battle array, and would be upon their  camp in less than two hours; that he was then making a speech to  the army, and that it was the most exciting speech he had ever  listened to in his life; that he meant war, and of the most  fearful kind, and the only safety for their forces was in instant  retreat. The soldiers broke camp and left in haste. I cannot say  that the colonel commanding the militia was alarmed, or that he  fled through fear of being overcome; but it suited him to leave,  for he was anxious to prevent a collision between his troops and  the men under Col. White.    Joseph, when informed of the danger of the settlers from mob  violence, sent Maj. Seymour Brunson, of Far West, with fifty men  to protect the settlers who lived on the two forks of the Grand  River. Col. White kept his men in readiness for action. A strong  guard was posted round the settlement; a point was agreed upon to  which place all were to hasten in case of alarm. This point of  meeting was east of the town, under the bluffs, on the main road  leading from Mill Port to Adam-on-Diamond.    This road ran between the fields and bluff. We expected to be  attacked every hour. A few nights afterwards the alarm was given,  and every man rushed to the field. When I reached the command I  found everything in confusion. The officer in command tried to  throw two companies across the road, but the firing was heavy and  constant from the opposing forces, who had selected a strong  point for the purpose of attack and defense. The flash of the  rifles and the ringing reports that echoed through the hills at  each discharge of the guns added to the confusion, and soon  forced the Mormons to take up their position in the fence corners  and elsewhere, so they could be in a measure protected from the  bullets of the enemy. Soon there was order in our ranks, and we  were prepared to dislodge our opponents or die in the attempt,  when two men came at the full speed of their horses, shouting:    \"Peace! peace! Cease firing, it is our friends.\"    Chapman Duncan, the adjutant of Col. White, was the one who  shouted peace. We were then informed that the men we had taken  for a part of the Gentile mob were no other than the command of  Maj. Brunson, who had been out on Three Forks to defend the  settlers, and that he had been ordered back to the main body of  the Hosts of Israel. They had intended to stop at Mill Port, but  finding it deserted they concluded to alarm the troops at Adam-  on-Diamond, so as to learn whether they would fight or not. I  admit that I was much pleased to learn that danger was over and  we were facing friends and not enemies; yet I was mad to think  men would impose upon us in that way. The experiment was a  dangerous one, and likely to be very serious in its consequences.  The other men with me were equally wroth at the insult offered by  those who had been so foolish as to question our bravery.    The withdrawal of the State militia was the signal for the  Gentiles to give vent to the worst of their inclinations. The  Mormons, at command of the Prophet, at once abandoned their  homes, taking what could be carried with them, and hastened to  either Far West or Adam-on-Diamond for protection and safety.  Some few refused to obey orders, and they afterwards paid the  penalty for disobedience by giving up their lives to the savage  Gentiles who attacked and well-nigh exterminated them.    Armed men roamed in bands all over Caldwell, Carroll, and Daviess  counties; both Mormons and Gentiles were under arms, doing injury  to each other when occasion offered. The burning of houses,  farms, and stacks of grain was generally indulged in by each  party. Lawlessness prevailed, and pillage was the rule.    The Prophet Joseph said it was a civil war, and that by the rules  of war each party was justified in spoiling his enemy. This  opened the door, and men of former quiet became perfect demons in  their efforts to spoil and waste away the enemies of the Church.  I then found that men are creatures of circumstances, and that  the occasion calls forth the men needed for each enterprise.    I also soon saw that it was the natural inclination of men to  convert to their own use that which others possessed. What  perplexed me most was to see how religion had not the power to  subdue that passion in man, but at the first moment when the  restrictions of the Church were withdrawn the most devout in our  community acted like natural-born thieves.    Being young, stout, and having plenty of property, I fitted  myself out in first-class style. I had good horses and plenty of  the best of arms. I joined in the general patrol duty, and took  part in daily raids made under either Maj. Brunson or Capt.  Alexander McRay. I saw much of what was being done by both  parties. I also made several raids under Capt. Jonathan Dunham,  alias Black Hawk. I remember one incident that was amusing at the  time, as it enabled us to determine what part of our forces would  fight on the field and face the enemy, and also those who  preferred to fight with their mouths.    Early in the morning, while Maj. Brunson's men were marching  along, shivering in the cold - for it was a dark, cloudy morning  late in October, 1838 - we saw a company of horsemen some three  miles away. We concluded they were Missourians, and made for them  at full speed. They halted and appeared willing to fight. When  our command got within three hundred yards of them many of our  pulpit braves found out all at once that they must stop and  dismount to fix their saddles or for some other reason. The  remainder of us rode on until within one hundred and fifty yards  of the other force, and were drawn up in line of battle. Maj.  Brunson rode forward and hailed them, saying,    \"Who are you?\"    \"Capt. McRay,\" was the reply. \"Who are you?\"    \"Maj. Brunson.\"    They met and shook hands. Seeing this the pulpit braves rushed up  in great haste and took their places in the ranks, and lamented  because we did not have an enemy to overcome.    So it is through life - a coward is generally a liar; those men  were cowards, and lied when they pretended they would like to  fight. All cowards are liars, but many liars are brave men.    While I was engaged with the Mormon troops in ranging over the  country, the men that I was with took a large amount of loose  property, but did not while I was with them burn any houses or  murder any men. Yet we took what property we could find,  especially provisions, fat cattle, arms, and ammunition. But  still many houses were burned and much damage was done by the  Mormons, and they captured a howitzer and many guns from the  Gentiles. Frequent attacks were also made upon the Mormon  settlements.    The Mormons made an attack on Gallatin one night, and carried off  much plunder. I was not there with them, but I talked often with  others and learned all the facts about it. The town was burned  down, and everything of value, including the goods in two stores,  carried off by the Mormons. I often escaped being present with  the troops by loaning my horses and arms to others who liked that  kind of work better than I did. Unless I had adopted that course  I could never have escaped from being"]]]
