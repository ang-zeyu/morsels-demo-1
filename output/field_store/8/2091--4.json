[Illustration: Titmice.]    At last it was ended, and Blue Tit was victor. It was pretty to see the  tiny pair building their nest, with little happy twitterings and  confabulations over each piece of moss or dried leaf, and so fearless  were they that a large blind was often let down close to and over the  husk without disturbing the inmates. When the hen bird was sitting, the  cock would bring a green caterpillar for her every four or five minutes,  and sometimes take her place on the nest. I often took the husk down  from its nail to show the brave little bird sitting on her eggs. If  touched she would hiss and set up her feathers, but did not leave her  nest. When the young birds were hatched, the parents were incessantly at  work from early morning till late at night bringing small caterpillars  about every two minutes to supply the wants of the tiny brood. One can  judge of the usefulness of these birds in ridding our gardens of insect  pests by the amount consumed by this one pair. By a moderate  calculation, and judging by what I saw one afternoon, I believe they  must have brought 3,570 in the course of one week. At last the day came  when five little blue heads peeped out of the entrance to the husk. One  after another the little ones flew into branches near by; the last one I  held in my hand for a while that I might draw its portrait. Fearing it  might be hungry if I kept it too long, I placed it in a cage on the  lawn, where the old birds found it and fed it for me through the bars. I  then brought it in again, and having finished its likeness, had the  pleasure of restoring it to its parents. The Blue and Cole Tit often  choose the inside of a disused pump as their nesting-place. A Cole Tit  built in an old pump in our grounds for many years, the curved spout  being its mode of ingress and egress. I could open a small door and look  at the pretty little hen on her nest, and then at her numerous family,  and watch their growth till old enough to fly. Certainly young birds  show a grand lesson of obedience, for creeping out into the world  through a dark, curved pipe, must have seemed a rather perilous mode of  exit. Another less fortunate Cole Tit built in a post-box placed by a  garden gate, and seemed in no way disconcerted when letters came in  suddenly around and upon her. She usually laid eighteen eggs in a deep,  soft nest of moss and hair. As boys were apt to take this nest year  after year, a lock was placed to the box to protect the little bird; but  the genus boy has no pity, and through the slit for the letters, some  cruel urchin, vexed at not being able to take the nest, put in a stick  and killed the poor little mother and broke the eggs. For several years  a Blue Tit chose to build her nest in the lower part of a stone vase in  the garden. There was a hole for drainage in the bottom, and through  this hole the little bird found a circular space just suited for her  nest. That particular vase could not be filled with plants till long  after all the rest were gay with flowers. We were obliged to wait till  the domestic affairs of the Tit family were ended, else their fate would  have been sad indeed. There is no doubt that these birds do contrive to  secure their share of peas and other things in the kitchen garden, and  are by no means favourites with the gardeners, but I still maintain that  the good they do in destroying insects counterbalances their evil doings  in other respects. However, they sometimes commit other misdemeanours.  My head gardener came to me one day looking very serious, and began by  asking what he was to do about \"those Blue Tits.\" \"Why, what have they  been doing?\" I asked. \"Two of them have been sitting at the entrance of  one of the hives, and they have picked off and killed every bee as it  came out, and now they have begun upon a second hive.\" \"Well, you had  better hang up some potatoes stuck over with feathers, and that will  frighten them away.\" \"I've done that, ma'am, and they sit on the  potatoes and look at me!\" It was a trying case of utter contumacy, and  at last I was obliged, for the sake of saving my bees, to let one little  victim be shot and hung up as \"an awful example\" to the rest, and it  proved an effectual remedy. My basket of fat used to prove very  attractive all through the cold weather, when, I suppose, these tiny  birds need the caloric it supplies; they always left off coming as soon  as the days were warm and insects plentiful.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    BLANCHE, THE PIGEON.      Pigeons possess a great deal more individuality of character than any  one would suppose who has only seen them in flocks picking up grain in a  farmyard, like domestic fowls.    They show to better advantage when only a few pairs are kept and fed  daily at some settled place; but to make really interesting pets two are  quite sufficient, and may be made very amusing companions. Some species  may possess more mental capacity than others. Those I have to speak of  were snow-white trumpeters. A pair was sent to me, but, to my sorrow, I  found on opening the basket that the male bird had escaped on the way;  so I could only put the solitary hen in a cage, and do all that was  possible in the way of plentiful food and kind care to make her happy;  but all to no purpose. The poor bird pined and grew weaker every day,  till she became unable to get up to her perch. I used, therefore, to go  to her every evening and place her comfortably for the night; and she  soon grew tame enough to like being caressed and talked to. When spring  returned I obtained a male pigeon, and hoped Blanche would accept him  for a mate, but she showed a great deal of temper, and made him so  unhappy that he had to be exchanged for another--a fine snow-white bird  like herself, and, happily, of such a forbearing disposition as to  endure being considerably \"hen-pecked.\" Now began the curious part of  Blanche's history. The pair built a nest in a small pigeon-house close  to my window, so that I was able to watch all the family arrangements  with much interest. Blanche liked to be with me for some hours in the  morning, sitting on the table pluming herself, quite at ease, and when  that operation was ended she generally seated herself on a large Bible  which lay at one end of the dining-table, and there she usually went to  sleep; a white dove resting on the Word suggested to one's mind many a  beautiful emblematic thought. These visits to me were paid most  regularly when a nest was finished and the eggs were being hatched; she  then shared the duties of incubation by turns with her mate. He would  sit patiently for four hours on the nest, while Blanche spent that time  with me; then, punctually at the right moment, she would wake up, and,  lazily stretching her wings, would fly out at the open window to see how  affairs were getting on at home, and take her place on the nest for her  appointed four hours.    She was a most eccentric bird in the matter of laying eggs. I sometimes  found she had made me a present of one, neatly placed amongst my working  materials! In fact, wherever she happened to be upon the table would be  deemed by her a suitable place for laying; and, as I always conveyed the  eggs to her nest, her little freaks did not much matter. But at last  she took it into her wilful little head to lay her eggs in the  coal-scoop, an arrangement which by no means improved her snowy plumage.  She had a pretty crest, which curved over her head, and her feet were  clothed with rather long feathers reaching to the claws. At our  breakfast-time she would often sit close to my plate, letting me stroke  her and draw out her pretty wings. I must own she was as conceited as  any peacock, throwing herself on her side and stretching out a feathered  foot, little dreaming how she was being laughed at for her affected  attitudes. If she had a fault, it was her temper! I have seen her go up  to her mate and give him a most uncalled-for peck, and he--amiable  bird!--would bear all her unkindness so meekly, only answering by a  propitiatory coo. Blanche reared many sons and daughters, but none were  so interesting as herself. I ascribe her unusual tameness to the loving  care bestowed upon her in her long illness. When once a bird's  affections are won in that way they generally remain firm friends for  life.          [Illustration]    GERBILLES.      These curious little animals were brought to my notice by a scientific  friend who had seen them at the Zoological Gardens, and heard that they  were to be obtained there by applying to Mr. Bartlett.    As I always regretted the untimely death of my pet jerboa, I thought  these little rodents would fill his place, and prove amusing pets. And,  accordingly, I paid a visit to the Zoo, and found a whole colony of  gerbilles of all ages living very amicably together in a large,  strongly-built wooden box, with bran, oats, and nuts for provender.    It was no easy matter to secure a pair of suitable size and age. I could  but admire the patience of the attendant who made persevering attempts  to catch the nimble creatures for me, but they leaped and sprang about,  darted through his fingers, disappeared into holes, and seemed to enjoy  his discomfiture. At length a lively pair, with sleek skins and perfect  tails, were securely caged.    Then I was warned to keep them in a tin-lined cage, as they would \"gnaw  through anything,\" even the solid teak chest in which they were kept was  being rapidly demolished by their powerful incisors.    The gerbilles were placed in a plant case, four feet long, with glass  sides and top, through which their gambols could easily be seen. The  case had a glass partition, and on one side lived a pair of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21137"],[0,"Parkhurst Boys, and Other Stories of School Life (#10)"],[1,".  I suppose he thinks no one knows that but himself.\"    \"Let's see,\" said Hutton, \"we are going north-west, aren't we?\"    \"Yes, so we shall be able to make use of the wind both ways, with a  little tacking.\"    \"He's shouting something now,\" said Charlie, with his eyes still on  Neil.    \"Oh, he's an old woman,\" said Hall, laughing; \"he's always wanting to  tell you this and that, as if no one knew anything about sailing but  himself.\"  And he took off his hat and waved it ceremoniously to the old  sailor, who continued shouting and beckoning all the while, though  without avail, for the only words that came to us across the water were  \"fresh\" and \"afternoon,\" and we were not much enlightened by them.    \"I'm afraid he's fresh in the morning,\" laughed Hutton.    A short sail brought us to the bar mouth, over which, as the tide was in  and the sea quiet, we passed without difficulty, although Hall had bade  us have the oars ready in case of emergency, should it be necessary to  lower our sail in crossing.  But of this there was no need, and in a  minute we were at last in the bay, and fairly at sea.    \"Do you see Parkhurst over the trees there, you fellows?\" cried Charlie,  pointing behind us.  \"I never saw the place from the bay before.\"    \"Nor I,\" I answered; \"it looks better here than from any other side.\"    We were all proud of the old school-house, and fully impressed with its  superiority over any other building of the kind in the kingdom.    The view in the bay was extremely beautiful, Shargle Head stood out  opposite us, distinct and grand, towering up from the water, and  sweeping back to join the moorland hills behind.  On our left, close  beside the bar mouth, rose Raven Cliff, where we so often had been wont  to lie and look out on this very bay; and one by one we recognised the  familiar spots from our new point of view, and agreed that from no side  does a grand coast look so grand as from the sea.    Our boat scudded along merrily, Hall keeping her a steady course, well  up to the wind.  After a few lessons we got to know our respective  duties (so we thought) with all the regularity of a trained ship's crew.  With the wind as it was, right across our course, we had not much need  to tack; but when the order to \"stand by\" did arrive, we prided  ourselves that we knew how to act.    Hall let go the sheet, and Hutton lowered the sail, Charlie put round  the helm, and I in the bows was ready to aid the others in shifting the  canvas to the other side of the mast and hauling up the sail again.  Then Hall resumed charge of the helm and drew in the sheet, Charlie and  Hutton \"trimmed\" over to the other side of the boat, and once again our  little craft darted forward.    We were all in exuberant spirits that lovely summer morning; even  Charlie seemed to have forgotten his uneasiness at first starting, for  he was now the life and soul of our party.    He told us wonderful stories about this very bay, gathered from some of  his favourite histories.  How, after the defeat of the Spanish Armada,  when the proud vessels of Spain were driven partly by tempest, partly by  the pursuit of our admiral, headlong along: this very coast, one of them  had got into Colveston Bay, and there been driven ashore at the base of  Raven Cliff, not one man of all her crew surviving that awful wreck.  And he repeated one after another the legends connected with Druce  Castle, whose ruined turrets we could discern away behind us, and of all  the coves and crags and caves as we passed them, till, in our  imagination, the bay became alive once more with ships and battle, and  we seemed to watch the gleam of armour on the castle walls, and the  glare of beacons on the headlands, and to hear the thunder of cannon  from the beach; when presently Hall's cheery call to \"stand by\" wakened  us into a sudden recollection of our present circumstances.  And then  what songs we sang! what famous sea stories Hall told us! how Hutton  made us roar with his recitations! how the time seemed to fly, and the  boat too, and we in it, until at last we found the Great Shargle  towering over our heads, and knew we had all but reached our  destination.    Hall looked at his watch.    \"That was a good run, boys,\" said he; \"not quite two hours--an  uncommonly good run for an old tub like this.  Now where shall we land?\"    \"I vote we land on Welkin Island,\" said Charlie.    Welkin Island was separate about three-quarters of a mile from the  mainland, famous for its caves and shells.    \"All serene,\" said Hall, putting the boat about; \"stand by.\"    So we made our last tack, and very soon were close up at the island.  After some cruising we selected an eligible creek for landing, into  which Hall ran our boat as neatly as the most experienced helmsman in  Her Majesty's Navy.    Then we landed, and dragging ashore our hamper of provisions, picnicked  at the edge of the rocks, with the water on three sides of us, with  Shargle Head across the narrow channel rising majestically above us, and  the great amphitheatre of the bay extended like a picture beyond.    Need I say what a jovial repast it was; what appetites we had, what zest  our situation lent to our meal, how each vied with each in merriment!  But Charlie was the blithest of us all.    Then we wandered over that wonderful island.  We waded into the caves,  and climbed to the cliff tops; we filled our pockets with shells, we  bathed, we aimed stones into the sea, we raced along the strand, we cut  our names in a row on the highest point of the island, in commemoration  of our expedition, and there they remain to this day.    \"I say, I hope it's not going to rain,\" said Hutton, looking up at the  clouds, which had for some time been obscuring the sun.    \"Who cares if it does?\" shouted Charlie.  \"Hullo, there goes my roof!\"  cried he, as a sudden gust of wind lifted his hat from his head, and  sent it skimming down the rocks.    \"I think it's time we started home,\" said Hall hurriedly.    There was something in the uneasy look of his face as he said this which  made me uncomfortable.    So we turned to embark once more in our boat.    We could not conceal from ourselves, as we made our way to the creek  where we had left her moored, that the weather, which had thus far been  so propitious to our expedition, was not holding out as we could have  wished.  The wind, which had been little more than a steady breeze  during the morning, now met us in frequent gusts, which made us raise  our hands to our hats.  A few ugly-looking black clouds on the horizon  had come up and obscured the sun, threatening not only to shut out his  rays, but to break over the bay in a heavy downpour of rain.  Even on  the half-sheltered side of the island where we were, the water, which  had hitherto moved only in ripples, now began to heave restlessly in  waves, which curled over as they met the breeze, and covered the sea  with little white breakers.  There was an uncanny sort of moan about the  wind as it swept down the hollows of the rocks, and even the seagulls,  as they skimmed past us on the surface of the now sombre water, seemed  uncomfortable.    However, the sea was not rough, and though the sun happened to be hidden  from us, we could see it shining brightly away in the direction of  Parkhurst.  The wind, too, though stronger than it had been in the  morning, was still not violent, and we had little doubt of making as  quick, if not a quicker passage back than we had already made.    So, although in our secret hearts each one of us would perhaps have  preferred the weather of the earlier part of the day to have continued,  we did not let our uneasiness appear to our fellows, or allow it to  interfere with our show of good spirits.    \"I tell you what,\" said Charlie, laughing, as we came down to our boat,  \"it would be a real spree to have a little rough water going back, just  for the fun of seeing old Hutton seasick.\"    \"I shall be very pleased to give you some amusement,\" replied Hutton;  \"and perhaps Adams will assist, for I saw him looking anxiously over the  bows once or twice as we were coming.\"    \"So did I,\" said Charlie; \"he must have seen a ghost in the water, for  he looked awfully pale.\"    \"Shut up, you fellows,\" cried I, who was notoriously a bad sailor, and  easily disturbed by a rough sea; \"perhaps we shall all--\"    \"I say,\" called out Hall from the boat, where he was busy tying up a  reef in our sail, \"I wish you fellows would lend a hand here, instead of  standing and chaffing there.\"    We obeyed with alacrity, and very soon had our boat ready for starting.    \"Now, Adams and Hutton, take the oars, will you? and pull her out of  this creek: we had better not hoist our sail till we are clear of these  rocks.\"    As we emerged from our little harbour the boat \"lumped\" heavily over the  waves that broke upon the rocks, and we had a hard pull to get her clear  of these and turn her with her stern to Shargle.    \"Now stand by,\" shouted Hall.    We shipped our oars, and in a moment the sail, shortened by one reef,  was hauled up, and the boat began to scud swiftly forward.    \"You'll have to sit right over, you two,\" said Hall to Hutton and me,  \"to keep her trim.  Look sharp about it!\"    As he spoke a gust took the sail, and caused the boat to heel over far  on to her side.  She righted herself in an instant, however, and on we  went, flying through the water.    \"How do you feel, Adams?\" called out Charlie mischievously, from his end  of the boat.    \"Pleasant motion, isn't it?\" put in Hutton, laughing.    \"Look here, you fellows,\" said Hall abruptly, \"stop fooling now, and  look after the boat.\"    \"Why, what's the row?\" said Hutton, struck with his unusually serious  tone.  \"It's all right, isn't it?\"    \"It's all right,\" said Hall curtly, \"if you'll only attend to the  sailing.\"    Our merriment died away on our lips, for it was plain to be seen Hall  was in no jesting humour."]]]
