[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22114"],[0,"A Plain Cookery Book for the Working Classes (#10)"],[1," you may happen to catch when  fishing, conger eels cut in slices, and almost any kind of fish which  may come within reach of your means, are all more or less fit for making  a good mess of soup for a meal. First, chop fine some onions, and put  them into a pot with enough water to furnish about half a pint for each  person to be provided for, and set this on the fire to boil for ten  minutes; then add your pieces of fish, of about four ounces each; season  with thyme, pepper, and salt, and boil the soup for about fifteen  minutes longer, when it will be ready for dinner. Some well-boiled  potatoes will prove a welcome addition to this soup.    _Note._--This kind of fish soup will prove the more advantageous near  the sea-coast, where inferior kinds of fish are always very cheap.      No. 119. SOUSED MACKEREL.    When mackerel are to be bought at six for a shilling, this kind of fish  forms a cheap dinner. On such occasions, the mackerel must be placed  heads and tails in an earthen dish or pan, seasoned with chopped onions,  black pepper, a pinch of allspice, and salt; add sufficient vinegar and  water in equal proportions to cover the fish. Bake in your own oven, if  you possess one, or send them to the baker's.    _Note._--Herrings, sprats, or any other cheap fish, are soused in the  same manner.      No. 120. A DINNER OF RED HERRINGS.    The cheaper sort of red herrings are always too salty, and unpleasantly  strong-flavoured, and are therefore an indifferent kind of food, unless  due precaution is taken to soak them in water for an hour before they  are cooked. First, soak the red herrings in water for an hour; wipe, and  split them down the back; toast or broil them on both sides for two or  three minutes, and having placed them on a dish, put a bit of butter and  some chopped onion upon each herring; pour a little vinegar over all,  and this will make a cheap and savoury dish to be eaten with well-boiled  potatoes.      No. 121. TO FRY FISH.    For this purpose you must have some kind of fat. Either lard, butter, or  dripping fat, would be excellent; but they must be bought, and cost a  little money. True; but then, if you can afford yourselves a bit of  meat occasionally, by dint of good thrift you should save the fat from  the boiled meat, or the dripping from your baked meats, and thus furnish  yourselves with fat for frying your fish twice a-week; and let me tell  you that by introducing fish as an occasional part of your daily food,  your health, as well as your pockets, would feel the benefit of such a  system of economy. Suppose, then, that you have bought some cheap kind  of fish, such as herrings, large flounders, plaice, small soles, or any  other small or flat fish. First of all, let the fish be washed and wiped  dry, and rubbed all over with a little flour. Next, put about two ounces  of fat, free from water, in a frying-pan on the fire, and, as soon as it  is hot, put the fish in to fry, one or two at a time, according to their  size, as, unless they have room enough in the frying-pan they do not fry  well; this must be carefully attended to, and when the fish is a little  browned on one side, turn it over with a tin fish-slice, that it may be  fried on the other side also; and, as soon as done, place the fried fish  on a dish and then fry the others. When all your fish are fried, with  what fat remains in the pan fry some onions, and place them round the  fish, and, by way of adding an extra relish to your meal, just throw a  few table-spoonfuls of vinegar, some pepper and salt, into the  frying-pan, give it a boil up, and pour this round the fish.      No. 122. SALT FISH WITH PARSNIPS.    Salt fish must always be well soaked in plenty of cold water the whole  of the night before it is required for the following day's dinner. The  salt fish must be put on to boil in plenty of cold water, without any  salt, and when thoroughly done, should be well-drained free from any  water, and placed on a dish with plenty of well-boiled parsnips. Some  sauce may be poured over the fish, which is to be made as follows:  viz.--Mix two ounces of butter with three ounces of flour, pepper and  salt, a small glassful of vinegar, and a good half-pint of water. Stir  this on the fire till it boils. A few hard-boiled eggs, chopped up and  mixed in this sauce, would render the dish more acceptable.      No. 123. BAKED FISH.    Wash and wipe the fish, and lay it, heads and tails, in a baking-dish,  the bottom of which has been spread all over with a little butter or  dripping, add a little vinegar and water, and, when procurable, some  mushroom ketchup. Season with chopped onions and parsley, shake plenty  of raspings of bread all over the top of the fish, and bake it in your  oven, or send it to the baker's.      No. 124. BAKED COD'S HEAD.    First, make some stuffing with one pound of bruised crumb of bread,  mixed with six ounces of chopped suet, two eggs, chopped parsley, onions  and thyme, and seasoned with pepper and salt. Put this stuffing inside  the cod's head, and place it in a baking-dish with two ounces of butter,  a gill of vinegar, and a pint and a half of water. Spread a little of  the butter all over the cod's head, and then a thick coating of  bread-raspings all over it; bake it for an hour in the oven. A few  oysters would be an improvement.      No. 125. BOUILLABAISSE SOUP.    Put the following ingredients into a saucepan to boil on the fire:--four  onions and six tomatoes, or red love-apples, cut in thin slices, some  thyme and winter savory, a little salad-oil, a wine-glassful of vinegar,  pepper and salt, and a pint of water to each person. When the soup has  boiled fifteen minutes, throw in your fish, cut in pieces or slices,  and, as soon as the fish is done, eat the soup with some crusts of  bread or toast in it. All kinds of fish suit this purpose.      No. 126. TO BOIL FISH.    Put the fish on in sufficient water to cover it, add a small handful of  salt, and, providing that the fish is not larger than mackerel, soles,  or whiting, it will be cooked by the time that the water boils. Yet it  is always best to try whether it requires to boil a little longer, as  underdone fish is unwholesome. Boiled fish requires some kind of sauce.  Try the following, viz:--      No. 127. PARSLEY SAUCE.    Chop a handful of parsley and mix it in a stewpan with two ounces of  butter, two ounces of flour, pepper and salt; moisten with half a pint  of water and a table-spoonful of vinegar. Stir the parsley-sauce on the  fire till it boils, and then pour it over the fish, drained free from  water, on its dish.      No. 128. ANCHOVY SAUCE.    Mix two ounces of butter with two ounces of flour, in a saucepan. Add a  spoonful of essence of anchovy, and half a pint of water. Stir the sauce  on the fire till it boils.      No. 129. BAKED SKATE.    Chop three onions, and fry them of a light-brown colour in two ounces of  butter, then add half a pint of vinegar, pepper and salt, and allow the  whole to boil on the fire for five minutes. Put the skate in a baking  dish, pour the sauce over it, and also just enough water to reach to its  surface. Strew a thick coating of bread-raspings on the fish, and bake  it for an hour and a half at rather moderate heat.      No. 130. HOW TO BREW YOUR OWN BEER.    The first preparatory step towards brewing is to gather your necessary  plant together in proper working order, and thoroughly clean. Your plant  or utensils must consist of the following articles, viz.:--A  thirty-gallon copper, two cooling-tubs capable of holding each about  thirty gallons; a mash-tub of sufficient size to contain fifty-four  gallons, and another tub of smaller size, called an underback; a bucket  or pail, a wooden hand-bowl, a large wooden funnel, a mash-stirrer, four  scraped long stout sticks, a good-sized loose-wrought wicker basket for  straining the beer, and another small bowl-shaped wicker basket, called  a tapwaist, to fasten inside the mash-tub on to the inner end of the  spigot and faucet, to keep back the grains when the wort is being run  off out of the mash-tub. You will also require some beer barrels, a  couple of brass or metal cocks, some vent-pegs, and some bungs. I do not  pretend to assert that the whole of the foregoing articles are  positively indispensable for brewing your own beer. I merely enumerate  what is most proper to be used; leaving the manner and means of  replacing such of these articles as may be out of your reach very much  to your intelligence in contriving to use such as you possess, or can  borrow from a neighbour, instead. Spring water, from its hardness, is  unfit for brewing; fresh fallen rain water, caught in clean tubs, or  water fetched from a brook or river, are best adapted for brewing; as,  from the fact of their being free from all calcareous admixture, their  consequent softness gives them the greater power to extract all the  goodness and strength from the malt and hops.    In order to ensure having good wholesome beer, it is necessary to  calculate your brewing at the rate of two bushels of malt and two pounds  of hops to fifty-four gallons of water; these proportions, well  managed, will produce three kilderkins of good beer. I recommend that  you should use malt and hops of the best quality only; as their  plentiful yield of beneficial substance fully compensates for their  somewhat higher price. A thin shell, well filled up plump with the  interior flour, and easily bitten asunder, is a sure test of good  quality in malt; superior hops are known by their light greenish-yellow  tinge of colour, and also by their bright, dry, yet somewhat gummy feel  to the touch, without their having any tendency to clamminess. The day  before brewing, let all your tackle be well scrubbed and rinsed clean,  the copper wiped out, and all your tubs and barrels half filled with  cold water, to soak for a few hours, so as to guard against any chance  of leakage, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22117"],[0,"Across Coveted Lands; or, a Journey from Flushing (Holland) to Calcutta Overland (#10)"],[1," 436,800 lbs. above  the quantity exported the previous year (1899); and a comparison between  the quantity exported in 1893 and 1900 will show at a glance the enormous  apparent increase in the export of dried cocoons from Ghilan.    1893       76,160 lbs.     Value    L6,475  1900    1,615,488  \"         \"    L150,265    It must, however, be remembered that the value given for 1893 may be very  incorrect.    Large meadows with cattle grazing upon them; wheat fields, vegetables of  all sorts, vineyards, all pass before my eyes as in a kaleidoscope. A  fine country indeed for farmers. Plenty of water--even too much of  it,--wood in abundance within a stone's throw.    Next to the silk worms, rice must occupy our attention, being the staple  food of the natives of Ghilan and constituting one of the principal  articles of export from that province.    The cultivation and the export of rice from Ghilan have in the last  thirty years become very important, and will no doubt be more so in the  near future, when the mass of jungle and marshes will be cleared and  converted into cultivable land. The Governor-General of Resht is showing  great energy in the right direction by cutting new roads and repairing  old ones on all sides, which ought to be of great benefit to the country.    In Persia, remember, it is not easy to learn anything accurately. And as  for Persian statistics, unwise is the man who attaches any importance to  them. Much as I would like to quote statistics, I cannot refrain from  thinking that no statistics are a hundredfold better than slip-shod,  haphazard, inaccurate ones. And this rule I must certainly apply to the  export of rice from Ghilan to Europe, principally Russia, during 1900,  and will limit myself to general remarks.    Extensive tracts of country have been cleared of reeds and useless  vegetation, and converted into paddy fields, the natives irrigating the  country in a primitive fashion.    It is nature that is mostly responsible if the crops are not ruined year  after year, the thoughtless inhabitants, with their natural laziness,  doing little more than praying Allah to give them plenty of rain, instead  of employing the more practical if more laborious expedient of  artificially irrigating their country in some efficient manner, which  they could easily do from the streams close at hand. Perhaps, in addition  to this, the fact that water--except rain-water--has ever to be purchased  in Persia, may also account to a certain extent for the inability to  afford paying for it. In 1899, for instance, rain failed to come and the  crops were insufficient even for local consumption, which caused the  population a good deal of suffering. But 1900, fortunately, surpassed all  expectations, and was an excellent year for rice as well as cocoons.    We go through thickly-wooded country, then through a handsome forest,  with wild boars feeding peacefully a few yards from the road. About every  six farsakhs--or twenty-four miles--the horses of the carriage, and those  of the fourgon following closely behind, are changed at the  post-stations, as well as the driver, who leaves us, after carefully  removing his saddle from the box and the harness of the horses. He has to  ride back to his point of departure with his horses. He expects a present  of two krans,--or more if he can get it--and so does the driver of the  fourgon. Two krans is the recognised tip for each driver, and as one gets  some sixteen or seventeen for each vehicle,--thirty-two or thirty-four if  you have two conveyances,--between Resht and Teheran, one finds it quite  a sufficient drain on one's exchequer.    As one gets towards Kudum, where one strikes the Sefid River, we begin to  rise and the country gets more hilly and arid. We gradually leave behind  the oppressive dampness, which suggests miasma and fever, and begin to  breathe air which, though very hot, is drier and purer. We have risen 262  feet at Kudum from 77 feet, the altitude of Resht, and as we travel now  in a south-south-west direction, following the stream upwards, we keep  getting higher, the elevation at Rustamabad being already 630 feet. We  leave behind the undulating ground, covered with thick forests, and come  to barren hills, that get more and more important as we go on. We might  almost say that the country is becoming quite mountainous, with a few  shrubs here and there and scenery of moderate beauty, (for any one  accustomed to greater mountains), but quite \"wildly beautiful\" for the  ordinary traveller. We then get to the region of the grey olive groves,  the trees with their contorted, thickly-set branches and pointed leaves.  What becomes of the olives? They are exported to Europe,--a flourishing  trade, I am told.    One bumps a great deal in the carriage, for the springs are not \"of the  best,\" and are hidden in rope bandages to keep them from falling apart.  The road, too, is not as yet like a billiard table. The doors of the  landau rattle continuously, the metal fastenings having long disappeared,  and being replaced by bits of string.    One travels incessantly, baked in the sun by day and chilled by the cold  winds at night, trying to get a little sleep with one's head dangling  over the side of the carriage, one's legs cramped, and all one's bones  aching. But this is preferable to stopping at any of the halting-places  on the road, whether Russian or Persian, which are filthy beyond words,  and where one is mercilessly swindled. Should one, however, be compelled  to stop anywhere it is preferable to go to a thoroughly Persian place,  where one meets at least with more courtesy, and where one is imposed  upon in a more modest and less aggressive way than at the Russian places.  It must, however, be stated that the Russian places are usually in charge  of over-zealous Persians, or else in the hands of inferior Russian  subjects, who try to make all they can out of their exile in the lonely  stations.    I occasionally halted for a glass of tea at the Persian Khafe-Khanas, and  in one of them a very amusing incident happened, showing the serious  effects that hallucination may produce on a weak-minded person.    I had got off the carriage and had carried into the khafe-khana my  camera, and also my revolver in its leather case which had been lying on  the seat of the carriage. At my previous halt, having neglected this  precaution, my camera had been tampered with by the natives, the lenses  had been removed, and the eighteen plates most of them already with  pictures on them--that were inside, exposed to the light and thrown  about, with their slides, in the sand. So to avoid a repetition of the  occurrence, and to prevent a probable accident, I brought all into the  khafe-khana room and deposited the lot on the raised mud portion along  the wall, seating myself next to my property. I ordered tea, and the  attendant, with many salaams, explained that his fire had gone out, but  that if I would wait a few minutes he would make me some fresh _chah_. I  consented. He inquired whether the revolver was loaded, and I said it  was. He proceeded to the further end of the room, where, turning his  back to me, he began to blow upon the fire, and I, being very thirsty,  sent another man to my fourgon to bring me a bottle of soda-water. The  imprisoned gases of the soda, which had been lying for the whole day in  the hot sun, had so expanded that when I removed the wire the cork went  off with a loud report and unfortunately hit the man in the shoulder  blade. By association of ideas he made so certain in his mind that it was  the revolver that had gone off that he absolutely collapsed in a  semi-faint, under the belief that he had been badly shot. He moaned and  groaned, trying to reach with his hand what he thought was the wounded  spot, and called for his son as he felt he was about to die. We supported  him, and gave him some water and reassured him, but he had turned as pale  as death.    \"What have I done to you that you kill me?\" he moaned pitifully.    \"But, good man, you have no blood flowing,--look!\"    A languid, hopeless glance at the ground, where he had fallen and sure  enough, he could find no blood. He tried to see the wound, but his head  could not revolve to a sufficiently wide arc of a circle to see his  shoulder-blade, so in due haste we removed his coat and waistcoat and  shirt, and after slow, but careful, keen examination, he discovered that  not only there were no marks of flowing blood, but no trace whatever of a  bullet hole in any of his garments. Even then he was not certain, and two  small mirrors were sent for, which, by the aid of a sympathising friend,  he got at proper angles minutely to survey his whole back.    He eventually recovered, and was able to proceed with the brewing of tea,  which he served with terribly trembling hand on the rattling saucer under  the tiny little glass.    \"It was a very narrow escape from death, sahib,\" he said in a wavering  voice--\"for it might have been the revolver.\"    There is nothing like backshish in Persia to heal all wounds, whether  real or otherwise, and he duly received an extra handsome one.    In Persia the traveller is particularly struck by the number of Princes  one encounters on the road. This is to a certain extent to be accounted  for by the fact that the word _khan_ which follows a great many Persian  names has been translated, mainly by flattering French authors, into the  majestic but incorrect word \"Prince.\" In many cases the suffix of _khan_  is an equivalent of Lord, but in most cases it is no more than our  nominal \"Esquire.\"    I met on the road two fellows, one old and very dignified; the other  young, and who spoke a little French. He informed me that they were both  Princes. He called his friend \"_Monsieur le Prince, mon ami_,\" and  himself \"_Monsieur le Prince, moi!_\" which was rather amusing. He  informed me that he was a high Customs official, and"]]]
