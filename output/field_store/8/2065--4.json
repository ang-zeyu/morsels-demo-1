She struck yet another match against the wall. It flamed up, and,  surrounded by its light, appeared before her that same dear grandmother,  gentle and loving as always, but bright and happy as she had never  looked during her lifetime.    \"Grandmother!\" exclaimed the child, \"Oh, take me with you! I know you  will leave me as soon as the match goes out. You will vanish like the  warm fire in the stove, like the splendid New Year's feast, like the  beautiful large Christmas tree!\" And she hastily lighted all the  remaining matches in the bundle, lest her grandmother should disappear.  And the matches burned with such a blaze of splendor, that noonday could  scarcely have been brighter. Never had the good old grandmother looked  so tall and stately, so beautiful and kind. She took the little girl in  her arms, and they both flew together--joyfully and gloriously they  flew--higher and higher, till they were in that place where neither  cold, nor hunger, nor pain is ever known--they were in Paradise.    But in the cold morning hour, crouching in the corner of the wall, the  poor little girl was found--her cheeks glowing, her lips smiling--frozen  to death on the last night of the Old Year. The New Year's sun shone on  the lifeless child. Motionless she sat there with the matches in her  lap, one bundle of them quite burnt out.    \"She has been trying to warm herself, poor thing!\" the people said; but  no one knew of the sweet visions she had beheld, or how gloriously she  and her grandmother were celebrating their New Year's festival.          BEAUTY AND THE BEAST    [Illustration]      There was once a Merchant who had three daughters, the youngest of whom  was so beautiful that everybody called her Beauty. This made the two  eldest very jealous; and, as they were spiteful and bad-tempered by  nature, instead of loving their younger sister they felt nothing but  envy and hatred towards her.    [Illustration]    After some years there came a terrible storm at sea, and most of the  Merchant's ships were sunk, and he became very poor. He and his family  were obliged to live in a very small house and do without the servants  and fine clothes to which they had been used. The two eldest sisters did  nothing but weep and lament for their lost fortune, but Beauty did her  best to keep the house bright and cheerful, so that her father might not  miss too much all the comfort and luxury to which he was used.    One day the Merchant told his daughters that he was going to take a  journey into foreign lands in the hope of recovering some of his  property. Then he asked them what they would like him to bring them  home in case he should be successful. The eldest daughter asked for  fine gowns and beautiful clothing; the second for jewels and gold  and silver trinkets.    \"And Beauty--what would Beauty like?\" asked the father.    Beauty was so happy and contented always that there was scarcely  anything for which she longed. She thought for a moment, then she said:    [Illustration]    \"I should like best of all a red rose!\" The other sisters burst out  laughing and scoffed at Beauty's simple request; but her father promised  to bring her what she wanted. Then he said good-bye to his children and  set out on his travels.    He was away for nearly a year, and was so fortunate as to win back a  great part of his lost wealth. When the time came for his return, he  was easily able to buy the things his eldest daughters wished for; but  nowhere could he find a red rose to take home to Beauty, and at last he  was obliged to set off without one.    When he was within a few miles journey of his home, he lost himself in  a thick wood. Darkness came on, and he began to be afraid that he would  have to pass the night under a tree, when suddenly he saw a bright light  shining in the distance. He went towards it, and on his approach found  it came from a great castle that was set right in the heart of the  forest.    The Merchant made up his mind to ask if he might spend the night there;  but to his surprise, when he reached the door he found it set wide open,  and nobody about. After awhile, finding that no one came in answer to  his repeated knocking, he walked inside. There he found a table laid  with every delicacy, and, being very hungry, he sat down and made a  good repast. After he had finished his supper he laid himself down  on a luxurious couch, and in a few minutes was fast asleep.    In the morning, after eating a hearty breakfast, which he found prepared  for him, he left the mysterious castle, without having set eyes on a  single person. As he was passing through the garden he found himself in  an avenue of rose-trees, all covered with beautiful red roses.    [Illustration]    \"Here are such thousands of flowers,\" he said to himself, \"that, surely,  one bud will not be missed;\" and, thinking of Beauty, he broke off a  rose from one of the bushes.    [Illustration]    Scarcely had he done so when he heard a terrible noise, and, turning  round, he saw coming towards him a hideous Beast, who exclaimed in an  awful tone:    \"Ungrateful wretch! You have partaken of my hospitality, have eaten of  my food, have slept in my house, and in return you try to rob me of my  roses. For this theft you shall die!\"    The Merchant fell on his knees and begged for pardon, but the Beast  would not listen to him.    \"Either you must die now, or else you must swear to send me in your  stead the first living thing that meets you on your return home,\" he  said; and the Merchant, overcome with terror, and thinking that one of  his dogs would be sure to be the first creature to greet him, gave his  promise.    But to his horror and dismay, it was his youngest daughter, Beauty, who  first ran out to greet him on his return. She had seen him coming from  afar, and hastened to welcome him home.    She did not at first understand her father's grief at seeing her; but  when he told her the story of the Beast and his promise she did her  best to comfort him.    \"Do not fear, dear father,\" she said, \"perhaps the Beast will not prove  so terrible as he looks. He spared your life; he may spare mine, since I  have done him no harm.\"    Her father shook his head mournfully; but there was no help for it. He  had promised to send the Beast the first living creature that met him  on his return, so he was obliged to send Beauty herself in his place.    [Illustration]    When he left Beauty at the palace of the Beast she found everything  prepared for her comfort and convenience. A beautiful bedchamber was  ready for her use; the rooms were filled with everything that she could  possibly want, and in the great hall of the castle a table was set with  every delicacy. And everywhere there were bowls full of red roses. No  servants were visible; but there was no lack of service, for invisible  hands waited upon her and attended to her every want. She had but to  wish, and whatever she wanted was at once placed before her.    Beauty was filled with astonishment at all this luxury and magnificence.    \"Surely the Beast does not wish to harm me,\" she thought, \"or he would  never have so ordered everything for my comfort.\" And she waited with a  good courage for the coming of the Lord of the Castle.    In the evening the beast appeared. He was certainly very terrible to  look at, and Beauty trembled at the sight of the hideous monster. But  she forced herself to appear brave, and, indeed, there was no cause for  her alarm. The Beast was kindness itself, and so gentle and respectful  in his attentions to her that Beauty soon lost all fear. She soon became  very fond of him, and would have been quite happy had it not been for  the thought of her father and sisters, and the grief which she knew her  father would be suffering on her account. The thought of his sorrow made  her sorrowful too; and one night, when the Beast came to visit her at  his usual hour, she was so sad that he asked her what was the matter.    Then Beauty begged him to let her go and visit her father. The Beast was  very unwilling to grant her request.    \"If I let you go, I am afraid you will never come back to me,\" he said,  \"and then I shall die of grief.\"    Beauty promised most earnestly to come back to him if he would only  allow her to spend a few days with her family; and at last the Beast  yielded to her entreaties.    [Illustration]    He gave her a ring, saying:    \"Put this on your little finger when you go to bed to-night, and wish;  and in the morning you will find yourself at home in your father's  house. But if you do not return to me at the end of a week, I shall  die of sorrow.\"    Beauty's father was almost overcome with joy at seeing his daughter  again, and he was delighted to hear of her happiness and good fortune.  But her two sisters--who in the meantime had married--were more jealous  than ever of their beautiful sister. They were not very happy with their  husbands, who were poor and not over-lovable; and they were very envious  of Beauty's clothes and of all the luxuries with which she told them she  was surrounded. They tried to think of a plan by which they could  prevent their sister from enjoying her good fortune.    \"Let us keep her beyond the week that the Beast has allowed her,\" they  said; \"then, doubtless, he will be so angry that he will kill her.\"    So they pretended to be very fond of Beauty, and when the time came for  her return, they overwhelmed her with tears and caresses, begging her  not to leave them, and to stay at least one more day with them. Beauty  was distressed at their grief, and at last she consented to stay just  one more day; though her heart misgave her sorely when she thought of  the poor Beast.

By T. H. HUXLEY,  F.R.S., Professor of Natural History, Government School of Mines.    [Read June 3rd, 1858.]      Some time ago my friend Dr. Sinclair, of New Zealand, had the kindness  to offer me two specimens of the Pearly Nautilus which had been brought  to him from New Caledonia, preserved in Goadby's solution. I gladly  accepted the present, and looked forward to the dissection of the rare  animal with no little pleasure; but on proceeding to examine one of the  specimens, I found its anatomical value greatly diminished by the manner  in which a deposit from the solution had glued together some of the  internal viscera. Other parts of the Nautilus, however, were in a very  good state of preservation; and I have noted down such novel and  interesting peculiarities as they presented, in the hope that an account  of them will be acceptable to the Linnean Society.    Of the six apertures which, besides the genital and anal outlets, open  into the branchial cavity of _Nautilus pompilius_, one on each side lies  immediately above and in front of that fold of the inner wall of the  mantle which forms the lower root of the smaller and inner gill, and  encloses the branchial vein of that gill. The aperture is elongated and  narrow, with rather prominent lips. It measures about 1/8th of an inch.    The other two apertures are larger, and lie at a distance of 7/16ths of  an inch below and behind the other. They are in close juxta-position,  being separated only by a thin triangular fold of membrane, which  constitutes the inner lip of the one and the outer lip of the other.    The inner aperture is the larger, measuring 3/16ths of an inch in long  diameter, and having the form of a triangle with its base directed  posteriorly. The outer aperture is not more than 1/8th of an inch long.  The two apertures lie just above the edge of the fold of membrane which  runs from the inner root of the larger or outer branchia, across the  branchial cavity and beneath the rectum, to the other side.    These apertures lead into five sacs, which collectively constitute what  has been described as the pericardium. The sacs into which the superior  apertures open, by a short wide canal with folded walls, are situated on  each side of and above the rectum. Their inner boundaries are separated  by a space of not less than 5/8ths of an inch in width, in which lie  the vena cava and the oviduct. Each cavity has a rounded circumference,  and a transverse diameter of about half an inch. In a direction at right  angles to this diameter the dimensions vary with its state of  distension; but a quarter of an inch would be a fair average.    The anterior or outer wall of the cavity is formed by the mantle; the  posterior, inner, or visceral wall by a delicate membrane. The former  separates it from the branchial cavity; the latter from the fifth sac,  to be described by-and-by. I could find no natural aperture in the thin  inner wall, so that I conceive no communication can take place between  either of these sacs and the fifth sac.    Two irregular, flattened, brownish, soft plates depend from the  posterior wall of the sac into its cavity; their attached edges are  fixed along a line which is directed from behind obliquely forwards and  upwards.    The outer and smaller of the inferior apertures on each side leads into  a sac of similar dimensions and constitution to the preceding, but  having a less rounded outline in consequence of its being flattened in  one direction against its fellow of the opposite side, from which it is  separated only by a delicate membranous wall, whilst on another side it  is applied against the inferior wall of the superior sac, and is in like  manner separated from it only by a thin and membranous partition.    Like the upper sacs, each of these has two dark-brown, lamellar,  glandular masses depending from its membranous visceral wall.    A delicate, but broad, triangular membranous process, about 1/4th of an  inch long, hangs down freely from the visceral wall of the cavity just  behind the opening of the short canal which connects the sac with its  aperture.    The third and largest aperture on each side opens directly into a very  large fifth cavity, whose boundary is formed anteriorly by the visceral  walls of the sacs already described, and behind this by the mantle  itself as far as the horny band which marks and connects the insertion  of the shell-muscles.    In fact this cavity may be said to be co-extensive with the attached  part of the mantle,--the viscera, enclosed within their delicate  \"peritoneal\" membranous coat, projecting into and nearly filling it, but  nevertheless leaving a clear space between themselves and the delicate  posterior wall of the mantle.    A layer of the \"peritoneal\" membrane extends from the posterior edge of  the muscular expansion which lies between the shell-muscles and from the  upper wall of the dilatation of the vena cava, and passes upwards and  backwards like a diaphragm to the under surfaces of the gizzard and  liver. It is traversed by the aorta, to whose coats it closely adheres.    Along a line nearly corresponding with the horny band which proceeds  from the insertions of the shell-muscles and encircles the mantle below,  the pallial wall is produced inwards and forwards into a membranous fold  or ligament, which I will call the pallio-visceral ligament; and this  pallio-visceral ligament becoming attached to various viscera, divides  the great fifth chamber into an anterior inferior, and a posterior  superior portion, which communicate freely with one another.    Commencing with its extreme right-hand end, the ligament is inserted  into the line of reflection of the mantle, and then into the wall of the  oviduct, which becomes enclosed as it were within the ligament. The  latter then ends in a free edge on the inner side of the oviduct, and is  continued along it until it reaches the inferior surface of the apex of  the ovary, into which it is inserted.    The free edge is arcuated; and the rectum passes over it, but is in no  way connected with it.    Here, therefore, is one great passage of communication between the  anterior and posterior divisions of the fifth chamber.    On the left side, this aperture is limited by the heart, whose posterior  edge is, on the left side, connected by means of a ligamentous band with  the surface of the apex of the ovary; but on the right, for the greater  part of its extent, receives a process of the pallio-visceral ligament.  Between the ovario-cardiac ligament and this process lies the small oval  aperture already described by Professor Owen, which gives passage to the  siphonal artery. It constitutes the middle aperture of communication  between the two divisions of the fifth chamber.    The left-hand end of the ligament is inserted into the upper wall of the  dilated end of the vena cava; but between this point and the heart it  has a free arcuated edge, as on the right side.    Thus there are in reality three apertures of communication between the  two divisions of the fifth chamber, the middle, by far the smallest,  being alone hitherto known.    A delicate membranous band passes from the whole length of the middle  line of the rectum to the heart and to the ovary.    The singular \"pyriform appendage\" of the heart lies in the left process  of the ligament, its anterior edge nearly following the arcuated contour  of that process.    The siphuncular process of the mantle was broken in my specimen; but  its aperture appeared to communicate quite freely with the posterior  division of the fifth chamber.    Four sets of brownish, glandular-looking bodies depend into the anterior  division of the fifth chamber, from parts of the delicate septa dividing  this from the four small sacs, corresponding with the insertions of the  glandular bodies above described.    In fact, on distending the vena cava with air, it is found that the four  branchial arteries traverse these septa, and that the appendages in  question are diverticula of their walls. Consequently the anterior wall  of each branchial vein is produced into two glandular appendages, which  hang into one of the four smaller sacs, while the posterior wall is  produced into a single mass of appendages, which hangs into the anterior  division of the fifth chamber.    Although, as I believe, the five chambers do not communicate directly,  all the appendages must nevertheless be equally bathed with sea-water,  which enters by the apertures of the chambers.    An impacted yellowish-white concretionary matter filled the anterior  chamber; and a small quantity of it lay as a fine powder at the bottom  of the posterior one. In the latter, however, its presence might, by  possibility, have been accidental. My colleague, Dr. Percy, who kindly  undertook to examine this substance, informs me that he has been unable  to detect uric acid in it. The follicular appendages of the branchial  arteries present remarkable differences in their external appearance.  The eight which hang into the four anterior chambers are similar,  slightly festooned, but otherwise simple lamellae; while the four which  depend into the posterior chambers are produced into a number of  papillary processes. This external difference is obvious enough: whether  it be accompanied by a corresponding discrepancy in minute structure I  am unable to say; for I have not as yet been able to arrive at any  satisfactory results from the microscopic examination of the altered  tissues, and, as will be seen below, the only observer who has had the  opportunity "]]]
