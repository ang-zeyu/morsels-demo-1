In presence of the entire Zawia he bade both sons climb  a tall palm-tree, and then adjured them by Allah and his Prophet to leap  to the ground. The younger lad leaped at once and reached the ground  unharmed; the elder boy refused to spring. To El Mahdi, \"who feared not  to commit himself to the will of God,\" passed the right to rule.  Throughout his long life Sennussi-el-Mahdi justified his father's  choice, displaying wisdom and piety of a high order, and further  extending the power of the fraternity. During the latter part of his  reign he removed his headquarters to the oasis of Jowf, still farther  into the Lybian desert, where he died in 1902, and was succeeded by his  nephew, Ahmed-el-Sherif, the present head of the Order, who also appears  to possess marked ability.    With nearly eighty years of successful activity behind it, the Sennussi  Order is to-day one of the vital factors in Islam. It counts its  adherents in every quarter of the Moslem world. In Arabia its followers  are very numerous, and it profoundly influences the spiritual life of  the holy cities, Mecca and Medina. North Africa, however, still remains  the focus of Sennussism. The whole of northern Africa, from Morocco to  Somaliland, is dotted with its Zawias, or lodges, all absolutely  dependent upon the Grand Lodge, headed by The Master, El Sennussi. The  Sennussi stronghold of Jowf lies in the very heart of the Lybian Sahara.  Only one European eye[33] has ever seen this mysterious spot. Surrounded  by absolute desert, with wells many leagues apart, and the routes of  approach known only to experienced Sennussi guides, every one of whom  would suffer a thousand deaths rather than betray him, El Sennussi, The  Master, sits serenely apart, sending his orders throughout North Africa.    The influence exerted by the Sennussiya is profound. The local Zawias  are more than mere \"lodges.\" Besides the Mokaddem, or Master, there is  also a \"Wekil,\" or civil governor, and these officers have discretionary  authority not merely over the Zawia members but also over the community  at large--at least, so great is the awe inspired by the Sennussiya  throughout North Africa, that a word from Wekil or Mokaddem is always  listened to and obeyed. Thus, besides the various European colonial  authorities, British, French, or Italian, as the case may be, there  exists an occult government with which the colonial authorities are  careful not to come into conflict.    On their part, the Sennussi are equally careful to avoid a downright  breach with the European Powers. Their long-headed, cautious policy is  truly astonishing. For more than half a century the order has been a  great force, yet it has never risked the supreme adventure. In many of  the fanatic risings which have occurred in various parts of Africa,  local Sennussi have undoubtedly taken part, and the same was true during  the Italian campaign in Tripoli and in the late war, but the order  itself has never officially entered the lists.    In fact, this attitude of mingled cautious reserve and haughty aloofness  is maintained not only towards Christians but also towards the other  powers that be in Islam. The Sennussiya has always kept its absolute  freedom of action. Its relations with the Turks have never been cordial.  Even the wily Abdul Hamid, at the height of his prestige as the champion  of Pan-Islamism, could never get from El Sennussi more than coldly  platonic expressions of approval, and one of Sennussi-el-Mahdi's  favourite remarks was said to have been: \"Turks and Christians: I will  break both of them with one and the same stroke.\" Equally characteristic  was his attitude toward Mahommed Ahmed, the leader of the \"Mahdist\"  uprising in the Egyptian Sudan. Flushed with victory, Mahommed Ahmed  sent emissaries to El Sennussi, asking his aid. El Sennussi refused,  remarking haughtily: \"What have I to do with this fakir from Dongola? Am  I not myself Mahdi if I choose?\"    These Fabian tactics do not mean that the Sennussi are idle. Far from  it. On the contrary, they are ceaselessly at work with the spiritual  arms of teaching, discipline, and conversion. The Sennussi programme is  the welding, first, of Moslem Africa and, later, of the whole Moslem  world into the revived \"Imamat\" of Islam's early days; into a great  theocracy, embracing all True Believers--in other words, Pan-Islamism.  But they believe that the political liberation of Islam from Christian  domination must be preceded by a profound spiritual regeneration. Toward  this end they strive ceaselessly to improve the manners and morals of  the populations under their influence, while they also strive to improve  material conditions by encouraging the better cultivation of oases,  digging new wells, building rest-houses along the caravan routes, and  promoting trade. The slaughter and rapine practised by the Sudanese  Mahdists disgusted the Sennussi and drew from their chief words of  scathing condemnation.    All this explains the Order's unprecedented self-restraint. This is the  reason why, year after year and decade after decade, the Sennussi  advance slowly, calmly, coldly; gathering great latent power, but  avoiding the temptation to expend it one instant before the proper time.  Meanwhile they are covering North Africa with their lodges and schools,  disciplining the people to the voice of their Mokaddems and Wekils; and,  to the southward, converting millions of pagan negroes to the faith of  Islam.[34]    Nothing better shows modern Islam's quickened vitality than the revival  of missionary fervour during the past hundred years. Of course Islam has  always displayed strong proselytizing power. Its missionary successes in  its early days were extraordinary, and even in its period of decline it  never wholly lost its propagating vigour. Throughout the Middle Ages  Islam continued to gain ground in India and China; the Turks planted it  firmly in the Balkans; while between the fourteenth and sixteenth  centuries Moslem missionaries won notable triumphs in such distant  regions as West Africa, the Dutch Indies, and the Philippines.  Nevertheless, taking the Moslem world as a whole, religious zeal  undoubtedly declined, reaching low-water mark during the eighteenth  century.    The first breath of the Mohammedan Revival, however, blew the  smouldering embers of proselytism into a new flame, and everywhere  except in Europe Islam began once more advancing portentously along all  its far-flung frontiers. Every Moslem is, to some extent, a born  missionary and instinctively propagates his faith among his non-Moslem  neighbours, so the work was carried on not only by priestly specialists  but also by multitudes of travellers, traders, and humble migratory  workers.[35] Of course numerous zealots consecrated their lives to the  task. This was particularly true of the religious fraternities. The  Sennussi have especially distinguished themselves by their apostolic  fervour, and from those natural monasteries, the oases of the Sahara,  thousands of \"Marabouts\" have gone forth with flashing eyes and swelling  breasts to preach the marvels of Islam, devoured with a zeal like that  of the Christian mendicant friars of the Middle Ages. Islam's  missionary triumphs among the negroes of West and Central Africa during  the past century have been extraordinary. Every candid European observer  tells the same story. As an Englishman very justly remarked some twenty  years ago: \"Mohammedanism is making marvellous progress in the interior  of Africa. It is crushing paganism out. Against it the Christian  propaganda is a myth.\"[36] And a French Protestant missionary remarks in  similar vein: \"We see Islam on its march, sometimes slowed down but  never stopped, towards the heart of Africa. Despite all obstacles  encountered, it tirelessly pursues its way. It fears nothing. Even  Christianity, its most serious rival, Islam regards without hate, so  sure is it of victory. While Christians dream of the conquest of Africa,  the Mohammedans do it.\"[37]    The way in which Islam is marching southward is dramatically shown by a  recent incident. A few years ago the British authorities suddenly  discovered that Mohammedanism was pervading Nyassaland. An investigation  brought out the fact that it was the work of Zanzibar Arabs. They began  their propaganda about 1900. Ten years later almost every village in  southern Nyassaland had its Moslem teacher and its mosque hut. Although  the movement was frankly anti-European, the British authorities did not  dare to check it for fear of repercussions elsewhere. Many European  observers fear that it is only a question of time when Islam will cross  the Zambezi and enter South Africa.    And these gains are not made solely against paganism. They are being won  at the expense of African Christianity as well. In West Africa the  European missions lose many of their converts to Islam, while across  the continent the ancient Abyssinian Church, so long an outpost against  Islam, seems in danger of submersion by the rising Moslem tide. Not by  warlike incursions, but by peaceful penetration, the Abyssinians are  being Islamized. \"Tribes which, fifty or sixty years ago, counted hardly  a Mohammedan among them, to-day live partly or wholly according to the  precepts of Islam.\"[38]    Islam's triumphs in Africa are perhaps its most noteworthy missionary  victories, but they by no means tell the whole story, as a few instances  drawn from other quarters of the Moslem world will show. In the previous  chapter I mentioned the liberal movement among the Russian Tartars.  That, however, was only one phase of the Mohammedan Revival in that  region, another phase being a marked resurgence of proselyting zeal.

One of the most typical stories of colonial methods of \"matching\" among  fine gentlefolk is found in the worry of Emanuel Downing, a man of  dignity in the commonwealth, and of his wife, Lucy (who was Gov.  Winthrop's sister), in regard to the settlement of their children.  Downing begins with anxious overtures to Endicott in regard to \"matching  his sonne\" to an orphan maid living in Endicott's family, a maid who it  is needless to state had a very pretty fortune. Downing states that he  has been blamed for not marrying off his children earlier, \"that none  are disposed of,\" and deplores his ill-luck in having them so long on  his hands, and he recounts pathetically his own and his son's good  points. He also got Governor Winthrop to write to Endicott pleading the  match. Endicott answered both letters in a most dignified manner,  stating his objections to furthering Downing's wishes, giving a  succession of reasons, such as the maid's unwillingness to marry, being  but fifteen years of age, his own awkward position in seeming to crowd  marriage upon her when she was so rich, etc., etc. The Downings had  hoped to have thriftily two marriages in the family in one day, but the  daughter Luce's affairs also halted. She had been enamoured of a Mr.  Eyer, an unsuitable match. He had put out to sea, to the Downings'  delight, but had returned at an unlucky time when she was on with a  fresh suitor. Her mother was much distressed because, though Luce  declared she much liked Mr. Norton, she still showed to all around her  that \"she hath not yet forgotten Mr. Eyer his fresh Red.\"    But Mistress Luce, by a telling statement of pecuniary benefits, was  brought to a proper mind and became \"verie sensible of loseing fair  opportunities,\" and consented speedily to wed Norton, to her father's  abounding joy, who wrote, \"shee may stay long ere she meet with a better  vnless I had more monie for her than I now can spare.\" The betrothal was  formally announced, when shortly a distressed letter from Madam Downing  shows foul weather ahead. Luce had been talking among her friends,  giving to them \"unjust suspicions of the enforcement to her of Mr.  Norton,\" and while she had seemed to love Mr. Eyer, and her family had  eagerly striven to win her regard from him, \"we now suspect by her late  words her affections to be now inclininge at Jhon Harrold.\" It was found  that Jhon had \"practised upon her and disturbed her,\" and that while she  was \"free and cheerful\" with Lover Norton, \"passing conversation\" with  him, she was really conspiring to jilt him. The mother wrote sadly: \"I  am sorrie my daughter Luce hath caryed things thus vnwisely and  vnreputably both to herselfe and our friends;\" and the whole family were  evidently sorely afraid that the \"perverse Puritan jade\" would be left  on their hands, when suddenly came the news of her marriage to Norton,  owing perhaps to a very decided and sharp letter from Norton's brother  to the Governor about Mistress Luce's vagaries, and also to some more  satisfactory and liberal marriage settlements. She probably made as  devoted a wife to him as if she had never longed for Eyer his fresh red,  nor Jhon his disturbments.    Nor were these upright and pious Puritan magistrates and these  gentlewomen of Boston and Salem the only colonists who displayed such  sordid and mercenary bargaining and stipulating in matrimonial ventures:  numberless letters and records throughout New England prove the  unvarying spirit of calculation that pervaded fashionable courtship. A  bride's portion was openly discussed, her marriage settlement carefully  decided upon, and even agreements for bequests were arranged as  \"incurredgment to marriage.\" Nor did happy husbands hesitate to sue for  settlement too tardy or too remiss fathers-in-law who failed to keep  their word about the bride's portion: Edward Palmes for years harassed  the Winthrops about their sister's (his first wife's) portion, long  after he had married a second partner.    Though the tender passion walked thus ceremoniously and coldly in narrow  and carefully selected paths in town, in the country it regarded little  the bounds of reserve or regard for appearances. Much comparative  grossness prevailed. The mode of courting, known as \"bundling\" or  \"tarrying\" was too prevalent in colonial times to be ignored. A full  description of its extent, and an attempt to trace its origin, have been  given in a book on the subject prepared by Dr. H. R. Stiles, and with  much fairness in a pamphlet by Charles Francis Adams on \"Some Phases of  Sexual Morality and Church Discipline in Colonial New England.\"    Its existence has been a standing taunt for years against New England,  and its prevalence has been held up as a proof of a low state of  morality in early New England society. Indeed, it was strange it could  so long exist in so austere and virtuous a colony; that it did, to a  startling extent, must be conceded; much proof is found in the books of  contemporary writers. Rev. Andrew Burnaby, who travelled in New England  in 1759-1760, says that though it may \"at first appear to be the effects  of grossness of character, it will upon deeper research be found to  proceed from simplicity and innocence.\" To this assertion, after some  research, I can give--to use Sir Thomas Browne's words--\"a staggering  assent to the affirmative, not without some fear of the negative.\" Rev.  Samuel Peters, in his General History of Connecticut, speaks at length  upon the custom, and apparently endeavors to prove that it was a very  prudent and Christian fashion. Jonathan Edwards raised his powerful  voice against it. It prevailed apparently to its fullest extent on Cape  Cod, and longest in the Connecticut valley, where many Dutch customs  were introduced and much intercourse with the Dutch was carried on. In  Pennsylvania, among the Dutch and German settlers and their descendants,  it lingered long; it was a matter of Court record as late as 1845. Yet  the custom of bundling has never been held to be a result of copying the  similar Dutch \"queesting,\" which in Holland met with the sanction of  the most circumspect Dutch parents; and tergiversating Diedrich  Knickerbocker even asserted the contrary assumption, that the Dutch  learned of it from the Yankees. In Holland, as now in Wales and then in  New England, the custom arose not from a low state of morals, nor from a  disregard of moral appearances, but from the social and industrial  conditions under which such courting was done. The small size and  crowded occupancy of the houses, the alternative waste of lights and  fuel, the hours at which the hurried courtship must be carried on, all  led to the recognition and endurance of the custom; and in its open  recognition lay its redeeming feature. There was no secrecy, no thought  of concealment; the bundling was done under the supervision of mother  and sisters.    As a contrast to all this laxity of behaviour, let me state that in the  very locality where it obtained--the Connecticut Valley--other  sweethearts are said to have been forced to a most ceremonious  courtship, to whisper their tender nothings through a \"courting-stick,\"  a hollow stick about an inch in diameter and six or eight feet long,  fitted with mouth- and ear-pieces. In the presence of the entire family,  lovers, seated formally on either side of the great fireplace, carried  on this chilly telephonic love-making. One of these batons of propriety  still is preserved in Longmeadow, Mass.    Of this primitive colony with primitive manners some very extraordinary  cases of bucolic love at first sight are recorded--love that did not  follow the law of pounds, shillings, and pence. At an ordination in  Hopkinton, New Hampshire, a country bumpkin forgot the place, the  preacher, and the preaching, in the ravishing sight of an unknown damsel  whom he saw for the first time within the meeting-house. He sat  entranced through the long sermon, the tedious psalm-singings, the  endless prayers, until at last the services were over. In an ecstasy of  uncouth and unreasoning passion he rushed out of church, forced his way  through the departing congregation, seized the unknown fair one in his  arms crying out, \"Now I have got ye, you jade, I have! I have!\" And from  so startling and unalluring a beginning, a marriage followed. In a  neighboring community a dignified officer of the law went to \"warn out  of town\" a strange \"transient woman\" who might become a pauper, and  would then have to be kept at the town's expense, were this ceremony  omitted. Terrified at the majesty of the law and its grand though  incomprehensible wording, the young warned one burst into tears, which  so worked upon the tender-hearted officer that he (being conveniently a  widower) proposed to her offhand, was called in meeting, married her,  and thus took her under his own and the town's protection. More than one  case of \"marriage at first sight\" is recounted, of bold Puritan wooers  riding up to the door of a fair one whom they had never seen, telling  their story of a lonely home, forlorn housekeeping, and desired  marriage, giving their credentials, obtaining a hasty consent, and  sending in their \"publishings\" to the town clerk, all within a day's  time.    The \"matrimonial\" advertisement did not appear till 1759. In the _Boston  Evening Post_ of February 23d of that year, this notice, for its novelty  and boldness, must have caused quite a heart-fluttering among Boston  \"thornbacks\" who would try to pass for the desired age:         \"To the Ladies. Any young Lady between the Age of Eighteen and       twenty three of a Midling Stature; brown Hair, regular Features and       a Lively Brisk Eye: Of Good Morals & not Tinctured with anything       that may Sully so Distinguishable a Form possessed of 3 or 400L       entirely her own "]]]
