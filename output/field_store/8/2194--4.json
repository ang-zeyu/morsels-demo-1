Mignon merely lifted her thin shoulders. \"I can't please every one. If I  did, I should never please myself.\"    \"I don't know what ails Jerry all of a sudden,\" commented Muriel to  Marjorie. \"She isn't usually so--so funny.\"    Again Marjorie kept her own counsel. She, alone, knew that the object of  the rumor which Muriel and Mignon had started had failed. Ellen Seymour  had gone frankly to headquarters with it, and Miss Archer had asked no  questions. Marjorie wondered what these girls would say if they knew  the truth. She did not like to criticize them, but were they truly  honorable? For a moment she wished she had refused to play on the team  with them. Muriel and Mignon, in particular, seemed so careless of other  people's feelings.    Her sympathies were with Jerry, and quickening her pace she slipped her  arm through that of the fat girl, saying, \"Don't you think to-morrow's  algebra lesson is hard?\"    Jerry viewed her companion's smiling face rather sulkily. Then  succumbing to the other's charm, she said in a mollified tone: \"Of  course it's hard. They're all hard. I know I shall never pass in  algebra.\"    \"Oh, yes, you will,\" was Marjorie's cheerful assurance. \"It's my hardest  study, too; but I'm going to pass my final examination in it. I've  simply made up my mind that I must do it.\"    \"Then I'll make up my mind to pass, too,\" announced Jerry, inspired by  Marjorie's determined tones. \"And, say, it would be splendid if we could  do our lessons together sometimes. My mother likes me to bring my school  friends home.\"    \"So does mine,\" returned Marjorie, cordially. \"She says home is the  place for me to entertain my schoolmates. I hope you will come to see me  soon. It's your turn first, you know. Oh, please pardon me a moment, I  must speak to this girl!\" The cause of this sudden exclamation was a  young woman in a well-worn blue suit who was coming across the street  directly ahead of them.    \"Oh, Constance!\" hailed Marjorie, \"I have been looking for you. Stop a  minute!\" Marjorie stood waiting for her friend with eager face and  outstretched hand. By this time the four other girls had come abreast of  the trio and had passed them, Irma Linton being the only one of them who  bowed to Constance. Jerry stood beside Marjorie for an instant, then  walked on and overtook her chums.    \"Please don't stop,\" begged Constance, her face expressing the liveliest  worry. \"Really, you mustn't try to be friends with me. I wish to take  back my part of our compact. You've been chosen to play on the team, and  those girls seem to like you. I can't stand in your way, and my  friendship won't be worth anything to you, so just let's forget all we  said the other day.\"    Marjorie stared hard at the other girl, the pathetic droop of whose lips  looked for all the world like Mary's when things went wrong. \"You don't  mean that, and I won't give you up,\" she said with fine stubbornness. \"I  haven't time to talk about it now. I must catch up with those girls.  Wait for me at our locker to-morrow noon, please, _please_.\"    With a hasty squeeze of Constance's hand, Marjorie raced on up the  street to overtake her companions. They were so busily engaged in  discussing her, however, that they did not hear her approach, and  consequently did not lower their voices.    \"I will not speak to her; I will not play with her on the team!\" she  heard Mignon La Salle sputter angrily.    \"We certainly don't care to bother with her if she's going to take up  with all sorts of low people.\" This loftily from Muriel, who was afraid  to cross the French girl.    \"My mother told me never to speak to any of those crazy Stevens  persons,\" added Susan Atwell, with a toss of her curly head. \"I don't  care so very much for this Dean girl, either.\"    \"Oh, you make me tired, the whole lot of you,\" cried Jerry, with angry  contempt. \"Marjorie Dean is nicer than all of you put together, and if  she likes that little white-faced Stevens girl, then the girl is all  right, even if her family were ragpickers. I'm ashamed of myself for  being so silly as to listen to any of Mignon's complaints against her.  You can do as you like, but if it's a case of being your friend or  Marjorie's, then I guess I'd rather be hers.\"    \"Thank you, Geraldine.\" Marjorie's quiet voice caused the party to turn,  then exchange sheepish glances. \"I don't wish you to quarrel over me,\"  she went on. \"I should like to be friends with all of you, but none of  you can choose my friends for me any more than I can choose yours for  you.\"    \"You can't chum with us and be the friend of that Miss Stevens,\"  muttered Mignon. \"She is my enemy. Do you understand?\"    \"I am sorry to hear that,\" returned Marjorie, keeping her temper with  difficulty, \"but she is not mine. I like her. I shall stand up for her  and be her friend as long as we go to Sanford High School. I am sorry to  seem disagreeable, but I shouldn't feel the least bit true to myself if  I were afraid to say what I think. This is my street. Good-bye.\"    Marjorie walked proudly away from the group. An instant and she heard  the patter of running feet behind her.    \"You can't get rid of us so easily,\" panted Geraldine Macy.    \"I think you are right, Marjorie,\" said Irma Linton, quietly, putting  out her hand. \"I should like to be your friend.\"    And the dividing of the sextette of girls was the dividing of the  freshman class of Sanford High School.          CHAPTER IX    A BITTER MOMENT      Marjorie went soberly up the steps of her home that afternoon. Her  pleasure in making the team had been short-lived. She wondered if it  would not be better to write her resignation. How could she bear to play  on a team when three of the members had decided to drop her  acquaintance? Still, they had not chosen her to play on the team; why,  then, should she resign? She decided to consult her captain on the  subject; then changed her mind. She would not trouble her mother with  such petty grievances. This prejudice against Constance Stevens had  originated wholly with Mignon La Salle. Perhaps the French girl would  soon forget it, and it would die a natural death. Marjorie was not  mortally hurt over the turn of the afternoon's affairs. She had not been  so deeply impressed with the importance of Mignon and her friends that  she failed to see their snobbish tendencies. She made mental exception  of Jerry and Irma. She was secretly glad that they had declared for her.  She liked Jerry's blunt independence and Irma's gentle, lovable  personality. With the optimism of sixteen, she declined to worry over  what had happened, and her report to her captain at the end of that  troubled afternoon included only the pleasant events of the day.    When she went to school the next Monday morning she discovered that it  did hurt, just a trifle, to be deliberately cut by the Picture Girl,  and, instead of being greeted with Susan Atwell's dimpled smile, to  receive an icy stare from that young woman, as, later in the morning,  they passed each other in the corridor.    In some mysterious manner the story of the disagreement had been noised  about the freshman class, with the result that Marjorie's acquaintance  was eagerly sought by a number of freshmen whom she knew merely by  sight, and that several girls, who had made it a point to smile and nod  to her, now passed her, frigid and unsmiling.    As for the members of the little group Marjorie had watched so earnestly  before she had been enrolled as a freshman at Sanford, they were now  divided indeed. As the week progressed the \"Terrible Trio,\" as Jerry had  satirically named Mignon, Muriel and Susan, endeavored to make plain to  whoever would listen to them that there was but one side to the story,  namely, their side. Emulating Marjorie's example, Jerry and Irma had  taken particular pains to be friendly with Constance Stevens. After an  eloquent dissertation on friendship, delivered by Marjorie at their  locker on the Monday morning following her disagreement with the other  girls, Constance had shed a few happy tears and admitted that she had  rather be \"best friends\" with Marjorie than anyone else in the world.    The hardest part of it all for Marjorie was her basketball practice. It  was dreadful to be on speaking terms with only one girl on the team,  Harriet Delaney, and she was not overly cordial. Marjorie tried to  remember that Miss Randall had appointed her to her position, that the  right to play was hers; but the unfriendly players made her nervous, and  she lost her usual snap and daring. The second week's practice came, and  she resolved to play up to her usual form, but, try as she might, she  fell far short of the promise she had shown at the tryout. She also  noted uneasily that, no matter how early she reported for practice, the  team seemed always to be in the gymnasium before her and that one of the  substitutes invariably held her position.    The freshmen had challenged the sophomores to play against them on the  first Saturday afternoon in November. It was now the latter part of  October and both teams were utilizing as much of their spare time as  possible in preparing for the fray.    \"Are you going to practice this afternoon?\" whispered Geraldine Macy to  Marjorie as they left the algebra class on Monday morning.    Marjorie nodded.    \"Oh, dear,\" grumbled Jerry under her breath. \"I wanted to talk to you  about the Hallowe'en party.\"    \"What Hallowe'en party?\" asked Marjorie, opening her eyes.    \"Haven't you your invitation?\" It was Jerry's turn to look surprised.    \"I don't even know what you're talking about.\"    Their entrance into the study hall put an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23650"],[0,"Ten Boys from History (#10)"],[1,"th, and again his challenge rang through the valley; and  as always when Goliath was seen or heard, the men of Israel turned away  and fled in terror. But not so David. He was thrilled at the sight of  the mighty giant and asked the men who stood by him:    \"What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine and taketh  away the reproach of Israel? For who is this Philistine that he should  defy the armies of the living God?\"    And the men answered him that Saul had promised riches and honour and  his daughter's hand in marriage to him who should kill Goliath.    And Eliab, David's oldest brother, listened while David questioned the  men, and being very angry at David's presence, said bitterly:    \"Why camest thou down hither, and with whom hast thou left those few  sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride and the naughtiness of thy  heart, for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.\"    But David, instead of showing anger at such an unkind speech, merely  answered:    \"What have I _now_ done? Is there not a cause,\" and paying no further  attention to Eliab, turned away, asking every man he met the same  question he had asked before, until finally his persistency attracted  so much attention, that Saul was told about this lad who was showing  such unusual interest in the rewards to be given for facing Goliath in  battle, and Saul at once sent for David, who by this time was flushed  with excitement, and with the contagious enthusiasm of the battlefield,  and he answered Saul like an old and mighty soldier.    \"Let no man's heart fail because of him. Thy servant will go and fight  with this Philistine.\"    Think of it, a slender inexperienced young shepherd lad taking up a  challenge like that of Goliath!    Saul was astonished at David's words, and exclaimed, \"Thou art not able  to go against this Philistine and fight him, for thou art but a youth,  and he a man of war from his youth.\"    Throwing his shoulders back, and standing with head held high and eyes  bright with determination, David answered proudly:    \"I kept my father's sheep, and there came a lion and a bear and took a  lamb out of the flock, and I went out after him, and delivered it out  of his mouth, and when he rose against me, I caught him by the beard  and smote him and slew him. The Lord that delivered me out of the paw  of the lion and the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this  Philistine.\"    For a moment Saul looked in silent awe at this brave young  warrior--then in a voice trembling with admiration and with emotion, he  said with solemn emphasis:    \"Go, and the Lord be with thee.\"    And then roused by the contagion of David's fearless enthusiasm, and by  the excitement of trusting a mere boy to give battle to the great  Goliath, Saul, with his own hand, dressed David in his own suit of  armour for the encounter, giving him his heavy coat of mail, his  glittering brass helmet, and even bound his own sword at David's side.  At first David's delight was great that he was wearing the armour of a  real warrior. But when he tried to walk or run, the heavy coat of mail  hindered him and the weight of the sword and helmet made him feel like  a captive in chains, and at last he cast them off, saying to Saul:    \"I cannot go with these.\"    And although Saul showed his consternation at this young champion of  the Israelites against Goliath, going to battle without armour or  sword, he made no attempt to persuade David into doing other than as he  desired. And David stood before him again, this time, wearing his  simple shepherd's dress, and feeling both free and happy again. Then  taking up his staff, he went to a near-by brook and from its bed picked  out five smooth white stones,--notice how careful he was to choose  smooth stones. These he put in a bag which hung at his side, and then  with only his sling in his hand, he advanced towards the giant, who  having heard that David had accepted his challenge, had advanced to  meet him in all his power and show of glittering armour and weapons.    Now Goliath had not heard of David's youth, and when he saw that his  adversary was only a fair strong boy, the giant grew scornful, and  seeing David's staff and sling, he shouted contemptuously in a voice  that rang from ridge to ridge, across the great valley:    \"Am I a _dog_ that thou comest to me with stones?\" adding:    \"Come with me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and  to the beasts of the fields.\"    But David paid no heed to the scorn, but sturdy and strong he stood and  faced Goliath, answering:    \"Thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield, but  _I_ come to thee in the name of the Lord of Hosts, the God of the  armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied. This day will the Lord deliver  thee with my hand and take thine head from thee, and I will give the  carcasses of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and the  wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a  God in Israel, and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth  not with sword and spear, for the battle is the Lord's and he will give  you into our hands.\"    A pretty long speech and a pretty decided statement to be made by a  shepherd-boy--was it not? David's positive assurance that he could kill  Goliath, and that God was with the army of Israel, showed the boy to be  no ordinary boy, carried away by warlike enthusiasm.    Goliath heard with mighty contempt and anger, the retort of David and  his taunt, and advanced in all his power and glory towards him, while  David, never taking his eyes off the giant's face, quietly put his hand  in his bag, slowly took out one of the stones he had so carefully  selected, and slung it with the unerring aim for which he was famous.    With fatal accuracy it struck Goliath between the eyes. The mighty  giant groaned, and fell--slain by the hand of David, who, as he had no  sword of his own, hastily knelt on Goliath's body, drew his sword from  its sheath, and with it cut off the giant's head, and stripped him of  his valuable armour, to carry to Bethlehem as a trophy.    [Illustration: _David and Goliath_]    David, so young, so inexperienced in the art of war, had killed the  champion of the enemy. It seemed incredible. Through the ranks of both  armies the news spread like wildfire, and when the Philistines realised  what had happened, they were so terrified for fear of what might  follow, that they fled, with the victorious Israelites in hot pursuit,  who with cheers and shouts and great slaughter pursued them to the  nearest city, and then returned to despoil the tents of the vanquished  enemy, singing loud songs of triumph.    And then David, flushed with victory, came before Saul carrying with  him the head of the giant. It is easy to picture Saul's absolute  astonishment when he realised that the conquering hero of his army was  this mere youth, so unlike his other warriors.    But he talked long and eagerly with David, asking all sorts of  questions about his manner of slaying Goliath, and while they talked,  Jonathan, Saul's son, stood near them, listening and watching, and as  he heard David's stirring tale of victory, he was filled with  admiration for the boy who had done such a mighty deed; and, in that  instant, as the Bible says, \"the soul of Jonathan was knit with the  soul of David,\" and the friendship of David and Jonathan was begun.  David's eyes flashed back an answering glance of interest to the King's  son, and there was a quick response of each to the other. And that  being so, you can imagine the joy of both the youths when Saul told  David that he was to go no more home to his father's house to tend his  flocks, but was to be thereafter his armour-bearer, or the member of  his household who came into the closest relation with the king. On  hearing this great piece of news, David glanced proudly at Jonathan,  and Jonathan at once led David away and took from him his shepherd's  dress, and clothed him in his own garments, giving him even his girdle  and his sword, which was the greatest honour he could have conferred on  David, the sign that he felt David had, by his courageous act, proved  himself more worthy to be the heir to a throne, than he, the king's own  son, was. And, too, he felt such a thrill of affection for this new  friend, David, that he could not help doing something to show it. And  then and always, Jonathan's friendship for David was absolutely free  from all taint of jealousy, and he always stood aside, that honours  might be heaped upon his friend, even those which by the rights of  inheritance, should have been his own.    And so David began his new life at the court of Saul, with Jonathan,  his new friend, and the first happy days passed only too quickly. David  went out wherever Saul sent him, doing the King's bidding so well and  so wisely that Saul set him in command over his men of war, who all  gladly obeyed David. Although he was so young, he ruled so tactfully  that all the people, and even Saul's ministers grew more and more fond  of the youth who had killed Goliath, while Jonathan rejoiced in every  honour paid to his friend, and had not one bit of envy in his heart,  that David was so popular and so powerful. But Saul was less noble in  nature than Jonathan his son was, and when one day, not long after  David had killed Goliath, the men, women and children from all the  cities of Israel, trooped out to meet King Saul, singing and dancing  and playing musical instruments in celebration of David's victory, and  the women sang--    \"Saul hath slain his thousands and David his ten thousands.\"    This made Saul very angry and very jealous, for it was a revelation of  the strength of the national feeling against him, and as he heard the  shrill chant he exclaimed with fierce jealousy:    \"They have ascribed unto David his ten thousands and to me they have  ascribed but"]]]
