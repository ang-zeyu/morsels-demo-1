With the object of quieting the  discontent which prevailed, he invited a considerable number of the  Saxon chiefs to take part in the Christmas festival, which was kept  with unusual splendour; and he also caused a proclamation to be read  in all the churches of the capital declaring it to be his will that  \"all the citizens of London should enjoy their national laws as in the  days of King Edward.\" But his policy of friendship and conciliation  was soon changed into one of cruelty and oppression.    At the instigation of Swein, the King of Denmark, who appeared in the  Humber with a fleet, the people in the north of England and in some  other parts rose in revolt against the rule of the Conqueror in 1068.  So skilfully had the revolt been planned that even William was taken  by surprise. While he was hunting in the Forest of Dean he heard of  the loss of York and the slaughter of his garrison of 3,000 Normans,  and resolved to avenge the disaster. Proceeding to the Humber with his  horsemen, by a heavy bribe he got the King of Denmark to withdraw his  fleet; then, after some delay, spent in punishing revolters in the  Welsh border, he attacked and took the city of York. The land in  Durham and Northumberland was still quite unsubdued, and some of  William's soldiers had fared badly in their attempts to take  possession. At the Christmas feast of 1068 William made a grant of the  earldom of Northumberland to Robert of Comines, who set out with a  Norman army to take possession. But he fared no better than his  predecessors had done. The men of the land determined to withstand  him, but through the help of Bishop AEthelwine he entered Durham  peaceably. But he let his men plunder, so the men of the city rose and  slew him and his followers. And now, says Freeman,[16] William \"did  one of the most frightful deeds of his life. He caused all Northern  England, beginning with Yorkshire, to be utterly laid waste, that its  people might not be able to fight against him any more. The havoc was  fearful; men were starved or sold themselves as slaves, and the land  did not recover for many years. Then King William wore his crown and  kept his Christmas at York\" (1069).    Now the Conqueror set barons in different parts of the country, and  each of them kept his own miniature court and celebrated Christmas  after the costly Norman style. In his beautiful poem of \"The Norman  Baron\" Longfellow pictures one of these Christmas celebrations, and  tells how--     \"In the hall, the serf and vassal    Held, that night, their Christmas wassail;    Many a carol, old and saintly,        Sang the minstrels and the waits.      And so loud these Saxon gleemen    Sang to slaves the songs of freemen,    That the storm was heard but faintly        Knocking at the castle-gates.      Till at length the lays they chaunted    Reached the chamber terror-haunted,    Where the monk, with accents holy,        Whispered at the baron's ear.      Tears upon his eyelids glistened    As he paused awhile and listened,    And the dying baron slowly        Turned his weary head to hear.     'Wassail for the kingly stranger    Born and cradled in a manger!    King, like David, priest, like Aaron,        Christ is born to set us free!'\"    [Illustration: MINSTRELS' CHRISTMAS SERENADE AT AN OLD BARONIAL HALL.]    According to Strutt, the popular sports and pastimes prevalent at the  close of the Saxon era were not subjected to any material change by  the coming of the Normans. But William and his immediate successors  restricted the privileges of the chase, and imposed great penalties on  those who presumed to destroy the game in the royal forests without a  proper license. The wild boar and the wolf still afforded sport at the  Christmas season, and there was an abundance of smaller game. Leaping,  running, wrestling, the casting of darts, and other pastimes which  required bodily strength and agility were also practised, and when the  frost set in various games were engaged in upon the ice. It is not  known at what time skating made its first appearance in England, but  we find some traces of such an exercise in the thirteenth century, at  which period, according to Fitzstephen, it was customary in the  winter, when the ice would bear them, for the young citizens of London  to fasten the leg bones of animals under the soles of their feet by  tying them round their ankles; and then, taking a pole shod with iron  into their hands, they pushed themselves forward by striking it  against the ice, and moved with celerity equal, says the author, to a  bird flying through the air, or an arrow from a cross-bow; but some  allowance, we presume, must be made for the poetical figure: he then  adds, \"At times, two of them thus furnished agree to start opposite  one to another, at a great distance; they meet, elevate their poles,  attack, and strike each other, when one or both of them fall, and not  without some bodily hurt; and, even after their fall, are carried a  great distance from each other, by the rapidity of the motion, and  whatever part of the head comes upon the ice it is sure to be laid  bare.\"    The meetings of the King and his Wise Men for the consideration of  state affairs were continued at the great festivals, and that held at  Christmas in 1085 is memorable on account of the resolution then  passed to make the Domesday survey, in reference to which Freeman  says: \"One of the greatest acts of William's reign, and that by which  we come to know more about England in his time than from any other  source, was done in the assembly held at Gloucester at the Christmas  of 1085. Then the King had, as the Chronicle says, 'very deep speech  with his Wise Men.' This 'deep speech' in English is in French  _parlement_; and so we see how our assemblies came by their later  name. And the end of the deep speech was that commissioners were sent  through all England, save only the Bishopric of Durham and the earldom  of Northumberland, to make a survey of the land. They were to set down  by whom every piece of land, great and small, was held then, by whom  it was held in King Edward's day, what it was worth now, and what it  had been worth in King Edward's day. All this was written in a book  kept at Winchester, which men called _Domesday Book_. It is a most  wonderful record, and tells us more of the state of England just at  that moment than we know of it for a long time before or after.\"    The Domesday Book was completed in 1086, and the following year  (1087) William the Conqueror died, and his son, William Rufus,  succeeded him.    [Illustration: WESTMINSTER HALL.]      THE CORONATION OF WILLIAM THE RED    took place at Westminster on September 26, 1087, Archbishop Lanfranc  officiating. The King kept his first Christmas sumptuously at  Westminster, and, Freeman says, \"it seems to have been then that he  gave back the earldom of Kent to his uncle, Bishop Odo.\" The character  of the Royal Christmases degenerated during the reign of Rufus, whose  licentiousness fouled the festivities. In the latter part of his reign  Rufus reared the spacious hall at Westminster, where so many Royal  Christmases were afterwards kept, and which Pope calls      \"Rufus's roaring hall.\"    It is a magnificent relic of the profuse hospitality of former times.  Richard the Second heightened its walls and added its noble roof of  British oak, which shows the excellence of the wood carving of that  period. Although Sir Charles Barry has shortened the Hall of its  former proportions to fit it as a vestibule to the New Houses of  Parliament, it is still a noble and spacious building, and one cannot  walk through it without in imagination recalling some of the Royal  Christmases and other stately scenes which have been witnessed there.  The last of these festal glories was the coronation of George the  Fourth, which took place in 1821. This grand old hall at Westminster  was the theatre of Rufus's feasting and revelry; but, vast as the  edifice then was, it did not equal the ideas of the extravagant  monarch. An old chronicler states that one of the King's courtiers,  having observed that the building was too large for the purposes of  its construction, Rufus replied, \"This halle is not begge enough by  one half, and is but a bedchamber in comparison of that I mind to  make.\" Yet this hall was for centuries the largest of its kind in  Europe, and in it the Christmas feasts were magnificently kept.    After a reign of thirteen years the vicious life of William Rufus met  with a tragical close. His dead body was found by peasants in a glade  of the New Forest with the arrow either of a hunter or an assassin in  his breast. Sir Walter Tyrrel, a Norman knight, who had been hunting  with the king just before his death, fled to Normandy immediately  afterwards, and was suspected of being a regicide. The body of Rufus  was buried in Winchester Cathedral.      CHRISTMAS IN THE REIGN OF HENRY I.    Henry the First's Christmas festival at Windsor, in 1126, was a  memorable one. In that year Henry's daughter Matilda became a widow by  the death of her husband, Henry V. of Germany, and King Henry  determined to appoint her his successor to the throne of England and  the Dukedom of Normandy. On Christmas Day, 1126, a general assembly of  the nobles and higher ecclesiastics of the kingdom was held at Windsor  for the purpose of declaring the Empress Matilda (as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22065"],[0,"An Elementary Spanish Reader (#10)"],[1,"=cuento= _m._ story    =cuestión= _f._ question    =cuidado= _m._ care;
