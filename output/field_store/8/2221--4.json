He referred to the  organization of Louisiana under his plan of amnesty and reconstruction,  and in speaking of it he gave the history of his policy. He said:    In my annual message of December, 1863, and accompanying the  Proclamation, I presented a plan of reconstruction, as the phrase  goes, which I promised if adopted by any State, would be acceptable and  sustained by the Executive Government of this Nation. I distinctively  stated that this was a plan which might possibly be acceptable, and also  distinctively protested that the Executive claimed no right to say when  or whether members should be admitted to seats in Congress from such  States.    The new constitution of Louisiana, (said Mr. Lincoln) declaring  emancipation for the whole State, practically applies the Proclamation  to that part previously exempted. It does not adopt apprenticeship for  freed people, and is silent, as it could not well be otherwise, about  the admission of members to Congress. As it applied to Louisiana, every  member of the Cabinet approved the plan of the message. * * * Now, we  find Mr. Lincoln, just before his death; referring in warm and strong  terms to his policy of amnesty and reconstruction, and giving it  his endorsement; giving to the world that which had never been given  before--the history of that plan and policy--stating that it had been  presented and endorsed by every member of that able and distinguished  Cabinet of 1863. Mr. Lincoln may be said to have died holding out to the  Nation his policy of amnesty and reconstruction. It was held out by him  at the very time the rebels laid down their arms. Mr. Lincoln died by  the hand of an assassin and Mr. Johnson came into power. He took Mr.  Lincoln's Cabinet as he had left it and he took Mr. Lincoln's policy of  amnesty and reconstruction as he had left it, and as he had presented  it to the world only two days before his death. MR. JOHNSON HAS HONESTLY  AND FAITHFULLY ATTEMPTED TO ADMINISTER THAT POLICY, which had been  bequeathed by that man around whose grave a whole world has gathered as  mourners. I refer to these for the purpose of showing that Mr. Johnson's  policy is not a new one, but that he is simply carrying out a policy  left to him by his lamented predecessor--a policy that had been ENDORSED  BY THE WHOLE NATION IN THE REELECTION OF MR. LINCOLN.    Again Gov. Morton said:    An impression has gotten abroad in the North that Mr. Johnson has  devised some new policy by which improper facilities are granted for the  restoration of the rebel States and that he is presenting improperly and  unnecessarily hurrying forward the work of reconstruction, and that  he is offering improper facilities for restoring those who have been  engaged in rebellion, to the possession of their civil and political  rights. It is one of my purposes here this evening to show that so  far as his policy of amnesty and reconstruction is concerned, he has  absolutely presented nothing new, that he has simply presented, and is  SIMPLY CONTINUING THE POLICY WHICH MR. LINCOLN PRESENTED TO THE NATION  ON THE 8TH OF DECEMBER, 1863.    The following are extracts from Mr. Johnson's Message to Congress, in  December, 1865, on the re-assembling of that body--the first session of  the 39th Congress. Indicating, as it did, a policy of reconstruction at  variance with the views of the Congressional leaders, it may be said  to have been another incident out of which arose the conditions that  finally, led to his impeachment. Mr. Johnson said:    I found the States suffering from the effects of a civil war. Resistance  to the General Government appeared to have exhausted itself. The United  States had recovered possession of its forts and arsenals, and their  armies were in the occupation of every State which had attempted to  secede. Whether the territory within the limits of those States should  be held as conquered territory, under Military authority emanating from  the President as head of the Army, was the first question that presented  itself for decision. Military Governments, established for an indefinite  period, would have offered no security for the early suppression of  discontent; would have divided the people into the vanquishers and the  vanquished; and would have envenomed hatred rather than have restored  affection. Once established, no precise limit to their continuance was  conceivable. They would have occasioned an incalculable and exhausting  expense. * * * The powers of patronage and rule which would have been  exercised, under the President, over a vast and populous and naturally  wealthy region, are greater than, under a less extreme necessity, I  should be willing to entrust to any one man. They are such as, for  myself, I should never, unless on occasion of great emergency, consent  to exercise. The wilful use of such powers, if continued through  a period of years, would have endangered the purity of the General  Administration and the liberty of the States which remained loyal. * * *  The policy of military rule over conquered territory would have implied  that the States whose inhabitants may have taken part in the rebellion  had, by the act of those inhabitants, ceased to exist. But the  true theory is, that ALL PRETENDED ACTS OF SECESSION WERE, FROM THE  BEGINNING, NULL AND VOID. THE STATES CAN NOT COMMIT TREASON, nor screen  the individual citizens who may have committed treason, any more than  they can make valid treaties, or engage in lawful commerce with any  foreign power. The States attempting to secede placed themselves in a  condition where their vitality was IMPAIRED, BUT NOT EXTINGUISHED--THEIR  FUNCTIONS SUSPENDED, BUT NOT DESTROYED.    Reports had been circulated in the North, and found ready credence with  a great many, that the people of the South were as a rule, insubordinate  and indisposed to accept the changed conditions there, and that  insubordination and turmoil were the rule. To ascertain the facts in  this regard, during the later months of 1865 Mr. Johnson commissioned  General Grant and others to make a tour of inspection and investigation  of the condition of affairs in the Southern States, especially as to  their disposition with reference to the acceptance by the people of  those States, of their changed relations to the Union, and to report to  him the results of their observations.    On the 10th of December, 1865, on motion of Mr. Cowan, of Pennsylvania,  the following resolution was adopted by the Senate:    Resolved, That the President of the United States be, and he is hereby  requested to furnish the Senate information of the state of that  portion of the Union lately in rebellion; whether the rebellion has been  suppressed and the United States put again in possession of the States  in which it existed; whether the United States courts are restored, post  offices re-established and the revenue collected; and also whether the  people of those States have reorganized their State governments, and  whether they are yielding obedience to the laws and Government of the  United States. And at the same time furnish to the Senate copies of such  reports as he may have received from such officers or agents appointed  to visit that portion of the Union.    December 19th, 1865, in response to this resolution of the Senate, the  President transmitted the following Message to the Senate inclosing Gen.  Grant's Report:    In reply to the resolution adopted by the Senate on the 12th inst., I  have the honor to state that the rebellion waged by a portion of the  people against the properly constituted authorities of the Government  of the United States has been suppressed; that the United States are in  possession of every State in which the insurrection existed; and that,  as far as could be done, the courts of the United States have been  restored, postoffices re-established, and steps taken to put into  effective operation the revenue laws of the country. As the result of  the measures instituted by the Executive, with the view of inducing a  resumption of the functions of the States comprehended in the inquiry  of the Senate, the people in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,  Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee, have  reorganized their respective State Governments, and 'are yielding their  obedience to the laws and Government of the United States' with more  willingness and greater promptitude than under the circumstances  could reasonably have been anticipated. The proposed amendment to the  Constitution, providing for the abolition of slavery forever within the  limits of the country, has been ratified by each one of those States,  with the exception of Mississippi, from which no official information  has yet been received; and in nearly all of them measures have  been adopted or are now pending, to confer upon freedmen rights  and privileges which are essential to their comfort, protection and  security. In Florida and Texas, the people are making considerable  progress in restoring their State Governments, and no doubt is  entertained that they will at the Federal Government. In that portion of  the Union lately in rebellion, the aspect of affairs is more promising  than, in view of all the circumstances, could have been expected. The  people throughout the entire South evince a laudable desire to renew  their allegiance to the Government, and to repair the devastations of  war by a prompt and cheerful return to peaceful pursuits. An abiding  faith is entertained that their actions will conform to their  professions, and that, in acknowledging the supremacy of the  Constitution and laws of the United States, their loyalty will be given  unreservedly to the Government; whose leniency they cannot fail to  appreciate, and whose fostering care will soon restore them to a  condition of prosperity.

Midnight was the favorite hour, a full moon was helpful, and  Good Friday was the best date. Joe would sometimes stand by, directing  the digging with a wand. The utmost silence was necessary to success.  More than once, when the digging proved a failure, Joe explained to his  associates that, just as the deposit was about to be reached, some one,  tempted by the devil, spoke, causing the wished-for riches to disappear.  Such an explanation of his failures was by no means original with  Smith, the serious results of an untimely spoken word having been long  associated with divers magic performances. Joe even tried on his New  York victims the Pennsylvania device of requiring the sacrifice of  a black sheep to overcome the evil spirit that guarded the treasure.  William Stafford opportunely owned such an animal, and, as he puts  it, \"to gratify my curiosity,\" he let the Smiths have it. But some new  \"mistake in the process\" again resulted in disappointment. \"This, I  believe,\" remarks the contributor of the sheep, \"is the only time they  ever made money-digging a profitable business.\" The Smiths ate the  sheep.    These money-seeking enterprises were continued from 1820 to 1827 (the  year of the delivery to Smith of the golden plates). This period  covers the years in which Joe, in his autobiography, confesses that  he \"displayed the corruption of human nature.\" He explains that his  father's family were poor, and that they worked where they could find  employment to their taste; \"sometimes we were at home and sometimes  abroad.\" Some of these trips took them to Pennsylvania, and the stories  of Joe's \"gazing\" accomplishment may have reached Sidney Rigdon, and  brought about their first interview. Susquehanna County was more thinly  settled than the region around Palmyra, and Joe found persons who were  ready to credit him with various \"gifts\"; and stories are still current  there of his professed ability to perform miracles, to pray the frost  away from a cornfield, and the like.*         * Lippincott's Magazine, August, 1880.        CHAPTER IV. -- FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE GOLDEN BIBLE    Just when Smith's attention was originally diverted from the discovery  of buried money to the discovery of a buried Bible engraved on gold  plates remains one of the unexplained points in his history. He was  so much of a romancer that his own statements at the time, which were  carefully collected by Howe, are contradictory. The description given of  the buried volume itself changed from time to time, giving strength in  this way to the theory that Rigdon was attracted to Smith by the rumor  of his discovery, and afterward gave it shape. First the book was  announced to be a secular history, says Dr. Clark; then a gold Bible;  then golden plates engraved; and later metallic plates, stereotyped or  embossed with golden letters.* Daniel Hendrix's recollection was that  for the first few months Joe did not claim the plates any new revelation  or religious significance, but simply that they were a historical record  of an ancient people. This would indicate that he had possession of the  \"Spaulding Manuscript\" before it received any theological additions.         * \"Gleanings by the Way,\" p. 229.      The account of the revelation of the book by an angel, which is accepted  by the Mormons, is the one elaborated in Smith's autobiography, and  was not written until 1838, when it was prepared under the direction of  Rigdon (or by him). Before examining this later version of the story, we  may follow a little farther Joe's local history at the time.    While the Smiths were conducting their operations in Pennsylvania, and  Joseph was \"displaying the corruption of human nature,\" they boarded for  a time in the family of Isaac Hale, who is described as a \"distinguished  hunter, a zealous member of the Methodist church,\" and (as later  testified to by two judges of the Court of Common Pleas of Susquehanna  County)\" a man of excellent moral character and of undoubted veracity.\"*  Mr. Hale had three daughters, and Joe received enough encouragement to  his addresses to Emma to induce him to ask her father's consent to their  marriage. This consent was flatly refused. Mr. Hale made a statement  in 1834, covering his knowledge of Smith and the origin of the Mormon  Bible.** When he became acquainted with the future prophet, in 1825, Joe  was employed by the so-called \"money-diggers,\" using his \"peek-stone.\"  Among the reasons which Mr. Hale gave for refusing consent to the  marriage was that Smith was a stranger and followed a business which he  could not approve.         * Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" p. 266.         ** Ibid., p. 262.      Joe thereupon induced Emma to consent to an elopement, and they were  married on January 18, 1827, by a justice of the peace, just across  the line in New York State. Not daring to return to the house of his  father-in-law, Joe took his wife to his own home, near Palmyra, New  York, where for some months he worked again with his father.    In the following August Joe hired a neighbor named Peter Ingersol to  go with him to Pennsylvania to bring from there some household effects  belonging to Emma. Of this trip Ingersol said, in an affidavit made in  1833:--    \"When we arrived at Mr. Hale's in Harmony, Pa., from which place he  had taken his wife, a scene presented itself truly affecting. His  father-in-law addressed Joseph in a flood of tears: 'You have stolen  my daughter and married her. I had much rather have followed her to her  grave. You spend your time in digging for money--pretend to see in a  stone, and thus try to deceive people.' Joseph wept and acknowledged  that he could not see in a stone now nor never could, and that his  former pretensions in that respect were false. He then promised to give  up his old habits of digging for money and looking into stones. Mr. Hale  told Joseph, if he would move to Pennsylvania and work for a living,  he would assist him in getting into business. Joseph acceded to this  proposition, then returned with Joseph and his wife to Manchester....    \"Joseph told me on his return that he intended to keep the promise which  he had made to his father-in-law; 'but,' said he, it will be hard for  me, for they [his family] will all oppose, as they want me to look in  the stone for them to dig money'; and in fact it was as he predicted.  They urged him day after day to resume his old practice of looking in  the stone. He seemed much perplexed as to the course he should pursue.  In this dilemma he made me his confidant, and told me what daily  transpired in the family of Smiths.    \"One day he came and greeted me with joyful countenance. Upon asking the  cause of his unusual happiness, he replied in the following language:  'As I was passing yesterday across the woods, after a heavy shower of  rain, I found in a hollow some beautiful white sand that had been washed  up by the water. I took off my frock and tied up several quarts of it,  and then went home. On entering the house I found the family at the  table eating dinner. They were all anxious to know the contents of  my frock. At that moment I happened to think about a history found in  Canada, called a Golden Bible;* so I very gravely told them it was the  Golden Bible. To my surprise they were credulous enough to believe what  I said. Accordingly I told them I had received a commandment to let  no one see it, for, says I, no man can see it with the natural eye and  live. However, I offered to take out the book and show it to them, but  they refused to see it and left the room. 'Now,' said Joe, 'I have got  the d--d fools fixed and will carry out the fun.' Notwithstanding he  told me he had no such book and believed there never was such book, he  told me he actually went to Willard Chase, to get him to make a chest in  which he might deposit the Golden Bible. But as Chase would not do it,  he made the box himself of clapboards, and put it into a pillow-case,  and allowed people only to lift it and feel of it through the case.\"**         * The most careful inquiries bring no information that any such  story was ever current in Canada.         ** Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" p. 234.      In line with this statement of Joe to Ingersol is a statement which  somewhat later he made to his brother-in-law, Alva Hale, that \"this  'peeking' was all d--d nonsense; that he intended to quit the business  and labor for a livelihood.\"*         * Ibid., p. 268.      Joe's family were quite ready to accept his statement of his discovery  of golden plates for more reasons than one. They saw in it, in the first  place, a means of pecuniary gain. Abigail Harris in a statement (dated  \"11th mo., 28th, 1833\") of a talk she had with Joe's father and mother  at Martin Harris's house, said:--    \"They [the Smiths] said the plates Joe then had in possession were but  an introduction to the Gold Bible; that all of them upon which the Bible  was written were so heavy that it would take four stout men to load them  into a cart; that Joseph had also discerned by looking through his stone  the vessel in which the gold was melted from which the plates were made,  and also the machine with which they were rolled; he also discovered in  the bottom of the vessel three balls of gold, each as large as his fist.  The old lady said also that after the book was translated, the plates  were to be publicly exhibited, admission 25 cts.\"*         * Ibid, p. 253.      But aside from this pecuniary view, the idea of a new Bible would have  been eagerly accepted by a woman like Mrs. Smith, and a mere intimation  by Joe of such a discovery would have given him, in her, an instigator  to the carrying out of the plot. It is said that she had predicted that  she was to be the mother of a prophet. She tells us that although, in  Vermont, she was a diligent church attendant, she found all preachers  unsatisfactory, and that she reached"]]]
