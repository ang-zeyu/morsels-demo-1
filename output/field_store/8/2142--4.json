But the woman had had enough of Golova-ing; from that time    forward she took to obeying her husband.    Before passing on to another subject, it may be advisable to quote one  of the stories in which the value of a good and wise wife is fully  acknowledged. I have chosen for that purpose one of the variants of a  tale from which, in all probability, our own story of \"Whittington and  his Cat\" has been derived. With respect to its origin, there can be  very little doubt, such a feature as that of the incense-burning  pointing directly to a Buddhist source. It is called--        THE THREE COPECKS.[56]      There once was a poor little orphan-lad who had nothing at all    to live on; so he went to a rich moujik and hired himself out to    him, agreeing to work for one copeck a year. And when he had    worked for a whole year, and had received his copeck, he went to    a well and threw it into the water, saying, \"If it don't sink, I'll    keep it. It will be plain enough I've served my master faithfully.\"      But the copeck sank. Well, he remained in service a second    year, and received a second copeck. Again he flung it into the    well, and again it sank to the bottom. He remained a third year;    worked and worked, till the time came for payment. Then his    master gave him a rouble. \"No,\" says the orphan, \"I don't    want your money; give me my copeck.\" He got his copeck and    flung it into the well. Lo and behold! there were all three copecks    floating on the surface of the water. So he took them and    went into the town.      Now as he went along the street, it happened that some small    boys had got hold of a kitten and were tormenting it. And he    felt sorry for it, and said:      \"Let me have that kitten, my boys?\"      \"Yes, we'll sell it you.\"      \"What do you want for it?\"      \"Three copecks.\"      Well the orphan bought the kitten, and afterwards hired    himself to a merchant, to sit in his shop.      That merchant's business began to prosper wonderfully. He    couldn't supply goods fast enough; purchasers carried off everything    in a twinkling. The merchant got ready to go to sea,    freighted a ship, and said to the orphan:      \"Give me your cat; maybe it will catch mice on board, and    amuse me.\"      \"Pray take it, master! only if you lose it, I shan't let you off    cheap.\"      The merchant arrived in a far off land, and put up at an inn.    The landlord saw that he had a great deal of money, so he gave    him a bedroom which was infested by countless swarms of rats    and mice, saying to himself, \"If they should happen to eat him    up, his money will belong to me.\" For in that country they knew    nothing about cats, and the rats and mice had completely got the    upper hand. Well the merchant took the cat with him to his    room and went to bed. Next morning the landlord came into    the room. There was the merchant alive and well, holding the    cat in his arms, and stroking its fur; the cat was purring away,    singing its song, and on the floor lay a perfect heap of dead rats    and mice!      \"Master merchant, sell me that beastie,\" says the landlord.      \"Certainly.\"      \"What do you want for it?\"      \"A mere trifle. I'll make the beastie stand on his hind legs    while I hold him up by his forelegs, and you shall pile gold    pieces around him, so as just to hide him--I shall be content    with that!\"      The landlord agreed to the bargain. The merchant gave him    the cat, received a sackful of gold, and as soon as he had settled    his affairs, started on his way back. As he sailed across the    seas, he thought:      \"Why should I give the gold to that orphan? Such a lot of    money in return for a mere cat! that would be too much of a    good thing. No, much better keep it myself.\"      The moment he had made up his mind to the sin, all of a sudden    there arose a storm--such a tremendous one! the ship was    on the point of sinking.      \"Ah, accursed one that I am! I've been longing for what    doesn't belong to me; O Lord, forgive me a sinner! I won't    keep back a single copeck.\"      The moment the merchant began praying the winds were    stilled, the sea became calm, and the ship went sailing on prosperously    to the quay.      \"Hail, master!\" says the orphan. \"But where's my cat?\"      \"I've sold it,\" answers the merchant; \"There's your money,    take it in full.\"      The orphan received the sack of gold, took leave of the    merchant, and went to the strand, where the shipmen were.    From them he obtained a shipload of incense in exchange for    his gold, and he strewed the incense along the strand, and burnt    it in honor of God. The sweet savor spread through all that    land, and suddenly an old man appeared, and he said to the    orphan:      \"Which desirest thou--riches, or a good wife?\"      \"I know not, old man.\"      \"Well then, go afield. Three brothers are ploughing over    there. Ask them to tell thee.\"      The orphan went afield. He looked, and saw peasants tilling    the soil.      \"God lend you aid!\" says he.      \"Thanks, good man!\" say they. \"What dost thou want?\"      \"An old man has sent me here, and told me to ask you which    of the two I shall wish for--riches or a good wife?\"      \"Ask our elder brother; he's sitting in that cart there.\"      The orphan went to the cart and saw a little boy--one that    seemed about three years old.      \"Can this be their elder brother?\" thought he--however he    asked him:      \"Which dost thou tell me to choose--riches, or a good wife?\"      \"Choose the good wife.\"      So the orphan returned to the old man.      \"I'm told to ask for the wife,\" says he.      \"That's all right!\" said the old man, and disappeared from    sight. The orphan looked round; by his side stood a beautiful    woman.      \"Hail, good youth!\" says she. \"I am thy wife; let us go    and seek a place where we may live.\"[57]    One of the sins to which the Popular Tale shows itself most hostile is  that of avarice. The folk-tales of all lands delight to gird at misers  and skinflints, to place them in unpleasant positions, and to gloat  over the sufferings which attend their death and embitter their  ghostly existence. As a specimen of the manner in which the humor of  the Russian peasant has manipulated the stories of this class, most of  which probably reached him from the East, we may take the following  tale of--        THE MISER.[58]      There once was a rich merchant named Marko--a stingier fellow    never lived! One day he went out for a stroll. As he went    along the road he saw a beggar--an old man, who sat there asking    for alms--\"Please to give, O ye Orthodox, for Christ's    sake!\"      Marko the Rich passed by. Just at that time there came up    behind him a poor moujik, who felt sorry for the beggar, and gave    him a copeck. The rich man seemed to feel ashamed, for he    stopped and said to the moujik:      \"Harkye, neighbor, lend me a copeck. I want to give that    poor man something, but I've no small change.\"      The moujik gave him one, and asked when he should come    for his money. \"Come to-morrow,\" was the reply. Well next    day the poor man went to the rich man's to get his copeck. He    entered his spacious courtyard and asked:      \"Is Marko the Rich at home?\"      \"Yes. What do you want?\" replied Marko.      \"I've come for my copeck.\"      \"Ah, brother! come again. Really I've no change just now.\"      The poor man made his bow and went away.      \"I'll come to-morrow,\" said he.      On the morrow he came again, but it was just the same story    as before.      \"I haven't a single copper. If you like to change me a note    for a hundred--No? well then come again in a fortnight.\"      At the end of the fortnight the poor man came again, but    Marko the Rich saw him from the window, and said to his wife:      \"Harkye, wife! I'll strip myself naked and lie down under    the holy pictures. Cover me up with a cloth, and sit down and    cry, just as you would over a corpse. When the moujik comes    for his money, tell him I died this morning.\"      Well the wife did everything exactly as her husband directed    her. While she was sitting there drowned in bitter tears, the    moujik came into the room.      \"What do you want?\" says she.      \"The money Marko the Rich owes me,\" answers the poor    man.      \"Ah, moujik, Marko the Rich has wished us farewell;[59] he's    only just dead.\"      \"The kingdom of heaven be his! If you'll allow me, mistress,    in return for my copeck I'll do him a last service--just    give his mortal remains a wash.\"      So saying he laid hold of a pot full of boiling water and began    pouring its scalding contents over Marko the Rich. Marko, his    brows knit, his legs contorted, was scarcely able to hold out.[60]      \"Writhe away or not as you please,\" thought the poor man,    \"but pay me my copeck!\"      When he had washed the body, and laid it out properly, he    said:      \"Now then, mistress, buy a coffin and have it taken into the    church; I'll go and read psalms over it.\"      So Marko the Rich was put in a coffin and taken into the    church, and the moujik began reading psalms over him. The    darkness of night came on. All of a sudden a window opened,    and a party of robbers crept through it into the church. The    moujik hid himself behind the altar. As soon as the robbers had    come in they began dividing their booty, and after everything    else was shared there remained over and above a golden sabre--each    one laid hold of it for himself, no one would give up his    claim to it. Out jumped the poor man, crying:      \"What's the good of disputing that way? Let the sabre    belong to him who will cut this corpse's head off!\"      Up jumped Marko the Rich like a madman. The robbers    were frightened out of their wits, flung away their spoil and    scampered off.      \"Here, Moujik,\" says Marko, \"let's divide "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22381"],[0,"Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome (#10)"],[1," state,  and here too was the Hestia, or public hearth, with its fire, by means of  which those meals were prepared. It was customary for emigrants to take  with them a portion of this sacred fire, which they jealously guarded and  brought with them to their new home, where it served as a connecting link  between the young Greek colony and the mother country. Hestia is generally  represented standing, and in accordance with the dignity and sanctity of  her character, always appears fully draped. Her countenance is  distinguished by a serene gravity of expression. {50}    VESTA.    Vesta occupies a distinguished place among the earlier divinities of the  Romans. Her temple in Rome, containing as it were the hearthstone of the  nation, stood close beside the palace of Numa Pompilius.    On her altar burned the never-ceasing fire, which was tended by her  priestesses, the Vestal Virgins.[22]    The temple of Vesta was circular in form, and contained that sacred and  highly prized treasure the Palladium of Troy.[23]    The great festival in honour of Vesta, called the Vestalia, was celebrated  on the 9th of June.    DEMETER (Ceres).    Demeter (from _Ge-meter_, earth-mother) was the daughter of Cronus and  Rhea.[24] She represented that portion of Gaea (the whole solid earth) which  we call the earth's crust, and which produces all vegetation. As goddess of  agriculture, field-fruits, plenty, and productiveness, she was the  sustainer of material life, and was therefore a divinity of great  importance. When ancient Gaea lost, with Uranus, her position as a ruling  divinity, she abdicated her sway in favour of her daughter Rhea, who  henceforth inherited the powers which her mother had previously possessed,  receiving in her place the honour and worship of mankind. In a very old  poem Gaea is accordingly described as retiring to a cavern in the bowels  {51} of the earth, where she sits in the lap of her daughter, slumbering,  moaning, and nodding for ever and ever.    It is necessary to keep clearly in view the distinctive difference between  the three great earth-goddesses Gaea, Rhea, and Demeter. Gaea represents the  earth as a whole, with its mighty subterranean forces; Rhea is that  productive power which causes vegetation to spring forth, thus sustaining  men and animals; Demeter, by presiding over agriculture, directs and  utilizes Rhea's productive powers. But in later times, when Rhea, like  other ancient divinities, loses her importance as a ruling deity, Demeter  assumes all her functions and attributes, and then becomes the goddess of  the life-producing and life-maintaining earth-crust. We must bear in mind  the fact that man in his primitive state knew neither how to sow nor how to  till the ground; when, therefore, he had exhausted the pastures which  surrounded him he was compelled to seek others which were as yet unreaped;  thus, roaming constantly from one place to another, settled habitations,  and consequently civilizing influences, were impossible. Demeter, however,  by introducing a knowledge of agriculture, put an end, at once and for  ever, to that nomadic life which was now no longer necessary.    [Illustration]    The favour of Demeter was believed to bring mankind rich harvests and  fruitful crops, whereas her displeasure caused blight, drought, and famine.  The island of Sicily was supposed to be under her especial protection, and  there she was regarded with particular veneration, the Sicilians naturally  attributing the wonderful fertility of their country to the partiality of  the goddess.    Demeter is usually represented as a woman of noble {52} bearing and  majestic appearance, tall, matronly, and dignified, with beautiful golden  hair, which falls in rippling curls over her stately shoulders, the yellow  locks being emblematical of the ripened ears of corn. Sometimes she appears  seated in a chariot drawn by winged dragons, at others she stands erect,  her figure drawn up to its full height, and always fully draped; she bears  a sheaf of wheat-ears in one hand and a lighted torch in the other. The  wheat-ears are not unfrequently replaced by a bunch of poppies, with which  her brows are also garlanded, though sometimes she merely wears a simple  riband in her hair.    Demeter, as the wife of Zeus, became the mother of Persephone (Proserpine),  to whom she was so tenderly attached that her whole life was bound up in  her, and she knew no happiness except in her society. One day, however,  whilst Persephone was gathering flowers in a meadow, attended by the  ocean-nymphs, she saw to her surprise a beautiful narcissus, from the stem  of which sprang forth a hundred blossoms. Drawing near to examine this  lovely flower, whose exquisite scent perfumed the air, she stooped down to  gather it, suspecting no evil, when a yawning abyss opened at her feet, and  Aides, the grim ruler of the lower world, appeared from its depths, seated  in his dazzling chariot drawn by four black horses. Regardless of her tears  and the shrieks of her female attendants, Aides seized the terrified  maiden, and bore her away to the gloomy realms over which he reigned in  melancholy grandeur. Helios, the all-seeing sun-god, and Hecate, a  mysterious and very ancient divinity, alone heard her cries for aid, but  were powerless to help her. When Demeter became conscious of her loss her  grief was intense, and she refused to be comforted. She knew not where to  seek for her child, but feeling that repose and inaction were impossible,  she set out on her weary search, taking with her two torches which she  lighted in the flames of Mount Etna to guide her on her way. For nine long  days and nights she wandered on, inquiring of every one she met for tidings  of her child. {53} But all was in vain! Neither gods nor men could give her  the comfort which her soul so hungered for. At last, on the tenth day, the  disconsolate mother met Hecate, who informed her that she had heard her  daughter's cries, but knew not who it was that had borne her away. By  Hecate's advice Demeter consulted Helios, whose all-seeing eye nothing  escapes, and from him she learnt that it was Zeus himself who had permitted  Aides to seize Persephone, and transport her to the lower world in order  that she might become his wife. Indignant with Zeus for having given his  sanction to the abduction of his daughter, and filled with the bitterest  sorrow, she abandoned her home in Olympus, and refused all heavenly food.  Disguising herself as an old woman, she descended upon earth, and commenced  a weary pilgrimage among mankind. One evening she arrived at a place called  Eleusis, in Attica, and sat down to rest herself near a well beneath the  shade of an olive-tree. The youthful daughters of Celeus, the king of the  country, came with their pails of brass to draw water from this well, and  seeing that the tired wayfarer appeared faint and dispirited, they spoke  kindly to her, asking who she was, and whence she came. Demeter replied  that she had made her escape from pirates, who had captured her, and added  that she would feel grateful for a home with any worthy family, whom she  would be willing to serve in a menial capacity. The princesses, on hearing  this, begged Demeter to have a moment's patience while they returned home  and consulted their mother, Metaneira. They soon brought the joyful  intelligence that she was desirous of securing her services as nurse to her  infant son Demophoon, or Triptolemus. When Demeter arrived at the house a  radiant light suddenly illumined her, which circumstance so overawed  Metaneira that she treated the unknown stranger with the greatest respect,  and hospitably offered her food and drink. But Demeter, still grief-worn  and dejected, refused her friendly offers, and held herself apart from the  social board. At length, however, the maid-servant Iambe succeeded, by  means {54} of playful jests and merriment, in somewhat dispelling the grief  of the sorrowing mother, causing her at times to smile in spite of herself,  and even inducing her to partake of a mixture of barley-meal, mint, and  water, which was prepared according to the directions of the goddess  herself. Time passed on, and the young child throve amazingly under the  care of his kind and judicious nurse, who, however, gave him no food, but  anointed him daily with ambrosia, and every night laid him secretly in the  fire in order to render him immortal and exempt from old age. But,  unfortunately, this benevolent design on the part of Demeter was frustrated  by Metaneira herself, whose curiosity, one night, impelled her to watch the  proceedings of the mysterious being who nursed her child. When to her  horror she beheld her son placed in the flames, she shrieked aloud.  Demeter, incensed at this untimely interruption, instantly withdrew the  child, and throwing him on the ground, revealed herself in her true  character. The bent and aged form had vanished, and in its place there  stood a bright and beauteous being, whose golden locks streamed over her  shoulders in richest luxuriance, her whole aspect bespeaking dignity and  majesty. She told the awe-struck Metaneira that she was the goddess  Demeter, and had intended to make her son immortal, but that her fatal  curiosity had rendered this impossible, adding, however, that the child,  having slept in her arms, and been nursed on her lap, should ever command  the respect and esteem of mankind. She then desired that a temple and altar  should be erected to her on a neighbouring hill by the people of Eleusis,  promising that she herself would direct them how to perform the sacred  rites and ceremonies, which should be observed in her honour. With these  words she took her departure never to return.    Obedient to her commands, Celeus called together a meeting of his people,  and built the temple on the spot which the goddess had indicated. It was  soon completed, and Demeter took up her abode in it,"]]]
