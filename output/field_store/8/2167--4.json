We come to a swing bridge. It is open and our modern hotel  and modern people slowly steam right through the middle of a Biblical  caravan of Arabs on camels; some have crossed into the Egyptian side,  the remainder are waiting on the Arabian side, their camels are feeding  on the grey-green bushes. The passengers just give them a glance and go  on with their books. Have we not seen it all long ago in nursery books  on Sundays. But, in the nursery in our Sunday books we did not see or  feel the glitter and heat of the day, some of which, children to-day can  get in Mr Kelly's book.    I dared not sketch the desert scenes; it was in too high a key for me,  but I made so bold as to do this sketch of a scene on deck at night: an  effect I have not heard described, though it must be familiar to those  who go this road. I am sorry it is not reproduced here in colour.    [Illustration]    The searchlight on the bow plays on the sandbanks and desert beyond, and  makes the land like a snow-field, and the slow movement of the white  light intensifies the darkness and silence of the desert. In contrast to  the cold blue light and snow-white sand, is the group of figures on  deck in bright dresses, dancing. It made quite an _evident_ subject. The  figure leaning on the rail is not ill. It is only a little Japanese maid  thinking of home perhaps.    Suez was a few lights in the darkness over the glow of our pipes, then  bed, and in the morning we were sailing down the top, west branch, of  the Red Sea, otherwise the Gulf of Suez, with a fresh north wind behind  us.    It is extremely charming and refreshing, as I've already remarked, to  look out of a port in the morning and see the glittering, tumbling, blue  sea alongside. On this occasion the blue is capped with many soft white  horses chasing south, and the serrated barren hills of Egypt are  slipping away north. They are coloured various tints of pale, faded  leather, light buff, and light red, and the sun glares brilliantly over  all, \"drying up the blue Red Sea at the rate of twenty three feet per  year,\" this from the Orient-Pacific Guide; you can yourself almost fancy  you hear the sea fizzling with the heat. The Arabian shore is almost the  same as the Egyptian, with a larger margin of swelling stretches of sand  between the sea and the foot of the hills.        \"Gaunt and dreary run the mountains,      With black gorges up the land      Up to where the lonely desert      Spreads her burning, dreary sand.\"    There are occasions when circumstances make it really a pleasure to be  an artist, to-day for example; the air is so full of colour, the sea  deepest turquoise, with emerald showing when the crests burst white and  mix with the blue, and there is a glint of reddish colour reflected from  the Arabian sand, and the shadows in the clefts in the sand-hills to the  north are as blue as the sea. I was trying to put this down when my  friend from the West Country, who helps the engines, told me he had got  me one of these exquisite classic earthenware vases from Port Said,  which he decorates with cigar labels and blue and gold enamel. I had a  chat with him in his rather nice cabin--made a study of the flagon,  _i.e._ drew its cork. It was full of deep purple Italian wine, like  Lacrima Christie or Episcopio Rosso; the wine was good enough, but its  deep rose colour with the bright blue reflected on it through the port  was splendid. He didn't like it himself, said \"it drew his mouth,\" and  he gave me both the bottle and the wine as a present because of our love  for Dalriada, and I have to give him a \"wee bit sketch\" for his cabin.    I will smuggle the jar under our table--G. and I both like Italian  wine--and we will use it as a water bottle afterwards, for we have only  one decanter at our table amongst eleven thirsty people.    It was just such dark red wine as this, I suppose, that Ulysses and his  friends in these seas took in skinfuls to wash down venison, an  excellent menu I must say, but it would have been more seamanlike if  they had slept off the effects on board, instead of lying out all night  on the beach; then, when Morning the rosy-fingered turned up, they'd  have been quicker getting under way, and would have got home sooner in  the end. How much superior were the Fingalian heroes; they would sail  and fight all day and pass round the uisquebaugh in the evening at the  feast of shells, and never get fuddled and never feared anything under  water or above land, and were beholden to neither Gods nor men.    But I did once know a descendant of theirs, in their own country who was  overcome by red wine. \"It was perfectly excusable,\" he said, for he had  never tasted it before--or since! He was a fine, tall man called Callum  Bhouie, from his yellow hair when he was a youth; he was old when I knew  him--six feet two and thin as a rake and strong, with the face of  Wellington and an eye like a hawk. He and his friend were going home to  his croft from their occupations one morning early, round the little  Carsaig Bay opposite Jura, where he had a still up a little burn there,  and they fell in with a cask on the sand and there was red wine in it,  port or Burgundy, I do not know. Callum said he knew all about it and it  was but weak stuff, so they took bowls and saucers and drank the weak  stuff more and more. I think it must have been port; and they lay where  they were on the sand and slept till the morning after. When dawn, the  rosy-fingered, found them she must have thought them quite Hellenic; and  the minister followed later, and I would not think it right to repeat  what he thought it right to say. The sands and the bay and the burn are  there to-day, and, as they say in the old tales, if Callum were not dead  he would be alive to prove the truth of the story. The still I've never  seen, but Callum I knew, and his croft; alas the roof of it fell in a  few years ago; and it was the last inhabited house of a Carsaig clachan.  You see the land is \"improved\" now, for sheep, and it's all in one big  farm instead of small crofts, and little greasy, black-faced sheep climb  the loose stone walls and nibble the green grass short as a carpet where  Callum and his wife lived so long.    May I go on to the end of Callum's story; though it is rather a far cry  from this hot Red Sea to the cool Sound of Jura?    He and his wife were to be taken to the poor house in winter, and on the  long drive across Kintyre they were told that they would be separated,  and there was then and there such a crying and fighting on the road that  they were both driven back to the croft--and I was not surprised, for  where Callum Bhouie was fighting there would not be a stronger man of  his age. So they lived on in the but-and-ben, with the lonely, tall ash  standing over it, and the view of Jura, the sweetest I know, in front,  and he died very old indeed, and his wife followed him in two or three  days, so they were not separated even by death for long.    ... Now to my log rolling. It has already been explained by travellers  of repute that the Red Sea does not take its name from its colour; this  statement, I believe, is now generally accepted as being something more  than the mere \"traveller's tale.\" It is not, however, so generally known  that this Sea is peculiarly blue, so blue, in fact, that were you to dip  a white dress into it it would come out blue, or at least it looks as if  it would. It reminds me of a splendid blue silk with filmy white lace  spread over it. Against this the figures on the shady side of the ship  look very pretty; ladies and children and menkind all in such various  bright, summery colours, lying in long chairs or grouped round green  card tables. \"The Ladies' Gulf,\" it should be called now. That used to  be the name for the sea off the N. W. of Africa where you pick up the  North East trades as you sail south. Times have changed and sea routes,  so the name should be passed east to this Gulf of Suez, where ladies and  parasols look at their best and the appearance of a man in oilskins  would be positively alarming.    The Indian judge with the Italian name and myself, are, as far as I can  see, the only passengers who are not engaged doing something. Perhaps  the judge's Italian name and my Vino Tinto respectively account for our  contemplative attitudes. He has pulled his chair well forward to be out  of the crowd, and makes a perfect picture of happy repose; he wears a  dark blue yachting suit, and his hands are deep in his pockets. His face  is ruddy, and his eyes are blue and seem to sparkle with the pleasure of  watching the tumbling blue seas, and the bursting white and green  crests. Just now a rope grummet, thrown by an elderly youth at a tub,  rolled under his legs, and the judge handed it back most politely, and  resumed contemplation. In two minutes another quoit clattered under his  chair, this he likewise returned very politely; at the third, however,  he sighed and gave up his study of the blue and sauntered aft to the  smoking-room--such is life on a P. & O.    The above picture is intended to represent ladies in afternoon dress,  the colours of the intermediate tints of the rainbow--expressions  celestial. It is the witching hour before changing from one costume to  the other, after afternoon tea and just before dressing for dinner. To  the right you may observe an Ayah spoiling some young Britons.[3] You  see in the background a golden sunset on a wine red sea, and our lady  artist, a pupil from Juliens; she is gazing out at the departing  glory.... After sundown the decks are empty, for the people are below  dressing and at dinner; towards nightfall they become alive again with  ladies in evening dresses with delicate scarves and laces, promenading  to and fro--a difficult thing to do in such a crowd. One moment they are  dark shadowy forms against the southern night "]]]
