It put me in mind of Horace's Mouse, and to blesse  God for my owne private condition.' Twenty years previously he would not  have thought or said this.    Evelyn took a leading part in the negociations for the repurchase of  Chelsea College for L1,300 from the Royal Society to whom it had been  recently presented by the King, and for the establishment of a hospital  for old soldiers there at a cost of L20,000 with an endowment of L5,000  a year.    Several violent fits of ague having afflicted him during the winter of  1681-82, to cure which 'recourse was had to bathing my legs in milk up  to ye knees, made as hot as I could endure it', Evelyn made his will  and put all his affairs in order 'that now growing in yeares, I might  have none of the secular things and concerns to distract me when it  should please Almighty God to call me from this transitory life'. In  November 1682 he was asked by many friends to stand for election as  president of the Royal Society, in succession to Sir Christopher Wren,  but pleading 'remote dwelling, and now frequent infirmities' he declined  the proffered honour. Subsequently, in 1690, he had actually, 'been  chosen President of the Royal Society', but desired to decline it 'and  with greate difficulty devolv'd the election on Sir Robert Southwell,  Secretary of State to King William in Ireland.' For a third time, in  November 1693, the honour was again offered--'Much importun'd to take  the office of President of the Royal Society, but I againe declin'd it.'    On 12th February 1683 his father-in-law, Sir Richard Browne, who had  been created a baronet in 1649, and to whose influence he owed much,  died at his house at Sayes Court, leaving Mrs. Evelyn as his sole  heiress. Meanwhile grandchildren had been born to Evelyn, some of whom  soon died in infancy. His appointment on the Council of Plantations and  Trade seems to have lapsed before this time, for no further mention is  made in his diary of Council meetings, and he seems to have resided  chiefly at Sayes Court, gardening and spending his time in scholarly  leisure and recreation. This surmise is borne out by what he says in  1683, 'Oct. 4th. I went to London, on receiving a note from the  Countesse of Arlington, of some considerable charge or advantage I might  obtaine by applying myselfe to his Majesty on this signal conjuncture of  his Majesty entering up judgment against the City charter; the proposal  made me I wholly declin'd, not being well satisfied with these violent  transactions, and not a little sorry that his Majesty was so often put  upon things of this nature against so great a Citty, the consequence  wheroff may be so much to his prejudice; so I return'd home.'    On 6th February 1685 King Charles II. died after an apoplectic fit, and  his brother James, Duke of York, ascended the throne. Evelyn comments  fully on the virtues and vices of the late monarch. 'He would doubtless  have been an excellent Prince had he been less addicted to women, who  made him uneasy, and allways in want to supply their immeasurable  profusion, to ye detriment of many indigent persons who had signaly  serv'd both him and his father..... He was ever kind to me, and very  gracious upon all occasions, and therefore I cannot, without  ingratitude, but deplore his loss, which for many respects, as well as  duty, I do with all my soul.'      VI    _Evelyn's Declining Years_ (1685-1706).    With the accession of James II., Evelyn was again to feel the sunny  warmth of royal favour in the form of an official appointment. But  previous to this he had to suffer a heavy loss by the death from  small-pox of his eldest daughter Mary, in the 19th year of her age, who  had been born at Wotton in the same room as her father had first seen  the light.    In September 1685 Evelyn was informed that on Lord Clarendon, Lord Privy  Seal, going to assume the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland the King had  nominated him as one of the Commissioners to execute the office of Privy  Seal during such appointment; and early in December he was 'put into the  new Commission of Sewers.' It was nearly Christmas before he kissed  hands on receiving the patent for executing this office and entered on  its duties along with the two other Commissioners. They performed these  till the 10th March 1687, when the King relieved them with compliments  on their 'faithfull and loyal service, with many gracious expressions to  this effect', and bestowed the seal on Lord Arundel of Wardour, a  zealous Roman Catholic.    In the early days of James II's reign the patronage which seemed to be  coming in Evelyn's direction appears to have, not unnaturally perhaps,  somewhat coloured his opinion as to the new monarch's capacity and  disposition. After a journey undertaken with Pepys to Windsor,  Winchester, and Portsmouth in September 1685, whither the King went to  view the state of the fortifications, he recorded that 'what I observ'd  in this journey, is that infinite industry, sedulity, gravity, and  greate understanding and experience of affairs, in his Majesty, that I  cannot but predict much happiness to ye nation, as to its political  government; and if he so persist, there could be nothing more desir'd to  accomplish our prosperity, but that he was of the national church.'  Biassed and prejudiced in the royal favour as he then temporarily was,  this account of King James proved so totally incorrect that it is a  wonder Evelyn retained it in the compilation which he left as his  _Diary_. The only explanation seems to be that he wished to record his  prevision as regards Roman Catholicism proving the main rock upon which  the King might come to grief, as he afterwards did.    Titus Oates' conspiracy and the Duke of Monmouth's invasion and  insurrection went by without affecting Evelyn much. He was in the latter  case called upon to supply a mounted trooper, which he did rather  grudgingly. 'The two horsemen which my son and myselfe sent into the  county troopes, were now come home, after a moneth's being out to our  greate charge.' But what concerned him much more was that matters  frequently came before the Commission of the Privy Seal to which he  could not, on religious grounds principally, give his assent. On such  occasions he would sometimes go to his house in the country, 'refusing  to be present at what was to passe at the Privy Seale the next day',  because any two out of the three Commissioners formed a quorum. At other  times, however, he had to face his responsibility properly, by refusing  to put his seal to the papers in question, while noting his objections  to the course of action proposed. The Papistry which was spreading over  the country under the King's influence seemed to darken the land and to  obscure the future. 'Popish Justices of the Peace establish'd in all  counties, of the meanest of the people; Judges ignorant of the law, and  perverting it--so furiously do the Jesuits drive, and even compel  Princes to violent courses, and destruction of an excellent government  both in Church and State. God of his infinite mercy open our eyes and  turn our hearts, and establish his truth with peace! The Lord Jesus  defend his little flock, and preserve this threaten'd Church and  Nation.'    A staunch Protestant, Evelyn no longer possessed the King's favour, and  henceforth he received no further appointment or token of royal approval  although he still frequented the Court at Whitehall. In August 1688 he  was secretly informed by the Rev. Dr. Tenison, afterwards Bishop of  Lincoln, of the impending invasion of the Prince of Orange, and, while  regularly paying his duty as a courtier, he informed the lately  imprisoned Archbishop and Bishops of the intrigues on which the Jesuits  were hard at work. And subsequently 'My Lord of Canterbury gave me great  thanks for the advertisement I sent him in October, and assured me they  took my counsell in that particular, and that it came very seasonably.'  On 18th December, he 'saw the King take barge to Gravesend at 12  o'clock--a sad sight,' on the very day that the Prince of Orange came to  St. James and filled Whitehall with Dutch guards. All the world at once  went to pay court to the Prince whose star was now in the ascendant:  and, of course, Evelyn went too. A couple of months later he 'saw _the  new Queene_ and _King_ proclaim'd the very next day after her coming to  Whitehall, Wednesday 13 Feb., with greate acclamations and generall good  reception.... It was believ'd that both, especially the Princesse, would  have shew'd some (seeming) reluctance at least, of assuming her father's  Crown, and some apology, testifying her regret that he should by his  mismanagement necessitate the Nation to so extraordinary a proceeding,  which would have shew'd very handsomely to the world, and according to  the character given by her piety; consonant also to her husband's first  decleration, that there was no intention of deposing the King, but of  succouring the Nation; but nothing of all this appear'd; she came into  White-hall laughing and jolly, as to a wedding, so as to seem quite  transported..... This carriage was censured by many.'    After the Restoration Evelyn's life as a courtier was practically at an  end, as he never quite approved the enforced abdication of King James.  So henceforth he spent his time, without further attendance at Court or  seeking after office or appointment, in study, literary work, and  retirement. He did not like the new regime, with its 'Court offices  distributed amongst Parliament men.... Things far from settled as was  expected, by reason of the slothfull, sickly temper of the new King, and  the Parliament's unmindfullness of Ireland, which is likely to prove a  sad omission.' He even seems to have regretted that his son was in March  1692 made 'one of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2078"],[0,"Thais (#10)"],[1,"who were lying in  the shade of the old walls, he announced to them that all slaves would  soon be free, and that the day of justice was at hand.    \"In the kingdom of God,\" he said, \"the slaves will drink new wine and  eat delicious fruits; whilst the rich, crouching at their feet like  dogs, will devour the crumbs from their table.\"    These sayings were noised abroad through all that quarter of the city,  and the masters feared that Ahmes might incite the slaves to revolt.  The innkeeper hated him intensely, though he carefully concealed his  rancour.    One day, a silver salt-cellar, reserved for the table of the gods,  disappeared from the inn. Ahmes was accused of having stolen it--out of  hate to his master and to the gods of the empire. There was no proof  of the accusation, and the slave vehemently denied the charge.  Nevertheless, he was dragged before the tribunal, and as he had the  reputation of being a bad servant, the judge condemned him to death.    \"As you did not know how to make a good use of your hands,\" he said,  \"they will be nailed to the cross.\"    Ahmes heard the verdict quietly, bowed to the judge most respectfully,  and was taken to the public prison. During the three days that remained  to him, he did not cease to preach the gospel to the prisoners, and  it was related afterwards that the criminals, and the gaoler himself,  touched by his words, believed in Jesus crucified.    He was taken to the very place which one night, less than two years  before, he had crossed so joyfully, carrying in his cloak little Thais,  the daughter of his soul, his darling flower. When his hands were nailed  to the cross, he uttered no complaint, but many times he sighed and  murmured, \"I thirst.\"    His agony lasted three days and three nights. It seemed hardly possible  that human flesh could have endured such prolonged torture. Many times  it was thought he was dead; the flies clustered on his eyelids, but  suddenly he would reopen his bloodshot eyes. On the morning of the  fourth day, he sang, in a voice clearer and purer than that of a child--    \"Tell us, Mary, what thou hast seen where thou hast been?\"    Then he smiled and said--    \"They come, the angels of the good Lord. They bring me wine and fruit.  How refreshing is the fanning of their wings!\"    And he expired.    His features preserved in death an expression of ecstatic happiness.  Even the soldiers who guarded the cross were struck with wonder.  Vivantius, accompanied by some of the Christian brethren, claimed the  body, and buried it with the remains of the other martyrs in the crypt  of St. John the Baptist, and the Church venerated the memory of Saint  Theodore the Nubian.    Three years later, Constantine, the conquerer of Maxentius, issued an  edict which granted toleration to the Christians, and the believers were  not henceforth persecuted, except by heretics.    Thais had completed her eleventh year when her friend was tortured  to death, and she felt deeply saddened and shocked. Her soul was not  sufficiently pure to allow her to understand that the slave Ahmes was  blessed both in his life and his death. The idea sprang up in her little  mind that no one can be good in this world except at the cost of  the most terrible sufferings. And she was afraid to be good, for her  delicate flesh could not bear pain.    At an early age, she had given herself to the lads about the port, and  she followed the old men who wandered about the quarter in the evening,  and with what she received from them she bought cakes and trinkets.    As she did not take home any of the money she gained, her mother  continually ill-treated her. To get out of reach of her mother's arm,  she often ran, bare-footed, to the city walls, and hid with the lizards.  There she thought with envy of the ladies she had seen pass her, richly  dressed, and in a litter surrounded by slaves.    One day, when she had been beaten more brutally than usual, she was  crouching down beside the gate, motionless and sulky, when an old woman  stopped in front of her, looked at her for some moments in silence, and  then cried--    \"Oh, the pretty flower! the beautiful child! Happy is the father who  begot thee, and the mother who brought thee into the world!\"    Thais remained silent, with her eyes fixed on the ground. Her eyelids  were red, and it was evident she had been weeping.    \"My white violet,\" continued the old woman, \"is not your mother happy to  have nourished a little goddess like you, and does not your father, when  he sees you, rejoice from the bottom of his heart?\"    To which the child replied, as though talking to herself--    \"My father is a wine-skin swollen with wine, and my mother a greedy  horse-leech.\"    The old woman glanced to right and left, to see if she were observed.  Then, in a fawning voice--    \"Sweet flowering hyacinth, beautiful drinker of light, come with me,  and you shall have nothing to do but dance and smile. I will feed you on  honey cakes, and my son--my own son--will love you as his eyes. My son  is handsome and young; he has but little beard on his chin; his skin is  soft, and he is, as they say, a little Acharnian pig.\"    Thais replied--    \"I am quite willing to go with you.\"    And she rose and followed the old woman out of the city.    The old woman, who was named Moeroe, went from city to city with a  troupe of girls and boys, whom she taught to dance, and then hired out  to rich people to appear at feasts.    Guessing that Thais would soon develop into a most beautiful woman, she  taught her--with the help of a whip--music and prosody, and she flogged  with leather thongs those beautiful legs, when they did not move in time  to the strains of the cithara. Her son--a decrepit abortion, of no age  and no sex--ill-treated the child, on whom he vented the hate he had for  all womankind. Like the dancing-girls whose grace he affected, he knew,  and taught Thais, the art of pantomime, and how to mimic, by expression,  gesture, and attitude, all human passions, and more especially the  passions of love. He was a clever master, though he disliked his work;  but he was jealous of his pupil, and as soon as he discovered that she  was born to give men pleasure, he scratched her cheeks, pinched her  arms, or pricked her legs, as a spiteful girl would have done. Thanks,  however, to his lessons, she quickly became an excellent musician,  pantomimist, and dancer. The brutality of her master did not at all  surprise her; it seemed natural to her to be badly treated. She even  felt some respect for the old woman, who knew music and drank Greek  wine. Moeroe, when she came to Antioch, praised her pupil to the  rich merchants of the city who gave banquets, both as a dancer and  a flute-player. Thais danced and pleased. She accompanied the rich  bankers, when they left the table, into the shady groves on the banks of  the Orontes. She gave herself to all, for she knew nothing of the price  of love. But one night that she had danced before the most fashionable  young men of the city, the son of the pro-consul came to her, radiant  with youth and pleasure, and said, in a voice that seemed redolent of  kisses--    \"Why am I not, Thais, the wreath which crowns your hair, the tunic which  enfolds your beautiful form, the sandal on your pretty foot? I wish you  to tread me under foot as a sandal; I wish my caresses to be your tunic  and your wreath. Come, sweet girl! come to my house, and let us forget  the world.\"    She looked at him whilst he was speaking, and saw that he was handsome.  Suddenly she felt a cold sweat on her face. She turned green as grass;  she reeled; a cloud descended before her eyes. He again implored her to  come with him, but she refused. His ardent looks, his burning words were  vain, and when he took her in his arms to try and drag her away, she  pushed him off rudely. Then he implored her, and shed tears. But a  new, unknown, and invincible passion dominated her heart, and she still  resisted.    \"What madness!\" said the guests. \"Lollius is noble, handsome, and rich,  and a dancing-girl treats him with scorn!\"    Lollius returned home alone that night, quite love-sick. He came in the  morning, pale and red-eyed, and hung flowers at the dancing-girl's door.    But Thais was frightened and troubled; she avoided Lollius, and yet  he was continually in her mind. She suffered, and she did not know the  cause of her complaint. She wondered why she had thus changed, and why  she was melancholy. She recoiled from all her lovers; they were hateful  to her. She loathed the light of day, and lay on her bed all day,  sobbing, and with her head buried in the pillows. Lollius contrived to  gain admittance, and came many times, but neither his pleadings nor his  execrations had any effect on the obdurate girl. In his presence, she  was as timid as a virgin, and would say nothing but--    \"I will not! I will not!\"    But at the end of a fortnight she gave in, for she knew that she loved  him; she went to his house and lived with him. They were supremely  happy. They passed their days shut up together, gazing into each other's  eyes, and babbling a childish jargon. In the evening, they walked on the  lonely banks of the Orontes, and lost themselves in the laurel woods.  Sometimes they rose at dawn, to go and gather hyacinths on the slopes of  Sulpicus. They drank from the same cup, and he would take a grape from  between her lips with his mouth.    Moeroe came to Lollius, and cried and shrieked that Thais should be  restored to her.    \"She is my daughter,\" she said, \"my daughter, who has been torn from me.  My perfumed flower--my own bowels--!\"    Lollius gave her a large sum of money, and sent her away. But, as she  came back to demand some more gold staters, the young man had her put  in prison, and the magistrates having discovered that she was guilty of  many crimes, she was condemned to death, and thrown to the wild beasts."]]]
