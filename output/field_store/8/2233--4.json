That they did put stone to one practical use--the outward casing of  their walls and platforms--we have already seen. The blocks must have  been cut in the Zagros mountains and brought by water--rafted down the  Zab, or some other of the rivers which, springing from those mountains,  flow into the Tigris. The process is represented with perfect clearness  on some of the sculptures. That reproduced in Fig. 13 is of great  interest, as showing a peculiar mode of transport,--rafts floated on  inflated skins--which is at the present moment in as general and  constant use as it appears to have been in the same parts three thousand  years ago and probably more. When Layard wished to send off the bulls  and lions which he had moved from Nimrud and Koyunjik down the Tigris to  Baghdad and Busrah, (or Bassorah), there to be embarked for Europe, he  had recourse to this conveyance, as no other is known for similar  purposes. This is how he describes the primitive, but ingenious  contrivance: \"The skins of full-grown sheep and goats, taken off with as  few incisions as possible, are dried and prepared, one aperture being  left, through which the air is forced by the lungs. A framework of  poplar beams, branches of trees, and reeds, having been constructed of  the size of the intended raft, the inflated skins are tied to it by  osier twigs. The raft is then complete and is moved to the water and  launched. Care is taken to place the skins with their mouths upward,  that, in case any should burst or require refilling, they can be easily  reached. Upon the framework are piled bales of goods, and property  belonging to merchants and travellers.... The raftmen impel these rude  vessels by long poles, to the ends of which are fastened a few pieces of  split cane. (See Fig. 14.) ... During the floods in spring, or after  heavy rains, small rafts may float from Mosul to Baghdad in about  eighty-four hours; but the larger are generally six or seven days in  performing the voyage. In summer, and when the river is low, they are  frequently nearly a month in reaching their destination. When they have  been unloaded, they are broken up, and the beams, wood and twigs, sold  at considerable profit. The skins are washed and afterward rubbed with a  preparation, to keep them from cracking and rotting. They are then  brought back, either on the shoulders of the raftmen or upon donkeys, to  Mossul and Tekrit, where the men engaged in the navigation of the Tigris  usually reside.\" Numerous sculptures show us that similar skins were  also used by swimmers, who rode upon them in the water, probably when  they intended to swim a greater distance than they could have  accomplished by their unassisted efforts. (See Figure 16.)    [Illustration: 15.--EXCAVATIONS AT MUGHEIR (UR).]    10. Our imagination longs to reconstruct those gigantic piles as they  must have struck the beholder in their towering hugeness, approached  from the plain probably by several stairways and by at least one ascent  of a slope gentle enough to offer a convenient access to horses and  chariots. What an imposing object must have been, for instance, the  palace of Sennacherib, on the edge of its battlemented platform (mound  of Koyunjik), rising directly above the waters of the Tigris,--named in  the ancient language \"the Arrow\" from the swiftness of its current--into  the golden and crimson glory of an Eastern sunset! Although the sameness  and unwieldy nature of the material used must have put architectural  beauty of outline out of the question, the general effect must have been  one of massive grandeur and majesty, aided as it was by the elaborate  ornamentation lavished on every portion of the building. Unfortunately  the work of reconstruction is left almost entirely to imagination, which  derives but little help from the shapeless heaps into which time has  converted those ancient, mighty halls.    [Illustration: 16.--WARRIORS SWIMMING ON INFLATED SKINS. (Babelon.)]    11. Fergusson, an English explorer and scholar whose works on subjects  connected with art and especially architecture hold a high place, has  attempted to restore the palace of Sennacherib such as he imagines it to  have been, from the hints furnished by the excavations. He has produced  a striking and most effective picture, of which, however, an entire half  is simply guesswork. The whole nether part--the stone-cased,  battlemented platform wall, the broad stairs, the esplanade handsomely  paved with patterned slabs, and the lower part of the palace with its  casing of sculptured slabs and portals guarded by winged bulls--is  strictly according to the positive facts supplied by the excavations.  For the rest, there is no authority whatever. We do not even positively  know whether there was any second story to Assyrian palaces at all. At  all events, no traces of inside staircases have been found, and the  upper part of the walls of even the ground-floor has regularly been  either demolished or destroyed by fire. As to columns, it is impossible  to ascertain how far they may have been used and in what way. Such as  were used could have been, as a rule, only of wood--trunks of great  trees hewn and smoothed--and consequently every vestige of them has  disappeared, though some round column bases in stone have been found.[M]  The same remarks apply to the restoration of an Assyrian palace court,  also after Fergusson, while that of a palace hall, after Layard, is not  open to the same reproach and gives simply the result of actual  discoveries. Without, therefore, stopping long to consider conjectures  more or less unsupported, let us rather try to reproduce in our minds a  clear perception of what the audience hall of an Assyrian king looked  like from what we may term positive knowledge. We shall find that our  materials will go far towards creating for us a vivid and authentic  picture.    [Illustration: 17.--VIEW OF KOYUNJIK. (Hommel.)]    12. On entering such a hall the first thing to strike us would probably  be the pavement, either of large alabaster slabs delicately carved in  graceful patterns, as also the arched doorways leading into the adjacent  rooms (see Figs. 24 and 25, pp. 69 and 71), or else covered with rows of  inscriptions, the characters being deeply engraven and afterwards filled  with a molten metallic substance, like brass or bronze, which would give  the entire floor the appearance of being covered with inscriptions in  gilt characters, the strange forms of cuneiform writing making the whole  look like an intricate and fanciful design.    [Illustration: 18.--STONE LION AT THE ENTRANCE OF A TEMPLE. NIMRUD.  (Perrot and Chipiez.)]    13. Our gaze would next be fascinated by the colossal human-headed  winged bulls and lions keeping their silent watch in pairs at each of  the portals, and we should notice with astonishment that the artists had  allowed them each an extra leg, making the entire number five instead of  four. This was not done at random, but with a very well-calculated  artistic object--that of giving the monster the right number of legs,  whether the spectator beheld it in front or in profile, as in both cases  one of the three front legs is concealed by the others. The front view  shows the animal standing, while it appears to be striding when viewed  from the side. (See Figures 18 and 27, pp. 59 and 75.) The walls were  worthy of these majestic door-keepers. The crude brick masonry  disappeared up to a height of twelve to fifteen feet from the ground  under the sculptured slabs of soft grayish alabaster which were solidly  applied to the wall, and held together by strong iron cramps. Sometimes  one subject or one gigantic figure of king or deity was represented on  one slab; often the same subject occupied several slabs, and not  unfrequently was carried on along an entire wall. In this case the lines  begun on one slab were continued on the next with such perfect  smoothness, so absolutely without a break, as to warrant the conclusion  that the slabs were sculptured _after_ they had been put in their  places, not before. Traces of paint show that color was to a certain  extent employed to enliven these representations, probably not over  plentifully and with some discrimination. Thus color is found in many  places on the eyes, brows, hair, sandals, the draperies, the mitre or  high headdress of the kings, on the harness of horses and portions of  the chariots, on the flowers carried by attendants, and sometimes on  trees. Where a siege is portrayed, the flames which issue out of windows  and roofs seem always to have been painted red. There is reason to  believe, however, that color was but sparingly bestowed on the  sculptures, and therefore they must have presented a pleasing contrast  with the richness of the ornamentation which ran along the walls  immediately above, and which consisted of hard baked bricks of large  size, painted and glazed in the fire, forming a continuous frieze from  three to five feet wide. Sometimes the painting represented human  figures and various scenes, sometimes also winged figures of deities or  fantastic animals,--in which case it was usually confined above and  below by a simple but graceful running pattern; or it would consist  wholly of a more or less elaborate continuous pattern like Fig. 22,  23, or 25, these last symbolical compositions with a religious  signification. (See also Fig. 21, \"Interior view,\" etc.) Curiously  enough the remains--mostly very trifling fragments--which have been  discovered in various ruins, show that these handsomely finished glazed  tiles exhibited the very same colors which are nowadays in such high  favor with ourselves for all sorts of decorative purposes: those used  most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24676"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Norway (#10)"],[1," are birds which are common enough in England in the winter,  but which mostly go away to Norwegian breeding-grounds, such as geese,  ducks, woodcock, and snipe; while bramblings, fieldfares, and redwings  are birds of the North, and never nest in Great Britain. Besides  these, there are a certain number of birds which have no claim to be  termed British, and which are found in Norway all the year round--the  nut-cracker, several kinds of woodpecker, the ryper (the game-bird of  the country), and others. And, on the other hand, some of our common  resident birds migrate from Norway in the winter.    The house-sparrow is as much at home in Norway as he is in every other  land, but in winter he sticks close to the habitations, and were it  not for the fact that the people are bird-lovers, sparrows would have  a poor chance of picking up a living at this time of the year. Towards  the end of autumn it is a general custom to erect near the house a  sheaf of corn on a pole, so that the small birds may have something  to eat when the hard weather comes. And the ceremony of putting up  the pole is made the occasion for a feast for the children. They are  thus not likely to forget the birds, and even in the towns one sees  these bundles of corn hanging outside the windows.    It is, perhaps, a little disappointing to find that robins in Norway  are not associated with Christmas, but the fact remains that they are  not brave enough to risk starvation, and though a few of them are said  to stay in the country, the bulk of them leave in September. But the  wren takes the place of the robin as far as tameness and impertinence  are concerned, as in winter he attaches himself to the peasant's  cottage and makes himself quite at home, being known either as  \"Peter-of-the-Afternoon\" or as \"Tommy-round-the House.\" Magpies  also are great favourites with the country people at this season,  as they become quite tame, and hop in and out of the cottages. They  are regularly fed, and no one would dream of molesting them.    The Norwegians have several quaint old legends connected with some  of their birds. This is the story of the gold-crest, known in Norway  as the \"bird king\":    \"Once upon a time the golden eagle determined to be publicly  acknowledged as king of the birds, and he called a meeting of every  kind of bird in the world. As many of the birds would come from  tropical countries, he appointed a day in the warmest month; and the  place he chose was a vast tract called Groenfjeld, where every species  of bird would feel at home, since it bordered on the sea, yet was  well provided with trees, shrubs, flowers, rocks, sand, and heather,  as well as with lakes and rivers full of fish. So on the morning of  the great congress the birds began to arrive in a steady stream, and  by noon every description of bird was represented--even the ostrich  (though how he contrived to cross the seas the story does not say). The  eagle welcomed them, and when the last hummingbird had settled down he  addressed the meeting, saying that there was no doubt that he had a  right to demand to be proclaimed their king. The spread of his wings  was prodigious, he could fearlessly look at the sun, and to whatever  height he soared he could detect the slightest movement of a fly on  the earth. But the birds objected to him on account of his predatory  habits, and then each in turn stated his own case as a claimant for  the kingship--the ostrich could run the fastest, the bird of paradise  and the peacock could look the prettiest, the parrot could talk the  best, the canary could sing the sweetest, and every one of them,  for some reason or other, was in his own opinion superior to his  fellows. After several days of fruitless discussion it was finally  decided that whichever bird could soar the highest should be, once  and for all, proclaimed king.\"    \"Every bird who could fly at all tried his best, and the golden  eagle, confident of success, waited till last. Eventually he spread  his wings, and as he did so an impudent little gold-crest hopped  (unbeknown to his great rival) on to his back. Up went the eagle,  and soon outdistanced every other bird. Then, when he had almost  reached the sun, he shouted out, 'Well, here I am, the highest of  all!' 'Not so,' answered the gold-crest, as, leaving the eagle's back,  he fluttered upwards, until suddenly he knocked his head against  the sun and set fire to his crest. Stunned by the shock, the little  upstart fell headlong to the ground, but, soon recovering himself, he  immediately flew up on to the royal rock and showed the golden crown  which he had assumed. Unanimously he was proclaimed _fuglekongen_  (king of the birds), and by this name,\" concludes the legend, \"he  has ever since been known, his sunburnt crest remaining as a proof  of his cunning and daring.\"    In those parts of Norway where the gold-crest is rarely seen the  same story, omitting the part about the sun and the burnt crest,  is told of the common wren, who is said to have broken off his tail  in his great fall. And to this is applied a moral, viz.: Proud and  ambitious people sometimes meet with an unexpected downfall.    Besides the three British woodpeckers, there are four other kinds  resident in Norway, and of these the great black woodpecker is the  largest. The woodmen consider it to be a bird which brings bad luck,  and avoid it as much as possible. They call it \"Gertrude's Bird\"  because of the following legend: \"Our Saviour once called on an old  woman who lived all alone in a little cottage in an extensive forest  in Norway. Her name was Gertrude, and she was a hard, avaricious  old creature, who had not a kind word for anybody, and although she  was not badly off in a worldly point of view, she was too stingy and  selfish to assist any poor wayfarer who by chance passed her cottage  door. One day our Lord happened to come that way, and, being hungry  and thirsty, he asked of Gertrude a morsel of bread to eat and a  cup of cold water to drink. But no, the wicked old woman refused,  and turned our Saviour from the door with revilings and curses. Our  Lord stretched forth His hand towards the aged crone, and, as a  punishment, she was immediately transformed into a black woodpecker;  and ever since that day the wicked old creature has wandered about  the world in the shape of a bird, seeking her daily bread from wood  to wood and from tree to tree.\" The red head of the bird is supposed  to represent the red nightcap worn by Gertrude.    Legends of this description were doubtless introduced in the early days  of Christianity in order to impress the new religion on the people,  and several have been preserved. Thus the turtle-dove is revered  as a bird which spoke kind words to our Lord on the cross; and,  similarly, the swallow is said to have perched upon the cross and to  have commiserated with Him; while the legend of the crossbill relates  how its beak became twisted in endeavouring to withdraw the nails,  and how to this day it bears upon its plumage the red blood-stains  from the cross.    Yet one more Christian legend--about the lapwing, or peewit: \"The  lapwing was at one time a hand-maiden of the Virgin Mary, and stole  her mistress's scissors, for which she was transformed into a bird,  and condemned to wear a forked tail resembling scissors. Moreover, the  lapwing was doomed for ever and ever to fly from tussock to tussock,  uttering the plaintive cry of 'Tyvit! tyvit!'--_i.e.,_ 'Thief! thief!'\"    In the old Viking times, before Christianity had found its way so far  North, the bird which influenced the people most was the raven. He  was credited with much knowledge, as well as with the power to bring  good or bad luck. One of the titles of Odin was \"Raven-god,\" and he  had as messengers two faithful ravens, \"who could speak all manner  of tongues, and flew on his behests to the uttermost parts of the  earth.\" In those days the figure of a raven was usually emblazoned  on shield and standard, and it was thought that as the battle raged  victory or defeat could be foreseen by the attitude assumed by the  embroidered bird on the standard. And it is well known that William  the Conqueror (who came of Viking stock) flew a banner with raven  device at the Battle of Hastings.    But the greatest use of all to which the sable bird was put was to  guide the roving pirates on their expeditions. Before a start was  made a raven was let loose, and the direction of his flight gave the  Viking ships their course. In this manner, according to the old Norse  legends, did Floki discover Iceland; and many other extraordinary  things happened under the auspices of the raven.            CHAPTER XII    WATERFALLS, SNOWFIELDS, AND GLACIERS      A really fine waterfall is a most fascinating thing. Long before you  reach it you hear the roar of the water, and see the spray ascending  like steam from a boiling caldron. Then when you stand before it,  you gaze in wonder on the never-ending rush of water, hurtling in  one great mass from top to bottom of the lofty cliff, or leaping in  mighty bounds from ledge to ledge.    Nowhere in Europe can one see such a variety of waterfalls as in  Norway, for every district has its _fos_, and in some districts the  cascades are innumerable. In the Romsdal, for instance, an English  traveller once counted within a mile no fewer than seventy-three  waterfalls, \"none of which were less than 1,000 feet high, while  some plunged down 2,000 feet.\" But the majority of these would only  consist of a single thread of water, not of that great, broad sheet  which is the feature of the more famous falls.    Which of Norway's many waterfalls is the finest is a matter of  opinion. Some people give the palm to the Rjukanfos (Telemarken), some  to the Skjaeggedalsfos [2] (or Ringedalsfos), some to the Voeringfos,  while others maintain that the Vettifos, the Tvindefos, and the  Tyssedalsfos are without rivals.
