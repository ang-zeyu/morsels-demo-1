Taffy was a Welchman, Taffy was a thief,    Taffy came to my house and stole a piece of beef;    I went to Taffy's house, Taffy wasn't home,    Taffy came to my house and stole a marrow-bone;    I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was in bed,    I took the marrow-bone, and beat about his head.

The Knave of Hearts,    He stole the tarts,      And took them clean away.      The King of Hearts,    Called for the tarts,      And beat the Knave full sore.    The Knave of Hearts    Brought back the tarts,      And vow'd he'd steal no more.        [Illustration]      A frog he would a-wooing go,                Heigho, says Rowley;    Whether his mother would let him or no:          With a rowley, powley, gammon and spinach.    Heigho, says Anthony Rowley.      So off he set with his opera hat,                Heigho, says Rowley;    And on the road he met a rat,          With a rowley, powley, etc.      \"Pray, Mr. Rat, will you go with me,\"                Heigho, says Rowley;    \"Kind Mrs. Mousey for to see?\"          With a rowley, powley, etc.      When they came to the door at Mousey's hall,                Heigho, says Rowley;    They gave a loud tap, and they gave a loud call,          With a rowley, powley, etc.      \"Pray, Mrs. Mouse, are you within?\"                Heigho, says Rowley;    \"Yes, kind sirs, and sitting to spin.\"          With a rowley, powley, etc.      \"Pray, Mrs. Mouse, now give us some beer,\"                Heigho, says Rowley;    \"That Froggy and I am fond of good cheer.\"          With a rowley, powley, etc.      \"Pray, Mr. Frog, will you give us a song?\"                Heigho, says Rowley;    \"But let it be something that's not very long.\"          With a rowley, powley, etc.      \"Indeed, Mrs. Mouse,\" replied the Frog,                Heigho, says Rowley;    \"A cold has made me as horse as a hog.\"          With a rowley, powley, etc.      \"Since you have caught cold, Mr. Frog,\" Mousey said,                Heigho, says Rowley;    \"I'll sing you a song that I have just made.\"          With a rowley, powley, etc.      But while they were all a-merrymaking,                Heigho, says Rowley;    A Cat and her kittens came tumbling in.          With a rowley, powley, etc.      The Cat she seized the Rat by the crown,                Heigho, says Rowley;    The kittens they pulled the little Mouse down.          With a rowley, powley, etc.      This put Mr. Frog in a terrible fright,                Heigho, says Rowley;    He took up his hat and he wished them good-night.          With a rowley, powley, etc.      As Froggy was crossing it over a brook,                Heigho, says Rowley;    A lilywhite Duck came and gobbled him up.          With a rowley, powley, etc.      So here is an end of one, two three--                Heigho, says Rowley,    The Rat, the Mouse, and little Froggy.

The North Wind doth blow,    And we shall have snow,    And what will poor Robin do then?      He will hop to a barn,    And to keep himself warm,    Will hide his head under his wing,                      Poor thing!        [Illustration]      There was an old woman, as I've heard tell,    She went to market her eggs for to sell;    She went to market all on a market day,    And she fell asleep on the king's highway.      By came a peddler, whose name was Stout,    He cut her petticoats all round about;    He cut her petticoats up to the knees,    Which made the old woman to shiver and freeze.      \"But if it be I, as I hope it be,    I've a little dog at home, and he'll know me;    If it be I, he'll wag his little tail,    And if it be not I, he'll loudly bark and wail.\"      Home went the little woman all in the dark,    Up got the little dog, and he began to bark;    He began to bark, so she began to cry,    \"Lauk a mercy on me, this is none of I.\"      When the little old woman first did wake,    She began to shiver, and she began to shake;    She began to wonder, and she began to cry,    \"Lauk a mercy on me, this can't be I!\"        I had four brothers over the sea.      Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.    And they each sent a present unto me,      Petrum, Partrum, Paradise, Temporie,      Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.      The first sent a chicken, without any bones;    The second sent a cherry, without any stones,      Petrum, Partrum, Paradise, Temporie,      Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.      The third sent a book, which no man could read;    The fourth sent a blanket, without any thread.      Petrum, Partrum, Paradise, Temporie,      Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.      How could there be a chicken without any bones?    How could there be a cherry without any stones?      Petrum, Partrum, Paradise, Temporie,      Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.      How could there be a book which no man could read?    How could there be a blanket without a thread?      Petrum, Partrum, Paradise, Temporie,      Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.      When the chicken's in the egg-shell, there are no bones,    When the cherry's in the blossom, there are no stones.      Petrum, Partrum, Paradise, Temporie,      Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.      When the book's in ye press no man it can read;    When the wool is on the sheep's back, there is no thread.      Petrum, Partrum, Paradise, Temporie,      Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.

Three little kittens they lost their mittens,    And they began to cry,            \"Oh! mammy dear,            We sadly fear,        Our mittens we have lost!\"    \"What! lost your mittens,    You naughty kittens,        Then you shall have no pie.\"            Miew, miew, miew, miew,            Miew, miew, miew, miew.      The three little kittens they found their mittens,    And they began to cry.            \"Oh! mammy dear,            See here, see here,        Our mittens we have found.\"    \"What! found your mittens,    You little kittens,        Then you shall have some pie.\"            Purr, purr, purr, purr,            Purr, purr, purr, purr.      The three little kittens put on their mittens,    And soon ate up the pie;            \"Oh! mammy dear,            We greatly fear,        Our mittens we have soil'd.\"      \"What! soil'd your mittens,    You naughty kittens!\"        Then they began to sigh,            Miew, miew, miew, miew,            Miew, miew, miew, miew.      The three little kittens they washed their mittens,    And hung them up to dry;            \"Oh! mammy dear,            Look here, look here,        Our mittens we have wash'd.\"    \"What! wash'd your mittens,    You darling kittens!        But I smell a rat close by!            Hush! hush!\" Miew, miew,            Miew, miew, miew, miew.        Old Mother Hubbard    Went to the cupboard      To get her poor Dog a bone;    But when she came there    The cupboard was bare,      And so the poor Dog had none.      She went to the baker's      To buy him some bread,    But when she came back      She thought he was dead.      She went to the joiner's      To buy him a coffin,    But when she came back      The sly dog was laughing.      She took a clean dish,      To get him some tripe,    But when she came back      He was smoking his pipe.      She went to the ale-house,      To get him some beer,    But when she came back      The dog sat in a chair.      She went to the tavern,      For white wine and red,    But when she came back      He stood on his head.      She went to the hatter's      To buy him a hat,    But when she came back      He was feeding the cat.      She went to the barber's      To buy him a wig,    But when she came back      He was dancing a jig.      She went to the fruiterer's      To buy him some fruit,    But when she came back      He was playing a flute.      She went to the tailor's,      To buy him a coat,    But when she came back      He was riding a goat.      She went to the cobbler's,      To buy him some shoes,    But when she came back      He was reading the news.      She went to the sempstress,      To buy him some linen,    But when she came back      The dog was spinning.      [Illustration]      She went to the hosier's,      To buy him some hose,    But when she came back      He was dress'd in his clothes.      The Dame made a curtsey,      The Dog made a bow;    The Dame said \"Your servant,\"      The Dog said \"Bow wow!\"      This wonderful Dog      Was Dame Hubbard's delight;    He could sing, he could dance,      He could read, he could write.      She gave him rich dainties      Whenever he fed,    And erected a monument      When he was dead.          Peter White      Will ne'er go right.

By the time he had found them and had got down again in the office, the  bookkeeper was there, keeping up the fire and uttering, with some  acumen, comments on the obvious aspects of the weather, of the climate,  of the visible universe. The bookkeeper was a young man, very ready to  agree with Ebenezer for the sake of future favour, but with the  wistfulness of all industrial machines constructed by men from human  potentialities. Also, he had a cough and thin hands and a little family  and no job.    \"Get to work on this book,\" Ebenezer bade him; \"it's the one that began  the business.\"    The man opened the book, put it to his nearsighted eyes, frowned, and  glanced up at Ebenezer.    \"I don't think it seems....\" he began doubtfully.    \"Well, don't think,\" said Ebenezer, sharply; \"that's not needful. Read  the first entries.\"    [Illustration: \"ACROSS THE STILL FIELDS CAME FLASHING THE POINT OF  FLAME\"]    The bookkeeper read:--        Picking hops (4 days) . . . . $1.00      Sewing (Mrs. Shackell). . . .   .60      Egg money (3-1/4 dozen) . . .   .75      Winning puzzle. . . . . . . .  2.50                                    -----                                    $4.86        Disbursed:        Kitchen roller. . . . . . . . $ .10      Coffee mill . . . . . . . . .   .50      Shoes for M.  . . . . . . . .  1.25      Water colors for M. . . . . .   .25      Suit for M. . . . . . . . . .  2.00      Gloves--me. . . . . . . . . .   .50                                    -----                                    $4.75        Cash on hand: 11 cents.    The bookkeeper paused again. Ebenezer, frowning, reached for the book.  In his wife's fine faded writing were her accounts--after the eleven  cents was a funny little face with which she had been wont to illustrate  her letters. Ebenezer stared, grunted, turned to the last page of the  book. There, in bold figures, the other way of the leaf, was his own  accounting. He remembered now--he had kept his first books in the back  of the account book that she had used for the house.    Ebenezer glanced sharply at his bookkeeper. To his annoyance, the man  was smiling with perfect comprehension and sympathy. Ebenezer averted  his eyes, and the bookkeeper felt dimly that he had been guilty of an  indelicacy toward his employer, and hastened to cover it.    \"Family life does cling to a man, sir,\" he said.    \"Do you find it so?\" said Ebenezer, dryly. \"Read, please.\"    At noon Ebenezer walked home alone through the melting snow. And the  Thought that he did not think, but that spoke to him without his  knowing, said:--    \"Winning a puzzle--Two Dollars and a half. She never told me she tried  to earn a little something that way.\"          VIII      \"If we took the day before Christmas an' had it for Christmas,\" observed  Tab Winslow, \"would that hurt?\"    \"Eat your oatmeal,\" said Mis' Winslow, in the immemorial manner of  adults.    \"Would it, would it, would it?\" persisted Tab, in the immemorial manner  of youth.    \"And have Theophilus Thistledown for dinner that day instead?\" Mis'  Winslow suggested with diplomacy.    On which Tab ate his oatmeal in silence.    But, like adults immemorially, Mis' Winslow bore far more the adult  manner than its heart. After breakfast she stood staring out the pantry  window at the sparrows on the bird box.    \"It looks like Mary Chavah was going to be the only one in Trail Town to  have any Christmas after all,\" she thought, \"that little boy coming to  her, so.\"    He was coming week after next, Mary had said, and Mis' Winslow had heard  no word about it from anybody else. When \"the biggest of the work\" of  the forenoon was finished, Mis' Winslow ran down the road to Ellen  Bourne's. In Old Trail Town they always speak of it as running down, or  in, or over, in the morning, with an unconscious suiting of terms to  informalities.    Ellen was cleaning her silver. She had \"six of each\"--six knives, six  forks, six spoons, all plated and seldom used, pewter with black handles  serving for every day. The silver was cleaned often, though it was never  on the table, save for company, and there never had been any company  since Ellen had lost her little boy from fever. Having no  articulateness and having no other outlet for emotion, she fed her grief  by small abstentions: no guests, no diversions, no snatches of song  about her work. Yet she was sane enough, and normal, only in dearth of  sane and normal outlets for emotion, for energy, for personality, she  had taken these strange directions for yet unharnessed forces.    \"Mercy,\" observed Mis' Winslow, warming her hands at the cooking stove,  \"you got more energy.\"    \"... than family, I guess you mean,\" Ellen Bourne finished. Ellen was  little and fair, with slightly drooping head, and eyebrows curved to a  childlike reflectiveness.    \"Well, I got consider'ble more family than I got energy,\" said Mis'  Winslow, \"so I guess we even it up. Seven-under-fifteen eats up energy  like so much air.\"    \"Hey, king and country,\" said Ellen's old father, whittling by the fire,  \"you got family enough, Ellen. You got your hands full of us.\" He rubbed  his hands through his thin upstanding silver hair on his little pink  head, and his fine, pink face took on the look of father which rarely  intruded, now, on his settled look of old man.    \"I donno what she'd do,\" said Ellen's mother, \"with any more around here  to pick up after. We're cluttered up enough, as it is.\" She was an old  lady of whose outlines you took notice before your attention lay further  upon her--angled waist, chin, lips, forehead, put on her a succession of  zigzags. But her eyes were awake, and it was to be seen that she did not  mean what she said and that she was looking anxiously at Ellen in the  hope of having deceived her daughter. Ellen smiled at her brightly, and  was not deceived.    \"I keep pretty busy,\" she said.    Mis' Abby Winslow, who was not deceived either, hastened to the subject  of Mary.    \"I should think Mary Chavah had enough to do, too,\" she said, \"but she's  going to take Lily's little boy. Had you heard?\"    \"No,\" Ellen said, and stopped shaving silver polish.    \"He's coming in two weeks,\" Mis' Winslow imparted; \"she told me so  herself. She's got his room fixed up with owls on the wall paper. She's  bought him a washbasin with a rim of puppies, and a red stocking cap. I  saw her.\"    \"How old is he?\" Ellen asked, and worked again.    \"I never thought to ask her,\" Mis' Winslow confessed; \"he must be quite  a little fellow. But he's coming alone from some place out West.\"    \"Hey, king and country,\" Ellen's father said; \"I'd hate to have a boy  come here, with my head the way it is.\"    \"And keeping the house all upset,\" Ellen's mother said, and asked Mis'  Winslow some question about Mary; and when she turned to Ellen again,  \"Why, Ellen Bourne,\" she said, \"you've shaved up every bit of that  cleaning polish and we're most done cleaning.\"    Ellen was looking at Mis' Winslow: \"If you see her,\" Ellen said, \"you  ask her if I can't do anything to help.\"    Later in the day, happening in at Mis' Mortimer Bates's, Mis' Winslow  found Mis' Moran there before her, and asked what they had heard \"about  Mary Chavah.\" Something in that word \"about\" pricks curiosity its  sharpest. \"Have you heard about Mary Chavah?\" \"It's too bad about Mary  Chavah.\" \"Isn't it queer about Mary Chavah?\"--each of these is like  setting flame to an edge of tissue. Omit \"about\" from the language, and  you abate most gossip. At Mis' Winslow's phrase, both women's eyebrows  curved to another arc.    Mis' Winslow told them.    \"Ain't that nice?\" said Mis' Moran, wholeheartedly; \"I couldn't bring up  another, not with my back. But I'm glad Mary's going to know what it  is....\"    Mis' Mortimer Bates was glad, too, but being by nature a nonconformist,  she took exception.    \"It's an awful undertaking for a single-handed woman,\" she observed.    But this sort of thing she said almost unconsciously, and the other two  women regarded it with no more alarm than any other reflex.    \"It's no worse starting single-handed than being left single-handed,\"  offered Mis' Winslow somewhat ambiguously. \"Lots does that's thrifty.\"    \"Seems as if we could do a little something to help her get ready,  seem's though,\" Mis' Moran suggested; \"I donno what.\"    \"I thought I'd slip over after supper and ask her,\" Mis' Winslow said;  \"maybe I'd best go now--and come back and tell you what she says.\"    Mis' Winslow found Mary Chavah sitting by her pattern bookcase, cutting  out a pattern. Mary's face was flushed and her eyes were bright, and she  went on with her pattern, thrilled by it as by any other creating.    \"I just thought of this,\" Mary explained, looking vaguely at her  visitor. \"It come to me like a flash when I was working on Mis' Bates's  basque. Will you wait just a minute, and then I'll explain it out to  you.\"    Without invitation, Mis' Winslow laid aside her coat and waited,  watching Mary curiously. She was cutting and folding and pinning her  tissue paper, oblivious of any presence. Alarm, suspense, doubt,  solution, triumph, came and went, and neither woman was conscious that  the flame of creation burned and breathed in the room as truly as if the  product were to be acknowledged.    \"There!\" Mary cried at last. \"See it--can't you see it?--in gray wool?\"    It was the pattern for a boy's topcoat, cunningly cut in new lines of  seam and revers, with a pocket, a bit of braid, a line of buttons laid  in as delicately as the factors in any other good composition. Mis'  Winslow inevitably recognized its utility, exclaimed, and wondered.    \"Mary Chavah! How did you know how to do things for children?\"    \"How did you know how?\" Mary inquired coolly.    \"Why, I've had 'em,\" Mis' Winslow offered simply.    \"Do you honestly think that makes any difference?\" Mary"]]]
