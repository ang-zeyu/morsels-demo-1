Whereupon Gifted Gilfillan became so pleased with his companion and so  enraptured with his subject, that he allowed his party to string itself  out along the route without an attempt at discipline, or even the power  of supporting each other in case of attack.    The leaders were ascending a little hill covered with whin bushes and  crowned with low brushwood, when, after looking about him quickly to  note some landmarks, the pedlar put his fingers to his mouth and  whistled. He explained that he was whistling on a favourite dog, named  Bawty, which he had lost. The Covenanter reproved him severely for  thinking of a useless dog in the midst of such precious and improving  conversation as they were holding together.    But in spite of his protests the pedlar persisted in his whistling, and  presently, out of a copse close to the path, six or eight stout  Highlanders sprang upon them brandishing their claymores.    \"The Sword of the Lord and of Gideon!\" shouted Gifted Gilfillan, nothing  daunted. And he was proceeding to lay about him stoutly, when the  pedlar, snatching a musket, felled him to the ground with the butt. The  scattered Whig party hurried up to support their leader. In the scuffle,  Edward's horse was shot, and he himself somewhat bruised in falling.  Whereupon some of the Highlanders took him by the arms, and  half-supported, half-carried him away from the highroad, leaving the  unconscious Gifted still stretched on the ground. The Westlanders, thus  deprived of a leader, did not even attempt a pursuit, but contented  themselves with sending a few dropping shots after the Highlanders,  which, of course, did nobody any harm.    They carried Edward fully two miles, and it was not till they reached  the deep covert of a distant glen that they stopped with their burden.  Edward spoke to them repeatedly, but the only answer he got was that  they \"had no English.\" Even the mention of the name of Vich Ian Vohr,  which he had hitherto regarded as a talisman, produced no response.    Moreover, Edward could see from the tartans of his captors that they  were not of the Clan Ivor. Nor did the hut, into which they presently  conveyed our hero, reveal any more. Edward was placed in a large bed,  planked all round, and after his bruises were attended to by an old  woman, the sliding panel was shut upon him. A kind of fever set his  ideas wandering, and sometimes he fancied that he heard the voice of  Flora Mac-Ivor speaking in the hut without. He tried to push back the  panel, but the inmates had secured it on the outside with a large nail.    Waverley remained some time in these narrow quarters, ministered to by  the old woman and at intervals hearing the same gentle girlish voice  speaking outside, without, however, ever being able to see its owner. At  last, after several days, two of the Highlanders who had first captured  him returned, and by signs informed him that he must get ready to follow  them immediately.    At this news Edward, thoroughly tired of his confinement, rejoiced, and,  upon rising, found himself sufficiently well to travel. He was seated in  the smoky cottage quietly waiting the signal for departure, when he felt  a touch on his arm, and, turning, he found himself face to face with  Alice, the daughter of Donald Bean Lean. With a quick movement she  showed him the edges of a bundle of papers which she as swiftly  concealed. She then laid her finger on her lips, and glided away to  assist old Janet, his nurse, in packing his saddle-bags. With the tail  of his eye, however, Edward saw the girl fold the papers among his linen  without being observed by the others. This being done, she took no  further notice of him whatever, except that just at the last, as she was  leaving the cottage, she turned round and gave him a smile and nod of  farewell.    The tall Highlander who was to lead the party now made Edward understand  that there was considerable danger on the way. He must follow without  noise, and do exactly as he was bidden. A steel pistol and a broadsword  were given him for use in case of attack. The party had not been long  upon its night journeying, moving silently along through the woods and  copses in Indian file, before Edward found that there was good reason  for this precaution.    At no great distance he heard the cry of an English sentinel, \"All's  well!\" Again and again the cry was taken up by other sentries till the  sound was lost in the distance. The enemy was very near, but the trained  senses of the Highlanders in their own rugged country were more than a  match for the discipline of the regulars.    A little farther on they passed a large building, with lights still  twinkling in the windows. Presently the tall Highlander stood up and  sniffed. Then motioning Waverley to do as he did, he began to crawl on  all fours toward a low and ruinous sheep-fold. With some difficulty  Edward obeyed, and with so much care was the stalk conducted, that  presently, looking over a stone wall, he could see an outpost of five or  six soldiers lying round their camp-fire, while in front a sentinel  paced backward and forward, regarding the heavens and whistling _Nancy  Dawson_ as placidly as if he were a hundred miles from any wild rebel  Highlandmen.    At that moment the moon, which up to this time had been hidden behind  clouds, shone out clear and bright. So Edward and his Highland guide had  perforce to remain where they were, stuck up against the dike, not  daring to continue their journey in the full glare of light, while the  Highlander muttered curses on \"MacFarlane's lanthorn,\" as he called the  moon.    At last the Highlander, motioning Edward to stay where he was, began  with infinite pains to worm his way backward on all fours, taking  advantage of every bit of cover, lying stock-still behind a boulder  while the sentry was looking in his direction, and again crawling  swiftly to a more distant bush as often as he turned his back or marched  the other way. Presently Edward lost sight of the Highlander, but before  long he came out again at an altogether different part of the thicket,  in full view of the sentinel, at whom he immediately fired a shot--the  bullet wounding the soldier on the arm, stopping once and for all the  whistling of _Nancy Dawson_.    Then all the soldiers, awakened by the shot and their comrade's cry,  advanced alertly toward the spot where the tall man had been seen. He  had, however, retired, but continued to give them occasionally such a  view of his figure in the open moonlight, as to lead them yet farther  from the path.    Meanwhile, taking advantage of their leader's ruse, Waverley and his  attendants made good speed over the heather till they got behind a  rising ground, from which, however, they could still hear the shouts of  the pursuers, and the more distant roll of the royal drums beating to  arms. They had not gone far before they came upon an encampment in a  hollow. Here several Highlanders, with a horse or two, lay concealed.  They had not arrived very long before the tall Highlander, who had led  the soldiers such a dance, made his appearance quite out of breath, but  laughing gayly at the ease with which he had tricked his pursuers.    Edward was now mounted on a stout pony, and the whole party set forward  at a good round pace, accompanied by the Highlanders as an escort. They  continued without molestation all the night, till, in the morning light,  they saw a tall old castle on the opposite bank of the river, upon the  battlements of which they could see the plaid and targe of a Highland  sentry, and over which floated the white banner of the exiled Stuarts.    They passed through a small town, and presently were admitted into the  courtyard of the ancient fortress, where Edward was courteously  received by a chief in full dress and wearing a white cockade. He showed  Waverley directly to a half-ruinous apartment where, however, there was  a small camp bed. Here he was about to leave him, after asking him what  refreshment he would take, when Edward, who had had enough of mysteries,  requested that he might be told where he was.    \"You are in the castle of Doune, in the district of Menteith,\" said the  governor of the castle, \"and you are in no danger whatever. I command  here for his Royal Highness Prince Charles.\"    At last it seemed to Waverley as if he had reached a place of rest and  safety. But it was not to be. On the very next day he was put in charge  of a detachment of irregular horsemen who were making their way eastward  to join the forces of the Prince. The leader of this band was no other  than the Laird of Balmawhapple, who, backing words by deeds, had  mustered his grooms and huntsmen in the cause of the Stuarts. Edward  attempted to speak civilly to him, but found himself brutally repulsed.  Captain Falconer of Balmawhapple had noways forgotten the shrewd pinch  in the sword-arm which he had received from the Baron of Bradwardine in  Waverley's quarrel.    At first Edward had better luck with his Lieutenant, a certain  horse-coper or dealer. This man had sold Balmawhapple the chargers upon  which to mount his motley array, and seeing no chance of getting his  money except by \"going out\" himself, he had accepted the post of  Lieutenant in the Chevalier's army. So far good. But just at the moment  when it seemed that our hero was about to get some information of a  useful sort, Balmawhapple rode up, and demanded of his Lieutenant if he  had not heard his orders that no one should speak to the prisoner.    After that they marched in silence, till, as the little company of  adventurers was passing Stirling Castle, Balmawhapple must needs sound  his trumpet and display his white banner. This bravado, considerably to  that gentleman's discomfiture, was answered at once by a burst of smoke  from the Castle, and the next moment a cannon-ball knocked up the earth  a few feet from the Captain's charger,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22675"],[0,"Home Life in Colonial Days (#10)"],[1,"the light and show the color and quality of wine. I have often  seen the item wine-taster in colonial inventories and wills, but never  bleeding-basin; while porringers were almost universal on such lists.  Some families had a dozen. I have found fifteen in one old New England  farmhouse. The small porringers are sometimes called posnets, which is  an old-time word that may originally have referred to a posset-cup.    \"Spoons,\" says the learned archaeologist, Laborde, \"if not as old as the  world, are as old as soup.\" All the colonists had spoons, and certainly  all needed them, for at that time much of their food was in the form of  soup and \"spoon-meat,\" such as had to be eaten with spoons when there  were no forks. Meat was usually made into hashes or ragouts; thick stews  and soups with chopped vegetables and meats were common, as were  hotch-pots. The cereal foods, which formed so large a part of English  fare in the New World, were more frequently boiled in porridge than  baked in loaves. Many of the spoons were of pewter. Worn-out pewter  plates and dishes could be recast into new pewter spoons. The moulds  were of wood or iron. The spoon mould of one of the first settlers of  Greenfield, Massachusetts, named Martindale, is here shown with a  pewter spoon. In this mould all his spoons and those of his neighbors  were cast. It is now in the Deerfield Memorial Hall.    A still more universal spoon material was alchymy, also called occamy,  alcamy, arkamy, etc., a metal never used now, which was made of a  mixture of pan-brass and arsenicum. Wooden spoons, too, were always  seen. In Pennsylvania and New York laurel was called spoonwood, because  the Indians made pretty white spoons from that wood to sell to the  colonists. Horn was an appropriate and available material for spoons.  Many Indian tribes excelled as they do to-day in the making of horn  spoons. The vulgar affirmation, \"By the great horn spoon,\" has  perpetuated their familiar use.    Every family of any considerable possessions or owning good household  furnishings had a few silver spoons; nearly every person owned at least  one. At the time America was settled the common form of silver spoon in  England had what was known as a baluster stem and a seal head; the assay  mark was in the inner part of the bowl. But the fashion was just  changing, and a new and much altered form was introduced which was made  in large numbers until the opening reign of George I. This shape was the  very one without doubt in which many of the spoons of the first  colonists were made; and wherever such spoons are found, if they are  genuine antiques, they may safely be assigned a date earlier than 1714.  The handle was flat and broad at the end, where it was cleft in three  points which were turned up, that is, not toward the back of the spoon.  This was known as the \"hind's-foot handle.\" The bowl was a perfectly  regular ellipse and was strengthened by continuing the handle in a  narrow tongue or rat-tail, which ran down the back of the bowl. The  succeeding fashion, in the early part of the eighteenth century, had a  longer elliptical bowl. The end of the handle was rounded and turned up  at the end, and it had a high sharp ridge down the middle. This was  known as the old English shape, and was in common use for half a  century. About the period of our Revolutionary War a shape nearly like  the one in ordinary present use became the mode; the bowl became  egg-shaped, and the end of the handle was turned down instead of up. The  rat-tail, which extended down the back of the bowl, was shortened into a  drop. Apostle spoons, and monkey spoons for extraordinary use were  occasionally made, and a few are still preserved; examples of five types  of spoons are shown from the collection of Edward Holbrook, Esq., of New  York.    Families of consequence had usually a few pieces of silver besides their  spoons and the silver salt. Some kind of a drinking-cup was the usual  form. Persons of moderate means often owned a silver cup. I have seen in  early inventories and lists the names of a large variety of silver  vessels: tankards, beer-bowls, beakers, flagons, wine cups, wine bowls,  wine cans, tasters, caudle-cups, posset-cups, dram-cups, punch-bowls,  tumblers, mugs, dram bottles, two-eared cups, and flasks. Virginians and  Marylanders in the seventeenth century had much more silver than New  Englanders. Some Dutch merchants had ample amounts. It was deemed a  good and safe investment for spare money. Bread-baskets, salvers,  muffineers, chafing-dishes, casters, milk pitchers, sugar boxes,  candlesticks, appear in inventories at the end of the century. A tankard  or flagon, even if heavy and handsome, would be placed on the table for  every-day use; the other pieces were usually set on the cupboard's head  for ornament.    The handsome silver tankard owned by Sarah Jansen de Rapelje is here  shown. She was the first child of European parents born in New  Netherland. The tankard was a wedding gift from her husband, and a Dutch  wedding scene is graven on the lid.    There was a great desire for glass, a rare novelty to many persons at  the date of colonization. The English were less familiar with its use  than settlers who came from Continental Europe. The establishment of  glass factories was attempted in early days in several places, chiefly  to manufacture sheet-glass, but with slight success. Little glass was  owned in the shape of drinking-vessels, none used generally on the  table, I think, during the first few years. Glass bottles were certainly  a great rarity, and were bequeathed with special mention in wills, and  they are the only form of glass vessel named. The earliest glass for  table use was greenish in color, like coarse bottle glass, and poor in  quality, sometimes decorated in crude designs in a few colors. Bristol  glass, in the shape of mugs and plates, was next seen. It was opaque, a  milky white color, and was coarsely decorated with vitrifiable colors in  a few lines of red, green, yellow, or black, occasionally with initials,  dates, or Scriptural references.    Though shapes were varied, and the number was generally plentiful, there  was no attempt made to give separate drinking-cups of any kind to each  individual at the table. Blissfully ignorant of the existence or  presence of microbes, germs, and bacteria, our sturdy and unsqueamish  forbears drank contentedly in succession from a single vessel, which  was passed from hand to hand, and lip to lip, around the board. Even  when tumbler-shaped glasses were seen in many houses,--flip-glasses,  they were called,--they were of communal size,--some held a gallon,--and  all drank from the same glass. The great punch-bowl, not a very handy  vessel to handle when filled with punch, was passed up and down as  freely as though it were a loving-cup, and all drank from its brim. At  college tables, and even at tavern boards, where table neighbors might  be strangers, the flowing bowl and foaming tankard was passed serenely  from one to another, and replenished to pass again.    Leather was perhaps the most curious material used. Pitchers, bottles,  and drinking-cups were made of it. Great jugs of heavy black leather,  waxed and bound, and tipped with silver, were used to hold metheglin,  ale, and beer, and were a very substantial, and at times a very handsome  vessel. The finest examples I have ever seen are here represented. The  stitches and waxed thread at the base and on the handles can plainly be  perceived. They are bound with a rich silver band, and have a silver  shield bearing a date of gift to Samuel Brenton in 1778; but they are  probably a century older than that date. They are the property by  inheritance of Miss Rebecca Shaw, aged ninety-six years, of Wickford,  Rhode Island.    The use of these great leather jacks, in a clumsier form than here  shown, led to the amusing mistake of a French traveller, that the  English drank their ale out of their boots. These leather jugs were  commonly called black jacks, and the larger ones were bombards. Giskin  was still another and rarer name.    Drinking-cups were sometimes made of horn. A handsome one has been used  since colonial days on Long Island for \"quince drink,\" a potent mixture  of hot rum, sugar, and quince marmalade, or preserves. It has a base of  silver, a rim of silver, and a cover of horn tipped with silver. A  stirrup-cup of horn, tipped with silver, was used to \"speed the parting  guest.\" Occasionally the whole horn, in true mediaeval fashion, was used  as a drinking-cup. Often they were carved with considerable skill, as  the beautiful ones in the collection of Mr. A. G. Richmond, of  Canajoharie, New York.    Gourds were plentiful on the farm, and gathered with care, that the  hard-shelled fruit might be shaped into simple drinking-cups. In  Elizabeth's time silver cups were made in the shape of these gourds. The  ships that brought \"lemmons and raysins of the sun\" from the tropics to  the colonists, also brought cocoanuts. Since the thirteenth century the  shells of cocoanuts have been mounted with silver feet and \"covercles\"  in a goblet shape, and been much sought after by Englishmen. Mounted in  pewter, and sometimes in silver, or simply shaped with a wooden handle  attached, the shell of the cocoanut was a favorite among the English  settlers. To this day one of the cocoanut-shell cups, or dippers, is a  favorite drinking-cup of many. A handsome cocoanut goblet, richly  mounted in silver, is shown in the accompanying illustration. It was  once the property of the Revolutionary patriot, John Hancock, and is now  in the custody of the Bostonian Society, at the Old State House, in  Boston, Massachusetts.    Popular drinking-mugs of the English, from which specially they drank  their mead, metheglin, and ale, were the stoneware jugs which were made  in Germany and England, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in  great"]]]
