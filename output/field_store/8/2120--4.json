FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 43: Various terms are used by our author to denote the head  of the State (_e.g._ Raja, Protector of men, Lord of men, &c.) to suit  the metre or fancifully. In translation we have thought it better to  be uniform.]    [Footnote 44: What is understood by science is explained in the first  book sl. 3.]    [Footnote 45: Manu, ch. 8, sl. 9.]    [Footnote 46: The original is, _smriti adi_ (the second word being  equivalent to &c.), which the Commentator explains, as translated, law  and usage, or custom.]    [Footnote 47: The &c. signifies, description of chattels, with their  number, also particulars of place and time. (_M._)]    [Footnote 48: The Commentator has enabled us to supply the ellipsis,  but he does not fully explain the author's meaning. It would seem,  that in those primitive times, it was considered harsh or inexpedient  to harass a defendant, or accused person with two legal proceedings,  of any sort, at the same time. The sentence will, however, bear the  sense, that no stranger or intervener shall be permitted to come in  and interrupt the progress of a pending suit.]    [Footnote 49: The Commentator, observing that this prohibition would  seem to be implied in the terms of the sixth sloka, explains (on the  authority of Narada) that the latter refers only to the general object  of the suit, _e.g._, that if his verbal complaint be of a loan of  money, his recorded complaint shall not be of a loan of apparel--but  that this clause, in the ninth sloka, ensures further uniformity in  the description of the grievance and character of the suit, _e.g._,  where one has originally complained of retention of 100 pieces of  money lent, he shall not vary his complaint to a forcible taking of  100 pieces.]    [Footnote 50: These are expressed by one word, _kalaha_: but the  Commentator notes its comprehensive character, as we have translated  it. See the analogous passage in Manu, ch. 8, sl. 6, where an equally  ambiguous word _parushya_ is similarly explained in the text itself.  The term rendered \"slander\" by Sir Wm. Jones is simply, reviling or  verbal abuse.]    [Footnote 51: _sahasa_, explained by the Commentator, assault by means  of poison, or any instrument destructive of life. The word has another  and more particular signification, as infra sl. 230.]    [Footnote 52: Manu (ch. 8, sl. 59) inflicts a fine of double the debt  upon the mendacious debtor.]    [Footnote 53: _parushya_, explained by the Commentator _kalaha_: see  note [50].]    [Footnote 54: We have followed the Commentator in rendering these  terms, which are very general and indefinite.]    [Footnote 55: _i. e._ restlessly before the Court.]    [Footnote 56: Manu ch. 8, sl. 25, 26.]    [Footnote 57: ibid, sl. 55, 56.]    [Footnote 58: Literally \"put down,\" _i. e._ taken for granted, all  question of it disposed of. See next note.]    [Footnote 59: This sloka is by no means unambiguous: but it is  satisfactorily explained by the Commentator, who says: \"What course is  to be adopted where two parties simultaneously present themselves to  the Court and tender proofs? _e.g._ A man acquired a field by gift,  and, having for some time possessed it, departed with his family to  another country: then, another person obtained a gift of the same  field, and, having possessed it awhile, was likewise obliged to go to  another country. Both parties return at the same time, claim the same  field, and resort to a Court of law. Then arises the question,--whose  proofs shall be taken? Yajnavalkya says (ut supra sl. 17); that is to  say, where one sets up an older title, saying--I was possessed of this  field at such a date--his witnesses are the first to be examined; but  should the other party urge--True, the field was acquired and enjoyed  by him at the first, but the king bought it of him and granted it to  me--or--Another got the field and gave it to me; in that case, as the  proofs of him who has the older title are of no consequence, and thus  he is disposed of, the witnesses of the other claimant are to be  examined. It is incorrect [to read the sloka as asserting] that, where  there is a denial [of a claim] the witnesses of the plaintiff shall be  examined, and where a former judgment or something as a ground of  defence is set up, in [either of] which cases the original claim is  met, then the witnesses of the defendant shall be heard; inasmuch as  all this is included in the rule,--(here the Commentator quotes the  7th sloka of the text). This view is clearly supported by Narada,  _viz._ On a denial, proof is upon the plaintiff; where some ground of  defence is stated, upon the defendant; upon an allegation of prior  decree, the decree shall be the proof.--After this Narada  proceeds:--When there are two claimants, if there be witnesses, the  witnesses of the prior claimant shall be [first examined]--So we  perceive, this [description of] law-suit is distinguished from all  others.\" These quotations favor the supposition, that the science of  special-pleading is not of European origin, and is traceable to a  remote antiquity.]    [Footnote 60: Supra sl. 11.]    [Footnote 61: _e.g._ that the defendant has got possession of gold and  silver and apparel, &c. (_M._)]    [Footnote 62: Supra, sl. 6. The Commentator excludes from the  operation of the harsh rule in this 20th sloka, an heir, who is  supposed to deny his ancestor's debt or liability through ignorance;  but he attempts to justify the rule itself by experience of human  conduct.]    [Footnote 63: This Sastra teaches a system or science of ethics  such as moralists now-a-days designate as Machiavellian or jesuitical;  in which right or wrong have a relative but little intrinsic meaning.    The Artha Sastra is to be found in the writings of Usanas, of  Brihaspati and others.]    [Footnote 64: A special-pleading signification is given to this dogma  by the Commentator: _viz._    \"In questions of debt, &c., though the prior act have been proved, yet  a second act may be more important; _e.g._ if one prove that another  by borrowing has incurred debt, and the other prove that the money  borrowed has been repaid.\" (_M._)]    [Footnote 65: The word in the original is, acceptance: but this is  evidently used as the concluding act of the transaction referred to,  _scil._ gift.]    [Footnote 66: _e.g._ if one, for a consideration, pledge a field to  another, and then pledge the same field to some one else, also for a  consideration--the first act is the valid one. (_M._)]    [Footnote 67: Sir Wm. Jones and other learned persons would seem to  have restricted the term here used (_pashyati_) to personal knowledge  by sight; but it comprehends every mode of personal and actual  observation or discovery.]    [Footnote 68: who has no legal connection with it. (_M._)]    [Footnote 69: The Commentator quotes Narada, _scil._ \"The guilty one  who holds possession without title, for even many hundred years,  should be punished by the monarch as a thief\"--and he endeavours to  reconcile with this the law of Yajnavalkya, by confining the latter to  the fruits or profits of the land withheld. But this construction  cannot be admitted. There is a curious document germane to the subject  of this sloka copied in the official notes of Sir Robert Chambers  (Chief Justice of the Calcutta Supreme Court) in July 1791. It is a  letter from Sir William Jones to the Governor of Bombay upon the Hindu  title by adverse possession or prescription. Sir William writes, that  the doctrine of the Mitakshara is; \"An absolute property may be  acquired in land by continued and undisputed possession for twenty  years, in the presence of the owner, provided that the possessor came  in by a fair title, either by descent or purchase; if he had no fair  title, the intermediate profits only are irrecoverable, but the  property is not lost.\" And he concludes; \"I only add for your further  satisfaction, that, if three descents have happened since the first  possession, without a fair title, property is lost, even though the  owner was absent; but if three descents have not been cast, an adverse  possession for a hundred years gives an absolute property in the land  to the possessor, unless the owner was under some legal disability.\"  These may have been the modifications of a later age: they are not to  be found in Manu or in Yajnavalkya. Manu ch. 8, sl. 147, &c.]    [Footnote 70: any thing delivered for safe-keeping, its quality and  quantity being made known. (_M._)]    [Footnote 71: explained infra, sloka 65.]    [Footnote 72: The word literally or usually means \"takes away\"; and  the Commentator explains--where a pledgee retains and refuses to give  back the pledge, relying upon his long possession. The &c. refers to  the other exceptions in sloka 25.]    [Footnote 73: The Commentator considers the force and intent of this  qualification to be, to make the fine commensurate with the usurper's  means, with a view rather of enhancing it to the wealthy than of  moderating it to the poor, who are perhaps less likely to offend in  this wise.]    [Footnote 74: gift, sale, &c.

(_M._)]    [Footnote 77: Possession is proof when attended with five incidents; a  title, length of time, continuance, absence of counter-claim,  knowledge of the adverse party.

We  didn't realize how dangerous mosquitoes were till a short time ago.  People had malaria, and were very ill with it. In some countries many  died. Every one thought, however, that the malaria came in some  mysterious way from the mists of the low-lying swamps and marshes. But  one day some one happened to think it might not be in the marshes, after  all; rather that it might be a certain little two-winged insect with a  short, piercing instrument, which spent its babyhood days in these same  marshes.    \"And so two English doctors determined to find out the truth of the  matter. In the faraway land of Italy was a place where thousands of  people were suffering from this disease. There these doctors went and  built a comfortable little house in the very worst place they could  find. They were careful to screen every door and window, and to leave  not a crack for a mosquito to crawl in.    \"There they lived, always going into the house at sundown, shutting all  the screen doors, but allowing the damp night air to pour in. It was  this night air which every one supposed gave people malaria. But the two  physicians in the snug little house, free from mosquitoes, kept well,  strong, and happy, although the people outside in the other houses were  very ill and suffering with chills and fever.    \"You see, these little Anopheles, for that is their name, bite some one  ill with malaria. Perhaps the next person they stab with their sharp  needle is well. In this way they leave some of the poisoned blood in the  wound. There is another illness which is a hundred times worse than  malaria. This is called yellow fever. In some countries thousands of  people died from this every year, and doctors did not know just how it  was carried from place to place.    \"Our Government appointed a commission to study the matter. Dr. Walter  Reed, a surgeon of the United States Army, with three assistants, went  to Havana and built a house, carefully screened, just like that of the  English physicians in Italy. People thought that the fever was carried  in the clothes and on the sheets of those who were ill. To prove that  this was not so, these men wore the clothes of sick people, and even  slept on the sheets taken from the sickbed. They did this disagreeable  thing for twenty days, keeping the little house very warm, and shutting  out the fresh air and sunshine. But in spite of all these things the men  continued well and strong.    \"They wanted to prove even more surely that it was a certain kind of  mosquito which really did the harm. So they built another house.  Everything in this house was pure and clean. The rooms were flooded with  fresh air and sunshine. Half of the house was carefully screened and  shut off from the other half. The men in the half that was screened kept  perfectly well. Those in the other half let themselves be bitten by  mosquitoes which had been in the houses where there was yellow fever.  All became dangerously ill with the fever. Two of these brave physicians  died of the fever while trying to find the cause, in order that they  might save the lives of thousands of people.\"    \"That is modern heroism,\" said Mrs. Reece, \"and service of the highest  sort. All humanity is indebted to those brave men. There is no doubt but  that our Panama Canal could not be in progress to-day were it not for  the extermination of the mosquito in the canal zone. Since we can never  tell where a mosquito has been, or what kind of a mosquito it is, I  suppose it is best to keep mosquitoes from biting, and always to keep  them out of the house. And now, children, supper is ready, and after  that games. Let us go to the dining-room!\"          XI    CAMPING OUT      At last the day, expected all summer long, had come. The children, Hope  and Betty, Jack, Peter, and Jimmy, Mrs. Reece and Ben Gile, were  gathered on the edge of the pond, their packs in the canoes, their  paddles at bow and stern. Other guides had taken the food and tents  ahead the day before. Their friends had gathered to bid them good-bye,  and finally, amid the farewells, they were off, Jimmie in a canoe by  himself, Jack and Peter paddling Mrs. Reece, and Ben Gile with the two  little girls. Everybody was so excited that all talked at once, and  nobody could hear any one else. Hope and Betty had never been camping  before, and the boys meant to show the girls all the wonders of sleeping  and eating out in the woods.    Finally they came to a \"carry\"--that is, a path leading from one lake to  another, across which the food and canoes have to be lugged. The girls  and Mrs. Reece carried the packs and food over, making several trips in  order to do so; and the boys and the guide, crossing their paddles under  the thwarts of the canoes and raising the blades on their shoulders,  balanced the canoes and trotted swiftly over the carry. Nothing seemed  any trouble that glorious, beautiful day--nothing too heavy, nothing too  hard. Betty and Hope could have skipped over every inch of the trail,  and they were quite sure that they could have done all the paddling,  too. And Betty did learn, in after years, not only to paddle, but also  to carry her own canoe, for she grew to be a big, strong, athletic girl,  with rosy cheeks and a quick, sure step.    Hour after hour they went from one pond to another. The ponds were  larger and wilder at each crossing, and already they were in a  wilderness of woods and lakes, and heard the whistle of the hawk, the  scream of the lonely eagle, and the crazy cries of the loon. Every once  in a while a big heron mounted lazily upward and flew off solemnly to a  place where his peace need not be disturbed.    [Illustration:  _A._ Moth.  _B._ Caterpillar.  _C._ Side view of head of moth.  _D._ and _E._ Scales from the wing of a butterfly.]    Although Hope and Peter and Jack lived all the year around in Rangeley  Village, yet they had never been so far away from home before, and to  them it seemed very wonderful. Even in the midst of it all, however,  Jack did not forget the prize Ben Gile had offered. He hurried over  carry after carry, and at the end of each one might be found flat on his  face studying some little hill of ants.    At last, after travelling five hours, they came to a halt, ravenously  hungry. Dinner was cooked and eaten, and then, after dinner, they began  their long ascent of Saddleback, for they were going to a lonely little  pond on the second highest mountain in the State of Maine. There, at  Camp-in-the-Clouds, was a cabin in which Mrs. Reece could sleep, and the  girls, too, if they wished, although they declared that they would not.    Up, up the hill they trudged, stepping over blow-downs, following their  footing carefully, and watching with interest the little animals that  scampered out of their way. But never did packs grow so heavy, and at  last Mrs. Reece, who was carrying nothing but Jack's camera, sat down  panting and laughing.    \"I can't go a step farther,\" she declared, \"until I catch my breath.\"    \"This is a good place to rest,\" assented the guide. \"Some deer found it  so this morning, I think. Here, catch that butterfly, Jack!\"    In a flash Jack had caught the butterfly, and brought it, gently, to Ben  Gile.    \"You don't see this fellow up here often. Who knows the difference  between a butterfly and a moth? No one? Well, that is because most  children are going to bed about the time the moth begins to fly. Doesn't  any one know? You have all seen moths and butterflies? Well, well, well!    \"The first thing you see is that when the moth lights on the edge of a  flower-cup, instead of holding the wings up above the body, as the  butterfly does, it spreads its wings flat over the body. Then a  butterfly has little knobs at the tips of its slender antennae, while  the moth has slender ones without knobs, or pretty, feathery ones that  look like plumes.\"    \"I supposed,\" said Peter, \"that moths and butterflies were just the  same, except that moths will fly into the house and burn their wings on  the lamps.\" Peter didn't in the least care about moths and butterflies.  He was longing to get to the top of the mountain, but he was too polite  to seem impatient.    \"They are alike in many ways. You remember, do you not, that the locust  has a pair of soft jaws covering over the dark, hard ones? In the moths  and butterflies these jaws are different. Each one is long, and has a  deep groove on the inner side. These two grooves fit together, and make  a slender tube called a proboscis. When flying this long tube is rolled  up in a tight coil under the head; alighting, the proboscis is quickly  uncoiled and dipped into the throat of the flower, and the sweet nectar  sipped from it. See here, Jack, what have you on your fingers?\"    \"The dust from the butterfly's wings, sir.\"    \"No, not quite dust, or powder, either. That dust is tiny hair and  scales. If I had a powerful lens in my pocket I could show you how  deeply some of these tiny scales are scalloped, so that they look like a  hand with fingers. If you rubbed all the scales off that wing there  would be no color left, for the scales are like little sacs, and many of  them contain grains of color called pigment--red, yellow, or brown. You  have all seen the rainbow of colors on a soap-bubble? Well, the  brilliant colors of the wing are made in just the same way as the colors  on a bubble: by the light striking the little ridges on the overlapping  scales.\"    \"It is not only we who are fearfully and wonderfully made,\" said Mrs.  Reece, \"but even the tiniest creatures God has created, and all with a  purpose, all with a place.\"    The guide nodded his head. \"The more you study, the more you see how  every least thing is part of a great mysterious whole. If you look at a  butterfly's wing from which the scales have been rubbed you will see  plan and purpose in the placing of even those scales; for the little  pits into which "]]]
