If he should make a mistake and enter a  hole in which Yap Yap was at home, the chances are that Yap Yap  would kill the Owl for he knows that the Owl is an enemy.  Buzztail  the Rattlesnake also makes use of Prairie Dog holes, but it is safe  to say that if there are any Prairie Dog babies down there they  never live to see what the outside world is like.  So Buzztail  and the Burrowing Owl are really enemies instead of friends of  Yap Yap, the Prairie Dog.\"    \"Why is he called a Dog?\" asked Peter.    Old Mother Nature laughed right out.  \"Goodness knows,\" said she.  \"He  doesn't look like a Dog and he doesn't act like a Dog, so why people  should call him a Dog I don't know, unless it is because of his habit  of barking, and even his bark isn't at all like a Dog's--not nearly  so much so as the bark of Reddy Fox.  Now I guess this will do for  to-day.  Haven't you little folks had enough of school?\"    \"No,\" cried Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare and Happy Jack and  Chatterer the Red Squirrel and Striped Chipmunk and Johnny Chuck.  \"We want to know about the rest of the members of the order of  Rodents or Gnawers,\" added Peter.  \"Of course in a way they are sort  of related to us and we want to know about them.\"    Old Mother Nature laughed good-naturedly.  \"All right,\" said she,  \"come again to-morrow morning and we'll see what more we can learn.\"        CHAPTER IX  Two Queer Little Haymakers    There is nothing like a little knowledge to make one want more.  Johnny Chuck, who had gone to school only because Old Mother Nature  had sent for him, had become as full of curiosity as Peter Rabbit.  The discovery that he had a big, handsome cousin, Whistler the  Marmot, living in the mountains of the Far West, had given Johnny  something to think about.  It seemed to Johnny such a queer place  for a member of his family to live that he wanted to know more  about it.  So Johnny had a question all ready when Old Mother  Nature called school to order the next morning.    \"If you please, Mother Nature,\" said he, \"does my cousin, Whistler,  have any neighbors up among those rocks where he lives?\"    \"He certainly does,\" replied Old Mother Nature, nodding her head.  \"He has for a near neighbor one of the quaintest and most interesting  little members of the big order to which you all belong.  And that  order is what?\" she asked abruptly.    \"The order of Rodents,\" replied Peter Rabbit promptly.    \"Right, Peter,\" replied Old Mother Nature, smiling at Peter.  \"I  asked that just to see if you really are learning.  I wanted to  make sure that I am not wasting my time with you little folks.  Now this little neighbor of Whistler is Little Chief Hare.\"    Instantly Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare pricked up their long  ears and became more interested than ever, if that were possible.  \"I thought you had told us all about our family,\" cried Jumper,  \"but you didn't mention Little Chief.\"    \"No,\" said Old Mother Nature, \"I didn't, and the reason I didn't  was because Little Chief isn't a member of your family.  He is  called Little Chief Hare, but he isn't a Hare at all, although he  looks much like a small Rabbit with short hind legs and rounded  ears.  He has a family all to himself and should be called a Pika.  Some folks do call him that, but more call him a Cony, and some  call him the Crying Hare.  This is because he uses his voice a  great deal, which is something no member of the Hare family does.  In size he is just about as big as one of your half-grown babies,  Peter, so, you see, he really is a very little fellow.  His coat  is grayish-brown.  His ears are of good size, but instead of being  long, are round.  He has small bright eyes.  His legs are short,  his hind legs being very little longer than his front ones.  He  has hair on the soles of his feet just like the members of the  hare family.\"    \"What about his tail?\" piped up Peter Rabbit.  You know Peter is  very much interested in tails.    Old Mother Nature smiled.  \"He is worse off than you, Peter,\" said  she, \"for he hasn't any at all.  That is, he hasn't any that can be  seen.  He lives way up among the rocks of the great mountains above  where the trees grow and often is a very near neighbor to Whistler.\"    \"I suppose that means that he makes his home down in under rocks,  the same as Whistler does,\" spoke up Johnny Chuck.    \"Right,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"He is such a little fellow  that he can get through very narrow places, and he has his home  and barns way down in among the rocks.\"    \"Barns!\" exclaimed Happy Jack Squirrel.  \"Barns!  What do you mean  by barns?\"    Old Mother Nature laughed.  \"I just call them barns,\" said she,  \"because they are the places where he stores away his hay, just as  Farmer Brown stores away his hay in his barn.  I suppose you would  call them storehouses.\"    At the mention of hay, Peter Rabbit sat bolt upright and his eyes  were wide open with astonishment.  \"Did you say hay?\" he exclaimed.  \"Where under the sun does he get hay way up there, and what does  he want of it?\"    There was a twinkle in Old Mother Nature's eyes as she replied,  \"He makes that hay just as you see Farmer Brown make hay every  summer.  It is what he lives on in the winter and in bad weather.  Little Chief knows just as much about the proper way of making hay  as Farmer Brown does.  Even way up among the rocks there are places  where grass and peas-vines and other green things grow.  Little  Chief lives on these in summer.  But he is as wise and thrifty as  any Squirrel, another way in which he differs from the Hare family.  He cuts them when they are ready for cutting and spreads them out  on the rocks to dry in the sun.  He knows that if he should take  them down into his barns while they are fresh and green they would  sour and spoil; so he never stores them away until they are  thoroughly dry.  Then, of course, they are hay, for hay is nothing  but sun-dried grass cut before it has begun to die.  When his hay  is just as dry as it should be, he takes it down and stores it away  in his barns, which are nothing but little caves down in among the  rocks.  There he has it for use in winter when there is no green food.    \"Little Chief is so nearly the color of the rocks that it takes  sharp eyes to see him when he is sitting still.  He has a funny  little squeaking voice, and he uses it a great deal.  It is a funny  voice because it is hard to tell just where it comes from.  It seems  to come from nowhere in particular.  Sometimes he can be heard  squeaking way down in his home under the rocks.  Like Johnny Chuck,  he prefers to sleep at night and be abroad during the day.  Because  he is so small he must always be on the lookout for enemies.  At the  first hint of danger he scampers to safety in among the rocks, and  there he scolds whoever has frightened him.  There is no more  loveable little person in all my great family than this little  haymaker of the mountains of the Great West.\"    \"That haymaking is a pretty good idea of Little Chief's,\" remarked  Peter Rabbit, scratching a long ear with a long hind foot.  \"I've  a great mind to try it myself.\"    Everybody laughed right out, for everybody knew just how easy-going  and thriftless Peter was.  Peter himself grinned.  He couldn't  help it.    \"That would be a very good idea, Peter,\" said Old Mother Nature.  \"By the way, there is another haymaker out in those same great  mountains of the Far West.\"    \"Who?\" demanded Peter and Johnny Chuck and Happy Jack Squirrel,  all in the same breath.    \"Stubtail the Mountain Beaver,\" declared Peter promptly.  \"I  suppose Stubtail is his cousin.\"    Old Mother Nature shook her head.  \"No,\" said she.  \"No.  Stubtail  and Paddy are no more closely related than the rest of you.  Stubtail  isn't a Beaver at all.  His proper name is Sewellel.  Sometimes he  is called Showt'l and sometimes the Boomer, and sometimes the  Chehalis, but most folks call him the Mountain Beaver.\"    \"Is it because he looks like Paddy the Beaver?\" Striped Chipmunk asked.    \"No,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"He looks more like Jerry Muskrat  than he does like Paddy.  He is about Jerry's size and looks very  much as Jerry would if he had no tail.\"    \"Hasn't he any tail at all?\" asked Peter.    \"Yes, he has a little tail, a little stub of a tail, but it is so  small that to look at him you would think he hadn't any,\" replied  Old Mother Nature.  \"He is found out in the same mountains of the  Far West where Whistler and Little Chief live, but instead of  living way up high among the rocks he is at home down in the valleys  where the ground is soft and the trees grow thickly.  Stubtail has  no use for rocks.  He wants soft, wet ground where he can tunnel  and tunnel to his heart's content.  In one thing Stubtail is very  like Yap Yap the Prairie Dog.\"    \"What is that?\" asked Johnny Chuck quickly, for, you know, Yap Yap  is Johnny's cousin.    \"In his social habits,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"Stubtail isn't  fond of living alone.  He wants company of his own kind.  So wherever  you find Stubtail you are likely to find many of his family.  They  like to go visiting back and forth.  They make little paths between  their homes and all about through the thick ferns, and they keep  these little paths free and clear, so that they may run along them  easily.  Some of these little paths lead into long tunnels.  These  are made for safety.  Usually the ground is so wet that there will  be water running in the bottoms of these little tunnels.\"    \"What kind of a house does Stubtail have?\" inquired Johnny  Chuck interestedly.    \"A hole in the ground, of course,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"It  is dug where the ground is drier than where the runways are made.  Mrs. Stubtail makes a nest of dried ferns and close by they build  two or three storehouses, for Stubtail and Mrs. Stubtail"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24416"],[0,"Life and Work in Benares and Kumaon, 1839-1877 (#10)"],[1,"before dawn to let in whatever coolness might come with the morning, and  before eight they were shut to keep out the heat of the day. The lower  part of the door was of wood, and the upper part of glass. Outside the  doors were heavy wooden blinds, made after the fashion of Venetian  blinds, the upper part of which were opened to let in from the verandah  the degree of light absolutely necessary with the least possible degree  of heat. No prisoner in his cell is more excluded from an outside view  than we were in our rooms during the day in the hot season. There was a  remarkable contrast between the outside glare and the inside dimness, so  that a person coming from without could not on entering see anything.  The prevailing wind is from the west. There is enough in the morning to  show the direction from which it is coming. It rises as the day  advances; by two or three it blows with great strength, raising clouds  of dust, and lulls towards evening. This wind is cool and bracing in the  cold weather, but as the season advances it becomes warm, and by May its  heat resembles the blast of a furnace. It every now and then gives place  to the east wind, which is not nearly so hot, but is so enervating that  the hot wind is greatly preferred. During the day we sit under the  punkah, a great wooden fan suspended from the roof with great flapping  fringes. This is pulled by a coolie, sometimes in the adjoining room,  but when it can be arranged in the verandah outside, who has in his hand  a rope attached to the punkah, which is brought to him by a small  aperture in the wall, through which a piece of thin bamboo is inserted  to make the friction as little as possible. When the west wind is  blowing freshly, it is brought with most pleasant coolness into the  house through platted screens of scented grass, on which water is  continually thrown outside. For years machines resembling the fanners so  much used by farmers in former days, with scented grass on each side and  a hut of scented grass over them, on which water is continually thrown,  with wheels turned round by hand labour, have been brought largely into  use. These machines are appropriately called \"Thermantidotes.\"    The night in the hot season is much more trying than the day. There is  not a breath stirring, and the heat of the day, taken in by the walls,  is radiated all the night long. I found the night punkah in almost  universal use but I thought I would get on without it, and used it very  seldom. When the next hot season came I was glad to conform to the  custom of the country, for I found when I had not the punkah I got up in  the morning so tired and weary that I was unfit for the work of the day.    The aspect of the country at that season is very dreary. Some trees  retain their freshness in the hottest weather; but not a blade of green  grass is to be seen, and the ground is scorched, scarred, and baked, as  if it had been turned into a desert.    [Sidenote: THE RAINY SEASON.]    A marvellous change is produced by the first heavy fall of rain. After  stifling heat for some days, the rays of the sun beating with a  fierceness which threatens to burn up all nature, and which drives the  birds for shelter to the thickest foliage of the trees, the clouds  gather, the thunder rolls, peal quickly succeeding peal, the lightning  flashes incessantly, and then, after some heavy showers, there comes  down for two or three days, with very little intermission, such torrents  that it looks as if we were to be visited with a deluge. Within a week  all nature is transformed. The parched earth gives way to the richest  green. We in our country say in very propitious weather that we see  things grow; but in India vegetation takes such a bound as it never does  in our temperate climate. Immediately after the downpour of rain, the  sun comes out in all its strength; and, under the action of heat and  moisture, vegetation progresses marvellously. The fields are quickly  ploughed, the seed, for which moisture and great heat is required, is  sown, and in the course of three or four weeks they are far above the  ground. Within three months the harvest of the rainy season, furnishing  the people with rice, maize, and other grains, which furnish the  principal food of the people, is gathered in.    The rainy season is productive in another and less pleasant manner. It  is as favourable to insect life as it is to vegetable life. Flying white  ants, flying bugs, and other unwelcome visitors of the same order, come  out in thousands. At night, if the doors be open the white ants make for  the lamps in such numbers that they are extinguished by them, and the  room is in the morning found strewed with their dead. It requires a  torpid temperament to remain calm under this visitation. All dislike it,  and some find it a grievous trial. As the rainy season advances, the  trouble abates, and by the time the cold weather sets in the ordinary  house-fly by day and the mosquito by night alone remain to buzz about  us. The mosquito has rightly got the first place among insect  tormentors. The house-fly is at all seasons, in some more than in  others, and gives not a little annoyance by its pertinacity.    The change at the commencement of the rainy season is delightful. The  doors are thrown open, and the dry, parching wind gives place to a  refreshing coolness. When the rain ceases, the heat returns; the weather  is very muggy, the skin is irritated by the excessive perspiration, and  many suffer more than during the hot season. When the rain is abundant  and frequent, the suffering is much less than when there is little rain  and much sun. There is one comfort at that time: we know we are going on  to the cold weather, which will make amends for all that went before.    I can hardly conceive any country to have a finer climate than that of  the North-West Provinces of India in the cold months. Rain does  sometimes fall during that season; it may fall at any time of the year.  I remember a heavy fall on the first of May, and about Christmas and the  New Year it is eagerly desired for the crops, but ordinarily from week  to week there is an unclouded sky. There is a cool, pleasant breeze from  the west. In the house it is not only cool but cold, so that a little  sunning is pleasant, and at night in December and January, especially  far up the country, fires are welcome. Then Europeans, so far as  circumstances permit, get into the open air and move freely about, with  everything in the climate to favour their travelling.    [Sidenote: THE COLD SEASON.]    The beginning of the cold weather is a very busy season with the  agricultural class, to which the great body of the people belong. If the  rainy season has been favourable, especially if heavy rain has fallen  towards its close, the wells are full, and from these, after the land  has been ploughed, and the seed sown for the rabee crop, the most  valuable crop of the year, the fields are irrigated. Whatever grows in  our land in summer grows in North-Western India at that season: wheat,  oats, barley, potatoes, carrots, are grown in abundance. About March the  harvest is reaped.    As I proceed with these reminiscences, I shall have frequent occasion to  refer to our North Indian winter, its scenes, and employments, and I  have thought it well to enter at some length into a description of its  peculiarities.    One thing I observed my first year which I had abundant opportunity to  observe afterwards. The weather so welcomed by Europeans is very trying  to most natives, especially to those of the humbler classes, whose  clothing is very scanty. They never try to get warm by taking exercise.  They cower in the morning and evening round a fire, which has commonly  for its fuel dried cow-manure, with a coarse blanket over their head and  shoulders. As the sun gets above the horizon, they plant themselves  against a wall to bask in its rays, and if they can, do not stir till  they are well heated. As might be expected, many of them suffer from  chronic rheumatism. The extreme heat is not liked by them, but from it  they suffer far less than from cold.    While most Europeans get new life in the cold weather, the little ones  showing by their rosy cheeks how much they are benefited, a few are in  better health when the weather is warm, as then they are less subject to  aguish attacks. The remark is often made by those who have much  sedentary work that they like the cold season for enjoyment, but find it  unfavourable for work, as they cannot keep so steadily at it as they can  when the heat keeps them within doors.    While giving the reminiscences of my first year, my mind has been  continually carried forward to the experience of after-years in  reference to the vernacular languages, the various classes with whom  residence in India brings one into contact, and the seasons of the  country. In giving partial expression to this experience under the  heading of my first year, I have gone far beyond it. Those who favour me  with the perusal of my narrative may perhaps find it more intelligible  by my having anticipated myself.    I must confess months of the first year passed before I ceased to feel  myself an exile. The scenes around were so unlike those of my own  country, the prevailing idolatry so repulsive, the society,  associations, and climate so different, that I turned from them to my  native land with many a fond longing look. This feeling of exile was no  doubt deepened by the illness in the family with whom I was residing.  We had an English service every Thursday evening, conducted by the  missionaries in the hall of the mission-house, but I greatly missed the  services on the Lord's-day to which I had been accustomed.
