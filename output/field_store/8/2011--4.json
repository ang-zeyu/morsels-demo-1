Met 'n lag om sy mond het hy bruilof gevier        Met 'n klein brokkie Engelse lood.        Vanmôre was Japie by my:        Vanaand is hy--waar?      As 'n mens maar kan weet, waar hy eindlik sal bly,        Wie het dan vir die toekoms gevaar?        Vanmôre was Japie my maat:        Vanaand is hy--wat?      Sal hy nog met my lag, sal hy nog met my praat,        Of my hand in die syne weer vat?        Vanmôre was Japie 'n kind:        Vanaand 's hy volleerd!      Ons het baie gestry om dié waarheid, ou vrind:        Weet jy nou, wie van ons had verkeerd?        Vanmôre was Japie--nee God!        Hy is nog vir my!      Want die dood kan nie skei nie, al is dit ons lot        Om alleen op die wêreld te bly.                  Op 'n Leiklip.          Hier onder die leiklip, daar rus (as hy rus:      Want wie weet, of waarlik die dood ons kan sus?)      My arme ou Vonk--en tog, arm is hy nie:      Hy het, wat hy wil: wie dit teenspreek, die lie.      Vir my was hy meer as 'n halfduisend pond,      As kind of as kneg--ja, al was hy 'n hond:      Ek het mos geen kneg nie, en ook nie 'n kind,      En Vonk was vir jare my beste ou vrind.      Hy het altyd gehelp, hy was altyd ook klaar,      Vir die grootste plesier, in die naarste gevaar.      Oordag het hy met my die veld rondgeloop,      En miskien nog 'n hasie geja op die koop.      In die aand het hy stil by die vuurherd gelê,      En ek het hom my hope en wense gesê:      Ons het same gepraat--ja, tot laat in die nag,      Tot die môrester daar was en amper die dag.      Was dit goed vir ou Vonk, dan verlaat hy sy plek      En kom staan by my stoel om my hande te lek:      Daarby het hy altyd gemeen: \"Ek verstaan,      Baas, al wat jy sê, en ek laat dit begaan.\"        Hier onder die leiklip, daar slaap (as hy slaap:      Is die dood maar 'n droom, wat 'n dier op kan raap?)      My liewe ou Vonk--want ek het hom nog lief!      My hart het hy gou weggesteel, as 'n dief;      Maar hy het my syne gegee--en ek vra,      Of 'n mens, soos die dier, so 'n ruil het gewa!      Ons harte is vol van gemors en verdriet,      En as steun in die lewe is hul maar 'n riet;      Maar die hart van ou Vonk was die hart van 'n kind--      En jy het hom vir my gegee, my ou vrind!      Ons het same die wêreld, hoe groot dit ook is,      Deurkruis; ons het same geniet en gemis;      En jy was vir my meer as kind of as kneg.      En nou is die wêreld weer leeg, wat jy 's weg--      Ek weet nie waarheen nie! Miskien is dit waar:      Soos rook in die lug gaan 'n mens uitmekaar,      En nog baie gouer 'n hond na die dood.      Jy het my die hand gegee, jy met jou poot;      Jy het my gesoen; ons het same gepraat:      En ek glo aan jou spook, Vonk, my liewe ou maat!        Hier onder die leiklip lê jy in jou graf:      Dis al, wat ek weet--want ons gissing is kaf.      Jy 's dood: dit staan vas, want ekself het jou hier      Begrawe, en sonder gebed, want 'n dier      Het tog nie 'n siel nie--so sê outa Kees:      Hy weet, want hy het mos diaken gewees,      En op eie houtjie die bidstond gelei      Daar bo in die sendingkerk. Ja, maar vir my,      (Al is dit nou sonde, waarvoor ek moet vrees!)      Het jy baie meer van 'n siel as ou Kees;      Jou oë was altyd so diep as die lug,      So hel as die hemel, so sag as 'n sug:      En agter die oë, daar lê tog verstand;      En agter verstand staan 'n siel by die hand--      'n Siel, wat nie somaar in niks nie verdwyn,      Of somaarso stiltjies in wolke verkwyn.        Jy 's dood--wat ons dood noem, wie weet wat dit is?      'n Slaap of 'n droom? Ag, 'n mens kan maar gis:      En dit is die moeite nie werd nie, want jy      Is altyd, ja altyd, my ou maat vir my.                  Op my ou Karoo.          Hier wil ek rus, op ons vaal Karoo,        Hier, waar die veld 'n leegte is,        Hier, by die slang en die akeldis,      Hier, met die hemel blou daarbo.        Grawe hier, boetie, 'n graf vir my:        Hier is ek tuis, my land is hier;        Hier, waar die korhaan bruilof vier--      Hier wil ek lê in ons grougeel klei.        Stel nie 'n klip of 'n kruis daarbo,        Skrywe geen teks, wat 'n mens kan lees;        Sê net: \"Hy slaap, waar hy wou wees--      Hier in die skoot van ons vaal Karoo.        \"Rond oor die wêreld het hy gereis:        Nêrens was uitkoms vir sy hart;        Orals was donker, die wolke swart,      Orals die wêreld vaal en grys.        Nou lê hy diep hier in die sand;        Nou slaap hy vas, want hy rus in sy graf:        Was hy 'n sondaar, dan is sy straf      Lank afgewerk in 'n vreemde land.        \"Praat van hom nie as 'n skuldenaar nie:        Hy het betaal tot die laaste toe;        Hy het gely--ja ons weet nie hoe!      Broer van almal, en maat van--wie?\"        Dit is jou rede oor my lyk,        Dit jou gedagte, as jy daar staan--        Daar by my graf, waar die volle maan      Deur God se vensters na onder kyk.        Laat vir my slaap, boetie! ek het vaak:        Dof is my oë, my siel is moeg;        Gaan jy maar voort met jou land te ploeg,      Tot ook jou siel in die duister raak.        Laat my alleen op die toekoms wag,        Hier in my graf op ons vaal Karoo.        Dek my met veldbossies, boetie! So,      Nou sal ek rus tot die laaste dag.                  My nuwe Vaderland.          Ek het so lief ons blougroen see,        Ons witgeskulpte strand:      Was ek geen Blikoor nie, dan was        Die see my vaderland.        My tuiste-veld is baie mooi,        In winter baie groen:      Ja, goudgeel blink die doringboom daar,        As son en wind hom soen.        My eie veld is baie nat        (Vervloek die tyd!) met bloed--      Daar sing vandag die mense nog        Van _Volk_ en _Heldemoed_!        Die see is baie, baie mooi,        Die see is blou en groen:      Daar 's niks so mooi die wêreld deur,        As son en wind hom soen.        Die see is vol met trane, vol,        Tot in sy hart, met bloed--      En tog sing nie die skulpe daar        Van _Volk_ en _Heldemoed_!        Ek is 'n Blikoor, want my wieg        Het op die veld gestaan;      Maar as ek na die branders kyk,        Loop oor my wang 'n traan.        My land is nie meer myne nie;        My volk is doodgestry;      My moed is nie meer heldemoed--        O God, vergewe my!        Ek wil nie, dat ek sterwe sal,        Geen pyn meer voel of leed;      'k Wil see toe, waar die koel wind waai;        Die veldson brand so heet.        Ek wil nie meer die mense eer,        Wat slegter is as vee--      Nie meer die volksgeskiednis lees        Met al sy leuens mee.        Ek wil vergeet en uithou: ja,        Ek kan nog jare ly,      Solank die branders tot my sing,        Die skulpe praat met my.        So lewe ek my lewe deur,        Neem, wat die lewe gee:      My volk sal nou die visse wees,        My vaderland die see.                  Vrede-aand.            Dis vrede, man; die oorlog is verby!      Hoor jy die mense skreeu die strate vol?      Sien jy, die hele wêreld is op hol?      Kom, hier 's 'n bottel soetwyn; laat ons drink!      Ons het ons nasie in die see gesink;      Ons het geen land meer nie: dis klaar met Kees!      Dis vrede nou: kom skreeu--of is jy hees      Van lag? Nou, lag maar, want die storie 's uit:      Ons nasie 's weg, ons kan daarnaar maar fluit!      Drink, drink jou glas! Die son skyn deur die wyn:      Is dit te soet, of smaak dit soos asyn?      Nou ja, dan kom hier by die venster staan      En skou met my al die gedoente aan.      Daar waai die vlag, daar word hoerê geskree:      Die aandeelmark rys weer, en ons daarmee!      Wat is ons land teenoor die aandeelmark?      Wat 'n kanarievoël teenoor 'n vark?      'n Lelieblom teenoor 'n stronk tabak?      Ons nasie, wat so wild was, is nou mak      En kan getrein word soos 'n jong bobjaan,      Wat, as hy steeks is, jy weer goed kan slaan.        Hoerê! hoerê! Skreeu saam met my:        Dis vrede nou; die oorlog is verby!          Dis vrede, man; die oorlog is verby!      Hoor jy daaragter, hoe die mense huil?      Hoor jy 'n sug, 'n klag?--Dis maar 'n uil:      Die voëls is orals rond, selfs in die stad,      En orals skreeu hul, orals om ons pad:      Hul weet, ons was ook uile! Ons hou saam      'n Bondskongres hier, net soos dit betaam;      Passeer mooi resolusies; maak geraas,      En groot lawaai; en trek dan soos 'n haas,      Wat bang is vir die roer, weer in die hol,      En sit daar van die bewerasie vol!      Nou is die storie uit: die leë glas      Staan droog, wat vroeër so vol met water was;      Die put, wat eenmaal water het gegee,      Is vol met trane, souter as die see--      So brak as ooit 'n pan in die woestyn,      Waarop die son al dae helder skyn--      En bitter net soos gal, want in die put      Het al ons volk hul trane afgeskud;      En ons moet daarvan drink, die jare deur,      Al sal die smaak ons hart en siel verskeur.        Nee, boetie, nee, kom skreeu hoerê met my:        Dis vrede nou; die oorlog is verby!          Dis vrede, man; die oorlog is verby!      Sien jy die strate vol? Ek sien 'n ramp,      'n Kerkhof by 'n konsentrasiekamp      Met duisend graffies, elk waarvan bewaar      'n Skat, wat alles was, wat God aan haar      Gegewe het om eenmaal aan ons land,      In tyd van nood, toe te vertrou as pand:      Sy was die sterkste van ons almal, sy      Die met gebed en hoop het meegestry!      Sy het die swaarste deel van onse lot      Gedra, gehelp, getroos, gesteun deur God:      En as jy daaraan dink, dan moet jy glo--      Al twyfel jy--, daar is tog Iemand bo,      Die so 'n vrou tot yster maak en staal,      Met soveel troos haar steun en hoop betaal;      Maar dan weer dink jy aan haar smart en aan      Die graffies, wat daar op die kerkhof staan,      En voel weer twyfel, want 'n mens is swak!      Waarom het Hy die boom gesnoei, die tak      So afgekap tot aan die stam? Waarom      Het Hy haar lot so skeef gemaak en krom?

He made the best of  his way towards it, and found that it came from a splendid palace, the  windows of which were all blazing with light. It had great bronze  gates, standing wide open, and fine court-yards, through which the  merchant passed; but not a living soul was to be seen. There were  stables too, which his poor, starved horse, less scrupulous than  himself, entered at once, and took a good meal of oats and hay. His  master then tied him up, and walked towards the entrance hall, but  still without seeing a single creature. He went on to a large  dining-parlour, where he found a good fire, and a table covered with  some very nice dishes, but only one plate with a knife and fork. As  the snow and rain had wetted him to the skin, he went up to the fire  to dry himself. \"I hope,\" said he, \"the master of the house or his  servants will excuse me, for it surely will not be long now before I  see them.\" He waited some time, but still nobody came: at last the  clock struck eleven, and the merchant, being quite faint for the want  of food, helped himself to a chicken, and to a few glasses of wine,  yet all the time trembling with fear. He sat till the clock struck  twelve, and then, taking courage, began to think he might as well look  about him: so he opened a door at the end of the hall, and went  through it into a very grand room, in which there was a fine bed; and  as he was feeling very weary, he shut the door, took off his clothes,  and got into it.    It was ten o'clock in the morning before he awoke, when he was amazed  to see a handsome new suit of clothes laid ready for him, instead of  his own, which were all torn and spoiled. \"To be sure,\" said he to  himself, \"this place belongs to some good fairy, who has taken pity on  my ill luck.\" He looked out of the window, and instead of the  snow-covered wood, where he had lost himself the previous night, he  saw the most charming arbours covered with all kinds of flowers.  Returning to the hall where he had supped, he found a breakfast table,  ready prepared. \"Indeed, my good fairy,\" said the merchant aloud, \"I  am vastly obliged to you for your kind care of me.\" He then made a  hearty breakfast, took his hat, and was going to the stable to pay his  horse a visit; but as he passed under one of the arbours, which was  loaded with roses, he thought of what Beauty had asked him to bring  back to her, and so he took a bunch of roses to carry home. At the  same moment he heard a loud noise, and saw coming towards him a beast,  so frightful to look at that he was ready to faint with fear.  \"Ungrateful man!\" said the beast in a terrible voice, \"I have saved  your life by admitting you into my palace, and in return you steal my  roses, which I value more than anything I possess. But you shall atone  for your fault: you shall die in a quarter of an hour.\"    The merchant fell on his knees, and clasping his hands, said, \"Sir, I  humbly beg your pardon: I did not think it would offend you to gather  a rose for one of my daughters, who had entreated me to bring her one  home. Do not kill me, my lord!\"    \"I am not a lord, but a beast,\" replied the monster; \"I hate false  compliments: so do not fancy that you can coax me by any such ways.  You tell me that you have daughters; now I suffer you to escape, if  one of them will come and die in your stead. If not, promise that you  will yourself return in three months, to be dealt with as I may  choose.\"    The tender-hearted merchant had no thoughts of letting any one of his  daughters die for his sake; but he knew that if he seemed to accept  the beast's terms, he should at least have the pleasure of seeing them  once again. So he gave his promise, and was told he might then set off  as soon as he liked. \"But,\" said the beast, \"I do not wish you to go  back empty-handed. Go to the room you slept in, and you will find a  chest there; fill it with whatsoever you like best, and I will have it  taken to your own house for you.\"    When the beast had said this, he went away. The good merchant, left to  himself, began to consider that as he must die--for he had no thought  of breaking a promise, made even to a beast--he might as well have the  comfort of leaving his children provided for. He returned to the room  he had slept in, and found there heaps of gold pieces lying about. He  filled the chest with them to the very brim, locked it, and, mounting  his horse, left the palace as sorrowful as he had been glad when he  first beheld it. The horse took a path across the forest of his own  accord, and in a few hours they reached the merchant's house. His  children came running round him, but, instead of kissing them with  joy, he could not help weeping as he looked at them. He held in his  hand the bunch of roses, which he gave to Beauty saying, \"Take these  roses, Beauty; but little do you think how dear they have cost your  poor father;\" and then he gave them an account of all that he had seen  or heard in the palace of the beast.    The two eldest sisters now began to shed tears, and to lay the blame  upon Beauty, who, they said, would be the cause of her father's death.  \"See,\" said they, \"what happens from the pride of the little wretch;  why did not she ask for such things as we did? But, to be sure, Miss  must not be like other people; and though she will be the cause of her  father's death, yet she does not shed a tear.\"    \"It would be useless,\" replied Beauty, \"for my father shall not die.  As the beast will accept of one of his daughters, I will give myself  up, and be only too happy to prove my love for the best of fathers.\"    \"No, sister,\" said the three brothers with one voice, \"that cannot be;  we will go in search of this monster, and either he or we will  perish.\"    \"Do not hope to kill him,\" said the merchant, \"his power is far too  great. But Beauty's young life shall not be sacrificed: I am old, and  cannot expect to live much longer; so I shall but give up a few years  of my life, and shall only grieve for the sake of my children.\"    \"Never, father!\" cried Beauty: \"If you go back to the palace, you  cannot hinder my going after you; though young, I am not over-fond of  life; and I would much rather be eaten up by the monster, than die of  grief for your loss.\"    The merchant in vain tried to reason with Beauty, who still  obstinately kept to her purpose; which, in truth, made her two sisters  glad, for they were jealous of her, because everybody loved her.    The merchant was so grieved at the thoughts of losing his child, that  he never once thought of the chest filled with gold, but at night, to  his great surprise, he found it standing by his bedside. He said  nothing about his riches to his eldest daughters, for he knew very  well it would at once make them want to return to town; but he told  Beauty his secret, and she then said, that while he was away, two  gentlemen had been on a visit at their cottage, who had fallen in love  with her two sisters. She entreated her father to marry them without  delay, for she was so sweet-natured, she only wished them to be happy.    Three months went by, only too fast, and then the merchant and Beauty  got ready to set out for the palace of the beast. Upon this, the two  sisters rubbed their eyes with an onion, to make believe they were  crying; both the merchant and his sons cried in earnest. Only Beauty  shed no tears. They reached the palace in a very few hours, and the  horse, without bidding, went into the same stable as before. The  merchant and Beauty walked towards the large hall, where they found a  table covered with every dainty, and two plates laid ready. The  merchant had very little appetite; but Beauty, that she might the  better hide her grief, placed herself at the table, and helped her  father; she then began to eat herself, and thought all the time that,  to be sure, the beast had a mind to fatten her before he ate her up,  since he had provided such good cheer for her. When they had done  their supper, they heard a great noise, and the good old man began to  bid his poor child farewell, for he knew it was the beast coming to  them. When Beauty first saw that frightful form, she was very much  terrified, but tried to hide her fear. The creature walked up to her,  and eyed her all over--then asked her in a dreadful voice if she had  come quite of her own accord.    \"Yes,\" said Beauty.    \"Then you are a good girl, and I am very much obliged to you.\"    This was such an astonishingly civil answer that Beauty's courage  rose: but it sank again when the beast, addressing the merchant,  desired him to leave the palace next morning, and never return to it  again. \"And so good night, merchant. And good night, Beauty.\"    \"Good night, beast,\" she answered, as the monster shuffled out of the  room.    \"Ah! my dear child,\" said the merchant, kissing his daughter, \"I am  half dead already, at the thought of leaving you with this dreadful  beast; you shall go back and let me stay in your place.\"    \"No,\" said Beauty, boldly, \"I will never agree to that; you must go  home to-morrow morning.\"    They then wished each other good night, and went to bed, both of them  thinking they should not be able to close their eyes; but as soon as  ever they had lain down, they fell into a deep sleep, and did not  awake till morning. Beauty dreamed that a lady came up to her, who  said, \"I am very much pleased, Beauty, with the goodness you have  shown, in being willing to give your life to save that of your father.  Do not be afraid of anything; you shall not go without a reward.\"    As soon as Beauty awoke, she told her father this dream; but though it  gave him some comfort, he was a long time before he could be persuaded  to leave the palace. At last Beauty succeeded in getting him safely  away.    When her father was out of sight, poor Beauty began to weep sorely;  still, having naturally a courageous spirit, she soon resolved not to  make her sad case still"]]]
