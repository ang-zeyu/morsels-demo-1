The semicircular arches which  support the roof spring from the capitals of the main arcade, and are  merely wide bands of stone, without moulding or adornment of any kind.  The intermediate spaces are equally plain, each compartment simply  taking the quadripartite form (without vaulting-ribs) to accommodate it  to the arcading on which it rests. The ceiling has been repaired with  stone, and overlaid with plaster in the panels, but the design has been  left undisturbed, as a specimen of early vaulting, rare enough to be  worth preserving.[5]    [Illustration: THE AMBULATORY AND ENTRANCE TO THE LADY CHAPEL                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    Perpendicular work occurs here and there throughout the ambulatory,  conspicuously in the three recesses in the exterior wall on the north,  each of which contains a three-light window in that style. The first and  second of these recesses, or small chapels, are open to the ground  level; but the third (nearest the east) has been walled up beneath the  window sill. Beyond it is the door of the clergy vestry, which occupies  the site of another chapel: and in the curve of the wall towards the  Lady Chapel there is a tablet which usually attracts attention for the  curious device upon it--three pillars crowned by a garland of roses--and  the poetical conceit of the epitaph, which explains the emblem, and  otherwise speaks for itself:                              Sacred      To the memory of that worthy and lerned      Francis Anthony, Doctor in Physick.      There needs no verse to beautify thy praise,      Or keepe in memory thy spotless name.      Religion, virtue, and thy skil did raise      A threefold pillar to thy lasting Fame;      Though poisenous envye ever sought to blame      Or hyde the fruits of thy intention,      Yet shall they all commend that high desygne      Of purest gold to make a medicine      That feel thy helpe by that thy rare invention.      He dyed the 26th of May 1623, of his age 74.      His loving sonne John Anthony, doctor in physick,      Left this remembrance of his sorrow. He dyed      ye 28th April 1655, being aged 70 years, and was      buried nere this place, and left behind him 1 sone and 3 daughters.[6]    [Illustration: THE MILDMAY MONUMENT                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    Before leaving this northern side of the ambulatory it may be noticed  that the pavement is made up of an intermixture of gravestones with  encaustic tiles. The latter are not so old as they look, for they only  date from 1863, when the floor was reduced to its original level,  exactly twenty-seven inches below that which was removed, as shown by  the marks on the wall backing Rahere's tomb, at the line where the  pavement was taken away. The advantage as regards the proportions of the  church is obvious enough; but a question has been opened as to whether  the intermediate pavement was really so modern as had been taken for  granted. It is suggested to the contrary that it may have been first  introduced during the Middle Ages, when the increasing veneration for  the East required a greater elevation for that part of the church, to  distinguish it from the less sacred nave, and give proper dignity to the  High Altar and its surroundings. In some accounts it is positively  stated that the floor was raised two feet six inches by Prior Bolton  early in the sixteenth century.    Continuing our perambulation past the Lady Chapel and Prior Bolton's  door (now leading into the choir vestry) at the eastern end of the south  wall, we come to the magnificent #Tomb of Sir Walter Mildmay#. It formerly  stood facing that of the Founder in the sanctuary, but was shifted to  its present place in 1865, and renovated by Henry Bingham Mildmay in  1870, as stated in an inscription upon it, which, however, shows more  signs of decay than any other part of the monument, and is scarcely  legible. This very fine altar tomb is composed of various coloured  marbles, panelled and gilded in a design combining the Elizabethan form  with the classical ornament of the Renaissance, and is remarkable for  the absence of figures usually conspicuous in monuments of the same age.  This peculiarity is perhaps accounted for by the strong Puritan leanings  of Sir Walter, who took no pains to conceal them in his lifetime. He  founded Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1583, where his architectural  work is pointed out, in illustration of his principles, as running  counter to all the traditions of the Dominican Friars, whose buildings  came into his hands after the Dissolution, and formed the nucleus of his  foundation. Instead of saints and angels, or kneeling effigies, we have  here eight shields of arms, showing the family alliances, arranged in  panelling round the central inscription:        Hic jacent Gualterus Mildmay, miles, et      Maria uxor ejus. Ipse obiit ultimo die      Maii 1589. Ipsa 16 die Martii 1576.      Reliquierunt duos filios et tres filias.      Fundavit Collegium Emanuelis Cantabrigiae.      Moritur Cancellarius et Sub-Thesaurarius      Scaccarii et Regiae Majestati a Consiliis.    (= Here lie Walter Mildmay, Knight, and Mary his wife. He died the last  day of May, 1589. She the 16th day of March, 1576. They left two sons  and three daughters. He founded Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He died  Chancellor and Sub-Treasurer of the Exchequer, and a Member of Her  Majesty's Council.)    There is a commendable absence of eulogy in the epitaph, and, instead of  any direct quotation from scripture, the motto, _Mors nobis lucrum_ is  given, as an adaptation of Phil. i, 21. The tomb is surmounted by three  classical urns and the escutcheon of the deceased, with the legend,  _Virtute non vi_. Sir Walter was one of the Royal Commissioners  appointed in 1586 for the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, at Fotheringhay  Castle.    There are numerous other monuments in the church, and there were  formerly many more than now remain, but those selected for description  are the most important and the most interesting for their artistic  merit.    The first rector of the parish, Sir John Deane, is commemorated in a  modern brass (1893) let into the pavement of the ambulatory on the  southern side of the chancel. It was inserted by the pupils of the  Witton Grammar School, Northwich, founded by Sir John in the year 1557.    #The Lady Chapel# is a restoration of that built about the year 1410. At  the Dissolution it passed into the hands of Sir Richard Rich, who  converted it into a dwelling-house, and in more modern times it was  occupied by a fringe manufacturer, as related in our historical sketch.  The building was recovered by purchase in 1885, and the reconstruction  begun, which was completed eleven years later. There are signs of an  earlier chapel on the site, which was considerably altered, or entirely  rebuilt, in the fourteenth century, as appeared from the architectural  remains of that period discovered within the fifteenth-century  fabric--itself in a frightful state of dilapidation--when the  restoration was taken in hand.    [Illustration: THE LADY CHAPEL                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    Though every care has been taken to preserve the old work, with a  strict adherence to the general design, the greater part of the chapel  is necessarily new. It is separated from the ambulatory by an elegant  screen of ironwork, surmounted by a crucifix of white metal, which has  been blackened into uniformity with the rest of the screen so that it  can hardly be distinguished in the dim light. This characteristic of the  church is preserved in the chapel by the omission of an east window. In  place of it the wall-space above the altar is laid out in an arcading of  five niches, with canopies and pedestals arranged in parallel lines,  providing for a double row of statues, not yet inserted. The lower part  of the wall is curtained, with a small canopy over the altar, containing  an oil painting of the Virgin and Child as an appropriate form of  reredos. There are three rather large windows on each side, of which  those on the south are entirely new, but the sills and jambs on the  north show a retention of fifteenth-century work. This appears again in  the walls on either side of the sanctuary, each of which contains an  arcaded recess of three divisions (the central glazed), those on the  south forming the sedilia. The sanctuary is paved with Roman tesserae  and coloured marbles, in agreement with the pavement beneath the High  Altar, but of a less elaborate pattern.[7]    [Illustration: THE CRYPT                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    #The Crypt# beneath the Lady Chapel has no internal connection with it,  but is entered by an outside door in the south wall. Like the rest of  the Priory buildings it has gone through many vicissitudes. Obviously  built at the same time as the chapel, it is supposed to have been used  originally as a receptacle for the bones exhumed from time to time in  the neighbouring canons' cemetery. Passing into secular hands at the  Dissolution, it was partly filled up with earth, and then used as a coal  and wine cellar to the dwelling-house above, and eventually formed part  of the manufactory before mentioned, the marks of which have been left  here and there upon the walls. The little building is now equipped as a  mortuary chapel, with an altar against the east wall, and an oblong  space marked off on the floor before it, with the usual lateral  candlesticks, for the reception of a corpse. As a general rule, however,  the funeral services are held in the choir, where there are greater  facilities. Though extremely simple, the architectural features are very  interesting, the old work having been retained in the walls, piers, and  windows, the vaulting alone being new.

DAVIS died on the 15th June, at the age of 84. He had been  for two or three years enfeebled, and for the last year confined to his  room, but he retained his mental faculties and his physical powers until  after his eightieth year, owing, in great measure, to the temperance of  his habits, his fondness for exercise, and his elastic, hopeful  temperament. Mr. Davis was preeminently a politician through life, and  aided to organize and give triumph to \"the Republican party,\" so called,  more than half a century ago, when the Federal or Washingtonian party  was prostrated not more by its own follies than by the ability and tact  of its leading adversaries. Half the good management and efficient  activity that served to elect Jefferson would have sufficed to defeat  him. And nowhere was the battle of Democracy fought with greater address  or against more formidable odds than in this State and City, under the  consummate generalship of Aaron Burr, of whom Davis was the untiring  lieutenant and confidential friend.    Though so long and so deeply immersed in Politics, possessing decided  talents and a thorough knowledge of public affairs, Mr. Davis never held  any prominent office. He did not seem to be an ambitious man. He was  once wealthy, and became poor, but he never seemed elated by prosperity  nor humbled by adversity. He was not a fortunate politician, and he  seemed to love the smoke of the battle more than the plunder of the  field. He was quite often on the unlucky side--for Crawford in '24--for  Adams in '28--for Clay in '32,--and so on. His side was taken from  impulse and personal liking, not from selfish calculation. He had known  almost every man who figures in the history of our country since the  Revolutionary era, and, while his faculties remained, his conversation  was remarkably instructive and entertaining. In early life Mr. Davis was  engaged in trade, and was moderately successful, but he gave up business  to devote himself more entirely to politics, He reentered commercial  life before the last war with England, and his house (Davis & Strong)  was fortunate in South American speculations, of the profits of which he  himself received some $50,000, which, however, was soon lost. For half a  century he was an industrious writer. He produced several very clever  pamphlets upon men and affairs, and was for many years known as \"The Spy  in Washington\" for the _Courier and Enquirer_, and \"The Genevese  Traveler\" for the _London Times_. Burr bequeathed to him all his papers,  and from these and his memoranda and recollections he prepared and  published, in 1838, \"Memoirs of Aaron Burr, with Miscellaneous  Selections from his Correspondence,\" in 2 vols. 8vo., and \"The Private  Journal of Aaron Burr during his Residence of Four Years in Europe, with  Selections from his Correspondence,\" 2 vols. 8vo.           *       *       *       *       *    REV. JOSEPH SAMUEL C. F. FREY, a well-known Baptist clergyman, died at  Pontiac, Michigan, in the 79th year of his age, on the 5th of June. He  was born of Jewish parents, in Germany, and was for several years reader  in a Synagogue. When about twenty-five years old, he became a Christian,  and soon after a student of divinity at Berlin. He was subsequently  engaged nearly all the time in efforts to convert the Jews. It was at  his suggestion that the London Missionary Society for Promoting  Christianity among the Jews, was founded, in 1808. In 1816 he came to  the United States, and was for a time pastor of a Presbyterian Church in  this city, but changing his views upon the subject of baptism, he joined  the Baptist Church, and was settled over congregations at Newark and at  Sing Sing, until, through his means, the Society for Meliorating the  Condition of the Jews was founded, and he became its missionary. He  wrote several books, which display considerable learning and an amiable  and honorable temper. The most popular of his productions is one  entitled \"Joseph and Benjamin,\" designed to illustrate the points of  difference between the Jews and Christians.          _SCIENTIFIC MISCELLANIES._      MR. PAINE'S HYDRO-ELECTRIC LIGHT.--All the past eras that are marked by  especial characteristics and glories must yield before our own, the AGE  OF DISCOVERY, which bequeaths to the new generations so many  applications of steam and electricity, so many inventions in all the  arts, and such vast enterprises undertaken and accomplished for the good  of mankind. These, as the _Tribune_ eloquently says, are the immortal  monuments of our times, and dwarf earlier performances into a very  inferior position. What are the pyramids to a line of steamships? What  is there in Homer or Plato worthy to be mentioned on the day when  Professor Morse sets up his telegraph, and mightier than Jupiter, the  cloud-compeller, with the lightnings of Heaven flashes intelligence from  Halifax to New Orleans, as rapidly as the behests of the mind reach the  fingers? How petty and narrow seem the ambition and desires of Alexander  or Napoleon when the bold and prophetic genius of Whitney, dealing with  continents and nations as with parishes and neighborhoods, stretches his  iron road around half the globe and shows you, moving forward and  backward over its rails, the flux and reflux of a world's commerce and  intercourse, a sublime tide of benefits and universal relations! What  poet, what artist, what philosopher, what statesman, has equalled in  grandeur these conceptions of science, or the splendid results which  have followed their practical realization? Not one. And the reason of  this is plain. These things are filled with the spirit of future  centuries, while our Art, Literature, Statesmanship, Philosophy, are  either mere dead relics of the past, or the poor makeshifts of a  present, not yet equal to the business Providence has given it to  perform.    It is claimed for Mr. Paine that he has found out the means of producing  the greatest revolution which physical science can well be supposed to  make in the business and comfort of society. As far as we apprehend his  claim, it is that he has established as a new principle of science that  electricity possesses the qualities of weight, compressibility and  gravitation; that he has proved water to be in reality a simple  elemental substance, which he can decompose or transform into either  hydrogen or oxygen gas according to its electrical condition, and  according as positive or negative electricity is applied to it; and that  he has invented the means whereby from water he can produce at will  either of these gases without any other than mechanical agency and with  no expense save that of the machine, which will cost at the outset $400  or $500, and last for an indefinite period. If this is true, it is  unquestionably the greatest discovery of modern times, and will produce  a change in affairs of all sorts so profound and extensive as to surpass  and bewilder the mind which seeks to imagine it. When with a pail of  water you can without expense light and heat your house; when coal mines  are useless, and steamships draw their fuel from the waves they  traverse; then the comforts and luxuries of life, and the means of  traveling will be diminished in price so as to come within the ability  of every man; a great deal of the most toilsome and disagreeable work  now performed will become unnecessary; and a vast step will be made  toward a more just and equal distribution of social advantages. Mr.  Paine is now engaged at the Astor House in preparations to light that  immense hotel with his hydro-electric gas, and the result of his  experiment is looked for with profound interest. We confess little faith  in his success.           *       *       *       *       *    The story of an American inventor named REMINGTON--who a year or two  since addressed to the late Mr. Senator Lewis, of Alabama, a history of  his adventures, which was published in the _Merchant's Magazine_--must  be well-remembered, for its intrinsic interest, and on account of the  denials and refutations of portions of it by certain persons in London  to whom allusion was made in Mr. Remington's letter. The invention, the  Remington Bridge, seems now to be exciting no little attention both in  England and in this country. The principle which gives to it its great  strength, is the peculiar construction of its longitudinal supporters,  investing them with all the tenacity that wood has when it is sought to  be drawn apart. Thus it is capable of sustaining as great weight as  would be required to _pull asunder the fibres_ of the longitudinal  supporters. No wooden bridge can be built of so great a span. Mr.  Remington believes that he can build a span at least 1320 feet in  length, while the span of the old wooden bridge at Fairmount, near  Philadelphia, which was one of the largest in the world, was but little  over 300 feet. The annals of mechanical art afford few instances where a  great invention has been developed and prosecuted under apparently more  adverse circumstances.           *       *       *       *       *    NEW PLANET.--The _Tempo_, of Naples, publishes a letter from M.
