A surf such as I had never yet seen had arisen. I stood and anxiously  watched through a glass the boats at the steamer's side, and at length,  to my relief, I saw one of them leave her, but as it came near I saw, to  my surprise, that Mr. Bransome was not in the boat, and that it was not  the one that Sooka steered. Quickly it was overtaken by the breakers,  but escaped their power, and came inshore on the back of a majestic  roller that did not break until it was close to the beach, where the  boat was in safety.    Not without vague apprehension at his imprudence, but still not  anticipating any actual harm from it, I thought that Mr. Bransome had  chosen to come back in Sooka's boat, and I waited and waited to see _it_  return, although the daylight had now so waned that I could no longer  distinguish what was going on alongside the steamer. At last I caught  sight of the boat, a white speck upon the waters, and, just as it  entered upon the dangerous part of the bar, I discerned to my infinite  amazement, that two figures were seated in the stern--a man and a  woman--a white woman; I could see her dress fluttering in the wind, and  Sooka's black figure standing behind her.    On came the boat, impelled by the swift-flowing seas, for a quarter of  an hour it was tossed on the crests of the waves. Again and again it  rose and sank with them as they came rolling in, but somehow, after  a little further time, it seemed to me that it did not make such way  toward the shore as it should have done.    I lifted the glass to my eyes, and I saw that the boys were hardly  pulling at all, though the boat was not close to the rocks that were  near the cliff. Nor did Sooka seem to be conscious of a huge roller that  was swiftly approaching him. In my excitement I was just on the point of  shouting to warn those in the boat of their danger, although I knew that  they could not understand what I might say, when I saw Jackson standing  on the edge of the cliff, a little way off, dressed in his shirt and  trousers only. He had escaped from the house! He perceived that I saw  him, and came running up on me, and I threw myself on my guard. However,  he did not attempt to touch me, but stopped and cried:    \"Did I not tell you that somebody would be drowned by those waves? Watch  that boat! watch it! it is doomed; and the scoundrel, the villain, who  is in it will never reach the shore alive!\" and he hissed the last word  through his clenched teeth.    \"Good God, Jackson!\" I said, \"don't say that! Look, there is a white  woman in the boat!\"    At the words his jaw dropped, his form, which a moment before had swayed  with excitement, became rigid, and his eyes stared at me as if he knew,  but comprehended not, what I had said. Then he slowly turned his face  toward the sea, and, as he did so, the mighty breaker that had been  coming up astern of the boat curled over it. For a moment or two it  rushed forward, a solid body of water, carrying the boat with it; and  in those moments I saw, to my horror, Sooka give one sweep with his oar,  which threw the boat's side toward the roller. I saw the boat-boys leap  clear of the boat into the surf; I saw the agonised faces of the man and  the woman upturned to the wave above them, and then the billow broke,  and nothing was seen but a sheet of frothy water. The boat and those in  it had disappeared. For the crew I had little concern--I knew they would  come ashore safely enough; but for Mr. Bransome and the woman,  whoever she was, there was little hope. They had not had time to throw  themselves into the sea before the boat had capsized, and their clothing  would sink them in such a surf, even if they had escaped being crushed  by the boat. Besides, I feared there had been some foul play on the part  of Sooka. Quickly as he had done it, I had seen him with his oar put the  boat beyond the possibility of escaping from the wave, and I remembered  how he had been treated by Bransome.    With such thoughts I ran along the cliff to the pathway that led down to  the beach; and as I ran, I saw Jackson running before me, not steadily  or rightly, but heavily, and swaying from side to side as he went.  Quickly I passed him, but he gave no sign that he knew any one was near  him; and as I leaped down on to the first ledge of rock below me, I saw  that he was not following me, but had disappeared among the brushwood.    When I got down to the beach, I found that the boat's crew had reached  the shore in safety, but of the two passengers nothing had been seen.  The capsized boat was sometimes visible as it lifted on the rollers,  but through my glass I saw that no one was clinging to it. I called for  Sooka, but Sooka was missing. Every one had seen him land, but he had  disappeared mysteriously. In vain I questioned the other boys as to the  cause of the disaster. The only answer I could get out of them was an  appeal to look to the sea and judge for myself. The woman was a  white woman from the big ship, was all they could say about her; and,  negro-like, they evidently considered the loss of a woman or so of very  little consequence.    All I could do was to set a watch along the beach to look for the bodies  when they should be washed ashore, and this done, I returned to the  factory. My next desire was to find Sooka. He could hardly have gone  far, so I sent for a runner to take a message to the native king under  whose protection we on the Point were, and after whom the Point was  called, and who was bound to find the missing man for me if he could, or  if he had not been bribed to let him pass.    In my sorrow at what had happened, and in my doubt as to the cause of  it, I had forgotten all about Jackson; but after I had despatched  my messenger to the king, I went to look for him. I discovered him  crouching in a corner of his own bedroom in the dark.    \"Are they found?\" he asked, in a voice so hollow and broken that I  hardly knew it; and before I could answer him, he whispered to himself,  \"No, no; they are drowned--drowned.\"    I tried to lead him into the lighted dining-room, but he only crouched  the closer to his corner. At length by the promise of the ever-potent  temptation, liquor, I got him to leave the room. He could scarcely walk,  though, now, and he trembled so violently that I was glad to give him  part of a bottle of brandy that I had by me. He filled a tumbler half  full of the spirits, and drank it off. This put strength into him, and  for a little he was calm; but as he again and again applied himself to  the bottle, he became drunk, and swore at me for my impudence in giving  orders without his sanction. On this I tried to take the bottle from  him, but he clutched it so firmly that I had to let it go; whereupon he  immediately put it to his lips and swallowed the rest of the liquor that  was in it. After which he gave a chuckle, and staggered to a couch, on  which he tumbled, and lay with his eyes open for a long while. At last  he fell asleep, but I was too nervous to do likewise, and sat watching  him the most of the night; at least, when I awoke it was daylight, and  it seemed to me that I had been asleep for a few minutes.    Jackson was still lying on the couch, and his face was calm and peaceful  as he softly breathed. The morning, too, was fine, and as I walked on to  the veranda I saw the sea sparkling in the sunlight, and there was not  a sound from it save a far-off and drowsy murmur. Not a sign remained  on its broad surface of the wrath of the day before. It was wonderfully  calm. Lying here and there on the veranda, rolled up in their clothes,  were the servants of the factory, sleeping soundly on the hard planks.    Presently, as the sun rose in the heavens and warmed the air, the place  began to show signs of life, and one of the watch that I had set on the  beach came running across the yard to tell me that the bodies had come  ashore.    Immediately upon hearing this I called the hammock-bearers together,  and going down to the beach, I went a considerable way along it toward  a dark spot, which I knew to be a group of natives. On coming up to the  group, I found at least fifty negroes collected round the drowned man  and woman, all chattering and squabbling among themselves, and probably  over the plunder, for I saw that the bodies had been stripped to  their underclothing. Rushing into the crowd, with the aid of a stick  I dispersed it, so far as to make the wretches stand back. The man, of  course, was Bransome, there was no doubt as to that, although he had  received a terrible blow on the left temple, most likely from the  pointed stem of the boat as it had toppled over upon him, and his face  was distorted and twisted to one side. The woman was evidently English,  young and pretty, although her long hair, heavy and wet, was polluted by  the sand that stuck to it, and her half-open eyes were filled with  the same. On her lips there lingered a slight smile. She was of middle  height, of slender figure, and delicately nurtured, as the small  bare feet and little hands showed. As I looked at the latter I saw a  wedding-ring on her finger, and I thought, \"It is Bransome's wife.\" I  tried to take the ring away, but it would not come off her finger--which  I might have known, because the natives would not have left it there  had they been able to remove it. I then ordered the bearers to lay the  bodies in the hammocks; and that done, our little party wended its way  along the shore homeward, while the natives I had dispersed followed one  after another in African fashion.    Arrived at the factory, I bade the boys place the bodies side by side on  a spare bed in an empty room, and then I sent them to dig a grave in the  little burial-ground on the Point, where two or three worm-eaten wooden  crosses "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19800"],[0,"London and the Kingdom - Volume 1 (#10)"],[1,"of the  Londoners, who throughout the long period of civil dissension, were  generally to be found on the winning side, and held as it were the balance  between the rival powers, Stephen managed after considerable bloodshed to  capture the fortifications erected by the Earl at Farringdon.(132)    (M89)    The earl was subsequently treacherously arrested and made to give up his  castles. Thenceforth his life was that of a marauding freebooter, until,  fatally wounded at the siege of Burwell, he expired in September, 1143.    (M90)    Notwithstanding the absence of the empress and the death of the faithless  earl, a desultory kind of war continued to be carried on for the next ten  years on behalf of Henry of Anjou, son of the empress. In 1153 that prince  arrived in England to fight his own battles and maintain his right to the  crown, which the king had already attempted to transfer to the head of his  own son Eustace. This attempt had been foiled by the refusal of the  bishops, at the instigation of the pope, to perform the ceremony. The  sudden death of Eustace made the king more ready to enter into  negotiations for effecting a peaceful settlement.    (M91) (M92)    A compromise was accordingly effected at Winchester,(133) whereby Stephen  was to remain in undisputed possession of the throne for life, and after  his death was to be succeeded by Henry. The news that at last an end had  come to the troubles which for nineteen years had disturbed the country,  was received with universal joy, and Henry, conducted to London by the  king himself, was welcomed in a manner befitting one who was now the  recognised heir to the crown.(134)            CHAPTER III.          (M93)    Both London and Winchester had been laid in ashes during Stephen's reign,  the former by a conflagration--which took place in 1136, again destroying  St. Paul's and extending from London Bridge to the church of St. Clement  Danes--the latter by the burning missiles used in the conflict between  Stephen and the empress in 1141. Winchester never recovered her position,  and London was left without a rival. Fitz-Stephen, who wrote an account of  the city as it stood in the reign of Henry II, describes it as holding its  head higher than all others; its fame was wider known; its wealth and  merchandise extended further than any other; it was the capital of the  kingdom (_regni Anglorum sedes_).(135)    (M94)    It was through the mediation of an intimate friend and fellow citizen of  Fitz-Stephen that Archbishop Theobald had invited Henry of Anjou over from  France in 1153. Thomas of London, better known as Thomas Becket, although  of foreign descent, was born in the heart of the city, having first seen  the light in the house of Gilbert, his father, some time Portreeve of  London, situate in Cheapside on a site now occupied by the hall and chapel  of the Mercers' Chapel. Having been ordained a deacon of the Church, he  became in course of time clerk or chaplain to the archbishop. Vigorous and  active as he was, Thomas soon made his influence felt, and it was owing to  his suggestion (so it is said(136)) that the bishops had declined to be a  party to the coronation of Eustace during Stephen's lifetime.    On the accession of Henry, Thomas passed from the service of the  archbishop, then advanced in years, to the service of the young king. He  was raised to the dignity of chancellor, and became one of the king's most  trusted advisers. By their united efforts order was once again restored  throughout the kingdom. The great barons, who had established themselves  in castles erected without royal licence, were brought into subjection to  the crown and compelled to pull down their walls. Upon the death of the  archbishop, Thomas was appointed to the vacant See (1162). From that day  forward the friendship between king and archbishop began to wane. Henry  found that all his attempts to establish order in his kingdom were  thwarted by exemptions claimed by the archbishop on behalf of the clergy.  He found that allegiance to the Crown was divided with allegiance to the  Pope, and this state of things was likely to continue so long as the  archbishop lived. Becket's end is familiar to us all. His memory was long  cherished by the citizens of London, who made many a pilgrimage to the  scene of his martyrdom and left many an offering on his tomb in the  cathedral of Canterbury. It is hard to say for which of the two, the  father or the son, the citizens entertained the greater reverence. For  many years after his death it was the custom for the Mayor of the City for  the time being, upon entering into office, to meet the aldermen at the  church of St. Thomas of Acon--a church which had been erected and endowed  in honour of the murdered archbishop by his sister Agnes, wife of Thomas  Fitz-Theobald of Helles(137)--and thence to proceed to the tomb of Gilbert  Becket, the father, in St. Paul's churchyard, there to say a _De  profundis_; after which both mayor and aldermen returned to the church of  St. Thomas, and, each having made an offering of two pence, returned to  his own home.(138) St. Thomas's Hospital, in Southwark, was originally  dedicated to the murdered archbishop, but after its dissolution and  subsequent restoration as one of the Royal Hospitals, its patron saint was  no longer Thomas the Martyr, but Thomas the Apostle.    (M95)    Whilst the king and his chancellor were busy settling the kingdom,  establishing a uniform administration of justice and system of revenue,  and not only renewing but extending the form of government which had been  instituted by Henry I, the citizens of London, availing themselves of the  security afforded by a strong government, redoubled their energy in  following commercial pursuits and succeeded in raising the city, as  Fitz-Stephen has told us, to a pitch of prosperity far exceeding that of  any other city in the world.    They obtained a charter from Henry,(139) although of a more limited  character than that granted to them by his grandfather. The later charter,  for instance, although in the main lines following the older charter,  makes no mention of Middlesex being let to ferm nor of any appointment of  sheriff or justiciar being vested in the citizens. It appears as if Henry  was determined to bring the citizens no less than the barons of the realm  within more direct and immediate subservience to the crown. The concession  made by the king's grandfather had been ignored by Stephen and the empress  Matilda, each of whom in turn had granted the shrievalty of London and  Middlesex to the Earl of Essex. For a time the appointment of sheriffs was  lost to the citizens. Throughout the reigns of Henry II and his successor  they were appointed by the crown. Richard's charter to the citizens makes  no mention of the sheriffwick, nor is it mentioned in the first charter  granted by John. When it was restored to the citizens (A.D. 1199), by  John's second charter, the office of sheriff of London had lost much of  its importance owing to the introduction of the communal system of  municipal government under a mayor.    (M96)    In the meantime the sheriffs of the counties, who had by reason of Henry's  administrative reforms, risen to be officers of greater importance and  wider jurisdiction, and who had taken advantage of their positions to  oppress the people during the king's prolonged absence abroad, were also  made to feel the power of the crown. A blow struck at the sheriffs was  calculated to weaken the nobility and the larger landowners--the class from  which it had been the custom hitherto to select these officers. Henry saw  the advantage to be gained, and on his return to England in 1170 deposed  most of the sheriffs and ordered a strict enquiry to be made, as to the  extortions they had committed in his absence. Their places were filled for  the most part by men of lower rank, and therefore likely to be more  submissive. Some, however, were reinstated and became more cruel and  extortionate than ever.(140)    (M97)    The last fifteen years of Henry's life were full of domestic trouble. He  had always found it an easier matter to rule his kingdom than his  household. His sons were for ever thwarting his will and quarrelling with  each other. It was his desire to secure the succession to the crown for  his eldest son Henry, and to this end he had caused him to be crowned by  the Archbishop of York (14th June, 1170), who was thereupon declared  excommunicated by his brother of Canterbury. The son began to clamour for  his inheritance whilst his father still lived, and appealed in 1173 to the  French king, whose daughter he had married, to assist him in his unholy  enterprise. Whilst Henry was engaged in defending his crown against his  own son on the continent, the great barons of England rose in  insurrection, and the king was obliged to hasten home, where he arrived in  July, 1174. The rebellion was quickly put down, and the strife between  king and nobles for a time ceased.    (M98)    In the city there were occasional disturbances caused by the younger  nobility--the young bloods of the city(141)--who infested the streets at  night, broke into the houses of the rich and committed every kind of  excess. In 1177 the brother of the Earl of Ferrers was waylaid and killed,  and for some time the streets were unsafe at night. The chronicler records  a singular outrage perpetrated three years before, by these sprigs of  nobility. They forcibly entered the house of a wealthy citizen whose name  has not come down to us, he is simply styled the _pater-familias_. Of his  courage we are left in no doubt, for we are told that he slipt on a coat  of mail, armed his house-hold, and awaited the attack. He had not long to  wait. The leader of the band--one Andrew Bucquinte soon made his  appearance, and was met by a pan of hot coals. Swords were drawn on both  sides and _pater-familias_, whose coat of mail"]]]
