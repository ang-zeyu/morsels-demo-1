Unto God, unto one's self, unto one's  neighbor may violence be done; I mean unto them and unto their  belongings, as thou shalt hear in plain discourse. By violence  death and grievous wounds are inflicted on one's neighbor; and on  his substance ruins, burnings, and harmful robberies. Wherefore  homicides, and every one who smites wrongfully, devastators and  freebooters, all of them the first round torments, in various  troops.

This  latter mode seemeth to destroy only the bond of love that nature  makes; wherefore in the second circle[1] nestle hypocrisy,  flatteries, and sorcerers, falsity, robbery, and simony, panders,  barrators, and such like filth.

Hence, in the smallest circle, where is the centre of  the universe, on which Dis sits, whoso betrays is consumed  forever.\"    And I, \"Master, full clearly doth thy discourse proceed, and full  well divides this pit, and the people that possess it; but, tell  me, they of the fat marsh, and they whom the wind drives, and  they whom the rain beats, and they who encounter with such sharp  tongues, why are they not punished within the ruddy city if God  be wroth with them? and if he be not so, why are they in such  plight?\"    And he said to me, \"Wherefore so wanders thine understanding  beyond its wont? or thy mind, where else is it gazing? Dost thou  not remember those words with which thine Ethics treats in full  of the three dispositions that Heaven abides not; in continence,  malice, and mad bestiality, and how incontinence less offends  God, and incurs less blame? [1] If thou considerest well this  doctrine, and bringest to mind who are those that up above,  outside,[2] suffer punishment, thou wilt see clearly why from  these felons they are divided, and why less wroth the divine  vengeance hammers them.\"    [1] Aristotle, Ethics, vii. 1.

And if thou note thy  Physics [1] well thou wilt find after not many pages that your  art follows her so far as it can, as the disciple does the  master, so that your art is as it were grandchild of God. By  means of these two, if thou bringest to mind Genesis at its  beginning, it behoves mankind to obtain their livelihood and to  thrive. But because the usurer takes another course, he despises  Nature in herself, and in her follower, since upon other thing he  sets his hope.

First round of the Seventh Circle; those who do  violence to others; Tyrants and Homicides.--The Minotaur.--The  Centaurs.--Chiron.--Nessus.--The River of Boiling Blood, and the  Sinners in it.    The place where we came to descend the bank was rugged, and,  because of what was there besides, such that every eye would be  shy of it.    As is that ruin which, on this side of Trent, struck the Adige on  its flank, either by earthquake or by failure of support,--for  from the top of the mountain whence it moved, to the plain, the  cliff has so fallen down that it might give a path to one who was  above,--so was the descent of that ravine. And on the edge of the  broken chasm lay stretched out the infamy of Crete, that was  conceived in the false cow. And when he saw us he bit himself  even as one whom wrath rends inwardly. My Sage cried out toward  him, \"Perchance thou believest that here is the Duke of Athens  who up in the world brought death to thee? Get thee gone, beast,  for this one comes not instructed by thy sister, but he goes to  behold your punishments.\"    As a bull that breaks away at the instant he has now received his  mortal stroke, and cannot go, but plunges hither and thither, the  Minotaur I saw do the like.    And that wary one cried out, \"Run to the pass; while he is raging  it is well that thou descend.\" So we took our way down over the  discharge of those stones, which often moved under my feet  because of the novel burden.    I was going along thinking, and he said, \"Thou thinkest perhaps  on this ruin which is guarded by that bestial with which I just  now quenched. Now would I have thee know that the other time when  I descended hither into the nether hell, this cliff had not yet  fallen. But in truth, if I discern clearly, a little ere He came,  who levied the great spoil on Dis from the supernal circle, in  all its parts the deep foul valley trembled so that I thought the  universe had felt the love by which, as some believe, oft times  the world has been converted into chaos:[1] and, at that moment,  this ancient cliff here and elsewhere made this downfall. But fix  thine eyes below, for the river of blood is near, in which boils  whoso doth harm to others by violence.\"    [1] Empedocles taught, as Dante may have learned from Aristotle,  that Love and Hate were the forces by which the elements of which  the world is composed were united and dissociated. The effort of  Love was to draw all things into a simple perfect sphere, by  which the common order of the world would be brought to chaos.      Oh blind cupidity, both guilty and mad, that so spurs us in the  brief life, and then, in the eternal, steeps us so ill!    I saw a broad ditch, bent in an arc, like one that embraces all  the plain; according as my Guide had said. And between the foot  of the bank and it, in a file were running Centaurs armed with  arrows, as they were wont in the world to go to the chase. Seeing  us descending, all stopped, and from the troop three detached  themselves, with bows and arrows first selected. And one shouted  from afar, \"To what torment are ye coming, ye who descend the  slope? Tell it from there; if not, I draw the bow.\" My Master  said, \"We will make answer unto Chiron near you there: ill was it  that thy will was ever thus hasty.\"    Then he touched me, and said, \"That is Nessus, who died for the  beautiful Dejanira, and he himself wrought vengeance for himself;  and that one in the middle, who is gazing on his breast, is the  great Chiron who nurtured Achilles. That other is Pholus, who was  so full of wrath. Round about the ditch they go by thousands  shooting with their arrows what soul lifts itself from the blood  more than its guilt has allotted it.\"    We drew near to those fleet wild beasts. Chiron took a shaft, and  with the notch put his beard backward upon his jaw. When he had  uncovered his great mouth he said to his companions, \"Are ye  aware that the one behind moves what he touches? so are not wont  to do the feet of the dead.\" And my good Leader, who was now at  his breast, where the two natures are conjoined, replied, \"Truly  he is alive, and thus all alone it behoves me to show him the  dark valley: necessity brings him hither and not delight. One  withdrew from singing alleluiah who committed unto me this new  office; he is no robber, nor I a thievish spirit. But, by that  power through which I move my steps along so savage a road, give  to us one of thine, to whom we may be close, that he may show us  where the ford is, and may carry this one on his back, for he is  not a spirit who can go through the air.\"    Chiron turned upon his right breast, and said to Nessus, \"Turn,  and guide them thus, and if another troop encounter you, make it  give way.\"    We moved on with the trusty escort along the edge of the crimson  boiling, in which the boiled were making loud shrieks. I saw folk  under it up to the brow, and the great Centaur said, \"These are  tyrants who gave themselves to blood and pillage. Here they weep  their pitiless offenses: here is Alexander, and cruel Dionysius  who caused Sicily to have woeful years. And that front which hath  such black hair is Azzolino, and that other who is blond is  Opizzo of Esti, who in truth was slain by his stepson up there in  the world.\"    Then I turned me to the Poet, and he said, \"Let him now be  first, and I second.\" A little further on the Centaur stopped  above some folk who far as the throat were seen to issue from  that boiling stream. He showed to us at one side a solitary  shade, and said, \"He cleft, in the bosom of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19950"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part III (Tertia Pars) (#10)"],[1,"of copulation. Therefore it seems that  union is the same as assumption.    _On the contrary,_ The Divine Nature is said to be united, not  assumed.    _I answer that,_ As was stated above (A. 7), union implies a certain  relation of the Divine Nature and the human, according as they come  together in one Person. Now all relations which begin in time are  brought about by some change; and change consists in action and  passion. Hence the _first_ and principal difference between  assumption and union must be said to be that union implies the  relation: whereas assumption implies the action, whereby someone is  said to assume, or the passion, whereby something is said to be  assumed. Now from this difference another _second_ difference arises,  for assumption implies _becoming,_ whereas union implies _having  become,_ and therefore the thing uniting is said to be united, but  the thing assuming is not said to be assumed. For the human nature is  taken to be in the terminus of assumption unto the Divine hypostasis  when man is spoken of; and hence we can truly say that the Son of  God, Who assumes human nature unto Himself, is man. But human nature,  considered in itself, i.e. in the abstract, is viewed as assumed; and  we do not say the Son of God is human nature. From this same follows  a _third_ difference, which is that a relation, especially one of  equiparance, is no more to one extreme than to the other, whereas  action and passion bear themselves differently to the agent and the  patient, and to different termini. And hence assumption determines  the term whence and the term whither; for assumption means a taking  to oneself from another. But union determines none of these things.  Hence it may be said indifferently that the human nature is united  with the Divine, or conversely. But the Divine Nature is not said to  be assumed by the human, but conversely, because the human nature is  joined to the Divine personality, so that the Divine Person subsists  in human nature.    Reply Obj. 1: Union and assumption have not the same relation to the  term, but a different relation, as was said above.    Reply Obj. 2: What unites and what assumes are not the same. For  whatsoever Person assumes unites, and not conversely. For the Person  of the Father united the human nature to the Son, but not to Himself;  and hence He is said to unite and not to assume. So likewise the  united and the assumed are not identical, for the Divine Nature is  said to be united, but not assumed.    Reply Obj. 3: Assumption determines with whom the union is made on  the part of the one assuming, inasmuch as assumption means taking  unto oneself (_ad se sumere_), whereas incarnation and humanation  (determine with whom the union is made) on the part of the thing  assumed, which is flesh or human nature. And thus assumption differs  logically both from union and from incarnation or humanation.  _______________________    NINTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 2, Art. 9]    Whether the Union of the Two Natures in Christ Is the Greatest of All  Unions?    Objection 1: It would seem that the union of the two natures in  Christ is not the greatest of all unions. For what is united falls  short of the unity of what is one, since what is united is by  participation, but one is by essence. Now in created things there are  some that are simply one, as is shown especially in unity itself,  which is the principle of number. Therefore the union of which we are  speaking does not imply the greatest of all unions.    Obj. 2: Further, the greater the distance between things united, the  less the union. Now, the things united by this union are most  distant--namely, the Divine and human natures; for they are  infinitely apart. Therefore their union is the least of all.    Obj. 3: Further, from union there results one. But from the union of  soul and body in us there arises what is one in person and nature;  whereas from the union of the Divine and human nature there results  what is one in person only. Therefore the union of soul and body is  greater than that of the Divine and human natures; and hence the  union of which we speak does not imply the greatest unity.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Trin. i, 10) that \"man is in  the Son of God, more than the Son in the Father.\" But the Son is in  the Father by unity of essence, and man is in the Son by the union of  the Incarnation. Therefore the union of the Incarnation is greater  than the unity of the Divine Essence, which nevertheless is the  greatest union; and thus the union of the Incarnation implies the  greatest unity.    _I answer that,_ Union implies the joining of several in some one  thing. Therefore the union of the Incarnation may be taken in two  ways: first, in regard to the things united; secondly, in regard to  that in which they are united. And in this regard this union has a  pre-eminence over other unions; for the unity of the Divine Person,  in which the two natures are united, is the greatest. But it has no  pre-eminence in regard to the things united.    Reply Obj. 1: The unity of the Divine Person is greater than  numerical unity, which is the principle of number. For the unity of a  Divine Person is an uncreated and self-subsisting unity, not received  into another by participation. Also, it is complete in itself, having  in itself whatever pertains to the nature of unity; and therefore it  is not compatible with the nature of a part, as in numerical unity,  which is a part of number, and which is shared in by the things  numbered. And hence in this respect the union of the Incarnation is  higher than numerical unity by reason of the unity of the Divine  Person, and not by reason of the human nature, which is not the unity  of the Divine Person, but is united to it.    Reply Obj. 2: This reason regards the things united, and not the  Person in Whom the union takes place.    Reply Obj. 3: The unity of the Divine Person is greater than the  unity of person and nature in us; and hence the union of the  Incarnation is greater than the union of soul and body in us.    And because what is urged in the argument \"on the contrary\" rests  upon what is untrue--namely, that the union of the Incarnation is  greater than the unity of the Divine Persons in Essence--we must say  to the authority of Augustine that the human nature is not more in  the Son of God than the Son of God in the Father, but much less. But  the man in some respects is more in the Son than the Son in the  Father--namely, inasmuch as the same suppositum is signified when I  say \"man,\" meaning Christ, and when I say \"Son of God\"; whereas it is  not the same suppositum of Father and Son.  _______________________    TENTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 2, Art. 10]    Whether the Union of the Incarnation Took Place by Grace?    Objection 1: It would seem that the union of the Incarnation did not  take place by grace. For grace is an accident, as was shown above  (I-II, Q. 110, A. 2). But the union of the human nature to the Divine  did not take place accidentally, as was shown above (A. 6). Therefore  it seems that the union of the Incarnation did not take place by  grace.    Obj. 2: Further, the subject of grace is the soul. But it is written  (Col. 2:9): \"In Christ [Vulg.: 'Him'] dwelleth all the fulness of the  Godhead corporeally.\" Therefore it seems that this union did not take  place by grace.    Obj. 3: Further, every saint is united to God by grace. If,  therefore, the union of the Incarnation was by grace, it would seem  that Christ is said to be God no more than other holy men.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Praed. Sanct. xv): \"By the same  grace every man is made a Christian, from the beginning of his faith,  as this man from His beginning was made Christ.\" But this man became  Christ by union with the Divine Nature. Therefore this union was by  grace.    _I answer that,_ As was said above (I-II, Q. 110, A. 1), grace is  taken in two ways:--first, as the will of God gratuitously bestowing  something; secondly, as the free gift of God. Now human nature stands  in need of the gratuitous will of God in order to be lifted up to  God, since this is above its natural capability. Moreover, human  nature is lifted up to God in two ways: first, by operation, as the  saints know and love God; secondly, by personal being, and this mode  belongs exclusively to Christ, in Whom human nature is assumed so as  to be in the Person of the Son of God. But it is plain that for the  perfection of operation the power needs to be perfected by a habit,  whereas that a nature has being in its own suppositum does not take  place by means of a habit.    And hence we must say that if grace be understood as the will of God  gratuitously doing something or reputing anything as well-pleasing or  acceptable to Him, the union of the Incarnation took place by grace,  even as the union of the saints with God by knowledge and love. But  if grace be taken as the free gift of God, then the fact that the  human nature is united to the Divine Person may be called a grace,  inasmuch as it took place without being preceded by any merits--but  not as though there were an habitual grace, by means of which the  union took place.    Reply Obj. 1: The grace which is an accident is a certain likeness of  the Divinity participated by man. But by the Incarnation human nature  is not said to have participated a likeness of the Divine nature, but  is said to be united to the Divine Nature itself in the Person of the  Son. Now the thing itself is greater than a participated likeness of  it.    Reply Obj. 2: Habitual grace is only in the soul; but the grace, i.e.  the free gift of God, of being united to the Divine Person belongs to  the whole human nature, which is composed of soul and body. And hence  it is said that the fulness of the Godhead dwelt corporeally in  Christ because the Divine Nature is united not merely to the soul,  but to the body also. Although it may also "]]]
