Certainly no singer can be called a great artist unless his diction is  good, for a beautiful voice alone will not make up for other  deficiencies. A singer endowed with a small voice or even one of not  very pleasing quality can give more pleasure than a singer possessing a  big, impressive voice, but no diction.    Some people claim that a pronunciation too distinct or too much insisted  upon spoils the real voice quality, but this should not be the case if  the words are correctly and naturally brought out. Doubtless, this  impression has come from the fact that, particularly in France, many  singers possessed of small voices must exaggerate their diction to  obtain their effects. But if they did not have this perfect diction they  often would have little else to recommend them. I would aver that a fine  enunciation, far from interfering with it, aids the voice production,  makes it softer and more concentrated, but diction should act rather as  a frame for the voice and never replace it.    Each of the three languages, French, German and Italian, has its  peculiar characteristics, which are of aid to the student in the general  study of pronunciation, and it is well to have a knowledge of them all  outside of the fact that an artist nowadays needs to have this knowledge  in order not only to rank with the greatest, but to cope with the  demands of an operatic career.    The Italian language in its very essence is rich in vowels and vowel  combinations, from which comes principally the color in tones, and it  has consequently been called the \"language of song.\" Italians thus have  naturally what it is so much trouble for singers of other nations to  acquire--the numerous variations of vowel sounds.    French has the nasal sounds as its dominating characteristic and is very  valuable in the cultivation of \"nasal resonance.\"    As I said before, it is so easy to exaggerate and the voice is so apt to  get too much \"in the nose\" that one has to be extremely careful in the  use of the French \"n\" and \"ng.\"    German is so full of consonants that one needs to have exceptional  control of the tongue and lips to give their proper value.    English possesses the features of all the other languages--of course, in  less marked degree--resembling most, perhaps, the German. The \"th\" is  the most difficult sound to make effective in singing.    I have already spoken of the various phases of nervousness which an  artist feels before the performance, but I wish to say here a word in  regard to the practical significance of such nervousness. Artists who do  not experience it are those who lack real genius. There are really two  kinds of fear--that arising from a realization of the importance of what  is to be done, the other from a lack of confidence in one's power. If a  singer has no conscience in his performance he is never nervous, but  full of assurance.    It is seldom that true artists are much troubled with nervousness after  going upon the stage. Generally, as I have before mentioned, they are  apt to be ill during the day of the performance, but before the public  they forget everything and are dominated only by the real love of their  art and sustained by the knowledge of possessing a proper \"method.\"    It is certain with a good breath support even nervousness need not  prevent one from singing well, although one may be actually suffering  from trepidation. Yet we know that sometimes the greatest of artists are  prevented thus from doing their best work. The principle, however,  remains unshaken that singing in a correct way is the greatest possible  \"bracer.\"    It is best to remain absolutely quiet and see no one on the day of the  performance, so as not to be enervated by the effort of talking much, to  say nothing of tiring the vocal chords. One prima donna of my  acquaintance occupies herself in trimming hats on the day when she  sings, believing that this provides a distraction and rests her nerves.  It is just as well not to \"pass through\" the role that is to be sung on  the day of the appearing, but in the morning a few technical exercises  to keep the voice in tune, as it were, are to be recommended. The great  Italian singers of other days followed this rule, and it still holds  good.    If the singer gives much of himself as well as of his voice to the  public he should still hold his breathing supply in, so to speak, as he  would guard the capital from which comes his income. Failure should thus  be impossible if there is always a reserve to draw on. So the more one  sings with good breath support the more beautiful the voice becomes. On  the other hand, those who sing haphazard sometimes begin the evening  well, but deteriorate more and more as the performance advances and at  the end are uttering mere raucous sounds. They are like a man unable to  swim who is in a deep river--their voices control them in place of they  controlling their voices. They struggle vainly against obstacles, but  are carried away by the flood and are finally engulfed in the waters.    Many too ambitious students are their own worst enemies in the culture  of their voices. Because they have a large vocal power they want to  shout all the time in spite of the repeated admonitions of their  masters, who beg them to sing piano. But they hear nothing except the  noise they make themselves. Such headstrong ones will never make a  career, even with the finest voices in the world. Their teachers should  give up trying to make them listen to reason and devote their attention  to those who merit it and want to study seriously. Singing as an art is  usually not considered with enough earnestness. One should go to a  singing master as one goes to a specialist for a consultation and follow  with the greatest care his directions. If one does not have the same  respect and confidence one places in a physician it must be because the  singing master does not really merit it, and it would be much better to  make a change at once.    In general it is better not to stick entirely to one teacher, for it is  easy to get into a rut in this way, and someone else may have a quite  different and more enlightening way of setting forth his ideas.    In taking up operatic work it is understood, of course, that the singer  must have mastered most of the technical difficulties, so as not to be  troubled with them when they are encountered in some aria.    It is a most excellent thing to secure an engagement in one of the small  theatres abroad, where one may get a large experience before trying to  effect an entrance into the bigger organizations of the great capitals.    But be sure that the voice is well placed before trying any of this sort  of work, and never attempt to sing a role above your powers in the  earlier stage of your career, which otherwise may be compromised  permanently.    One more bit of advice in closing. The best sort of lesson possible is  to go often to the opera and note well the methods of the great artists.  This personal example is worth more and is more illuminating than many  precepts.    This is not so much that any form of imitation may be attempted as to  teach the would-be artist how to present at his best all those telling  qualities with which he may be endowed. It is the best of schools.          Pet Superstitions of Great Singers      The most visible phase of the opera singer's life when he or she is in  view of the public on the stage is naturally the one most intimately  connected in the minds of the majority of people with the singer's  personality, and yet there are many happenings, amusing or tragic, from  the artist's point of view, which, though often seen, are as often not  realized in their true significance by the audience in front of the  orchestra. One might naturally think that a singer who has been  appearing for years on the operatic stage in many lands would have  overcome or outgrown that bane of all public performers, stage fright.  Yet such is far from the case, for it seems as though the greater the  artistic temperament the more truly the artist feels and the more of  himself he puts into the music he sings the greater his nervousness  beforehand. The latter is of course augmented if the performance is a  first night and the opera has as yet been untried before a larger  public.    This advance state of miserable physical tension is the portion of all  great singers alike, though in somewhat varying degrees, and it is  interesting to note the forms it assumes with different people. In many  it is shown by excessive irritability and the disposal to pick quarrels  with anyone who comes in contact with them. This is an unhappy time for  the luckless \"dressers,\" wig man and stage hands, or even fellow artists  who encounter such singers before their first appearance in the evening.  Trouble is the portion of all such.    In other artists the state of mind is indicated by a stern set  countenance and a ghastly pallor, while still others become slightly  hysterical, laugh uproariously at nothing or burst into weeping. I have  seen a big six-foot bass singer, very popular at the opera two or three  seasons ago, walking to and fro with the tears running down his cheeks  for a long time before his entrance, and one of our greatest coloratura  prima donnas has come to me before the opera, sung a quavering note in a  voice full of emotion and said, with touching accents: \"See, that is the  best I can do. How can I go on so?\"    I myself have been affected often by such fright, though not always in  the extreme degree above described. This nervousness, however,  frequently shows itself in one's performance in the guise of indifferent  acting, singing off the key, etc. Artists are generally blamed for such  shortcomings, apparent in the early part of the production, when, as a  matter of fact, they themselves are hardly conscious of them and  overcome them in the course of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/201"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Illustrated) (#10)"],[1,"step forward and address them.  But he found himself encompassed with guards and forced to remain  silent while the Chief Circle in a few impassioned words made a final  appeal to the Women, exclaiming that, if the Colour Bill passed, no  marriage would henceforth be safe, no woman's honour secure; fraud,  deception, hypocrisy would pervade every household; domestic bliss  would share the fate of the Constitution and pass to speedy perdition.  \"Sooner than this,\" he cried, \"Come death.\"    At these words, which were the preconcerted signal for action, the  Isosceles Convicts fell on and transfixed the wretched Chromatistes;  the Regular Classes, opening their ranks, made way for a band of Women  who, under direction of the Circles, moved, back foremost, invisibly  and unerringly upon the unconscious soldiers; the Artisans, imitating  the example of their betters, also opened their ranks.  Meantime bands  of Convicts occupied every entrance with an impenetrable phalanx.    The battle, or rather carnage, was of short duration.  Under the  skillful generalship of the Circles almost every Woman's charge was  fatal and very many extracted their sting uninjured, ready for a second  slaughter.  But no second blow was needed; the rabble of the Isosceles  did the rest of the business for themselves.  Surprised, leader-less,  attacked in front by invisible foes, and finding egress cut off by the  Convicts behind them, they at once--after their manner--lost all  presence of mind, and raised the cry of \"treachery\".  This sealed their  fate.  Every Isosceles now saw and felt a foe in every other.  In half  an hour not one of that vast multitude was living; and the fragments of  seven score thousand of the Criminal Class slain by one another's  angles attested the triumph of Order.    The Circles delayed not to push their victory to the uttermost.  The  Working Men they spared but decimated.  The Militia of the Equilaterals  was at once called out; and every Triangle suspected of Irregularity on  reasonable grounds, was destroyed by Court Martial, without the  formality of exact measurement by the Social Board.  The homes of the  Military and Artisan classes were inspected in a course of visitations  extending through upwards of a year; and during that period every town,  village, and hamlet was systematically purged of that excess of the  lower orders which had been brought about by the neglect to pay the  tribute of Criminals to the Schools and University, and by the  violation of the other natural Laws of the Constitution of Flatland.  Thus the balance of classes was again restored.    Needless to say that henceforth the use of Colour was abolished, and  its possession prohibited.  Even the utterance of any word denoting  Colour, except by the Circles or by qualified scientific teachers, was  punished by a severe penalty.  Only at our University in some of the  very highest and most esoteric classes--which I myself have never been  privileged to attend--it is understood that the sparing use of Colour  is still sanctioned for the purpose of illustrating some of the deeper  problems of mathematics.  But of this I can only speak from hearsay.    Elsewhere in Flatland, Colour is now non-existent.  The art of making  it is known to only one living person, the Chief Circle for the time  being; and by him it is handed down on his death-bed to none but his  Successor.  One manufactory alone produces it; and, lest the secret  should be betrayed, the Workmen are annually consumed, and fresh ones  introduced.  So great is the terror with which even now our Aristocracy  looks back to the far-distant days of the agitation for the Universal  Colour Bill.          Section 11.  Concerning our Priests        It is high time that I should pass from these brief and discursive  notes about things in Flatland to the central event of this book, my  initiation into the mysteries of Space.  THAT is my subject; all that  has gone before is merely preface.    For this reason I must omit many matters of which the explanation would  not, I flatter myself, be without interest for my Readers: as for  example, our method of propelling and stopping ourselves, although  destitute of feet; the means by which we give fixity to structures of  wood, stone, or brick, although of course we have no hands, nor can we  lay foundations as you can, nor avail ourselves of the lateral pressure  of the earth; the manner in which the rain originates in the intervals  between our various zones, so that the northern regions do not  intercept the moisture from falling on the southern; the nature of our  hills and mines, our trees and vegetables, our seasons and harvests;  our Alphabet and method of writing, adapted to our linear tablets;  these and a hundred other details of our physical existence I must pass  over, nor do I mention them now except to indicate to my readers that  their omission proceeds not from forgetfulness on the part of the  author, but from his regard for the time of the Reader.    Yet before I proceed to my legitimate subject some few final remarks  will no doubt be expected by my Readers upon those pillars and  mainstays of the Constitution of Flatland, the controllers of our  conduct and shapers of our destiny, the objects of universal homage and  almost of adoration: need I say that I mean our Circles or Priests?    When I call them Priests, let me not be understood as meaning no more  than the term denotes with you.  With us, our Priests are  Administrators of all Business, Art, and Science; Directors of Trade,  Commerce, Generalship, Architecture, Engineering, Education,  Statesmanship, Legislature, Morality, Theology; doing nothing  themselves, they are the Causes of everything worth doing, that is done  by others.    Although popularly everyone called a Circle is deemed a Circle, yet  among the better educated Classes it is known that no Circle is really  a Circle, but only a Polygon with a very large number of very small  sides.  As the number of the sides increases, a Polygon approximates to  a Circle; and, when the number is very great indeed, say for example  three or four hundred, it is extremely difficult for the most delicate  touch to feel any polygonal angles.  Let me say rather, it WOULD be  difficult: for, as I have shown above, Recognition by Feeling is  unknown among the highest society, and to FEEL a Circle would be  considered a most audacious insult.  This habit of abstention from  Feeling in the best society enables a Circle the more easily to sustain  the veil of mystery in which, from his earliest years, he is wont to  enwrap the exact nature of his Perimeter or Circumference.  Three feet  being the average Perimeter it follows that, in a Polygon of three  hundred sides each side will be no more than the hundredth part of a  foot in length, or little more than the tenth part of an inch; and in a  Polygon of six or seven hundred sides the sides are little larger than  the diameter of a Spaceland pin-head.  It is always assumed, by  courtesy, that the Chief Circle for the time being has ten thousand  sides.    The ascent of the posterity of the Circles in the social scale is not  restricted, as it is among the lower Regular classes, by the Law of  Nature which limits the increase of sides to one in each generation.  If it were so, the number of sides in a Circle would be a mere question  of pedigree and arithmetic, and the four hundred and ninety-seventh  descendant of an Equilateral Triangle would necessarily be a Polygon  with five hundred sides.  But this is not the case.  Nature's Law  prescribes two antagonistic decrees affecting Circular propagation;  first, that as the race climbs higher in the scale of development, so  development shall proceed at an accelerated pace; second, that in the  same proportion, the race shall become less fertile.  Consequently in  the home of a Polygon of four or five hundred sides it is rare to find  a son; more than one is never seen.  On the other hand the son of a  five-hundred-sided Polygon has been known to possess five hundred and  fifty, or even six hundred sides.    Art also steps in to help the process of the higher Evolution.  Our  physicians have discovered that the small and tender sides of an infant  Polygon of the higher class can be fractured, and his whole frame  re-set, with such exactness that a Polygon of two or three hundred  sides sometimes--by no means always, for the process is attended with  serious risk--but sometimes overleaps two or three hundred generations,  and as it were doubles at a stroke, the number of his progenitors and  the nobility of his descent.    Many a promising child is sacrificed in this way.  Scarcely one out of  ten survives.  Yet so strong is the parental ambition among those  Polygons who are, as it were, on the fringe of the Circular class, that  it is very rare to find a Nobleman of that position in society, who has  neglected to place his first-born in the Circular Neo-Therapeutic  Gymnasium before he has attained the age of a month.    One year determines success or failure.  At the end of that time the  child has, in all probability, added one more to the tombstones that  crowd the Neo-Therapeutic Cemetery; but on rare occasions a glad  procession bears back the little one to his exultant parents, no longer  a Polygon, but a Circle, at least by courtesy: and a single instance of  so blessed a result induces multitudes of Polygonal parents to submit  to similar domestic sacrifices, which have a dissimilar issue.          Section 12.  Of the Doctrine of our Priests        As to the doctrine of the Circles it may briefly be summed up in a  single maxim, \"Attend to your Configuration.\"  Whether political,  ecclesiastical, or moral, all their teaching has for its object the  improvement of individual and collective Configuration--with special  reference of course to the Configuration of the Circles, to which all  other objects are"]]]
