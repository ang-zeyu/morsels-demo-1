Both movements were symptomatic of the determination of a  strong-willed and egoistic race, suddenly liberated from secular  oppression, to enjoy to the full the moral and material privileges of  liberty. In the assembly at Trnovo the popular party had adopted the  watchword \"Bulgaria for the Bulgarians,\" and a considerable anti-Russian  contingent was included in its ranks. Young and inexperienced, Prince  Alexander, at the suggestion of the Russian consul-general, selected his  first ministry from a small group of \"Conservative\" politicians whose views  were in conflict with those of the parliamentary majority, but he was soon  compelled to form a \"Liberal\" administration under Tzankoff and Karaveloff.  The Liberals, once in power, initiated a violent campaign against  foreigners in general and the Russians in particular; they passed an alien  law, and ejected foreigners from every lucrative position. The Russians  made a vigorous resistance, and a state of chaos ensued. Eventually the  prince, finding good government impossible, obtained the consent of the  tsar to a change of the constitution, and assumed absolute authority on the  9th of May 1881. The Russian general Ernroth was appointed sole minister,  and charged with the duty of holding elections for the Grand Sobranye, to  which the right of revising the constitution appertained. So successfully  did he discharge his mission that the national representatives, almost  without debate, suspended the constitution and invested the prince with  absolute powers for a term of seven years (July 1881). A period of Russian  government followed under Generals Skobelev and Kaulbars, who were  specially despatched from St Petersburg to enhance the authority of the  prince. Their administration, however, tended to a contrary result, and the  prince, finding himself reduced to impotence, opened negotiations with the  Bulgarian leaders and effected a coalition of all parties on the basis of a  restoration of the constitution. The generals, who had made an unsuccessful  attempt to remove the prince, withdrew; the constitution of Trnovo was  restored by proclamation (19th September 1883), and a coalition ministry  was formed under Tzankoff. Prince Alexander, whose relations with the court  of St Petersburg had become less cordial since the death of his uncle, the  tsar Alexander II., in 1881, now incurred the serious displeasure of  Russia, and the breach was soon widened by the part which he played in  encouraging the national aspirations of the Bulgarians.    _Union with Eastern Rumelia._--In Eastern Rumelia, where the Bulgarian  population never ceased to protest against the division of the race,  political life had developed on the same lines as in the principality.  Among the politicians two parties had come into existence--the  Conservatives or self-styled \"Unionists,\" and the Radicals, derisively  called by their opponents [v.04 p.0783] \"Kazioni\" or treasury-seekers; both  were equally desirous of bringing about the union with the principality.  Neither party, however, while in power would risk the sweets of office by  embarking in a hazardous adventure. It was reserved for the Kazioni, under  their famous leader Zakharia Stoyanoff, who in early life had been a  shepherd, to realize the national programme. In 1885 the Unionists were in  office, and their opponents lost no time in organizing a conspiracy for the  overthrow of the governor-general, Krstovitch Pasha. Their designs were  facilitated by the circumstance that Turkey had abstained from sending  troops into the province. Having previously assured themselves of Prince  Alexander's acquiescence, they seized the governor-general and proclaimed  the union with Bulgaria (18th September). The revolution took place without  bloodshed, and a few days later Prince Alexander entered Philippopolis amid  immense enthusiasm. His position now became precarious. The powers were  scandalized at the infraction of the Berlin Treaty; Great Britain alone  showed sympathy, while Russia denounced the union and urged the Porte to  reconquer the revolted province--both powers thus reversing their  respective attitudes at the congress of Berlin.    _War with Servia._--The Turkish troops were massed at the frontier, and  Servia, hoping to profit by the difficulties of her neighbour, suddenly  declared war (14th November). At the moment of danger the Russian officers,  who filled all the higher posts in the Bulgarian army, were withdrawn by  order of the tsar. In these critical circumstances Prince Alexander  displayed considerable ability and resource, and the nation gave evidence  of hitherto unsuspected qualities. Contrary to general expectation, the  Bulgarian army, imperfectly equipped and led by subaltern officers,  successfully resisted the Servian invasion. After brilliant victories at  Slivnitza (19th November) and Tsaribrod, Prince Alexander crossed the  frontier and captured Pirot (27th November), but his farther progress was  arrested by the intervention of Austria (see SERVO-BULGARIAN WAR). The  treaty of Bucharest followed (3rd of March 1886), declaring, in a single  clause, the restoration of peace. Servia, notwithstanding her aggression,  escaped a war indemnity, but the union with Eastern Rumelia was practically  secured. By the convention of Top-Khane (5th April) Prince Alexander was  recognized by the sultan as governor-general of eastern Rumelia; a personal  union only was sanctioned, but in effect the organic statute disappeared  and the countries were administratively united. These military and  diplomatic successes, which invested the prince with the attributes of a  national hero, quickened the decision of Russia to effect his removal. An  instrument was found in the discontent of several of his officers, who  considered themselves slighted in the distribution of rewards, and a  conspiracy was formed in which Tzankoff, Karaveloff (the prime minister),  Archbishop Clement, and other prominent persons were implicated. On the  night of the 21st of August the prince was seized in his palace by several  officers and compelled, under menace of death, to sign his abdication; he  was then hurried to the Danube at Rakhovo and transported to Russian soil  at Reni. This violent act met with instant disapproval on the part of the  great majority of the nation. Stamboloff, the president of the assembly,  and Colonel Mutkuroff, commandant of the troops at Philippopolis, initiated  a counter-revolution; the provisional government set up by the conspirators  immediately fell, and a few days later the prince, who had been liberated  by the Russian authorities, returned to the country amid every  demonstration of popular sympathy and affection. His arrival forestalled  that of a Russian imperial commissioner, who had been appointed to proceed  to Bulgaria. He now committed the error of addressing a telegram to the  tsar in which he offered to resign his crown into the hands of Russia. This  unfortunate step, by which he ignored the suzerainty of Turkey, and  represented Bulgaria as a Russian dependency, exposed him to a stern  rebuff, and fatally compromised his position. The national leaders, after  obtaining a promise from the Russian representative at Sofia that Russia  would abstain from interference in the internal affairs of the country,  consented to his departure; on the 8th of September he announced his  abdication, and on the following day he left Bulgaria.    _The Regency._--A regency was now formed, in which the prominent figure was  Stamboloff, the most remarkable man whom modern Bulgaria has produced. A  series of attempts to throw the country into anarchy were firmly dealt  with, and the Grand Sobranye was summoned to elect a new prince. The  candidature of the prince of Mingrelia was now set up by Russia, and  General Kaulbars was despatched to Bulgaria to make known to the people the  wishes of the tsar. He vainly endeavoured to postpone the convocation of  the Grand Sobranye in order to gain time for the restoration of Russian  influence, and proceeded on an electoral tour through the country. The  failure of his mission was followed by the withdrawal of the Russian  representatives from Bulgaria. The Grand Sobranye, which assembled at  Trnovo, offered the crown to Prince Valdemar of Denmark, brother-in-law of  the tsar, but the honour was declined, and an anxious period ensued, during  which a deputation visited the principal capitals of Europe with the  twofold object of winning sympathy for the cause of Bulgarian independence  and discovering a suitable candidate for the throne.    _Prince Ferdinand._--On the 7th of July 1887, the Grand Sobranye  unanimously elected Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, a grandson,  maternally, of King Louis Philippe. The new prince, who was twenty-six  years of age, was at this time a lieutenant in the Austrian army.  Undeterred by the difficulties of the international situation and the  distracted condition of the country, he accepted the crown, and took over  the government on the 14th of August at Trnovo. His arrival, which was  welcomed with enthusiasm, put an end to a long and critical interregnum,  but the dangers which menaced Bulgarian independence were far from  disappearing. Russia declared the newly-elected sovereign a usurper; the  other powers, in deference to her susceptibilities, declined to recognize  him, and the grand vizier informed him that his presence in Bulgaria was  illegal. Numerous efforts were made by the partisans of Russia to disturb  internal tranquillity, and Stamboloff, who became prime minister on the 1st  of September, found it necessary to govern with a strong hand. A raid led  by the Russian captain Nabokov was repulsed; brigandage, maintained for  political purposes, was exterminated; the bishops of the Holy Synod, who,  at the instigation of Clement, refused to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19850"],[0,"The Human Side of Animals (#10)"],[1,"it backwards,  and usually leaves the enemy literally covered, like a living  pin-cushion, with his spines. These animals have convex skulls, short  tails, and live chiefly in the warmer regions of the Old World. Those of  America are different in one particular--the soles of their feet are  covered with hard, bone-like tubercles, instead of being soft and  smooth; there are also a number of hairs that are intermingled with the  spines. The Canada porcupine has more hairs than the American, and a  shorter and stumpier tail.    Another animal whose methods of defence are by means of his spines, is  the hedgehog. His spines do not terminate in sharp points, like those of  the porcupine, but end in tiny knobs. These are placed beneath the skin,  and are like pins stuck through a cushion. The hedgehog, like the  porcupine, rolls himself into a ball when attacked by enemies, and he  has the additional ability of throwing himself down a hillside, like a  rolling ball, and thus escaping his enemies without injury to himself.  It would seem that the hedgehog, rolled into a ball and covered with  prickles, would be protected from all enemies. But this is not true, for  the clever fox knows just how to make him unroll. This one secret of the  hedgehog's weakness very often causes his loss of life. His weakness is  a terror of being wet or dropped into water; and when the fox finds him  all rolled up, he carefully rolls him into a pond of water and, when he  unrolls, quickly drowns him. Notwithstanding the shortness of the  hedgehog's spines, he is the most highly specialised of all  spine-bearing animals. In the lower order of animals there are spiny  mice and spiny rats, and even the horned toad uses his horns as a means  of protection against his enemies.    One of the most peculiarly armoured animals is the horned lizard,  commonly known as the \"horned toad\" of America. His body is covered with  small spiny scales, while the chisel-shaped head has a circlet of  miniature horns. These he uses when attacked by enemies to shield  himself against bites and knocks. The Indians claim that if a snake  swallows the horned lizard whole, the lizard will immediately work his  way through the snake. This would not be without a parallel, however,  for it is generally known that box-fishes, when swallowed by sharks,  bite their way out!    Nature has been especially kind to horned lizards, and that is the  reason there are so many of them. They well know the secret of the Gyges  ring, and can put on the garment of invisibility in a very short time.  They especially frequent the desert regions of the South and West; and  those that dwell in black sandy regions are black; those of red clay  regions are red; those of grey regions, grey; those from the variously  coloured regions of blue and red are precisely the colour of the earth.  But not satisfied with all their protections of armour and camouflage,  they actually, when hard-pressed by an enemy, feign death, like an  opossum! And if the enemy persists in his attack, and Mr. Lizard cannot  escape, as a final effort he spurts tears of blood from his eyes. The  Mexicans call him the \"sacred toad.\" The phenomenon of blood-shooting  has been explained in various ways, all of which seem equally  unsatisfactory. So far it is one of Nature's secrets. Perhaps some day  we may understand it.    The tortoises are among the best examples of creatures which to-day  protect themselves with armour. They are, of course, reptiles, yet in  the general formation of their armour, they are strikingly like  armadillos. The tortoise has his armour so arranged over his body that  it forms one big box. He draws his head and limbs into this whenever  danger is near. In Texas recently I found a small land terrapin, and as  soon as I came near, he closed his house. I picked him up, and then  carefully laid him upside down on the ground, and stepped behind some  nearby bushes to see what he would do. Immediately he poked his head  out, and then his feet, and then he began to wave his feet wildly in  air, and finally threw himself in the right position and hastened away  through the grass.    The turtle protects himself in the same way, and draws his head, feet,  and tail under his own house-roof where nothing can get him.    Lobsters and crabs are excellent types of armour-bearing animals.  Lobsters wear marvellous coats of mail, very similar to those worn by  human warriors during the age of chivalry. Their jointed structure  assures them perfect ease and security. Crabs, however, believe, as the  tortoise, in the strong-box protection. When resting, crabs tuck their  legs beneath them, so as to shelter themselves under the hard covering.  Upon crabs Nature has bestowed twin protective characteristics: namely,  they are armoured, and also mimic their surroundings. The latter  protection is especially needful, because certain big fishes, like the  cod, are in the habit of swallowing crabs whole. In this case the armour  is of no use, while the protective resemblance saves the crab.    To discuss in detail all the various kinds of armour and mail that the  different groups of animals have used and developed for offensive and  defensive purposes since the days of the prehistoric gigantic  armadillos to the present, would require a book of itself. It is  sufficient to know that armour and mail and spines are among Nature's  most common forms of protection, and that each age develops new and ever  more efficient methods of defence. This simply means that the age-long  drama of evolution is always changing. Everything that is came out of  that which was, and throughout the ages the ever-evolving organisms have  been developing out of the past, that they might ever be new.          V    MINERS AND EXCAVATORS      _\"When the cold winter comes and the water plants die,    And the little brooks yield no further supply,    Down in his burrow he cosily creeps,    And quietly through the long winter sleeps.\"_      --(_The Water Rat._)      There are many ground-dwellers in the animal world, and foremost among  them is the mole. This remarkable little creature is not only gifted as  a digger of canals and tunnels, but plans and makes the most  extraordinary subterranean homes. Sometimes he unites with his fellow  creatures and establishes whole cities with winding passages, chambers,  exits and entrances. In fact, he has not only an exquisitely arranged  home, but highways and roads that lead to his kingly hunting-grounds  which are as elaborate as that of a modern man of wealth and culture.  Indeed his subterranean network of tunnels excels in complexity our  modern city subways. His engineering calculations never fail, and a  cave-in of his hallways is unknown. This little gentleman with the  velvet coat is a genius of varied accomplishments!    But this is only true when the mole is in his proper sphere or home.  There he can fight like a tiger, catch his prey both below and above  ground, build wells to collect and retain water, swim like a fish, and  do many things which would seem impossible, judging from his awkward and  clumsy manner above ground.    His apparent awkwardness while out of his natural habitat is largely due  to the peculiar formation of his limbs, and the stupid appearance of his  small half-hidden eyes. These features seem to mark him to the casual  observer as a dull animal, yet in reality he is very active and bright,  and when at home displays his marvellous genius in many ways! His  upturned hands become powerful shovels, and by the aid of an extra bone,  the sickle, which belongs to the inside of the thumb, he is enabled to  work like an athlete. His velvet-like hair stands straight up, like the  pile on velvet, and his tiny eyes are so hidden by hair that they do not  get injured. The eyes are not well finished from an optician's point of  view--but they serve admirably all the needs of the mole's life. As dull  and stupid as he appears, he is, considering his size, the fiercest and  most active animal in existence. Imagine him the size of a wild cat! He  would be a beast of exceeding ferocity. Even a lion would find him a  formidable antagonist. With such an animal tunnelling in his fields and  cellars, man would have a terror hard to exterminate.    The mole is an engineer and miner who seems to have a strange sense of  direction practically unknown to many other animals. How he manages to  form tunnels and burrows in lines of such unusual straightness is  unknown; he always works in darkness, unless it is that he can see in  the dark. His little hills are not deliberate structures; they are only  shaft ends through which this miner throws out the earth that he has  scooped from subterranean depths, and in most cases smoothed out so that  if an observer examines the burrow he will find only solid earth, and a  road into his tunnel which leads to his real habitation.    The home of the mole is usually beneath a tree or hillock, and reminds  one of a miniature city of tunnels and engineering feats. The main, or  central, room is shaped like a great dome, the upper part of which is  level with the earth around the hill, and therefore nowhere near its  apex. Mr. Wood has verified the observation that around the keep are two  circular passages, one of which is level with the ceiling, while the  other is above. The upper circle is decidedly smaller than the lower;  and there are five ascending passages which connect the galleries with  each other. There is only one entrance, however, and from it three roads  lead into the upper part of the keep. When a mole enters the house from  one of the tunnels, he must go through the basement in order to get to  the upper part of the house and so descend into the keep. There is still  another entrance into the keep from below. One passage leads downward  directly from the middle of the chamber, then curving upward, leads into  a larger tunnel or subway."]]]
