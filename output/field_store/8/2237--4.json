Then he threw open the gate,  and said,--    \"Walk in, Mr. Mcintosh, and take possession.\"    \"No,\" cried Rory, \"I'll not trust myself among such vermin. I order you  to surrender!\"    At that moment a rifle was fired by some one in the fort, and the ball  passed through Captain Rory's face from side to side under the eyes.  He fell backwards, but immediately recovered, and stood on his feet  flourishing his claymore. Then he began to walk backward, his face to  the fort. Several shots were fired at him, and Jim called out,--    \"Run, massa, run! dey kill you!\"    \"Run!\" cried Rory scornfully. \"You may run, but I belong to a race that  never runs!\"    It was at the siege of Sunbury that Colonel Mcintosh, when summoned by  Colonel Prevost to surrender the fort, sent back the reply, \"Come and  take it!\"          AUNT NANCY HART.    There lived in Georgia, during the Revolutionary struggle, the most  remarkable woman in some respects that the country has produced. To find  her match, we shall have to go to the fables that are told about the  Amazons. The Liberty Boys called her Aunt Nancy Hart. The Indians,  struck by her wonderful feats in behalf of her country, called her \"The  War Woman;\" and there is a creek in Elbert County, where she lived, that  was named by the Indians \"War Woman's Creek.\"    There are other heroines to whom history has paid more attention, and  whose deeds have been celebrated in song and story; but not one of them  was more devoted to the high cause of freedom, or more courageous, or  depended less on aid from others, than Aunt Nancy Hart. In this last  respect, the War Woman of Georgia stands alone in history, just as she  stood alone when the Tories were waging a war of extermination, sparing  neither women nor children, in the region in which she lived. Invention  and fable have kindly come to the aid of the most famous of the world's  heroines, but neither fable nor invention has touched the character or  the deeds of this heroine of the Revolution. She stands out on the  pages of history rough, uncouth, hot-tempered, unmanageable, uneducated,  impolite, ugly, and sharp-tongued; but, as her friends said of her,  \"What a honey of a patriot she was!\" She loved the Liberty Boys as well  as she loved her own children. It has been said that she was cruel; but  this charge may as well be put out of sight. Before passing upon it,  we should have to know what the War Woman's eyes had seen, and  what terrible revelations her ears had heard. Standing for American  independence in a region that swarmed with Tories, whose murderous deeds  never have been and never will be fully set forth, Aunt Nancy Hart had  to defend her own hearthstone and her own children.    The maiden name of this remarkable woman was Morgan, and she was born in  North Carolina. She married Benjamin Hart, a brother of Colonel Thomas  Hart of Kentucky. Thomas Hart was the father of the wife of Henry Clay,  and the uncle of the celebrated Thomas Hart Benton. Aunt Nancy and her  husband moved to Georgia with the North Carolina emigrants, and settled  on Broad River, in what is now Elbert County. She was nearly six feet  high, and very muscular,--the result of hard work. She had red hair,  and it is said that she was cross-eyed, but this has been denied on  good authority. It matters little. Her eyes were keen enough to pierce  through all Tory disguises, and that was enough for her. It is certain  that her courage and her confidence kept alive the spark of liberty  in hearts that would otherwise have smothered it, and was largely  responsible for kindling it into the flame that finally swept the  British out of that section, and subdued the Tories. When the Whigs and  patriots who had been her neighbors were compelled to flee before the  murderous Tories, she refused to go with them, but stood her ground and  never ceased to speak her sentiments boldly. Nothing but the wholesome  dread with which she had inspired them prevented the Tories from  murdering her and her children. When General Elijah Clarke moved the  women and children of the Broad River region to an asylum in Kentucky,  and the Liberty Boys had taken refuge in South Carolina, Aunt Nancy Hart  remained at home, and for a long and dismal period she was unprotected  save by her own remarkable courage.    At that period the houses were built of logs, and the chimneys were  built of sticks plastered with clay. They were called \"stack chimneys.\"  One evening Aunt Nancy and her children were sitting around the fire, on  which a pot of soap was boiling. Now, a pot of soap must be constantly  stirred, and for this the strong, muscular arms of Aunt Nancy were  peculiarly fitted. So she stirred the soap, and, as she stirred, told  the youngsters the latest news of the war. Presently one of her children  chanced to discover some one peeping through the crack of the chimney,  eavesdropping. By a gesture or a nod of the head Aunt Nancy was informed  of what was going on. She smiled, and grew more spirited in her talk,  rattling away and laughing as she gave exaggerated accounts of the  recent defeats of the Tories. As she talked, she stirred the bubbling  soap, and kept her keen eyes on the crack where the eavesdropper had  been seen. Suddenly she dashed a ladleful of boiling soap through the  crack full into the face of the intruder. It was so quickly and deftly  done, that the eavesdropper had no time to dodge the scalding stuff. He  received the full benefit of it Blinded and half crazed by the pain,  he howled and screamed at a tremendous rate. Aunt Nancy went out,  and, after amusing herself at his expense, bound him fast and held  him prisoner. The probability is that the next day she H tucked up her  petticoats, shouldered her gun, and compelled the unlucky Tory to ford  the river ahead of her; and that, once on the other side, she kept in  constant communication with the Clarkes and with other partisans of the  American cause.    [Illustration: Aunt Nancy Hart 079]    Her husband, whom she sometimes jokingly described as \"a poor stick,\"  assisted her in her communications. A conch shell was kept at the  spring, some distance from the house. On this conch shell the children  were taught to blow the blasts that gave Mr. Hart information. One  signal was, \"The enemy is at hand;\" another was, \"Keep close;\" another,  \"Make tracks for the swamp;\" and still another was that he and his  friends were wanted at the cabin.    At the very darkest hour of the Revolution in Georgia, Aunt Nancy  performed one of her most remarkable feats,--one that brought into play  all the courage and devotion of her strong nature, and all the tact and  audacity that belonged to her character.    Brigadier General Andrew Williamson, with three hundred men, was  encamped near Augusta. When Charleston fell, this officer, who was  already a traitor, though his treachery had not been avowed, called his  officers together, and expressed the opinion that it would be foolish  to further resist the King. He therefore advised them to return to their  homes, and there accept the protection which would be offered them. He  then abandoned his command, which was immediately disbanded. Shortly  afterwards Colonels Brown and Garrison, two partisans of the King's army  who had made themselves notorious by their cruelty to Americans, seized  Augusta. Brown had been tarred and feathered in Augusta just before the  breaking-out of the Revolution, and he made the patriots of that town  and of the country roundabout pay dearly for the indignities that  had been heaped upon him on account of his loyalty to the Crown. He  confiscated the property of the patriots, and issued an order banishing  all Whig families beyond the borders of Georgia.    Raiding parties were sent into the region in the neighborhood of Augusta  to compel the inhabitants to take the oath of allegiance to the King.  One of these parties entered the house of Colonel John Dooly, a gallant  officer, and murdered him in cold blood in the presence of his wife and  children. Colonel Dooly was the father of Judge Dooly, who became famous  in Georgia after the war.    A detachment of this murdering party found its way to Aunt Nancy Hart's  cabin. There were five Tories in the detachment, and Aunt Nancy received  them coldly enough. They told her they had come to inquire into the  truth of a report they had heard to the effect that she had aided a  well-known rebel to escape from a company of King's men by whom he  was pursued. With a twinkle of malice in her eyes, Aunt Nancy boldly  declared that she had aided her Liberty Boy to escape, and then she  described the affair.    She said that one day she heard the gallop of a horse. Looking out, she  saw a horseman approaching, and at once knew him to be a Whig flying  from pursuers. She let down the bars near her cabin, told him to ride  his horse right through her house, in at the front door and out at the  back, to take to the swamp, and hide himself the best he could. She then  put up the bars, entered her house, closed the doors, and went about her  business. In a little while a party of Tories rode up, and called to her  with some rudeness. She muffled her head and face in a shawl, opened  the door slowly, and asked in a feeble voice who it was that wanted to  pester a sick, lone woman. The Tories said they had been pursuing a man,  and had traced him near her house. They wanted to know if any one had  passed that way. \"I told 'em,\" said Aunt Nancy to the listening Tories,  \"that I had seen a man on a sorrel horse turn out of the road into the  woods a little ways back. So they went back and took to the woods, and  my Whig boy got off safe and sound.\"    Naturally this story, boldly told, did not please the five Tories who  heard it; but something in the War Woman'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24737"],[0,"The Children of Odin: The Book of Northern Myths (#10)"],[1,"them the tasks of  tending the streams and the grasses and the flowers. And with the Vanir  he made peace after a war had been waged, taking Nioerd from them for a  hostage.    \"Bergelmir, the Giant who escaped drowning in Ymir's blood, had sons and  daughters in Joetunheim. They hated Odin and his sons and strove against  them. When Odin lighted up the world with the sun and the moon they were  very wroth, and they found two of the fiercest of the mighty wolves of  Joetunheim and set them to follow them. And still the sun and the moon,  Sol and Mani, are followed by the wolves of Joetunheim.\"    Such wonders did Heimdall with the Golden Teeth tell Hnossa, the  youngest of the Dwellers in Asgard. Often the child stayed with him by  the Rainbow Bridge, and saw the Gods pass to and from Midgard: Thor,  with his crown of stars, with the great hammer Mioelnir in his hands,  with the gloves of iron that he used when he grasped Mioelnir; Thor in  his chariot drawn by two goats and wearing the belt that doubled his  strength; Frigga, with her dress of falcon feathers, flying swiftly as a  bird; Odin All-Father himself, riding upon Sleipner, his eight-legged  steed, clad all in golden armor, with his golden helmet, shaped like an  eagle, upon his head, and with his spear Gungnir in his hand.    Heimdall kept his horn in the branch of a great tree. This tree was  called Ygdrassil, he told little Hnossa, and it was a wonder to Gods and  Men. \"No one knows of a time when Ygdrassil was not growing, and all are  afraid to speak of the time when it will be destroyed.    \"Ygdrassil has three roots. One goes deep under Midgard, another goes  deep under Joetunheim, and the third grows above Asgard. Over Odin's hall  a branch of Ygdrassil grows, and it is called the Peace Bough.    \"You see Ygdrassil, little Hnossa, but you do not know all the wonders  of it. Far up in its branches four stags graze; they shake from their  horns the water that falls as rain upon the earth. On the topmost branch  of Ygdrassil, the branch that is so high that the Gods themselves can  hardly see it, there is an eagle that knows all things. Upon the beak of  this eagle a hawk is perched, a hawk that sees what the eyes of the  eagle may not see.    \"The root of Ygdrassil that is in Midgard goes deep down to the place  of the dead. Here there is an evil dragon named Nidhoegg that gnaws  constantly at the root, striving to destroy Ygdrassil, the Tree of  trees. And Ratatoesk, the Squirrel of Mischief--behold him now!--runs up  and down Ygdrassil, making trouble between the eagle above and the  dragon below. He goes to tell the dragon how the eagle is bent upon  tearing him to pieces and he goes back to tell the eagle how the dragon  plans to devour him. The stories that he brings to Nidhoegg make that  evil dragon more fierce to destroy Ygdrassil, the Tree of trees, so that  he may come upon the eagle and devour him.    \"There are two wells by the roots of Ygdrassil, and one is above and one  is below. One is beside the root that grows in Joetunheim. This is a Well  of Knowledge, and it is guarded by old Mimir the Wise. Whoever drinks  out of this well knows of all the things that will come to be. The other  well is by the root that grows above Asgard. No one may drink out of  this well. The three sisters that are the holy Norns guard it, and they  take the white water from it to water Ygdrassil, that the Tree of Life  may keep green and strong. This well, little Hnossa, is called Urda's  Well.\"    And little Hnossa heard that by Urda's Well there were two beautiful  white swans. They made a music that the Dwellers in Asgard often heard.  But Hnossa was too young to hear the music that was made by the swans of  Urda's Well.          [Illustration]    THE ALL-FATHER'S FOREBODINGS: HOW HE LEAVES ASGARD      Two ravens had Odin All-Father; Hugin and Munin were their names; they  flew through all the worlds every day, and coming back to Asgard they  would light on Odin's shoulders and tell him of all the things they had  seen and heard. And once a day passed without the ravens coming back.  Then Odin, standing on the Watch-Tower Hlidskjalf, said to himself:         I fear me for Hugin,       Lest he come not back,       But I watch more for Munin.    A day passed and the ravens flew back. They sat, one on each of his  shoulders. Then did the All-Father go into the Council Hall that was  beside Glasir, the wood that had leaves of gold, and harken to what  Hugin and Munin had to tell him.    They told him only of shadows and forebodings. Odin All-Father did not  speak to the Dwellers in Asgard of the things they told him. But Frigga,  his Queen, saw in his eyes the shadows and forebodings of things to  come. And when he spoke to her about these things she said, \"Do not  strive against what must take place. Let us go to the holy Norns who sit  by Urda's Well and see if the shadows and the forebodings will remain  when you have looked into their eyes.\"    And so it came that Odin and the Gods left Asgard and came to Urda's  Well, where, under the great root of Ygdrassil, the three Norns sat,  with the two fair swans below them. Odin went, and Tyr, the great  swordsman, and Baldur, the most beautiful and the Best-Beloved of the  Gods, and Thor, with his Hammer.    A Rainbow Bridge went from Asgard, the City of the Gods, to Midgard, the  World of Men. But another Rainbow Bridge, more beautiful and more  tremulous still, went from Asgard to that root of Ygdrassil under which  was Urda's Well. This Rainbow Bridge was seldom seen by men. And where  the ends of the two rainbows came together Heimdall stood, Heimdall with  the Golden Teeth, the Watcher for the Gods, and the Keeper of the Way to  Urda's Well.    \"Open the gate, Heimdall,\" said the All-Father, \"open the gate, for  today the Gods would visit the holy Norns.\"    Without a word Heimdall opened wide the gate that led to that bridge  more colored and more tremulous than any rainbow seen from earth. Then  did Odin and Tyr and Baldur step out on the bridge. Thor followed, but  before his foot was placed on the bridge, Heimdall laid his hand upon  him.    \"The others may go, but you may not go that way, Thor,\" said Heimdall.    \"What? Would you, Heimdall, hold me back?\" said Thor.    \"Yes, for I am Keeper of the Way to the Norns,\" said Heimdall. \"You with  the mighty hammer you carry are too weighty for this way. The bridge I  guard would break under you, Thor with the hammer.\"    \"Nevertheless I will go visit the Norns with Odin and my comrades,\" said  Thor.    \"But not this way, Thor,\" said Heimdall. \"I will not let the bridge be  broken under the weight of you and your hammer. Leave your hammer here  with me if you would go this way.\"    \"No, no,\" said Thor. \"I will not leave in any one's charge the hammer  that defends Asgard. And I may not be turned back from going with Odin  and my comrades.\"    \"There is another way to Urda's Well,\" said Heimdall. \"Behold these two  great Cloud Rivers, Koermt and Ermt. Canst thou wade through them? They  are cold and suffocating, but they will bring thee to Urda's Well, where  sit the three holy Norns.\"    Thor looked out on the two great rolling rivers of cloud. It was a bad  way for one to go, cold and suffocating. Yet if he went that way he  could keep on his shoulder the hammer which he would not leave in  another's charge. He stept out into the Cloud River that flowed by the  Rainbow Bridge, and with his hammer upon his shoulder he went struggling  on to the other river.    Odin, Tyr, and Baldur were beside Urda's Well when Thor came struggling  out of the Cloud River, wet and choking, but with his hammer still upon  his shoulder. There stood Tyr, upright and handsome, leaning on his  sword that was inscribed all over with magic runes; there stood Baldur,  smiling, with his head bent as he listened to the murmur of the two fair  swans; and there stood Odin All-Father, clad in his blue cloak fringed  with golden stars, without the eagle-helmet upon his head, and with no  spear in his hands.    The three Norns, Urda, Verdandi, and Skulda, sat beside the well that  was in the hollow of the great root of Ygdrassil. Urda was ancient and  with white hair, and Verdandi was beautiful, while Skulda could hardly  be seen, for she sat far back, and her hair fell over her face and eyes.  Urda, Verdandi, and Skulda; they knew the whole of the Past, the whole  of the Present, and the whole of the Future. Odin, looking on them, saw  into the eyes of Skulda even. Long, long he stood looking on the Norns  with the eyes of a God, while the others listened to the murmur of the  swans and the falling of the leaves of Ygdrassil into Urda's Well.    Looking into their eyes, Odin saw the shadows and forebodings that Hugin  and Munin told him of take shape and substance. And now others came  across the Rainbow Bridge. They were Frigga and Sif and Nanna, the  wives of Odin and Thor and Baldur. Frigga looked upon the Norns. As she  did, she turned a glance of love and sadness upon Baldur, her son, and  then she drew back and placed her hand upon Nanna's head.    Odin turned from gazing on the Norns, and looked upon Frigga, his  queenly wife. \"I would leave Asgard for a while, wife of Odin,\" he said.    \"Yea,\" said Frigga. \"Much has to be done in Midgard, the World of Men.\"    \"I would change what knowledge I have into wisdom,\" said Odin, \"so that  the things that are to happen will be changed into the best that may  be.\"    \"You would go to Mimir's Well,\" said Frigga.    \"I would go to Mimir's Well,\" said Odin.    \"My husband, go,\" said Frigga.    Then they went back over that Rainbow Bridge that is more beautiful and  more tremulous than the one that men see from the earth; they went back  over the Rainbow Bridge, the AEsir and the Asyniur, Odin and Frigga,  Baldur and Nanna, Tyr, with his sword, and Sif beside Tyr. As for Thor,  he went struggling through the Cloud Rivers Koermt and"]]]
