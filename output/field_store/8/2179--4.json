I gave the travelling world to understand that I  intended to devote my establishment principally to the entertainment  of ladies, and the care of those who might fall ill on the route, and  I found the scheme answered admirably. And yet, although the speculation  paid well, I soon grew as weary of my life in Gorgona as I had been at  Cruces; and when I found my brother proof against all persuasion to  quit the Isthmus, I began to entertain serious thoughts of leaving  him.    Nor was it altogether my old roving inclination which led me to desire  a change, although I dare say it had something to do with it. My  present life was not agreeable for a woman with the least delicacy or  refinement; and of female society I had none. Indeed, the females who  crossed my path were about as unpleasant specimens of the fair sex as  one could well wish to avoid. With very few exceptions, those who were  not bad were very disagreeable, and as the majority came from the  Southern States of America, and showed an instinctive repugnance  against any one whose countenance claimed for her kindred with their  slaves, my position was far from a pleasant one. Not that it ever gave  me any annoyance; they were glad of my stores and comforts, I made  money out of their wants; nor do I think our bond of connection was  ever closer; only this, if any of them came to me sick and suffering  (I say this out of simple justice to myself), I forgot everything,  except that she was my sister, and that it was my duty to help her.    I may have before said that the citizens of the New Granada Republic  had a strong prejudice against all Americans. It is not difficult to  assign a cause for this. In the first place, many of the negroes,  fugitive from the Southern States, had sought refuge in this and the  other States of Central America, where every profession was open to  them; and as they were generally superior men--evinced perhaps by  their hatred of their old condition and their successful flight--they  soon rose to positions of eminence in New Granada. In the priesthood,  in the army, in all municipal offices, the self-liberated negroes were  invariably found in the foremost rank; and the people, for some  reason--perhaps because they recognised in them superior talents for  administration--always respected them more than, and preferred them  to, their native rulers. So that, influenced naturally by these freed  slaves, who bore themselves before their old masters bravely and like  men, the New Granada people were strongly prejudiced against the  Americans. And in the second and third places, they feared their  quarrelsome, bullying habits--be it remembered that the crowds to  California were of the lowest sorts, many of whom have since  fertilised Cuban and Nicaraguan soil--and dreaded their schemes for  annexation. To such an extent was this amusingly carried, that when  the American Railway Company took possession of Navy Bay, and  christened it Aspinwall, after the name of their Chairman, the native  authorities refused to recognise their right to name any portion of  the Republic, and pertinaciously returned all letters directed to  Aspinwall, with \"no such place known\" marked upon them in the very  spot for which they were intended. And, in addition to this, the legal  authorities refused to compel any defendant to appear who was  described as of Aspinwall, and put every plaintiff out of court who  described himself as residing in that unrecognised place.    Under these circumstances, my readers can easily understand that when  any Americans crossed the Isthmus, accompanied by their slaves, the  Cruces and Gorgona people were restlessly anxious to whisper into  their ears offers of freedom and hints how easy escape would be. Nor  were the authorities at all inclined to aid in the recapture of a  runaway slave. So that, as it was necessary for the losers to go on  with the crowd, the fugitive invariably escaped. It is one of the  maxims of the New Granada constitution--as it is, I believe, of the  English--that on a slave touching its soil his chains fall from him.  Rather than irritate so dangerous a neighbour as America, this rule  was rarely supported; but I remember the following instance of its  successful application.    A young American woman, whose character can be best described by the  word \"vicious,\" fell ill at Gorgona, and was left behind by her  companions under the charge of a young negro, her slave, whom she  treated most inhumanly, as was evinced by the poor girl's frequent  screams when under the lash. One night her cries were so distressing,  that Gorgona could stand it no longer, but broke into the house and  found the chattel bound hand and foot, naked, and being severely  lashed. Despite the threats and astonishment of the mistress, they  were both carried off on the following morning, before the alcalde,  himself a man of colour, and of a very humane disposition. When the  particulars of the case were laid before him, he became strongly  excited, and called upon the woman to offer an explanation of her  cruelty. She treated it with the coolest unconcern--\"The girl was her  property, worth so many dollars, and a child at New Orleans; had  misbehaved herself, and been properly corrected. The alcalde must be  drunk or a fool, or both together, to interfere between an American  and her property.\" Her coolness vanished, however, when the alcalde  turned round to the girl and told her that she was free to leave her  mistress when she liked; and when she heard the irrepressible cheering  of the crowded court-hut at the alcalde's humanity and boldness, and  saw the slave's face flush with delight at the judge's words, she  became terribly enraged; made use of the most fearful threats, and  would have wreaked summary vengeance on her late chattel had not the  clumsy soldiery interfered. Then, with demoniac refinement of cruelty,  she bethought herself of the girl's baby at New Orleans still in her  power, and threatened most horrible torture to the child if its mother  dared to accept the alcalde's offer.    The poor girl trembled and covered her face with her hands, as though  to shut out some fearful sight, and, I think, had we not persuaded her  to the contrary, that she would have sacrificed her newly won freedom  for the child's sake. But we knew very well that when the heat of  passion had subsided, the threatener would be too 'cute to injure her  own property; and at once set afloat a subscription for the purchase  of the child. The issue of the tale I do not know, as the woman was  very properly removed into the interior of the country.    Life at Gorgona resembled life at Cruces so nearly that it does not  need a separate description. Down with the store and hotel keepers  came the muleteers and mules, porters and hangers-on, idlers and  thieves, gamblers and dancing women; and soon the monte-tables were  fitted up, and plying their deadly trade; and the dancers charmed the  susceptible travellers as successfully in the dirty streets of Gorgona  as they had previously done in the unwholesome precincts of Cruces.  And Dr. Casey was very nearly getting himself into serious trouble,  from too great a readiness to use his revolver. Still, he had a better  excuse for bloodshed this time than might have been found for his  previous breaches of the sixth commandment. Among the desperadoes who  frequented his gambling-hut, during their short stay in Gorgona, was  conceived the desperate plan of putting out the lights, and upsetting  Casey's table--trusting in the confusion to carry off the piles of  money upon it. The first part of their programme was successfully  carried out; but the second was frustrated by the Doctor promptly  firing his revolver into the dark, and hitting an unoffending boy in  the hip. And at this crisis the Gorgona police entered, carried off  all the parties they could lay hands upon (including the Doctor) to  prison, and brought the wounded boy to me.    On the following morning came a most urgent request that I would visit  the imprisoned Doctor. I found him desperately angry, but somewhat  nervous too, for the alcalde was known to be no friend to the  Americans, owed Casey more than one grudge, and had shown recently a  disposition to enforce the laws.    \"I say, Mrs. Seacole, how's that ---- boy?\"    \"Oh, Dr. Casey, how could you shoot the poor lad, and now call him bad  names, as though he'd injured you? He is very ill indeed--may die; so  I advise you to think seriously of your position.\"    \"But, Madame Seacole,\" (this in a very altered tone), \"_you'll_ surely  help me? _you'll_ surely tell the alcalde that the wound's a slight  one? He's a friend of yours, and will let me out of this hole. Come,  Madame Seacole, you'll never leave me to be murdered by these  bloodthirsty savages?\"    \"What can I do or say, Dr. Casey? I must speak the truth, and the ball  is still in the poor lad's hip,\" I answered, for I enjoyed the  fellow's fear too much to help him. However, he sent some of his  friends to the boy's father, and bribed him to take the lad from my  care, and send him to Navy Bay, to a surgeon there. Of course, he  never returned to prosecute Dr. Casey; and he was left with the  alcalde only to deal with, who, although he hated the man, could not  resist his money, and so set him free.    Gorgona lying lower than Cruces, its inhabitants more frequently  enjoyed the excitement of a flood. After heavy rains, the river would  rise so rapidly that in a few hours the chief part of the place would  be under water. On such occasions the scene was unusually exciting. As  the water crept up the street, the frightened householders kept  removing their goods and furniture to higher ground; while here and  there, where the waters had surrounded them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23033"],[0,"Classic French Course in English (#10)"],[1,"style of expression. Emerson's trick of writing \"'tis,\"  was apparently caught from Cotton. The following sentence, from the  present essay of Montaigne, might very well have served Mr. Emerson for  his own rule of writing: \"Let it go before, or come after, a good  sentence, or a thing well said, is always in season; if it neither suit  well with what went before, nor has much coherence with what follows  after, it is good in itself.\" Montaigne, at any rate, wrote his \"Essays\"  on that easy principle. The logic of them is the logic of mere chance  association in thought. But, with Montaigne,--whatever is true of  Emerson,--the association at least is not occult; and it is such as  pleases the reader, not less than it pleased the writer. So this Gascon  gentleman of the olden time never tires us, and never loses us out of  his hand. We go with him cheerfully where he so blithely leads.    Montaigne tells us how he was himself trained under his father. The  elder Montaigne, too, had his ideas on education,--the subject which his  son, in this essay, so instructively treats. The essayist leads up to  his autobiographical episode by an allusion to the value of the  classical languages, and to the question of method in studying them. He  says:--         In my infancy, and before I began to speak, he [my father]       committed me to the care of a German,... totally ignorant of our       language, but very fluent, and a great critic, in Latin. This man,       whom he had fetched out of his own country, and whom he entertained       with a very great salary, for this only end, had me continually       with him: to him there were also joined two others, of inferior       learning, to attend me, and to relieve him, who all of them spoke       to me in no other language but Latin. As to the rest of his family,       it was an inviolable rule, that neither himself nor my mother, man       nor maid, should speak any thing in my company, but such Latin       words as every one had learned only to gabble with me. It is not to       be imagined how great an advantage this proved to the whole family:       my father and my mother by this means learned Latin enough to       understand it perfectly well, and to speak it to such a degree as       was sufficient for any necessary use, as also those of the servants       did, who were most frequently with me. In short, we Latined it at       such a rate, that it overflowed to all the neighboring villages,       where there yet remain, that have established themselves by custom,       several Latin appellations of artisans and their tools. As for what       concerns myself, I was above six years of age before I understood       either French or Perigordin [\"Perigordin\" is Montaigne's name for       the dialect of his province, Perigord (Gascony)], any more than       Arabic; and, without art, book, grammar, or precept, whipping, or       the expense of a tear, I had, by that time, learned to speak as       pure Latin as my master himself, for I had no means of mixing it up       with any other.    We are now to see how, helped by his wealth, the father was able to  gratify a pleasant whimsey of his own in the nurture of his boy. Highly  aesthetic was the matin _reveille_ that broke the slumbers of this  hopeful young heir of Montaigne:--         Some being of opinion that it troubles and disturbs the brains of       children suddenly to wake them in the morning, and to snatch them       violently and over-hastily from sleep, wherein they are much more       profoundly involved than we, he [the father] caused me to be       wakened by the sound of some musical instrument, and was never       unprovided of a musician for that purpose.... The good man, being       extremely timorous of any way failing in a thing he had so wholly       set his heart upon, suffered himself at last to be overruled by the       common opinions:... he sent me, at six years of age, to the College       of Guienne, at that time the best and most flourishing in France.    In short, as in the case of Mr. Tulliver, the world was \"too many\" for  Eyquem _pere_; and, in the education of his son, the stout Gascon,  having started out well as dissenter, fell into dull conformity at last.    We ought to give some idea of the odd instances, classic and other, with  which Montaigne plentifully bestrews his pages. He is writing of the  \"Force of Imagination.\" He says:--         A woman, fancying she had swallowed a pin in a piece of bread,       cried and lamented as though she had an intolerable pain in her       throat, where she thought she felt it stick; but an ingenious       fellow that was brought to her, seeing no outward tumor nor       alteration, supposing it to be only a conceit taken at some crust       of bread that had hurt her as it went down, caused her to vomit,       and, unseen, threw a crooked pin into the basin, which the woman no       sooner saw, but, believing she had cast it up, she presently found       herself eased of her pain....         Such as are addicted to the pleasures of the field, have, I make       no question, heard the story of the falconer, who, having earnestly       fixed his eyes upon a kite in the air, laid a wager that he would       bring her down with the sole power of his sight, and did so, as it       was said; for _the tales I borrow, I charge upon the consciences of       those from whom I have them_.    We italicize the last foregoing words, to make readers see that  Montaigne is not to be read for the truth of his instances. He uses what  comes to hand. He takes no trouble to verify. \"The discourses are my  own,\" he says; but even this, as we have hinted, must not be pressed too  hard in interpretation. Whether a given reflection of Montaigne's is  strictly his own, in the sense of not having been first another's, who  gave it to him, is not to be determined except upon very wide reading,  very well remembered, in all the books that Montaigne could have got  under his eye. That was full fairly his own, he thought, which he had  made his own by intelligent appropriation. And this, perhaps, expresses  in general the sound law of property in the realm of mind. At any rate,  Montaigne will wear no yoke of fast obligation. He will write as pleases  him. Above all things else, he likes his freedom.    Here is one of those sagacious historical scepticisms, in which  Montaigne was so fond of poising his mind between opposite views. It  occurs in his essay entitled, \"Of the Uncertainty of our Judgments.\"         Amongst other oversights Pompey is charged withal at the battle of       Pharsalia, he is condemned for making his army stand still to       receive the enemy's charge, \"by reason that\" (I shall here steal       Plutarch's own words, which are better than mine) \"he by so doing       deprived himself of the violent impression the motion of running       adds to the first shock of arms, and hindered that clashing of the       combatants against one another, which is wont to give them greater       impetuosity and fury, especially when they come to rush in with       their utmost vigor, their courages increasing by the shouts and the       career; 'tis to render the soldiers' ardor, as a man may say, more       reserved and cold.\" This is what he says. But, if Caesar had come by       the worse, why might it not as well have been urged by another,       that, on the contrary, the strongest and most steady posture of       fighting is that wherein a man stands planted firm, without motion;       and that they who are steady upon the march, closing up, and       reserving their force within themselves for the push of the       business, have a great advantage against those who are disordered,       and who have already spent half their breath in running on       precipitately to the charge? Besides that, an army is a body made       up of so many individual members, it is impossible for it to move       in this fury with so exact a motion as not to break the order of       battle, and that the best of them are not engaged before their       fellows can come on to help them.    The sententiousness of Montaigne may be illustrated by transferring here  a page of brief excerpts from the \"Essays,\" collected by Mr. Bayle St.  John in his biography of the author. This apothegmatic or proverbial  quality in Montaigne had a very important sequel of fruitful influence  on subsequent French writers, as chapters to follow in this volume will  abundantly show. In reading the sentences subjoined, you will have the  sensation of coming suddenly upon a treasure-trove of coined proverbial  wisdom:--         Our minds are never at home, but ever beyond home.         I will take care, if possible, that my death shall say nothing that       my life has not said.         Life in itself is neither good nor bad: it is the place of what is       good or bad.         Knowledge should not be stuck on to the mind, but incorporated in       it.         Irresolution seems to me the most common and apparent vice of our       nature.         Age wrinkles the mind more than the face.         Habit is a second nature.         Hunger cures love.         It is easier to get money than to keep it.         Anger has often been the vehicle of courage.         It is more difficult to command than to obey.         A liar should have a good memory.         Ambition is the daughter of presumption.         To serve a prince, you must be discreet and a liar.         We learn to live when life has passed.         The mind is ill at ease when its companion has the colic.         We are all richer than we think, but we are brought up to go       a-begging.         The greatest masterpiece of man is... to be born at the right time.    We append a saying of Montaigne's not found in Mr. St. John's  collection:--         There is no so good man who so squares all his thoughts and actions       to the laws, that he is"]]]
