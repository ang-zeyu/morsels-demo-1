(#10)"],[1," Turkey in Asia which is  watered by the Euphrates and Tigris, and saw the ruined city of  Babylon, passing by what is said to be the furnace into which  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were thrown, and the tower of Babel,  which he describes as follows. \"The tower built by the tribes that  were dispersed is of bricks; its largest ground work must be two  miles in circumference; its length is two hundred and forty cubits.  At every ten cubits there is a passage leading to a spiral staircase,  which goes to the upper part of the building; from the tower there  is a view of the surrounding country for twenty miles; but the wrath  of God fell upon it and it is now only a heap of ruins.\"    [Illustration: The Tower of Babel.]    From Babel the traveller went to the Synagogue of Ezekiel, situated  on the Euphrates, a real sanctuary where believers congregate to  read the book written by the prophet. Then traversing Alkotzonath,  &c., to Sura, once the site of a celebrated Jewish college, and  Shafjathib, whose synagogue is built with stones from Jerusalem, and  crossing the desert of Yemen he passed Themar, Tilimar, and Chaibar  which contained a great number of Jewish inhabitants, to Waseth; and  thence to Bassorah on the Tigris, nearly at the end of the Persian  Gulf.    He gives no account of this important town; and thence he seems to  have gone to Karna, to visit the tomb of the prophet Esdras; then he  entered Persia and sojourned at Chuzestan, a large town, partly in  ruins, which the river Tigris divides into two parts, one rich the  other poor, joined by a bridge, over which hangs the coffin of  Daniel the prophet. He went to Amaria, which is the boundary of  Media, where he says the impostor David-el-roi appeared, the worker  of false miracles, who is none other than our Lord Jesus Christ, but  called among the Jews of that part by the former name. Then he went  to Hamadan, where the tombs of Mordecai and Esther are found, and by  Dabrestan he reached Ispahan, the capital of the kingdom, a city  measuring twelve miles in circumference. At this point the narrative  of the traveller becomes somewhat obscure; according to his notes we  find him at Shiraz, then at Samarcand, then at the foot of the  mountains in Thibet. This seems to have been his farthest point  towards the north-east; he must have come back to Nizapur and  Chuzestan on the banks of the Tigris; thence after a sea voyage of  two days to El-Cachif, an Arabian town on the Persian Gulf, where  the pearl fishery is carried on. Then, after another voyage of seven  days and crossing the Sea of Oman, he seems to have reached Quilon  on the coast of Malabar.    He was at last in India, the kingdom of the worshippers of the Sun  and of the descendants of Cush. This country produces pepper, ginger,  and cinnamon. Twenty days after leaving Quilon he was among the  fire-worshippers in Ceylon, and thence, perhaps, he went to China.  He thought this voyage a very perilous one, and says that many  vessels are lost on it, giving the following singular expedient for  averting the danger. \"You should take on board with you several  skins of oxen, and, if the wind rises and threatens the vessel with  danger, all who wish to escape envelope themselves each in a skin,  sew up this skin so as to make it as far as possible water-tight,  then throw themselves into the sea, and flocks of the great eagles  called griffins, thinking that they are really oxen, will descend  and bear them on their wings to some mountain or valley, there to  devour their prey. Immediately on reaching land the man will kill  the eagle with his knife, and leaving the skin, will walk towards  the nearest habitation; many people,\" he adds, \"have been saved by  this means.\"    We find Benjamin of Tudela again at Ceylon, then at the Island of  Socotra in the Persian Gulf, and after crossing the Red Sea he  arrives in Abyssinia, which he styles \"the India that is on terra  firma.\" Thence he goes down the Nile, crosses the country of Assouan,  reaches the town of Holvan, and by the Sahara, where the sand  swallows up whole caravans, he goes to Zairlah, Kous, Faiouna and  Misraim or Cairo.    This last is a large town containing fine squares and shops. It  never rains there, but this want is supplied by the overflow of the  Nile once a year, which waters the country and renders it very  fertile.    [Illustration: Benjamin of Tudela in the Desert of Sahara.]    He passed Gizeh on leaving Misraim but does not mention the pyramids,  and just names Ain-Schams, Boutig, Zefita, and Damira; he stopped at  Alexandria, built by Alexander the Great, a city of great commerce,  frequented by merchants from all parts of the world. Its squares and  streets are thronged with people, and so long that one cannot see  from one end to another. A dike or causeway runs out a mile into the  sea, on which a high tower was built by the conqueror, and on the  top of it a glass mirror was placed, by which all vessels could be  seen while still fifty days' sail away, coming from Greece or the  east on their way to make war upon or otherwise harm the town. \"This  tower,\" if we may credit the writer, \"is still of use as a signal to  vessels coming to Alexandria, for it can be seen night or day, a  great flaming torch being kept lighted at night, visible 100 miles  off!\" What are our light-houses when even with the electric light  they are only visible thirty miles away? From Damietta, the  traveller visited several neighbouring towns, then returning there  he embarked on board a vessel and twenty days afterwards landed at  Messina. He wished to continue the census that he was making, so by  way of Rome and Lucca he went to St. Bernard. He mentions visiting  several towns both in Germany and France, where Jews had settled,  and according to Chateaubriand's account, Benjamin of Tudela's  computation brought the number of Jews to about 768,165.    In conclusion the traveller speaks of Paris, which he seems to have  visited; he says, \"This great town numbers among its inhabitants  some remarkably learned men, who are unequalled for learning by any  in the world; they spend all their time studying law, and at the  same time are very hospitable to all strangers, but especially to  all their Jewish brethren.\" Such is the account of Benjamin of  Tudela's travels; they form an important part of the geographical  science of the middle of the twelfth century. As we have used the  modern names, it is easy to follow the short account of his route  that we have given, on any atlas of the present day.    Next in order of succession we come to the name of Jean du Plan de  Carpin, or as some authors render it simply, Carpini. He was a  Franciscan or Grey Friar, born in 1182, at Perugia in Italy. It is  well known what inroads the Mongolians had made under Gengis-Khan,  and in 1206 this chieftain had made Karakorum, an ancient Turkish  town, his capital. This town was a little north of China. His  successor Ojadai, extended the Mongolian dominion into the centre of  China, and, after raising an army of 600,000 men, he even invaded  Europe. Russia, Georgia, Poland, Moravia, Silesia, and Hungary, all  became the scenes of sanguinary conflicts which almost always ended  in favour of the invaders. The Mongols were looked upon as demons  possessed with superhuman power, and Western Europe was terrified at  their approach.    Pope Innocent IV. sent an ambassador to the Tartars, but he was  treated with arrogance; at the same time he sent other ambassadors  to the Tartars living in North-Eastern Tartary, in the hope of  stopping the Mongolian invasion, and as chief in this mission, the  Franciscan Carpini was chosen, being known to be a clever and  intelligent diplomatist. Carpini was accompanied by Stephen, a  Bohemian; they set out on the 6th of April, 1245, and went first to  Bohemia, where the king gave them letters to some relations living  in Poland, who he hoped might facilitate their entrance into Russia.  Carpini had no difficulty in reaching the territory of the Archduke  of Russia, and by his advice they bought beaver and other furs as  presents for the Tartar chiefs. Thus provided, they took a  north-easterly route to Kiev, then the chief town of Russia and now  the seat of Government of that part, but they travelled in fear of  the Lithuanians, who scoured the country at that time.    The Governor of Kiev advised the Pope's envoys to exchange their own  for Tartar horses, who were accustomed to seek for their food under  the snow, and thus mounted they had no difficulty in getting as far  as Danilisha. There they both were attacked by severe illness; when  nearly recovered they bought a carriage, and in spite of the intense  cold set out again. Arrived at Kaniev, on the Dnieper, they found  themselves in the frontier town of the Mongol empire, and hence they  were conducted to the Tartar camp by one of the chiefs, whom they  had made their friend by gifts. In the camp they were badly received  at first, but being directed to the Duke of Corrensa, who commanded  an army of 60,000 men forming the advanced guard: this general sent  them with an escort of three Tartars to Prince Bathy, the next in  command to the Emperor himself. Relays of horses were prepared for  them on the road, they travelled night and day, and thus passed  through the Comans' country lying between the Dnieper, the Tanais,  the Volga, and the Yaik, frequently having to cross the frozen  rivers, and finally reaching the court of Prince Bathy on the  frontiers of the Comans' country. \"As we were being conducted to the  prince,\" says Carpini, \"we were told that we should have to pass  between two fires, in order to purify us from any infection we might  carry, and also to do away with any evil designs we might have  towards the prince, which we agreed to do that we might be freed  from all suspicion.\"    The prince was seated on his throne in the midst of his courtiers"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24780"],[0,"The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from her Majesty's correspondence (#10)"],[1,"to Sir Robert Peel._    PAVILION, _10th February 1845._    Though the Queen knows that Sir Robert Peel has already turned his  attention to the urgent necessity of doing something to Buckingham  Palace, the Queen thinks it right to recommend this subject herself to  his serious consideration. Sir Robert is acquainted with the state of  the Palace and the total want of accommodation for our little family,  which is fast growing up. Any building must necessarily take some  years before it can be safely inhabited. If it were to be begun this  autumn, it could hardly be occupied before the spring of 1848, when  the Prince of Wales would be nearly seven, and the Princess Royal  nearly eight years old, and they cannot possibly be kept in the  nursery any longer. A provision for this purpose ought, therefore, to  be made this year. Independent of this, most parts of the Palace are  in a sad state, and will ere long require a further outlay to render  them _decent_ for the occupation of the Royal Family or any visitors  the Queen may have to receive. A room, capable of containing a larger  number of those persons whom the Queen has to invite in the course  of the season to balls, concerts, etc., than any of the present  apartments can at once hold, is much wanted. Equally so, improved  offices and servants' rooms, the want of which puts the departments  of the household to great expense yearly. It will be for Sir Robert to  consider whether it would not be best to remedy all these deficiencies  at once, and to make use of this opportunity to render the exterior of  the Palace such as no longer to be a _disgrace_ to the country, which  it certainly now is. The Queen thinks the country would be better  pleased to have the question of the Sovereign's residence in London  so finally disposed of, than to have it so repeatedly brought before  it.[4]        [Footnote 4: Peel replied that, as a renewal of the Income Tax      was about to be proposed, it would be better to postpone the      application to Parliament till the public feeling as to the      tax had been ascertained.]          [PAGEHEADING: TITLE OF KING CONSORT]      _Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._    PAVILION, _18th February 1845._    The Queen has received Sir Robert Peel's letter, and is glad that the  progress in the House of Commons was so satisfactory.    The Queen was much hurt at Mr Borthwick's most impertinent manner of  putting the question with respect to the title of King Consort, and  much satisfied with Sir Robert's answer.[5] The title of King is  open assuredly to many difficulties, and would perhaps be no _real_  advantage to the Prince, but the Queen is positive that something must  at once be done to place the Prince's position on a constitutionally  recognised footing, and to give him a title adequate to that  position.[6] _How_ and _when_, are difficult questions....        [Footnote 5: A paragraph had appeared in the _Morning      Chronicle_, giving credence to a rumour that this title was      about to be conferred on the Prince, but, in answer to Mr      Peter Borthwick, Sir Robert Peel positively contradicted it.]        [Footnote 6:        _Sir Robert Peel to the Prince Albert._        WHITEHALL, _15th February 1845._        SIR,--I received yesterday the accompanying note from Mr      Borthwick, and in conformity with the notice therein given,      he put the question to me in the House of Commons last evening      respecting the paragraph which appeared in the _Morning      Chronicle_ respecting the intention of proposing to Parliament      that your Royal Highness should assume the title of King      Consort.        I very much regret that the _Morning Chronicle_ inserted that      paragraph.        The prominent place assigned to it in the newspaper, and a      vague intimation that there was some authority for it, have      caused a certain degree of credit to be attached to it. It has      been copied into all the country newspapers and has given rise      to a good deal of conjecture and speculation, which it is far      from desirable to excite without necessity.        It appears to me that the editor of the _Morning Chronicle_      acted most unwarrantably in inserting such a paragraph with a      pretence of some sort of authority for it.        It has produced an impression which strongly confirms the      observations which I took the liberty of making to your Royal      Highness on Sunday evening.        I trust, however, that my decided contradiction of the      paragraph will put a stop to further surmise and discussion on      the subject.        To Mr Borthwick's note I add one of several letters      addressed to me, which shows the proneness to speculate upon      constitutional novelties.        I have the honour to be, Sir, with sincere respect, your Royal      Highness's most faithful and obedient Servant,        ROBERT PEEL.]          _Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _24th March 1845._    The Queen has received Sir Robert Peel's box containing his  recommendation relative to the filling up of the vacant Bishopric of  Ely. The Queen quite approves of the present Dean of Westminster[7]  as the new Bishop. As Sir Robert has asked the Queen whether she  would like to see Archdeacon Wilberforce succeed to the Deanery of  Westminster in case the Dean should accept the Bishopric, she must say  that such an arrangement would be _very satisfactory_ to us, and the  Queen believes would highly please the Archdeacon. This would again  vacate, the Queen believes, a stall at Winchester, which she would  like to see filled by a person decidedly adverse to Puseyism.    The Queen approves of the Bishop of Lichfield[8] being transferred to  the See of Ely in case Doctor Turton should decline it.    It would give the Queen much pleasure to stand sponsor to Sir Robert  Peel's little grandson, and perhaps Sir Robert would communicate this  to Lady Villiers.        [Footnote 7: Dr Thomas Turton (1780-1864), formerly Dean of      Peterborough.]        [Footnote 8: John Lonsdale (1788-1867) was Bishop of Lichfield      from 1843 till his death.]          [Pageheading: PURCHASE OF OSBORNE]      _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _25th March 1845._    ... I copied what you wrote me about Peel[9] in a letter I wrote him,  which I am sure will please him much, and a Minister in these days  _does_ require a little encouragement, for the abuse and difficulties  they have to contend with are dreadful. Peel works so hard and has so  much to do, that sometimes he says he does not know _how_ he is to get  through it all!    You will, I am sure, be pleased to hear that we have succeeded in  purchasing _Osborne_ in the Isle of Wight,[10] and if we can manage  it, we shall probably run down there before we return to Town, for  three nights. It sounds so snug and nice to have a place of _one's  own_, quiet and retired, and free from all Woods and Forests, and  other charming Departments who really are the plague of one's life.    Now, dearest Uncle, adieu. Ever your truly devoted Niece,    VICTORIA R.        [Footnote 9: See Peel's reply, _Life of the Prince Consort_,      chap. xiii.]        [Footnote 10: The purchase was suggested by Sir Robert Peel.]          _Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._    BUCKINGHAM PALACE, _3rd April 1845._    The Queen had intended to have written to Lord Melbourne from Osborne  to thank him for his last note of the 19th, but we were so occupied,  and so delighted with _our new_ and really delightful _home_, that  she hardly had time for anything; besides which the weather was so  beautiful, that we were out almost all day. The Queen refers Lord  Melbourne to Mr Anson for particulars of the new property, which is  very extensive, as she is not at all competent to explain about  acres, etc. But she thinks it is impossible to imagine a prettier  spot--valleys and woods which would be beautiful anywhere; but all  this near the sea (the woods grow into the sea) is quite perfection;  we have a charming beach quite to ourselves. The sea was so blue and  calm that the Prince said it was like Naples. And then we can walk  about anywhere by ourselves without being followed and mobbed, which  Lord Melbourne will easily understand is delightful. And last, not  least, we have Portsmouth and Spithead so close at hand, that we shall  be able to watch what is going on, which will please the Navy, and be  hereafter very useful for our boys.    The Children are all well. The Queen has just had a lithograph made  after a little drawing which she did herself of the three eldest, and  which she will send Lord Melbourne with some Eau de Cologne.    Fanny and Lord Jocelyn dined here last night; she is looking very  well, and he seems much pleased at being in office, and being  employed.    The Queen hopes Lord Melbourne is enjoying this fine weather, and here  concludes with the Prince's kind remembrance.

But  the bigotry, the wicked and blind passions it brings forth is quite  dreadful, and I blush for Protestantism![12] A Presbyterian clergyman  said very truly, \"_Bigotry_ is more _common than shame_....\"        [Footnote 11: The Bill to increase the grant to the Roman      Catholic College of Maynooth was carried by Peel in the teeth      of opposition from half his party: another measure was passed      to establish colleges for purely secular teaching (\"godless      colleges\" they were nicknamed) in Cork, Belfast, and Galway,"]]]
