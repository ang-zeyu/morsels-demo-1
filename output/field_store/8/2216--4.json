Setting aside the more colossal phenomena  of volcanic eruptions, we have innumerable minor manifestations of its  presence. Are there not geysers and hot springs in many parts of the  earth? and have we not all over our globe invariable testimony  confirming the statement, that the deeper we go down beneath its  surface the hotter does the temperature become? Every miner is  familiar with these facts; he knows that the deeper are his shafts the  warmer it is down below, and the greater the necessity for providing  increased ventilation to keep the temperature within a limit that  shall be suitable for the workmen. All these varied classes of  phenomena admit solely of one explanation, and that is, that the  interior of the earth contains vast stores of incandescent heat.    We now apply to our earth the same reasoning which we should employ on  a poker taken from the fire, or on a casting drawn from the foundry.  Such bodies will lose their heat by radiation and conduction. The  earth is therefore losing its heat. No doubt the process is an  extremely slow one. The mighty reservoirs of internal heat are covered  by vast layers of rock, which are such excellent non-conductors that  they offer every possible impediment to the leakage of heat from the  interior to the surface. We coat our steam-pipes over with  non-conducting material, and this can now be done so successfully,  that it is beginning to be found economical to transmit steam for a  very long distance through properly protected pipes. But no  non-conducting material that we can manufacture can be half so  effective as the shell of rock twenty miles or more in thickness,  which secures the heated interior of the earth from rapid loss by  radiation into space. Even were the earth's surface solid copper or  solid silver, both most admirable conductors of heat, the cooling down  of this vast globe would be an extremely tardy process; how much more  tardy must it therefore be when such exceedingly bad conductors as  rocks form the envelope? How imperfectly material of this kind will  transmit heat is strikingly illustrated by the great blast iron  furnaces which are so vitally important in one of England's greatest  manufacturing industries. A glowing mass of coal and iron ore and  limestone is here urged to vivid incandescence by a blast of air  itself heated to an intense temperature. The mighty heat thus  generated--sufficient as it is to detach the iron from its close  alliance with the earthy materials and to render the metal out as a  pure stream rushing white-hot from the vent--is sufficiently confined  by a few feet of brick-work, one side of which is therefore at the  temperature of molten iron, while the other is at a temperature not  much exceeding that of the air. We may liken the brick-work of a blast  furnace to the rocky covering of the earth; in each case an  exceedingly high temperature on one side is compatible with a very  moderate temperature on the other.    Although the drainage of heat away from the earth's interior to its  surface, and its loss there by radiation into space, is an extremely  tardy process, yet it is incessantly going on. We have here again to  note the ability for gigantic effect which a small but continually  operating cause may have, provided it always tends in the same  direction. The earth is incessantly losing heat; and though in a day,  a week, or a year the loss may not be very significant, yet when we  come to deal with periods of time that have to be reckoned by millions  of years, it may well be that the effect of a small loss of heat per  annum can, in the course of these ages, reach unimagined dimensions.  Suppose, for instance, that the earth experienced a fall of  temperature in its interior which amounted to only one-thousandth of a  degree in a year. So minute a quantity as this is imperceptible. Even  in a century, the loss of heat at this rate would be only the tenth of  a degree. There would be no possible way of detecting it; the most  careful thermometer could not be relied on to tell us for a certainty  that the temperature of the hot waters of Bath had declined the tenth  of a degree; and I need hardly say, that the fall of a tenth of a  degree would signify nothing in the lavas of Vesuvius, nor influence  the thunders of Krakatoa by one appreciable note. So far as a human  life or the life of the human race is concerned, the decline of a  tenth of a degree per century in the earth's internal heat is  absolutely void of significance. I cannot, however, impress upon you  too strongly, that the mere few thousands of years with which human  history is cognizant are an inappreciable moment in comparison with  those unmeasured millions of years which geology opens out to us, or  with those far more majestic periods which the astronomer demands for  the events he has to describe.    An annual loss of even one-thousandth of a degree will be capable of  stupendous achievements when supposed to operate during epochs of  geological magnitude. In fact, its effects would be so vast, that it  seems hardly credible that the present loss of heat from the earth  should be so great as to amount to an abatement of one-thousandth of a  degree per annum, for that would mean, that in a thousand years the  earth's temperature would decline by one degree, and in a million  years the decline would amount to a thousand degrees. At all events,  the illustration may suffice to show, that the fact that we are not  able to prove by our instruments that the earth is cooling is no  argument whatever against the inevitable law, that the earth, like  every other heated body, must be tending towards a lower temperature.    Without pretending to any numerical accuracy, we can at all events  give a qualitative if not a quantitative analysis of the past history of  our earth, in so far as its changes of temperature are concerned. A  million years ago our earth doubtless contained appreciably more heat  than it does at present. I speak not now, of course, of mere solar  heat--of the heat which gives us the vicissitudes of seasons; I am  only referring to the original hoard of internal heat which is  gradually waning. As therefore our retrospect extends through  millions and millions of past ages, we see our earth ever growing  warmer and warmer the further and further we look back. There was a  time when those heated strata which we have now to go deep down in  mines to find were considerably nearer the surface. At present, were  it not for the sun, the heat of the earth where we stand would hardly  be appreciably above the temperature of infinite space--perhaps some  200 or 300 degrees below zero. But there must have been a time when  there was sufficient internal heat to maintain the exterior at a warm  and indeed at a very hot temperature. Nor is there any bound to our  retrospect arising from the operation or intervention of any other  agent, so far as we know; consequently the hotter and the hotter grows  the surface the further and the further we look back. Nor can we stop  until, at an antiquity so great that I do not venture on any estimate  of the date, we discover that this earth must have consisted of  glowing hot material. Further and further we can look back, and we see  the rocks--or whatever other term we choose to apply to the then  ingredients of the earth's crust--in a white-hot and even in a molten  condition. Thus our argument has led us to the belief that time was  when this now solid globe of ours was a ball of white-hot fluid.    On the argument which I have here used there are just two remarks  which I particularly wish to make. Note in the first place, that our  reasoning is founded on the fact that the earth is at present, to some  extent, heated. It matters not whether this heat be much or little;  our argument would have been equally valid had the earth only  contained a single particle of its mass at a somewhat higher  temperature than the temperature of space. I am, of course, not  alluding in this to heat which can be generated by combustion. The  other point to which I refer is to remove an objection which may  possibly be urged against this line of reasoning. I have argued that  because the temperature is continually increasing as we look  backwards, that therefore a very great temperature must once have  prevailed. Without some explanation this argument is not logically  complete. There is, it is well known, the old paradox of the geometric  series; you may add a farthing to a halfpenny, and then a  half-farthing, and then a quarter-farthing, and then the eighth of a  farthing, followed by the sixteenth, and thirty-second, and so on,  halving the contribution each time. Now no matter how long you  continue this process, even if you went on with it for ever, and thus  made an infinite number of contributions, you would never accomplish  the task of raising the original halfpenny to the dignity of a penny.  An infinite number of quantities may therefore, as this illustration  shows, never succeed in attaining any considerable dimensions. Our  argument, however, with regard to the increase of heat as we look back  is the very opposite of this. It is the essence of a cooling body to  lose heat more rapidly in proportion as its temperature is greater.  Thus though the one-thousandth of a degree may be all the fall of  temperature that our earth now experiences in a twelvemonth, yet in  those glowing days when the surface was heated to incandescence, the  loss of heat per annum must have been immensely greater than it is  now. It therefore follows that the rate of gain of the earth's heat as  we look back must be of a different character to that of the geometric  series which I have just illustrated; for each addition to the  earth's heat, as we look back from year to year, must grow greater and  greater, and therefore there is here no shelter for a fallacy in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24263"],[0,"A Hundred Anecdotes of Animals (#10)"],[1,"is, that the greyhound and spaniel were both  so fond of hare-hunting, that they used often to go out coursing together,  without any person accompanying them; they were like the \"_sly couple_\",  of whose devotion to the chase an amusing instance has been already  recorded.    A traveller once brought a young hare to such a degree of frolicsome  familiarity, that it would run and jump about his sofa and bed; leap upon,  and pat him with its fore feet; or whilst he was reading, knock the book  out of his hands, as if to claim, like a fondled child, the exclusive  preference of his attention.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXI.    A Grateful Return.      A favourite house-dog, left to the care of its master's servants, while he  was himself away, would have been starved by them if it had not had  recourse to the kitchen of a friend of its master's, which in better days  it had occasionally visited. On the return of the master it enjoyed plenty  at home, and stood in no further need of the liberality it experienced;  but still it did not forget that hospitable kitchen where it had found a  resource in adversity. A few days after, the dog fell in with a duck,  which, as he found in no private pond, he probably concluded to be no  private property. He snatched up the duck in his teeth, carried it to the  kitchen where he had been so hospitably fed, laid it at the cook's feet,  with many polite movements of the tail, and then scampered off with much  seeming complacency at having given this testimony of his grateful sense  of favours.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXII.    Assisting the Aged.      A captain of cavalry in a French regiment mentions that a horse belonging  to his company, being from age unable to eat his hay or grind his oats,  was fed for two months by two horses on his right and left, who ate with  him. These two horses, drawing the hay out of the rack, chewed it, and  then put it before the old horse, and did the same with the oats, which he  was then able to eat.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXIII.    Oyster Opening.      A well-known traveller relates a circumstance concerning the orang-otang  in its wild state, which is indicative of very considerable powers, both  of reflection and invention. When the fruits on the mountains are  exhausted, they will frequently descend to the sea-coast, where they feed  on various species of shell-fish, but in particular on a large sort of  oyster, which commonly lies open on the shore. \"Fearful,\" he says, \"of  putting in their paws, lest the oyster should close and crush them, they  insert a stone as a wedge within the shell; this prevents it from closing,  and they then drag out their prey, and devour it at leisure.\"    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXIV.    Sonnini and his Cat.      M. Sonnini, when in Egypt, had an Angora cat, of which he was extremely  fond. It was entirely covered with long white silken hairs; its tail  formed a magnificent plume, which the animal elevated at pleasure over its  body. Not one spot, nor a single dark shade, tarnished the dazzling white  of its coat. Its nose and lips were of a delicate rose colour. Two large  eyes sparkled in its round head: one was of a light yellow, and the other  of a fine blue.    This beautiful animal had even more loveliness of manners than grace in  its attitude and movements. However ill any one used her, she never  attempted to advance her claws from their sheaths. Sensible to kindness,  she licked the hand which caressed, and even that which tormented her. In  Sonnini's solitary moments, she chiefly kept by his side; she interrupted  him often in the midst of his labours or meditations, by little caresses  extremely touching, and generally followed him in his walks. During his  absence she sought and called for him incessantly. She recognised his  voice at a distance, and seemed on each fresh meeting with him to feel  increased delight.    \"This animal,\" says Sonnini, \"was my principal amusement for several  years. How was the expression of attachment depicted upon her countenance!  How many times have her caresses made me forget my troubles, and consoled  me in my misfortunes! My beautiful and interesting companion, however, at  length perished. After several days of suffering, during which I never  forsook her, her eyes, constantly fixed on me, were at length  extinguished; and her loss rent my heart with sorrow.\"    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXV.    Division of Labour.      The Alpine marmots are said to act in concert in the collection of  materials for the construction of their habitations. Some of them, we are  told, cut the herbage, others collect it into heaps; a third set serve as  waggons to carry it to their holes; while others perform all the functions  of draught horses. The manner of the latter part of the curious process is  this. The animal who is to serve as the waggon lies down on his back, and  extending his four limbs as wide as he can, allows himself to be loaded  with hay; and those who are to be the draught horses trail him thus loaded  by the tail, taking care not to overset him. The task of thus serving as  the vehicle being evidently the least enviable part of the business, is  taken by every one of the party in turn.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXVI.    Crab Fishing.      The following is an instance of the extraordinary cunning manifested by  the Racoon. It is fond of crabs, and when in quest of them, will stand by  the side of a swamp, and hang its tail over into the water; the crabs,  mistaking it for food, are sure to lay hold of it; and as soon as the  beast feels them pinch, he pulls them out with a sudden jerk. He then  takes them to a little distance from the water's edge; and in devouring  them, is careful to get them crossways in his mouth, lest he should suffer  from their nippers.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXVII.    Rare Honesty.      A mastiff dog, who owed more to the bounty of a neighbour than to his  master, was once locked by mistake in the well-stored pantry of his  benefactor for a whole day, where milk, butter, bread, and meat, within  his reach, were in abundance. On the return of the servant to the pantry,  seeing the dog come out, and knowing the time he had been confined, she  trembled for the devastation which her negligence must have occasioned;  but on close examination, it was found that the honest creature had not  tasted of anything, although, on coming out, he fell on a bone that was  given to him, with all the voraciousness of hunger.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXVIII.    Of Two Evils Choosing the Least.      A French dog was taught by his master to execute various commissions, and  among others, to fetch him victuals from a restaurant in a basket. One  evening when the dog was returning to his master thus furnished, two other  dogs, attracted by the savoury smell issuing from the basket, determined  to attack him. The dog put his basket on the ground, and set himself  courageously against the first that advanced against him; but while he was  engaged with the one, the other ran to the basket, and began to help  himself. At length, seeing that there was no chance of beating both dogs,  and saving his master's dinner, he threw himself between his two  opponents, and without further ceremony, quickly despatched the remainder  of the victuals himself, and then returned to his master with the empty  basket.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXIX.    Snake Destroyers.    The Indian ichneumon, a small creature in appearance between the weasel  and the mangoose, is of infinite use to the natives from its inveterate  enmity to snakes, which would otherwise render every footstep of the  traveller dangerous. This diminutive creature, on seeing a snake ever so  large, will instantly dart on it, and seize it by the throat, provided he  finds himself in an open place, where he has an opportunity of running to  a certain herb, which he knows instinctively to be an antidote against the  poison of the bite, if he should happen to receive one. A gentleman  visiting the island of Ceylon saw the experiment tried in a closed room,  where the ichneumon, instead of attacking his enemy, did all in his power  to avoid him. On being carried out of the house, however, and laid near  his antagonist in the plantation, he immediately darted at the snake, and  soon destroyed it. It then suddenly disappeared for a few minutes, and  again returned, as soon as it had found the herb and ate it.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXX.    Monkey versus Snake.      The monkeys in India, knowing by instinct the malignity of the snakes, are  most vigilant in their destruction; they seize them when asleep by the  neck, and running to the nearest flat stone, grind down the head by a  strong friction on the surface, frequently looking at it, and grinning at  their progress. When convinced that the venomous fangs are destroyed, they  toss the reptiles to their young ones to play with, and seem to rejoice in  the destruction of their common enemy.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXXI.    Musical Mice.      \"One rainy winter evening, as I was alone in my chamber,\" relates an  American gentleman, \"I took up my flute and commenced playing. In a few  minutes my attention was directed to a mouse that I saw creeping from a  hole, and advancing to the chair in which I was sitting. I ceased playing,  and it ran precipitately back to its hole; I began again shortly  afterwards, and was much surprised to see it reappear, and take its old  position. The appearance of the little animal was truly delightful; it  couched itself on the floor, shut its eyes, and appeared in ecstasy; I  ceased playing, and it instantly disappeared again. This experiment I  repeated frequently with the same success, observing that it was always  differently affected, as the music varied from the slow and plaintive, to  the brisk or"]]]
