Therefore with  naive delight they welcomed one new invention after another, overlooking  its defects and considering themselves greatly blessed to have anything  as fine. Probably we, who are a thousand per cent better off than they,  do more grumbling over the tiny flaws in the mechanism of our lives than  they did over the mammoth ones.\"    \"Oh, come, Dad!\" protested Stephen. \"Aren't you putting it rather  strong?\"    \"Not a whit too strong, Steve,\" Mrs. Tolman interrupted. \"I believe we  are a fussy, pampered, ungrateful generation. It is rather pathetic,  too, to think it is we who now reap the benefits of all those perfected  ideas which our ancestors enjoyed only in their most primitive  beginnings. It seems hardly fair that Stephenson, for example, should  never have seen a modern Pullman.    \"He was spared something, wasn't he, Dad?\" chuckled Steve mischievously.    But Mr. Tolman did not heed the remark.    \"He had the vision,\" returned he softly, \"the joy of seeing the marvel  for the first time, imperfect as it was. Perhaps that was compensation  enough. It is the reward of every inventor. Remember it is no mean  privilege to stand upon the peak in Darien which Keats pictures.\"          CHAPTER V    STEVE LEARNS A SAD LESSON      No more disasters attended the journey and the travelers spun swiftly on  to Northampton, arriving at the old New England town late in the  afternoon. What a scene of activity the college campus presented! Bevies  of girls, hatless and in gay-colored sweaters, drifted hither and  thither, their laughter floating through the twilight with musical  clearness. Occasionally some newcomer would join a group and a shout of  welcome would hail her advent. Although Steve turned away from these  gushing greetings with masculine scorn nevertheless he was far more  interested in the novel picture than he would have been willing to  admit. More than once he caught his eyes following a slender figure in  white, across whose hair the sunset slanted, turning its blowing masses  to a glory of gold. With what ease and freedom the girl moved! And when,  as she passed, some one unceremoniously tossed her a ball and she caught  it with swift accuracy, his admiration was completely won.    Steve speculated as to whether she would prove to be as pretty at close  range as she was at a distance and decided not. Distance always brings  a glamor with it. However, pretty or not, there was no disputing that  she was a great favorite for every circle of students opened its magic  ring at her approach and greeted her with a noisy clamor of affection.  That she held herself with quiet reserve and was less demonstrative than  those about her did not appear to lessen in the least their regard for  her, and as Stephen watched he registered the wager that she was a  person of more common sense than most girls.    Until recently it had been his habit to condemn the entire sex; but of  late he had discovered that exceptions might be made to his rule. There  were girls in the world worth noticing, even some worth talking to; and  he felt certain that this attractive creature in white was one of them.  However, it was an absurdity to be thinking about her now and quite  beneath his dignity. But he meant sometime, when he could do so in  casual fashion, to find out from Doris who she was. He had a curiosity  to know what this person who looked as if she could row a boat, swim,  and play tennis well, was called. Doris was always raving about her  roommate, Jane Harden. She had said so much about her that he fairly  detested the sound of her name. Now if only Jane Harden were a girl like  this one, there would be some reason and excuse for being enthusiastic  over her. To have this guest brought home to spend the Christmas  holidays would be a pleasure to look forward to. How well she would  skate and how gracefully; and how pretty she would be, especially if  she had her hat off as she had now!    It was Doris who interrupted his reverie with the words:    \"I hate to have you dear people go but I suppose you will have to. But  do just wait long enough for me to see if I can't find Jane somewhere.  She is crazy to meet my family and will scold me to death if I let you  get away.\"    \"I am afraid we can't stay but a moment or two, dear,\" objected Mrs.  Tolman. \"It is growing late, you know, and we must get to the hotel  before it is too dark.\"    \"But I won't delay you a second, Mother--truly, I won't. I do want you  to meet Jane. I'll ask the girls if they have seen her anywhere.\"    \"If you get out into that mob they'll fall all over you and you'll never  get back,\" growled Steve, who was beginning to feel hungry and was none  too graciously inclined toward the prospective stranger.    \"Oh, yes, I will,\" laughed Doris as she darted away.    In spite of this sanguine prediction, however, she did not return as  promptly as she had promised, and Mr. Tolman began to fidget uneasily.    \"We really ought to be starting on,\" he said at last. \"Where is that  child?\"    \"I knew she'd stop to admire everybody's new hat and talk over the whole  summer,\" grumbled Steve scornfully.    \"You are thinking of your dinner, son,\" his mother put in playfully.    \"You bet I am! I'm hungry as a bear.\"    A pause followed in which visions of a big beefsteak with crisply fried  potatoes blotted out every other picture from Steve's mind.    \"Perhaps we ought not to have waited,\" he heard his mother murmur. \"But  I had not the heart to disappoint Doris. She is so fond of Jane and has  talked so much about her! I had no idea it would take her so long to--\"    \"Here she comes!\" Mr. Tolman broke in.    Stephen glanced up. Yes, there was Doris hurrying across the grass and  beside her, walking with the same free and buoyant swing, was the girl  of the golden hair,--Jane Harden.    With the same reserve and yet without a shadow of self-consciousness she  came forward and in acknowledgment of the hurried introductions extended  her hand with a grave smile of welcome; but both smile and gesture  carried with them a sincerity very appealing. When she greeted Steve he  flushed at being addressed as _Mr. Tolman_ and mentally rose six inches  in his boots. Yes, she was decidedly pretty, far prettier than she had  been in the distance even. In all his life he had never seen a more  attractive girl.    \"I hope, Jane, that you are coming home with Doris for a visit sometime  when your own family can spare you,\" he heard his mother say. \"We all  should like to have you.\"    \"And I should like to come,\" was the simple and direct answer.    \"Do plan on it then. Come any time that you can arrange to. We should  very much enjoy having you, shouldn't we, Stephen?\"    Stephen, so suddenly appealed to, turned very red and answered \"Yes\" in  a tone that seemed to come gruffly from way down inside his chest, and  then to the sound of hasty farewells the car started and shot out into  the village street and the campus with its rainbow-hued occupants was  lost to sight.    \"A charming girl, isn't she?\" Mrs. Tolman said to her husband. \"So  natural and unaffected! Doris says that she is quite the idol of the  college and bids fair to be class president. I wish Doris would bring  her home for the holidays.\"    Inwardly Steve echoed the sentiment but outwardly he preserved silence.  He was too human a boy to dwell long on thoughts of any girl and soon  Jane Harden was quite forgotten in the satisfaction of a steaming dinner  and a comfortable bed, and the fairy journey of the next day when amid a  splendor of crimson and gold the glories of Jacob's Ladder and the  Mohawk Trail stretched before his eyes.    Within the week the big red car headed for Coventry and without a mishap  rolled into the familiar main street of the town which never had seemed  dearer than after the interval of absence. As the automobile sped past,  friendly faces nodded from the sidewalks and hands were waved in  greeting. Presently his mother called from the tonneau:    \"Isn't that the Taylors' car, Henry, coming toward us? If it is do stop,  for I want to speak to them.\"    Mr. Tolman nodded and slowed down the engine, at the same time putting  out his hand to bring the on-coming car to a standstill. Yes, there were  the Taylors, and on the front seat beside the chauffeur sat \"But,\" the  friend who had been most influential in coaxing Stephen into the dilemma  of the past fortnight. It was Bud, Steve could not forget, who had been  the first to drop out of the car when trouble had befallen and who had  led the other boys off on foot with him to Torrington. The memory of his  chum's treacherous conduct still rankled in Steve's mind. He had not  spoken to him since. But now here the two boys were face to face and  unless they were to betray to their parents that something was wrong  they must meet with at least a semblance of cordiality. The question was  which of them should be the first to make the advance.    Twice Bud cleared his throat and appeared to be on the verge of uttering  a greeting when he encountered Stephen's scowl and lost courage to call  the customary: \"Ah, there, Stevie!\"    And Stephen, feeling that right was on his side and being too proud to  open the conversation, could not bring himself to say: \"Hi, Bud!\" as he  always did.    As a result the schoolmates simply glared at each other.    Fortunately their elders were too much occupied with friendly gossip to  notice them and it was not until the talk shifted abruptly into a  channel that appalled both boys that their glance met with the sympathy  of common danger.    It was Bud's mother from whose lips the terrifying words innocently  fell.    \"Havens ill and you in New York Wednesday!\" she exclaimed incredulously.  \"But I certainly thought I saw your car turning into the gate that very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22248"],[0,"The Indian Fairy Book: From the Original Legends (#10)"],[1,"on all sides, but she seemed to be quite happy, and  said to them, \"It is my choice and you will see in the end who has acted  the wisest.\"    They made a special mock of the walking-staff, and scarcely an hour in  the day passed that they had not some disparaging reference to it. Among  themselves they spoke of Osseo of the walking-staff, in derision, as the  owner of the big woods, or the great timber-man.    \"True,\" said Oweenee, \"it is but a simple stick; but as it supports the  steps of my husband, it is more precious to me than all the forests of  the north.\"    A time came when the sisters, and their husbands, and their parents were  all invited to a feast. As the distance was considerable, they doubted  whether Osseo, so aged and feeble, would be able to undertake the  journey; but in spite of their friendly doubts, he joined them, and set  out with a good heart.    As they walked along the path they could not help pitying their young  and handsome sister who had such an unsuitable mate. She, however,  smiled upon Osseo, and kept with him by the way the same as if he had  been the comeliest bridegroom in all the company. Osseo often stopped  and gazed upward; but they could perceive nothing in the direction in  which he looked, unless it was the faint glimmering of the evening star.  They heard him muttering to himself as they went along, and one of the  elder sisters caught the words, \"Pity me, my father!\"    \"Poor old man,\" said she; \"he is talking to his father. What a pity it  is that he would not fall and break his neck, that our sister might have  a young husband.\"    Presently as they came to a great rock where Osseo had been used to  breathe his morning and his evening prayer, the star emitted a brighter  ray, which shone directly in his face. Osseo, with a sharp cry, fell  trembling to the earth, where the others would have left him, but his  good wife raised him up, and he sprang forward on the path, and with  steps light as the reindeer he led the party, no longer decrepid and  infirm, but a beautiful young man. On turning around to look for his  wife, behold she had become changed, at the same moment, into an aged  and feeble woman, bent almost double, and walking with the staff which  he had cast aside.    Osseo immediately joined her, and with looks of fondness and the  tenderest regard, bestowed on her every endearing attention, and  constantly addressed her by the term of ne-ne-moosh-a, or my sweetheart.    As they walked along, whenever they were not gazing fondly in each  other's face, they bent their looks on heaven, and a light, as if of  far-off stars, was in their eyes.    On arriving at the lodge of the hunter with whom they were to feast,  they found the banquet ready, and as soon as their entertainer had  finished his harangue--in which he told them his feasting was in honor  of the Evening or Woman's Star--they began to partake of the portion  dealt out, according to age and character, to each one of the guests.  The food was very delicious, and they were all happy but Osseo, who  looked at his wife, and then gazed upward, as if he was looking into the  substance of the sky. Sounds were soon heard, as if from far-off voices  in the air, and they became plainer and plainer, till he could clearly  distinguish some of the words.    \"My son, my son,\" said the voice; \"I have seen your afflictions, and  pity your wants. I come to call you away from a scene that is stained  with blood and tears. The earth is full of sorrows. Wicked spirits, the  enemies of mankind, walk abroad, and lie in wait to ensnare the children  of the sky. Every night they are lifting their voices to the Power of  Evil, and every day they make themselves busy in casting mischief in the  hunter's path. You have long been their victim, but you shall be their  victim no more. The spell you were under is broken. Your evil genius is  overcome. I have cast him down by my superior strength, and it is this  strength I now exert for your happiness. Ascend, my son; ascend into the  skies, and partake of the feast I have prepared for you in the stars,  and bring with you those you love.    \"The food set before you is enchanted and blessed. Fear not to partake  of it. It is endowed with magic power to give immortality to mortals,  and to change men to spirits. Your bowls and kettles shall no longer be  wood and earth. The one shall become silver, and the other pure gold.  They shall shine like fire, and glisten like the most beautiful scarlet.  Every female shall also change her state and looks, and no longer be  doomed to laborious tasks. She shall put on the beauty of the  star-light, and become a shining bird of the air. She shall dance, and  not work. She shall sing, and not cry.    \"My beams,\" continued the voice, \"shine faintly on your lodge, but they  have power to transform it into the lightness of the skies, and decorate  it with the colors of the clouds. Come, Osseo, my son, and dwell no  longer on earth. Think strongly on my words, and look steadfastly at my  beams. My power is now at its height. Doubt not, delay not. It is the  voice of the Spirit of the Stars that calls you away to happiness and  celestial rest.\"    The words were intelligible to Osseo, but his companions thought them  some far-off sounds of music, or birds singing in the woods. Very soon  the lodge began to shake and tremble, and they felt it rising into the  air. It was too late to run out, for they were already as high as the  tops of the trees. Osseo looked around him as the lodge passed through  the topmost boughs, and behold! their wooden dishes were changed into  shells of a scarlet color, the poles of the lodge to glittering rods of  silver, and the bark that covered them into the gorgeous wings of  insects.    A moment more and his brothers and sisters, and their parents and  friends, were transformed into birds of various plumage. Some were jays,  some partridges and pigeons, and others gay singing birds, who hopped  about, displaying their many-colored feathers, and singing songs of  cheerful note.    But his wife, Oweenee, still kept her earthly garb, and exhibited all  the indications of extreme old age. He again cast his eyes in the  direction of the clouds, and uttered the peculiar cry which had given  him the victory at the rock. In a moment the youth and beauty of his  wife returned; her dingy garments assumed the shining appearance of  green silk, and her staff was changed into a silver feather.    The lodge again shook and trembled, for they were now passing through  the uppermost clouds, and they immediately after found themselves in the  Evening Star, the residence of Osseo's father.    \"My son,\" said the old man, \"hang that cage of birds which you have  brought along in your hand at the door, and I will inform you why you  and your wife have been sent for.\"    Osseo obeyed, and then took his seat in the lodge.    \"Pity was shown to you,\" resumed the King of the Star, \"on account of  the contempt of your wife's sister, who laughed at her ill fortune, and  ridiculed you while you were under the power of that wicked spirit whom  you overcame at the rock. That spirit lives in the next lodge, being the  small star you see on the left of mine, and he has always felt envious  of my family because we had greater power, and especially that we had  committed to us the care of the female world. He failed in many attempts  to destroy your brothers and sisters-in-law, but succeeded at last in  transforming yourself and your wife into decrepid old persons. You must  be careful and not let the light of his beams fall on you, while you are  here, for therein lies the power of his enchantment. A ray of light is  the bow and arrow he uses.\"    Osseo lived happy and contented in the parental lodge, and in due time  his wife presented him with a son, who grew up rapidly, and in the very  likeness of Osseo himself. He was very quick and ready in learning  every thing that was done in his grandfather's dominions, but he wished  also to learn the art of hunting, for he had heard that this was a  favorite pursuit below. To gratify him, his father made him a bow and  arrows, and he then let the birds out of the cage that he might practice  in shooting. In this pastime he soon became expert, and the very first  day he brought down a bird; but when he went to pick it up, to his  amazement it was a beautiful young woman, with the arrow sticking in her  breast. It was one of his younger aunts.    The moment her blood fell upon the surface of that pure and spotless  planet, the charm was dissolved. The boy immediately found himself  sinking, although he was partly upheld by something like wings until he  passed through the lower clouds, and he then suddenly dropped upon a  high, breezy island in a large lake. He was pleased, on looking up, to  see all his aunts and uncles following him in the form of birds, and he  soon discovered the silver lodge, with his father and mother,  descending, with its waving tassels fluttering like so many insects'  gilded wings. It rested on the loftiest cliffs of the island, and there  they fixed their residence. They all resumed their natural shapes, but  they were diminished to the size of fairies; and as a mark of homage to  the King of the Evening Star, they never failed on every pleasant  evening during the summer season to join hands and dance upon the top of  the rocks. These rocks were quickly observed by the Indians to be  covered, in moonlight evenings, with a larger sort of Ininees, or little  men, and were called Mish-in-e-mok-in-ok-ong, or Little Spirits, and the  island is named from them to this day.    Their shining lodge can be seen in the summer evenings, when the moon  beams strongly on the pinnacles of the rocks; and the fishermen who go  near those high cliffs at night, have even heard the voices of the happy  little dancers. And Osseo and his wife, as fondly attached to each other  as"]]]
