In the street behind  the block of flats was a mews, consisting of about a dozen shut-up  stables, all of which were rented by a taxicab company, and now used as a  garage.    If the murder was committed in the flat, it was by this way the body  would have been carried to the mews, and here, too, a car would attract  little attention. Inquiries made amongst employees of the cab company,  some of whom occupied little rooms above their garages, elicited the  important information that the car had been seen in the mews on the night  of the murder--a fact, it seemed, which had been overlooked in the  preliminary police investigations.    The car was a two-seater Daimler with a yellow body and a hood. This was  an exact description of Thornton Lyne's machine which had been found near  the place where his body was discovered. The hood of the car was up when  it was seen in the mews and the time apparently was between ten and  eleven on the night of the murder. But though he pursued the most  diligent inquiries, Tarling failed to discover any human being who had  either recognised Lyne or observed the car arrive or depart.    The hall porter of the flats, on being interviewed, was very emphatic  that nobody had come into the building by the main entrance between the  hours of ten and half-past. It was possible, he admitted, that they could  have come between half-past ten and a quarter to eleven because he had  gone to his \"office,\" which proved to be a stuffy little place under the  stairs, to change from his uniform into his private clothes before going  home. He was in the habit of locking the front door at eleven o'clock.  Tenants of the mansions had pass-keys to the main door, and of all that  happened after eleven he would be ignorant. He admitted that he may have  gone a little before eleven that night, but even as to this he was not  prepared to swear.    \"In fact,\" said Whiteside afterwards, \"his evidence would lead nowhere.  At the very hour when somebody might have come into the flat--that is to  say, between half-past ten and a quarter to eleven--he admits he was not  on duty.\"    Tarling nodded. He had made a diligent search of the floor of the  basement corridor through the store-room into the courtyard, but had  found no trace of blood. Nor did he expect to find any such trace, since  it was clear that, if the murder had been committed in the flat and the  night-dress which was wound about the dead man's body was Odette Rider's,  there would be no bleeding.    \"Of one thing I am satisfied,\" he said; \"if Odette Rider committed this  murder she had an accomplice. It was impossible that she could have  carried or dragged this man into the open and put him into the car,  carried him again from the car and laid him on the grass.\"    \"The daffodils puzzle me,\" said Whiteside. \"Why should he be found with  daffodils on his chest? And why, if he was murdered here, should she  trouble to pay that tribute of her respect?\"    Tarling shook his head. He was nearer a solution to the latter mystery  than either of them knew.    His search of the flat completed, he drove to Hyde Park and, guided by  Whiteside, made his way to the spot where the body was found. It was on  a gravelled sidewalk, nearer to the grass than to the road, and Whiteside  described the position of the body. Tarling looked round, and suddenly  uttered an exclamation.    \"I wonder,\" he said, pointing to a flower-bed.    Whiteside stared, then laughed.    \"That curious,\" he said. \"We seem to see nothing but daffodils in this  murder!\"    The big bed to which Tarling walked was smothered with great feathery  bells that danced and swayed in the light spring breezes.    \"Humph!\" said Tarling. \"Do you know anything about daffodils, Whiteside?\"    Whiteside shook his head with a laugh.    \"All daffodils are daffodils to me. Is there any difference in them?  I suppose there must be.\"    Tarling nodded.    \"These are known as Golden Spurs,\" he said, \"a kind which is very common  in England. The daffodils in Miss Rider's flat are the variety known as  the Emperor.\"    \"Well?\" said Whiteside.    \"Well,\" said the other slowly, \"the daffodils I saw this morning which  were found on Lyne's chest were Golden Spurs.\"    He knelt down by the side of the bed and began pushing aside the stems,  examining the ground carefully.    \"Here you are,\" he said.    He pointed to a dozen jagged stems.    \"That is where the daffodils were plucked, I'd like to swear to that.  Look, they were all pulled together by one hand. Somebody leaned over and  pulled a handful.\"    Whiteside looked dubious.    \"Mischievous boys sometimes do these things.\"    \"Only in single stalks,\" said Tarling, \"and the regular flower thieves  are careful to steal from various parts of the bed so that the loss  should not be reported by the Park gardeners.\"    \"Then you suggest--\"    \"I suggest that whoever killed Thornton Lyne found it convenient, for  some reason best known to himself or herself, to ornament the body as it  was found, and the flowers were got from here.\"    \"Not from the girl's flat at all?\"    \"I'm sure of that,\" replied Tarling emphatically. \"In fact, I knew that  this morning when I'd seen the daffodils which you had taken to Scotland  Yard.\"    Whiteside scratched his nose in perplexity.    \"The further this case goes, the more puzzled I am,\" he said. \"Here is  a man, a wealthy man, who has apparently no bitter enemies, discovered  dead in Hyde Park, with a woman's silk night-dress wound round his  chest, with list slippers on his feet, and a Chinese inscription in his  pocket--and further, to puzzle the police, a bunch of daffodils on the  chest. That was a woman's act, Mr. Tarling,\" he said suddenly.    Tarling started. \"How do you mean?\" he asked.    \"It was a woman's act to put flowers on the man,\" said Whiteside quietly.  \"Those daffodils tell me of pity and compassion, and perhaps repentance.\"    A slow smile dawned on Tarling's face.    \"My dear Whiteside,\" he said, \"you are getting sentimental! And here,\" he  added, looking up, \"attracted to the spot, is a gentleman I seem to be  always meeting--Mr. Milburgh, I think.\"    Milburgh had stopped at the sight of the detective, and looked as if he  would have been glad to have faded away unobserved. But Tarling had seen  him, and Milburgh came forward with his curious little shuffling walk, a  set smile on his face, the same worried look in his eyes, which Tarling  had seen once before.    \"Good morning, gentlemen,\" he said, with a flourish of his top hat.  \"I suppose, Mr. Tarling, nothing has been discovered?\"    \"At any rate, I didn't expect to discover _you_ here this morning!\"  smiled Tarling. \"I thought you were busy at the Stores.\"    Milburgh shifted uneasily.    \"The place has a fascination for me,\" he said huskily, \"I--I can't keep  away from it.\"    He dropped his eyes before Tarling's keen gaze and repeated the question.    \"Is there any fresh news?\"    \"I ought to ask you that,\" said Tarling quietly.    The other looked up.    \"You mean Miss Rider?\" he asked. \"No, sir, nothing has been found to her  detriment and I cannot trace her present address, although I have pursued  the most diligent inquiries. It is very upsetting.\"    There was a new emphasis in his voice. Tarling remembered that when Lyne  had spoken to Milburgh before, and had suggested that the girl had been  guilty of some act of predation, Milburgh had been quick to deny the  possibility. Now his manner was hostile to the girl--indefinitely so, but  sufficiently marked for Tarling to notice it.    \"Do you think that Miss Rider had any reason for running away?\" asked the  detective.    Milburgh shrugged his shoulders.    \"In this world,\" he said unctuously, \"one is constantly being deceived by  people in whom one has put one's trust.\"    \"In other words, you suspect Miss Rider of robbing the firm?\"    Up went Mr. Milburgh's plump hands.    \"I would not say that,\" he said. \"I would not accuse a young woman of  such an act of treachery to her employers, and I distinctly refuse to  make any charges until the auditors have completed their work. There is  no doubt,\" he added carefully, \"that Miss Rider had the handling of large  sums of money, and she of all people in the business, and particularly in  the cashier's department would have been able to rob the firm without the  knowledge of either myself or poor Mr. Lyne. This, of course, is  confidential.\" He laid one hand appealingly on Tarling's arm, and that  worthy nodded.    \"Have you any idea where she would be?\"    Again Milburgh shook his head.    \"The only thing--\" he hesitated and looked into Tarling's eyes.    \"Well?\" asked the detective impatiently.    \"There is a suggestion, of course, that she may have gone abroad. I do  not offer that suggestion, only I know that she spoke French very well  and that she had been to the Continent before.\"    Tarling stroked his chin thoughtfully.    \"To the Continent, eh?\" he said softly. \"Well, in that case I shall  search the Continent; for on one thing I am determined, and that is to  find Odette Rider,\" and, beckoning to his companion, he turned on his  heel and left the obsequious Mr. Milburgh staring after him.          CHAPTER X    THE WOMAN AT ASHFORD      Tarling went back to his lodgings that afternoon, a puzzled and baffled  man. Ling Chu, his impassive Chinese servant, had observed those symptoms  of perplexity before, but now there was something new in his master's  demeanour--a kind of curt irritation, an anxiety which in the Hunter of  Men had not been observed before.    The Chinaman went silently about the business of preparing his chief's  tea and made no reference to the tragedy or to any of its details. He had  set the table by the side of the bed, and was gliding from the room in  that cat-like way of his when Tarling"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20915"],[0,"Field's Chromatography (#10)"],[1,"WHITE, OR OXYCHLORIDE OF LEAD    Is a mixture of chloride and oxide of lead, formed by precipitating a  solution of chloride of lead with soda, potash, lime, or baryta, in the  caustic or hydrated state. It would appear that when the oxychloride is  used as a paint, the oxide contained in it gives rise to an oleate of  lead, and, in consequence of this saponaceous matter, is capable of  spreading over an extended surface. The product has been described as  possessing properties which are superior to those of white lead,  inasmuch as it does not so readily blacken as the latter body. Dr. Ure,  however, found that water removes the chloride of lead from the paint  compounded of this article, and, consequently, that it is not so  effectual as the carbonate. As an artist's pigment, a partially soluble  compound of lead can decidedly not be eligible.    8. ROMAN WHITE    Is of the purest white colour, and differs only from blanc d'argent in  the warm flesh tint of the external surface of the large square masses  in which it is commonly prepared.    Besides the foregoing, there are other white leads, generally foreign,  cheaper, and adulterated. Many of these are mixed with a small quantity  of charcoal, indigo, or Prussian blue, so that the dead yellowish shade  which they present may be enlivened to a brighter hue. Among them may be  named--    9. CERUSE.    A French variety, not necessarily, but not unfrequently, mixed with  different chalky earths in various proportions; and the following  Belgian kinds:    10. DUTCH WHITE,    Containing three fourths of sulphate of baryta.    11. HAMBURGH WHITE.    A mixture of two parts of heavy spar and one of the plumbous compound.    12. KREMSER WHITE,    Differing from the rest in being unadulterated.    13. VENETIAN WHITE    Composed of heavy spar and the carbonate in equal proportions.      ZINC WHITES.    14. CHINESE WHITE.    The introduction, in 1834, of this peculiar preparation of oxide of zinc  has proved an incalculable boon to water-colour painters, who formerly  had no white which combined perfect permanency with good body in  working. Its invention obviated the necessity for using white lead, a  pigment which, though it may be employed with comparative safety in oil,  is quite unfitted for water. Since the period of its production, Chinese  white has been generally preferred by water-colour artists, as being the  most eligible in their peculiar department. Previous to that period, the  complaints of whites changing were of constant occurrence; but in no  instance has any picture, in which this white has been used, suffered  from its employment. To the colour of oxide of zinc, sulphuretted  hydrogen is altogether harmless; sulphide of zinc being itself white.  The variety under notice works and washes well, possesses no pasty or  clogging properties, and is prepared beautifully white. Moreover, it has  the desirable quality of dense body; so much so, that, as the painter  works, his effects remain unaltered by the drying of the colour. It may  likewise be safely mixed with all other pigments, the following blending  very satisfactorily with the white for opaque lights--cadmium yellow,  orange, and red; gamboge; aureolin; yellow ochre; vermilion; and light  red. Without the artistic drawbacks of constant white or the chemical  defects of white lead, and retaining the advantages of both, Chinese  white cannot but be considered as a most important addition. It is a  matter of regret that this pigment is not equally efficacious in oil.    15. ZINC WHITE    Is either the anhydrous oxide, the hydrate oxide, or hydrated basic  carbonate of zinc. It varies in opacity and colour according to the mode  of manufacture, and the purity of the compound, but may always be relied  upon as permanent. The whiteness of the best samples rivals that of  white lead, and it is not tarnished like the latter by sulphurous  vapours. In opacity it never equals white lead, and might perhaps serve  advantageously as a glaze over that pigment, either alone or compounded  with other colours; as well as act as a medium of interposition between  white lead and those colours which are injured by it, such as gamboge,  crimson lake, &c. When duly and skilfully prepared the colour and body  of this pigment are sufficient to qualify it for a general use upon the  palette in oil: in water it has been superseded by Chinese white.    Occasionally, starch, chalk, white clay, and carbonate of baryta, are  employed as adulterants; none of which, however, are inimical to  stability.    As a pigment, zinc white may be said to be innoxious. As oxide of zinc  does not readily form a saponaceous compound with fats or oil like white  lead, the paint prepared with it and ordinary linseed oil does not dry  or harden so rapidly. For the purpose of causing it to be more  siccative, the oil was boiled with a large quantity of litharge, but by  this method the white was liable to tarnish on meeting with foul air.  Instead of litharge, experiments have led to the choice of salts of  zinc, such as the chloride or sulphate, a small percentage of which, on  being mixed with the oil or oxide, confers upon it the property of  rapidly hardening. The same result is attained by employing an oil,  dried by boiling with about five per cent of peroxide of manganese. In  either case, a paint retaining its white colour permanently is produced.  These agents might, with advantage, be more generally used in the place  of litharge for rendering oils siccative. Many pigments which are not  naturally affected by sulphurous emanations are apt to suffer if mixed  with an oil made drying by means of lead.           *       *       *       *       *    16. _Cadmium White._    Provided the metal be freed from iron, which we have commonly found to  be more or less present, a white of considerable beauty may be produced;  either directly by precipitation as hydrated oxide or carbonate, or  indirectly by exposing the brown anhydrous oxide to air and light--the  latter mode yielding a product of greater opacity. However prepared,  cadmium white is deficient in body, and apt to assume a yellow tint on  meeting with an impure atmosphere.    17. _Pearl White_    Is an insoluble basic nitrate of bismuth, a pearly white powder of loose  texture, turning grey on exposure, and blackened by sulphuretted  hydrogen. It is chiefly used as a cosmetic, but is said to injure the  skin, rendering it yellow and leather-like; and it has been known to  cause a spasmodic trembling of the face, ending in paralysis.    Another preparation under this name, and now obsolete we believe as a  pigment, was obtained from mother-of-pearl. It is described as  exquisitely white, and of good body in water, but of little force in oil  or varnish.    18. _Tin White_    Resembles zinc white in some respects, but has less body and colour, and  dries badly. According to its composition, it is liable to turn either  black or a dull yellow in contact with sulphurous vapours.    19. _White Chalk_    Is a well-known native carbonate of lime, employed by the artist only as  a crayon, or for tracing his designs, for which purpose it is sawed into  suitable lengths. White crayons and tracing chalks, to be good, must  work and cut free from grit. From this material are prepared whitening  and lime, which form the bases of many cheap pigments and colours, used  in distemper, paper-staining, &c.    Besides those mentioned, there are other metallic whites varying in  beauty and opacity, such as those of mercury, arsenic, and antimony; but  none of them are of any value or reputation in painting, on account of  their great disposition to change of colour, whether by light or foul  air, both in water and oil.    There are also other terrene whites, under equivocal names, among which  are Morat or Modan white, Spanish white, Troys or Troy white, Rouen  white, China white, and Satin white; the latter being a sulphate of lime  and alumina, which dries with a glossy surface. The common oyster-shell  contains a soft white in its thick part, and there is the white of  egg-shells. There is, too, an endless variety of native earths, in  addition to those prepared by art. The whole of them, however, are  destitute of body in oil; and several, owing to their alkaline nature,  are injurious to many colours in water, as well as to all colours which  cannot be employed in fresco.    Among the infinitude of white substances, the artist finds that there  are but three white pigments--those of lead, zinc, and baryta. The first  possesses the greatest opacity, while the second and third are most  durable. The last, however, has so many objectionable qualities, that  the number of eligible whites, may almost be said to be two--lead and  zinc. Of these, the former is blackened by foul air, and in oil, the  latter is wanting in body. In fact, there is but one white pigment which  approaches perfection--Chinese white; and this is only a water-colour.          CHAPTER VIII.    ON THE PRIMARY, YELLOW.      Yellow is the first of the primary or simple colours, nearest in  relation to, and partaking most of the nature of, the neutral white; it  is accordingly a most advancing colour, of great power in reflecting  light. Compounded with the primary _red_, it constitutes the secondary  _orange_, as well as its relatives, scarlet, and other warm colours.    It is the archeus, or prime colour, of the tertiary _citrine_;  characterises in like manner the endless number of semi-neutral colours  called _brown_, and enters largely into the complex hues termed buff,  bay, tawny, tan, dan, dun, drab, chestnut, roan, sorrel, hazel, auburn,  isabela, fawn, feuillemort, &c. Yellow is naturally associated with red  in transient and prismatic colours, and is the principal power with it  in representing the effects of warmth, heat, and fire. Combined with the  primary _blue_, yellow furnishes all the variety of the secondary"]]]
