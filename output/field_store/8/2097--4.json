[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2131"],[0,"An Account of Egypt (#10)"],[1,"the whole country is full of physicians, for some profess themselves  to be physicians of the eyes, others of the head, others of the teeth,  others of the affections of the stomach, and others of the more obscure  ailments.    Their fashions of mourning and of burial are these:--Whenever any  household has lost a man who is of any regard amongst them, the whole  number of women of that house forthwith plaster over their heads or even  their faces with mud. Then leaving the corpse within the house they go  themselves to and fro about the city and beat themselves, with their  garments bound up by a girdle and their breasts exposed, and with them  go all the women who are related to the dead man, and on the other side  the men beat themselves, they too having their garments bound up by a  girdle; and when they have done this, they then convey the body to  the embalming. In this occupation certain persons employ themselves  regularly and inherit this as a craft. These, whenever a corpse is  conveyed to them, show to those who brought it wooden models of corpses  made like reality by painting, and the best of the ways of embalming  they say is that of him whose name I think it impiety to mention when  speaking of a matter of such a kind; the second which they show is  less good than this and also less expensive; and the third is the least  expensive of all. Having told them about this, they inquire of them in  which way they desire the corpse of their friend to be prepared. Then  they after they have agreed for a certain price depart out of the way,  and the others being left behind in the buildings embalm according to  the best of these ways thus:--First with the crooked iron tool they draw  out the brain through the nostrils, extracting it partly thus and partly  by pouring in drugs; and after this with a sharp stone of Ethiopia they  make a cut along the side and take out the whole contents of the belly,  and when they have cleared out the cavity and cleansed it with palm-wine  they cleanse it again with spices pounded up: then they fill the belly  with pure myrrh pounded up and with cassia and other spices except  frankincense, and sew it together again. Having so done they keep it for  embalming covered up in natron for seventy days, but for a longer time  than this it is not permitted to embalm it; and when the seventy days  are past, they wash the corpse and roll its whole body up in fine linen  cut into bands, smearing these beneath with gum, which the Egyptians use  generally instead of glue. Then the kinsfolk receive it from them and  have a wooden figure made in the shape of a man, and when they have had  this made they enclose the corpse, and having shut it up within, they  store it then in a sepulchral chamber, setting it to stand upright  against the wall. Thus they deal with the corpses which are prepared in  the most costly way; but for those who desire the middle way and wish  to avoid great cost they prepare the corpse as follows:--having filled  their syringes with the oil which is got from cedar-wood, with this they  forthwith fill the belly of the corpse, and this they do without having  either cut it open or taken out the bowels, but they inject the oil by  the breech, and having stopped the drench from returning back they keep  it then the appointed number of days for embalming, and on the last  of the days they let the cedar oil come out from the belly, which they  before put in; and it has such power that it brings out with it the  bowels and interior organs of the body dissolved; and the natron  dissolves the flesh, so that there is left of the corpse only the skin  and the bones. When they have done this they give back the corpse at  once in that condition without working upon it any more. The third kind  of embalming, by which are prepared the bodies of those who have less  means, is as follows:--they cleanse out the belly with a purge and then  keep the body for embalming during the seventy days, and at once after  that they give it back to the bringers to carry away. The wives of men  of rank when they die are not given at once to be embalmed, nor such  women as are very beautiful or of greater regard than others, but on  the third or fourth day after their death (and not before) they are  delivered to the embalmers. They do so about this matter in order that  the embalmers may not abuse their women, for they say that one of them  was taken once doing so to the corpse of a woman lately dead, and his  fellow-craftsman gave information. Whenever any one, either of the  Egyptians themselves or of strangers, is found to have been carried off  by a crocodile or brought to his death by the river itself, the people  of any city by which he may have been cast up on land must embalm him  and lay him out in the fairest way they can and bury him in a sacred  burial-place, nor may any of his relations or friends besides touch him,  but the priests of the Nile themselves handle the corpse and bury it as  that of one who was something more than man.    Hellenic usages they will by no means follow, and to speak generally  they follow those of no other men whatever. This rule is observed by  most of the Egyptians; but there is a large city named Chemmis in the  Theban district near Neapolis, and in this city there is a temple of  Perseus the son of Danae which is of a square shape, and round it grow  date-palms: the gateway of the temple is built of stone and of very  great size, and at the entrance of it stand two great statues of stone.  Within this enclosure is a temple-house and in it stands an image of  Perseus. These people of Chemmis say that Perseus is wont often to  appear in their land and often within the temple, and that a sandal  which has been worn by him is found sometimes, being in length two  cubits, and whenever this appears all Egypt prospers. This they say, and  they do in honour of Perseus after Hellenic fashion thus,--they hold an  athletic contest, which includes the whole list of games, and they offer  in prizes cattle and cloaks and skins: and when I inquired why to them  alone Perseus was wont to appear, and wherefore they were separated from  all the other Egyptians in that they held an athletic contest, they said  that Perseus had been born of their city, for Danaos and Lynkeus were  men of Chemmis and had sailed to Hellas, and from them they traced a  descent and came down to Perseus: and they told me that he had come to  Egypt for the reason which the Hellenes also say, namely to bring from  Libya the Gorgon's head, and had then visited them also and recognised  all his kinsfolk, and they said that he had well learnt the name of  Chemmis before he came to Egypt, since he had heard it from his mother,  and that they celebrated an athletic contest for him by his own command.    All these are customs practised by the Egyptians who dwell above the  fens: and those who are settled in the fenland have the same customs for  the most part as the other Egyptians, both in other matters and also  in that they live each with one wife only, as do the Hellenes; but  for economy in respect of food they have invented these things  besides:--when the river has become full and the plains have been  flooded, there grow in the water great numbers of lilies, which the  Egyptians call _lotos_; these they cut with a sickle and dry in the  sun, and then they pound that which grows in the middle of the lotos and  which is like the head of a poppy, and they make of it loaves baked  with fire. The root also of this lotos is edible and has a rather sweet  taste: it is round in shape and about the size of an apple. There are  other lilies too, in flower resembling roses, which also grow in  the river, and from them the fruit is produced in a separate vessel  springing from the root by the side of the plant itself, and very  nearly resembles a wasp's comb: in this there grow edible seeds in great  numbers of the size of an olive-stone, and they are eaten either fresh  or dried. Besides this they pull up from the fens the papyrus which  grows every year, and the upper parts of it they cut off and turn to  other uses, but that which is left below for about a cubit in length  they eat or sell: and those who desire to have the papyrus at its very  best bake it in an oven heated red-hot, and then eat it. Some too of  these people live on fish alone, which they dry in the sun after having  caught them and taken out the entrails, and then when they are dry, they  use them for food.    Fish which swim in shoals are not much produced in the rivers, but are  bred in the lakes, and they do as follows:--When there comes upon them  the desire to breed, they swim out in shoals towards the sea; and the  males lead the way shedding forth their milt as they go, while the  females, coming after and swallowing it up, from it become impregnated:  and when they have become full of young in the sea they swim up back  again, each shoal to its own haunts. The same however no longer lead the  way as before, but the lead comes now to the females, and they leading  the way in shoals do just as the males did, that is to say they shed  forth their eggs by a few grains at a time, and the males coming after  swallow them up. Now these grains are fish, and from the grains which  survive and are not swallowed, the fish grow which afterwards are bred  up. Now those of the fish which are caught as they swim out towards the  sea are found to be rubbed on the left side of the head, but those which  are caught as they swim up again are rubbed on the right side. This  happens to them because as they swim down to the sea they keep close to  the land on the left side of the river, and again as they swim up they  keep to the same side, approaching and touching the bank as much as they  can, for fear doubtless of straying from their course by reason of the  stream. When the Nile begins to swell, the hollow places of the land  and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21312"],[0,"Glyn Severn's Schooldays (#10)"],[1,"perhaps the biggest swell out  of my father's dominions would like to show me how to do it himself.\"    \"I don't know that I can,\" said Singh quietly; \"but I dare say the poor  beast would obey me if I tried.\"    \"Oh, pray try, then, sir.--Only, look here, governor,\" continued the  man, addressing Morris, who was not far off, \"I don't know whether he's  your son or your scholar--I wash my hands of it.  I warn you; he's a  vicious beast, and I aren't a-going to pay no damages if my young  cock-a-hoop comes to grief.\"    Singh laughed a curious, disdainful laugh.  Then he took a step in the  direction of the elephant, but Glyn caught him by the arm.    \"Don't do that, Glyn,\" said the boy quietly.  \"I don't believe he would  hurt me.  Come with me if you like.  You know what he'll do if he's  going to be savage, and you run one way and I'll run the other.\"    This was in a low voice, unheard by any one but him for whom it was  intended; and the next moment, amidst a profound hush, the two boys  moved towards the elephant, who was swaying his head slowly from side to  side, and looking \"ugly,\" as the man Jem afterwards said.    Then out of the silence, urged by a sense of duty, Morris cried in a  harsh, cracked, emotional voice, not in the least like his own, \"Severn!  Prince!  Come back!  What are you going to do?\"    His last words came as if he were half-choked, and then like the rest he  stood gazing, with a strange clammy moisture gathering in his hands and  upon his brow, for as the two boys drew near, the elephant suddenly  raised its head, threw up its trunk, and uttered a shrill trumpeting  sound.    As the defiant cry ceased, Singh stepped forward in advance of his  companion, and shouted a few words in Hindustani.    The elephant lowered its trunk and stood staring at the boy, as if  wonderingly, before coming slowly forward in its heavy, ponderous way,  crashing down the green herbage beneath the orchard trees, and its great  grey bulk parting the twigs of a tree that stood alone, and beneath  whose shade the monster stopped.    The boys stood still now, and Singh uttered a short, sharp order in  Hindustani once more.    Instantly, but in a slow, ponderous way, the great beast slowly  subsided, kneeling in the long grass, while Singh went up quite close,  with the animal watching him sharply the while, and laying out its trunk  partly towards him, so that when close up the boy planted one of his  feet in the wrinkling folds of the monstrous nose, caught hold of the  huge flapping ear beside him, climbed quickly up, and the next minute  was astride the tremendous neck and uttering another command in the  Indian tongue.  The result was that the elephant raised its ears  slightly so that Singh could nestle his legs beneath; and as he settled  himself in position a merry smile spread about his lips.    \"Come on, Glyn,\" he cried.  \"It's all right.  Take my hand.\"    Glyn obeyed, and as if fully accustomed to the act, he rapidly climbed  up and settled himself behind his companion.    There was another sharp order, and the great beast slowly heaved himself  up, muttering thunder, and grumbling the while.    \"Well, I _am_ blessed!\" cried the proprietor.  \"You, Jem, did you ever  see such a game as this?\"    The man addressed did not say a word, but gave one thigh a tremendous  slap, while the elephant stretched out his trunk towards them, took a  step or two in their direction, and uttered a squeal.    Singh shouted out a few words angrily, and the long serpent-like trunk  hung pendent once again, with the tip curled up inward so that it should  not brush the ground.    \"Now then,\" cried Singh to the proprietor, \"where do you want him to  go?\"    \"Right up into the show-field, squire,\" cried the man excitedly.  \"Think  you can take him?\"    \"Try,\" replied the boy with a scornful laugh; \"but I ought to have an  _ankus_.  But never mind, I can do it with words.--I say, Glyn,\" he  continued, speaking over his left shoulder, \"we are going to ride in the  procession after all.  If the Colonel knew, what would he say?\"    \"But--but--\" cried Morris.  \"My dear boys, pray, pray come down!  Think  of the consequences to yourselves--and what will be said to me.\"    \"Oh, it's all right, Mr Morris,\" cried Glyn confidently; \"we must take  the elephant now.  Singh and I have ridden on elephants hundreds of  times, though we have never acted the parts of mahouts.--There, go on,  Mr What's-your-name, and Singh here will make him carry us back right  to where you wish.\"    There was no further opposition.  In fact, it would have been a bold man  who would have dared to offer any; but the proprietor came as close as  he thought prudent, panting hard, as the huge beast swept along in its  stately stride.    \"I beg your pardons, young gents--beg your pardons!  Honour bright,  sirs, I didn't know.  Oh, thank you; thank you kindly.  You are saving  me a hundred pounds at least, and if you'd like a nice silver watch  apiece, or a monkey, or a parrot, only say the word, and you shall have  the pick of the collection.  And look here, gentlemen, I'll give you  both perpetual passes to my show.\"    \"Thank you! thank you!\"  Glyn shouted back.  \"We will come and see it;\"  while Singh sat as statuesque as a native mahout, and an imaginative  Anglo-Indian would have forgotten his Eton costume and pictured him in  white cotton and muslin turban; while, as they neared the great  elm-trees where the gap showed grimly in the fence and the boughs hung  low, the amateur driver uttered a warning cry in Hindustani, with the  result that his great steed threw up its trunk, twined it round a  pendent branch that was in their way, snapped it off, and trampled it  under foot.        CHAPTER SEVEN.    \"SALAAM, MAHARAJAH!\"    The menagerie proprietor hurriedly led the way straight across the  cricket-field; for, full of excitement, he was eager to get right away  with the depredating animal before the owner of the damaged fence and  orchard came upon the scene.    \"I can talk to him better when I get on my own ground,\" he said to  himself; and, making straight for the gap in the Doctor's hedge, the  elephant, in obedience to word after word from his mahout, followed with  long, swinging strides.    There was a crowd outside the hedge in the road, and they would have  been across the field long before; but, in obedience to an order from  the Doctor, Wrench was on guard and kept them back.  His rather  difficult task ceased as the elephant drew near, for the crowd scattered  to avoid the monster, and the Doctor's man gave way too, the only  difference being that the little mob drew away outside the hedge while  the man made way in; for, seeing who were mounted on the great animal's  neck, he ran towards the house to meet the Doctor, who, followed by the  other masters, was now coming toward the gap with a small opera-glass in  his hand.    \"Here, Joseph,\" he cried breathlessly, \"am I right?  Are those two of my  pupils?\"    \"Yes, sir; a-riding striddling on the elephant's neck.\"    \"Dangerous!  Madness!  So undignified too!  What will people think?  Run  and tell them to get off directly and come to me.\"    The man hurriedly retraced his steps; but before he could reach the gap  in the hedge the elephant strode through and out into the road, and the  Doctor and his aides hurried back into the house to reach one of the  front windows just as, headed by the proprietor and followed by a crowd,  the elephant strode by, the two boys taking off their caps to salute  those at the window.    The Doctor turned with a look of blank amazement upon his countenance,  to stare for a few moments at the classical and French masters, who had  followed him in.    \"Gentlemen,\" he exclaimed angrily, \"did you ever see such extraordinary  behaviour in your lives?  Oh, this must be stopped!\"    But it was not stopped, for the elephant was striding away along the  main street of the town, with a crowd regathering as they saw that the  powerful monster seemed to be well under control; while the boys, now  thoroughly enjoying their exciting ride, needed no persuasion from  Ramball to keep their places and take their mount right up to the  show-field, where several of the yellow vans were already in place,  their drivers having commenced the formation of the oblong square which  was to form the show.    Here, shortly afterwards, the elephant stopped of its own volition close  to a great iron picket which was being driven into the soft earth, and  by which a truss of hay had been placed ready for its refection.    Here, as the elephant stood still, it paid no heed to a couple of  Ramball's men, who in obedience to their master's orders set to work to  fasten a strong chain to the monster's leg and attach it to the iron  picket.    For, evidently satisfied with its fruity lunch, and calmed down from the  excitement brought on by the accident, possibly too from a certain  feeling of satisfaction at hearing the native tongue of some old mahout  ringing in its great ears, the huge beast now began to take matters  according to its old routine.  It commenced by gathering up portions of  the hay, which it loosened with its trunk, sniffing at it audibly, and  then beginning to scatter it about, the boys making no attempt to quit  their lofty perch.    \"Here, one of you, bring a bucket of water,\" cried Ramball.  \"He ain't  hungry now.  Don't let him waste that hay.  Have you fastened the  chain?\"    Without waiting for the men to answer, the menagerie proprietor examined  the great fetters himself.    \"Look sharp,\" he shouted; \"quick with that water before he spoils all  the hay.\"    One man had hurried off to the pump with a couple of empty buckets,  while the others seized upon the truss which the elephant was  disturbing, but only to drop it directly, for the captive just lightly  waved its trunk right and left, and the men were sent flying in  different directions.    _Phoompf_"]]]
