It is not  to be compared with the magnificent palaces of emperors.\" \"I cannot  perfectly agree with you in opinion,\" said the emperor very obligingly,  \"for its first appearance makes me suspect you; however, I will not pass  my judgment upon it till I have seen it all; therefore be pleased to  conduct me through the apartments.\"    The princess led the emperor through all the rooms except the hall; and,  after he had considered them very attentively, and admired their  variety, \"My daughter,\" said he to the princess, \"do you call this a  country house? The finest and largest cities would soon be deserted if  all country houses were like yours. I am no longer surprised that you  despise the town. Now let me see the garden, which I doubt not is  answerable to the house.\"    The princess opened a door which led into the garden, and the first  object which presented itself to the emperor's view was the golden  fountain. Surprised at so rare an object, he asked from whence that  wonderful water, which gave so much pleasure to behold, had been  procured; where was its source, and by what art it was made to play so  high. He said he would presently take a nearer view of it.    The princess then led him to the spot where the harmonious tree was  planted; and there the emperor heard a concert, different from all he  had ever heard before; and stopping to see where the musicians were, he  could discern nobody far or near, but still distinctly heard the music  which ravished his senses. \"My daughter,\" said he to the princess,  \"where are the musicians whom I hear? Are they under ground, or  invisible in the air? Such excellent performers will hazard nothing by  being seen; on the contrary, they would please the more.\"    \"Sir,\" answered the princess, smiling, \"they are not musicians, but the  leaves of the tree your majesty sees before you, which form this  concert; and if you will give yourself the trouble to go a little  nearer, you will be convinced, and the voices will be the more  distinct.\"    The emperor went nearer and was so charmed with the sweet harmony that  he would never have been tired with hearing it, but that his desire to  have a nearer view of the fountain of golden water forced him away.  \"Daughter,\" said he, \"tell me, I pray you, whether this wonderful tree  was found in your garden by chance, or was a present made to you, or  have you procured it from some foreign country? It must certainly have  come from a great distance, otherwise curious as I am after natural  rarities I should have heard of it. What name do you call it by?\"    \"Sir,\" replied the princess, \"this tree has no other name than that of  the Singing Tree, and is not a native of this country. It would at  present take up too much time to tell your majesty by what adventures it  came here; its history is connected with the Golden Water and the  Talking Bird, which came to me at the same time, and which your majesty  may presently see. But if it be agreeable to your majesty, after you  have rested yourself and recovered the fatigue of hunting, which must be  the greater because of the sun's intense heat, I will do myself the  honour of relating it to you.\"    \"My daughter,\" replied the emperor, \"my fatigue is so well recompensed  by the wonderful things you have shown me, that I do not feel it in the  least. Let me see the Golden Water, for I am impatient to see and admire  afterward the Talking Bird.\"    When the emperor came to the Golden Water, his eyes were fixed so  steadfastly upon the fountain, that he could not take them off. At last,  addressing himself to the princess, he said: \"As you tell me, daughter,  that this water has no spring or communication, I conclude that it is  foreign, as well as the Singing Tree.\"    \"Sir,\" replied the princess, \"it is as your majesty conjectures; and to  let you know that this water has no communication with any spring, I  must inform you that the basin is one entire stone, so that the water  cannot come in at the sides or underneath. But what your majesty will  think most wonderful is that all this water proceeded but from one small  flagon, emptied into this basin, which increased to the quantity you  see, by a property peculiar to itself, and formed this fountain.\"  \"Well,\" said the emperor, going from the fountain, \"this is enough for  one time. I promise myself the pleasure to come and visit it often; but  now let us go and see the Talking Bird.\"    As he went toward the hall, the emperor perceived a prodigious number of  singing birds in the trees around, filling the air with their songs and  warblings, and asked why there were so many there and none on the other  trees in the garden. \"The reason, sir,\" answered the princess, \"is  because they come from all parts to accompany the song of the Talking  Bird, which your majesty may see in a cage in one of the windows of the  hall we are approaching; and if you attend, you will perceive that his  notes are sweeter than those of any of the other birds, even the  nightingale's.\"    The emperor went into the hall; and as the Bird continued singing, the  princess raised her voice, and said, \"My slave, here is the emperor, pay  your compliments to him.\" The Bird left off singing that instant, when  all the other birds ceased also, and said: \"The emperor is welcome; God  prosper him and prolong his life!\" As the entertainment was served on  the sofa near the window where the Bird was placed, the sultan replied,  as he was taking his seat: \"Bird, I thank you, and am overjoyed to find  in you the sultan and king of birds.\"    As soon as the emperor saw the dish of cucumbers set before him,  thinking they were prepared in the best manner, he reached out his hand  and took one; but when he cut it, was in extreme surprise to find it  stuffed with pearls. \"What novelty is this?\" said he; \"and with what  design were these cucumbers stuffed thus with pearls, since pearls are  not to be eaten?\" He looked at his hosts to ask them the meaning when  the Bird interrupting him, said: \"Can your majesty be in such great  astonishment at cucumbers stuffed with pearls, which you see with your  own eyes, and yet so easily believe that the queen, your wife, gave  birth to a dog, a cat, and a piece of wood?\" \"I believed those things,\"  replied the emperor, \"because the attendants assured me of the facts.\"  \"Those attendants, sir,\" replied the Bird, \"were the queen's two  sisters, who, envious of her happiness in being preferred by your  majesty before them, to satisfy their envy and revenge, have abused your  majesty's credulity. If you interrogate them, they will confess their  crime. The two brothers and the sister whom you see before you are your  own children, whom they exposed, and who were taken in by the intendant  of your gardens, who provided nurses for them, and took care of their  education.\"    This speech presently cleared up the emperor's understanding. \"Bird,\"  cried he, \"I believe the truth which you discover to me. The inclination  which drew me to them told me plainly they must be of my own blood. Come  then, my sons, come, my daughter, let me embrace you, and give you the  first marks of a father's love and tenderness.\" The emperor then rose,  and after having embraced the two princes and the princess, and mingled  his tears with theirs, said: \"It is not enough, my children; you must  embrace each other, not as the children of the intendant of my gardens,  to whom I have been so much obliged for preserving your lives, but as my  own children, of the royal blood of the monarchs of Persia, whose  glory, I am persuaded you will maintain.\"    After the two princes and princess had embraced mutually with new  satisfaction, the emperor sat down again with them, and finished his  meal in haste; and when he had done, said: \"My children, you see in me  your father; to-morrow I will bring the queen, your mother, therefore  prepare to receive her.\"    The emperor afterward mounted his horse, and returned with expedition to  his capitol. The first thing he did, as soon as he had alighted and  entered his palace, was to command the grand vizier to seize the queen's  two sisters. They were taken from their houses separately, convicted,  and condemned to death; which sentence was put in execution within an  hour.    In the meantime, the Emperor Kosrouschah, followed by all the lords of  his court who were then present, went on foot to the door of the great  mosque; and after he had taken the queen out of the strict confinement  she had languished under for so many years, embracing her in the  miserable condition to which she was then reduced, said to her with  tears in his eyes: \"I come to entreat your pardon for the injustice I  have done you, and to make you the reparation I ought; which I have  begun, by punishing the unnatural wretches who put the abominable cheat  upon me; and I hope you will look upon it as complete, when I present to  you two accomplished princes and a lovely princess, our children. Come  and resume your former rank, with all the honours which are your due.\"  All this was done and said before great crowds of people who flocked  from all parts at the first news of what was passing, and immediately  spread the joyful intelligence through the city.    Next morning early the emperor and queen, whose mournful humiliating  dress was changed for magnificent robes, went with all their court to  the house built by the intendant of the gardens, where the emperor  presented the Princes Bahman and Perviz, and the Princess Periezade to  their enraptured mother. \"These, much injured wife,\" said he, \"are the  two princes your sons, and the princess your daughter; embrace them with  the same tenderness I have done, since they are worthy both of me and  you.\" The tears flowed plentifully down their cheeks at these tender  embraces, especially the queen's, from the comfort and joy of having two  such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20924"],[0,"Ely Cathedral (#10)"],[1,"of    | thy destruction.'                         | the earth be blessed.'       |                         |                              |                         |               4.             |         JONAH.          |   ISAAC CARRYING THE WOOD.   |        JOEL.

Before proceeding further eastward we will examine the    +Nave Aisles,+    commencing with that on the south, at the western end. We first  observe a range of small semicircular arches running under the  windows, with a chevron moulding over some of them; in the first bay  from the west there is a row of intersecting arches over them. The  vaulting is supported by semi-columns placed at the back of the  pillars on one side, and on the other by wall-shafts between the  windows, and forms a great contrast to the rich vaulting of the  eastern portions of the Cathedral. Several traces of early fresco work  may be observed in the vault of the tenth bay from the west, and in  other places.    Under the fourth window is a doorway, which is, on the exterior,  richly ornamented, filling all available space, the whole of the  imposts, arch mouldings and capitals being thickly sculptured with  interlaced carving. In the tympanum is a figure of the Saviour in an  aureole (or 'glory' of a pointed oval shape), held up by two angels  sitting, holding an open book surmounted by a cross in His left hand,  His right being elevated in the act of benediction. The mouldings  above, as well as the capitals, jambs, and pilasters, are enriched  with running foliage, and with a series of medallions containing  birds, animals, flowers, &c., some of which are very curious. This was  formerly the Prior's entrance from the cloisters; it now opens into a  private garden belonging to the Deanery.[32]    [Footnote 32: A new door, with scrollwork in iron, has been put in at  the cost of the Bedfordshire Archaeological Society.]    Near this doorway stands a curious relic, deserving attention. It is  the lower portion of a stone cross with a square pedestal, found some  years ago at Haddenham, in the Isle of Ely, where it was used as a  horse-block; the inscription on the pedestal is in Roman capitals,  except the E, which is Saxon:         \"LUCEM-TUAM-OVINO-DA-DEUS-ET-REQUI[=E].-AMEN.\"    A translation of it is thus given by Mr. Bentham: \"Grant, O God, to  Ovin, thy light and rest. Amen.\" On reference to the history of St.  Etheldreda, foundress of the monastery at Ely,[33] to which allusion  was made in the introduction to this work, it will be seen that her  steward bore the name of Ovin, and it is not improbable that the cross  was erected either to his honour during his life, or to his memory  soon after his death; probably in the early part of the eighth  century: this would make it earlier by nearly four hundred years than  anything else in the church. The Bissexcentenary, or twelve-hundredth  anniversary of the foundation of the monastery at Ely by St.  Etheldreda was commemorated by a grand Festival in October, 1873.    [Footnote 33: Bentham's History, i. 45, &c.]    The doorway at the east end of the aisle, under the last window,  formerly the entrance for the monks from the cloisters, now the south  entrance to the Cathedral, is also worthy of special observation; the  head is trefoiled, and ornamented with figures holding pastoral  staves; above, two dragons are represented with their necks entwined;  the mouldings are rich and various, and the capitals and jambs are  sculptured with grotesque ornaments. By some persons it has been  thought that these doorways were insertions, as they do not accord  with the lines of the adjoining wall, perhaps brought from some other  building, and re-erected here when the cloisters were built.    On the second pillar from the east end of the Nave in both aisles, may  be observed a niche with a canopy, indicating the position of the  rood-screen at the western extremity of the original Choir, which  extended eastward across and beyond the space now covered by the  Octagon.    The windows of the aisles, as also those of the triforium, were  originally Norman, but were altered at some subsequent period to a  later style; those, however, of this aisle have, with one exception,  been restored to their original form, and all are filled with stained  glass. We will endeavour to describe them in their order, beginning at  the western end of the aisle.         _1st._ The days of Creation; Adam expelled from Eden; the       punishment of Mankind; the Offerings of Cain and       Abel--executed by Messrs. Henri and Alfred Gerente, of       Paris; the contributions of Visitors to the Cathedral.         _2nd._ The Building of the ark; the entry into the ark; the       Flood; and Noah's Sacrifice--by M.

A. Moore,       of Walpole St. Peter, Norfolk, at the cost of the Chapter.    We now turn our attention to the north aisle, and observe a range of  arches similar to those in the south aisle, but with the line of  chevron moulding in the eastern bay only; an intermission under one of  the windows marks the place where probably was a doorway for  communication with the church of St. Cross, but closed above two  hundred years ago, when the Lady Chapel was given for the use of the  parish of the Holy Trinity in lieu of that church which had become  ruinous.    The windows in this aisle retain their altered form; and all have been  recently filled with stained glass; in describing them we will  commence at the western end, as the subjects are arranged  chronologically.         _1st._ From the history of our first parents--Adam tilling       the ground; Cain ploughing the earth, and Abel attending       sheep; Adam and Eve discovering the body of Abel--by Mr.       Cottingham: presented by Mr. Bacon, Clerk of the Works to       the Dean and Chapter, as a memorial of his father.         _2nd._ From the history of Lot--Angels visit Lot; Lot       entertaining angels; the multitude struck with blindness;       Sodom destroyed; Lot's departure; Lot entering Zoar--by Mr.       Preedy; as a memorial of the Rev.
