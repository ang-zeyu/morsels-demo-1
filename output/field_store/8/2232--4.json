I've played so many tricks on the  crayfish*--and as I've only one eye, it is not overeasy for me to  disguise myself.'         * Name applied by the Spanish populace to the British       soldiers, on account of the colour of their uniform.    \"'Then I suppose I must go,' said I, delighted at the very idea of  seeing Carmen again. 'Well, how am I to set about it?'    \"The others answered:    \"'You must either go by sea, or you must get through by San Rocco,  whichever you like the best; once you are in Gibraltar, inquire in the  port where a chocolate-seller called _La Rollona_ lives. When you've  found her, she'll tell you everything that's happening.'    \"It was settled that we were all to start for the Sierra, that I was  to leave my two companions there, and take my way to Gibraltar, in  the character of a fruit-seller. At Ronda one of our men procured me  a passport; at Gaucin I was provided with a donkey. I loaded it with  oranges and melons, and started forth. When I reached Gibraltar I found  that many people knew _La Rollona_, but that she was either dead or had  gone _ad finibus terroe_,* and, to my mind, her disappearance explained  the failure of our correspondence with Carmen. I stabled my donkey,  and began to move about the town, carrying my oranges as though to sell  them, but in reality looking to see whether I could not come across any  face I knew. The place is full of ragamuffins from every country in the  world, and it really is like the Tower of Babel, for you can't go ten  paces along a street without hearing as many languages. I did see some  gipsies, but I hardly dared confide in them. I was taking stock of them,  and they were taking stock of me. We had mutually guessed each other  to be rogues, but the important thing for us was to know whether we  belonged to the same gang. After having spent two days in fruitless  wanderings, and having found out nothing either as to _La Rollona_ or  as to Carmen, I was thinking I would go back to my comrades as soon as I  had made a few purchases, when, toward sunset, as I was walking along a  street, I heard a woman's voice from a window say, 'Orange-seller!'         * To the galleys, or else to all the devils in hell.    \"I looked up, and on a balcony I saw Carmen looking out, beside a  scarlet-coated officer with gold epaulettes, curly hair, and all  the appearance of a rich _milord_. As for her, she was magnificently  dressed, a shawl hung on her shoulders, she'd a gold comb in her hair,  everything she wore was of silk; and the cunning little wretch, not a  bit altered, was laughing till she held her sides.    \"The Englishman shouted to me in mangled Spanish to come upstairs, as  the lady wanted some oranges, and Carmen said to me in Basque:    \"'Come up, and don't look astonished at anything!'    \"Indeed, nothing that she did ought ever to have astonished me. I don't  know whether I was most happy or wretched at seeing her again. At the  door of the house there was a tall English servant with a powdered head,  who ushered me into a splendid drawing-room. Instantly Carmen said to me  in Basque, 'You don't know one word of Spanish, and you don't know me.'  Then turning to the Englishman, she added:    \"'I told you so. I saw at once he was a Basque. Now you'll hear what a  queer language he speaks. Doesn't he look silly? He's like a cat that's  been caught in the larder!'    \"'And you,' said I to her in my own language, 'you look like an impudent  jade--and I've a good mind to scar your face here and now, before your  spark.'    \"'My spark!' said she. 'Why, you've guessed that all alone! Are you  jealous of this idiot? You're even sillier than you were before our  evening in the _Calle del Candilejo_! Don't you see, fool, that at this  moment I'm doing gipsy business, and doing it in the most brilliant  manner? This house belongs to me--the guineas of that crayfish will  belong to me! I lead him by the nose, and I'll lead him to a place that  he'll never get out of!'    \"'And if I catch you doing any gipsy business in this style again, I'll  see to it that you never do any again!' said I.    \"'Ah! upon my word! Are you my _rom_, pray that you give me orders? If  _El Tuerto_ is pleased, what have you to do with it? Oughtn't you to  be very happy that you are the only man who can call himself my  _minchorro_?'*         * My \"lover,\" or rather my \"fancy.\"    \"'What does he say?' inquired the Englishman.    \"'He says he's thirsty, and would like a drink,' answered Carmen, and  she threw herself back upon a sofa, screaming with laughter at her own  translation.    \"When that girl begins to laugh, sir, it was hopeless for anybody to try  and talk sense. Everybody laughed with her. The big Englishman began to  laugh too, like the idiot he was, and ordered the servant to bring me  something to drink.    \"While I was drinking she said to me:    \"'Do you see that ring he has on his finger? If you like I'll give it to  you.'    \"And I answered:    \"'I would give one of my fingers to have your _milord_ out on the  mountains, and each of us with a _maquila_ in his fist.'    \"'_Maquila_, what does that mean?' asked the Englishman.    \"'Maquila,' said Carmen, still laughing, 'means an orange. Isn't it a  queer word for an orange? He says he'd like you to eat _maquila_.'    \"'Does he?' said the Englishman. 'Very well, bring more _maquila_  to-morrow.'    \"While we were talking a servant came in and said dinner was ready.  Then the Englishman stood up, gave me a piastre, and offered his arm  to Carmen, as if she couldn't have walked alone. Carmen, who was still  laughing, said to me:    \"'My boy, I can't ask you to dinner. But to-morrow, as soon as you hear  the drums beat for parade, come here with your oranges. You'll find a  better furnished room than the one in the _Calle del Candilejo_, and  you'll see whether I am still your _Carmencita_. Then afterwards we'll  talk about gipsy business.'    \"I gave her no answer--even when I was in the street I could hear the  Englishman shouting, 'Bring more _maquila_ to-morrow,' and Carmen's  peals of laughter.    \"I went out, not knowing what I should do; I hardly slept, and next  morning I was so enraged with the treacherous creature that I made up  my mind to leave Gibraltar without seeing her again. But the moment  the drums began to roll, my courage failed me. I took up my net full of  oranges, and hurried off to Carmen's house. Her window-shutters had been  pulled apart a little, and I saw her great dark eyes watching for me.  The powdered servant showed me in at once. Carmen sent him out with a  message, and as soon as we were alone she burst into one of her fits of  crocodile laughter and threw her arms around my neck. Never had I seen  her look so beautiful. She was dressed out like a queen, and scented;  she had silken furniture, embroidered curtains--and I togged out like  the thief I was!    \"'_Minchorro_,' said Carmen, 'I've a good mind to smash up everything  here, set fire to the house, and take myself off to the mountains.' And  then she would fondle me, and then she would laugh, and she danced about  and tore up her fripperies. Never did monkey gambol nor make such faces,  nor play such wild tricks, as she did that day. When she had recovered  her gravity--    \"'Hark!' she said, 'this is gipsy business. I mean him to take me to  Ronda, where I have a sister who is a nun' (here she shrieked with  laughter again). 'We shall pass by a particular spot which I shall make  known to you. Then you must fall upon him and strip him to the skin.  Your best plan would be to do for him, but,' she added, with a certain  fiendish smile of hers, which no one who saw it ever had any desire to  imitate, 'do you know what you had better do? Let _El Tuerto_ come up  in front of you. You keep a little behind. The crayfish is brave, and  skilful too, and he has good pistols. Do you understand?'    \"And she broke off with another fit of laughter that made me shiver.    \"'No,' said I, 'I hate Garcia, but he's my comrade. Some day, maybe,  I'll rid you of him, but we'll settle our account after the fashion of  my country. It's only chance that has made me a gipsy, and in certain  things I shall always be a thorough Navarrese,* as the proverb says.         * _Navarro fino_.    \"'You're a fool,' she rejoined, 'a simpleton, a regular _payllo_. You're  just like the dwarf who thinks himself tall because he can spit a long  way.* You don't love me! Be off with you!'         * _Or esorjle de or marsichisle, sin chisnar lachinguel_.       \"The promise of a dwarf is that he will spit a long way.\"--A       gipsy proverb.    \"Whenever she said to me 'Be off with you,\" I couldn't go away. I  promised I would start back to my comrades and wait the arrival of the  Englishman. She, on her side, promised she would be ill until she left  Gibraltar for Ronda.    \"I remained at Gibraltar two days longer. She had the boldness to  disguise herself and come and see me at the inn. I departed, I had a  plan of my own. I went back to our meeting-place with the information as  to the spot and the hour at which the Englishman and Carmen were to pass  by. I found _El Dancaire_ and Garcia waiting for me. We spent the night  in a wood, beside a fire made of pine-cones that blazed splendidly. I  suggested to Garcia that we should play cards, and he agreed. In the  second game I told him he was cheating; he began to laugh; I threw the  cards in his face. He tried to get at his blunderbuss. I set my foot on  it, and said, 'They say you can use a knife as well as the best ruffian  in Malaga; will you try it with me?' _El Dancaire_ tried to part us. I  had given Garcia one or two cuffs, his rage had given him courage, he  drew his knife, and I drew mine. We both of us told _El Dancaire_ he  must leave us alone, and let us fight it out.

The operators must have been standing on a platform behind the back  scene; the figures were able to pass one another, but never came forward  more than a step or two, the footlights being in the way, and no doubt  the operators could not reach further forward than they did.  Each figure  was worked by two iron rods, one to his head and one to his right hand,  and several strings to which after a few minutes I paid no attention;  perhaps their very obviousness saved them from notice.  Any attempt to  conceal them would have been a mistake, for what is the use of announcing  a performance by marionettes and then pretending there is no mechanism?  Besides, if one cannot accept a few conventions one had better stay away  from the theatre altogether.    At the conclusion of the interview the knights followed one another off;  and the buoyancy of their walk must be seen to be believed.  The students  have seen it and believe it so thoroughly that, when they meet one  another in the Quattro Canti, they not unfrequently adopt it to the  amusement of the bystanders.  But the students make the mistake of  slightly overdoing it.  The marionettes often take a step or two quite  naturally, and this, while adding to the absurdity (which cannot be the  intention of the operator), also shows what is possible and makes one  think that with a little extra trouble they might be made to walk always  as smoothly as they move their heads and arms.  It might, however, be  necessary for them to have more strings, and this would make them more  difficult to manipulate.  In Sicily the marionettes who tell the story of  the Paladins do not lay themselves out to be of a mechanism so ingenious  that they shall appear to be alive; such illusion as they do produce,  like the incompetent illustration to Shakespeare which Lamb preferred, is  insufficient to cripple the imagination of the audience who are the more  intimately touched by the romance of the story and by the voice of the  speaker.    The back cloth was raised and we had before us a tranquil sea with two  little islands sleeping under a sunset sky.  Michele entered; he was a  very splendid fellow in golden armour with draperies of purple and  scarlet and white, and in his helmet a plume that nearly trailed on the  ground.  No playbill was provided, but none was wanted for Michele, he  could not have been taken for anything but an operatic tenor of noble  birth about to proceed against the Saracens.  He first meditated and then  soliloquized as he paced the sandy shore.  The Princess of Bizerta in a  flowing robe, covered with spangles, though not actually in sight, was  not far off, imparting her griefs to the unsympathetic ocean.  Spying the  paladin, she strolled in his direction and spoke to him, but it was not  an assignation; Michele, indeed, was obviously distressed at having his  soliloquy interrupted; nevertheless, being a knight and a gentleman, he  could but reply politely, and so they got into conversation.  She told  him who she was, which would not have been necessary if they had ever met  before, then she told him of her unhappy plight, namely, that she was in  the custody of an Arabian giant, and then she implored his assistance.    Michele was as unsympathetic as the ocean, his mind being full of  Saracens; but before he had time to invent a plausible lie, the giant  entered very suddenly.  Physically he was not a particularly gigantic  giant, being but three or four inches taller than Michele.  If he had  been much more, his head, which like that of all stage giants was  undeveloped at the back, would have been hidden by the clouds that hung  from the sky.  His inches, however, were enough, for, in romance, height  is given to a giant to symbolize power, and provided he is perceptibly  taller than the hero, the audience accept him as a giant and a bully and  one, moreover, who is, as a rule, nearing the end of his wicked career.  Accordingly, when, in a voice of thunder, he demanded of Michele an  immediate explanation--wanted to know how he dared address the  princess--we all felt that he was putting himself in the wrong and that a  catastrophe was imminent.  Giants, that is, unscrupulous people in power,  are too fond of assuming this attitude of unprovoked hostility and  overbearing insolence, but they assume it once too often.  Had he  remembered Adam and Eve and the apple it might have occurred to him to  inquire whether in the present case also the lady had not begun it.  Giants, however, are for the most part unintelligent, not to say  downright stupid people, and seldom have the sense to know how to use  their power wisely--think of the giant in _Jack and the Beanstalk_, think  of Polyphemus and Ulysses, think of the Inquisition and Galileo.    And then this giant made the mistake of losing his temper, and the  further mistake of showing that he had lost it, and when giants do this,  it means that they know they are in the wrong and don't care.  He  insulted Michele most grossly, and the knight very properly drew his  sword and went for him, and a terrible battle ensued throughout which  realism was thrown to the waves.  The combatants rose off the ground so  high that Michele's head and the giant's head and shoulders were  frequently lost in the clouds; and they clanked down again upon the sandy  shore two or three feet in front of where they had stood--or behind, just  as it happened; and their swords banged against their breast-plates and  shields, proving that they were real metal and not merely tinsel; and  they twirled round and round like beef on a roasting-jack, until at last  Michele dealt the inevitable blow and the giant fell dead on the sand  with a thud that jolted the coast, shook the islands, rippled across the  sunset sky and restored animation to the lifeless form of the princess.    While the battle raged she had been standing by, unmoved, blankly glaring  at the audience; and yet she must have known as well as we did that it  was all about her.  The probability is that her operator had temporarily  moored her to a convenient peg in the back of the clouds while he worked  the giant, and that at the conclusion of the duel he was free to return  to her.  She first looked round and then swooped hurriedly across the  stage, three inches from the ground; before quite touching her protector,  however, she swung halfway back again, then a little forwards, and  finally, coming to anchor at a suitable distance, raised her two hands  and, as though offering him a tray of refreshments, said--    \"Grazie.\"    He, pursuing his policy of frigid politeness, bowed in acknowledgment and  followed her off the stage, leaving the corpse of the giant lying near  the sea.    The back cloth was intentionally too long, so that the bottom was  crumpled into folds which did well enough for little waves breaking on  the shore.  These waves now began to be agitated, and gradually rose  gustily and advanced until they had covered the dead giant.  It was a  very good effect and avoided the banality of removing the body in sight  of the audience; it looked as though the wind had risen and the depths  had swallowed him.  And this, as I afterwards was told, is what happens  to the giant's body in the story.    When the back cloth went up for the next scene the corpse was gone, and  we were in The House of the Poor Man where Michele came to take  refuge--from what I did not clearly understand, but if from the Princess  of Bizerta he would have been better advised had he sought some other  sanctuary; for no sooner had he performed his usual meditation and  soliloquy and got himself to sit down on The Poor Man's chair, where he  instantly fell asleep with his head resting on his hand, than Her  Highness entered and, addressing the audience confidentially, said that  she loved him and intended to take this opportunity of giving him a kiss.  She was, however, on the other side of the stage and had first to get to  him, which she did so like a bird with a broken wing that he woke up  before she reached him.  She evidently did not consider that this added  to her difficulties, but something else did.    A dispute had been simmering in the gallery just opposite where we sat,  and now began to boil over, and threatened to swamp the play as the waves  had submerged the Arabian giant.  I thought perhaps we ought to leave,  though it would have been impossible to pass out quickly, but the  professor again assured me there was no danger; the management are  accustomed to disturbances and know how to deal with them.  So I sat  still, and the proprietor came on the stage and stood in front of the  gas-jets.  He joined his hands as though in prayer and begged us to be  quiet, saying that it was a complicated story and would require all our  attention, that Michele would die on Wednesday, and he hoped we should  not cause the speaker to die of starvation before that day by preventing  him from earning his bread.  The appearance of the proprietor among his  puppets confirmed me in the conclusion I had arrived at as to their size;  he may have been a small man, but he was about the size of the giant.  He  must have been a strong man, for, with all their armour, the figures must  be very heavy.    The proprietor's appeal went to all our hearts; silence was restored and  the princess repeated to the warrior what we already knew--that she loved  him and desired to kiss him.  Something"]]]
