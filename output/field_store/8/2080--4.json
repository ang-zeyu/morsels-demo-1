A church of this order existed in London by 1568; another,  possibly more than one, the \"Brownists,\" by 1580. Barrowe and Greenwood  began a third in 1588, which, its founders being executed, went exiled  to Amsterdam in 1593, subsequently uniting with the Presbyterians there.  These churches, though independent, were not strictly democratic, like  those next to be named.    Soon after 1600 John Smyth gathered a church at Gainsborough in  Lincolnshire, England, which persecution likewise drove to Amsterdam.  Here Smyth seceded and founded a Baptist church, which, returning to  London in 1611 or 1612, became the first church of its kind known to  have existed in England. From Smyth's church at Gainsborough sprang one  at Scrooby, in Nottinghamshire, and this, too, exiled like its parent,  crossed to Holland, finding home in Leyden in 1607 and 1608. Of this  church John Robinson was pastor, and from its bosom came the Plymouth  Colony to New England.    [Illustration: Plymouth Harbor, England.]    [Illustration: Harbor of Provincetown, Cape Cod, where the Pilgrims  landed.]    [1620]    This little band set out for America with a patent from the Virginia  Company, according to James I.'s charter of 1606, but actually began  here as labor-share holders in a sub-corporation of a new organization,  the Plymouth Company, chartered in 1620. Launching in the Mayflower from  Plymouth, where they had paused in their way hither from Holland, they  arrived off the coast of Cape Cod in 1620, December 11th Old Style,  December 21st New Style, and began a settlement, to which they gave the  name Plymouth. Before landing they had formed themselves into a  political body, a government of the people with \"just and equal laws.\"    [Illustration: The Life of the Colony at Cape Cod.]    They based their civil authority upon this Mayflower compact,  practically ignoring England. Carver was the first governor, Bradford  the second. The colony was named Plymouth in memory of hospitalities  which its members had received at Plymouth, England, the name having no  connection with the \"Plymouth\" of the Plymouth Company. The members of  the Plymouth Company had none but a mercantile interest in the  adventure, merely fitting out the colonists and bearing the expense of  the passage for all but the first. On the other hand, the stock was not  all retained in England. Shares were allotted to the Pilgrims as well,  one to each emigrant with or without means, and one for every 10 pounds  invested.    Plymouth early made a treaty with Massasoit, the chief of the  neighboring Wampanoags, the peace lasting with benign effects to both  parties for fifty years, or till the outbreak of Philip's War, discussed  in a later chapter. The first winter in Plymouth was one of dreadful  hardships, of famine, disease and death, which spring relieved but in  part. Yet Plymouth grew, surely if slowly. It acquired rights on the  Kennebec, on the Connecticut, at Cape Ann. It was at first a pure  democracy, its laws all made in mass-meetings of the entire body of  male inhabitants; nor was it till 1639 that increase of numbers forced  resort to the principle of representation. In 1643 the population was  about three thousand.    [Illustration: Signatures to Plymouth Patent.  /In witnes whereof the said President & Counsell haue to the one pt of  this pute Indenture sett their seales* And to th'other pt hereof the  said John Peirce in the name of himself and his said Associate haue sett  to his seale geven the day and yeeres first aboue written/]    [1626-1630]    Between 1620 and 1630 there were isolated settlers along the whole New  England coast. White, a minister from Dorchester, England, founded a  colony near Cape Ann, which removed to Salem in 1626. The Plymouth  Company granted them a patent, which Endicott, in charge of more  emigrants, brought over in 1628. It gave title to all land between the  Merrimac and Charles Rivers, also to all within three miles beyond each.  These men formed the nucleus of the colony to which in 1629 Charles I.  granted a royal charter, styling the proprietors \"the Governor and  Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England.\" Boston was made the  capital. Soon more emigrants came, and Charlestown was settled.    [Illustration: Site of First Church and Governor Bradford's House at  Plymouth.]    It was a momentous step when the government of this colony was  transferred to New England. Winthrop was chosen Governor, others of the  Company elected to minor offices, and they, with no fewer than one  thousand new colonists, sailed for this side the Atlantic. In  Massachusetts, therefore, a trading company did not beget, as elsewhere,  but literally became a political state. Many of the Massachusetts men,  in contrast with those of Plymouth, had enjoyed high consideration at  home. Yet democracy prevailed here too. The Governor and his eighteen  assistants were chosen by the freemen, and were both legislature and  court. As population increased and scattered in towns, these chose  deputies to represent them, and a lower house element was added to the  General Court, though assistants and deputies did not sit separately  till 1644.    [Illustration: Governor Winthrop.]    [1631]    At this time Massachusetts had a population of about 15,000. To all New  England 21,200 emigrants came between 1628 and 1643, the total white  population at the latter date being about 24,000.    [Illustration: First Church in Salem.]    So early as 1631 this colony decreed to admit none as freemen who were  not also church members. Thus Church and State were made one, the  government a theocracy. The Massachusetts settlers, though in many  things less extreme than the Pilgrims, were decided Puritans, sincere  but formal, precise, narrow, and very superstitious. They did not,  however, on coming hither, affect or wish to separate from the Church of  England, earnestly as they deprecated retaining the sign of the cross in  baptism, the surplice, marriage with ring, and kneeling at communion.  Yet soon they in effect became Separatists as well as Puritans, building  independent churches, like those at Plymouth, and repudiating episcopacy  utterly.    [Illustration: Seal of Massachusetts Bay Company.]    [1635]    Much as these Puritans professed and tried to exalt reason in certain  matters, in civil and religious affairs, where they took the Old  Testament as affording literal and minute directions for all sorts of  human actions for all time, they could allow little liberty of opinion.  This was apparent when into this theocratic state came Roger Williams,  afterward the founder of Rhode Island. Born in London, England, about  1607, of good family, he was placed by his patron, Coke, at the Charter  House School. From there he went to Pembroke College, Cambridge. In 1631  he arrived in Boston. Somewhat finical in his political, moral, and  religious ideas, he found it impossible, having separated from the  Church of England, in which he had been reared, to harmonize here with  those still favoring that communion. At Salem he was invited by a little  company of Separatists to become their teacher. His views soon offended  the authorities. He declared that the king's patent could confer no  title to lands possessed by Indians. He denied the right of magistrates  to punish heresy, or to enforce attendance upon religious services. \"The  magistrate's power,\" he said, \"extends only to the bodies, goods, and  outward state of men.\"    Alarmed at his bold utterances, the General Court of Massachusetts,  September 2, 1635, decreed his banishment for \"new and dangerous  opinions, against the authority of magistrates.\" His fate was not,  therefore, merely because of his religious views. The exile sought  refuge at Seekonk, but this being within the Plymouth jurisdiction, he,  on Governor Winslow's admonition, moved farther into the wilderness,  settling at Providence. He purchased land of the natives, and, joined by  others, set up a pure democracy, instituting as a part thereof the  \"lively experiment,\" for which ages had waited, of perfect liberty in  matters of religious belief. Not for the first time in history, but more  clearly, earnestly, and consistently than it had ever been done before,  he maintained for every man the right of absolute freedom in matters of  conscience, for all forms of faith equal toleration.    [Illustration: Roger Williams' House at Salem.]    [1638]    [Illustration: Edward Winslow.]    Some friends of Mrs. Anne Hutchinson established a colony on Aquidneck,  the Indian name for Rhode Island. Williams went to England and secured  from Parliament a patent which united that plantation with his in one  government. Charles II.'s charter of 1663 added Warwick to the first two  settlements, renewing and enlarging the patent, and giving freest scope  for government according to Williams' ideas. Mrs. Hutchinson, a woman of  rare intellect and eloquence, who maintained the right of private  judgment and pretended to an infallible inner light of revelation, was,  like Williams, a victim of Puritan intolerance. She and her followers  were banished, and some of them, returning, put to death, 1659-60. She  came to Providence, then went to Aquidneck, where her husband died in  1642. She next settled near Hurl Gate, within the Dutch limits, where  herself and almost her entire family were butchered by the Indians in  1643.    In 1633 the Dutch erected a fort where Hartford now is, but some English  emigrants from Plymouth Colony, in defiance of a threatened cannonade,  sailed past and built a trading-house at Windsor, where, joined by  colonists, from about Boston, they soon effected a settlement.  Wethersfield and Hartford "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20927"],[0,"A Critical Exposition of the Popular 'Jihád' (#10)"],[1,"comets were  visible; another one appeared in 608 A.D. Each of the years 614 and 615  had one comet. There were also comets visible in 617 A.D. (_vide_  Chambers's Descriptive Astronomy). These comets are most probably  noticed in the contemporary record (_i.e._ the Koran). A comet is called  _Tariq_, or \"night comer,\" in Sura LXXXVI, verse 1; and described as the  star of piercing radiance. (_Annajmus Saqib. Ibid_ 3.)    The _Kahins_ were very much alarmed at the stupendous phenomena of the  falling stars and the comets; and had stopped their soothsaying and  divinations. Whenever they used to sit on their places of listening,  enchanting, and divination during night-time, looking at the heavens,  their eyes met with showers of shooting stars and brilliant comets which  bewildered them very much. It is said that the first whose attention was  attracted to the unusual shooting stars was a clan of the Sakeefites of  Us-Tayif (Ibn Hisham, page 131). These Jinns, when they were converted  to Islam at Nakhla near Tayif, expressed their bewilderment from the  unusual shower of falling stars and the appearance of numerous comets in  their peculiar language:--    \"The heaven did we essay but found it filled with mighty garrison and of  darting flames.\"    \"We sat on some of the seats to listen, but whoever now listeneth  findeth a darting flame in ambush for him.\"    \"We know not whether evil be meant for them that are on earth, or  whether their Lord meaneth true guidance for them.\"--Sura LXXII, verses  8-10.    So the pretenders of hearing the discourses of heavenly bodies being  quite harassed by the extraordinary showers of the falling stars, and  the appearances of numerous comets, had stopped their divination. This  was taken notice of in the Koran:--    \"They overhear not exalted chiefs, and they are darted from every side.\"    \"Driven off and consigned to a lasting torment; while if one steal by  stealth then a glistering flame pursueth him.\"--Sura XXXVII, verses  8-10.    \"Save such as steal a hearing, and him do visible flames pursue.\"--Sura  XV, verse 18.    \"The satans were not sent down with this _Koran_. It beseemed them not,  and they had not the power. For they are far removed from the  hearing.\"--Sura XXVI, verses 210-212.    As an instance of terror and bewilderment caused by meteors and shooting  stars among credulous people, I will quote the following anecdote:    About the middle of the tenth century an epidemic terror of the end of  the world had spread over Christendom. The scene of the last judgment  was expected to be in Jerusalem.    In the year 999 the number of pilgrims proceeding eastwards, to await  the coming of the Lord in that city, was so great that they were  compared to a desolating army. During the thousandth year the number of  pilgrims increased. Every phenomenon of nature filled them with terror.  A thunderstorm sent them all upon their knees. Every meteor in the sky  seen at Jerusalem brought the whole Christian population into the  streets to weep and pray. The pilgrims on the road were in the same  alarm. Every shooting star furnished occasion for a sermon, in which the  sublimity of the approaching judgment was the principal topic (_vide_  Extraordinary Popular Delusions by Charles Mackay, LL.D., London, pp.  222 and 223).    It was a conceit or imposture of the _Kahins_ to pretend that their  demons had access to the outskirts of the heavens, and by assiduous  eavesdropping secured some of the secrets of the upper world and  communicated the same to the soothsayers or diviners upon earth. The  Jews had a similar notion of the demons (schedim), learning the secrets  of the future by listening behind the veil (pargod). The Koran falsified  them in their assertions. It says that the heavens (or the stars) are  safe and protected against the eavesdropping (or enchantments) of the  soothsayers.    \"We have set the signs of Zodiac in the heavens, and we have decked them  forth for the bewilders.\"    \"And we guard them from every stoned satan.\"--Sura XV, verses 16, 17.    \"Verily we have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the  stars;\"    \"And we have guarded them against every rebellious satan.\"--Sura XXXVII,  verses 6, 7.    \"... And we have furnished the lower heaven with lights and have  protected it....\"--Sura XLI, verse 11.    The Koran further says that the soothsayers impart to their votaries or  to those who go to consult them what they have heard from other people  and are liars:--    \"They impart what they have heard, but most of them are liars.\"--Sura  XXVI, verse 223.    It is nowhere said in the Koran that the stars are darted or hurled at  the Satans. Sura LXVII, verse 5, literally means, \"of a surety we have  decked the lower heaven with lights and have made them to be (means of)  '_Rojum_' conjectures to the (or for the) devils, _i.e._ the  astrologer.\" The primary meaning of _Rajm_ is a thing that is thrown or  cast like a stone: pl. '_Rojum_,' but it generally means speaking of  that which is hidden, or conjecturing or speaking by conjecture, as in  Sura XVIII, verse 21. In Sura XIX, verse 47, the word \"_La-arjomannaka_\"  has been explained both ways, meaning (1) \"I will assuredly cast stones  at thee,\" and (2) \"I will assuredly say of thee, (though) speaking of  that which is hidden (from me) or unknown (by me), what thou dislikest  or hatest.\" _Vide_ Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, page 1048.]      [Sidenote: Rapid stride of Islam at Medina.]    20. Next year twelve new converts were made from persons who had come to  see the Prophet from Medina. They returned as missionaries of Islam, and  Islam spread rapidly in Medina from house to house and from tribe to  tribe. The Jews looked on in amazement at the people whom they had in  vain endeavoured from generations to convince of the errors of  polytheism, and to dissuade from the abominations of their idolatry,  suddenly of their own accord casting away idols and professing belief in  the one True God.[42] Thus speedily without let or hindrance, force or  compulsion, did Islam take firm root at Medina and attain to a full and  mature growth. There remained not a single house among the Aws and  Khazraj tribes[43] of Medina in which there were not believing men and  women, excepting the branch of the Aws Allah, who were not converts till  after the siege of Medina. At this time there were many Moslems in  Mecca, Medina, and Abyssinia, and not a single one of them could be said  to have been converted to Islam by compulsion: on the contrary, they  were used to be forced to renounce Islam.    [Footnote 42: \"After five centuries of Christian evangelization, we can  point to but a sprinkling here and there of Christian converts;--the  Bani Harith of Najran: the Bani Hanifa of Yemama; some of the Bani Tay  at Tayma, and hardly any more. Judaism, vastly more powerful, had  exhibited a spasmodic effort of proselytizm under Dzu Nowas; but, as an  active and converting agent the Jewish faith was no longer  operative.\"--Muir's Life of Mahomet, Vol. I, page ccxxxix.]    [Footnote 43: The Aws or Khazraj were two branches of the Azdite tribes  of Yemen from the Kahlanite stock. After their emigration to the North  they separated themselves from the Ghassinides and returned to Medina,  where they settled.]      [Sidenote: The increasing number of Moslem converts at Mecca after the  Hegira.]    21. When the Moslems were obliged to emigrate from Mecca under the  severe Koreishite persecutions, all the followers of the Prophet with  the exception of those detained in confinement or unable to escape from  slavery had emigrated with their families to Medina. But there were many  new converts at Mecca since the expulsion of the Moslems. Those unable  to fly from Mecca in the teeth of the oppressions of the wrathful  Koreish (Sura IV., 77, 79, 100) were increasing. They appealed for  deliverance and aid, while the Moslem pilgrims were near Mecca at  Hodeibia, six years after the Hegira, and an allusion is made to the  great number of the Meccan converts, living at Mecca during that time in  Sura XLVIII, 25.      [Sidenote: Disturbed state of the public peace among the tribes  surrounding Medina. Internecine wars an obstacle to the propagation of  Islam.]    22. Irrespective of the wars prosecuted by the Koreish from the South  against Mohammad at Medina, and the constant danger of inroad and attack  upon Medina from the neighbouring tribes--a great obstacle in the  propagation of Islam which could only be successfully accomplished in a  state of peace and tranquility of both parties,--the most important and  great tribes in the North and Centre of Arabia were at war against each  other during the life of Mohammad, either before his mission from 570 to  610 A.D. or during his public mission from 610 to 632 A.D. The  disastrous internecine wars were kept up for scores of years and the  evils necessarily inflicted in their progress were not confined to the  belligerents only. It required years to remove the evils of war and to  efface the traces of misery and sorrow the wars had brought.[44]    [Footnote 44: The same remarks apply to the wars fought during  Mohammad's lifetime but before his public mission.]      23. Here I will give a brief sketch of the internecine wars which took  place among the various Arab tribes during the time of Mohammad.    *Wars during Mohammad's Lifetime, between the Arabian Tribes in the North  and Centre of Arabia.*    _Before his mission_, 570-610, A.D.
