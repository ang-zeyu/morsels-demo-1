They saw a couple of owls _which_ (10  _g_) _were_ sitting upon a tree (_l_) (8) _which_ grew near an old  wall out of a heap of rubbish. The Sultan said (6) he should like to  know what the two owls were saying to one another, _and asked the_  (_m_) _Vizier to_ listen to their discourse and give him an account of  it. The Vizier, (_n_) (31) pretending to be very attentive to the  owls, approached the tree.

The story says (_s_) _that_ (_t_) (5) _he_ was  touched with the fable, (30) and (_s_) _that_ he (_a_) (39) from that  time forward _consulted_ (15) _the good of his people_, and that he  rebuilt the towns and villages (_v_) _which_ had been destroyed.\"         (_a_) \"abroad ... at home.\" (_b_) \"ruin.\" (_c_) \"desolation.\"       (_d_) \"half unpeopled.\" (_e_) \"The Vizier of &c.\" (_f_) \"We are       not informed\" is emphatic, and therefore should be inverted,       \"whether he was, &c., we are not informed.\" (_g_) \"but he\" will       be omitted when \"the Vizier\" is made the subject of \"pretended.\"       (_h_) \"Pretended\" once meant \"claimed,\" \"professed.\" Write       \"professed.\" (_i_) \"a certain dervish.\" (_j_) Introduce a new       subject that you may substitute \"Vizier\" for \"he,\" thus: \"so that       not a bird could open its mouth, but the Vizier knew &c.\" (_k_)       \"As he was, one evening, &c.\" (_l_) Note that the tree is       represented as growing out of _ruins_. This is in accordance with       the story of the mischief Mahmoud had done. (_m_) Omit this.

The least obtrusive addition will be blind  tooling, or, as in so many old books, stamping, which may emphasize the  depth of color in the leather. The next step in the direction of  ornament is gilding, the next inlaying. In the older books we find metal  clasps and corners, which have great decorative possibilities; but  these, like precious stones, have disappeared from book ornamentation in  modern times before the combined inroad of the democratic and the  classic spirit.    Having once turned back the cover, our interest soon forsakes it for the  pages inclosed by it. The first of these is the page opposite the inside  of the cover; obviously it should be of the same or, at least, of a  similar material to the body of the book. But the inside of the cover is  open to two treatments; it may bear the material either of the outer  covering or of the pages within. So it may display, for instance, a  beautiful panel of leather--doublure--or it may share with the next page  a decorative lining paper; but that next page should never be of  leather, for it is the first page of the book.    As regards book papers, we are to-day in a more fortunate position than  we were even a few years ago; for we now can obtain, and at no excessive  cost, papers as durable as those employed by the earliest printers. It  is needless to say that these are relatively rough papers. They  represent one esthetic advance in papermaking since the earliest days in  that they are not all dead white. Some of the books of the first age of  printing still present to the eye very nearly the blackest black on the  whitest white. But, while this effect is strong and brilliant, it is not  the most pleasing. The result most agreeable to the eye still demands  black or possibly a dark blue ink, but the white of the paper should be  softened. Whether we should have made this discovery of our own wit no  one can tell; but it was revealed to us by the darkening of most papers  under the touch of time. Shakespeare forebodes this yellowing of his  pages; but what was then thought of as a misfortune has since been  accepted as an element of beauty, and now book papers are regularly made  \"antique\" as well as \"white.\" Even white does not please us unless it  inclines to creamy yellow rather than to blue. But here, as everywhere,  it is easy to overstep the bounds of moderation and turn excess into a  defect. The paper of the book beautiful will not attract attention; we  shall not see it until our second look at the page. The paper must not  be too thick for the size of the book, else the volume will not open  well, and its pages, instead of having a flowing character, will be  stiff and hard.    The sewing of the book is not really in evidence, except indirectly.  Upon the sewing and gluing, after the paper, depends the flexibility of  the book; but the sewing in most early books shows in the raised bands  across the back, which are due to the primitive and preferable stitch.  It may also show in some early and much modern work in saw-marks at the  inner fold when the book is spread wide open; but no such book can  figure as a book beautiful. The head band is in primitive books a part  of the sewing, though in all modern books, except those that represent a  revival of medieval methods, it is something bought by the yard and  stuck in without any structural connection with the rest of the book.    It is the page and not the cover that controls the proportions of the  book, as the living nautilus controls its inclosing shell. The range in  the size of books is very great--from the \"fly's-eye Dante\" to  \"Audubon's Birds\"--but the range in proportion within the limits of  beauty is astonishingly small, a difference in the relation of the width  of the page to its height between about sixty and seventy-five per cent.  If the width is diminished to nearer one-half the height, the page  becomes too narrow for beauty, besides making books of moderate size too  narrow to open well. On the other hand, if the width is much more than  three-quarters of the height, the page offends by looking too square. In  the so-called \"printer's oblong,\" formed by taking twice the width for  the diagonal, the width is just under fifty-eight per cent of the  height, and this is the limit of stately slenderness in a volume. As we  go much over sixty per cent, the book loses in grace until we approach  seventy-five per cent, when a new quality appears, which characterizes  the quarto, not so much beauty, perhaps, except in small sizes, as a  certain attractiveness, like that of a freight boat, which sets off the  finer lines of its more elegant associates. A really square book would  be a triumph of ugliness. Oblong books also rule themselves out of our  category. A book has still a third element in its proportions,  thickness. A very thin book may be beautiful, but a book so thick as to  be chunky or squat is as lacking in elegance as the words we apply to  it. To err on the side of thickness is easy; to err on the side of  thinness is hard, since even a broadside may be a thing of beauty.    We now come to the type-page, of which the paper is only the carrier and  framework. This should have, as nearly as possible, the proportion of  the paper--really it is the type that should control the paper--and the  two should obviously belong together. The margins need not be extremely  large for beauty; an amount of surface equal to that occupied by the  type is ample. There was once a craze for broad margins and even for  \"large-paper\" copies, in which the type was lost in an expanse of  margin; but book designers have come to realize that the proportion of  white to black on a page can as easily be too great as too small. Far  more important to the beauty of a page than the extent of the margin are  its proportions. The eye demands that the upper margin of a printed page  or a framed engraving shall be narrower than the lower, but here the  kinship of page to picture ceases. The picture is seen alone, but the  printed page is one of a pair and makes with its mate a double diagram.  This consists of two panels of black set between two outer columns of  white and separated by a column of white. Now if the outer and inner  margins of a page are equal, the inner column of the complete figure  will be twice as wide as the outer. The inner margin of the page should  therefore be half (or, to allow for the sewing and the curve of the  leaf, a little more than half) the width of the outer. Then, when we  open the book, we shall see three columns of equal width. The type and  paper pages, being of the same shape, should as a rule be set on a  common diagonal from the inner upper corner to the outer lower corner.  This arrangement will give the same proportion between the top and  bottom margins as was assigned to the inner and outer. It is by  attention to this detail that one of the greatest charms in the design  of the book may be attained.    We saw that the shape of the book is a rectangle, and this would  naturally be so if there were no other reason for it than because the  smallest factor of the book, the type, is in the cross-section of its  body a rectangle. The printed page is really built up of tiny invisible  rectangles, which thus determine the shape of the paper page and of the  cover. A page may be beautiful from its paper, its proportions, its  color effects, even if it is not legible; but the book beautiful, really  to satisfy us, must neither strain the eye with too small type nor  offend it with fantastic departures from the normal. The size of the  type must not be out of proportion to that of the page or the column;  for two or more columns are not barred from the book beautiful. The  letters must be beautiful individually and beautiful in combination. It  has been remarked that while roman capitals are superb in combination,  black-letter capitals are incapable of team play, being, when grouped,  neither legible nor beautiful. There has been a recent movement in the  direction of legibility that has militated against beauty of type, and  that is the enlarging of the body of the ordinary lowercase letters at  the expense of its limbs, the ascenders and descenders, especially the  latter. The eye takes little account of descenders in reading, because  it runs along a line just below the tops of the ordinary letters, about  at the bar of the small e; nevertheless, to one who has learned to  appreciate beauty in type design there is something distressing in the  atrophied or distorted body of the g in so many modern types and the  stunted p's and q's--which the designer clearly did not mind! The  ascenders sometimes fare nearly as badly. Now types of this compressed  character really call for leading, or separation of the lines; and when  this has been done, the blank spaces thus created might better have been  occupied by the tops and bottoms of unleaded lines containing letters of  normal length and height. Too much leading, like too wide margins,  dazzles and offends the eye with its excess of white. The typesetting  machines have also militated against beauty by requiring that every  letter shall stand within the space of its own feet or shoulders. Thus  the lowercase f and y and the uppercase Q are shorn of their due  proportions. These are points that most readers do not notice, but they  are essential, for the type of the book beautiful must not be deformed  by expediency. On the other hand, it need not be unusual; if it is, it  must be exceptionally fine to pass muster at all. The two extremes of  standard roman type, Caslon and Bodoni, are handsome enough"]]]
