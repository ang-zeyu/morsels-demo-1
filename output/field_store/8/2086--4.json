The middle ages had been  familiar with charters and constitutions; but they had been merely  compacts for immunities, partial enfranchisements, patents of nobility,  concessions of municipal privileges, or the limitations of sovereign in  favour of feudal institutions. In the cabin of the _Mayflower_ humanity  recorded its rights, and instituted a government on the basis of 'equal  laws' for the 'general good.'\" (History of the United States, Vol. I, p.  310.)    Now, any reader of the agreement will see that it says not a word about  \"popular constitutional liberty,\" much less of the \"rights of humanity.\"  It was no Declaration of Independence. Its signers call themselves  \"loyal subjects of the King of England,\" and state one object of their  emigration to be the \"honour of our King and country.\" The Pilgrim  Fathers did, in the course of time, establish a simple system of popular  government; but from the written compact signed in the cabin of the  _Mayflower_ any form of government might be developed. The good sense of  the following remarks by Dr. Young, in his _Chronicles of the Pilgrims  of Plymouth_, contrast favourably with the fanciful hyperboles of  Bancroft: \"It seems to me that a great deal more has been discovered in  this document than the signers contemplated. It is evident that when  they left Holland they expected to become a body politic, using among  themselves civil government, and to choose their own rulers from among  themselves. Their purpose in drawing up and signing this compact was  simply, as they state, to restrain certain of their number who had  manifested an unruly and factious disposition. This was the whole  philosophy of the instrument, whatever may have since been discovered  and deduced from it.\" (p. 120.)]    [Footnote 8: Bradford's History of the Plymouth Plantation, p. 78. \"The  31st of December (1620) being Sabbath, they attended Divine service for  the first time on shore, and named the place _Plymouth_, partly because  this harbour was so called in Capt. John Smith's map, published three or  four years before, and partly in remembrance of very kind treatment  which they had received from the inhabitants of the last port of their  native country from which they sailed.\" (Moore's Lives of the Governors  of Plymouth, pp. 37, 38.)    The original Indian name of the place was _Accomack_; but at the time  the Pilgrims settled there, an Indian informed them it was called  _Patuxet_. Capt. John Smith's Description of New England was published  in 1616. He says, \"I took the description as well by map as writing, and  called it New England.\" He dedicated his work to Prince Charles  (afterwards King Charles II.), begging him to change the \"barbarous  names.\" In the list of names changed by Prince Charles, _Accomack_ (or  Patuxet) was altered to _Plymouth_. Mr. Dermer, employed by Sir F.  Gorges and others for purposes of discovery and trade, visited this  place about four months before the arrival of the Pilgrims, and  significantly said, \"I would that Plymouth [in England] had the like  commodities. I would that the first plantation might here be seated if  there come to the number of fifty persons or upward.\"]    [Footnote 9: See following Note:--    NOTE _on the Inflated American Accounts of the Voyage and Settlement of  the Pilgrim Fathers_.--Everything relating to the character, voyage, and  settlement of the Pilgrims in New England has been invested with the  marvellous, if not supernatural, by most American writers. One of them  says, \"God not only sifted the three kingdoms to get the seed of this  enterprise, but sifted that seed over again. Every person whom He would  not have go at that time, to plant the first colony of New England, He  sent back even from mid-ocean in the _Speedwell_.\" (Rev. Dr. Cheever's  Journal of the Pilgrims.)    The simple fact was, that the _Mayflower_ could not carry any more  passengers than she brought, and therefore most of the passengers of the  _Speedwell_, which was a vessel of 50 tons and proved to be unseaworthy,  were compelled to remain until the following year, and came over in the  _Fortune_; and among these Robert Cushman, with his family, one of the  most distinguished and honoured of the Pilgrim Fathers. And there was  doubtless as good \"seed\" in \"the three kingdoms\" after this \"sifting\" of  them for the New England enterprise as there was before.    In one of his speeches, the late eloquent Governor Everett, of  Massachusetts, describes their voyage as the \"long, cold, dreary  autumnal passage, in that one solitary, adventurous vessel, the  _Mayflower_ of forlorn hope, freighted with prospects of a future state,  and bound across the unknown sea, pursuing, with a thousand misgivings,  the uncertain, the tedious voyage, suns rise and set, and winter  surprises them on the deep, but brings them not the sight of the  wished-for shore. The awful voice of the storm howls through the  rigging. The labouring masts seem straining from their base; the dismal  sound of the pumps is heard; the ship leaps, as it were, madly from  billow to billow; the ocean breaks, and settles with engulfing floods  over the floating deck, and beats with deadening, shivering weight  against the staggering vessel.\"    It is difficult to imagine how \"winter\" could surprise passengers  crossing the ocean between the 6th of September and the 9th of  November--a season of the year much _chosen_ even nowadays for crossing  the Atlantic. It is equally difficult to conceive how that could have  been an \"unknown sea\" which had been crossed and the New England coasts  explored by Gosnold, Smith, Dermer and others (all of whom had published  accounts of their voyage), besides more than a dozen fishing vessels  which had crossed this very year to obtain fish and furs in the  neighbourhood and north of Cape Cod. Doubtless often the \"suns rose and  set\" upon these vessels without their seeing the \"wished-for shore;\" and  probably more than once, \"the awful voice of the storm howled through  their rigging,\" and \"the dismal sound of their pumps was heard,\" and  they \"madly leaped from billow to billow,\" and \"staggered under the  deadening, shivering weight of the broken ocean,\" and with its  \"engulfing floods\" over their \"floating decks.\" The _Mayflower_ was a  vessel of 180 tons burden--more than twice as large as any of the  vessels in which the early English, French, and Spanish discoverers of  America made their voyages--much larger than most of the vessels  employed in carrying emigrants to Virginia during the previous ten  years--more than three times as large as the ship _Fortune_, of 53 tons,  which crossed the ocean the following year, and arrived at Plymouth also  the 9th of November, bringing Mr. Cushman and the rest of the passengers  left by the _Speedwell_ the year before. Gosnold had crossed the ocean  and explored the eastern coasts of America in 1602 in a \"small bark;\"  Martin Pring had done the same in 1603 in the bark _Discovery_, of 26  tons; Frobisher, in northern and dangerous coasts, in a vessel of 25  tons burden; and two of the vessels of Columbus were from 15 to 30 tons  burden, and without decks on which to \"float\" the \"engulfing floods\"  under which the _Mayflower_ \"staggered\" so marvellously. All these  vessels long preceded the _Mayflower_ across the \"unknown ocean;\" but  never inspired the lofty eloquence which Mr. Everett and a host of  inferior rhapsodists have bestowed upon the _Mayflower_ and her voyage.  Bancroft fills several pages of his elaborate history to the same  effect, and in similar style with the passages above quoted. I will give  a single sentence, as follows:--\"The Pilgrims having selected for their  settlement the country near the Hudson, the best position on the whole  coast, were conducted to the most barren and inhospitable part of  Massachusetts.\" (History of the United States, Vol. 1., p. 309.)    There was certainly little self-abnegation, but much sound and worldly  wisdom, in the Pilgrims selecting \"the best position on the whole coast\"  of America for their settlement; and there is as little truth in the  statement, though a good antithesis--the delight of Mr. Bancroft--that  the Pilgrims were conducted to \"the most barren and inhospitable part of  Massachusetts\" for \"actual settlement,\" as appears from the descriptions  given of it by Governors Winslow and Bradford and other Pilgrim Fathers,  written after the first and during the subsequent years of their  settlement. I will give but two illustrations. Mr. Winslow was one of  the passengers in the _Mayflower_, and was, by annual election, several  years Governor of the Plymouth colony. It has been stated above that the  ship _Fortune_, of 53 tons burden, brought in the autumn of 1621 the  Pilgrim passengers who had been left in England the year before by the  sea-unworthiness of the _Speedwell_. The _Fortune_ anchored in Plymouth  Bay the 9th of November--just a year from the day on which the  _Mayflower_ spied the land of Cape Cod. Mr. Winslow prepared and sent  back by the _Fortune_ an elaborate \"Relation\" of the state and prospects  of the colony, for the information of the merchant adventurers and  others in England. He describes the climate, soil, and all the resources  of the colony's means of support, together with the process and result  of the first year's labour. I will simply give his account of the manner  in which they celebrated what in England would be called a \"Harvest  Home.\" He says: \"Our harvest being got in, our Governor sent four men on  fowling, that so we might, after a more special manner, rejoice together  after we had gathered the fruit of our labours. They four in a day  killed as much fowl as, with little help besides, served the company  almost a week; at which time, amongst other recreations, we exercised  our arms.

And even after that he is dunning me, poor helpless me!    _Mathura._ [_Seizing him._] My name is Mathura, the clever swindler,  and you're not going to swindle me this time. Pay up, jail-bird,  every bit of my money, and this minute, too.    _Shampooer._ How can I pay?    _Mathura._ Sell your father and pay.    _Shampooer._ Where can I get a father?    _Mathura._ Sell your mother and pay.    _Shampooer._ Where can I get a mother?    _Mathura._ Sell yourself and pay.    _Shampooer._ Have mercy! Lead me to the king's highway.    _Mathura._ Go ahead.    _Shampooer._ If it must be. [_He walks about._] Gentlemen, will you  buy me for ten gold-pieces from this gambling-master? [_He sees  a passer-by and calls out._] What is that? You wish to know what  I can do? I will be your house-servant. What! he has gone without  even answering. Well, here's another. I'll speak to him. [_He repeats  his offer._] What! this one too takes no notice of me. He is  gone. Confound it! I've had hard luck ever since Charudatta lost  his fortune.    _Mathura._ Will you pay?    _Shampooer._ How can I pay? [_He falls down. Mathura drags him  about._] Good gentlemen, save me, save me! [_Enter Darduraka._]    P. 61.5]    _Darduraka._ Yes, gambling is a kingdom without a throne.        You do not mind defeat at all;      Great are the sums you spend and win;      While kingly revenues roll in,      Rich men, like slaves, before you fall.                      7    And again:        You earn your coin by gambling,      Your friends and wife by gambling,      Your gifts and food by gambling;      Your last cent goes by gambling.                             8    And again:        My cash was taken by the trey;      The deuce then took my health away;      The ace then set me on the street;      The four completed my defeat.                                9    [_He looks before him._] Here comes Mathura, our sometime  gambling-master. Well, as I can't escape, I think I'll put on my veil.  [_He makes any number of gestures with his cloak, then examines it._]        This cloth is sadly indigent in thread;      This lovely cloth lets in a lot of light;      This cloth's protective power is nearly fled;      This cloth is pretty when it's rolled up tight.              10    Yet after all, what more could a poor saint do? For you see,        One foot I've planted in the sky,      The other on the ground must lie.[41]      The elevation's rather high,      But the sun stands it. Why can't I?                          11    _Mathura._ Pay, pay!    _Shampooer._ How can I pay? [_Mathura drags him about._]    _Darduraka._ Well, well, what is this I see? [_He addresses a bystander._]  What did you say, sir? \"This shampooer is being maltreated  by the gambling-master, and no one will save him\"? I'll  save him myself. [_He presses forward._] Stand back, stand back!    [33.25. S.    [_He takes a look._] Well, if this isn't that swindler Mathura. And  here is the poor saintly shampooer; a saint to be sure,        Who does not hang with bended head        Rigid till set of sun,      Who does not rub his back with sand        Till boils begin to run,      Whose shins dogs may not browse upon,        As they pass him in their rambling.[42]      Why should this tall and dainty man        Be so in love with gambling?                               12    Well, I must pacify Mathura. [_He approaches._] How do you do,  Mathura? [_Mathura returns the greeting._]    _Darduraka._ What does this mean?    _Mathura._ He owes me ten gold-pieces.    _Darduraka._ A mere bagatelle!    _Mathura._ [_Pulling the rolled-up cloak from under Darduraka's  arm._] Look, gentlemen, look! The man in the ragged cloak calls  ten gold-pieces a mere bagatelle.    _Darduraka._ My good fool, don't I risk ten gold-pieces on a cast  of the dice? Suppose a man has money--is that any reason why  he should put it in his bosom and show it? But you,        You'll lose your caste, you'll lose your soul,      For ten gold-pieces that he stole,      To kill a man that's sound and whole,        With five good senses in him.                              13    _Mathura._ Ten gold-pieces may be a mere bagatelle to you, sir. To  me they are a fortune.    _Darduraka._ Well then, listen to me. Just give him ten more, and  let him go to gambling again.    _Mathura._ And what then?    _Darduraka._ If he wins, he will pay you.    P. 63.12]    _Mathura._ And if he doesn't win?    _Darduraka._ Then he won't pay you.    _Mathura._ This is no time for nonsense. If you say that, you can  give him the money yourself. My name is Mathura. I'm a swindler  and I play a crooked game, and I'm not afraid of anybody. You  are an immoral scoundrel.    _Darduraka._ Who did you say was immoral?    _Mathura._ You're immoral.    _Darduraka._ Your father is immoral. [_He gives the shampooer a  sign to escape._]    _Mathura._ You cur! That is just the way that you gamble.    _Darduraka._ That is the way I gamble?    _Mathura._ Come, shampooer, pay me my ten gold-pieces.    _Shampooer._ I'll pay you this very day. I'll pay at once. [_Mathura  drags him about._]    _Darduraka._ Fool! You may maltreat him when I am away, but  not before my eyes.    [_Mathura seizes the shampooer and hits him on the nose. The shampooer  bleeds, faints, and falls flat. Darduraka approaches and interferes.  Mathura strikes Darduraka, and Darduraka strikes back._]    _Mathura._ Oh, oh, you accursed hound! But I'll pay you for this.    _Darduraka._ My good fool, I was walking peaceably along the  street, and you struck me. If you strike me to-morrow in court,  then you will open your eyes.    _Mathura._ Yes, I'll open my eyes.    _Darduraka._ How will you open your eyes?    _Mathura._ [_Opening his eyes wide._] This is the way I'll open my  eyes.    [_Darduraka throws dust in Mathura's eyes, and gives the shampooer  a sign to escape. Mathura shuts his eyes and falls down. The shampooer  escapes._]    [35.20. S.    _Darduraka._ [_Aside._] I have made an enemy of the influential  gambling-master Mathura. I had better not stay here. Besides, my  good friend Sharvilaka told me that a young herdsman named  Aryaka has been designated by a soothsayer as our future king.  Now everybody in my condition is running after him. I think I  will join myself to him.                               [_Exit._    _Shampooer._ [_Trembles as he walks away and looks about him._] Here  is a house where somebody has left the side-door open. I will go  in. [_He enters and perceives Vasantasena._] Madam, I throw myself  upon your protection.    _Vasantasena._ He who throws himself upon my protection shall be  safe. Close the door, girl. [_The maid does so._]    _Vasantasena._ What do you fear?    _Shampooer._ A creditor, madam.    _Vasantasena._ You may open the door now, girl.    _Shampooer._ [_To himself._] Ah! Her reasons for not fearing a creditor  are in proportion to her innocence. The proverb is right:        The man who knows his strength and bears a load      Proportioned to that strength, not more nor less,      Is safe from stumbling and from sore distress,      Although he wander on a dreary road.                         14    That means me.    _Mathura._ [_Wiping his eyes. To the gambler._] Pay, pay!    _Gambler._ While we were quarreling with Darduraka, sir, the  man escaped.    _Mathura._ I broke that shampooer's nose for him with my fist  Come on! Let's trace him by the blood. [_They do so._]    _Gambler._ He went into Vasantasena's house, sir.    _Mathura._ Then that is the end of the gold-pieces.    _Gambler._ Let's go to court and lodge a complaint.    P. 67.1]    _Mathura._ The swindler would leave the house and escape. No, we  must besiege him and so capture him.           *       *       *       *       *    [_Vasantasena gives Madanika a sign._]    _Madanika._ Whence are you, sir? or who are you, sir? or whose son  are you, sir? or what is your business, sir? or what are you afraid of?    _Shampooer._ Listen, madam. My birthplace is Pataliputra, madam.  I am the son of a householder. I practise the trade of a shampooer.    _Vasantasena._ It is a very dainty art, sir, which you have mastered.    _Shampooer._ Madam, as an art I mastered it. It has now become a  mere trade.    _Madanika._ Your answers are most disconsolate, sir. Pray continue.    _Shampooer._ Yes, madam. When I was at home, I used to hear travelers  tell tales, and I wanted to see new countries, and so I came here. And  when I had come here to Ujjayini, I became the servant of a noble  gentleman. Such a handsome, courteous gentleman! When he gave money  away, he did not boast; when he was injured, he forgot it. To cut a long  story short: he was so courteous that he regarded his own person as the  possession of others, and had compassion on all who sought his  protection.    _Madanika._ Who may it be that adorns Ujjayini with the virtues  which he has stolen from the object of my mistress' desires?    _Vasantasena._ Good, girl, good! I had the same thought in mind.    _Madanika._ But to continue, sir--    _Shampooer._ Madam, he was so compassionate and so generous that  now--    _Vasantasena._ His riches have vanished?    _Shampooer._ I didn't say it. How did you guess it, madam?    _Vasantasena._ What was there to guess? Virtue and money seldom  keep company. In the pools from which men cannot drink there  is so much the more water.    _Madanika._ But sir, what is his name?    [37.23. S.    _Shampooer._ Madam, who does not know the name of this moon  of the whole world? He lives in the merchants' quarter. He whose  name is worthy of all honor is named Charudatta.    _Vasantasena._ [_Joyfully rising from her seat._] Sir, this house is your  own. Give him a seat, girl, and take this fan. The gentleman is  weary. [_Madanika does as she is bid._]    _Shampooer._ [_Aside._] What! so much honor because I mentioned  Charudatta's name? Heaven bless you, Charudatta! You are the  only man in the world who "]]]
