[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24598"],[0,"A Modern History, From the Time of Luther to the Fall of Napoleon (#10)"],[1,"]    When Luther appeared upon the stage, the great monarchies of Europe  had just arisen upon the ruins of those Feudal states which survived  the wreck of Charlemagne's empire.    The Emperor of Germany, of all the monarchs of Europe, had the  greatest claim to the antiquity and dignity of his throne. As  hereditary sovereign of Austria, Styria, Carinthia, and the Tyrol, he  had absolute authority in his feudal provinces; while, as an elected  emperor, he had an indirect influence over Saxony, the Palatinate, the  three archbishoprics of Treves, Mentz, and Cologne, and some  Burgundian territories.    [Sidenote: Spain and France in the Fifteenth Century.]    But the most powerful monarchy, at this time, was probably that of  France; and its capital was the finest city in Europe, and the resort  of the learned and elegant from all parts of Christendom. All  strangers extolled the splendor of the court, the wealth of the  nobles, and the fame of the university. The power of the monarch was  nearly absolute, and a considerable standing army, even then, was  ready to obey his commands.    Spain, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, was ruled by  Ferdinand and Isabella, who, by their marriage, had united the crowns  of Castile and Arragon. The conquest of Granada and the discovery of  America had added greatly to the political importance of Spain, and  laid the foundation of its future greatness under Philip II.    England, from its insular position, had not so much influence in  European politics as the other powers to which allusion has been made,  but it was, nevertheless, a flourishing and united kingdom.  Henry VII., the founder of the house of Tudor, sat on the throne, and  was successful in suppressing the power of the feudal nobility, and in  increasing the royal authority. Kings, in the fifteenth century, were  the best protectors of the people, and aided them in their struggles  against their feudal oppressors. England, however, had made but little  advance in commerce or manufactures, and the people were still rude  and ignorant. The clergy, as in other countries, were the most  intelligent and wealthy portion of the population, and, consequently,  the most influential, although disgraced by many vices.    Italy then, as now, was divided into many independent states, and  distracted by civil and religious dissensions. The duchy of Milan was  ruled by Ludovico Moro, son of the celebrated Francis Sforza. Naples,  called a kingdom, had just been conquered by the French. Florence was  under the sway of the Medici. Venice, whose commercial importance had  begun to decline, was controlled by an oligarchy of nobles. The chair  of St. Peter was filled by pope Alexander VI., a pontiff who has  obtained an infamous immortality by the vices of debauchery, cruelty,  and treachery. The papacy was probably in its most corrupt state, and  those who had the control of its immense patronage, disregarded the  loud call for reformation which was raised in every corner of  Christendom. The popes were intent upon securing temporal as well as  spiritual power, and levied oppressive taxes on both their spiritual  and temporal subjects.    The great northern kingdoms of Europe, which are now so  considerable,--Russia, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway,--did not, at the  beginning of the sixteenth century, attract much attention. They were  plunged in barbarism and despotism, and the light of science or  religion rarely penetrated into the interior. The monarchs were  sensual and cruel, the nobles profligate and rapacious, the clergy  ignorant and corrupt, and the people degraded, and yet insensible to  their degradation, with no aspirations for freedom and no appreciation  of the benefits of civilization. Such heroes as Peter and Gustavus  Adolphus had not yet appeared. Nor were these northern nations  destined to be immediately benefited by the impulse which the  reformation gave, with the exception of Sweden, then the most powerful  of these kingdoms.    The Greek empire became extinct when Constantinople was taken by the  Turks, in 1453. On its ruins, the Ottoman power was raised. At the  close of the fifteenth century, the Turkish arms were very powerful,  and Europe again trembled before the Moslems. Greece and the whole of  Western Asia were obedient to the sultan. But his power did not reach  its culminating point until a century afterwards.    Such were the various states of Europe when the Reformation broke out.  Maximilian was emperor of Germany, and Charles V. had just inherited,  from his father, Philip the Fair, who had married a daughter of  Ferdinand and Isabella, the kingdom of Spain, in addition to the  dominion of the Netherlands.    By the death of Maximilian, in 1519, the youthful sovereign of Spain  and the Netherlands came into possession of the Austrian dominions;  and the electors, shortly after, chose him emperor of Germany.    He was born at Ghent, A. D. 1500, and was educated with great care. He  early displayed his love of government, and, at fifteen, was present  at the deliberations of the cabinet. But he had no taste for learning,  and gave but few marks of that genius which he afterwards evinced. He  was much attached to his Flemish subjects, and, during the first year  of his reign, gave great offence to the grandees of Spain and the  nobles of Germany by his marked partiality for those men who had been  his early companions.    It is difficult to trace, in the career of Charles V., any powerful  motives of conduct, separate from the desire of aggrandizement. The  interests of the church, with which he was identified, and the true  welfare of his subjects, were, at different times, sacrificed to his  ambition. Had there been no powerful monarchs on the other thrones of  Europe, his dreams of power might possibly have been realized. But at  this period there happened to be a constellation of princes.    [Sidenote: Wars between Charles and Francis.]    The greatest of these, and the chief rival through life of Charles,  was Francis I. of France. He had even anticipated an election to the  imperial crown, which would have made him more powerful than even  Charles himself. The electors feared both, and chose Frederic of  Saxony; but he declined the dangerous post. Charles, as Archduke of  Austria, had such great and obvious claims, that they could not be  disregarded. He was therefore the fortunate candidate. But his  election was a great disappointment to Francis, and he could not  conceal his mortification. Peace could not long subsist between two  envious and ambitious princes. Francis was nearly of the same age as  Charles, had inherited nearly despotic power, was free from financial  embarrassments, and ruled over an united and loyal people. He was  therefore no contemptible match for Charles. In addition, he  strengthened himself by alliances with the Swiss and Venetians.  Charles sought the favor of the pope and Henry VIII. of England. The  real causes of war were mutual jealousies, and passion for military  glory. The assigned causes were, that Charles did not respect the  claims of Francis as king of Naples; and, on the other hand, that  Francis had seized the duchy of Milan, which was a fief of the empire,  and also retained the duchy of Burgundy, the patrimonial inheritance  of the emperor.    The political history of Europe, for nearly half a century, is a  record of the wars between these powerful princes, of their mutual  disasters, disappointments, and successes. Other contests were  involved in these, and there were also some which arose from causes  independent of mutual jealousy, such as the revolt of the Spanish  grandees, of the peasants in Germany, and of the invasion of the  empire by the Turks. During the reign of Charles, was also the  division of the princes of Germany, on grounds of religion--the  foundation of the contest which, after the death of Charles, convulsed  Germany for thirty years. But the Thirty Years' War was a religious  war--was one of the political consequences of the Reformation. The  wars between Charles and Francis were purely wars of military  ambition. Charles had greater territories and larger armies; but  Francis had more money, and more absolute control over his forces.  Charles's power was checked in Spain by the free spirit of the Cortes,  and in Germany by the independence of the princes, and by the  embarrassing questions which arose out of the Reformation.    It would be tedious to read the various wars between Charles and his  rival. Each of them gained, at different times, great successes, and  each experienced, in turn, the most humiliating reverses. Francis was  even taken prisoner at the battle of Pavia, in 1525, and confined in a  fortress at Madrid, until he promised to the victors the complete  dismemberment of France--an extorted promise he never meant to keep.  No sooner had he recovered his liberty, than he violated all his  oaths, and Europe was again the scene of fresh hostilities. The  passion of revenge was now added to that of ambition, and, as the pope  had favored the cause of Francis, the generals of Charles invaded  Italy. Rome was taken and sacked by the constable Bourbon, a French  noble whom Francis had slighted, and cruelties and outrages were  perpetrated by the imperial forces which never disgraced Alaric or  Attila.    Charles affected to be filled with grief in view of the victories of  his generals, and pretended that they acted without his orders. He  employed every artifice to deceive indignant Christendom, and  appointed prayers and processions throughout Spain for the recovery of  the pope's liberty, which one stroke of his pen could have secured.  Thus it was, that the most Catholic and bigoted prince in Europe  seized the pope's person, and sacked his city, at the very time when  Luther was prosecuting his reform. And this fact shows how much more  powerfully the emperor was influenced by political, than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24614"],[0,"The Science of Fairy Tales (#10)"],[1,"to have been down  there. Her object had been to visit her brother, who had recently died.  To do this she perfumed herself with water in which a dead rat had been  steeped, so as to give herself a death-like smell. She then pulled up a  bird's nest and descended through the hole thus made. Her brother, whom  of course she found, cautioned her to eat nothing, and by taking his  advice she was able to return. A similar tale is told of a New Zealand  woman of rank, who was lucky enough to come back from the abode of  departed spirits by the assistance of her father and his repeated  commands to avoid tasting the disgusting food of the dead. Waeinaemoeinen,  the epic hero of the Finns, determined to penetrate to Manala, the  region of the dead. We need not follow in detail his voyage; it will  suffice to say that on his arrival, after a long parley with the maiden  daughter of Tuoni, the king of the island, beer was brought to him in a  two-eared tankard.        \"Waeinaemoeinen, old and trusty,      Gaz'd awhile upon the tankard;      Lo! within it frogs were spawning,      Worms about its sides were laying.      Words in this wise then he utter'd:      'Not to drink have I come hither      From the tankard of Manala,      Not to empty Tuoni's beaker;      They who drink of beer are drowned,      Those who drain the can are ruin'd.'\"[22]    The hero's concluding words might form a motto for our teetotallers; and  in any case his abstinence enabled him to succeed in his errand and  return. A point is made in the poem of the loathsome character of the  beverage offered him, which thus agrees with the poison referred to in  some of the narratives I have previously cited. The natives of the  Southern Seas universally represent the sustenance of spirits as filthy  and abominable. A most remarkable coincidence with the description of  Tuoni's beer occurs in a curious story told on one of the Hervey  Islands, concerning a Mangaian Dante. Being apparently near death, this  man directed that, as soon as the breath was out of his body, a  cocoa-nut should be cracked, and its kernel disengaged from the shell  and placed upon his stomach under the grave-clothes. Having descended  to the Shades, he beheld Miru, the horrible hag who rules them, and  whose deformities need not now be detailed. She commanded him to draw  near. \"The trembling human spirit obeyed, and sat down before Miru.  According to her unvarying practice she set for her intended victim a  bowl of food, and bade him eat it quite up. Miru, with evident anxiety,  waited to see him swallow it. As Tekanae took up the bowl, to his horror  he found it to consist of living centipedes. The quick-witted mortal now  recollected the cocoa-nut kernel at the pit of his stomach, and hidden  from Miru's view by his clothes. With one hand he held the bowl to his  lips, as if about to swallow its contents; with the other he secretly  held the cocoa-nut kernel, and ate it--the bowl concealing the nut from  Miru. It was evident to the goddess that Tekanae was actually swallowing  _something_: what else could it be but the contents of the fatal bowl?  Tekanae craftily contrived whilst eating the nourishing cocoa-nut to  allow the live centipedes to fall on the ground one or two at a time. As  the intended victim was all the time sitting on the ground it was no  difficult achievement in this way to empty the bowl completely by the  time he had finished the cocoa-nut. Miru waited in vain to see her  intended victim writhing in agony and raging with thirst. Her practice  on such occasions was to direct the tortured victim-spirit to dive in a  lake close by, to seek relief. None that dived into that water ever came  up alive; excessive anguish and quenchless thirst so distracting their  thoughts that they were invariably drowned. Miru would afterwards cook  and eat her victims at leisure. Here was a new event in her history: the  bowl of living centipedes had been disposed of, and yet Tekanae  manifested no sign of pain, no intention to leap into the cooling, but  fatal, waters. Long did Miru wait; but in vain. At last she said to her  visitor, 'Return to the upper world' (_i.e._, to life). 'Only remember  this--do not speak against me to mortals. Reveal not my ugly form and  my mode of treating my visitors. Should you be so foolish as to do so,  you will certainly at some future time come back to my domains, and I  will see to it that you do not escape my vengeance a second time!'  Tekanae accordingly left the Shades, and came back to life\"; but he, it  is needless to say, carefully disregarded the hag's injunction, or we  should not have had the foregoing veracious account of what happens  below.[23]    The tortures reserved for Miru's victims cast a weird light on the  warning in the Picard story against eating and drinking what the devil  may offer. But whether poisoning in the latter case would have been the  preliminary to a hearty meal to be made off the unlucky youth by his  treacherous host, or no, it is impossible to determine. What the tales  do suggest, however, is that the food buried with the dead by  uncivilized tribes may be meant to provide them against the contingency  of having to partake of the hospitality of the Shades, and so afford  them a chance of escaping back to the upper air. But, putting this  conjecture aside, we have found the supposition that to eat of fairy  food is to return no more, equally applicable to the world of the dead  as to Fairyland. In seeking its meaning, therefore, we must not be  satisfied without an explanation that will fit both. Almost all over the  earth the rite of hospitality has been held to confer obligations on its  recipient, and to unite him by special ties to the giver. And even where  the notion of hospitality does not enter, to join in a common meal has  often been held to symbolize, if not to constitute, union of a very  sacred kind. The formation of blood relationship, or brotherhood, and  formal adoption into a tribe or family (ceremonies well known in the  lower culture), are usually, if not always, cemented in this way. The  modern wedding breakfast, with its bridecake, is a survival from a very  ancient mode of solemnizing the closest tie of all; and when Proserpine  tasted a pomegranate she partook of a fruit of a specially symbolic  character to signify acceptance of her new destiny as her captor's wife.  Hence to partake of food in the land of spirits, whether they are human  dead, or fairies, is to proclaim one's union with them and to renounce  the fellowship of mortals.    The other point emphasized in the Swedish tales quoted just now is the  Troll's gratitude, as evidenced by his gifts to the successful midwife.  Before considering this, however, let us note that these supernatural  beings do not like to be imposed upon. A German midwife who was summoned  by a Waterman, or Nix, to aid a woman in labour, was told by the latter:  \"I am a Christian woman as well as you; and I was carried off by a  Waterman, who changed me. When my husband comes in now and offers you  money, take no more from him than you usually get, or else he will twist  your neck. Take good care!\" And in another tale, told at Kemnitz of the  Nicker, as he is there called, when he asks the midwife how much he owes  her, she answers that she will take no more from him than from other  people. \"That's lucky for thee,\" he replies; \"hadst thou demanded more,  it would have gone ill with thee!\" But for all that he gave her an apron  full of gold and brought her safely home.[24]    A Pomeranian story marks the transition to a type of tale wherein one  special characteristic of elfin gifts is presented. For in this case,  when the mannikin asked the midwife what her charge was, she modestly  replied: \"Oh, nothing; the little trouble I have had does not call for  any payment.\" \"Now then, lift up thy apron!\" answered he; and it was  quickly filled with the rubbish that lay in the corner of the room.  Taking his lantern, the elf then politely guided her home. When she  shook out the contents of her apron, lo! it was no rubbish which fell  on the ground, but pure, shining minted gold. Hitherto she and her  father had been very poor; thenceforth they had no more want their whole  lives long. This gift of an object apparently worthless, which turns  out, on the conditions being observed, of the utmost value, is a  commonplace of fairy transactions. It is one of the most obvious  manifestations of superhuman power; and as such it has always been a  favourite incident in the stories of all nations. We have only to do  here with the gift as it appears in the group under analysis; and in  these cases it presents little variety. In a tale told on the lake of  Zug the dwarf fills the woman's apron with something at which he bids  her on no account look before she is in her own house. Her curiosity,  however, is uncontrollable; and the moment the dwarf vanishes she peeps  into her apron, to find simply black coals. She, in a rage, flings them  away, keeping only two as evidence of the shabby treatment she had met  with; but when she got home these two were nothing less than precious  stones. She at once ran back to where she had shaken out the supposed  coals; but they were all gone. So a recompense of straws, dust, birch  leaves, or shavings becomes, as elsewhere told, pure gold, pure silver,  or thalers. Nor is the story confined to Europe. In Dardistan it is  related that a boy, taken down by a Yatsh, or demon, into an underground  palace, is allowed to be present at a Yatsh wedding. He finds the  Yatshes assembled in great force and in possession of a number of  valuables belonging to the dwellers in his own village. On his return  his guide presents him with a sack full of coals, which he empties as  soon as he is out of sight. One little piece, however, remains, and is  transformed into a gold coin when he reaches home.[25]    Conversely, when the"]]]
