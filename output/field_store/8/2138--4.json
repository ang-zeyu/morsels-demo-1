Thus far there were only scarcely perceptible  shadows and momentary weaknesses, warning signs of decadence; but when  such signs are evident, decadence is at hand, and that which the virility  of the barbarians had preserved was to be lost through the creed-bound  dignity of an academic China, which was imprisoned in a rigid system of  rules.          VII. THE MING PERIOD--FOURTEENTH TO SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES      The Ming dynasty came into power on the wings of national feeling. China  rallied her forces and expelled the foreign tyrants. Without doubt the  nation cherished the illusion of rebuilding itself upon the model of the  past, and the first emperors of the dynasty believed that the empire could  be re-established upon an unshakable foundation. But the Ming dynasty, in  reality, was but the heir and follower of Yuean. The latter itself had been  only a connecting link. It had changed nothing, but had tended rather to  absorb into the Chinese system the Northern barbarians, who up to that  time had been foreigners. It had unwittingly achieved unity for China,  despite itself and against its own inclination. In the administration of  the empire, it had finished the program of conservation which the Sung  dynasty, through impotence, had been unable to carry to completion.    The Ming dynasty inherited the work of the Mongols and consolidated it. It  survived under their reign and under that of the Ch'ing rulers until the  final disintegration, of which we have but recently seen the results.  The peaceful ideals of the Ming dynasty, the marked predominance of  Confucianism as a code of ethics, with certain modifications by Chu Hsi,  combined to form an ensemble that was apparently perfect and which made it  possible to have faith in the excellence of the principles laid down by  the monarchy. Thus a school was formed which had its own philosophy,  manners and ideals, all of them cold, stiff and without spontaneity. It  was an over-perfect machine which went like clockwork. The world was  judged with a narrow and somewhat stupid self-confidence. The ideal dwelt  in the word of Confucian writings, divorced from their true meaning, and  so badly interpreted that they ceased to be understood aright. The  meticulous, bureaucratic and hieratic administration of the Tartars was a  perfect system of government. The machine was still new and worked well,  whence arose a false impression of permanence which added still further to  the complacency of the conservative mind. An art was necessary to this  China. She had it. It was academic painting.      [Illustration: PLATE XIX. EGRETS BY LIN LIANG    Ming Period. Collection of Mrs. John D. Rockefeller, Junior.]    Side by side with this and yet apart, other influences were at work.  Notwithstanding the prohibition of books on heterodox philosophies in  schools, accompanied by the widespread decadence of Buddhism, and the  complete downfall of Taoism owing to gross practices in popular magic, and  despite the disdain of the official world, another element in China was  preserving the spirit of the past, the restless spirit that craved  novelty. In all probability its obscure workings did not appear  immediately upon the surface, concealed as they were by the strictly  prescribed screen of official China. They were sufficiently strong,  however, to give rise to an art which differed essentially from academic  art, and which numbered masters who were comparable with those of the  past. In spite of adverse circumstances and the weight under which these  movements were buried, they made themselves felt in violent upheavals.  First let us draw a picture of the decadence of an art and later we shall  return to activity and life.    Official painting in the Ming period rapidly stiffened into convention. To  understand how it took shape, we must go back to the time of Hui Tsung and  observe the method of recruiting talent in the Academy which he founded.    That painting was allied to philosophic and poetic thought is already  known. It was always a refined diversion of poets and painters to unite in  a quest for the beautiful. The poet wrote verses and the painter painted a  picture suggesting, sometimes remotely, the thought enshrined in the poem.  Such were the conditions upon which Hui Tsung instituted examinations,  following which the doors of the Academy were open to the victor. He gave,  for example, as subject for a competition a verse saying, \"The bamboos  envelop the inn beyond the bridge,\" which suggested a landscape with  flowing water, a rustic bridge thrown across the stream, a cluster of  bamboos on the bank, a \"winehouse\" half hidden in the verdure. All the  competitors, the records say, set to work drawing with minute care the inn  which they made the essential feature of the picture. Only one implied its  presence by showing, above a dense cluster of bamboos, the little banner  which in China denotes the presence of a \"winehouse.\" Two verses of  another poem in which allusion was made to the red flowers of spring were  interpreted by the representation of a beautiful young girl dressed in  red, leaning on a balustrade, for according to Chinese ideas, the thoughts  of young men in spring turn there, as elsewhere, toward thoughts of love.      [Illustration: PLATE XX. FLOWERS AND INSECTS    Ming Period. Collection of R. Petrucci.]    We have here an example of the subtle allusions, at times profoundly  poetic, with which Chinese painting abounds. But these things retain their  value and charm only in so far as they depend on a free play of mind or  upon personal, living sentiments. As accepted conventions regulated in an  academic competition, repeated with sustained effort and without  enthusiasm, their rigid monotony becomes intolerable. Such was the  ultimate fate of that ability to express by half meanings, to suggest  without directly stating, to which the Sung painters attached so great an  importance. The day it was understood that a little banner fluttering over  bamboos indicated the presence of a \"winehouse\" in a sylvan retreat, or  that a young girl dressed in red symbolized the crimson blooming of a  garden pink in springtime, banners and young girls dressed in red were  seen in paintings innumerable to the point of satiety.    Thus were established those dry conventions of a somewhat stupid erudition  which were so much the fashion in the academic painting of the Ming and  the Ch'ing periods, and whose great success repressed the artistic  aspirations of a people. Under these influences was rapidly assembled a  complete arsenal of allegories, allusions and symbols that gave birth to  an art which was possibly very learned, but which was inartistic to the  last degree. An academician of the Ming period would have thought himself  disgraced if he had not proven by complicated compositions the extent of  his knowledge of things of this character. Art was no longer anything but  a kind of puzzle. Furthermore, the decadence of eye and hand followed that  of the mind, and there next appeared a taste for brilliant colors,  overladen compositions, and fine and meticulous lines, culminating in an  unbearable nicety. The work of the Academy is summed up in these words.    Let us turn aside from an art that is inert. It robbed things of the  creative spirit that animated them. We shall now see what was achieved by  those who followed in the steps of the old masters.    The fifteenth century in China witnessed a continuance of the style  prevalent during the Sung and Yuean periods. Chou Chih-mien, for example,  was true to that profound feeling for form, that delicacy of coloring,  and rhythm in composition which were the endowment of the greatest  masters. Shen Chou belonged entirely to the Yuean school, and to prove that  the old ideals were not dead, we have in the fifteenth century the  magnificent group of painters of the plum tree, with Lu Fu and Wang  Yuean-chang at their head.    As before stated, a special philosophy was associated with this tree and  its flowers. The white petals scattered on vigorous branches had long  typified an inner soul, whose purity was the very likeness of virtue and  of tenderness. Chung Jen, who in the eleventh century wrote a treatise on  the painting of the plum tree, explains in his chapter on \"the derivation  of forms\" that it is a symbol, a concentrated form, a likeness of the  universe. The great fundamental principles mingle harmoniously within it;  they express themselves in its shape and reveal themselves through its  beauty. Similar to this was the philosophy associated with the bamboo,  which endured up to the fifteenth century. The subtle monochromes of Lu Fu  show branches of flowering plum swaying in the breeze. In the great works  of Wang Yuean-chang trunks of old trees, still bearing hardy blossoms,  stand proudly in the magical radiance of the moon. Vibration and power,  grandeur and majesty, such are the qualities which were still sought  amidst the severe conditions imposed by the use of black and white. Here  we feel that the creative force is not yet spent. We find it equally  fresh and vigorous in the ink bamboos of Wen Cheng-ming in the sixteenth  century.    In landscape, however, new elements appear which mark a decline. I have  already laid stress on the overladen composition which developed in the  Yuean epoch. This was still more noticeable in the Ming period. When  pictorial art has had a long series of masters, a certain eclecticism is  infallibly produced. This leads to the rejection of the direct study of  nature, in favor of viewing it only through the eyes of the old masters.  This phenomenon appeared in China as well as in Europe. The landscape  painters of the Ming period studied the technique of the T'ang and the  Sung epochs and codified their system of lines, arranging them in series  according to types and schools; in short, they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/223"],[0,"The Wisdom of Father Brown (#10)"],[1,"his country by misleading the foreigner.  Suppose this brought him into spy circles, and little loans were made  to him, and little ties tied on to him. Suppose he kept up his  contradictory position in a confused way by never telling the foreign  spies the truth, but letting it more and more be guessed. The better  part of him (what was left of it) would still say: 'I have not helped  the enemy; I said it was the left drawer.' The meaner part of him would  already be saying: 'But they may have the sense to see that means the  right.' I think it is psychologically possible--in an enlightened age,  you know.\"    \"It may be psychologically possible,\" answered Flambeau, \"and it  certainly would explain Dreyfus being certain he was wronged and his  judges being sure he was guilty. But it won't wash historically, because  Dreyfus's document (if it was his document) was literally correct.\"    \"I wasn't thinking of Dreyfus,\" said Father Brown.    Silence had sunk around them with the emptying of the tables; it was  already late, though the sunlight still clung to everything, as if  accidentally entangled in the trees. In the stillness Flambeau shifted  his seat sharply--making an isolated and echoing noise--and threw his  elbow over the angle of it. \"Well,\" he said, rather harshly, \"if Hirsch  is not better than a timid treason-monger...\"    \"You mustn't be too hard on them,\" said Father Brown gently. \"It's not  entirely their fault; but they have no instincts. I mean those things  that make a woman refuse to dance with a man or a man to touch an  investment. They've been taught that it's all a matter of degree.\"    \"Anyhow,\" cried Flambeau impatiently, \"he's not a patch on my principal;  and I shall go through with it. Old Dubosc may be a bit mad, but he's a  sort of patriot after all.\"    Father Brown continued to consume whitebait.    Something in the stolid way he did so caused Flambeau's fierce black  eyes to ramble over his companion afresh. \"What's the matter with you?\"  Flambeau demanded. \"Dubosc's all right in that way. You don't doubt  him?\"    \"My friend,\" said the small priest, laying down his knife and fork in a  kind of cold despair, \"I doubt everything. Everything, I mean, that has  happened today. I doubt the whole story, though it has been acted before  my face. I doubt every sight that my eyes have seen since morning. There  is something in this business quite different from the ordinary police  mystery where one man is more or less lying and the other man more or  less telling the truth. Here both men.... Well! I've told you the only  theory I can think of that could satisfy anybody. It doesn't satisfy  me.\"    \"Nor me either,\" replied Flambeau frowning, while the other went on  eating fish with an air of entire resignation. \"If all you can suggest  is that notion of a message conveyed by contraries, I call it uncommonly  clever, but...well, what would you call it?\"    \"I should call it thin,\" said the priest promptly. \"I should call it  uncommonly thin. But that's the queer thing about the whole business.  The lie is like a schoolboy's. There are only three versions, Dubosc's  and Hirsch's and that fancy of mine. Either that note was written by  a French officer to ruin a French official; or it was written by the  French official to help German officers; or it was written by the French  official to mislead German officers. Very well. You'd expect a secret  paper passing between such people, officials or officers, to look  quite different from that. You'd expect, probably a cipher, certainly  abbreviations; most certainly scientific and strictly professional  terms. But this thing's elaborately simple, like a penny dreadful: 'In  the purple grotto you will find the golden casket.' It looks as if... as  if it were meant to be seen through at once.\"    Almost before they could take it in a short figure in French uniform  had walked up to their table like the wind, and sat down with a sort of  thump.    \"I have extraordinary news,\" said the Duc de Valognes. \"I have just come  from this Colonel of ours. He is packing up to leave the country, and he  asks us to make his excuses sur le terrain.\"    \"What?\" cried Flambeau, with an incredulity quite  frightful--\"apologize?\"    \"Yes,\" said the Duke gruffly; \"then and there--before everybody--when  the swords are drawn. And you and I have to do it while he is leaving  the country.\"    \"But what can this mean?\" cried Flambeau. \"He can't be afraid of that  little Hirsch! Confound it!\" he cried, in a kind of rational rage;  \"nobody could be afraid of Hirsch!\"    \"I believe it's some plot!\" snapped Valognes--\"some plot of the Jews and  Freemasons. It's meant to work up glory for Hirsch...\"    The face of Father Brown was commonplace, but curiously contented; it  could shine with ignorance as well as with knowledge. But there was  always one flash when the foolish mask fell, and the wise mask fitted  itself in its place; and Flambeau, who knew his friend, knew that his  friend had suddenly understood. Brown said nothing, but finished his  plate of fish.    \"Where did you last see our precious Colonel?\" asked Flambeau,  irritably.    \"He's round at the Hotel Saint Louis by the Elysee, where we drove with  him. He's packing up, I tell you.\"    \"Will he be there still, do you think?\" asked Flambeau, frowning at the  table.    \"I don't think he can get away yet,\" replied the Duke; \"he's packing to  go a long journey...\"    \"No,\" said Father Brown, quite simply, but suddenly standing up, \"for a  very short journey. For one of the shortest, in fact. But we may still  be in time to catch him if we go there in a motor-cab.\"    Nothing more could be got out of him until the cab swept round the  corner by the Hotel Saint Louis, where they got out, and he led the  party up a side lane already in deep shadow with the growing dusk. Once,  when the Duke impatiently asked whether Hirsch was guilty of treason or  not, he answered rather absently: \"No; only of ambition--like Caesar.\"  Then he somewhat inconsequently added: \"He lives a very lonely life; he  has had to do everything for himself.\"    \"Well, if he's ambitious, he ought to be satisfied now,\" said Flambeau  rather bitterly. \"All Paris will cheer him now our cursed Colonel has  turned tail.\"    \"Don't talk so loud,\" said Father Brown, lowering his voice, \"your  cursed Colonel is just in front.\"    The other two started and shrank farther back into the shadow of the  wall, for the sturdy figure of their runaway principal could indeed be  seen shuffling along in the twilight in front, a bag in each hand. He  looked much the same as when they first saw him, except that he had  changed his picturesque mountaineering knickers for a conventional pair  of trousers. It was clear he was already escaping from the hotel.    The lane down which they followed him was one of those that seem to  be at the back of things, and look like the wrong side of the stage  scenery. A colourless, continuous wall ran down one flank of it,  interrupted at intervals by dull-hued and dirt-stained doors, all shut  fast and featureless save for the chalk scribbles of some passing  gamin. The tops of trees, mostly rather depressing evergreens, showed  at intervals over the top of the wall, and beyond them in the grey and  purple gloaming could be seen the back of some long terrace of tall  Parisian houses, really comparatively close, but somehow looking as  inaccessible as a range of marble mountains. On the other side of the  lane ran the high gilt railings of a gloomy park.    Flambeau was looking round him in rather a weird way. \"Do you know,\" he  said, \"there is something about this place that--\"    \"Hullo!\" called out the Duke sharply; \"that fellow's disappeared.  Vanished, like a blasted fairy!\"    \"He has a key,\" explained their clerical friend. \"He's only gone into  one of these garden doors,\" and as he spoke they heard one of the dull  wooden doors close again with a click in front of them.    Flambeau strode up to the door thus shut almost in his face, and stood  in front of it for a moment, biting his black moustache in a fury of  curiosity. Then he threw up his long arms and swung himself aloft like  a monkey and stood on the top of the wall, his enormous figure dark  against the purple sky, like the dark tree-tops.    The Duke looked at the priest. \"Dubosc's escape is more elaborate than  we thought,\" he said; \"but I suppose he is escaping from France.\"    \"He is escaping from everywhere,\" answered Father Brown.    Valognes's eyes brightened, but his voice sank. \"Do you mean suicide?\"  he asked.    \"You will not find his body,\" replied the other.    A kind of cry came from Flambeau on the wall above. \"My God,\" he  exclaimed in French, \"I know what this place is now! Why, it's the back  of the street where old Hirsch lives. I thought I could recognize the  back of a house as well as the back of a man.\"    \"And Dubosc's gone in there!\" cried the Duke, smiting his hip. \"Why,  they'll meet after all!\" And with sudden Gallic vivacity he hopped up on  the wall beside Flambeau and sat there positively kicking his legs with  excitement. The priest alone remained below, leaning against the wall,  with his back to the whole theatre of events, and looking wistfully  across to the park palings and the twinkling, twilit trees.    The Duke, however stimulated, had the instincts of an aristocrat, and  desired rather to stare at the house than to spy on it; but Flambeau,  who had the instincts of a burglar (and a detective), had already swung  himself from the wall into the fork of a straggling tree from which he  could crawl quite close to the only illuminated window in the back of  the high dark house. A red blind had been pulled down over the light,  but pulled crookedly, so that it gaped on one side, and by risking his  neck along a branch that looked as treacherous as a twig, Flambeau  could just see Colonel Dubosc walking about in a brilliantly-"]]]
