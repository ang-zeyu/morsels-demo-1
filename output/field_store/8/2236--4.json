[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24717"],[0,"Danger! A True History of a Great City's Wiles and Temptations (#10)"],[1,"this preface we shall now introduce the reader to the inside of one  of these concert saloons, and show him the pretty waiter girl as his  fancy pictures her, and as she really is: Chancing to walk along the  street, the ears are assailed by the clash of music emanating from some  basement, down perhaps a half a dozen steps. A number of red globes,  surrounding as many gas jets, serve to show the entrance, on either side  of which are full length paintings of women in short skirts. The door is  of green leather or oil-cloth. Pushing this open, we enter and seat  ourselves at one of the many round tables with which the place is  plentifully supplied. In a second--not longer--several girls are beside  us, and some sit down at our table. One--perhaps two at once--will  immediately ask if we are not going to treat, and, in response, drinks  are ordered. While one of the girls proceeds to supply the order, and  before the drinks are brought, we glance around the saloon. On one side  is the bar, at which several persons are standing, drinking with some of  the sweet-voiced houris. The barkeeper and proprietor, both in their  shirt sleeves, are behind it. On one side of the bar is a  slightly-raised platform, upon which is a piano-player, a violinist and  a shrill fifer. This is the music that charms and attracts. Around the  room are men of all kinds, sailors, laboring men, seedy individuals,  lovers, thieves, a few poor gamblers, fellows in hard luck and waiting  for \"something to turn up.\" Sprinkled over the place, talking, laughing,  joking and striving to induce them to buy drinks, are a number of the  waiter girls. The floor is plentifully and generously covered with plain  sawdust, which answers the double purpose of effectually hiding the  large cracks, and of absorbing the expectorations and spilled beer. The  time is yet early and business is not very brisk, so we chat with the  prettiest and youngest of the girls for a second only, when we are again  importuned to drink by another of the fair ones, even before the first  round is brought, for it must be understood that only the girl ordering  the drinks gets any percentage. The drinks brought, the price is asked  and the amount paid, as follows: Two beers, two lemonades with a stick  in it for two girls, and two brandies for two others; total, one dollar  and forty cents. Now the girls don't drink brandy, they have a little  colored water, but they charge for brandy all the same, and pay the  proprietor in pasteboard tickets, which are supplied by him to the girls  in packages of five dollars worth and upwards. For that which she  charged one dollar and forty cents she pays in checks forty cents, thus  making a clear one dollar--five cents each for two beers, ten cents each  for lemonades, and five cents each for the colored water. The customer  pays ten cents for each glass of beer, twenty cents each for lemonade  and forty cents each for brandy. When the customer fails to call for  drinks fast enough to suit the girls, they will leave for some other  table where they may be more liberally patronized. It is getting later,  and as we are about to leave, an unsteady and heavy foot is heard  descending the steps outside, the doors are pushed violently open and a  big, burly man reels into the place. He is not entirely intoxicated, but  just enough so not to care for anything or anybody, and as he shuffles  independently along he is approached by a couple of girls, who, taking  an arm each, affectionately guide him to a chair. Being seated, he  smiles benignly upon his fair captors and asks them to drink. He is  evidently, from his dress, a successful butcher or saloon-keeper and has  plenty of money about him. The drinks brought, he takes a roll of money  from his pocket, and, thinking it is a five-dollar bill, gives a  fifty-dollar bill to the girl. She immediately leaves and in a few  seconds returns, giving him change for a five, saying quite pleasantly,  \"Here's your change,\" and, as he is about to place it in his pocket,  asks him for \"a quarter for luck.\" Several girls now gather around the  man, and by smiles, caresses, and other affectionate and flattering  demonstrations, finally persuade him into one of the private rooms, when  he is lost to our sight, but we distinctly hear the order, \"bottle of  wine.\"    Soon another man enters very drunk, and, seating himself, is soon  similarly surrounded. In about a minute one of the girls leaves and  whispers to the proprietor, who, emerging from behind his rampart,  catches the unlucky visitor by the collar, and with the aid of a club  compels him to ascend the steps again to the street. The man not having  any money was an unwelcome guest, and they had no use for him.    Several others now enter, many of whom are personally known to the  girls, and mutual glances of recognition pass between them. These pass  on down to the further and privileged part of the place and are lost to  view. The den is now pretty full and business is brisk. The bartender  and proprietor are hurriedly passing out ordered drinks. The girls are  flying around, executing orders and pocketing change. The piano-player  bangs and thumps his hideously-wiry instrument. Glasses are clinking,  chairs and tables moving, and altogether there is a discordant tumult  well calculated to bewilder the coolest kind of a head.    Suddenly there is a scream--a piercing scream. Everybody starts and  looks towards the spot from whence it proceeded. One of the girls  quickly says, \"Oh, it's nothing, Jimmy is only licking Hattie.\" The  lover has only beaten the poor creature who is supporting him, and,  strange as it may appear, she will think all the more of him for this  brutality. It is a pretty generally known fact, so far as females of  this class are concerned, that if a man occasionally severely beats his  mistress, she regards it as a proof that he entertains for her an ardent  affection. It is now getting late, and several of the girls are leaving  for home with their new-made male friends, and indications point towards  the place being closed for the night. The butcher comes forth from his  \"private room,\" followed by a number of the girls who have been his  companions, and is led to the door and assisted out. We leave also, and  as we ascend the steps to the street we discover our butcher in the  hands of a policeman who is dragging him off to the station, where we  shall leave him for the night.    Now, most of these girls live in what are called furnished rooms, and it  is to those that they take their male friends when they leave the  saloon, stopping on the way, of course, for \"supper.\" In some cases the  girls are panel thieves--but that is rare. In nearly all cases they have  lovers and generally provide home comforts for their masters, but in all  cases they are for hire. The nature of the business they follow demands  their attention at night, so that they sleep nearly all the day. The  great majority of them are veritable thieves. To drug a man who carries  money, or ply him with liquor until he is unconscious and then rob him  of all he has, is a very common proceeding, particularly when afterwards  he is put out on the street and left, when the chances are more than a  hundred to one that he neither recollects the place where he was nor the  girl who stole his money or his valuables. The proprietor, if he can,  divides the stolen amount with the girl--with the lover always. Many  instances are known of half-intoxicated men leaving valuables with the  bar-tender of some of these places, for supposed security, but when  requested to be returned were met with a denial that the valuables were  ever intrusted to him. With an air of insulted innocence the bartender  declares that he never saw the articles or the man before.    We shall now return to our butcher acquaintance, and follow the incident  to its ending. So we proceed to the Tombs the next morning, and there in  the pen with the other prisoners we find our man. Upon his arraignment  in court he tells the following story, which is the truth _verbatim_:      \"I was wandering through Chatham street, when my attention became  attracted by a bevy of gaudily-dressed girls, who asked me to while away  my spare hours in a concert saloon. Smitten with the charms of the  tempters I was loth to part with them, and after some preliminary  conversation they enticed me to their lair. I had at this time about  five hundred dollars in my possession, and after some hours carousal,  they robbed and sent me away penniless. This is how it was done: I  entered the saloon and was taken to a private room, when I called for  some wine, of which we all partook. I may say here that the wine, so  called, was really nothing but cider. The girls sat on the sofa in this  room with me. We continued to drink and I was the recipient of more  caresses than I ever was before in my life. After the lapse of perhaps  three hours, some of the girls left me, and when I called for more wine,  I found that my money was gone. I was not so drunk at this time that I  could not understand that I had been robbed. I asked for the girls that  had left, and was told that they had gone home. I paid ninety dollars  for wine in this room, but they gave me sometimes cider and whisky  mixed, and then when I became really unconsciously intoxicated they put  me out, after having taken all my money from my clothes.    \"I had made an arrangement to go home with two of the girls, but I  suppose when they saw that some of their number had taken all my money,  they left me. There was a sofa in this room and one of the girls  intimated to me that I had assaulted her and wanted some money. Another  said she could not afford to spend her time there unless she was paid.  Another induced me to give her money to buy a hat, and then when I lost  consciousness they robbed me of all I had, my watch and chain,  scarf-pin, ring and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24726"],[0,"A History of Art for Beginners and Students: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture (#10)"],[1,"drew so perfect a  circle that it was thought to be a miracle, and this gave rise to a  proverb still much used in Italy:--_Piu tondo che l'O di Giotto_, or,  \"Rounder than the O of Giotto.\"    Giotto had a wife and eight children, of whom nothing is known but that  his son Francesco became a painter. Giotto died in 1337, and was buried  with great honors in the Church of Santa Maria del Fiore. Lorenzo de  Medici erected a monument to his memory. The pupils and followers of  Giotto were very numerous, and were called Giotteschi; among these TADDEO  GADDI, and his son AGNOLO, are most famous: others were MASO and BERNARDO  DI DADDO; but I shall not speak in detail of these artists.    While Giotto was making the art of Florence famous, there was an artist in  Siena who raised the school of that city to a place of great honor. This  was SIMONE MARTINI, who lived from 1283 to 1344, and is often called  SIMONE MEMMI because he married a sister of another painter, LIPPO MEMMI.  The most important works of Simone which remain are at Siena in the  Palazzo Pubblico and in the Lower Church at Assisi. There is one  beautiful work of his in the Royal Institution, at Liverpool, which  illustrates the text, \"Behold, thy father and I have sought Thee,  sorrowing.\"    While the Papal court was at Avignon, in 1338, Simone removed to that  city. Here he became the friend of Petrarch and of Laura, and has been  praised by this poet as Giotto was by Dante.    Another eminent Florentine artist was ANDREA ORCAGNA, as he is called,  though his real name was ANDREA ARCAGNUOLO DI CIONE. He was born about  1329, and died about 1368. It has long been the custom to attribute to  Orcagna some of the most important frescoes in the Campo Santo at Pisa;  but it is so doubtful whether he worked there that I shall not speak of  them. His father was a goldsmith, and Orcagna first studied his father's  craft; he was also an architect, sculptor, mosaist, and poet, as well as a  painter. He made an advance in color and in the painting of atmosphere  that gives him high rank as a painter; as a sculptor, his tabernacle in  the Church of Or San Michele speaks his praise. Mr. C. C. Perkins thus  describes it: \"Built of white marble in the Gothic style, enriched with  every kind of ornament, and storied with bas-reliefs illustrative of the  Madonna's history from her birth to her death, it rises in stately beauty  toward the roof of the church, and, whether considered from an  architectural, sculptural, or symbolic point of view, must excite the  warmest admiration in all who can appreciate the perfect unity of  conception through which its bas-reliefs, statuettes, busts, intaglios,  mosaics, and incrustations of _pietre dure_, gilded glass, and enamels are  welded into a unique whole.\"    But perhaps it is as an architect that Orcagna is most interesting to us,  for he it was who made the designs for the Loggia de Lanzi in Florence.  This was built as a place for public assembly, and the discussion of the  topics of the day in rainy weather; it received its name on account of  its nearness to the German guard-house which was called that of the  Landsknechts (in German), or Lanzi, as it was given in Italian. Orcagna  probably died before the Loggia was completed, and his brother Bernardo  succeeded him as architect of the commune. This Loggia is one of the most  interesting places in Florence, fully in sight of the Palazzo Signoria,  near the gallery of the Uffizi, and itself the storehouse of precious  works of sculpture.    There were also in these early days of the fourteenth century schools of  art at Bologna and Modena; but we know so little of them in detail that I  shall not attempt to give any account of them here, but will pass to the  early artists who may be said to belong to the true Renaissance in Italy.          CHAPTER III.    PAINTING IN ITALY, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE RENAISSANCE  TO THE PRESENT CENTURY.      The reawakening of Art in Italy which followed the darkness of the Middle  Ages, dates from about the beginning of the fifteenth century and is  called the Renaissance. The Italians have a method of reckoning the  centuries which differs from ours. Thus we call 1800 the first year of the  nineteenth century, but they call it the first of the eighteenth; so the  painters of what was to us the fifteenth century are called by Italians  the \"_quattrocentisti_,\" or men of the fourteenth century, and while to us  the term \"_cinquecento_\" means the style of the sixteenth century, to the  Italians the same century, which begins with 1500, is the fifteenth  century.    I shall use our own method of reckoning in my writing; but this fact  should be known to all who read or study art.    The first painter of whom I shall now speak is known to us as FRA  ANGELICO. His name was Guido, the son of Pietro, and he was born at  Vicchio in the province of Mugello, in the year 1387. We know that his  family was in such circumstances that the young Guido could have led a  life of ease; but he early determined to become a preaching friar.  Meantime, even as a boy, he showed his taste for art, and there are six  years in his life, from the age of fourteen to twenty, of which no one can  tell the story. However, from what followed it is plain that during this  time he must somewhere have devoted himself to the study of painting and  to preparation for his life as a monk.    Before he was fully twenty years old, he entered the convent at Fiesole,  and took the name of Fra, or Brother Giovanni; soon after, his elder  brother joined him there, and became Fra Benedetto. Later on our artist  was called Fra Angelico, and again _Il Beato Angelico_, and then,  according to Italian custom, the name of the town from which he came was  added, so that he was at last called _Il Beato Giovanni, detto Angelico,  da Fiesole_, which means, \"The Blessed John, called the Angelic, of  Fiesole.\" The title _Il Beato_ is usually conferred by the church, but it  was given to Fra Angelico by the people, because of his saintly character  and works.    It was in 1407 that Fra Angelico was admitted to the convent in Fiesole,  and after seven years of peaceful life there he was obliged to flee with  his companions to Foligno. It was at the time when three different popes  claimed the authority over the Church of Rome, and the city of Florence  declared itself in favor of Alexander V.; but the monks of Fiesole adhered  to Gregory XII., and for this reason were driven from their convent. Six  years they dwelt at Foligno; then the plague broke out in the country  about them, and again they fled to Cortona. Pictures painted by Fra  Angelico at this time still remain in the churches of Cortona.    After an absence of ten years the monks returned to Fiesole, where our  artist passed the next eighteen years. This was the richest period of his  life: his energy was untiring, and his zeal both as an artist and as a  priest burned with a steady fire. His works were sought for far and wide,  and most of his easel-pictures were painted during this time. Fra Angelico  would never accept the money which was paid for his work; it was given  into the treasury of his convent; neither did he accept any commission  without the consent of the prior. Naturally, the monk-artist executed  works for the adornment of his own convent. Some of these have been sold  and carried to other cities and countries, and those which remain have  been too much injured and too much restored to be considered important  now.    [Illustration: FIG. 31.--FRA ANGELICO. _From the representation of him in  the fresco of the \"Last Judgment,\" by Fra Bartolommeo, in Santa Maria  Nuova, Florence._]    He painted so many pictures during this second residence at Fiesole, not  only for public places, but for private citizens, that Vasari wrote: \"This  Father painted so many pictures, which are dispersed through the houses of  the Florentines, that sometimes I am lost in wonder when I think how works  so good and so many could, though in the course of many years, have been  brought to perfection by one man alone.\"    In 1436 the great Cosimo de Medici insisted that the monks of Fiesole  should again leave their convent, and remove to that of San Marco, in  Florence. Most unwillingly the brethren submitted, and immediately Cosimo  set architects and builders to work to erect a new convent, for the old  one was in a ruinous state. The new cloisters offered a noble field to the  genius of Fra Angelico, and he labored for their decoration with his whole  soul; though the rule of the order was so strict that the pictures in the  cells could be seen only by the monks, he put all his skill into them, and  labored as devotedly as if the whole world could see and praise them, as  indeed has since been done. His pictures in this convent are so numerous  that we must not describe them, but will say that the Crucifixion in the  chapter-room is usually called his masterpiece. It is nearly twenty-five  feet square, and, besides the usual figures in this subject, the Saviour  and the thieves, with the executioners, there are holy women, the founders  of various orders, the patrons of the convent, and companies of saints. In  the frame there are medallions with several saints and a Sibyl, each  bearing an inscription from the prophecies relating to Christ's death;  while below all, St. Dominic, the founder of the artist's order, bears a  genealogical tree with many portraits of those who had been eminent among  his followers. For this reason this picture has great historic value.    At last, in 1445, Pope Eugenius IV., who had dedicated the new convent of  San Marco and seen the works of Angelico, summoned him to Rome. It is said  that the Pope not only wished for some of his paintings, but he also  desired to honor Angelico by giving him the archbishopric of Florence; but  when this high position was offered him, Fra Angelico would not accept"]]]
