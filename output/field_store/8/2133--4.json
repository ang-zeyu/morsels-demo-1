To make sure of nothing going wrong, my mother would superintend  the cooking herself. The old mace-bearer, Kinu, with his white livery  and crested turban, on guard at my father's door, would warn us not to  be boisterous in the verandah in front of his rooms during his midday  siesta. We had to walk past quietly, talking in whispers, and dared not  even take a peep inside.    On one occasion my father came home to invest the three of us with the  sacred thread. With the help of Pandit Vedantavagish he had collected  the old Vedic rites for the purpose. For days together we were taught to  chant in correct accents the selections from the Upanishads, arranged by  my father under the name of \"Brahma Dharma,\" seated in the prayer hall  with Becharam Babu. Finally, with shaven heads and gold rings in our  ears, we three budding Brahmins went into a three-days' retreat in a  portion of the third storey.    It was great fun. The earrings gave us a good handle to pull each  other's ears with. We found a little drum lying in one of the rooms;  taking this we would stand out in the verandah, and, when we caught  sight of any servant passing alone in the storey below, we would rap a  tattoo on it. This would make the man look up, only to beat a hasty  retreat the next moment with averted eyes.[21] In short we cannot claim  that these days of our retirement were passed in ascetic meditation.    I am however persuaded that boys like ourselves could not have been rare  in the hermitages of old. And if some ancient document has it that the  ten or twelve-year old Saradwata or Sarngarava[22] is spending the whole  of the days of his boyhood offering oblations and chanting _mantras_, we  are not compelled to put unquestioning faith in the statement; because  the book of Boy Nature is even older and also more authentic.    After we had attained full brahminhood I became very keen on repeating  the _gayatri_.[23] I would meditate on it with great concentration. It  is hardly a text the full meaning of which I could have grasped at that  age. I well remember what efforts I made to extend the range of my  consciousness with the help of the initial invocation of \"Earth,  firmament and heaven.\" How I felt or thought it is difficult to express  clearly, but this much is certain that to be clear about the meaning of  words is not the most important function of the human understanding.    The main object of teaching is not to explain meanings, but to knock at  the door of the mind. If any boy is asked to give an account of what is  awakened in him at such knocking, he will probably say something very  silly. For what happens within is much bigger than what he can express  in words. Those who pin their faith on University examinations as a test  of all educational results take no account of this fact.    I can recollect many things which I did not understand, but which  stirred me deeply. Once, on the roof terrace of our river-side villa, my  eldest brother, at the sudden gathering of clouds, repeated aloud some  stanzas from Kalidas's \"Cloud Messenger.\" I could not, nor had I the  need to, understand a word of the Sanskrit. His ecstatic declamation of  the sonorous rhythm was enough for me.    Then, again, before I could properly understand English, a profusely  illustrated edition of \"The Old Curiosity Shop\" fell into my hands. I  went through the whole of it, though at least nine-tenths of the words  were unknown to me. Yet, with the vague ideas I conjured up from the  rest, I spun out a variously coloured thread on which to string the  illustrations. Any university examiner would have given me a great big  zero, but the reading of the book had not proved for me quite so empty  as all that.    Another time I had accompanied my father on a trip on the Ganges in his  houseboat. Among the books he had with him was an old Fort William  edition of Jayadeva's _Gita Govinda_. It was in the Bengali character.  The verses were not printed in separate lines, but ran on like prose. I  did not then know anything of Sanskrit, yet because of my knowledge of  Bengali many of the words were familiar. I cannot tell how often I read  that _Gita Govinda_. I can well remember this line:        The night that was passed in the lonely forest cottage.    It spread an atmosphere of vague beauty over my mind. That one Sanskrit  word, Nibhrita-nikunja-griham, meaning \"the lonely forest cottage\" was  quite enough for me.    I had to discover for myself the intricate metre of Jayadeva, because  its divisions were lost in the clumsy prose form of the book. And this  discovery gave me very great delight. Of course I did not fully  comprehend Jayadeva's meaning. It would hardly be correct to aver that I  had got it even partly. But the sound of the words and the lilt of the  metre filled my mind with pictures of wonderful beauty, which impelled  me to copy out the whole of the book for my own use.    The same thing happened, when I was a little older, with a verse from  Kalidas's \"Birth of the War God.\" The verse moved me greatly, though the  only words of which I gathered the sense, were \"the breeze carrying the  spray-mist of the falling waters of the sacred Mandakini and shaking the  deodar leaves.\" These left me pining to taste the beauties of the whole.  When, later, a Pandit explained to me that in the next two lines the  breeze went on \"splitting the feathers of the peacock plume on the head  of the eager deer-hunter,\" the thinness of this last conceit  disappointed me. I was much better off when I had relied only upon my  imagination to complete the verse.    Whoever goes back to his early childhood will agree that his greatest  gains were not in proportion to the completeness of his understanding.  Our Kathakas[24] I know this truth well. So their narratives always have  a good proportion of ear-filling Sanskrit words and abstruse remarks not  calculated to be fully understood by their simple hearers, but only to  be suggestive.    The value of such suggestion is by no means to be despised by those who  measure education in terms of material gains and losses. These insist on  trying to sum up the account and find out exactly how much of the lesson  imparted can be rendered up. But children, and those who are not  over-educated, dwell in that primal paradise where men can come to know  without fully comprehending each step. And only when that paradise is  lost comes the evil day when everything needs must be understood. The  road which leads to knowledge, without going through the dreary process  of understanding, that is the royal road. If that be barred, though the  world's marketing may yet go on as usual, the open sea and the mountain  top cease to be possible of access.    So, as I was saying, though at that age I could not realise the full  meaning of the _Gayatri_, there was something in me which could do  without a complete understanding. I am reminded of a day when, as I was  seated on the cement floor in a corner of our schoolroom meditating on  the text, my eyes overflowed with tears. Why those tears came I knew  not; and to a strict cross-questioner I would probably have given some  explanation having nothing to do with the _Gayatri_. The fact of the  matter is that what is going on in the inner recesses of consciousness  is not always known to the dweller on the surface.          (14) _A journey with my Father_      My shaven head after the sacred thread ceremony caused me one great  anxiety. However partial Eurasian lads may be to things appertaining to  the Cow, their reverence for the Brahmin[25] is notoriously lacking. So  that, apart from other missiles, our shaven heads were sure to be pelted  with jeers. While I was worrying over this possibility I was one day  summoned upstairs to my father. How would I like to go with him to the  Himalayas, I was asked. Away from the Bengal Academy and off to the  Himalayas! Would I like it? O that I could have rent the skies with a  shout, that might have given some idea of the How!    On the day of our leaving home my father, as was his habit, assembled  the whole family in the prayer hall for divine service. After I had  taken the dust of the feet of my elders I got into the carriage with my  father. This was the first time in my life that I had a full suit of  clothes made for me. My father himself had selected the pattern and  colour. A gold embroidered velvet cap completed my costume. This I  carried in my hand, being assailed with misgivings as to its effect in  juxtaposition to my hairless head. As I got into the carriage my father  insisted on my wearing it, so I had to put it on. Every time he looked  another way I took it off. Every time I caught his eye it had to resume  its proper place.    My father was very particular in all his arrangements and orderings. He  disliked leaving things vague or undetermined and never allowed  slovenliness or makeshifts. He had a well-defined code to regulate his  relations with others and theirs with him. In this he was different from  the generality of his countrymen. With the rest of us a little  carelessness this way or that did not signify; so in our dealings with  him we had to be anxiously careful. It was not so much the little less  or more that he objected to as the failure to be up to the standard.    My father had also a way of picturing to himself every detail of what he  wanted done. On the occasion of any ceremonial gathering, at which he  could not be present, he would think out and assign the place for each  thing, the duty for each member of the family, the seat for each guest;  nothing would escape him. After it was all over he would ask each one  for a separate account and thus gain a complete impression of the whole  for himself. So, while I was with him on his travels, though nothing  would induce him to put obstacles in the way of my amusing myself as I  pleased, he left no loophole in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22224"],[0,"At Aboukir and Acre: A Story of Napoleon's Invasion of Egypt (#10)"],[1,"men mounted their horses, and the cavalcade  started across the desert.    \"Which way do we travel, Sidi?\"    \"We are not going direct. There are but few wells, and the distances are  long between. Mounted men alone can do the journey without difficulty,  but it is a painful one with women and children, and we never go that  way unless in case of great necessity. We shall travel towards the  south-east, keeping near the edge of the cultivated country until we  reach the Nile, and then follow along the river bank until within a few  miles of Cairo, thence it is three days' journey to the south-west.  There is a well half-way.\"      After proceeding some ten miles, they perceived a party of Arabs  galloping in the direction of Alexandria. They changed their course,  however, and soon came up with the Ben Ouafy caravan. Two of the sheiks  of the party rode forward and exchanged salutations with the chief.    \"Whither are you journeying, Ben Ouafy?\"    \"I am going south to join my tribe; and you--are you going to  Alexandria?\"    \"I am going there at once.\"    \"Hast not the news reached you that the Franks have captured it?\"    \"Truly we have heard so, and a messenger came to us but this morning,  saying that they had come to deliver us from the Turks, and inviting us  to go in thither and see them. Have you not received a message also?\"    \"I received such a message, indeed, but its words were idle. For the  Turks and their Mamelukes I have no great love. They prey upon the land,  and enrich themselves at our expense; but the Franks would doubtless do  the same, and I would rather be fleeced by those of the true faith than  by kaffirs.\"    \"But they come as our friends.\"    Ben Ouafy smiled. \"Why should they come as our friends, Chief of Oulad  A'Ly; what have we done for them? Why should they cross the sea in their  ships at great expense and much danger, to save those whom they know  not, from the Turks? You might as well expect the lion to come to rescue  a deer attacked by a jackal. He might, it is true, drive it away, but it  would only be that he might himself slay and devour the stag. We have  heard of these Franks, how they have taken Italy and other countries;  and think you, that if they should overpower the Osmanlis and defeat the  Mamelukes, that they will say, 'We have accomplished our purpose, we  have freed you from your oppressors, now we will sail back to France and  leave you to manage your own affairs'?\"    \"He promises to respect our religion,\" the sheik said, \"to buy horses  and camels from us at fair prices, to give us rich presents, and to  treat us with honour.\"    \"No doubt, no doubt. 'Tis easy to speak soft words when one needs aid,  but such promises are forgotten when the object is attained. To-day he  is the friend of the Arabs, to-morrow he will be their master, and if  we aid these kaffirs against the followers of the Prophet, we shall well  deserve whatever may befall.\"    \"Then you will not go in to the gathering to which he invites us?\"    \"Assuredly not. Even were it for no other reason, I would wait and see  what comes of the matter. We know not yet that he will conquer the  Mamelukes, and if he fails to do so, assuredly their vengeance will  afterwards fall upon all who have assisted these people.\"    The sheik cast his eye over Ben Ouafy's cavalcade, as if estimating its  strength. He saw, however, that it contained as many armed men as he had  with him, and if the idea had entered his mind of commencing the  campaign by plundering it, he concluded it must be at once abandoned.    \"I have no intention,\" he said, \"of taking part with the Franks against  the government. I am going to sell horses and camels. Frank money is as  good as Turkish, and, moreover, they threaten to attack and destroy  those who refuse to aid them. Your tribe lives far away, though, indeed,  you may abide here at times, and there is nothing of yours that they can  destroy. I have my people to think of, their villages, their flocks and  herds and horses; therefore, I shall go and see this great man, and hear  what he says, and shall, if I can, keep on terms of peace with him. An  army so strong and so fierce that it has captured Alexandria after four  hours' fighting is too formidable for an Arab chief to resist; but,  assuredly, I have no thought of fighting on his side against my  countrymen.\"    The sheik bowed courteously.    \"Every man has his own way of looking at things, and in a matter like  this each must do as seems best to him. Go in peace, and may good  fortune attend you!\"    The formal salutation was returned, and the sheiks rejoined their  parties, and each kept on their course as before they met.    \"There, my son,\" Ben Ouafy said to Sidi, \"you see how the desire for  gain influences men to evil deeds. In order to sell a few hundred horses  and as many camels, the Oulad A'Ly are going to assist the Franks  against true believers. It is true that they may not be going to fight  for them, but the animals that they sell to them will enable them to  fight, which comes to the same thing. Of course he professes that he is  thinking of saving his villages from destruction, but he must know well  enough that the Franks have other things to think of than to spread over  the country here, and give ample time to the Mamelukes to prepare for  their coming. Moreover, as it is clear that the French have no cavalry,  they could not make excursions, for if they seized all the horses in  Alexandria, these would not suffice to mount a party strong enough to  assail a tribe like the Oulad A'Ly, who can put nigh a thousand horsemen  into the field.\"    The party travelled without haste. Before arriving on the Nile, Edgar  suggested to the sheik that it would be as well were he to discard his  European dress for an Arab one.    \"When we were at Damanhour,\" he said, \"I marked how the people scowled  at me as I rode through the streets; and as no doubt you will ride into  Cairo ere long, it would save trouble were I to be so attired that I  should escape notice.\"    \"It would be a good plan,\" the sheik agreed. \"I daresay Sidi can supply  you with a suit.\"    \"I can purchase what is needed at the next place we come to,\" Edgar  said, \"I have money for any necessity that may arise. Even putting  aside the trouble of being constantly questioned, I should prefer the  Arab dress, for under this baking sun I think it would be a good deal  more comfortable than these English clothes.\"    Accordingly, at the next town they passed through, Sidi and Edgar went  together to the bazaar, and the latter purchased, after the usual amount  of bargaining, clothes similar to those worn by his friend. The expense  was but small, for the costume of an Arab chief differed but little from  those of his followers, except that his burnoose was of finer cotton,  and his silken sash of brilliant colours, richer and more showy. With  this exception the whole costume was white, and although some of the  Arab sheiks wore coloured burnooses, Edgar chose a white one, as both  his friend and his father wore that colour. He bought two or three  changes of clothes, for he knew that water was often scarce, and that  washing of garments could not be indulged in frequently. That night when  the camp was pitched he donned his new costume, and placed his pistols  in his sash in Arab fashion. Sidi wound his turban for him, and gave him  instructions how the clothes were to be worn. Those he had taken off  were made into a bundle so that they could be resumed if necessary. He  felt rather awkward as with his friend he sallied out from the tent  which they now shared between them.    \"You look well, Edgar,\" the sheik said approvingly, \"but you will need  to stain your arms and legs, and it will be better for you to stain your  face and neck also, for you would attract quite as much attention as a  white Arab as you would in your European dress.\"    \"I was thinking so myself, sheik; it will be much pleasanter for me to  be able to pass anywhere without comment.\"    \"You are taller than I thought,\" the sheik said; \"it had not struck me  that you were much taller than Sidi, but I see now that you are as tall  as I am.\"    \"I suppose the flowing garments make one look taller,\" Edgar said. \"I  have often been surprised, when standing near a native who looked to me  a good deal taller than myself, to find that he was really not above my  own height.\"    \"My wife shall make a stain for you as soon as she can get the material.  There will be no difficulty about that, for we often dye our burnooses  brown, especially when we are starting on a long journey.\"    The sheik's wife and the other women were voluble in their expressions  of satisfaction at the change in Edgar. They had been but little in the  towns, and the comparatively tight-fitting European garments were, in  their eyes, ugly and unbecoming. Seen in the more graceful dress of the  Arabs they recognized for the first time that their guest was a  good-looking young fellow, tall, active, and not ungraceful in figure,  and that he could even compare not unfavourably with Sidi, who was a  favourite with the whole camp. Even the men, impassive as they usually  were, uttered a few words of satisfaction at Edgar having adopted an  Arab costume, and at his appearance in it. On the following day the  sheik, taking his son, Edgar, and two of his followers, left the caravan  and rode on to Cairo, leaving the others to travel by easy stages to  join the rest of the tribe.    \"Doubtless we shall find many other sheiks assembled there,\" he said as  they rode along; \"the government is sure to have sent orders already for  all the Bedouin tribes to hold themselves in readiness to gather there  to oppose the advance of the French. The levies of the city and the  neighbourhood will also be called out, not so much perhaps to fight as  to labour at the fortifications. That they will not ask of the Arabs,  for no"]]]
