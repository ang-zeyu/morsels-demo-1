Alone in a sky of the palest blue there  twinkled a small bright star.    I addressed this star.    \"She was certainly very nice to me,\" I said. \"Very nice, indeed.\"    The star said nothing.    \"On the other hand,\" I went on, \"I don't like that naval man. He is a  good chap, but he overdoes it.\"    The star winked sympathetically.    \"He calls her Phyllis,\" I said.    \"Charawk,\" said the hen satirically from her basket.          A LITTLE DINNER    VIII      \"Edwin comes to-day,\" said Mrs. Ukridge.    \"And the Derricks,\" said Ukridge, sawing at the bread in his energetic  way. \"Don't forget the Derricks, Millie.\"    \"No, dear. Mrs. Beale is going to give us a very nice dinner. We  talked it over yesterday.\"    \"Who is Edwin?\" I asked.    We were finishing breakfast on the second morning after my visit to  the Derricks. I had related my adventures to the staff of the farm on  my return, laying stress on the merits of our neighbors and their  interest in our doings, and the hired retainer had been sent off next  morning with a note from Mrs. Ukridge, inviting them to look over the  farm and stay to dinner.    \"Edwin?\" said Ukridge. \"Beast of a cat.\"    \"O Stanley!\" said Mrs. Ukridge plaintively. \"He's not. He's such a  dear, Mr. Garnet. A beautiful, pure-bred Persian. He has taken  prizes.\"    \"He's always taking something--generally food. That's why he didn't  come down with us.\"    \"A great, horrid _beast_ of a dog bit him, Mr. Garnet.\" Mrs. Ukridge's  eyes became round and shining. \"And poor Edwin had to go to a cats'  hospital.\"    \"And I hope,\" said Ukridge, \"the experience will do him good. Sneaked  a dog's bone, Garnet, under his very nose, if you please. Naturally,  the dog lodged a protest.\"    \"I'm so afraid that he will be frightened of Bob. He will be very  timid, and Bob's so exceedingly boisterous. Isn't he, Mr. Garnet?\"    I owned that Bob's manner was not that of a Vere de Vere.    \"That's all right,\" said Ukridge; \"Bob won't hurt him, unless he tries  to steal his bone. In that case we will have Edwin made into a rug.\"    \"Stanley doesn't like Edwin,\" said Mrs. Ukridge plaintively.           *       *       *       *       *    Edwin arrived early in the afternoon, and was shut into the kitchen.  He struck me as a handsome cat, but nervous. He had an excited eye.    The Derricks followed two hours later. Mr. Chase was not of the party.    \"Tom had to go to London,\" explained the professor, \"or he would have  been delighted to come. It was a disappointment to the boy, for he  wanted to see the farm.\"    \"He must come some other time,\" said Ukridge. \"We invite inspection.  Look here,\" he broke off suddenly--we were nearing the fowl run now,  Mrs. Ukridge walking in front with Phyllis Derrick--\"were you ever at  Bristol?\"    \"Never, sir,\" said the professor.    \"Because I knew just such another fat little buffer there a few years  ago. Gay old bird, he was. He--\"    \"This is the fowl run, professor,\" I broke in, with a moist, tingling  feeling across my forehead and up my spine. I saw the professor  stiffen as he walked, while his face deepened in color. Ukridge's  breezy way of expressing himself is apt to electrify the stranger.    \"You will notice the able way--ha, ha!--in which the wire netting is  arranged,\" I continued feverishly. \"Took some doing, that. By Jove!  yes. It was hot work. Nice lot of fowls, aren't they? Rather a mixed  lot, of course. Ha, ha! That's the dealer's fault, though. We are  getting quite a number of eggs now. Hens wouldn't lay at first.  Couldn't make them.\"    I babbled on till from the corner of my eye I saw the flush fade from  the professor's face and his back gradually relax its pokerlike  attitude. The situation was saved for the moment, but there was no  knowing what further excesses Ukridge might indulge in. I managed to  draw him aside as we went through the fowl run, and expostulated.    \"For goodness' sake, be careful,\" I whispered. \"You've no notion how  touchy the professor is.\"    \"But _I_ said nothing,\" he replied, amazed.    \"Hang it, you know, nobody likes to be called a fat little buffer to  his face.\"    \"What else could I call him? Nobody minds a little thing like that. We  can't be stilted and formal. It's ever so much more friendly to relax  and be chummy.\"    Here we rejoined the others, and I was left with a leaden foreboding  of grewsome things in store. I knew what manner of man Ukridge was  when he relaxed and became chummy. Friendships of years' standing had  failed to survive the test.    For the time being, however, all went well. In his role of lecturer he  offended no one, and Phyllis and her father behaved admirably. They  received the strangest theories without a twitch of the mouth.    \"Ah,\" the professor would say, \"now, is that really so? Very  interesting, indeed.\"    Only once, when Ukridge was describing some more than usually original  device for the furthering of the interests of his fowls, did a slight  spasm disturb Phyllis's look of attentive reverence.    \"And you have really had no previous experience in chicken farming?\"  she said.    \"None,\" said Ukridge, beaming through his glasses, \"not an atom. But I  can turn my hand to anything, you know. Things seem to come naturally  to me, somehow.\"    \"I see,\" said Phyllis.    It was while matters were progressing with such beautiful smoothness  that I observed the square form of the hired retainer approaching us.  Somehow--I cannot say why--I had a feeling that he came with bad news.  Perhaps it was his air of quiet satisfaction which struck me as  ominous.    \"Beg pardon, Mr. Ukridge, sir.\"    Ukridge was in the middle of a very eloquent excursus on the feeding  of fowls. The interruption annoyed him.    \"Well, Beale,\" he said, \"what is it?\"    \"That there cat, sir, what came to-day.\"    \"O Beale,\" cried Mrs. Ukridge in agitation, \"_what_ has happened?\"    \"Having something to say to the missus--\"    \"What has happened? O Beale, don't say that Edwin has been hurt? Where  is he? Oh, _poor_ Edwin!\"    \"Having something to say to the missus--\"    \"If Bob has bitten him, I hope he had his nose _well_ scratched,\" said  Mrs. Ukridge vindictively.    \"Having something to say to the missus,\" resumed the hired retainer  tranquilly, \"I went into the kitchen ten minutes back. The cat was  sitting on the mat.\"    Beale's narrative style closely resembled that of a certain book I had  read in my infancy. I wish I could remember its title. It was a  well-written book.    \"Yes, Beale, yes?\" said Mrs. Ukridge. \"Oh, do go on!\"    \"'Halloo, puss,' I says to him, 'and 'ow are you, sir?' 'Be careful,'  says the missus. ''E's that timid,' she says, 'you wouldn't believe,'  she says. ''E's only just settled down, as you may say,' she says.  'Ho, don't you fret,' I says to her, ''im and me we understands each  other. 'Im and me,' I says, 'is old friends. 'E's me dear old pal,  Corporal Banks, of the Skrimshankers.' She grinned at that, ma'am,  Corporal Banks being a man we'd 'ad many a 'earty laugh at in the old  days. 'E was, in a manner of speaking, a joke between us.\"    \"Oh, do--go--on, Beale! What has happened to Edwin?\"    The hired retainer proceeded in calm, even tones.    \"We was talking there, ma'am, when Bob, which had followed me unknown,  trotted in. When the cat ketched sight of 'im sniffing about, there  was such a spitting and swearing as you never 'eard, and blowed,\" said  Mr. Beale amusedly, as if the recollection tickled him, \"blowed if the  old cat didn't give one jump and move in quick time up the chimley,  where 'e now remains, paying no 'eed to the missus's attempts to get  him down again.\"    Sensation, as they say in the reports.    \"But he'll be cooked,\" cried Phyllis, open-eyed.    Ukridge uttered a roar of dismay.    \"No, he won't. Nor will our dinner. Mrs. Beale always lets the kitchen  fire out during the afternoon. It's a cold dinner we'll get to-night,  if that cat doesn't come down.\"    The professor's face fell. I had remarked on the occasion when I had  lunched with him his evident fondness for the pleasures of the table.  Cold, impromptu dinners were plainly not to his taste.    We went to the kitchen in a body. Mrs. Beale was standing in front of  the empty grate making seductive cat noises up the chimney.    \"What's all this, Mrs. Beale?\" said Ukridge.    \"He won't come down, sir, not while he thinks Bob's about. And how I'm  to cook dinner for five with him up the chimney I don't see, sir.\"    \"Prod at him with a broom handle, Mrs. Beale,\" urged Ukridge.    \"I 'ave tried that, sir, but I can't reach him, and I've only bin and  drove 'im further up. What must be,\" added Mrs. Beale philosophically,  \"must be. He may come down of his own accord in the night. Bein'  'ungry.\"    \"Then what we must do,\" said Ukridge in a jovial manner which to me at  least seemed out of place, \"is to have a regular, jolly, picnic  dinner, what? Whack up whatever we have in the larder, and eat that.\"    \"A regular, jolly, picnic dinner,\" repeated the professor gloomily. I  could read what was passing in his mind.    \"That will be delightful,\" said Phyllis.    [Illustration: \"I've only bin and drove 'im further up,\" said Mrs.  Beale.]    \"Er--I think, my dear sir,\" said her father, \"it would be hardly fair  of us to give any further trouble to Mrs. Ukridge and yourself. If you  will allow me, therefore, I will--\"    Ukridge became gushingly hospitable. He refused to think of allowing  his guests to go empty away. He would be able to whack up something,  he said. There was quite a good deal of the ham left, he was sure. He  appealed to me to indorse his view that there was a tin of sardines  and part of a cold fowl and plenty of bread and cheese.    \"And after all,\" he said, speaking for the whole company in the  generous, comprehensive way enthusiasts have, \"what more do we want in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20547"],[0,"Stories of Birds (#10)"],[1,"call resembling the voice of the tree-frog.    Male and female have crimson head and neck--upper parts black with  white marking--white band across wings--most conspicuous when bird is  in flight.    Lower parts white--bill wedge-shaped, strong, and sharp--tail strong  and stiff, used as a brace when clinging to a tree-trunk and tapping  with bill--toes arranged two in front and two behind for better support  in clinging to tree trunks, etc.    Young birds resemble the parents, except that in colour they are a  mottled gray.    Food is largely fruit--green corn, nuts, and larval insects procured  from tree-trunks.--Sometimes stores away nuts, etc.    Place chosen for nest is usually a rotting tree, which is easier to  bore.--Hollow from fifteen to eighteen inches deep.--Eggs pure white,  generally six in number.          THE LARK    [Illustration: Larks]    IN THE MEADOW    If Jack's big black dog, Nero, had not chanced to snatch Phyllis's rag  doll by the head and run away with it this story would have never been  written.    You see, Nero bounded straight across the meadow and Phyllis, fearing  that she would lose the doll, ran shrieking after him.    Nero was only playing, and soon dropped the doll and ran off.  Phyllis  regained her property and started to return, when a bird rose from the  grass at her feet with a queer whirring sound.    Phyllis looked up at the bird and then down to the spot from which it  had flown.    In another moment she would have stepped in the nest.  This meadow  lark's nest was unlike any other Phyllis had found.  Indeed, it could  scarcely be called a nest at all.    But when she looked at it Phyllis thought what a wise little bird the  meadow lark must be to choose such a place for the nest.    Had Phyllis not chanced upon it in just the way she did she might have  looked all day long and not discovered it.    The nest was flat upon the ground.  Around it and over it arched the  tall meadow grasses.  The nest itself was made of grass--it seemed to  Phyllis that it was made in a somewhat careless manner, and that the  eggs might easily roll out upon the ground.    There were four beautiful oval eggs in the nest--the largest birds'  eggs Phyllis had as yet discovered.  They were over an inch long, and  were of a beautiful rosy white colour, speckled closely with reddish  brown spots.    As Phyllis sat very still, the mother bird crept softly back to her  home.  She carefully settled herself on the grassy nest and with her  bill tenderly tucked the eggs under her soft feathers.    \"How careful you are!\" exclaimed Phyllis.  \"No fear of your breaking  the eggs.\"    The brown bird rose up quickly in fright and looked uncertainly toward  the fence.  Phyllis thought to see her whirr off again.    \"Oh, don't go,\" she cried.  \"I will not harm you!  Truly I will not  disturb you!\"    The meadow lark looked again toward the fence, and then settled herself  once more over her precious eggs.    \"Why do you look toward the fence so often?\" asked Phyllis.    \"Do you not see that bird perched upon the fence?\" asked the meadow  lark.    \"Yes,\" Phyllis answered, \"what is he doing there?\"    \"He is our sentinel,\" said the meadow lark.  \"He is on the lookout for  danger.  When he gives the alarm, the rest of the flock know there is  danger near.    \"When we hear the sentinel's alarm we are off in an instant.  We fly  high into the air.  Did you not notice how I hovered near the  grass-tops for a moment and then rose high into the air?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Phyllis, \"and I knew that you were a lark because of  that whirring sound you made when flying.\"    \"Ah, but I am not really a lark at all,\" said the bird.  \"I am called  the meadow lark, but in truth I belong to the blackbird family.  The  red-winged blackbird is an own cousin of mine.  So also is the oriole,  who builds a queer hanging nest in the tree-tops.    \"The oriole is very proud of her woven nest, but I should consider it a  dangerous place for bird babies.  My little ones will never be hurt by  falling from their nest.    \"Neither can I imagine how any bird can dare to build in such an open  place.    \"My home is hidden here amid the grasses.  Sometimes we find places  like this, where the grass blades naturally arch over and hide the nest.    \"Sometimes we weave a sort of arch over the nest with the downy, fine  fibres from the grass leaves.    \"Did you notice the little lane down which I returned to my tiny home?\"    \"No,\" said Phyllis, \"I thought you just came through the grasses by the  easiest way.\"    \"If you will look closely,\" said the meadow lark, pecking away at her  own brown feathers, \"if you look very, very closely, you will see the  tiny path which leads directly to my door.\"    Phyllis leaned down and peered very curiously among the grass stems.  Sure enough, there was a tiny winding path, almost hidden from sight.  It led directly to the meadow lark's nest.    \"You are a very wonderful little bird,\" she cried.    \"I shall have some very wonderful babies one of these fine days,\" said  the meadow lark, proudly.    \"How safely they will be hidden from danger,\" said Phyllis.    \"Well,\" said the mother bird, shaking her head, sadly, \"I am very sure  that I build in a safer manner than my cousins.  But, alas, even meadow  larks are not free from danger.\"    \"I might have stepped on your nest?\" said Phyllis.    \"Yes,\" said the bird, \"but what makes me fear most are the field-mice  and the snakes.  They make great havoc in our nests when they discover  them.  Many a tiny fledgling has been swallowed by a great creeping,  crawling snake.  Many a beautiful egg has been eaten by the hungry  little field-mice.\"    \"I hope no harm will come to your little home,\" said Phyllis.  \"I  notice one thing which you have for a protection from harm.\"    \"What is that?\" asked the meadow lark.    \"It is your colour.\"    The meadow lark raised her head in gentle surprise.    \"And what has my colour to do with my danger?\" she asked.    \"Why,\" said the little girl, feeling wondrous wise, \"do you not see  that the browns of your feathery dress are the same colours as the  grass stems and the stubble amid which you brood and feed?\"    \"Why, so it is,\" said the meadow lark.  \"My back is brown, edged with  brownish white.  That is like the grass stems.  I am streaked with  black and brown and cream colours.  That is like the blades of grass.    \"My throat and breast are yellow like the stubble amid which I feed.  You are wonderfully wise, Miss Phyllis.\"    \"What a beautiful black crescent you have upon your breast,\" said  Phyllis.  \"It was almost the first thing I noticed when I met you.\"    \"Did you observe the dark brown lines on my head?  They seem to cross  my eyes.\"    \"I think you are quite beautiful,\" said Phyllis.    \"Ah, but you should see my mate,\" said the meadow lark.  \"He is much  more beautiful than I.  My feathers seem pale and faded when I walk  beside him.  When fall comes, however, my own colours will brighten.\"    \"On what shall you feed your little ones?\"    \"When I tell you, you will see again that I am wise in choosing this  place for a nest.    \"My babies need never grow hungry, for the grass seeds are always  falling.  The beetles and worms and ants are always walking by.  The  moths and the butterflies are for ever laying their eggs in all sorts  of convenient places.  You remember how their eggs do not hatch out  into butterflies and moths at once.  They are just ugly little worms  called grubs.\"    \"Yes,\" said Phyllis, \"I remember.\"    The meadow lark carefully tucked an egg farther under her soft brown  feathers.    \"I am glad,\" she said, \"that my eggs do not hatch out as grubs.  Perhaps if they did, I should care no more for my babies than the  butterfly does for hers.  I am told that she does not even know her own  children.\"    \"You are quite right,\" said Phyllis.  \"She herself told me so.\"    The meadow lark gave a low whistle and nervously flitted her tail,  showing the white feathers with which it was edged.    \"It has been some time since I have heard your clear, sweet whistle,\"  said Phyllis.  \"I thought you must have left our meadow.  You have a  most beautiful voice.\"    \"Oh, no, we shall not soon leave your meadow, Phyllis.  In the autumn  we may join a party of larks and take our family to the marshes for  awhile, but we shall return.  Meadow larks do sometimes go south for  the winter, but usually they live their lives in their home meadows.\"    \"Then you will sing for me again?\" asked the little girl.    \"Oh, with pleasure,\" said the meadow lark.    \"You remember how we used to sing in the spring?  Just now our thoughts  are so taken up with our nesting that we have little time for song.  But later, when the little ones are able to care for themselves, I  shall gladly whistle to you once more.\"    \"I shall listen for you,\" said Phyllis.  \"Just now I must go, for I  hear my mother's voice.  Good-bye, meadow lark!\"    And the meadow lark from her nest whistled a low good-bye.          THE SONG OF THE MERRY LARK[1]    Once there was an old gray pussy, and she went down into the meadow,  where she saw a merry lark flying among the tall reeds; and pussy said,  \"Where are you going, little lark?\"    And the merry lark answered, \"I am going to the king to sing him a song  this fine May morning.\"    And pussy said, \"Come here, little lark, and I'll let you see a pretty  ring round my neck.\"    But the lark said, \"No, no, gray pussy; no, no!  You worried the little  mouse, but you shall not worry me.\"    Then the lark flew away till he came to a high oak-tree, and there he  saw a gray, greedy hawk sitting.  And the gray, greedy hawk said,  \"Where are you going, pretty lark?\"    And the lark answered, \"I am going to the king, to sing him a song this  fine May morning.\"    And the gray, greedy hawk said, \"Come here, little lark, and I'll let  you see a pretty feather in my wing.\"    But the merry lark said, \"No,"]]]
