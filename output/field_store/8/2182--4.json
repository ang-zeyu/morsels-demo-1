They have in them rather too much that is heraldic  conventionalism, and not quite enough that is natural lion. And, with  the first symptoms of decline in heraldic Art, the treatment of lions  showed signs of a tendency to carry conventionalism to the utmost  extravagance. The same remarks are applicable to eagles. It must be  added, however, that truly admirable examples of heraldic animals  occasionally may be found as late even as the commencement of the  sixteenth century, as in the chantry of Abbot Ramryge, in the Abbey  Church at St. Alban's, and in King's College Chapel at Cambridge. It  must be our care to blend together the true attributes of the living  lion and eagle, and those also of other living creatures, with the  traditional peculiarities of their heraldic representatives. And we must  extend the corresponding application of the same principles of treatment  to imaginary beings and heraldic monsters, as they occur in our  Heraldry. The shield, No. 24, of Prince JOHN OF ELTHAM, younger brother  of EDWARD III., finely sculptured with his effigy in alabaster, in  Westminster Abbey (A.D. 1336), and in perfect preservation, gives us  characteristic examples of lions of the best heraldic era, their frames,  attenuated as they are, being perfect types of fierce elasticity. With  this shield may be grouped others, having admirably suggestive examples  of heraldic lions of a somewhat later date, which are preserved upon the  monuments of EDWARD III. and the BLACK PRINCE, severally at Westminster  and Canterbury. I shall refer to these fine shields again, and to other  admirable examples with them, hereafter (Chapter IX.). The  conventionalism in all these examples, however felicitous the manner in  which it is treated in them, is very decidedly exaggerated. These  examples, and others such as these, are not the less valuable to us  because their teaching includes an illustration of the excesses that we  must always be careful to avoid. I may here observe, that on the subject  of armorial Art I leave my examples (all of them selected from the most  characteristic authorities, and engraved with scrupulous fidelity) for  the most part to convey their own lessons and suggestions: my own  suggestion to students being that, in such living creatures as they may  represent in their compositions, while they are careful to preserve  heraldic consistency and to express heraldic feeling, they exhibit  beauty of form coupled with freedom of action and an appropriate  expression. \"Freedom of action\" I intend to imply more than such skilful  drawing, as will impart to any particular creature the idea of free  movement of frame and limb: it refers also to repeated representations  of the same creature, under the same heraldic conditions of motive and  attitude. And, here \"freedom of action\" implies those slight, yet  significant, modifications of minor details which, without in the least  degree affecting armorial truth, prevent even the semblance of  monotonous reiteration. Thus, at Beverley, in the Percy Shrine in the  Minster, upon a shield of England the three lions are all heraldically  the same; but, there is nothing of sameness in them nevertheless,  because in each one there is some little variety in the turn of the  head, or in the placing of the paws, or in the sweep of the tail. And  again, in Westminster Hall, the favourite badge of Richard II., a white  hart, chained, and in an attitude of rest, is repeated as many as  eighty-three times; and all are equally consistent with heraldic truth  and accuracy, without any one of them being an exact counterpart of any  other. In Nos. 25 and 26 two examples are shown from this remarkable  series of representations of this beautiful badge, each one different  from the other, and yet both really the same.          CHAPTER IV    THE GRAMMAR OF HERALDRY    SECTION I      _The Language of Heraldry-- The Nomenclature-- Style and Forms of    Expression-- Blazon-- The Shield: its Parts, Points, Divisions,    Dividing Lines, Varieties of Form, and Heraldic Treatment._      \"The shield hangs down on every breast.\"      --LORD OF THE ISLES.      THE LANGUAGE OF HERALDRY.--The original language of English Heraldry was  the Norman-French, which may also be designated Anglo-Norman, habitually  spoken at the Court of England in the early heraldic era. After a while,  a mixed language succeeded, compounded of English and the original  Norman-French; and this mixed language still continues in use.    NOMENCLATURE.--Like its language, the Nomenclature of English Heraldry  is of a mixed character, in part technical and peculiar to itself, and  in part the same that is in common use. Thus, many of the figures and  devices of Heraldry have their peculiar heraldic names and titles, while  still more bear their ordinary designations. Descriptive terms, whether  expressed in English or in French (Anglo-Norman), are generally employed  with a special heraldic intention and significance. In the earliest Roll  of Arms known to be now in existence, which was compiled (as appears  from internal evidence) between the years 1240 and 1245, the  Nomenclature is the same that is found in Rolls and other heraldic  documents of a later date. This fact of the existence of a definite  Nomenclature at that time, proves that before the middle of the  thirteenth century the Heraldry of England was subject to a systematic  course of treatment, and had become established and recognised as a  distinct and independent Science.    STYLE AND FORMS OF EXPRESSION.--With the Nomenclature, a settled Style  and certain fixed technical Forms of Expression were introduced and  accepted in the thirteenth century; and, since that period, the Style  and Forms of Expression have undergone only such comparatively slight  modifications as tended to render them both more complete and more  consistent. As it was at the first, it still is the essence of heraldic  language to be concise yet complete, expressive, and also abounding in  suggestions. Not a syllable is expressed that is not absolutely  necessary; not a syllable omitted, the absence of which might possibly  lead to any doubt or uncertainty. In the more matured style, the  repetition of any important word in the same sentence is scrupulously  avoided; and, where it would be required, another form of expression is  substituted in its stead. Much meaning also is left to be implied and  understood, through inference, either based upon certain accepted rules  and established heraldic usages for the arrangement of the words and  clauses of a sentence, or derived from the natural qualities and  characteristic conditions of certain figures and devices: but, nothing  is ever left to be inferred when an uncertain inference might possibly  be adopted, or that can be understood clearly and with certainty only by  means of an explicit statement. Superfluous words and particles of all  kinds are altogether omitted. Descriptive epithets follow the nouns to  which they refer: as, a _red cross_ is styled a _cross gules_. The  general rules, by which the arrangement of the words in heraldic  descriptive sentences is determined, will be found in the last  subdivision of this chapter. Examples of heraldic Language,  Nomenclature, Style and Forms of Expression, will be given in abundance  throughout the following chapters and sections of this treatise. With  these examples students will do well to familiarise themselves: then,  let them prepare additional examples for that \"practice,\" which (as  Parker's \"Glossary of Heraldry\" says, p. 60) \"alone will make perfect,\"  by writing down correct descriptions of heraldic compositions from the  compositions themselves; after which process they may advantageously  reverse the order of their study, and make drawings of these same (or,  if they prefer it, of some other) heraldic compositions from their own  written descriptions of them.    When any heraldic description of a figure, device, or composition has  been completed, a statement is made to signify the person, family,  community, or realm whose armorial ensign it may be. This is done by  simply writing the appropriate name, after the last word of the  description; or, by prefixing the word \"for\" before the name when it is  placed in the same position. Thus, a description of the three lions of  England is to be followed by the word--\"ENGLAND\"; or, by the  formula--\"for ENGLAND.\" If preferred, with equal consistency the  arrangement may be reversed, and the Name, with or without the prefix  \"for,\" may precede the description: thus--\"ENGLAND,\" or \"For ENGLAND,\"  three lions, &c. It is to be borne in remembrance, that armorial ensigns  are personal inheritances, and--with the exception of Sovereign  Princes--by comparison but very rarely relate to _Titles_ and  _Dignities_.    BLAZON, BLAZONING, BLAZONRY.--When a knight entered the lists at a  tournament, his presence was announced by sound of trumpet or horn,  after which the officers of arms, the official Heralds, declared his  armorial insignia--they \"blazoned\" his Arms. This term, \"to blazon,\"  derived from the German word \"_blasen_,\" signifying \"to blow a blast on  a horn\" (or, as one eminent German Herald prefers, from the old German  word \"_blaze_\" or \"_blasse_,\" \"a mark\" or \"sign\"), in Heraldry really  denotes either to _describe_ any armorial figure, device, or composition  in correct heraldic language; or to _represent_ such figure, device, or  composition accurately in form, position, arrangement, and colouring.  But, as a matter of practical usage, pictorial representation is usually  allied to the word \"emblazon.\" The word \"blazon\" also, as a noun, may be  employed with a general and comprehensive signification to denote  \"Heraldry.\"    THE SHIELD:--ITS PARTS, POINTS, AND DIVISIONS.--Their Shield, which the  knights of the Middle Ages derived from the military"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2323"],[0,"Recollections and Letters of General Robert E.

I hope, dear Mary, you and daughter, as well as poor little  Rob, have derived some benefit from the sanitary baths of the Hot. What  does daughter intend to do during the winter? And, indeed, what do you?  It is time you were determining. There is no prospect of your returning  to Arlington. I think you had better select some comfortable place in  the Carolinas or Georgia, and all board together. If Mildred goes to  school at Raleigh, why not go there? It is a good opportunity to try a  warmer climate for your rheumatism. If I thought our enemies would not  make a vigorous move against Richmond, I would recommend to rent a house  there. But under these circumstances I would not feel as if you were  permanently located if there. I am ignorant where I shall be. In the  field somewhere, I suspect, so I have little hope of being with you,  though I hope to be able to see you.... I heard from Fitzhugh the other  day. He is well, though his command is greatly reduced by sickness. I  wished much to bring him with me; but there is too much cavalry on this  line now, and I am dismounting them. I could not, therefore, order more.  The weather is almost as bad here as in the mountains I left. There was  a drenching rain yesterday, and as I had left my overcoat in camp I was  thoroughly wet from head to foot. It has been raining ever since and is  now coming down with a will. But I have my clothes out on the bushes and  they will be well washed.    \"The force of the enemy, by a few prisoners captured yesterday and  civilians on the road, is put down from 17,000 to 20,000. Some went as  high as 22,000. General Floyd thinks 18,000. I do not think it exceeds  9,000 or 10,000, though it exceeds ours. I wish he had attacked us, as  I believe he would have been repulsed with great loss. His plan was to  attack us at all points at the same time. The rumbling of his wheels,  etc., was heard by our pickets, but as that was customary at night in  the moving and placing of his cannon, the officer of the day to whom it  was reported paid no particular attention to it, supposing it to be a  preparation for attack in the morning. When day appeared, the bird had  flown, and the misfortune was that the reduced condition of our horses  for want of provender, exposure to cold rains in these mountains,  and want of provisions for the men prevented the vigorous pursuit and  following up that was proper. We can only get up provisions from day to  day--which paralyses our operations.    \"I am sorry, as you say, that the movements of the armies cannot keep  pace with the expectations of the editors of papers. I know they can  regulate matters satisfactorily to themselves on paper. I wish they  could do so in the field. No one wishes them more success than I do and  would be happy to see them have full swing. I hope something will be  done to please them. Give much love to the children and everybody, and  believe me.    \"Always yours,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    Colonel Taylor, in his \"Four Years with General Lee,\" says:    \"We had now reached the latter days of October. The lateness of the  season and the condition of the roads precluded the idea of earnest,  aggressive operations, and the campaign in western Virginia was  virtually concluded.    \"Judged from its results, it must be confessed that this series of  operations was a failure. At its conclusion, a large portion of the  State was in possession of the Federals, including the rich valleys of  the Ohio and Kanawha rivers, and so remained until the close of the war.  For this, however, General Lee cannot reasonably be held accountable.  Disaster had befallen the Confederate arms, and the worst had been  accomplished before he had reached the theatre of operations; the  Alleghanies there constituted the dividing line between the hostile  forces, and in this network of mountains, sterile and rendered  absolutely impracticable by a prolonged season of rain, Nature had  provided an insurmountable barrier to operations in this transmontane  country.... It was doubtless because of similar embarrassments that the  Federal general retired, in the face of inferior numbers, to a point  near his base of supplies.\"    Professor William P. Trent, in his \"Robert E. Lee,\" after describing  briefly the movements of the contending armies, writes:    \"There was, then, nothing to do but to acknowledge the campaign a  failure. The Confederate Government withdrew its troops and sent them  elsewhere. Lee, whom the press abused and even former friends began to  regard as overrated, was assigned to command the Department of South  Carolina, Georgia, and Florida; and her western counties were lost to  the Old Dominion forever. It must have been a crushing blow to Lee at  the time, but he bore it uncomplainingly.... And when all is said, no  commander, however great, can succeed against bad roads, bad weather,  sickness of troops, lack of judgement and harmony among subordinates,  and a strong, alert enemy. Yet this is what Lee was expected to do.\"    Mr. Davis, in an address before a memorial meeting at Richmond in 1870,  speaking of General Lee in this campaign, said:    \"He came back, carrying the heavy weight of defeat, and unappreciated by  the people whom he served, for they could not know, as I knew, that, if  his plans and orders had been carried out, the result would have been  victory rather than retreat. You did not know it; for I should not have  known it had he not breathed it in my ear only at my earnest request,  and begging that nothing be said about it. The clamour which then arose  followed him when he went to South Carolina, so that it became necessary  on his departure to write a letter to the Governor of that State,  telling him what manner of man he was. Yet, through all this, with a  magnanimity rarely equalled, he stood in silence, without defending  himself or allowing others to defend him, for he was unwilling to offend  any one who was wearing a sword and striking blows for the Confederacy.\"    After returning to Richmond, my father resumed his position as advisor  and counsellor to Mr. Davis. From there he writes to my mother, who had  left the Hot Springs and gone on to \"Shirley,\" on James River:    \"Richmond, November 5, 1861.    \"My Dear Mary: I received last night your letter of the 2d, and would  have answered it at once, but was detained with the Secretary till after  11 P. M. I fear now I may miss the mail. Saturday evening I tried to  get down to you to spend Sunday, but could find no government boat going  down, and the passenger boats all go in the morning. I then went to  the stable and got out my horse, but it was near night then and I was  ignorant both of the road and distance and I gave it up. I was obliged  to be here Monday, and as it would have consumed all Sunday to go and  come, I have remained for better times. The President said I could  not go to-day, so I must see what can be done to-morrow. I will come,  however, wherever you are, either Shirley or the White House, as soon as  possible, and if not sooner, Saturday at all events.... I am, as ever,  Yours,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    The day after this letter was written, my father was ordered to South  Carolina for the purpose of directing and supervising the construction  of a line of defense along the southern coast. I give here several  letters to members of his family which tell of his duties and manner of  life:    \"Savannah, November 18, 1861.    \"My Dear Mary: This is the first moment I have had to write to you,  and now am waiting the call to breakfast, on my way to Brunswick,  Fernandina, etc. This is my second visit to Savannah. Night before last,  I returned to Coosawhatchie, South Carolina, from Charleston, where I  have placed my headquarters, and last night came here, arriving after  midnight. I received in Charleston your letter from Shirley. It was a  grievous disappointment to me not to have seen you, but better times  will come, I hope.... You probably have seen the operations of the  enemy's fleet. Since their first attack they have been quiescent  apparently, confining themselves to Hilton Head, where they are  apparently fortifying.    \"I have no time for more. Love to all.    \"Yours very affectionately and truly,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    \"Charleston, November 15, 1861.    \"My Precious Daughter: I have received your letter forwarded to Richmond  by Mr. Powell, and I also got, while in the West, the letter sent by B.  Turner. I can write but seldom, but your letters always give me great  pleasure. I am glad you had such a pleasant visit to 'Kinloch.' I have  passed a great many pleasant days there myself in my young days. Now  you must labour at your books and gain knowledge and wisdom. Do not mind  what Rob says. I have a beautiful white beard. It is much admired. At  least, much remarked on. You know I have told you not to believe what  the young men tell you. I was unable to see your poor mother when in  Richmond. Before I could get down I was sent off here. Another forlorn  hope expedition. Worse than West Virginia.... I have much to do in this  country. I have been to Savannah and have to go again. The enemy is  quiet after his conquest of Port Royal Harbor and his whole fleet is  lying there. May God guard and protect you, my dear child, prays your    \"Affectionate father,    \"R. E.

Two of my sisters were in King George  County, Virginia, at \"Clydale,\" the summer home of Dr. Richard Stuart,  with whose family we had been a long time intimate. From there they  had driven to \"Stratford,\" in Westmoreland County, about thirty miles  distant, where my father was born. They had written him of this trip,  and this is his reply:    \"Savannah,"]]]
