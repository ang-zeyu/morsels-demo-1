Faulty tones are called nasal, guttural,  palatal, throaty, muffled, and so on, the peculiar timbre of each  suggesting the name. If the throat is relaxed, and if the soft parts of  the vocal tube lying between the larynx and the teeth are kept out of  the way, most of the disagreeable qualities of voice enumerated  disappear. Certain requisites are necessary to good tone-formation.    First, a movable lower jaw.    It is astonishing that so many of young and old will, when they wish to  open the mouth for song, try to keep it closed. Paradoxical as the  statement is, it nevertheless describes a very common phenomenon-- the  \"fixed jaw,\" it may be called. As soon as the teeth are parted slightly,  the muscles of the face and neck which control the movement of the lower  jaw contract, holding it in a fixed position, and incidentally  tightening the muscles of the throat until the larynx is in a grip as of  rubber bands. The mouth must not be held open as if the jaws were pried  apart. It is opened by the relaxation of the closing muscles and should  hang by its own weight, as it were. If then the lower jaw drops easily,  and with no accompanying muscular contraction of face or throat, the  tone may be formed or shaped well forward in the mouth, unless the soft  parts referred to obstruct it.    These soft parts are the tongue and the soft-palate. The soft-palate is  a structure which hangs from the posterior edge of the hard-palate. The  uvula, the pillars of the palate, and the tonsils are parts of the  structure.    The tongue which, when the mouth is closed, nearly fills it, should in  vocalization lie as much out of the way as is possible. If the tip be  pressed against the lower teeth and its sides upon the molars, it forms  a floor to the cavity of the mouth. If the tip turns toward the roof of  the mouth, or if it is drawn back and under, so as to arch the tongue,  tone is seriously interfered with, while if the root of the tongue is  drawn backward, the tone is shut in.    If the soft-palate is not raised in singing, the tone is diverted into  the cavities of the nose, and that color given to the tone called nasal.  If the lower jaw is held too high, the tone is again forced through the  nose. A nasal quality can be modified by opening the mouth. The muffled  voice is sometimes the result of the tongue's unruly behavior. The  throaty, pinched voice, due to a stiff and pinched throat, will hardly  appear if good conditions as regards position, breathing, soft tone,  open mouth, etc., are maintained. The tone should not be swallowed nor,  on the other hand, blown out of the mouth. It should be formed in the  mouth and kept vibrating within it. When the right conditions are hit  upon, the tone seems to sing itself. Whether soft or loud, the tone  should fill the mouth, so to speak.    It must now be remembered that beauty of tone improves along with growth  of thought and feeling. Encourage discrimination in tone-quality and  help in any way advisable the growth of good ideals, and verily shalt  thou be rewarded.          CHAPTER VI.    VOWELS, CONSONANTS, ARTICULATION.      Sound-vibrations generated at the larynx are modified as to their form,  by the size and shape of the resonating cavities of the mouth and  pharynx. Through the movements of the soft-palate, tongue, lower jaw and  lips, the shape and size of the mouth can, within certain limits, be  changed at will. As every vowel-sound requires a peculiar form of the  resonating cavity for its production, it will be easily understood that  each vowel-sound of which the human voice is capable can be made by a  proper adjustment of the movable parts of the vocal organs. As all  singing-tone is vocal or vowel in its character, the production of the  various vowel-sounds takes precedence in the study of vocal music. Just  how much of this study can be carried on in school music will depend  upon circumstances, the chief of which is the time assigned for music.  It is very easy to suggest that if the time given is not enough, that  longer lesson periods be demanded; but it is quite probable that, owing  to the pressure of elaborate courses of study, the request would be  seldom granted. It remains, then, for those in charge of school music to  expedite their work by means of simple and direct methods.    Each division of the music work must be carried so as to secure unity of  result. The vocal drill, oral or written, will train the eye and ear for  sight-singing, and the sight-singing be a practical application of  correct vocal drill.    The study and practice of the different vowel-sounds must then _fit in_  with the scheme of study. The practice of singing the vowels by name as,  _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_, _u_, is not to be recommended, as only one, namely  _e_, stands for a single sound-element; nor is it probable that the  results will justify extensive drill upon the more obscure  vowel-elements, if the term may be applied to those sounds which are  differentiated only slightly from the more pronounced vowel-sounds.    There are some twenty vowel-sounds that are used in English speech, but  for various reasons a less number are employed in song. For, while it is  desirable to give to each word and syllable its correct vowel-sound in  singing, those which are unfavorable to good tone are usually  approximated to the sound of those more favorable to good tone.    If too marked distinctions in the vowel-sounds are made by the singer,  the result is disagreeable; while if the voice preserves a similar hue  or tone-color throughout, the effect is pleasing.    The listener is unaware of the slight deviations from the spoken  vowel-sound which the singer makes, that the requirements of tonal  beauty may be met.    It is advisable in vowel-practice to avoid letters or symbols which  represent two sounds, an initial and a vanish; and to use simple vowel  elements instead. The combinations of different elements represented by  certain letters and diphthongs may easily be explained when they appear  in the words of a song, if, indeed, the study of phonics has not already  cleared away all difficulties.    In singing, however, it is necessary to understand which of the two  sounds, the initial or the vanish, is to be sustained. In _[-a]_, for  instance, which is _eh_+_e_, if the vanish _e_ is sustained in a word  like _day_ the effect is _deh-ee_. The first sound should be sustained,  and the vanish _e_ be heard only slightly as the mouth partly closes at  the end of the tone. _[-I]_, again, which is equivalent to _ah_+_e_,  is often sung by prolonging the _e_ instead of the initial _ah_, as  _light--li-eet_. _[-O]_ is a compound sound _[-o]_+_[-o][-o]_, but the  tendency to sing the first sound short and prolong the second is very  slight usually. _O_, then, can be used to represent a simple element.  _[-U]_, which equals _e_+_oo_, is best sung by making the initial  sound short and the vanish the longer tone.    It will thus be seen that of the five vowel names, _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_,  _u_, _e_ only stands for one sound, though the two sounds of _o_ are so  closely allied that the vanish is often imperceptible. The sound of [-a]  in [)a]t is the most unfavorable sound for song in the language, and  those extremely consistent singers who wish to use it can do so.    The nasal twang of Yankeedom is a plant that needs no nourishing. Its  roots are grown wide and deep; so much so, that those who love it need  not fear that it will pine away and die, if it bears no fruit of song,  but only that of speech.    The sound of _[)a]_ will survive even if it is unused in song. It should  in singing be broadened nearly to the sound of _ah_.    A number of simple elements are suggested which may be used in various  ways in vocal drill. They are _[-e]_, _[)i]_, _[)e]_, _[:a]_, _[a:]_,  _[-o]_, _[)oo]_. Or _[-e]_ (as in _be_), _[)i]_ (as in _it_), _eh_,  _ah_, _aw_, _[-o]_ (as in _go_), _[)oo]_. The vowel-elements remaining  are each so closely allied to some of those indicated that the attempt  to differentiate them from the above in vowel-drill is hardly worth  while. In fact, the use of _[)i]_-- _i_ as in _it_-- may be omitted if  pupils have learned to sing _[-e]_ with fair breadth of sound, and _oo_  may be dropped in grades above the primary. It is the final sound of  _[-o]_, as before said. This leaves five vowel-elements.      _E._    This vowel is often badly sung, and its form is none too favorable to  good tone even when made as large as distinctness will allow. The lips  must be drawn a little away from the teeth as in a smile, _but don't  overdo it_, and the teeth slightly parted. The lips should not be drawn  back, exposing the teeth and gums, nor should they be contracted and  pressed against the teeth. In _e_ and in all vowel singing the lips  should be relaxed, not contracted, and kept about as far from the teeth  as they are in repose. If the opening of the mouth, that is, if the  cavity back of the teeth is kept too small and narrow, the tone will be  nasal and twangy. The mouth must be opened enough to permit purity of  tone and free emission. The sound should verge toward _i_ in _it_.      _I._    This sound is _[-e]_ broadened. The teeth may be a little farther apart  than when _[-e]_ is sung.      _[)E] or EH._    This is the sound of _e_ in the word _get_. It is also the initial sound  of the vowel _[-a]_ or long _a_. It is true that this sound is not  usually so given, but if _[-a]_ is sung with this sound as its initial  sound, and the one to be prolonged, the very best vocal results can be  obtained. The vowel _[)a]_ is more often poorly sung than otherwise.  This is, perhaps, for the reason that comparatively few singers  recognize that long _a_ stands for two sounds, and that the first, which  may be spelled _eh_, can be sung with large form and placed well forward  in the mouth, while the second sound _[-e]_ is small in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22591"],[0,"A Political History of the State of New York, Volumes 1-3 (#10)"],[1,"unauthorised by the evidence,  and subsequently treated with indifference a legislative threat of  impeachment, based upon a fearless discharge of duty. He could afford  to be just, for, like George Clinton, he had early embraced the cause  of the Colony against the Crown. From an Albany alderman he became a  maker of the State Constitution, and from a writer of patriotic  essays, he shone as an active member of the Committee of Safety.  Together with John Jay and Robert R. Livingston, he had obstructed the  passage of Lord Howe's ships up the Hudson, and with General Schuyler  he devised measures to repel the British from the northern and western  frontier. He had helped to fix the dividing line between Massachusetts  and New York, and, as one of the Council of Administration, he  governed southern New York from the withdrawal of the British until  the assembling of the Legislature.    Having decided to go outside his own party, Hamilton made no mistake  in picking his man. If Clinton was the Hampden of the colonial period,  Robert Yates could well be called its Pym. He had toleration as well  as patriotism. But he also had an itching desire for office. Some one  has said that the close connection between man and a child is never  more clearly illustrated than in the joy and pride which the wisest  statesman feels in the wearing of a ribbon or a star. It could not be  said of Robert Yates then, as it was said, with good reason, six years  later, that his desire for office extinguished his devotion to party  and his character for political consistency, but it was openly charged  that, upon the suggestion of Hamilton, he urged the grand jury to  support the Federal Constitution in order to strengthen himself with  the Federalists. Whether this be true or not, Yates' previous devotion  to the anti-Federalist party set his present conduct in sharp contrast  to that of other distinguished anti-Federalist statesmen of the  time--to men like Samuel Jones and Melancthon Smith, who accepted the  action of the Poughkeepsie convention, but supported George Clinton.  \"Men, not principles, are involved,\" they declared.    All that we know of Yates would seem to deny his surrender of  principle, or his condescension to any act of baseness, to obtain  office. It was indeed a question whether Clinton, or Hamilton through  Yates, should control the state government; but the gubernatorial  contest involved more than that. The new government, soon to be placed  on trial, needed the help of sympathetic governors and legislatures,  and Clinton and his supporters, forced to accept the Constitution,  could hardly be regarded as its wisest and safest guardians. From  Hamilton's standpoint, therefore, it was more principle than men.  However agreeable to him it might be to defeat and humiliate Clinton,  greater satisfaction must spring from the consciousness that while in  its leading-strings, at least, the general government would have the  hearty support of New York.    Hamilton's great coalition, intended to work such wonders, boasted  many brilliant names. Of the younger men Robert Troup, of Hamilton's  age, an early friend of Burr, took a most conspicuous part, while  among the older members of this galaxy was James Duane, a lawyer of  rare ability, the first mayor of New York, for ten years continuously  in the Continental Congress, a man of great force, of large wealth,  and superb character. He was in his forties when Hamilton, a boy of  seventeen, won his heart by a single speech, denouncing the act of  Parliament which closed the port of Boston. The most notable man in  the coalition, next to Hamilton and Jay, was Robert R. Livingston, now  Hamilton's devoted friend, before long to be his bitter enemy. He was  still young, little more than forty, but in everything he was bold and  skilful, vigorous as a writer, eloquent as a speaker, deeply learned  as a jurist, and rich in scholarship. Of the same age as Livingston  was William Duer,[51] who started at eighteen as an aide to Lord Clive  in India. Duer was at one time the most useful man in America. Nobody  could cheat him. As soon as Hamilton became secretary of the  treasury, he made Duer assistant secretary, an office which he held  with credit until 1790, when he resigned to become the chief of a ring  of speculators, who, two years later, left him insolvent and in jail.  Hamilton's coalition also furnished the only instance of the political  association of himself and Burr, although Burr's support of Yates is  said to have been personal rather than political. The story is that  Burr, seeking admission to the bar after reading law less than a year,  induced Judge Yates to suspend the rule requiring three years of  study, because of the applicant's term as a soldier, a service that  laid the foundation of a lasting friendship.    [Footnote 51: It was his son, William Alexander Duer, the brilliant  and accomplished writer, who presided for thirteen years with such  distinguished ability over Columbia College.]    On the opposite side were many men who live in history as builders of  the Empire State. None belong to the gallery of national characters,  perhaps, but John Lansing, Livingston's successor as chancellor, and  Samuel Jones,[52] the first state comptroller, known, by common  consent, as the father of the New York bar, find places in the list of  New York's ablest statesmen. To this memorable company also belonged  Melancthon Smith, the head of the anti-Federalist forces at the  Poughkeepsie convention, and Gilbert Livingston of Dutchess, whose one  patriotic address was the last blow needed to ratify the Constitution.  He was not, like Smith, a great debater, but his ready eloquence  classed him among the orators who were destined to live in the memory  of a later generation. Beside him was James Clinton, brother of the  Governor and father of DeWitt Clinton. A soldier by profession, he had  taken part in several important battles and marches, charging with  Bradstreet at the capture of Fort Frontenac, following the lamented  Montgomery to Quebec, and serving with Sullivan in his famous  expedition against the Indians. Finally, he shared in the glory of  being with Washington at the surrender of Lord Cornwallis. He seems to  have been the real soldier of the family, blending the strong, active  powers of the Clinton mind with the gentler virtues which made him as  sympathetic on the field as he was affectionate in the home.    [Footnote 52: \"No one,\" said Chancellor Kent, writing of Samuel Jones,  \"surpassed him in clearness of intellect and in moderation and  simplicity of character; no one equalled him in his accurate knowledge  of the technical rules and doctrines of real property, and his  familiarity with the skilful and elaborate, but now obsolete and  mysterious, black-letter learning of the common law.\"]    Thus the contest between Yates and Clinton, although the first real  political conflict in the history of the State, became one of the  sharpest and most bitterly fought. For six weeks the atmosphere was  thick and hot with political passion. Veteran observers declared that  their generation had seen nothing like it. But the arguments of Duer,  the powerful influence of Chancellor Livingston, the leadership of  Hamilton, and the phenomenal popularity of John Jay, could not win the  voters who saw nothing more in the arrangement than a question of  individual preference, and while Yates carried the western district by  a large majority and held his own in the southern, Clinton's home  county gave him 1093 out of 1245 votes, making his majority 429 in a  total vote of 12,353.    The call for the Governor was so close that he quickly prepared for a  repetition of the contest in 1792. The inauguration of Washington on  April 30 had given Hamilton control of the federal offices in New  York, and, although of trifling importance compared to state  patronage, they were used to strengthen federalism, and, if possible,  to destroy Clinton. John Jay became chief justice of the Supreme  Court, James Duane judge of the District Court, Richard Harrison  United States attorney, and William S. Smith United States marshal. It  was a brilliant array of talent and legal learning. Of the lights and  ornaments of the law in his day, Richard Harrison excelled in an  intimate knowledge of its intricacies and mysteries. Added to these  officials were Rufus King and Philip Schuyler, United States senators,  and three members of Congress, with Egbert Benson at their head. As  secretary of the treasury and the trusted friend of the President,  Hamilton had also multiplied his personal influence.    Governor Clinton felt the full force of the Federalist combination,  the fear of which had intensified his hostility to the Union; but he  governed his conduct with the toleration and foresight of a master  politician. He declined to punish those who had deserted his standard,  refusing to accept Robert Yates' apostacy as sufficient cause to bar  his promotion as chief justice, and appointing to the vacancy John  Lansing, Jr., who, although a strong anti-Federalist, had already  shown an independence of political domination.    But the master-stroke of Clinton's diplomacy displayed itself in the  appointment of Aaron Burr as attorney-general. After Burr left the  army \"with the character of a true knight,\" as John Adams put it, he  began the practice of law at Albany. Later he removed to New York,  taking up his home in Maiden Lane. Thus far his political career,  limited to two terms in the Legislature, had been insignificant.  During the great controversy over the Federal Constitution he remained  silent. His silence, however, was the silence of concealment. He  shared no confidences, he exploited no principles, he did nothing in  the open. He lived in an air of mystery, writing letters in cipher,  using messengers instead of the mails, and maintaining espionage upon  the"]]]
