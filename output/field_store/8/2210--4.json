For they said, it was a shame to  quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love it, so it was!    In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was  a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners, and the progress of their  cooking, in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker's oven, where the  pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.    'Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?'  asked Scrooge.    'There is. My own.'    'Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?' asked Scrooge.    'To any kindly given. To a poor one most.'    'Why to a poor one most?' asked Scrooge.    'Because it needs it most.'    'Spirit!' said Scrooge, after a moment's thought, 'I wonder you, of all  the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these  people's opportunities of innocent enjoyment.    'I!' cried the Spirit.    'You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day,  often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all,' said  Scrooge; 'wouldn't you?'    'I!' cried the Spirit.    'You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day,' said Scrooge. 'And  it comes to the same thing.'    'I seek!' exclaimed the Spirit.    'Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at least in  that of your family,' said Scrooge.    'There are some upon this earth of yours,' returned the Spirit, 'who  lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride,  ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as  strange to us, and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived.  Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.'    Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on, invisible, as they had  been before, into the suburbs of the town. It was a remarkable quality  of the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker's), that  notwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any  place with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as  gracefully and like a supernatural creature as it was possible he could  have done in any lofty hall.    And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this  power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and  his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge's  clerk's; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his  robe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to  bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinklings of his torch. Think  of that! Bob had but fifteen 'Bob' a week himself; he pocketed on  Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of  Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!    Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out but poorly in a  twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap, and make a  goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda  Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master  Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting  the corners of his monstrous shirt-collar (Bob's private property,  conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day,) into his mouth,  rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his  linen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and  girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt  the goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts  of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and  exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud,  although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow  potatoes, bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out  and peeled.    'What has ever got your precious father, then?' said Mrs. Cratchit. 'And  your brother, Tiny Tim? And Martha warn't as late last Christmas Day by  half an hour!'    'Here's Martha, mother!' said a girl, appearing as she spoke.    'Here's Martha, mother!' cried the two young Cratchits. 'Hurrah! There's  _such_ a goose, Martha!'    'Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!' said Mrs.  Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet  for her with officious zeal.    'We'd a deal of work to finish up last night,' replied the girl, 'and  had to clear away this morning, mother!'    'Well! never mind so long as you are come,' said Mrs. Cratchit. 'Sit ye  down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!'    'No, no! There's father coming,' cried the two young Cratchits, who were  everywhere at once. 'Hide, Martha, hide!'    So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least  three feet of comforter, exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before  him, and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed to look  seasonable, and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a  little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!    'Why, where's our Martha?' cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.    'Not coming,' said Mrs. Cratchit.    'Not coming!' said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits;  for he had been Tim's blood-horse all the way from church, and had come  home rampant. 'Not coming upon Christmas Day!'    Martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so  she came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his  arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off  into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the  copper.    'And how did little Tim behave?' asked Mrs. Cratchit when she had  rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his  heart's content.    'As good as gold,' said Bob, 'and better. Somehow, he gets thoughtful,  sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever  heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the  church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to  remember upon Christmas Day who made lame beggars walk and blind men  see.'    Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when  he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.    His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny  Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and  sister to his stool beside the fire; and while Bob, turning up his  cuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more  shabby--compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and  stirred it round and round, and put it on the hob to simmer, Master  Peter and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose,  with which they soon returned in high procession.    [Illustration]    Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of  all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of  course--and, in truth, it was something very like it in that house. Mrs.  Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing  hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss  Belinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob  took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young  Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and,  mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest  they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At  last the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a  breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the  carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,  and when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of  delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two  young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife and  feebly cried Hurrah!    [Illustration: HE HAD BEEN TIM'S BLOOD-HORSE ALL THE WAY FROM CHURCH]    There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was  such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness,  were the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and  mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;  indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small  atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every  one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular, were  steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being  changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous  to bear witnesses--to take the pudding up, and bring it in.    Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning  out! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard and  stolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which  the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were  supposed.    Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell  like a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and  a pastry-cook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to  that! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit  entered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled  cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of  ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.    Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he  regarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since  their marriage.

These were generally played on such genial recipients as Lettice  Talbot and Madge Summers, but occasionally she would venture on more  dangerous ground. One afternoon, at the end of her first week at  Chessington, she was in the dressing-room, changing her shoes in  preparation for cricket, when Ruth Latimer interposed.    \"I forgot to tell you, Paddy! Games are off to-day.\"    \"Why?\" asked Honor in astonishment, for the hour and a half in the  playing-fields was as strict a part of the college curriculum as the  morning lessons.    \"Because it's the Health Testing.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"A kind of medical examination,\" explained Dorothy Arkwright. \"We  always have it at the beginning of each term, to make sure that, as  Miss Cavendish expresses it, we are 'physically fit for the duties of  school life'.\"    \"Oh!\" said Honor, looking rather aghast at the prospect.    \"You needn't pull such a long face, Paddy,\" said Lettice. \"We none of  us mind; indeed, we think it's a joke.\"    \"We have a lady doctor, you see,\" said Ruth, \"and she's so jolly, she  keeps one laughing all the time.\"    \"What does she do?\"    \"Oh! weighs us, and sounds our lungs, and tests our eyes, and measures  our chests.\"    \"You'll have to draw a deep breath, and to put out your tongue, and to  let her look at your teeth,\" added Lettice.    \"And if any girl is really very much below standard,\" said Dorothy,  \"she is 'turned out to grass'. That means that she only does  half-lessons.\"    \"Of course, she has to be rather bad for that,\" remarked Ruth.    \"It's never been my luck yet!\" lamented Lettice.    \"I should think not, with those fat, red cheeks! You couldn't look  delicate, however hard you tried.\"    \"It happened to Janie Henderson, though, in her first term. How little  did you weigh, Moonie?\"    \"I'm sure I forget,\" returned Janie, who had joined the group.    \"But you had to be fed up on cream and beaten eggs and all kinds of  things. I remember how we envied you.\"    \"Are you weighed in stones or pounds here?\" asked Honor.    \"In stones. It's very puzzling to some of the Colonials, because  they're accustomed to American machines that register in pounds. They  have to do a sum before they can calculate the result.\"    \"When does this exam. come off?\"    \"Some time this afternoon. We go up in relays. It's St. Chad's turn  to-day. On Wednesday it was the School House, and on Thursday, St.  Aldwyth's. Then on Saturday it will be St. Hilary's and St. Bride's. It  takes nearly a week to get through the whole school.\"    The medical examination was to be conducted at the sanatorium, and Dr.  Mary Forbes was already installed there, and busily employed, when  Honor and her classmates arrived.    \"She begins with monitresses, and then works downwards,\" explained  Dorothy. \"I don't expect it will be our turn for half an hour yet, but  we're obliged to stay here, to be ready in case we're called.\"    \"It's not nearly so alarming as the dentist's,\" said Ruth.    The waiting-room was full of girls, who were beguiling the time with  jokes and banter and lively chatter. Lettice, Ruth, and Dorothy soon  mingled in the crowd, and forgot all about their Irish companion until  the voice of Vivian Holmes was heard announcing:    \"Next--Ruth Latimer, Chatty Burns, Madge Summers, and Honor  Fitzgerald.\"    \"Where's Honor?\" asked Lettice. \"She was here just now.\"    \"Why, she's there!--actually outside in the garden,\" replied Dorothy.    \"What's she doing, dodging about the rockery?\"    \"Someone call her--quick!\"    Honor came running in, looking rather flushed and hot, and with a  curious, bulgy appearance about her blouse.    \"Where have you been?\" demanded Ruth, but her question went unanswered,  for Vivian whisked the four girls with scant ceremony into Dr. Mary  Forbes's consulting-room. Time was too precious to be wasted, and the  monitress was something of a disciplinarian. Honor sat watching with  deep interest while first Ruth, then Chatty, and finally Madge were  duly examined and passed as \"sound\". She was called then, and after her  name and age had been entered on her chart, and her height taken, she  was told to step on to the weighing machine. Round swung the pointer,  and stopped at 8 stone 4 lb. Dr. Mary looked at the dial almost  incredulously. She thought there must be something wrong with the  machine.    \"Stand off for a minute,\" she said, \"while I examine the weights. I  must have made a mistake.\"    Honor obeyed, with a very solemn face. She appeared to be taking the  matter with unusual seriousness. Dr. Mary readjusted the lever, and  even oiled the machine; but when Honor stepped on to it again it  registered exactly the same.    \"It's most extraordinary!\" exclaimed the lady doctor. \"For a girl of  your height and slight build I have never known such a record,\" and she  gazed at Honor's rather slender proportions in amazement.    \"I expect it's bones,\" volunteered Honor. \"The Fitzgeralds are a  big-boned family.\"    \"Your bones would have to be of cast iron, to bring you up to eight  stone odd,\" cried Dr. Mary. \"The machine must be at fault. It's absurd,  on the face of it--a small, slim girl like you!\"    \"Perhaps it's the change of air since I arrived,\" said Honor  innocently, but at the same time she looked at Madge Summers with a  very mischievous expression on her face.    \"She's up to something!\" thought Madge, and nudged Ruth, though she  dared not venture to whisper.    \"Of course, we eat a great deal over in Ireland,\" continued Honor.  \"There is nothing like potatoes for making one grow. I saw in the  _British Almanac_ that they were twice as nourishing as anything,  except herrings and oatmeal; and we have those too in Kerry.\"    \"I think, in that case, we must try Banting,\" said Dr. Mary, who must  have caught Honor's glance, for she suddenly took hold of her, and  began feeling her carefully.    \"Ah!\" she exclaimed; \"so these are the extra bones, are they?\" and  diving into her patient's pocket, she drew out stone after stone, and  as many more again that had been tucked down in the front of the white  flannel blouse.    The doctor was a good-tempered woman, with a strong sense of humour,  and, instead of scolding, she laughed heartily at having been taken in  by such a trick.    \"I've had patients who shammed ill before,\" she declared, \"but never  such a scandalous case of imposition as this.\"    \"Well, the girls told me the weight was to be reckoned by stones,\" said  Honor, with a twinkle in her eye, \"so I thought I'd better come well  provided. I'm not at all sorry to be rid of them, if they're not  wanted.\"    \"Get on to that machine again immediately!\" commanded Dr. Mary, with an  effort to be severe. \"Ah! 6 stone 5 lb. is rather a difference. It's  lucky for you I didn't put you on starvation diet to reduce you. Don't  try to be so clever again, or I shall have to perform an operation to  get rid of your cheek!\"    Madge, Ruth, and Chatty had sat chuckling with subdued delight during  the interview, and the moment they were out of the room they published  the story abroad, for the edification of the others.    \"She thinks of such funny things!\" laughed Madge, \"things that nobody  else would ever dream of doing.\"    \"I was afraid she'd get into a fearful scrape,\" confessed Chatty.    \"Oh, Dr. Mary Forbes is too jolly to mind!\" said Ruth. \"She was far  more amused than cross. If it had been Miss Maitland, or Miss  Cavendish, now! But I should imagine that even Honor Fitzgerald would  scarcely dare to play a practical joke upon either of them!\"          CHAPTER V    A Riding Lesson      The College had reopened on a Tuesday, so that by her first Sunday  Honor had been at school five days. In her own estimation it seemed  more like five months, but as she had left home on 24th April, and the  Shakespeare calendar in the recreation room (a leaf of which was torn  off punctually each morning by the monitress) only recorded 29th April,  she was obliged reluctantly to acknowledge the evidence of the almanac,  and realized that twelve whole weeks must intervene before the joyful  termination of what she considered her banishment from Erin.    Sundays were made very pleasant at Chessington. In the morning the  girls attended the parish church at Dunscar. In the afternoon they  might read, or stroll about the grounds where they pleased, an  indulgence not permitted on weekdays. During the summer term they were  allowed to carry their four-o'clock tea into the garden. All was laid  ready by the servants in the dining-hall, and each girl might pour out  her own cup, and, taking what bread and butter she wished, retire with  a few select companions to some nook under the trees, or a seat in an  ivy-covered arbour.    From half-past four to half-past five was \"silence hour\", which  everyone was required to devote to reading from a special library of  books carefully chosen for the purpose by Miss Cavendish.    \"I won't call them Sunday books,\" she sometimes said, \"because I  consider our religion would be a very poor thing if it were only kept  for one day in the week. What we learn in this quiet time we must apply  in our busy hours, and let the helpful words we read influence our  ordinary life and go towards the building of character, which is the  most invaluable of all possessions.\"    At half-past six there was a short service in chapel; and the rest of  the evening, after supper, was given up to the writing of home letters.    All the routine of the school was still new to Honor, and she felt very  strange and unusual as, precisely at ten o'clock, she took her place  among the lines of Chessingtonians marshalled in the quadrangle  preparatory to setting off for church. Miss Cavendish gave the signal  to start, and the two hundred girls filed along two and two, all  dressed alike in white serge coats "]]]
