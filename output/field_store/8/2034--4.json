Lloyd were  taught in the house, by a private tutor--a Mr. Page a tall, gaunt  sapling of a man, who did not speak a dozen words to a slave in a whole  year. The overseers' children go off somewhere to school; and they,  therefore, bring no foreign or dangerous influence from abroad, to  embarrass the natural operation of the slave system of the place. Not  even the mechanics--through whom there is an occasional out-burst  of honest and telling indignation, at cruelty and wrong on other  plantations--are white men, on this plantation. Its whole public is  made up of, and divided into, three classes--SLAVEHOLDERS, SLAVES and  OVERSEERS. Its blacksmiths, wheelwrights, shoemakers, weavers, and  coopers, are slaves. Not even commerce, selfish and iron-hearted at  it is, and ready, as it ever is, to side with the strong against the  weak--the rich against the poor--is trusted or permitted within its  secluded precincts. Whether with a view of guarding against the escape  of its secrets, I know not, but it is a fact, the every leaf and grain  of the produce of this plantation, and those of the neighboring farms  belonging to Col. Lloyd, are transported to Baltimore in Col.  Lloyd's own vessels; every man and boy on board of which--except  the captain--are owned by him. In return, everything brought to the  plantation, comes through the same channel. Thus, even the glimmering  and unsteady light of trade, which sometimes exerts a civilizing  influence, is excluded from this \"tabooed\" spot.{49}    Nearly all the plantations or farms in the vicinity of the \"home  plantation\" of Col. Lloyd, belong to him; and those which do not, are  owned by personal friends of his, as deeply interested in maintaining  the slave system, in all its rigor, as Col. Lloyd himself. Some of his  neighbors are said to be even more stringent than he. The Skinners, the  Peakers, the Tilgmans, the Lockermans, and the Gipsons, are in the same  boat; being slaveholding neighbors, they may have strengthened each  other in their iron rule. They are on intimate terms, and their  interests and tastes are identical.    Public opinion in such a quarter, the reader will see, is not likely to  very efficient in protecting the slave from cruelty. On the contrary,  it must increase and intensify his wrongs. Public opinion seldom differs  very widely from public practice. To be a restraint upon cruelty and  vice, public opinion must emanate from a humane and virtuous community.  To no such humane and virtuous community, is Col. Lloyd's plantation  exposed. That plantation is a little nation of its own, having its  own language, its own rules, regulations and customs. The laws and  institutions of the state, apparently touch it nowhere. The troubles  arising here, are not settled by the civil power of the state. The  overseer is generally accuser, judge, jury, advocate and executioner.  The criminal is always dumb. The overseer attends to all sides of a  case.    There are no conflicting rights of property, for all the people are  owned by one man; and they can themselves own no property. Religion and  politics are alike excluded. One class of the population is too high to  be reached by the preacher; and the other class is too low to be cared  for by the preacher. The poor have the gospel preached to them, in this  neighborhood, only when they are able to pay for it. The slaves, having  no money, get no gospel. The politician keeps away, because the people  have no votes, and the preacher keeps away, because the people have no  money. The rich planter can afford to learn politics in the parlor, and  to dispense with religion altogether.{50}    In its isolation, seclusion, and self-reliant independence, Col. Lloyd's  plantation resembles what the baronial domains were during the middle  ages in Europe. Grim, cold, and unapproachable by all genial influences  from communities without, _there it stands;_ full three hundred years  behind the age, in all that relates to humanity and morals.    This, however, is not the only view that the place presents.  Civilization is shut out, but nature cannot be. Though separated from  the rest of the world; though public opinion, as I have said, seldom  gets a chance to penetrate its dark domain; though the whole place  is stamped with its own peculiar, ironlike individuality; and though  crimes, high-handed and atrocious, may there be committed, with almost  as much impunity as upon the deck of a pirate ship--it is, nevertheless,  altogether, to outward seeming, a most strikingly interesting place,  full of life, activity, and spirit; and presents a very favorable  contrast to the indolent monotony and languor of Tuckahoe. Keen as was  my regret and great as was my sorrow at leaving the latter, I was not  long in adapting myself to this, my new home. A man's troubles are  always half disposed of, when he finds endurance his only remedy. I  found myself here; there was no getting away; and what remained for me,  but to make the best of it? Here were plenty of children to play with,  and plenty of places of pleasant resort for boys of my age, and boys  older. The little tendrils of affection, so rudely and treacherously  broken from around the darling objects of my grandmother's hut,  gradually began to extend, and to entwine about the new objects by which  I now found myself surrounded.    There was a windmill (always a commanding object to a child's eye) on  Long Point--a tract of land dividing Miles river from the Wye a mile or  more from my old master's house. There was a creek to swim in, at the  bottom of an open flat space, of twenty acres or more, called \"the Long  Green\"--a very beautiful play-ground for the children.{51}    In the river, a short distance from the shore, lying quietly at anchor,  with her small boat dancing at her stern, was a large sloop--the Sally  Lloyd; called by that name in honor of a favorite daughter of the  colonel. The sloop and the mill were wondrous things, full of thoughts  and ideas. A child cannot well look at such objects without _thinking_.    Then here were a great many houses; human habitations, full of the  mysteries of life at every stage of it. There was the little red house,  up the road, occupied by Mr. Sevier, the overseer. A little nearer to  my old master's, stood a very long, rough, low building, literally alive  with slaves, of all ages, conditions and sizes. This was called \"the  Longe Quarter.\" Perched upon a hill, across the Long Green, was a very  tall, dilapidated, old brick building--the architectural dimensions of  which proclaimed its erection for a different purpose--now occupied by  slaves, in a similar manner to the Long Quarter. Besides these, there  were numerous other slave houses and huts, scattered around in the  neighborhood, every nook and corner of which was completely occupied.  Old master's house, a long, brick building, plain, but substantial,  stood in the center of the plantation life, and constituted one  independent establishment on the premises of Col. Lloyd.    Besides these dwellings, there were barns, stables, store-houses,  and tobacco-houses; blacksmiths' shops, wheelwrights' shops, coopers'  shops--all objects of interest; but, above all, there stood the grandest  building my eyes had then ever beheld, called, by every one on the  plantation, the \"Great House.\" This was occupied by Col. Lloyd and his  family. They occupied it; _I_ enjoyed it. The great house was surrounded  by numerous and variously shaped out-buildings. There were kitchens,  wash-houses, dairies, summer-house, green-houses, hen-houses,  turkey-houses, pigeon-houses, and arbors, of many sizes and devices,  all neatly painted, and altogether interspersed with grand old trees,  ornamental and primitive, which afforded delightful shade in{52}  summer, and imparted to the scene a high degree of stately beauty. The  great house itself was a large, white, wooden building, with wings  on three sides of it. In front, a large portico, extending the entire  length of the building, and supported by a long range of columns, gave  to the whole establishment an air of solemn grandeur. It was a treat to  my young and gradually opening mind, to behold this elaborate exhibition  of wealth, power, and vanity. The carriage entrance to the house was  a large gate, more than a quarter of a mile distant from it; the  intermediate space was a beautiful lawn, very neatly trimmed, and  watched with the greatest care. It was dotted thickly over with  delightful trees, shrubbery, and flowers. The road, or lane, from the  gate to the great house, was richly paved with white pebbles from the  beach, and, in its course, formed a complete circle around the beautiful  lawn. Carriages going in and retiring from the great house, made the  circuit of the lawn, and their passengers were permitted to behold a  scene of almost Eden-like beauty. Outside this select inclosure, were  parks, where as about the residences of the English nobility--rabbits,  deer, and other wild game, might be seen, peering and playing about,  with none to molest them or make them afraid. The tops of the stately  poplars were often covered with the red-winged black-birds, making all  nature vocal with the joyous life and beauty of their wild, warbling  notes. These all belonged to me, as well as to Col. Edward Lloyd, and  for a time I greatly enjoyed them.    A short distance from the great house, were the stately mansions of  the dead, a place of somber aspect. Vast tombs, embowered beneath the  weeping willow and the fir tree, told of the antiquities of the Lloyd  family, as well as of their wealth. Superstition was rife among the  slaves about this family burying ground. Strange sights had been seen  there by some of the older slaves. Shrouded ghosts, riding on great  black horses, had been seen to enter; balls of fire had been seen to fly  there at midnight, and horrid sounds had been repeatedly heard."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2020"],[0,"Tarzan the Terrible (#10)"],[1,"that we might pause  and fight; but first we must warn Es-sat and our people.\"    \"Yes,\" said Om-at, \"we must warn our people.\"    \"Es-sat is dead,\" said In-sad.    \"Who is chief?\" asked one of An-un's sons.    \"Om-at,\" replied O-dan.    \"It is well,\" cried An-un. \"Pan-at-lee said that you would come back  and slay Es-sat.\"    Now the enemy broke into sight behind them.    \"Come!\" cried Tarzan, \"let us turn and charge them, raising a great  cry. They pursued but three and when they see eight charging upon them  they will think that many men have come to do battle. They will believe  that there are more even than they see and then one who is swift will  have time to reach the gorge and warn your people.\"    \"It is well,\" said Om-at. \"Id-an, you are swift--carry word to the  warriors of Kor-ul-JA that we fight the Kor-ul-lul upon the ridge and  that Ab-on shall send a hundred men.\"    Id-an, the son of An-un, sped swiftly toward the cliff-dwellings of the  Kor-ul-JA while the others charged the oncoming Kor-ul-lul, the war  cries of the two tribes rising and falling in a certain grim harmony.  The leaders of the Kor-ul-lul paused at sight of the reinforcements,  waiting apparently for those behind to catch up with them and,  possibly, also to learn how great a force confronted them. The leaders,  swifter runners than their fellows, perhaps, were far in advance while  the balance of their number had not yet emerged from the brush; and now  as Om-at and his companions fell upon them with a ferocity born of  necessity they fell back, so that when their companions at last came in  sight of them they appeared to be in full rout. The natural result was  that the others turned and fled.    Encouraged by this first success Om-at followed them into the brush,  his little company charging valiantly upon his either side, and loud  and terrifying were the savage yells with which they pursued the  fleeing enemy. The brush, while not growing so closely together as to  impede progress, was of such height as to hide the members of the party  from one another when they became separated by even a few yards. The  result was that Tarzan, always swift and always keen for battle, was  soon pursuing the enemy far in the lead of the others--a lack of  prudence which was to prove his undoing.    The warriors of Kor-ul-lul, doubtless as valorous as their foemen,  retreated only to a more strategic position in the brush, nor were they  long in guessing that the number of their pursuers was fewer than their  own. They made a stand then where the brush was densest--an ambush it  was, and into this ran Tarzan of the Apes. They tricked him neatly.  Yes, sad as is the narration of it, they tricked the wily jungle lord.  But then they were fighting on their own ground, every foot of which  they knew as you know your front parlor, and they were following their  own tactics, of which Tarzan knew nothing.    A single black warrior appeared to Tarzan a laggard in the rear of the  retreating enemy and thus retreating he lured Tarzan on.  At last he  turned at bay confronting the ape-man with bludgeon and drawn knife and  as Tarzan charged him a score of burly Waz-don leaped from the  surrounding brush. Instantly, but too late, the giant Tarmangani  realized his peril. There flashed before him a vision of his lost mate  and a great and sickening regret surged through him with the  realization that if she still lived she might no longer hope, for  though she might never know of the passing of her lord the fact of it  must inevitably seal her doom.    And consequent to this thought there enveloped him a blind frenzy of  hatred for these creatures who dared thwart his purpose and menace the  welfare of his wife. With a savage growl he threw himself upon the  warrior before him twisting the heavy club from the creature's hand as  if he had been a little child, and with his left fist backed by the  weight and sinew of his giant frame, he crashed a shattering blow to  the center of the Waz-don's face--a blow that crushed the bones and  dropped the fellow in his tracks. Then he swung upon the others with  their fallen comrade's bludgeon striking to right and left mighty,  unmerciful blows that drove down their own weapons until that wielded  by the ape-man was splintered and shattered. On either hand they fell  before his cudgel; so rapid the delivery of his blows, so catlike his  recovery that in the first few moments of the battle he seemed  invulnerable to their attack; but it could not last--he was outnumbered  twenty to one and his undoing came from a thrown club. It struck him  upon the back of the head. For a moment he stood swaying and then like  a great pine beneath the woodsman's ax he crashed to earth.    Others of the Kor-ul-lul had rushed to engage the balance of Om-at's  party. They could be heard fighting at a short distance and it was  evident that the Kor-ul-JA were falling slowly back and as they fell  Om-at called to the missing one: \"Tarzan the Terrible! Tarzan the  Terrible!\"    \"Jad-guru, indeed,\" repeated one of the Kor-ul-lul rising from where  Tarzan had dropped him. \"Tarzan-jad-guru! He was worse than that.\"        5    In the Kor-ul-GRYF    As Tarzan fell among his enemies a man halted many miles away upon the  outer verge of the morass that encircles Pal-ul-don.  Naked he was  except for a loin cloth and three belts of cartridges, two of which  passed over his shoulders, crossing upon his chest and back, while the  third encircled his waist. Slung to his back by its leathern  sling-strap was an Enfield, and he carried too a long knife, a bow and  a quiver of arrows. He had come far, through wild and savage lands,  menaced by fierce beasts and fiercer men, yet intact to the last  cartridge was the ammunition that had filled his belts the day that he  set out.    The bow and the arrows and the long knife had brought him thus far  safely, yet often in the face of great risks that could have been  minimized by a single shot from the well-kept rifle at his back. What  purpose might he have for conserving this precious ammunition? in  risking his life to bring the last bright shining missile to his  unknown goal? For what, for whom were these death-dealing bits of metal  preserved? In all the world only he knew.    When Pan-at-lee stepped over the edge of the cliff above Kor-ul-lul she  expected to be dashed to instant death upon the rocks below; but she  had chosen this in preference to the rending fangs of JA. Instead,  chance had ordained that she make the frightful plunge at a point where  the tumbling river swung close beneath the overhanging cliff to eddy  for a slow moment in a deep pool before plunging madly downward again  in a cataract of boiling foam, and water thundering against rocks.    Into this icy pool the girl shot, and down and down beneath the watery  surface until, half choked, yet fighting bravely, she battled her way  once more to air. Swimming strongly she made the opposite shore and  there dragged herself out upon the bank to lie panting and spent until  the approaching dawn warned her to seek concealment, for she was in the  country of her people's enemies.    Rising, she moved into the concealment of the rank vegetation that  grows so riotously in the well-watered kors[1] of Pal-ul-don.    Hidden amidst the plant life from the sight of any who might chance to  pass along the well-beaten trail that skirted the river Pan-at-lee  sought rest and food, the latter growing in abundance all about her in  the form of fruits and berries and succulent tubers which she scooped  from the earth with the knife of the dead Es-sat.    Ah! if she had but known that he was dead! What trials and risks and  terrors she might have been saved; but she thought that he still lived  and so she dared not return to Kor-ul-JA. At least not yet while his  rage was at white heat. Later, perhaps, her father and brothers  returned to their cave, she might risk it; but not now--not now. Nor  could she for long remain here in the neighborhood of the hostile  Kor-ul-lul and somewhere she must find safety from beasts before the  night set in.    As she sat upon the bole of a fallen tree seeking some solution of the  problem of existence that confronted her, there broke upon her ears  from up the gorge the voices of shouting men--a sound that she  recognized all too well. It was the war cry of the Kor-ul-lul. Closer  and closer it approached her hiding place.  Then, through the veil of  foliage she caught glimpses of three figures fleeing along the trail,  and behind them the shouting of the pursuers rose louder and louder as  they neared her. Again she caught sight of the fugitives crossing the  river below the cataract and again they were lost to sight. And now the  pursuers came into view--shouting Kor-ul-lul warriors, fierce and  implacable. Forty, perhaps fifty of them. She waited breathless; but  they did not swerve from the trail and passed her, unguessing that an  enemy she lay hid within a few yards of them.    Once again she caught sight of the pursued--three Waz-don warriors  clambering the cliff face at a point where portions of the summit had  fallen away presenting a steep slope that might be ascended by such as  these. Suddenly her attention was riveted upon the three. Could it be?  O Jad-ben-Otho! had she but known a moment before. When they passed she  might have joined them, for they were her father and two brothers. Now  it was too late. With bated breath and tense muscles she watched the  race. Would they reach the summit? Would the Kor-ul-lul overhaul them?  They climbed well, but, oh, so slowly. Now one lost his footing in the  loose shale and slipped back! The Kor-ul-lul were ascending--one hurled  his club at the nearest fugitive. The Great God was pleased with the  brother of Pan-at-lee, for he caused the club to fall short of its  target, and to fall, rolling and bounding, back upon its owner carrying  him from his "]]]
