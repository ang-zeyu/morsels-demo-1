A sideboard was set out just under this chivalric trophy,  on which was a display of plate that might have vied (at least in  variety) with Belshazzar's parade of the vessels of the temple;  \"flagons, cans, cups, beakers, goblets, basins, and ewers;\" the gorgeous  utensils of good companionship, that had gradually accumulated through  many generations of jovial housekeepers. Before these stood the two Yule  candles beaming like two stars of the first magnitude; other lights were  distributed in branches, and the whole array glittered like a firmament  of silver.    [Illustration]    [Illustration: \"Never did Christmas board display a more goodly and  gracious assemblage of countenances.\"--PAGE 123.]    [Illustration]    We were ushered into this banqueting scene with the sound of minstrelsy,  the old harper being seated on a stool beside the fireplace, and  twanging his instrument with a vast deal more power than melody. Never  did Christmas board display a more goodly and gracious assemblage of  countenances: those who were not handsome were, at least, happy; and  happiness is a rare improver of your hard-favoured visage. I always  consider an old English family as well worth studying as a collection of  Holbein's portraits or Albert Durer's prints. There is much antiquarian  lore to be acquired; much knowledge of the physiognomies of former  times. Perhaps it may be from having continually before their eyes those  rows of old family portraits, with which the mansions of this country  are stocked; certain it is, that the quaint features of antiquity are  often most faithfully perpetuated in these ancient lines; and I have  traced an old family nose through a whole picture gallery, legitimately  handed down from generation to generation, almost from the time of the  Conquest. Something of the kind was to be observed in the worthy company  around me. Many of their faces had evidently originated in a Gothic age,  and been merely copied by succeeding generations; and there was one  little girl, in particular, of staid demeanour, with a high Roman nose,  and an antique vinegar aspect, who was a great favourite of the  Squire's, being, as he said, a Bracebridge all over, and the very  counterpart of one of his ancestors who figured in the court of Henry  VIII.    [Illustration]    The parson said grace, which was not a short familiar one, such as is  commonly addressed to the Deity, in these unceremonious days; but a  long, courtly, well-worded one of the ancient school. There was now a  pause, as if something was expected; when suddenly the butler entered  the hall with some degree of bustle: he was attended by a servant on  each side with a large wax-light, and bore a silver dish, on which was  an enormous pig's head decorated with rosemary, with a lemon in its  mouth, which was placed with great formality at the head of the table.  The moment this pageant made its appearance, the harper struck up a  flourish; at the conclusion of which the young Oxonian, on receiving a  hint from the Squire, gave, with an air of the most comic gravity, an  old carol, the first verse of which was as follows:--                Caput apri defero              Reddens laudes Domino.            The boar's head in hand bring I,            With garlands gay and rosemary.            I pray you all synge merily              Qui estis in convivio.    [Illustration]    Though prepared to witness many of these little eccentricities, from  being apprised of the peculiar hobby of mine host; yet, I confess, the  parade with which so odd a dish was introduced somewhat perplexed me,  until I gathered from the conversation of the Squire and the parson that  it was meant to represent the bringing in of the boar's head: a dish  formerly served up with much ceremony, and the sound of minstrelsy and  song, at great tables on Christmas day. \"I like the old custom,\" said  the Squire, \"not merely because it is stately and pleasing in itself,  but because it was observed at the College of Oxford, at which I was  educated. When I hear the old song chanted, it brings to mind the time  when I was young and gamesome--and the noble old college-hall--and my  fellow-students loitering about in their black gowns; many of whom, poor  lads, are now in their graves!\"    The parson, however, whose mind was not haunted by such associations,  and who was always more taken up with the text than the sentiment,  objected to the Oxonian's version of the carol; which he affirmed was  different from that sung at college. He went on, with the dry  perseverance of a commentator, to give the college reading, accompanied  by sundry annotations: addressing himself at first to the company at  large; but finding their attention gradually diverted to other talk, and  other objects, he lowered his tone as his number of auditors diminished,  until he concluded his remarks, in an under voice, to a fat-headed old  gentleman next him, who was silently engaged in the discussion of a huge  plateful of turkey.[I]    [Illustration]    The table was literally loaded with good cheer, and presented an epitome  of country abundance, in this season of overflowing larders. A  distinguished post was allotted to \"ancient sirloin,\" as mine host  termed it; being, as he added, \"the standard of old English hospitality,  and a joint of goodly presence, and full of expectation.\" There were  several dishes quaintly decorated, and which had evidently something  traditionary in their embellishments; but about which, as I did not like  to appear over-curious, I asked no questions.    [Illustration]    I could not, however, but notice a pie, magnificently decorated with  peacocks' feathers, in imitation of the tail of that bird, which  overshadowed a considerable tract of the table. This the Squire  confessed, with some little hesitation, was a pheasant-pie, though a  peacock-pie was certainly the most authentical; but there had been such  a mortality among the peacocks this season, that he could not prevail  upon himself to have one killed.[J]    It would be tedious, perhaps, to my wiser readers, who may not have that  foolish fondness for odd and obsolete things to which I am a little  given, were I to mention the other makeshifts of this worthy old  humorist, by which he was endeavouring to follow up, though at humble  distance, the quaint customs of antiquity. I was pleased, however, to  see the respect shown to his whims by his children and relatives; who,  indeed, entered readily into the full spirit of them, and seemed all  well versed in their parts; having doubtless been present at many a  rehearsal. I was amused, too, at the air of profound gravity with which  the butler and other servants executed the duties assigned them, however  eccentric. They had an old-fashioned look; having, for the most part,  been brought up in the household, and grown into keeping with the  antiquated mansion, and the humours of its lord; and most probably  looked upon all his whimsical regulations as the established laws of  honourable housekeeping.    [Illustration]    When the cloth was removed, the butler brought in a huge silver vessel  of rare and curious workmanship, which he placed before the Squire. Its  appearance was hailed with acclamation; being the Wassail Bowl, so  renowned in Christmas festivity. The contents had been prepared by the  Squire himself; for it was a beverage in the skilful mixture of which he  particularly prided himself; alleging that it was too abstruse and  complex for the comprehension of an ordinary servant. It was a potation,  indeed, that might well make the heart of a toper leap within him; being  composed of the richest and raciest wines, highly spiced and sweetened,  with roasted apples bobbing about the surface.[K]    The old gentleman's whole countenance beamed with a serene look of  indwelling delight, as he stirred this mighty bowl. Having raised it to  his lips, with a hearty wish of a merry Christmas to all present, he  sent it brimming round the board, for every one to follow his example,  according to the primitive style; pronouncing it \"the ancient fountain  of good feeling, where all hearts met together.\"[L]    [Illustration]    There was much laughing and rallying as the honest emblem of Christmas  joviality circulated, and was kissed rather coyly by the ladies. When  it reached Master Simon he raised it in both hands, and with the air of  a boon companion struck up an old Wassail chanson:              The browne bowle,            The merry browne bowle,            As it goes round about-a,                Fill                Still,            Let the world say what it will,            And drink your fill all out-a.              The deep canne,            The merry deep canne,            As thou dost freely quaff-a,                Sing,                Fling,            Be as merry as a king,            And sound a lusty laugh-a.[M]    Much of the conversation during dinner turned upon family topics, to  which I was a stranger. There was, however, a great deal of rallying of  Master Simon about some gay widow, with whom he was accused of having a  flirtation. This attack was commenced by the ladies; but it was  continued throughout the dinner by the fat-headed old gentleman next the  parson, with the persevering assiduity of a slow-hound; being one of  those long-winded jokers, who, though rather dull at starting game, are  unrivalled for their talents in hunting it down. At every pause in the  general conversation, he renewed his bantering in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2066"],[0,"Wildfire (#10)"],[1,"he went off into the cedars to find Nagger and the mustang  that he used to carry a pack. Nagger was grazing in a little open patch  among the trees, but the pack-horse was missing. Slone seemed to know  in what direction to go to find the trail, for he came upon it very  soon. The pack-horse wore hobbles, but he belonged to the class that  could cover a great deal of ground when hobbled. Slone did not expect  the horse to go far, considering that the grass thereabouts was good.  But in a wild-horse country it was not safe to give any horse a chance.  The call of his wild brethren was irresistible. Slone, however, found  the mustang standing quietly in a clump of cedars, and, removing the  hobbles, he mounted and rode back to camp. Nagger caught sight of him  and came at his call.    This horse Nagger appeared as unique in his class as Slone was rare  among riders. Nagger seemed of several colors, though black  predominated. His coat was shaggy, almost woolly, like that of a sheep.  He was huge, raw-boned, knotty, long of body and long of leg, with the  head of a war charger. His build did not suggest speed. There appeared  to be something slow and ponderous about him, similar to an elephant,  with the same suggestion of power and endurance.   Slone discarded the  pack-saddle and bags. The latter were almost empty. He roped the  tarpaulin on the back of the mustang, and, making a small bundle of his  few supplies, he tied that to the tarpaulin. His blanket he used for a  saddle-blanket on Nagger. Of the utensils left by the Stewarts he chose  a couple of small iron pans, with long handles. The rest he left. In  his saddle-bags he had a few extra horseshoes, some nails, bullets for  his rifle, and a knife with a heavy blade.    \"Not a rich outfit for a far country,\" he mused. Slone did not talk  very much, and when he did he addressed Nagger and himself  simultaneously. Evidently he expected a long chase, one from which he  would not return, and light as his outfit was it would grow too heavy.    Then he mounted and rode down the gradual slope, facing the valley and  the black, bold, flat mountain to the southeast. Some few hundred yards  from camp he halted Nagger and bent over in the saddle to scrutinize  the ground.    The clean-cut track of a horse showed in the bare, hard sand. The  hoof-marks were large, almost oval, perfect in shape, and manifestly  they were beautiful to Lin Slone. He gazed at them for a long time, and  then he looked across the dotted red valley up the vast ridgy steps,  toward the black plateau and beyond. It was the look that an Indian  gives to a strange country. Then Slone slipped off the saddle and knelt  to scrutinize the horse tracks. A little sand had blown into the  depressions, and some of it was wet and some of it was dry. He took his  time about examining it, and he even tried gently blowing other sand  into the tracks, to compare that with what was already there. Finally  he stood up and addressed Nagger.    \"Reckon we won't have to argue with Abe an' Bill this mornin',\" he  said, with satisfaction. \"Wildfire made that track yesterday, before  sun-up.\"    Thereupon Slone remounted and put Nagger to a trot. The pack-horse  followed with an alacrity that showed he had no desire for loneliness.    As straight as a bee-line Wildfire had left a trail down into the floor  of the valley. He had not stopped to graze, and he had not looked for  water. Slone had hoped to find a water-hole in one of the deep washes  in the red earth, but if there had been any water there Wildfire would  have scented it. He had not had a drink for three days that Slone knew  of. And Nagger had not drunk for forty hours. Slone had a canvas  water-bag hanging over the pommel, but it was a habit of his to deny  himself, as far as possible, till his horse could drink also. Like an  Indian, Slone ate and drank but little.    It took four hours of steady trotting to reach the middle and bottom of  that wide, flat valley. A network of washes cut up the whole center of  it, and they were all as dry as bleached bone. To cross these Slone had  only to keep Wildfire's trail. And it was proof of Nagger's quality  that he did not have to veer from the stallion's course.    It was hot down in the lowland. The heat struck up, reflected from the  sand. But it was a March sun, and no more than pleasant to Slone. The  wind rose, however, and blew dust and sand in the faces of horse and  rider. Except lizards, Slone did not see any living things.    Miles of low greasewood and sparse yellow sage led to the first almost  imperceptible rise of the valley floor on that side. The distant cedars  beckoned to Slone. He was not patient, because he was on the trail of  Wildfire; but, nevertheless, the hours seemed short.    Slone had no past to think about, and the future held nothing except a  horse, and so his thoughts revolved the possibilities connected with  this chase of Wildfire. The chase was hopeless in such country as he  was traversing, and if Wildfire chose to roam around valleys like this  one Slone would fail utterly. But the stallion had long ago left his  band of horses, and then, one by one his favorite consorts, and now he  was alone, headed with unerring instinct for wild, untrammeled ranges.  He had been used to the pure, cold water and the succulent grass of the  cold desert uplands. Assuredly he would not tarry in such barren lands  as these.    For Slone an ever-present and growing fascination lay in Wildfire's  clear, sharply defined tracks. It was as if every hoof-mark told him  something. Once, far up the interminable ascent, he found on a  ridge-top tracks showing where Wildfire had halted and turned.    \"Ha, Nagger!\" cried Slone, exultingly. \"Look there! He's begun facin'  about. He's wonderin' if we're still after him. He's worried.... But  we'll keep out of sight--a day behind.\"    When Slone reached the cedars the sun was low down in the west. He  looked back across the fifty miles of valley to the colored cliffs and  walls. He seemed to be above them now, and the cool air, with tang of  cedar and juniper, strengthened the impression that he had climbed high.    A mile or more ahead of him rose a gray cliff with breaks in it and a  line of dark cedars or pinyons on the level rims. He believed these  breaks to be the mouths of canyons, and so it turned out. Wildfire's  trail led into the mouth of a narrow canyon with very steep and high  walls. Nagger snorted his perception of water, and the mustang  whistled. Wildfire's tracks led to a point under the wall where a  spring gushed forth. There were mountain-lion and deer tracks also, as  well as those of smaller game.    Slone made camp here. The mustang was tired. But Nagger, upon taking a  long drink, rolled in the grass as if he had just begun the trip. After  eating, Slone took his rifle and went out to look for deer. But there  appeared to be none at hand. He came across many lion tracks and saw,  with apprehension, where one had taken Wildfire's trail. Wildfire had  grazed up the canyon, keeping on and on, and he was likely to go miles  in a night. Slone reflected that as small as were his own chances of  getting Wildfire, they were still better than those of a mountain-lion.  Wildfire was the most cunning of all animals--a wild stallion; his  speed and endurance were incomparable; his scent as keen as those  animals that relied wholly upon scent to warn them of danger, and as  for sight, it was Slone's belief that no hoofed creature, except the  mountain-sheep used to high altitudes, could see as far as a wild horse.    It bothered Slone a little that he was getting into a lion country.  Nagger showed nervousness, something unusual for him. Slone tied both  horses with long halters and stationed them on patches of thick grass.  Then he put a cedar stump on the fire and went to sleep. Upon awakening  and going to the spring he was somewhat chagrined to see that deer had  come down to drink early. Evidently they were numerous. A lion country  was always a deer country, for the lions followed the deer.    Slone was packed and saddled and on his way before the sun reddened the  canyon wall. He walked the horses. From time to time he saw signs of  Wildfire's consistent progress. The canyon narrowed and the walls grew  lower and the grass increased. There was a decided ascent all the time.  Slone could find no evidence that the canyon had ever been traveled by  hunters or Indians. The day was pleasant and warm and still. Every once  in a while a little breath of wind would bring a fragrance of cedar and  pinyon, and a sweet hint of pine and sage. At every turn he looked  ahead, expecting to see the green of pine and the gray of sage. Toward  the middle of the afternoon, coming to a place where Wildfire had taken  to a trot, he put Nagger to that gait, and by sundown had worked up to  where the canyon was only a shallow ravine. And finally it turned once  more, to lose itself in a level where straggling pines stood high above  the cedars, and great, dark-green silver spruces stood above the pines.  And here were patches of sage, fresh and pungent, and long reaches of  bleached grass. It was the edge of a forest. Wildfire's trail went on.  Slone came at length to a group of pines, and here he found the remains  of a camp-fire, and some flint arrow-heads. Indians had been in there,  probably having come from the opposite direction to Slone's. This  encouraged him, for where Indians could hunt so could he. Soon he was  entering a forest where cedars and pinyons and pines began to grow  thickly. Presently he came upon a faintly defined trail, just a dim,  dark line even to an experienced eye. But it was a trail, and Wildfire  had taken it.    Slone halted for the night. The air was cold. And the dampness of it  gave him an idea there were snow-banks somewhere not far distant. The  dew was already heavy on the grass. He hobbled the horses and "]]]
