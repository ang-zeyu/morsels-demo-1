In the following words the sound of _s_ is represented by _c_ followed  by a vowel that makes this letter soft:    city  face  ice  juice  lace  necessary  nuisance  once  pencil  police  policy  pace  race  rice  space  trace  twice  trice  thrice  nice  price  slice=  lice  spice  circus  citron  circumstance  centre  cent  cellar  certain  circle  concert  concern  cell  dunce  decide  December  dance  disgrace  exercise  excellent  except  force=  fleece  fierce  furnace  fence  grocer  grace  icicle  instance  innocent  indecent  decent  introduce  juice  justice  lettuce  medicine  mercy  niece  ounce  officer  patience  peace=  piece  place  principal  principle  parcel  produce  prejudice  trace  voice  receipt  recite  cite  sauce  saucer  sentence  scarcely  since  silence  service  crevice  novice    Words ending in cal and cle.    Words in _cal_ are nearly all derived from other words ending in _ic,_  as _classical, cubical, clerical,_ etc.  Words ending in _cle_ are  (as far as English is concerned) original words, as _cuticle,  miracle, manacle,_ etc.  When in doubt, ask the question if, on  dropping the _al_ or _le,_ a complete word ending in _ic_ would be left.  If such a word is left, the ending is _al,_ if not, it is probably _le_.    Er and re.    Webster spells _theater, center, meter,_ etc., with the termination  _er,_ but most English writers prefer _re.  Meter_ is more used to  denote a device for measuring (as a \"gas meter\"), _meter_ as the French  unit of length (in the \"Metric system\").  In words like _acre_ even  Webster retains _re_ because _er_ would make the _c_ (or _g_) soft.    Words ending in er, ar, or.    First, let it be said that in most words these three syllables  (_er, ar, or_), are pronounced very nearly if not exactly alike (except  a few legal terms in or, like _mort'gageor_), and we should not try to  give an essentially different sound to _ar_ or _or_* from that we give  to _er_.  The ending _er_ is the regular one, and those words ending in  _ar_ or _or_ are very few in number.  They constitute the exceptions.     *While making no especial difference in the vocalization of these  syllables, careful speakers dwell on them a trifle longer than they do  on _er_.    Common words ending in _ar_ with the sound of _er_:    liar  collar  beggar  burglar  solar  cedar  jugular  scholar=  calendar  secular  dollar  grammar  tabular  poplar  pillar  sugar=  jocular  globular  mortar  lunar  vulgar  popular  insular  Templar=  ocular  muscular  nectar  similar  tubular  altar (for worship)  singular    In some words we have the same syllable with the same sound in the next  to the last syllable, as in _solitary, preliminary, ordinary,  temporary_.  etc.  The syllable _ard_ with the sound of _erd_ is also  found, as in _standard, wizard, mustard, mallard,_ etc.    Common words ending in _or_ with the sound of _er_:    honor  valor  mayor  sculptor  prior  ardor  clamor  labor  tutor  warrior  razor  flavor  auditor  juror  favor  tumor  editor  vigor  actor  author  conductor  savior  visitor  elevator  parlor  ancestor  captor  creditor  victor=  error  proprietor  arbor  chancellor  debtor  doctor  instructor  successor  rigor  senator  suitor  traitor  donor  inventor  odor  conqueror  senior  tenor  tremor  bachelor  junior  oppressor  possessor  liquor  surveyor  vapor  governor  languor  professor=  spectator  competitor  candor  harbor  meteor  orator  rumor  splendor  elector  executor  factor  generator  impostor  innovator  investor  legislator  narrator  navigator  numerator  operator  originator  perpetrator  personator  predecessor  protector  prosecutor  projector  reflector  regulator=  sailor  senator  separator  solicitor  supervisor  survivor  tormentor  testator  transgressor  translator  divisor  director  dictator  denominator  creator  counsellor  councillor  administrator  aggressor  agitator  arbitrator  assessor  benefactor  collector  compositor  conspirator  constructor  contributor  tailor    The _o_ and _a_ in such words as the above are retained in the English  spelling because they were found in the Latin roots from which the words  were derived.  Some, though not all, of the above words in or are  usually spelled in England with our, as _splendour, saviour,_ etc., and  many books printed in this country for circulation in England retain  this spelling.  See {end of a}p{pendix} ..      Words ending in able and ible.    Another class of words in which we are often confused is those which end  in _able_ or _ible_.  The great majority end in _able,_ but a few  derived from Latin words in _ibilis_ retain the _i_.  A brief list of  common words ending in _ible_ is subjoined:    compatible  compressible  convertible  forcible  enforcible  gullible  horrible  sensible  terrible  possible  visible=  perceptible  susceptible  audible  credible  combustible  eligible  intelligible  irascible  inexhaustible  reversible=  plausible  permissible  accessible  digestible  responsible  admissible  fallible  flexible  incorrigible  irresistible=  ostensible  tangible  contemptible  divisible  discernible  corruptible  edible  legible  indelible  indigestible    Of course when a soft _g_ precedes the doubtful letter, as in _legible,_  we are always certain that we should write _i,_ not _a_.  All words formed  from plain English words add _able_.  Those familiar with Latin will have  little difficulty in recognizing the _i_ as an essential part of the root.    Words ending in ent and ant, and ence and ance.    Another class of words concerning which we must also feel doubt is that  terminating in _ence_ and _ance,_ or _ant_ and _ent_.  All these words  are from the Latin, and the difference in termination is usually due to  whether they come from verbs of the first conjugation or of other  conjugations.  As there is no means of distinguishing, we must  continually refer to the dictionary till we have learned each one.  We present a brief list:      ent  confident  belligerent  independent  transcendent  competent  insistent  consistent  convalescent  correspondent  corpulent  dependent  despondent  expedient  impertinent  inclement  insolvent  intermittent  prevalent  superintendent  recipient  proficient  efficient  eminent  excellent  fraudulent  latent  opulent  convenient  corpulent  descendent  different=      ant  abundant  accountant  arrogant  assailant  assistant  attendant  clairvoyant  combatant  recreant  consonant  conversant  defendant  descendent  discordant  elegant  exorbitant  important  incessant  irrelevant  luxuriant  malignant  petulant  pleasant  poignant  reluctant  stagnant  triumphant  vagrant  warrant  attendant  repentant    A few of these words may have either termination according to the  meaning, as _confident_ (adj.) and _confidant_ (noun).  Usually the noun  ends in _ant,_ the adjective in _ent_.  Some words ending in _ant_ are  used both as noun and as adjective, as _attendant_.  The abstract nouns  in _ence_ or _ance_ correspond to the adjectives.  But there are several  of which the adjective form does not appear in the above list:      ence  abstinence  existence  innocence  diffidence  diligence  essence  indigence  negligence  obedience  occurrence  reverence  vehemence  residence  violence  reminiscence  intelligence  presence  prominence  prudence  reference  reverence  transference  turbulence  consequence  indolence  patience  beneficence  preference=      ance  annoyance  cognizance  vengeance  compliance  conveyance  ignorance  grievance  fragrance  pittance  alliance  defiance  acquaintance  deliverance  appearance  accordance  countenance  sustenance  remittance  connivance  resistance  nuisance  utterance  variance  vigilance  maintenance  forbearance  temperance  repentance    Vowels e and i before ous.    The vowels _e_ and _i_ sometimes have the value of the consonant _y,_  as _e_ in _righteous_.  There is also no clear distinction in sound  between _eous_ and _ions_.  The following lists are composed chiefly of  words in which the _e_ or the _i_ has its usual value.*  In which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19721"],[0,"The Literary World Seventh Reader (#10)"],[1,"mastered the fleeting intention;      But when were ended the troth and the prayer and the last benediction,      Into the room it strode, and the people beheld with amazement      Bodily there in his armor Miles Standish, the Captain of Plymouth!        Grasping the bridegroom's hand, he said with emotion, \"Forgive me!      I have been angry and hurt,--too long have I cherished the feeling;      I have been cruel and hard, but now, thank God! it is ended.      Mine is the same hot blood that leaped in the veins of Hugh Standish,      Sensitive, swift to resent, but as swift in atoning for error.      Never so much as now was Miles Standish the friend of John Alden.\"      Thereupon answered the bridegroom: \"Let all be forgotten between us,--      All save the dear old friendship, and that shall grow older and          dearer!\"      Then the Captain advanced, and, bowing, saluted Priscilla,      Wishing her joy of her wedding, and loudly lauding her husband.      Then he said with a smile: \"I should have remembered the adage,--      If you would be well served, you must serve yourself; and, moreover,      No man can gather cherries in Kent at the season of Christmas!\"        Great was the people's amazement, and greater yet their rejoicing,      Thus to behold once more the sunburnt face of their Captain,      Whom they had mourned as dead; and they gathered and crowded about him,      Eager to see him and hear him, forgetful of bride and of bridegroom,      Questioning, answering, laughing, and each interrupting the other,      Till the good Captain declared, being quite overpowered and bewildered,      He had rather by far break into an Indian encampment,      Than come again to a wedding to which he had not been invited.      Meanwhile the bridegroom went forth and stood with the bride at the          doorway,      Breathing the perfumed air of that warm and beautiful morning.      Touched with autumnal tints, but lonely and sad in the sunshine,      Lay extended before them the land of toil and privation;      But to their eyes transfigured, it seemed as the Garden of Eden,      Filled with the presence of God, whose voice was the sound of the          ocean.      Soon was their vision disturbed by the noise and stir of departure,      Friends coming forth from the house, and impatient of longer delaying.      Then from a stall near at hand, amid exclamations of wonder,      Alden the thoughtful, the careful, so happy, so proud of Priscilla,      Brought out his snow-white bull, obeying the hand of its master,      Led by a cord that was tied to an iron ring in its nostrils,      Covered with crimson cloth, and a cushion placed for a saddle.      She should not walk, he said, through the dust and heat of the noonday;      Nay, she should ride like a queen, not plod along like a peasant.      Somewhat alarmed at first, but reassured by the others,      Placing her hand on the cushion, her foot in the hand of her husband,      Gayly, with joyous laugh, Priscilla mounted her palfrey.      Onward the bridal procession now moved to the new habitation,      Happy husband and wife, and friends conversing together.      Down through the golden leaves the sun was pouring his splendors,      Gleaming on purple grapes, that, from branches above them suspended,      Mingled their odorous breath with the balm of the pine and the          fir-tree,      Wild and sweet as the clusters that grew in the valley of [v]Eshcol.      Like a picture it seemed of the primitive, pastoral ages,      Fresh with the youth of the world, and recalling Rebecca and Isaac,      Old and yet ever new, and simple and beautiful always,      Love immortal and young in the endless succession of lovers,      So through the Plymouth woods passed onward the bridal procession.    HENRY W. LONGFELLOW.      =HELPS TO STUDY=    Miles Standish was one of the early settlers of Plymouth colony. He came  over soon after the landing of the _Mayflower_ and was made captain of  the colony because of his military experience. The feeble settlement was  in danger from the Indians, and Standish's services were of great  importance. He was one of the leaders of Plymouth for a number of years.  Longfellow shaped the legend of his courtship into one of the most  beautiful poems of American literature, vividly describing the hardships  and perils of the early life of New England.         I.

Longfellow.          THE FRIENDSHIP OF NANTAQUAS           This story is taken from Mary Johnston's novel, _To Have and to       Hold_, which describes the early settlement of Virginia. The most       important event of this period was the Indian massacre of 1622. For       some years the whites and Indians had lived in peace, and it was       believed that there would be no further trouble from the savages.       However, Opechancanough, the head chief of the Powhatan       confederacy, formed a plot against the white men and suddenly       attacked them with great fury. Hundreds of the English settlers       were slain. The author of the novel, taking the bare outline of the       massacre as given in the early histories, has woven around it the       graphic story of Captain Ralph Percy and his saving of the colony.       Percy, unlike Miles Standish, is not a historical character.      I.    A man who hath been a soldier and adventurer into far and strange  countries must needs have faced Death many times and in many guises. I  had learned to know that grim countenance, and to have no great fear of  it. The surprise of our sudden capture by the Indians had now worn away,  and I no longer struggled to loose my bonds, Indian-tied and not to be  loosened.    Another slow hour and I bethought me of Diccon, my servant and companion  in captivity, and spoke to him, asking him how he did. He answered from  the other side of the lodge that was our prison, but the words were  scarcely out of his mouth before our guard broke in upon us, commanding  silence.    It was now moonlight without the lodge and very quiet. The night was far  gone; already we could smell the morning, and it would come apace.  Knowing the swiftness of that approach and what the early light would  bring, I strove for a courage which should be the steadfastness of the  Christian and not the vainglorious pride of the heathen.    Suddenly, in the first gray dawn, as at a trumpet's call, the village  awoke. From the long communal houses poured forth men, women, and  children; fires sprang up, dispersing the mist, and a commotion arose  through the length and breadth of the place. The women made haste with  their cooking and bore maize cakes and broiled fish to the warriors, who  sat on the ground in front of the royal lodge. Diccon and I were loosed,  brought without, and allotted our share of the food. We ate sitting side  by side with our captors, and Diccon, with a great cut across his head,  even made merry.    In the usual order of things in an Indian village, the meal over,  tobacco should have followed. But now not a pipe was lit, and the women  made haste to take away the platters and to get all things in readiness  for what was to follow. The [v]werowance of the [v]Paspaheghs rose to  his feet, cast aside his mantle, and began to speak. He was a man in the  prime of life, of a great figure, strong as a [v]Susquehannock, and a  savage cruel and crafty beyond measure. Over his breast, stained with  strange figures, hung a chain of small bones, and the scalp locks of his  enemies fringed his moccasins. No player could be more skillful in  gesture and expression, no poet more nice in the choice of words, no  general more quick to raise a wild enthusiasm in the soldiers to whom he  called. All Indians are eloquent, but this savage was a leader among  them.    He spoke now to some effect. Commencing with a day in the moon of  blossoms when for the first time winged canoes brought white men into  the [v]Powhatan, he came down through year after year to the present  hour, ceased, and stood in silence, regarding his triumph. It was  complete. In its wild excitement the village was ready then and there to  make an end of us, who had sprung to our feet and stood with our"]]]
