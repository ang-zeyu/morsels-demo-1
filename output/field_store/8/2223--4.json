It was over this last question that the dispute raged hottest in the  Gorham Case. The High Church party, represented by Dr. Phillpotts,  asserted that the mere act of baptism conferred regeneration upon the  recipient and washed away his original sin. To this the Evangelicals,  headed by Mr. Gorham, replied that, according to the Articles,  regeneration would not follow unless baptism was RIGHTLY received. What,  then, was the meaning of 'rightly'? Clearly it implied not merely lawful  administration, but worthy reception; worthiness, therefore, is the  essence of the sacrament; and worthiness means faith and repentance.  Now, two propositions were accepted by both parties--that all infants  are born in original sin, and that original sin could be washed away by  baptism. But how could both these propositions be true, argued Mr.  Gorham, if it was also true that faith and repentance were necessary  before baptism could come into operation at all? How could an infant in  arms be said to be in a state of faith and repentance? How, therefore,  could its original sin be washed away by baptism? And yet, as every one  agreed, washed away it was.    The only solution of the difficulty lay in the doctrine of prevenient  grace; and Mr. Gorham maintained that unless God performed an act of  prevenient grace by which the infant was endowed with faith and  repentance, no act of baptism could be effectual; though to whom, and  under what conditions, prevenient grace was given, Mr. Gorham confessed  himself unable to decide. The light thrown by the Bible upon the whole  matter seemed somewhat dubious, for whereas the baptism of St. Peter's  disciples at Jerusalem and St. Philip's at Samaria was followed by the  gift of the Spirit, in the case of Cornelius the sacrament succeeded the  gift. St. Paul also was baptised; and as for the language of St. John  iii 5; Rom. vi 3, 4; I Peter iii 21, it admits of more than one  interpretation. There could, however, be no doubt that the Church of  England assented to Dr. Phillpotts' opinion; the question was whether or  not she excluded Mr. Gorham's. If it was decided that she did, it was  clear that henceforward, there would be very little peace for  Evangelicals within her fold.    But there was another issue, even more fundamental than that of  Baptismal Regeneration itself, involved in the Gorham trial. An Act  passed in 1833 had constituted the Judicial Committee of the Privy  Council the supreme court of appeal for such cases; and this Committee  was a body composed entirely of laymen. It was thus obvious that the  Royal Supremacy was still a fact, and that a collection of lawyers  appointed by the Crown had the legal right to formulate the religious  doctrine of the Church of England. In 1850 their judgment was delivered;  they reversed the decision of the Court of Arches, and upheld the  position of Mr. Gorham. Whether his views were theologically correct or  not, they said, was not their business; it was their business to decide  whether the opinions under consideration were contrary or repugnant to  the doctrine of the Church of England as enjoined upon the clergy by its  Articles, Formularies, and Rubrics; and they had come to the conclusion  that they were not. The judgement still holds good; and to this day, a  clergyman of the Church of England is quite at liberty to believe that  Regeneration does not invariably take place when an infant is baptised.    The blow fell upon no one with greater violence than upon Manning. Not  only was the supreme efficacy of the sign of the cross upon a baby's  forehead one of his favourite doctrines, but up to that moment he had  been convinced that the Royal Supremacy was a mere accident--a temporary  usurpation which left the spiritual dominion of the Church essentially  untouched. But now the horrid reality rose up before him, crowned and  triumphant; it was all too clear that an Act of Parliament, passed by  Jews, Roman Catholics, and Dissenters, was the ultimate authority which  decided upon the momentous niceties of the Anglican faith. Mr. Gladstone  also, was deeply perturbed. It was absolutely necessary, he wrote, to  'rescue and defend the conscience of the Church from the present hideous  system'. An agitation was set on foot, and several influential  Anglicans, with Manning at their head, drew up and signed a formal  protest against the Gorham judgment. Mr. Gladstone however, proposed  another method of procedure: precipitate action, he declared, must be  avoided at all costs, and he elaborated a scheme for securing  procrastination, by which a covenant was to bind all those who believed  that an article of the creed had been abolished by Act of Parliament to  take no steps in any direction, nor to announce their intention of doing  so, until a given space of time had elapsed. Mr. Gladstone was hopeful  that some good might come of this--though indeed he could not be sure.  'Among others,' he wrote to Manning, 'I have consulted Robert  Wilberforce and Wegg-Prosser, and they seemed inclined to favour my  proposal. It might, perhaps, have kept back Lord Feilding. But he is  like a cork.'    The proposal was certainly not favoured by Manning. Protests and  procrastinations, approving Wegg-Prossers and cork-like Lord  Feildings--all this was feeding the wind and folly; the time for action  had come.    'I can no longer continue,' he wrote to Robert Wilberforce, 'under oath  and subscription binding me to the Royal Supremacy in Ecclesiastical  causes, being convinced:      (1) That it is a violation of the Divine Office of the Church.      (2) That it has involved the Church of England in a separation    from the Universal Church, which separation I cannot clear of the    character of schism.      (3) That it has thereby suspended and prevented the functions of    the Church of England.'    It was in vain that Robert Wilberforce pleaded, in vain that Mr.  Gladstone urged upon his mind the significance of John iii 8. ['The wind  bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst  not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; so is everyone that is  born of the Spirit.']    'I admit,' Mr. Gladstone wrote, 'that the words might in some way be  satisfied by supposing our Lord simply to mean \"the facts of nature are  unintelligible, therefore, be not afraid if revealed truths be likewise  beyond the compass of the understanding\"; but this seems to me a meagre  meaning.'    Such considerations could hold him no longer, and Manning executed the  resignation of his office and benefice before a public notary. Soon  afterwards, in the little Chapel off Buckingham Palace Road, kneeling  beside Mr. Gladstone, he worshipped for the last time as an Anglican.  Thirty years later the Cardinal told how, just before the Communion  service commenced, he turned to his friends with the words:    'I can no longer take the Communion in the Church of England.' 'I rose  up, and laying my hand on Mr. Gladstone's shoulder, said \"Come\". It was  the parting of the ways. Mr. Gladstone remained; and I went my way. Mr.  Gladstone still remains where I left him.'    On April 6th, 1851, the final step was taken: Manning was received into  the Roman Catholic Church. Now at last, after the long struggle, his  mind was at rest.    'I know what you mean,' he wrote to Robert Wilberforce, 'by saying that  one sometimes feels as if all this might turn out to be only another  \"Land of Shadows\". I have felt it in time past, but not now. The  theologia from Nice to St. Thomas Aquinas, and the undivided unity  suffused throughout the world, of which the Cathedra Petri is the  centre, is now 1800 years old, and mightier in every power now than  ever--in intellect, in science, in separation from the world; and purer  too, refined by 300 years of conflict with the modern infidel  civilisation--all of this is a fact more solid than the earth.'      V.    WHEN Manning joined the Church of Rome, he acted under the combined  impulse of the two dominating forces in his nature. His preoccupation  with the supernatural might, alone, have been satisfied within the fold  of the Anglican communion; and so might his preoccupation with  himself--the one might have found vent in the elaborations of High  Church ritual, and the other in the activities of a bishopric. But the  two together could not be quieted so easily. The Church of England is a  commodious institution; she is very anxious to please, but somehow or  other, she has never managed to supply a happy home to superstitious  egotists. 'What an escape for my poor soul!' Manning is said to have  exclaimed when, shortly after his conversion, a mitre was going  a-begging. But, in truth, Manning's 'poor soul' had scented nobler  quarry. To one of his temperament, how was it possible, when once the  choice was plainly put, to hesitate for a moment between the respectable  dignity of an English bishop, harnessed by the secular power, with the  Gorham judgment as a bit between his teeth, and the illimitable  pretensions of the humblest priest of Rome?    For the moment, however, it seemed as if the Fates had at last been  successful in their little game of shunting Manning. The splendid career  which he had so laboriously built up from the small beginnings of his  Sussex curacy was shattered--and shattered by the inevitable operation  of his own essential needs. He was over forty, and he had been put back  once more to the very bottom rung of the ladder--a middle-aged neophyte  with, so far as could be seen, no special claim to the attention of his  new superiors. The example of Newman, a far more illustrious convert,  was hardly reassuring: he had been relegated to a complete obscurity, in  which he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2449"],[0,"The Common Law (#10)"],[1,"a man responsible for  consequences which [57] no one, or only some exceptional  specialist, could have foreseen, still the reason for this  limitation is simply to make a rule which is not too hard for the  average member of the community. As the purpose is to compel men  to abstain from dangerous conduct, and not merely to restrain  them from evil inclinations, the law requires them at their peril  to know the teachings of common experience, just as it requires  them to know the law. Subject to these explanations, it may be  said that the test of murder is the degree of danger to life  attending the act under the known circumstances of the case. /1/    It needs no further explanation to show that, when the particular  defendant does for any reason foresee what an ordinary man of  reasonable prudence would not have foreseen, the ground of  exemption no longer applies. A harmful act is only excused on the  ground that the party neither did foresee, nor could with proper  care have foreseen harm.    It would seem, at first sight, that the above analysis ought to  exhaust the whole subject of murder. But it does not without some  further explanation. If a man forcibly resists an officer  lawfully making an arrest, and kills him, knowing him to be an  officer, it may be murder, although no act is done which, but for  his official function, would be criminal at all. So, if a man  does an act with intent to commit a felony, and thereby  accidentally kills another; for instance, if he fires at  chickens, intending to steal them, and accidentally kills the  owner, whom he does not see. Such a case as this last seems  hardly to be reconcilable with the general principles which have  been laid down. It has been argued somewhat as [58] follows:--The  only blameworthy act is firing at the chickens, knowing them to  belong to another. It is neither more nor less so because an  accident happens afterwards; and hitting a man, whose presence  could not have been suspected, is an accident. The fact that the  shooting is felonious does not make it any more likely to kill  people. If the object of the rule is to prevent such accidents,  it should make accidental killing with firearms murder, not  accidental killing in the effort to steal; while, if its object  is to prevent stealing, it would do better to hang one thief in  every thousand by lot.    Still, the law is intelligible as it stands. The general test of  murder is the degree of danger attending the acts under the known  state of facts. If certain acts are regarded as peculiarly  dangerous under certain circumstances, a legislator may make them  punishable if done under these circumstances, although the danger  was not generally known. The law often takes this step, although  it does not nowadays often inflict death in such cases. It  sometimes goes even further, and requires a man to find out  present facts, as well as to foresee future harm, at his peril,  although they are not such as would necessarily be inferred from  the facts known.    Thus it is a statutory offence in England to abduct a girl under  sixteen from the possession of the person having lawful charge of  her. If a man does acts which induce a girl under sixteen to  leave her parents, he is not chargeable, if he had no reason to  know that she was under the lawful charge of her parents, /1/ and  it may be presumed that he would not be, if he had reasonable  cause to believe that she was a boy. But if he knowingly abducts  a girl from [59] her parents, he must find out her age at his  peril. It is no defence that he had every reason to think her  over sixteen. /1/ So, under a prohibitory liquor law, it has been  held that, if a man sells \"Plantation Bitters,\" it is no defence  that he does not know them to be intoxicating. /2/ And there are  other examples of the same kind.    Now, if experience shows, or is deemed by the law-maker to show,  that somehow or other deaths which the evidence makes accidental  happen disproportionately often in connection with other  felonies, or with resistance to officers, or if on any other  ground of policy it is deemed desirable to make special efforts  for the prevention of such deaths, the lawmaker may consistently  treat acts which, under the known circumstances, are felonious,  or constitute resistance to officers, as having a sufficiently  dangerous tendency to be put under a special ban. The law may,  therefore, throw on the actor the peril, not only of the  consequences foreseen by him, but also of consequences which,  although not predicted by common experience, the legislator  apprehends. I do not, however, mean to argue that the rules under  discussion arose on the above reasoning, any more than that they  are right, or would be generally applied in this country.    Returning to the main line of thought it will be instructive to  consider the relation of manslaughter to murder. One great  difference between the two will be found to lie in the degree of  danger attaching to the act in the given state of facts. If a man  strikes another with a small stick which is not likely to kill,  and which he has no reason to suppose will do more than slight  bodily harm, but which [60] does kill the other, he commits  manslaughter, not murder. /1/ But if the blow is struck as hard  as possible with an iron bar an inch thick, it is murder. /2/ So  if, at the time of striking with a switch, the party knows an  additional fact, by reason of which he foresees that death will  be the consequence of a slight blow, as, for instance, that the  other has heart disease, the offence is equally murder. /3/ To  explode a barrel of gunpowder in a crowded street, and kill  people, is murder, although the actor hopes that no such harm  will be done. /4/ But to kill a man by careless riding in the  same street would commonly be manslaughter. /5/ Perhaps, however,  a case could be put where the riding was so manifestly dangerous  that it would be murder.    To recur to an example which has been used already for another  purpose: \"When a workman flings down a stone or piece of timber  into the street, and kills a man; this may be either  misadventure, manslaughter, or murder, according to the  circumstances under which the original act was done: if it were  in a country village, where few passengers are, and he calls out  to all people to have a care, it is misadventure only; but if it  were in London, or other populous town, where people are  continually passing, it is manslaughter, though he gives loud  warning; and murder, if he knows of their passing, and gives no  warning at all.\" /6/    The law of manslaughter contains another doctrine [61] which  should be referred to in order to complete the understanding of  the general principles of the criminal law. This doctrine is,  that provocation may reduce an offence which would otherwise have  been murder to manslaughter. According to current morality, a man  is not so much to blame for an act done under the disturbance of  great excitement, caused by a wrong done to himself, as when he  is calm. The law is made to govern men through their motives, and  it must, therefore, take their mental constitution into account.    It might be urged, on the other side, that, if the object of  punishment is prevention, the heaviest punishment should be  threatened where the strongest motive is needed to restrain; and  primitive legislation seems sometimes to have gone on that  principle. But if any threat will restrain a man in a passion, a  threat of less than death will be sufficient, and therefore the  extreme penalty has been thought excessive.    At the same time the objective nature of legal standards is shown  even here. The mitigation does not come from the fact that the  defendant was beside himself with rage. It is not enough that he  had grounds which would have had the same effect on every man of  his standing and education. The most insulting words are not  provocation, although to this day, and still more when the law  was established, many people would rather die than suffer them  without action. There must be provocation sufficient to justify  the passion, and the law decides on general considerations what  provocations are sufficient.    It is said that even what the law admits to be \"provocation does  not extenuate the guilt of homicide, unless the person provoked  is at the time when he does the deed [62] deprived of the power  of self-control by the provocation which he has received.\" /1/  There are obvious reasons for taking the actual state of the  defendant's consciousness into account to this extent. The only  ground for not applying the general rule is, that the defendant  was in such a state that he could not be expected to remember or  be influenced by the fear of punishment; if he could be, the  ground of exception disappears. Yet even here, rightly or  wrongly, the law has gone far in the direction of adopting  external tests. The courts seem to have decided between murder  and manslaughter on such grounds as the nature of the weapon  used, /2/ or the length of time between the provocation and the  act. /3/ But in other cases the question whether the prisoner was  deprived of self-control by passion has been left to the jury.  /4/    As the object of this Lecture is not to give an outline of the  criminal law, but to explain its general theory, I shall only  consider such offences as throw some special light upon the  subject, and shall treat of those in such order as seems best  fitted for that purpose. It will now be useful to take up  malicious mischief, and to compare the malice required to  constitute that offence with the malice aforethought of murder.    The charge of malice aforethought in an indictment for murder has  been shown not to mean a state of the defendant's mind, as is  often thought, except in the sense that he knew circumstances  which did in fact make his conduct dangerous. It is, in truth, an  "]]]
