Agri.)]    In the garden examine and see if you can find lady-beetles or other  parasites attacking the lice. Collect some of the enemies of the lice  for your collection. Make a gallon of tobacco tea by soaking one pound  of tobacco stems or waste tobacco in one gallon of water for a day or  use one ounce of forty per cent nicotine sulphate in three gallons of  soap suds and spray or sprinkle infested bushes or vegetables with it.  In an hour examine and see what effect it has had on the plant-lice.  Nicotine is the most effective chemical for killing plant-lice. Do any  of the lice develop wings? If so, how many? Wings develop on some of the  lice at times when a plant or crop becomes too heavily infested by them.  This enables some of the lice to spread to new food plants before old  plants are completely destroyed and the colony of lice starved.    [Illustration: Wooly apple aphis, showing how they cluster in masses on  limbs and secrete the white, wooly protection over their bodies.]    Make a careful enlarged drawing of a winged plant-louse and a wingless  one showing legs, feelers, beak, honey dew tubes on back and body  segmentation. If ants are seen to attend the lice observe them carefully  and describe their work. The ants feed on a sweet honey dew excretion  discharged by the lice.          CHAPTER XVI    THE HONEY BEE        \"_Simple and sweet is their food; they eat no flesh of the living._\"                                            --VON KUEBEL.      One can hardly believe that this small, ever busy creature each year  gathers many million dollars worth of products for man in this country  alone to say nothing of its inestimable value on the farm and especially  in the orchard, where it assists in carrying pollen from blossom to  blossom. It is of far greater value to man as a carrier of pollen than  it is as a honey gatherer and yet under especially favorable conditions  in one year a strong colony may produce between twenty-five and thirty  dollars worth of honey.    [Illustration: Worker, queen and drone honey bees; all about natural  size. (After Phillips, U. S. Dept. of Agri.)]    The general habits of the bee are fairly well known by all. They live in  colonies consisting largely of workers, one female or queen and males or  drones. Whenever the number of workers becomes sufficiently large to  warrant a division of the colony, a young queen is reared by the workers  and just before she matures, the old queen leaves with about half of the  workers to establish a new colony. This division of the colony is called  swarming. If a hive, box or other acceptable home is not provided soon  after the swarm comes out and clusters, it may fly to the woods and  establishes itself in a hollow tree where the regular work of honey  gathering is continued. This accounts for so many bee-trees in the  woods. The bee has been handled by man for ages, but it readily becomes  wild when allowed to escape to the woods.    [Illustration: Stages of development of honey bee; a, egg; b, young  grub; c, full-fed grub; d, pupa; all enlarged. (After Phillips, U. S.  Dept. Agri.)]    The bee colony offers one of the best examples to show what can be  accomplished by united effort where harmony prevails. Certain of the  workers gather honey, others are nurses for the queen and young brood in  the hive, others guard the hive and repel intruders, and others care for  the hive by mending breaks and providing new comb as it is needed. Each  knows its work and goes about it without interfering with the work of  others. It is one huge assemblage of individuals under one roof where  harmony and industry prevail.    Throughout the long, hot summer days the workers are busy from daylight  until dark gathering nectar, while at night they force currents of air  thru the hive to evaporate the excess water from the nectar. When  flowers are not available near the hive they simply fly until they find  them, be it one, two or more miles. As long as they are able to gather  honey they continue to do so and when they give out they drop in the  field and are forgotten, others rushing to take their place. Often when  winter is approaching and the store of honey is low the less vigorous  ones are cast out from the hive and left to die. If man could learn a  few of the lessons which the bee teaches, he would be a better, a more  useful and a wiser addition to society.      OBSERVATIONS AND STUDIES    [Illustration: Two colonies of bees poorly cared for. Note box hives,  crowding, lack of shade, and high weeds. It is a crime to treat bees  this way.]    Go into the fields and study the work of the bee. Follow it from flower  to flower. See if it visits different kinds of flowers or if it gathers  its whole load of honey from one kind. Make a list of all the blossoms  you find bees visiting. Does the bee move slowly from flower to flower?  Can you see it thrust its tongue into the flower? How long does it stay  on one blossom? Does it visit red clover? Pull a red clover blossom  apart and compare the depth of the blossom with the length of the honey  bee's tongue, and determine the reason why it does not visit red  clover. The bumble-bee has a much longer tongue so it can get the nectar  from red clover blossoms. Without the bumble-bee clover seed could not  be successfully grown. Can you see small balls of yellow pollen on the  hind legs of the bee? The pollen is collected from blossoms and is  pasted on to the outside of the hind legs in the pollen basket. When the  bee returns to the hive, it stores the small balls of pollen in the  cells of the comb for use later in the preparation of bee-bread. When  the bee is disturbed in the field does it fly away or will it sting?  When it stings does it always lose its sting? What makes the sting of  the bee poisonous? Examine the wings of bees in the field and note how  they are torn from continued work of gathering honey. The older ones  often lose so much of their wings, that they can no longer carry loads  of honey. Where is the honey carried and how is it placed in the honey  cells in the hive?    [Illustration: A strong colony of bees properly housed and shaded. This  colony in a very unfavorable season stored about 50 pounds of surplus  honey.]    Go now to a hive and study the bees as they go and come. Do those  returning fly as fast as those which leave? Why not? When they return do  they come direct to the mouth of the hive? Do those which leave fly  direct from the hive or circle about first? Can you detect guards which  move about at the entrance of the hive? What happens when a fly or other  insect alights near the opening? Will the bees sting when you disturb  them about the hive? If possible study the colony inside the hive. To do  this you will need smoke to subdue the guards and a veil to protect the  face. Can you find the queen? Is she larger than the workers? Examine  for honey-comb, bee-bread, worker brood, queen cells and drone cells. If  possible study the actions of a colony while swarming.    Write a brief report of what you can learn of the life, work and habits  of the honey bee.           *       *       *       *       *        \"_Happy insect, what can be        In happiness compared to thee?      Fed with nourishment divine,        The dewy morning's gentle wine!_        \"_Nature waits upon thee still,        And thy verdant cup does fill;      'Tis filled wherever thou doest tread        Nature's self thy Ganymede._        \"_Thou doest drink and dance and sing,        Happier than the happiest king!

CHAPTER XVII    THE ANT      The ants are closely related to the bees and are similar to them in many  respects. They live in colonies consisting of workers, drones, and a  queen. The males or drones appear at swarming time and the workers are  divided into various castes--warriors, guards, nurses, etc. Those  families of ants, however, which seem to have what approaches real  intelligence, far outstrip the bees in many respects. In some cases ants  seem to be able to plan and carry out lines of work very much the same  as man does. The various stages of human intelligence or races of men  from the savage to the intelligent man are in a way similar to the  various races of ants. There are ants which live as hunters, others  which live as shepherds and still others more highly developed which  grow crops either in or near the nest as is the case with the fungus  growing ants. This striking similarity between the development of ants  and man offers ground for much speculation.    [Illustration: Ant hill showing activity and stages of development; a,  egg; b, young grub; c, pupa; d, worker; e, queen with wings; f, worker  carrying young grub; all enlarged. The ant hill and workers at work much  reduced.]    Some ants may be of considerable value to man while others are the  source of great annoyance and injury. The tidy housewife usually places  the ant in the same category with cockroaches and bed-bugs and the corn  growers attribute much of the injury to young corn to the work of the  small cornfield ant which acts as a shepherd of the corn root-louse.  Ants are usually more destructive by protecting and caring for other  pests than by attacking the crop direct.    Every country child is familiar with ants. They are met every day during  the summer, scampering across paths, tugging at some unfortunate insect,  or sticking to one's tongue when he eats berries. Ants are as numerous  as the stars in the skies and vary in size. They are found from the  tropics to the frozen north, in deserts, swamps and in fact,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23475"],[0,"The Works of Lord Byron.

I shall be nearer thrones than you to heaven;      And if not quite so haughty, yet more lofty.

And now you know me.        _Bel._               Have you finished?        _Arb._                                 Yes--      With you.        _Bel._    And would, perhaps, betray as well      As quit me?        _Arb._       That's a sacerdotal thought,      And not a soldier's.        _Bel._               Be it what you will--      Truce with these wranglings, and but hear me.        _Arb._                                        No--      There is more peril in your subtle spirit      Than in a phalanx.        _Bel._            If it must be so--      I'll on alone.        _Arb._         Alone!        _Bel._               Thrones hold but one.                         390        _Arb._ But this is filled.        _Bel._                      With worse than vacancy--      A despised monarch. Look to it, Arbaces:      I have still aided, cherished, loved, and urged you;      Was willing even to serve you, in the hope      To serve and save Assyria.

Aye[o]!      Well, Sir--we will accompany you hence.        _Pan._ I will retire to marshal forth the guard      Of honour which befits your rank, and wait      Your leisure, so that it the hour exceeds not.                                                              [_Exit_ PANIA.        _Bel._ Now then obey!        _Arb._                Doubtless.        _Bel._                           Yes, to the gates      That grate the palace, which is now our prison--      No further.        _Arb._   Thou hast harped the truth indeed!                        420      The realm itself, in all its wide extension,      Yawns dungeons at each step for thee and me.        _Bel._ Graves!        _Arb._         If I thought so, this good sword should dig      One more than mine.        _Bel._              It shall have work enough.      Let me hope better than thou augurest;      At present, let us hence as best we may.      Thou dost agree with me in understanding      This order as a sentence?        _Arb._                    Why, what other      Interpretation should it bear? it is      The very policy of Orient monarchs--                               430      Pardon and poison--favours and a sword--      A distant voyage, and an eternal sleep.      How many Satraps in his father's time--      For he I own is, or at least _was_, bloodless--        _Bel._ But _will_ not--_can_ not be so now.        _Arb._                                     I doubt it.      How many Satraps have I seen set out      In his Sire's day for mighty Vice-royalties,      Whose tombs are on their path! I know not how,      But they all sickened by the way, it was      So long and heavy.        _Bel._             Let us but regain                               440      The free air of the city, and we'll shorten      The journey.        _Arb._      'Twill be shortened at the gates,      It may be.        _Bel._    No; they hardly will risk that.      They mean us to die privately, but not      Within the palace or the city walls,      Where we are known, and may have partisans:      If they had meant to slay us here, we were      No longer with the living. Let us hence.        _Arb._ If I but thought he did not mean my life--        _Bel._ Fool! hence--what else should despotism alarmed             450      Mean? Let us but rejoin our troops, and march.        _Arb._ Towards our provinces?        _Bel._                        No; towards your kingdom.      There's time--there's heart, and hope, and power, and means--      Which their half measures leave us in full scope.--      Away!        _Arb._ And I even yet repenting must      Relapse to guilt!        _Bel._            Self-defence is a virtue,      Sole bulwark of all right. Away, I say!      Let's leave this place, the air grows thick and choking,      And the walls have a scent of night-shade--hence!      Let us not leave them time for further council.                    460      Our quick departure proves our civic zeal;      Our quick departure hinders our good escort,      The worthy Pania, from anticipating      The orders of some parasangs from hence:      Nay, there's no other choice, but----hence, I say[p].

Am I permitted to depart?        _Sar._ Yes----Stay a moment, my good Salemenes,      My brother--my best subject--better Prince      Than I am King. You should have been the monarch,      And I--I know not what, and care not; but      Think not I am insensible to all                                   490      Thine honest wisdom, and thy rough yet kind,      Though oft-reproving sufferance of my follies.      If I have spared these men against thy counsel,      That is, their lives--it is not that I doubt      The advice was sound; but, let them live: we will not      Cavil about their lives--so let them mend them.      Their banishment will leave me still sound sleep,      Which their death had not left me.        _Sal._                             Thus you run      The risk to sleep for ever, to save traitors--      A moment's pang now changed for years of crime.                    500      Still let them be made quiet.        _Sar._                        Tempt me not;      My word is past.        _Sal._           But it may be recalled.        _Sar._ 'Tis royal.        _Sal._              And should therefore be decisive.      This half-indulgence of an exile serves      But to provoke--a pardon should be full,      Or it is none.        _Sar._         And who persuaded me      After I had repealed them, or at least      Only dismissed them from our presence, who      Urged me to send them to their satrapies?        _Sal._ True; that I had forgotten; that is, Sire,                  510      If they e'er reached their Satrapies--why, then,      Reprove me more for my advice.        _Sar._                        And if      They"]]]
