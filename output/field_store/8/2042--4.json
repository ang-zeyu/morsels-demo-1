The interior of the plant is very soft and gelatinous, while the outer  part forms a sort of tough rind of much firmer consistence. The ends  of some of the branches (Fig. 26, _A_, _x_) are usually much swollen,  and the surface covered with little elevations from which may often be  seen protruding clusters of hairs like those arising from the other  parts of the plant. A section through one of these enlarged ends shows  that each elevation corresponds to a cavity situated below it. On some  of the plants these cavities are filled with an orange-yellow mass; in  others there are a number of roundish olive-brown bodies large enough  to be easily seen. The yellow masses are masses of antheridia; the  round bodies, the ooegonia.    If the plants are gathered while wet, and packed so as to prevent  evaporation of the water, they will keep perfectly for several days,  and may readily be shipped for long distances. If they are to be  studied away from the seashore, sections for microscopic examination  should be mounted in salt water (about 3 parts in weight of common  salt to 100 of water). If fresh material is not to be had, dried  specimens or alcoholic material will answer pretty well.      To study the minute structure of the plant, make a thin    cross-section, and mount in salt water. The inner part or pith is    composed of loosely arranged, elongated cells, placed end to end,    and forming an irregular network, the large spaces between filled    with the mucilaginous substance derived from the altered outer walls    of these cells. This mucilage is hard when dry, but swells up    enormously in water, especially fresh water. The cells grow smaller    and more compact toward the outside of the section, until there are    no spaces of any size between those of the outside or rind. The    cells contain small chloroplasts like those of the higher plants,    but owing to the presence of the brown pigment found in all of the    class, in addition to the chlorophyll, they appear golden brown    instead of green.      No non-sexual reproductive bodies are known in the rock weeds,    beyond small branches that occur in clusters on the margins of the    main branches, and probably become detached, forming new plants. In    some of the lower forms, however, _e.g._ _Ectocarpus_ and    _Laminaria_ (Fig. 28, _A_, _C_), zooespores are formed.      The sexual organs of the rock weed, as we have already seen, are    borne in special cavities (conceptacles) in the enlarged ends of    some of the branches. In the species here figured, _F. vesiculosus_,    the antheridia and ooegonia are borne on separate plants; but in    others, _e.g._ _F. platycarpus_, they are both in the same    conceptacle.      The walls of the conceptacle (Fig. 26, _B_) are composed of closely    interwoven filaments, from which grow inward numerous hairs, filling    up the space within, and often extending out through the opening at    the top.      The reproductive bodies arise from the base of these hairs. The    ooegonia (Fig. 26, _C_, _E_) arise as nearly colorless cells, that    early become divided into two cells, a short basal cell or stalk and    a larger terminal one, the ooegonium proper. The latter enlarges    rapidly, and its contents divide into eight parts. The division is    at first indicated by a division of the central portion, which    includes the nucleus, and is colored brown, into two, four, and    finally eight parts, after which walls are formed between these. The    brown color spreads until the whole ooegonium is of a nearly uniform    olive-brown tint.      When ripe, the upper part of the ooegonium dissolves, allowing the    eight cells, still enclosed in a delicate membrane, to escape    (Fig. 27, _H_). Finally, the walls separating the inner cells of the    ooegonium become also absorbed, as well as the surrounding membrane,    and the eight egg cells escape into the water (Fig. 27, _I_) as    naked balls of protoplasm, in which a central nucleus may be dimly    seen.      The antheridia (Fig. 26, _F_, _G_) are small oblong cells, at first    colorless, but when ripe containing numerous glistening, reddish    brown dots, each of which is part of a spermatozoid. When ripe, the    contents of the antheridium are forced out into the water (_G_),    leaving the empty outer wall behind, but still surrounded by a thin    membrane. After a few minutes this membrane is dissolved, and the    spermatozoids are set free. These (Fig. 27, _K_) are oval in form,    with two long cilia attached to the side where the brown speck, seen    while still within the antheridium, is conspicuous.      The act of fertilization may be easily observed by laying fresh    antheridia into a drop of water containing recently discharged egg    cells. To obtain these, all that is necessary is to allow freshly    gathered plants to remain in the air until they are somewhat dry,    when the ripe sexual cells will be discharged from the openings of    the conceptacles, exuding as little drops, those with antheridia    being orange-yellow; the masses of ooegonia, olive. Within a few    minutes after putting the ooegonia into water, the egg cells may be    seen to escape into the water, when some of the antheridia may be    added. The spermatozoids will be quickly discharged, and collect    immediately in great numbers about the egg cells, to which they    apply themselves closely, often setting them in rotation by the    movements of their cilia, and presenting a most extraordinary    spectacle (_J_). Owing to the small size of the spermatozoids, and    the opacity of the eggs, it is impossible to see whether more than    one spermatozoid penetrates it; but from what is known in other    cases it is not likely. The egg now secretes a wall about itself,    and within a short time begins to grow. It becomes pear-shaped, the    narrow portion becoming attached to the parent plant or to some    other object by means of rootlets, and the upper part grows into the    body of the young plant (Fig. 27, _M_).    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--_H_, the eight egg cells still surrounded by  the inner membrane of the ooegonium. _I_, the egg cells escaping into  the water. _J_, a single egg cell surrounded by spermatozoids. _K_,  mass of spermatozoids surrounded by the inner membrane of the  antheridium. _L_, spermatozoids. _M_, young plant. _r_, the roots.  _K_, x 300; _L_, x 600; the others, x 150.]    The simpler brown seaweeds, so far as known, multiply only by means of  zooespores, which may grow directly into new plants, or, as has been  observed in some species, two zooespores will first unite. A few, like  _Ectocarpus_ (Fig. 28, _A_), are simple, branched filaments, but most  are large plants with complex tissues. Of the latter, a familiar  example is the common kelp, \"devil's apron\" (_Laminaria_), often three  to four metres in length, with a stout stalk, provided with root-like  organs, by which it is firmly fastened. Above, it expands into a  broad, leaf-like frond, which in some species is divided into strips.  Related to the kelps is the giant kelp of the Pacific (_Macrocystis_),  which is said sometimes to reach a length of three hundred metres.    [Illustration: FIG. 28.--Forms of brown seaweeds. _A_, _Ectocarpus_,  x 50.

These plants possess distinct stems and  leaves, and there are stalked air bladders, looking like berries,  giving the plant a striking resemblance to the higher land plants.          CHAPTER VII.    CLASS III.--THE RED ALGAE (_Rhodophyceae_).      These are among the most beautiful and interesting members of the  plant kingdom, both on account of their beautiful colors and the  exquisitely graceful forms exhibited by many of them. Unfortunately  for inland students they are, with few exceptions, confined to salt  water, and consequently fresh material is not available. Nevertheless,  enough can be done with dried material to get a good idea of their  general appearance, and the fruiting plants can be readily preserved  in strong alcohol. Specimens, simply dried, may be kept for an  indefinite period, and on being placed in water will assume perfectly  the appearance of the living plants. Prolonged exposure, however, to  the action of fresh water extracts the red pigment that gives them  their characteristic color. This pigment is found in the chlorophyll  bodies, and usually quite conceals the chlorophyll, which, however,  becomes evident so soon as the red pigment is removed.    The red seaweeds differ much in the complexity of the plant body, but  all agree in the presence of the red pigment, and, at least in the  main, in their reproduction. The simpler ones consist of rows of  cells, usually branching like _Cladophora_; others form cell plates  comparable to _Ulva_ (Fig. 30, _C_, _D_); while others, among which is  the well-known Irish moss (_Chondrus_), form plants of considerable  size, with pretty well differentiated tissues. In such forms the outer  cells are smaller and firmer, constituting a sort of rind; while the  inner portions are made up of larger and looser cells, and may be  called the pith. Between these extremes are all intermediate forms.    They usually grow attached to rocks, shells, wood, or other plants,  such as the kelps and even the larger red seaweeds. They are most  abundant in the warmer seas, but still a considerable number may be  found in all parts of the ocean, even extending into the Arctic  regions.

I have to acquaint you that Her Majesty's Government entirely  approve of your having rested your communication to the Turkish  Minister on the terms of my instruction, and of your having steadily  referred his Excellency to that document, while replying in a  considerate and conciliatory manner to the remarks which he  addressed to you.    Nothing, indeed, can be further from the wish of Her Majesty's  Government than that a communication which they have been compelled  by a strong sense of duty, and, I may add, by a sincere regard for  the welfare of Turkey, to make to the Porte, should be rendered more  unpalatable than from its nature it was likely to be, by being  conveyed in harsh or dictatorial terms; and they wish, if the  question is still under discussion when this despatch reaches your  Excellency's hands, that you should constantly bear in mind, that  Her Majesty's Government, although they propose to abide by the  general tenour of the communication which you have been directed to  make to the Porte, have no desire, and would deeply regret, that the  acquiescence of the Porte in the demand which they have addressed to  it, should be attended with unnecessary pain to the feelings of the  Turkish Government.    Her Majesty's Government are persuaded that if the Ministers of the  Porte will dispassionately consider what has been desired of them,  they will find that, without any real sacrifice of national or  religious opinion, they may place themselves in harmony with the  wishes and the feelings of the Christian Powers. Her Majesty's  Government have not urged, and do not propose to urge, them to  abrogate any law, divine or human, but merely to revert to the  system which Her Majesty's Government believe to have been for some  time past constantly acted upon, and to allow the law to remain  practically dormant, and thus silently withdraw from a practice  which cannot be enforced without rousing the feelings of  Christendom, and rendering it impossible for the Turkish Government  to retain the good-will of Christian Powers.    The Ministers of the Porte cannot, on calm reflection, suppose that  if they deliberately deprive their Government of the moral or  physical support of Christendom, the Turkish Empire can long be  preserved from the destruction with which, from numerous causes, it  is continually menaced; neither can they believe that, although the  sentiments of the various Powers of Europe on the question to which  the revival of an obsolete practice has now unfortunately given  rise, may be conveyed to the Porte in terms more or less decided,  there is any real and essential difference between the expectations  and the intentions of all. All must yield to public opinion  universally expressed; and the Porte may rest assured that Christian  States will, with one accord, refuse to tolerate any longer a  practice which, both in the principle on which it rests and the  manner in which it is carried into execution, is designed to  stigmatize the faith which they profess and cherish.    I am, &c.,    (Signed) ABERDEEN.              No. 27.      _Count Nesselrode to M. de Titow_.--(_Communicated by Baron Brunnow  to the Earl of Aberdeen_, March 19.)                            _St. Pétersbourg, le_ 15/27 _Février_, 1844.    Je n'ai pas manqué de prendre les ordres de l'Empereur sur le  contenu de votre rapport No. 10, du 21 Janvier/2 Février, par lequel  vous nous avez rendu compte de la fâcheuse impression que la  nouvelle exécution religieuse qui a eu lieu à Biligik a produite à  Constantinople.    Sa Majesté a voué une attention sérieuse aux diverses considérations  que vous nous avez exposées pour décider du plus ou moins  d'opportunité qu'il y aurait pour les Puissances de l'Europe en  général, et pour la Russie en particulier, à protester contre des  actes de cruauté incompatibles avec les principes d'humanité dont la  Porte devrait se montrer pénétrée à l'égard de ses sujets Chrétiens.  D'une part, nous avons reconnu la difficutté, pour ne pas dire  l'impossibilité, de découvrir le moyen propre pour paralyser d'une  manière définitive les effets de la loi du Coran qui concerne les  apostasies; d'autre part, nous ne saurions ne pas élever la voix,  lorsqu'il s'agit de l'application de la peine de mort à des  individus qui, en embrassant le Christianisme, ou en retournant dans  le sein de l'Eglise, invoquent notre protection, et nous imposent le  devoir de les soustraire aux rigueurs d'une législation barbare.    Dans un tel état de choses, l'opinion que vous a communiquée M. le  Comte de Stürmer, nous a paru celle qui offre le plus de chances de  succès. Cette opinion est d'ailleurs conforme aux vues que j'ai été  dans le cas de vous développer sur la même matière dans une occasion  précédente. Il est donc de l'intention de l'Empereur que vous  déclariez à la Porte Ottomane, sous la forme d'un conseil  bienveillant, que nous nous attendons positivement à ne plus voir se  renouveler des exécutions qui soulèvent contre elle l'indignation de  toute la Chrétienté. C'est dans son propre intérêt que nous lui  adressons cette demande. La Porte ne doit pas se faire illusion sur  les élémens qui fermentent en Turquie. Au lieu de s'aliéner les  sentimens des populations Chrétiennes, le Gouvernement Ottoman doit  travailler plus que jamais, à se les concilier. Qu'il comprenne  enfin la nécessité de laisser tomber en désuétude des dispositions  surannées de la loi Mahométane, qui ne peuvent être maintenues qu'au  mépris des représentations unanimes de toutes les Puissances. Tel  serait à peu près le langage que vous auriez à tenir, Monsieur, à la  Porte Ottomane, de concert avec les autres Représentans, et nous  espérons qu'en la rappelant ainsi à la conscience de ses devoirs et  de ses intérêts réels, nous l'empêcherons de retomber dans la voie  vicieuse qu'elle a suivie en dernier lieu.    Recevez, &c.,    (Signé) NESSELRODE.    (Translation.)                            _St. Petersburgh_, 15/27 _February_, 1844.    I have not failed to take the orders of the Emperor upon the  contents of your despatch No. 10, of the 21 January/2 February, in  which you have reported the painful impression which the fresh  religious execution which has taken place at Biligik has produced at  Constantinople.    His Majesty has given his serious attention to the various  considerations which you have laid before us in order to determine  the greater or less degree of propriety there would be in the  principal Powers of Europe generally, and in Russia particularly,  protesting against acts of cruelty incompatible with the principles  of humanity with which the Porte should show itself animated as  regards its Christian subjects. On the one hand, we have perceived  the difficulty, not to say the impossibility, of discovering the  suitable means of definitively paralyzing the effects of the law of  the Koran relating to apostacy; on the other hand, we cannot but  raise our voice when it is a question of inflicting the penalty of  death upon individuals who, in embracing Christianity, or in  returning into the bosom of the Church, appeal to our protection,  and impose upon us the duty of withdrawing them from the rigours of  a barbarous legislation.    In such a state of things the opinion which M. de Stürmer has  communicated to you, has appeared to us to be that which offers the  greatest chance of success. This opinion is, moreover, in conformity  with the views which I have had occasion to explain to you on the  same subject on a former occasion. It is then the Emperor's  intention that you should declare to the Ottoman Porte, in the form  of friendly counsel, that we positively expect no longer to witness  executions which array against it the indignation of all  Christendom. It is with a view to its own interest that we address  to it this demand. The Porte must not delude itself with regard to  the elements now in a state of fermentation in Turkey. Instead of  alienating from itself the feelings of the Christian population, the  Ottoman Government ought more than ever to labour to conciliate them  to itself. Let it comprehend, in fine, the necessity of allowing to  become obsolete antiquated enactments of the Mahomedan law, which  cannot be upheld but in disregard of the unanimous representations  of all the Powers. Such should be the purport of the language which,  Sir, you should hold to the Ottoman Porte, in concert with the other  Representatives; and we trust that in thus recalling it to a sense  of its duties and real interests, we shall prevent it from again  falling into the vicious system which it has recently followed.    Receive, &c.,    (Signed) NESSELRODE.              No. 28.      _Lord Cowley to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received March_ 21.)    (Extract.)                        _Paris, March_ 18, 1844.    With reference to the representations made to the Ottoman Government  by the French and English Representatives at Constantinople on the  subject of the execution of a Greek near Brussa, as reported in Sir  Stratford Canning's despatches of the 10th and 12th February, I have  the honour to state that M. Guizot has communicated to me the  substance of what passed at a conference which he has had within  these few days with Reshid Pasha upon that subject.    The Pasha said that he was instructed to express in strong terms the  concern of the Sultan at this interference of the Allied Sovereigns  (of Great Britain and France in particular) in the internal concerns  of his empire; that a compliance with these demands might be  attended with very serious consequences to himself and his  Government; and that he (the Pasha) was instructed to express the  fervent hope of his Master, that they would not be persisted in.
