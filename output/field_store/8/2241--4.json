The next minute there was a scuffling noise heard behind the place,  accompanied by angry protesting voices, speaking loudly in the Kaffir  tongue.    Then all at once Jack appeared, carrying three assegais, and holding  himself up with a great deal of savage dignity; but as he approached he  was struck on the back of the head by a bone.  He turned back angrily,  but ducked down to avoid a dry cake of fuel, and ended by running to  avoid further missiles, with his dignity all gone, for Tanta Sal's  grinning face peeped round the corner, and she shouted: \"Jack bad sick,  baas.  All eat--seep.\"    \"Yes; that's what's the matter, Jack,\" said Emson, shaking his head at  him.  \"Now take hold of the horse's mane, and I'll give you a good  digestive run.\"    There was no help for it.  Jack seized the mane and trotted off beside  the horse, while a derisive shout came from behind the house, and  Tanta's grinning face re-appeared.    This was too much for Jack, who turned to shake his assegais at her: the  movement was unpropitious, for he stumbled and fell, but gathered  himself up, caught up to the horse, and trotted on again, keeping on in  the most untiring way, till a flight of carrion birds was sighted,  hovering about the granite boulders, and perching here and there, as if  ready for the banquet to come.    Duke charged forward at this, and the birds scattered, but did not go  far; while the dog's approach started half-a-dozen jackals from among  the bushes to which they had retired, and they now began scurrying over  the plain.  \"I wonder how they find out that there's anything dead,  Joe,\" said Dyke; \"we did not see a single jackal or bird this morning.\"    \"Eyesight,\" said Emson quietly.  \"The vultures are sailing about on  high, and one sees the dead animal; then other vultures see him making  for it, and follow.\"    \"And the jackals see the vultures, and follow too?\"    \"That seems to be the way, old fellow.  Anyhow, they always manage to  find out where there's anything to eat.\"    \"I say, don't he look big?\" said Dyke, as the carcass of the dead lion  lay now well in sight.    \"Yes; he's one of the finest I have seen.  You ought to get the teeth  out of his head, little un; they'd do to save up for your museum.\"    \"I will,\" said Dyke.    The next minute they had dismounted, and were removing the horses'  bridles to let them pick off the green shoots of the bushes.  The rifles  had been laid down, and Duke had gone snuffing about among the rocks,  while Jack was proceeding to sharpen the edge of one of his assegais,  when the dog suddenly gave tongue.  There was a furious roar, the horses  pressed up together, and from close at hand a lion, evidently the  companion of that lying dead, sprang out and bounded away, soon placing  itself out of shot.    \"Ought to have been with us this morning,\" said Dyke, as he called back  the dog.    \"Couldn't have done better if we had had him,\" said Emson, quietly  rolling up his sleeves, an example followed by the boy.    \"Think that one will come back again?\" was the next remark.    \"Not while we are here,\" was Emson's reply; and then, as the evening was  drawing on, he set to work helping Jack, who was cleverly running the  point and edge of his assegai through the skin from the lion's chin to  tail, and then inside each leg right down to the toes.    A busy time ensued, resulting in the heavy skin being removed uninjured,  and rolled up and packed across Emson's horse.    \"You'll have to leave the teeth till another day,\" said Emson, as the  stars began to peep out faintly, and they trotted homeward; but before  they had left the carcass a couple of hundred yards, a snapping,  snarling, and howling made Duke stop short and look inquiringly up at  his masters, as much as to say:    \"Are you going to let them do that?\"  But at a word he followed on  obediently, and the noise increased.    \"Won't be much lion left by to-morrow morning, Joe,\" said Dyke.    \"No, boy.  Africa is well scavengered, what with the jackals, birds, and  flies.  But we'd better get that skin well under cover somewhere when we  are back.\"    \"Why?  Think the jackals will follow, and try and drag it away?\"    \"No; I was feeling sure that the other lion would.\"    Emson was right, for Dyke was awakened that night by the alarm of the  horses and oxen, who gave pretty good evidence of the huge cat's being  near, but a couple of shots from Emson's gun rang out, and the animals  settled down quietly once again, there being no further disturbance that  night on the lonely farm.        CHAPTER EIGHT.    THE DESERT HERDS.    \"I tell you what, little un,\" said Emson some mornings later, \"I'm going  to start a crest and motto, and I'll take a doubled fist for the crest,  and _Nil desperandum_ for motto.\"    \"And what good will that do you?\" said Dyke, hammering away as he knelt  on the sand with the lion's skull held between his knees.    \"What good!  Why, I shall always have my motto before me--`Never  despair,' and the doubled fist to--\"    \"To show that you are always ready to punch Kaffir Jack's head,\" cried  Dyke quickly; and bang went the hammer on the end of the cold chisel the  boy held.    \"No,\" said Emson, laughing--\"to denote determination.\"    \"`Inasmuch as to which?' as the Yankee said in his book.--Pincers,  please.  Here, what have you done with those pincers, Joe?\"    \"Haven't touched them.  They're underneath you, stupid.\"    \"Oh, ah! so they are,\" said Dyke; and picking them up, he took careful  hold of one of the lion's tusks, after loosening it with the hammer and  chisel, and dragged it out without having injured the enamel in the  least.    The two sharply-pointed fangs had been extracted from the lower jaw, and  Dyke was busily operating on the skull, which was, like the bones  scattered here and there, picked quite clean, the work of the jackals  and vultures having been finished off by the ants; and as Dyke held up  the third tusk in triumph, his brother took the piece of curved ivory  and turned it over in his hand, while Duke and the horses seemed to be  interested spectators.    \"Magnificent specimen of a canine tooth,\" said Emson thoughtfully.    Dyke laughed.    \"I know better than that.  It can't be.\"    \"Can't?  But it is,\" replied Emson.  \"What do you mean?\"    \"Canine means dog, doesn't it?  Dog's teeth can't grow in a big cat.  It's a feline tooth.\"    \"They can grow in human jaws--in yours, for instance.  You have four  canine teeth, as the naturalists call them; so why can't they grow in a  lion's?\"    \"Because it's unnatural,\" said Dyke, beginning to chip away some of the  jawbone from around the last tusk.  \"Canine teeth can grow in my jaws,  because you said one day that I was a puppy.\"    \"I say, don't, little un.  You're growing too clever, and attempts at  jokes like that don't seem to fit out here in this hungry desert.  Mind  what you are about, or you'll spoil the tooth.\"    \"I'm minding; but what did you mean about your _Nil desperandum_?\"    \"That I'll never despair.  When we've tried everything we can out here,  and failed, we'll go back home and settle in London.  Something always  turns up, and you're so handy, that we'll start as dentists, and you  shall extract all the teeth.\"    \"All right, Joe.  My word! this is a tight one.  But people wouldn't  have their teeth taken out with hammer and chisel.\"    \"You could use laughing gas.\"    \"They wouldn't laugh much, gas or no gas,\" cried Dyke, \"if I got hold of  their teeth with the pincers, like this.  I say, this is a tough one.  He never had toothache in this.  You have a go: your muscles are  stronger than mine.\"    \"No; have another try.\"    \"But it makes me so hot.\"    \"Never mind.  Remember my crest and motto--doubled fist for  determination, and `Never despair.'\"    \"Who's going to despair over a big tooth?\" cried Dyke, holding on to the  pincers with both hands, giving a good wrench, and tearing out the tusk.  \"That's got him.  Phew! it was a job.  I say, they'll look well as  curiosities.\"    \"Yes, they're a fine set,\" said Emson, taking out his little double  glass, and beginning slowly to sweep the plain.    \"See anything?\" asked Dyke, as he rose to his feet, and put the hammer,  chisel, and pincers in a leather case buckled behind his saddle, and  washed his hands, drily, in sand.    \"Not yet.\"    \"Oh, do see something!  We must get a buck of some kind to take home  with us.\"    \"Yes, we ought to get something, or Jack will forsake us because we are  starving him; and take away his wife.  You'll have to cook then, little  un.\"    \"Won't matter, if there's nothing to cook,\" said Dyke sharply.  \"But, I  say, Joe, you do think we are getting on better with the birds?  Only  two chicks have died since we took home those eggs.\"    \"Only two,\" said Emson, rather bitterly.  \"That's one a week.  Easily  calculate how long we shall be in getting to the end of our stock.\"    \"I say, what about your motto?  Who's looking on the black side?\"    \"Guilty, my lord.  Come along; jump up.  We will have something or  another to take back for a roast.\"    Dyke sprang upon his horse, the dog gave a joyful bark, and they  cantered off, Dyke placing his rifle on his rein hand, while he  rearranged the tusks in his pocket, to keep them from rattling.    \"Which way are we going?\" he said.    \"Let's try west; we may perhaps see ostriches.\"    \"Oh, don't talk about them,\" cried Dyke; \"I do get so tired of the  wretches.  I say, that young cock number two showed fight at me this  morning, and kicked.  He just missed my leg.\"    \"What?  Oh, you must be careful, old chap.  I can't afford to have your  leg broken.  But, I say, I had a look at the stores this morning before  we started.\"    \"I saw you, and wondered what you were doing.\"    \"The mealie bag is nearly empty.  One of us will have to take the wagon  across to old Morgenstein's and buy stores.\"   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24852"],[0,"The Wonders of the Jungle, Book One (#10)"],[1,"to  order a tiger hunt for them. But it is not easy to have a tiger hunt  just when you want to have it. Why not? Because the tiger will _not_  come out and be hunted just when you want him to. He would rather stay  in his den.    So for a few days no one heard of a tiger prowling about. Then  suddenly a strange piece of news came from that village where Gulab  lived. It happened in this way:    One day Gulab took out the buffaloes to graze and to wallow. The  buffaloes lay down in the shallow water for a while, and Gulab  splashed about or tumbled in the mud near them. Then he got tired of  doing that, and came out on the bank and played about there for a  while.    Suddenly he heard a strange sound. It was one of the buffaloes, who  had stood up in the water and was giving a low, deep bellow. Two or  three other buffaloes stood up also, and gave a low, deep bellow. Then  all at once the whole lot of them began to come out of the water.    Gulab stopped in his play to see what was wrong. But he could see  nothing.    \"What's the matter, Baldo?\" he asked. \"What's wrong, Chando?\"    But the two biggest bulls scrambled up the bank, and came rushing  toward the boy. All the other bulls came also, and some went past him  on the right side, and some went past him on the left side. Then  suddenly Gulab knew what it all meant!    A snarl--a growl--a roar, he heard. A flash of yellow leaped out of  the jungle, and came toward him with a huge jump. It was a tiger!    But already the buffaloes were making a ring around Gulab. Then he  knew what had happened. The tiger had seen him from the jungle beyond,  and had been trying to creep up to him quietly from thicket to  thicket. But the buffaloes had _smelled_ the tiger in time, and had  run out of the pond to save Gulab. And now they had made a ring around  him.    Gulab stood in the ring and looked with large round eyes, for he was  more frightened than he had ever been in his life. He was only a  little boy, and had never seen a tiger face to face.    The tiger growled and snarled and roared. Then it came round and round  the ring, trying to find a gap between the horns to get at the boy.  But there was no gap between the horns.    Then little by little the fear left Gulab's heart. Something inside  him told him to be brave. He walked up to Baldo.    \"Baldo, let me up!\" Gulab said to him, standing behind the buffalo.  And Baldo lowered his body behind, and bent his hind legs at the  knees.    Gulab took hold of Baldo's tail in both hands, and put his foot on  Baldo's hind knee, which was now bent quite low. In that way Gulab  climbed up to the buffalo's back, and sat on it, holding on to Baldo's  shoulders.    Then, being quite safe on the buffalo's back, Gulab glanced around and  called to the buffaloes at the back of the ring, \"Open out!\" And the  buffaloes opened out at the back of the ring, and made a crescent.  Then they moved still farther around, and the crescent became one long  line, facing the tiger.    Gulab gave one glance to right and left, to see that all were ready.  Then--    \"Charge, brothers, charge!\" he cried to the buffaloes.    Then his big brothers, the buffaloes, charged with thundering hoofs  and fiery nostrils. The tiger gave a huge leap to the side to get  away; but the buffaloes on that side opened out and headed off the  tiger. On to the front again the tiger was forced to turn--and run for  his life before the furious herd.    The buffaloes chased and chased that tiger, across field and jungle,  over hedges and ditches, through brambles and bushes and thickets,  till at last the tiger jumped across a ravine and ran away growling  and howling and snarling, like a low thief who is chased out of a  village at night.    The ravine was a deep hollow in the ground, like a huge ditch; and it  ran all the way across the ground; so the buffaloes could not get over  it, as they cannot jump as far as a tiger. Then the buffaloes returned  to the village, and Gulab gave the news about the tiger.    Some of the village people ran to the palace, and said that the tiger  might be still hiding somewhere on the other side of the ravine. So  the six Englishmen went around to that side to hunt the tiger. They  found him and wounded him four or five times. But it takes a lot more  than that to kill a tiger. The tiger ran out, got past the hunters,  and came back again across the ravine. Here he hid in a dense thicket,  and would not come out and be hunted to please anybody.    Now, when a tiger is hiding in a thicket and will not come out and be  hunted, there is only one way to _make_ him come out.    What is that way? Can you tell?    Why, of course, the bull buffaloes!    So the herdsman brought up the thirty bull buffaloes, and drew them up  in a long line in front of the thicket. And on the other side of the  thicket the six Englishmen got up into trees, and pointed their guns  at the thicket.    Then the herdsman ordered the buffaloes to charge, and they charged  right through the thicket, trampling it down and cutting it up into  lanes; so the tiger _had_ to run out on the other side. But on that  side the six Englishmen were waiting for him; and they all fired at  the tiger at once, and all hit him. They used a kind of bullet that  broke up into a hundred pieces right inside the tiger.    But the tiger still kicked and kicked, and would not agree to be dead  at once, as any other animal would. People say that a cat has nine  lives; then a tiger must have ninety-nine lives. So this tiger jumped  about, torn up as he was, and glared at the Englishmen in the trees,  trying to get at them, while they were loading their guns for another  shot.    But the buffaloes went on charging, and caught up with the tiger. They  rushed upon him, and now the torn-up tiger could not get away. So the  buffaloes trampled upon him, and then the tiger agreed to lie still  and be dead, really and truly.    The six Englishmen began to climb down from the trees, as they thought  the excitement was all over. But the herdsman called out to them at  once:    \"Please go up again--quick! Don't let my buffaloes see you!\"    For I must tell you now that buffaloes do not like strangers. They may  be very fond of their own friends in the village; but if they should  see a stranger, they would charge him just as quickly as they would  charge a tiger. And the Englishmen would look quite strange to the  buffaloes.    So the Englishmen remembered that, and stayed up in the trees till the  buffaloes were taken away.    The buffaloes were taken to the pond; and as the herdsman would not  bother to stay with them there, he left the buffaloes in the pond to  do as they pleased till evening.    The six Englishmen had their lunch there, when they got down from the  trees. They gave their guns to their servants, to carry away to the  palace. Afterwards the Englishmen walked about, smoking their cigars,  as they did not want to return to the palace so soon.    But four or five hours passed, and still they had not come back to the  palace. It was nearly evening, and still they had not come.    And in the village Gulab said to his Papa, who was the herdsman,  \"Papa, I shall bring the buffaloes home now.\"    He went to the pond. But the buffaloes were not there! He shouted,  whistled, and gave all the buffalo calls he knew. But no answer!    He looked about, and searched everywhere, but he could not see the  buffaloes. What had become of them?    Then he happened to look far to the side, toward a lot of tall trees.  Something was happening under the trees! He could see a lot of things  moving there, but he was too far away to see what they were.    He ran toward the trees. Yes, they were the buffaloes! But why were  they there? And why were they behaving like that?    For he saw that they were pawing the ground angrily, and tossing their  heads and rattling their horns. And what was very strange, the  buffaloes were not looking at anything on the ground in front of  them. They were looking _up_, at the trees!    Then Gulab glanced up into the trees, and saw at once why the  buffaloes were behaving like that. But he did not waste a minute. He  ran to the buffaloes, shouting:    \"Down, Baldo! Down, Chando!\"    But the two biggest bulls and all the others glared at the trees and  snorted in fury.    \"Down!\" Gulab shrieked. \"Down, or I shall spank you!\"    He rushed to Baldo, and spanked him on the jaw. He rushed to Chando,  and spanked him on the jaw. He rushed from buffalo to buffalo, and  spanked each one on the jaw.    Then the huge animals that had charged the raging tiger, and that were  now fierce themselves, obeyed the little boy. They blinked, then one  by one lowered their heads. Gulab climbed up by Baldo's horns, and  seated himself on his back.    \"Now turn around, all!\" he ordered. And the buffaloes slowly turned  away from the trees.    Gulab looked back over his shoulder, and said to the six Englishmen  who were up in the trees: \"You may come down now. My buffaloes won't  hurt you a bit, because if they try to I will spank them!\"    Then the little boy took away the buffaloes, and the six big  Englishmen came down from the trees quite safely.    And now, do you understand what had happened? I shall tell you. The  Englishmen had forgotten what the herdsman had told them--about  keeping away from the buffaloes. The Englishmen had walked about, and  had finally come near the pond where the buffaloes were.    Then the buffaloes had come out and charged them. The Englishmen had  run and run, and had just managed to reach the trees. But the  buffaloes had come there after them! So the big Englishmen had to stay  up in the trees, and wait for some little village boy to come and take  away the furious buffaloes.    I have told you this story, my dear (and it is a true story) just to  show you what kind of an animal the buffalo is--at least, this sort of  buffalo. Even when he is furious, he "]]]
