[429] Capt., McDonald.    This sentence being read to Spelman he, as one that had in him more of  the Savage then of the Christian, muttered certaine wordes to himselfe  neither shewing any remorse for his offences, nor yet any thankfulness  to the Assembly for theire sofavourable censure, w^{ch} he at one time  or another (God's grace not wholly abandoning him) might w^{th} some one  service have been able to have redeemed.[O]    [O] This paragraph appears only in the McDonald copy, and in that it has  two rows of lines at right angles to each other and diagonally across  it, as if to indicate that this portion of the record was considered as  being improperly made or, perhaps, was not official.    This day also did the Inhabitants of Paspaheigh, alias Argall's towne,  present a petition to the general assembly to give them an absolute  dischardge from certaine bondes wherin they stand bound to Captain  Samuell Argall for the paym^t of 600^G,[430] and to Captain William  Powell, at Captaine Argall's appointment, for the paym^t of 50^G[431]  more. To Captaine Argall for 15 skore acres of wooddy ground, called by  the name of Argal's[432] towne or Paspaheigh; to Captaine Powell in  respect of his paines in clearing the grounde and building the houses,  for w^{ch} Captaine[433] Argal ought to have given him satisfaction.  Nowe,[434] the general assembly being doubtful whether they have any  power and authority to dischardge the said bondes, doe by these  presents[435] (at the Instance of the said Inhabitants[436] of  Paspaheighs, alias Martin's hundred people) become most humble sutours  to the Tresurer, Counsell and Company in England that they wilbe[437]  pleased to gett the said bondes for 600^G[438] to be cancelled;  forasmuche as in their great comission they have expressly and by name  appointed that place of Paspaheigh for parte of the Governo^r's[439]  lande. And wheras Captain[440] William Powell is payde[441] his 50^G  w^{ch} Captaine[442] Argall enjoined the saide Inhabitantes to presente  him with, as parte[443] of the bargaine, the general assembly, at their  intreaty, do become sutours on their behalfe, that Captaine Argall, by  the Counsell & Company in England, may be compelled either to restore  the said 50^G[444] from thence, or else that restitution therof be made  here out of the goods of the said Captaine Argall.

The last acte of the Generall Assembly was a contribution to gratifie  their officers, as followeth:[P]    [P] This paragraph is in the McDonald and Bancroft copies but not in De  Jarnette's.    AUG. 4^{th}, 1619.    It is fully agreed at this generall[445] Assembly that in regarde of the  great[446] paines and labour of the[447] Speaker of this Assembly (who  not onely[448] first formed the same Assembly and to their great ease &  expedition reduced all matters to be treatted of into a ready method,  but also his indisposition notw^{th}standing wrote or dictated all  orders and other expedients and is yet[449] to write severall bookes for  all the Generall[450] Incorporations and plantations both of the great  charter, and of all the lawes) and likewise in respecte of the  dilligence of the Clerke and sergeant, officers thereto belonging. That  every man and manservant of above 16 yeares of age shall pay into the  handes and Custody of the Burgesses of every Incorporation and  plantation one pound of the best Tobacco, to be distributed to the  Speaker and likewise to the Clerke and sargeant of the Assembly,  according to their degrees and rankes, the whole bulke whereof to be  delivered into the Speaker's handes, to be divided accordingly. And in  regarde[451] the Provost Marshall of James citty hath also given some  attendance upon the said Generall Assembly, he is also to have a share  out of the same. And this is to begin to be gathered the 24^{th} of  February nexte.    [445] general, McDonald.    [446] greate, Bancroft.    [447] this, McDonald.    [448] only, McDonald.    [449] yett, Bancroft.    [450] severall, McDonald, Bancroft.    [451] regard to, McDonald; regard, Bancroft.    In conclusion, the whole Assembly comaunded[452] the Speaker (as nowe he  doth) to present their humble excuse to the Treasurer[453] Counsell &  Company in England for being constrained by the intemperature of the  weather and the falling sick of diverse of the Burgesses to breake up so  abruptly--before they had so much as putt their lawes to the ingrossing.  This they wholly comited to[454] the fidelity of their speaker, who  therin[455] (his conscience telles him) hath done the parte[456] of an  honest man, otherwise he would be easily founde[457] out by the  Burgesses themselves, who w^{th} all expedition are to have so many  bookes of the same lawes as there be both Incorporations and Plantations  in the Colony.    [452] comanded, McDonald, Bancroft.    [453] Tresurer, McDonald, Bancroft.    [454] in, Bancroft.    [455] therein, McDonald.    [456] part, McDonald.    [457] woulde easily be found, McDonald; would easily be founde,  Bancroft.    In the seconde place, the Assembly doth most humbly crave pardon that in  so shorte[458] a space they could bring their matter to no[459] more  perfection, being for the present enforced to sende home titles rather  then lawes, Propositions rather then resolutions, Attemptes then  Acchievements, hoping their courtesy will accepte our poore indevour,  and their wisedome wilbe[460] ready to supporte the weaknes of this  little flocke.    [458] short, McDonald.    [459] no, omitted by McDonald.    [460] will be, McDonald, Bancroft.    Thirdly, the General Assembly doth humbly beseech[461] the said  Treasurer,[462] Counsell & Company, that albeit it belongeth to them  onely to allowe or to abrogate any lawes w^{ch} we shall here make,[463]  and that it is their right so to doe,[464] yet that it would please them  not to take it in ill parte if these lawes w^{ch} we have nowe brought  to light, do passe currant[465] & be of force till suche time as we[466]  may knowe their farther pleasure out of Englande: for otherwise this  people (who nowe at length have gotte[467] the raines[468] of former  servitude into their owne swindge) would in shorte time growe so  insolent, as they would shake off all government, and there would be no  living among them.    [461] beseeche, McDonald.    [462] Tresurer, McDonald.    [463] inacte, McDonald, Bancroft.    [464] righte soe to do, McDonald; right so to doe, Bancroft.    [465] current, Bancroft.    [466] wee, McDonald.    [467] gott, McDonald; got, Bancroft.    [468] reines, McDonald; raines, Bancroft.    Their last humble suite is,[469] that the said Counsell & Company would  be pleased, so soon as they shall finde[470] it convenient, to make  good their promise sett downe[471] at the conclusion of their comission  for establishing the Counsel[472] of Estate & the General[473] Assembly,  namely, that they will give us power to allowe or disallowe of their  orders of Courte, as his Ma^{ty}[474] hath given them power to allowe or  to reject[475] our lawes.    [469] suit, McDonald.    [470] find, McDonald.    [471] down, McDonald.    [472] Counsell, McDonald, Bancroft.    [473] Generall, McDonald.    [474] Majesty, McDonald; Ma^{ty}, Bancroft.    [475] rejecte, McDonald, Bancroft.    In sume Sir George Yeardley, the Governo^r[476] prorogued the said  General[477] Assembly till the firste of Marche, which is to fall out  this present yeare of 1619, and in the mean season dissolved the same.

JOHN McDONAGH,  Record Agent.  July 14th, 1871.    The McDonald copy has the following after Finis:    (in Dorso.)  1619.  The proceedings of the first Assembly of Virginia. July 1619.  True Copy,  AUGUSTUS AUSTEN BURT.          LISTS    OF THE    LIVINGE & THE DEAD IN VIRGINIA      February 16, 1623.          _EDITORS' NOTE._      The paper from which this document is printed is to be found in the  first volume of the McDonald papers. It is such a census of the  inhabitants of the colony as the historical student would like to see  made out at several other periods of our colonial history. We can find  no legal enactment requiring such a census to be taken, and no order to  that effect, save in the Instructions to Governor Wyatt, dated 24th  July, 1621, where, among other things, he is directed \"To make a  catalogue of the people in every plantation, and their conditions; and  of deaths, marriages and christenings.\"--Hening, Vol. I., p. 115.    The entries are as brief as possible, no middle names are given, and  foreigners are entered according to nationality, or not more than one  name allowed them. Not the least curious is the small number of negroes.
