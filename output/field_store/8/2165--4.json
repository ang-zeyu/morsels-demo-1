[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22716"],[0,"The Book-Hunter at Home (#10)"],[1," letter of  introduction to a collector with whom he desired me to become  acquainted. I was given to understand that the fellow-spirit was an  exceedingly well-read man, and something of a wanderer.    'He's a great traveller,' said my friend with a laugh, 'there's hardly a  country in the world that he has not visited.'    'What an interesting man he must be,' I replied, 'but why do you laugh?'    'Oh, you'll see all right presently,' said he; 'but go and spend an  evening with him; you will certainly be entertained--provided you are  sympathetic and content to let him do all the talking.'    So a few days later I called at the house of the traveller. He welcomed  me in his study, a fine large room yet possessed of that cosiness  imparted by the presence of many books. The walls were entirely covered  with bookcases to a height of about eight feet; and these contained, he  told me, about three thousand volumes. At the end of this long room was a  wide bay window, and here was placed a comfortable easy chair with twin  oak tables, very strong and low, at either arm. Close at hand were a  revolving bookcase and a stand containing five or six japanned cylinders  about three feet long, and some six inches across, such as are used to  contain nautical charts.    'You are fond of travel, are you not?' I remarked, as soon as I was  settled. 'Jones told me that there are few countries with which you are  unacquainted.'    'That is so,' he replied; 'travel has always been my passion from my  youth up, and of all the volumes which you see around you, there are  scarcely a hundred that do not treat of some foreign country or voyage.'    'How interesting,' I replied; 'it is a wise old dictum that there is  nothing like travel to broaden one's mind. Unless we acquaint ourselves  with the opinions held by men of other nations, men whose everyday life  differs so widely from our own, who see things consequently from a  different standpoint, how can we expect to regard any subject from all  its various aspects, which is essential if we are to pronounce an  opinion which----'    'Quite so,' he interrupted, eyeing me suspiciously, and obviously fearing  from my verbiage that he was about to be beset by a bore. (To tell the  truth, I was rather glad of his interruption, for the sentence was  beginning to get out of hand.) 'As you say, there's nothing like travel  to broaden the mind. Why,' he went on hurriedly, 'before I was eighteen I  had been up Aconcagua with Conway.'    'Really?' I said, trying to associate the two with a country and a date.  (Of course I knew where Aconcagua was--it was one of the most familiar  names in my geography, only for the moment memory was a little  refractory. Obviously it was a mountain, because he spoke of having been  'up' it. The name had a Spanish ending--of course! now I knew.) 'A  wonderful country, Mexico,' I went on.    'Mexico?' said he; 'yes, I know Mexico too. Been right through it, from  Chihuahua to Tehuentepec and Campeachy.' (This was unfortunate, but  apparently he didn't notice the mistake, for he went on at once.) 'But as  I was saying, I'd been up Aconcagua before I left school.'    'Good gracious,' I replied, amazed at his intrepidity, 'that must have  been an experience!'    'Rather,' said he: 'Haven't you read Conway's book? Published in '02, I  think.' He strode across the room and brought back a volume. 'Yes, 1902:  capital book; well worth reading. But Mexico,' he continued, without  giving me time to display the knowledge that I suddenly recollected as I  turned the pages of the book, 'Ah! there's a country for you! How I  enjoyed my first visit! Ever been there?'    'Alas! no,' I replied; 'but one of my fondest dreams has been to visit  the ancient cities of the new world.' (I thought that was rather nicely  put.)    'Charnay,' he said; 'you know Charnay, then? It was he who took me there  first. Early 'eighties, I think.' He pulled out another volume and turned  to the title-page. 'Here we are, \"The Ancient Cities of the New World,\"  '87. My copy is only the translation, published two years after the  original appeared.'    This puzzled me rather. If he had been eighteen in 1902, he must have  been a mere babe in 1885.    'Rather young, were you not, when you were there?' I ventured.    'Young? Why?' he replied.    'Oh, only because you said that you were eighteen when you ascended  Aconcagua in 1902, so I thought that you must have been rather young when  you were in Mexico in 1885.'    He stood still and stared at me, a puzzled look on his face.    'Good gracious,' he said, 'didn't Jones tell you? Didn't he explain to  you about me and my travels?'    'Oh yes,' I hastened to reassure him, fearful that I had given offence;  'he told me that you were a widely-travelled man; and, if you will permit  me to say so, I think he understated----'    'Yes, yes,' he went on, 'but didn't he tell you _how_ I travelled? Didn't  he tell you that I had never been out of Europe? This is my world,' he  continued, waving his arm round the bookcases; 'here are my Americas, my  Africa, my Asia, my Europe, and my Australia. There (pointing to a case  by the window) is my West Indies, here (indicating another one) is my  Polynesia, there my Arctic and Antarctic. Here (patting the back of the  big easy chair) is my steamboat, my mule, and my camel. No weather can  delay me, no storm prevent my setting out. Though it snow a blizzard,  still can I cross the very summits of the Andes: be there a year-old  drought, still may I journey from Sydney to Port Darwin overland.'    I could only marvel at the man. No world-wide traveller could have been  prouder or have found greater satisfaction in the contemplation of his  travels. And a further conversation assured me that, assisted by a good  memory, he knew more, far more, of the countries about which he had read  so many books than did ninety-nine out of a hundred of the tourists who  had actually visited those lands.    'Don't think,' he said, 'that I merely pass my time reading promiscuously  all manner of books of travel. I do nothing of the sort. At the beginning  of each year I map out the countries I intend to visit during that year.  So much time is allotted to each, according to the size of the country  and that of its travel literature. Then I compile a list of the books  that I intend to read, and the order in which they should be read. I have  a fine collection of maps, and those tin cylinders over there contain  charts, by means of which I am enabled to follow more accurately and  minutely the different journeys and voyages that I make.    'Let me give you an example.' Here he took a thin octavo book from one of  the cases. 'This is Commodore John Byron's narrative of the loss of  H.M.S. _Wager_, one of Anson's squadron, on the coast of Chili, in 1740.  It was published in 1768, and is, in my opinion, one of the most  thrilling tales of shipwreck and suffering that has ever been written. I  dare say you remember Campbell's beautiful lines in \"The Pleasures of  Hope\"; they are pencilled on the fly-leaf of my copy:--        '\"And such thy strength-inspiring aid that bore       The hardy Byron to his native shore--       In horrid climes, where Chiloe's tempests sweep       Tumultuous murmurs o'er the troubled deep,       'Twas his to mourn misfortune's rudest shock,       Scourg'd by the winds, and cradled on the rock,       To wake each joyless morn and search again       The famish'd haunts of solitary men.\"    'There is no map in the volume, much less a chart, to show where the ship  struck, though we are told that the land was \"on the larboard beam,  bearing N.W.,\" and that they landed \"in the latitude of between 47 and  48 deg. South.\" But without charts and maps how can one possibly follow the  journey of the four poor sufferers along the coast on that terrible march  from Mount Misery (as they named the inhospitable promontory where they  landed) to civilisation on the island of Chiloe? With my maps I can  follow their every footstep, with my chart I may visit each inlet that  their frail canoe entered. Nor need I refer to these aids whenever I may  turn to the volume again, for here (he unfolded a beautifully drawn map  bound at the end of the volume) I have copied a chart which shows with a  red line the whole of their terrible journey. I have done this with  several of the older works on travel which I possess, books that were  published without maps.'    To me at least it was a new aspect of book-collecting, and an interesting  one. But I confess to having been impressed more by its originality and  the patient perseverance of its devotee than by the knowledge which it  had enabled him to accumulate. His was a vast knowledge, yet limited; for  it was confined almost entirely to the topography and early exploration  of the countries which he studied, together with such sociology as he  would glean midst travellers' accounts of adventures and sport.  Development, resources, industry, had little place in it. He was  thoroughly conversant with the early history of Australia, could recite  the names of all the early pioneers, and could plot Burke's expedition or  Phillip's voyage to Botany Bay. But of Melbourne or Sydney to-day, their  size, commerce, exports, the principal industries or railways, of these  he knew nothing. On the other hand, with those countries which have come  less quickly under the hand of civilisation, such as New Guinea or West  Africa, he was well acquainted. He had followed the history of this last  down to fairly modern times, knew the story of every settlement from  Bathurst to the Bight and to Benguela, with their principal exports; and  could talk interestedly with any dweller on 'the Coast.'    He is still comparatively a young man. If ever he sets out to see the  world for himself, his pleasures will far exceed those of the ordinary  tourist.

The course of time has brought  none of the incongruities which have ruined many churches by the  so-called restorations of the last three hundred years, and although its  simple Romanesque is sadly unrepaired, it is a delight to come into the  solitude and find an unspoiled example of this stanch old style.    [Illustration: THE INTERIOR OF NOTRE-DAME-DU-BOURG.--DIGNE.]    The Romanesque shows forth its great solidity in the exterior of its  churches, and nowhere more than in Digne's deserted Cathedral. Flat  buttresses line the walls, the transepts are square and plain, and on  either side the facade wall is upheld by a formidable support. This  severity of line is not greatly modified by the deep recesses of a few  windows; nor is the tower--which lost its spire three hundred years  ago--of less sober construction, less solidly built. Below the  overhanging eaves of a miserable roof and the curious line of the nave  vault which projects through the wall, is a round window with a frame of  massive rolls and hollows; and below this again, under a narrow sloping  covering, is the deep arch of the Cathedral's porch. This, in its prime,  must have been the church's ornamental glory. Beneath the outer arch,  which is continued to the buttresses by half-arches, are the great  roll-mouldings that twist backward to a plain tympanum. Capitals still  support these massive curves of stone, but the niches in which the  columns formerly stood are empty, and grinning lions, lying on the  ground, no longer support the larger columns of the plain arch. All  stands in solemn decay.    The traveller entered a battered, brass-nailed door and saw before him  the stretch of a single, empty nave, a choir beneath whose lower vault  are three small windows, and on either side the archways which he knew  must lead to narrow transepts. In the south side, plain, rounded windows  give a glimmering light, and over each projects an arch, the modest  decoration of the walls. Far above rises the tunnel-vault, whose sheer  height is grandly dignified; the arches rest on roughly carved capitals,  and the outer rectangle of the piers is displaced for half a column. The  rehearsal of these most simple details seems but the writing of \"the  letter which killeth,\" and not the portrayal of the spirit that seems to  live within these walls. Details which seem so poorly few when read, are  nobly so when seen. This small old church has a true religious  stateliness, and it seemed as if a priest should bring the  Sanctuary-light which says, \"The Lord is in His holy temple.\"    Saint-Jerome was built between 1490 and 1500, a hundred years before its  episcopal elevation, and forms a most complete antithesis to  Notre-Dame-du-Bourg which it supplanted in 1591. Where Notre-Dame is  small, Saint-Jerome is large, where the old church is simple, the newer  one is either pretentious or sumptuous, and where the one is Romanesque,  the other is Gothic.    The present Cathedral stands on the heights of the city; and from one  side or another its clean, straight walls can be seen in all their large  angularity and absence of architectural significance. Towers rise  conventionally above the facade; and a big broad flight of white stone  steps leads to three modern portals that have been built in an  economical imitation of the sculptured richness of the XIII century.    The interior, also Gothic, has neither clerestory nor triforium, and its  naves are covered by a vaulting which springs broadly from the round,  supporting piers. The conception is not noble, it has no simplicity, and  no more of spiritual suggestion than a Madonna of Titian; but the space  of the nave is so largely generous and the new polychrome so richly  toned that the church has majesty of space and harmony, deep lights and  subdued colourings; it is large and sumptuous with the munificence of a  Veronese canvas, a singular and most curious contrast to the cold  severity of its outer walls.    [Illustration: \"THE INTERIOR HAS NEITHER CLERESTORY NOR  TRIFORIUM.\"--DIGNE.]    Before the High Altar of this Church lies buried one whose spirit  suggests the Christ, a Bishop, yet a simple priest, whose life deserves  more words than does the whole of Saint-Jerome, once his  Cathedral-church. He was a Cure of Brignoles, one of those keen, yet  simple-hearted and hard-working priests who often bless Provencal towns.  He had no great ambitions, no patronage, no ties except a far-off  brother who was an upstart general of that most upstart Emperor,  Napoleon. One day while the priest was pottering in his little  garden,--as Provencal Cures love to dig and work,--a letter was handed  him, marked \"thirty sous of postage due.\" He was outraged. His shining  old soutane fell from the folds in which he had prudently tucked it, he  shrugged his shoulders and protested,--\"A great expense indeed for a  trivial purpose. Where should he find another thirty sous for his poor?  He never wrote letters. Therefore by no argument of any school of logic  could he be compelled to receive them. Obviously this was not for him.\"  The unexpected letter was one for which his brother had asked and which  Napoleon had signed, a decree which made him Bishop.    Long afterwards this simple, saintly prelate saved a man from crime, and  history relates that this same man died at Waterloo as a good and  faithful soldier fighting for the fatherland. His benefactor, that loyal  servant of Christ and His Church, soon followed him in death, and unlike  many a Saint whom this earth forgets his memory lives on, not only in  the little city of the snow-clad Alps, but in the hearts of those who  read of his good deeds. For Monseigneur Miollis of Digne is truly  Monseigneur Bienvenu of \"Les Miserables,\" and only the soldier of  Waterloo was glorified in Jean Valjean.      [Sidenote: Forcalquier.]    If it is difficult to picture sleepy, stately Aix as one of the most  brilliant centres of mediaeval Europe, and the garrisoned castle of  Tarascon filled with the gay courtiers and fair ladies of King Rene's  Court, it will be almost impossible to walk in the smaller Provencal  \"cities,\" and see in imagination the cavalcades of mailed soldiers who  clattered through the streets on their way to the castle of some  near-by hill-top, my lord proudly distinguishable by his mount or the  length of his plume, a delicate Countess languishing between the  curtains of her litter, or a more sprightly one who rode her palfrey and  smiled on the staring townsfolk. It is almost impossible to conceive  that the four daughters of Raymond Berenger, a Queen of the Romans, of  France, of Naples, and of England, were brought up in the castle of the  little hillside hamlet of Saint-Maime Dauphin. Provence is quiet, rural,  provincial; a land of markets, busy country inns, and farms; not of  modern greatness nor of modern renown. Its children are a fine and busy  race, no less strong and fine than in the land's more stirring times,  but they live their years of greatness in other, \"more progressive\"  parts of France, and the Provencal genius, which remains very native to  the soil, is broadly known to fame as \"French.\" Like some rich old wine  hidden in the cellars of the few, Provence lies safely ensconced behind  Avignon and Arles, and only the epicures of history penetrate her hills.    Her mediaeval ruins seem to belong to a past almost as dead and ghostly  as her Roman days, and to realise her Middle Ages, one must leave the  busy people in the town below, climb one of the hills, and sitting  beside the crumbling walls of some great tower or castle, watch the hot  sun setting behind the low mountains and lighting in a glow the bare  walls of some other ruined stronghold on a neighbouring height. The  shadows creep into the valleys, the rocks grow grey and cold, and the  clusters of trees beside them become darkly mysterious. Then far beneath  a white thread seems to appear, beginning at the valley's entrance and  twisting along its length until it disappears behind another hill. This  is the road; and by the time the eye has followed its long course,  daylight has grown fainter. Then Provence takes on a long-lost  splendour. To those who care to see, cavalcades of soldiers or of  hunters come home along the road, castles become whole and frowning, the  dying sun casts its light through their gaping window-holes, as light of  nightly revels used to shine, and a phantom Mediaevalism appears.    One of the powerful families of the country, the Counts of Forcalquier,  sprang from the House of Berenger in the XI century, and a hundred and  fifty years later, grown too great, were crushed by the haughty parent  house. More than one hill of Eastern Provence has borne their tall  watchtowers, more than one village owed them allegiance, and a large  town in the hills was their capital and bore their name. And yet not a  ruined tower that overlooks the Provencal mountains, not a village,  gate, or castle--Manosque or old Saint-Maime,--but speaks more vividly  of the old Counts than does Forcalquier, formerly their city, now a mere  country town which has lost prestige with its increasing isolation, many  of its inhabitants by plagues and wars, and almost all of its  picturesque Mediaevalism through the destructiveness of sieges.    Long before this day of contented stagnancy, in 1061, when Forcalquier,  fortified, growing, and important, claimed many honours, Bishop Gerard  Caprerius of Sisteron had given the city a Provost and a Chapter, and  created the Church of Saint-Mary, co-cathedral with that of Notre-Dame  of Sisteron. Not contented with this honour, Forcalquier demanded and  received a Bishopric of her own. Her hill was then crowned by a Citadel,  her Cathedral stood near-by, her walls were intact. Now the Citadel is  replaced by a peaceful pilgrims' chapel, the walls are gone, Saint-Mary,  ruined "]]]
