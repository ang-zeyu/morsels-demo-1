Enlarged \"fire-boxes,\" or furnaces,[15] enable steam to be  made more rapidly and to give higher speed.[16] Only a few years ago  forty-eight hours was the scheduled time between New York and Chicago;  now there are about forty trains a day between these two cities, several  of which make the trip in twenty-four hours or less.    =Railway Development.=--The railway as a common carrier, having its right  by virtue of a government charter, dates from 1801, when a tramway was  built between Croydon and Wandsworth, two suburbs of London. The rails  were iron straps, nailed to wooden stringers. The charter was carefully  drawn in order to prevent the road from competing with omnibus lines and  public cabs.    When the steam locomotive succeeded horse-power, however, there  followed an era of railway development that in a few years  revolutionized the carrying trade in the thickly settled parts of the  United States and Europe. Short, independent lines were constructed  without any reference whatever to the natural movement of traffic. There  seemed but one idea, namely, to connect two cities or towns. Indeed, the  absence of a definite plan was much similar to that of the interurban  electric roads a century later; local traffic was the only  consideration.    At first an opinion prevailed that the road-bed of the railway ought to  be a public highway upon which any individual or company might run its  own conveyances, on the payment of a fixed toll; indeed, in both Europe  and the United States, public opinion could see no difference between  the railway and the canal. The employment of a steam-driven locomotive  engine, however, made such a plan impossible, and demonstrated that the  roads must be thoroughly organized.    At the close of 1850 there were nearly four hundred different railway  companies in England; in the United States about a dozen companies were  required to make the connection of New York City and Buffalo. A few of  these paid dividends; a large majority barely met their operating  expenses, defaulting the interest on their bonds; a great many were  hopelessly bankrupt.    =Consolidation of Connecting Lines.=--Between 1850 and 1865 a new feature  entered into railway management, namely, the union of connecting lines.  This was a positive advantage, for the operating expenses of the sixteen  lines, now a part of the New York Central, between New York and Buffalo  were scarcely greater than the expenses of one-third that number. The  service was much quicker, better, and cheaper. In England the several  hundred companies were reduced to twelve; in France the thirty-five or  more companies were reduced to six in number.    The consolidation of connecting lines brought about another desirable  feature--the extension of the existing lines.[17] The lines of  continental Europe were extended eastward to the Russian frontier, and  to Constantinople; then the Alps were surmounted. In the United States  railway extension was equally great. The Union and Central Pacific  railways were opened in 1869, giving the first all-rail route to the  Pacific coast. Other routes to the Pacific followed within a few years,  one of which, the Canadian Pacific, was built from Quebec to Vancouver.    [Illustration: A TRUNK SYSTEM--THE VARIOUS BRANCHES EXTEND INTO COAL,  GRAIN, IRON, CATTLE, TIMBER, AND TOBACCO REGIONS]    The period from 1864 was one of extensive railway building both in the  United States and Europe. Some of the roads, such as the transalpine  railways of Europe and the Pacific roads of the United States, were  greatly needed. Others that created new fields of industry by opening to  communication productive lands were also wise and necessary; the lands  would have been valueless without them. Not a few lines that were to be  needed in time were built so far ahead of time that they did not even  pay their operating expenses for many years.    Another class of roads was intended for speculative purposes. Thus,  there were instances in which a line occupying a given territory had  antagonized its patrons by poor service, and extortionate charges.  Thereupon another company would obtain a charter--which was then easily  done--and build a competing line in the same territory, the former most  likely having scarcely enough business for one road.[18] The results  were almost always the same; a war of rate-cutting followed; the  stockholders of both roads lost heavily; and one or both went into the  hands of receivers.    =Competition and Pools.=--In many instances the consolidation of roads,  while cutting off disastrous competition in the territory jointly  occupied by the two roads, brought the consolidated road into fierce  competition with another adjacent system. If the roads had practically  the same territory but different terminals the competition was confined  mainly to local traffic. On the other hand, they might have the same  terminals but cover different local territories; in this case the roads  must compete for through traffic. Thus the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy  is brought into competition with the Union Pacific in Nebraska, but  inasmuch as the roads have different and widely distant terminals, their  local traffic is easily adjusted. The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy and  the Northwestern have common terminals at Chicago, St. Paul, Denver,  Omaha, and Kansas City. They must therefore compete with each other, and  with half-a-dozen other roads for their through traffic.    Competition between railways differs greatly from that between two  firms. If one of two firms cannot afford to compete, the manager may  discharge his help, and close doors; he then does not suffer actual  loss. But a railway, being a common carrier, cannot do this; the road  must keep its trains moving or lose its charter. If it cannot carry  goods at a profit it must carry them at cost or at a loss. Even the  latter is better than not carrying them at all, for the operating  expenses of the road must go on.    So between 1870 and 1880 most of the railway managements were busy  devising ways to stop a rate-cutting and competition that was ruinous.  In many instances great trunk lines would have consolidated had not  State laws prevented. They could not maintain rates because one or  another of the weaker roads would be compelled to lower their rates in  order to meet their operating expenses. Therefore they were compelled to  do one of three things, namely, to divide the territory, to divide  traffic, or to divide earnings. Either of the two latter plans is called  a _pool_.    Of these two forms of pooling the division of the traffic is the easier,  but it is often unsatisfactory to the patrons of the road. The second  plan, the division of the earnings, is a more difficult matter to adjust  because each road is usually dissatisfied with its proportion. As a  matter of fact, however, the first plan of pooling is very apt to grow  into the second.    In several instances pools have been declared illegal by the courts,  but, in general, railway service has been more satisfactory under the  pool system than under any other. They have always aroused popular  suspicion, however, from the fact that they increase power of the  railway itself. In various instances important trunk lines have formed a  general company, each having its separate organization, because they  could accomplish under a combined organization what they could not as  independent companies. The restrictions against pooling have therefore  encouraged combination of competing lines.    Because the railway is an absolute necessity, and because it has power  given neither to individuals nor to other corporations, it is a settled  policy that both the State and general Government should have the power  to regulate its rates, and should in every way prevent unjust  discrimination. Both problems are very difficult, however, and the  unintelligent adjustment of rates has frequently resulted in injustice  both to the roads and their patrons.    A rate per ton-mile for each class of freight is out of question,  because a large part of the cost to the company consists in loading,  handling, and storing the goods. Once aboard the car, it costs but  little more to carry a ton of freight one hundred miles than to move it  one mile. The rates per mile, therefore, are necessarily greater for  short distances than for long runs. A mile-rate based on a ten-mile haul  would be prohibitive to the shipper if applied to a run between Chicago  and New York. On the other hand, were the charges based on the long run,  the local rates would be far less than the cost of the service.[19]    As a result freight rates are based very largely on the cost of the  service, and this is particularly true of local freights. This practice  is also modified by charging _what the traffic will bear_, and, on the  whole, a combination of the two ideas gives the most reasonable and the  fairest method of basing charges. Thus, a car filled with fine, crated  furniture, which is light and bulky, can afford a higher rate than one  filled with scrap-iron. Cars filled with grain, lumber, coal, or ore are  made up in train-loads, and form a part of the daily haul; they can  afford to be taken at a lower rate than the stuffs of which only an  occasional car-load is hauled. In order to adjust this problem it is  customary to divide freights into six general classes.

This explains the gloomy air of Claudie, her  indifference to the advances of Sylvain, and her almost fierce  determination never to marry. To complete his outrages, Denis boldly  avows his intention to marry Dame Rose, and offers money to her he has  betrayed, in order to bribe her to silence. The band of harvesters  appears, bearing in triumph the last sheaf, adorned with flowers and  ribbons. The grandfather, Remy, full of joy, pronounces a discourse of  rude and simple eloquence on the beneficence of Providence, and of the  sun He causes to shine, after which a collection is proposed in favor of  the orator and his granddaughter. Every one gives his offering. Dame  Rose puts in a new five-franc piece, the father Fauveau a penny, Sylvain  his watch, wishing that it were his heart, a child brings an apple, and  finally the last contributor approaches. This is Denis Ronciat: seeing  the seducer of his child, the indignation of the old man breaks out, he  rejects the offering, and falls as if struck with apoplexy, pronouncing  a sort of mysterious malediction, which freezes with horror all who hear  it. In the second act Claudie is still at the farm, her grandfather  having been sick there for two months. She has been engaged as a servant  to the farmer Fauveau, but has not given the least hope to Sylvain, who  has been constant in his attentions. Dame Rose, in the mean time, has  fallen in love with him, and is astonished that he has not declared  himself. Denis Ronciat, seeing his rival preferred, explains to the rich  widow why the lover she desires will not present himself, and from  vengeance and vanity divulges the secret of poor Claudie. Here we expect  a storm of insults and reproaches to fall on the head of the dishonored  girl. But, as in the rest of the work, the author has laid aside the  ordinary traditions, customs, and conventionalities, to draw from the  resources of her own genius. While all are preparing to expel the  domestic who has deceived every body by her air of candor and innocence,  the old man, whose reason has been wandering, listens. He recalls his  recollections, and his presence of mind returns at the critical moment.  He rises, throws his arms around his granddaughter, and naively recounts  the story of the seduction and abandonment of Claudie: how she believed  in Denis, and gave him her heart without distrust; how Denis shamefully  abused her confidence, and abandoned her, when duty obliged him more  than ever to be faithful. The old man adds that he himself had neither  reproached nor cursed her, but that he consoled her, that he took her  child upon his knees, and loved it, and despaired when it died. Finally  he demands who would presume to be severer toward his child, and feel  her wrong more keenly than he. His simplicity, magnanimity, and  goodness, overpower all who hear him. A more gentle sentiment than even  respect and pity takes possession of every heart. The devotion of the  old man raises the fallen girl, and in the admiration he inspires the  fault of Claudie is almost forgotten. But it is too late. The old man  takes the arm of his daughter, and leads her away with him. When the  curtain rises for the last scene, Dame Rose has retained Claudie and her  grandfather at the house, a riot in the village having prevented their  departure. Denis has come near being stoned to death. Finally he  consents to repair his crime by marrying her he has betrayed. He is  refused. Then Sylvain offers himself to Claudie, but she says she is  unworthy of him, and refuses obstinately. Dame Rose, Fauveau, and even  Sylvain's mother, try vainly to change her resolution. The old man at  last decides, by saying that he reads her soul, and knows that she loves  Sylvain. His authority makes her give a silent consent, and here the  curtain falls. _Claudie_ has been brought out in elegant form by a  Parisian publisher. Why should not some poet attempt a version into  English?           *       *       *       *       *    Several new Plays and Operas have lately attracted attention in Paris.  _Paillasse_, in five acts, by MM. Dennery and Marc Fournier, produced at  the _Gaiete_ in November, was one of the greatest hits during the latter  part of 1850. The character of the conventional French mountebank,  Paillasse, the vagabond juggler of fairs and streets, was regarded as  one of the finest creations of Frederic Lemaitre, and in one of the  Christmas _revues_ a symbol of the piece passed before the eyes of the  audience as one of the types of the past year. It has since been brought  out in London with quite as much success, Madame Celeste (the quondam  star of our _Bowery_?) in the character of the wife of the mountebank.  The musical season at Paris has been signalized by the production of two  successful operas. _L'Enfante Prodigue_ of Auber is running a prosperous  career at the _Academie de Musique_. General opinion speaks highly of  the music, and the piece appears to be one of the most ingenious of M.  Scribe. At the _Opera Comique_ another opera by Scribe and Halevy, _La  Dame de Pique_, has been brought out with success. The _libretto_, taken  from a Russian tale, translated by M. Merimee, is one of the most  fantastic Scribe has constructed. It is founded on an old story about  the Russian Empress Elizabeth, who had found out the secret of  invariably winning at play by means of three cards, of which the Queen  of Spades (_la Dame de Pique_) was one.           *       *       *       *       *    M. COMBET, a Protestant clergyman of Cevennes, has just published at  Paris in three volumes a work of great interest and value, under the  title of _Histoire de France sous le regne de Henry III. par Mazerai_.  It comprises a full, conscientious and philosophic account of the French  religious civil wars, from the beginning of the Reformation down to the  establishment of religious liberty under the Consulate. To the original  work of Mazerai, M. Combet has prefixed an elaborate introduction, while  he has added in the form of an appendix whatever relates to more recent  matters, with copious notes and commentaries. The whole constitutes an  invaluable contribution to the history of the modern religious movement.           *       *       *       *       *    Some new contributions to the history of labor have just appeared at  Paris. The most important is the _Histoire de la Classe ouvriere depuis  l'esclave jusqu'au Proletaire de nos Jours_, by M. Robert (du Var), four  volumes. Less general and comprehensive in its aim is _Le Livre d'Or des  Metiers, Histoire des Corporations ouvrieres_, by Paul Lacroix and Ferd.  Serre, six volumes. Both these books are written without an intention to  establish any special theory or system.           *       *       *       *       *    THE REV. G. R. GLEIG, author of _The Subaltern's Furlough, Saratoga_,  &c., is now Inspector-General of Military Schools, and lives in London.           *       *       *       *       *    LEOPOLD RANKE, whose \"Lives of the Popes of Rome\" is familiar to  American readers, has lately discovered in the National Library at Paris  an important long lost MS., by the Cardinal Richelieu. In the MS.  memoirs of the Cardinal, deposited at the Office for Foreign Affairs, an  imperfection has existed, in the total absence of a series of leaves  from the most interesting part of the collection. These appear to have  been found accidentally, by M. Ranke, in a bundle of papers, gathered  from some of the old mansions in Saint Germains. It has been a disputed  question whether Richelieu was the real author of the works under his  name; whether he availed himself of the literary abilities of others,  contributing no more from his own resources than here and there an  observation or a fact. These disputes have had reference to the Memoirs,  the Testament, and the _Histoire de la Mere et du Fils_; for there seems  to be good reason for believing that the books published previous to his  political elevation, such as the _De la Perfection du Chretien_, the  theological tracts, and his political treatise of 1614, were written by  him with no more than the ordinary aids of authorship. It is possible  that the fragment, discovered by M. Ranke, may afford additional  evidence on this curious subject, which was lately debated in the  Academy.           *       *       *       *       *    Of _bad spelling_ George Sand writes, _apropos_ of some newspaper  controversy in Paris, that so far from bad spelling being a proof of  want of capacity, she has a letter of Jean Jacques Rousseau, in which  there are ten faults of spelling in three lines. Moreover, she assures  us, that she herself frequently makes a _lapsus pennae_ for which a  school-boy would be chastised.           *       *       *       *       *    LOLA MONTES has made her _debut_ in the literary arena, by the  publication in the _feuilleton_ of a daily newspaper of the first  portion of what she calls her \"Memoirs:\" a _quasi_-impertinent epistle  to the ex-king of Bavaria. Since, the publication has been suspended. It  promised merely scandal, without wit.           *       *       *       *       *    THE COUNT DE MONTALEMBERT has been elected a member of the French  Academy, in place of M. Droz. The election gives little satisfaction  outside the Institute; but the Count is not without eminence as a man of  letters. Some of his religious tracts are written with great eloquence  and pungency.           *       *       *       *       *    The seventh and last volume of the _Glossarium Mediae et Infimae  Latinitatis_ has just been published by the Didots at Paris. It is a  perfect repertory of information as to the middle ages, and cannot be  dispensed with by any one who aims to study the institutions, history,  and monuments of that period.           *       *       *       *       *    "]]]
