Such were the sentiments of the King's two kinsmen, the Earls of  Clarendon and Rochester. The power and favour of these noblemen seemed  to be great indeed. The younger brother was Lord Treasurer and prime  minister; and the elder, after holding the Privy Seal during some  months, had been appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The venerable  Ormond took the same side. Middleton and Preston, who, as managers  of the House of Commons, had recently learned by proof how dear the  established religion was to the loyal gentry of England, were also for  moderate counsels.    At the very beginning of the new year these statesmen and the great  party which they represented had to suffer a cruel mortification. That  the late King had been at heart a Roman Catholic had been, during  some months, suspected and whispered, but not formally announced. The  disclosure, indeed, could not be made without great scandal. Charles  had, times without number, declared himself a Protestant, and had  been in the habit of receiving the Eucharist from the Bishops of the  Established Church. Those Protestants who had stood by him in his  difficulties, and who still cherished an affectionate remembrance of  him, must be filled with shame and indignation by learning that his  whole life had been a lie, that, while he professed to belong to  their communion, he had really regarded them as heretics, and that the  demagogues who had represented him as a concealed Papist had been the  only people who had formed a correct judgment of his character. Even  Lewis understood enough of the state of public feeling in England to be  aware that the divulging of the truth might do harm, and had, of his own  accord, promised to keep the conversion of Charles strictly secret. [45]  James, while his power was still new, had thought that on this point it  was advisable to be cautious, and had not ventured to inter his brother  with the rites of the Church of Rome. For a time, therefore, every  man was at liberty to believe what he wished. The Papists claimed  the deceased prince as their proselyte. The Whigs execrated him as a  hypocrite and a renegade. The Tories regarded the report of his apostasy  as a calumny which Papists and Whigs had, for very different reasons,  a common interest in circulating. James now took a step which greatly  disconcerted the whole Anglican party. Two papers, in which were set  forth very concisely the arguments ordinarily used by Roman Catholics  in controversy with Protestants, had been found in Charles's strong  box, and appeared to be in his handwriting. These papers James  showed triumphantly to several Protestants, and declared that, to his  knowledge, his brother had lived and died a Roman Catholic. [46] One  of the persons to whom the manuscripts were exhibited was Archbishop  Sancroft. He read them with much emotion, and remained silent. Such  silence was only the natural effect of a struggle between respect and  vexation. But James supposed that the Primate was struck dumb by the  irresistible force of reason, and eagerly challenged his Grace to  produce, with the help of the whole episcopal bench, a satisfactory  reply. \"Let me have a solid answer, and in a gentlemanlike style; and it  may have the effect which you so much desire of bringing me over to your  Church.\" The Archbishop mildly said that, in his opinion, such an answer  might, without much difficulty, be written, but declined the controversy  on the plea of reverence for the memory of his deceased master. This  plea the King considered as the subterfuge of a vanquished disputant.  [47] Had he been well acquainted with the polemical literature of the  preceding century and a half, he would have known that the documents to  which he attached so much value might have been composed by any lad of  fifteen in the college of Douay, and contained nothing which had not, in  the opinion of all Protestant divines, been ten thousand times refuted.  In his ignorant exultation he ordered these tracts to be printed with  the utmost pomp of typography, and appended to them a declaration  attested by his sign manual, and certifying that the originals were  in his brother's own hand. James himself distributed the whole edition  among his courtiers and among the people of humbler rank who crowded  round his coach. He gave one copy to a young woman of mean condition  whom he supposed to be of his own religious persuasion, and assured  her that she would be greatly edified and comforted by the perusal.  In requital of his kindness she delivered to him, a few days later, an  epistle adjuring him to come out of the mystical Babylon and to dash  from his lips the cup of fornications. [48]    These things gave great uneasiness to Tory churchmen. Nor were the most  respectable Roman Catholic noblemen much better pleased. They might  indeed have been excused if passion had, at this conjuncture, made them  deaf to the voice of prudence and justice: for they had suffered much.  Protestant jealousy had degraded them from the rank to which they were  born, had closed the doors of the Parliament House on the heirs of  barons who had signed the Charter, had pronounced the command of a  company of foot too high a trust for the descendants of the generals  who had conquered at Flodden and Saint Quentin. There was scarcely one  eminent peer attached to the old faith whose honour, whose estate, whose  life had not been in jeopardy, who had not passed months in the Tower,  who had not often anticipated for himself the fate of Stafford. Men who  had been so long and cruelly oppressed might have been pardoned if they  had eagerly seized the first opportunity of obtaining at once greatness  and revenge. But neither fanaticism nor ambition, neither resentment for  past wrongs nor the intoxication produced by sudden good fortune,  could prevent the most eminent Roman Catholics from perceiving that the  prosperity which they at length enjoyed was only temporary, and, unless  wisely used, might be fatal to them. They had been taught, by a cruel  experience, that the antipathy of the nation to their religion was not  a fancy which would yield to the mandate of a prince, but a profound  sentiment, the growth of five generations, diffused through all ranks  and parties, and intertwined not less closely with the principles of the  Tory than with the principles of the Whig. It was indeed in the power  of the King, by the exercise of his prerogative of mercy, to suspend  the operation of the penal laws. It might hereafter be in his power, by  discreet management, to obtain from the Parliament a repeal of the acts  which imposed civil disabilities on those who professed his religion.  But, if he attempted to subdue the Protestant feeling of England by rude  means, it was easy to see that the violent compression of so powerful  and elastic a spring would be followed by as violent a recoil. The Roman  Catholic peers, by prematurely attempting to force their way into the  Privy Council and the House of Lords, might lose their mansions and  their ample estates, and might end their lives as traitors on Tower  Hill, or as beggars at the porches of Italian convents.    Such was the feeling of William Herbert, Earl of Powis, who was  generally regarded as the chief of the Roman Catholic aristocracy, and  who, according to Oates, was to have been prime minister if the Popish  plot had succeeded. John Lord Bellasyse took the same view of the state  of affairs. In his youth he had fought gallantly for Charles the First,  had been rewarded after the Restoration with high honours and  commands, and had quitted them when the Test Act was passed. With these  distinguished leaders all the noblest and most opulent members of their  church concurred, except Lord Arundell of Wardour, an old man fast  sinking into second childhood.    But there was at the court a small knot of Roman Catholics whose hearts  had been ulcerated by old injuries, whose heads had been turned by  recent elevation, who were impatient to climb to the highest honours of  the state, and who, having little to lose, were not troubled by  thoughts of the day of reckoning. One of these was Roger Palmer, Earl  of Castelmaine in Ireland, and husband of the Duchess of Cleveland. His  title had notoriously been purchased by his wife's dishonour and his  own. His fortune was small. His temper, naturally ungentle, had been  exasperated by his domestic vexations, by the public reproaches, and by  what he had undergone in the days of the Popish plot. He had been long a  prisoner, and had at length been tried for his life. Happily for him,  he was not put to the bar till the first burst of popular rage had spent  itself, and till the credit of the false witnesses had been blown upon.  He had therefore escaped, though very narrowly. [49] With Castelmaine  was allied one of the most favoured of his wife's hundred lovers, Henry  Jermyn, whom James had lately created a peer by the title of Lord Dover.  Jermyn had been distinguished more than twenty years before by his  vagrant amours and his desperate duels. He was now ruined by play, and  was eager to retrieve his fallen fortunes by means of lucrative posts  from which the laws excluded him. [50] To the same party belonged an  intriguing pushing Irishman named White, who had been much abroad, who  had served the House of Austria as something between an envoy and a spy,  and who had been rewarded for his services with the title of Marquess of  Albeville. [51]    Soon after the prorogation this reckless faction was strengthened by an  important reinforcement. Richard Talbot, Earl of Tyrconnel, the fiercest  and most uncompromising of all those who hated the liberties and  religion of England, arrived at court from Dublin.    Talbot was descended from an old Norman family which had been long  settled in Leinster, which had there sunk into "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/244"],[0,"A Study in Scarlet (#10)"],[1,"  the Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores  a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not  soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these  men there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was  punished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary,  Stangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the  deceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address  of the house at which he had boarded--a result which was entirely due to  the acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.    Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and  they appeared to afford him considerable amusement.    \"I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure  to score.\"    \"That depends on how it turns out.\"    \"Oh, bless you, it doesn't matter in the least. If the man is caught, it  will be _on account_ of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be _in  spite_ of their exertions. It's heads I win and tails you lose. Whatever  they do, they will have followers. 'Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot  qui l'admire.'\"    \"What on earth is this?\" I cried, for at this moment there came the  pattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by  audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.    \"It's the Baker Street division of the detective police force,\" said my  companion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a  dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped  eyes on.    \"'Tention!\" cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little  scoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. \"In  future you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you  must wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?\"    \"No, sir, we hain't,\" said one of the youths.    \"I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are  your wages.\" [13] He handed each of them a shilling.    \"Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.\"    He waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats,  and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.    \"There's more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than  out of a dozen of the force,\" Holmes remarked. \"The mere sight of an  official-looking person seals men's lips. These youngsters, however, go  everywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all  they want is organisation.\"    \"Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?\" I asked.    \"Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter  of time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance!  Here is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every  feature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There he  is!\"    There was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the  fair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and  burst into our sitting-room.    \"My dear fellow,\" he cried, wringing Holmes' unresponsive hand,  \"congratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.\"    A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion's expressive face.    \"Do you mean that you are on the right track?\" he asked.    \"The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.\"    \"And his name is?\"    \"Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty's navy,\" cried  Gregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.    Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.    \"Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,\" he said. \"We are anxious to  know how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?\"    \"I don't mind if I do,\" the detective answered. \"The tremendous  exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn  me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon  the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both  brain-workers.\"    \"You do me too much honour,\" said Holmes, gravely. \"Let us hear how you  arrived at this most gratifying result.\"    The detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently  at his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of  amusement.    \"The fun of it is,\" he cried, \"that that fool Lestrade, who thinks  himself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is  after the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime  than the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this  time.\"    The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.    \"And how did you get your clue?\"    \"Ah, I'll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is  strictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to contend  with was the finding of this American's antecedents. Some people would  have waited until their advertisements were answered, or until parties  came forward and volunteered information. That is not Tobias Gregson's  way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the dead man?\"    \"Yes,\" said Holmes; \"by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.\"    Gregson looked quite crest-fallen.    \"I had no idea that you noticed that,\" he said. \"Have you been there?\"    \"No.\"    \"Ha!\" cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; \"you should never neglect a  chance, however small it may seem.\"    \"To a great mind, nothing is little,\" remarked Holmes, sententiously.    \"Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that  size and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once.  He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier's Boarding  Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.\"    \"Smart--very smart!\" murmured Sherlock Holmes.    \"I next called upon Madame Charpentier,\" continued the detective.  \"I found her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room,  too--an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about  the eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn't escape  my notice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock  Holmes, when you come upon the right scent--a kind of thrill in your  nerves. 'Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr.  Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?' I asked.    \"The mother nodded. She didn't seem able to get out a word. The daughter  burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something  of the matter.    \"'At what o'clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?' I  asked.    \"'At eight o'clock,' she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her  agitation. 'His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two  trains--one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first. [14]    \"'And was that the last which you saw of him?'    \"A terrible change came over the woman's face as I asked the question.  Her features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she  could get out the single word 'Yes'--and when it did come it was in a  husky unnatural tone.    \"There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm  clear voice.    \"'No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,' she said. 'Let us be  frank with this gentleman. We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again.'    \"'God forgive you!' cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and  sinking back in her chair. 'You have murdered your brother.'    \"'Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,' the girl answered  firmly.    \"'You had best tell me all about it now,' I said. 'Half-confidences are  worse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.'    \"'On your head be it, Alice!' cried her mother; and then, turning to me,  'I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf  of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this  terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however,  that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be  compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character, his  profession, his antecedents would all forbid it.'    \"'Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,' I answered.  'Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.'    \"'Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,' she said, and her  daughter withdrew. 'Now, sir,' she continued, 'I had no intention of  telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I  have no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all  without omitting any particular.'    \"'It is your wisest course,' said I.    \"'Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his secretary,  Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I noticed a  \"Copenhagen\" label upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been  their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but his  employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise. He was coarse in his  habits and brutish in his ways. The very night of his arrival he became  very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o'clock in the  day he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His manners towards the  maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar. Worst of all, he  speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke  to her more than once in a way which, fortunately, she is too innocent  to understand. On one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and  embraced her--an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him  for his unmanly conduct.'    \"'But why did you stand all this,' I asked. 'I suppose that you can get  rid of your boarders when you wish.'    \"Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. 'Would to God that  I had given him notice on the very day that he came,' she said. 'But  it"]]]
