There was no dish, but the spit was  handed round, and each cut off a portion. Soup made from the ration  of meat was first served, then the hare, and then the sucking pig,  while the four orderlies had an ample meal from the ration of meat.  A supply of spirits had been carried in the staff waggon. This they  took, plentifully watered, with the meal; with a stronger cup  afterwards.    The night was so fine that all agreed that it was not worthwhile to  erect the tent carried for them in the waggon. At eight o'clock the  order for the next day's march came out, and two of the king's  orderlies started on horseback with copies of it to the commanders  of brigades, who in their turn communicated to the colonels of  their respective regiments.    The next evening the force encamped round Torgau, a very strong  fortress, where a great store of provisions had been collected.  Ample quarters were assigned to the marshal and his staff in the  town. Here they halted for a day to allow the other armies, which  had both farther to march, to keep abreast of them on their  respective lines of route.    Then, following the Elbe, the army arrived after two marches in  front of Dresden. The court of Saxony had, for years, been wasting  the revenues of the country in extravagance and luxury; while  intriguing incessantly with Austria, and dreaming of obtaining an  increase of territory at the expense of Prussia. No effort had been  made to prepare to carry out the engagements entered into with  Austria; and the army, utterly neglected, numbered but some fifteen  thousand. These were scattered over the country, and but poorly  provided with artillery.    When, then, the news arrived that three Prussian armies had crossed  the frontier, there was no thought of resistance; but orders were  despatched for the whole force to concentrate at Pirna, a strongly  fortified camp among the defiles of the mountains separating Saxony  from Bohemia. The position was almost an impregnable one, and they  could receive reinforcements from Bohemia.    On the arrival of the Prussian army the king fled, and Dresden  threw open its gates. As Frederick hoped to detach Saxony from the  alliance against him, the greater portion of the army were encamped  outside the town; three or four regiments, only, marching in and  quartering themselves in the empty Saxon barracks. The aid Saxony  could render Frederick would be insignificant, but it was most  desirable for him that he should ensure its neutrality, in order to  secure his communications with Prussia when he marched forward into  Bohemia.    Finding the king had gone, his first step was to send a general  officer, with a party of soldiers, to seize the archives in the  palace. Among these was discovered the prize he most desired to  find; namely a signed copy of the secret treaty, between Austria,  Russia, France, and Saxony, for the invasion and partition of  Prussia. Copies of this document were instantly sent off to the  courts of Europe, thus affording an ample justification for what  would otherwise have appeared a wholly unprovoked attack by Prussia  upon her neighbours. Had it not been for the discovery of this  document, Frederick would probably have always remained under the  stigma of engaging in an unprovoked and ambitious war; for the  court of Austria had hitherto, positively and categorically,  declared to Frederick's ambassador and envoys the non-existence of  any such treaty or agreement between the powers.    As the queen had remained in the palace, Frederick took up his  abode in another royal building, Marshal Keith and a large number  of officers being also quartered there. In order to prevent any  broils with the citizens, orders were issued that certain places of  refreshment were to be used only by officers, while the soldiers  were only to frequent wine and beer shops selected in the  neighbourhood of the barracks, and were strictly forbidden to enter  any others. Any soldier caught in an act of theft or pillage was to  be hung, forthwith, and all were enjoined to observe a friendly  demeanour to the people.    One evening, Fergus had been sent with a message to the camp, two  miles from the town. It was nearly ten o'clock when he started to  ride back. When within half a mile of the town he heard a pistol  shot, in the direction of a large house, a quarter of a mile from  the road.    Without hesitation he turned his horse's head in that direction. In  a couple of minutes he arrived at a pair of large gates. They were  closed, but he dismounted, fastened the bridle chain to them and,  snatching the pistols from his holsters, ran along by the side of a  high wall, until he came to a tree growing close to it.    With some difficulty, for his high boots were ill adapted to such  work, he climbed the tree, got on to the wall, and dropped down. He  was in large park-like grounds. Guided by a light in a window, he  ran to the house. The door was closed. After hesitating for a  moment he ran along and, soon coming, as he expected, to an open  window, he at once climbed through it. A door was open and, passing  on, he entered a large hall in which a light was burning.    Pausing to listen now, he heard voices upstairs and, holding a  pistol in each hand and his drawn sword in his teeth, he lightly  ascended the stairs. On the landing two men lay dead. Light was  issuing from a half-closed door and, noiselessly approaching it, he  looked in.    It was a small room. At the end stood eight or ten scared women,  huddled together; while a soldier, with a pistol in one hand and a  sword in the other, stood sentry over them. These were evidently  the servants of the chateau, who had been unceremoniously hauled  from their beds and gathered there, under a guard, to prevent them  from screaming or giving any alarm. As Fergus was equally anxious  that no alarm should be given, at present, he retired quietly.    A pair of double doors faced the top of the staircase. This was  evidently the grand reception room and, listening intently, he  could hear a murmur of voices inside. Turning the handle and  throwing them suddenly open, he entered.    Upon the floor lay the body of a gentleman. A lady, pale as death  and in a half-fainting condition, leant back in a settee; while a  girl of thirteen or fourteen lay on a couch, with bound hands and a  handkerchief fastened across her mouth.    Three soldiers were engaged in examining the contents of a large  coffer of jewels. As the door opened they turned round and, on  seeing a solitary officer, sprang forward with terrible oaths.  Fergus shot one of them as they did so, dropped the pistol, and  seized his sword. Both men fired. Fergus felt a stinging sensation  in his left arm, and the pistol held in that hand dropped to the  ground.    Confident in his swordsmanship, he awaited the onslaught of the two  marauders. The swords clashed, and at the second pass one of them  fell back, run through the body. The other, shouting for aid, stood  on the defensive. Fergus heard the rush of heavy steps coming down  the staircase and, just as three other men rushed into the room, he  almost clove his opponent's head in two, with a tremendous blow  from his claymore.      [Illustration: Two of the newcomers fired hastily--and both missed]      Two of the newcomers fired their pistols hastily--both missed--then  rushed at him with their swords; and as he was hotly engaged with  them the third, who was the sentry who had been placed over the  women, advanced slowly, with his pistol pointed, with the intention  of making sure of his aim. He paused close to the combatants,  waiting for an opportunity to fire between the shifting figures of  his comrades; when a white figure, after peering in at the door,  ran swiftly forward and threw herself on his back, hurling him  forward to the ground, his pistol exploding as he fell.    One of the others started back at the sound, and as he did so  Fergus ran him through the body. He then attacked his remaining  opponent, and after a few passes laid him dead beside his comrade.  Picking up his own fallen pistol, Fergus blew out the brains of the  soldier, who was struggling to free himself from the girl's weight,  and then helped her to her feet.    \"Well done, my brave girl!\" he said. \"You have saved my life. Now  run and tell those wenches to stop screaming, and to come and help  their mistress. These scoundrels are all killed, and there is  nothing more for them to be alarmed at.\"    Then he ran to the girl on the sofa, cut her cords with a dagger,  and freed her from the gag. As he did so, she leapt up and ran to  her mother's side; while Fergus, kneeling by the gentleman who had  fallen before he had entered, turned him over and, laying his ear  over his heart, listened intently.    \"He is alive,\" he said. \"His heart beats, but faintly. Tell the  maids to fetch some cordial.\"    The women were coming in now, some crying hysterically, some  shrieking afresh at the sight of the bodies that were strewn about  the room.    \"Silence!\" Fergus shouted sternly. \"Now, while one runs to fetch  some cordial, do three others come here, and aid me to lift your  master gently on to this couch.\"    The maid who had overthrown the soldier at once came forward to his  assistance.    \"Now, Truchen and Lisa,\" the young girl said, stamping her foot,  \"come at once.    \"Do you, Caroline, run and fetch the stand of cordials from the  dining room.\"    The two women approached timidly.    \"Now,\" Fergus said, \"get your arm under his shoulders, on your  side, and I will do the same. One of you others support his head  when we lift, the other take his feet.\"    So, gently he was raised and laid on the couch. By the time this  was done, the woman returned with a bottle of spirits.    \"Now,\" he said, \"water and a glass.\"    The young girl ran and fetched a carafe of water and a tumbler,  standing on a table by the wall.

Returning along the #North Walk#, the latest part of the cloisters, we  come again to the prior's door, by entering which the rest of the  interior may be inspected.    #The Ante-choir# occupies one compartment of the nave, and is  immediately under the organ loft. It was in mediaeval times a chapel  dedicated to Our Lady of Pity. The screens between this ante-choir and  the aisles on north and south, were in part formed from the  Perpendicular screen which originally divided off the Jesus Chapel from  the north aisle of the presbytery. Here in the ante-choir they are  certainly preferable, even as \"mutilated Perpendicular,\" to any modern  substitute; though it was lamentable vandalism to remove them from their  original positions, where they are shown in Britton's \"History.\"    #The Choir.#--It may be as well here to give a brief sketch of the  various re-modellings which have been effected in the arrangement of the  choir and presbytery of the cathedral.    Britton shows, in one of his plates published in 1816, the floor of the  choir continued at its level until, immediately before the altar, in the  apse, it rises by five steps to the level of the sanctuary (the  presbytery, after the Reformation, had been cut off from the choir by a  wooden screen, in front of which stood the communion table). Across both  transepts, in the beginning of the century, there stood cumbrous  two-storeyed structures containing pews not unlike boxes at a theatre,  as shown in a drawing here reproduced. In 1837, when Salvin re-modelled  the choir, these were removed, and on the south side replaced by a stone  gallery, and this again has been taken down.    In Dean Goulburn's time the floor of the presbytery was raised by two  steps, which occurred one bay past the tower arch eastward.    [Illustration: The Choir and Presbytery.]    Quite recently, there have been further alterations carried out by  Dean Lefroy. The eastern arm of the building was closed for two and a  half years, and during this time the whole of the whitewash, etc.,  covering the stonework was flaked off, with much benefit to the  appearance of this part of the interior. The level of the presbytery  floor has been brought forward to the tower arch, and at the same time  the floors of both transepts and choir were brought to one level, and  various obstructions in the way of pews and raised floors removed.    The choir was opened after this work by Archbishop Benson, 2nd May 1894.    [Illustration: A Stall in the Choir.]    #The Choir# extends one bay, or the space of two compartments, into the  nave, as was usual in cathedral priories, and was originally occupied  during the offices of the Benedictines by the prior, sub-prior, and the  sixty monks. The bishop--who was the nominal abbot--with his presbyters,  occupied the presbytery.    The stalls, sixty in number, with an additional two for the prior and  sub-prior, facing east, are fine specimens of fifteenth-century work,  the detail varying though the main lines are preserved in each.    Each of these stalls retains the _subsellium_ or _miserere_, which,  hinged at the back, turns up and discloses a small ledge beneath  supported by carving, which ledge is supposed to have been used by the  aged monks to rest on during the first long office of the Benedictines,  which lasted four hours. Did they, however, by any chance allow the  seat to fall, they are said to have had to go through the whole of their  prayers again as a penance. All these _misereres_ are worth studying,  especially as the white and grey paint which had disfigured them has  been cleaned off since 1806.    The choir was re-arranged by Salvin in 1833, and the chancellor's stall,  shown in early prints, against the north-east tower pier, was removed at  this time. The presbytery was filled with stalls, which have been lately  removed, and in part refixed in the nave. During the recent alterations  the row of fifteenth-century stalls, each with its _miserere_, has been  removed from its original position in front of the canopied stalls, and  placed across the transepts, and their place taken by others, made up of  various fragments of old seating.    Also the older bishop's throne, erected by Dean Lloyd late in the  eighteenth century, \"in resemblance to ancient Gothic workmanship,\" was  removed from the south-east pier of the tower and placed in the  consistory court, and its place taken (1894) by the present erection,  designed by Pearson also in the style of ancient Gothic workmanship, and  made by Cornish and Gaymer. The new pulpit, taking the place of that put  up after the demolition of the chancellor's stall, was designed by J.D.  Seddon, and executed by H. Hems of Exeter.    #The Pelican Lectern#, now in the choir (see illustration, p. 110), was  formerly hidden away in the Jesus Chapel; it is late Decorated in  character; the three small figures were added in 1845. There is enough  metal in this piece of mediaeval work to make a dozen modern replicas.    #The Presbytery# consists of two double severies, or four compartments,  terminated by a semi-circular apse of five compartments. The four  compartments on either side have, in the lower stages of their design,  rich four-centred arches of Perpendicular period, with niches between on  the piers; the spandrels are filled in to a horizontal line, above  which, at the level of the triforium floor, is an elaborate cusped  cresting. The triforium is Norman, lofty in scale. Over this come four  light transitional (Decorated to Perpendicular) clerestory windows, with  niches canopied forward in the thickness of the wall over the clerestory  path; the windows being on the outer face of wall. From the apex of the  ogee arches of the niches spring the vaulting ribs of the later vault,  without any intermediate shaft. The apse preserves its Norman  characteristics in the lower stage as well as at the triforium level.  Here the interest of the student must surely be concentrated; as this  eastern arm of the cathedral is the earliest part of the building.  Herbert, the founder, laid the foundation-stone at the extreme east,  probably in the original Norman Lady Chapel, and built westwards, and  here, in front of the high altar, was he buried.    [Illustration: The Choir and Presbytery in 1816.]    The remains of the first bishop's throne, with the westward position,  are in the central bay of the apse. Behind it, in the screen wall, can  be discerned an arch which looks like a door head; if there be a vault  beneath the presbytery, it is probable that this is the walled-up  entrance.    On the east side of the tower over the arch can be seen the lines of the  original Norman roof. The Norman clerestory was so badly damaged by part  of the tower falling in 1362 that the present clerestory was built in  its place by Bishop Percy (1355-69), the presbytery, at the same time  being covered over with a framed timber roof. In 1463 this (together  with the spire) was struck by lightning, and fell burning into the  presbytery, where it burned itself away. Here and there in the aisles,  and wherever the Norman stonework is visible, traces of an orange  discoloration give evidence of the heat generated by the mass.    The present lierne vault was added by Bishop Goldwell (1472-99), and his  rebus, a gold well, can be seen cut on the bosses at the intersections  of vaulting ribs. The curious junction of the later vault with the  ogee-shaped arches of the clerestory should be noticed.    While the original triforium yet remains, the character of the main  arcade was altered by the insertion of the four-centred \"Perpendicular\"  arches, the work of Bishop Goldwell, whose tomb is under one on the  south side. These lower arches were filled with screens, removed in  1875.    The lower apsidal arches, in the beginning of the century, were  completely filled with imitation Norman work; this has been cleared away  to the original height of the screen wall, with much improvement to the  general effect.    [Illustration: The Choir Stalls at the beginning of the Nineteenth  Century.]    The present altar, designed by Sir A.W. Blomfield, occupies probably the  position of the original altar. The question where the high altar stood  has provoked much speculation. Professor Willis placed it more to the  westward, thinking that a quatrefoiled opening or hagioscope in the  screen wall of the last bay on the north side of the Presbytery (marked  9 on plan) was made to afford a view of it from the aisle. Harrod points  out that there is a small hole in the vault above, from which probably  hung down the light of the sacrament. The position of this hole, and the  fact that such a light would necessarily be placed before the altar, and  not over or behind it, is evidence that the altar was about where it is  now. Blomfield, again, averred that the people stood in the aisle and  confessed to the priest standing in the sanctuary, the \"voice coming  through a hole made in the wall for that purpose,\" the hole being the  hagioscope referred to. But, as Harrod observes, to do this the priest  must have assumed a recumbent position, which is neither convenient nor  usual.    The real use, no doubt, of this bay of the arcade, was for the Easter  sepulchre; its usual position is on the north side of the sanctuary. It  will be noticed also that in the aisle immediately behind is a raised  gallery of Decorated character, access to which was gained from the  sanctuary by steps on the left side of the bay of the arcade, in which  occurs the hagioscope. This gallery formed the ante-chapel to the  #Reliquary Chapel#, which projected northwards from the aisle of the  cathedral; the roof line of this chapel can be seen plainly from the  outside.
