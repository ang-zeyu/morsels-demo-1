(#10)"],[1,"brought me into connection with the  men of learning, and in them I found the similar merits of industry,  intelligence, cheerfulness, frankness, with others peculiar to their  avocation. A very common characteristic of these men, and of the  Hindus especially, was a simplicity truly childish, and a total  unacquaintance with the business and manners of life. Where that  feature was lost, it was chiefly by those who had been long familiar  with Europeans. Among the Pandits or the learned Hindus there  prevailed great ignorance and great dread of the European character.  There is, indeed, very little intercourse between any class of  Europeans and Hindu scholars, and it is not wonderful, therefore, that  mutual misapprehension should prevail.\"    Speaking, lastly, of the higher classes in Calcutta and elsewhere,  Professor Wilson says that he witnessed among them \"polished manners,  clearness and comprehensiveness of understanding, liberality of  feeling, and independence of principle that would have stamped them  gentlemen in any country in the world.\" \"With some of this class,\" he  adds, \"I formed friendships which I trust to enjoy through life.\"    I have often heard Professor Wilson speak in the same, and in even  stronger terms of his old friends in India, and his correspondence  with Ram Comul Sen, the grandfather of Keshub Chunder Sen,[18] a most  orthodox, not to say bigoted, Hindu, which has lately been published,  shows on what intimate terms Englishmen and Hindus may be, if only the  advances are made on the English side.    There is another Professor of Sanskrit, of whom your University may  well be proud, and who could speak on this subject with far greater  authority than I can. He too will tell you, and I have no doubt has  often told you, that if only you look out for friends among the  Hindus, you will find them, and you may trust them.    There is one book which for many years I have been in the habit of  recommending, and another against which I have always been warning  those of the candidates for the Indian Civil Service whom I happened  to see at Oxford; and I believe both the advice and the warning have  in several cases borne the very best fruit. The book which I consider  most mischievous, nay, which I hold responsible for some of the  greatest misfortunes that have happened to India, is Mill's \"History  of British India,\" even with the antidote against its poison, which is  supplied by Professor Wilson's notes. The book which I recommend, and  which I wish might be published again in a cheaper form, so as to  make it more generally accessible, is Colonel Sleeman's \"Rambles and  Recollections of an Indian Official,\" published in 1844, but written  originally in 1835-1836.    Mill's \"History,\" no doubt, you all know, particularly the candidates  for the Indian Civil Service, who, I am sorry to say, are recommended  to read it, and are examined in it. Still, in order to substantiate my  strong condemnation of the book, I shall have to give a few proofs:    Mill in his estimate of the Hindu character is chiefly guided by  Dubois, a French missionary, and by Orme and Buchanan, Tennant, and  Ward, all of them neither very competent nor very unprejudiced judges.  Mill,[19] however, picks out all that is most unfavorable from their  works, and omits the qualifications which even these writers felt  bound to give to their wholesale condemnation of the Hindus. He quotes  as serious, for instance, what was said in joke,[20] namely, that \"a  Brahman is an ant's nest of lies and impostures.\" Next to the charge  of untruthfulness, Mill upbraids the Hindus for what he calls their  litigiousness. He writes:[21] \"As often as courage fails them in  seeking more daring gratification to their hatred and revenge, their  malignity finds a vent in the channel of litigation.\" Without imputing  dishonorable motives, as Mill does, the same fact might be stated in a  different way, by saying, \"As often as their conscience and respect of  law keep them from seeking more daring gratification to their hatred  and revenge, say by murder or poisoning, their trust in English  justice leads them to appeal to our courts of law.\" Dr. Robertson, in  his \"Historical Disquisitions concerning India,\"[22] seems to have  considered the litigious subtlety of the Hindus as a sign of high  civilization rather than of barbarism, but he is sharply corrected by  Mr. Mill, who tells him that \"nowhere is this subtlety carried higher  than among the wildest of the Irish.\" That courts of justice, like the  English, in which a verdict was not to be obtained, as formerly in  Mohammedan courts, by bribes and corruption, should at first have  proved very attractive to the Hindus, need not surprise us. But is it  really true that the Hindus are more fond of litigation than other  nations? If we consult Sir Thomas Munro, the eminent Governor of  Madras, and the powerful advocate of the Ryotwar settlements, he tells  us in so many words:[23] \"I have had ample opportunity of observing  the Hindus in every situation, and I can affirm, that they are not  litigious.\"[24]    But Mill goes further still, and in one place he actually assures his  readers[25] that a \"Brahman may put a man to death when he lists.\" In  fact, he represents the Hindus as such a monstrous mass of all vices,  that, as Colonel Vans Kennedy[26] remarked, society could not have  held together if it had really consisted of such reprobates only. Nor  does he seem to see the full bearing of his remarks. Surely, if a  Brahman might, as he says, put a man to death whenever he lists, it  would be the strongest testimony in their favor that you hardly ever  hear of their availing themselves of such a privilege, to say nothing  of the fact--and a fact it is--that, according to statistics, the  number of capital sentences was one in every 10,000 in England, but  only one in every million in Bengal.[27]    Colonel Sleeman's \"Rambles\" are less known than they deserve to be. To  give you an idea of the man, I must read you some extracts from the  book.    His sketches being originally addressed to his sister, this is how he  writes to her:         \"MY DEAR SISTER: Were any one to ask your countrymen in       India, what had been their greatest source of pleasure while       there, perhaps nine in ten would say the letters which they       receive from their sisters at home.... And while thus       contributing so much to our happiness, they no doubt tend to       make us better citizens of the world and servants of       government than we should otherwise be; for in our       'struggles through life' in India, we have all, more or       less, an eye to the approbation of those circles which our       kind sisters represent, who may therefore be considered in       the exalted light of a valuable species of _unpaid       magistracy_ to the government of India.\"    There is a touch of the old English chivalry even in these few words  addressed to a sister whose approbation he values, and with whom he  hoped to spend the winter of his days. Having been, as he confesses,  idle in answering letters, or rather, too busy to find time for long  letters, he made use of his enforced leisure, while on his way from  the Nerbuddah River to the Himmaleh Mountains, in search of health, to  give to his sister a full account of his impressions and experiences  in India.    Though what he wrote was intended at first \"to interest and amuse his  sister only and the other members of his family at home,\" he adds, in  a more serious tone: \"Of one thing I must beg you to be assured, that  I have nowhere indulged in fiction, either in the narrative, the  recollections, or the conversations. What I relate on the testimony of  others, I believe to be true; and what I relate on my own, you may  rely upon as being so.\"    When placing his volumes before the public at large in 1844, he  expresses a hope that they may \"tend to make the people of India  better understood by those of our countrymen whose destinies are cast  among them, and inspire more kindly feelings toward them.\"    You may ask why I consider Colonel Sleeman so trustworthy an authority  on the Indian character, more trustworthy, for instance, than even so  accurate and unprejudiced an observer as Professor Wilson. My answer  is--because Wilson lived chiefly in Calcutta, while Colonel Sleeman  saw India, where alone the true India can be seen, namely, in the  village-communities. For many years he was employed as Commissioner  for the suppression of Thuggee. The Thugs were professional assassins,  who committed their murders under a kind of religious sanction. They  were originally \"all Mohammedans, but for a long time past Mohammedans  and Hindus had been indiscriminately associated in the gangs, the  former class, however, still predominating.\"[28]    In order to hunt up these gangs, Colonel Sleeman had constantly to  live among the people in the country, to gain their confidence, and to  watch the good as well as the bad features in their character.    Now what Colonel Sleeman continually insists on is that no one knows  the Indians who does not know them in their village-communities--what  we should now call their _communes_. It is that village-life which in  India has given its peculiar impress to the Indian character, more so  than in any other country we know. When in Indian history we hear so  much of kings and emperors, of rajahs and maharajahs, we are apt to  think of India as an Eastern monarchy, ruled by a central power, and  without any trace of that self-government which forms the pride of  England. But those who have most carefully studied the political life  of India tell you the very opposite.    The political unit, or the social cell in India has always been, and, in  spite of repeated foreign conquests, is still the village-community.  Some of these political units will occasionally combine or be combined  for common"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20848"],[0,"An Elementary Study of Chemistry (#10)"],[1,"added to the tube B or withdrawn from it by  means of the stopcock C, until it stands at exactly the same height in  both tubes. The gas inclosed in tube A is then under atmospheric  pressure; and since but a few minutes are required for performing the  experiment, the conditions of temperature and pressure may be regarded  as constant. Hence the volumes of the hydrogen and oxygen and of the  residual gas may be read off from the tube and directly compared.    [Illustration: Fig. 21]    ~Method used by Berzelius and Dumas.~ The method used by these  investigators enables us to determine directly the proportion by weight  in which the hydrogen and oxygen combine. Fig. 22 illustrates the  apparatus used in making this determination. B is a glass tube  containing copper oxide. C and D are glass tubes filled with calcium  chloride, a substance which has great affinity for water. The tubes B  and C, including their contents, are carefully weighed, and the  apparatus connected as shown in the figure. A slow current of pure  hydrogen is then passed through A, and that part of the tube B which  contains copper oxide is carefully heated. The hydrogen combines with  the oxygen present in the copper oxide to form water, which is absorbed  by the calcium chloride in tube C. The calcium chloride in tube D  prevents any moisture entering tube C from the air. The operation is  continued until an appreciable amount of water has been formed. The  tubes B and C are then weighed once more. The loss of weight in the  tube B will exactly equal the weight of oxygen taken up from the  copper oxide in the formation of the water. The gain in weight in the  tube C will exactly equal the weight of the water formed. The  difference in these weights will of course equal the weight of the  hydrogen present in the water formed.    [Illustration: Fig. 22]    ~Dumas' results.~ The above method for the determination of the  composition of water was first used by Berzelius in 1820. The work was  repeated in 1843 by Dumas, the average of whose results is as follows:    Weight of water formed                  236.36 g.  Oxygen given up by the copper oxide     210.04                                          ------  Weight of hydrogen present in water      26.32    According to this experiment the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen in water is  therefore 26.32 to 210.04, or as l to 7.98    ~Morley's results.~ The American chemist Morley has recently determined  the composition of water, extreme precautions being taken to use pure  materials and to eliminate all sources of error. The hydrogen and oxygen  which combined, as well as the water formed, were all accurately  weighed. According to Morley's results, 1 part of hydrogen by weight  combines with 7.94 parts of oxygen to form water.    ~Comparison of results obtained.~ From the above discussions it is easy to  see that it is by experiment alone that the composition of a compound  can be determined. Different methods may lead to slightly different  results. The more accurate the method chosen and the greater the skill  with which the experiment is carried out, the more accurate will be the  results. It is generally conceded by chemists that the results obtained  by Morley in reference to the composition of water are the most accurate  ones. In accordance with these results, then, _water must be regarded as  a compound containing hydrogen and oxygen in the proportion of 1 part by  weight of hydrogen to 7.94 parts by weight of oxygen_.    ~Relation between the volume of aqueous vapor and the volumes of the  hydrogen and oxygen which combine to form it.~ When the quantitative  synthesis of water is carried out in the eudiometer as described above,  the water vapor formed by the union of the hydrogen and oxygen at once  condenses. The volume of the resulting liquid is so small that it may be  disregarded in making the calculations. If, however, the experiment is  carried out at a temperature of 100 deg. or above, the water-vapor formed is  not condensed and it thus becomes possible to compare the volume of the  vapor with the volumes of hydrogen and oxygen which combined to form it.  This can be accomplished by surrounding the arm A of the eudiometer  (Fig. 23) with the tube B through which is passed the vapor obtained  by boiling some liquid which has a boiling point above 100 deg.. In this way  it has been proved that 2 volumes of hydrogen and 1 volume of oxygen  combine to form exactly 2 volumes of water vapor, the volumes all being  measured under the same conditions of temperature and pressure. It will  be noted that the relation between these volumes may be expressed by  whole numbers. The significance of this very important fact will be  discussed in a subsequent chapter.    [Illustration: Fig. 23]    ~Occurrence of water.~ Water not only covers about three fourths of the  surface of the earth, and is present in the atmosphere in the form of  moisture, but it is also a common constituent of the soil and rocks and  of almost every form of animal and vegetable organism. The human body is  nearly 70% water. This is derived not only from the water which we drink  but also from the food which we eat, most of which contains a large  percentage of water. Thus potatoes contain about 78% of water, milk 85%,  beef over 50%, apples 84%, tomatoes 94%.    ~Impurities in water.~ Chemically pure water contains only hydrogen and  oxygen. Such a water never occurs in nature, however, for being a good  solvent, it takes up certain substances from the rocks and soil with  which it comes in contact. When such waters are evaporated these  substances are deposited in the form of a residue. Even rain water,  which is the purest form occurring in nature, contains dust particles  and gases dissolved from the atmosphere. The foreign matter in water is  of two kinds, namely, _mineral_, such as common salt and limestone, and  _organic_, that is the products of animal and vegetable life.         ~Mineral matter in water.~ The amount and nature of the mineral       matter present in different waters vary greatly, depending on       the character of the rocks and soil with which the waters come       in contact. The more common of the substances present are       common salt and compounds of calcium, magnesium, and iron. One       liter of the average river water contains about 175 mg. of       mineral matter. Water from deep wells naturally contains more       mineral matter than river water, generally two or three times       as much, while sea water contains as much as 35,000 mg. to the       liter.    ~Effect of impurities on health.~ The mineral matter in water does not,  save in very exceptional cases, render the water injurious to the human  system. In fact the presence of a certain amount of such matter is  advantageous, supplying the mineral constituents necessary for the  formation of the solid tissues of the body. The presence of organic  matter, on the other hand, must always be regarded with suspicion. This  organic matter may consist not only of the products of animal and  vegetable life but also of certain microscopic forms of living organisms  which are likely to accompany such products. Contagious diseases are  known to be due to the presence in the body of minute living organisms  or germs. Each disease is caused by its own particular kind of germ.  Through sewage these germs may find their way from persons afflicted  with disease into the water supply, and it is principally through the  drinking water that certain of these diseases, especially typhoid fever,  are spread. It becomes of great importance, therefore, to be able to  detect such matter when present in drinking water as well as to devise  methods whereby it can be removed or at least rendered harmless.         ~Analysis of water.~ The mineral analysis of a water is, as the       name suggests, simply the determination of the mineral matter       present. Sanitary analysis, on the other hand, is the       determination of the organic matter present. The physical       properties of a water give no conclusive evidence as to its       purity, since a water may be unfit for drinking purposes and       yet be perfectly clear and odorless. Neither can any reliance       be placed on the simple methods often given for testing the       purity of water. Only the trained chemist can carry out such       methods of analysis as can be relied upon.    [Illustration: Fig. 24]    ~Purification of water.~ Three general methods are used for the  purification of water, namely, _distillation_, _filtration_, and  _boiling_.    1. _Distillation._ The most effective way of purifying natural waters is  by the process of distillation. This consists in boiling the water and  condensing the steam. Fig. 24 illustrates the process of distillation,  as commonly conducted in the laboratory. Ordinary water is poured into  the flask A and boiled. The steam is conducted through the condenser  B, which consists essentially of a narrow glass tube sealed within a  larger one, the space between the two being filled with cold water,  which is admitted at C and escapes at D. The inner tube is thus kept  cool and the steam in passing through it is condensed. The water formed  by the condensation of the steam collects in the receiver E and is  known as _distilled_ water. Such water is practically pure, since the  impurities are nonvolatile and remain in the flask A.         ~Commercial distillation.~ In preparing distilled water on a       large scale, the steam is generated in a boiler or other metal       container and condensed by passing it through a pipe made of       metal, generally tin. This pipe is wound into a spiral and is       surrounded by a current of cold water. Distilled water is used       by the chemist in almost all of his work. It is also used in       the manufacture of artificial ice and for drinking water.         ~Fractional distillation.~ In preparing"]]]
