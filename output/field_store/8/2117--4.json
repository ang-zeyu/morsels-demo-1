[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21840"],[0,"Woman (#10)"],[1,"    In many girls and women menstruation is a perfectly normal,  physiological process. They suffer no discomfort whatever from it.  They suffer no pains, no headache, no irritability, they have no  admonition of its onset, until they feel the blood oozing or trickling  out. But, unfortunately, this is true only of a small percentage. The  majority of women have some unpleasant symptoms. Some have a headache  for a day or two, some complain of a dragging down sensation, some are  irritable, feel depressed or quarrelsome; some have no appetite, no  ambition, no desire for work or company, while some girls have such  severe pains and cramps that they are obliged to go to bed for a day  or two and call in medical aid.    When the menstruation is very profuse, resembling more a hemorrhage  than normal menstruation, it is called _menorrhagia_; if the  hemorrhage from the uterus occurs out of the regular menstrual  periods, it is called _metrorrhagia_. When the menses are skipped, or  when they are so scanty that you can hardly notice any blood, we use  the term _amenorrhea_. In a few rare cases the menstruation instead of  coming normally from the uterus, comes from some other part of the  body, for instance, the nose. Some women have a hemorrhage from the  nose every month. In some a bloody discharge may come from the  breasts. To such a substitute menstruation we apply the term  _vicarious menstruation_. Such cases, however, are rare, and are mere  curiosities.    =Dysmenorrhea.= I mentioned before that in some girls and women the  menses are accompanied by pains and cramps. This affliction, which is  the lot of millions of women, and from which men are entirely free, is  called _dysmenorrhea_. Dysmenorrhea means painful and difficult  menstruation. A slight pain or at least a feeling of discomfort is  present in most cases of menstruation. But in many cases the pain is  so severe, so _excruciating_, that the sufferer, girl or woman, is  incapacitated for any work, and must go to bed for a day or two. In  some cases the pain is so severe as to necessitate the use of  morphine, and as it is a very bad thing to have to give morphine every  three or four weeks, every endeavor should be made to find out the  cause of the trouble and to remove it. It is a mistake, however, to  think that all or even most cases of dysmenorrhea are due to some  local trouble, that is, to an inflammation of the ovaries, or a  displacement of the womb. Many cases of dysmenorrhea are of _nervous_  origin; the cause resides in the central nervous system, and not in  the genital organs themselves. It is, therefore, not advisable to  undertake any local treatment, unless a competent physician has made a  thorough examination and has decided that local treatment is  advisable.    As to the percentage of dysmenorrhea, a recent statistical examination  of 4,000 women showed that dysmenorrhea of some degree was present in  over one-half, namely, 52 per cent.          CHAPTER EIGHT    THE HYGIENE OF MENSTRUATION     Lack of Cleanliness During Menstrual Period--Superstitious    Beliefs--Hygiene of Menstruation.      The hygiene of menstruation can be expressed in two words: cleanliness  and rest. Common sense would suggest these two measures, and as far as  rest is concerned, many women do rest or take it easy while they are  unwell. Some are forced to do it, because, if they don't, their  dysmenorrhea is worse and the amount of blood they lose is  considerably increased. The same cannot be said of cleanliness. Due  undoubtedly to the superstitious opinions about menstruation, which  came over to us from the ages-of-long-ago, menstruation is still  considered a _noli-me-tangere_, and women are afraid to bathe, to  douche or even to wash during the periods. And if there is any period  when a woman needs a douche it is during menstruation. Any leucorrhea  that a woman may be suffering from becomes aggravated around the  periods; the menstrual blood of some women has a decided odor, and if  no cleansing douche is taken during four or five days, some of the  blood decomposes and acquires a decidedly offensive odor, which can be  noticed at some distance and to which some men and women are very  susceptible. There are some women who never take a vaginal douche.  Some consider it a useless and unnecessary luxury; while some orthodox  puritanical women consider it an ungodly procedure (forgetting that  cleanliness is next to godliness) fit only for women of gay and  questionable character. If these orthodox women knew what was good for  them--and for their health--they would take a douche at least during  menstruation, if at no other time.    =Cleanliness.= When the girl reaches the age of twelve or thirteen the  mother should explain to her the phenomenon of menstruation and the  likelihood of its making its appearance in a short time. Of course she  should be told that there is nothing shameful in it, that when it  makes its appearance she should at once tell her mother, who will  instruct her what to do. She should be shown the use of sanitary  napkins. Rags, unless recently washed and kept wrapped up and  protected from dust, should not be used. Unclean rags may lead to  infection. I have no doubt that many cases of leucorrhea date back  their origin to unwashed rags. Every morning and every evening the  girl should wash the external genitals with warm water, or plain soap  and water. Married women should also take a douche once a day--the  douche may consist of two quarts of water in which has been dissolved  a teaspoonful of common table salt, or a tablespoonful of borax or  boric acid. Such things like alum, potassium permanganate, carbolic  acid, lactic acid, or tincture of iodine should only be used when  there is leucorrhea present and generally only under a physician's  directions. Bathing is permissible, but it is safe to use only a  lukewarm bath. Cold tub baths, cold shower baths, as well as ocean and  river bathing are best avoided during the period; at least during the  first two days. I do not give this as an absolute rule; I know women  who bathe and swim in the ocean during their menstrual periods without  any injury to themselves, but they are exceptionally robust women;  advice in books is for the average person, and it is always best to be  on the safe side.    =Rest.= Rest is just as important during menstruation as cleanliness,  if not more so. Some women as mentioned before feel during their  menses just as well as they do at other times, and do not need any  special hygiene. But these are in the minority. Most girls and women  do feel somewhat below par during that period, and it is very  important that they take it easy, particularly during the first two  days. It is an outrage that many delicate, weak girls and women must  stay on their feet all day or work on a machine when they should be at  home in bed or lying down on a couch.    The womb is congested during the period, is larger and heavier than  normal, and it is then that there is often laid the foundation for  some future uterine disease, the well-known \"womb trouble,\" or \"female  disease.\" It is not necessary that work be given up altogether, but  there certainly should be less of it and there should be as much rest  as possible. For delicate and sensitive girls it is always best to  stay away from school during the first and second days. Speaking again  of the average and not the exception, it is best that dancing, bicycle  riding, horseback riding, rowing, and other athletic exercises be  given up altogether during the menses. Automobile riding and railroad  and carriage travelling prove injurious in some instances, greatly  increasing the flow of blood. But these are the exceptions at the  other extreme.

Fecundation and fertilization are important terms to remember. They  stand for the most important phenomenon in the living world. Without  it there would be no plants and no animals, excepting a few very low  forms of no importance, and of course no human beings.    =Fecundation= or fertilization is the process of union of the female  germ cell with the male germ cell; speaking of animals, it is the  process of union of the egg or ovum of the female with the  spermatozooen of the male. When a successful union of these two cells  takes place a new being is started. The process of fertilization or  fecundation is also known as impregnation and conception. We say, to  fertilize (chiefly, however, when speaking of plants) or to fecundate  an ovum, or to impregnate a female or woman, and to conceive a child.  We say the woman has become impregnated or has conceived.    _The Process._ The process of fecundation is briefly as follows. An  ovum becomes mature, breaks through its Graafian follicle in the ovary  and is set free. It is caught by the fimbriated or trumpet-shaped  extremity of the Fallopian tube and, moved by the wave-like motion of  the cilia[4] of the lining of the tube, it begins its travel towards  the uterus. If no sexual intercourse has taken place nothing happens.  The ovum dries up, or \"dies,\" and either remains somewhere in the tube  or womb or is removed from the latter with the menstruation, or mucous  discharge. But if intercourse has taken place, thousands and thousands  of the male germ cells or spermatozoa enter the uterus through its  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21880"],[0,"The Medallic History of the United States of America 1776-1876 (#10)"],[1,"Gentlemen of the Royal Academy, of which the Exhibition has been       ordered, according to the intention of His Majesty, by the Count       de la Billarderie d'Angeviller, Councillor of the King in His       Councils, Master-of-Camp of Cavalry, Knight of the Royal and       Military Order of Saint Louis, Commander of the Order of Saint       Lazare, Governor of Rambouillet, Director and Ordonnator-General       of His Majesty's Buildings, Gardens, Arts, and Royal Academies       and Manufactures; of the Royal Academy of Sciences.

William L. DAYTON,            Minister of the United States at the Court of France.         Dear Sir: During the Revolutionary War, medals were awarded by       resolution of the Continental Congress to certain officers who       commanded the American forces in the principal conflicts with the       enemy, or participated therein. The dies for these medals were       prepared in Paris, and the medals produced there. Several of the       dies in question are understood to be in the possession of the       Mint of Medals at Paris. As we have recently prepared, for (p. xlviii)       distribution, bronze medals from the national medal dies in our       country, it would be very gratifying if the American medal dies,       at the French Mint, could be procured and the series made complete.       The medals that were prepared for us in Paris are interesting       memorials of some of the most remarkable events in our history,       and the appropriate place for the dies would appear to be in       the National Mint of the United States.         May I request the favor of you to ascertain, from the proper       official source, what medal dies, relating to events connected       with the history of the United States, are at the mint in Paris,       and whether the same can be obtained. If not, I should be glad to       have, say twenty copies in bronze, struck from the dies, provided       the expense would not be too great.         Inclosed I send you a list of the medals recently struck in       bronze from the dies of a public character in our possession. It       will be seen that it is deficient in medals of the Revolutionary       era.         The following American medal dies are believed to be at the French       Mint of Medals:              Washington before Boston.            General Wayne, for capture of Stony Point.            Colonel Fleury, for same.            Captain Stewart, for same.            Major Lee, for capture of Paulus Hook.            Colonel John Eager Howard, for Cowpens.            Colonel William Washington, for same.            Major General Greene, for Eutaw Springs.            Captain John Paul Jones, for capture of the Serapis by the                    Bonhomme Richard.        Your attention to the request contained herein will greatly      oblige,                   Your friend and obedient servant,                                            James POLLOCK,                                                  Director of the Mint.

Monsieur le Ministre: I have received from the Director of the       Mint of the United States a letter (of which I annex a copy),       calling me to procure a certain series of medals prepared in       Paris to commemorate certain events in the history of the       American Revolution.         These dies having been prepared in Paris, and the medals struck       here, it is supposed the former yet remain in some safe       depository.         If it is possible to procure the original dies, I am requested to       do so; if that be not possible, I should be happy to learn if I       can procure copies.         I avail myself of the occasion to renew to Your Excellency the       assurance of the high consideration with which I have the honor       to be,                            Your obedient servant,                                            W.

Monsieur: Par la lettre que vous m'avez fait l'honneur de       m'adresser le 10 decembre dernier, vous m'exprimiez le desir       d'etre mis en possession des coins d'un certain nombre de       medailles commemoratives d'evenements de la guerre de       l'Independance qui ont ete frappees a Paris. Monsieur le Ministre       des Finances a qui j'avais du ecrire a ce sujet, me repond que le       Musee Monetaire ne possede les coins que de quatre de ces       medailles. La prise de Boston, la prise de Serapis, bataille de       Cowpens--Washington, et bataille de Cowpens--Howard. Le musee ne       pourrait se dessaisir de ces coins, mais il serait facile,       moyennant une legere depense, de faire frapper de nouveaux       exemplaires; il faudrait seulement, si la proposition etait agree       par le gouvernement Federal, que vous me fissiez parvenir       l'indication precise du nombre d'exemplaires de chacune de ces       medailles qu'il desirerait obtenir.         Agreez les assurances de la haute consideration avec laquelle       j'ai l'honneur d'etre,                      Monsieur,                        Votre tres humble et tres obeissant serviteur,       Pour le ministre et par autorisation,                                Le Ministre Plenipotentiaire Directeur,                                                             BANNEVILLE.

Sir: By the letter which you did me the honor to address to me on       the 10th of December last, you expressed to me the desire to       obtain the dies of a certain number of medals, commemorative of       events of the War of Independence, which were struck in Paris.       The Minister of Finance, to whom I had to write on the subject,       replies that the Museum of the Mint possesses the dies of only       four of these medals: the taking of Boston, the capture of the       Serapis, the battle of the Cowpens--Washington, and the battle of       the Cowpens--Howard. The museum cannot part with these dies, but       it will be easy, at a small outlay, to have new copies struck; it       will only be necessary, if the proposition is accepted by the       Federal Government, for you to indicate to me the precise number       of copies of each of these medals which it wishes to obtain.         Receive the assurances of the high consideration with which I       have the honor to be,                            Sir,               Your very humble and very obedient servant,       For the minister and by authorization,                        The Minister Plenipotentiary Director,                                                     BANNEVILLE.

Monsieur Le Ministre: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt       of your letter of the 17th instant in reference to the American       medal dies. I avail myself of your kind offer to have copies       struck from the original dies.         Be pleased to direct that twenty copies in bronze be struck     (p. l)       from such dies, with a diameter of two and one half inches. The       expense will be met by this Legation immediately upon notice.         I avail myself of the opportunity to assure Your Excellency of       the high consideration with which I am,                                         Your humble servant,                                                     W.
