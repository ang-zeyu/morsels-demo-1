Cultivate every  germ of true moral principle in your own homes, and in the social  circle about you.

What heathen civilization means we know from many sources, more  especially from the records of Rome under the empire, in the days of  St. Paul, when it had reached its highest development.    What Christian civilization means we learn from the Apostle: \"Let him  that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.\" \"Whatsoever  things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are  just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely,  whatsoever things are of good report--think on these things.\""]]]
