She receives his  innuendos without resentment, and treats him with sincerity and  forbearance (see act i. 2).--Sheridan, _The Rivals_ (1775).      =Melyhalt= (_The Lady_), a powerful subject of King Arthur, whose domains  Sir Galiot invaded; notwithstanding which the lady chose Sir Galiot as  her fancy knight and chevalier.      =Memnon=, king of the Ethiopians. He went to the assistance of his uncle,  Priam, and was slain by Achill[^e]s. His mother, Eos, inconsolable at his  death, weeps for him every morning, and her tears constitute what we  call dew.    _Memnon_, the black statue of King Amen'ophis III., at Thebes, in Egypt,  which, being struck with the rays of the morning sun, gives out musical  sounds. Kircher says these sounds are due to a sort of clavecin or  AEolian harp enclosed in the statue, the cords of which are acted upon by  the warmth of the sun. Cambyses, resolved to learn the secret, cleft the  statue from head to waist; but it continued to utter its morning melody  notwithstanding.    _Memnon_, \"the mad lover,\" general of As'torax, king of  Paphos.--Beaumont and Fletcher, _The Mad Lover_ (1617).    _Memnon_, the title of a novel by Voltaire, the object of which is to  show the folly of aspiring to too much wisdom.      =Memnon's Sister.= He'mera, mentioned by Dictys Cretensis.        Black, but such as in esteem      Prince Memnon's sister might beseem.        Milton, _Il Penseroso_ (1638).      =Memorable= (_The Ever-_), John Hales, of Eton (1584-1656).      =Memory.= The persons most noted for their memory are:    Magliabecchi, of Florence, called \"The Universal Index and Living  Cyclopaedia\" (1633-1714).    P. J. Beronicius, the Greek and Latin improvisator, who knew by heart  Horace, Virgil, Cicero, Juvenal, both the Plinys, Homer, and  Aristoph[)a]n[^e]s. He died at Middleburgh, in 1676.    Andrew Fuller, after hearing 500 lines twice, could repeat them without  a mistake. He could also repeat verbatim a sermon or speech; could tell  either backwards or forwards every shop sign from the Temple to the  extreme end of Cheapside, and the articles displayed in each of the  shops.    \"Memory\" Woodfall could carry in his head a debate, and repeat it a  fortnight afterwards.    \"Memory\" Thompson could repeat the names, trades, and particulars of  every shop from Ludgate Hill to Piccadilly.    William Ratcliff, the husband of the novelist, could repeat a debate the  next morning.    _Memory_ (_The Bard of_), Samuel Rogers, author of the _Pleasures of  Memory_ (1762-1855).      =Men of Prester John's Country.= Prester John, in his letter to Manuel  Comn[=e]nus, says his land is the home of men with horns; of one-eyed  men (the eye being in some cases before the head, and in some cases  behind it); of giants, forty ells in height (_i.e._ 120 feet); of the  phoenix, etc.; and of ghouls who feed on premature children. He gives  the names of fifteen different tributary states, amongst which are those  of Gog and Magog (now shut in behind lofty mountains); but at the end of  the world these fifteen states will overrun the whole earth.      =Menalcas=, any shepherd or rustic. The name occurs in the _Idylls_ of  Theoc'ritos, the _Eclogues_ of Virgil, and the _Shepheardes Calendar_ of  Spenser.      =Men'cia of Mosquera= (_Donna_) married Don Alvaro de Mello. A few days  after the marriage, Alvaro happened to quarrel with Don An'drea de Baesa  and kill him. He was obliged to flee from Spain, leaving his bride  behind, and his property was confiscated. For seven years she received  no intelligence of his whereabouts (for he was a slave most of the  time), but when seven years had elapsed the report of his death in Fez  reached her. The young widow now married the marquis of Guardia, who  lived in a grand castle near Burgos, but walking in the grounds one  morning she was struck with the earnestness with which one of the  under-gardeners looked at her. This man proved to be her first husband,  Don Alvaro, with whom she now fled from the castle; but on the road a  gang of robbers fell upon them. Alvaro was killed, and the lady taken to  the robbers' cave, where Gil Blas saw her and heard her sad tale. The  lady was soon released, and sent to the castle of the marquis of  Guardia. She found the marquis dying from grief, and indeed he died the  day following, and Mencia retired to a convent.--Lesage, _Gil Blas_, i.  11-14 (1715).      =Mendo'za=, a Jew prize-fighter, who held the belt at the close of the  last century, and in 1791 opened the Lyceum in the Strand, to teach \"the  noble art of self-defence.\"         I would have dealt the fellow that abused you such a recompense in       the fifth button, that my friend Mendoza could not have placed it       better.--R. Cumberland, _Shiva, the Jew_, iv. 2 (1776).         There is a print often seen in old picture shops, of Humphreys and       Mendoza sparring, and a queer angular exhibition it is. What that       is to the modern art of boxing, Quick's style of acting was to       Dowton's.--_Records of a Stage Veteran._    _Mendoza_ (_Isaac_), a rich Jew, who thinks himself monstrously wise,  but is duped by every one. (See under ISAAC.)--Sheridan, _The Duenna_  (1775).      =Menech'mians=, persons exactly like each other, as the brothers Dromio.  So called from the Mencoechmi of Plautus.      =Menec'rates= (4 _syl._), a physician of Syracuse, of unbounded vanity  and arrogance. He assumed to himself the title of Jupiter, and in a  letter to Philip, king of Macedon, began thus: \"Menecrat[^e]s Jupiter to  King Philip, greeting.\" Being asked by Philip to a banquet, the  physician was served only with frankincense, like the gods; but  Menecrat[^e]s was greatly offended, and hurried home.      =Mengs= (_John_), the surly innkeeper at Kirchhoff village.--Sir W. Scott,  _Anne of Geierstein_ (time, Edward IV.).      =Menippee= (_Satyre_), a famous political satire, written during the  time of what is called in French History the Holy League, the objects of  which were to exterminate the Huguenots, to confine the king (Henri  III.) in a monastery, and to crown the duc de Guise. The satire is  partly in verse, and partly in prose, and its object is to expose the  perfidious intentions of Philip of Spain and the culpable ambition of  the Guises.    It is divided into two parts, the first of which is entitled _Catholicon  d'Espagne_, by Pierre Leroy (1593), exposing those who had been  corrupted by the gold of Spain; the second part is entitled  _Abr['e]g['e] des Etats de la Ligue_, by Gillot, Pithou, Rapin and  Passerat, published 1594.    [Asterism] Menippus was a cynic philosopher and poet of Gadara, in  Phoenicia, who wrote twelve books of satires in prose and verse.    Varro wrote in Latin a work called _The Satires of Menippus_ (_Satyrae  Menippeae_).      =Mennibojou=, a North American Indian deity.      =Mentz= (_Baron von_), a Heidelberg bully, whose humiliation at the hands  of the fellow-student he has insulted is the theme of an exciting  chapter in Theodore S. Fay's novel, _Norman Leslie_ (1835).      =Menteith= (_the earl of_), a kinsman of the earl of Montrose.--Sir W.  Scott, _Legend of Montrose_ (time, Charles I.).      =Mentor=, a wise and faithful adviser or guide. So called from Mentor, a  friend of Ulyss[^e]s, whose form Minerva assumed when she accompanied  Telemachus in his search for his father.--F['e]nelon, _T['e]l['e]maque_  (1700).      =Mephistoph'eles= (5 _syl._), the sneering, jeering, leering attendant  demon of Faust in Goethe's drama of _Faust_, and Gounod's opera of the  same name. Marlowe calls the name \"Mephostophilis\" in his drama entitled  _Dr. Faustus_. Shakespeare, in his _Merry Wives of Windsor_ writes the  name \"Mephostophilus;\" and in the opera he is called \"Mefistofele\" (5  _syl._). In the old demonology, Mephistophel[^e]s was one of the seven  chief devils, and second of the fallen archangels.      =Mephostophilis=, the attendant demon of Faustus, in Marlowe's tragedy of  _Dr. Faustus_ (1589).         There is an awful melancholy about Marlowe's \"Mephostophilis,\"       perhaps more expressive than the malignant mirth of that fiend in       the renowned work of Goethe.--Hallam.      =Mephostophilus=, the spirit or familiar of Sir John Faustus or [Dr.] John  Faust (Shakespeare, _Merry Wives of Windsor_, 1596). Subsequently it  became a term of reproach, about equal to \"imp of the devil.\"      =Mercedes=, Spanish woman, who, to disarm suspicion, drinks the wine  poisoned for the French soldiery who have invaded the town. She is  forced to let her baby drink it, also, and gives no sign of perturbation  until the invaders, twenty in number, have partaken of the wine, and the  baby grows livid and expires before their eyes.--Thomas Bailey Aldrich,  _Mercedes_ (drama, 1883).      =Mercer= (_Major_), at the presidency of Madras.--Sir W. Scott, _The  Surgeon's Daughter_ (time, George II.).      =Merchant of Venice= (_The_), Antonio, who borrowed 3000 ducats for three  months of Shylock, a Jew. The money was borrowed to lend to a friend  named Bassanio, and the Jew, \"in merry sport,\" instead of interest,  agreed to lend the money on these conditions: If Antonio paid it within  three months, he should pay only the principal; if he did not pay it  back within that time, the merchant should forfeit a pound of his own  flesh, from any part of his body the Jew might choose to cut it off. As  Antonio's ships were delayed by contrary winds, he could not pay the  money, and the Jew demanded the forfeiture. On the trial which ensued,  Portia, in the dress of a law doctor, conducted the case, and, when the  Jew was going to take the forfeiture, stopped him by saying that the  bond stated \"a pound of flesh,\" and that, therefore, he was to shed no  drop of blood, and he must cut neither more nor less than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20877"],[0,"Mother West Wind's Children (#10)"],[1,"oose.  Pretty soon Reddy Fox began to think of nothing but getting  away.  Every one was shouting for Johnny Chuck.  Every time Reddy Fox  was underneath, he would hear a great shout from all the little meadow  people, and he knew that they were glad.    Now Johnny Chuck was round and fat and rolly-poly, and when one is  round and fat and rolly-poly, one's breath is apt to be short.  So it  was with Johnny Chuck.  He had fought so hard that his breath was  nearly gone.  Finally he loosed his hold on Reddy Fox for just a second  to draw in a good breath.  Reddy Fox saw his chance, and, with a quick  pull and spring, he broke away.    How all the little meadow people did scatter!  You see they were very  brave, very brave indeed, so long as Johnny Chuck had Reddy Fox down,  but now that Reddy Fox was free, each one was suddenly afraid and  thought only of himself.  Jimmy Skunk knocked Jerry Muskrat flat in his  hurry to get away.  Billy Mink trod on Great-Grandfather Frog's big  feet and didn't even say \"Excuse me.\"  Striped Chipmunk ran head first  into a big thistle and squealed as much from fear as pain.    But Reddy Fox paid no attention to any of them.  He just wanted to get  away, and off he started, limping as fast as he could go up the Lone  Little Path.  Such a looking sight!  His beautiful red coat was in  tatters.  His face was scratched.  He hobbled as he ran.  And just as  he broke away, Johnny Chuck made a grab and pulled a great mouthful of  hair out of the splendid tail Reddy Fox was so proud of.    When the little meadow people saw that Reddy Fox was actually running  away, they stopped running themselves, and all began to shout: \"Reddy  Fox is a coward and a bully!  Coward!  Coward!\"  Then they crowded  around Johnny Chuck and all began talking at once about his great fight.    Just then they heard a great noise up on the hill.  They saw Reddy Fox  coming back down the Lone Little Path, and he was using his legs just  as well as he knew how.  Right behind him, his great mouth open and  waking all the echoes with his big voice, was Bowser the Hound.    You see, although Peter Rabbit couldn't fight for his little baby  brother and is usually very, very timid, he isn't altogether a coward.  Indeed, he had been very brave, very brave indeed.  He had gone up to  Farmer Brown's and had jumped right under the nose of Bowser the Hound.  Now that is something that Bowser the Hound never can stand.  So off he  had started after Peter Rabbit.  And Peter Rabbit had started back for  the Green Meadows as fast as his long legs could take him, for he knew  that if once Bowser the Hound caught sight of Reddy Fox, he would  forget all about such a little thing as a saucy rabbit.    Sure enough, half way down the Lone Little Path they met Reddy Fox  sneaking off home, and, when Bowser the Hound saw him, he straightway  forgot all about Peter Rabbit, and, with a great roar, started after  Reddy Fox.    When Johnny Chuck had carefully brushed his coat and all the little  meadow people had wished him good luck, he started off up the Lone  Little Path for home, the Merry Little Breezes dancing ahead and Peter  Rabbit coming lipperty, lipperty, lip behind, and right between them  hopped Peter Rabbit's little brother, who thought Johnny Chuck the  greatest hero in the world.    When they reached Johnny Chuck's old home, Peter Rabbit and Peter  Rabbit's little brother tried to tell him how thankful they were to  him, but Johnny Chuck just laughed and said: \"It was nothing at all,  just nothing at all.\"    When at last all had gone, even the Merry Little Breezes, Johnny Chuck  slipped away to his new home, which is his secret, you know, which no  one knows but jolly, round, red Mr. Sun, who won't tell.    \"I hope,\" said Johnny Chuck, as he stretched himself out on the mound  of warm sand by his doorway, for he was very tired, \"I hope,\" said  Johnny Chuck, sighing contentedly, \"that Reddy Fox got away from Bowser  the Hound!\"    And Reddy Fox did.          IX    MR. TOAD'S OLD SUIT    Peter Rabbit was tired and very sleepy as he hopped along the Crooked  Little Path down the hill.  He could see Old Mother West Wind just  emptying her Merry Little Breezes out of her big bag onto the Green  Meadows to play all the bright summer day.  Peter Rabbit yawned and  yawned again as he watched them dance over to the Smiling Pool.  Then  he hopped on down the Crooked Little Path towards home.    Sammy Jay, sitting on a fence post, saw him coming.      \"Peter Rabbit out all night!    Oh my goodness what a sight!    Peter Rabbit, reprobate!    No good end will be your fate!\"    shouted Sammy Jay.    Peter Rabbit ran out his tongue at Sammy Jay.    \"Who stole Happy Jack's nuts?  Thief!  Thief!  Thief!\" shouted Peter  Rabbit at Sammy Jay, and kept on down the Crooked Little Path.    It was true--Peter Rabbit had been out all night playing in the  moonlight, stealing a midnight feast in Farmer Brown's cabbage patch  and getting into mischief with Bobby Coon.  Now when most of the little  meadow people were just waking up Peter Rabbit was thinking of bed.    Presently he came to a big piece of bark which is the roof of Mr.  Toad's house.  Mr. Toad was sitting in his doorway blinking at jolly,  round, red Mr. Sun, who had just begun to climb up the sky.    \"Good morning, Mr. Toad,\" said Peter Rabbit.    \"Good morning,\" said Mr. Toad.    \"You're looking very fine this morning, Mr. Toad,\" said Peter Rabbit.    \"I'm feeling very fine this morning,\" said Mr. Toad.    \"Why, my gracious, you have on a new suit, Mr. Toad!\" exclaimed Peter  Rabbit.    \"Well, what if I have, Peter Rabbit?\" demanded Mr. Toad.    \"Oh, nothing, nothing, nothing at all, Mr. Toad, nothing at all,\" said  Peter Rabbit hastily, \"only I didn't know you ever had a new suit.  What have you done with your old suit, Mr. Toad?\"    \"Swallowed it,\" said Mr. Toad shortly, turning his back on Peter Rabbit.    And that was all Peter Rabbit could get out of Mr. Toad, so he started  on down the Crooked Little Path.  Now Peter Rabbit has a great deal of  curiosity and is forever poking into other people's affairs.  The more  he thought about it the more he wondered what Mr. Toad could have done  with his old suit.  Of course he hadn't _swallowed_ it!  Who ever heard  of such a thing!  The more he thought of it the more Peter Rabbit felt  that he must know what Mr. Toad had done with his old suit.  By this  time he had forgotten that he had been out all night.  He had forgotten  that he was sleepy.  He had got to find out about Mr. Toad's old suit.    \"I'll just run over to the Smiling Pool and ask Grandfather Frog.  He'll surely know what Mr. Toad does with his old suits,\" said Peter  Rabbit, and began to hop faster.    When he reached the Smiling Pool there sat Great-Grandfather Frog on  his big green lily pad as usual.  There was a hungry look in his big  goggly eyes, for it was so early that no foolish, green flies had come  his way yet.  But Peter Rabbit was too full of curiosity in Mr. Toad's  affairs to notice this.    \"Good morning, Grandfather Frog,\" said Peter Rabbit.    \"Good morning,\" replied Grandfather Frog a wee bit gruffly.    \"You're looking very fine this morning, Grandfather Frog,\" said Peter  Rabbit.    \"Not so fine as I'd feel if I had a few fat, foolish, green flies,\"  said Grandfather Frog.    \"I've just met your cousin, Mr. Toad, and he has on a new suit,\" said  Peter Rabbit.    \"Indeed!\" replied Grandfather Frog.  \"Well, I think it's high time.\"    \"What does Mr. Toad do with his old suit, Grandfather Frog?\" asked  Peter Rabbit.    \"Chug-a-rum!  It's none of my business.  Maybe he swallows it,\" replied  Grandfather Frog crossly, and turned his back on Peter Rabbit.    Peter Rabbit saw that his curiosity must remain unsatisfied.  He  suddenly remembered that he had been out all night and was very, very  sleepy, so he started off home across the Green Meadows.    Now the Merry Little Breezes had heard all that Peter Rabbit and  Grandfather Frog had said, and they made up their minds that they would  find out from Grandfather Frog what Mr. Toad really did do with his old  suit.  First of all they scattered over the Green Meadows.  Presently  back they all came, each blowing ahead of him a fat, foolish, green  fly.  Right over to the big green lily pad they blew the green flies.    \"Chug-a-rum!  Chug-a-rum!  Chug-a-rum!\" said Grandfather Frog, as each  fat, foolish, green fly disappeared inside his white and yellow  waistcoat.  When the last one was out of sight, all but a leg which was  left sticking out of a corner of Grandfather Frog's big mouth, one of  the Merry Little Breezes ventured to ask him what became of Mr. Toad's  old suit.    Grandfather Frog settled himself comfortably on the big green lily pad  and folded his hands across his white and yellow waistcoat.    \"Chug-a-rum,\" began Grandfather Frog.  \"Once upon a time--\"    The Merry Little Breezes clapped their hands and settled themselves  among the buttercups and daisies, for they knew that soon they would  know what Mr. Toad did with his old suit.    \"Once upon a time,\" began Grandfather Frog again, \"when the world was  young, old King Bear received word that old Mother Nature would visit  the Green Meadows and the Green Forest.  Of course old King Bear wanted  his kingdom and his subjects to look their very best, so he issued a  royal order that every one of the little meadow people and every one of  the little forest folk should wear a new suit on the day that old  Mother Nature was to pay her visit.    \"Now like old King Bear, every one wanted to appear his very best  before old Mother Nature, but as no one knew the exact day she was to  come, every one began at once to wear his best suit, and to take the  greatest care of it.  Old King Bear appeared every day in a suit of  glossy black.  Lightfoot the Deer, threw away his dingy gray suit, and  put on a coat of beautiful red and fawn.  Mr. Mink,"]]]
