[Illustration: p129-140]    [Illustration: p130-141]    [Illustration: p133-144]          BOHEMIA AT HOME.    I hardly fancy it would be possible to find in the whole of Paris, a  more lively and peculiar house than that of the sculptor Simaise. Life  there is one continual round of festivities. At whatever hour you drop  in upon them, a sound of singing and laughter, or the jingle of a piano,  guitar, or tamtam greets you. You can never enter the studio without  finding a waltz going on, or a set of quadrilles, or a game of  battledore and shuttlecock, or else it is cumbered with all the litter  and preparations for a ball; shreds of tulle and ribbons lying scattered  among the sculptor's chisels; artificial flowers hanging over the busts,  and spangled skirts spreading over groups of moist clay.    [Illustration: p134-145]    The fact is that four big t daughters of sixteen to twenty-five years  of age, all very pretty indeed, take up a great deal of room; and when  these young ladies whirl round with their hair streaming down their  backs, with floating ribbons, long pins, and showy ornaments, it really  seems as if instead of four there were eight, sixteen, thirty-two Misses  Simaise, as dashing the one as the other, talking and laughing loudly,  with the hoydenish manner peculiar to artists' daughters, with the  studio jests, the familiarity of students, and knowing also better than  anyone how to dismiss a creditor or blow up a tradesman impertinent  enough to present his bill at an inopportune moment.    [Illustration: p135-146]    These young damsels are the real mistresses of the house. From early  dawn the father works, chisels, models unceasingly, for he has no  settled income. At first he was ambitious and strove to do good work;  some early successful exhibitions promised him future fame; but the  necessity of providing for the support of his family, the clothing,  feeding and future establishment of his children, threw him back  into the ordinary work of the trade. As for Madame Simaise, she never  attended to anything.    Very handsome when she married, very much admired in the artistic world  into which her husband introduced her, at first satisfied with being  only a pretty woman, later on she resigned herself to the part of a  woman who had been pretty. A creole by birth, at least such was her  pretension--although it was asserted that her parents had never left  Courbevoie,--she spent the days from morning to night in a hammock swung  up in turn in all the different rooms of the house, fanning herself and  taking siestas, full of contempt for the material details of everyday  life. She had so often sat to her husband as model for Hebes and Dianas,  that she fancied her only duty was to pass through life carrying some  emblem of a goddess, such as a crescent on her head or a goblet in her  hand. Indeed the disorder of the establishment was a sight in itself.  The least thing necessitated a full hour's search.    \"Have you seen my thimble? Marthe, Eva, Genevieve, Madeleine, who has  seen my thimble?\"    The drawers, in which books, powder, rouge, spangles, spoons and fans  are tossed at haphazard, though crammed full, contain absolutely nothing  useful; moreover they belong to strange pieces of furniture, curious,  battered and incomplete. And how peculiar is the house itself! As they  are constantly changing their residence, they never have time to settle  anywhere, and this merry household seems to be perpetually awaiting the  setting to rights indispensable after a ball. Only so many things are  lacking, that it is not worth while settling, and as long as they can  put on a bit of finery, display themselves out of doors with something  of a meteor flash, a semblance of style and appearance of luxury, honour  is saved! Encampment does not in any way distress this migratory tribe.  Through the half-opened doors, their poverty is betrayed by the four  bare walls of an unfurnished chamber, or the litter of an overcrowded  room. It is bohemianism in the domestic circle, a life full of  improvidence and surprises.    At the very moment when they sit down to table, they suddenly perceive  that everything is wanting, and that the breakfast must be sent out for  at once. In this manner hours are spent rapidly, bustling and idling,  and herein lies a certain advantage. After a late breakfast, one does  not need to dine, but can sup at the ball, which fills up nearly every  evening. These ladies also give evening parties. Tea is drunk out of  all kinds of queer receptacles, goblets, old tankards, ancient glasses,  Japanese shells, the whole chipped and cracked by the constant moves.    [Illustration: p138-149]    The serene calm of both mother and daughters in the midst of this  poverty is truly admirable. They have indeed other ideas running through  the brain than mere housekeeping details. One has plaited her hair  like a Swiss girl, another is curled like any English baby, and Madame  Simaise, from the top of her hammock, lives in the beatitude of her  former beauty. As for father Simaise, he is always delighted. As long  as he hears the merry laugh of his daughters around him, he is ready  cheerfully to assume all the weight of this disorderly existence. To him  are addressed in a coaxing manner such requests as: \"Papa, I want a  bonnet. Papa, I must have a dress.\" Sometimes the winter is severe. They  are in such request, receive so many invitations. Pooh! the father has  but to get up a couple of hours earlier. They will have a fire only in  the studio, where all the family will gather. The girls will cut out and  make their own dresses, while the hammock ropes swing slowly to and fro,  and the father works on, perched upon his high stool.    [Illustration: p139-150]    Have you ever met these ladies in society? The moment they appear there  is a commotion. It is long since the first two came out, but they are  always so well adorned and so smart, that they are in great request as  partners. They have as much success as the younger sisters, almost as  much as the mother in former days; moreover they carry off their tawdry  jewelry and finery so well, and have such charming easy manners, with  the giddy laugh of spoilt children, and such a Spanish way of flirting  with a fan. Nevertheless they do not get married. No admirer has ever  been able to get over the sight of that singular home. The wasteful and  useless extravagance, the want of plates, the profusion of old tapestry  in holes, of antique and ungilt lustres, the draughty doors, the  constant visits of creditors, the slatternly appearance of the young  ladies in slipshod slippers and dressing gowns, put to flight the best  intentioned. In truth, it is not everyone who could resign himself to  hang up the hammock of an idle woman in his home for the rest of his  life.    I am very much afraid that the Misses Simaise will never marry. They  had, however, a golden and unique opportunity during the Commune. The  family had taken refuge in Normandy, in a small and very litigious town,  full of lawyers, attorneys, and business men. No sooner had the father  arrived, than he looked out for orders. His fame as a sculptor was of  service to him, and as in the public square of the town there happened  to be a statue of Cujas done by him, all the notabilities of the place  wanted to have their busts done.    [Illustration: p141-152]    The mother at once fastened up the hammock in a corner of the studio,  and the young ladies organized a few parties. They at once met with  great success. Here at least, poverty seemed but an accident due to  exile; the disorder of the establishment was accounted for. The handsome  girls laughed loudly themselves at their destitution.    [Illustration: p142-153]    They had started off without anything; and nothing could be had now  Paris was closed. It lent to them an extra charm. It called to mind  travelling gipsies, combing their beautiful hair in barns, and quenching  their thirst in streams. The least poetical compared them in their minds  to the exiles of Coblentz, those ladies of Marie-Antoinette's court who,  obliged to fly in haste, without powder or hoops, or bedchamber women,  were driven to all sorts of makeshifts, learning to wait upon themselves,  and keeping up the frivolity of the French court, the piquant smile of  the lost patches.    [Illustration: p143-154]    Every evening a throng of dazzled lawyers crowded Simaise's studio. To  the sounds of a hired piano, all this little world danced the polka,  waltzed, schottisched,--they still schottische in Normandy. \"I shall  end by marrying off one,\" thought old Simaise; and the fact is if one  had gone off, all the others would have followed suit. Unluckily the  first never went off, but it was a near touch. Amongst the numerous  partners of these young ladies, in that corps de ballet of lawyers,  attorneys and solicitors, the most rabid dancer was a widowed lawyer,  who was extremely attentive to the eldest daughter. He was called by  them \"the first dancing attorney,\" in memory of Moliere's ballets, and  certainly, considering the rate at which the fellow whirled round, Papa  Simaise might well build the greatest hopes on him. But then business  men do not dance like everybody else. This fellow, all the time he was  waltzing, reflected silently: \"The Simaise family is charming. Tra, la  la, la la la, but it's useless their trying to hurry me on, la la la, la  la la. I shall not propose till the gates of Paris are reopened. Tra la  la, and I shall be able to make all necessary inquiries, la la la!\" Thus  thought the first dancing attorney, and in fact, directly the blockade  of Paris was raised, he got his information about the family, and the  marriage did not come off.    Since then, the poor little creatures have missed many other chances.  However, this has in no way spoilt the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22523"],[0,"The History of the American Expedition Fighting the Bolsheviki (#10)"],[1," obtainable. There  were even women there who wore hats and stockings, in place of boots and  shawls. We had comfortable billets. But it was too good to be true. In  less than a week the Bolo's renewed activities on the upper Dvina made  it necessary for one company of the first battalion to go again to that  area. Colonel Corbley saw \"B\" Company depart on the tug \"Retvizan\" and  so far as field activities were concerned it was to be part of the  British forces on the Dvina from October till April rather than part of  the first battalion force. The company commander was to be drafted as  \"left bank\" commander of a mixed force and hold Toulgas those long, long  months. The only help he remembers from Colonel Corbley or Colonel  Stewart in the field operations was a single visit from each, the one to  examine his company fund book, the other to visit the troops on the line  in obedience to orders from Washington and General Ironside. Of this  visit Captain Boyd writes:      \"When Col. Stewart made his trip to Toulgas his advent was marked    principally by his losing one of his mittens, which were the ordinary    issue variety. He searched everywhere, and half insinuated that Capt.    Dean, my adjutant, a British officer, had taken it. I could see Dean    getting hot under the collar. Then he told me that my orderly must    have taken it. I knew Adamson was more honest than either myself or    the colonel, and that made me hot. Then he finally found the mitten    where he had dropped it, on the porch, and everything was serene    again.      \"Col. Stewart went with me up to one of the forward blockhouses, which    at that time was manned by the Scots. After the stock questions of    'where are you from' and 'what did you do in civil life' he launched    into a dissertation on the disadvantages of serving in an allied    command. The Scot looked at him in surprise and said, 'Why, sir, we've    been very glad to serve with the Americans, sir, and especially under    Lt. Dennis. There's an officer any man would be proud to serve under.'    That ended the discussion.\"    After this slight digression from the narrative, we may take up the  thread of the story of this push for Kotlas. Royal Scots and Russians  had been left in quiet possession of the upper Dvina near Seltso after  the struggle already related. But hard pressed again, they were waiting  the arrival of the company of Americans, who arrived one morning about  6:00 a. m. a few miles below our old friend, the village of  Yakovlevskoe. We marched to the village, reported to the British officer  in command at Seltso, and received the order, \"Come over here as quick  as you possibly can.\" The situation there was as follows: The Bolos had  come back down the river in force with gunboats and artillery, and were  making it exceedingly uncomfortable for the small British garrisons at  Seltso and Borok across the river. We marched around the town, through  swamps at times almost waist deep, and attacked the Bolo trenches from  the flank at dusk. We were successful, driving them back, and capturing  a good bit of supplies, including machine guns and a pom pom. The Bolos  lost two officers and twenty-seven men killed, while we had two men  slightly wounded, both of whom were later able to rejoin the company.    \"We expected a counter attack from the Bolo, as our force was much  smaller than his, and spent the first part of the night making trenches.  An excavation deeper than eighteen inches would have water in the  bottom. We were very cold, as it was October in Russia, and every man  wet to the skin, with no blankets or overcoats. About midnight the  British sent up two jugs of rum, which was immediately issued, contrary  to military regulations. It made about two swallows per man, but was a  lifesaver. At least a dozen men told me that they could not sleep before  that because they were so cold, but that this started their circulation  enough so they were able to sleep later.    In the morning we advanced to Lipovit and attacked there, but ran into a  jam, had both flanks turned by a much larger force, and were very  fortunate to get out with only one casualty. Corporal Downs lost his  eye, and showed extreme grit in the hard march back through the swamp,  never complaining. I saw, after returning to the States, an interview  with Col. Josselyn, at that time in command of the Dvina force, in which  he mentioned Downs, and commended him very highly.\"    The ensuing week we spent in Seltso, the Bolos occupying trenches around  the upper part of our defenses. They had gunboats and naval guns on  rafts, and made it quite uncomfortable for us with their shelling,  although the only American casualties were in the detachment of 310th  Engineers. Our victory was short lived, however, for in a few days our  river monitor was forced to return to Archangel on account of the  rapidly receding river, which gave the enemy the opportunity of moving  up their 9.2 inch naval guns, with double the range of our land  batteries, making our further occupation of Seltso impossible.    On the afternoon of October 14, the second and third platoons of Company  \"B\" were occupying the blockhouses when the Bolos made an attack, which  was easily repelled. As we were under artillery fire with no means of  replying, the British commander decided to evacuate that night. It was  impossible to get supplies out owing to the lack of transportation  facilities. That part of Company \"B\" in the village left at midnight,  followed by the force in the blockhouses at 3:00 a. m. After a very hard  march we reached Toulgas and established a position there.    Our position at Toulgas in the beginning was very unfavorable, being a  long narrow string of villages along the Dvina which was bordered with  thick underbrush extending a few hundred yards to the woods. We had a  string of machine gun posts scattered through the brush, and when our  line of defense was occupied there was less than two platoons left as a  reserve. With us at this time we had Company \"A\" of the 2nd Tenth Royal  Scots (British) under Captain Shute, and a section of Canadian  artillery.    The Bolos followed us here and after several days shelling, to which  because of being outranged we were unable to reply, they attacked late  in the afternoon of October 23rd. Our outposts held, and we immediately  counter attacked. The enemy was repulsed in disorder, losing some  machine guns, and having about one hundred casualties, while we came out  Scot free.    It was during the shelling incidental to this that Edvinson, the Viking,  did his stunt. He was in a machine gun emplacement which was hit by a  small H. E. shell. The others were considerably shaken up, and pulled  back, reporting Edvinson killed, that he had gone up in the air one way,  and the Lewis gun the other. We established the post a little farther  back and went out at dusk to get Edvinson's body. Much was the surprise  of the party when he hailed them with, \"Well, I think she's all right.\"  He had collected himself, retrieved the Lewis gun, taken it apart and  cleaned it and stuck to his post. The shelling and sniping here had been  quite heavy. His action was recognized by the British, who awarded him a  Military Medal, just as they did Corporal Morrow who was instrumental in  reoccupying and holding an important post which had been driven in early  in the engagement. Corporal Dreskey and Private Lintula also  distinguished themselves at this point.    Here we may leave \"B\" Company and the Scots and Russians making a  fortress of Toulgas on the left bank of the Dvina. The Reds were busy  defending Plesetskaya from a converging attack and not till snow clouds  gathered in the northern skies were they to gather up a heavy force to  attack Toulgas. We will now turn to the story of the first battalion  penetrating with bayonets far up the Vaga River.        IV    DOUGHBOYS ON GUARD IN ARCHANGEL    Second Battalion Lands To Protect Diplomatic Corps--Colonel Tschaplin's  Coup d'Etat Is Undone By Ambassador Francis--Doughboys Parade And  Practice New Weapons--Scowling Solombola Sailors--Description Of  Archangel--American Headquarters.    With the arrival of the American Expeditionary Force, the diplomatic  corps of the various Allied nations which had been compelled to flee  north before the Red radicals that had overthrown the Kerensky  provisional government, asked for troops in the city of Archangel itself  to stabilize the situation.    The second battalion of the 339th under command of Major J. Brooks  Nichols disembarked at Smolny Quay at four o'clock of the afternoon of  September 4th, the same day the ships dropped anchor in the harbor. A  patrol was at once put out under Lieut. Collins of \"H\" Company. It was  well that American troops were landed at once as will prove evident from  the following story.    The new government of Archangel was headed by the venerable Tchaikowsky,  a man who had been a revolutionary leader of the highest and saneest  type for many years. He had lived for a period of years in America, on a  farm in Kansas, and had been a writer of note in Russia and England for  many years. He was a democratic leader and his government was readily  accepted by the people. But as with all newly constructed governments it  moved very slowly and with characteristic Russian deliberation and  interminable talk and red tape.    This was too much for the impatient ones among the Russians who had  invited the Allied expedition. One Colonel Tschaplin (later to be dubbed  \"Charley Chaplin\" by American officers who took him humorously) who had  served under the old Czar and had had, according to his yarns--told by  the way in the most engaging English--a very remarkable experience with  the Bolsheviks getting out of Petrograd. He was, it is said, influenced  by some of the subordinate English officers to make a daring try to  hasten matters.    On the evening of the"]]]
