It was not an inviting spot at first.  There was little pasture for the  wearied mules on the almost naked rocks, and the stunted trees and  gnarled roots told eloquently of the severity of winter in those high  regions.  There was, however, a good spring of water and an over-arching  rock, which promised some degree of refreshment and shelter, and when  firewood was collected, a ruddy blaze sent up, the kettle put on to  boil, and several fine cuts of the guanaco set up to roast, the feelings  of sadness which had at first influenced Lawrence were put to flight,  and he felt more satisfaction in his lodging than he could have  experienced if it had been a palatial hotel with its confined air and  feather beds and cloying luxuries.    There was a species of natural recess in the cliff which Pedro screened  off as a chamber for Manuela, while she assisted Quashy to prepare the  supper.    \"There's nothing like fresh mountain air,\" exclaimed Lawrence, with a  glow of enthusiasm, after the first attack on the guanaco steaks had  subsided.    \"Specially when the said air happens to be quiet and warm, and the night  fine and the stars bright and the company pleasant,\" added the guide.    Quashy had a habit, when his risible faculties were only gently tickled,  of shutting his eyes, throwing back his head, opening his great mouth  wide, and indulging in a silent laugh.  Having done so on the present  occasion, he shut his mouth with a snap and opened his eyes.    \"Ho yis,\" he said in a low tone, \"bery nice when it all plisent like  now, but it am anoder t'ing when de fresh mountain air goes howlerin'  an' bowlerin' about like a wild beast, an' when it snowses an frozes fit  to cut off your noses an' shribel up de bery marrow in your bones!  Oh!  you got no notion what--\"    \"Hold your tongue, Quashy,\" interrupted Lawrence, \"why, your description  of such things makes one shiver.  Let us hope we may have no experience  of them and enjoy our comforts while we may.\"    \"Dat's true flosuffy, massa,\" returned the negro, helping himself to  more guanaco, and offering some on the end of his fork to Manuela, who  accepted the same with her usual ready smile, which, however, on this  occasion, expanded into an uncontrollable little laugh.    Lawrence was perplexed, and so was Quashy, for the quiet little Indian  was not given to giggling at trifles, much less to laughing at nothing.  Lawrence observed, however, that the girl did not reach out her hand  with her usual graceful action, but on the contrary gave her arm an  awkward twist which obliged the negro to stretch needlessly far over  towards her in handing the meat.    The result was that a pannikin of coffee which Quashy had placed on his  plate--the plate being in his lap--began to tilt over.  Before any one  could warn him it overturned, causing the poor man to spring up with a  yell as the hot liquid drenched his legs.  Of course every one laughed.  People always do at such mild mishaps.  As the coffee was not too hot,  and there was more in the kettle, Quashy joined in the laugh while he  wiped his garments, and afterwards replenished his pannikin.    But a new light began to force itself upon Lawrence.  \"Can it be,\" he  thought, \"that she did that on purpose?--that she saw the pannikin was  tilting, and--no, that's impossible!\"    He looked earnestly at the girl.  She had recovered her gravity by that  time, and was quietly eating her supper with downcast eyes.  \"Impossible,\" he repeated in thought, \"so unlike her, and so very unlike  the Indian character.\"  Nevertheless his perplexity remained, and when  he went to sleep that night, after gazing long and earnestly up at the  bright stars and at the white summits of the Andes which rose in awful  grandeur above him, he dreamed that while Quashy was sitting sound  asleep with his head on his knees in front of the fire, Manuela availed  herself of the opportunity to pour an ocean of hot coffee down his back!    Starting up wide awake at this, he found that Quashy lay beside him,  sleeping quietly on his back, that Pedro was similarly engaged, that the  Indian girl had disappeared into her dormitory, that the giant's castle  looked more splendidly real than ever in the rising moonlight, and that  no sound was to be heard save the brawling of the escaped river, as it  fled from its glacier-prison to its home in the mighty sea.        CHAPTER SIX.    A STORM IN THE MOUNTAINS--REFUGE FOUND--CONVERSE ROUND THE FIRE.    The summit of the pass was at last gained, and not a moment too soon,  for the storm which they had experienced a few days before was but the  prelude to a gale such as is rarely experienced save in the winter  months of the year, when most of the mountain passes are closed.    It began by mutterings of distant thunder, which caused the guide to  look round the horizon and up at the sky somewhat anxiously.    \"Do you think we shall reach our next shelter before it breaks?\" asked  Lawrence.    \"I hope so,\" said Pedro, pausing on a ridge from which an almost  illimitable view was had of mountain range and valley in all directions.    \"Far over in that direction,\" he continued, pointing with his hand,  \"lies the land of the Incas.  You have heard of the Incas, senhor?\"    \"Yes, I have heard of them, but cannot say that I am intimately  acquainted with their history.\"    \"It is a strange history--a very sad one,\" returned Pedro.  \"I will tell  you something about it at another time; at present it behoves us to push  on.\"    There was no question as to that point, for just as he spoke a sudden  and powerful gust of wind swept Quashy's straw hat off and sent it  spinning gaily along the path.  Vaulting from his mule with a wild  shout, the negro gave chase on foot, with an amount of anxiety that  seemed not justified by the occasion.  But as the poet truly puts it,  \"things are not what they seem,\" and Quashy's head-piece, which  presented much the appearance of a battered old straw hat, was in truth  an article of very considerable value.    It was one of those hats made by the people of South America, with a  delicate fibre so finely plaited that in texture it resembles fine  canvas, though in appearance it is like straw.  It is exceedingly tough,  takes a very long time to manufacture, and costs many dollars--so many,  indeed, that a hat of the kind is thought worthy of being preserved and  left as an heirloom from father to son as long as it lasts.    No wonder then that the negro made frantic efforts to regain his  property--all the more frantic that he was well aware if it should pass  over one of the neighbouring precipices it would be lost to him for  ever.  At last a friendly gust sent it into a snowdrift, through which  Quashy plunged and captured it.    Snow in considerable quantities lay here and there around them in the  form of old patches or drifts, and this began to be swept up by the  fierce wind in spite of its solidity.  Soon new snow began to fall, and,  mingling with the old drifts, rendered the air so thick that it was  sometimes difficult to see more than a few yards in advance.  Lawrence,  being unused to such scenes, began to fear they should get lost in these  awful solitudes, and felt specially anxious for Manuela, who, despite  the vigour of a frame trained, as it no doubt had been, in all the  hardihood incidental to Indian camp life, seemed to shrink from the  fierce blast and to droop before the bitter cold.    \"Here, put on my poncho,\" said the youth, riding suddenly up to the  girl's side and unceremoniously flinging his ample garment over the  slight poncho she already wore.  She drew it round her at once, and  silently accepted the offering with a smile and an inclination of her  small head which, even in these uncomfortable circumstances, were full  of grace.    \"Why _was_ she born a savage?\" thought the youth, with almost petulant  exasperation.  \"If she had only been white and civilised, I would have  wooed and won--at least,\" he added, modestly, \"I would have _tried_ to  win and wed her in spite of all the opposing world.  As it is, the--  the--gulf is impassable!\"    \"You have anticipated me, senhor,\" said the guide, who had reined in  until the rest of the party overtook him.  \"I had halted with the  intention of offering my poncho to Manuela.  Poor girl, she is a  daughter of the warm Pampas, and unused to the cold of the mountains.\"    He turned to her, and said something in the Indian tongue which seemed  to comfort her greatly, for she replied with a look and tone of  satisfaction.    \"I have just told her,\" he said to Lawrence, as they resumed the  journey, \"that in half an hour we shall reach a hut of shelter.  It is  at the foot of a steep descent close ahead; and as the wind is  fortunately on our backs, we shall be partially protected by the hill.\"    \"Surely the place cannot be a farm,\" said Lawrence; \"it must be too high  up for that.\"    \"No, as you say, it is too high for human habitation.  The hut is one of  those places of refuge which have been built at every two or three  leagues to afford protection to travellers when assailed by such  snow-storms as that which is about to break on us now.\"    He stopped, for the party came at the moment to a slope so steep that it  seemed impossible for man or mule to descend.  Being partly sheltered  from the fitful gusts of wind, it was pretty clear of snow, and they  could see that a zigzag track led to the bottom.  What made the descent  all the more difficult was a loose layer of small stones, on which they  slipped continually.  Before they had quite completed the descent the  storm burst forth.  Suddenly dense clouds of snow were seen rushing down  from the neighbouring peaks before a hurricane of wind, compared with  which previous gusts were trifles.    \"Come on--fast--fast!\" shouted the guide, looking back and waving his  hand.    The first deafening"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21717"],[0,"Battles with the Sea (#10)"],[1,"to shout and cry for wonder, and we may be sure that his wonder was  not decreased when he heard the lifeboat's story from the brave  coxswain's lips--how that, after driving right across the sands, as I  have described, they suddenly found themselves in deep water.  That  then, knowing the extremity of danger to be past, they had set the  sails, and, soon after, had, through God's mercy, landed the rescued  Portuguese crew in Ramsgate Harbour!    It must not be imagined, however, that such work as this can be done  without great cost to those who undertake it.    Some of the men never recovered from the effects of that night's  exposure.  The gratitude of the Portuguese seamen was very great, as  well as their amazement at such a rescue!  It is recorded of them that,  before arriving in the harbour, they were observed to be in consultation  together, and that one who understood a little English spoke to one of  the crew in an undertone.    \"Coxswain,\" said the lifeboat man, \"they want to give us all their  money!\"    \"Yes, yes,\" cried the Portuguese interpreter, in broken English; \"you  have saved our lives!  Thank you, thank you! but all we have is yours.  It is not much, but you may take it between you.\"  The amount was  seventeen pounds!    As might have been expected, neither the coxswain nor his men would  accept a penny of it.    This coxswain was Isaac Jarman, who for many years led the famous  Ramsgate lifeboat into action, and helped to save hundreds of human  lives.  While staying at Ramsgate I had the pleasure of shaking the  strong hard hand of Jarman, and heard some of his adventures from his  own lips.    Now, from all that has been said, it will, I think, be seen and admitted  that the lifeboats of the Institution are almost indestructible.    The _lifebelt_, to which reference has been so often made, deserves  special notice at this point.  The figure on the title-page shows its  appearance and the manner in which it is worn.  It was designed in 1854,  by Admiral J.R. Ward, the Institution's chief inspector of lifeboats.  Its chief quality is its great buoyancy, which is not only sufficient to  support a man with head and shoulders above water when heavily clothed,  but enables the wearer easily to support another person--the extra  buoyancy being 25 pounds.  Besides possessing several great advantages  over other lifebelts, that of Admiral Ward is divided in the middle by a  space, where the waistbelt is fastened.  This permits of great freedom  of action, and the whole machine is remarkably flexible.  It is also  very strong, forming a species of armour which protects the wearer from  severe blows, and, moreover, helps to keep him warm.    It behoves me now to say a few words about the inventor of lifeboats.  As has been told, our present splendid boat is a combination of all the  good points and improvements made in such boats down to the present  time.  But the man who first thought of a lifeboat and invented one; who  fought against apathy and opposition; who completed and launched his ark  of mercy on the sea at Bamborough, in the shape of a little coble, in  the year 1785, and who actually saved many lives therewith, was a London  coachbuilder, LIONEL LUKIN by name.    Assuredly this man deserved the deepest gratitude of the nation, for his  was the first lifeboat ever brought into action, and he inserted the  small end of that wedge which we have been hammering home ever since,  and which has resulted in the formation of one of the grandest, most  thoroughly national and unsectarian of our charitable institutions.    Henry Greathead--a boatbuilder of South Shields--erroneously got the  credit of this invention.  Greathead was a noted improver and builder of  lifeboats, and was well and deservedly rewarded for his work; but he was  not the inventor.  Lionel Lukin alone can claim that honour.    In regard to the men who man them, enough has been written to prove that  they well deserve to be regarded as the heroes of the coast!    And let me observe in passing that there are also _heroines_ of the  coast, as the following extract from the Journal of the Institution will  show.  It appeared in the January number of 1865.    \"Voted the Silver Medal of the Institution, and a copy of its vote of  thanks on parchment, to Miss Alice R. Le Geyt, in admiration of her  prompt and courageous conduct in rowing a small boat into the surf at  the risk of her life, and rescuing two little boys who had fallen into  the sea from the outer pier at Lyme Regis, Dorset, on the 4th August.\"    Again, in October, 1879, the Committee of the National Lifeboat  Institution voted the Silver Medal of the Institution, and a copy of the  vote inscribed on vellum, to Miss Ellen Francis Prideaux Brune, Miss  Gertrude Rose Prideaux Brune, Miss Mary Katherine Prideaux Brune, Miss  Beatrice May Prideaux Brune, and Miss Nora O'Shaughnessy, in  acknowledgment of their intrepid and prompt services in proceeding  through a heavy surf in their rowing-boat, and saving, at considerable  risk of life, a sailor from a boat which had been capsized by a squall  of wind off Bray Hill, Padstow Harbour, Cornwall, on the 9th August.  When the accident occurred, the ladies' boat was being towed astern of a  fishing-boat, and Miss Ellen Prideaux Brune, with great gallantry and  determination, asked to be cast off, and, with her companions, she  proceeded with all possible despatch to the rescue of the drowning  sailor.  All the ladies showed great courage, presence of mind, and  marked ability in the management of their small boat.  They ran great  risk in getting the man into it, on account of the strong tide and sea  on at the time.    So it would appear that the spirit of the far-famed Grace Darling has  not yet departed from the land!    If heroism consists in boldly facing and successfully overcoming dangers  of the most appalling nature, then I hold that thousands of our men of  the coast--from Shetland to the Land's End--stand as high as do those  among our soldiers and sailors who wear the Victoria Cross.  Let us  consider an example.    On that night in which the Royal Charter went down, there was a Maltese  sailor on board named Joseph Rodgers, who volunteered to swim ashore  with a rope.  Those who have seen the effect of a raging sea even on a  smooth beach, know that the power of the falling waves is terrible, and  their retreating force so great that the most powerful swimmers  occasionally perish in them.  But the coast to which Rodgers volunteered  to swim was an almost perpendicular cliff.    I write as an eye-witness, reader, for I saw the cliff myself, a few  days after the wreck took place, when I went down to that dreary coast  of Anglesea to identify the bodies of lost kindred.  Ay, and at that  time I also saw something of the awful aspect of loss by shipwreck.  I  went into the little church at Llanalgo, where upwards of thirty bodies  lay upon the floor--still in their wet garments, just as they had been  laid down by those who had brought them from the shore.  As I entered  that church one body lay directly in my path.  It was that of a young  sailor.  Strange to say, his cheeks were still ruddy as though he had  been alive, and his lips were tightly compressed--I could not help  fancying--with the force of the last strong effort he had made to keep  out the deadly sea.  Just beyond him lay a woman, and beside her a  little child, in their ordinary walking-dresses, as if they had lain  down there and fallen asleep side by side.  I had to step across these  silent forms, as they lay, some in the full light of the windows, others  in darkened corners of the little church, and to gaze earnestly into  their dead faces for the lineaments of those whom I had gone to find--  but I did not find them there.  Their bodies were washed ashore some  days afterwards.  A few of those who lay on that floor were covered to  hide the mutilation they had received when being driven on the cruel  rocks.  Altogether it was an awful sight--well fitted to draw forth the  prayer, \"God help and bless those daring men who are willing to risk  their lives at any moment all the year round, to save men and women and  little ones from such a fate as this!\"    But, to return to Joseph Rodgers.  The cliff to which he volunteered to  swim was thundered on by seas raised by one of the fiercest gales that  ever visited our shores.  It was dark, too, and broken spars and pieces  of wreck tossing about increased the danger; while the water was cold  enough to chill the life-blood in the stoutest frame.  No one knew  better than Rodgers the extreme danger of the attempt, yet he plunged  into the sea with a rope round his waist.  Had his motive been  self-preservation he could have gained the shore more easily without a  rope; but his motive was not selfish--it was truly generous.  He reached  the land, hauled a cable ashore, made it fast to a rock, and began to  rescue the crew, and I have no doubt that every soul in that vessel  would have been saved if she had not suddenly split across and sunk.  Four hundred and fifty-five lives were lost, but before the catastrophe  took place _thirty-nine_ lives were saved by the heroism of that Maltese  sailor.  The Lifeboat Institution awarded its gold medal, with its vote  of thanks inscribed on vellum, and 5 pounds, to Rodgers, in  acknowledgment of his noble conduct.    All round the kingdom the men are, as a rule, eager to man our  lifeboats.  Usually there is a _rush_ to the work; and as the men get  only ten shillings per man in the daytime, and twenty shillings at  night, on each occasion of going off, it can scarcely be supposed that  they do it only for the sake of the pay!  True, those payments are  increased on occasions of unusual risk or exposure; nevertheless, I  believe that a worthier motive animates our men of the coast.  I do not  say, or think, that religious feeling is the cause of"]]]
