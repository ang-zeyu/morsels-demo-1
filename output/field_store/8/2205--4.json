Now, no more words.  You  have got your marching orders, captain--I mean, doctor; and you will go  round with your officers and see the blacks, the two drivers, and our  own three men, so that there may be no excuse for their not being  ready.\"    \"Exactly so, Sir James.  I am very glad that we have come to this  climax.\"    \"So am I,\" said Sir James.  \"Eh?  What's that, Mark?\" for the boy was  whispering to his cousin.  \"What's that you are saying?\"    \"Oh, I was only talking to Dean, father,\" said the boy, rather  confusedly, and his face turned scarlet, lit up as it was by the  swinging lantern beneath which he was seated.    \"Yes, sir; I saw you were; and you were protesting against my orders for  what I presume you call this hurried start.\"    \"That I am sure I was not, father.  I was only joking to Dean.\"    \"And what was the joke, sir?  You, Dean, what did he say?\"    \"I don't like to tell you, uncle.\"    \"I insist that you tell me at once, sir,\" said Sir James angrily.    The boy gave a deprecating look at his cousin, and then went on  hesitatingly, \"Mark said that it was comic--\"    \"Well, sir?  Go on.\"    Dean coughed to clear his voice.    \"He said it was comic that you had just made us all officers and then  ended by taking it all out of the doctor's hands and playing captain  yourself.\"    \"Humph!  Well,\" grunted Sir James, \"it does sound a little odd.  But  this was the final instructions as I was making resignation.  But stop a  minute.  I had just made the reservation that I should interfere if I  thought proper.  Now I have done.  Give your final orders, captain; and  then if it was my case I should say, lights out and let's all have a  good rest till daylight to-morrow morning.  By the way, whose turn is it  to take the watch to-night, doctor?\"    \"Yours, Sir James, and I relieve you two hours after midnight.\"    \"And to-morrow night?\"    \"Mark first watch, Dean the second.\"    \"Next night?\"    \"Not settled yet.\"    \"Good; and I think it was a very excellent arrangement of yours, doctor,  to begin as we did on the first night of our moving into camp.\"    That night seemed all too short, and Mark could hardly believe that it  was close on daylight when the doctor roused him to see the  fierce-looking black, spear-armed, dimly showing by the light of the  lantern the former carried, while Dean would not believe it at all, but  treated it as part of a dream, and turned over, fast asleep again.    \"Oh, I say,\" cried Mark, \"did you ever see such an old dozey, doctor?\"    \"Catch hold of one arm,\" said the doctor.  \"I'll take the other.  Here,  Mak, take hold.\"    He handed the lantern to the black, who took it and stood looking on  while the sleeper was regularly set upon his legs, to stand staring in  alarm at the glistening eyes and the white grinning ivory of the man's  teeth.    \"Oh,\" he cried, in a half startled tone, \"I thought--it can't be  morning!\"    \"Can't it?\" said Mark, laughing.  \"Let go, doctor, I think he's awake  now.\"    \"Awake!  Of course I am.  But I say, is breakfast ready?\"    \"No, Dean,\" replied the doctor, \"and will not be till we are a couple of  hours on our track.\"    The bustle attending starting had already begun; the waggon drivers were  busy with the oxen, the keepers were saddling up two of the ponies, the  sailor was proving his right to be called a handy man, and stowing the  necessaries of the night in the fore and aft chests of the second  waggon, and in an almost incredible space of time everything was ready  for the start, and the order was given by the doctor.    Then came the cracking of the whips and the lowing of a couple of uneasy  bullocks; there was a strain on the long trek-tow, and the great  lumbering waggons moved off into the early dawn, the ponies being led,  for the heads of the expedition all agreed that it would be pleasanter  to walk till after sunrise through the crisp, cool air and not let their  blood stagnate by riding behind the slow, sluggish pacing of the oxen.    At the end of two hours there was a halt for breakfast at a spot  selected by the black Illaka, and he looked on while Dan started a fire  with a small supply of wood.  Dance fetched water from a little stream  that ran gurgling by the place, which was evidently in regular use for  camping.  Bob, after picketing the ponies so that they could browse,  went off and brought back more wood, and there with everything looking  bright and picturesque in the morning sun, so well had the doctor  arranged matters that Mark declared that only one thing was wanting to  have made it the most delicious breakfast they had ever had in their  lives.    \"Why, what did you want, boy?\" said Sir James.    \"We ought to have shot some birds of some kind, father, to have cooked.\"    \"Oh, never mind the birds.  We will have them for dinner,\" said Sir  James merrily.    \"If we shoot them,\" said the doctor.  \"Here, Dan, give me another mug of  coffee, and then look thoroughly well after yourself.\"    Only about an hour was spent before a fresh start was made, and then the  journey was resumed in the most orderly way and kept on till noon, when  water was reached at a curve of the little river along which the track  led through a dense grove of umbrageous trees.  Here there was ample  pasture for the cattle, which fed and rested in the shade for a good  three hours in the hottest part of the day, while an abundant meal was  prepared, after which a deliberate start was made by the well refreshed  party.    Then followed a long, slow bullock march till quite early evening, and  again the black led them to a beautiful woodland patch at a place where  the river whose banks they were following showed a good shallow  crossing, another display of traces proving that it was a customary  halting-place on the way to some kraal.    Here the great creaking waggons were drawn up, a fire was made and the  men busied themselves looking after the cattle and the ponies, a capital  meal was prepared, but without any addition being made by rifle or gun;  and just at dark, by the light of the twinkling lanterns, preparations  began for passing the night.    \"I say, Mark, you have to keep the watch,\" said Dean.  \"Don't you feel  proud?\"    \"Not a bit,\" said Mark.  \"Our black chap seems to be doing that.  Look  at him parading up and down there with his spear over his shoulder just  as if he was the grand boss of it all and we were his men.\"    Just then he strode up to where the boys were talking.    \"Lions?\" said Mark, in a questioning tone.    The man smiled pleasantly, and the boy repeated his question; but it was  plain that the black did not understand.    \"Oomph!  Oomph!  Oomph!\" growled Mark, in as near an imitation of the  monarch of the forest's roar as he could contrive after a couple of  visits to the Zoo; but it had no effect whatever on their surroundings  till the black, who now fully grasped his meaning, crouched down and  uttered a startling, barking roar which made two or three of the nearest  bullocks start up and stare in their direction.    \"Here, you, sir, stop that!\" shouted Buck Denham, the driver of their  waggon, the first being in charge of the Hottentot.    The black turned to him, smiling, and nodded, before meeting the boys'  eyes again and shaking his head.    Just then the doctor approached, to ask the reason of their guide's  imitation.    \"Oh,\" he said, on being informed, \"don't encourage him in anything of  that sort again, or we shall have a stampede of the ponies and bullocks.  Well, Mark, recollect that it's your first watch to-night.\"    \"Oh, I shan't forget,\" was the reply.  \"But you don't think we have come  out far enough yet to meet with dangerous wild beasts, do you?\"    \"Oh, indeed, but I do,\" replied the doctor.  \"We have left the last post  of civilisation behind, and we may come upon danger at any time.  Of  course you will mount guard with one of the double rifles charged with  bullet, and if there really is any suggestion of danger you will fire,  so as to give the alarm.  We shall come to your help directly.\"    \"Oh, yes, I understand,\" said Mark confidently, and he passed the  intervening time before he received his orders going round their little  camp with his cousin, watching the final preparations made by the  drivers and forelopers, a couple of ordinary thick-lipped blacks, and  then having a chat with the two keepers about what a change it was from  the park and grounds of the old manor.    As the time approached, Mark, in spite of his assumed cheerfulness,  could not master a slight feeling of discomfort.  It was evidently going  to be a cool, dark night.  The very sound of it was startling to the  lad--the announcement that he was to keep the full watch over their  little camp of two waggons in a country where lions were common, and on  one of the banks of the river which might very well be haunted by  hippopotami and loathsome crocodiles.    The captain had spoken of its being called Reptile River, and of course  that was what it meant.  The very thought of it was alarming.  He had  read enough to know that hippopotami came out to feed by night, crushing  up the succulent weeds and softer canes, grinding all up in their huge  portmanteau-like jaws, while it was a well known fact that the ponderous  beasts would rush at and trample down anyone who came in their way.    All that was bad enough, but nothing to compare for horror with the  thought of a huge lizard or newt-shaped creature lying in wait ready to  seize upon human being or ordinary animal, and drag its prey down into  some hole beneath the bank, ready to be devoured at the monster's  leisure.    Mark tried very hard to chase away such thoughts, but they kept"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2393"],[0,"His Dog (#10)"],[1,"class went to be judged. Link was sorry he had not spent  more money and entered Chum in every class. The initial victory had  gone to his head. He had not known he could be so serenely happy. After  a while, he started up at the attendant's droning announcement of,    \"Winners' Class, Male Scotch Collies! Numbers 62, 65, 68,70, 73!\"    Again Link and Chum set out for the ring. Link's glee had merged into  an all-consuming nervousness, comparable only to a maiden hunter's  \"buck ague.\" Chum, once more sensing Ferris's state of mind, lost his  own glad buoyancy and paced solemnly alongside, peering worriedly up  into Link's face at every few steps.    All five entrants filed into the ring and began their parade. Leighton,  in view of the importance of this crowning event, did not single out  any one dog, as before, to stand to one side; nor did he gate any. He  gave owners and spectators their full due, by a thorough inspection of  all five contestants. But as a result of his examination, he ended the  suspense by handing Link Ferris a purple rosette, whereon was blazoned  in gilt the legend, \"Winners.\"    A salvo of handclaps greeted the eminently just decision. And Chum left  the ring, to find a score of gratulatory hands stretched forth to pat  him. Quite a little crowd escorted him back to his bench.    A dozen people picked acquaintance with Link. They asked him all sorts  of questions as to his dog. Link made monosyllabic and noncommittal  replies to all of these--even when the great Col. Cyrus Marden himself  deigned to come over to the collie section and stare at Chum,  accompanying his scrutiny with a volley or patronizing inquiries.    From the bystanders Link learned something of real interest--namely,  that one of the \"specials\" was a big silver cup, to be awarded to \"best  collie of either sex\"; and that after the females should have been,  judged, the winning female and Chum must appear in the ring together to  compete for this trophy.    Sure enough, in less than thirty minutes Chum was summoned to the ring.  There, awaiting him, was a dainty and temperamental merle, of the  Tazewell strain. Exquisite and high-bred as was this female competitor,  Judge Leighton wasted little time on the examination before giving  Ferris a tricolored ribbon, whose possession entitled him to one of the  shimmering silver mugs in the near-by trophy case.    After receiving full assurance that the big cup should be his at the  close of the show, Link returned to Chum's bench in ecstasy and sat  down beside his tired dog, with one arm thrown lovingly round the  collie's ruff. Chum nestled against his triumphant master, as Link  fondled his bunch of ribbons and went over, mentally, every move of his  triumphal morning.    The milling and changing groups of spectators in front of Bench 65 did  not dwindle. Indeed, as the morning went on, they increased. People  kept coming back to the bench and bringing others with them. Some of  these people whispered together. Some merely stared and went away. Some  asked Ferris carefully worded questions, to which the shyly happy  mountaineer replied with sheepish grunts.    The long period of judging came at last to an end. And the \"Best Dog in  Show\" special was called.    Into the ring Ferris escorted Chum, amid a multitude of fellow winners,  representing one male or female of every breed exhibited. Leighton and  another judge stood in the ring's center, and around them billowed the  heterogeneous array. The two went at their Gargantuan task with an  expert swiftness. Mercilessly, dog after dog was weeded out and gated.  At last, Chum and two others were all remaining of the many which had  thronged the ring. The spectators were banked, five deep and  breathless, round the ropes.    The two judges went into brief executive session in one corner. Then  Leighton crossed to Link, for the fourth time that day, and gave him  the gaudy rosette which proclaimed Chum \"best dog in the show.\" A roar  of applause went up. Link felt dizzy--and numb. Then, with a gasp of  rapture, he stooped and gathered the bored Chum in his long arms, in a  bearlike, ecstatic hug.    \"We done it, Chummie!\" he chortled. \"WE DONE IT!\"    Still in a daze, he followed the steward to the trophy case, where he  received not only the shining silver cup, but a \"sovereign purse,\"  wherein were ensconced ten ten-dollar gold pieces.    It was all a dream--a wonder dream from which presently he must awaken.  Link was certain of that. But while the golden dream lasted, he knew  the nameless joys of paradise.    Chum close at his side, he made his way through the congratulating  crowd toward the outer gate of the country club grounds. He had almost  reached the wicket when someone touched him, with unnecessary firmness,  on the shoulder.    Not relishing the familiarity, Link turned a scowling visage on the  interrupter of his triumphal homeward progress. At his elbow stood a  stockily-built man, dressed with severe plainness.    \"You're Lincoln Ferris?\" queried the stranger, more as if stating  aggressively a fact than making an inquiry.    \"Yep,\" said Link, cross at this annoying break-in upon his trance of  happiness. \"What d'j' want?\" he added.    \"Please step back to the clubhouse a minute with me,\" returned the  stranger, civilly enough, but with the same bossy firmness in his tone  that had jarred Ferris in his touch. \"One or two people want to speak  to you. Bring along your dog.\"    Link glowered. He fancied he knew what was in store. Some of the ultra  select had gathered in the holy interior of the clubhouse and wanted a  private view of Chum, unsullied by the noisy presence of the crowd  outside. They would talk patronizingly to Link, and perhaps even try to  coax him into selling Chum. The thought decided Ferris.    \"I'm goin' home!\" he said roughly.    \"You're coming with me,\" contradicted the man in that same quiet voice,  but slipping his muscular arm into Link's.    With his other hand he shifted the lapel of his coat, displaying a  police badge on its reverse. Still avoiding any outward appearance of  force, he turned about, with his arm locked in Ferris's and started  toward the clubhouse.    \"Here!\" expostulated poor Link, with all a true mountaineer's horror of  the police. \"What's all this? I ain't broke no law! I--\"    An ugly growl from Chum punctuated his scared plea. Noting the terror  in his master's tone and the grip of the stranger on Link's arm, Chum  had spun round to face the two.    The collie's eyes were fixed grimly upon the plainclothes man's  temptingly thick throat. One corner of Chum's upper lip was curled  back, displaying a businesslike if snowy fang. His head was lowered.  Deep in his furry throat a succession of legato growls were born.    The plain-clothes man knew much about dogs. He knew, for example, that  when a dog holds his head high and barks there is no special danger to  be feared from him. But he also knew that when a dog lowers his head  and growls, showing his eyetooth, he means business.    And the man shrank from the menace. One hand crept back instinctively  toward his hip pocket.    Link saw the purely involuntary gesture, and he shook in his boots. It  was thus a Hampton constable had once reached back when a stray cur  snapped at him. And that constable had completed the movement by  drawing a pistol and shooting the cur. Perhaps this non-uniformed  stranger meant to do the same thing.    \"Hold on!\" begged Link, intervening between the man and the dog. \"I'll  go along with you peaceful. Quit, Chum! It's all right!\"    The dog still looked undecided. He did not like this new note in his  god's voice. But he obeyed the injunction, and fell into step at Link's  side as usual. Ferris suffered himself to be piloted, unresisting,  through the tattered remnant of the crowd and up the clubhouse steps.    There his conductor led him through the sacred portals and down a wide  hallway to the door of a committee room. Throwing open the door, he  ushered in his captive and the dog, entering behind them and reclosing  the heavy door.    In the room, round a table, sat several persons--all men except one.  The exception was the girl whose collie had had the bench next to  Chum's. At the table head, looking very magisterial indeed, sat Colonel  Marden. Beside him lounged a larger and older man in a plaid sport suit.    Link's escort ranged his prisoners at the foot of the table; Chum  standing tight against Ferris's knee, as if to guard him from possible  harm. Link stood glowering in sullen perplexity at the Colonel. Marden  cleared his voice pompously, then spoke.    \"Ferris,\" he began with much impressiveness, \"I am a magistrate of this  county--as you perhaps know. You may consider yourself before the Bar  of Justice, and reply to my questions accordingly.\"    Awed by this thundered preamble, Ferris made shift to mutter:    \"I ain't broke no laws. What d'j' want of me, anyhow?\"    \"First of all,\" proceeded Marden, \"where did you get that dog?\"    \"Chum here?\" said Ferris. \"Why, I come acrost him, early last spring,  on the patch of state road, jes' outside of Hampton. He was a-layin' in  a ditch, with his leg bust. Throwed off'n a auto, I figgered it. I took  him home an'--\"    He paused, as the sport-suited man next to Marden nodded excitedly to  the girl and then whispered to the Colonel.    \"You took him home?\" pursued Marden. \"Couldn't you see he was a  valuable dog?\"    \"I c'd see he was a sufferin' an' dyin'  dawg,\" retorted Link. \"I c'd  see he was a goner, 'less I took him home an' 'tended him. If you're  aimin' at findin' out why I went on keepin' him after that, I done so  because no one claimed him. I put up notices 'bout him. I put one up at  the post-office here, too. I--\"    \"He did!\" interrupted the girl. \"That's true! I saw it. Only--the  notice said it was a bird dog. That's why we didn't follow it up. He--\"    \"Miss Gault,\" suggested Marden in"]]]
