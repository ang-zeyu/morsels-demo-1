The  Sunnis say that no Shia'h can ever become a Hafiz, from which fact they  draw the conclusion that the Shia'hs are heretics. In the early days of  Islam, the great authorities on the question of the correct pronunciation  of the Quran were the Khalifs Abu Bakr, Omar, Osman, and 'Ali, and ten of  the Companions, who learned from the Prophet himself the exact way in which  Gabriel had spoken. The Arabic of heaven was the Arabic of Islam. The  effort, however, to preserve one uniform method of repeating the Quran  failed. Men of other lands could not acquire the pure intonation of Mecca,  and so no less than seven different ways of reading the sacred book became  current. Here was a great difficulty, but it proved surmountable. Abu Ibn  Kab, one of the Companions, had become so famous as a reader that the  Prophet himself said: \"read the Quran under Abu Ibn Kab.\" These men  remembered that Abu Ibn Kab had stated, that one day when scandalized at  man after man who entered the mosque repeating the Quran in different ways,  he spoke to Muhammad about it. His Highness said: \"O Abu Ibn Kab!  intelligence was sent to me to read the Quran in one dialect, and I was  attentive to the Court of God, and said: 'make easy the reading of the  Quran to my sects.' These instructions were sent to me a second time  saying: 'read the {43} Quran in two dialects.' Then I turned myself to the  Court of God saying: 'make easy the reading of the Quran to my sects.' Then  a voice was sent to me the third time saying: 'read the Quran in seven  dialects.'\"    This removed all difficulty, and the foresight displayed by the Prophet in  thus obtaining a divine sanction for the various ways of reading was looked  upon as a proof of his inspiration. Thus arose the \"haft qira,at,\" or seven  readings of the Quran, now recognised.    In the Quran compiled by the order of the Khalif Osman there were no  vowel-points, but when men of other countries embraced Islam they found  great difficulty in mastering Arabic. Khalid bin Ahmad, a great grammarian,  then invented the short vowels and other diacritical marks. The seven  famous \"Readers\" whose names have been given to the various modes of  reading, are Imam Nafi of Madina, Imam Ibn-i-Kasir of Mecca, Imam Abu 'Umr  of Basra, Imam Hamza of Kufa, Imam Ibn 'Amir of Syria, Imam 'Asim of Kufa,  Imam Kisae of Kufa.[44] These learned men affixed different vowel-points in  many places in the Quran, and thus slight differences of meaning arose. In  India the \"qira,at--reading,--of Imam 'Asim is followed by both Sunnis and  Shia'hs. There are three readings of lesser note allowable when reading the  Quran privately, but not when reading any part in a liturgical service.  During the month of Ramazan the Quran is repeated every night in the  mosque, it being so arranged that one-thirtieth part shall be recited each  night. The Imam of the mosque, or public Reader, (Qari) who commences  according to one of the seven recognised readings (qira,at), must keep to  the same all the month. As he has to recite without a book this involves a  great exercise of the memory. A good Hafiz will know the whole seven  varieties. The various readings thus introduced, though {44} unimportant in  their nature,[45] amount to about five hundred in number. The following are  a few illustrations. In the second Sura Abu 'Umr reads: \"Nor shall ye be  questioned concerning that which _they_ have done;\" but 'Asim reads: \"That  which _ye_ have done.\" This is caused by putting two dots above the line  instead of below it. Again 'Asim reads: \"_Enter ye_ the gates of hell\"  (Sura xxxix. 73), but Nafi reads: \"_Ye will be made to enter_ hell,\"--that  is, by a slight change the passive is substituted for the active voice.  These are fair samples of the rest. No doctrine, so far as I know, is  touched, but the way in which Tradition records the Prophet's anticipation  of the difficulty is instructive to the student of Islam. At times, too,  fierce disputes have arisen between the followers of the seven famous  Readers whose names I have given above. In the year 935 A.H., Ibn Shanabud,  a resident of Baghdad, ventured to introduce some different readings in his  recital of the Quran. The people of Baghdad, not knowing these, were  furious, and the Khalif was compelled to cast the offender into prison. A  Council of divines was called together, before whom the unhappy Ibn  Shanabud was produced. For a while he maintained the correctness of his  \"readings,\" but after being whipped seven times he said: \"I renounce my  manner of reading, and in future I shall follow no other than that of the  manuscript drawn up by the Khalif Osman, and that which is generally  received.\"[46]    Closely connected with this subject is the history of the rise of the  science of grammar. As Islam spread, it became necessary to expound the  Quran to persons unacquainted with Arabic. The science of grammar then  became an important branch of study, and the collection of Traditions a  necessary duty. The Faithful were for a long time in {45} doubt as to the  lawfulness of applying the laws of grammar to so sacred a book. There was  no command in the book itself to do so, nor had the Prophet given any  directions on this point. It was then neither \"farz\" nor \"sunnat,\" that is,  neither a command based on the Quran nor one based on any saying or act of  the Prophet. The Traditions, however, solve the difficulty.    Al Mamun, the distinguished though heretical Khalif of Baghdad, was a  patron of Al Farra, the chief of grammarians. A distinguished pupil of his,  Abu'l 'Abbas Thalub, on his death-bed expressed his belief in the fact that  the Quranists, the Traditionists, and others, had gained their heavenly  reward, but he had been only a grammarian, and grammar after all was, in  connection with the Quran, a science of doubtful legality. The friend to  whom he told his doubts and fears went home and saw a vision. It is  recorded that he had a vision in his sleep that very night, in which he saw  the blessed Prophet, who said to him: \"Give my greeting to Abu'l 'Abbas  Thalub, and say, 'thou art master of the superior science.'\" The Prophet  had now spoken, and henceforth grammar became a lawful study in Islam.  Muslims now quote the Quran as a perfect model of style; it may be well to  remember that the rules have been made for it, and that, therefore, it is  but natural that it should be perfect according to the present canons of  Arabic grammar.[47]    The question of the interpretation of the text speedily became a very  important branch of the \"'Ilm-i-usul.\" It is said that the Quran was  brought from Paradise by Gabriel to Muhammad as occasion required. The  Prophet was reproached for not having a complete revelation, and {46}  answered the reproach by the following verse, sent for the purpose. \"The  infidels say, 'unless the Quran be sent down to him all at once'--but in  this way we establish thy heart in it, _in parcels have we parcelled it out  to thee_\" (Sura xxv. 34). The revelation thus given is entirely objective;  it came to the ear of the Prophet through the teaching of Gabriel. \"Yet it  is a glorious Quran, _written on the preserved Table_.\" (Sura lxxxv. 22).  Gabriel addresses the Prophet thus: \"When we have _recited_ it then follow  thou the _recital_.\" (Sura lxxv. 18). The external mode in which it came is  referred to in the verse: \"We have _sent down_ to thee an Arabic Quran.\"  (Sura xx. 112). The fragmentary way in which the Quran was given[48] was  not without its difficulties. Some passages contradicted others, some were  difficult to understand. To the Prophet alone was the solution known. The  knowledge he communicated to his immediate followers, the Companions, as  they are called, thus: \"To thee have we sent down this book of monitions,  that _thou mayest make clear to men_ what hath been sent down to them.\"  (Sura xvi. 46).    Ibn Khaldoun says: \"The Prophet unfolded the meaning, distinguished between  abrogated and abrogating verses, {47} and communicated this knowledge to  his Companions. It was from his mouth that they knew the meaning of the  verses and the circumstances which led to each distinct revelation being  made.\"[49] The Companions thus instructed became perfectly familiar with  the whole revelation. This knowledge they handed down by word of mouth to  their followers, the Taba'in, who in their turn passed it on to their  followers the Taba-i-Taba'in. The art of writing then became common, and  the business of the commentator henceforth was to collect together the  sayings of the Companions thus handed down. Criticism of a passage in the  Quran was not his duty, criticism of a comment made on it by a Companion  was beyond his province: the first was too sacred to be touched, the second  must be accepted if only the chain of narrators of the statement were  perfect. Thus early in the history of Islam were the principles of exegesis  fixed and settled. Every word, every sentence, has now its place and class.  The commentator has now only to reproduce what was written before,[50]  though he may in elucidation of the point, bring forth some Tradition  hitherto unnoticed, which would, however, be a difficult thing to do. It  will thus be seen that anything like the work of a Christian commentator,  with all its fresh life and new ideas, is not to be had in Islam. The  perfection of its exegesis is its dogmatic and antique nature--     \"While as the world rolls on from age to age,    And realms of thought expand,    The letter stands without expanse or range,    Stiff as a dead man's hand.\"    The technical terms which the student must know, and {48} the definitions  of which he must understand, are those which relate to the nature of the  words, the sentences, the use of the words of the Quran, and the deduction  of arguments from passages in the book.

The words of the Quran are divided into four classes.    1."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20663"],[0,"The American Practical Brewer and Tanner (#10)"],[1," them to delight in this instructive process of  nature's formation, than with the brewer, who has not these immediate  tests to encourage his labours, which the others daily derive from  distillation, and which so quickly and uniformly terminates their  hazards and success. The principal object in their view being a high  and deliberate attenuation, with a full vinosity, without any further  regard to the quality or flavour of their mash, as the combination of  these qualities alone produces the required strength, in the cleanest  manner.    The brewer's cares are many, and of longer duration: he is the vintager  of our northern climates: his porter or ale should be an agreeable malt  wine, suited to the palate of the district or neighbourhood he lives  in, or, ultimately, to the taste of his customers. The time he has  allotted himself for attenuation was first founded in error, derived  from ignorance of the subject, and slavishly continued by that  invincible tyrant, custom. Hurry marks the progress of his fermentation,  which can only be corrected by his speedy mode of _cleansing_, and the  consequent but necessary perishing of a part. He must begin with more  accuracy at the mash tun than the malt distiller, as it is there he  must not only regulate the strength, but, partially, the flavour and  transparency of his malt wine. His object does not end with the malt  distiller's, nor, like his, concentre in one focal point, the solution  of the whole of the farina of the plant or grain employed, regardless  of milkiness or transparency; he must carefully take the heats of his  liquor, so as to solve and combine the qualities he has in view; which,  if he misses in the first mash, is partly irremediable in the succeeding  ones. His cares do not end here; independent of the minutiae of  fermentation and cleansing, he has the flavour, fining, and bringing  forward of his _malt wines_, nearly as much as the strength, to consider  and employ his attention.    It will scarcely be supposed that I would make these observations  merely with a view of drawing this comparison, though even it might  throw some light on the subject, without an attempt at supplying the  defects pointed out, and remedying the evils represented.    When the carbonic acid gas, or fixed air, so often mentioned in these  papers may be rendered subservient to part of the improvements I have  in view, and which is the constant, abundant, and uniform result of low  combustion, or vinous fermentation, in proportion of thirty-five pounds  weight to every hundred of saccharine or fermentable matter, fermented  in a due proportion of liquor, or water; from the decomposition of  which last, and the absorption of its oxygen, it is principally  obtained.    We have previously seen that one hundred pounds of fermentable matter  consists of eight pounds of hydrogen, twenty-eight of carbon, and  sixty-four pounds of oxygen; we have also seen that about thirty-five  pounds of carbon is extricated and detached from this quantity of  fermentable matter, properly diluted in water during fermentation;  allowing the usual quantity of spirit at the same time to be formed by  the process of this superfluous carbon, (as it now appears) must come  principally from that decomposition of the water of dilution, and not  from saccharine matter employed, which contains altogether but  twenty-eight pounds of carbon, the whole of which must necessarily go  to the formation of the fifty-seven pounds of dry alcohol produced.    But not to descend too deeply into particulars that might lead into  discussions not absolutely necessary in this place, let us take the  produce of ten gallons of ardent spirit, at one to ten over proof. We  here find that much more carbon has been generated, and given to the  atmosphere, than went to the composition of this quantity of spirit,  independent of the large quantity of alcohol dissolved in, and carried  off by it, in its flight as before observed.    Allowing the average quantity of fermentable matter in a quarter of  malt, barley, or other grain, to be only seventy-five pounds, then four  quarters will be equal to three hundred subtile pounds of raw sugar; or  eighty quarters of the one will be equal to six thousand pounds of the  other, or three tuns weight of unadulterated molasses.    If we estimate the superfluous carbonic acid gas of this quantity of  materials at only twenty-eight pounds per hundred, that will be sixteen  hundred and eighty pounds dissipated during the fermentation, which is  a loss, on every brewing of this quantity of materials, of upwards of  forty-one gallons of spirit, of the strength of one to ten.    What is computed here in spirit, may easily be applied to wine, porter,  beer, ale, sweets, &c. In barrels allowing three gallons and three  quarts of spirit per barrel to the former, and four gallons per barrel  to the latter, which gives eleven barrels and three quarters of the  one, and ten barrels and a quarter of the other, lost on each brewing  of eighty quarters of malt, or the average of that quantity of other  materials, by the mismanagement of the fermentation in one point only.    It must appear evident to every person capable of investigating this  calculation, that every six or seven pounds of carbon, fixed upon each  quarter of malt, or other materials, there will be an augmentation of  gravity or strength on this number of quarters, of ten or twelve  barrels each brewing; that is, every six or seven pounds of this  fugitive carbon that we arrest and fix in the fermenting fluid, as a  component part of the subsequent produce, by presenting the requisite  portion of oxygen and hydrogen, for the purpose within the sphere of  each others attraction, we increase our strength in the before-mentioned  _ratio_. It is of little moment whether this redundant gas comes from  the water of dilution or from the fermentable matter, as under, if we  can by any means turn it to account.    We have presumed the average quantity of fermentable matter at  seventy-five pounds per quarter; this must be evidently on the best  goods; this will give us a length of three barrels per quarter of malt  of eight bushels, of twenty-five pounds per barrel, specific gravity.  Suppose the apparent attenuation of these goods to be nineteen pounds,  the transparent gravity will be six pounds per barrel, viz.        Gravity of the worts in the cooler just before letting        down into the guile-tun, per barrel,                     25 lb.      Apparent attenuation per barrel,                    19 lb.      Transparent gravity per barrel,                      6                                                         ---     25 lb.        Or take it as it really is, viz. specific gravity        per barrel,                                              25 lb.      Real attenuation per barrel,                  13 lb. 8 oz.      Yest and lees,                                 5     8                                                    --------                                                    19 lb.      Gravity per barrel, when transparent,          6                                                   ---           25 lb.    It may be said that nineteen pounds is the real attenuation, and the  yest and lees produced is part thereof, as the fluid, or beer, in a  state of transparency is but six pounds per barrel specific gravity,  and it may, in some degree, be allowed to be so, as there is really so  much gravity lost during the process of fermentation. If we multiply  thirteen pounds eight ounces, which I have called the real attenuation,  by four, we shall find the result to be fifty-four pounds, which is  nineteen pounds more of superfluous gas upon four barrels of worts, of  twenty-five pounds gravity each, than is extricated from an equivalent  quantity of saccharine matter; that is, from one hundred pounds of raw  sugar or one hundred and twelve pounds of molasses, and their  respective waters of dilution, when the yest and lees do not exceed  five pounds eight ounces per barrel. This may be truly called an  analysis of the fermentable matter, giving the component parts  tolerably exact; though much depends on the management of the  fermentation, and the subsequent cleansing. By this analysis it  appears, that the mucilage of malt, or grain, gives out more gas than  the mucilage of sugar; and leaves a doubt on the mind whether to  adjudge the superfluous gas to the fermentable matter, or to the water  of dilution, or partly to both; but so it is, that these are the  products, whatever source we derive them from, and there is no denying  facts. The yest first added is not brought into this account.    There is a great similarity of appearance between the two species of  low combustion, fermentation and respiration. Fermentation, like  respiration, is the spontaneous effort of involuntary motion to  decomposition; and in the fermenting mass, as in the animal system, it  raises the temperature of both above that of the surrounding  atmosphere: that is, it is the cause of heat and involuntary motion,  both in the fermenting mass and in the animal system; and, like slow  combustion, consumes both, and resolves them into their first  principles, from which tendency the latter is constantly withheld by  the ingesta, fuel, or food, thrown in. I am well aware I must not carry  this reasoning any further.    Deep investigation may be thought not to be the object of our research;  but we must always have two things in view in inquiries of this nature;  indeed, in every pursuit of useful knowledge, where, like the present,  it is connected with the first principles, to pursue the winding path  of nature, through all her meanderings, up to the ultimate source of  these elements, which are the instruments of her operations; and when  we are favoured with a knowledge of these, either as the reward of  laboured assiduity and attention, or the"]]]
