Fit a piece of wood about 4 in.  long in the groove at each end of the moulding, plane down and fasten  with brads. Next take the thin batten or covering strip that comes with  the moulding and bore a 1/2-in. hole in the center, 6 in, from one end,  and a 1/4-in. hole, 8-3/16 in. from the other end. With a gouge cut a  slot 1/4 in. wide from one hole to the other in the center as shown in  the section A-A. Sandpaper this slot smooth and then fasten the batten  to the moulding with small brads driven in about 2 in. apart. At a point  3/4 in. from each end and in the center drill 1/4-in. holes through the  moulding at the small ends of the slots. These are for the ends of the  brace rods to spring into, to lock the legs when they are open. Tack the  two pieces of moulding marked F and J on the remaining edges of the  cardboard with the slots facing in and the large holes of the slots at  opposite sides, then place the other two pieces (G and H) 5 in. inside  of these, or just the length of the cross ends of the legs, with the  slots facing the first two placed (F and J) and tack fast with 4-oz.  tacks. Use brads at the ends and be careful that they do not enter the  1/4-in. holes. This part of the table can now be stained or painted the  same as the legs. The 3/8-in. side pieces can also be stained at this  time.    The ends of the brass rods can be bent in a vise. One end should be 1  in. long and should be square with the stock. Measure 11-1/4 in. center  to center and bend in opposite direction, leaving this end at a slight  angle out from square. Just at this bend raise a burr with a sharp  chisel to keep the washer on. Now place five of the copper washers on  the 1-in. end and batter the end of the rod so they will not slip off.  They should be loose so that they will roll and slip on the brace. Slip  a washer on the other end and put the end of the rod through the  3/16-in. hole in the leg from the short end side, place another washer  on the rod, saw off and rivet down the end.    [Illustration: The Legs Fold on the Under Side of Top]    To put the legs in the table, slip the end of one of the braces and the  washers in the large hole in the slot, shove it up until the 1/4-in.  hole in the crosspiece and the one in the moulding meet, then drive an  oak dowel or rod into each end. This is the hinge or pivot that the legs  swing on. When the leg is extended the end of the brace rod should  spring into the 1/4-in. hole in the moulding and lock the leg in place.  Rubber tips should be put on the bottom ends of the legs. Two wooden  buttons should be made and fastened to the cardboard as shown at K for  locking the legs when they are closed.    The felt can now be put on the top of the table. Stretch it tightly and  then tack the edges securely to the sides of the table. Now fasten on  the 3/8-in. side pieces and the brass corners with the small brass  screws as shown on the drawing, and the table is complete.          MAGAZINE STAND      If you do not possess the necessary tools for getting out the material  used in this piece of furniture, it can be purchased from a mill already  planed, sanded and cut to lengths given in the list. Any kind of wood  can be used, but quarter-sawed red oak with a mission stain and waxed,  gives the best appearance. The following pieces will be needed:      2 shelves, 3/8 by 8 by 15 in., S-2-S.    1 shelf, 3/8 by 10 by 15 in., S-2-S.    1 shelf, 3/8 by 12 by 15 in., S-2-S.    8 slats, 3/8 by 1-1/8 by 38 in., S-4-S.    2 slats, 1/4 by 1-1/8 by 38 in., S-4-S.    4 doz. 1 in. No. 9 round-head screws.    Take the four shelves and line them up with their backs and ends even  and clamp them together firmly. Mark the places for the slats across the  edges of the shelves, making the first line 1/2 in. from their ends. Use  a square to get the lines at right angles to the surface. Another line  is drawn 1-1/8 in. from the first, or the width of the slat. The ends of  the shelves are marked in the same manner, beginning from the back edges  and making the first line 1/2 in. from them, and then another line 1-1/8  in. from the first, or the width of the slat. Make a line across the  ends, 1/2 in. from the front edge of the 8-in, shelves, and another  line 1-1/8 in. back from the first one. This will leave 2-1/2 in. and  4-1/2 in. of space respectively from the front edges of the 10-in. and  12-in. shelves. Shift the shelves so they will be even on the front  edges and mark them the same as the back. Make a 1/4-in. depth mark on  all edges between the lines and cut this material out. This can be done  while the shelves are clamped together.    [Illustration: Stand Complete]    [Illustration: Detail of Stand]    Place the shelves on end in their order and start by screwing on the  back slats on both ends first, then screw on the two front slats. Turn  the stand down and put on the two back slats. Attach the two front slats  on the top shelf first. Then bore the places for the remaining holes and  turn in the screws. This will bend the slats into place. The two  remaining slats are screwed on the ends of the shelves without letting  them in, making the spaces equal. Mark each slat 1/2 in. below the  bottom shelf and saw them off. The stand can be taken apart, sandpapered  and stained.          A TABOURET      The stock necessary to make a tabouret of craftsman design as shown in  the accompanying illustration can be purchased from the mill ready cut  to length, squared and sanded. Quarter-sawed oak is the best wood to use  and it is also the easiest to secure. Order the following pieces:      4 legs, 1-1/2 in. square by 22 in. long.    1 top, 3/4 in. thick by 14 in. square.    4 top rails, 3/4 by 4 by 12 in.    4 lower rails, 3/4 by 3 by 12 in.    First square up the four legs. Bevel the tops at an angle of 30 deg. and  hollow out the lower part of the legs as shown in the detail sketch.  Clamp them together with the ends square and lay out the mortises all at  once. Cut the tenons on the rails to fit these mortises. Lay them out in  the same manner as the posts so as to get them all the same distance  between shoulders. The upper rails should be cut out underneath as  shown.    [Illustration: Detail of Tabouret]    The rails and posts can now be glued together. Be careful to get them  joined perfectly square. When they are dry cut and fit the top as shown.  This is fastened to the top rails by means of screws from the inside.  Remove all surplus glue from about the joints, as the finish will not  take where there is any glue. Go over the whole with fine sandpaper and  remove all rough spots, then apply the finish you like best.    [Illustration: Finished Tabouret]    [Illustration: Complete Porch Swing]          A PORCH SWING      The porch swing shown in the illustration can be made of southern pine  at a very moderate cost. It should be suspended by rustless black chains  and eyebolts passing through the lower rails. If cushions are desired  they can be made up quite cheaply of elastic felt covered with denim  cloth.    These pieces, dressed and sanded, may be bought at the mill:      2 rails, 1-3/4 by 3 by 71 in., S-4-S.    1 rail, 1-3/4 by 3 by 65 in., S-4-S.    2 posts, 1-3/4 by 3 by 25 in., S-4-S.    2 posts, 1-3/4 by 3 by 17 in., S-4-S.    2 rails, 1-3/4 by 3 by 22-1/2 in., S-2-S.    2 arm rests, 7/8 by 4 by 28 in., S-2-S.    5 slats, 3/8 by 5 by 16 in., S-2-S.    8 ft. flooring for bottom.    2 cleats, 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 57 in., S-4-S.    Plane and square the ends of all the rails and posts. Lay out the lap  joints for the back rails and posts. Use a knife line for this and saw  exactly to the line to avoid trimming with the chisel. When sawing be  careful to cut exactly halfway through the thickness of each piece. In  the same way make the lap joints between the front rail and posts. Have  the two end rails exactly the same length and proceed to fasten the  front and back posts to them, using 4-in. lag screws and washers. Bore  through the posts and part way into the ends of the end rails for the  lag screws.    [Illustration: Detail of the Porch Swing]    The slats are mortised 1/2 in. into the back rails, or a 3/8-in. groove  may be planed in these rails, the entire distance between joints, to  receive the slats. A rabbeting plane will be needed for this. The arm  rests lap over the back posts and are held to them with 2-in.  round-head screws. They may be fastened to the top of the front posts  with round-head screws or dowel pins.    Ordinary pine flooring makes a good, tight seat, or 7/8-in. board may be  used if desired. Fasten the cleats, which support the seat, to the front  and back lower rails with 1-1/2-in. screws.    To bring out the beautiful grain of southern pine, stain it brown or  black and finish with two coats of waterproof varnish.          A FOOT WARMER      This foot warmer is so constructed that two bricks may be heated and  placed inside of the stool.    Oak is the most suitable wood to use, and the following pieces will be  needed:      4 legs, 1-1/4 by 1-1/4 by 8 in., S-4-S.    4 side rails, 7/8 by 3 by 8-1/2 in., S-2-S.    4 top pieces, 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 12 in., S-2-S.    1 bottom piece, 7/8 by 8-1/2 by 8-1/2 in., S-2-S.    1 piece asbestos, 8-1/2 by 8-1/2 in.    4 pieces asbestos, 2 by 8-1/2 in.    1 sheet of brass, 13 by 13 in., 17 gauge.    2 hinges, 1 elbow catch, 3 doz. ornamental tacks.    The work may be started by shaping the four legs and cutting the  mortises for the rails. Tenons are cut on the ends of the rails to fit  in the mortises made in the posts. They are then glued together, care  being taken to get the stool perfectly square.    The top frame can now be made and covered with the sheet of brass. The  frame has mitered corners and the inside of the frame must be even with  the inside of the rails. This in turn is fastened to the stool with the  two hinges on the back and the elbow catch on the front side to keep it  closed.

Will you not protect us?\"    \"You drank of the two goblets, my children. I warned you that your  beauty would bring terrible trouble with it.\"    They bowed their little heads in silent sorrow, for they knew that that  was true.    \"Now,\" said the All-Mother, \"do you wish to go back and be ugly again?\"    They whispered together and said: \"No, Mother Carey, it is better to be  beautiful and die.\"    [Illustration: The Splendid Silk-Moth (about 1/2 life size)]    Then Mother Carey looked on them very kindly, and said: \"Little ones, I  love your brave spirit. You shall not die. Neither shall you lose your  beauty. I will give you a defence that will keep off all your enemies  but one, that is the Long-stinger Wasp, for you must in some way pay for  your loveliness.\" She waved her wand, and all over each of the  Beauty-crawlers, there came out bunches of sharp stickers like porcupine  quills, only they were worse than porcupine quills for each of the  stickers was poisoned at the tip, so that no creature could touch the  Beauty-crawlers without being stung.    The birds and beasts let them alone now, or suffer a terrible punishment  from the poison spears. You children, too, must beware of them; touch  them not, they will give you festering wounds. There is only one  creature now that the Beauty-crawlers truly fear; that is the  Long-stinger Wasp. He does indeed take toll of their race, but that is  the price they still must pay for their beauty. Did they not drink of  the double goblet?      TALE 29    The Great Splendid Silk-Moth or _Samia Cecropia_    When I was a very small boy, I saw my father bring in from the orchard a  ragged looking thing like parchment wrapped up with some tangled hair;  it was really the bundle-baby of this Moth. He kept it all winter, and  when the spring came, I saw for the first time the great miracle of the  insect world--the rag bundle was split open, and out came this glorious  creature with wings of red and brown velvet, embroidered with silver and  spots that looked like precious stones. It seemed the rarest thing in  the world, but I have found out since, that it is one of our common  moths, and any of you can get one, if you take the trouble.           *       *       *       *       *    Now listen, and you shall hear of what happened long ago to a green  crawler who was born to be a splendid Silk-Moth, but who spoiled it all  by a bad temper.    It had been a very cold, wet summer, and one day, when the wind was  whispering, he cried out: \"Mother Carey, when I have done with my  working life, and go into the Great Sleep, grant that it may never rain  on me for I hate rain, and it has done nothing but pour all summer  long.\" And he shivered the red knobs on his head with peevishness.    \"You silly little green crawler, don't you think I know better than you  what is good for you? Would you like there to be no rain?\"    \"Yes, I would,\" said the red-knobbed Samia rebelliously.    \"Would _you_?\" said the All-Mother to another green crawler, who hung on  a near-by limb.    \"Mother Carey, we have had a wet, cold summer, and the rain has been  miserable, but I know you will take care of us.\"    \"Good,\" said the All-Mother: \"then, in this way it shall be. You little  Red-Knobs shall have what you so much wish, you shall hang up in a dry  loft where not a drop of dew even shall touch you in your bundle-baby  sleep. And you little Yellow-Knobs shall hang under a limb where every  rain that comes shall drench your outer skin.\" And she left them.    When the time came to hang up, Red-Knobs was led to a place as dry as  could be, under a shed and swung his bundle-baby hammock from the  rafters.    Yellow-Knobs hung up his hammock under a twig in the rose garden.    The winter passed, and the springtime came with the great awakening day.  Each of the bundle-babies awoke from his hammock and broke his bonds.  Each found his new wings, and set about shaking them out to full size  and shape. Those of the rain-baby came quickly to their proper form, and  away he flew to rejoice in perfect life. But though the other shook and  shook, his wings would not fluff out. They seemed dried up; they were  numbed and of stunted growth.    Shake as he would, the wings stayed small and twisted. And as he  struggled, a Butcher-bird came by. His fierce eye was drawn by the  fluttering purple thing. It had no power to escape. He tore its crumpled  wings from its feathery form, and made of it a meal. But before dying it  had time to say, \"Oh, Mother Carey, now I know that your way was the  best.\"      TALE 30    The Green Fairy with the Long Train    Some fairies are Brownies and some are Greenies, and of all that really  and truly dance in the moonlight right here in America, Luna Greenie  seems the most wonderful; and this is her history:    Once upon a time there was a seed pearl that dropped from the robe of a  green fairy. It stuck on the leaf of a butternut tree till one warm day  Mother Carey, who knows all the wild things and loves them all, touched  it with her magic wand, called Hatch-awake, and out of the seed pearl  came an extraordinarily ugly little dwarf, crawling about on many legs.  He was just as greedy as he was ugly, and he ate leaf after leaf of the  butternut tree, and grew so fat that he burst his skin. Then a new skin  grew, and he kept on eating and bursting until he was quite big. But he  had also become wise and gentle; he had learned many things, and was not  quite so greedy now.    [Illustration: The Green Fairy With the Long Train (about 4/5 life  size)]    Mother Carey, the All-Mother, had been watching him, and knew that now  he was ready for the next step up. She told him to make himself a  hammock of rags and leaves, in the butternut tree. When he had crawled  into it, she touched him with her wand, the very same as the one she  used when she sent the Sleeping Beauty into her long sleep. Then that  little dwarf went soundly to sleep, hanging in his hammock.    Summer passed; autumn came; the leaves fell from the butternut tree,  taking the bundle-baby with them, exactly as in the old rhyme:            Rock-a-bye baby on the tree-top,          When the wind blows, your cradle will rock,          When the cold weather makes all the leaves fall,          Down tumbles baby and cradle and all.    But the hammock, with its sleeper, landed in a deep bed of leaves, and  lay there all winter, quite safe and warm.    Then when the springtime sun came over the hill, Mother Carey came  a-riding on the Warm Wind, and waving her wand. She stopped and kissed  the sleeping bundle-baby, just as the Prince kissed the Sleeping Beauty,  and instantly the baby awoke. Then happened the strangest thing. Out of  that ragged old hammock there came the most wonderful and beautiful  Green Fairy ever seen, with wings and with two trains; and as it came  out and looked shyly around, trembling with new life, Mother Carey  whispered, \"Go to the butternut grove and see what awaits you there.\"    So away she went. Oh, how easy and glorious it is to fly! She could  remember how once she used to crawl everywhere. And through the soft  sweet night she flew, as she was told, straight to the butternut grove.  As she came near she saw many green fairies--a great crowd of  them--gathered in the moonlight, and dancing round and round in  fluttering circles, swooping about and chasing each other, or hiding in  the leaves. They did not feast, for these fairies never eat, and they  drink only honey from flowers. But there was a spirit of great joy over  them all. And there were some there with longer head plumes than those  she wore. They seemed stronger and one of them came with a glad greeting  to the new Green Dancer and though she flew away, she was bursting with  joy that he should single her out. He pursued her till he caught her,  and hand in hand they danced together in the moonlight. She was happier  than she had known it was possible to be, and danced all night--that  wonderful wedding dance. But she was very tired when morning was near,  and high in the tree she slept so soundly that she never noticed that  many seed pearls that were clustered on the lining of her robe had got  loose and rolled into the crevices of the trunk. There they lay until  Mother Carey came to touch them with her magic wand, so each became a  crawler-dwarf, then a bundle-baby, and at last a dancing fairy.    But the Green Dancer did not know that--she knew only that it was a  glorious thing to be alive, and fly, and to dance in the moonlight.           *       *       *       *       *    You must never fail to watch under the butternut tree on mid-summer  nights, for it is quite possible that you may see the wedding dance of  the Luna Greenie and her sisters with the long-trained robes.      TALE 31    The Wicked Hoptoad and the Little Yellow Dragon    [Illustration: The Wicked Hoptoad and the Little Yellow Dragon]    Once upon a time, there was a beautiful little Yellow Dragon, who lived  a happy and innocent life on the high banks of a prattling stream. The  Dragon himself was dumb but he loved a merry noise, and nothing  pleased him more than the prattling of the water. Sometimes this  pleasant little Dragon went up stream, where it was noisy, and sometimes  he went down stream, where it was very silent, and rested awhile in  little pools. Here it was that he met with his first enemy, a warty  Hoptoad with jealous eyes. That Toad thought that he owned the pools  because he bathed there every springtime, and though it was a kind  little Dragon, the Toad hated him, and began to plot against him.    \"Ho! little Yellow Dragon,\" he said, \"you are very wonderful to see, and  you must be very clever; but you haven't got everything you want, have  you?\"    The Dragon smiled, shook his head, and made silent signs with his lips.  Then the Toad understood, for he said: \"Ho-h"]]]
