[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24931"],[0,"Elements of Agricultural Chemistry (#10)"],[1," are mixed together in  variable proportions, and the fluidity of the oils is due principally to  the quantity of the last which they contain. If olive oil be exposed to  cold, it is seen to become partially solid; and if it be then pressed, a  fluid flows out, and a crystalline substance remains; the former is  oleine, though not absolutely pure, and the latter margarine. The  perfect separation of these substances involves a variety of troublesome  chemical processes; and when it has been effected, it is found that each  of them is a compound of a peculiar acid, with another substance having  a sweet taste, and which has received the name of glycerine, or the  sweet principle of oil. Glycerine, as it exists in the fats, appears to  be a compound of C_{3}H_{2}O, and its properties are the same from  whatever source it is obtained. The acids separated from it are known by  the names of margaric, stearic, and oleic acids.    _Margaric Acid_ is best obtained pure by boiling olive oil with an  alkali until it is saponified, and decomposing the soap with an acid,  expressing the margaric acid, which separates, and crystallising it from  alcohol. It is a white crystalline fusible solid, insoluble in water,  but soluble in alcohol and in solutions of the alkalies. Its composition  is--         Carbon     75.56       Hydrogen   12.59       Oxygen     11.85                 ------                 100.00    and its formula C_{34}H_{34}O_{4}.    _Stearic Acid._--Although this acid exists in many plants, it is most  conveniently extracted from lard. It is a crystalline solid less fusible  than margaric acid, but closely resembling it in its other properties.  Its formula is C_{36}H_{36}O_{4}.    _Oleic Acid._--Under this name two different substances appear to be  included. It has been applied generally to the fluid acids of all oils,  while it would appear that the drying and non-drying oils actually  contain substances of different composition. The acid extracted from  olive oil appears to have the formula C_{36}H_{34}O_{4}, while that from  linseed oil is C_{46}H_{38}O_{6}, but this is still doubtful.    Other fatty acids have been detected in palm oil, cocoa-nut oil, &c.  &c., which so closely resemble margaric and stearic acids as to be  easily confounded with them. Though presenting many points of interest,  it is unnecessary to describe them in detail here.    _Wax_ is a substance closely allied to the oils. It consists of two  substances, cerine and myricine, which are separated from one another by  boiling alcohol, in which the former is more soluble. They are extremely  complex in composition, the former consisting principally of an acid  similar to the fatty acids, called cerotic acid, and containing  C_{54}H_{54}O_{4}. The latter has the formula C_{92}H_{92}O_{4}. The wax  found in the leaves of the lilac and other plants appears to consist of  myricine, while that extracted from the sugar-cane is said to be  different, and to have the formula C_{48}H_{50}O_{2}. It is probable  that other plants contain different sorts of wax, but their  investigation is still so incomplete, that nothing definite can be said  regarding them. Wax and fats appear to be produced in the plant from  starch and sugar; at least it is unquestionable that the bee is capable  of producing the former from sugar, and we shall afterwards see that a  similar change is most probably produced in the plant. The fatty matters  contained in animals are identical with those of plants.    _3d. Nitrogenous or Albuminous Constituents of Plants and Animals._--The  nitrogenous constituents of plants and animals are so closely allied,  both in properties and composition, that they may be most advantageously  considered together.    _Albumen._--Vegetable albumen is found dissolved in the juices of most  plants, and is abundant in that of the potato, the turnip, and wheat. In  these juices it exists in a soluble state, but when its solution is  heated to about 150 deg., it coagulates into a flocky insoluble substance.  It is also thrown down by acids and alcohol. Coagulated albumen is  soluble in alkalies and in nitric acid. Animal albumen exists in the  white of eggs, the serum of blood, and the juice of flesh; and from all  these sources is scarcely distinguishable in its properties from  vegetable albumen.    It is a substance of very complicated composition, and chemists are not  agreed as to the formula by which its constitution is to be expressed, a  difficulty which occurs also with most of the other nitrogenous  compounds. The results of the analyses of albumen from different sources  are however quite identical, as may be seen from those subjoined--                 From    From       From    From               Wheat.  Potatoes.  Blood.  White of Egg.  Carbon        53.7    53.1        53.4      53.0  Hydrogen       7.1     7.2         7.0       7.1  Nitrogen      15.6     ...        15.5      15.6  Oxygen      }      {   ...        22.1      22.9  Sulphur     } 23.6 {  0.97         1.6       1.1  Phosphorus  }      {   ...         0.4       0.3               -----               -----     -----               100.0               100.0     100.0    Closely allied to vegetable albumen is the substance known by the name  of _glutin_, which is obtained by boiling the gluten of wheat with  alcohol. It appears to be a sort of coagulated albumen, with which its  composition completely agrees.    _Vegetable Fibrine._--If a quantity of wheat flour be tied up in a piece  of cloth, and kneaded for some time under water, the starch it contains  is gradually washed out, and there remains a quantity of a glutinous  substance called gluten. When this is boiled with alcohol, the _glutin_  above referred to is extracted, and vegetable fibrine is left. It  dissolves in dilute potash, and on the addition of acetic acid is  deposited in a pure state. Treated with hydrochloric acid, diluted with  ten times its weight of water, it swells up into a jelly-like mass.  When boiled or preserved for a long time under water, it cannot be  distinguished from coagulated albumen.    _Animal Fibrine_ exists in the blood and the muscles, and agrees in all  its characters and composition with vegetable fibrine, as is shown by  the subjoined analyses--                 Wheat Flour.     Blood.    Flesh.  Carbon         53.1            52.5      53.3  Hydrogen        7.0             6.9       7.1  Nitrogen       15.6            15.5      15.3  Oxygen         23.2            24.0      23.1  Sulphur         1.1             1.1       1.2                -----           -----     -----                100.0           100.0     100.0    _Caseine._--Vegetable caseine exists abundantly in most plants,  especially in the seeds, and remains in the juice after albumen has been  precipitated by heat, from which it may be separated in flocks by the  addition of an acid. It has been obtained for chemical examination,  principally from peas and beans, and from the almond and oats. When  prepared from the pea it has been called _legumine,_ from almonds  _emulsine_, and from oats _avenine_; but they are all three identical in  their properties, although formerly believed to be different, and  distinguished by these names. Vegetable caseine is best obtained by  treating peas or beans with hot water, and straining the fluid. On  standing, the starch held in suspension is deposited, and the caseine is  retained in solution in the alkaline fluid; by the addition of an acid  it is precipitated as a thick curd. Caseine is insoluble in water, but  dissolves readily in alkalies; its solution is not coagulated by heat,  but, on evaporation, becomes covered with a thin pellicle, which is  renewed as often as it is removed.    _Animal Caseine_ is the principal constituent of milk, and is obtained  by the cautious addition of an acid to skimmed milk, by which it is  precipitated as a thick white curd. It is also obtained by the use of  rennet, and the process of curding milk is simply the coagulation of its  caseine. It is soluble in alkalies, and precipitated from its solution  by acids, and in all other respects agrees with vegetable caseine.    The composition of animal caseine has been well ascertained, but  considerable doubt still exists as to that of vegetable caseine, owing  to the difficulty of obtaining it absolutely pure. The analyses of  different chemists give rather discordant results, but we have given  those which appear most trustworthy--                          From Peas.       Carbon          50.6    50.7       Hydrogen         6.8     6.6       Nitrogen        16.5    15.8       Oxygen          25.6    23.8       Sulphur          0.5     0.8       Phosphorus       ...     2.3                      -----   -----                      100.0   100.0    Other results differ considerably from these, and some observers have  even obtained as much as eighteen per cent of nitrogen and fifty-three  of carbon.    The composition of animal caseine differs from this principally in the  amount of carbon. Its composition is--         Carbon       53.6       Hydrogen      7.1       Nitrogen     15.8       Oxygen       22.5       Sulphur       1.0                   -----                   100.0    The most cursory examination of these analytical numbers is sufficient  to show that a very close relation subsists between the different  substances just described. Indeed, with the exception of vegetable  caseine, they may be said all to present the same composition; and, as  already mentioned, there are analyses of it which would class it  completely with the others. While, however, the quantities of carbon,  hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen are the same, differences exist in the  sulphur and phosphorus they contain, and which, though very small in  quantity, are indubitably essential to them. Much importance has been  attributed to these constituents by various chemists, and especially by  Mulder, who has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24951"],[0,"The War in South Africa, Its Cause and Conduct (#10)"],[1,"has led  to their going from bad to worse. It is not true that this is owing to  the raid. They were going from bad to worse before the raid. We were on  the verge of war before the raid, and the Transvaal was on the verge of  revolution. The effect of the raid has been to give the policy of  leaving things alone a new lease of life, and with the old consequences.    'The spectacle of thousands of British subjects kept permanently in the  position of helots, constantly chafing under undoubted grievances, and  calling vainly to her Majesty's Government for redress, does steadily  undermine the influence and reputation of Great Britain within the  Queen's dominions. A section of the press, not in the Transvaal only,  preaches openly and constantly the doctrine of a republic embracing all  South Africa, and supports it by menacing references to the armaments of  the Transvaal, its alliance with the Orange Free State, and the active  sympathy which, in case of war, it would receive from a section of her  Majesty's subjects. I regret to say that this doctrine, supported as it  is by a ceaseless stream of malignant lies about the intentions of her  Majesty's Government, is producing a great effect on a large number of  our Dutch fellow-colonists. Language is frequently used which seems to  imply that the Dutch have some superior right, even in this colony, to  their fellow-citizens of British birth. Thousands of men peaceably  disposed, and if left alone perfectly satisfied with their position as  British subjects, are being drawn into disaffection, and there is a  corresponding exasperation upon the part of the British.    'I can see nothing which will put a stop to this mischievous propaganda  but some striking proof of the intention of her Majesty's Government not  to be ousted from its position in South Africa.'    Such were the grave and measured words with which the British pro-consul  warned his countrymen of what was to come. He saw the stormcloud piling  in the north, but even his eyes had not yet discerned how near and how  terrible was the tempest.    Throughout the end of June and the early part of July much was hoped  from the mediation of the heads of the Afrikander Bond, the political  union of the Dutch Cape colonists. On the one hand, they were the  kinsmen of the Boers; on the other, they were British subjects, and were  enjoying the blessings of those liberal institutions which we were  anxious to see extended to the Transvaal. 'Only treat our folk as we  treat yours!' Our whole contention was compressed into that prayer. But  nothing came of the mission, though a scheme endorsed by Mr. Hofmeyr and  Mr. Herholdt, of the Bond, with Mr. Fischer of the Free State, was  introduced into the Raad and applauded by Mr. Schreiner, the Africander  Premier of Cape Colony. In its original form the provisions were obscure  and complicated, the franchise varying from nine years to seven under  different conditions. In debate, however, the terms were amended until  the time was reduced to seven years, and the proposed representation of  the Goldfields placed at five. The concession was not a great one, nor  could the representation, five out of thirty-one, be considered a  generous provision for half the adult male population; but the reduction  of the years of residence was eagerly hailed in England as a sign that a  compromise might be effected. A sigh of relief went up from the country.  'If,' said the Colonial Secretary, 'this report is confirmed, this  important change in the proposals of President Kruger, coupled with  previous amendments, leads Government to hope that the new law may prove  to be the basis of a settlement on the lines laid down by Sir Alfred  Milner in the Bloemfontein Conference.' He added that there were some  vexatious conditions attached, but concluded, 'Her Majesty's Government  feel assured that the President, having accepted the principle for which  they have contended, will be prepared to reconsider any detail of his  scheme which can be shown to be a possible hindrance to the full  accomplishment of the object in view, and that he will not allow them to  be nullified or reduced in value by any subsequent alterations of the  law or acts of administration.' At the same time, the 'Times' declared  the crisis to be at an end: 'If the Dutch statesmen of the Cape have  induced their brethren in the Transvaal to carry such a Bill, they will  have deserved the lasting gratitude, not only of their own countrymen  and of the English colonists in South Africa, but of the British Empire  and of the civilised world.' The reception of the idea that the crisis  was at an end is surely a conclusive proof how little it was desired in  England that that crisis should lead to war.    But this fair prospect was soon destined to be overcast. Questions of  detail arose which, when closely examined, proved to be matters of very  essential importance. The Uitlanders and British South Africans, who had  experienced in the past how illusory the promises of the President might  be, insisted upon guarantees. The seven years offered were two years  more than that which Sir Alfred Milner had declared to be an irreducible  minimum. The difference of two years would not have hindered their  acceptance, even at the expense of some humiliation to our  representative. But there were conditions which excited distrust when  drawn up by so wily a diplomatist. One was that the alien who aspired to  burghership had to produce a certificate of continuous registration for  a certain time. But the law of registration had fallen into disuse in  the Transvaal, and consequently this provision might render the whole  Bill valueless. Since it was carefully retained, it was certainly meant  for use. The door had been opened, but a stone was placed to block it.  Again, the continued burghership of the new-comers was made to depend  upon the resolution of the first Raad, so that should the mining members  propose any measure of reform, not only their Bill but they also might  be swept out of the house by a Boer majority. What could an Opposition  do if a vote of the Government might at any moment unseat them all? It  was clear that a measure which contained such provisions must be very  carefully sifted before a British Government could accept it as a final  settlement and a complete concession of justice to its subjects. On the  other hand, it naturally felt loth to refuse those clauses which offered  some prospect of an amelioration in their condition. It took the course,  therefore, of suggesting that each Government should appoint delegates  to form a joint commission which should inquire into the working of the  proposed Bill before it was put into a final form. The proposal was  submitted to the Raad on August 7, with the addition that when this was  done Sir Alfred Milner was prepared to discuss anything else, including  arbitration without the interference of foreign powers.    The suggestion of this joint commission has been criticised as an  unwarrantable intrusion into the internal affairs of another country.  But then the whole question from the beginning was about the internal  affairs of another country, since there could be no rest in South Africa  so long as one race tried to dominate the other. It is futile to suggest  analogies, and to imagine what France would do if Germany were to  interfere in a question of French franchise. Supposing that France  contained nearly as many Germans as Frenchmen, and that they were  ill-treated, Germany would interfere quickly enough and continue to do  so until some fair _modus vivendi_ was established. The fact is that the  case of the Transvaal stands alone, that such a condition of things has  never been known, and that no previous precedent can apply to it, save  the general rule that white men who are heavily taxed must have some  representation. Sentiment may incline to the smaller nation, but reason  and justice are all on the side of Britain.    A long delay followed upon the proposal of the Secretary of the  Colonies. No reply was forthcoming from Pretoria. But on all sides there  came evidence that those preparations for war which had been quietly  going on even before the Jameson Raid were now being hurriedly  perfected. For so small a State enormous sums were being spent upon  military equipment. Cases of rifles and boxes of cartridges streamed  into the arsenal, not only from Delagoa Bay, but even, to the  indignation of the English colonists, through Cape Town and Port  Elizabeth. Huge packing-cases, marked 'Agricultural Instruments' and  'Mining Machinery,' arrived from Germany and France, to find their  places in the forts of Johannesburg or Pretoria. As early as May the  Orange Free State President, who was looked upon by the simple and  trustful British as the honest broker who was about to arrange a peace,  was writing to Grobler, the Transvaal official, claiming his share of  the twenty-five million cartridges which had then been imported. This  was the man who was posing as mediator between the two parties a  fortnight later at Bloemfontein.    For three years the Transvaal had been arming to the teeth. So many  modern magazine-rifles had been imported that there were enough to  furnish five to every male burgher in the country. The importation of  ammunition was on the same gigantic scale. For what were these  formidable preparations? Evidently for a war with Great Britain, and not  for a defensive war. It is not in a defensive war that a State provides  sufficient rifles to arm every man of Dutch blood in the whole of South  Africa. No British reinforcements had been sent during the years that  the Transvaal was obviously preparing for a struggle. In that one  eloquent fact lies a complete proof as to which side forced on a war,  and which side desired to avoid one. For three weeks and more, during  which Mr. Kruger was silent, these preparations"]]]
