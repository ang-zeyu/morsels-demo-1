How necessary that I should be very careful in my       conduct for the credit of religion and Methodism!         _March 24th._--I have this day finished twenty-two years of my       life. I have decided this day to travel in the Methodist Connexion       and preach Jesus to the lost sons of men. Oh, the awful importance       of this work! How utterly unfit I am for the undertaking! How       little wisdom, experience, and, above all, grace do I possess for       the labours of the ministry! Blessed Jesus, fountain of wisdom, God       of power, I give myself to thee, and to the Church, to do with me       according to thy will. Instruct and sanctify me, that whether I       live, it may be to the Lord, and when I die it may be to the Lord!         _April 3rd.--Easter Sunday._--I this day commenced my ministerial       labours. Bless the Lord, he has given me a heart to feel. He hears       my prayer. Oh, my soul, hang all thy hopes upon the Lord! Forbid I       should seek the praise of men, but may I seek their good and God's       glory.         In the morning I endeavoured to speak from Ps. cxxvi. 5, and in the       evening from Acts ii. 24--a subject suitable for the day; bless the       Lord, I felt something of the power of my Saviour's resurrection       resting on my soul.         _April 8th._--The Lord being my helper, my little knowledge and       feeble talents shall be unreservedly devoted to his service. I do       not yet regret giving up my worldly pursuits for the welfare of       souls. I want Christ to be all in all.         _April 10th.--Sabbath._--I endeavoured this morning to show the       abundant provisions, the efficacy, and the triumphs of the Gospel       from Isaiah xxv. 6, 7, 8, and in the afternoon I described the       righteous man and his end from Prov. xiv. 32. I felt much of the       presence of the Lord, and I do bless the Lord he has converted one       soul in this place to-day. I feel encouraged to go on.         _April 13th._--I have been depressed in spirit on account of having       no abode for domestic retirement, and becoming exposed to all the       besetments of public life.         _April 15th._--So bowed down with temptation to-day, I almost       resolved to return to my native place. But, in God's strength, I       will try to do my best during the time I have engaged to supply my       brother William's place.         _April 16th._--In reading Rollin's account of the conquest of       Babylon, I conceive more exalted ideas of the truth of the Word of       God, whose predictions were so exactly fulfilled in the destruction       of that city.         _April 17th.--Sabbath._--My labours this day have been excessive,       having delivered three discourses. In the morning my mind was dull       and heavy, in the afternoon warm and pathetic, in the evening clear       and fertile. I feel encouraged to continue on.         _April 23rd._--I feel nothing but condemnation in reviewing the       actions of the past week. Would it not be better for me to return       home until I gain better government over myself. Oh, Lord, I throw       myself upon thy mercy! \"Take not thy Holy Spirit from me! Restore       unto me the joy of thy salvation!\"         _April 25th and 26th._--And thus I go on, depressed and refreshed;       almost discouraged because of the way, and then cheered by the kind       and fatherly conversation of Rev. Thomas Madden.         _April 29th._--In travelling to-day a tree fell across the road       four or five rods before me, and another not far behind, but I       escaped unhurt. My heart glowed with gratitude; I felt that the       Lord was indeed my protector. But whilst so narrowly escaping       myself, two persons, a woman and her son, who were travelling a       short distance behind me, were suddenly killed by the falling of a       tree, and thus in an instant hurried into eternity.         _May 4th._--I watched to-day a large concourse of people assembled       to witness horse-racing. I stood at a distance that I might observe       an illustration of human nature. Curiosity and excitement were       depicted in every countenance. What is to become of this       thoughtless multitude? Is there no mercy for them? Surely there is.       Why will they not be saved? Because they will not come to Him.         _May 5th._--During the day I preached once, to a listening but       wicked assembly. In the afternoon I heard my brother William. I was       affected by the force of his reasoning, and the power of his       eloquence. I hope the Lord will help me to imitate his piety and       zeal.         _May 7th._--A camp-meeting was commenced this afternoon on Yonge       Street, near the town of York. Rev. Thomas Madden preached from,       \"Lord help me!\" Every countenance indicated interest, and every       heart appeared willing to receive the word. In the evening a pious,       aged man spoke (Mr. D. Y.) His discourse was full of God. Several       were converted and made very happy.         _May 8th._--The people rose at 5 a.m. After prayers and breakfast,       there was a prayer meeting, daring which God was especially       present. At 8 a.m. I preached from Hosea xiii. 3. This was followed       by two exhortations; then Rev. Rowley Heyland preached from, \"Buy       the truth, and sell it not.\" About two o'clock the people were       again assembled to hear the Rev. James Richardson (formerly a       lieutenant in the British Navy) from the words, \"Be ye reconciled       to God.\" His style was plain but unadorned, his reasoning clear,       and his arguments forcible. The services concluded with the       celebration of the Lord's Supper. About three hundred communicated,       sixty-two professed to have obtained the pardon of their sins, and       forty-two gave their names as desirous of becoming members of the       Methodist Society. After this, a concluding address was delivered       by the Rev. Wm. Ryerson, in which he gave particular directions to       the Methodists as subjects under the civil constitution, as members       of the Church of Christ, as parents, as children, as individuals.       He animadverted on the groundless and disingenuous aspersions that       had been thrown out through the press against Methodism, on account       of the suspected loyalty of its constitutional principles. He       warmly insisted on a vigorous observance, support, and respect for       the Civil Government, both from the beneficence of its laws and the       equity of its administration, as well as from the authority of God.       The concluding ceremony was the most affecting I ever witnessed,       especially in the affection which the people showed for their       ministers.         _May 12th._--I have this day ridden nearly thirty miles, preached       three times, and met two classes. I felt very much fatigued, yet       the Lord has given me \"strength equal to my day.\"         _May 19th._--I have been much blessed in the society of pious       friends. A part of the week I felt very sick, but was greatly       comforted by the conversation and affectionate treatment of my       kindest friend, Mrs. Smith. Since I commenced labouring for my       Master I have found fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, all       ready to supply my every want.         _May 24th._--A Camp-meeting commenced at Mount Pleasant. The       presence of both Mississauga and Mohawk Indians added greatly to       the interest of the meeting. Peter Jones addressed his people in       their own tongue; although I did not understand, I was much       affected by his fervency and pathos. He spoke in English in a       manner that astonished all present.         Another Indian Chief addressed his brethren in the Mohawk tongue. I       could not understand a word of it, but was carried away with his       pathos and energy. These Indians thanked the white people for       sending them the Gospel. He said that upwards of sixty Indians had       been converted, and could testify that God had power to forgive       sin. He, _i.e._, a young Chippewa said that the most earnest desire       and prayer of the Christian Indians was that God would drive the       horrid whiskey from their nation. It was truly affecting to see       this young man arise and testify in the presence of God and this       large assembly, that \"he had the witness in his own soul, that God       for Christ's sake had forgiven all his sins.\" The congregation was       much moved, and prayers and praises were heard in every part of the       assembly. At the close of the exercises, on the following day, the       Mohawk Chief said, \"They considered that they belonged to the       Methodist Church, as they had done all for them.\"         _May 29th._--For many days I have been cast down by a weight of       care. My Father is exceedingly anxious that I should return home,       and remain with him during his lifetime. A position in the Church       of England has presented itself, and other advantageous attractions       with regard to this world, offer themselves.[5] It makes my heart       bleed to see the anxiety of my parents. But is it duty? If they       were in want I would return to them without hesitation, but when I       consider they have everything necessary, can it be my duty to       gratify them at the expense of the cause of God? Surely if a man       may leave father and mother to join himself to a wife, how much       more reasonable _to leave all_ to join himself to the Christian       ministry. My parents are dear to me, but my duty to God is dearer       still. One thing do I desire, that I may live in the House of the       Lord for ever!         And shall I leave a Church through whose faithful instructions I       have been brought to know God, for any advantages that the entrance       to another might afford me? No, far be it from me; as I received"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24593"],[0,"The Oriental Story Book: A Collection of Tales (#10)"],[1,"story. \"Then  did you not know Bianca?\" asked he. I assured him that I had never  seen her. Valetty thereupon told me that there was a deep mystery in  the matter; that the Governor in great haste had urged my  condemnation, and that a report was current among the people, that I  had known Bianca for a long time, and had murdered her out of revenge  for her intended marriage with another. I informed him that all this  was probably true of the Red-mantle, but that I could not prove his  participation in the deed. Valetty embraced me, weeping, and promised  me to do all that he could; to save my life, if nothing more. I had  not much hope; nevertheless, I knew that my friend was a wise man, and  well acquainted with the laws, and that he would do all in his power  to preserve me.    Two long days was I in suspense; at length Valetty appeared. \"I bring  consolation, though even that is attended with sorrow. You shall live  and be free, but with the loss of a hand!\"    Overjoyed, I thanked my friend for my life. He told me that the  Governor had been inexorable, and would not once look into the matter:  that at length, however, rather than appear unjust, he had agreed, if  a similar case could be found in the annals of Florentine history,  that my penalty should be regulated by the punishment that was then  inflicted. He and his father had searched, day and night, in the old  books, and had at length found a case similar in every respect to  mine; the sentence there ran thus:--    \"He shall have his left hand cut off; his goods shall be confiscated,  and he himself banished forever!\"    Such now was my sentence, also, and I was to prepare for the painful  hour that awaited me. I will not bring before your eyes the frightful  moment, in which, at the open market-place, I laid my hand upon the  block; in which my own blood in thick streams flowed over me!    Valetty took me to his house until I had recovered, and then  generously supplied me with money for my journey, for all that I had  so laboriously acquired was confiscated to Justice. I went from  Florence to Sicily, and thence, by the first ship I could find, to  Constantinople. My hopes, which rested on the sum of money I had left  with my friend, were not disappointed. I proposed that I should live  with him--how astonished was I, when he asked why I occupied not my  own house! He told me that a strange man had, in my name, bought a  house in the quarter of the Greeks, and told the neighbors that I  would soon, myself, return. I immediately proceeded to it with my  friend, and was joyfully received by all my old acquaintances. An aged  merchant handed me a letter which the man who purchased for me had  left. I read:--    \"Zaleukos! two hands stand ready to work unceasingly, that thou mayest  not feel the loss of one. That house which thou seest and all therein  are thine, and every year shalt thou receive so much, that thou shalt  be among the rich of thy nation. Mayest thou forgive one who is more  unhappy than thyself!\"    I could guess who was the writer, and the merchant told me, in answer  to my inquiry that it was a man covered with a red cloak, whom he had  taken for a Frenchman. I knew enough to convince me that the Unknown  was not entirely devoid of generous feeling. In my new house I found  all arranged in the best style; a shop, moreover, full of wares, finer  than any I had ever had. Ten years have elapsed since then; more in  compliance with ancient custom, than because it is necessary, do I  continue to travel in foreign lands for purposes of trade, but the  land which was so fatal to me I have never seen since. Every year I  receive a thousand pieces of gold; but although it rejoices me to know  that this Unfortunate is so noble, still can his money never remove wo  from my soul, for there lives forever the heart-rending image of the  murdered Bianca!    [Illustration]           *       *       *       *       *    Thus ended the story of Zaleukos, the Grecian merchant. With great  interest had the others listened; the stranger, in particular, seemed  to be wrapt up in it: more than once he had drawn a deep sigh, and  Muley looked as if he had had tears in his eyes. No one spoke for some  time after the recital.    \"And hate you not the Unknown, who so basely cost you a noble member  of your body, and even put your life in danger?\" inquired Selim.    \"Perhaps there were hours at first,\" answered the Greek, \"in which my  heart accused him before God, of having brought this misfortune upon  me, and embittered my life; but I found consolation in the religion of  my fathers, which commanded me to love my enemies. Moreover, he  probably is more unhappy than myself.\"    \"You are a noble man!\" exclaimed Selim, cordially pressing the hand of  the Greek.    The leader of the escort, however, here interrupted their  conversation. He came with a troubled air into the tent, and told them  that they could not give themselves up to repose, for this was the  place in which Caravans were usually attacked, and his guards imagined  they had seen several horsemen in the distance.    The merchants were confounded at this intelligence. Selim, the  stranger, however, expressed wonder at their alarm, saying they were  so well escorted they need not fear a troop of Arabian robbers.    \"Yes, sir,\" rejoined to him the leader of the guard; \"were he only a  common outlaw, we could compose ourselves to rest without anxiety; but  for some time back, the frightful Orbasan has shown himself again, and  it is well to be upon our guard.\"    The stranger inquired who this Orbasan was, and Achmet, the old  merchant, answered him:--    \"Various rumors are current among the people with respect to this  wonderful man. Some hold him to be a supernatural being, because, with  only five or six men, he has frequently fallen upon a whole  encampment; others regard him as a bold Frenchman, whom misfortune has  driven into this region: out of all this, however, thus much alone is  certain, that he is an abandoned robber and highwayman.\"    \"That can you not prove,\" answered Lezah, one of the merchants.  \"Robber as he is, he is still a noble man, and such has he shown  himself to my brother, as I can relate to you. He has formed his  whole band of well-disciplined men, and as long as he marches through  the desert, no other band ventures to show itself. Moreover, he robs  not as others, but only exacts a tribute from the caravans; whoever  willingly pays this, proceeds without further danger, for Orbasan is  lord of the wilderness!\"    Thus did the travellers converse together in the tent; the guards,  however, who were stationed around the resting-place, began to become  uneasy. A tolerably large band of armed horsemen showed themselves at  the distance of half a league. They appeared to be riding straight to  the encampment; one of the guard came into the tent, to inform them  that they would probably be attacked.    [Illustration]    The merchants consulted among themselves as to what they should do,  whether to march against them, or await the attack. Achmet and the two  elder merchants inclined to the latter course; the fiery Muley,  however, and Zaleukos desired the former, and summoned the stranger to  their assistance. He, however, quietly drew forth from his girdle a  little blue cloth spangled with red stars, bound it upon a lance,  and commanded one of the slaves to plant it in front of the tent: he  would venture his life upon it, he said, that the horsemen, when they  saw this signal, would quietly march back again. Muley trusted not the  result; still the slave put out the lance in front of the tent.  Meanwhile all in the camp had seized their weapons, and were looking  upon the horsemen in eager expectation. The latter, however, appeared  to have espied the signal; they suddenly swerved from their direct  course towards the encampment, and, in a large circle, moved off to  the side.    Struck with wonder, the travellers stood some moments, gazing  alternately at the horsemen and the stranger. The latter stood in  front of the tent quite indifferently, as though nothing had happened,  looking upon the plain before him. At last Muley broke the silence.    \"Who art thou, mighty stranger,\" he exclaimed, \"that restrainest with  a glance the wild hordes of the desert?\"    \"You rate my art higher than it deserves,\" answered Selim Baruch. \"I  observed this signal when I fled from captivity; what it means, I know  not--only this much I know, that whoever travels with this sign, is  under great protection.\"    The merchants thanked the stranger, and called him their preserver;  indeed, the number of the robbers was so great, that the Caravan could  not, probably, for any length of time, have offered an effectual  resistance.    With lighter hearts they now gave themselves to sleep; and when the  sun began to sink, and the evening wind to pass over the sand-plain,  they struck their tents, and marched on. The next day they halted  safely, only one day's journey from the entrance of the desert. When  the travellers had once more collected in the large tent, Lezah, the  merchant, took up the discourse.    \"I told you, yesterday, that the dreaded Orbasan was a noble man;  permit me to prove it to you, to-day, by the relation of my brother's  adventure. My father was Cadi of Acara. He had three children; I was  the eldest, my brother and sister being much younger than myself. When  I was twenty years old, a brother of my father took me under his  protection; he made me heir to his property, on condition that I  should remain with him until his death. He however had reached an old  age, so that before two years I returned to my native land, having  known nothing, before, of the misfortune which had meanwhile fallen  upon my family, and how Allah had turned it to advantage.\"          [Illustration]    FATIMA'S DELIVERANCE.
