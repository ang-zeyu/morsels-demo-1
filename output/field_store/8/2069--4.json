[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20781"],[0,"Heidi (#10)"],[1,"  me take cod-liver oil and says that I am ill. So I must swallow my  yawns, for I hate the oil. What fun it will be now, when you learn to  read!\"    Heidi shook her head doubtfully at these prospects.    \"Everybody must learn to read, Heidi. Mr. Candidate is very patient  and will explain it all to you. You won't know what he means at first,  for it is difficult to understand him. It won't take long to learn,  though, and then you will know what he means.\"    When Miss Rottenmeier found that she was unable to recall Deta, she  came back to the children. She was in a very excited mood, for she  felt responsible for Heidi's coming and did not know how to cancel  this unfortunate step. She soon got up again to go to the dining-room,  criticising the butler and giving orders to the maid. Sebastian, not  daring to show his rage otherwise, noisily opened the folding doors.  When he went up to Clara's chair, he saw Heidi watching him intently.  At last she said: \"You look like Peter.\"    Miss Rottenmeier was horrified with this remark, and sent them all  into the dining-room. After Clara was lifted on to her chair, the  housekeeper sat down beside her. Heidi was motioned to sit opposite  the lady. In that way they were placed at the enormous table. When  Heidi saw a roll on her plate, she turned to Sebastian, and pointing  at it, asked, \"Can I have this?\" Heidi had already great confidence in  the butler, especially on account of the resemblance she had  discovered. The butler nodded, and when he saw Heidi put the bread in  her pocket, could hardly keep from laughing. He came to Heidi now with  a dish of small baked fishes. For a long time the child did not move;  then turning her eyes to the butler, she said: \"Must I eat that?\"  Sebastian nodded, but another pause ensued. \"Why don't you give it to  me?\" the child quietly asked, looking at her plate. The butler, hardly  able to keep his countenance, was told to place the dish on the table  and leave the room.    When he was gone, Miss Rottenmeier explained to Heidi with many signs  how to help herself at table. She also told her never to speak to  Sebastian unless it was important. After that the child was told how  to accost the servants and the governess. When the question came up of  how to call Clara, the older girl said, \"Of course you shall call me  Clara.\"    A great many rules followed now about behavior at all times, about the  shutting of doors and about going to bed, and a hundred other things.  Poor Heidi's eyes were closing, for she had risen at five that  morning, and leaning against her chair she fell asleep. When Miss  Rottenmeier had finished instructions, she said: \"I hope you will  remember everything, Adelheid. Did you understand me?\"    \"Heidi went to sleep a long time ago,\" said Clara, highly amused.    \"It is atrocious what I have to bear with this child,\" exclaimed Miss  Rottenmeier, ringing the bell with all her might. When the two  servants arrived, they were hardly able to rouse Heidi enough to show  her to her bed-room.          VII    MISS ROTTENMEIER HAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE DAY      When Heidi opened her eyes next morning, she did not know where she  was. She found herself on a high white bed in a spacious room. Looking  around she observed long white curtains before the windows, several  chairs, and a sofa covered with cretonne; in a corner she saw a  wash-stand with many curious things standing on it.    Suddenly Heidi remembered all the happenings of the previous day.  Jumping out of bed, she dressed in a great hurry. She was eager to  look at the sky and the ground below, as she had always done at home.  What was her disappointment when she found that the windows were too  high for her to see anything except the walls and windows opposite.  Trying to open them, she turned from one to the other, but in vain.  The poor child felt like a little bird that is placed in a glittering  cage for the first time. At last she had to resign herself, and sat  down on a low stool, thinking of the melting snow on the slopes and  the first flowers of spring that she had hailed with such delight.    Suddenly Tinette opened the door and said curtly: \"Breakfast's ready.\"    Heidi did not take this for a summons, for the maid's face was  scornful and forbidding. She was waiting patiently for what would  happen next, when Miss Rottenmeier burst into the room, saying: \"What  is the matter, Adelheid? Didn't you understand? Come to breakfast!\"    Heidi immediately followed the lady into the dining-room, where Clara  greeted her with a smile. She looked much happier than usual, for she  expected new things to happen that day. When breakfast had passed  without disturbance, the two children were allowed to go into the  library together and were soon left alone.    \"How can I see down to the ground?\" Heidi asked.    \"Open a window and peep out,\" replied Clara, amused at the question.    \"But it is impossible to open them,\" Heidi said, sadly.    \"Oh no. You can't do it and I can't help you, either, but if you ask  Sebastian he'll do it for you.\"    Heidi was relieved. The poor child had felt like a prisoner in her  room. Clara now asked Heidi what her home had been like, and Heidi  told her gladly about her life in the hut.    The tutor had arrived in the meantime, but he was not asked to go to  the study as usual. Miss Rottenmeier was very much excited about  Heidi's coming and all the complications that arose therefrom. She was  really responsible for it, having arranged everything herself. She  presented the unfortunate case before the teacher, for she wanted him  to help her to get rid of the child. Mr. Candidate, however, was  always careful of his judgments, and not afraid of teaching beginners.    When the lady saw that he would not side with her, she let him enter  the study alone, for the A,B,C held great horrors for her. While she  considered many problems, a frightful noise as of something falling  was heard in the adjoining room, followed by a cry to Sebastian for  help. Running in, she beheld a pile of books and papers on the floor,  with the table-cover on top. A black stream of ink flowed across the  length of the room. Heidi had disappeared.    \"There,\" Miss Rottenmeier exclaimed, wringing her hands. \"Everything  drenched with ink. Did such a thing ever happen before? This child  brings nothing but misfortunes on us.\"    The teacher was standing up, looking at the devastation, but Clara was  highly entertained by these events, and said: \"Heidi has not done it  on purpose and must not be punished. In her hurry to get away she  caught on the table-cover and pulled it down. I think she must never  have seen a coach in all her life, for when she heard a carriage  rumbling by, she rushed out like mad.\"    \"Didn't I tell you, Mr. Candidate, that she has no idea whatever about  behavior? She does not even know that she has to sit quiet at her  lessons. But where has she gone? What would Mr. Sesemann say if she  should run away?\"    When Miss Rottenmeier went down-stairs to look for the child, she saw  her standing at the open door, looking down the street.    \"What are you doing here? How can you run away like that?\" scolded  Miss Rottenmeier.    \"I heard the fir-trees rustle, but I can't see them and do not hear  them any more,\" replied Heidi, looking in great perplexity down the  street. The noise of the passing carriage had reminded her of the  roaring of the south-wind on the Alp.    \"Fir-trees? What nonsense! We are not in a wood. Come with me now to  see what you have done.\" When Heidi saw the devastation that she had  caused, she was greatly surprised, for she had not noticed it in her  hurry.    \"This must never happen again,\" said the lady sternly. \"You must sit  quiet at your lessons; if you get up again I shall tie you to your  chair. Do you hear me?\"    Heidi understood, and gave a promise to sit quietly during her lessons  from that time on. After the servants had straightened the room, it  was late, and there was no more time for studies. Nobody had time to  yawn that morning.    In the afternoon, while Clara was resting, Heidi was left to herself.  She planted herself in the hall and waited for the butler to come  up-stairs with the silver things. When he reached the head of the  stairs, she said to him: \"I want to ask you something.\" She saw that  the butler seemed angry, so she reassured him by saying that she did  not mean any harm.    \"All right, Miss, what is it?\"    \"My name is not Miss, why don't you call me Heidi?\"    \"Miss Rottenmeier told me to call you Miss.\"    \"Did she? Well then, it must be so. I have three names already,\"  sighed the child.    \"What can I do for you?\" asked Sebastian now.    \"Can you open a window for me?\"    \"Certainly,\" he replied.    Sebastian got a stool for Heidi, for the window-sill was too high for  her to see over. In great disappointment, Heidi turned her head away.    \"I don't see anything but a street of stone. Is it the same way on the  other side of the house?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Where do you go to look far down on everything?\"    \"On a church-tower. Do you see that one over there with the golden  dome? From there you can overlook everything.\"    Heidi immediately stepped down from the stool and ran down-stairs.  Opening the door, she found herself in the street, but she could not  see the tower any more. She wandered on from street to street, not  daring to accost any of the busy people. Passing a corner, she saw a  boy who had a barrel-organ on his back and a curious animal on his  arm. Heidi ran to him and asked: \"Where is the tower with the golden  dome?\"    \"Don't know,\" was the reply.    \"Who can tell me?\"    \"Don't know.\"    \"Can you show me another church with a tower?\"    \"Of course I can.\"    \"Then come and show me.\"    \"What are you going to give me for it?\" said the boy, holding out his  hand. Heidi had nothing in her pocket but a little flower-picture.  Clara had only given it to her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20785"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#10)"],[1,"house all de time. Sometime I lead him around  de yard a little, but not very much. Dat about de time all de slave  begin to slip out and run off.    My own pappy was name Stephany. I think he take dat name 'cause when  he little his mammy call him \"Istifani.\" Dat mean a skeleton, and he  was a skinny man. He belong to de Grayson family and I think his  master name George, but I don't know. Dey big people in de Creek, and  with de white folks too. My mammy name was Serena and she belong to  some of de Gouge family. Dey was big people in de Upper Creek, and one  de biggest men of the Gouge was name Hopoethleyoholo for his Creek  name. He was a big man and went to de North in de War and died up in  Kansas, I think. Dey say when he was a little boy he was called  Hopoethli, which mean \"good little boy\", and when he git grown he make  big speeches and dey stick on de \"yoholo.\" Dat mean \"loud whooper.\"    Dat de way de Creek made de name for young boys when I was a little  girl. When de boy git old enough de big men in de town give him a  name, and sometime later on when he git to going round wid de grown  men dey stick on some more name. If he a good talker dey sometime  stick on \"yoholo\", and iffen he make lots of jokes dey call him  \"Hadjo.\" If he is a good leader dey call him \"Imala\" and if he kind of  mean dey sometime call him \"fixigo.\"    My mammy and pappy belong to two masters, but dey live together on a  place. Dat de way de Creek slaves do lots of times. Dey work patches  and give de masters most all dey make, but dey have some for  demselves. Dey didn't have to stay on de master's place and work like  I hear de slaves of de white people and de Cherokee and Choctaw people  say dey had to do.    Maybe my pappy and mammy run off and git free, or maybeso dey buy  demselves out, but anyway dey move away some time and my mammy's  master sell me to old man Tuskaya-hiniha when I was jest a little gal.  All I have to do is stay at de house and mind de baby.    Master had a good log house and a bresh shelter out in front like all  de houses had. Like a gallery, only it had de dirt for de flo' and  bresh for de roof. Dey cook everything out in de yard in big pots, and  dey eat out in de yard too.    Dat was sho' good stuff to eat, and it make you fat too! Roast de  green corn on de ears in de ashes, and scrape off some and fry it!  Grind de dry corn or pound it up and make ash cake. Den bile de  greens--all kinds of greens from out in de woods--and chop up de pork  and de deer meat, or de wild turkey meat; maybe all of dem, in de big  pot at de same time! Fish too, and de big turtle dat lay out on de  bank!    Dey always have a pot full of sofki settin right inside de house, and  anybody eat when dey feel hungry. Anybody come on a visit, always give  'em some of de sofki. Ef dey don't take none de old man git mad, too!    When you make de sofki you pound up de corn real fine, den pour in de  water an dreen it off to git all de little skin from off'n de grain.  Den you let de grits soak and den bile it and let it stand. Sometime  you put in some pounded hickory nut meats. Dat make it real good.    I don't know whar old Master git de cloth for de clothes, less'n he  buy it. Befo' I can remember I think he had some slaves dat weave de  cloth, but when I was dar he git it at de wagon depot at Honey  Springs, I think. He go dar all de time to sell his corn, and he raise  lots of corn, too.    Dat place was on de big road, what we called de road to Texas, but it  go all de way up to de North, too. De traders stop at Honey Springs  and old Master trade corn for what he want. He git some purty checkedy  cloth one time, and everybody git a dress or a shirt made off'n it. I  have dat dress 'till I git too big for it.    Everybody dress up fine when dey is a funeral. Dey take me along to  mind de baby at two-three funerals, but I don't know who it is dat  die. De Creek sho' take on when somebody die!    Long in de night you wake up and hear a gun go off, way off yonder  somewhar. Den it go again, and den again, jest as fast as dey can ram  de load in. Dat mean somebody dead. When somebody die de men go out in  de yard and let de people know dat way. Den dey jest go back in de  house and let de fire go out, and don't even tech de dead person till  somebody git dar what has de right to tech de dead.    When somebody bad sick dey build a fire in de house, even in de  summer, and don't let it die down till dat person git well or die.  When dey die dey let de fire go out.    In de morning everybody dress up fine and go to de house whar de dead  is and stand around in de yard outside de house and don't go in.  Pretty soon along come somebody what got a right to tech and handle de  dead and dey go in. I don't know what give dem de right, but I think  dey has to go through some kind of medicine to git de right, and I  know dey has to drink de red root and purge good before dey tech de  body. When dey git de body ready dey come out and all go to de  graveyard, mostly de family graveyard, right on de place or at some of  the kinfolkses.    When dey git to de grave somebody shoots a gun at de north, den de  west, den de south, and den de east. Iffen dey had four guns dey used  'em.    Den dey put de body down in de grave and put some extra clothes in  with it and some food and a cup of coffee, maybe. Den dey takes strips  of elm bark and lays over de body till it all covered up, and den  throw in de dirt.    When de last dirt throwed on, everybody must clap dey hands and smile,  but you sho hadn't better step on any of de new dirt around de grave,  because it bring sickness right along wid you back to your own house.  Dat what dey said, anyways.    Jest soon as de grave filled up dey built a little shelter over it wid  poles like a pig pen and kiver it over wid elm bark to keep de rain  from soaking down in de new dirt.    Den everybody go back to de house and de family go in and scatter  some kind of medicine 'round de place and build a new fire. Sometime  dey feed everybody befo' dey all leave for home.    Every time dey have a funeral dey always a lot of de people say,  \"Didn't you hear de stikini squalling in de night?\" \"I hear dat  stikini all de night!\" De \"stikini\" is de screech owl, and he suppose  to tell when anybody going to die right soon. I hear lots of Creek  people say dey hear de screech owl close to de house, and sho' nuff  somebody in de family die soon.    When de big battle come at our place at Honey Springs dey jest git  through having de green corn \"busk.\" De green corn was just ripened  enough to eat. It must of been along in July.    Dat busk was jest a little busk. Dey wasn't enough men around to have  a good one. But I seen lots of big ones. Ones whar dey had all de  different kinds of \"banga.\" Dey call all de dances some kind of banga.  De chicken dance is de \"Tolosabanga\", and de \"Istifanibanga\" is de one  whar dey make lak dey is skeletons and raw heads coming to git you.    De \"Hadjobanga\" is de crazy dance, and dat is a funny one. Dey all  dance crazy and make up funny songs to go wid de dance. Everybody  think up funny songs to sing and everybody whoop and laugh all de  time.    But de worse one was de drunk dance. Dey jest dance ever whichaway, de  men and de women together, and dey wrassle and hug and carry on awful!  De good people don't dance dat one. Everybody sing about going to  somebody elses house and sleeping wid dem, and shout, \"We is all drunk  and we don't know what we doing and we ain't doing wrong 'cause we is  all drunk\" and things like dat. Sometime de bad ones leave and go to  de woods, too!    Dat kind of doing make de good people mad, and sometime dey have  killings about it. When a man catch one his women--maybeso his wife or  one of his daughters--been to de woods he catch her and beat her and  cut off de rim of her ears!    People think maybeso dat ain't so, but I know it is!    I was combing somebody's hair one time--I ain't going tell who--and  when I lift it up off'n her ears I nearly drap dead! Dar de rims cut  right off'n 'em! But she was a married woman, and I think maybeso it  happen when she was a young gal and got into it at one of dem drunk  dances.    Dem Upper Creek took de marrying kind of light anyways. Iffen de  younguns wanted to be man and wife and de old ones didn't care dey  jest went ahead and dat was about all, 'cepting some presents maybe.  But de Baptists changed dat a lot amongst de young ones.    I never forgit de day dat battle of de Civil War happen at Honey  Springs! Old Master jest had de green corn all in, and us had been  having a time gitting it in, too. Jest de women was all dat was left,  'cause de men slaves had all slipped off and left out. My uncle Abe  done got up a bunch and gone to de North wid dem to fight, but I  didn't know den whar he went. He was in dat same battle, and after de  War dey called him Abe Colonel. Most all de slaves 'round dat place  done gone off a long time before dat wid dey masters when dey go wid  old man Gouge and a man named McDaniel.    We had a big tree in de yard, and a grape vine swing in it for de  little baby \"Istidji\", and I was swinging him real early in de morning  befo' de sun up. De house set in a little patch of woods wid de field  in de back, but all out on de north side was a little open space, like  a kind of prairie. I was swinging de baby, and all at once I seen  somebody riding dis way 'cross dat prairie--jest coming a-kiting and  a-laying flat out on his hoss. When he see de house he begin to give  de war whoop, \"Eya-a-a-a-he-ah!\" When he git close to de house he  holler to git out de way 'cause dey gwine be a big fight, and old  Master start rapping wid his cane and yelling to git some grub and  blankets in de wagon right now!    We jest leave everything setting right whar it is, 'cepting putting  out de fire and grabbing all de pots and kettles. Some de nigger women  run to git de mules and"]]]
