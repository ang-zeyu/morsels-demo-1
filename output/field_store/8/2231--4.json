Quick toning, like quick development, tends to  block the shadows in the print, and if you once get bronzed shadows the  print is practically hopeless. Not quite ruined, however, as a bath in a 5  per cent solution of sodium carbonate will discharge the color and then,  if the print is faded, it may be redeveloped in an alkaline developer such  as metol-hydro. But before it is retoned the print must be thoroughly  washed, as the presence of sodium carbonate does not permit the toning  solution to do its work.    Finally, I may say that, while a bath of acetic acid and water is often  advised to stop the toning action in this method, I have never found it  necessary.    All the thin varieties of bromide paper curl badly in drying. If they are  to be kept unmounted it is well to immerse them in water to which has been  added a few drops of glycerine. This will ensure their lying flat after  drying. A solution of 2 ounces of glycerine in 25 ounces of water is  advised when it is desired to make bromides on heavy rough paper remain  flat, after drying, for book illustration and similar purposes.    If one is trying to rush through a bromide print, it can be trimmed while  wet by placing it on a sheet of stiff paper and cutting through both.    The paper will be found to cockle the mounts badly in drying. Aside from  the glue mountant, formula for which accompanies the paper, I know no  preventive except to mount the prints while dry with the dry mounting  tissue. As the paper when wet stretches one way considerably, as much as a  third of an inch on a ten- or twelve-inch length, provision must be made  in trimming, especially if mounts with centers of a given size are used.    The paper being covered with an emulsion which in warm weather is very  soft while wet, mounting is somewhat more difficult than with some of the  other papers. My method is to mount not more than half a dozen at once,  placing them face down, one on top of the other, on a glass or ferrotype  plate, blotting off the surface water and spreading the paste over the top  one in the usual way. I place this on the mount and then stretch over it  smoothly a damp handkerchief or piece of very thin rubber cloth, rubbing  the print down with my hands, seldom using the squeegee and then very  lightly. By this method abrasion of the surface seldom results and  air-bells are unknown. Owing to the strong contracting power of the paper  in drying, the mounting paste must be used freely, especially at the edges  of the print.    Apart from the methods of procedure here given, there are innumerable  modifications covering every detail of contact printing and enlarging on  bromide paper. Most of these have been given careful trial as published,  but few have quite fulfilled the expectations they created.          BOOKS.

This charming little opera had even more success than Lortzing's other  compositions; it is {44} a popular opera in the best sense of the word.  Lortzing ought to have made his fortune by it, for it was soon claimed  by every stage.  He had composed it for Christmas 1837 and in the year  1838 every street-organ played its principal melodies.  But the  directors paid miserable sums to the lucky composer.  (F. e. a copy of  the work cost him 25 thalers, while he did not get more than 30 to 50  thalers from the directors.)    The libretto was composed by Lortzing himself; he took it out of an old  comedy.    Peter, Emperor of Russia, has taken service on the wharfs of Saardam as  simple ship-carpenter under the assumed name of Peter Michaelow.  Among  his companions is another Peter, named Ivanow, a Russian renegade, who  has fallen in love with Mary, the niece of the burgomaster Van Bett.    The two Peters being countrymen and fearing discovery, have become  friendly, but Ivanow instinctively feeling his friend's superiority, is  jealous of him, and Mary, a little coquette, nourishes his passion.    Meanwhile the ambassadors of France and England, each of whom wishes  for a special connection with the Czar of Russia, have discovered where  he must be, and both bribe the conceited simpleton Van Bett, who tries  to find out the real Peter.    He assembles the people, but there are many Peters amongst them, though  only two strangers.  He asks them whence they come, then takes aside  Peter Ivanow, cross-questioning him in vain as to what he wishes to  know.    {45}    At last, being aware of Peter's love for Mary, he gives him some hope  of gaining her hand, and obtains in exchange a promise from the young  man, to confess his secret in presence of the foreign nobleman.--The  cunning French ambassador, the Marquis de Chateauneuf, has easily found  out the Czar and gained his purpose, while the phlegmatic English Lord,  falsely directed by the burgomaster, is still in transaction with  Ivanow.  All this takes place during a rural festivity, where the  Marquis notwithstanding the claims upon his attention finds time to  court yet pretty Mary, exciting Ivanow's hate and jealousy.  Ivanow  with difficulty plays the role of Czar, which personage he is supposed  to be as well by Lord Syndham as by Van Bett.  He well knows that he  deserves punishment, if he is found out on either side.  The  burgomaster, getting more and more confused, and fearing himself  surrounded by spies and cheats, examines one of the strangers after the  other, and is of course confounded to hear their high-flown names; at  last he seizes the two Peters, but is deterred from his purpose by the  two ambassadors.  They are now joined by a third, the Russian General  Lefort, who comes to call back his Sovereign to his own country.  In  the third act Van Bett has prepared a solemn demonstration of fealty  for the supposed Czar, whom he still mistakes for the real one, while  the real Czar has found means to go on board of his ship with the  Marquis and Lefort.--Before taking farewell, he promises a pass-port to  Ivanow, who is very dubious as to what will become of {46} him.  Meanwhile Van Bett approaches him with his procession to do homage, but  during his long and confused speech cannon-shots are heard and an usher  announces, that Peter Michaelow is about to sail away with a large  crew.  The back-ground opens and shows the port with the Czar's ship.  Everybody bursts into shouts \"Long live the Czar!\" and Ivanow, opening  the paper, which his high-born friend left to him, reads that the Czar  grants him pardon for his desertion and bestows upon him a considerable  sum of money.          LA DAME BLANCHE.    Comic Opera in three acts by BOIELDIEU.    Text by SCRIBE.      Boieldieu is for the French almost what Mozart was for the German.  This opera especially may be called classic, so deliberate and careful  is its execution.    The \"Lady in white\" is the chef-d'oeuvre of all comic operas in French,  as Mozart's Figaro is in German.  The success of this opera, whose  composer and whose poet were equally liked and esteemed in Paris was  enormous, and since then it has never lost its attraction.    The scene is laid in Scotland, the subject being taken from Walter  Scott's romance: \"Guy Mannering\".    George Brown, the hero of the opera, a young lieutenant in English  service, visits Scotland.  He is hospitably received by a tenant of the  late Count Avenel, who has been dead for some years.  When {47} he  arrives, the baptism of the tenant's youngest child is just being  celebrated, and seeing that they lack a godfather, he good-naturedly  consents to take the vacant place.    Seeing the old castle of the Avenels, he asks for its history, and the  young wife Jenny tells him that according to the traditions of the  place it is haunted by a ghost, as is the case in almost every old  castle.  This apparition is called the \"White Lady\", but unlike other  ghosts she is good, protecting her sex against fickle men.  All the  people around believe firmly in her and pretend to have seen her  themselves.  In the castle there exists a statue which bears the name  of this benevolent genius, and in it the old Lord has hidden treasures.  His steward Gaveston, a rogue, who has taken away the only son of the  Count in the child's earliest days, brings the castle with all its  acres to public sale, hoping to gain it for himself.    He has a charming ward, named Anna.  It is she, who sometimes plays the  part of the white Lady.  She has summoned the young tenant Dickson, who  is sincerely devoted to her, into the castle, and the young man though  full of fear, yet dare not disobey the ghostly commands.    George Brown, thirsting for a good adventure, and disbelieving in the  ghost-story, declares that he will go in Dickson's place.    In the second act George, who has found entrance into the castle, calls  for the white Lady, who appears in the shape of Anna.  She believes  that {48} Dickson is before her and she reveals her secret to him,  imploring his help against her false guardian Gaveston, who means to  rob the true and only heir of his property.  She knows that the missing  son of the Avenels is living, and she has given a promise to the dying  Countess, to defend his rights against the rapacious Gaveston.  George  gives his hand to the pretended ghost in token of fidelity, and the  warm and soft hand which clasps his, awakes tender feelings in him.  On  the following morning Dickson and his wife Jenny are full of curiosity  about George's visit, but he does not breathe a word of his secret.    The sale of the castle as previously announced is to begin, and Dickson  has been empowered beforehand by all the neighboring farmers, to bid  the highest price, in order not to let it fall into the hands of the  hateful Gaveston.  They bid higher and higher, but at length Dickson  stops, unable to go farther.  Gaveston feels assured of his triumph,  when George Brown, recalling his vow to the white Lady, advances  boldly, bidding one thousand pounds more.  Anna is beside him, in the  shape of the spectre, and George obediently bids on, till the castle is  his for the price of three hundred thousand pounds.  Gaveston in a  perfect fury, swears avenge himself on the adventurer, who is to pay  the sum in the afternoon.  Should he prove unable to do so, he shall be  put into prison.  George, who firmly believes in the help of his  genius, is quietly confident, and meanwhile makes an inspection of the  castle.  {49} Wandering through the vast rooms, dim recollections arise  in him, and hearing the minstrel's song of the Avenels, he all at once  remembers and finishes the romance, which he heard in his childhood.    The afternoon comes and with it Mac-Irton, the justice of peace.  He  wants the money, and George begs to await the white Lady, who promised  her help.  Anna appears, bringing the treasure of the Avenels hidden in  the statue, and with them some documents, which prove the just claims  of Edwin Count Avenel.  This long lost Count she recognizes in George  Brown, whose identity with the playmate of her youth she had found out  the night before.  Gaveston approaches full of wrath to tear aside the  ghost's white veil, and sees his own ward, Anna.    The happy owner of castle and country holds firm to the promise which  he gave the white Lady, and offers hand and heart to the faithful Anna,  who has loved him from her childhood.          IL DEMONIO.    Fantastic Opera in three acts by ANTON RUBINSTEIN    Text after the Russian of ALFRED OFFERMANN.      This opera of the great Russian musician has an entirely national  character.  The great features of Rubinstein's work are most fertile  imagination and an immense power of expression, which however sometimes  almost passes the permitted bounds, although the forms are perfectly  mastered and the fanciful subject is well calculated to afford it room  {50} for play.  It is taken from the celebrated poem of Lermontoff, and  it treats of the devices, by which Satan seeks to ensnare the immortal  souls on earth.    The plot is laid in Grusia in the Caucasus.    The first scene represents a wild and lonely country, in the raging  storm voices are heard of good and bad spirits alternately.  The  Arch-Fiend appears, weary of everything, even of his power.  He curses  the world; in vain he is warned by the Angel of Light to cease his  strife against Heaven; the Demon's only satisfaction lies in opposition  to and battle with all that is loving and good.    He sees Tamara, daughter of Prince Gudal, who expects her bridegroom,  the Prince of Sinodal, and full of"]]]
