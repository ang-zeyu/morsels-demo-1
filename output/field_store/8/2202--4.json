There is a \"Canzone Amorosa\" of deep fervor, with  interjections of \"Io t'amo!\" and \"Amore\" (which has the excellent  authority of Beethoven's Sonata, op. 81, with its \"Lebe wohl\"). The  suite ends deliciously with a night scene in Venice, beginning with a  choral \"Ave Maria,\" and ending with a campanella of the utmost  delicacy.    After a year in Venice Nevin made Paris his home for a year,  returning to America then, where he has since remained.    Though he has dabbled somewhat in orchestration, he has been wisely  devoting his genius, with an almost Chopin-like singleness of mind, to  songs and piano pieces. His piano works are what would be called  _morceaux_. He has never written a sonata, or anything approaching the  classical forms, nearer than a gavotte or two. He is very modern in  his harmonies, the favorite colors on his palette being the warmer  keys, which are constantly blended enharmonically. He \"swims in a sea  of tone,\" being particularly fond of those suspensions and inversions  in which the intervals of the second clash passionately, strongly  compelling resolution. For all his gracefulness and lyricism, he makes  a sturdy and constant use of dissonance; in his song \"Herbstgefuehl\"  the dissonance is fearlessly defiant of conventions.    [Music:        ... Rose      Loeset lebenssatt.      Sich, das letzte lose,      Bleiche Blumenblatt.      Goldenes entfaerben,      Schleicht sich durch den Hain,      Auch vergeh'n und sterben,      Daeucht mir suess zu sein.        ... failing,      From the rose unbound,      Falls, its life exhaling,      Dead upon the ground.      Golden colors flying,      Slant from tree to tree;      Such release and dying,      Sweet would seem to me.    Copyright, 1889, by G. Schirmer, Jr.    A FRAGMENT FROM \"HERBSTGEFUeHL.\"]    Nevin's songs, whose only littleness is in their length, though  treated with notable individuality, are founded in principle on the  _Lieder_ of Schumann and Franz. That is to say, they are written with  a high poetical feeling inspired by the verses they sing, and, while  melodious enough to justify them as lyrics, yet are near enough to  impassioned recitative to do justice to the words on which they are  built. Nevin is also an enthusiastic devotee of the position these  masters, after Schubert, took on the question of the accompaniment.  This is no longer a slavish thumping of a few chords, now and then,  to keep the voice on the key, with outbursts of real expression only  at the interludes; but it is a free instrumental composition with a  meaning of its own and an integral value, truly accompanying, not  merely supporting and serving, the voice. Indeed, one of Nevin's best  songs,--\"Lehn deine Wang an meine Wang,\"--is actually little more than  a vocal accompaniment to a piano solo. His accompaniments are always  richly colored and generally individualized with a strong  contramelody, a descending chromatic scale in octaves making an  especially frequent appearance. Design, though not classical, is  always present and distinct.    Nevin's first published work was a modest \"Serenade,\" with a neat  touch of syncopation, which he wrote at the age of eighteen. His  \"Sketch-Book,\" a collection of thirteen songs and piano pieces found  an immediate and remarkable sale that has removed the ban formerly  existing over books of native compositions.    The contents of the \"Sketch-Book\" display unusual versatility. It  opens with a bright gavotte, in which adherence to the classic spirit  compels a certain reminiscence of tone. The second piece, a song, \"I'  the Wondrous Month o' May,\" has such a springtide fire and frenzy in  the turbulent accompaniment, and such a fervent reiterance, that it  becomes, in my opinion, the best of all the settings of this poem of  Heine's, not excluding even Schumann's or that of Franz. The \"Love  Song,\" though a piano solo, is in reality a duet between two lovers.  It is to me finer than Henselt's perfect \"Liebeslied,\" possibly  because the ravishing sweetness of the woman's voice answering the  sombre plea of the man gives it a double claim on the heart. The  setting of \"Du bist wie eine Blume,\" however, hardly does justice  either to Heine's poem, or to Nevin's art. The \"Serenade\" is an  original bit of work, but the song, \"Oh, that We Two were Maying!\"  with a voice in the accompaniment making it the duet it should  be,--that song can have no higher praise than this, that it is the  complete, the final musical fulfilment of one of the rarest lyrics in  our language. A striking contrast to the keen white regret of this  song is the setting of a group of \"Children's Songs,\" by Robert Louis  Stevenson. Nevin's child-songs have a peculiar and charming place. He  has not been stingy of either his abundant art or his abundant  humanity in writing them. They include four of Stevenson's, the best  being the captivating \"In Winter I get up at Night,\" and a setting of  Eugene Field's \"Little Boy Blue,\" in which a trumpet figure is used  with delicate pathos.    Nevin's third opus included three exquisite songs of a pastoral  nature, Goethe's rollicking \"One Spring Morning\" having an immense  sale. Opus 5 contained five songs, of which the ecstatic \"'Twas April\"  reached the largest popularity. Possibly the smallest sale was enjoyed  by \"Herbstgefuehl.\" Many years have not availed to shake my allegiance  to this song, as one of the noblest songs in the world's music. It is  to me, in all soberness, as great as the greatest of the _Lieder_ of  Schubert, Schumann or Franz. In \"Herbstgefuehl\" (or \"Autumn-mood\")  Gerok's superb poem bewails the death of the leaves and the failing of  the year, and cries out in sympathy:        \"Such release and dying      Sweet would seem to me!\"    Deeper passion and wilder despair could not be crowded into so short a  song, and the whole brief tragedy is wrought with a grandeur and  climax positively epic. It is a flash of sheer genius.    Three piano duets make up opus 6; and other charming works, songs,  piano pieces, and violin solos, kept pouring from a pen whose apparent  ease concealed a vast deal of studious labor, until the lucky 13, the  opus-number of a bundle of \"Water Scenes,\" brought Nevin the greatest  popularity of all, thanks largely to \"Narcissus,\" which has been as  much thrummed and whistled as any topical song.    Of the other \"Water Scenes,\" there is a shimmering \"Dragon Fly,\" a  monody, \"Ophelia,\" with a pedal-point of two periods on the tonic, and  a fluent \"Barcarolle\" with a deal of high-colored virtuosity.    His book \"In Arcady\" (1892) contains pastoral scenes, notably an  infectious romp that deserves its legend, \"They danced as though they  never would grow old.\" The next year his opus 20, \"A Book of Songs,\"  was published. It contains, among other things of merit, a lullaby,  called \"Sleep, Little Tulip,\" with a remarkably artistic and effective  pedal-point on two notes (the submediant and the dominant) sustained  through the entire song with a fine fidelity to the words and the  lullaby spirit; a \"Nocturne\" in which Nevin has revealed an  unsuspected voluptuousness in Mr. Aldrich' little lyric, and has  written a song of irresistible climaxes. The two songs, \"Dites-Moi\"  and \"In der Nacht,\" each so completely true to the idiom of the  language of its poem, are typical of Nevin's cosmopolitanism, referred  to before. This same unusual ability is seen in his piano pieces as  well as in his songs. He knows the difference between a _chanson_ and  a _Lied_, and in \"Rechte Zeit\" has written with truth to German  soldierliness as he has been sympathetic with French nuance in \"Le  Vase Brise,\" the effective song \"Mon Desire,\" which in profile  suggests Saint-Saens' familiar Delilah-song, the striking \"Chanson des  Lavandieres\" and \"Rapelle-Toi,\" one of Nevin's most elaborate works,  in which Alfred De Musset's verse is splendidly set with much  enharmonious color. Very Italian, too, is the \"Serenade\" with  accompaniment a la mandolin, which is the most fetching number in the  suite \"Captive Memories,\" published in 1899.    Nevin has also put many an English song to music, notably the deeply  sincere \"At Twilight,\" the strenuous lilt \"In a Bower,\" Bourdillon's  beautiful lyric, \"Before the Daybreak,\" the smooth and unhackneyed  treatment of the difficult stanza of \"'Twas April,\" that popular song,  \"One Spring Morning,\" which has not yet had all the charm sung out of  it, and two songs with obbligati for violin and 'cello, \"Deep in the  Rose's Glowing Heart\" and \"Doris,\" a song with a finely studied  accompaniment and an aroma of Theokritos.    A suite for the piano is \"En Passant,\" published in 1899; it ranges  from a stately old dance, \"At Fontainebleau,\" to \"Napoli,\" a furious  tarantelle with effective _glissandi_; \"In Dreamland\" is a most  delicious revery with an odd repetition that is not preludatory, but  thematic. The suite ends with the most poetic scene of all, \"At Home,\"  which makes a tone poem of Richard Hovey's word-picture of a June  night in Washington. The depicting of the Southern moonlight-balm,  with its interlude of a distant and drowsy negro quartette, reminds  one pleasantly of Chopin's Nocturne (op. 37, No. 1), with its  intermezzo of choric monks, though the composition is Nevin's very own  in spirit and treatment.    In addition to the works catalogued, Nevin has written a pantomime for  piano and orchestra to the libretto of that virtuoso in English, Vance  Thompson; it was called \"Lady Floriane's Dream,\" and was given in New  York in 1898. Nevin has also a cantata in making.    It needs no very intimate acquaintance with Nevin's music to see that  it is not based on an adoration for counterpoint as an end.

Even my  habits of sobriety, moderate eating, and early rising, were not, until  I left off using them, sufficient to give me that complete health which  I have since had.    I do not undertake to prescribe for others exactly; but, I do say, that  to pour down regularly, every day, a quart or two of _warm liquid_,  whether under the name of tea, coffee, soup, grog, or any thing else,  is greatly injurious to health. However, at present, what I have to  represent to _you, is the great deduction which they make, from your  power of being useful_, and also from your _power to husband your  income_, whatever it may be, and from whatever source arising. These  things _cost_ something; and wo to him who forgets, or never knows,  till he pays it, how large a bill they make--in the course of a year.    How much to be desired is it, that mankind would return once more, to  the use of no other drink than that pure beverage which nature prepared  for the sole drink of man! So long as we are in health, we need no  other; nay, we have no right to any other. It is the testimony of all,  or almost all whose testimony is worth having, that water is the best  known drink. But if water is _better_ than all others, _all others  are_, of course, _worse than water_.    As to food and drink _generally_, let me say in conclusion, that  _simplicity_ is the grand point to aim at. Water, we have seen, is the  sole drink of man; but there is a great variety of food provided for  his sustenance. He is allowed to select from this immense variety,  those kinds, which the experience of mankind generally, combined and  compared with his own, show to be _most useful_. He can _live_ on  almost any thing. Still there is a _choice_ to be observed, and so far  as his circumstances permit, he is in duty bound to exercise that  choice. God has said by his servant Paul; 'Whether ye eat or drink, or  whatsoever ye do,' &c.    What we believe to be most useful to us, though at first disagreeable,  we may soon learn to prefer. Our habits, then, should be early formed.  We should always remember these two rules, however. 1st. The fewer  different articles of food used at any one meal, the better; however  excellent in their nature those may be which are left untasted. 2.  Never eat a moment longer than the food, if well masticated, actually  _revives_ and _refreshes_ you. The moment it makes you feel heavy or  dull, or palls upon the taste, _you have passed the line of safety_.      SECTION X. _On Suppers._    _Suppers_, properly so called, are confined, in a considerable degree,  to cities; and I was at first in doubt whether I should do as much good  by giving my voice against them, as I should of mischief by spreading  through the country the knowledge of a wretched practice. But farther  reflection has convinced me that I ought to offer my sentiments on this  subject.    By suppers, I mean a fourth meal, just before going to bed. Individuals  who have eaten quite as many times during the day as nature requires,  and who take their tea, and perhaps a little bread and butter, at six,  must go at nine or ten, they think, and eat another hearty meal. Some  make it the most luxurious repast of the day.    Now many of our plain country people do not know that such a practice  exists. They often eat too much, it is true, at _their_ third meal, but  their active habits and pure air enable them to digest it better than  their city brethren could. Besides, their third meal never comes so  late, by several hours, as the suppers of cities and towns.    Our English ancestors, 200 years ago, on both sides of the Atlantic,  dined at eleven, took tea early, and had no suppers. So it was with the  Jews of old, one of the healthiest nations that ever lived beyond the  Mediterranean. They knew nothing of our modern dinners at three or  four, and suppers at nine, ten, or eleven.    But not to 'take something late at night with the rest,' would at  present be regarded as 'vulgar,' and who could endure it? Here, I  confess, I tremble for some of my readers, whose lot it is to be cast  in the city, lest they should, in this single instance, hesitate to  'take advice.' But I will hope for better things.    If you would give your stomach a season of repose, as well as the rest  of your system; if you would sleep soundly, and either dream not at  all, or have your dreams pleasant ones; if you would rise in the  morning with your head clear, and free from pain, and your mouth clean  and sweet, instead of being parched, and foul; if you would unite your  voice--in spirit at least--with the voices of praise to the Creator,  which ascend every where unless it be from the dwellings of creatures  that should be men,--if, in one word, you would lengthen your lives  several years, and increase the enjoyment of the last thirty years 33  per cent. without diminishing that of the first forty, then I beg of  you to abstain from _suppers_!    I am acquainted with one individual, who partly from a conviction of  the injury to himself, and partly from a general detestation of the  practice, not only abstains from every thing of the kind, but from long  observation of its effects, goes to the other extreme, and seldom takes  even a _third_ meal. And I know of no evil which arises from it. On the  contrary, I believe that, for him, no course could be better. Be that  as it may, adult individuals should never eat more than three times a  day, nor should they ever partake of any food, solid or liquid, within  three or four hours of the period of retiring to rest.    But if eating ordinary suppers is pernicious, what shall we say of the  practice which some indulge who aspire to be pillars in church or  state, with others of pretensions less lofty, of going to certain  eating houses, at a very late hour, and spending a considerable portion  of the night--not in eating, merely, but in quaffing poisonous  draughts, and spreading noxious fumes, and uttering language and songs  which better become the inmates of Pandemonium, than those of the  counting-house, the college, or the chapel! If there be within the  limits of any of our cities or towns, scenes which answer to this  horrid picture, let 'it not be told in Gath, or published in the  streets of Askelon,' lest the fiends of the pit should rejoice;--lest  the demons of darkness should triumph.          [3] I have occasionally seen four or five persons in constant        employ, solely to supply the wants of a family of the same        number, whose health, _collectively_, required an amount of        physical labor adequate to their own wants.      SECTION XI. _On Dress._    The object of dress is fourfold: 1st. It is designed as a covering; 2d.  As a means of warmth; 3d. As a defence; 4th. To improve our appearance.    These purposes of dress should all be considered; and in the order here  presented. That dress, which best answers all these purposes combined,  both as respects the material and the _form_ or _fashion_, is  unquestionably the best and most appropriate. It is certainly true that  the impressions which a person's first appearance makes upon the minds  of those around him are deep and permanent, and the subject should  receive a measure of our attention, on this account. It is only a  slight tax which we pay for the benefits of living in civilized  society. When, however, we sacrifice every thing else to appearance, we  commit a very great error. We make that first in point of importance,  which ought to be fourth.    Let your dress be as cheap as may be without shabbiness, and endeavor  to be neither first nor last in a fashion. Think more about the  cleanliness, than the gloss or texture of your clothes. Be always as  clean as your occupation will permit; but never for one moment believe  that any human being, who has good sense, will love or respect you  _merely_ on account of a fine or costly coat.    Extravagance in the haunting of _play-houses_, in _horses_, in every  thing else, is to be avoided, but in young men, extravagance in _dress_  particularly. This sort of extravagance, this waste of money on the  decoration of the body, arises solely from vanity, and from vanity of  the most contemptible sort. It arises from the notion, that all the  people in the street, for instance, will be _looking at you_, as soon  as you walk out; and that they will, in a greater or less degree, think  the better of you on account of your fine dress.    Never was a notion more false. Many sensible people, that happen to see  you, will think nothing at all about you: those who are filled with the  same vain notion as you are, will perceive your attempt to impose on  them, and despise it. Rich people will wholly disregard you, and you  will be envied and hated by those who have the same vanity that you  have, without the means of gratifying it.    Dress should be suited, in some measure, to our condition. A surgeon or  physician need not dress exactly like a carpenter; but, there is no  reason why any body should dress in a very _expensive_ manner. It is a  great mistake to suppose, that they derive any _advantage_ from  exterior decoration.    For after all, men are estimated by other _men_ according to their  capacity and willingness to be in some way or other _useful_; and,  though, with the foolish and vain part of _women_, fine clothes  frequently do something, yet the greater part of the sex are much too  penetrating to draw their conclusions solely from the outside  appearance. They look deeper, and find other criterions whereby to  judge. Even if fine clothes should obtain you a wife, will they bring  you, in that wife, _frugality_, _good sense_, and that kind of  attachment which is likely to be lasting?    Natural beauty of person is quite another thing: this always has, it  always will and must have, some weight even with men, and great weight  with women. But, this does "]]]
