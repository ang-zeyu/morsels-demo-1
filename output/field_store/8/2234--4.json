Donning  overalls, and with ordinary rule in his hip pocket--as against the  slide-rule with which he had worked out his theoretical calculations  during his college years--he went to work at whatever was assigned him  as a task by his superiors--shop foremen, assistant superintendent,  occasionally an engineer from the office.    This young man did many things. He helped to assemble turbine parts;  carried word of petty alterations to the proper officials: assisted in  the work of making tests; made detailed reports on the machine's  performance; screwed up and backed off nuts; in short, got very well  acquainted with the steam-turbine as manufactured by this company. He  knew the fundamentals of machine construction, and an understanding of  the details of this particular type of turbine therefore came easy to  him. He worked shop hours, carried his lunch in a box, changed his  overalls every Monday like a veteran. Usually his overalls more than  needed changing, because he was not afraid of the grease and grime with  which he came into contact throughout the day. He liked the work and  went to it like a dog to a bone. He was applying in a practical way what  he had learned in college of a theoretical nature, and finding the thing  of amazing interest.    He made progress. In time his work was brought to the attention of the  chief engineer, and one day, when the president of the company, who was  also an inventor of national repute and responsible for the design of  the turbine being manufactured by the organization, wanted to make  certain bold changes in the design, the chief engineer sent for the  young engineer whose work in college in thermodynamics had won for him  certain honors, with the result that our hero found himself presently  seated opposite the president at a table in the latter's office, engaged  in working out calculations on his slide-rule--calculations beyond the  powers of the president, because he was not a heavy theoretician. This  call was a big advance indeed, for it marked him as a man of promise--a  \"comer\"--in the concern. The president liked the ease with which the  young engineer \"got\" him in the matter of the proposed changes, and  quite before either realized it both were talking freely, exchanging  ideas, in the field of turbine construction generally. The young man  unconsciously was driving home the fact that he was a capable engineer,  one who, while still lacking in broad experience, was nevertheless  possessed of the proper attitude toward engineering as a whole to compel  the interest and attention of his superior.    The young man eventually was sent out upon the road as an erecting man.  In this work he discovered certain operating faults in the design, and,  reporting these faults to the home office, observed that not a few were  remedied in subsequent designs. He moved about the country from place to  place, setting up and operating steam-turbines, until there came the  blissful day when he was called back to join the engineering staff in  work covering design. Laying aside his overalls, he emerged as a crisp  young engineer in a linen collar and nifty cravat--although not till  later did he don a cream-colored waistcoat--and thereafter his hours  were seven instead of nine. With a desk and a stenographer he entered  upon work of a somewhat statistical character. He followed the designs  of rival companies as best he could through their advertising and  articles covering their respective designs appearing in the technical  journals, and about this time also applied for admission, and was  granted it, in the foremost engineering society embracing his particular  branch of the profession. He was still making progress.    Likewise, he was rapidly becoming an expert in the field of  steam-turbines. His work in the shop, together with his experience on  the road, both as an erecting man and operating engineer, had eminently  fitted him for valuable service in the home office as an engineer  overseeing design. His work in charge of design, where his knowledge of  what had given service both good and bad in details of construction  while he was in the field, was extremely valuable to the designer  himself, was rapidly rounding him out as a steam-turbine man. His salary  had gone up apace with his progress; he had met the right girl at a club  dance in the suburban town where he had taken modest quarters; he was  rapidly headed toward success both as an engineer and a citizen. He had  been out of school probably six years, and was still a very young man,  with all the world practically before him.    One day he was asked by the chief engineer of the concern to journey to  New York, and read a paper before his engineering society at one of the  regular annual meetings, on the subject of thermodynamics in its  relation to the company's own product--the turbine. He tipped over his  chair in his eagerness to get out of the office and on the train. He  realized the importance of this opportunity. He was to appear before his  fellow-engineers--the best and most capable and prominent in the  profession--and to appear as an authority on his subject! The thing was  another step forward. He prepared a paper, basing it on his six years'  experience in steam-turbines, and when he reached New York had something  of value to tell his brother engineers. The meeting was held in the  afternoon, and, dressing for the part, he stepped out upon the platform  before a gathering of some eight or nine hundred engineers and delivered  himself of his subject with credit to himself and to his organization.  Not only that. In the rebuttal, when engineers seated in the auditorium  rose to confound him with questions--engineers representing rival  turbine concerns--he proved himself quick at the bat and more than once  confounded those who would confound him.    He was making his mark on the industrial times. His paper was reviewed  in the technical journals and almost overnight our young hero found  himself recognized as an authority in his chosen branch. He was sought  out for other articles by technical editors, his associates in the home  plant generously commended him for his work; his salary received another  elevation; he called on the girl that night and had her set the date.  Then he plugged for salvation--further knowledge as a turbine  man--harder than ever. Having won the full confidence of the officials  of the company by this time, he was given free voice in all matters  having to do with the design of their product, and shortly after his  first little boy was born was promoted to the position of assistant  chief engineer. He served in this capacity for two years, and then,  realizing that he had gone as far up in the organization as it was  physically possible to go, owing to the fact that the chief engineer was  the president's sister's husband--or something like that--he accepted an  offer from one of the rival concerns manufacturing turbines and entered  the organization as chief engineer at a salary too big to mention. Our  young friend had at last arrived.    Yet his success was not quite complete, nor will it be complete, until  he sets up, as he assuredly will some day, as a consulting engineer.  When he at last does this, when he swings out his shingle to the breeze,  he will then have attained to the maximum of possible success as an  engineer. Already recognized as being possessed of a fine discrimination  in matters of engineering moment, especially in thermodynamics as  related to turbines, he has but gone up in channels early laid out for  him, and indicated to him, in his college days. His direction even then  was clearly marked. All he had to do, and all he did do, was to develop  himself in this single direction. He did nothing that would be  impossible to any other engineering graduate. Merely he hewed to the  line--persisted in remaining in the one branch of the game--met with his  reward in time just as any young man would meet with it. There was  nothing of phenomenal character, nothing of the genius, revealed in what  he did. His way is open to all. And it is a way both worthy and  admirable, for to-day this engineer stands high in his profession and is  meeting with financial reward in keeping with his position among  engineers.    There you have in the tracing of one engineer's progress to success  precisely what constitutes engineering success. The details may differ,  but the principles and the rewards will be the same, whether you enter  upon civil or mechanical or mining or electrical engineering. Success in  engineering constitutes certain satisfactory money rewards and an even  more satisfactory recognition by one's associates and fellows. Success  in anything is that. A man must work for them, however. There never was  and never will be a rainbow path to the heights. Toil and an abiding  faith in one's own capabilities--these make for success. Success makes  for happiness, and happiness, as everybody knows, is all there is to  this life.    I wish all men happiness.          XII    THE PERSONAL SIDE      As to the personal side of engineering as a career, if it would be a  source of gratification to you to know that you were helping to build up  the civilized world, then you should enter the engineering profession.  Because men differ in their ideas as to what constitutes a full  life--some placing ideal homes above all things, some seeking  continuously diversified sources of pleasure, some wanting nothing  better than a fine library or freedom to cultivate taste in pictures,  some wishing only to surround themselves with interesting people, some  wanting nothing but an accumulation of dollars, some wishing but for  power of control over others--all men would not find the full life in  engineering. Yet the majority of men would, because the profession holds  that which would appeal to a great many different"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24700"],[0,"A History of French Literature (#10)"],[1,"de  Saint Louis_ have been lost; we possess none earlier than the close  of the fourteenth century; but by the learning and skill of a modern  editor the text has been substantially established.    We must not expect from Joinville precision of chronology or  exactitude in the details of military operations. His recollections  crowd upon him; he does not marshal them by power of intellect, but  abandons himself to the delights of memory. He is a frank, amiable,  spirited talker, who has much to tell; he succeeds in giving us two  admirable portraits--his own and that of the King; and unconsciously  he conveys into his narrative both the chivalric spirit of his time,  and a sense of those prosaic realities which tempered the ideals of  chivalry. What his eyes had rested on lives in his memory, with all  its picturesque features, all its lines and colours, undimmed by time;  and his curious eyes had been open to things great and small. He  appears as a brave soldier, but, he confesses, capable of mortal fear;  sincerely devout, but not made for martyrdom; zealous for his master's  cause, but not naturally a chaser of rainbow dreams; one who enjoys  good cheer, who prefers his wine unallayed with water, who loves  splendid attire, who thinks longingly of his pleasant chateau, and  the children awaiting his return; one who will decline future  crusading, and who believes that a man of station may serve God well  by remaining in his own fields among his humble dependants. But  Joinville felt deeply the attraction of a nature more under the  control of high, ideal motives than was his own; he would not himself  wash the feet of the poor; he would rather commit thirty mortal sins  than be a leper; but a kingly saint may touch heights of piety which  are unattainable by himself. And, at the same time, he makes us feel  that Louis is not the less a man because he is a saint. Certain human  infirmities of temper are his; yet his magnanimity, his sense of  justice, his ardent devotion, his charity, his pure self-surrender  are made so sensible to us as we read the record of Joinville that  we are willing to subscribe to the sentence of Voltaire: \"It is not  given to man to carry virtue to a higher point.\"    During the fourteenth century the higher spirit of feudalism  declined; the old faith and the old chivalry were suffering a decay;  the bourgeoisie grew in power and sought for instruction; it was an  age of prose, in which learning was passing to the laity, or was  adapted to their uses. Yet, while the inner life of chivalry failed  day by day, and self-interest took the place of heroic self-surrender,  the external pomp and decoration of the feudal world became more  brilliant than ever. War was a trade practised from motives of vulgar  cupidity; but it was adorned with splendour, and had a show of  gallantry. The presenter in literature of this glittering spectacle  is the historian JEAN FROISSART. Born in 1338, at Valenciennes, of  bourgeois parents, Froissart, at the age of twenty-two, a  disappointed lover, a tonsured clerk, and already a poet, journeyed  to London, with his manuscript on the battle of Poitiers as an offering  to his countrywoman, Queen Philippa of Hainault. For nearly five years  he was the _ditteur_ of the Queen, a sharer in the life of the court,  but attracted before all else to those \"ancient knights and squires  who had taken part in feats of arms, and could speak of them rightly.\"  His patroness encouraged Froissart's historical inquiries. In the  _Chroniques_ of Jean le Bel, canon of Liege, he found material ready  to his hand, and freely appropriated it in many of his most admirable  pages; but he also travelled much through England and Scotland, noting  everything that impressed his imagination, and gathering with  delight the testimony of those who had themselves been actors in the  events of the past quarter of a century. He accompanied the Black  Prince to Aquitaine, and, later, the Duke of Clarence to Milan. The  death of Queen Philippa, in 1369, was ruinous to his prospects. For  a time he supported himself as a trader in his native place. Then  other patrons, kinsfolk of the Queen, came to his aid. The first  revised redaction of the first book of his Chronicles was his chief  occupation while cure of Lestinnes; it is a record of events from  1325 to the death of Edward III., and its brilliant narrative of events  still recent or contemporary insured its popularity with  aristocratic readers. Under the influence of Queen Philippa's  brother-in-law, Robert of Namur, it is English in its sympathies and  admirations. Unhappily Froissart was afterwards moved by his patron,  Gui de Blois, to rehandle the book in the French interest; and once  again in his old age his work was recast with a view to effacing the  large debt which he owed to his predecessor, Jean le Bel. The first  redaction is, however, that which won and retained the general favour.  If his patron induced Froissart to wrong his earlier work, he made  amends, for it is to Gui de Blois that we owe the last three books  of the history, which bring the tale of events down to the  assassination of Richard II. Still the cure of Lestinnes and the canon  of Chimai pursued his early method of travel--to the court of Gaston,  Count of Foix, to Flanders, to England--ever eager in his  interrogation of witnesses. It is believed that he lived to the close  of 1404, but the date of his death is uncertain.    Froissart as a poet wrote gracefully in the conventional modes of  his time. His vast romance _Meliador_, to which Wenceslas, Duke of  Brabant, contributed the lyric part--famous in its day, long lost  and recently recovered--is a construction of external marvels and  splendours which lacks the inner life of imaginative faith. But as  a brilliant scene-painter Froissart the chronicler is unsurpassed.  His chronology, even his topography, cannot be trusted as exact; he  is credulous rather than critical; he does not always test or control  the statements of his informants; he is misled by their prejudices  and passions; he views all things from the aristocratic standpoint;  the life of the common people does not interest him; he has no sense  of their wrongs, and little pity for their sufferings; he does not  study the deeper causes of events; he is almost incapable of  reflection; he has little historical sagacity; he accepts  appearances without caring to interpret their meanings. But what a  vivid picture he presents of the external aspects of fourteenth-century  life! What a joy he has in adventure! What an eye for the picturesque!  What movement, what colour! What a dramatic--or should we say  theatrical?--feeling for life and action! Much, indeed, of the  vividness of Froissart's narrative may be due to the eye-witnesses  from whom he had obtained information; but genius was needed to  preserve--perhaps to enhance--the animation of their recitals. If he  understood his own age imperfectly, he depicted its outward appearance  with incomparable skill; and though his moral sense was shallow, and  his knowledge of character far from profound, he painted portraits  which live in the imagination of his readers.    The fifteenth century is rich in historical writings of every  kind--compilations of general history, domestic chronicles, such as  the _Livre des Faits du bon Messire Jean le Maingre, dit Bouciquaut_,  official chronicles both of the French and Burgundian parties,  journals and memoirs. The Burgundian Enguerrand de Monstrelet was  a lesser Froissart, faithful, laborious, a transcriber of documents,  but without his predecessor's genius. On the French side the so-called  _Chronique Scandaleuse_, by Jean de Roye, a Parisian of the time of  Louis XI., to some extent redeems the mediocrity of the writers of  his party.    In PHILIPPE DE COMMINES we meet the last chronicler of the Middle  Ages, and the first of modern historians. Born about 1445, in Flanders,  of the family of Van den Clyte, Commines, whose parents died early,  received a scanty education; but if he knew no Latin, his acquaintance  with modern languages served him well. At first in the service of  Charles the Bold, in 1472 he passed over to the cause of Louis XI.  His treason to the Duke may be almost described as inevitable; for  Commines could not attach himself to violence and folly, and was  naturally drawn to the counsels of civil prudence. The bargain was  as profitable to his new master as to the servant. On the King's death  came a reverse of fortune for Commines: for eight months he was cramped  in the iron cage; during two years he remained a prisoner in the  Conciergerie (1487-89), with enforced leisure to think of the  preparation of his _Memoires_.[3] Again the sunshine of royal favour  returned; he followed Charles VIII. to Italy, and was engaged in  diplomatic service at Venice. In 1511 he died.    [Footnote 3: Books I.-VI., written 1488-94; Books VII., VIII.,  written 1494-95.]    The _Memoires_ of Commines were composed as a body of material for  a projected history of Louis XI. by Archbishop Angelo Cato; the writer,  apparently in all sincerity, hoped that his unlearned French might  thus be translated into Latin, the language of scholars; happily we  possess the Memoirs as they left their author's mind. And, though  Commines rather hides than thrusts to view his own personality, every  page betrays the presence of a remarkable intellect. He was no artist  either in imaginative design or literary execution; he was before  all else a thinker, a student of political phenomena, a searcher after  the causes of events, an analyst of motives, a psychologist of  individual character and of the temper of peoples, and, after a  fashion, a moralist in his interpretation of history. He cared little,  or not at all, for the coloured surface of life; his chief concern  is to seize the master motive by which men and events are ruled, to"]]]
