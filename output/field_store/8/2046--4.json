A  success in every way, they were nevertheless described by the press as  a battle of the sexes, a free-for-all struggle in which shrill-voiced  women in the bloomer costume were supported by a few \"male Betties.\"  The New York _Sun_ spoke of Susan's \"ungainly form rigged out in the  bloomer costume and provoking the thoughtless to laughter and ridicule  by her very motions on the platform.\"[38] Untruth was piled upon  untruth until dignified ladylike Susan with her earnest pleasing  appearance was caricatured into everything a woman should not be. Less  courageous temperance women now began to wonder whether they ought to  associate with such a strong-minded woman as Susan B. Anthony.    There were rumblings of discontent when the Woman's State Temperance  Society met in Rochester for its next annual convention in June 1853,  and Susan and Mrs. Stanton were roundly criticized because they did  not confine themselves to the subject of temperance and talked too  much about woman's rights. Not only was Mrs. Stanton defeated for the  presidency but the by-laws were amended to make men eligible as  officers. Men had been barred when the first by-laws were drafted by  Susan and Mrs. Stanton because they wished to make the society a  proving ground for women and were convinced that men holding office  would take over the management, and women, less experienced, would  yield to their wishes.    This now proved to be the case, as the men began to do all the  talking, calling for a new name for the society and insisting that all  discussion of woman's rights be ruled out. In the face of this clear  indication of a determined new policy which few of the women wished to  resist, Susan refused re-election as secretary and both she and Mrs.  Stanton resigned.    This was Susan's first experience with intrigue and her first rebuff  by women whom she had sincerely tried to serve. Defeated, hurt, and  uncertain, she poured out her disappointment in troubled letters to  Elizabeth Stanton, who, with the steadying touch of an older sister,  roused her with the challenge, \"We have other and bigger fish to  fry.\"[39]           *       *       *       *       *    A few months later, Susan was off on a new crusade as she attended the  state teachers' convention in Rochester. Of the five hundred teachers  present, two-thirds were women, but there was not the slightest  recognition of their presence. They filled the back seats of  Corinthian Hall, forming an inert background for the vocal minority,  the men. After sitting through two days' sessions and growing more and  more impatient as not one woman raised her voice, Susan listened, as  long as she could endure it, to a lengthy debate on the question, \"Why  the profession of teacher is not as much respected as that of lawyer,  doctor, or minister.\"[40] Then she rose to her feet and in a  low-pitched, clear voice addressed the chairman.    At the sound of a woman's voice, an astonished rustle of excitement  swept through the audience, and when the chairman, Charles Davies,  Professor of Mathematics at West Point, had recovered from his  surprise, he patronizingly asked, \"What will the lady have?\"    \"I wish, sir, to speak to the subject under discussion,\" she bravely  replied.    Turning to the men in the front row, Professor Davies then asked,  \"What is the pleasure of the convention?\"    \"I move that she be heard,\" shouted an unexpected champion. Another  seconded the motion. After a lengthy debate during which Susan stood  patiently waiting, the men finally voted their approval by a small  majority, and Professor Davies, a bit taken aback, announced, \"The  lady may speak.\"    \"It seems to me, gentlemen,\" Susan began, \"that none of you quite  comprehend the cause of the disrespect of which you complain. Do you  not see that so long as society says woman is incompetent to be a  lawyer, minister, or doctor, but has ample ability to be a teacher,  every man of you who chooses this profession tacitly acknowledges that  he has no more brains than a woman? And this, too, is the reason that  teaching is a less lucrative profession; as here men must compete with  the cheap labor of woman. Would you exalt your profession, exalt those  who labor with you. Would you make it more lucrative, increase the  salaries of the women engaged in the noble work of educating our  future Presidents, Senators, and Congressmen.\"    For a moment after this bombshell, there was complete silence. Then  three men rushed down the aisle to congratulate her, telling her she  had pluck, that she had hit the nail on the head, but the women near  by glanced scornfully at her, murmuring, \"Who can that creature be?\"    Susan, however, had started a few women thinking and questioning, and  the next morning, Professor Davies, resplendent in his buff vest and  blue coat with brass buttons, opened the convention with an  explanation. \"I have been asked,\" he said, \"why no provisions have  been made for female lecturers before this association and why ladies  are not appointed on committees. I will answer.\" Then, in flowery  metaphor, he assured them that he would not think of dragging women  from their pedestals into the dust.    \"Beautiful, beautiful,\" murmured the women in the back rows, but Mrs.  Northrup of Rochester offered resolutions recognizing the right of  women teachers to share in all the privileges and deliberations of the  organization and calling attention to the inadequate salaries women  teachers received. These resolutions were kept before the meeting by a  determined group and finally adopted. Susan also offered the name of  Emma Willard as a candidate for vice-president, thinking the  successful retired principal of the Troy Female Seminary, now  interested in improving the public schools, might also be willing to  lend a hand in improving the status of women in this educational  organization. Mrs. Willard, however, declined the nomination, refusing  to be drawn into Susan's rebellion.[41] Susan, nevertheless, left the  convention satisfied that she had driven an entering wedge into  Professor Davies' male stronghold, and she continued battering at  this stronghold whenever she had an opportunity. She meant to put  women in office and to win approval for coeducation and equal pay.           *       *       *       *       *    Teachers' conventions, however, were only a minor part of her new  crusade, plans for which were still simmering in her mind and  developing from day to day. Going back to many of the towns where she  had held temperance meetings, she found that most of the societies she  had organized had disbanded because women lacked the money to engage  speakers or to subscribe to temperance papers. If they were married,  they had no money of their own and no right to any interest outside  their homes, unless their husbands consented.    Discouraged, she wrote in her diary, \"As I passed from town to town I  was made to feel the great evil of woman's entire dependency upon man  for the necessary means to aid on any and every reform movement.  Though I had long admitted the wrong, I never until this time so fully  took in the grand idea of pecuniary and personal independence. It  matters not how overflowing with benevolence toward suffering humanity  may be the heart of woman, it avails nothing so long as she possesses  not the power to act in accordance with these promptings. Woman must  have a purse of her own, and how can this be, so long as the _Wife_ is  denied the right to her individual and joint earnings. Reflections  like these, caused me to see and really feel that there was no true  freedom for Woman without the possession of all her property rights,  and that these rights could be obtained through legislation only, and  so, the sooner the demand was made of the Legislature, the sooner  would we be likely to obtain them.\"[42]      FOOTNOTES:    [33] Harper, _Anthony_, I, p. 65.

A PURSE OF HER OWN      The next important step in winning further property rights for women,  it seemed to Susan, was to hold a woman's rights convention in the  conservative capital city of Albany. This was definitely a challenge  and she at once turned to Elizabeth Stanton for counsel. Somehow she  must persuade Mrs. Stanton to find time in spite of her many household  cares to prepare a speech for the convention and for presentation to  the legislature. As eager as Susan to free women from unjust property  laws, Mrs. Stanton asked only that Susan get a good lawyer, and one  sympathetic to the cause, to look up New York State's very worst laws  affecting women.[43] She could think and philosophize while she was  baking and sewing, she assured Susan, but she had no time for  research. Susan produced the facts for Mrs. Stanton, and while she  worked on the speech, Susan went from door to door during the cold  blustery days of December and January 1854 to get signatures on her  petitions for married women's property rights and woman suffrage. Some  of the women signed, but more of them slammed the door in her face,  declaring indignantly that they had all the rights they wanted.

In his sermon on \"Married  Life\" he says: \"Know therefore that marriage is an outward thing, like  any other worldly business. Just as I may eat, drink, sleep, walk,  ride, buy, speak, and bargain with a heathen, a Jew, a Turk, or a  heretic, so may I also be and remain married to such an one, and I  care not one jot for the fool's laws which forbid it.... A heathen is  just as much man or woman, well and shapely made by God, as St. Peter,  St. Paul, or St. Lucia.\" Nor did he shrink from applying his views to  particular cases, as is instanced by his correspondence with Philip  von Hessen, whose constitution appears to have required more than one  wife. He here lays down explicitly the doctrine that polygamy and  concubinage are not forbidden to Christians, though, in his advice to  Philip, he adds the _caveat_ that he should keep the matter dark to  the end that offence might not be given. \"For,\" says he, \"it matters  not, provided one's conscience is right, what others say.\" In one of  his sermons on the Pentateuch[5] we find the words: \"It is not  forbidden that a man have more than one wife. I would not forbid it  to-day, albeit I would not advise it.... Yet neither would I condemn  it.\" Other opinions on the nature of the sexual relation were equally  broad; for in one of his writings on monastic celibacy his words  plainly indicate his belief that chastity, no more than other fleshly  mortifications, was to be considered a divine ordinance for all men or  women. In an address to the clergy he says: \"A woman not possessed of  high and rare grace can no more abstain from a man than from eating,  drinking, sleeping, or other natural function. Likewise a man cannot  abstain from a woman. The reason is that it is as deeply implanted in  our nature to breed children as it is to eat and drink.\"[6] The worthy  Janssen observes in a scandalized tone that Luther, as regards certain  matters relating to married life, \"gave expression to principles  before unheard of in Christian Europe\";[7] and the British  Nonconformist of to-day, if he reads these \"immoral\" opinions of the  hero of the Reformation, will be disposed to echo the sentiments of  the Ultramontane historian.    The relation of the Reformation to the \"New Learning\" was in Germany  not unlike that which existed in the other northern countries of  Europe, and notably in England. Whilst the hostility of the latter to  the mediaeval Church was very marked, and it was hence disposed to  regard the religious Reformation as an ally, this had not proceeded  very far before the tendency of the Renaissance spirit was to side  with Catholicism against the new theology and dogma, as merely  destructive and hostile to culture. The men of the Humanist movement  were for the most part Free-thinkers, and it was with them that  free-thought first appeared in modern Europe. They therefore had  little sympathy with the narrow bigotry of religious reformers, and  preferred to remain in touch with the Church, whose then loose and  tolerant Catholicism gave freer play to intellectual speculations,  provided they steered clear of overt theological heterodoxy, than the  newer systems, which, taking theology _au grand serieux_, tended to  regard profane art and learning as more or less superfluous, and spent  their whole time in theological wrangles. Nevertheless, there were not  wanting men who, influenced at first by the revival of learning, ended  by throwing themselves entirely into the Reformation movement, though  in these cases they were usually actuated rather by their hatred of  the Catholic hierarchy than by any positive religious sentiment.    Of such men Ulrich von Hutten, the descendant of an ancient and  influential knightly family, was a noteworthy example. After having  already acquired fame as the author of a series of skits in the new  Latin and other works of classical scholarship, being also well known  as the ardent supporter of Reuchlin in his dispute with the Church,  and as the friend and correspondent of the central Humanist figure of  the time, Erasmus, he watched with absorbing interest the movement  which Luther had inaugurated. Six months after the nailing of the  theses at Wittenberg, he writes enthusiastically to a friend  respecting the growing ferment in ecclesiastical matters, evidently  regarding the new movement as a Kilkenny-cat fight. \"The leaders,\" he  says, \"are bold and hot, full of courage and zeal. Now they shout and  cheer, now they lament and bewail, as loud as they can. They have  lately set themselves to write; the printers are getting enough to do.  Propositions, corollaries, conclusions, and articles are being sold.  For this alone I hope they will mutually destroy each other.\" \"A few  days ago a monk was telling me what was going on in Saxony, to which I  replied: 'Devour each other in order that ye in turn may be devoured  (_sic_).' Pray Heaven that our enemies may fight each other to the  bitter end, and by their obstinacy extinguish each other.\"    Thus it will be seen that Hutten regarded the Reformation in its  earlier stages as merely a monkish squabble, and failed to see the  tremendous upheaval of all the old landmarks of ecclesiastical  domination which was immanent in it. So soon, however, as he perceived  its real significance, he threw himself wholly into the movement. It  must not be forgotten, moreover, that, although Hutten's zeal for  Humanism made him welcome any attempt to overthrow the power of the  clergy and the monks, he had also an eminently political motive for  his action in what was, in some respects, the main object of his life,  viz. to rescue the \"knighthood,\" or smaller nobility, from having  their independence crushed out by the growing powers of the princes of  the empire. Probably more than one-third of the manors were held by  ecclesiastical dignitaries, so that anything which threatened their  possessions and privileges seemed to strike a blow at the very  foundations of the Imperial system. Hutten hoped that the new  doctrines would set the princes by the ears all round; and that then,  by allying themselves with the reforming party, the knighthood might  succeed in retaining the privileges which still remained to them, but  were rapidly slipping away, and might even regain some of those which  had been already lost. It was not till later, however, that Hutten saw  matters in this light. He was, at the time the above letter was  written, in the service of the Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz, the  leading favourer of the New Learning amongst the prince-prelates, and  it was mainly from the Humanist standpoint that he regarded the  beginnings of the Reformation. After leaving the service of the  archbishop he struck up a personal friendship with Luther, instigated  thereto by his political chief, Franz von Sickingen, the leader of the  knighthood, from whom he probably received the first intimation of the  importance of the new movement to their common cause.    When, in 1520, the young Emperor, Charles V, was crowned at Aachen,  Luther's party, as well as the knighthood, expected that considerable  changes would result in a sense favourable to their position from the  presumed pliability of the new head of the empire. His youth, it was  supposed, would make him more sympathetic to the newer spirit which  was rapidly developing itself; and it is true that about the time of  his election Charles had shown a transient favour to the \"recalcitrant  monk.\" It would appear, however, that this was only for the purpose of  frightening the Pope into abandoning his declared intention of  abolishing the Inquisition in Spain, then regarded as one of the  mainstays of the royal power, and still more to exercise pressure upon  him, in order that he should facilitate Charles's designs on the  Milanese territory. Once these objects were attained, he was just as  ready to oblige the Pope by suppressing the new anti-Papal movement as  he might possibly otherwise have been to have favoured it with a view  to humbling the only serious rival to his dominion in the empire.    Immediately after his coronation he proceeded to Cologne, and convoked  by Imperial edict a Reichstag at Worms for the following 27th of  January, 1521. The proceedings of this famous Reichstag have been  unfortunately so identified with the edict against Luther that the  other important matters which were there discussed have almost fallen  into oblivion. At least two other questions were dealt with, however,  which are significant of the changes that were then taking place. The  first was the rehabilitation and strengthening of the Imperial  Governing Council (_Reichsregiment_), whose functions under Maximilian  had been little more than nominal. There was at first a feeling  amongst the States in favour of transferring all authority to it, even  during the residence of the Emperor in the empire; and in the end,  while having granted to it complete power during his absence, it  practically retained very much of this power when he was present. In  constitution it was very similar to the French \"Parliaments,\" and,  like them, was principally composed of learned jurists, four being  elected by the Emperor and the remainder by the estates. The character  and the great powers of this council, extending even to ecclesiastical  matters during the ensuing years, undoubtedly did much to hasten on  the substitution of the civil law for the older customary or common  law, a matter which we shall consider more in detail later on. The  financial condition of the empire was also considered; and it here  first became evident that the dislocation of economic conditions,  which had begun with the century, would render an enormously increased  taxation necessary to maintain the Imperial authority, amounting to  five times as much as had previously been required.
