One day, in following a porcupine to see where he was going, I found a  narrow path running for a few hundred yards along the side of the cliff,  just over where the salmon loved to lie, and not more than thirty feet  above the swift rush of water. I went there with my rod and, without  attempting to cast, dropped my fly into the current and paid out from my  reel. When the line straightened I raised the rod's tip and set my fly  dancing and skittering across the surface to an eddy behind a great  rock. In a flash I had raised and struck a twenty-five pound fish; and  in another flash he had gone straight downstream in the current, where  from my precarious seat I could not control him. Down he went, leaping  wildly high out of water, in a glorious rush, till all my line buzzed  out of the reel, down to the very knot at the bottom, and the leader  snapped as if it had been made of spider's web.    I reeled in sadly, debating with myself the unanswerable question of how  I should ever have reached down thirty feet to gaff my salmon, had I  played him to a standstill. Then, because human nature is weak, I put on  a stronger, double leader and dropped another fly into the current. I  might not get my salmon; but it was worth the price of fly and leader  just to raise him from the deeps and see his terrific rush downstream,  jumping, jumping, as if the witch of Endor were astride of his tail in  lieu of her broomstick.    A lively young grilse plunged headlong at the second fly and, thanks to  my strong leader, I played him out in the current and led him  listlessly, all the jump and fight gone out of him, to the foot of the  cliff. There was no apparent way to get down; so, taking my line in  hand, I began to lift him bodily up. He came easily enough till his tail  cleared the water; then the wiggling, jerky strain was too much. The fly  pulled out, and he vanished with a final swirl and slap of his broad  tail to tell me how big he was.    Just below me a bowlder lifted its head and shoulders out of the  swirling current. With the canoe line I might easily let myself down to  that rock and make sure of my next fish. Getting back would be harder;  but salmon are worth some trouble; so I left my rod and started back to  camp for the stout rope that lay coiled in the bow of my canoe. It was  late afternoon and I was hurrying along the path, giving chief heed to  my feet in the ticklish walking, with the cliff above and the river  below, when a loud _Hoowuff!_ brought me up with a shock. There at a  turn in the path, not ten yards ahead, stood a huge bear, calling  unmistakable halt, and blocking me in as completely as if the mountain  had toppled over before me.    There was no time to think; the shock and scare were too great. I just  gasped _Hoowuff!_ instinctively, as the bear had shot it out of his deep  lungs a moment before, and stood stock-still, as he was doing. He was  startled as well as I. That was the only thing that I was sure about.    I suppose that in each of our heads at first there was just one thought:  \"I'm in a fix; how shall I get out?\" And in his training or mine there  was absolutely nothing to suggest an immediate answer. He was anxious,  evidently, to go on. Something, a mate perhaps, must be calling him up  river; else he would have whirled and vanished at the first alarm. But  how far might he presume on the big animal's timidity who stood before  him blocking the way? That was his question, plainly enough. Had I been  a moment sooner, or he a moment later, we would have met squarely at the  turn; he would have clinched with me in sudden blind ferocity, and that  would have been the end of one of us. As it was he saw me coming  heedlessly and, being peaceably inclined, had stopped me with his sharp  _Hoowuff!_ before I should get too near. There was no snarl or growl, no  savageness in his expression; only intense wonder and questioning in the  look which fastened upon my face and seemed to bore its way through, to  find out just what I was thinking.    I met his eyes squarely with mine and held them, which was perhaps the  most sensible thing I could have done; though it was all unconscious on  my part. In the brief moment that followed I did a lot of thinking.  There was no escape, up or down; I must go on or turn back. If I jumped  forward with a yell, as I had done before under different circumstances,  would he not rush at me savagely, as all wild creatures do when  cornered? No, the time for that had passed with the first instant of our  meeting. The bluff would now be too apparent; it must be done without  hesitation, or not at all. On the other hand, if I turned back he would  follow me to the end of the ledge, growing bolder as he came on; and  beyond that it was dangerous walking, where he had all the advantage and  all the knowledge of his ground. Besides, it was late, and I wanted a  salmon for my supper.    I have wondered since how much of this hesitation he understood; and how  he came to the conclusion, which he certainly reached, that I meant him  no harm, but only wanted to get on and was not disposed to give him the  path. All the while I looked at him steadily, until his eyes began to  lose their intentness. My hand slipped back and gripped the handle of my  hunting knife. Some slight confidence came with the feel of the heavy  weapon; though I would certainly have gone over the cliff and taken my  chances in the current, rather than have closed with him, with all his  enormous strength, in that narrow place. Suddenly his eyes wavered from  mine; he swung his head to look down and up; and I knew instantly that I  had won the first move--and the path also, if I could keep my nerve.    I advanced a step or two very quietly, still looking at him steadily.  There was a suggestion of white teeth under his wrinkled chops; but he  turned his head to look back over the way he had come, and presently he  disappeared. It was only for a moment; then his nose and eyes were poked  cautiously by the corner of rock. He was peeking to see if I were still  there. When the nose vanished again I stole forward to the turn and  found him just ahead, looking down the cliff to see if there were any  other way below.    He was uneasy now; a low, whining growl came floating up the path. Then  I sat down on a rock, squarely in his way, and for the first time some  faint suggestion of the humor of the situation gave me a bit of  consolation. I began to talk to him, not humorously, but as if he were a  Scotchman and open only to argument. \"You're in a fix, Mooween, a  terrible fix,\" I kept saying softly; \"but if you had only stayed at home  till twilight, as a bear ought to do, we should be happy now, both of  us. You have put me in a fix, too, you see; and now you've just got to  get me out of it. I'm not going back. I don't know the path as well as  you do. Besides, it will be dark soon, and I should probably break my  neck. It's a shame, Mooween, to put any gentleman in such a fix as I am  in this minute, just by your blundering carelessness. Why didn't you  smell me anyway, as any but a fool bear would have done, and take some  other path over the mountain? Why don't you climb that spruce now and  get out of the way?\"    I have noticed that all wild animals grow uneasy at the sound of the  human voice, speaking however quietly. There is in it something deep,  unknown, mysterious beyond all their powers of comprehension; and they  go away from it quickly when they can. I have a theory also that all  animals, wild and domestic, understand more of our mental attitude than  we give them credit for; and the theory gains rather than loses strength  whenever I think of Mooween on that narrow pass. I can see him now,  turning, twisting uneasily, and the half-timid look in his eyes as they  met mine furtively, as if ashamed; and again the low, troubled whine  comes floating up the path and mingles with the rush and murmur of the  salmon pool below.    A bear hates to be outdone quite as much as a fox does. If you catch him  in a trap, he seldom growls or fights or resists, as lynx and otter and  almost all other wild creatures do. He has outwitted you and shown his  superiority so often that he is utterly overwhelmed and crushed when you  find him, at last, helpless and outdone. He seems to forget all his  great strength, all his frightful power of teeth and claws. He just lays  his head down between his paws, turns his eyes aside, and refuses to  look at you or to let you see how ashamed he is. That is what you are  chiefly conscious of, nine times out of ten, when you find a bear or a  fox held fast in your trap; and something of that was certainly in  Mooween's look and actions now, as I sat there in his path enjoying his  confusion.    Near him a spruce tree sprang out of the rocks and reached upward to a  ledge far above. Slowly he raised himself against this, but turned to  look at me again sitting quietly in his own path--that he could no  longer consider his--and smiling at his discomfiture as I remember how  ashamed he is to be outdone. Then an electric shock seemed to hoist him  out of the trail. He shot up the tree in a succession of nervous, jerky  jumps, rising with astonishing speed for so huge a creature, smashing  the little branches, ripping the rough bark with his great claws,  sending down a clattering shower of chips and dust behind him, till he  reached the level of the ledge above and sprang out upon it; where he  stopped and looked down to see what I would do next. And there he  stayed, his great head hanging over the edge of the rock, looking at me  intently till I rose and went quietly down the trail.    It was morning when I came back to the salmon pool. Unlike the mossy  forest floor, the hard rock bore no signs to tell me--what I was most  curious to know--whether he came down the tree or found some other way  over the mountain.

There is a sufficient excuse for this kind of treatment in the fact that  the branches do not require much depth, and the plums will look all the  better for a little more. The depth of the background will thus vary,  say between 3/16 in. at the branches and 3/8 in. at the plums. The  branches are supposed to be perfectly level from end to end, that is,  they lie parallel to the surface of the wood, but of course curve about  in the other direction. The leaves, on the other hand, are supposed to  be somewhat rounded and falling away toward their sides and points in  places. The vein in the center of the leaves may be done with a parting  tool, as well as the serrations at the edge, or the latter may perhaps  be more surely nicked out with a chisel, after the leaves have received  their shapes, the leaves being made to appear as if one side was higher  than the other, and as though their points, in some cases, touched the  background, while in others the base may be the lowest part. The twigs  coming out from the branches to support the plums should be somewhat  like this in section, and should lie along the curve of the background,  and be in themselves rounded, as in Fig. 18, see section _a a_. The  bottom of the panel shows a bevel instead of a hollow border: this will  serve to distinguish it as a starting-point for the little branches  which appear to emerge from it like trees out of the ground. The plums  should be carved by first cutting them down in outline to the  background, as A, Fig. 19. Then the wood should be removed from the edge  all round, to form the rounded surface. To do this, first take the large  gouge, No. 2, and with its hollow side to the wood, cut off the top,  from about its middle to one end, and reversing the process do the same  with the other side. Then it will appear something like B (Fig. 19).  The remainder must be shaped with any tool which will do it best. There  is no royal road to the production of these rounded forms, but probably  gouge No. 1 will do the most of it.    [Illustration: Fig. 18.]    [Illustration: Fig. 19.]    Here it may be observed that the fewer tools used the better, as if many  are used there is always a risk of unpleasant facets at the places where  the various marks join each other. Before you try the plums, or apples,  or other rounded fruit which you may have in your design, it would be as  well to experiment with one on a piece of spare wood in order to decide  upon the most suitable tools. The stems or branches may be done with  flat gouge No. 1, or the flat or corner chisel. A very delicate twist or  spiral tendency in their upward growth will greatly improve their  appearance, a mere faceting produced by a flat gouge or chisel will do  this; anything is better than a mere round and bare surface, which has a  tendency to look doughy. The little circular mark on the end of the plum  (call it a plum, although that fruit has no such thing) is done by  pressing gouge No. 7 into the wood first, with the handle rather near  the surface of the wood, and afterward at a higher inclination, this  taking out a tiny chip of a circular shape and leaving a V-shaped  groove.    Now I am going to continue the subject of my last lecture, in order to  impress upon you the importance of suiting your subject to the  conditions demanded by the laws of technique and light. Practise with  the tools must go hand in hand with the education of the head if good  results are to be expected; nor must it be left wholly to hand and eye  if you are to avoid the pitfalls which lie in wait for the unwary  mechanic.          CHAPTER X    THE PATTERNED BACKGROUND           Importance of Formal Pattern as an Aid to Visibility--Pattern and       Free Rendering Compared--First Impressions Lasting--Medieval Choice       of Natural Forms Governed by a Question of Pattern.      [Illustration: FIG. 20.]    By a comparison of the piece of Byzantine sculpture, Fig. 20, with the  more elaborate treatment of foliage shown in Fig. 21, from late Gothic  capitals, in Southwell Minster, it will be seen how an increasing desire  for imitative resemblance has taken the place of a patterned foundation,  and how, in consequence, the background is no longer discernible as a  contrasting form. The Byzantine design is, of course, little more than a  pattern with sunk holes for a background, and it is in marble; but those  holes are arranged in a distinct and orderly fashion. The other is a  highly realistic treatment of foliage, the likeness to nature being so  fully developed that some of these groups have veins on the _backs_ of  the leaves. The question for the moment is this, which of the two  extremes gives the clearest account of itself at a distance? I think  there can be little doubt that the more formal arrangement bears this  test better than the other, and this, too, in face of the fact that it  has cost much less labor to produce. Remember we are only now  considering the question of _visibility_ in the design. You may like the  undefined and suggestive masses into which the leaves and shadows of the  Southwell one group themselves better than the unbending severity of the  lines in the other, but that is not the point at present. You can not  _see_ the actual work which produces that mystery, and I may point out  to you, that what is here romantic and pleasing on account of its  changeful and informal shadows, is on the verge of becoming mere  bewildering confusion; a tendency which always accompanies attempts to  imitate the accidental or informal grouping of leaves, so common to  their natural state. The further this is carried, the less is it  possible to govern the forms of the background pattern; they become less  discernible as contrasting _forms_, although they may be very  interesting as elements of mystery and suggestive of things not actually  seen. The consequence is a loss of power in producing that  instantaneous impression of harmony which is one of the secrets of  effectiveness in carving. This is greatly owing to the constant change  of plane demanded by an imitative treatment, as well as the want of  formality in its background. The lack of restful monotony in this  respect creates confusion in the lights, making a closer inspection  necessary in order to discern the beauty of the work. Now the human  imagination loves surprises, and never wholly forgives the artist who,  failing to administer a pleasant shock, invites it to come forward and  examine the details of his work in order to see how well they are  executed.    [Illustration: FIG. 21.]    These examples, you will say, are from architectural details which have  nothing to do with wood-carving. On the contrary, the same laws govern  all manner of sculpturesque composition--scale or material making no  difference whatever. A sculptured marble frieze or a carved ivory  snuff-box may be equally censurable as being either so bare that they  verge on baldness and want of interest, or so elaborate that they look  like layers of fungus.    Do not imagine that I am urging any preference for a Byzantine treatment  in your work; to do so would be as foolish as to ask you to don  medieval costume while at work, or assume the speech and manners of the  tenth century. It would be just as ridiculous on your part to affect a  bias which was not natural to you. I am, however, strongly convinced  that in the choice of natural forms and their arrangement into orderly  masses (more particularly with regard to their appearance in silhouette  against the ground), and also in the matter of an economical use of  detail, we have much to learn from the carvers who preceded the  fourteenth century. They thoroughly understood and appreciated the value  of the light which fell upon their work, and in designing it arranged  every detail with the object of reflecting as much of it as possible. To  this end, their work was always calculated for its best effects to be  seen at a fairly distant point of view; and to make sure that it would  be both visible and coherent, seen from that point, they insisted upon  some easily understood pattern which gave the key to the whole at a  glance. To make a pattern of this kind is not such an easy matter as it  looks. The forms of the background spaces are the complementary parts of  the design, and are just as important as those of the solid portions;  it takes them both to make a good design.    Now I believe you must have had enough of this subject for the present,  more especially as you have not yet begun to feel the extraordinary  difficulty of making up your mind as to what is and what is not fit for  the carver's uses among the boundless examples of beauty spread out for  our choice by Dame Nature.    Meantime, I do not want you to run away with the impression that when  you have mastered the principles of economy in detail and an orderly  disposition of background, that you have therefore learned all that is  necessary in order to go on turning out design after design with the  ease of a cook making pancakes according to a recipe. You will find by  experience, I think, that all such principles are good for is to enforce  clearness of utterance, so to speak, and to remind you that it is light  you are dealing with, and upon which you must depend for all effects;  also that the power of vision is limited. Acting upon them is quite  another matter, and one, I am afraid, in which no one can help you  much. You may be counseled as to the best and most practical mode of  expressing your ideas, but those thoughts and inventions must come from  yourself if they are to be worth having.    In my next lecture I shall have something to say with regard to  originality of design, but now we must take up our tools again and begin  work upon another exercise.
