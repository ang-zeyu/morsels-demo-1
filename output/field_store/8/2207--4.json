[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23959"],[0,"Fair Italy, the Riviera and Monte Carlo (#10)"],[1,"the  left are the beautiful mountain gardens of Dr. Bennett. By his kind  courtesy, all visitors are welcome to roam about therein, though, of  course, within certain hours. It is indeed a wonderful example of  botanical skill combined with excellent taste. Every inch of ground,  right up to the rocky mountain-side, is turned to advantage, for the  production both of the most lovely flowers and ferns and also for  miniature aqueducts and water-courses to refresh them. I have never  before seen a collection of flowers, ferns, and trees brought to so  great a perfection under such difficulties. All are most systematically  named and classified.    A little further on is the Italian custom-house, picturesquely situated  on a promontory, and commanding a very fine view of the sea and  surrounding country. Every person and vehicle has here to undergo the  usual delightful examination by the custom-house officials. This is the  high-road to Ventimiglia and Genoa, and a _high_ road indeed it is,  running right along the edge of the cliff, forming a most magnificent  drive, and commanding grand views.    Not far from here is the residence, with its superb gardens, of Mr.  Hanbury. Some friends who have visited these gardens assure me they even  surpass those of Dr. Bennett. It is said that next time the Queen visits  Mentone, she will take up her abode at this house. Mr. Hanbury is  equally courteous in welcoming visitors to his beautifully cultivated  grounds and gardens.    Mentone is more sheltered than either Cannes or Nice, the mountains  encircling the town more closely; there is consequently more  hill-climbing, and fewer extended walks and excursions for invalids. It  was occasionally bleak and cold after sunset during this early part of  the year, and invalids were all obliged to gain the shelter of their  dwellings by about four p.m. These cold, biting winds generally blew  from north or east, the main streets being like drafty narrow gorges.    We had one exceedingly pretty walk up the valley to the right of our  hotel. The river, now almost dry, flowing silently along on one side; on  the other, hills and orange groves, and a little church or monastery  perched among the trees in the far distance--it resembled a Swiss  mountain valley. It was a very romantic road, and I incidentally  remarked to my wife that it was just the kind of place where, a few  years ago, we might have heard a shrill whistle from the hills, then an  answering echo, and by-and-by a band of brigands suddenly swooping down  upon us to carry us off to their lair upon the mountains. This was quite  enough to make her nervous, and, despite my pacifying assurances that  in these days of enlightened progress no such thrilling adventure would  be likely to befall us, she begged that we might return at once; and, as  our walk had already been a somewhat extended one into the still  recesses of the mountain valley, I thought it just as well to follow her  prudent advice and retrace our steps. For although I laughed at my  wife's fears, they were really not so utterly without foundation as  might at first appear, for we had recently heard of a most daring case  of brigandage in the neighbourhood. As I have before remarked, there are  a great many very questionable characters loitering between Nice and  Genoa.    Two ladies at an hotel here met with a small adventure that might have  ended in something more serious but for one fortunate circumstance. They  were a mother and daughter, staying at Nice about the same time as  ourselves, and related that having started one fine afternoon to walk to  Villafranca, on getting out of sight of all signs of habitation, they  were much alarmed to find they were being followed by two ill-looking  Italians. The men passed them, and disappeared round the promontory  which shuts Nice out of sight, and forms one side of the natural harbour  of Villafranca. The ladies, wishing to give them a wide berth, walked  very slowly, hoping to be left far in their wake; but soon after, on  reaching a particularly dull part of the road, they came on the men  again, who were evidently waiting for them. Still hoping they might be  mistaken, the two ladies stopped likewise, as if to admire the scenery  and consult their guide-books, but the men held their ground, and  presently walked towards them. Just as they were approaching, a carriage  containing a gentleman came in sight, and they thereupon walked on for a  short distance, as if they were only returning the way they had come;  but as soon as the carriage had fairly passed, they once more turned.  The ladies were now thoroughly alarmed, and the younger one flew down  the dusty road after the carriage, in hopes of overtaking it and  soliciting protection. She was fortunately observed by the occupant, who  at once stopped the horses, and very kindly invited them to continue  their journey in his carriage, remarking that many of the roads along  the Riviera were decidedly unsafe for foot-passengers, and that he had  been surprised at two ladies undertaking such a risk alone. They  gratefully accepted his offer, and proceeded to the Villafranca station  without meeting a single human being--a fact which they noted with a  shudder and a deep sense of thankfulness at their narrow escape.    We made a second trip up the hill-side to the Roman Catholic cemetery,  which gave us a charming view of the town, environed by gardens. The  place itself was peacefully beautiful and full of mournful interest. We  noticed at one of the tombs a young lady, evidently a German, who,  assisted by her maid, was diligently employed in cleaning a marble  statue placed over the grave. It was difficult to refrain from offering  to help her in this labour of love, which appealed so pathetically to  the heart. I do not think we care to display so much outward proofs of  loving reverence for our dead as we often see abroad, in the shape of  flowers and _immortelles_ placed upon the graves by affectionate  relatives and friends. Still, I believe it is only an external  indifference. We have as much true and deep love in our hearts for our  dear ones as those who are more demonstrative, though perhaps it _is_ a  pity that we do not allow ourselves to indulge in the pretty reverential  sentiments of our French and Italian neighbours.    We were much amused during our stay here at the constant chorus the  frogs kept up. They croak almost unceasingly, especially in the evening.  It would seem that they wish to take the place of the song-birds, which  we seldom hear in this part, as they are all shot to supply the table,  nearly every kind being eaten--a needless cruelty, one would think, not  only to the poor little birds, but also to those who miss their grateful  song of joy and praise.    We had a pleasant carriage excursion to Monte Carlo, by the Corniche  road, starting one brilliant morning soon after breakfast. Leaving  Mentone behind us, we commenced the circuit of the cliff road, which  gradually got higher and higher, occasionally passing through olive  plantations, and then suddenly emerging from their sombre shade to the  dazzling bright sea once more; then we doubled a finely wooded  promontory, almost a sheer precipice, catching a glimpse of the  beautiful little circling bays sparkling in the abyss below; sometimes  passing sharp curves in the road, which required very skilful driving,  there being but a low wall--and that partly broken in many places--to  divide us from a fall of about sixty feet! Still ascending, we gained  the summit of the first fine headland (I believe, the highest point),  and from thence had a most entrancing outlook. On the extreme left, a  lovely retrospective and bird's-eye view of charming Mentone; the towns  and little villages on the distant shore as far as Bordighera; dimpling  in the glowing sunshine, and before us, the long stretch of inimitable  blue sea, with just a feathery ripple on the golden sandy shores below,  winding in and out in a series of tiny bays and creeks; while beyond us,  like a realized dream of Paradise, lay the beautiful plague-spot of the  Riviera--the town of Monte Carlo, nested amid luxuriant gardens of  semi-tropical foliage, the mosque-like minarets and cupolas of the  casino standing boldly out on the heights and glittering in the sun.  Beyond this, another fine bay and promontory, on the summit of which  stands the Castle of Monaco; and below, surrounded by groves and  gardens, the town and principality of Monaco, with roads stretching out,  leading towards Villafranca and Nice.    I had seen Constantinople, Madeira, and many other parts of this fair  earth of ours, but I do not remember anything that compares with this  bit of Italian coast scenery, which I think is surely the loveliest in  the world.    Dismissing our carriage, we walked through Monte Carlo to Monaco, and  ascended to the palace of the prince. It stands on the summit of a bold  headland, surrounded by fortifications, from which we had another  splendid view. One can readily see how fair and beautiful a place, full  of the sweetest harmonies of nature, and filling the human heart with a  grateful sense of God's love, has, by the sordid wickedness of man, been  perverted into a paradise of the Prince of Darkness, who, knowing too  well the weakness and folly of poor erring humanity, lures by every  artificial attraction and fascination even the poor pilgrim invalid, who  hopefully journeys here to breathe the pure fresh air and to recover  health; and also does his best to complete the moral degradation of the  less innocent but infatuated gambler, who stakes his life upon the cast  of a die and rushes madly and miserably to unutterable ruin.    I have already mentioned the plantations of olive trees we passed in our  drive on the cliffs. Nothing strikes one more singularly, in coming to  this part of the world, than the contrast in appearance between the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23991"],[0,"Mission Furniture: How to Make It, Part 2 (#10)"],[1," homes and the regular type of a mission lamp would be of little use. The  illustration shows an ordinary round wick kerosene lamp fitted out in  mission style.    [Illustration: Artistic Mission Style Oil Lamp]    [Illustration: Bronze Shade Holder]    A few modifications were made in the design of an expensive lamp to  simplify the construction. The lamp should have a tall chimney. The  dimensions given in the drawings, and the photograph, will explain  themselves. Many of the details can be worked up by the maker.    The body of the lamp is made of 1/2-in. oak and is provided with  openings as shown. The interior receptacle is very handy for holding a  match box, smoking articles, etc.    A piece of copper band, 1 in. wide, is fastened to the body with large  upholsterers' tacks, to give it a finished appearance. The base is 7/8  in. thick and in order to prevent tilting is provided with four square  feet, 1/4 in. thick. The top piece of the body is 1/2-in. oak, which is  provided with a hole large enough to receive the bowl of the lamp. If  such a lamp is not at hand, one can be purchased at a very reasonable  price.    The shade is made of oak frames set in with clouded art glass panels.  The different sections of the frames are fastened together with brass  screws and the glass is held in place by triangular cleats of oak. Be  sure and fit the shade with cardboard panels before ordering the glass.  The cardboard can be used as a pattern in cutting the glass, and the  glass will then fit without recutting, which is quite difficult.    The glass beaded fringe should be of suitable color to harmonize with  the finished lamp.    The shade is supported by four brackets cast in bronze from a wood  pattern (dimensions given) and finished by filing, buffing and  lacquering.          ANOTHER CHINA CLOSET      The china closet shown in the accompanying illustration is well  proportioned and of pleasing appearance. It can be made of any one of  the several furniture woods in common use, but quarter-sawed oak will be  found to give the most pleasing effect. The stock should be ordered from  the mill ready sawed to length, squared and sanded. In this way much  hard labor will be saved. The following pieces will be needed:      1 top, 1 by 19 by 38 in., S-1-S.    4 posts, 3/4 by 3 by 59 in., S-2-S.    4 side rails, 3/4 by 3 by 31 in., S-1-S.    4 end uprights, 1 by 2 by 48-1/2 in., S-2-S.    4 end rails, 1 by 3 by 16 in., S-2-S.    2 lattice rails, 1 by 2 by 13 in., S-2-S.    1 top board, 3/4 by 3 by 36 in., S-1-S.    4 side door rails, 3/4 by 2 by 47 in., S-2-S.    6 cross rails, 3/4 by 2 by 12 in., S-2-S.    4 slats, 1/2 by 3/4 by 16-1/2 in., S-2-S.    4 slats, 1/2 by 3/4 by 13-1/2 in., S-2-S.    8 slats, 1/2 by 3/4 by 12-1/2 in., S-2-S.    4 shelves, 5/8 by 16 by 32 in., S-1-S., poplar.    4 cleats, 1 in. sq. by 55 in., soft wood.    4 cleats, 1 in. sq. by 28 in., soft wood.    4 cleats, 1 in. sq. by 14 in., soft wood.    [Illustration: China Closet with Latticework Doors and Sides]    [Illustration: Details of China Closet]    Having this material on hand, start with the four posts, as they are all  alike. Clamp them together, being careful to have them of the right  length, and the ends square. Trim the bottom, as shown in the detail  drawing, and then lay out the mortises for the front and back rails.  These rails can now be laid out and the tenons cut to fit the mortises  in the posts. The back rails should, in addition, be rabbeted for the  back board as shown. The end rails are fastened to the posts by means of  screws through 1-in. square cleats, fastened on the inside of the posts  as shown in the section A-A. In all cases the screws should be run  through the cleats into the framing so the heads will not show. The end  rails should be rabbeted on the inside for the latticework and the  glass.    The back board should have the corners rounded as shown and be fastened  to the top board with screws through from the bottom side. The top board  is then fastened to the top rail cleats in the same manner.    The doors are put together by means of tenons and mortises. The frames  should be rabbeted on the inside for the latticework and the glass.  Leaded glass can be used in place of this latticework, if it is desired.  Suitable hinges and a catch should be supplied. These can be purchased  at any hardware store.    The shelves should be cut out at the corners to fit around the cleats.  They rest on small blocks which are fastened to the cleats, or if  desired, small holes can be drilled and pins used instead.    The back is put on in the usual manner. A mirror can be put in without  much trouble if it is desired.    When putting the frame together, glue should be used on the joints, as  it makes them much stiffer. Be careful to get the frame together  perfectly square, or it will be hard to fit the doors and the glass.  When it is complete, go over the whole carefully with fine sandpaper and  remove all rough spots. Scrape all the surplus glue from about the  joints, as stain will not take when there is any glue. The closet can be  finished in any one of the many mission stains supplied by the trade for  this purpose.    [Illustration: Oak Bedstead Complete]          AN OAK BEDSTEAD      The accompanying sketches show an artistic design for a mission bed, so  simple in construction and design that most any one that has a few tools  and a knowledge of their use can make it. It is best made of  quarter-sawed oak, as this wood is the easiest to procure and work up  and looks well with any finish. If the stock is ordered from the mill  ready cut to length, squared and sanded, much of the hard labor will be  saved.    The following is a list of the material needed:      2 posts, 2-1/2 by 2-1/2 by 50 in.    2 posts, 2-1/2 by 2-1/2 by 44 in.    2 end rails, 1 by 6 by 56 in.    2 side rails, 1 by 6 by 78 in.    5 end rails, 1 by 4 by 56 in.    3 end rails, 1 by 2 by 56 in.    8 vertical slats, 3/8 by 6 by 11-1/2 in.   10 vertical slats, 3/8 by 2 by 11-1/2 in.    2 cleats, 1 by 1 by 78 in.    5 slats, 3/4 by 3 by 55-1/2 in.   20 blocks, 1 by 1 by 3 in.    Square up the four posts in pairs and lay out the mortises as per  drawing. To do this, lay them side by side on a flat surface with the  ends square and mark them with a try-square. The tenons on the end rails  are laid out in the same manner as the posts. Four of the end rails  should be marked and mortises cut for the upright slats as shown in the  detail drawing. The tenons on the end rails are about 1 in. long, while  those on the slats can be 3/4 in. long. Fit all the parts together  before gluing to see that they fit square and tight. After the glue has  been applied clamp them together perfectly square and set them away to  dry. They should dry at least twenty-four hours before the clamps are  removed.    [Illustration: Details of Oak Bedstead]    While the ends are drying, the side rails can be made. These have a  1-in. square cleat screwed to the inner side for the slats to rest upon.  If springs are used, five slats will be sufficient. They can be placed  where the springs will rest upon them. After the position of the slats  has been located, nail small blocks at their sides to hold them in  place. For fastening the side rails to the posts, patent devices can be  purchased at a local hardware store. The posts will have to be mortised  to receive these, and care should be exercised to get them in the right  place.    When the bed is complete go over it carefully and scrape all the surplus  glue from about the joints, as the finish will not take where there is  any glue. Remove all rough spots with fine sandpaper; then apply the  stain you like best, which may be any of the many mission stains  supplied by the trade for this purpose. If this bed is well made and  finished, it will be an ornament to any home.          AN OAK FOOTSTOOL      The footstool shown in the illustration can be made from any kind of  wood, but when it is intended to be finished in mission style,  quarter-sawed oak will produce the best effect. The material needed will  be as follows:     1 top, 1 by 9-1/2 by 12 in., S-1-S.   2 legs, 3/4 by 8 by 12 in., S-2-S.   1 brace, 3/4 by 7 by 9 in., S-1-S.    Order these pieces cut to length, squared and sanded. A full-sized  layout of the front view should be made to get the correct bevels for  the legs and brace. The design of the legs can be varied to suit the  fancy of the maker. For such a design as shown draw one-half of it on  paper; fold on the center line and with scissors cut both sides of the  outline by following the lines drawn. Trace around this pattern on the  wood, and saw out with a compass or keyhole saw. The sawed edges should  be smoothed and sandpapered.    [Illustration: Details of Footstool]    The perforation in the top board is made by first boring holes, then  trimming out the edges with a sharp chisel. Be sure to get the best side  of the board up.    [Illustration: Footstool Complete]    The legs are fastened to the top and to the braces with 1-3/4-in. wood  screws as shown in the detail drawing. After the stool is assembled, go  over it carefully with fine sandpaper and remove all rough spots before  applying the finish. This finish can be any one of the many different  kinds supplied by the trade for this purpose. If this stool is well made  and finished, it will be a useful and attractive article.

Pyro-carving is one of the new methods of decorating furniture  which is both beautiful and practical, two qualities which do not always  go together.
