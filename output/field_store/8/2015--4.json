She dances around  the stage, keeping time to the music and bending over the little  sleepers._    ANITA. Asleep! Every last one of them is verra sound asleep. Meeny and  Biddy Mary, and Sergius and Tomasso and the leetla Dutch twins and  all! (_Goes to curtain at rear._) Jack Frost! Jolly Jack Frost! Come-a  quick, come-a quick! They're all asleep.    JACK FROST (_sticks his head out of the curtains_). Hello, what is it?    ANITA. It is Anita. The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.    JACK FROST (_coming down to her_). And so was I. They sang a song  about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I  dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole.  (_Yawns._) I'm still awfully sleepy.    ANITA. I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.    JACK FROST. You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my  daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the  middle of the night.    ANITA. The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?    JACK FROST. Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas  we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter  of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he  comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?    ANITA. Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about  my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?    JACK FROST. Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now.  It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see  anything that looks like an air ship, do you?    ANITA (_looking up and off at R._). No, I cannot see a single thing.    JACK FROST (_sees table at rear_). Oh, look here! The children have  lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And  see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem.  And stockings and shoes all in a row.    ANITA (_looking up and off R._). I can't see a thing.    JACK FROST. Here's a telescope. Look through that. (_Takes home-made  telescope from his barrel._) Now do you see anything?    ANITA. Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.    JACK FROST. Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong  end. Turn it around.    ANITA (_looks up and off R. through telescope_). Oh, now I can see the  stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way  off--far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?    (_Fast music, played softly._)    JACK FROST (_looks through the telescope_). Yes, I believe it is.    ANITA (_dances wildly about the stage_). Oh, he's coming, he's  coming. I'm going to get to see Santa Claus! Is it not wonderful? I'm  going to see him. Let me look. (_Takes telescope._) Oh, it's getting  bigger and _bigger_ and BIGGER!    _Sleigh bells heard outside at R., far away in the distance._    JACK FROST (_capering around_). Hurray! daddy's coming! daddy's  coming!    ANITA. Now I can hear the bells. Oh, it's coming closer and _closer_  and CLOSER. Look out, it's going to hit the boat! (_Small toy air ship  flies across the stage at rear, with tiny lights twinkling in it.  Stretch a wire across rear of stage and high up, for the toy to run  on._)    JACK FROST. He flew right by us.    ANITA. Maybe he didn't see the boat. Oh, now he isn't coming at all.    JACK FROST (_looking out at L._). Yes, he is. He's landed right over  there. Here he comes; here he comes! (_Music and bells louder and  louder._)    ANITA (_runs to L._). Here we are, Santa Claus. This is the place.  Come in. Merry Christmas, Santa Claus, merry Christmas!    _Loud fast music. Enter_ SANTA CLAUS _from L._    SANTA CLAUS. Hello, there--where are you? It's so dark I can't see a  single thing.    JACK FROST. Hello, daddy; merry Christmas.    SANTA CLAUS (_shaking hands with him_). Hello yourself. Merry  Christmas to you, too. Are you all ready for me?    JACK FROST. Yes, it's all ready. The magical tree is just waiting for  your touch to turn into a real Christmas tree.    ANITA. Oh, we're going to have a real Christmas tree.    SANTA CLAUS. Hello, who's this young person?    JACK FROST. This is Anita.    SANTA CLAUS. And why isn't she sound asleep like the rest of the  children?    JACK FROST. She's such a good little girl that I told her she could  stay up with me and wait until you came.    SANTA CLAUS (_laughs_). Oh, ho; so you've made a hit with my boy, Jack  Frost, have you? Well, if that's the case, I guess you can stay.    ANITA. But all of the children would like to see you, Santa Claus.  See, they've prepared the candle and the wreath of holly and the star  of Bethlehem all for you. There's Sergius and Tomasso and Hulda and  Meeny and Hans and Yakob and Neelda and Ah Goo and Sano San and Mieze  and the leetla Dutch twins, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum.  They've all been awfully good children. And Biddy Mary and Paddy Mike  they brought the candle. They're good, too.    SANTA CLAUS. Hurry, Jack, and fill up the shoes and stockings.    JACK FROST (_filling them from the sack_). Yes, daddy, I'm hurrying.    SANTA CLAUS. It's just two minutes till Christmas morning. I've had a  hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in  the steerage.    ANITA. Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let  them see you?    SANTA CLAUS. Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the  birth of Christmas Day.    ANITA. And don't you have any other place to go this year?    SANTA CLAUS. I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my  air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the  sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a  Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things  back to the North Pole again.    JACK FROST (_empties sack on floor_). Here they are, daddy.    SANTA CLAUS. Now, where's the tree?    JACK FROST (_goes to rear of the stage and removes the curtains that  have been concealing the dazzling Christmas tree._). There she is.  Isn't she a beauty?    ANITA. Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.    (_Faint chimes are heard in the distance._)    JACK FROST. There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry  Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.    ANITA (_dancing around_). Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry  Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to  all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up! (_Shakes her._)    JACK FROST. Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!    SANTA CLAUS. Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you  two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and  give Santa Claus a good, old hug!    (_The children all awaken. Rub eyes, stretch, etc._)    HULDA. Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come! (_Runs and hugs_ SANTA  CLAUS.)    SCHWILLIE. Me, too. (_Hugs him._) I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?    (_Lights all on full._)    KLINKER (_hugging_ SANTA CLAUS). Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I,  Schwillie Willie Winkum?    MEENY. Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.    TOMASSO. And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.    PADDY MIKE. Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa  Claus. (_The cheers are given._)    ANITA (_bringing_ JACK FROST _forward_). And this is the leetla Jolly  Jack Frost.    PADDY MIKE. Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost. (_The  cheers are given._)    ANITA (_at C. with_ JACK FROST). This was my Christmas secret. Santa  Claus and the air ship and the Christmas tree and jolly Jack Frost and  everything. This was the secret.    PADDY MIKE. Now all of yeez give three cheers for Anita's secret.  (_The cheers are given. Folk dance may be introduced.

The stage should be set to represent the steerage of a large  ocean-going vessel. A good elaborate set may be arranged with very  little expense by following the diagram. The back drop should be of  light blue with a few cumulus clouds in white. The water line should  be about one-fourth from the bottom, and from this line downward the  scene should be darker blue, with white waves.    The background may be made from canvas or paper, as desired. A good  effect has been produced by covering frames with tissue paper of the  desired shades, the clouds and the water lines being cut from white  paper and pasted on.    A railing runs across rear of stage. This railing is made of wood,  with a tennis net serving for the wiring. Round life-savers are cut  from paper, painted and attached to the railing. The ventilator and  hatchways may be made from brown bristol board.    A large Christmas tree, lighted and decorated, stands at rear L. This  is concealed by curtains.    A square box or table stands at rear C. Several barrels and boxes are  at left front, and a box is at right front. A large barrel stands at  left of center near the rear.

It will  probably be conceded by all who are well informed on the subject that  his restoration was a benefit to the public service.[11]    [The reader desirous for further information relative to the  administration of the War Department during this period may find it in  the various official reports and estimates of works of defense  prosecuted or recommended, arsenals of construction and depots of arms  maintained or suggested, and foundries employed, during the Presidency  of Mr. Pierce, 1853-'57.]    Having been again elected by the Legislature of Mississippi as Senator  to the United States, I passed from the Cabinet of Mr. Pierce, on the  last day of his term (March 4, 1857), to take my seat in the Senate.    The Administration of Franklin Pierce presents the only instance in our  history of the continuance of a Cabinet for four years without a single  change in its _personnel_. When it is remembered that there was much  dissimilarity if not incongruity of character among the members of that  Cabinet, some idea may be formed of the power over men possessed and  exercised by Mr. Pierce. Chivalrous, generous, amiable, true to his  friends and to his faith, frank and bold in the declaration of his  opinions, he never deceived any one. And, if treachery had ever come  near him, it would have stood abashed in the presence of his truth, his  manliness, and his confiding simplicity.      [Footnote 11: Soon after my entrance upon duty as secretary of War,  General Jesup, the Quartermaster-General, presented to me a list of  names from which to make selection of a clerk for his department.  Observing that he had attached certain figures to these names, I asked  whether the figures were intended to indicate the relative  qualifications, or preference in his estimation, of the several  applicants; and, upon his answer in the affirmative, without further  question, authorized him to appoint \"No. 1\" of his list. A day or two  afterward, certain Democratic members of Congress called on me and  politely inquired whether it was true that I had appointed a Whig to a  position in the War Office. \"Certainly not,\" I answered. \"We thought you  were not aware of it,\" said they, and proceeded to inform me that Mr.  ----, the recent appointee to the clerkship just mentioned, was a Whig.  After listening patiently to this statement, I answered that it was they  who were deceived, not I. I had appointed a clerk. He had been appointed  neither as a Whig nor as a Democrat, but merely as the fittest candidate  for the place in the estimation of the chief of the bureau to which it  belonged. I further gave them to understand that the same principle of  selection would be followed in similar cases, so far as my authority  extended. After some further discussion of the question, the visitors  withdrew, dissatisfied with the result of the interview.    The Quartermaster-General, on hearing of this conversation, hastened to  inform me that it was all a mistake--that the appointee to the office  had been confounded with his father, who was a well-known Whig, but that  he (the son) was a Democrat. I assured the General that this was  altogether immaterial, adding that it was \"a very pretty quarrel\" as it  stood, and that I had no desire to effect a settlement of it on any  inferior issue. Thenceforward, however, I was but little troubled with  any pressure for political appointments in the department.]          CHAPTER V.

The organization of the Territory of Kansas was the first question that  gave rise to exciting debate after my return to the Senate. The  celebrated Kansas-Nebraska Bill had become a law during the  Administration of Mr. Pierce. As this occupies a large space in the  political history of the period, it is proper to state some facts  connected with it, which were not public, but were known to me and to  others yet living.    The declaration, often repeated in 1850, that climate and the will of  the people concerned should determine their institutions when they  should form a Constitution, and as a State be admitted into the Union,  and that no legislation by Congress should be permitted to interfere  with the free exercise of that will when so expressed, was but the  announcement of the fact so firmly established in the Constitution, that  sovereignty resided alone in the States, and that Congress had only  delegated powers. It has been sometimes contended that, because the  Congress of the Confederation, by the Ordinance of 1787, prohibited  involuntary servitude in all the Northwestern Territory, the framers of  the Constitution must have recognized such power to exist in the  Congress of the United States. Hence the deduction that the prohibitory  clause of what is known as the Missouri Compromise was justified by the  precedent of the Ordinance of 1787. To make the action of the Congress  of the Confederation a precedent for the Congress of the United States  is to overlook the great distinction between the two.    The Congress of the Confederation represented the States in their  sovereignty, and, as such representatives, had legislative, executive,  and, in some degree, judicial power confided to it. Virtually, it was an  assemblage of the States. In certain cases a majority of nine States  were required to decide a question, but there is no express limitation,  or restriction, such as is to be found in the ninth and tenth amendments  to the Constitution of the United States. The General Government of the  Union is composed of three departments, of which the Congress is the  legislative branch, and which is checked by the revisory power of the  judiciary, and the veto power of the Executive, and, above all, is  expressly limited in legislation to powers expressly delegated by the  States. If, then, it be admitted, which is certainly questionable, that  the Congress of the Confederation had power to exclude slave property  northwest of the Ohio River, that power must have been derived from its  character as representing the States in their sovereignty, for no  indication of such a power is to be found in the Articles of  Confederation.    If it be assumed that the absence of a prohibition was equivalent to the  admission of the power in the Congress of the Confederation, the  assumption would avail nothing in the Congress under the Constitution,  where power is expressly limited to what had been delegated. More  briefly, it may be stated that the Congress of the Confederation could,  like the Legislature of a State, do what had not been prohibited; but  the Congress of the United States could only do what had been expressly  permitted. It is submitted whether this last position is not conclusive  against the possession of power by the United States Congress to  legislate slavery into or exclude it from Territories belonging to the  United States.    This subject, which had for more than a quarter of a century been one of  angry discussion and sectional strife, was revived, and found occasion  for renewed discussion in the organization of Territorial governments  for Kansas and Nebraska. The Committees on Territories of the two Houses  agreed to report a bill in accordance with that recognized principle,  provided they could first be assured that it would receive favorable  consideration from the President. This agreement was made on Saturday,  and the ensuing Monday was the day (and the only day for two weeks) on  which, according to the order of business established by the rules of  the House of Representatives, the bill could be introduced by the  Committee of that House.    On Sunday morning, the 22d of January, 1854, gentlemen of each Committee  called at my house, and Mr. Douglas, chairman of the Senate Committee,  fully explained the proposed bill, and stated their purpose to be,  through my aid, to obtain an interview on that day with the President,  to ascertain whether the bill would meet his approbation. The President  was known to be rigidly opposed to the reception of visits on Sunday for  the discussion of any political subject; but in this case it was urged  as necessary, in order to enable the Committee to make their report the  next day. I went with them to the Executive mansion, and, leaving them  in the reception-room, sought the President in his private apartments,  and explained to him the occasion of the visit. He thereupon met the  gentlemen, patiently listened to the reading of the bill and their  explanations of it, decided that it rested upon sound constitutional  principles, and recognized in it only a return to that rule which had  been infringed by the compromise of 1820, and the restoration of which  had been foreshadowed by the legislation of 1850. This bill was not,  therefore, as has been improperly asserted, a measure inspired by Mr.  Pierce or any of his Cabinet. Nor was it the first step taken toward the  repeal of the conditions or obligations expressed or implied by the  establishment, in 1820, of the politico-sectional line of thirty-six  degrees and thirty minutes. That compact had been virtually abrogated,  in 1850, by the refusal of the representatives of the North to apply it  to the territory then recently acquired from Mexico. In May, 1854, the  Kansas-Nebraska Bill was passed; its purpose was declared in the bill  itself to be to "]]]
