All these appliances but availed to raise the foundations of  the nave a few feet above ground.[112] Forty years elapsed before Bishop  Leighton (1422-1440) completed the wall of the nave, founded the  northern transept, and reared the two western towers.[113] Bishop  Lindsay (1441-1459) paved and roofed the cathedral; it was glazed by  Bishop Spens (1459-1480). Bishop Elphinstone (1487-1514), who founded  King's College in 1500, and who was \"the most distinguished of all who  ever filled the episcopal chair,\" ... and possessed \"manners and  temperance in his own person, befitting the primitive ages of  Christianity,\"[114] adorned the cathedral. He built the great central  tower and wooden spire, provided the great bells, and covered the roofs  of nave, aisles, and transept with lead.[115] This central tower was  four storey high, and square, and had two battlements and fourteen  bells; it was a noted landmark to mariners at sea.[116] Bishop Gavin  Dunbar (1519-1531) built the southern transept, added spires to  Leighton's towers, and constructed at his own \"pains and expenses\" the  flat ceiling of oak, which still remains with the heraldries of the  Pope, the Emperor, St. Margaret, the kings and princes of Christendom,  the bishops and the earls of Scotland. Bishop Elphinstone began to  rebuild the choir, but it never seems to have been finished. Alluding to  1560, Orme says, \"The glorious structure of said cathedral church, being  near nine score years in building, did not remain twenty entire, when it  was almost ruined by a crew of sacrilegious church robbers.\"[117] The  ruins of the choir have been entirely removed; of the transepts only the  foundations now remain, the architecture being destroyed by the fall of  the central tower in 1688. The nave is nearly perfect, and is used as  the parish church. The west front, except the spires, is entirely built  with granite, and is regarded as one of the most impressive and imposing  structures in Scotland,[118] and as stately in the severe symmetry of  its simple design.[119] There is a remarkable entrance doorway, the  jambs being mere rounds and hollows, with a flat stone laid along at the  springing of the round arch. Above the doorway are seven lofty narrow  windows, crowned each with a round and cusped arch, and forming a  striking feature of the whole. The clerestory windows are narrow and  round arched, without any moulding, while the aisle windows are filled  with the simplest tracery. East of the cathedral was the bishop's  palace (1470), \"a large and fair court, having a high tower at each of  its four corners\";[120] to the south stood the deanery. Aberdeen was  created a city or bishop's see by King David,[121] and the diocese  contained five deaneries, with 94 parishes.      5. DIOCESE OF MORAY    Previously to Elgin, the see was successively at Birnay, Kinnedor, and  Spyny, but without a proper cathedral.[122] Alexander I., shortly after  his accession in 1107, founded the bishopric, but it was not till the  time of Bricius, the sixth Bishop of Moray, who filled that position  from 1203 to 1222, that the bishops had any fixed residence in the  diocese.[123] When Bricius became bishop in 1203, he fixed his cathedral  at Spyny, founded a chapter of eight secular canons, and gave to his  church a constitution founded on the usage of Lincoln, which he  ascertained by a mission to England.[124] Andrew de Moravia succeeded  him in 1222, and in his time (1224) the transference of the episcopal  see and the cathedral of the diocese to Elgin was effected, which had  probably been designed and solicited by his predecessor.[125] This  bishop probably built the cathedral church, munificently endowed it,  increased the number of prebends to twenty-three, of which he held one,  and sat as a canon in the chapter.[126] The Cathedral of the Holy  Trinity was founded in 1224, on the site of an older church with the  same dedication, and the work proceeded under Bishop Andrew's  supervision during the eighteen remaining years of his life.[127] The  _Register_ of the see shows us \"Master Gregory the mason and Richard the  glazier\" at work in autumn 1237.[128] Of the building itself probably  now little is left, for it is recorded by Fordun under the year 1270  that the Cathedral of Elgin and the houses of the canons were burnt, but  whether by accident or design he does not add. The ruins now standing  probably date from a subsequent period, when there was raised the  stately building, of which Bishop Alexander Bur wrote to the king that  it was \"the pride of the land, the glory of the realm, the delight of  wayfarers and strangers, a praise and boast among foreign nations, lofty  in its towers without, splendid in its appointments within, its  countless jewels and rich vestments, and the multitude of its priests,  serving God in righteousness.\"[129] This description is taken from a  letter addressed to King Robert III., complaining that on the feast of  St. Botolph, in 1390, the king's own brother, the Earl of Buchan,  popularly known as the \"Wolf of Badenoch,\" had descended from the hills  with a band of wild Scots, and burned a considerable part of the town of  Elgin, St. Giles Church, the Maison Dieu, the manses of the clergy, and  the cathedral itself. The bishop appealed for aid and reparation, and  the \"Wolf of Badenoch\" was compelled to yield, but, on condition that he  should make satisfaction to the bishop and church of Moray and obtain  absolution from the Pope, he was absolved by the Bishop of St. Andrews  in the Blackfriars Church at Perth. Notwithstanding his age and  feebleness, Bishop Bur energetically pressed on the restoration of the  cathedral, and it was continued by Bishops Spynie (1397-1406) and Innes  (1406-1421), and even then it was not completed. It thus occupied many  years, even though it was promoted by grants of the royal favour, by a  third part of the whole revenues of the see being devoted to it for a  time, and by yearly subsidies being levied on every benefice in a  diocese stretching \"from the Ness to the Deveron, from the sea to the  passes of Lochaber and the central mountains that divide Badenoch and  Athol.\"[130] Early in the sixteenth century the central tower showed  signs of weakness, and had to be rebuilt in 1538. It fell in 1711,  destroying the nave and transepts.[131]    The Cathedral of Elgin was complete in all arrangements, and had a large  nave with double aisles, an extended choir and presbytery, north and  south transepts, a lady chapel, and a detached octagonal chapter-house.  It had a great tower and spire over the crossing, two beautiful turrets  at the east end, and two noble towers at the west end. Most of the  existing portions are pronounced to belong to the period when Scottish  architecture was at its best.[132] The existing ruins testify to the  former splendour of the completed structure, which was said to be a  building of Gothic architecture inferior to few in Europe. \"Elgin  alone,\" says Dr. Joseph Robertson, \"among the Scottish cathedrals of the  thirteenth century, had two western towers. They are now shorn of their  just height, but still they may be seen from far, lifting their bulk  above the pleasant plain of Murray, and suggesting what the pile must  have been when the amiable and learned Florence Wilson loved to look  upon its magnificence as he meditated his _De Animi Tranquillitate_ on  the banks of the Lossie, and when the great central spire soared to  twice the altitude of the loftiest pinnacle of ruin that now grieves the  eye.\"[133] The destruction of the cathedral was hastened by the  alienation of Church lands by Bishop Patrick Hepburn, among the worst of  the bishops; by the Privy Council in 1568 ordering the removal of lead  from the roofs; by wind and weather; by Cromwell's troops; by an  irrational zeal, which in 1630 broke down the carved screen and lovely  wood-work; and lastly by the falling of the central tower, which  destroyed the whole nave and part of the transepts. The passing away of  such a colossal work of beauty is grievous, and not less so when it is  recalled that the cathedral expressed the devoted labour of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21692"],[0,"The Pirate City: An Algerine Tale (#10)"],[1," spare in your `pokit,' for if not, it is plain  that the poor fellows will be led into captivity.\"    \"I would readily advance a larger sum for so good an end,\" replied the  consul, folding the letter.  \"I shall at once ride into town to make  arrangements, and as it is so late, will pass the night in our town  house.  I shall send our new attendant, Sidi Hassan, on this mission,  and leave you for the night under the guardianship of Rais Ali.\"    The consul left immediately, and next morning Sidi Hassan set out for  Bugia with the necessary ransom.    In regard to this we need say nothing more than that he accomplished his  purpose, paid the ransom, and received the seven British seamen,  accompanied by whom he commenced the return journey, he and his men  riding, and driving the sailors on foot before them as though they had  been criminals.  On the way, however, they were attacked, not far from  Algiers, by a body of predatory Arabs from the Jurjura mountains.    These bold villains, at the very first onset, killed more than half of  the Turkish escort, and put the rest to flight.  Six of the sailors they  captured and carried off, but Ted Flaggan, who was an exceedingly active  as well as powerful man, proved himself more than a match for them all.  During the melee he managed to throw himself in the way of one of the  best-mounted among the Arabs, who instantly charged him, but Ted sprang  aside and let him pass, ducking low to avoid a cut from his curved  sword.    Before he could turn, the Irishman ran close to his side, seized him by  the burnous, at the same time grasping his bridle, and pulled him out of  the saddle with such sudden violence that he fell headlong to the  ground, where he lay quite stunned by the fall.  Flaggan instantly  sprang into the saddle, as if he had been an accomplished cavalier,  though in reality he knew no more about horses than an Esquimaux.  However, a man who was accustomed to hold on to a top-sail-yard in a  gale was not to be easily shaken off by an Arab charger.  He clung to  the high saddle-bow with one hand, and with the other grasped his  clasp-knife, which he opened with his teeth.  Therewith he probed the  flanks of his fiery steed to such an extent that he not only distanced  all his Arab pursuers, but overtook and passed his own escort one by  one, until he reached Sidi Hassan himself.  He then attempted to pull  up, but the clasp-knife had fired the charger's blood in an unusual  degree.  With a wicked snort and fling that lifted Flaggan high out of  the saddle, it rushed madly on, left the pirate captain far behind, and  at length dashed through the Bab-Azoun gate of Algiers, despite the  frantic efforts of the guard to check or turn it.  Right onward it sped  through the street Bab-Azoun, scattering Turks, Moors, Jews, negroes,  and all the rest of them like chaff; passed the Dey's palace, straight  along the street Bab el-Oued; out at the water-gate, with similar  contempt of the guards; down into the hollow caused by the brook beyond;  up the slope on the other side, half-way towards the summit, on the  opposite side of Frais Vallon, and was not finally pulled up until it  had almost run down the British consul, who chanced to be riding  leisurely homeward at the time.    \"You seem to have had a pretty sharp run, my man,\" said the consul,  laughing, as the Irishman thankfully jumped off, and grasped the bridle  of the now thoroughly winded horse.    \"Faix an' I have, yer honour; an' if I haven't run down an' kilt half  the population o' that town, wotever's its name, no thanks to this  self-opiniated beast,\" replied Flaggan, giving the bridle a savage pull.    \"You're an Irishman, I perceive,\" said the consul, smiling.    \"Well, now, yer right, sur; though how ye came to persaive is more nor I  can understand.\"    \"Where have you come from? and how in such a plight?\" demanded the  consul in some surprise, observing that a troop of janissaries came  galloping up the winding road, near the top of which they stood.    \"Sorrow wan o' me knows where we touched at last,\" replied the seaman in  some perplexity; \"the names goes out o' me head like wather out of a  sieve.  All I'm rightly sure of is that I set sail four days ago from a  port they calls Boogee, or so'thin' like it, in company with a man  called Seedy Hassan; an' sure he'd ha bin seedy enough be now if his  horse hadn't bin a good 'un, for we wos attacked, and half his party  killed and took, forby my six messmates; but--\"    \"Your name is Ted Flaggan?\" inquired the consul hastily.    \"It is,\" said the seaman, in great surprise; \"sure yer honour must be--\"    The sentence was cut short by the arrival of the janissaries, who pulled  up with looks of considerable astonishment on finding the mad fugitive  engaged in quiet conversation with the British consul.    \"Gentlemen,\" said Colonel Langley, with much urbanity of tone and  manner, \"I suppose you wish to make a prisoner of this man?\"    The soldiers admitted that such was their desire and intention.    \"Then you will oblige me,\" continued the Colonel, \"by allowing me to be  his jailer in the meantime.  He is a British subject, of whom I can give  a good account at the fitting time and place.  Sidi Hassan, under whose  charge he has been by my orders, will doubtless soon arrive in town, and  further enlighten you on this subject.\"    Without waiting for a reply the Colonel bowed, and wheeling his horse  round rode quietly away, followed by the Irishman, who regarded his new  jailer with a very puzzled look, while a touch of humour further tended  to wrinkle his remarkably expressive countenance.        CHAPTER EIGHT.    TED FLAGGAN AND RAIS ALI PROCEED ON A MISSION, AND SEE IMPRESSIVE  SIGHTS.    Two days after the events narrated in the last chapter, Mrs Langley,  being seated on her favourite couch in the court under the small  banana-tree, sent Zubby into the garden to command the attendance of Ted  Flaggan.  That worthy was gifted with a rare capacity for taking the  initiative in all things, when permitted to do so, and had instituted  himself in the consul's mansion as assistant gardener, assistant cook  and hostler, assistant footman and nurseryman, as well as general  advice-giver and factotum, much to the amusement of all concerned, for  he knew little of anything, but was extremely good-humoured, helpful,  and apart from advice-giving--modest.    \"Flaggan,\" said Mrs Langley, when the stout seaman appeared, hat in  hand, \"I want you to accompany our interpreter, Rais Ali, into town, to  bring out a message from a gentleman named Sidi Omar.  Ali himself has  other duties to attend to, and cannot return till evening, so take  particular note of the way, lest you should miss it in returning.\"    \"I will, ma'am,\" replied Ted, with a forecastle bow, \"Does Mister Ally  onderstand English?\"    \"Oh yes,\" returned Mrs Langley, with a laugh.  \"I forgot that he was  absent when you arrived.  You will find that he understands all you say  to him, though I'm not quite sure that you will understand all he says  to you.  Like some of the other Moors here, he has been in the British  navy, and has acquired a knowledge of English.  You'll find him a  pleasant companion, I doubt not.  Be so good as to tell him that I wish  to see him before he leaves.\"    Obedient to the summons, Rais Ali quickly appeared.  The interpreter was  a stout, tall, dignified man of about thirty-five, with a great deal of  self-assertion, and a dash of humour expressed in his countenance.    \"Ali,\" said Mrs Langley, \"you are aware that Sidi Omar is to be married  to-morrow.  I have been invited to the wedding, but have stupidly  forgotten the hour at which I was asked to see the bride dressed.  Will  you go to Sidi Omar, or some of his people, and find this out?  Take the  sailor, Mr Flaggan, with you, and send him back with the information as  soon as possible.\"    \"Yis, mum,\" replied the interpreter; \"an' please, mum, I was want too,  tree days' leave of absins.\"    \"No doubt Colonel Langley will readily grant your request.  Have you  some particular business to transact, or do you merely desire a  holiday?\"    \"Bof,\" replied the Moor, with a mysterious smile.  \"I'se got finished  the partikler bizziness of bein' spliced yesterdays, an' I wants littil  holiday.\"    \"Indeed,\" said Mrs Langley in surprise, \"you have been very quiet about  it.\"    \"Ho yis, wery quiet.\"    \"Where is your bride, Ali?  I should like so much to see her.\"    \"Her's at 'ome, safe,\" said Rais Ali, touching a formidable key which  was stuck in his silken girdle.    \"What! have you locked her up?\"    \"Yis--'bleeged to do so for keep her safe.\"    \"Not alone, I hope?\" said Mrs Langley.    \"No, not 'lone.  Her's got a bootiflul cat, an' I means buy her a little  nigger boy soon.\"    Having arranged that Mrs Langley was to visit his bride on her way to  Sidi Omar's wedding the following day, Rais Ali set out on his mission,  accompanied by Mr Flaggan.    The Irishman soon discovered that the Moor was a conceited coxcomb and a  barefaced boaster, and ere long began to suspect that he was an arrant  coward.  He was, however, good-humoured and chatty, and Ted, being in  these respects like-minded, rather took a fancy to him, and slily  encouraged his weakness.    \"Ye must have seed a power o' sarvice in the navy, now,\" he said, with  an air of interest; \"how came you to git into it?\"    \"Ha! that wos cos o' me bein' sitch a strong, good-lookin' feller,\"  replied Ali, with an air of self-satisfaction.    \"Just so,\" said Flaggan; \"but it's not common to hear of Moors bein'  taken aboard our men o' war, d'ee see.  It's that as puzzles me.\"    \"Oh, that's easy to 'splain,\" returned Ali.  \"The fac' is, I'd bin for  sev'l year aboord a Maltese trader 'tween Meddrainean an' Liverp'l, and  got so like a English tar you coodn't tell the one fro' the oder.  Spok  English, too, like natif.\"    \"Ha!\" exclaimed Ted, nodding "]]]
