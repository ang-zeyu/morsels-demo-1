[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22829"],[0,"No Animal Food; and Nutrition and Diet; with Vegetable Recipes (#10)"],[1," in some parts of the  world the poor, although possessing great strength and excellent health,  live upon, and apparently relish, a dietary limited mostly to black  bread and garlics, while among ourselves an ordinary person eats as many  as fifty different foods in one day.[3]    On the other hand, a too monotonous dietary, especially where people are  accustomed to a large variety of mixed foods, fails to give the  gustatory pleasure necessary for a healthy secretion of the digestive  juices, and so may quite possibly result in indigestion. It is a matter  of common observation that we are better able to digest food which we  enjoy than that which we dislike, and as we live not upon what we eat,  but upon what we digest, the importance of enjoying the food eaten is  obvious.    Also as few people know anything about the nutritive value of foods,  they stand a better chance, if they eat a large variety, of procuring  the required quantity of different nutrients than when restricted to a  very limited dietary, because, if the dietary be very limited they  might by accident choose as their mainstay some food that was badly  balanced in the different nutrients, perhaps wholly lacking in protein.  It is lamentable that there is such ignorance on such an all-important  subject. However, we have to consider things as they are and not as they  ought to be.    Perhaps the best way is to have different food at different meals,  without indulging in many varieties at one meal. Thus taste can be  satisfied, while the temptation to eat merely for the sake of eating is  less likely to arise.    It might be mentioned, in passing, that in the opinion of the best  modern authorities the average person eats far more than he needs, and  that this excess inevitably results in pathological conditions. Voit's  estimate of what food the average person requires daily was based upon  observation of what people _do_ eat, not upon what they _should_ eat.  Obviously such an estimate is valueless. As well argue that an ounce of  tobacco daily is what an ordinary person should smoke because it is the  amount which the average smoker consumes.    A vegetarian needs only to consider the amount of protein necessary, and  obtained from the food eaten. The other nutrients will be supplied in  proportions correct enough to satisfy the body requirements under normal  conditions of health. The only thing to take note of is that more fat  and carbohydrates are needed in cold weather than hot, the body  requiring more fuel for warmth. But even this is not essential: the  essential thing is to have the required amount of protein. In passing,  it is interesting to observe the following: the fact that in a mixed  fruitarian diet the proportion of the nutrient compounds is such as to  satisfy natural requirements is another proof of the suitability of the  vegetable regimen to the human organism. It is a provision of Nature  that those foods man's digestive organs are constructed to assimilate  with facility, and man's organs of taste, smell, and perception best  prefer, are those foods containing chemical compounds in proportions  best suited to nourish his body.    One of the many reasons why flesh-eating is deleterious is that flesh is  an ill-balanced food, containing, as it does, considerable protein and  fat, but no carbohydrates or neutralising salts whatever. As the body  requires three to four times more carbohydrates than protein, and  protein cannot be properly assimilated without organic minerals, it is  seen that with the customary 'bread, meat and boiled potatoes' diet,  this proportion is not obtained. Prof. Chittenden holds the opinion that  the majority of people partake greatly in excess of food rich in  protein.    No hard and fast rule can be laid down to different persons require  different foods and foods and amounts at different times under different    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+  |[Transcriber's note: It is regretted that a line has been missed by the|  |typesetter.]                                                           |  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+    regulate the amount, or proper proportions, of food  material for a well-balanced dietary, as amounts, and the same person  requires different ferent conditions. Professor W. O. Atwater, an  American, makes the following statement: 'As the habits and conditions  of individuals differ, so, too, their needs for nourishment differ, and  their food should be adapted to their particular requirements. It has  been estimated that an average man at moderately active labor, like a  carpenter, or mason, should have (daily) about 115 grams (1750 grains)  or 0.25 pound of available protein, and sufficient fuel ingredients in  addition to make the fuel value of the whole diet 3,400 calories; while  a man at sedentary employment would be well nourished with 92 grams  (1400 grains) or 0.20 pound of available protein, and enough fat and  carbohydrates in addition to yield 2,700 calories of energy. The demands  are, however, variable, increasing and decreasing with increase and  decrease of muscular work, or as other needs of the person change. Each  person, too, should learn by experience what kinds of food yield him  nourishment with the least discomfort, and should avoid those which do  not \"agree\" with him.'    It has been stated that unless the body is supplied with protein, hunger  will be felt, no matter if the stomach be over-loaded with  non-nitrogenous food. If a hungry man ate heartily of _only_ such foods  as fresh fruit and green vegetables he might soon experience a feeling  of fulness, but his hunger would not be appeased. Nature asks for  protein, and hunger will continue so long as this want remains  unsatisfied. Similarly as food is the first necessity of life, so is  protein the first necessity in food. If a person were deprived of  protein starvation must inevitably ensue.    Were we (by 'we' is meant the generality of people in this country), to  weigh out our food supply, for, say a week, we should soon realise what  a large reduction from the usual quantity of food consumed would have to  be made, and instead of eating, as is customary, without an appetite,  hunger might perhaps once a day make itself felt. There is little doubt  but that the health of most people would be vastly improved if food were  only eaten when genuine hunger was felt, and the dietary chosen were  well balanced, _i.e._, the proportions of protein, fat, carbohydrates  and salts being about 3, 2, 9, 2-3. As aforesaid, the mixed vegetarian  dietary is, in general, well-balanced.    While speaking about too much food, it may be pointed out that the  function of appetite is to inform us that the body is in need of  nutriment. The appetite was intended by Nature for this purpose, yet how  few people wait upon appetite! The generality of people eat by time,  custom, habit, and sensual desire; not by appetite at all. If we eat  when not hungry, and drink when not thirsty, we are doing the body no  good but positive harm. The organs of digestion are given work that is  unnecessary, thus detracting from the vital force of the body, for there  is only a limited amount of potential energy, and if some of this is  spent unnecessarily in working the internal organs, it follows that  there is less energy for working the muscles or the brain. So that an  individual who habitually overfeeds becomes, after a time, easily tired,  physically lazy, weak, perhaps if temperamentally predisposed, nervous  and hypochondriacal. Moreover, over-eating not only adds to the general  wear and tear, thus probably shortening life, but may even result in  positive disease, as well as many minor complaints such as constipation,  dyspepsia, flatulency, obesity, skin troubles, rheumatism, lethargy,  etc.    Just as there is danger in eating too much, so there is much harm done  by drinking too much. The evil of stimulating drinks will be spoken of  later; at present reference is made only to water and harmless  concoctions such as lime-juice, unfermented wines, etc. To drink when  thirsty is right and natural; it shows that the blood is concentrated  and is in want of fluid. But to drink merely for the pleasure of  drinking, or to carry out some insane theory like that of 'washing out'  the system is positively dangerous. The human body is not a dirty barrel  needing swilling out with a hose-pipe. It is a most delicate piece of  mechanism, so delicate that the abuse of any of its parts tends to throw  the entire system out of order. It is the function of the blood to  remove all the waste products from the tissues and to supply the fresh  material to take the place of that which has been removed. Swilling the  system out with liquid does not in any way accelerate or aid the  process, but, on the contrary, retards and impedes it. It dilutes the  blood, thus creating an abnormal condition in the circulatory system,  and may raise the pressure of blood and dilate the heart. Also it  dilutes the secretions which will therefore 'act slowly and  inefficiently, and more or less fermentation and putrefaction will  meanwhile be going on in the food masses, resulting in the formation of  gases, acids, and decomposition products.'    Eating and drinking too much are largely the outcome of sensuality. To  see a man eat sensually is to know how great a sensualist he is.  Sensualism is a vice which manifests itself in many forms. Poverty has  its blessings. It compels abstinence from rich and expensive foods and  provides no means for surfeit. Epicurus was not a glutton. Socrates  lived on bread and water, as did Sir Isaac Newton. Mental culture is not  fostered by gluttony, but gluttony is indulged in at the expense of  mental culture.

Who after nobly ruling as prior of this Church  for twenty years twenty five weeks and five days, at length on the day of  the assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary closed his last day. In the  year of the Lord 1411.\" It is not certain that Chillenden actually  designed the buildings which were erected under his care, with which his  name is connected. For we know that work which was conceived and executed  by humble monks was ascribed as a matter of course to the head of the  monastery, under whose auspices and sanction it was carried out. Matthew  Paris records that a new oaken roof, well covered with lead, was built for  the aisles and tower of St. Alban's by Michael of Thydenhanger, monk and  _camerarius_; but he adds that \"these works must be ascribed to the abbot,  out of respect for his office, for he who sanctions the performance of a  thing by his authority, is really the person who does the thing.\" Prior  Chillenden became prior in 1390, and seems at any rate to have devoted a  considerable amount of zeal to the work of renovating the ruined portions  of the church.    [Illustration: THE MURDER OF ST. THOMAS A BECKET.    (Restoration, by T. Carter, of a painting on board hung on a column near  the tomb of Henry IV.).]    [Illustration: THE SHRINE OF ST. THOMAS A BECKET.    (Specially reproduced from a drawing among the Cottonian MSS. Brit. Mus.)]    The new #Nave# replaced the original building of Lanfranc. Professor Willis  says: \"The whole of Lanfranc's piers, and all that rested on them, appear  to have been utterly demolished, nothing remaining but the plinth of the  side-aisle walls.... The style [of Chillenden's new work] is a light  Perpendicular, and the arrangement of the parts has a considerable  resemblance to that of the nave of Winchester, although the latter is of a  much bolder character. Winchester nave was going on at the same time with  Canterbury nave, and a similar uncertainty exists about the exact  commencement. In both, a Norman nave was to be transformed; but at  Winchester the original piers were either clothed with new ashlaring, or  the old ashlaring was wrought into new forms and mouldings where possible;  while in Canterbury the piers were altogether rebuilt. Hence the piers of  Winchester are much more massive. The side-aisles of Canterbury are higher  in proportion, the tracery of the side windows different, but those of the  clerestory are almost identical in pattern, although they differ in the  management of the mouldings. Both have 'lierne' vaults [_i.e._, vaults in  which short transverse ribs or 'liernes' are mixed with the ribs that  branch from the vaulting capitals], and in both the triforium is obtained  by prolonging the clerestory windows downward, and making panels of the  lower lights, which panels have a plain opening cut through them, by which  the triforium space communicates with the passage over the roof of the  side-aisles.\" Chillenden, then, setting to work with the thoroughness  that marks his handiwork throughout, rebuilt the nave from top to bottom,  leaving nothing of Lanfranc's original structure save the \"plinth of the  side-aisle walls,\" which still remains. The resemblance between the naves  of Canterbury and Winchester, pointed out by Professor Willis, will at  once strike a close observer, though the greater boldness of character  shown in the Winchester architecture is by no means the only point of  difference. The most obvious feature in the Canterbury nave--a point which  renders its arrangement unique among the cathedrals both of England and  the Continent--is the curious manner in which the choir is raised aloft  above the level of the floor; this is owing to the fact that it stands  immediately above the crypt; the flight of steps which is therefore  necessarily placed between the choir and the nave adds considerably to the  general effect of our first view of the interior. On the other hand, the  raising of the choir is probably to some extent responsible for the great  height of the nave in comparison with its length, a point which spoils its  effectiveness when we view it from end to end. Stanley, in describing the  entrance of the pilgrims into the cathedral, points out how different a  scene must have met their eyes. \"The external aspect of the cathedral  itself,\" he says, \"with the exception of the numerous statues which then  filled its now vacant niches, must have been much what it is now. Not so  its interior. Bright colours on the roof, on the windows, on the  monuments; hangings suspended from the rods which may still be seen  running from pillar to pillar; chapels, and altars, and chantries  intercepting the view, where now all is clear, must have rendered it so  different, that at first we should hardly recognize it to be the same  building.\" The pilgrims on entering were met by a monk, who sprinkled  their heads with holy water from a \"sprengel,\" and, owing to the crowd of  devout visitors, they generally had to wait some time before they could  proceed towards a view of the shrine. Chaucer relates that the \"pardoner,  and the miller, and other lewd sots,\" whiled away the time with staring at  the painted windows which then adorned the nave, and wondering what they  were supposed to represent:        \"'He beareth a ball-staff,' quoth the one, 'and also a rake's end;'      'Thou failest,' quoth the miller, 'thou hast not well thy mind;      It is a spear, if thou canst see, with a prick set before,      To push adown his enemy, and through the shoulder bore.'\"    [Illustration: CAPITALS OF COLUMNS IN THE EASTERN APSE.]    None of these windows now remain entire, though the west window has been  put together out of fragments of the ancient glass. The latter-day  pilgrims will do well to look as little as possible at the hideous glass  which the Philistinism of modern piety has inserted, during the last  half-century, in the windows of the clerestory and the nave. Its obtrusive  unpleasantness make one wish that \"Blue Dick\" and his Puritan troopers  might once more be let loose, under judicious direction, for half an hour  on the cathedral. When Erasmus visited Canterbury, the nave contained  nothing but some books chained to the pillars, among them the \"Gospel of  Nicodemus\"--printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1509--and the \"tomb of some  person unknown.\" The last words must refer either to the chapel in the  south wall, which was built by Lady Joan Brenchley in 1447, and removed in  1787, or to the monument of Archbishop William Wittlesey, who died in  1374, and was interred in the south side of the nave in a marble tomb with  a brass, now destroyed. At present the south aisle contains a monument, in  alabaster, to Dr. Broughton, sometime Bishop of Sydney, who was educated  in the King's School, under the shadow of the cathedral. The figure is  recumbent, and the base of the monument, which is by Lough, is decorated  with the arms of the six Australian sees. In the north aisle we find  monuments to Orlando Gibbons, Charles I.'s organist; Adrian Saravia,  prebendary of Canterbury, and the friend of Hooker, the author of the  \"Ecclesiastical Polity;\" Sir John Boys, who founded a hospital for the  poor outside the north gate of the town, and died in 1614; Dean Lyall, who  died in 1857; and Archbishop Sumner, who died in 1862. These last two  monuments are by Phillips and H. Weekes, R.A., respectively.    #The Central Tower.#--In the nave the whole of Lanfranc's work was  destroyed, but in the central tower, which we will next examine, the  original supporting piers were left standing, though they were covered  over by Prior Chillenden with work more in keeping with the style in which  he had renewed the nave. \"Of the tower piers,\" says Willis, \"the western  are probably mere casings of the original, and the eastern certainly  appendages to the original.... Of course I have no evidence to show how  much of Lanfranc's piers was allowed to remain in the heart of the work.  The interior faces of the tower walls appear to have been brought forward  by a lining so as to increase their thickness and the strength of the  piers, with a view to the erection of a lofty tower, which however was not  carried above the roof until another century had nearly elapsed.\" It was  Prior Goldstone the second who, about 1500, carried upward the central  tower, which Chillenden seems to have left level with the roof of the  cathedral. \"With the countenance and help of Cardinal John Morton and  Prior William Sellyng he magnificently completed that lofty tower  commonly called Angyll Stepyll in the middle of the church. The vaulting  of the tower is his work--_testudine pulcherrima concameratam  consummavit_--and he also added the buttressing arches--with great care  and industry he annexed to the columns which support the same tower two  arches or vaults of stonework, curiously carved, and four smaller ones, to  assist in sustaining the said tower.\" The addition of these buttressing  arches, not altogether happy in its artistic effect, was probably rendered  necessary by some signs of weakness shown by the piers of the tower, for  the north-west pier, which was not so substantially reinforced as the  others, now shows a considerable bend in an eastward direction. The \"two  arches or vaults of stonework\" were inserted under the western and  southern tower arches. \"The eastern arch having stronger piers did not  require this precaution, and the northern, which opened upon the  'Martyrium,' seems to have been left free, out of reverence to the altar  of the martyrdom, and accordingly to have suffered the dislocation just  mentioned.\" The four smaller arches connected the two western tower-piers  with the nearest nave-pier and the wall of the transept. The buttressing  arches are strongly built, and are adorned with curious bands of  reticulated work. The central western arch"]]]
