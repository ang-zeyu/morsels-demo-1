But at least  the imperial despotism assumed a character by which it was justified  and ennobled. It tended to render our nation the greatest nation in  the world; but the despotism which awaits us has no other  accompaniment but bad faith, and no other end except the degradation  and slavery of France.\"    By such reflections, the suspicion and disgust and aversion inspired  by the government, were excited to the utmost pitch. The public  feeling did not stop there: the French people are naturally inconstant  in their opinions and sentiments; and their former prejudices against  Napoleon were changed into transports of admiration. France, under the  royal government, was humiliated, disorganized, and degenerate; and  they contrasted the present state of the country with the influence,  the strength, the compactness, which it enjoyed under the reign of  Napoleon; and He, who had lately been cursed as the root of all evil,  now appeared to be the greatest of men, and the greatest of heroes,  though in misfortune.    The government knew that Napoleon was again admired by the people, and  that they regretted his loss. To counteract these sentiments, coarse  and vulgar caricatures were exposed to the eyes of the populace; and  his person and his character became the theme of false and scandalous  libels published under the direction of the ministry. No effect was  produced. The mob looked at the caricatures with a smile of contempt;  and the actions of Napoleon, which, under his reign, excited the  greatest censure and disapprobation, now found the most zealous  apologists and defenders.    If Napoleon was accused of having overthrown the republican  government, and enslaved the country by the revolution of the 18th  Brumaire, they answered[17]:--\"At that era, anarchy, emboldened by the  misfortunes of the country, could only be repressed by victory. Civil  war had been organized in twenty departments; insurrections had taken  place in many, rapine infected them all; robbery and murder took place  with impunity on many of the principal high roads. Two dreadful laws,  the law of the hostages, and that of the forced loans, occasioned  greater evils than they could cure. No nation had ever existed in  which the finances of the state were in equal confusion; and a  succession of partial bankruptcies prolonged the opprobrium of the  general bankruptcy of the country. The money of the public was robbed  whilst in transit on the high roads. Robbers even carried it off from  the houses of the receivers, and the deficiency could not be made good  by the most violent exactions. The jacobins were on the point of  recommencing their reign of terror. The royalists had recourse without  scruple to all the measures which might enable them to satiate their  revenge; and the peaceable friends of the law were placed between the  conflicting parties in a state of disgraceful weakness and neutrality.  Such was the desperate situation of France when Napoleon seized the  helm of the state. Instead of imputing the slavery of the country to  him, he ought to have been blessed; for he delivered us from the  spoliations, the murders, and the tyranny which were consequent upon  the reign of anarchy and terror.\"                       [Footnote 17: I cannot express their thoughts more                     forcibly than by copying the passage, which I have                     quoted in my text, from the View of the Revolution                     by Lacretelle.]    Was it maintained that Napoleon had reigned despotically? They held  that this accusation was unjust; and they had recourse to the  following reasoning. \"Anarchy was silenced by Napoleon.\" It became  necessary, that order should take the place of disorder; that the  authority of one should be substituted for the authority of all.  Parties were to be restrained within the bound of moderation; traitors  were to be annihilated. It was necessary to curb the prejudices of the  nobility, and the revolutionary habits and manners of the jacobins.  This great work could not be accomplished, without engaging in a  conflict against individual interests and opinions. Napoleon was  considered as a despot; this was inevitable. Whenever the existing  polity of a state has been totally subverted, he who first raises the  edifice of society from its ruins, is necessarily accused of  despotism, because apparently he has no other rule except his own  will. Nor must we forget that Napoleon had been accustomed to command  implicit obedience in the camp. He retained his military attitude on  the throne. He usually addressed his courtiers, his connexions, and  his ministers, in the tone which he had formerly adopted when speaking  to his soldiers or their generals[18]. An appearance of despotism was  certainly given to his way of reigning and commanding, by such  language which is seldom heard in civil society. And in almost all  cases, appearance is taken for reality.                       [Footnote 18: From his early youth, it may be even                     said from his days of boyhood, Napoleon felt an                     inward presentiment that he was not destined to                     live in mediocrity. This persuasion soon taught him                     to treat others with disdain, and to entertain the                     highest opinion of himself. Scarcely had he                     obtained a subaltern command in the artillery, when                     he considered himself as the superior of his                     equals, and the equal of his superiors. In his 20th                     year he was placed at the head of the army of                     Italy. Without appearing to be in the slightest                     degree surprised by his elevation, he passed from a                     secondary station to the chief command. He                     immediately treated the old generals of the                     army--they who were so proud of the laurels--with                     an air of dignity and authority, which placed them                     in a situation which was probably new to them. But                     they did not feel humiliated, and their inferiority                     seemed to result as a matter of course, for the                     ascendancy exercised by Napoleon was irresistible;                     and he was thoroughly endued; with that instinct of                     authority, that talent of ensuring obedience, with                     those faculties which are usually confined to those                     who are kings by birth. Napoleon could probably                     have attained to supreme authority in any country                     in the world. Nature had formed him for command,                     and she never creates such men for the purpose of                     leaving them in obscurity. It seems, according to                     the remark of a writer whose name I have forgotten,                     that she is proud of her own work, and that she                     wishes to offer it to admiration, by placing it at                     the head of human society.]    At first the imperious tone adopted by Napoleon was blamed, next it  was admired. He soon employed it in his intercourse with foreign  ambassadors, with foreign sovereigns. The wily forms of ancient  diplomacy were discarded. Napoleon did not negociate; he issued his  orders. With one hand he brandished his victorious sword; in the other  he held crowns and sceptres. He bade the sovereigns of Europe make  their choice; he offered his friendship or his hatred, kingdoms or  blows. The monarchs who stood before his throne were taught wisdom by  experience. They knew that Napoleon could reward and punish; they  crowded into the ranks of his allies; and they consoled themselves for  their weakness, by crying out upon his tyranny[19].                       [Footnote 19: The continental system induced                     Napoleon to exercise a real tyranny over Europe. We                     do not pretend to deny the fact; but we only wish                     to add, that this exterior despotism always induced                     a belief amongst foreigners, that Napoleon, who                     tyrannized so violently over nations which did not                     belong to him, must necessarily be the tyrant of                     his own subjects.]    When these causes were united, they aided in persuading the world  that Napoleon was really a despot. For, as Montesquieu observes, there  are some things which we believe at last, merely because we hear them  continually repeated. But if the government of Napoleon is considered  impartially, we shall feel convinced, that the despotism attributed to  him existed rather in words and forms, than in deeds. Let the acts of  his reign be scrutinized, and none will be found impressed with the  character of real despotism; that is to say, of despotism founded on  the mere arbitrary will and pleasure of the prince. On the contrary,  they all prove that the interest and aggrandizement of France entered  alone into the views of Napoleon, and that instead of being under a  tyrannical government, the people never enjoyed the benefits of  distributive justice with greater equality, and were never protected  more completely against the oppressions of public functionaries, and  of the higher ranks. He may, perhaps, be censured for having violated  certain laws, for violations in which the senate and the  representatives of the people were his accomplices. But laws are only  binding upon sovereigns in the ordinary course of things, and the most  rigid writers on the law of nations acknowledge this principle. When  extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances take place, it is the duty  of the sovereign to be above the law. In order to judge fairly of the  actions of a monarch, we must not consider them separately. Many an  action which, if"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22352"],[0,"American Boy's Life of Theodore Roosevelt (#10)"],[1,"asy, and more than once both hunters pitched headlong into the dirt and  soot, until they were covered from head to foot. But Theodore Roosevelt  was bound to get the elk, and kept on until the sweat was pouring down  his face and neck. Shot after shot was fired, and all three of the  animals were wounded, but still they kept on bounding away.    \"One is down!\" shouted Roosevelt at last. And the news proved true; the  smallest of the bulls had rocked unsteadily for a few seconds and gone  to earth. Then on and on after the remaining game sped the hunters,  panting and sweating as before.    \"The sweat streamed down in my eyes and made furrows in the sooty mud  that covered my face, from having fallen full length down on the burnt  earth,\" writes the dauntless hunter, in relating this story. \"I sobbed  for breath as I toiled at a shambling trot after them, as nearly done  out as could well be.\"    But he did not give up; and now the elk took a turn and went downhill,  with Theodore Roosevelt pitching after them, ready to drop from  exhaustion, but full of that grit to win out which has since won the  admiration of all who know the man. The second bull fell; and now but  one remained, and this dashed into a thicket. On its heels went the  daring hunter, running the chance of having the elk turn on him as soon  as cornered, in which case, had Roosevelt's rifle been empty, the  struggle for life on both sides would have been a fierce one.    In the midst of the thicket the hunter had to pause, for the elk was now  out of sight, and there was no telling what new course had been taken by  the game. At a distance he saw a yellow body under the evergreen trees,  and, taking hasty aim, fired. When he came up, he was somewhat dismayed  to learn that he had not brought down the elk, but a black-tail deer  instead. In the meantime, the elk got away, and it proved impossible to  pick up the trail again.    There is a valuable lesson to be learned from this hunting trip, and one  that all young readers should take to heart. It shows what sticking at a  thing can accomplish. Mr. Roosevelt had determined to get at least a  portion of that game, no matter what the labor and hardship involved.  Many a hunter would have given up in disgust or despair after the first  few shots were fired and it looked as if the elk were out of range and  intended to keep out. But this determined young man did not give up  thus easily. Hard as was that run up hill and down, and regardless of  the tumbles taken, and that he was so tired he could scarcely stand, he  kept on until two elk were brought down, and it was firmly settled that  the third could not be captured.    The way to accomplish anything in this life is to _stick at it_.  Theodore Roosevelt understood this truth even when he went to college,  for in the Harvard journal of which he was an editor he wrote, speaking  of foot-ball practice, \"What is most necessary is that every man should  realize the necessity of faithful and honest work, _every afternoon_.\"  He put \"every afternoon\" in italics himself, and he meant that every  foot-ball player who hoped to win in the inter-collegiate foot-ball  games should _stick at it_ until he had made himself as perfect a player  as possible. A victory worth gaining is worth working for, and usually  the hardest-earned victories are the sweetest.          CHAPTER VIII    BRINGING DOWN A GRIZZLY BEAR--BACK TO NEW YORK--APPOINTED A CIVIL  SERVICE COMMISSIONER--THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION      It was while in the Bighorn Mountains that Theodore Roosevelt got his  first shot at a bear. He had been wanting such a chance for a good many  years, but up to that date the bears had kept well out of his sight.    In his writings he has said much about bears, both common and grizzly,  and told of their habits, and how they have been tracked down and shot  at various times of the year. He holds to the opinion that the average  bear would rather run away than fight, yet he tells the story of how one  bear faced the hunter who had shot him, and gave the man one blow with  his powerful paw that proved fatal.    One day his companion of the hunt came riding in with the carcass of a  black bear killed in a network of hollows and ravines some miles from  their present camp.    \"The hollows are full of bear tracks,\" said Merrifield. \"I am sure, if  we go up there, we'll get one or more black bears and perhaps a  grizzly.\"    \"Then let us go by all means,\" responded Theodore Roosevelt. And no time  was lost in moving to the new locality.    The hunters had been out nearly all of the next day, when, on returning  through the forest toward nightfall, Roosevelt came across the footmarks  of a large bear. He tried to follow them, but night closed in on him,  and he had to return to camp. That very night the bear came around the  camp, looking for something to eat.    \"Let us try to bring him down,\" cried Roosevelt, seizing his rifle,  while his companion did the same. But outside it was pitch dark.    \"Do you see him?\" questioned Merrifield.    \"No.\"    \"Neither do I.\"    \"Listen.\"    Both listened, and at a distance heard the bear lumbering off slowly  through the woods. They went forward a short distance, then came to a  halt.    \"We'll have to give it up for the present,\" said Theodore Roosevelt.  \"But I am going to have him, sooner or later, if the thing is possible.\"    Early the next morning both of the hunters sallied forth and discovered  that the bear had been at the carcasses of some game left in the forest.  The tracks were fresh.    \"He has been here, no doubt of it,\" said Merrifield. \"Shall we wait for  him to come again?\"    \"We might as well,\" was the answer. \"He'll get hungry again, sooner or  later.\"    So the pair sat down to watch. But the bear was shy, and kept his  distance. Then it grew dark once more, so that but little could be seen  under the trees.    \"He knows enough to keep away,\" said Roosevelt's companion.    \"Hark!\" was the reply and both strained their ears. There was a faint  crackling of twigs, and they felt certain it was the bear. But it was  too dark to see anything; so both shouldered their rifles and walked  back to camp.    Here was another illustration of Theodore Roosevelt's method of sticking  at a thing. Two days had been spent in trying to get that bear, and yet  he did not give up. On the following morning he sallied forth once more,  as full of hope as before.    The bear had been at the carcass again, and the trail was now one to be  followed with ease.    \"I'm going to hunt him down to his lair,\" said Theodore Roosevelt, and  stalked off with his companion beside him. Soon they were again deep in  the woods, walking perhaps where the foot of white man had never before  trod. Fallen trees were everywhere, and over these they often had to  climb.    \"Getting closer,\" whispered Roosevelt's companion, and pointed to some  fresh claw scratches on the bark of fallen trees.    They now moved forward as silently as Indians, sure that the bear could  not be far off. Suddenly Merrifield dropped on his knee as if to take  aim. Roosevelt sprang to the front, with rifle raised. The bear was  there, standing upright, only a few paces away. Without hesitation  Theodore Roosevelt fired. His aim was true, and the great beast fell  with a bullet straight between the eyes. The leaden messenger had  entered his brain, and he died with scarcely a struggle.    \"The whole thing was over in twenty seconds from the time I caught sight  of the game,\" writes Mr. Roosevelt, in his book \"Hunting Trips on the  Prairies\" (Part II of \"Hunting Trips of a Ranchman\"). \"Indeed it was  over so quickly that the grizzly did not have time to show fight at all  or come a step toward me. It was the first I had ever seen, and I felt  not a little proud as I stood over the great brindled bulk which lay  stretched out at length in the cool shade of the evergreens. He was a  monstrous fellow, much larger than any I have seen since, whether alive  or brought in dead by hunters. As near as we could estimate he must have  weighed about twelve hundred pounds.\"    There is a bear story for you, boys. And the best of it is, it is every  word true. In later years Theodore Roosevelt brought down many more  grizzlies, but I doubt if he was as proud of them as he was of that  first capture.    While Theodore Roosevelt was spending a large part of his time in  hunting and in literary work, and in studying political economy, Grover  Cleveland's first term as President came to an end, and Benjamin  Harrison was inaugurated to fill the office of Chief Magistrate.    At that time the question of Civil Service was again being agitated.  Theodore Roosevelt was a warm advocate of the merit system, and knowing  this, President Harrison appointed him, in 1889, a Civil Service  Commissioner, and this office he held for six years, until his  resignation in 1895. When Benjamin Harrison's term of office was up, and  Grover Cleveland was reelected to the Presidency, it was thought that  Roosevelt would have to go, but his friend, the newly elected President,  wished him to remain as a commissioner, and he did so for two years  longer, thus serving both under a Republican and a Democratic  administration.    To some of my young readers the term Civil Service, as applied here, may  be a bit perplexing. For the benefit of such let me state that civil  service here applies to the thousands of persons who work for the  government, such as post-office clerks, letter carriers, clerks in the  various departments at Washington, like the Treasury, the Congressional  Library, the Government Printing Office, the War Department, and the  hundred and one other branches in which Uncle Sam needs assistance.    For seventy or eighty years these various positions had been under what  is commonly called the \"spoils system.\" \"To the victor belong the  spoils,\" had been the old motto, which generally meant that"]]]
