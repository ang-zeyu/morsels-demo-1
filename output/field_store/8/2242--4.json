In making mortar the cement is mixed with the sand and the  flour-like particles of the cement fit in between the grains of sand  occupying a part or all of the voids. The amount of cement required in a  mortar will naturally depend upon the amount of voids in the particular  sand with which it is mixed and since a correct estimate of the number  of barrels of cement per cubic yard of mortar is very important, and  since it is not always possible to make actual mixtures before bidding,  rules based on various theories have been formulated for determining  these quantities. In this volume the rule based on the theory outlined  by one of the authors in 1901 will be followed. The following is a  discussion of the authors' theory:    When loose sand is mixed with water, its volume or bulk is increased;  subsequent jarring will decrease its volume, but still leave a net gain  of about 10 per cent.; that is, 1 cu. ft. of dry sand becomes about 1.1  cu. ft. of damp sand. Not only does this increase in the volume of the  sand occur, but, instead of increasing the voids that can be filled with  cement, there is an absolute loss in the volume of available voids. This  is due to the space occupied by the water necessary to bring the sand to  the consistency of mortar; furthermore, there is seldom a perfect  mixture of the sand and cement in practice, thus reducing the available  voids. It is safe to call this reduction in available voids about 10 per  cent.    When loose, dry Portland cement is wetted, it shrinks about 15 per cent,  in volume, behaving differently from the sand, but it never shrinks back  to quite as small a volume as it occupies when packed tightly in a  barrel. Since barrels of different brands vary widely in size, the  careful engineer or contractor will test any brand he intends using in  large quantities, in order to ascertain exactly how much cement paste  can be made. He will find a range of from 3.2 cu. ft. to 3.8 cu. ft. per  barrel of Portland cement. Obviously the larger barrel may be cheaper  though its price is higher. Specifications often state the number of  cubic feet that will be allowed per barrel in mixing the concrete  ingredients, so that any rule or formula to be of practical value must  contain a factor to allow for the specified size of the barrel, and  another factor to allow for the actual number of cubic feet of paste  that a barrel will yield--the two being usually quite different.    The deduction of a rational, practical formula for computing the  quantity of cement required for a given mixture will now be given, based  upon the facts above outlined.         Let p = number of cu. ft. cement paste per bbl., as determined                       by actual test.           n = number of cu. ft. of cement per bbl., as specified in                       the specifications.           s = parts of sand (by volume) to one part of cement, as                       specified.           g = parts of gravel or broken stone (by volume) to one                       part of cement, as specified.           v = percentage of voids in the dry sand, as determined                       by test.           V = percentage of voids in the gravel or stone, as determined                       by test.    Then, in a mortar of 1 part cement to s parts sand, we have:                   n s = cu. ft. of dry sand to 1 bbl. of cement.               n s v = \"   \"   \"  voids in the dry sand.           0.9 n s v = \"   \"   \"  available voids in the wet sand.             1.1 n s = \"   \"   \"  wet sand.       p - 0.9 n s v = \"   \"   \"  cement paste in excess of the voids.    Therefore:         1.1 n s + (p - 0.9 n s v) = cu. ft. of mortar per bbl.    Therefore:                        27                            27       N = -------------------------   =    --------------------           1.1 n s + (p - 0.9 n s v)        p + n s (1.1 - 0.9 v)    N being the number of barrels of cement per cu. yd. of mortar.    When the mortar is made so lean that there is not enough cement paste to  fill the voids in the sand, the formula becomes:               27       N = -------           1.1 n s    A similar line of reasoning will give us a rational formula for  determining the quantity of cement in concrete; but there is one point  of difference between sand and gravel (or broken stone), namely, that  the gravel does not swell materially in volume when mixed with water.  However, a certain amount of water is required to wet the surface of the  pebbles, and this water reduces the available voids, that is, the voids  that can be filled by the mortar. With this in mind, the following  deduction is clear, using the nomenclature and symbols above given:               ng = cu. ft. of dry gravel (or stone).           ng V = \"    \"   \" voids in dry gravel.       0.9 ng V = \"    \"   \" \"available voids\" in the wet gravel.       p + n s (1.1 - 0.9 v) - 0.9 ng V = excess of mortar over the available                    voids in the wet gravel.       ng + p + n s (1.1 - 0.9 v) - 0.9 ng V = cu. ft. of concrete from                   1 bbl. cement.                                    27      N = -----------------------------------------------           p + n s (1.1 - 0.9v) + ng (1 - 0.9V)    N being the number of barrels of cement required to make 1 cu. yd. of  concrete.    This formula is rational and perfectly general. Other experimenters may  find it desirable to use constants slightly different from the 1.1 and  the 0.9, for fine sands swell more than coarse sands, and hold more  water.    The reader must bear in mind that when the voids in the sand exceed the  cement paste, and when the available voids in the gravel (or stone)  exceed the mortar, the formula becomes:               27       N = ------             ng    These formulas give the amounts of cement in mortars and concretes  compacted in place. Tables X to XIII are based upon the foregoing  theory, and will be found to check satisfactorily with actual tests.    In using these tables remember that the proportion of cement to sand is  by volume, and not by weight. If the specifications state that a barrel  of cement shall be considered to hold 4 cu. ft., for example, and that  the mortar shall be 1 part cement to 2 parts sand, then 2 barrel of  cement is mixed with 8 cu. ft. of sand, regardless of what is the actual  size of the barrel, and regardless of how much cement paste can be made  with a barrel of cement. If the specifications fail to state what the  size of a barrel will be, then the contractor is left to guess.      TABLE X.--BARRELS OF PORTLAND CEMENT PER CUBIC YARD OF MORTAR.

Then some of the credit of a fine sheep dog is due to  his training. Why, I was months working over Robin and the Prince. I had  them with goats and sheep from the time they were born. As soon as they  were big enough I began teaching them to come when I called 'em. A good  dog has got to learn to come to you when you speak. If he has done wrong  he has got to come and be punished. Some dogs will run away when they  see that you have caught them doing the wrong thing. You cannot let a  sheep dog do that.\"    \"But how do you train them so they won't?\"    \"I will tell you. It seems a heartless sort of way, but I had to do it.  I tied them with a long piece of rope; then I called them. As soon as  they came I spanked them good and hard, and afterward I'd pat them and  give them a scrap of meat. They understood in time. They would come  anyway--sure thing. If I whacked 'em it was all the same to them. By and  by when they got so they would mind, I didn't have to whack 'em, and now  it is seldom I lay hand to 'em. It was no pleasure to me, I can tell  you, and I quit it just as soon as I felt sure they would walk up like  gentlemen whenever I spoke, no matter if they knew beforehand that they  were to be whipped. You can see why this had to be, Don. Of course you  know such dogs have the nature of wolves. In fact the better the  shepherd dog, the more like a wolf he is. Now a wolf is a born enemy of  sheep. Sometimes the wolf in a shepherd dog will get the better of him  and he will turn about and kill the lambs instead of guarding them. If a  sheep-dog is once a killer he has to die. You can never be sure of him  again. So you cannot turn a dog loose on the range unless he will come  to you when you speak.\"    \"I suppose he might start killing sheep and you would not be able to get  control of him,\" ventured Donald, much interested.    \"That is just it! He must come even if he knows he is to be shot the  next minute. There is no safety for the sheep unless it is so. My dogs  would come to me willy-nilly.\"    \"Isn't it wonderful?\"    \"Yes, unless you have been months and months, as I was, getting them to  do it; and even then it is rather wonderful. But a thing quite as  wonderful as that is that they know every sheep in the flock. Let a ewe  from another fold come in and they will scent her quick as lightning.  And there is something else they will do: they understand well as  ourselves that sheep will walk right over ledges and into pits, one  after another; so the collies will stand guard at the edges of such  places and warn 'em off. What is that but human, I ask you?\"    Donald nodded.    \"The men down at Crescent say,\" went on Sandy smiling broadly, \"that I  am daffy about dogs--my own dogs most of all. Well, haven't I cause?  There is not a shepherd in this part of the country but would swap his  collies for mine; or they'd buy them. I've been offered many a dollar  for the two. But I'm no swapping my dogs, nor selling them, either!  Sometimes, you know, we fat up sheep for the market and sell them as  muttons. We then have to get the sheep into cars to send them off and it  is no so easy if they haven't the mind to go. Well, you should see  Robin and the Prince at the job. They will run right along the backs of  the herd, biting the necks of the leaders until they get them aimed  where they want 'em to go; then they'll nip the heels of the others till  they march up the planks into the cars neat as a line of soldiers. Or  they will drive a flock onto a boat the same way. It is a great thing to  get dogs that can do that. It takes more wit than a man has. Once a  sheep-raiser from California saw Robin down at Glen City getting a lot  of sheep off to Chicago on the train and he was hot for having him. He  offered me into the hundreds if I would let him take the collie back  with him.\"    \"And you wouldn't sell?\"    \"The money ain't coined would tempt me to part with either of my dogs!\"  Sandy replied, with a contented shake of his head.    He did not speak again, but lapsed into a thoughtful silence.    There were many of these long silences during those days on the hills  and to his surprise Donald had come to enjoy them. At first he had  looked forward eagerly to the coming of the camp-tender, who made his  rounds three times a week. Not only did this Mexican bring fresh-baked  bread, cold meat, and condensed milk to add to the campers' stock of  salt pork, lentils, and coffee, but he brought messages from the outside  world; gossip from the other herders; and now and then a letter from  Donald's father. These visits were as exciting as to meet an ocean liner  at sea. Gradually, however, Donald looked forward less and less to  seeing the tiny Mexican burros with their loaded paniers wend their way  up the hillsides. He grew into the shepherd life until like Sandy he  found himself courting the sense of isolation and almost resenting the  intrusion of the camp-tender.    He could now understand why the herders who had lived on the range for  years were such a silent lot of men. When his father and he had first  arrived at Crescent Ranch the shepherds had had so little to say that  Donald, who was a sensitive lad, had felt sure that the men did not like  to have them come. Later, however, he had found the herders kindly  despite their taciturn manner. It was not ill-will but habitual silence.    \"What a lot of things people say that they don't need to, Sandy,\" he  observed to the Scotchman one day.    Sandy chuckled outright.    \"So you have come to that way of thinking, have you? We'll make a  shepherd of you yet! Well, well, it is true enough. Folks chatter and  chatter and what does it amount to? Many's the time they wish afterward  they had held their tongues. But it is all as we're made. Some drop into  being contented on the range; others cannot bear the stillness. I was  ever happy alone in the open; but my brother Douglas was uneasy as a  colt.\"    \"I didn't know you had a brother, Sandy!\" exclaimed Donald, in surprise.    \"Aye, a little lad, five years younger than myself.\"    \"What--what became of him, Sandy?\"    \"What became of him--that's a question that I wish I could answer! He  came to Crescent Ranch years ago with my father and me and was about  the place for a long time. But he was all for the city. He hated the  quiet of the hills. He wanted to be seeing people and to be around in  the rush of things, and he begged my father to let him go to some big  place and find a job. My father was ever a strict man and he would have  none of the youngster's going off by himself. There came a day, though,  when the lad was so sore and unhappy that my father bid him set off for  the East. There was no other way to satisfy the boy. But it was a sad  time for my father--and for me, too.\"    \"Where did he go?\"    \"To some city on the coast, I dinna just know where. We were ever  thinking he would come back some day--but he never did. It is years now  since I have had tidings from him. But sometimes when I am here by  myself I cannot but wonder where he is and what has become of him. He'd  be a man near twenty-five now.\"    \"Does my father know this?\"    \"Likely not.\"    \"May I tell him?\"    \"Aye, to be sure. No boy should have secrets from his father.\"    \"I can't see why a boy should want to,\" declared Donald. \"Why, my father  and I are--well, we are the greatest friends in the world! I like to be  with him better than any one else.\"    \"So I figure. He must be thinking now and again that he'd like a sight  of you at Crescent instead of seeing Thornton every day.\"    \"What sort of a man is Thornton, Sandy?\"    \"What sort of a man do you take him to be?\"    \"I do not like him!\" was the prompt reply.    \"And wherefore?\"    \"Oh, I--don't--know.\"    \"A poor reason. Dinna say that about any man until you get a better  one.\"    Donald colored.    Sandy had dropped many a curt word that had brought the boy up,  standing. Whatever else the young herder was he was just. Not only did  Donald's liking, but his respect for him, increase.    Ah, what happy days they passed together! Donald became so attached to  the various camps that he hated to leave them. Sometimes he and Sandy  would stay in a spot a week, sometimes ten days; then onward and upward  over the great plateaus of the mountains they made their way. These flat  reaches of pasture-land were like huge steps. It was hard to realize  that they were constantly climbing. Yet up, up, up they went! Each camp  was several hundred feet higher than the last. As they went on the  pasturage became richer, the air cooler. Clear streams from melting,  snowy summits rushed along, leaving pathways of music behind them. With  a hawk's keenness Sandy chose the most fertile stretches of grass for  the flock.    \"The weight of the clip depends on good grazing,\" he explained to  Donald.    \"The clip?\"    \"Aye, the wool. Wool is sold by the pound, you must know. The better the  feed, the thicker the wool. We must look out, though, for poisoned  meadows. There do be many in this region.\"    \"Poisoned meadows!\"    \"Fields where poison herbage grows. Hundreds of sheep lose their lives  devouring poisonous weeds. Keep your eye out for signs, laddie.\"    \"Signs! Signs up here!\"    \"Where else? That is one of the many things our United States government  does for us. It posts notices of poisoned meadows to warn the grazers on  the range.\"    \"That is a pretty nice thing to do!\" Donald said.    \"Sure enough it is,\" agreed Sandy. \"Some day the survey will have all  the water-holes catalogued along with the poisoned herbage, and will  then be able to direct herders to the best grazing grounds. That is what  the government is busy trying to do now.\"    \"And yet sheep-owners kick at paying for permits,\" exclaimed Donald.  \"Why, lots of that permit money must come back in this way to the very  men who pay it.\"    \"For certain! And mind what I'm"]]]
