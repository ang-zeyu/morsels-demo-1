While his  thoughts thus ran over the past and present, he heard the firm step  of Dr. Wilkinson crossing the hall, and nearly at the same moment that  gentleman entered the room. There was no pity in his countenance--the  dark lines in his face seemed fixed in their most iron mould; and  briefly announcing to his trembling pupil that the time allowed him  for consideration had expired, he asked whether he were prepared to  acknowledge his fault. Louis meekly persisted in his denial, which  had only the effect of making the doctor consider him a more hardened  offender; and after a few words, expressing the strongest reprehension  of his wickedness and cowardice, he gave him severe caning, and sent  him immediately to bed, although it was but the middle of the day.  In spite of the better feelings which urged poor Louis to acknowledge  the justice, under the circumstances, of his master's proceedings, he  could not help thinking that he had been very hardly treated. He hurried  up stairs, glad to indulge his grief in silence. How many times, in the  affliction of the next few hours, did he repeat a little hymn he had  learned at home:        \"Thy lambs, dear Shepherd, that are weak,          Are thy peculiar care;      'Tis Thine in judgment to afflict,          And Thine in love to spare.        \"Though young in years, yet, oh! how oft          Have I a rebel been;      My punishment, O Lord, is mild,          Nor equals all my sin.        \"Since all the chastisements I feel          Are from Thy love alone,      Let not one murmuring thought arise,          But may Thy will be done.        \"Then let me blush with holy shame,          And mourn before my Lord,      That I have lived to Thee no more,          No more obeyed Thy word.\"                          --\"Hymns for Sunday-Schools\"    At last he fell asleep, and oh! to wake; from that sleep! It was surely  good to be afflicted, and in the happiness of his mind Louis forgot his  trouble. But he had yet to endure much more, and the bitterest part of  his punishment came the next morning, when, according to his master's  orders, he repaired to the study with his books. He had been desired to  remain in this room out of school-hours, and was forbidden to speak  to any of his school-fellows without leave. While he was sitting  there the first morning after the inquiry related in this chapter,  Dr. Wilkinson entered with a letter, and sat down at the table where  Louis was reading. As he opened his desk, he said, \"I have a painful  task to perform. This is a letter from your father, Louis Mortimer,  and he particularly requests that I should give him an account of  your conduct and your brother's; you know what an account I can give  of you both.\"    Louis had listened very attentively to his master's speech, and when  it was concluded he gave way to such a burst of sorrow as quite touched  the doctor. For some minutes he wept almost frantically, and then  clasping his hands, he implored Dr. Wilkinson not to tell his father  what had happened: \"It will break mamma's heart, it will break mamma's  heart, sir--do not tell my father.\"    \"Confess your fault, Louis, and I may then speak of amendment,\"  said the doctor.    \"I cannot, indeed--indeed I cannot. It will all come out by and bye:  you will see, sir--oh! you will see, sir,\" sobbed Louis, deprecating  the gathering of the angry cloud on the doctor's face. \"Oh! do not  tell mamma, for it is not true.\"    \"I do not wish to hear any more, sir,\" said the doctor, sternly.    \"Oh! what shall I do--what shall I do!\" cried Louis; and he pushed  his chair quickly from the table, and, throwing himself on his knees  by Dr. Wilkinson, seized the hand that was beginning to date the  dreaded letter--\"I assure you I did not, sir--I am speaking the truth.\"    \"As you always do, doubtless,\" said the doctor, drawing his hand  roughly away. \"Get up, sir; kneel to Him you have so deeply offended,  but not to me.\"    Louis rose, but stood still in the same place. \"Will you hear only this  one thing, sir? I will not say any thing more about my innocence--just  hear me, if you please, sir.\"    Dr. Wilkinson turned his head coldly towards him.    Louis dried his tears, and spoke with tolerable calmness: \"I have  one thing to ask, sir--will you allow me still to remain in the  second class, and to do my lessons always in this room? You will  then see if I can do without keys, or having any help.\"    \"I know you can if you choose,\" replied Dr. Wilkinson, coldly,  \"or I should not have placed you in that class.\"    \"But, if you please, sir, I know all,\"--Louis paused, he had promised  to say no more on that subject.    There was a little silence, during which Dr. Wilkinson looked earnestly  at Louis. At last he said, \"You may stay in the class; but, remember,  you are forbidden to speak to any of your school-fellows for the next  week without express permission.\"    \"Not to my brother, sir?\"    \"No; now go.\"    \"May I write to mamma?\"    \"Yes, if you wish it.\"    After timidly thanking the doctor, Louis returned to his seat, and  Dr. Wilkinson continued his letter, which went off by the same post  that took Louis' to his mother.          CHAPTER V.      \"Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous,    but grievous; nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the    peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are    exercised thereby.\"--Heb. xii. 11.      \"Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now have    I kept Thy word.\"--Psalm cxix. 67.      Perhaps there is no state more dangerous to a Christian's peace of  mind than one of continual prosperity. In adversity even the worldly  man will sometimes talk of resignation, and feel that it is a good  thing to be acquainted and at peace with God, and that when all human  help is cut off, it is a sweet thing to have a sure refuge in an  almighty Saviour. But in prosperity the ungodly never look to Him;  and His own children, carrying about with them a sinful nature, against  which they must continually maintain a warfare, are too apt to forget  the Giver in his gifts, and to imagine that all is well because nothing  occurs to disturb the regularity of their blessings.    Our little Louis, though the trial he now underwent was a bitter one,  and though at times it seemed almost too hard to be endured, learned by  degrees to feel that it was good for him. He had been in too high favor,  he had trusted too much in the good word of his school-fellows, and had  suffered the fear of man to deter him from his duty to God; and now,  isolated and looked upon as an unworthy member of the little society  to which he belonged, he learned to find his sole happiness in that  sweet communion which he had now solitary leisure to enjoy. His very  troubles carried him to a throne of grace; his desolate condition made  him feel that there was only One who never changed nor forsook His  people; only One who could understand and feel for the infirmities  and sorrows of a human creature; and though to the ungodly it is a  terror to know that there is \"nothing that is not manifest in God's  sight,\" to the true child of God it is an unspeakable comfort to feel  that his thoughts and actions are \"known long before\" by his unwearied  Guardian.    The effects of Louis' lonely communings were soon visible in his daily  conduct, and after his term of punishment had expired, the meekness of  his bearing, and the gentle lowliness of his demeanor, often disarmed  the most severe and unpitying of his youthful judges. There was no  servility in his manner, for he neither courted nor shunned observation;  nor, though he was as willing as ever to do a kind action for any  one, did he allow himself to be persuaded to give up all his time to  his idler school-fellows. There seemed more firmness and decision in his  naturally yielding disposition, and those who knew not the power of  assisting grace, looked and wondered at the firmness the sweet but weak  boy could at times assume. He would have told them it was not his own.  He was very quiet, and spoke little, even to his brother, of what was  passing in his mind, and sometimes his thoughts were so quietly happy  that he did not like to be spoken to. To Ferrers, Louis was as gentle  and courteous as to the rest of his companions, and, indeed, he had now  little other feeling towards him than that of sorrow and pity.    There had been an unusual noise in the study one evening, while Louis  was absent, and when he entered it, he found the confusion attendant on  a grand uproar. Very little was doing, and tokens of the late skirmish  lay about the floor in torn and scattered books, and overthrown forms.  Among others, Ferrers was hunting for a missing book, but to discover  it in such a chaos was a difficult task, especially as no one would  now allow the candles to be used in the search.    With many expressions, so unfitted for refined ears that I do not choose  to present them to my reader, Ferrers continued his search, now and then  attempting to snatch a candle from the table, in which he was regularly  foiled by those sitting there.    \"Well, at least have the civility to move and let me see if it is under  the table,\" he said at length.    \"You have hindered us long enough,\" said Salisbury; \"Smith, Jones, and  I have done nothing to-night. If you will have rows, you must e'en take  the consequences.\"    \"Can't you get under the form?\" asked Smith, derisively.    Ferrers was going to make some angry, reply, when Louis dived between  the table and the form, with some trouble, and, at the expense of  receiving a few unceremonious kicks, recovered the book and gave it  to Ferrers, who hardly thanked him, but leaning his head on his hand,  seemed almost incapable of doing any thing. Presently he looked up,  and asked in a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19856"],[0,"A Study of Pueblo Architecture: Tusayan and Cibola (#10)"],[1,"populous to establish  many outlying settlements. They still identify these with ruins on the  detached mesas in the valley to the south and along the Moen-kopi  (\"place of flowing water\") and other intermittent streams in the west.  These sites were occupied for the purpose of utilizing cultivable tracts  of land in their vicinity, and the remotest settlement, about 45 miles  west, was especially devoted to the cultivation of cotton, the place  being still called by the Navajo and other neighboring tribes, the  \"cotton planting ground.\" It is also said that several of the larger  ruins along the course of the Moen-kopi were occupied by groups of the  Snake, the Coyote, and the Eagle who dwelt in that region for a long  period before they joined the people in Tusayan. The incursions of  foreign bands from the north may have hastened that movement, and the  Oraibi say they were compelled to withdraw all their outlying colonies.  An episode is related of an attack upon the main village when a number  of young girls were carried off, and 2 or 3 years afterward the same  marauders returned and treated with the Oraibi, who paid a ransom in  corn and received all their girls back again. After a quiet interval the  pillaging bands renewed their attacks and the settlements on the  Moen-kopi were vacated. They were again occupied after another peace was  established, and this condition of alternate occupancy and abandonment  seems to have existed until within quite recent time.    While the Asa were still sojourning in Canyon de Chelly, and before the  arrival of the Hano, another bloody scene had been enacted in Tusayan.  Since the time of the Antelope Canyon feuds there had been enmity  between Awatubi and some of the other villages, especially Walpi, and  some of the Sikyatki refugees had transmitted their feudal wrongs to  their descendants who dwelt in Awatubi. They had long been perpetrating  all manner of offenses; they had intercepted hunting parties from the  other villages, seized their game, and sometimes killed the hunters;  they had fallen upon men in outlying corn fields, maltreating and  sometimes slaying them, and threatened still more serious outrage.  Awatubi was too strong for Walpi to attack single-handed, so the  assistance of the other villages was sought, and it was determined to  destroy Awatubi at the close of a feast soon to occur. This was the  annual \"feast of the kwakwanti,\" which is still maintained and is held  during the month of November by each village, when the youths who have  been qualified by certain ordeals are admitted to the councils. The  ceremonies last several days, and on the concluding night special rites  are held in the kivas. At these ceremonies every man must be in the kiva  to which he belongs, and after the close of the rites they all sleep  there, no one being permitted to leave the kiva until after sunrise on  the following day.    There was still some little intercourse between Awatubi and Walpi, and  it was easily ascertained when this feast was to be held. On the day of  its close, the Walpi sent word to their allies \"to prepare the war arrow  and come,\" and in the evening the fighting bands from the other villages  assembled at Walpi, as the foray was to be led by the chief of that  village. By the time night had fallen something like 150 marauders had  met, all armed, of course; and of still more ominous import than their  weapons were the firebrands they carried--shredded cedar bark loosely  bound in rolls, resinous splinters of piñon, dry greasewood (a furze  very easily ignited), and pouches full of pulverized red peppers.      [Illustration: Plate XII. Chukubi, plan.]    Secure in the darkness from observation, the bands followed the Walpi  chief across the valley, every man with his weapons in hand and a bundle  of inflammables on his back. Beaching the Awatubi mesa they cautiously  crept up the steep, winding trail to the summit, and then stole round  the village to the passages leading to the different courts holding the  kivas, near which they hid themselves. They waited till just before the  gray daylight came, then the Walpi chief shouted his war cry and the  yelling bands rushed to the kivas. Selecting their positions, they were  at them in a moment, and quickly snatching up the ladders through the  hatchways, the only means of exit, the doomed occupants were left as  helpless as rats in a trap. Fire was at hand in the numerous little  cooking pits, containing the jars of food prepared for the celebrants,  the inflammable bundles were lit and tossed into the kivas, and the  piles of firewood on the terraced roofs were thrown down upon the blaze,  and soon each kiva became a furnace. The red pepper was then cast upon  the fire to add its choking tortures, while round the hatchways the  assailants stood showering their arrows into the mass of struggling  wretches. The fires were maintained until the roofs fell in and buried  and charred the bones of the victims. It is said that every male of  Awatubi who had passed infancy perished in the slaughter, not one  escaping. Such of the women and children as were spared were taken out,  and all the houses were destroyed, after which the captives were divided  among the different villages.    The date of this last feudal atrocity can be made out with some degree  of exactness, because in 1692, Don Diego Vargas with a military force  visited Tusayan and mentions Awatubi as a populous village at which he  made some halt. The Hano (Tewa) claim that they have lived in Tusayan  for five or six generations, and that when they arrived there was no  Awatubi in existence; hence it must have been destroyed not long after  the close of the seventeenth century.    Since the destruction of Awatubi only one other serious affray has  occurred between the villages; that was between Oraibi and Walpi. It  appears that after the Oraibi withdrew their colonies from the south and  west they took possession of all the unoccupied planting grounds to the  east of the village, and kept reaching eastward till they encroached  upon some land claimed by the Walpi. This gave rise to intermittent  warfare in the outlying fields, and whenever the contending villagers  met a broil ensued, until the strife culminated in an attack upon Walpi.  The Oraibi chose a day when the Walpi men were all in the field on the  east side of the mesa, but the Walpi say that their women and dogs held  the Oraibi at bay until the men came to the rescue. A severe battle was  fought at the foot of the mesa, in which the Oraibi were routed and  pursued across the Middle Mesa, where an Oraibi chief turned and  implored the Walpi to desist. A conciliation was effected there, and  harmonious relations have ever since existed between them. Until within  a few years ago the spot where they stayed pursuit was marked by a  stone, on which a shield and a dog were depicted, but it was a source of  irritation to the Oraibi and it was removed by some of the Walpi.    In the early part of the eighteenth century the Ute from the north, and  the Apache from the south made most disastrous inroads upon the  villages, in which Walpi especially suffered. The Navajo, who then lived  upon their eastern border, also suffered severely from the same bands,  but the Navajo and the Tusayan were not on the best terms and never made  any alliance for a common defense against these invaders.    Hano was peopled by a different linguistic stock from that of the other  villages--a stock which belongs to the Rio Grande group. According to  Polaka, the son of the principal chief, and himself an enterprising  trader who has made many journeys to distant localities--and to others,  the Hano once lived in seven villages on the Rio Grande, and the village  in which his forefathers lived was called Tceewáge. This, it is said,  is the same as the present Mexican village of Peña Blanca.    The Hano claim that they came to Tusayan only after repeated  solicitation by the Walpi, at a time when the latter were much harassed  by the Ute and Apache. The story, as told by Kwálakwai, who lives in  Hano, but is not himself a Hano, begins as follows:      Long ago the Hopi´tuh were few and were continually harassed by the    Yútamo (Ute), Yuíttcemo (Apache), and Dacábimo (Navajo). The chiefs    of the Tcuin nyumu (Snake people) and the Hánin nyumu (Bear people)    met together and made the ba´ho (sacred plume stick) and sent it    with a man from each of these people to the house of the Tewa,    called Tceewádigi, which was far off on the Múina (river) near    Alavia (Santa Fé).    The messengers did not succeed in persuading the Tewa to come and the  embassy was sent three times more. On the fourth visit the Tewa  consented to come, as the Walpi had offered to divide their land and  their waters with them, and set out for Tusayan, led by their own chief,  the village being left in the care of his son. This first band is said  to have consisted of 146 women, and it was afterwards followed by  another and perhaps others.    Before the Hano arrived there had been a cessation of hostile inroads,  and the Walpi received them churlishly and revoked their promises  regarding the division of land and waters with them. They were shown  where they could build houses for themselves on a yellow sand mound on  the east side of the mesa just below the gap. They built there, but they  were compelled to go for their food up to Walpi. They could get no  vessels to carry their food in, and when they held out their hands for  some the Walpi women mockingly poured out hot porridge and scalded the  fingers of the Hano.    After a time the Ute came down the valley on the west side of the mesa,  doing great harm again, and drove off the Walpi flocks andiron Then the  Hano got ready for war; they tied buckskins around their loins, whitened  their legs with clay, and stained their body and arms with dark red  earth (oche"]]]
