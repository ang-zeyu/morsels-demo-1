Such he  proved himself. Sailing in advance of the governor, in the ship with Sir  Thomas Gates and Sir George Somers, and wrecked with them off the  Bermudas, he did not forget his duty in the \"plenty, peace, and ease\" of  that paradise. The ship's bell was rescued from the wreck to ring for  morning and evening prayer, and for the two sermons every Sunday. There  were births and funerals and a marriage in the shipwrecked company, and  at length, when their makeshift vessel was ready, they embarked for  their desired haven, there to find only the starving threescore  survivors of the colony. They gathered together, a pitiable remnant, in  the church, where Master Buck \"made a zealous and sorrowful prayer\"; and  at once, without losing a day, they embarked for a last departure from  Virginia, but were met at the mouth of the river by the tardy ships of  Lord de la Warr. The next morning, Sunday, June 10, 1610, Lord de la  Warr landed at the fort, where Gates had drawn up his forlorn platoon of  starving men to receive him. The governor fell on his knees in prayer,  then led the way to the church, and, after service and a sermon from  the chaplain, made an address, assuming command of the colony.    Armed, under the new charter, with adequate authority, the new governor  was not slow in putting on the state of a viceroy. Among his first cares  was to provide for the external dignity of worship. The church, a  building sixty feet by twenty-four, built long enough before to be now  in need of repairs, was put into good condition, and a brave sight it  was on Sundays to see the Governor, with the Privy Council and the  Lieutenant-General and the Admiral and the Vice-Admiral and the Master  of the Horse, together with the body-guard of fifty halberdiers in fair  red cloaks, commanded by Captain Edward Brewster, assembled for worship,  the governor seated in the choir in a green velvet chair, with a velvet  cushion on a table before him. Few things could have been better adapted  to convince the peculiar public of Jamestown that divine worship was  indeed a serious matter. There was something more than the parade of  government manifested by his lordship in the few months of his reign;  but the inauguration of strong and effective control over the lazy,  disorderly, and seditious crowd to be dealt with at Jamestown was  reserved for his successor, Sir Thomas Dale, who arrived in May, 1611,  in company with the Rev. Alexander Whitaker, the \"apostle of Virginia.\"    It will not be possible for any to understand the relations of this  colony to the state of parties in England without distinctly recognizing  that the Puritans were not a party _against_ the Church of England, but  a party _in_ the Church of England. The Puritan party was the party of  reform, and was strong in a deep fervor of religious conviction widely  diffused among people and clergy, and extending to the highest places of  the nobility and the episcopate. The anti-Puritan party was the  conservative or reactionary party, strong in the _vis inertiae_, and in  the king's pig-headed prejudices and his monstrous conceit of  theological ability and supremacy in the church; strong also in a  considerable adhesion and zealous cooeperation from among his nominees,  the bishops. The religious division was also a political one, the  Puritans being known as the party of the people, their antagonists as  the court party. The struggle of the Puritans (as distinguished from the  inconsiderable number of the Separatists) was for the maintenance of  their rights within the church; the effort of their adversaries, with  the aid of the king's prerogative, was to drive or harry them out of the  church. It is not to be understood that the two parties were as yet  organized as such and distinctly bounded; but the two tendencies were  plainly recognized, and the sympathies of leading men in church or state  were no secret.    The Virginia Company was a Puritan corporation.[44:1] As such, its  meetings and debates were the object of popular interest and of the  royal jealousy. Among its corporators were the brothers Sandys, sons of  the Puritan Archbishop of York, one of whom held the manor of Scrooby.  Others of the corporation were William Brewster, of Scrooby, and his son  Edward. In the fleet of Sir Thomas Gates, May, 1609, were noted  Puritans, one of whom, Stephen Hopkins, \"who had much knowledge in the  Scriptures and could reason well therein,\" was clerk to that \"painful  preacher,\" but not strict conformist, Master Richard Buck. The intimate  and sometimes official relations of the Virginia Company not only with  leading representatives of the Puritan party, but with the Pilgrims of  Leyden, whom they would gladly have received into their own colony, are  matter of history and of record. It admits of proof that there was a  steady purpose in the Company, so far as it was not thwarted by the king  and the bishops of the court party, to hold their unruly and  ill-assorted colony under Puritan influences both of church and  government.[45:1] The fact throws light on the remoter as well as the  nearer history of Virginia. Especially it throws light on the memorable  administration of Sir Thomas Dale, which followed hard upon the  departure of Lord de la Warr and his body-guard in red cloaks.    The Company had picked their man with care--\"a man of good conscience  and knowledge in divinity,\" and a soldier and disciplinarian proved in  the wars of the Low Countries--a very prototype of the great Cromwell.  He understood what manner of task he had undertaken, and executed it  without flinching. As a matter of course--it was the way in that  colony--there was a conspiracy against his authority. There was no  second conspiracy under him. Punishment was inflicted on the ringleaders  so swift, so terrible, as to paralyze all future sedition. He put in  force, in the name of the Company, a code of \"Laws, Divine, Moral, and  Martial,\" to which no parallel can be found in the severest legislation  of New England. An invaluable service to the colony was the abolition of  that demoralizing socialism that had been enforced on the colonists, by  which all their labor was to be devoted to the common stock. He gave out  land in severalty, and the laborer enjoyed the fruits of his own  industry and thrift, or suffered the consequences of his laziness. The  culture of tobacco gave the colony a currency and a staple of export.    With Dale was associated as chaplain Alexander Whitaker, son of the  author of the Calvinistic Lambeth Articles, and brother of a Separatist  preacher of London. What was his position in relation to church parties  is shown by his letter to his cousin, the \"arch-Puritan,\" William Gouge,  written after three years' residence in Virginia, urging that  nonconformist clergymen should come over to Virginia, where no question  would be raised on the subject of subscription or the surplice. What  manner of man and minister he was is proved by a noble record of  faithful work. He found a true workfellow in Dale. When this  statesmanlike and soldierly governor founded his new city of Henrico up  the river, and laid out across the stream the suburb of Hope-in-Faith,  defended by Fort Charity and Fort Patience, he built there in sight from  his official residence the parsonage of the \"apostle of Virginia.\" The  course of Whitaker's ministry is described by himself in a letter to a  friend: \"Every Sabbath day we preach in the forenoon and catechise in  the afternoon. Every Saturday, at night, I exercise in Sir Thomas Dale's  house.\" But he and his fellow-clergymen did not labor without aid, even  in word and doctrine. When Mr. John Rolfe was perplexed with questions  of duty touching his love for Pocahontas, it was to the old soldier,  Dale, that he brought his burden, seeking spiritual counsel. And it was  this \"religious and valiant governor,\" as Whitaker calls him, this \"man  of great knowledge in divinity, and of a good conscience in all things,\"  that \"labored long to ground the faith of Jesus Christ\" in the Indian  maiden, and wrote concerning her, \"Were it but for the gaining of this  one soul, I will think my time, toils, and present stay well spent.\"    The progress of the gospel in reclaiming the unhappy colony to  Christian civilization varies with the varying fortunes of contending  parties in England. Energetic efforts were made by the Company under  Sandys, the friend of Brewster, to send out worthy colonists; and the  delicate task of finding young women of good character to be shipped as  wives to the settlers was undertaken conscientiously and successfully.  Generous gifts of money and land were contributed (although little came  from them) for the endowment of schools and a college for the promotion  of Christ's work among the white people and the red. But the course of  events on both sides of the sea may be best illustrated by a narrative  of personal incidents.    In the year 1621, an East India Company's chaplain, the Rev. Patrick  Copland, who perhaps deserves the title of the first English missionary  in India, on his way back from India met, probably at the Canaries, with  ships bound for Virginia with emigrants. Learning from these something  of the needs of the plantation, he stirred up his fellow-passengers on  the \"Royal James,\" and raised the sum of seventy pounds, which was paid  to the treasurer of the Virginia Company; and, being increased by other  gifts to one hundred and twenty-five pounds, was, in consultation with  Mr. Copland, appropriated for a free school to be called the \"Eas"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20191"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Durham (#10)"],[1,"a girdle and two gold bracelets were found  along with the stole and maniple in the grave, in 1827, and leaves very  little doubt that they are the ones mentioned above. The bones of the  saint were quite intact, and none were missing. They were, with the  other relics, placed in a new coffin, and the grave re-covered. Some  portions of the inner coffin, with the stole, two maniples, the girdle  and bracelets and fragments of the robes are now carefully preserved in  the Dean and Chapter Library. A large gold cross found among the robes,  decorated with garnets, and of workmanship of the time of S. Cuthbert is  also preserved in the library. These discoveries seem to speak for  themselves, and to leave very little room for doubt that the body  exhumed and examined in 1827 was really that of the patron saint of the  church.      [4] Photographs, coloured by the late J.I. Williamson, are        exhibited in the South Kensington Museum.    There were also found in the grave bones of infants, supposed to be  relics of the Holy Innocents, and a skull, most probably that of S.  Oswald, which was known to have been placed in the coffin of S.  Cuthbert.    Two smooth grooves may be observed on the platform, which are _said_ to  have been worn into the stone by the knees or feet of generations of  pilgrims visiting the shrine.    There are several other tombs and monuments in this chapel, chiefly wall  tablets of not exceptional interest. At the north end, however, is a  colossal statue of the last of the prince bishops, Bishop van Mildert,  who died in 1836. The monument is of white marble, the figure seated on  a throne and holding a book. It was erected by public subscription, the  sculptor being John Gibson, R.A. Near this monument is a blue slab  covering the remains of Bishop Anthony Bek, patriarch of Jerusalem, who  died in 1310. It was to bring in the body of this bishop that some  writers have thought the north doorway of the Nine Altars Chapel was  constructed. This is, as we have seen already, extremely improbable.    The student of architecture will find very much to interest him in this  Chapel of the Nine Altars. The beautiful sculpture and variety in the  capitals of the shafts of wall arcading, not to mention the rich carving  of the vaulting bosses and capitals of the vaulting shafts, will well  repay his earnest study.    [Illustration: The Galilee Chapel.]    [Illustration: The Galilee Chapel.]    [Illustration: Capital in Galilee Chapel.]    The #Galilee# or #Lady Chapel# is situated at the west end of the  nave. It is well known that for some reason women were not allowed to  enter any church where S. Cuthbert's shrine stood, nor even any church  dedicated to him. At Lindisfarne a separate church was provided for  them, and at Durham the Galilee Chapel was added for the same purpose.  It was alleged that S. Cuthbert himself had made this rule, but there is  no proof that he ever issued such a command. The Venerable Bede makes  no mention of any special feeling of antipathy to women on the part of  the saint. Bede was contemporary with, and survived S. Cuthbert  forty-eight years. Whatever may have been the origin of the practice, it  is certain that in later times women were jealously excluded from the  churches of S. Cuthbert, and to this circumstance we owe, in the chapel  under our consideration, the most beautiful and perfect example of  Transitional Norman architecture existing in England.    [Illustration: Paintings in the Galilee Chapel.]    Let us recall briefly the circumstances attending its erection. Hugh  Pudsey, who occupied the episcopal throne, 1153 to 1195, commenced to  build a Lady Chapel at the east end of the church. The work had not gone  far before accidents happened, and cracks and fissures appeared in the  walls, which the builder thought \"gave manifest indication that it was  not acceptable to God and His servant S. Cuthbert.\"[5] The work was  therefore abandoned, and another chapel was commenced at the west end of  the church, \"into which women might lawfully enter, so that they who had  not bodily access to the secret things of the holy place, might have  some solace from the contemplation of them\" (Geoffrey de Coldingham).  Pudsey caused to be moved here the marble shafts and bases he had  previously brought from \"beyond the sea,\" and intended to be used in the  construction of his chapel at the east end. Entering the chapel by the  steps leading from the Norman nave, the visitor is at once impressed  with the lightness and delicacy of the work before him, as compared with  the massive grandeur of the Norman cathedral behind. Here we have, in  fact, one of the latest uses of the round arch influenced by the rapidly  developing Early English Gothic. In plan the chapel consists of a nave  with double aisles, which perhaps might be more properly called five  aisles. These are divided by arcades, each of which is of four bays.  These arches and the columns which support them are the chief beauty and  characteristic of the chapel. The arches are semi-circular, of one  order, with three lines of chevron, one on each face, and one on the  soffit between two roll mouldings. The capitals are light and graceful  and carved with a volute, and the columns clusters of marble and  freestone shafts. The arches, however, rest on the marble columns, which  are, no doubt, those previously alluded to. The whole seems to have been  coloured in fresco, and remains of this are still to be seen. The stone  shafts, which alternate with those of marble, do not carry any of the  weight of the arch, and are, undoubtedly, an addition, probably in the  time of Cardinal Langley, when they must have been added, with a view  to improving the appearance. The dimensions of the chapel are  forty-seven feet from east to west, and seventy-six feet from north to  south. The existing roof and the three perpendicular windows on the west  end are also additions by Cardinal Langley. On the walls above what were  once the altars of the Virgin and Our Lady of Pity, remains of fresco  painting may be noticed, all that remains of what has evidently been  beautiful work. These were only brought to light by the removal of  successive coats of whitewash with which they had been covered.      [5] Geoffrey de Coldingham.    [Illustration: Detail of the Galilee Chapel.]    When the Galilee was erected, access from the church was by the great  west door of the cathedral. This was, however, closed up by Cardinal  Langley, who constructed the two doorways at the end of the aisles by  which the chapel is now entered. Those portions of the Norman wall  arcading, which had to be removed by reason of the breaking through of  the new doorways, were used to fill up the lower part of the great west  door. The latter was again removed in 1846, when the west doorway was  re-opened. Langley's two doorways have four centred arches enclosed  beneath a square label moulding, with shields bearing the Cardinal's  coat-of-arms in each spandrel. To Langley also may be attributed the  five massive buttresses on the exterior of the western wall of the  chapel, which partly cover the arcading and panelling with which it was  decorated. In adding the new roof Langley raised the walls above the  arches to carry it, giving a somewhat peculiar effect to the interior.  The original roof lines can still be made out on the west wall. Of the  contents of the chapel remaining, perhaps the most interesting to the  visitor is the grave and site of the shrine of the Venerable Bede. The  shrine, like that of S. Cuthbert's, is gone, and all that remains is the  stone slab on which it once stood, and which bears the inscription  (placed there in 1831):        Hac sunt in Fossa      Baedae Venerabilis Ossa    This remarkable man was contemporary with S. Cuthbert, whom, as we have  said, he survived forty-eight years. His holiness and piety, together  with his great learning, earned for him the title Venerable, and after  his death, in 735, his bones were enshrined. Of his parentage we know  nothing, except that, from his own writings, he was born in the  territory of the Abbey of Wearmouth. At the age of seven he was being  educated in that monastery, and by the time he was ten years old he  moved to the newly-founded Abbey on the Tyne, at Jarrow. He had able and  learned teachers in Benedict Bishop and Ceolfrid, and appears to have  turned his advantages to the best account. Deacon at nineteen, and  priest at twenty-nine years of age, he led a holy and studious life.  After his ordination he wrote his \"Commentaries on the Scriptures,\" and  writings on all the known sciences--geography, arithmetic, and  astronomy. The greatest work of his life is, however, his  \"Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation,\" to which we owe all our  knowledge of the introduction of Christianity into Great Britain, and  the early history of the English Church. It is dedicated to King  Ceolwulf. His information was collected from various sources--by letter  as to Canterbury, by communication with bishops and priors as to England  generally, and from personal knowledge and very recent tradition as to  Northumbria. He lived most of his long life between the monasteries of  Monkwearmouth and Jarrow, and was buried at the latter. In the year 1022  his remains were secretly removed from Jarrow by Elfrid, who was the  most unscrupulous relic-hunter of that time, who deposited a portion of  them in the same coffin with those of S. Cuthbert. From here they were  removed by Bishop Pudsey, and placed in the newly-erected Galilee  Chapel, where he caused them to be enclosed in a magnificent shrine.  \"There, in a silver casket gilt with gold, hee laid the bones of  Venerable Bede, and erected a costly and magnificent shrine over it.\"[6]  When the shrine was destroyed at the suppression of the monastery, in  1542, the bones were interred beneath the place it occupied, where they"]]]
