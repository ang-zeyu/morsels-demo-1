SUTTER'S MILL, COLOMA, WHERE GOLD WAS ACCIDENTALLY DISCOVERED  IN JANUARY, 1848                                        FACES PAGE 42    This fine engraving follows closely, in all essential details, that in  the Voyages en Californie et dans l'Oregon, par M. de Saint-Amant,  Envoye du Gouvernement Francais, en 1851-1852 (Paris, 1854). The  engravings in that volume, although poorly printed on a cheap grade of  book-paper, are noted for their accuracy, and are interesting as  showing the methods etc. of the miners while Shirley was writing her  Letters. The tail-race, in the foreground, is where James Wilson  Marshall and Peter L. Wimmer first saw the nuggets, but Marshall was  the first to pick up a specimen. Much has been written of Marshall; the  Wimmers were of the Western pioneer type.    3. GROUND-SLUICING                                      FACES PAGE 86    This spirited engraving is resketched, in essentials, from a woodcut in  Henry De Groot's Recollections of California Mining Life (1884), also  in his Gold Mines and Mining in California (1885). Ground-sluicing is  done in winter, when water is abundant and the ground soft, the  pay-dirt being thrown into a channel made for the purpose, and down  which the water rushes. The gold settles on the bed-rock, and is  collected later, when the water-run has subsided.    4. PAN, CRADLE OR ROCKER, LONG-TOM, SLUICE-WASHING--DRIFTING, WINDLASS  AND SHAFT                                              FACES PAGE 132    The varied and animated scene depicted in this plate is resketched from  De Groot's Gold Mines and Mining in California. (See note to plate 3.)  In the foreground, on the left, a miner washes dirt in a pan. Above,  and to the left, a miner washes in a rocker or cradle, the pay-dirt  coming in a tram-car from the tunnel, in which are drift-diggings. The  men at the windlass are sinking a shaft, prospecting for drift-deposits.  To the right, in the foreground, three men are working a long-tom,  which, in point of time, followed the rocker. One of the miners is  keeping the dirt stirred up in the tom, under which is set a riffle-box  with quicksilver to catch the gold. In the background miners are hand  or shovel sluicing, in which the riffle-box of the long-tom is  dispensed with.    5. INTERIOR OF MINERS' LOG CABIN--ONE PARTNER COOKING FOR NIGHT-FARING  VISITORS                                               FACES PAGE 176    This interesting engraving also follows, in all essentials, that in de  Saint-Amant's Voyages. (See note to plate 2, supra.) The owners of the  cabin had evidently retired for the night, and were awakened by their  visitors. The upper bunk, or berth, has been vacated by the miner  cooking. We will say two of the visitors have been prospecting, and are  reasoning with the third, who appears to have come from that state of  the Union \"where one must demonstrate.\" The rifle close to the bunk of  the sleeping miner, the mining implements littered over the floor, the  bottles etc. on the shelf-table, are features that require no  explanation.    6. SALOON IN A MINING-CAMP--MONTE-DEALER, MINERS, ESPANOLA AND  MEXICANA                                               FACES PAGE 258    This is a composite engraving, the artist having combined several old  prints. The Spanish woman is shown in a national costume, and her air  and attitude indicate her ability to take care of herself. The Mexican  girl at the bar, and armed, is a type of the Mexicana mentioned by  Shirley.    7. WASHING IN ROCKERS ON RIVER'S BRINK--MINERS PACKING PAY-GRAVEL  IN BUCKETS                                             FACES PAGE 280    This realistic plate follows closely, in essentials, that in de  Saint-Amant's Voyages. (See note to plate 2, ante.) The bare declivity  has evidently been worked, and the auriferous gravel must now be packed  from the heights. A barrow with shafts at only one end may be seen  beside one of the rockers, and it is conjectured that not all the  gravel is picked in buckets. The miner seen in the background of  brushwood digs the pay-gravel.    8. WASHING IN LONG-TOM WITH WATER FROM FLUME--CHEAPER THAN PUMPING  FROM RIVER                                             FACES PAGE 334    This beautiful engraving follows closely that in de Saint-Amant's  Voyages. (See note to plate 2, ante.) Here the miners found it more  economical to purchase water from a fluming company than to pump it  from the river. The belt and pulley is used to drive a Chinese pump  which keeps dry the pit now being worked.          _The_ Shirley Letters          Letter _the_ First    Part One    _The_ JOURNEY _to_ RICH BAR    RICH BAR, EAST BRANCH _of the_ NORTH FORK _of_ FEATHER RIVER,    _September_ 13, 1851.      I can easily imagine, dear M., the look of large wonder which gleams  from your astonished eyes when they fall upon the date of this letter.  I can figure to myself your whole surprised attitude as you exclaim,  \"What, in the name of all that is restless, has sent 'Dame Shirley' to  Rich Bar? How did such a shivering, frail, home-loving little thistle  ever float safely to that far-away spot, and take root so kindly, as it  evidently has, in that barbarous soil? Where, in this living, breathing  world of ours, lieth that same Rich Bar, which, sooth to say, hath a  most taking name? And, for pity's sake, how does the poor little fool  expect to amuse herself there?\"    Patience, sister of mine. Your curiosity is truly laudable, and I trust  that before you read the postscript of this epistle it will be fully  and completely relieved. And, first, I will merely observe, _en  passant_, reserving a full description of its discovery for a future  letter, that said Bar forms a part of a mining settlement situated on  the East Branch of the North Fork of Feather River, \"away off up in the  mountains,\" as our \"little Faresoul\" would say, at almost the highest  point where, as yet, gold has been discovered, and indeed within fifty  miles of the summit of the Sierra Nevada itself. So much, at present,  for our _local_, while I proceed to tell you of the propitious--or  unpropitious, as the result will prove--winds which blew us hitherward.    You already know that F., after suffering for an entire year with fever  and ague, and bilious, remittent, and intermittent fevers,--this  delightful list varied by an occasional attack of jaundice,--was  advised, as a _dernier ressort_, to go into the mountains. A friend,  who had just returned from the place, suggested Rich Bar as the  terminus of his health-seeking journey, not only on account of the  extreme purity of the atmosphere, but because there were more than a  thousand people there already, and but one physician, and as his  strength increased, he might find in that vicinity a favorable opening  for the practice of his profession, which, as the health of his purse  was almost as feeble as that of his body, was not a bad idea.    F. was just recovering from a brain-fever when he concluded to go to  the mines; but, in spite of his excessive debility, which rendered him  liable to chills at any hour of the day or night, he started on the  seventh day of June--mounted on a mule, and accompanied by a jackass to  carry his baggage, and a friend who kindly volunteered to assist him in  spending his money--for this wildly beautiful spot. F. was compelled by  sickness to stop several days on the road. He suffered intensely, the  trail for many miles being covered to the depth of twelve feet with  snow, although it was almost midsummer when he passed over it. He  arrived at Rich Bar the latter part of June, and found the revivifying  effect of its bracing atmosphere far surpassing his most sanguine  hopes. He soon built himself an office, which was a perfect marvel to  the miners, from its superior elegance. It is the only one on the Bar,  and I intend to visit it in a day or two, when I will give you a  description of its architectural splendors. It will perhaps enlighten  you as to one peculiarity of a newly discovered mining district, when I  inform you that although there were but two or three physicians at Rich  Bar when my husband arrived, in less than three weeks there were  _twenty-nine_ who had chosen this place for the express purpose of  practicing their profession.    Finding his health so almost miraculously improved, F. concluded,  should I approve the plan, to spend the winter in the mountains. I had  teased him to let me accompany him when he left in June, but he had at  that time refused, not daring to subject me to inconveniences, of the  extent of which he was himself ignorant. When the letter disclosing his  plans for the winter reached me at San Francisco, I was perfectly  enchanted. You know that I am a regular nomad in my passion for  wandering. Of course my numerous acquaintances in San Francisco raised  one universal shout of disapprobation. Some said that I ought to be put  into a straitjacket, for I was undoubtedly mad to think of such a  thing. Some said that I should never get there alive, and if I _did_,  would not stay a month; that it was ever my lot to be victimized in,  and commenced my journey in earnest. I was the only passenger. For  thirty miles the road passed through as beautiful a country as I had  ever seen. Dotted here and there with the California oak, it reminded  me of the peaceful apple-orchards and smiling river-meadows of dear old  New England. As a frame to the graceful picture, on one side rose the  Buttes, that group of hills so piquant and saucy, and on the other,  tossing to heaven the everlasting whiteness of their snow-wreathed  foreheads, stood, sublime in their very monotony, the summits of the  glorious Sierra Nevada.    We passed one place where a number of Indian women were gathering  flower-seeds, which, mixed with pounded acorns and grasshoppers, form  the bread of these miserable "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23286"],[0,"The Rover Boys Under Canvas; Or, The Mystery of the Wrecked Submarine (#10)"],[1,"om, he picked up one of the packing  cases, and the others quickly followed suit. Then they marched out  into the hallway, leaving Codfish staring after them in bewilderment.    \"I know you've got some other things belonging to the school besides  that fish!\" cried Andy. \"You've got the pockets of your overcoat just  stuffed with good things!\"    \"Haven't any such thing!\" declared the sneak. And then, struck by a  sudden idea, he ran to the clothing closet and brought forth his  overcoat, which had been in one of the boxes. He rammed his hand into  one of the pockets, and then suddenly withdrew it with a yell of  fright and pain.    And his fright and pain were not without good reason, for clinging to  the thumb of the hand he had inserted into the pocket of the overcoat  was a small, but exceedingly active, snapping turtle!          CHAPTER VIII    AN INTERRUPTED FEAST      \"Oh, oh, oh!\" yelled Codfish, dancing around the room wildly. \"Take  that thing off! Oh, I'll be bitten to death! Take it off, somebody!  What is it, anyhow?\"    \"Hello! Codfish has been fishing,\" cried Andy gaily.    \"Maybe he got that from the cook's pantry, too,\" broke in Randy.    \"What's the dear creature's name, Codfish?\" questioned Fred.    \"You haven't got to let go of him if you don't want to, you know,\"  came from Jack.    All this while the sneak of the school was dancing around the room,  doing his best to shake off the snapping turtle. But the creature,  though small, had a hold that was very tenacious, and refused to  budge.    \"Say, he won't be seriously bitten, will he?\" questioned Spouter, in a  low tone.    \"No, it's only a baby snapping turtle,\" answered Andy slowly.  \"Codfish is far more scared than hurt.\"    The sneak of the school was so frightened that he did not dare to take  hold of the snapping turtle. He held the creature out at arm's length  and continued to dance around, asking the others to take it off.    \"He'll eat my finger!\"    \"Put it in some water and it will let go quick enough,\" suggested Fred  presently.    \"Yes, give him a chance to swim around in a bathtub,\" added Randy  quickly, when he saw Stowell make a move toward the washbowl in one  corner of the room. \"That isn't big enough for a good healthy turtle.\"    \"Oh, oh! I'll have the law on you for this!\" yelled the sneak, and  then bolted for the door and ran down the corridor in the direction of  the nearest bathroom.    As it happened, at that moment Job Plunger, the school janitor, was  coming along the corridor carrying an armful of old magazines which he  had been ordered to store away in the attic. As my old readers know,  Plunger, who had been nicknamed \"Shout,\" was quite deaf, and with eyes  in another direction he did not see Codfish coming. The two collided  violently, and the janitor was sent over backward, scattering the  magazines in all directions, while Codfish came down on top of him.    \"Hi you! what you mean by knockin' me down that way?\" shrilled the  janitor, when he could regain his breath.    \"I--I didn't mean to do it,\" stammered the sneak, as he arose to his  feet. \"I was in a hurry.\"    \"You ain't got no right to race through these halls like a crazy  horse,\" went on Plunger. \"I ought to report you.\"    \"I told you I was in a hurry,\" explained Codfish.    \"Worry?\" queried Plunger, not hearing aright. \"Ain't I got a right to  worry if a feller like you sends me sprawlin'?\"    \"I didn't say worry--I said I was in a hurry. A snapping turtle had me  by the finger, and I wanted to get rid of it.\"    \"Rappin'! Well, you ain't goin' to rap me. I'll let you know that!\"  growled the deaf janitor.    \"I said snapping--not rapping--a snapping turtle!\" Codfish put his  mouth close to the janitor's ear. \"_A snapping turtle!_\"    \"What's that? No, I ain't got no snappin' turtle. What would I be  doin' with a snappin' turtle?\" queried Plunger blankly.    \"I said I had one here--on my thumb!\" cried Codfish. \"It's gone now. I  guess my fall knocked it off,\" and he looked around in the rather dim  corridor to see what had become of the turtle, but without locating  the creature.    \"I'm off, am I?\" snarled Plunger, who had been asked that day to do a  large amount of extra work by the cadets, and was consequently in no  good humor. \"I ain't half as much off as you are, you young rascal!\"  He grabbed Codfish by the arm. \"You jest pick up them magazines and  put 'em in my arms ag'in, or I'll report you.\"    At this the sneak muttered something under his breath. But he was  afraid of the deaf janitor, and so he began to pick up the various  magazines that had been scattered around and piled them high in  Plunger's arms. While he was doing this, he continued to look around  for the snapping turtle, but the little creature had disappeared.    \"Now you be careful after this,\" said Plunger, when the task of  gathering up the scattered magazines had been completed. \"After this  when you want to run through the halls, you walk!\" And then he  continued on his way.    The Rovers and their chums had witnessed the scene in the corridor,  but as soon as Stowell turned to come back to his room they ran off  and down a side stairs, carrying the packing cases with them.    \"Say, but that was rich--the way he thumped into Shout,\" was Andy's  comment.    \"Yes, and the way Shout took him up for what he said,\" returned Randy.  \"Gosh! it seems to me as if poor old Shout is getting deafer every  day.\"    \"I wonder what became of the snapping turtle,\" said Fred.    \"If they fell on it, they must have crushed the poor creature,\"  returned Jack.    The boxes were soon placed on the various bonfires, and then the boys  mingled with the other students in having a good time generally. The  cadets sang songs and danced around the fires, and then organized an  impromptu parade up and down the river front and around the Hall.    \"How about that little feast we were going to have before we went to  bed?\" questioned Randy presently.    \"Just what I was thinking about,\" answered Fred. \"I'd like to have it  first rate; but where are we going to get the eats?\"    \"Perhaps we can get something from the Hall pantry,\" suggested Jack.    \"Nothing doing in that direction,\" came from Ned Lowe, who was  present.    \"What makes you say that?\" questioned Spouter.    \"Bart White and I tried it a little while ago, and everything is  locked up as tight as a drum. I guess the head cook and the head  waiter got on to the fact that we might make a raid.\"    \"Then there is only one other thing to do,\" said Randy quickly. \"And  that is to go down to town for something.\"    \"That would be easy enough, especially if we could get some one on the  road to give us a lift,\" said Jack.    The Rovers and their chums talked the matter over for several minutes,  and then it was decided that Jack, Fred, Spouter, and Gif would pay a  hurried visit to Haven Point, bringing back with them such good things  as they could pick up quickly in the stores and carry back. A cap was  passed around, and eight dollars was collected for the proposed feast.  The cadets who had been selected as a committee lost no time in  leaving the school grounds, and then hurried off down the road leading  to the town.    \"Let's watch our chance for a ride,\" said Jack. \"We don't want to  waste any time on this trip.\"    He had scarcely spoken when they heard the rumble of a truck  approaching. It was a motor truck belonging to a dairy company doing  business in Haven Point and other towns around the lake.    \"Hello there! Give us a ride into town, will you?\" questioned Fred of  the driver, as the truck came to a halt at their signal.    \"Sure! Climb on board,\" said the good-natured driver. He had only a  small load and was glad of their company, feeling sure that they would  treat him well for the accommodation.    By means of the truck it did not take the cadets long to reach the  town, and there they left the driver, Jack tossing him a quarter for  his kindness. Then the lads hurried to such of the stores as were  still open.    They had already made up their minds as to what they wanted if the  things could be obtained. At a delicatessen store they purchased a  pasteboard box lined with waxed paper and filled with chicken salad,  and also some ham and tongue sandwiches. Then they rushed into a  bakeshop, the proprietor of which was just closing, and purchased  several layer cakes and also a generous supply of ginger snaps. Then  they hurried to a confectionery, and there obtained some bottled soda  water and ginger ale, and likewise several quarts of ice-cream.    \"Now I guess we're pretty well fixed for a little spread,\" declared  Jack, when they were once more on the street, each loaded with several  bundles.    \"I hope we can get a ride back to the school,\" said Fred. \"These  bundles are pretty heavy.\"    \"I've got an idea,\" said Andy. \"See that automobile yonder? Well, that  belongs to the man who owns the moving-picture theater. There he is in  front of his place. I wonder if he wouldn't let his chauffeur run us  down to the Hall? He knows all the boys at the Hall are pretty good  customers at his show place.\"    \"It wouldn't do any harm to ask him, Andy,\" answered his cousin.    The crowd crossed the street and was soon interviewing the owner of  the moving-picture theater. He had seen the boys there a number of  times, and remembered them, and was keenly alive to anything that  might aid his business.    \"Sure, my man can run you down to the school,\" he said readily. \"Here  he is now.\" He turned to his colored chauffeur. \"Joe, take these young  gentlemen to Colby Hall and then come back here just as soon as you  can.\"    The run to Colby Hall in the automobile took but a few minutes, and  the driver very condescendingly agreed to take them around to the rear  entrance of the building. The cadets paid him for his trip, and then  lost no time in sneaking what they had bought up a back stairway and  into the rooms occupied"]]]
