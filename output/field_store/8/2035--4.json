My friend and companion Collins, who was a clerk in the post-office,  pleas'd with the account I gave him of my new country, determined to  go thither also; and, while I waited for my father's determination, he  set out before me by land to Rhode Island, leaving his books, which  were a pretty collection of mathematicks and natural philosophy, to  come with mine and me to New York, where he propos'd to wait for me.    My father, tho' he did not approve Sir William's proposition, was yet  pleas'd that I had been able to obtain so advantageous a character  from a person of such note where I had resided, and that I had been so  industrious and careful as to equip myself so handsomely in so short a  time; therefore, seeing no prospect of an accommodation between my  brother and me, he gave his consent to my returning again to  Philadelphia, advis'd me to behave respectfully to the people there,  endeavour to obtain the general esteem, and avoid lampooning and  libeling, to which he thought I had too much inclination; telling me,  that by steady industry and a prudent parsimony I might save enough by  the time I was one-and-twenty to set me up; and that, if I came near  the matter, he would help me out with the rest. This was all I could  obtain, except some small gifts as tokens of his and my mother's love,  when I embark'd again for New York, now with their approbation and  their blessing.    The sloop putting in at Newport, Rhode Island, I visited my brother  John, who had been married and settled there some years. He received  me very affectionately, for he always lov'd me. A friend of his, one  Vernon, having some money due to him in Pennsylvania, about  thirty-five pounds currency, desired I would receive it for him, and  keep it till I had his directions what to remit it in. Accordingly, he  gave me an order. This afterwards occasion'd me a good deal of  uneasiness.    At Newport we took in a number of passengers for New York, among  which were two young women, companions, and a grave, sensible,  matronlike Quaker woman, with her attendants. I had shown an obliging  readiness to do her some little services, which impress'd her I  suppose with a degree of good will toward me; therefore, when she saw  a daily growing familiarity between me and the two young women, which  they appear'd to encourage, she took me aside, and said, \"Young man, I  am concern'd for thee, as thou hast no friend with thee, and seems not  to know much of the world, or of the snares youth is expos'd to;  depend upon it, those are very bad women; I can see it in all their  actions; and if thee art not upon thy guard, they will draw thee into  some danger; they are strangers to thee, and I advise thee, in a  friendly concern for thy welfare, to have no acquaintance with them.\"  As I seem'd at first not to think so ill of them as she did, she  mentioned some things she had observ'd and heard that had escap'd my  notice, but now convinc'd me she was right. I thank'd her for her kind  advice, and promis'd to follow it. When we arriv'd at New York, they  told me where they liv'd, and invited me to come and see them; but I  avoided it, and it was well I did; for the next day the captain miss'd  a silver spoon and some other things, that had been taken out of his  cabin, and, knowing that these were a couple of strumpets, he got a  warrant to search their lodgings, found the stolen goods, and had the  thieves punish'd. So, tho' we had escap'd a sunken rock, which we  scrap'd upon in the passage, I thought this escape of rather more  importance to me.    At New York I found my friend Collins, who had arriv'd there some time  before me. We had been intimate from children, and had read the same  books together; but he had the advantage of more time for reading and  studying, and a wonderful genius for mathematical learning, in which  he far outstript me. While I liv'd in Boston, most of my hours of  leisure for conversation were spent with him, and he continu'd a sober  as well as an industrious lad; was much respected for his learning by  several of the clergy and other gentlemen, and seemed to promise  making a good figure in life. But, during my absence, he had acquir'd  a habit of sotting with brandy; and I found by his own account, and  what I heard from others, that he had been drunk every day since his  arrival at New York, and behav'd very oddly. He had gam'd, too, and  lost his money, so that I was oblig'd to discharge his lodgings, and  defray his expenses to and at Philadelphia, which prov'd extremely  inconvenient to me.    The then governor of New York, Burnet (son of Bishop Burnet), hearing  from the captain that a young man, one of his passengers, had a great  many books, desir'd he would bring me to see him. I waited upon him  accordingly, and should have taken Collins with me but that he was not  sober. The gov'r. treated me with great civility, show'd me his  library, which was a very large one, and we had a good deal of  conversation about books and authors. This was the second governor who  had done me the honour to take notice of me; which, to a poor boy like  me, was very pleasing.    We proceeded to Philadelphia. I received on the way Vernon's money,  without which we could hardly have finish'd our journey. Collins  wished to be employ'd in some counting-house; but, whether they  discover'd his dramming by his breath, or by his behaviour, tho' he  had some recommendations, he met with no success in any application,  and continu'd lodging and boarding at the same house with me, and at  my expense. Knowing I had that money of Vernon's, he was continually  borrowing of me, still promising repayment as soon as he should be in  business. At length he had got so much of it that I was distress'd to  think what I should do in case of being call'd on to remit it.    His drinking continu'd, about which we sometimes quarrel'd; for, when  a little intoxicated, he was very fractious. Once, in a boat on the  Delaware with some other young men, he refused to row in his turn. \"I  will be row'd home,\" says he. \"We will not row you,\" says I. \"You  must, or stay all night on the water,\" says he, \"just as you please.\"  The others said, \"Let us row; what signifies it?\" But, my mind being  soured with his other conduct, I continu'd to refuse. So he swore he  would make me row, or throw me overboard; and coming along, stepping  on the thwarts, toward me, when he came up and struck at me, I clapped  my hand under his crutch, and, rising, pitched him head-foremost into  the river. I knew he was a good swimmer, and so was under little  concern about him; but before he could get round to lay hold of the  boat, we had with a few strokes pull'd her out of his reach; and ever  when he drew near the boat, we ask'd if he would row, striking a few  strokes to slide her away from him. He was ready to die with  vexation, and obstinately would not promise to row. However, seeing  him at last beginning to tire, we lifted him in and brought him home  dripping wet in the evening. We hardly exchang'd a civil word  afterwards, and a West India captain, who had a commission to procure  a tutor for the sons of a gentleman at Barbados, happening to meet  with him, agreed to carry him thither. He left me then, promising to  remit me the first money he should receive in order to discharge the  debt; but I never heard of him after.    The breaking into this money of Vernon's was one of the first great  errata of my life; and this affair show'd that my father was not much  out in his judgment when he suppos'd me too young to manage business  of importance. But Sir William, on reading his letter, said he was too  prudent. There was great difference in persons; and discretion did not  always accompany years, nor was youth always without it. \"And since he  will not set you up,\" says he, \"I will do it myself. Give me an  inventory of the things necessary to be had from England, and I will  send for them. You shall repay me when you are able; I am resolv'd to  have a good printer here, and I am sure you must succeed.\" This was  spoken with such an appearance of cordiality, that I had not the least  doubt of his meaning what he said. I had hitherto kept the proposition  of my setting up, a secret in Philadelphia, and I still kept it. Had  it been known that I depended on the governor, probably some friend,  that knew him better, would have advis'd me not to rely on him, as I  afterwards heard it as his known character to be liberal of promises  which he never meant to keep. Yet, unsolicited as he was by me, how  could I think his generous offers insincere? I believ'd him one of the  best men in the world.    I presented him an inventory of a little print'-house, amounting by my  computation to about one hundred pounds sterling. He lik'd it, but  ask'd me if my being on the spot in England to chuse the types, and  see that everything was good of the kind, might not be of some  advantage. \"Then,\" says he, \"when there, you may make acquaintances,  and establish correspondences in the bookselling and stationery way.\"  I agreed that this might be advantageous. \"Then,\" says he, \"get  yourself ready to go with Annis;\" which was the annual ship, and the  only one at that time usually passing between London and Philadelphia.  But it would be some months before Annis sail'd, so I continued  working with Keimer, fretting about the money Collins had got from me,  and in daily apprehensions of being call'd upon by Vernon, which,  however, did not happen for some years after.    I believe I have omitted mentioning that, in my first voyage from  Boston, being becalm'd off Block Island, our people set about catching  cod, and hauled up a great many. Hitherto I had stuck to my resolution  of not eating animal food, and on this occasion I consider'd, with my  master Tryon, the taking every fish as a kind of unprovoked murder,  since none of them had, or ever could do us"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20220"],[0,"The Mind and Its Education (#10)"],[1,"cquaintance.  The end-organs of the sensory nerves must meet this advance half-way,  and be so constructed as to be affected by the different forms of energy  which are constantly beating upon them.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--The prism's analysis of a bundle of light rays.  On the right are shown the relation of vibration rates to temperature  stimuli, to light and to chemical stimuli. The rates are given in  billions per second.--After WITMER.]    THE END-ORGANS AND THEIR RESPONSE TO STIMULI.--Thus the radiations of  ether from the sun, our chief source of light, are so rapid that  billions of them enter the eye in a second of time, and the retina is of  such a nature that its nerve cells are thrown into activity by these  waves; the impulse is carried over the optic nerve to the occipital lobe  of the cortex, and the sensation of sight is the result. The different  colors also, from the red of the spectrum to the violet, are the result  of different vibration rates in the waves of ether which strike the  retina; and in order to perceive color, the retina must be able to  respond to the particular vibration rate which represents each color.  Likewise in the sense of touch the end-organs are fitted to respond to  very rapid vibrations, and it is possible that the different qualities  of touch are produced by different vibration rates in the atoms of the  object we are touching. When we reach the ear, we have the organ which  responds to the lowest vibration rate of all, for we can detect a sound  made by an object which is vibrating from twenty to thirty times a  second. The highest vibration rate which will affect the ear is some  forty thousand per second.    Thus it is seen that there are great gaps in the different rates to  which our senses are fitted to respond--a sudden drop from billions in  the case of the eye to millions in touch, and to thousands or even tens  in hearing. This makes one wonder whether there are not many things in  nature which man has never discovered simply because he has not the  sense mechanism enabling him to become conscious of their existence.  There are undoubtedly \"more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt  of in our philosophy.\"    DEPENDENCE OF THE MIND ON THE SENSES.--Only as the senses bring in the  material, has the mind anything with which to build. Thus have the  senses to act as messengers between the great outside world and the  brain; to be the servants who shall stand at the doorways of the  body--the eyes, the ears, the finger tips--each ready to receive its  particular kind of impulse from nature and send it along the right path  to the part of the cortex where it belongs, so that the mind can say, \"A  sight,\" \"A sound,\" or \"A touch.\" Thus does the mind come to know the  universe of the senses. Thus does it get the material out of which  memory, imagination, and thought begin. Thus and only thus does the mind  secure the crude material from which the finished superstructure is  finally built.          CHAPTER IV    MENTAL DEVELOPMENT AND MOTOR TRAINING      Education was long looked upon as affecting the mind only; the body was  either left out of account or neglected. Later science has shown,  however, that the mind cannot be trained _except as the nervous system  is trained and developed_. For not sensation and the simpler mental  processes alone, but memory, imagination, judgment, reasoning and every  other act of the mind are dependent on the nervous system finally for  their efficiency. The little child gets its first mental experiences in  connection with certain movements or acts set up reflexly by the  pre-organized nervous system. From this time on movement and idea are so  inextricably bound together that they cannot be separated. The mind and  the brain are so vitally related that it is impossible to educate one  without performing a like office for the other; and it is likewise  impossible to neglect the one without causing the other to suffer in its  development.      1. FACTORS DETERMINING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM    DEVELOPMENT AND NUTRITION.--Ignoring the native differences in nervous  systems through the influence of heredity, the efficiency of a nervous  system is largely dependent on two factors: (1) The development of the  cells and fibers of which it is composed, and (2) its general tone of  health and vigor. The actual number of cells in the nervous system  increases but little if at all after birth. Indeed, it is doubtful  whether Edison's brain and nervous system has a greater number of cells  in it than yours or mine. The difference between the brain of a genius  and that of an ordinary man is not in the _number_ of cells which it  contains, but rather in the development of the cells and fibers which  are present, potentially, at least, in every nervous system. The  histologist tells us that in the nervous system of every child there are  tens of thousands of cells which are so immature and undeveloped that  they are useless; indeed, this is the case to some degree in every adult  person's nervous system as well. Thus each individual has inherent in  his nervous system potentialities of which he has never taken advantage,  the utilizing of which may make him a genius and the neglecting of which  will certainly leave him on the plane of mediocrity. The first problem  in education, then, is to take the unripe and inefficient nervous system  and so develop it in connection with the growing mind that the  possibilities which nature has stored in it shall become actualities.    UNDEVELOPED CELLS.--Professor Donaldson tells us on this point that: \"At  birth, and for a long time after, many [nervous] systems contain cell  elements which are more or less immature, not forming a functional part  of the tissue, and yet under some conditions capable of further  development.... For the cells which are continually appearing in the  developing cortex no other source is known than the nuclei or granules  found there in its earliest stages. These elements are metamorphosed  neuroblasts--that is, elementary cells out of which the nervous matter  is developed--which have shrunken to a volume less than that which they  had at first, and which remain small until, in the subsequent process of  enlargement necessary for their full development, they expand into  well-marked cells. Elements intermediate between these granules and the  fully developed cells are always found, even in mature brains, and  therefore it is inferred that the latter are derived from the former.  The appearances there also lead to the conclusion that many elements  which might possibly develop in any given case are far beyond the number  that actually does so.... The possible number of cells latent and  functional in the central system is early fixed. At any age this number  is accordingly represented by the granules as well as by the cells which  have already undergone further development. During growth the proportion  of developed cells increases, and sometimes, owing to the failure to  recognize potential nerve cells in the granules, the impression is  carried away that this increase implies the formation of new elements.  As has been shown, such is not the case.\"[1]    DEVELOPMENT OF NERVE FIBERS.--The nerve _fibers_, no less than the  cells, must go through a process of development. It has already been  shown that the fibers are the result of a branching of cells. At birth  many of the cells have not yet thrown out branches, and hence the fibers  are lacking; while many of those which are already grown out are not  sufficiently developed to transmit impulses accurately. Thus it has been  found that most children at birth are able to support the weight of the  body for several seconds by clasping the fingers around a small rod, but  it takes about a year for the child to become able to stand. It is  evident that it requires more actual strength to cling to a rod than to  stand; hence the conclusion is that the difference is in the earlier  development of the nerve centers which have to do with clasping than of  those concerned in standing. Likewise the child's first attempts to feed  himself or do any one of the thousand little things about which he is so  awkward, are partial failures not so much because he has not had  practice as because his nervous machinery connected with those movements  is not yet developed sufficiently to enable him to be accurate. His  brain is in a condition which Flechsig calls \"unripe.\" How, then, shall  the undeveloped cells and system ripen? How shall the undeveloped cells  and fibers grow to full maturity and efficiency?      2. DEVELOPMENT OF NERVOUS SYSTEM THROUGH USE    IMPORTANCE OF STIMULUS AND RESPONSE.--Like all other tissues of the  body, the nerve cells and fibers are developed by judicious use. The  sensory and association centers require the constant stimulus of nerve  currents running in from the various end-organs, and the motor centers  require the constant stimulus of currents running from them out to the  muscles. In other words, the conditions upon which both motor and  sensory development depend are: (1) A rich environment of sights and  sounds and tastes and smells, and everything else which serves as proper  stimulus to the sense organs, and to every form of intellectual and  social interest; and (2) no less important, an opportunity for the  freest and most complete forms of response and motor activity.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Schematic transverse section of the human brain  showing the projection of the motor fibers, their crossing in the  neighborhood of the medulla, and their termination in the different  areas of localized function in the cortex. S, fissure of Sylvius; M, the  medulla; VII, the roots of the facial nerves.]    An illustration of the effects of the lack of sensory stimuli on the  cortex is well shown in the case of Laura Bridgman, whose brain was  studied by Professor Donaldson after her "]]]
