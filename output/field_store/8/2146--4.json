Beautifully as the size of the  jaws could be explained as due to the increased use made of them by  the \"soldiers,\" or the enlarged brain as due to the mental activities  of the workers, the fact of the infertility of these forms is an  insurmountable obstacle to accepting such an explanation. Neither jaws  nor brain can have been evolved on the Lamarckian principle.    The problem of coadaptation is no easier in the case of the ant than  in the case of the Giant Stag. Darwin himself gave a pretty  illustration to show how imposing the difference between the two kinds  of workers in one species would seem if we translated it into human  terms. In regard to the Driver ants (Anomma) we must picture to  ourselves a piece of work, \"for instance the building of a house,  being carried on by two kinds of workers, of which one group was five  feet four inches high, the other sixteen feet high.\"[39]    Although the ant is a small animal as compared with man or with the  Irish Elk, the \"soldier\" with its relatively enormous jaws is hardly  less heavily burdened than the Elk with its antlers, and in the ant's  case, too, a strengthening of the skeleton, of the muscles, the nerves  of the head, and of the legs must have taken place parallel with the  enlargement of the jaws. _Harmonious adaptation_ (coadaptation) has  here been active in a high degree, and yet these \"soldiers\" are  sterile! There thus remains nothing for it but to refer all their  adaptations, positive and negative alike, to processes of selection  which have taken place in the rudiments of the workers within the egg  and sperm-cells of their parents. There is no way out of the  difficulty except the one Darwin pointed out. He himself did not find  the solution of the riddle at once. At first he believed that the case  of the workers among social insects presented \"the most serious  special difficulty\" in the way of his theory of natural selection; and  it was only after it had become clear to him that it was not the  sterile insects themselves but their parents that were selected,  according as they produced more or less well adapted workers, that he  was able to refer to this very case of the conditions among ants \"_in  order to show the power of natural selection_.\"[40] He explains his  view by a simple but interesting illustration. Gardeners have  produced, by means of long continued artificial selection, a variety  of Stock, which bears entirely double, and therefore infertile  flowers.[41] Nevertheless the variety continues to be reproduced from  seed, because, in addition to the double and infertile flowers, the  seeds always produce a certain number of single, fertile blossoms, and  these are used to reproduce the double variety. These single and  fertile plants correspond \"to the males and females of an ant-colony,  the infertile plants, which are regularly produced in large numbers,  to the neuter workers of the colony.\"    This illustration is entirely apt, the only difference between the  two cases consisting in the fact that the variation in the flower is  not a useful, but a disadvantageous one, which can only be preserved  by artificial selection on the part of the gardener, while the  transformations that have taken place parallel with the sterility of  the ants are useful, since they procure for the colony an advantage in  the struggle for existence, and they are therefore preserved by  natural selection. Even the sterility itself in this case is not  disadvantageous, since the fertility of the true females has at the  same time considerably increased. We may therefore regard the sterile  forms of ants, which have gradually been adapted in several directions  to varying functions, _as a certain proof_ that selection really takes  place in the germ-cells of the fathers and mothers of the workers, and  that _special complexes of primordia_ (_ids_) are present in the  workers and in the males and females, and these complexes contain the  primordia of the individual parts (_determinants_). But since all  living entities vary, the determinants must also vary, now in a  favourable, now in an unfavourable direction. If a female produces  eggs, which contain favourably varying determinants in the worker-ids,  then these eggs will give rise to workers modified in the favourable  direction, and if this happens with many females, the colony concerned  will contain a better kind of worker than other colonies.    I digress here in order to give an account of the intimate processes,  which, according to my view, take place within the germ-plasm, and  which I have called \"_germinal selection_.\" These processes are of  importance since they form the roots of variation, which in its turn  is the root of natural selection. I cannot here do more than give a  brief outline of the theory in order to show how the Darwin-Wallace  theory of selection has gained support from it.    With others, I regard the minimal amount of substance which is  contained within the nucleus of the germ-cells, in the form of rods,  bands, or granules, as the _germ-substance_ or _germ-plasm_, and I  call the individual granules _ids_. There is always a multiplicity of  such ids present in the nucleus, either occurring individually, or  united in the form of rods or bands (chromosomes). Each id contains  the primary constituents of a _whole_ individual, so that several ids  are concerned in the development of a new individual.    In every being of complex structure thousands of primary constituents  must go to make up a single id; these I call _determinants_, and I  mean by this name very small individual particles, far below the  limits of microscopic visibility, vital units which feed, grow, and  multiply by division. These determinants control the parts of the  developing embryo,--in what manner need not here concern us. The  determinants differ among themselves, those of a muscle are  differently constituted from those of a nerve-cell or a glandular  cell, etc., and every determinant is in its turn made up of minute  vital units, which I call _biophores_, or the bearers of life.  According to my view, these determinants not only assimilate, like  every other living unit, but they _vary_ in the course of their  growth, as every living unit does; they may vary qualitatively if the  elements of which they are composed vary, they may grow and divide  more or less rapidly, and their variations give rise to  _corresponding_ variations of the organ, cell, or cell-group which  they determine. That they are undergoing ceaseless fluctuations in  regard to size and quality seems to me the inevitable consequence of  their unequal nutrition; for although the germ-cell as a whole usually  receives sufficient nutriment, minute fluctuations in the amount  carried to different parts within the germ-plasm cannot fail to occur.    Now, if a determinant, for instance of a sensory cell, receives for a  considerable time more abundant nutriment than before, it will grow  more rapidly--become bigger, and divide more quickly, and, later, when  the id concerned develops into an embryo, this sensory cell will  become stronger than in the parents, possibly even twice as strong.  This is an instance of a _hereditary individual variation_, arising  from the germ.    The nutritive stream which, according to our hypothesis, favours the  determinant _N_ by chance, that is, for reasons unknown to us, may  remain strong for a considerable time, or may decrease again; but even  in the latter case it is conceivable that the ascending movement of  the determinant may continue, because the strengthened determinant now  _actively_ nourishes itself more abundantly,--that is to say, it  attracts the nutriment to itself, and to a certain extent withdraws it  from its fellow-determinants. In this way, it may--as it seems to  me--get into _permanent upward movement, and attain a degree of  strength from which there is no falling back_. Then positive or  negative selection sets in, favouring the variations which are  advantageous, setting aside those which are disadvantageous.    In a similar manner a _downward_ variation of the determinants may  take place, if its progress be started by a diminished flow of  nutriment. The determinants which are weakened by this diminished flow  will have less affinity for attracting nutriment because of their  diminished strength, and they will assimilate more feebly and grow  more slowly, unless chance streams of nutriment help them to recover  themselves. But, as will presently be shown, a change of direction  cannot take place at _every_ stage of the degenerative process. If a  certain critical stage of downward progress be passed, even favourable  conditions of food-supply will no longer suffice permanently to change  the direction of the variation. Only two cases are conceivable; if the  determinant corresponds to a _useful_ organ, only its removal can  bring back the germ-plasm to its former level; therefore personal  selection removes the id in question, with its determinants, from the  germ-plasm, by causing the elimination of the individual in the  struggle for existence. But there is another conceivable case; the  determinants concerned may be those of an organ which has become  _useless_, and they will then continue unobstructed, but with  exceeding slowness, along the downward path, until the organ becomes  vestigial, and finally disappears altogether.    The fluctuations of the determinants hither and thither may thus be  transformed into a lasting ascending or descending movement; and _this  is the crucial point of these germinal processes_.    This is not a fantastic assumption; we can read it in the fact of the  degeneration of disused parts. _Useless organs are the only ones which  are not helped to ascend"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22460"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 5, August, 1915 (#10)"],[1,"Invasion of France, commonly, but incorrectly known as the battle of  Mons.    The main blow at France was to come through Belgium. Five German  armies out of eight were hurled against this gateway to Northern  France. In Lorraine and Alsace the Germans were temporarily to remain  on the defensive. The protection of Lorraine was intrusted to the  Bavarian (Sixth) Army, that of Alsace to the remaining two armies.    The French plan of operation was to check the invasion of Belgium on  the line Tongres-Liege-Longwy, where the Belgian Army, from a strictly  military point of view, forming the advance guards of the French Army  of the North, was holding strong positions, and with superior forces  to strike at the German Army of Lorraine. The aim was, avoiding Metz,  to reach the Moselle near Trier through the valley of the Saar, and to  roll up the German Army of the North from its left wing. An invasion  of Alsace was merely to satisfy political aspirations.    The German advance in Belgium, however, remained unchecked, and in  Lorraine the battles of Dieuze and Saarbourg on Aug. 20 decided the  issue in favor of the Bavarians. In Alsace the French were victorious  over the Eighth Army and took Muelhausen, while further north, between  Muenster and Shirmeck, the Seventh Army checked the French invasion.    Meanwhile the German avalanche in Belgium had reached the second line  of defense, Brussels-Namur-Longwy, before the French Army of the  North. The capture of Namur prompted the French staff to recall  advance guards, which had reached the fortress just as it surrendered,  and to accept battle in the line Mons-Charleroi-Givet-Longwy. The  battle for the invasion of France and the retirement of the French  armies in all the theatres of action which it caused opens the second  period of the campaign against France.    The English contingent from Havre had joined the French Army just  before the German onslaught began. The battle was lost by the Allies  tactically and strategically through the defeat of their right wing at  Longwy and Neufchateau, and through the encircling of their left wing  at Mons. The direct result of the outcome was the German invasion of  France; the indirect consequence (resulting from the necessity of  drawing troops from the other fields of action to stem the German  invasion) was the retirement of the French armies in Lorraine and  Alsace to the line Verdun-Nancy-St. Die, and further south to the  passes of the Vosges, which they have been holding ever since.    Sweeping on through Northern France, the German Army of the North was  breaking up all resistance in its path, such as was attempted by the  British at St. Quentin on Aug. 28, and was tearing with it all  fortresses, such as Longwy, La Fere, Maubeuge, and others; but it was  failing in its principal aim: to embrace the skillfully retreating  enemy before he could reach the line Paris-Verdun, which he had  selected and prepared for the next stand.    On Aug. 30 the German plan of strategy was changed, and it was  resolved to break the centre of the enemy, throwing his left wing into  Paris and on the Seine and his right wing into Verdun, Toul, and  Epinal. The armies of the centre were pushed forward, while either  wing held back. The Allies were established in the general line  Paris-Verdun.    The battle ensuing on Sept. 5 and the retreat of the Germans to the  Aisne are the events of the third period of this campaign, lasting  from Sept. 5 to Sept. 28. On Sept. 8, while the German attacks had all  but pierced the French centre, having already bent it back beyond the  line Sezanne-Vitry, the German right wing found itself outflanked by a  new allied army from Paris, which was rapidly moving northward and  threatened to roll up the entire German battle front from the  direction of Compiegne. The critical question, who would succeed  first, the Allies in outflanking the German right or the Germans in  piercing the French centre, was decided in favor of the Allies.  Anglo-French strategy triumphed.    The tactical aspect of the situation, though, is best illustrated by  the message sent to his commander-in-chief by General Foch, commanding  the French Army of the Centre when he received the order to  counter-attack: \"My left has been forced back, my right is routed. I  shall attack with the centre.\" When the counter-attack came it found  but rear guards opposing it. The retreat of the Germans, their right  flank constantly in danger of being rolled up, was a fine military  achievement. On Sept. 12 it halted on the Aisne. In the regions  northeast of Verdun the German left wing joined hands with the Sixth  German Army, which had followed up the retirement of the French Army  of Lorraine to the line Verdun-St. Die.    Thus resting on Metz with its left wing the German battle-front was  strongly established on a line passing Verdun, to the east and  northeast, extending from there in a general westerly direction to the  valley of the Aisne as far as the region north of Compiegne, and from  that point northward to the region west of Peronne and Cambrai.    The stability of this line, enabling a constant shifting of forces  toward the right wing, and the arrival there of the army released from  Maubeuge, made possible the extension of the battle-front to the  region of Arras, and frustrated all flanking movements on the part of  the Allies.    The situation was again safe, but the plan to put the French army hors  de combat was far from having been realized. The German General Staff  therefore decided on a new plan. Its purpose was to gain control of  the northeast coast of France. A wedge should be driven between the  two allied countries, and Pas-de-Calais made the base of further  operations against both. The following out of this plan constitutes  the fourth and last period of the first phase of the western  campaign. It starts with the beginning of the siege of Antwerp on  Sept. 28 and ends with the first battle of Ypres on Oct. 27.    The first step toward the accomplishment of the new aims was the  capture of Antwerp. Antwerp in the hands of the Allies meant a  constant menace to the German line of communication; in possession of  the Germans it signified the key to Northern France. The fortress was  taken on Oct. 9. The next point of strategic importance for the  pursuance of the German plan was Lille, which was taken on Oct. 12.    But the change in the German plan of strategy had been recognized by  the Allies, and a new English army from Havre was hurried to the line  Bethune-Dunkirk to extend the allied left wing to the coast and block  the road to Calais. It reached West Flanders on Oct. 13, and on Oct.  16 it came in contact with the German Army that approached from  Antwerp. The latter joined the German right wing north of Lille and  extended it to Westende. On the 18th, after having brought up all  their reserves, the Germans began their onslaught to break through in  the region of Dixmude and Ypres.    While, by Oct. 27, no appreciable impression had been made on the  allied battleline, the situation in the eastern seat of war had begun  to assume an alarming aspect, and necessitated the complete change in  the German plan of strategy, which marks the beginning of the second  phase of the war.    On the western front this second phase meant for the Germans the going  into the defensive along the entire battleline, which the allied  armies have been relentlessly attempting to break. In spite of their  continuous heroic efforts only minor successes, such as that of the  British at Neuve Chapelle and that of the French to the north of  Arras, have been achieved. Counter attacks, forming the most essential  element of the modern defensive, have been launched by the Germans  incessantly, and have on several occasions resulted in successes  similar to those of the Allies, as, for instance, at Soissons and at  Ypres. On the whole, no changes of strategic importance have taken  place, and the German wall in France stands firm to this day.    II.    THE EASTERN CAMPAIGN    While, in the early days of August, the bulk of the German Army was  moving westward, not more than ten army corps were available for the  campaign against Russia. To them and to the Austrian armies fell the  task of laying the basis for the offensive contemplated for a later  date. The plan of campaign was to draw the Russians into the Polish  bag and tie it up. It was based on the knowledge that Russia's  principal strategic aim must, under all circumstances, be Cracow, the  gateway to Vienna and Berlin.    The enemy was to be allowed to reach it through Poland, while the  Germans should hold on to East Prussia and the Austrians to Galicia,  to flank the Russian advance from the north and south in preparation  for a campaign against the Russian lines of communication. This scheme  of bagging the enemy has governed all strategic moves of the campaign  against Russia to this day.    But the Muscovites were on their guard. They paid little attention to  the few German divisions that were thrown into Poland in August, in  order to attract a Russian offensive, and began hammering at the  Teutonic flanking positions along the East Prussian frontier in the  north and the line Lublin-Tarnopol in the south.    While the Russian offensive in East Prussia came to grief at  Tannenberg, it was most successful against Galicia, and the eighth  week of the war already found the Russian invasion west of the San,  Przemysl besieged, and the Austrian right wing flanked by vast bodies  of cavalry, which had penetrated the Carpathian passes and reached the  region of Munkacs.    To relieve the pressure exerted on their Allies and give them a chance  once more to establish themselves in north-eastern Galicia, four  German army corps invaded Poland and advanced toward Radom and  Ivangorod. This counter move was successful. Menaced in their right  flank, the Russians quickly"]]]
