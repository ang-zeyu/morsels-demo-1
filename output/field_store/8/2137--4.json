My father's nephew, of whom I have made mention before, was returned  from Cochin China, to take over some priests from Europe. I was  exceedingly glad to see him, and remembered what good he had done me.  The lady mentioned was no less rejoiced than I. They understood each  other immediately and conversed in a spiritual language. The virtue of  this excellent relation charmed me. I admired his continual prayer  without being able to comprehend it. I endeavored to meditate, and to  think on God without intermission, to utter prayers and ejaculations. I  could not acquire, by all my toil, what God at length gave me Himself,  and which is experienced only in simplicity. My cousin did all he could  to attach me more strongly to God. He conceived great affection for me.  The purity he observed in me from the corruptions of the age, the  abhorrence of sin at a time of life when others are beginning to relish  the pleasures of it, (I was not yet eighteen), gave him a great  tenderness for me. I complained to him of my faults ingenuously. These  I saw clearly. He cheered and exhorted me to support myself, and to  persevere in my good endeavors. He would fain have introduced me into a  more simple manner of prayer, but I was not yet ready for it. I believe  his prayers were more effectual than his words.    No sooner was he gone out of my father's house, than thou, O Divine  Love, manifested thy favor. The desire I had to please Thee, the tears  I shed, the manifold pains I underwent, the labors I sustained, and the  little fruit I reaped from them, moved Thee with compassion. This was  the state of my soul when Thy goodness, surpassing all my vileness and  infidelities, and abounding in proportion to my wretchedness, granted  me in a moment, what all my own efforts could never procure. Beholding  me rowing with laborious toil, the breath of Thy divine operations  turned in my favor, and carried me full sail over this sea of  affliction.    I had often spoken to my confessor about the great anxiety it gave me  to find I could not meditate, nor exert my imagination in order to  pray. Subjects of prayer which were too extensive were useless to me.  Those which were short and pithy suited me better.    At length, God permitted a very religious person, of the order of St.  Francis, to pass by my father's dwelling. He had intended going another  way that was shorter, but a secret power changed his design. He saw  there was something for him to do, and imagined that God had called him  for the conversion of a man of some distinction in that country. His  labors there proved fruitless. It was the conquest of my soul which was  designed. As soon as he arrived he came to see my father who rejoiced  at his coming. At this time I was about to be delivered of my second  son, and my father was dangerously ill, expected to die. For some time  they concealed his sickness from me. An indiscreet person abruptly told  me. Instantly I arose, weak as I was, and went to see him. A dangerous  illness came upon me. My father was recovered, but not entirely, enough  to give me new marks of his affection. I told him of the strong desire  I had to love God, and my great sorrow at not being able to do it  fully. He thought he could not give me a more solid indication of his  love than in procuring me an acquaintance with this worthy man. He told  me what he knew of him, and urged me to go and see him.    At first I made a difficulty of doing it, being intent on observing the  rules of the strictest prudence. However, my father's repeated requests  had with me the weight of a positive command. I thought I could not do  that amiss, which I only did in obedience to him. I took a kinswoman  with me. At first he seemed a little confused; for he was reserved  toward women. Being newly come out of a five years' solitude, he was  surprised that I was the first to address him. He spoke not a word for  some time. I knew not to what attribute his silence. I did not hesitate  to speak to him, and to tell him a few words, my difficulties about  prayer. Presently he replied, \"It is, madame, because you seek without  what you have within. Accustom yourself to seek God in your heart, and  you will there find Him.\"    Having said these words, he left me. They were to me like the stroke of  a dart, which penetrated through my heart. I felt a very deep wound, a  wound so delightful that I desired not to be cured. These words brought  into my heart what I had been seeking so many years. Rather they  discovered to me what was there, and which I had not enjoyed for want  of knowing it.    O my Lord, Thou wast in my heart, and demanded only a simple turning of  my mind inward, to make me perceive Thy presence. Oh, Infinite  Goodness! how was I running hither and thither to seek Thee, my life  was a burden to me, although my happiness was within myself. I was poor  in riches, and ready to perish with hunger, near a table plentifully  spread, and a continual feast. O Beauty, ancient and new; why have I  known Thee so late? Alas! I sought Thee where Thou wert not, and did  not seek Thee where thou wert. It was for want of understanding these  words of Thy Gospel, \"The kingdom of God cometh not with observation...  The kingdom of God is within you.\" This I now experienced. Thou  becamest my King, and my heart Thy kingdom, wherein Thou didst reign  supreme, and performed all Thy sacred will.    I told this man, that I did not know what he had done to me, that my  heart was quite changed, that God was there. He had given me an  experience of His presence in my soul; not by thought or any  application of mind, but as a thing really possessed after the sweetest  manner. I experienced these words in the Canticles (Song of Solomon):  \"Thy name is as precious ointment poured forth; therefore do the  virgins love thee.\" I felt in my soul an unction which, as a salutary  balsam, healed in a moment all my wounds.    I slept not that whole night, because Thy love, O my God, flowed in me  like a delicious oil, and burned as a fire which was going to devour  all that was left of self. I was suddenly so altered that I was hardly  to be known either by myself or others. I found no longer those  troublesome faults or reluctances. They disappeared, being consumed  like chaff in a great fire.    I now became desirous that the instrument hereof might become my  director, preferable to any other. This good father could not readily  resolve to charge himself with my conduct although he saw so surprising  a change effected by the hand of God. Several reasons induced him to  excuse himself. First, my person, then my youth, for I was only  nineteen years. Lastly, a promise he had made to God, from a distrust  of himself, never to take upon himself the direction of any of our sex,  unless God, by some particular providence, should charge him therewith.  However, upon my earnest and repeated request to him to become my  director, he said he would pray to God and desired that I should do so.  As he was at prayer, it was said to him, \"Fear not that charge; she is  my spouse.\" When I heard this, it affected me greatly. \"What (said I to  myself) a frightful monster of iniquity, who has done so much to offend  my God, in abusing His favors, and requiting them with ingratitude, now  to be declared his spouse!\" After this he consented to my request.    Nothing was more easy to me than prayer. Hours passed away like  moments, while I could hardly do anything else but pray. The fervency  of my love allowed me no intermission. It was a prayer of rejoicing and  possessing, devoid of all busy imaginations and forced reflections; it  was a prayer of the will, and not of the head. The taste of God was so  great, so pure, unblended and uninterrupted, that it drew and absorbed  the power of my soul into a profound recollection without act or  discourse. I had now no sight but of Jesus Christ alone. All else was  excluded, in order to love with the greater extent, without any selfish  motives or reasons for loving.    The will, absorbed the two others, the memory and understanding into  itself, and concentrated them in LOVE;--not but that they still  subsisted, but their operations were in a manner imperceptible and  passive. They were no longer stopped or retarded by the multiplicity,  but collected and united in one. So the rising of the sun does not  extinguish the stars, but overpowers and absorbs them in the luster of  his incomparable glory.          CHAPTER 9      Such was the prayer that was given me at once, far above ecstacies,  transports or visions. All these gifts are less pure, and more subject  to illusion or deceits from the enemy.    Visions are in the inferior powers of the soul, and cannot produce true  union. The soul must not dwell or rely upon them, or be retarded by  them; they are but favors and gifts. The Giver alone must be our  object, and aim.    It is of such that Paul speaks, \"Satan transforms himself into an angel  of light,\" II Cor. 11:18; which is generally the case with such as are  fond of visions, and lay a stress on them; because they are apt to  convey a vanity to the soul, or at least hinder it from humbly  attending to God only.    Ecstacies arise from a sensible relish. They may be termed a kind of  spiritual sensuality, wherein the soul letting itself go too far, by  reason of the sweetness it finds in them, falls imperceptibly into  decay. The crafty enemy presents such sort of interior elevations and  raptures for baits to entrap the soul, to fill it with vanity and  self-love, to fix its esteem and attention on the gifts of God, and to  hinder it from following Jesus Christ in the way of renunciation and of  death to all things.    And as to distinct interior words, they too are subject to illusion;  the enemy can form and counterfeit them. Or if they come from a good  angel (for God Himself never speaks thus) we may mistake and  misapprehend them.

She  took the receiver from the maid.    \"Dr. Morris? Yes, I shall be home this evening, and glad to see you, of  course. Bring your violin and come by eight-thirty. Yes--yes. I meant to  have called you and apologized for my somewhat cavalier desertion of you  last night. I am sorry I was rude, I didn't mean to be, but come and let  me ask you to forgive me.\" Her tone was adorable and melted the sullen  mood of the man at the other end of the wire.    Having sworn that he would not see her again, having 'phoned to make an  appointment at which he meant to utter as bitter reproaches as he dared,  he appeared promptly at the hour set, ready to implore her grace and  accept with gratitude any smallest favor, any ray of hope she might see  fit to bestow upon him.    Like many another professional man in New York, in order to cater to the  class in society in which he hoped to establish his reputation and  clientele, Morris had found it necessary to live in a style which far  exceeded his income, although that was a good one for a man still young  in his profession. He was not popular with men, who regarded him as  rather theatrical and a _poseur_, but his music, a certain deference of  manner, a more romantic quality than is to be generally found among  American business men, gave him a great vogue with women, and he  cultivated them, especially the older ones, and they made life very  pleasant for him, introduced him to the right people, and gave him much  good advice now and then.    One of the smartest of these social leaders said practically one day:  \"My dear boy, why do you let all these rich girls marry those silly  foreigners, without an idea to bless themselves with--dukes, debts and  diseases seem synonymous; you are not only clever, but you have the one  gift, saving the title, that commends these creatures to our girls.\"    He smiled his inscrutable smile and bowed. \"And that is?\"    \"You seem to have found the lost art of making pretty speeches, and  paying a woman the small attentions that we all like so well. If I were  a man,\" went on this dreadful dame, \"I should never forget to kiss my  wife and send her flowers and remember all the family anniversaries. It  is by attention to such small details as this that a man may purchase  immunity in larger and more important matters. I know this is most  immoral, but it makes the wife happy, the husband comfortable, and would  go far to decimate the divorce rate, so what more could you ask?\"    \"Perhaps I owe this to the fact that my father was a Hungarian  nobleman--oh, just a trumpery little title, with nothing to pay for the  necessary gold lace, so when he came to America he decided, like so many  of the revolutionists of that period, to be ultra-American, and dropped  even the foreign spelling of the name, changing the 'itz' to plain  'r-i-s,'\" he answered. \"I'm sure my music belongs to the other side of  the Atlantic.\"    \"That accounts for it all,\" she said. \"There is absolutely no reason why  you shouldn't marry almost any woman you want to. Why not find one who  can give you millions in money and the social position you need without  taking a generation to create one? I hope you haven't any foolish  entanglements,\" she added.    He flushed, but did not answer, and when a few weeks later he and Silvia  Holland had played together for some charitable entertainment, his  venerable mentor had sought him out, ready to bestow her blessing at the  earliest possible moment, approving his practical judgment and his good  taste. That was a long time ago.    He had resented the implication at the time; to do him justice, had  Silvia been penniless she would still have attracted him as no other  woman ever had. It was partly her personal charm, partly her music. It  may be true that the world of art is still the world, but it is a very  different world from that in which most of us live and move and have our  being, and Morris was conscious when her fingers touched the keys, and  he took up his bow and drew it across the strings of his violin, that  they entered upon a new and boundless universe in which sound superseded  all other mediums of communication, and seemed to take the place of  mere mundane sensation. Whether his passion for Silvia grew out of their  music, or the wonder of the music was a result of the perfect accord of  their natures, he could not tell. They had become one in his mind.    He fervently hated her various public activities. Here again the  ancestral traits dominated. He thought of her as a great lady, and being  that, she should have been content without anything more. Rushing madly  about doing things for other people implied a certain loss of caste. But  until the previous evening his discontent had been free from the bitter  draught of jealousy. There had been safety in the number of Miss  Holland's admirers, and when he was surest that she did not in any way  return his feeling for her, there had been balm in the thought that she  was too busy elevating the condition of her own sex to have much time to  waste upon any member of his. Instinctively he knew, when he intercepted  the first look between the lady of his dreams and his erstwhile college  associate, that the hour had come that he had dreaded. Silvia Holland  had at last met a man whom, consciously or unconsciously, she  acknowledged king. His rival was there, upon the threshold of her life,  and he was a rival to be feared. That he might also be a rival in his  profession, that he was so rich that he was far above the straits in  which Morris found himself more and more frequently involved, only added  to the flame that consumed him; life without Silvia herself would be  dull, colorless, objectless; life without her music would be but \"wind  along the waste.\"    He had no patience with the theories of the newer medical practitioners  who refuse to be frightened by the cry of \"professional ethics\" or by  the demand that practice shall be \"regular\" whether the patient survives  or not; and yet while he denounced all forms of mental therapeutics, he  was conscious of a strain of superstition which he could in no wise  overcome. Weird folk-lore and uncanny rites kept up by some of the  primitive people of Hungary had had a strange fascination for him when  he was abroad. In himself, he found a singular mixture of the primeval  savage, and the ultra refined that approaches decadence. Of one thing  alone he was certain. To lose Silvia was to lose his soul; without her  there was neither here nor hereafter. Ruthlessly as he had brushed aside  the one woman in his life who came between them, he was prepared to  thrust out of his way any man who sought to become a part of her life.    It was in this mood that he entered her presence, and in this mood he  accepted her _amende honorable_, which she made with charming humility,  but when she would have led him to the music-room, for once he  hesitated.    \"In a few minutes,\" he said, \"but just now there is something I must say  to you. It is true that I was deeply hurt last night, but your regret,  so graciously expressed, emboldens me to think that you would not  willingly hurt me.\" He stopped, and she looked at him with a rather  puzzled air. \"We have been friends for a great while,\" he said  irrelevantly.    \"Yes,\" she said cordially, and somewhat relieved. \"Haven't we? And what  a friendship it has been! A triangular affair, like a loving cup--you  and I and some one of the great masters of melody. Shall it be Chopin  to-night, or shall we begin with something lighter and finish with the  Twelfth Nocturne, as usual?\"    She led the way, and stood by the piano, rippling her fingers over the  keys, and he stood before her, his face white and intense with feeling.  He laid his strong, brown fingers over the white ones, and raised them  to his lips, and Silvia laughed a trifle nervously. It was one of his  old-world ways that she liked, but disapproved with all proper  democratic fervor.    \"Has it indeed been a loving cup from which we have drunk?\" he said,  with passionate sadness. \"I dare not think so, I dare not even hope so  much grace! And yet how is it possible that a man should feel what I  feel for you unless there is a response, little as he may deserve  it----\"    He paused, and she took away her hand, and laid it lightly on his  shoulder as he sank down on the seat before the piano.    \"Please don't,\" she said gently. \"Don't you see that you are quite  right? If it were really, truly love that had come to you, I should feel  it also, there could be no question of doubting or daring; no thought of  hopelessness. Some time you will know that this is true, when some other  heart speaks to yours in the unmistakable tone of the one only love of  your heart. Each of us has his place in life, and in the lives of those  with whom we come in contact. No one can ever have your place; I can't  tell you how much rest and happiness you have brought me when I have  been a-weary of this world. Come, Orrin, don't rob me of my friend that  I may lose a lover.\"    By a herculean effort he restrained his feelings, and answered lightly,  \"You shall keep your friend, my sorceress of song,\" but he added under  his breath, \"Look to it, when the lover comes, for you may still lose  _him_.\" Then he took up his violin, and the night became a splendid  harmony, despite the discord that raged in his soul.
