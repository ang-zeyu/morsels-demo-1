Crude enough, if we please; but the year was 1826,  and we may feel that the boyish speaker is already on the generous side  and has the gift of fruitful sympathies.    In the spacious tournaments of old history, we may smile to hear  debating forms and ceremony applied to everlasting controversies. 'Sir,'  he opens on one occasion, 'I declare that as far as regards myself, I  shall have very little difficulty in stating my grounds on which I give  my vote for James Graham [the Marquis of Montrose]. It is because I look  upon him as a hero, not merely endowed with that animal ferocity which  has often been the sole qualification which has obtained men that  appellation from the multitude--I should be sorry indeed if he had no  testimonials of his merits, save such as arise from the mad and  thoughtless exclamations of popular applause.' In the same gallant style  (Jan. 26, 1826) he votes for Marcus Aurelius, in answer to the question  whether Trajan has any equal among the Roman emperors from Augustus  onwards. Another time the question was between John Hampden and  Clarendon. 'Sir, I look back with pleasure to the time when we  unanimously declared our disapprobation of the impeachment of the Earl  of Strafford. I wish I could hope for the same unanimity now, but I will  endeavour to regulate myself by the same principles as directed me  then.... Now, sir, with regard to the impeachment of the five members,  it is really a little extraordinary to hear the honourable opener  talking of the violence offered by the king, and the terror of the  parliament. Sir, do we not all know that the king at that time had  neither friends nor wealth?... Did the return of these members with a  triumphant mob accompanying them indicate terror? Did the demands of  the parliament or the insolence of their language show it?' So he  proceeds through all the well-worn arguments; and 'therefore it is,' he  concludes, 'that I give my vote to the Earl of Clarendon, because he  gave his support to the falling cause of monarchy; because he stood by  his church and his king; because he adopted the part which loyalty,  reason, and moderation combined to dictate.... Poverty, banishment, and  disgrace he endured without a murmur; he still adhered to the cause of  justice, he still denounced the advocates of rebellion, and if he failed  in his reward in life, oh, sir, let us not deny it to him after death.  In him, sir, I admire the sound philosopher, the rigid moralist, the  upright statesman, the candid historian.... In Hampden I see the  splendour of patriotic bravery obscured by the darkness of rebellion,  and the faculties by which he might have been a real hero and real  martyr, prostituted in the cause,' and so on, with all the promise of  the _os magna soniturum_, of which time was to prove the resources so  inexhaustible. On one great man he passed a final judgment that years  did not change:--'Debate on Sir R. Walpole: Hallam, Gaskell, Pickering,  and Doyle spoke. Voted for him. Last time, when I was almost entirely  ignorant of the subject, against him. There were sundry considerable  blots, but nothing to overbalance or to spoil the great merit of being  the bulwark of the protestant succession, his commercial measures, and  in general his pacific policy.'[28]                                ETON MISCELLANY    As for the _Eton Miscellany_, which was meant to follow earlier attempts  in the same line, the best-natured critic cannot honestly count it  dazzling. Such things rarely are; for youth, though the most adorable of  our human stages, cannot yet have knowledge or practice enough, whether  in life or books, to make either good prose or stirring verse, unless by  a miracle of genius, and even that inspiration is but occasional. The  _Microcosm_ (1786-87) and the _Etonian_ (1818), with such hands as  Canning and Frere, Moultrie and Praed, were well enough. The newcomer  was a long way behind these in the freshness, brilliance, daring, by  which only such juvenile performances can either please or interest.  George Selwyn and Gladstone were joint editors, and each provided pretty  copious effusions. 'I cannot keep my temper,' he wrote afterwards in his  diary in 1835, on turning over the _Miscellany_, 'in perusing my own  (with few exceptions) execrable productions.' Certainly his  contributions have no particular promise or savour, no hint of the  strong pinions into which the half-fledged wings were in time to expand.  Their motion, such as it is, must be pronounced mechanical; their phrase  and cadence conventional. Even when sincere feelings were deeply  stirred, the flight cannot be called high. The most moving public event  in his schooldays was undoubtedly the death of Canning, and to Gladstone  the stroke was almost personal. In September 1827 he tells his mother  that he has for the first time visited Westminster Abbey,--his object,  an eager pilgrimage to the newly tenanted grave of his hero, and in the  _Miscellany_ he pays a double tribute. In the prose we hear sonorous  things about meridian splendour, premature extinction, and inscrutable  wisdom; about falling, like his great master Pitt, a victim to his proud  and exalted station; about being firm in principle and conciliatory in  action, the friend of improvement and the enemy of innovation. Nor are  the versified reflections in Westminster Abbey much more striking:--      Oft in the sculptured aisle and swelling dome,    The yawning grave hath given the proud a home;    Yet never welcomed from his bright career    A mightier victim than it welcomed here:    Again the tomb may yawn--again may death    Claim the last forfeit of departing breath;    Yet ne'er enshrine in slumber dark and deep    A nobler, loftier prey than where thine ashes sleep.    Excellent in feeling, to be sure; but as a trial of poetic delicacy or  power, wanting the true note, and only worth recalling for an instant as  we go.                                        III                                    FRIENDS    As nearly always happens, it was less by school work or spoken addresses  in juvenile debate, or early attempts in the great and difficult art of  written composition, than by blithe and congenial comradeship that the  mind of the young Gladstone was stimulated, opened, strengthened. In  after days he commemorated among his friends George Selwyn, afterwards  bishop of New Zealand and of Lichfield, 'a man whose character is summed  up, from alpha to omega, in the single word, noble, and whose high  office, in a large measure, it was to reintroduce among the anglican  clergy the pure heroic type.' Another was Francis Doyle, 'whose genial  character supplied a most pleasant introduction for his unquestionable  poetic genius.' A third was James Milnes Gaskell, a youth endowed with  precocious ripeness of political faculty, an enthusiast, and with a  vivacious humour that enthusiasts often miss. Doyle said of him that his  nurse must have lulled him to sleep by parliamentary reports, and his  first cries on awaking in his cradle must have been 'hear, hear'!  Proximity of rooms 'gave occasion or aid to the formation of another  very valuable friendship, that with Gerald Wellesley, afterwards dean of  Windsor, which lasted, to my great profit, for some sixty years, until  that light was put out.' In Gaskell's room four or five of them would  meet, and discuss without restraint the questions of politics that were  too modern to be tolerated in public debate. Most of them were friendly  to catholic emancipation, and to the steps by which Huskisson, supported  by Canning, was cautiously treading in the path towards free trade. The  brightest star in this cheerful constellation was the rare youth who,  though his shining course was run in two-and-twenty years, yet in that  scanty span was able to impress with his vigorous understanding and  graceful imagination more than one of the loftiest minds of his  time.[29] Arthur Hallam was a couple of years younger than Gladstone, no  narrow gulf at that age; but such was the sympathy of genius, such the  affinities of intellectual interest and aspiration spoken and unspoken,  such the charm and the power of the younger with the elder, that rapid  instinct made them close comrades. They clubbed together their rolls and  butter, and breakfasted in one another's rooms. Hallam was not strong  enough for boating, so the more sinewy Gladstone used to scull him up to  the Shallows, and he regarded this toilsome carrying of an idle  passenger up stream as proof positive of no common value set upon his  passenger's company. They took walks together, often to the monument of  Gray, close by the churchyard of the elegy; arguing about the articles  and the creeds; about Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley; about free will, for  Hallam was precociously full of Jonathan Edwards; about politics, old  and new, living and dead; about Pitt and Fox, and Canning and Peel, for  Gladstone was a tory and Hallam pure whig. Hallam was described by Mr.  Gladstone in his old age as one who 'enjoyed work, enjoyed society; and  games which he did not enjoy he left contentedly aside. His temper was  as sweet as his manners were winning. His conduct was without a spot or  even a speck. He was that rare and blessed creature, _anima naturaliter  Christiana_. He read largely, and though not superficial, yet with an  extraordinary speed. He had no high or exclusive ways.' Thus, as so many  have known in that happy dawn of life, before any of the imps of  disorder and confusion have found their way into the garden, it was the  most careless hours,--careless of all save truth and beauty,--that were  the hours best filled.                                ARTHUR HALLAM    Youth will commonly do anything rather than write letters, but the  friendship of this pair stood even that test. The pages are redolent of  a living taste for good books and serious thoughts, and amply"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21102"],[0,"Tom and Some Other Girls: A Public School Story (#10)"],[1,"she drew aside her skirt to exhibit her own flat feet.    \"They _are_ awful!  I love pretty shoes, too; and the first time I wore  these I--I _cried_!  I was very home-sick, you see, and nervous and  anxious about my work, and it seemed the last straw.  Never mind! it's  only a little thing, and on Thursday you shall wear your very best pair  and I'll wear mine, and we'll compare notes and see which is the  prettier.\"    To say that Rhoda adored her is to state the matter feebly.  She could  have knelt down in the passage and kissed the ugly little feet; she  could have done homage before this young mistress as before a saint;  when the light streamed out of a window and rested on her head, it  seemed to take the form of a halo!    She went meekly downstairs, procured the shoes, and carried them into  Dorothy's cubicle, to display before the eyes of that horrified young  woman.    \"There!  We've got to wear those, too!  It's the rule.  Miss Everett  told me, and gave me an order to get them.  You had better ask her for  one before Thomasina gets a chance.\"    Dorothy looked at her solemnly, and measured the slipper against her own  neat shoe; then she took off the latter and held the two side by side.  One was arched and slim, the other flat and square; one had French heels  and little sparkling buckles, the other was of dull leather, unrelieved  by any trace of ornament.    \"Here's deggeradation!\" she sighed hopelessly.  \"Here's deggeradation!\"        CHAPTER SEVEN.    THE RECORD WALL.    There was no end to the surprises of that wonderful school!  When Rhoda  returned to her cubicle to get \"tidy\" for dinner, she washed, brushed  her hair, put an extra pin in her tie to make sure that it was straight,  wriggled round before the glass to see that belt and bodice were  immaculately connected, put a clean handkerchief in her pocket, nicked  the clothes-brush over her skirt, and, what could one do more?  It  seemed on the face of it that one could do nothing, but the other girls  had accomplished a great deal more than this.  Rhoda never forgot the  shock of dismay which she experienced on first stepping forth, and  beholding them.  It was surely a room full of boys, not girls, for  skirts had disappeared, and knickerbockers reigned in their stead.  The  girls wore gym. costumes, composed of the aforesaid knickers, and a  short tunic, girt round the waist with a blue sash, to represent the  inevitable house colour.  Thomasina's aspect was astounding, as she  strode to and fro awaiting the gathering of her forces, and the new  girls stared at her with distended eyeballs.  Rhoda had registered a vow  never to volunteer a remark to the hateful creature; but Dorothy  stammered out a breathless--    \"You never said--We never knew--Is it a _rule_?\"    \"Not compulsory, or I would have told you; you may do as you please.  They wear gyms, at Wycombe in the afternoon, and we have adopted the  idea to a certain extent.  Most of the girls prefer it for the sake of  the games, for it is so much easier to run about like this.  For myself,  I affect it for the sake of appearances.  It is so becoming to my  youthful charms.\"    She simpered as she spoke, with an affectation of coyness that was  irresistibly amusing.  Dorothy laughed merrily, and Rhoda resisted doing  the same only by an enormous effort of self-will.  She succeeded,  however, in looking sulky and bad-tempered, and went downstairs feeling  quite pleased with herself for resisting an unworthy impulse.    All the old girls were in gym. costume, and a quaint sight it was to  watch them descending the great central staircase.  Lanky girls, looking  lankier than ever; fat girls, looking fatter than ever; tall girls  magnified into giantesses; poor little stumpies looking as if viewed  through a bad piece of window glass.  Plump legs, scraggy legs, and legs  of one width all the way down, and at the end of each the sad,  inevitable shoe, and down each back the sad, inevitable pigtail!  Now  and again would come a figure, light and graceful as a fawn, the  embodiment of charming youth; but as a rule the effect was far from  becoming.    Rhoda's criticisms, however, were less scathing than usual, for she  herself was suffering from an unusual attack of humility!  If any reader  of this veracious history has to do with the management of a self-  confident, high-spirited girl, who needs humbling and bringing to her  senses, let the author confidently recommend the pigtail and flat-heeled  system!  To fasten back a mane of hair is at once to deprive the culprit  of one of her most formidable means of defence.    She has no shelter behind which to retire, as an ambush from the enemy;  she has nothing to toss and whisk from side to side, expressing defiance  without a word being uttered.  The very weight of the pigtail is a  sobering influence; its solemn, pendulum movement is incompatible with  revolt.  As for the slippers--well, try heel-less shoes yourself, and  test their effect!  They bring one to earth, indeed, in the deepest  sense of the word.  All very well to mince about in French shoes, and  think \"What a fine girl am I,\" but once try mincing in flat, square  soles, and you will realise that the days are over for that kind of  thing, and that nothing remains but humility and assent!    Dinner over, the girls adjourned into the grounds; but as games, like  lessons, could not be begun without some preliminary arrangement, most  of the pupils contented themselves with strolling about, in twos and  threes, exchanging confidences about the holidays and hatching plans for  the weeks to come.  Rhoda and Dorothy were standing disconsolately  together, when Miss Everett flitted past, and stopped for a moment to  take pity on their loneliness.    \"What are you two going to do?  You mustn't stand here looking like  pelicans in the wilderness.  You must walk about and get some exercise.  I'm too busy to go with you myself, but--er--Kathleen!\"  She held up her  hand in summons to the second-term girl who had volunteered information  about the Lords and Commons--\"Here, Kathleen, you remember what it is to  be a new girl; take Rhoda and Dorothy round the grounds, and show them  everything that is interesting.  Have a brisk walk, all of you, and come  back with some colour in your cheeks!\"    She was off again, smiling and waving her hand, and the three girls  stood gazing at each other in shy, uncertain fashion.    \"Well,\" said Kathleen, \"where shall we go first?  The Beech Walk, I  suppose; it's half-a-mile long, so if we go to the end and back we shall  have a constitutional before looking at the sights.  The grounds are  very fine here, and there is lots of room for all we want to do.  You  can find a sunny bit, or a shady bit, according to the weather, but it's  only on really scorching days that we are allowed to lounge.  Then  there's a scramble for hammocks, and the lucky girls tie them on to the  branches of trees, and swing about, while the others sit on the grass.  Once or twice we had tea under the trees, and that was fine, but as a  rule they keep you moving.  Games are nearly as hard work as lessons!\"    \"But you needn't play unless you like?\"    \"Oh, yes, you must; unless you are ill or tired.  You can get off any  day if you don't feel well, but not altogether.  And you would not wish  to either.  It would be so horribly flat!  Once you are into a team, you  are all anxiety to get into another, and I can tell you when you see  your remove posted up on the board, it is b-liss!--perfect bliss!\"    The recruits laughed, and looked at their new friend with approving  glances.  She was, so far, the only one of the girls who had treated  them on an equality, and gave herself no air of patronage, and they were  correspondingly appreciative.  They asked eagerly in which games she had  won her remove, and Rhoda, at least, was disappointed at the answer.    \"Cricket!  That's the great summer game.  I've three brothers at home,  and used to practise with them sometimes to make an extra one.  They  snubbed me, of course: but I'm not a bad bat, though I say it myself.\"    \"And what about tennis?\"    \"Um-m!\"  Kathleen pursed up her lips.  \"We have courts, of course, but  its rather--_Missy_, don't you think?  The sports captains look down on  it, and so, of course, it's unpopular.  The little girls play  occasionally.  It keeps them happy.\"    This was a nice way to speak of a game which had been for years the  popular amusement of young England!  Rhoda was so shocked and  disappointed that she hardly dared mention croquet, and it seemed,  indeed, as if it would have been better if she had refrained, for  Kathleen fairly shouted at the name.    \"My dear, how can you!  _Nobody_ plays croquet except old tab-- I mean  ladies who are too old to do anything else.  Miss Bruce plays sometimes  when she has the vicar's wife to tea.  We hide behind the bushes and  watch them and shake with laughter.  _Croquet_, indeed!  I should like  to see Tom's face if you mentioned croquet to her!\"    \"It's a matter of perfect indifference to me what Miss Bolderston  thinks,\" said Rhoda, loftily; but she veered away from the subject of  games all the same and tackled lessons instead.    \"Are you working for any special examination, or just taking it easily?\"    \"I'm going in for the Oxford Senior in summer.  My birthday is so  horribly arranged that it comes just one week before the limit.  A few  days later would give me a year to the good, but as it is it's my last  chance.  If I can only scrape through in preliminaries I am not afraid  of the rest, but I am hopelessly bad in arithmetic.  I add up with all  my fingers, and even then the result comes wrong; and when so much  depends upon it I know I shall get flurried and be worse than ever.\"    \"The great thing is to keep cool.  If you don't lose your head, I  shouldn't wonder if the excitement helped you.  Say to yourself, `_Don't  be a fool_!' "]]]
