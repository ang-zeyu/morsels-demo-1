[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22885"],[0,"Hindu Gods And Heroes (#10)"],[1,"in the year 3102 B.C., shortly after the great war  described in the Mahabharata. The date 3102, I need hardly remark, is  of no historical value, being based merely upon the theories of  comparatively late astronomers; but the statement as a whole is  important. The Great War marks an epoch. It came at the end of what  may be called the pre-historic period, and was followed by a new age.  To be strictly correct, we must say that the age which followed the  Great War was not new in the sense that it introduced any startling  novelties that had been unknown previously; but it was new in the  sense that after the Great War India speedily became the India that we  know from historical records. A certain fusion of different races,  cultures, and ideals had to take place in order that the peculiar  civilisation of India might unfold itself; and this fusion was  accomplished about the time of the Great War, and partly no doubt by  means of the Great War, some ten centuries before the Christian era.    The story of the Great War is told with a wild profusion of mythical  and legendary colouring in the Mahabharata, an epic the name of which  means literally \"The Great Tale of the Bharata Clan.\" It relates how  the blind old King Dhritarashtra of Hastinapura had a hundred sons,  known as the Kuru or Kaurava princes, the eldest of whom was  Duryodhana, and Dhritarashtra's brother Pandu had five sons, the  Pandava brethren; how the Pandavas were ousted by the Kauravas from  the kingdom, the eldest Pandava prince Yudhishthira having been  induced to stake the fortunes of himself and his brethren on a game of  dice, in which he was defeated; how the five Pandavas, with their  common wife Draupadi (observe this curious and ugly feature of  polyandry, which is quite opposed to standard Hindu morals, but is by  no means unparalleled in early Indian literature[20]) retired into  exile for thirteen years, and then came back with a great army of  allies, and after fierce and bloody battles with the Kauravas and  their supporters in the plain of Kurukshetra at last gained the  victory, slew the Kauravas, and established Yudhishthira as king in  Hastinapura. Among the Pandavas the leading part is played by the  eldest, Yudhishthira, and the third, Arjuna; of the others, Bhima, the  second, is a Hercules notable only for his strength, courage, and  fidelity, while the twins Nakula and Sahadeva are colourless figures.  Krishna plays an important part in the story; for on the return of  the Pandavas to fight the Kauravas he accompanies Arjuna as his  charioteer, and on the eve of the first battle delivers to him a  discourse on his religion, the Bhagavad-gita, or Lord's Song, which  has become one of the most famous and powerful of all the sacred books  of India.    [Footnote 20: See H. Raychaudhuri, _Materials for the Study of the  Early History of the Vaishnava Sect, p. 27_.]    Now if the Mahabharata were as homogeneous even as the Iliad and  Odyssey, which give us a fairly consistent and truthful picture of a  single age, we should be in a very happy position. Unfortunately this  is not the case. Our epic began as a Bharata, or Tale of the Bharata  Clan, probably of very moderate bulk, not later than 600 B.C., and  perhaps considerably earlier; and from that time onward it went on  growing bigger and bigger for over a thousand years, as editors  stuffed in new episodes and still longer discourses on nearly all the  religious and philosophic doctrines admitted within the four walls of  Hinduism, until it grew to its present immense bulk, which it claims  to amount to 100,000 verses. Thus it pictures the thought not of one  century but of more than ten, and we cannot feel sure of the date of  any particular statement in it. Nevertheless we can distinguish in a  general way between the old skeleton of the story, in which the theme  is treated in simple epic fashion, society is far freer than in later  days and no one objects to eating beef, from the additional matter, in  which the tale is recast in a far more grandiose vein and is padded  out with enormous quantities of moral, religious, and philosophic  sermons. The religion too is different in the different parts. In the  older portions the gods who are most popular are Indra, Agni, and  Brahma--not the neuter abstract Brahma, but the masculine Brahma, the  Demiurge, who corresponds more or less to Prajapati of the Brahmanas  and is represented in classical art as a four-headed old man reciting  the Vedas--and Krishna seems to figure only as a hero or at best as a  demigod; but the later parts with fine impartiality claim the  supremacy of heaven variously for Siva, Brahma, and Vishnu; and  Vishnu, as we have seen, is sometimes identified with Krishna, notably  in the chapters known as the Bhagavad-gita.    The gods have changed somewhat since earlier days. Indra has settled  down in the constitutional monarchy of Paradise assigned to him by  the Brahmanas; he now figures as the prototype of earthly kings,  leading the armies of the gods to war against the demons when occasion  requires, and passing the leisure of peace in the enjoyment of  celestial dissipation. His morals have not improved: he is a debonair  debauchee. Brahma the Creator, a more popular version of Prajapati, is  still too impersonal to have much hold on the popular imagination; the  same is the case with Agni the Fire-god. Plainly there was a vacancy  for a supreme deity whose character was powerful enough to move men's  souls, either through awe or love; and for this vacancy there were two  strong candidates, Vishnu and Siva, who in course of time succeeded to  the post and divided the supremacy between them.    Vishnu has altered immensely since last we met him. First, after an  extraordinary change in his own character, he has been identified with  Narayana, and then both of them have been equated with Krishna. The  development is so portentous that it calls for a little study.    We have seen that in the Vedas Vishnu appears to be, and in the  Brahmanas certainly is, the embodied Spirit of the Sacrifice, and that  ritual mysticism has invented for him a supreme home in the highest  heaven. But in the Epics he has developed into a radiant and gracious  figure of ideal divinity, an almighty saviour with a long record of  holy works for the salvation of mankind, a god who delights in moral  goodness as well as in ritual propriety, and who from time to time  incarnates himself in human or animal form so as to maintain the order  of righteousness. Symbolism has further endowed him with a consort,  the goddess Sri or Lakshmi, typifying fortune; sometimes also he is  represented with another wife, the Earth-goddess. The divine hawk or  kite Garuda, who seems to have been originally the same as the eagle  who in the Rigvedic legend carried off the soma for Indra, has been  pressed into his service; he now rides on Garuda, and bears his figure  upon his banner. I have already suggested a possible explanation of  this evolution (above, p. 41): owing to his close association with  Indra, the most truly popular of Rigvedic deities, the laic  imagination transfused some of the live blood of Indra into the veins  of the priestly abstraction Vishnu. To the plain man Indra was very  real; and as he frequently heard tales of Indra being aided in his  exploits by Vishnu, he came to regard Vishnu as a very present helper  in trouble. The friend of Indra became the friend of mankind. The post  of Indra had already been fixed for him by the theologians; but the  functions of Vishnu, outside the rituals, were still somewhat vaguely  defined, and were capable of considerable expansion. Here was a great  opportunity for those souls who were seeking for a supreme god of  grace, and were not satisfied to find him in Siva; and they made full  use of it, and wholly transformed the personality of Vishnu.    One of the stages in this transformation was the absorption of  Narayana in Vishnu. Narayana was originally a god of a different kind.  The earliest reference to him is in a Brahmana which calls him Purusha  Narayana, which means that it regards him as being the same as the  Universal Spirit which creates from itself the cosmos; it relates that  Purusha Narayana pervaded the whole of nature (SB. XII. iii. 4, 1),  and that he made himself omnipresent and supreme over all beings by  performing a _pancha-ratra sattra_, or series of sacrifices lasting  over five days (ib. XIII. vi. 1, 1). Somewhat later we find prayers  addressed to Narayana, Vasudeva, and Vishnu as three phases of the  same god (Taitt. Aran. X. i. 6). But was Narayana in origin merely a  variety of the Vedic Purusha or our old acquaintance Prajapati? His  name must give us pause. The most simple explanation of it is that it  is a family name: as Karshnayana means a member of the Krishna-family  and Ranayana a man belonging to the family of Rana, so Narayana would  naturally denote a person of the family of Nara. But Nara itself  signifies a _man_: is the etymology therefore reduced to absurdity?  Not at all: Nara is also used as a proper name, as we shall see.[21]  Probably the name really means what naturally it would seem to mean,  \"a man of the Nara family\"; that Narayana was originally a divine or  deified saint, a _rishi_, as the Hindus would call him; and that  somehow he became identified with Vishnu and the Universal Spirit.    [Footnote 21: It must be admitted that ancient writers give different  etymologies of the name: thus, a poet in the Mahabharata (III.  clxxxix. 3) derives it from _narah_, \"waters,\" and _ayanam_, \"going,\"  understanding it to mean \"one who has the waters for his  resting-place\"; Manu (I. 10, with Medhatithi's commentary), accepting  the same etymology, interprets it as \"the dwelling-place of all the  Naras\"; and in the Mahabharata XII. cccxli. 39, it is also explained  as \"the dwelling-place of mankind.\" But these interpretations"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22886"],[0,"Cinderella in the South: Twenty-Five South African Tales (#10)"],[1," called to take up once again. I tried to paint it as he dreamed  of it the crowds, the classes, the fog, the scent of the streets.  Then I went higher to the Easter scene, the shore in the morning,  the vision of the altar that dawns on a true man's work however  deep the night of his failure may have been, wheresoever in all  the world he is working.    Leonard looked gratefully at me as I came down the pulpit steps.    While we hurried along from the Service on our way to the station  (Reeve was coming to see me off), I quoted some words to him. We  were just passing that fish-shop.    'Awake, O north wind, and come, thou south; blow upon my garden  that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into  his garden.'    His eyes kindled. 'Yes, old man,' he said; 'I've come into my  garden. How I used to dream of this sort of reek out in Africa!'    I felt a gross materialist as I hurried home to my roses and  red-thorn, leaving him to that visionary garden and those mystical  spices.        THE PLACE OF PILGRIMAGE    I.    'When you have set Thought free for one particular end you cannot  bind her again as you will.' Such is the purport of a certain  historian's dictum, and I have proved the truth of what he says.  Edgar used to go to the Place of Pilgrimage long ago in his  holidays, but I used not to go with him. I did not sympathize  with his veneration overmuch in those times of long ago. But I  respected the desire for hero-worship, and helped him thither  each year that he wanted to visit his shrine. He used to come up  for his long holidays every year from the colony. I had known his  father rather well, and he had not any settled home. His mother  was dead, as well as his father. No one now that knew him need  know what she was like, for he took after his father almost  unmitigatedly. His father was blonde and aggressively Saxon in  appearance. His mother had been Dutch, semi-Dutch, of the colored  Dutch type, as I very well knew. She came from the Western  province, and died when he was but a year old, to be followed  by his father some ten years later, just when he had come  back to South Africa from England. Then I, acting on my own  responsibility, sent him to school in the Eastern Province.  No one seemed to bother, even if they had any inkling of his  mother's parentage; he looked to be so completely his father's  son.    It was in Edgar's schooldays that the Place of Pilgrimage was  inaugurated, and that a big star of hope swam into his ken. I had  told him about Oxford before, but there had then seemed no sort  of path open for him to go up thither. Now, in the midst of his  schooldays, there opened out to him a path that he thought he  might climb. It was then in the next long holiday time that he  took his path, a curious and grateful pilgrim, to the Matopos, to  explore the shrine and to give thanks before it.    He dreamed of being a Rhodes scholar years before it came off  that Rhodes scholarship of his. It came in the fullness of time a  thing of many struggles and prayers, of star-led hopes and paths  steep with uphill climbing.    Then at last it was that I agreed to go with him on his yearly  pilgrimage, in September, the month of his sailing for home. May  used to be a Canterbury month in England, the hawthorn month that  pricked men in their courages and sent them out on the Kentish  road. September had been Edgar's pilgrimage month every year a  spring month in our southern country. The masasa leaves were  taking many tints then in Mashonaland. Speaking generally, the  dominant note of our woodland world was rose-color as we tramped  together to the station. Matabeleland by contrast seemed rather  drab and drouthy, yet she was showing signs of spring. One great  rock stood up very beautiful in a pink lichen garment. It was  hard by the path that led to the last hill-climb, ere you reached  the burial-place. We camped out close beside it, two Mashona boys  who had come to seek their fortunes in Bulawayo, and Edgar and I.    When the morning light came I was up. When the sun rose I had all  but finished my service. There, on his own ground, so to speak,  it seemed easier to pray for the Patron with a sanguine heart,  and to give thanks for him with a clear conscience. Over our  breakfast we sat on and talked, and looked about us. Edgar seemed  to me to be growing in discernment. Once he had seemed so  provocatively cock-sure about his mighty patron. To pray for him  as we had prayed that morning in the language of a race he had  contemned might have sounded to him in years past mere clerical  impertinence. Now he seemed to suffer me rather gladly.    But he said little. We had scant time to spare just then; there  were so many miles to go to the railway. He was to leave for  Oxford that very night. While the carriers were cooking their  breakfast he came with me to the grave and knelt at the head,  looking northwards. I said nothing aloud, nor did he. The rocks  bulked dark in the bright air, the hills wore mystic colors, the  sun shone passionately in a setting of tender blue. Words seemed  a presumption just then, too much of a time or nation or age that  passes. That which may or may not take shape in words remained  the untied power of silent prayer. That morning among the  many-colored hills I looked to sight the faith that can remove such  as these. And I prayed there quietly, in prayer that seemed to  need no words, for Edgar. I asked for him that he might see those  visions without which! people are apt to perish.    II.    He did not write much, and he did not come for five years. When  he came he was not at first communicative. He seemed to take more  interest than he used to do in the Mission, I noticed. He had  always been a hero among the Mashona boys: that was no new thing.  And I was thankful indeed to see that he had not lost his old  artless art of making friends with them. So many things might  have conspired to rob him of it. He stayed but a month in all at  the Mission, and he said little all that time, but his eyes were  full of thought as I talked to him passing on to him hopes,  disappointments, joys of battle unabating and enhanced. He was a  good listener. I did not try to force the pace with him. But for  all that I was eager to know his mind. And it seemed a long while  waiting and waiting, thinking he might be going to speak day  after day. Then at last the time did come for him to speak, but  it was after he had left the Mission.    History repeated itself, and we camped in the old place once  more. The camp-fire shone out, and the moon rose broad and golden  over the grave of pilgrimage. There he lay with his feet to the  north on the height above us the founder and name-giver of our  State. It was strange how his patronage seemed to dominate us. We  said our evensong rather northwards than eastwards; we scanned  the northern horizon as though seeking a sign. The wind blew that  way as we paced to and fro afterwards, and our thoughts went the  way of the wind.    At last I broke the silence. We were resting on a ledge of rock  then, smoking, staring away north-wards among the moonlit kopjes.  There he sat beside me, fair-haired and tall, strong and  rejoicing in his strength, always courteous but strangely dumb.  He was going to-morrow. Would he go without a revealing word?    'So many worlds, so much to do, So little done, such things to  be.'    I paused doubtfully.    He turned to me, and his eyes sparkled as they looked into mine.  'Listen,' he said. Then he told me his heart. Little I knew what  it was. I trembled for my crusade, yet not without hope. I had  preached to him little, but I had prayed for him much. Now I  learned that his heart was as my heart, his desire as my heart's  desire, yet, like wine to water, like sunlight to moonlight. I  sat at his feet, so to speak, and listened on and on.    III    The next morning broke very brightly, yet there were clouds  enough on high to mystify its clear shining. There had been a  thunder-shower on the day before yesterday: our former rains had  sent on an advance-guard. We had finished our service before the  day grew hot, in the prime and cool of the morning. The place had  been kept very sacred all that service-time. No hoot of a motor-car  had scared the sleep of those lonely hills. Afterwards it was  different. People came out in crowds from Bulawayo. There was a  special excursion from the Transvaal, I believe, that arrived on  that day of all days. We had breakfasted by our camp-fire. Then  we came up the hill to the shrine once more, while the boys were  clearing up. 'Listen,' said Edgar. A stout Bulawayo bourgeois was  holding forth on the crankiness of Cecil Rhodes in choosing to be  so lonely. 'He might have considered the town and trade of  Bulawayo' seemed to be the burthen of his song. A pioneer shut  him up rather roughly. 'He knew best,' he said. 'Where would your  town and trade be if he hadn't cleared the path?' Edgar went up  to the old fellow, ruddy, stalwart, more or less spirituous,  indomitably good-humored. 'Tell me about it please, sir the  burial; you were here for it, weren't you?' The old fellow  complied with great goodwill.    Bareheaded we stood looking north while he told us of the great  camping-out, with the many twinkling fires, by the dam some miles  away, on the eve of the entombment. He told, too, of the  concourse of Matabele at the place itself next day, and of the  auspicious climbing of the yoked cattle as they drew the body.  'They never turned. They went straight up,' he said. 'You can see  the track-way up the rock now. It meant luck surely, and we took  it so, both black and white of us.'    Then he told us of him who lay there, in words of rugged  tenderness the hero of the old era who brought on the new era so  fast; he who had tasted the old and knew the old was better,  testifying the same by his choice of a burying-place.    We were"]]]
