It was something new Edgar's being like this,  he never remembered him having a bad headache before. \"I expect,\" he  said to himself, \"he got hurt in one of those scrimmages yesterday,  although he did not say anything about it. I do hope that he is not  going to be ill. The examinations are on next week, it will be a  frightful nuisance for him to miss them.\" He went into Edgar's dormitory  again the last thing. He opened the door very quietly in case he should  be asleep.    \"I am not asleep,\" Edgar said; \"I am rather better now. Good-night,  Rupert,\" and he held out his hand. Rupert was surprised at the action,  but took his hand and pressed it.    \"Good-night, Edgar. I do hope that you will be all right in the  morning.\"    \"Good-night, old fellow. God bless you!\" and there was almost a sob in  the lad's voice.    Rupert went out surprised and uneasy. \"Edgar must be worse than he  says,\" he thought to himself. \"It is rum of him saying good-night in  that way. I have never known him do such a thing before. I wish now that  I had asked River-Smith to send round for the doctor. I daresay Edgar  would not have liked it, but it would have been best; but he seemed so  anxious to be quiet and get off to sleep, that I did not think of it.\"    The first thing in the morning Rupert went to his brother's dormitory to  see how he was. He tapped at the door, but there was no answer. Thinking  that his brother was asleep, he turned the handle and went in. An  exclamation of surprise broke from him. Edgar was not there and the bed  had not been slept in, but was just as he had seen it when Edgar was  lying on the outside. On the table was a letter directed to himself. He  tore it open.    \"My dear Rupert,\" it began, \"a horrible thing has happened, and I shall  be off to-night. I have learned that I am not your brother at all, but  that I was fraudulently put in that position. I have been writing this  afternoon to father and mother. Oh! Rupert, to think that it is the last  time I can call them so. They will tell you the whole business. I am  writing this by the light of the lamp in the passage, and you will all  be up in a few minutes, so I have no time to say more. I shall post the  other letter to-night. Good-bye, Rupert! Good-bye, dear old fellow! We  have been happy together, haven't we? and I hope you will always be so.  Perhaps some day when I have made myself a name--for I have no right to  call myself Clinton, and I won't call myself by my real name--I may see  you again. I have taken the note, but I know that you won't grudge it  me.\"    Rupert read the letter through two or three times, then ran down as he  was, in his night-shirt and trousers, and passed in to the master's part  of the private house. \"Robert,\" he said to the man-servant whom he met  in the passage, \"is Mr. River-Smith dressed yet?\"    \"He is not finished dressing yet, Master Clinton; at least he has not  come out of his room. But I expect he is pretty near dressed.\"    \"Will you ask him to come out to me at once, please?\" Rupert said. \"It  is a most serious business, or you may be sure I should not ask.\"    The man asked no questions, for he saw by Rupert's face that this must  be something quite out of the ordinary way. \"Just step into this room  and I will fetch him,\" he said.    In a minute the master came in. \"What is it, Clinton,--nothing serious  the matter, I hope?\"    \"Yes, sir, I am afraid it is something very serious. My brother was not  well yesterday evening. He said that he had a frightful headache, but he  thought it would be all right in the morning, and he went and lay down  on his bed. I thought that he was strange in his manner when I went in  to say good-night to him; and when I went in this morning, sir, the bed  hadn't been slept in and he was gone, and he has left me this note, and  it is evident, as you will see, that he is altogether off his head. You  see, he fancies that he is not my brother.\"    The master had listened with the gravest concern, and now glanced  hastily through the letter.    \"'Tis strange indeed,\" he said. \"There is no possibility, of course,  that there is anything in this idea of his?\"    \"No, sir, of course not. How could there be?\"    \"That I cannot say, Clinton. Anyhow the matter is most serious. Of  course he could not have taken any clothes with him?\"    \"No, sir; at least he cannot have got any beyond what he stands in. I  should think the matron would not have given him any out, especially as  he must have told her that he was ill, or he could not have got into the  dormitory.\"    \"I had better see her first, Clinton; it is always well to be quite sure  of one's ground. You go up and dress while I make the inquiries.\"    Rupert returned to the dormitory, finished dressing, and then ran down  again. \"He has taken no clothes with him, Clinton. The matron says that  he went to her in the afternoon and said that he had a splitting  headache, and wanted to be quite quiet and undisturbed. She offered to  send for the doctor, but he said that he expected that he should be all  right in the morning, but that if he wasn't of course the doctor could  see him then. So she unlocked the door of the dormitory and let him in.  I asked her if he had his boots on. She said no; he was going up in  them, contrary to rule, when she reminded him of it, and he took them  off and put them in the rack in the wood-closet. I have seen the  boot-boy, and he says he noticed when he went there this morning early  to clean them, No. 6 rack was empty. So your brother must have come  down, after he had gone up to the dormitory, and got his boots.    \"Now let us ask a few questions of the servants.\" He rang the bell, and  sent for some of the servants. \"Which of you were down first this  morning?\" he asked.    \"I was down first, sir,\" one of the girls said.    \"Did you find anything unusual?\"    \"Yes, sir. One of the windows downstairs, looking into the yard, was  open, though I know I closed it and put up the shutters last night; and  John says the door of the yard has been unbolted too, and that the lock  had been forced.\"    The master went out, walked across the yard, and examined the lock.    \"There would be no difficulty in opening that on this side,\" he said to  Rupert; \"it could be done with a strong pocket-knife easily enough.\"    \"What is to be done, sir?\" Rupert asked anxiously. \"Shall I telegraph to  my father?\"    \"I think you had better go and see him, Clinton. Your brother probably  did not leave the house until twelve o'clock, though he may have gone at  eleven. But whether eleven or twelve it makes no difference. No doubt he  posted the letter he speaks of the first thing on leaving; but, you see,  it is a cross post to your place, and the letter could not anyhow have  got there for delivery this morning. You can hardly explain it all by  telegram; and I think, as I said, it is better that you should go  yourself. I will have breakfast put for you in my study, and I will have  a fly at the door. You will be able to catch the eight-o'clock train  into Gloucester, and you should be home by eleven.\"    \"You do not think anything could have happened to him?\" Rupert asked  anxiously.    \"No, I do not think that there is any fear of that, Clinton. You see, he  has got a fixed idea in his head; he has evidently acted with  deliberation. Besides, you see in his letter to you he says he shall not  see you until he has made a name for himself. I tell you frankly,  Clinton, that my own impression is that your brother is not mad, but  that he has--of course I do not know how, or attempt to explain it--but  that he has in some way got the idea that he is not your brother. Has he  been quite himself lately?\"    \"Quite, sir; I have seen nothing unusual about him at all.\"    \"Did he seem bright and well yesterday morning?\"    \"Just the same as usual, sir. I was quite surprised when, just at  tea-time, I found that he had gone to lie down with the headache.\"    \"Did he get any letter yesterday?\"    \"No, sir; we neither of us had any letter, in the morning anyhow. He may  have received one in the afternoon, for anything I know.\"    \"I will go and ask Robert,\" the master said; \"he always takes the  letters from the letter-bag.\"    \"No, Clinton,\" he went on when he returned; \"there were only three  letters for the boys in the afternoon mail, and neither of them was for  him. He cannot have seen anyone, can he, who could have told him any  story that would serve as a foundation for this idea?\"    Then an idea flashed across Rupert. \"Well, sir, a rather curious thing  has happened in the last few days. There has been a woman about here,  and it appears she asked one of the boys which were the Clintons; and we  have seen her every time we have been out, and we both noticed that she  has stared at us in a very strange way. I don't know that that can  possibly have anything to do with it. She may have spoken to Edgar  yesterday. Of course I cannot say.\"    \"Well, I must be going now. I have told Robert to put your breakfast in  my study, and to send the boy for a fly.\"    \"What will you say to the boys, sir?\" Rupert asked anxiously.    \"There will be no occasion to say anything for a day or two beyond the  fact that you are obliged to go home suddenly. I shall only say Clinton,  but it will naturally be supposed that I mean both of you. If it gets  out that you have gone alone, which it may do, although I shall give  strict orders to the contrary, I shall of course mention that we fear  that your brother got his head hurt in that football match, and that he  has taken up some strange ideas and has gone off. But it is hardly  likely that the matter will leak out in any way until you return, or I  hear from you. I think you can make yourself quite easy on that score.\"    It was half-past eleven when Rupert Clinton reached home. On the way he  had thought"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22010"],[0,"The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India, Volume 2 (#10)"],[1," eat the flesh of fowls and pigs, and even cats, rats and snakes  in some localities, though the more civilised have abjured these  latter. They are very fond of pork, and drink liquor, and will take  food from Kunbis, Malis and Kolis, but not from Gonds. They have  a caste _panchayat_ or committee, with a headman called Mohtaria,  and two officers known as Phopatia and Dukria. When a caste offence  is committed the Dukria goes to call the offender, and is given the  earthen pots used at the penalty-feast, while the Phopatia receives  a new piece of cloth. The Mohtaria or headman goes from village to  village to decide cases, and gets a share of the fine. The caste are  _shikaris_ or hunters, and cultivators. They catch antelope, hares,  pig and nilgai in their nets, and kill them with sticks and stones,  and they dam up streams and net fish. Birds are not caught. Generally,  the customs of the Andhs clearly point to an aboriginal origin, but  they are rapidly being Hinduised, and in some tracts can scarcely be  distinguished from Kunbis.    They have Marathi names; and though only one name is given at birth,  Mr. Slaney notes that this is frequently changed for some pet name,  and as often as not a man goes regularly by some name other than his  real one.        Arakh      _Arakh._--A small caste of cultivators and labourers found  principally in the Chanda District and Berar and scattered over other  localities. The Arakhs are considered to be an offshoot of the Pasi or  Bahelia caste of hunters and fowlers. Mr. Crooke [32] writes of them:  \"All their traditions connect them with the Pasis and Parasurama, the  sixth Avatara of Vishnu. One story runs that Parasurama was bathing  in the sea, when a leech bit his foot and caused it to bleed. He  divided the blood into two parts; out of one part he made the first  Pasi and out of the second the first Arakh. Another story is that  the Pasis were made out of the sweat (_pasina_) of Parasurama. While  Parasurama was away the Pasi shot some animals with his bow, and  the deity was so enraged that he cursed the Pasi, and swore that  his descendants should keep pigs. This accounts for the degradation  of the Pasis. Subsequently Parasurama sent for some Pasis to help  him in one of his wars; but they ran away and hid in an _arhar_  [33] field and were hence called Arakhs.\" This connection with the  Pasis is also recognised in the case of the Arakhs of Berar, of whom  Mr. Kitts writes: [34] \"The Arakhs found in Morsi are a race akin to  the Bahelias. Their regular occupation is bird-catching and _shikar_  (hunting). They do not follow Hindu customs in their marriages,  but although they keep pigs, eat flesh and drink spirits, they will  not touch a Chamar. They appear to be a branch of the Pasi tribe,  and are described as a semi-Hinduised class of aborigines.\" In the  Chanda District, however, the Arakhs are closely connected with the  Gond tribe, as is evident from their system of exogamy. Thus they  say that they are divided into the Matia, Tekam, Tesli, Godam, Madai,  Sayam and Chorliu septs, worshipping respectively three, four, five,  six, seven, eight and twelve gods; and persons who worship the same  number of gods cannot marry with one another. This system of divisions  according to the different number of gods worshipped is found in the  Central Provinces only among the Gonds and one or two other tribes  like the Baigas, who have adopted it from them, and as some of the  names given above are also Gondi words, no doubt need be entertained  that the Arakhs of Chanda are largely of Gond descent. They are  probably, in fact, the offspring of irregular connections between  the Gonds and Pasis, who, being both frequenters of the forests,  would naturally come much into contact with each other. And being  disowned by the true Pasis on account of their defective pedigree,  they have apparently set up as a separate caste and adopted the name  of Arakh to hide the deficiencies of their ancestry.    The social customs of the Arakhs resemble those of other low Hindu  castes, and need not be given in detail. Their weddings are held  near a temple of Maroti, or if there be none such, then at the place  where the Holi fire was lit in the preceding year. A bride-price  varying from Rs. 25 to Rs. 40 is usually paid. In the case of the  marriage of a widow, the second husband goes to the house of the  woman, where the couple are bathed and seated on two wooden boards,  a branch of a cotton-plant being placed near them. The bridegroom then  ties five strings of black glass beads round the woman's neck. The  dead are mourned for one day only, and a funeral feast is given to  the caste-fellows. The Arakhs are a very low caste, but their touch  does not convey impurity.        Atari        1. General notice.      _Atari, [35] Gandhi, Bukekari._--A small Muhammadan caste of retailers  of scent, incense, tooth-powder and _kunku_ or pink powder. Atari  is derived from _atar_ or _itra_, attar of roses. Gandhi comes from  _gandh_, a Sanskrit word for scent. Bukekari is a Marathi word meaning  a seller of powder. The Ataris number about two hundred persons  in Nagpur, Wardha and Berar. Both Hindus and Muhammadans follow  the profession, but the Hindu Ataris are not a separate caste, and  belong to the Teli, Gurao and Beldar castes. The Muhammadan Ataris,  to whom this article refers, may marry with other Muhammadans, with  the exception of low-class tradesmen like the Pinjaras, Kasais and  Kunjras. One instance of an Atari marrying a Rangrez is known, but  usually they decline to do so. But since they are not considered to  be the equals of ordinary Muhammadans, they constitute more or less  a distinct social group. They are of the same position as Muhammadan  tin-workers, bangle-makers and pedlars, and sometimes intermarry  with them. They admit Hindu converts into the community, but the  women refuse to eat with them, and the better-class families will  not intermarry with converts. A new convert must be circumcised,  but if he is of advanced age, or if his foreskin is wanting, as  sometimes happens, they take a rolled-up betel-leaf and cut it in  two in substitution for the rite.        2. Marriage customs.      It is essential that a girl should be married before adolescence, as it  is said that when the signs of puberty appear in her before wedlock her  parents commit a crime equivalent to the shedding of human blood. The  father of the boy looks for a bride, and after dropping hints to  the girl's family to see if his proposal is acceptable, he sends some  female relatives or friends to discuss the marriage. Before the wedding  the boy is presented with a _chhap_ or ring of gold or silver with  a small cup-like attachment. A _mehar_ or dowry must be given to the  bride, the amount of which is not below Rs. 50 or above Rs. 250. The  bride's parents give her cooking vessels, bedding and a bedstead. After  the wedding, the couple are seated on a cot while the women sing songs,  and they see each other's face reflected in a mirror. The procession  returns after a stay of four days, and is received by the women of  the bridegroom's family with some humorous ceremonies bearing on the  nature of marriage. A feast called Tamm Walima follows, and the couple  are shut up together in an inner room, even though they may be under  age. The marriage includes some Hindu customs, such as the erection  of the _pandal_ or shed, rubbing the couple with turmeric and oil,  and the tying on of _kankans_ or wrist-bands. A girl going wrong  before marriage may be wedded with full rites so long as she has not  conceived, but after conception until her child is born she cannot go  through the ceremony at all. After the birth of the child she may be  married simply with the rite for widows. She retains the child, but it  has no claim to succeed to her husband's property. A widow may marry  again after an interval of forty days from her first husband's death,  and she may wed her younger brother-in-law. Divorce is permitted at  the instance of either party, and for mere disagreement. A man usually  divorces his wife by vowing in the presence of two witnesses that he  will in future consider intercourse with her as incestuous in the same  degree as with his mother. A divorced woman has a claim to her _mehar_  or dowry if not already paid, but forfeits it if she marries again. A  man can marry the daughter of his paternal uncle. The services of a  Kazi at weddings are paid for with a fee of Rs. 1-4, and well-to-do  persons also give him a pair of turbans.        3. Religion.      The Ataris are Muhammadans of the Sunni sect. They revere the  Muhammadan saints, and on the night of Shabrat they let off fireworks  in honour of their ancestors and make offerings of _halwa_ [36] to  them and place lamps and scent on their tombs. They swear by the pig  and abstain from eating its flesh. The dog is considered an unclean  animal and its tail, ears and tongue are especially defiling. If the  hair of a dog falls on the ground they cannot pray in that place  because the souls of the prophets cannot come there. To see a dog  flapping its ears is a bad omen, and a person starting on a journey  should postpone his departure. They esteem the spider, because they  say it spread its web over the mouth of the cave where Hasan and  Husain lay concealed from their enemies and thus prevented it from  being searched. Some of them have Pirs or spiritual preceptors, these  being Muhammadan beggars, not necessarily celibate. The ceremony of  adhesion is that a man should drink sherbet from the cup from which  his preceptor has drunk. They do not observe impurity after a death  nor bathe on returning from a funeral.        4. Social customs.      Liquor is of course prohibited to the Ataris as to other Muhammadans,  but some of them drink it nevertheless. Some of them eat beef and  others abstain. The blood of animals killed must"]]]
