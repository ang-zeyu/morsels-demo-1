But the excitement of the day had tired us out, and we were glad to  forget disappointment in sleep. In the morning it was still foggy, but  we could see a little way around. It was very strange to have the  boundless distance made so narrow, and I felt the strangeness of the  scene. All day long we shivered with cold, and hardly left the cabin. At  last it was night once more, and we in our berths. But nobody slept.    The sea had been growing rougher during the day, and at night the ship  began to pitch as it did at the beginning of the journey. Then it grew  worse. Everything in our cabin was rolling on the floor, clattering and  dinning. Dishes were broken into little bits that flew about from one  end to the other. Bedding from upper berths nearly stifled the people in  the lower ones. Some fell out of their berths, but it was not at all  funny. As the ship turned to one side, the passengers were violently  thrown against that side of the berths, and some boards gave way and  clattered down to the floor. When it tossed on the other side, we could  see the little windows almost touch the water, and closed the shutters  to keep out the sight. The children cried, everybody groaned, and  sailors kept coming in to pick up the things on the floor and carry them  away. This made the confusion less, but not the alarm.    Above all sounds rose the fog horn. It never stopped the long night  through. And oh, how sad it sounded! It pierced every heart, and made us  afraid. Now and then some ship, far away, would answer, like a weak  echo. Sometimes we noticed that the wheels were still, and we knew that  the ship had stopped. This frightened us more than ever, for we imagined  the worst reasons for it.    It was day again, and a little calmer. We slept now, till the afternoon.  Then we saw that the fog had become much thinner, and later on we even  saw a ship, but indistinctly.    Another night passed, and the day that followed was pretty fair, and  towards evening the sky was almost cloudless. The captain said we should  have no more rough weather, for now we were really near Boston. Oh, how  hard it was to wait for the happy day! Somebody brought the news that we  should land to-morrow in the afternoon. We didn't believe it, so he said  that the steward had ordered a great pudding full of raisins for supper  that day as a sure sign that it was the last on board. We remembered the  pudding, but didn't believe in its meaning.    I don't think we slept that night. After all the suffering of our  journey, after seeing and hearing nothing but the sky and the sea and  its roaring, it was impossible to sleep when we thought that soon we  would see trees, fields, fresh people, animals--a world, and that world  America. Then, above everything, was the meeting with friends we had not  seen for years; for almost everybody had some friends awaiting them.    Morning found all the passengers up and expectant. Someone questioned  the captain, and he said we would land to-morrow. There was another long  day, and another sleepless night, but when these ended at last, how busy  we were! First we packed up all the things we did not need, then put on  fresh clothing, and then went on deck to watch for land. It was almost  three o'clock, the hour the captain hoped to reach Boston, but there was  nothing new to be seen. The weather was fair, so we would have seen  anything within a number of miles. Anxiously we watched, and as we  talked of the strange delay, our courage began to give out with our  hope. When it could be borne no longer, a gentleman went to speak to the  captain. He was on the upper deck, examining the horizon. He put off the  arrival for the next day!    You can imagine our feelings at this. When it was worse the captain came  down and talked so assuringly that, in spite of all the disappointments  we had had, we believed that this was the last, and were quite cheerful  when we went to bed.    The morning was glorious. It was the eighth of May, the seventeenth day  after we left Hamburg. The sky was clear and blue, the sun shone  brightly, as if to congratulate us that we had safely crossed the stormy  sea; and to apologize for having kept away from us so long. The sea had  lost its fury; it was almost as quiet as it had been at Hamburg before  we started, and its color was a beautiful greenish blue. Birds were all  the time in the air, and it was worth while to live merely to hear their  songs. And soon, oh joyful sight! we saw the tops of two trees!    What a shout there rose! Everyone pointed out the welcome sight to  everybody else, as if they did not see it. All eyes were fixed on it as  if they saw a miracle. And this was only the beginning of the joys of  the day!    What confusion there was! Some were flying up the stairs to the upper  deck, some were tearing down to the lower one, others were running in  and out of the cabins, some were in all parts of the ship in one minute,  and all were talking and laughing and getting in somebody's way. Such  excitement, such joy! We had seen two trees!    Then steamers and boats of all kinds passed by, in all directions. We  shouted, and the men stood up in the boats and returned the greeting,  waving their hats. We were as glad to see them as if they were old  friends of ours.    Oh, what a beautiful scene! No corner of the earth is half so fair as  the lovely picture before us. It came to view suddenly,--a green field,  a real field with grass on it, and large houses, and the dearest hens  and little chickens in all the world, and trees, and birds, and people  at work. The young green things put new life into us, and are so dear  to our eyes that we dare not speak a word now, lest the magic should  vanish away and we should be left to the stormy scenes we know.    But nothing disturbed the fairy sight. Instead, new scenes appeared,  beautiful as the first. The sky becomes bluer all the time, the sun  warmer; the sea is too quiet for its name, and the most beautiful blue  imaginable.    What are the feelings these sights awaken! They can not be described. To  know how great was our happiness, how complete, how free from even the  shadow of a sadness, you must make a journey of sixteen days on a stormy  ocean. Is it possible that we will ever again be so happy?    It was about three hours since we saw the first landmarks, when a number  of men came on board, from a little steamer, and examined the passengers  to see if they were properly vaccinated (we had been vaccinated on the  \"Polynesia\"), and pronounced everyone all right. Then they went away,  except one man who remained. An hour later we saw the wharves.    Before the ship had fully stopped, the climax of our joy was reached.  One of us espied the figure and face we had longed to see for three long  years. In a moment five passengers on the \"Polynesia\" were crying,  \"Papa,\" and gesticulating, and laughing, and hugging one another, and  going wild altogether. All the rest were roused by our excitement, and  came to see our father. He recognized us as soon as we him, and stood  apart on the wharf not knowing what to do, I thought.    What followed was slow torture. Like mad things we ran about where there  was room, unable to stand still as long as we were on the ship and he on  shore. To have crossed the ocean only to come within a few yards of him,  unable to get nearer till all the fuss was over, was dreadful enough.  But to hear other passengers called who had no reason for hurry, while  we were left among the last, was unendurable.    Oh, dear! Why can't we get off the hateful ship? Why can't papa come to  us? Why so many ceremonies at the landing?    We said good-bye to our friends as their turn came, wishing we were in  their luck. To give us something else to think of, papa succeeded in  passing us some fruit; and we wondered to find it anything but a great  wonder, for we expected to find everything marvellous in the strange  country.    Still the ceremonies went on. Each person was asked a hundred or so  stupid questions, and all their answers were written down by a very slow  man. The baggage had to be examined, the tickets, and a hundred other  things done before anyone was allowed to step ashore, all to keep us  back as long as possible.    Now imagine yourself parting with all you love, believing it to be a  parting for life; breaking up your home, selling the things that years  have made dear to you; starting on a journey without the least  experience in travelling, in the face of many inconveniences on account  of the want of sufficient money; being met with disappointment where it  was not to be expected; with rough treatment everywhere, till you are  forced to go and make friends for yourself among strangers; being  obliged to sell some of your most necessary things to pay bills you did  not willingly incur; being mistrusted and searched, then half starved,  and lodged in common with a multitude of strangers; suffering the  miseries of seasickness, the disturbances and alarms of a stormy sea for  sixteen days; and then stand within, a few yards of him for whom you did  all this, unable to even speak to him easily. How do you feel?    Oh, it's our turn at last! We are questioned, examined, and dismissed! A  rush over the planks on one side, over the ground on the other, six wild  beings cling to each other, bound by a common bond of tender joy, and  the long parting is at an END."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2064"],[0,"A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (#10)"],[1," I directed them to bring a bundle into the  room, and slept upon it in my riding coat.  Mr. Boswell being more  delicate, laid himself sheets with hay over and under him, and lay in  linen like a gentleman.          SKY.  ARMIDEL      In the morning, September the second, we found ourselves on the edge of  the sea.  Having procured a boat, we dismissed our Highlanders, whom I  would recommend to the service of any future travellers, and were ferried  over to the Isle of Sky.  We landed at Armidel, where we were met on the  sands by Sir Alexander Macdonald, who was at that time there with his  lady, preparing to leave the island and reside at Edinburgh.    Armidel is a neat house, built where the Macdonalds had once a seat,  which was burnt in the commotions that followed the Revolution.  The  walled orchard, which belonged to the former house, still remains.  It is  well shaded by tall ash trees, of a species, as Mr. Janes the fossilist  informed me, uncommonly valuable.  This plantation is very properly  mentioned by Dr. Campbell, in his new account of the state of Britain,  and deserves attention; because it proves that the present nakedness of  the Hebrides is not wholly the fault of Nature.    As we sat at Sir Alexander's table, we were entertained, according to the  ancient usage of the North, with the melody of the bagpipe.  Everything  in those countries has its history.  As the bagpiper was playing, an  elderly Gentleman informed us, that in some remote time, the Macdonalds  of Glengary having been injured, or offended by the inhabitants of  Culloden, and resolving to have justice or vengeance, came to Culloden on  a Sunday, where finding their enemies at worship, they shut them up in  the church, which they set on fire; and this, said he, is the tune that  the piper played while they were burning.    Narrations like this, however uncertain, deserve the notice of the  traveller, because they are the only records of a nation that has no  historians, and afford the most genuine representation of the life and  character of the ancient Highlanders.    Under the denomination of Highlander are comprehended in Scotland all  that now speak the Erse language, or retain the primitive manners,  whether they live among the mountains or in the islands; and in that  sense I use the name, when there is not some apparent reason for making a  distinction.    In Sky I first observed the use of Brogues, a kind of artless shoes,  stitched with thongs so loosely, that though they defend the foot from  stones, they do not exclude water.  Brogues were formerly made of raw  hides, with the hair inwards, and such are perhaps still used in rude and  remote parts; but they are said not to last above two days.  Where life  is somewhat improved, they are now made of leather tanned with oak bark,  as in other places, or with the bark of birch, or roots of tormentil, a  substance recommended in defect of bark, about forty years ago, to the  Irish tanners, by one to whom the parliament of that kingdom voted a  reward.  The leather of Sky is not completely penetrated by vegetable  matter, and therefore cannot be very durable.    My inquiries about brogues, gave me an early specimen of Highland  information.  One day I was told, that to make brogues was a domestick  art, which every man practised for himself, and that a pair of brogues  was the work of an hour.  I supposed that the husband made brogues as the  wife made an apron, till next day it was told me, that a brogue-maker was  a trade, and that a pair would cost half a crown.  It will easily occur  that these representations may both be true, and that, in some places,  men may buy them, and in others, make them for themselves; but I had both  the accounts in the same house within two days.    Many of my subsequent inquiries upon more interesting topicks ended in  the like uncertainty.  He that travels in the Highlands may easily  saturate his soul with intelligence, if he will acquiesce in the first  account.  The Highlander gives to every question an answer so prompt and  peremptory, that skepticism itself is dared into silence, and the mind  sinks before the bold reporter in unresisting credulity; but, if a second  question be ventured, it breaks the enchantment; for it is immediately  discovered, that what was told so confidently was told at hazard, and  that such fearlessness of assertion was either the sport of negligence,  or the refuge of ignorance.    If individuals are thus at variance with themselves, it can be no wonder  that the accounts of different men are contradictory.  The traditions of  an ignorant and savage people have been for ages negligently heard, and  unskilfully related.  Distant events must have been mingled together, and  the actions of one man given to another.  These, however, are  deficiencies in story, for which no man is now to be censured.  It were  enough, if what there is yet opportunity of examining were accurately  inspected, and justly represented; but such is the laxity of Highland  conversation, that the inquirer is kept in continual suspense, and by a  kind of intellectual retrogradation, knows less as he hears more.    In the islands the plaid is rarely worn.  The law by which the  Highlanders have been obliged to change the form of their dress, has, in  all the places that we have visited, been universally obeyed.  I have  seen only one gentleman completely clothed in the ancient habit, and by  him it was worn only occasionally and wantonly.  The common people do not  think themselves under any legal necessity of having coats; for they say  that the law against plaids was made by Lord Hardwicke, and was in force  only for his life: but the same poverty that made it then difficult for  them to change their clothing, hinders them now from changing it again.    The fillibeg, or lower garment, is still very common, and the bonnet  almost universal; but their attire is such as produces, in a sufficient  degree, the effect intended by the law, of abolishing the dissimilitude  of appearance between the Highlanders and the other inhabitants of  Britain; and, if dress be supposed to have much influence, facilitates  their coalition with their fellow-subjects.    What we have long used we naturally like, and therefore the Highlanders  were unwilling to lay aside their plaid, which yet to an unprejudiced  spectator must appear an incommodious and cumbersome dress; for hanging  loose upon the body, it must flutter in a quick motion, or require one of  the hands to keep it close.  The Romans always laid aside the gown when  they had anything to do.  It was a dress so unsuitable to war, that the  same word which signified a gown signified peace.  The chief use of a  plaid seems to be this, that they could commodiously wrap themselves in  it, when they were obliged to sleep without a better cover.    In our passage from Scotland to Sky, we were wet for the first time with  a shower.  This was the beginning of the Highland winter, after which we  were told that a succession of three dry days was not to be expected for  many months.  The winter of the Hebrides consists of little more than  rain and wind.  As they are surrounded by an ocean never frozen, the  blasts that come to them over the water are too much softened to have the  power of congelation.  The salt loughs, or inlets of the sea, which shoot  very far into the island, never have any ice upon them, and the pools of  fresh water will never bear the walker.  The snow that sometimes falls,  is soon dissolved by the air, or the rain.    This is not the description of a cruel climate, yet the dark months are  here a time of great distress; because the summer can do little more than  feed itself, and winter comes with its cold and its scarcity upon  families very slenderly provided.          CORIATACHAN IN SKY      The third or fourth day after our arrival at Armidel, brought us an  invitation to the isle of Raasay, which lies east of Sky.  It is  incredible how soon the account of any event is propagated in these  narrow countries by the love of talk, which much leisure produces, and  the relief given to the mind in the penury of insular conversation by a  new topick.  The arrival of strangers at a place so rarely visited,  excites rumour, and quickens curiosity.  I know not whether we touched at  any corner, where Fame had not already prepared us a reception.    To gain a commodious passage to Raasay, it was necessary to pass over a  large part of Sky.  We were furnished therefore with horses and a guide.  In the Islands there are no roads, nor any marks by which a stranger may  find his way.  The horseman has always at his side a native of the place,  who, by pursuing game, or tending cattle, or being often employed in  messages or conduct, has learned where the ridge of the hill has breadth  sufficient to allow a horse and his rider a passage, and where the moss  or bog is hard enough to bear them.  The bogs are avoided as toilsome at  least, if not unsafe, and therefore the journey is made generally from  precipice to precipice; from which if the eye ventures to look down, it  sees below a gloomy cavity, whence the rush of water is sometimes heard.    But there seems to be in all this more alarm than danger.  The Highlander  walks carefully before, and the horse, accustomed to the ground, follows  him with little deviation.  Sometimes the hill is too steep for the  horseman to keep his seat, and sometimes the moss is too tremulous to  bear the double weight of horse and man.  The rider then dismounts, and  all shift as they can.    Journies made in this manner are rather tedious than long.  A very few  miles require several hours.  From Armidel we came at night to  Coriatachan, a house very pleasantly situated between two brooks, with  one of the highest hills of the island behind it.  It is the residence of  Mr. Mackinnon, by whom we were treated with very liberal hospitality,  among a"]]]
