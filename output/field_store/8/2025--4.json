Fuel is usually abundant with the farmer; and where  so, its benefits are much better dispensed in open stoves or fireplaces,  than in heating furnaces or \"air-tights.\"    We have slightly discussed this subject of firing in the farm house,  in a previous page, but while in the vein, must crave another word.  A farmer's house should _look_ hospitable as well as _be_ hospitable,  both outside and in; and the broadest, most cheerful look of hospitality  within doors, in cold weather, is an _open_ fire in the chimney  fireplace, with the blazing wood upon it. There is no _mistake_ about  it. It thaws you out, if cold; it stirs you up, if drooping; and is the  welcome, winning introduction to the good cheer that is to follow.    A short time ago we went to pay a former town friend a visit. He had  removed out to a snug little farm, where he could indulge his  agricultural and horticultural tastes, yet still attend to his town  engagements, and enjoy the quietude of the country. We rang the door  bell. A servant admitted us; and leaving overcoat and hat in the hall,  we entered a lone room, with an \"air-tight\" stove, looking as black and  solemn as a Turkish eunuch upon us, and giving out about the same degree  of genial warmth as the said eunuch would have expressed had he been  there--an emasculated warming machine truly! On the floor was a Wilton  carpet, too fine to stand on; around the room were mahogany sofas and  mahogany chairs, all too fine to sit on--at all events to _rest_ one  upon if he were fatigued. The blessed light of day was shut out by  crimson and white curtains, held up by gilded arrows; and upon the  mantle piece, and on the center and side tables were all sorts of  gimcracks, costly and worthless. In short, there was no _comfort_ about  the whole concern. Hearing our friend coming up from his dining-room  below, where too, was his _cellar kitchen_--that most abominable of all  appendages to a farm house, or to any other country house, for that  matter--we buttoned our coat up close and high, thrust our hands into  our pockets, and walked the room, as he entered. \"Glad to see you--glad  to see you, my friend!\" said he, in great joy; \"but dear me, why so  buttoned up, as if you were going? What's the matter?\" \"My good sir,\" we  replied, \"you asked us to come over and see you, 'a _plain farmer_,' and  'take a quiet family dinner with you.' We have done so; and here find  you with all your town nonsense about you. No fire to warm by; no seat  to rest in; no nothing like a farm or farmer about you; and it only  needs your charming better half, whom we always admired, when she lived  in town, to take down her enameled harp, and play      'In fairy bowers by moonlight hours,'    to convince one that instead of ruralizing in the country, you had gone  a peg higher in town residence! No, no, we'll go down to farmer  Jocelyn's, our old schoolfellow, and take a dinner of bacon and cabbage  with him. If he does occupy a one-story house, he lives up in sunshine,  has an open fireplace, with a blazing wood fire on a chilly day, and his  'latch string is always out.'\"    Our friend was petrified--astonished! We meant to go it rather strong  upon him, but still kept a frank, good-humored face, that showed him no  malice. He began to think he was not exactly in character, and essayed  to explain. We listened to his story. His good wife came in, and all  together, we had a long talk of their family and farming arrangements;  how they had furnished their house; and how they proposed to live; but  wound up with a sad story, that their good farming neighbors didn't call  on them the _second_ time--kind, civil people they appeared, too--and  while they were in, acted as though afraid to sit down, and afraid to  stand up;--in short, they were dreadfully embarrassed; for why, our  friends couldn't tell, but now began to understand it. \"Well, my good  friends,\" said we, \"you have altogether mistaken country life in the  outset. To live on a farm, it is neither necessary to be vulgar, nor  clownish, nor to affect ignorance. _Simplicity_ is all you require, in  manners, and equal simplicity in your furniture and appointments. Now  just turn all this nonsense in furniture and room dressing out of doors,  and let some of your town friends have it. Get some simple, comfortable,  cottage furniture, much better for all purposes, than this, and you will  settle down into quiet, natural country life before you are aware of it,  and all will go 'merry as a marriage bell' with you, in a little  time\"--for they both loved the country, and were truly excellent people.  We continued, \"I came to spend the day and the night, and I will stay;  and this evening we'll go down to your neighbor Jocelyn's; and you, Mrs.  N----, shall go with us; and we will see how quietly and comfortably he  and his family take the world in a farmer's way.\"    We did go; not in carriage and livery, but walked the pleasant half mile  that lay between them; the exercise of which gave us all activity and  good spirits. Jocelyn was right glad to see us, and Patty, his staid and  sober wife, with whom we had romped many an innocent hour in our  childhood days, was quite as glad as he. But they _looked_ a little  surprised that such \"great folks\" as their new neighbors, should drop in  so unceremoniously, and into their common \"keeping room,\" too, to chat  away an evening. However, the embarrassment soon wore off. We talked of  farming; we talked of the late elections; we talked of the fruit trees  and the strawberry beds; and Mrs. Jocelyn, who was a pattern of good  housekeeping, told Mrs. N---- how _she_ made her apple jellies, and her  currant tarts, and cream cheeses; and before we left they had exchanged  ever so many engagements,--Mrs. Patty to learn her new friend to do half  a dozen nice little matters of household pickling and preserving; while  she, in turn, was to teach Nancy and Fanny, Patty's two rosy-cheeked  daughters, almost as pretty as their mother was at their own age, to  knit a bead bag and work a fancy chair seat! And then we had apples and  nuts, all of the very best--for Jocelyn was a rare hand at grafting and  managing his fruit trees, and knew the best apples all over the country.  We had, indeed, a capital time! To cut the story short, the next spring  our friend sent his _fancy_ furniture to auction, and provided his house  with simple cottage furnishings, at less than half the cost of the  other; which both he and his wife afterward declared was infinitely  better, for all house-keeping purposes. He also threw a neat wing on to  the cottage, for an upper kitchen and its offices, and they now live  like sensible country folks; and with their healthy, frolicksome  children, are worth the envy of all the dyspeptic, town-fed people in  existence.    A long digression, truly; but so true a story, and one so apt to our  subject can not well be omitted. But what has all this to do with  ventilation? We'll tell you. Jocelyn's house was _ventilated_ as it  should be;--for he was a methodical, thoughtful man, who planned and  built his house himself--not the mechanical work, but directed it  throughout, and saw that it was faithfully done; and that put us in mind  of the story.    To be perfect in its ventilation, every room in the house, even to the  closets, should be so arranged that a current of air _may_ pass through,  to keep it pure and dry. In living rooms, fresh air in sufficient  quantity may usually be admitted through the doors. In sleeping rooms  and closets, when doors may not be left open, one or more of the lower  panels of the door may be filled by a rolling blind, opening more or  less, at pleasure; or a square or oblong opening for that purpose, may  be left in the base board, at the floor, and covered by a wire netting.  And in all rooms, living apartments, as well as these, an opening of at  least sixty-four square inches should be made in the wall, near the  ceiling, and leading into an air flue, to pass into the garret. Such  opening may be filled by a rolling blind, or wire screen, as below, and  closed or kept open, at pleasure. Some builders prefer an air register  to be placed in the chimney, over the fireplace or stove, near the  ceiling; but the liability to annoyance, by smoke escaping through it  into the room, if not thoroughly done, is an objection to this latter  method, and the other may be made, in its construction, rather  ornamental than otherwise, in appearance. All such details as these  should be planned when the building is commenced, so that the several  flues may be provided as the building proceeds. In a stone or brick  house, a small space may be left in the walls, against which these air  registers may be required; and for inner rooms, or closets, they may  pass off into the openings of the partitions, and so up into the garret;  from which apertures of escape may be left, or made at the gables, under  the roof, or by a blind in a window.    For the admission of air to the first floor of the house, a special  opening through the walls, for that purpose, can hardly be necessary;  as the doors leading outside are usually opened often enough for such  object. One of the best ventilated houses we have ever seen, is that  owned and occupied by Samuel Cloon, Esq., of Cincinnati. It is situated  on his farm, three miles out of the city, and in its fine architectural  appearance and finished appointments, as a rural residence and  first-class farm house, is not often excelled. Every closet is  ventilated through rolling blinds in the door panels; and foul air,  either admitted or created within them, is passed off at once by flues  near the ceiling overhead, passing into conductors leading off through  the garret.    Where chambers are carried into the roof of a house, to any extent, they  are sometimes incommoded by the summer heat which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/200"],[0,"The Project Gutenberg Encyclopedia, Volume 1 of 28 (#10)"],[1,"house of Castillo,  from whom by marriage it fell in 1272 to Edward I., king of  England.  French and English were its masters by turns till  1435 when, by the treaty of Arras, it was ceded to the duke of  Burgundy.  In 1477 it was annexed by Louis XI., king of France,  and was held by two illegitimate branches of the royal family in  the 16th and 17th centuries, being in 1696 reunited to the crown.    ABBEY, EDWIN AUSTIN (1852- ), American painter, was born at  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the 1st of April 1852.  He left  the schools of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts at the  age of nineteen to enter the art department of the publishing  house of Harper & Brothers in New York, where, in company  with such men as Howard Pyle, Charles Stanley Reinhart, Joseph  Pennell and Alfred Parsons, he became very successful as an  illustrator.  In 1878 he was sent by the Harpers to England  to gather material for illustrations of the poems of Robert  Herrick.  These, published in 1882, attracted much attention,  and were followed by illustrations for Goldsmith's She  Stoops to Conquer (1887), for a volume of Old Songs  (1889), and for the comedies (and a few of the tragedies) of  Shakespeare.  His water-colours and pastels were no less  successful than the earlier illustrations in pen and ink.  Abbey now became closely identified with the art life of  England, and was elected to the Royal Institute of Painters  in Water-Colours in 1883.  Among his water-colours are ``The  Evil Eye'' (1877); ``The Rose in October'' (1879); ``An Old  Song'' (1886); ``The Visitors'' (1890), and ``The Jongleur''  (1892).  Possibly his best known pastels are ``Beatrice,''  ``Phyllis,'' and ``Two Noble Kinsmen.'' In 1890 he made his  first appearance with an oil painting, ``A May Day Morn,'' at  the Royal Academy in London.  He exhibited ``Richard duke of  Gloucester and the Lady Anne'' at the Royal Academy in 1896,  and in that year was elected A.R.A., becoming a full R.A. in  1898.  Apart from his other paintings, special mention must  be made of the large frescoes entitled ``The Quest of the Holy  Grail,'' in the Boston Public Library, on which he was occupied  for some years; and in 1901 he was commissioned by King Edward  VII. to paint a picture of the coronation, containing many  portraits elaborately grouped.  The dramatic subjects, and the  brilliant colouring of his on pictures, gave them pronounced  individuality among the works of contemporary painters.  Abbey became a member not only of the Royal Academy, but also  of the National Academy of Design of New York, and honorary  member of the Royal Bavarian Society, the Societe Nationale  des Beaux Arts (Paris), the American Water-Colour Society,  etc.  He received first class gold medals at the International  Art Exhibition of Vienna in 1898, at Philadelphia in 1898,  at the Paris Exhibitions of 1889 and 1900, and at Berlin in  1903; and was made a chevalier of the French Legion of Honour.    ABBEY (Lat. abbatia; from Syr. abba, father), a  monastery, or conventual establishment, under the government  of an ABBOT or an ABBESS. A priory only differed from  an abbey in that the superior bore the name of prior instead  of abbot. This was the case in all the English conventual  cathedrals, e.g. Canterbury, Ely, Norwich, &c., where the  archbishop or bishop occupied the abbot's place, the superior  of the monastery being termed prior.  Other priories were  originally offshoots from the larger abbeys, to the abbots  of which they continued subordinate; but in later times the  actual distinction between abbeys and priories was lost.    The earliest Christian monastic communities (see MONASTICISM)  with which we are acquainted consisted of groups of cells or  huts collected about a common centre, which was usually the abode  of some anchorite celebrated for superior holiness or singular  asceticism, but without any attempt at orderly arrangement.  The formation of such communities in the East does not date  from the introduction of Christianity.  The example had been  already set by the Essenes in Judea and the Therapeutae in Egypt.    In the earliest age of Christian monasticism the ascetics  were accustomed to live singly, independent of one another,  at no great distance from some village, supporting themselves  by the labour of their own hands, and distributing the  surplus after the supply of their own scanty wants to the  poor.  Increasing religious fervour, aided by persecution,  drove them farther and farther away from the abodes of men  into mountain solitudes or lonely deserts.  The deserts  of Egypt swarmed with the ``cells'' or huts of these  anchorites.  Anthony, who had retired to the Egyptian Thebaid  during the persecution of Maximin, A.D. 312, was the most  celebrated among them for his austerities, his sanctity, and  his power as an exorcist.  His fame collected round him a  host of followers, emulous of his sanctity.  The deeper he  withdrew into the wilderness, the more numerous his disciples  became.  They refused to be separated from him, and built  their ceils round that of their spiritual father.  Thus arose  the first monastic community, consisting of anchorites living  each in his own little dwelling, united together under one  superior.  Anthony, as Neander remarks (Church History,  vol. iii. p. 316, Clark's trans.), ``without any conscious  design of his own, had become the founder of a new mode  of living in common, Coenobitism.'' By degrees order was  introduced in the groups of huts.  They were arranged in  lines like the tents in an encampment, or the houses in a  street.  From this arrangement these lines of single cells  came to be known as Laurae, Laurai, \"streets\" or \"lanes.\"    The real founder of coenobian koinos, common, and bios,  life) monasteries in the modern sense was Pachomius, an Egyptian  of the beginning of the 4th century.  The first community  established by him was at Tabennae, an island of the Nile in Upper  Egypt.  Eight others were founded in his lifetime, numbering 3000  monks.  Within fifty years from his death his societies could  reckon 50,000 members.  These coenobia resembled vilIages,  peopled by a hard-working religious community, ail of one  sex.  The buildings were detached, small and of the humblest  character.  Each cell or hut, according to Sozomen (H.R. iii.  14), contained three monks.  They took their chief meal in a  common refectory at 3 P.M., up to which hour they usually  fasted.  They ate in silence, with hoods so drawn over their  faces that they could see nothing but what was on the table  before them.  The monks spent all the time, not devoted to  religious services or study, in manual labour.  Palladius,  who visited the Egyptian monasteries about the close of the  4th century, found among the 300 members of the coenobium of  Panopolis, under the Pachomian rule, 15 tailors, 7 smiths, 4  carpenters, 12 cameldrivers and 15 tanners.  Each separate  community had its own oeconomus or steward, who was subject  to a chief oeconomus stationed at the head establishment.  All the produce of the monks' labour was committed to him, and  by him shipped to Alexandria.  The money raised by the sale  was expended in the purchase of stores for the support of the  communities, and what was over was devoted to charity.  Twice  in the year the superiors of the several coenobia met at  the chief monastery, under the presidency of an archimandrite  (``the chief of the fold,'' from miandra, a fold), and at  the last meeting gave in reports of their administration for the  year.  The coenobia of Syria belonged to the Pachomian  institution.  We learn many details concerning those in the  vicinity of Antioch from Chrysostom's writings.  The monks  lived in separate huts, kalbbia, forming a religious hamlet  on the mountain side.  They were subject to an abbot, and  observed a common rule. (They had no refectory, but ate their  common meal, of bread and water only, when the day's labour  was over, reclining on strewn grass, sometimes out of doors,)  Four times in the day they joined in prayers and psalms.    Santa Laura, Mount Athos.    The necessity for defence from hostile attacks, economy of  space and convenience of access from one part of the community  to another, by degrees dictated a more compact and orderly  arrangement of the buildings of a monastic coenobium.  Large  piles of building were erected, with strong outside walls,  capable of resisting the assaults of an enemy, within which  all the necessary edifices were ranged round one or more  open courts, usually surrounded with cloisters.  The usual  Eastern arrangement is exemplified in the plan of the convent  of Santa Laura, Mount Athos (Laura, the designation of a  monastery generally, being converted into a female saint).    This monastery, like the oriental monasteries generally, is  surrounded by a strong and lofty blank stone wall, enclosing  an area of between 3 and 4 acres.  The longer side extends to  a length of about 500 feet.  There is only one main entrance,  on the north side (A), defended by three separate iron  doors.  Near the entrance is a large tower (M), a constant  feature in the monasteries of the Levant.  There is a small  postern gate at L. The enceinte comprises two large open  courts, surrounded with buildings connected with cloister  galleries of wood or stone.  The outer court, which is much the  larger, contains the granaries and storehouses (K), and the  kitchen (H) and other offices connected with the refectory  (G). Immediately adjacent to the gateway is a two-storied  guest-house, opening from a cloister (C). The inner court is  surrounded by a cloister (EE), from which open the monks' cells  (II).  In the centre of this court stands the catholicon  or conventual church, a square building with an apse of  the cruciform domical Byzantine type, approached by a domed  narthex.  In front of the church stands a marble fountain  (F),"]]]
