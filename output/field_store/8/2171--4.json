Sec. 33.  To make a side Weld.    This is by no means difficult, but is easier with lead glass than with  soda glass.  The tube to which it is desired to make a side connection  having been selected, it is closed at one end by rubber tube stops, or  in any other suitable manner.  The zone of the proposed connection is  noted, and the tube is brought to near softness round that circle (if  the tube is made actually soft, inconvenience will arise from the  bending, which is sure to occur).  Two courses are then open to the  operator, one suitable to a thick tube, the other to a tube of  moderate thickness.    Taking the former first.  Provide a piece of glass rod and warm its  end.  Direct a small flame against the spot on the thick tube where  the proposed joint is to be.  When the glass becomes almost  incandescent at this spot, put the end of the rod against it and draw  out a thread of glass till sufficient \"metal\" has been removed.  Then  fuse off the thread close to the tube.    Fig.  27.    The subsequent procedure is the same as for thin tubes.  In this case  heat the spot by the smallest flame available, and get the spot very  hot.  Blow it out gently into a bubble, perhaps extending to a height  equal to its diameter.  Then heat the top of the bubble till it is  incandescent and blow violently.  This will produce an opening fringed  by glass so thin as to exhibit interference colours.  Remove the filmy  part, and heat the frayed edges till they cohere and form an incipient  tube.  If the flame has been of a correct size, the tube will now be  of the same diameter as the tube to be welded on, and will project  perhaps one-sixteenth of an inch from the surface of the main tube  (Fig.  28).    Fig. 28.    Fig.  29.    When this stage is reached, again heat the tube all round till it  nearly softens, and by means of the other hand heat the end of the  other tube which it is proposed to weld.  Just before the main tube  actually softens, turn it so as to heat the edges of the aperture, and  at the same time get the end of the side tube very hot.  Take both out  of the flame for an instant, and press the parts together, instantly  slightly withdrawing the side tube.  If the operation is well  performed, it will be found that the point of maximum thickness of  glass is now clear of the main tube.  The joint is then to be heated  all round and blown out--a rather awkward operation, and one  requiring some practice, but it can be done.    Fig.  30.    If great strength is wanted, heat the main tube all round the joint  bit by bit, and blow each section slightly outwards.  If the operator  is confident in his skill, he should then heat the whole joint to the  softening point, blow it out slightly, and then adjust by pulling and  pushing.  Cool first in the gas flame, and then plunge the joint into  the asbestos and cover it up--or if too large, throw the asbestos  cloth round it.    In the case of soda glass this final \"general heat\" is almost  essential, but it is not so with flint glass, and as the general heat  is the most difficult part of the job, it will be found easier to use  lead glass and omit the general heating.  With soda glass a very small  irregularity will cause the joint to break when cold, but flint glass  is much more long-suffering.  It is easy to perform the above  operation on small tubes.  For large ones it will be found best to  employ flint glass and use the clip stands as in the case of direct  welds, treated above, but, of course, with suitable modifications.  Never let the main tube cool after the hole is made until the work is  done.    Sec. 34.  Inserted Joints.    In many instances the performance of apparatus is much improved by  joints of this kind, even when their use is not absolutely essential.    There are two ways in which inserted joints may be made.  The first  method is the easier, and works well with flint glass; but when one  comes to apply it to soda glass there is a danger of the glass  becoming too thick near the joint, and this often leads to a cracking  of the joint as the glass cools.    Fig.  31.    Suppose it is desired to insert the tube B into the tube A (Fig.  31).  Begin by reducing the size of the end of tube A till B will just slip  in quite easily.  With B about one-quarter inch in diameter, a  clearance of about one-twentieth of an inch, or less, in all (i.e.  one-fortieth of an inch on each side) will be proper.    Heat B by itself at the proposed zone of junction, and blow out a very  narrow ring;  then compress this slightly so that it forms an almost  closed ring of glass.  The figure refers to the close of this  operation (Fig.  31, B).  It does not matter much whether the ring  remains a mere flattened bulb, or whether it is a solid ring, but it  must be one or the other.  Some judgment must be exercised in  preparing the ring.  In general, the beginner will collect too much  glass in the ring, and consequently the joint, when made, will either  be thick and liable to crack easily, or it will be blown out into an  erratic shape in endeavours to reduce this thickness.  Accordingly,  the operator will, if necessary, thin the tube B by drawing slightly,  if he considers it desirable, before the little enlargement is blown  out.  In general, two heats must be used for this operation.    Fig.  32.    Get the approximating parts of both A and B up to a temperature just  below that at which they will adhere, and having closed the other end  of A, place B carefully within it up to the ring, and if it can be  arranged, have a mica wad in A, with a central hole through which the  end of B can project.  This will very much facilitate the operation,  especially if B is long, but may be dispensed with by the exercise of  care and skill.    The operation is now simple.  Fuse the junction and press the tubes  lightly together, being careful not to collect more glass than can be  helped;  finally, blow out the joint and reduce the thickness by mild  drawing (Fig.  33).  In order to make a really good joint, two points  must be particularly attended to--the rim must be thin and its plane  perfectly perpendicular to the axis of tube B;  the end of tube A must  be cut off quite clean and perpendicular to its axis before B is  inserted.  So important are these conditions--especially the latter  that the writer has even occasionally used the grindstone to get the  end of A into a proper condition, an admission which will probably  earn the contempt of the expert glass-worker.    Fig. 33.    Now for the second method, which is often practised in Germany, where  soda glass is chiefly used.  With this glass the chief point is to get  a very even and not too thick ring at the junction, and consequently  the extra thickening produced by making a rim on B is rather a  drawback.  The method consists in cutting off from B the length which  it is desired to insert, slipping this into A (which may be an  otherwise closed bulb, for instance), and then gradually melting up  the open end of A till the piece of B inside will no longer fall out.  By holding the joint downwards so that the inserted portion of B rests  on the edges of the opening, a joint may be made with the minimum  thickening.    The external part of B, previously heated, is then applied, and the  joint subjected to a \"general\" heat and blown out.  Very nice joints  may be made by this method, and it is perhaps the better one where the  external part of B is to be less in diameter than the inserted part.  It was in this manner that the writer was taught to make glass  velocity pumps, one of which, of a good design, is figured as an  example.    In all cases good annealing should follow this operation.  If the  inserted part of the inner tube (B) is anything like an inch in  diameter, and especially if it is of any length, as in some forms of  ozone apparatus, or in a large Bunsen's ice calorimeter, the  arrangements for supporting the inner part must be very good.  A  convenient way of proceeding when the inner tube is well supported is  to make the mouth of A only very little larger than the diameter of B,  so that B will only just slip in.  Then the mouth of A and the zone of  B may be heated together, and B blown out upon A.  This, of course,  must be arranged for, if necessary, by temporarily stopping the inner  end of B.    The inner support of B should be removed as soon as practicable after  the joint is made, or, at all events, should not be perfectly rigid; a  tightly-fitting cork, for instance, is too rigid.  The reason is, of  course, that in cooling there may be a tendency to set B a little to  one side or the other, and if it is not free to take such a set, the  joint most probably will give way.  Good annealing both with flame and  asbestos is a sine qua non in all inserted work.    Fig. 34.    Sec. 35.  Bending Tubes.    I have hitherto said nothing about bending tubes, for to bend a tube  of a quarter of an inch in diameter, and of ordinary thickness, is  about the first thing one learns in any laboratory, while to bend  large tubes nicely is as difficult an operation as the practice of  glass-blowing affords.  However, even in bending a narrow tube it is  possible to proceed in the wrong way.  The wrong way is to heat a  short length of the tube and then bend it rapidly, holding the plane  of the bend horizontal.  The right way, per contra, is to use a  batswing burner to heat, say, two inches of the tube with constant  turning till it is very soft, and then, holding the glass so that the  bend will be in a vertical plane passing through one eye (the other  being shut), to make the bend rather slowly.
