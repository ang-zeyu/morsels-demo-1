To whom, then? The vision of Joan  Valentine came to her--of Joan as she had seen her yesterday,  strong, cheerful, self-reliant, bearing herself, in spite of  adversity, with a valiant jauntiness. Yes; she would go and see  Joan. She put on her hat and stole from the house.    Curiously enough, only a quarter of an hour before, R. Jones had  set out with exactly the same object in view.                            *   *   *    At almost exactly the hour when Aline Peters set off to visit her  friend, Miss Valentine, three men sat in the cozy smoking-room of  Blandings Castle.    They were variously occupied. In the big chair nearest the door  the Honorable Frederick Threepwood--Freddie to pals--was reading.  Next to him sat a young man whose eyes, glittering through  rimless spectacles, were concentrated on the upturned faces of  several neat rows of playing cards--Rupert Baxter, Lord  Emsworth's invaluable secretary, had no vices, but he sometimes  relaxed his busy brain with a game of solitaire. Beyond Baxter, a  cigar in his mouth and a weak highball at his side, the Earl of  Emsworth took his ease.    The book the Honorable Freddie was reading was a small  paper-covered book. Its cover was decorated with a color scheme  in red, black and yellow, depicting a tense moment in the lives  of a man with a black beard, a man with a yellow beard, a man  without any beard at all, and a young woman who, at first sight,  appeared to be all eyes and hair. The man with the black beard,  to gain some private end, had tied this young woman with ropes to  a complicated system of machinery, mostly wheels and pulleys. The  man with the yellow beard was in the act of pushing or pulling a  lever. The beardless man, protruding through a trapdoor in the  floor, was pointing a large revolver at the parties of the second  part.    Beneath this picture were the words: \"Hands up, you scoundrels!\"    Above it, in a meandering scroll across the page, was: \"Gridley  Quayle, Investigator. The Adventure of the Secret Six. By Felix  Clovelly.\"    The Honorable Freddie did not so much read as gulp the adventure  of the Secret Six. His face was crimson with excitement; his hair  was rumpled; his eyes bulged. He was absorbed.    This is peculiarly an age in which each of us may, if we do but  search diligently, find the literature suited to his mental  powers. Grave and earnest men, at Eton and elsewhere, had tried  Freddie Threepwood with Greek, with Latin and with English; and  the sheeplike stolidity with which he declined to be interested  in the masterpieces of all three tongues had left them with the  conviction that he would never read anything.    And then, years afterward, he had suddenly blossomed out as a  student--only, it is true, a student of the Adventures of Gridley  Quayle; but still a student. His was a dull life and Gridley  Quayle was the only person who brought romance into it. Existence  for the Honorable Freddie was simply a sort of desert, punctuated  with monthly oases in the shape of new Quayle adventures. It was  his ambition to meet the man who wrote them.    Lord Emsworth sat and smoked, and sipped and smoked again, at  peace with all the world. His mind was as nearly a blank as it is  possible for the human mind to be. The hand that had not the task  of holding the cigar was at rest in his trousers pocket. The  fingers of it fumbled idly with a small, hard object.    Gradually it filtered into his lordship's mind that this small,  hard object was not familiar. It was something new--something  that was neither his keys nor his pencil; nor was it his small  change. He yielded to a growing curiosity and drew it out. He  examined it. It was a little something, rather like a fossilized  beetle. It touched no chord in him. He looked at it with amiable  distaste.    \"Now how in the world did that get there?\" he said.    The Honorable Freddie paid no attention to the remark. He was now  at the very crest of his story, when every line intensified the  thrill. Incident was succeeding incident. The Secret Six were  here, there and everywhere, like so many malignant June bugs.    Annabel, the heroine, was having a perfectly rotten  time--kidnapped, and imprisoned every few minutes. Gridley  Quayle, hot on the scent, was covering somebody or other with his  revolver almost continuously. Freddie Threepwood had no time for  chatting with his father. Not so Rupert Baxter. Chatting with  Lord Emsworth was one of the things for which he received his  salary. He looked up from his cards.    \"Lord Emsworth?\"    \"I have found a curious object in my pocket, Baxter. I was  wondering how it got there.\"    He handed the thing to his secretary. Rupert Baxter's eyes lit up  with sudden enthusiasm. He gasped.    \"Magnificent!\" he cried. \"Superb!\"    Lord Emsworth looked at him inquiringly.    \"It is a scarab, Lord Emsworth; and unless I am mistaken--and I  think I may claim to be something of an expert--a Cheops of the  Fourth Dynasty. A wonderful addition to your museum!\"    \"Is it? By Gad! You don't say so, Baxter!\"    \"It is, indeed. If it is not a rude question, how much did you  give for it, Lord Emsworth? It must have been the gem of  somebody's collection. Was there a sale at Christie's this  afternoon?\"    Lord Emsworth shook his head. \"I did not get it at Christie's,  for I recollect that I had an important engagement which  prevented my going to Christie's. To be sure; yes--I had promised  to call on Mr. Peters and examine his collection of--Now I wonder  what it was that Mr. Peters said he collected!\"    \"Mr. Peters is one of the best-known living collectors of  scarabs.\"    \"Scarabs! You are quite right, Baxter. Now that I recall the  episode, this is a scarab; and Mr. Peters gave it to me.\"    \"Gave it to you, Lord Emsworth?\"    \"Yes. The whole scene comes back to me. Mr. Peters, after telling  me a great many exceedingly interesting things about scarabs,  which I regret to say I cannot remember, gave me this. And you  say it is really valuable, Baxter?\"    \"It is, from a collector's point of view, of extraordinary  value.\"    \"Bless my soul!\" Lord Emsworth beamed. \"This is extremely  interesting, Baxter. One has heard so much of the princely  hospitality of Americans. How exceedingly kind of Mr. Peters! I  shall certainly treasure it, though I must confess that from a  purely spectacular standpoint it leaves me a little cold.  However, I must not look a gift horse in the mouth--eh, Baxter?\"    From afar came the silver booming of a gong. Lord Emsworth rose.    \"Time to dress for dinner? I had no idea it was so late. Baxter,  you will be going past the museum door. Will you be a good fellow  and place this among the exhibits? You will know what to do with  it better than I. I always think of you as the curator of my  little collection, Baxter--ha-ha! Mind how you step when you are  in the museum. I was painting a chair there yesterday and I think  I left the paint pot on the floor.\"    He cast a less amiable glance at his studious son.    \"Get up, Frederick, and go and dress for dinner. What is that  trash you are reading?\"    The Honorable Freddie came out of his book much as a sleepwalker  wakes--with a sense of having been violently assaulted. He looked  up with a kind of stunned plaintiveness.    \"Eh, gov'nor?\"    \"Make haste! Beach rang the gong five minutes ago. What is that  you are reading?\"    \"Oh, nothing, gov'nor--just a book.\"    \"I wonder you can waste your time on such trash. Make haste!\"    He turned to the door, and the benevolent expression once more  wandered athwart his face.    \"Extremely kind of Mr. Peters!\" he said. \"Really, there is  something almost Oriental in the lavish generosity of our  American cousins.\"                            *   *   *    It had taken R. Jones just six hours to discover Joan Valentine's  address. That it had not taken him longer is a proof of his  energy and of the excellence of his system of obtaining  information; but R. Jones, when he considered it worth his while,  could be extremely energetic, and he was a past master at the art  of finding out things.    He poured himself out of his cab and rang the bell of Number  Seven. A disheveled maid answered the ring.    \"Miss Valentine in?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    R. Jones produced his card.    \"On important business, tell her. Half a minute--I'll write it.\"    He wrote the words on the card and devoted the brief period of  waiting to a careful scrutiny of his surroundings. He looked out  into the court and he looked as far as he could down the dingy  passage; and the conclusions he drew from what he saw were  complimentary to Miss Valentine.    \"If this girl is the sort of girl who would hold up Freddie's  letters,\" he mused, \"she wouldn't be living in a place like this.  If she were on the make she would have more money than she  evidently possesses. Therefore, she is not on the make; and I am  prepared to bet that she destroyed the letters as fast as she got  them.\"    Those were, roughly, the thoughts of R. Jones as he stood in the  doorway of Number Seven; and they were important thoughts  inasmuch as they determined his attitude toward Joan in the  approaching interview. He perceived that this matter must be  handled delicately--that he must be very much the gentleman. It  would be a strain, but he must do it.    The maid returned and directed him to Joan's room with a brief  word and a sweeping gesture.    \"Eh?\" said R. Jones. \"First floor?\"    \"Front,\" said the maid.    R. Jones trudged laboriously up the short flight of stairs. It  was very dark on the stairs and he stumbled. Eventually, however,  light came to him through an open door. Looking in, he saw a girl  standing at the table. She had an air of expectation; so he  deduced that he had reached his journey's end.    \"Miss Valentine?\"    \"Please "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20426"],[0,"Form and Function: A Contribution to the History of Animal Morphology (#10)"],[1," have organs, and the classifications will not  necessarily coincide. Thus you can divide animals according to their  organs of digestion into two classes, those in which the alimentary  canal is a sac with one opening (zoophytes) and those in which the  canal has two openings,[55] a curious forestalment, in the rough, of  the modern division of Metazoa into Coelentera and Coelomata.    It is only by taking single organs that you can arrange animals into  long series, and you will have as many series as you take organs. Only  in this way can you form any _Echelle des etres_ or graded series; and  you can get even this kind of gradation only within each of the big  groups formed on a common plan of structure; you can never grade, for  example, from Invertebrates to Vertebrates through intermediate  forms[56] (which is perfectly true, in spite of Amphioxus and  Balanoglossus!).    In the _Regne Animal_ Cuvier restricts the application of the idea of  the _Echelle_ within even narrower limits, refusing to admit its  validity within the bounds of the vertebrate phylum, or even within  the vertebrate classes. This seems, however, to refer to a seriation  of whole organisms and not of organs, so that the possibility of a  seriation of organs within a class is not denied. Cuvier was, above  all, a positive spirit, and he looked askance at all speculation which  went beyond the facts. \"The pretended scale of beings,\" he wrote, \"is  only an erroneous application to the totality of creation of partial  observations, which have validity only when confined to the sphere  within which they were made.\"[57] This remark, which is after all only  just, perfectly expresses Cuvier's attitude to the transcendental  theories, and was probably a protest against the sweeping  generalisations of his colleague, Etienne Geoffroy St Hilaire.    A true classification should be based upon the comparison of all  organs, but all organs are not of equal value for classification, nor  are all the variations of each organ equally important. In estimating  the value of variations more stress should be laid on function than on  form, for only those variations are important which affect the mode of  functioning. These are the principles on which Cuvier bases the  classification of animals given in the _Lecons_, Article V., \"Division  des animaux d'apres l'ensemble de leur organisation.\" The scheme of  classification actually given in the _Lecons_ recalls curiously that  of Aristotle, for there is the same broad division into Vertebrates,  with red blood, and Invertebrates, almost all with white blood. Nine  classes altogether are distinguished--Mammals, Birds, Reptiles,  Fishes, Molluscs, Crustacea, Insects, Worms, Zoophytes (including  Echinoderms and Coelenterates).    A maturer theory and practice of classification is given in the _Regne  Animal_ of seventeen years later. Here the principle of the  subordination of characters (which seems to have been first explicitly  stated by the younger de Jussieu in his _Genera Plantarum_, 1789,[58])  is more clearly recognised. The properties or peculiarities of  structure which have the greatest number of relations of  incompatibility and coexistence, and therefore influence the whole in  the greatest degree, are the important or dominating characters, to  which the others must be subordinated in classification. These  dominant characters are also the most constant.[59] In deciding which  characters are the most important Cuvier makes use of his fundamental  classification of functions and organs into two main sets. \"The heart  and the organs of circulation are a kind of centre for the vegetative  functions, as the brain and the spinal cord are for the animal  functions.\"[60] These two organ-systems vary in harmony, and their  characters must form the basis for the delimitation of the great  groups. Judged by this standard there are four principal types of  form,[61] of which all the others are but modifications. These four  types are Vertebrates, Molluscs, Articulates, and Radiates. The first  three have bilateral, the last has radial symmetry. Vertebrates and  Molluscs have blood-vessels, but Articulates show a functional  transition from the blood-vessel to the tracheal system. Radiates  approach the homogeneity of plants; they appear to lack a distinct  nervous system and sense organs, and the lowest of them show only a  homogeneous pulp which is mobile and sensitive. All four classes are  principally distinguished from one another by the broad structural  relations of their neuromuscular system, of the organs of the animal  functions. Vertebrates have a spinal cord and brain, an internal  skeleton built on a definite plan, with an axis and appendages; in  Molluscs the muscles are attached to the skin and the shell, and the  nervous system consists of separate masses; Articulates have a hard  external skeleton and jointed limbs, and their nervous system consists  of two long ventral cords; Radiates have ill-defined nervous and  muscular systems, and in their lowest forms possess the animal  functions without the animal organs.    This well-rounded classification of animal forms is in a sense the  crown of Cuvier's work, for the principle of the subordination of  characters, in the interpretation which he gives to it, is a direct  application of his principle of functional correlation. Each of the  great groups is built upon one plan. The idea of the unity of plan has  become for Cuvier a commonplace of his thought, and it is tacitly  recognised in all his anatomical work. But he never takes it as a  hard-and-fast principle which must at all costs be imposed upon the  facts.    Cuvier has become known as the greatest champion of the fixity of  species, but it is not often recognised that his attitude to this  problem is at least as scientific as that of the evolutionists of his  own and later times. No doubt he became dogmatic in his rejection of  evolution-theory, but he was on sure ground in maintaining that the  evolutionists of his day went beyond their facts. He considered that  certain forms (species) have reproduced themselves from the origin of  things without exceeding the limits of variation. His definition of a  species was, \"the individuals descended from one another or from  common parents, together with those that resemble them as much as they  resemble one another.\"[62] \"These forms are neither produced nor do  they change of themselves; life presupposes their existence, for it  cannot arise save in organisations ready prepared for it.\"[63]    He based his rejection of all theories of descent upon the absence of  definite evidence for evolution. If species have gradually changed, he  argued, one ought to find traces of these gradual modifications.[64]  Palaeontology does not furnish such traces. Again, the limits of  variation, even under domestication, are narrow, and the most extreme  variation does not fundamentally alter the specific type. Thus the dog  has varied perhaps most of all, in size, in shape, in colour. \"But  throughout all these variations the relations of the bones remain the  same, and the form of the teeth never changes to an appreciable  extent; at most there are some individuals in which an additional  false molar develops on one side or the other.\"[65] This second  objection is the objection of the morphologist. It would be an  interesting study to compare Cuvier's views on variation with those of  Darwin, who was essentially a systematist.    Cuvier's first objection was of course determined to some extent by  the imperfection of the palaeontological knowledge of his time. But  even at the present day the objection has a certain force, for  although we have definite evidence of many serial transformations of  one species into another along a single line, for example, Neumayr's  _Paludina_ series, yet at any one geological level the species, the  lines of descent, are all distinct from one another.[66]    Cuvier recognised very clearly that there is a succession of forms in  time, and that on the whole the most primitive forms are the earliest  to appear. Mammals are later than reptiles, and fishes appear earlier  than either. As Deperet puts it, \"Cuvier not only demonstrated the  presence in the sedimentary strata of a series of terrestrial faunas  superimposed and distinct, but he was the first to express, and that  very clearly, the idea of the gradual increase in complexity of these  faunas from the oldest to the most recent\" (p. 10).    He did not believe that the fauna of one epoch was transformed into  the fauna of the next. He explained the disappearance of the one by  the hypothesis of sudden catastrophes, and the appearance of the next  by the hypothesis of immigration. He nowhere advanced the hypothesis  of successive new creations. \"For the rest, when I maintain that the  stony layers contain the bones of several genera and the earthy layers  those of several species which no longer exist, I do not mean that a  new creation has been necessary to produce the existing species, I  merely say that they did not exist in the same localities and must  have come thither from elsewhere.\"[67] It was left to d'Orbigny to  teach the doctrine of successive creations, of which he distinguished  twenty-seven (_Cours elementaire de palaeontologie stratigraphique_,  1849).    Cuvier, however, can hardly have believed that all species were  present at the beginning, since he does admit a progression of forms.  Probably he had no theory on the subject, for theories without facts  had little interest for him. At any rate it is a mistake to think that  Cuvier was a supporter of the theological doctrine of special  creation. His philosophy of Nature was mechanistic, and he dedicated  his _Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles_ to his friend Laplace. He  admitted the idea of evolution at least so far as to conceive of a  development of man from a savage to a civilised state."]]]
