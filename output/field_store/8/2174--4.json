There on the rocks the  beaks and claws of the bandits were red with the life of the hero. Torn  asunder were those matchless wings, and their records were scattered  unnoticed. In sun and in storm they lay till the killers themselves  were killed and their stronghold rifled. And none knew the fate of the  peerless Bird till deep in the dust and rubbish of that pirate-nest the  avenger found, among others of its kind, a silver ring, the sacred  badge of the High Homer, and read upon it the pregnant inscription:  \"ARNAUX, 2590 C.\"          BADLANDS BILLY    The Wolf that Won    I    THE HOWL BY NIGHT    Do you know the three calls of the hunting Wolf:--the long-drawn deep  howl, the muster, that tells of game discovered but too strong for the  finder to manage alone; and the higher ululation that ringing and  swelling is the cry of the pack on a hot scent; and the sharp bark  coupled with a short howl that, seeming least of all, is yet a gong of  doom, for this is the cry \"Close in\"--this is the finish?    We were riding the Badland Buttes, King and I, with a pack of various  hunting Dogs stringing behind or trotting alongside. The sun had gone  from the sky, and a blood-streak marked the spot where he died, away  over Sentinel Butte. The hills were dim, the valleys dark, when from  the nearest gloom there rolled a long-drawn cry that all men recognize  instinctively--melodious, yet with a tone in it that sends a shudder up  the spine, though now it has lost all menace for mankind. We listened  for a moment. It was the Wolf-hunter who broke silence: \"That's  Badlands Billy; ain't it a voice? He's out for his beef to-night.\"      II    ANCIENT DAYS    In pristine days the Buffalo herds were followed by bands of Wolves  that preyed on the sick, the weak, and the wounded. When the Buffalo  were exterminated the Wolves were hard put for support, but the Cattle  came and solved the question for them by taking the Buffaloes' place.  This caused the wolf-war. The ranchmen offered a bounty for each Wolf  killed, and every cowboy out of work, was supplied with traps and  poison for wolf-killing. The very expert made this their sole business  and became known as wolvers. King Ryder was one of these. He was a  quiet, gentlespoken fellow, with a keen eye and an insight into animal  life that gave him especial power over Broncos and Dogs, as well as  Wolves and Bears, though in the last two cases it was power merely to  surmise where they were and how best to get at them. He had been a  wolver for years, and greatly surprised me by saying that \"never in all  his experience had he known a Gray-wolf to attack a human being.\"    We had many camp-fire talks while the other men were sleeping, and then  it was I learned the little that he knew about Badlands Billy. \"Six  times have I seen him and the seventh will be Sunday, you bet. He takes  his long rest then.\" And thus on the very ground where it all fell out,  to the noise of the night wind and the yapping of the Coyote,  interrupted sometimes by the deep-drawn howl of the hero himself, I  heard chapters of this history which, with others gleaned in many  fields, gave me the story of the Big Dark Wolf of Sentinel Butte.      III    IN THE CANYON    Away back in the spring of '92 a wolver was \"wolving\" on the east side  of the Sentinel Mountain that so long was a principal landmark of the  old Plainsmen. Pelts were not good in May, but the bounties were high,  five dollars a head, and double for She-wolves. As he went down to the  creek one morning he saw a Wolf coming to drink on the other side. He  had an easy shot, and on killing it found it was a nursing She-wolf.  Evidently her family were somewhere near, so he spent two or three days  searching in all the likely places, but found no clue to the den.    Two weeks afterward, as the wolver rode down an adjoining canyon, he saw  a Wolf come out of a hole. The ever-ready rifle flew up, and another  ten-dollar scalp was added to his string. Now he dug into the den and  found the litter, a most surprising one indeed, for it consisted not of  the usual five or six Wolf-pups, but of eleven, and these, strange to  say, were of two sizes, five of them larger and older than the other  six. Here were two distinct families with one mother, and as he added  their scalps to his string of trophies the truth dawned on the hunter.  One lot was surely the family of the She-wolf he had killed two weeks  before. The case was clear: the little ones awaiting the mother that  was never to come, had whined piteously and more loudly as their  hunger-pangs increased; the other mother passing had heard the Cubs;  her heart was tender now, her own little ones had so recently come, and  she cared for the orphans, carried them to her own den, and was  providing for the double family when the rifleman had cut the gentle  chapter short.    Many a wolver has dug into a wolf-den to find nothing. The old Wolves  or possibly the Cubs themselves often dig little side pockets and off  galleries, and when an enemy is breaking in they hide in these. The  loose earth conceals the small pocket and thus the Cubs escape. When  the wolver retired with his scalps he did not know that the biggest of  all the Cubs, was still in the den, and even had he waited about for  two hours, he might have been no wiser. Three hours later the sun went  down and there was a slight scratching afar in the hole; first two  little gray paws, then a small black nose appeared in a soft sand-pile  to one side of the den. At length the Cub came forth from his hiding.  He had been frightened by the attack on the den; now he was perplexed  by its condition.    It was thrice as large as it had been and open at the top now. Lying  near were things that smelled like his brothers and sisters, but they  were repellent to him. He was filled with fear as he sniffed at them,  and sneaked aside into a thicket of grass, as a Night-hawk boomed over  his head. He crouched all night in that thicket. He did not dare to go  near the den, and knew not where else he could go. The next morning  when two Vultures came swooping down on the bodies, the Wolf-cub ran  off in the thicket, and seeking its deepest cover, was led down a  ravine to a wide valley. Suddenly there arose from the grass a big  She-wolf, like his mother, yet different, a stranger, and instinctively  the stray Cub sank to the earth, as the old Wolf bounded on him. No  doubt the Cub had been taken for some lawful prey, but a whiff set that  right. She stood over him for an instant. He grovelled at her feet. The  impulse to kill him or at least give him a shake died away. He had the  smell of a young Cub. Her own were about his age, her heart was  touched, and when he found courage enough to put his nose up and smell  her nose, she made no angry demonstration except a short half-hearted  growl. Now, however, he had smelled something that he sorely needed. He  had not fed since the day before, and when the old Wolf turned to leave  him, he tumbled after her on clumsy puppy legs. Had the Mother-wolf  been far from home he must soon have been left behind, but the nearest  hollow was the chosen place, and the Cub arrived at the den's mouth  soon after the Mother-wolf.    A stranger is an enemy, and the old one rushing forth to the defense,  met the Cub again, and again was restrained by something that rose in  her responsive to the smell. The Cub had thrown himself on his back in  utter submission, but that did not prevent his nose reporting to him  the good thing almost within reach. The She-wolf went into the den and  curled herself about her brood; the Cub persisted in following. She  snarled as he approached her own little ones, but disarming wrath each  time by submission and his very cubhood, he was presently among her  brood, helping himself to what he wanted so greatly, and thus he  adopted himself into her family. In a few days he was so much one of  them that the mother forgot about his being a stranger. Yet he was  different from them in several ways--older by two weeks, stronger, and  marked on the neck and shoulders with what afterward grew to be a dark  mane.    Little Duskymane could not have been happier in his choice of a  foster-mother, for the Yellow Wolf was not only a good hunter with a  fund of cunning, but she was a Wolf of modern ideas as well. The old  tricks of tolling a Prairie Dog, relaying for Antelope, houghing a  Bronco or flanking a Steer she had learned partly from instinct and  partly from the example of her more experienced relatives, when they  joined to form the winter bands. But, just as necessary nowadays, she  had learned that all men carry guns, that guns are irresistible, that  the only way to avoid them is by keeping out of sight while the sun is  up, and yet that at night they are harmless. She had a fair  comprehension of traps, indeed she had been in one once, and though she  left a toe behind in pulling free, it was a toe most advantageously  disposed of; thenceforth, though not comprehending the nature of the  trap, she was thoroughly imbued with the horror of it, with the idea  indeed that iron is dangerous, and at any price it should be avoided.    On one occasion, when she and five others were planning to raid a Sheep  yard, she held back at the last minute because some newstrung wires  appeared. The others rushed in to find the Sheep beyond their reach,  themselves in a death-trap.    Thus she had learned the newer dangers, and while it is unlikely that  she had any clear mental conception of them she had acquired a  wholesome distrust of all things strange, and a horror of one or two in  particular that proved her lasting safeguard. Each year she raised her  brood successfully and the number of Yellow Wolves increased in the  country. Guns, traps, men and the new animals they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22849"],[0,"The History of Tasmania , Volume II (#10)"],[1,"their animosity had not abated: a dark catalogue of murders,  including every age, condition, and sex, attested their subtlety and  sanguinary spirit. He still declared that no means were neglected to  conciliate and reclaim them, consistent with the interests of the colony  at large; but their indiscriminate attacks were equally directed against  their benefactors and their enemies. Communication had become difficult,  a risk of life, and almost impossible.    These statements are, unhappily, sustained by ample proof. It would be a  waste of time even to condense, in the most succinct relation, all the  incidents that occurred. Narrative is tedious by the monotony of detail,  and the events themselves were recorded by those who witnessed them,  with ominous brevity. Such crimes were of daily occurrence; perhaps  sometimes multiplied by rumour, but often unheard of and unrecorded. The  perils of the stockmen were constant: many of them were repeatedly  wounded; and one, named Cubit, was nine times speared, and yet survived.  Death assumed new forms daily: the poet of the Iliad did not describe  more numerous varieties, in the slaughter of his heroes.    The shepherd went from home in the morning, attended by his dog, and  armed with a gun, now unavailing for his defence: he never returned. Had  he escaped to the bush? Such a step was improbable. His employers are  soon informed that the blacks have been near; that the sheep have been  wounded, or beaten to death. The search now becomes diligent: at length,  the melancholy reality is clear; they find a mutilated form, which still  preserves sufficient proof that the lost shepherd lies there. The sad  catastrophe excites the compassion of the master; but it provokes the  fellow servants to rage, and they devote themselves to the destruction  of the murderous race.    The little child strays outside the cottage of her parent--fresh as the  morning, and warmed with the hilarity of young life: a shriek is heard  to succeed quickly the loud laugh of pleasure. The mother rushes  forward; sees a black boy fleeing in the distance, and then beholds the  victim of his malice: she draws forth the spear, and her child is dead.    The settler, now grown rich by his flocks and tillage, looks forward to  the enjoyment of his opulence in domestic happiness. The companion of  his early labors and privations forms the chief object in the picture;  but while he was dreaming of future bliss, the envious eye of a savage,  which had recognised in that prosperous homestead a station of his  fathers, had glanced over and blighted all.    Those who were compelled to travel from home, left their families the  prey to inexpressible anxiety. Every moment of delay awakened new  forebodings. Often would the settler see his wife and children, on some  prominent spot, the subjects of fears which required no interpreter,  shading the eyes in the attitude of earnest attention; and when they  caught the first glimpse of his approach, the rushing together, and  marks of gratulation, indicated the gladness of watchers, whose painful  task is done. To appear in safety, was a new though daily deliverance.    But if such were the fears at home, the traveller himself was not free  from perturbation. He would neglect the common dangers of a rocky  descent, and \"sidling\" way, to guard against perils far more dreaded: he  would often pause, to listen; the moving of the leaf, would terrify him.  He would hear a rush--it was but the cattle: he would gaze steadfastly  at some black substance far off, until convinced that it was the stock  of a tree; then reproaching his fears, he would gallop on rapidly--then  moving round some overhanging rock, he would see savage faces and poised  spears! Retreat is now impossible: he spurs his horse, which seems  almost to be conscious of danger, and perhaps reaches his home exhausted  with fatigue and dread; happy, however, to have been once more  preserved.    Nor is it possible to describe the emotions which were wrought up, by  the consciousness that a feeble woman and helpless children were exposed  to the clubs and spears of the savage. Men know, when they pass their  threshold, that the ties of life are uncertain, and that desolation may  blast whatever they leave tranquil and beloved; but there was an intense  realisation of this hazard, in those parts of the colony where  protection was least accessible.    Death, by the hands of a savage, is indeed invested with the darkest  terrors: it was rarely instantaneous--it was often the effect of  protracted torment, and of repeated blows: often, after a long pursuit,  in which hope might occasionally gleam for a moment, to render death to  the exhausted fugitive more distinct and terrible; or, perhaps, at once  wounded mortally and prostrate, when the rush of early affections and  long forgotten truth and brief supplication would come with that swoon,  by which nature sometimes ushers in the fatal moment; the dying man  would be roused by infernal shouts, and there would swim before him  brandished clubs, and horrid visages distorted with demoniac rage. Such  were the recollections of some who recovered; and such, we may be  assured, were the emotions of many that died.    Comparatively, the natives did not frequently injure women and children;  partly, perhaps, that they were less exposed, and partly from natural  compassion. Thus, when the house of Clarke was destroyed by the Big  River tribe, and its owner perished in the flames, the woman with him  escaped with her clothes ignited--ran to the savages, and fell down upon  her knees, imploring their pity. One of their number extinguished the  flames, and bade her be gone. It may be doubted, if this instance of  compassion always found a parallel in the conduct of the white. About  the same time, a wretch boasted to Mr. O'Connor, that he had thrown a  native woman on the fire, and burnt her to death. The equity of  Providence seems vindicated by the fact, that he perished by the spears  of the race, who watched him continually, until he fell into their  power.    Long after the pacific mission of Robinson, it was found necessary to  restrain the wanderings of the women, to prevent their sacrifice to  white vengeance. But, on the part of the natives, there were not wanting  fearful examples of implacable and treacherous violence. Such was the  murder of Mrs. Gough and her children. In 1828, about twenty men,  unattended by their families, had re-appeared in the centre of the  island, and approached the neighbourhood of Oatlands: they attacked the  cottage of one Moor, as a feint, and thus drew off the husband of the  unfortunate woman, to the assistance of his neighbour. On returning, he  met his daughter, with the sad intelligence, that children and wife were  murdered, and that she only had escaped. He found the mother leaning  against a fence, covered with blood: \"Dear Gough,\" she said, \"it is all  over with me; the blacks have killed me!\" He endeavoured to staunch her  wounds; then hastened to his children, and found them, not dead, but  dying. The blacks had inflicted reiterated blows, and answered  entreaties with threats of murder. Mrs. Gough was shortly afterwards  laid beside her children. The attack was more fierce, and yet  deliberate, than common: but not long before, some stockmen at the Lakes  requested two women to ascend the trees: while there, they shot them. It  is necessary to add, that the women sometimes approached the huts, as  spies, or such actions would be incredible.    The government and the press complained repeatedly, that no regular  resistance was offered to the depredators; that the settlers did not  instantly pursue, and, by combined efforts, intimidate or destroy them.  It was said, that they easily forgot the danger, so soon as the blacks  had withdrawn, and abated even the ordinary vigilance, which such  formidable enemies might inspire. Thus, the slaughter of a shepherd had  become too frequent to produce much sensation, and was set down as a  common risk of colonial life. When they heard that a servant was  speared, they would exclaim, \"Ah! is he killed? poor fellow!\"--and  having brought in a verdict of wilful murder, they left him to the  forgetfulness of the grave.    It was said, that as the passenger approached the towns, he found the  anxiety of the people diminished, and their feeling revolutionised. In  the interior, the blacks were spoken of with intense fear, and  detestation: in the capital, even their depredations were questioned,  and the subjects of conversation, were rather their sufferings than  their crimes.    Governor Arthur strongly censured the negligence of farmers; but this  was rather to arouse them, than to decide finally the fact, or  culpability of their inaction. In truth, the pursuit of a party of  aborigines, was a very hopeless affair: it required a minute  preparation; and to a well fleshed, and not perhaps youthful yeoman, was  attended with vast fatigue, and almost certain failure. An organised  enemy may be found: not so, naked and scattered blacks,  undistinguishable from the trees of the wood; who could crouch in a  gulley--creep almost as rapidly as a dog. The appearance of apathy, in  reality resulted from the uselessness or danger of action; nor can it be  a matter of surprise, that men expelled from their minds an evil merely  possible, which they hoped to escape, and which no forethought would  avoid. Whether these imputations were just, or not, they were revived in  various forms, by the Governor's private and public addresses. They  constitute a large portion of his correspondence with the Home  Government; but they drew forth from the Secretary of State what,  perhaps, was chiefly desired--an approbation of his measures of  protection; for, however apathetic individuals, it was admitted, that  the repression of outrage, from whatever cause, and at whatever cost,  was an obligation"]]]
