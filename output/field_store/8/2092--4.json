The flying squirrel drifts  like a falling leaf; the bat flits like a black rag torn at the edge.  To give power, we must have plumes that can strike, as with the flat of  a sword-blade; and to give _perfect_ power, these must be laid over  each other, so that each may support the one below it. I use the word  below advisedly: we have to strike _down_. The lowest feather is the  one that first meets the adverse force. It is the one to be supported.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    Now for the manner of the support. You must all know well the look of  the machicolated parapets in mediaeval castles. You know they are  carried on rows of small projecting buttresses constructed so that,  though the uppermost stone, far-projecting, would break easily under  any shock, it is supported by the next below, and so on, down to the  wall. Now in this figure I am obliged to separate the feathers by white  spaces, to show you them distinctly. In reality they are set as close  to each other as can be, but putting them as close as I can, you get  _a_ or _b_, Fig. 5, for the rough section of the wing, thick towards  the bird's head, and curved like a sickle, so that in striking down it  catches the air, like a reaping-hook, and in rising up, it throws off  the air like a pent-house.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    70. The stroke would therefore be vigorous, and the recovery almost  effortless, were even the direction of both actually vertical. But  they are vertical only with relation to the bird's body. In space they  follow the forward flight, in a softly curved line; the downward  stroke being as effective as the bird chooses, the recovery scarcely  encounters resistance in the softly gliding ascent. Thus, in Fig. 5,  (I can only explain this to readers a little versed in the elements of  mechanics,) if B is the locus of the center of gravity of the bird,  moving in slow flight in the direction of the arrow, w is the locus of  the leading feather of its wing, and _a_ and _b_, roughly, the  successive positions of the wing in the down-stroke and recovery.    71. I say the down-stroke is as effective as the bird chooses; that is  to say, it can be given with exactly the quantity of impulse, and  exactly the quantity of supporting power, required at the moment. Thus,  when the bird wants to fly slowly, the wings are fluttered fast, giving  vertical blows; if it wants to pause absolutely in still air, (this  large birds cannot do, not being able to move their wings fast enough,)  the velocity becomes vibration, as in the humming-bird: but if there is  wind, any of the larger birds can lay themselves on it like a kite,  their own weight answering the purpose of the string,[14] while they  keep the wings and tail in an inclined plane, giving them as much  gliding ascent as counteracts the fall. They nearly all, however, use  some slightly gliding force at the same time; a single stroke of the  wing, with forward intent, seeming enough to enable them to glide on  for half a minute or more without stirring a plume. A circling eagle  floats an inconceivable time without visible stroke: (fancy the pretty  action of the inner wing, _backing_ air instead of water, which gives  exactly the breadth of circle he chooses). But for exhibition of the  complete art of flight, a swallow on rough water is the master of  masters. A sea-gull, with all its splendid power, generally has its  work cut out for it, and is visibly fighting; but the swallow plays  with wind and wave as a girl plays with her fan, and there are no words  to say how many things it does with its wings in any ten seconds, and  does consummately. The mystery of its dart remains always inexplicable  to me; no eye can trace the bending of bow that sends that living  arrow.    But the main structure of the noble weapon we may with little pains  understand.          [14] See App. p. 112, Sec. 145.    72. In the sections _a_ and _b_ of Fig. 5, I have only represented the  quills of the outer part of the wing. The relation of these, and of the  inner quills, to the bird's body may be very simply shown.    Fig. 6 is a rude sketch, typically representing the wing of any bird,  but actually founded chiefly on the sea-gull's.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.]    It is broadly composed of two fans, A and B. The out-most fan, A, is  carried by the bird's hand; of which I rudely sketch the contour of the  bones at _a_. The innermost fan, B, is carried by the bird's forearm,  from wrist to elbow, _b_.    The strong humerus, _c_, corresponding to our arm from shoulder to  elbow, has command of the whole instrument. No feathers are attached to  this bone; but covering and protecting ones are set in the skin of it,  completely filling, when the active wing is open, the space between it  and the body. But the plumes of the two great fans, A and B, are set  into the bones; in Fig. 8, farther on, are shown the projecting knobs  on the main arm bone, set for the reception of the quills, which make  it look like the club of Hercules. The connection of the still more  powerful quills of the outer fan with the bones of the hand is quite  beyond all my poor anatomical perceptions, and, happily for me, also  beyond needs of artistic investigation.    73. The feathers of the fan A are called the primaries. Those of the  fan B, secondaries. Effective actions of flight, whether for support or  forward motion, are, I believe, all executed with the primaries, every  one of which may be briefly described as the strongest cimeter that can  be made of quill substance; flexible within limits, and elastic at its  edges--carried by an elastic central shaft--twisted like a windmill  sail--striking with the flat, and recovering with the edge.    The secondary feathers are more rounded at the ends, and frequently  notched; their curvature is reversed to that of the primaries; they are  arranged, when expanded, somewhat in the shape of a shallow cup, with  the hollow of it downwards, holding the air therefore, and aiding in  all the pause and buoyancy of flight, but little in the activity of it.  Essentially they are the brooding and covering feathers of the wing;  exquisitely beautiful--as far as I have yet seen, _most_ beautiful--in  the bird whose brooding is of most use to us; and which has become the  image of all tenderness. \"How often would I have gathered thy children  ... and ye would not.\"    74. Over these two chief masses of the plume are set others which  partly complete their power, partly adorn and protect them; but of  these I can take no notice at present. All that I want you to  understand is the action of the two main masses, as the wing is opened  and closed.    Fig. 7 roughly represents the upper surface of the main feathers of the  wing closed. The secondaries are folded over the primaries; and the  primaries shut up close, with their outer edges parallel, or nearly so.  Fig. 8 roughly shows the outline of the bones, in this position, of one  of the larger pigeons.[15]    [Illustration: FIG. 7.]    [Illustration: FIG. 8.]          [15] I find even this mere outline of anatomical structure so        interferes with the temper in which I wish my readers to think,        that I shall withdraw it in my complete edition.    75. Then Fig. 9 is (always sketched in the roughest way) the outer,  Fig. 10 the inner, surface of a sea-gull's wing in this position. Next,  Fig. 11 shows the tops of the four lowest feathers in Fig. 9, in mere  outline; A separate (pulled off, so that they can be set side by side),  B shut up close in the folded wing, C, opened in the spread wing.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.]    [Illustration: FIG. 10.]    [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    76. And now, if you will yourselves watch a few birds in flight, or  opening and closing their wings to prune them, you will soon know as  much as is needful for our art purposes; and, which is far more  desirable, feel how very little we know, to any purpose, of even the  familiar creatures that are our companions.    Even what we have seen to-day[16] is more than appears to have been  noticed by the most careful painters of the great schools; and you will  continually fancy that I am inconsistent with myself in pressing you to  learn, better than they, the anatomy of birds, while I violently and  constantly urge you to refuse the knowledge of the anatomy of men. But  you will find, as my system develops itself, that it is absolutely  consistent throughout. I don't mean, by telling you not to study human  anatomy, that you are not to know how many fingers and toes you have,  nor how you can grasp and walk with them; and, similarly, when you look  at a bird, I wish you to know how many claws and wing-feathers it has,  and how it grips and flies with them. Of the bones, in either, I shall  show you little; and of the muscles, nothing but what can be seen in  the living creature, nor, often, even so much.          [16] Large and somewhat carefully painted diagrams were shown at        the lecture, which I cannot engrave but for my complete edition.    77. And accordingly, when I now show you this sketch of my favorite  Holbein, and tell you that it is entirely disgraceful he should not  know what a wing was, better, I don't mean that it is disgraceful he  should not know the anatomy of it, but that he should never have looked  at it to see how the feathers lie.    Now Holbein paints men gloriously, but never looks at birds; Gibbons,  the wood-cutter, carves birds, but can't men;--of the two faults the  last is the worst; but the right is in looking at the whole of nature  in due comparison, and with universal candor and tenderness.    78. At the whole of nature, I say, not at _super_-nature--at what you  suppose to be above the visible nature about you.

In Rome there dwelt, in days of yore,  A painter deep in graphic lore.  His touch was firm, his outline true,  And every rule full well he knew.  A Mars he painted, meant to show  How far his learned skill could go.  The work complete, he call'd a friend,  On whose good taste he could depend.  The friend was honest, spoke his thought,  And fairly pointed out the fault,  \"That overwork'd in every part,  It show'd too much laborious art.\"  The painter argued for his rules,  And cited maxims from the schools;  Still the judicious critic held  The labor should be more conceal'd.  While they disputed on his stricture,  A coxcomb came to see the picture:  Entering, he cries, \"Good heavens, how fine!  The piece, I swear, is quite divine!  The sword, the knot, the belt, the leather,  The steel, the gold, the silk, the feather,  Are perfect nature, all together!\"  The painter, reddening with despite,  Whispers, \"My friend, by Jove, you're right.  'Tis not enough our art to know,  Till less of it we learn to show;  My picture must be done again  I see, to please discerning men.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE COBBLER AND THE NABOB.      A cobbler, who had fix'd his stall  Against a nabob's palace wall,  Work'd merrily as others play,  And sung and whistled all the day.  A prey to many an anxious care,  Less merry was the lord, by far;  And often in the night he thought  It hard, sleep was not to be bought:  And if tow'rds morn he got a doze,  The cobbler troubled his repose.  One day he bid the man attend--  And, \"Well,\" says he, \"my honest friend,  How is it that so well you thrive?  You seem the happiest man alive.  Pray, what may be the profit clear,  That you can earn within the year?\"  \"What in a twelvemonth I can earn,  My lord, was never my concern;  'Tis quite enough,\" the cobbler said,  \"If I can gain my daily bread.\"  \"Take then this note\"--'twas twenty pound;  \"But sing not with so shrill a sound,  Good man,\" the generous nabob cries,  \"When early to your work you rise;  For then I want to close my eyes.\"  Delighted to his stall he went:  But now he first felt discontent;  All day he neither work'd nor ate,  For thinking of his happy fate.  At night, when he retir'd to bed,  He plac'd the note beneath his head.  But could not sleep a single wink,  What he should do with it, to think;  And every little noise he heard,  That folks were come to rob him, fear'd.  Living in constant dread to all,  Who did but look towards his stall,  So lean and sallow he was grown,  The man was hardly to be known.  At last he begg'd the lord to see:  \"Take back your present, sir,\" said he,  \"Riches, I find, are not for me.  To-morrow I my song renew;  Not less my gratitude to you:  And care henceforward I will take,  My chaunts your slumber do not break.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER.      A man a palfrey long possess'd,  A quiet, serviceable beast;  Spavin'd, indeed, and somewhat blind,  But still his way he well could find;  And if he stumbled now and then,  Was soon upon his feet again.  In short, for many a year, the pack  Had borne him safely on his back.  Till riding out one fatal day,  He overheard some coxcombs say,  \"For such a man, 'tis quite a shame,  To mount a horse old, blind, and lame.\"  \"Aye,\" replied one, \"I know a steed  Would nobly carry him indeed;  Young, vigorous, beautiful, and sound;  His like is nowhere to be found.\"  In evil hour an ear he lent,  To view this boasted courser went:  Unwary on his back he got,  And tried to put him on a trot;  He rear'd and plung'd, and leap'd about,  Till from his seat he shook him out,  Then kicking, pitch'd him o'er his head,  And laid him on the pavement dead.  The vicious creature left at large,  On all his fury would discharge;  This from behind his heels surprise,  Trod under foot, that sprawling lies:  Another, who would seize the reins,  Is bit and mangled for his pains.  But want of nourishment and rest  Will tame at last the fiercest beast;  And rage itself suspends its course,  Exhausted by its proper force.  Light'ning no more his eyes inspire,  No more his nostrils snorted fire;  At bay he stood, fatigu'd and lank,  With flagging ears, and beating flank.  An active jockey, stout and able,  Contracts to bring him to the stable;  Soothes, and his neck begins to pat,  And the corn rattles in his hat;  By hunger drawn, repell'd by fear,  The courser neighs, retires, comes near;  Lur'd with the smell, begins to eat.  The jockey vaulted in the seat:  With vigorous hand the bridle plied,  And stuck the rowels in his side.  Some bounds and curvets still he made,  But soon submissively obey'd.  The horseman who such skill had shown,  Resolv'd to keep him for his own:  Aware that constant work alone  Can keep this wicked spirit down  He night and day is on his back,  To lead him to some new attack,  No road is safe, nor far nor near,  This highwayman is every where.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE GOOD MINISTER.      An honest minister disgrac'd,  (Such are not easily replac'd,)  Found the sweet leisure in his fields,  To virtuous minds retirement yields.  The king, who had his foes believ'd,  The loss of him ere long perceiv'd.  To bring him back again intent,  To his retreat alone he went:  \"My friend, you must return with me,\"  He said, \"your value now I see.\"  \"Forgive me,\" the Recluse replied;  \"Here I determine to abide.  By sad experience well I know,  Were I to court again to go,  And all my best endeavors do,  To serve my country, sir, and you,  Art and intrigue so much prevail,  Again I certainly should fail;  Against your will and approbation,  And the good wishes of the nation,  You'd find yourself compell'd to yield,  And I once more must quit the field.\"    The honest man, who will not bend  To circumstance, or condescend  To pay his court to knave or fool,  Will never long a nation rule.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE SWAN AND THE COOK.      A man once had a swan and goose    Among his birds and beasts.  The one was destined for a pet,    The other for a feast.  Sometimes you saw them sailing    Gracefully on the current, side by side,  Sometimes they played a game of tag,    Or plunged into the tide.  One day the master ordered    The cook to kill the goose,  And roast it for his dinner;    It was fat and fit for use.  But the cook had taken a drop too much,    And it had gone to his head;  So when he went out for the goose    He took the swan instead.  He seized the swan fast by the throat,    And would have kill'd it soon:  But the bird saw he was to die,    And he his throat did tune,  And warbled out his farewell lay.    The cook straight dropped his knife  In great surprise, \"what! what!\" cried he,    \"Shall I take the life  Of a musical bird like this?    No, no! it must not be.  So to the garden he shall go back    And ne'er be kill'd by me.\"          [Illustration]    THE LYNX AND THE MOLE.      A lynx once met by chance a mole,  Just emerging from his hole.  The lynx with penetrating eye  The beauties of the place did spy,  And asked the mole to take a share  In the fine prospect, rich and rare.  \"I've seldom found so good a place.  From this small hill you see a space  Extended far beneath your view,  I like it much; pray do not you?  See now the sun begins to rise,  And with crimson tints the skies.  It spreads all round its genial heat,  And nature now enjoys a treat.\"  \"Well, well!\" the mole aloud did cry  \"You may see this and more, but I  Can only now before me see,  A very heavy mist.\" \"Truly,  Now,\" said the lynx, \"I clearly see  The difference 'twixt you and me.  My eyes see with perception bright  While your's are always dark as night.  Go to your hold beneath the ground,  While I will range the forest round.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE OLD CAT AND THE YOUNG  MOUSE.      A young mouse of little experience,  Thought to soften an old cat,  And besought her clemency,  By asking for his life at her expense.  Said he, \"A mouse, or e'en a rat,  Is not a great charge on the house;  And I shall not starve out the host.  Besides I seldom quit my post,  And when I do a grain of corn  Has served me since I first was born.  Now I am thin, pray let me be,  I'll serve your children yet, you'll see.\"  Thus to the cat spoke the poor mouse.  The other answered, \"You mistake,  When unto me this tone you take;  You might as well talk to the deaf,  As to so old a cat as I,  And through your tricks I spy,  Die! you can go and chatter to the fates,  My children will be fed on better cates.\"      MORAL.    Youth is sanguine, and hopes for all:  Old age is pitiless; so says our moral.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE TWO FRIENDS.      Two real friends lived in Monomotapa,  All that belonged to one was for the other,  And each was unto each a brother.  The people of that country, thus,  Make better friends than among us.  One night when fast asleep,    They each were sound reposing,  The eldest darted from his couch,    And stopped the other's dozing.  He runs to see his friend,  Awakes the slaves, and in the end,  Even his friend is quite alarmed,  And goes to seek the other,  With sword and purse. \"My brother,  What can the matter be?  Here I am armed, you see,  Ready with sword to fight for you,  And here is money ready too,  If you have lost in play.  You're even welcome to my handsome slave,  With jet black hair, and eyes so grave.\"  \"No!\" said the other, \"I need naught,  But ere I slept to-night, I thought,  Being in a trance, that you were sad,  And as the thought nigh drove me mad,  I hurried to your tent,  And found you sleeping quite content.\"      MORAL.
