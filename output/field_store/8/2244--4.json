Up over the fields came  the roar and crash of the surges on the outside shore. The Harbour to  the east of Bayside was rough and stormy.    They were just rising from breakfast when Will Barrie burst into the  kitchen.    \"The _Amy Reade_ is ashore on Gleeson's rocks!\" he shouted. \"Struck  there at daylight this morning! Come on, Curt!\"    Curtis sprang for his cap, his uncle following suit more deliberately.  As the two boys ran through the yard, Curtis heard Don howling.    \"I'll take him with me!\" he muttered. \"Wait a minute, Will.\"    The Harbour road was thronged with people hurrying to the outside  shore, for the news of the _Amy Readers_ disaster had spread rapidly.  As the boys, with the rejoicing Don at their heels, pelted along, Sam  Morrow overtook them in a cart and told them to jump in. Sam had  already been down to the shore and had gone back to tell his father.  As they jolted along, he screamed information at them over the shriek  of the gale.    \"Bad business, this! She's pounding on a reef 'bout a quarter of a  mile out. They're sure she's going to break up--old tub, you  know--leaky--rotten. The sea's tremenjus high, and the surfs going  dean over her. There can't be no boat launched for hours yet--they'll  all be drowned. Old Paul's down there like a madman--offering  everything he's got to the man who'll save Oscar, but it can't be  done.\"    By this time they had reached the shore, which was black with excited  people. Out on Gleeson's Reef the ill-fated little schooner was  visible amid the flying spray. A grizzled old Harbour fisherman, to  whom Sam shouted a question, shook his head.    \"No, can't do nothin'! No boat c'd live in that surf f'r a moment. The  schooner'll go to pieces mighty soon, I'm feared. It's turrible!  turrible! to stan' by an' watch yer neighbours drown like this!\"    Curtis and Will elbowed their way down to the water's edge. The  relatives of the crew were all there in various stages of despair, but  old Paul Stockton seemed like a man demented. He ran up and down the  beach, crying and praying. His only son was on the _Amy Reade_, and he  could do nothing to save him!    \"What are they doing?\" asked Will of Martin Clark.    \"Trying to get a line ashore by throwing out a small rope with a stick  tied to it,\" answered Martin. \"It's young Stockton that's trying now.  But it isn't any use. The cross-currents on that reef are too  powerful.\"    \"Why, Don will bring that line ashore!\" exclaimed Curtis. \"Here, Don!  Don, I say!\"    The dog bounded back along the shore with a quick bark. Curtis grasped  him by the collar and pointed to the stick which young Stockton had  just hurled again into the water. Don, with another bark of  comprehension, dashed into the sea. The onlookers, grasping the  situation, gave a cheer and then relapsed into silence. Only the  shriek of the gale and the crash of the waves could be heard as they  watched the magnificent dog swimming out through the breakers, his big  black head now rising on the crest of a wave and now disappearing in  the hollow behind it. When Don finally reached the tossing stick,  grasped it in his mouth and turned shoreward, another great shout went  up from the beach. A woman behind Curtis, whose husband was on the  schooner, dropped on her knees on the pebbles, sobbing and thanking  God. Curtis himself felt the stinging tears start to his eyes.    When Don reached the shore he dropped the stick at Curtis's feet and  gave himself a tremendous shake. Curtis caught at the stick, while a  dozen men and women threw themselves bodily on Don, hugging him and  kissing his wet fur like distracted creatures. Old Paul Stockton was  among them. Over his shoulder Don's big black head looked up, his eyes  asking as plainly as speech what all this fuss was about.    Meanwhile some of the men had already pulled a big hawser ashore and  made it fast. In half an hour the crew of the _Amy Reade_ were safe on  shore, chilled and dripping. Before they were hurried away to warmth  and shelter, old Paul Stockton caught Curtis's hand. The tears were  running freely down his hard, old face.    \"Tell your uncle he is not to lay a finger on that dog!\" he said. \"He  never killed a sheep of mine--he couldn't! And if he did I don't care!  He's welcome to kill them all, if nothing but mutton'll serve his  turn.\"    Curtis walked home with a glad heart. Mr. Locksley heard old Paul's  message with a smile. He, too, had been touched by Don's splendid  feat.    \"Well, Curtis, I'm very glad that it has turned old Paul in his  favour. But we must shut Don up for a week or so, no matter how hard  he takes it. You can see that for yourself. After all, he might have  worried the sheep. And, anyway, he must be broken of his intimacy with  Ventnor's dog.\"    Curtis acknowledged the justice of this and poor Don was tied up  again. His captivity was not long, however, for Ventnor's dog was soon  shot. When Don was released, Curtis had an anxious time for a week or  two. But no more sheep were worried, and Don's innocence was  triumphantly established. As for old Paul Stockton, it seemed as if  he could not do enough for Curtis and Don. His ancient grudge against  the Locksleys was completely forgotten, and from that date he was a  firm friend of Curtis. In regard to Don, old Paul would say:    \"Why, there never was such a dog before, sir, never! He just talks  with his eyes, that dog does. And if you'd just 'a' seen him swimming  out to that schooner! Bones? Yes, sir! Every time that dog comes here  he's to get the best bones we've got for him--and more'n bones, too.  That dog's a hero, sir, that's what he is!\"          Miss Madeline's Proposal      \"Auntie, I have something to tell you,\" said Lina, with a blush that  made her look more than ever like one of the climbing roses that  nodded about the windows of the \"old Churchill place,\" as it was  always called in Lower Wentworth.    Miss Madeline, sitting in the low rocker by the parlour window, seemed  like the presiding genius of the place. Everything about her matched  her sweet old-fashionedness, from the crown of her soft brown hair,  dressed in the style of her long ago girlhood, to the toes of her  daintily slippered feet. Outside of the old Churchill place, in the  busy streets of the up-to-date little town, Miss Madeline might have  seemed out of harmony with her surroundings. But here, in this dim  room, faintly scented with whiffs from the rose garden outside, she  was like a note in some sweet, perfect melody of old time.    Lina, sitting on a little stool at Miss Madeline's feet with her curly  head in her aunt's lap, was as pretty as Miss Madeline herself had  once been. She was also very happy, and her happiness seemed to  envelop her as in an atmosphere and lend her a new radiance and charm.  Miss Madeline loved her pretty niece very dearly and patted the curly  head tenderly with her slender white hands.    \"What is it, my dear?\"    \"I'm--I'm engaged,\" whispered Lina, hiding her face in Miss Madeline's  flowered muslin lap.    \"Engaged!\" Miss Madeline's tone was one of surprise and awe. She  blushed as she said the word as deeply as Lina had done. Then she went  on, with a little quiver of excitement in her voice, \"To whom, my  dear?\"    \"Oh, you don't know him, Auntie, but I hope you will soon. His name is  Ralph Wylde. Isn't it pretty? I met him last winter, and we became  very good friends. But we had a quarrel before I came down here and,  oh, I have been so unhappy over it. Three weeks ago he wrote me and  begged my pardon--so nice of him, because I was really all to blame,  you know. And he said he loved me and--all that, you know.\"    \"No, I don't know,\" said Miss Madeline gently. \"But--but--I can  imagine.\"    \"Oh, I was so happy. I wrote back and I had this letter from him  today. He is coming down tomorrow. You'll be glad to see him, won't  you, Auntie?\"    \"Oh, yes, my dear, and I am glad for your sake--very glad. You are  sure you love him?\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" said Lina, with a little laugh, as if wondering how  anyone could doubt it.    Presently, Miss Madeline said in a shy voice, \"Lina, did--did you ever  receive a proposal of marriage from anybody besides Mr. Wylde?\"    Lina laughed roguishly. \"Why, yes, Auntie, ever so many. A dozen, at  least.\"    \"Oh, my dear!\" cried Miss Madeline in a slightly shocked tone.    \"But I did, really. Sometimes it was horrid and sometimes it was  funny. It all depended on the man. Dear me, how red and uncomfortable  most of them looked--all but the fifth. He was so cool and business  like that he almost surprised me into accepting him.\"    \"And--and what did you feel like, Lina?\"    \"Oh, frightened, mostly--but I always wanted to laugh too. You must  know how it is yourself, Auntie. What did you feel like when somebody  proposed to you?\"    Miss Madeline flushed from chin to brow.    \"Oh, Lina,\" she faltered as if she were confessing something very  disgraceful, yet to which she was impelled by her strict truthfulness,  \"I--I--never had a proposal in my life--not one.\"    Lina opened her big brown eyes in amazement. \"Why, Aunt Madeline! And  you so pretty! What was the reason?\"    \"I've often wondered,\" said Miss Madeline faintly. \"I _was_ pretty, as  you say--it's so long ago I can say that now. And I had many gentlemen  friends. But nobody ever wanted to marry me. I sometimes wish  that--that I could have had just one proposal. Not that I wanted to  marry, you know, I do not mean that, but just so that it wouldn't have  seemed that I was different from anybody else. It is very foolish of  me to wish it, I know, and even wicked--for if I had not cared for the  person it would have made him very unhappy. But then, he would have  forgotten and I would have remembered. It would always have been  something to be a little proud of.\"    \"Yes,\" said Lina"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24876"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1905 to 1906 (#10)"],[1,"og's head. He had not  known it either.    \"Oh, yes,\" said Christopher, enjoying all the importance of exclusive  information. \"I thought everybody knew that. Pinehurst goes to the  oldest male heir. The old kunnel felt it keen that he hadn't a son. Of  course, there's plenty of money and Sara'll get that. But I guess  she'll feel pretty bad at leaving her old home. Sara ain't as young as  she used to be, neither. Let me see--she must be thirty-eight. Well,  she's left pretty lonesome.\"    \"Maybe she'll stay on at Pinehurst,\" said Job Crowe. \"It'd only be  right for her cousin to give her a home there.\"    Christopher shook his head.    \"No, I understand they're not on very good terms. Sara don't like  Charles Stuart or his wife--and I don't blame her. She won't stay  there, not likely. Probably she'll go and live in town. Strange she  never married. She was reckoned handsome, and had plenty of beaus at  one time.\"    Jeffrey swung out of the group and started homeward with his dog. To  stand by and hear Sara Stuart discussed after this fashion was more  than he could endure. The men idly watched his tall, erect figure as  he went along the valley.    \"Queer chap, Jeff,\" said Alec Churchill reflectively.    \"Jeff's all right,\" said Christopher in a patronizing way. \"There  ain't a better man or neighbour alive. I've lived next farm to him for  thirty years, so I ought to know. But he's queer sartainly--not like  other people--kind of unsociable. He don't care for a thing 'cept dogs  and reading and mooning round woods and fields. That ain't natural,  you know. But I must say he's a good farmer. He's got the best farm in  Bayside, and that's a real nice house he put up on it. Ain't it an odd  thing he never married? Never seemed to have no notion of it. I can't  recollect of Jeff Miller's ever courting anybody. That's another  unnatural thing about him.\"    \"I've always thought that Jeff thought himself a cut or two above the  rest of us,\" said Tom Scovel with a sneer. \"Maybe he thinks the  Bayside girls ain't good enough for him.\"    \"There ain't no such dirty pride about Jeff,\" pronounced Christopher  conclusively. \"And the Millers _are_ the best family hereabouts,  leaving the kunnel's out. And Jeff's well off--nobody knows how well,  I reckon, but I can guess, being his land neighbour. Jeff ain't no  fool nor loafer, if he is a bit queer.\"    Meanwhile, the object of these remarks was striding homeward and  thinking, not of the men behind him, but of Sara Stuart. He must go to  her at once. He had not intruded on her since her father's death,  thinking her sorrow too great for him to meddle with. But this was  different. Perhaps she needed the advice or assistance only he could  give. To whom else in Bayside could she turn for it but to him, her  old friend? Was it possible that she must leave Pinehurst? The thought  struck cold dismay to his soul. How could he bear his life if she went  away?    He had loved Sara Stuart from childhood. He remembered vividly the day  he had first seen her--a spring day, much like this one had been; he,  a boy of eight, had gone with his father to the big, sunshiny hill  field and he had searched for birds' nests in the little fir copses  along the crest while his father plowed. He had so come upon her,  sitting on the fence under the pines at the back of Pinehurst--a child  of six in a dress of purple cloth. Her long, light brown curls fell  over her shoulders and rippled sleekly back from her calm little brow;  her eyes were large and greyish blue, straight-gazing and steadfast.  To the end of his life the boy was to carry in his heart the picture  she made there under the pines.    \"Little boy,\" she had said, with a friendly smile, \"will you show me  where the mayflowers grow?\"    Shyly enough he had assented, and they set out together for the  barrens beyond the field, where the arbutus trailed its stars of  sweetness under the dusty dead grasses and withered leaves of the old  year. The boy was thrilled with delight. She was a fairy queen who  thus graciously smiled on him and chattered blithely as they searched  for mayflowers in the fresh spring sunshine. He thought it a  wonderful thing that it had so chanced. It overjoyed him to give the  choicest dusters he found into her slim, waxen little fingers, and  watch her eyes grow round with pleasure in them. When the sun began to  lower over the beeches she had gone home with her arms full of  arbutus, but she had turned at the edge of the pineland and waved her  hand at him.    That night, when he told his mother of the little girl he had met on  the hill, she had hoped anxiously that he had been \"very polite,\" for  the little girl was a daughter of Colonel Stuart, newly come to  Pinehurst. Jeffrey, reflecting, had not been certain that he had been  polite; \"But I am sure she liked me,\" he said gravely.    A few days later a message came from Mrs. Stuart on the hill to Mrs.  Miller in the valley. Would she let her little boy go up now and then  to play with Sara? Sara was very lonely because she had no playmates.  So Jeff, overjoyed, had gone to his divinity's very home, where the  two children played together many a day. All through their childhood  they had been fast friends. Sara's parents placed no bar to their  intimacy. They had soon concluded that little Jeff Miller was a very  good playmate for Sara. He was gentle, well-behaved, and manly.    Sara never went to the district school which Jeff attended; she had  her governess at home. With no other boy or girl in Bayside did she  form any friendship, but her loyalty to Jeff never wavered. As for  Jeff, he worshipped her and would have done anything she commanded. He  belonged to her from the day they had hunted arbutus on the hill.    When Sara was fifteen she had gone away to school. Jeff had missed her  sorely. For four years he saw her only in the summers, and each year  she had seemed taller, statelier, further from him. When she graduated  her father took her abroad for two years; then she came home, a  lovely, high-bred girl, dimpling on the threshold of womanhood; and  Jeffrey Miller was face to face with two bitter facts. One was that he  loved her--not with the boy-and-girl love of long ago, but with the  love of a man for the one woman in the world; and the other was that  she was as far beyond his reach as one of those sunset stars of which  she had always reminded him in her pure, clear-shining loveliness.    He looked these facts unflinchingly in the face until he had grown  used to them, and then he laid down his course for himself. He loved  Sara--and he did not wish to conquer his love, even if it had been  possible. It were better to love her, whom he could never win, than to  love and be loved by any other woman. His great office in life was to  be her friend, humble and unexpectant; to be at hand if she should  need him for ever so trifling a service; never to presume, always to  be faithful.    Sara had not forgotten her old friend. But their former comradeship  was now impossible; they could be friends, but never again  companions. Sara's life was full and gay; she had interests in which  he had no share; her social world was utterly apart from his; she was  of the hill and its traditions, he was of the valley and its people.  The democracy of childhood past, there was no common ground on which  they might meet. Only one thing Jeffrey had found it impossible to  contemplate calmly. Some day Sara would marry--a man who was her  equal, who sat at her father's table as a guest. In spite of himself,  Jeffrey's heart filled with hot rebellion at the thought; it was like  a desecration and a robbery.    But, as the years went by, this thing he dreaded did not happen. Sara  did not marry, although gossip assigned her many suitors not unworthy  of her. She and Jeffrey were always friends, although they met but  seldom. Sometimes she sent him a book; it was his custom to search for  the earliest mayflowers and take them to her; once in a long while  they met and talked of many things. Jeffrey's calendar from year to  year was red-lettered by these small happenings, of which nobody knew,  or, knowing, would have cared.    So he and Sara drifted out of youth, together yet apart. Her mother  had died, and Sara was the gracious, stately mistress of Pinehurst,  which grew quieter as the time went on; the lovers ceased to come, and  holiday friends grew few; with the old colonel's failing health the  gaieties and lavish entertaining ceased. Jeffrey thought that Sara  must often be lonely, but she never said so; she remained sweet,  serene, calm-eyed, like the child he had met on the hill. Only, now  and then, Jeffrey fancied he saw a shadow on her face--a shadow so  faint and fleeting that only the eye of an unselfish, abiding love,  made clear-sighted by patient years, could have seen it. It hurt him,  that shadow; he would have given anything in his power to have  banished it.    And now this long friendship was to be broken. Sara was going away. At  first he had thought only of her pain, but now his own filled his  heart. How could he live without her? How could he dwell in the valley  knowing that she had gone from the hill? Never to see her light shine  down on him through the northern gap in the pines at night! Never to  feel that perhaps her eyes rested on him now and then as he went about  his work in the valley fields! Never to stoop with a glad thrill over  the first spring flowers because it was his privilege to take them to  her! Jeffrey groaned aloud. No, he could not go up to see her that  night; he must wait--he must strengthen himself.    Then his heart rebuked him. This was selfishness; this was putting his  own feelings before hers--a thing he had sworn never to do. Perhaps  she needed him--perhaps she had wondered why he had not come to offer  her such poor service as might be in his power. He turned and went  down through the orchard"]]]
