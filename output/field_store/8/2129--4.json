Magnificent ceremonies still took place,  Venice was still the most splendid and the most luxurious city in the  world. If the splendour and luxury were hollow, they were not more so  than elsewhere in Europe. The eighteenth century had the strength which  comes from great self-confidence and profound satisfaction with one's  surroundings. It was so self-satisfied that it could not dream of  striving to be much better than it was. Everything was just right; there  seemed to be no great issues, no problems arising that human  intelligence untrammelled by superstition could not instantly solve.  Everybody was therefore in holiday mood, and the gaiety and frivolity of  the century were of almost as much account as its politics and culture.  There was no room for great distinctions. Hair-dressers and tailors  found as much consideration as philosophers and statesmen at a lady's  levee. People were delighted with their own occupations, their whole  lives; and whatever people delight in, that they will have represented  in art. The love for pictures was by no means dead in Venice, and Longhi  painted for the picture-loving Venetians their own lives in all their  ordinary domestic and fashionable phases. In the hair-dressing scenes  we hear the gossip of the periwigged barber; in the dressmaking scenes,  the chatter of the maid; in the dancing-school, the pleasant music of  the violin. There is no tragic note anywhere. Everybody dresses, dances,  makes bows, takes coffee, as if there were nothing else in the world  that wanted doing. A tone of high courtesy, of great refinement, coupled  with an all-pervading cheerfulness, distinguishes Longhi's pictures from  the works of Hogarth, at once so brutal and so full of presage of  change.      =XXV. Canaletto and Guardi.=--Venice herself had not grown less beautiful  in her decline. Indeed, the building which occupies the very centre of  the picture Venice leaves in the mind, the Salute, was not built until  the seventeenth century. This was the picture that the Venetian himself  loved to have painted for him, and that the stranger wanted to carry  away. Canale painted Venice with a feeling for space and atmosphere,  with a mastery over the delicate effects of mist peculiar to the city,  that make his views of the Salute, the Grand Canal, and the Piazzetta  still seem more like Venice than all the pictures of them that have been  painted since. Later in the century Canale was followed by Guardi, who  executed smaller views with more of an eye for the picturesque, and for  what may be called instantaneous effects, thus anticipating both the  Romantic and the Impressionist painters of our own century.      =XXVI. Tiepolo.=--But delightful as Longhi, Canale, and Guardi are, and  imbued as they are with the spirit of their own century, they lack the  quality of force, without which there can be no really impressive style.  This quality their contemporary Tiepolo possessed to the utmost. His  energy, his feeling for splendour, his mastery over his craft, place him  almost on a level with the great Venetians of the sixteenth century,  although he never allows one to forget what he owes to them,  particularly to Veronese. The grand scenes he paints differ from those  of his predecessor not so much in mere inferiority of workmanship, as in  a lack of that simplicity and candour which never failed Paolo, no  matter how proud the event he might be portraying. Tiepolo's people are  haughty, as if they felt that to keep a firm hold on their dignity they  could not for a moment relax their faces and figures from a monumental  look and bearing. They evidently feel themselves so superior that they  are not pleasant to live with, although they carry themselves so well,  and are dressed with such splendour, that once in a while it is a great  pleasure to look at them. It was Tiepolo's vision of the world that was  at fault, and his vision of the world was at fault only because the  world itself was at fault. Paolo saw a world touched only by the  fashions of the Spanish Court, while Tiepolo lived among people whose  very hearts had been vitiated by its measureless haughtiness.    But Tiepolo's feeling for strength, for movement, and for colour was  great enough to give a new impulse to art. At times he seems not so much  the last of the old masters as the first of the new. The works he left  in Spain do more than a little to explain the revival of painting in  that country under Goya; and Goya, in his turn, had a great influence  upon many of the best French artists of our own times.      =XXVII. Influence of Venetian Art.=--Thus, Venetian painting before it  wholly died, flickered up again strong enough to light the torch that is  burning so steadily now. Indeed, not the least attraction of the  Venetian masters is their note of modernity, by which I mean the feeling  they give us that they were on the high road to the art of to-day. We  have seen how on two separate occasions Venetian painters gave an  impulse to Spaniards, who in turn have had an extraordinary influence on  modern painting. It would be easy, too, although it is not my purpose,  to show how much other schools of the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries, such as the Flemish, led by Rubens, and the English led by  Reynolds, owed to the Venetians. My endeavour has been to explain some  of the attractions of the school, and particularly to show its close  dependence upon the thought and feeling of the Renaissance. This is  perhaps its greatest interest, for being such a complete expression of  the riper spirit of the Renaissance, it helps us to a larger  understanding of a period which has in itself the fascination of youth,  and which is particularly attractive to us, because the spirit that  animates us is singularly like the better spirit of that epoch. We, too,  are possessed of boundless curiosity. We, too, have an almost  intoxicating sense of human capacity. We, too, believe in a great future  for humanity, and nothing has yet happened to check our delight in  discovery or our faith in life.          INDEX TO THE WORKS OF THE PRINCIPAL VENETIAN PAINTERS.      NOTE.    Public galleries are mentioned first, then private collections, and  churches last. The principal public gallery is always understood after  the simple mention of a city or town. Thus, Paris means Paris, Louvre,  London means London, National Gallery, etc.    An interrogation point after the number or title of a picture indicates  that its attribution to the given painter is doubtful.    Distinctly early or late works are marked E. or L.    It need scarcely be said that the attributions here given are not based  on official catalogues, and are often at variance with them.

Swayze openly boasted that he had been concerned in the abduction of  Morgan, and in the execution of Masonic vengeance upon him. He professed  to be able to indicate the precise spot where the body was buried--which  spot, he declared, was not far from the bottom of his garden. Upon  investigation these vainglorious boastings proved to be utterly without  any foundation in fact.    [10] Dickson had originally made Gourlay's acquaintance in 1810, when he  visited and spent a week with him at his farm in Wiltshire. See  Gourlay's _Statistical Account of Upper Canada,_ Vol. 2, p. 494.    [11] _General Introduction to Statistical Account of Upper Canada_, p.  ix.    [12] In these times there was but one jail delivery per annum in Upper  Canada.    [13] _Statistical Account_, Vol. II., p. 342. In a note to p. xv. of the  _General Introduction_, Mr. Gourlay says further: \"The jury in this case  was notoriously packed. To guard against the effects of this as much as  possible, I had, in the expectation of trial for libel, obtained lists  of inimical jurymen, and had people willing to appear in court to swear  that many of them had prejudged me openly, in the rancour of party  dispute. These lists were handed to me through the door, before and  during the assizes; but all caution and care forsook me in the time of  need.\"    [14] Referring to a letter written to attract sympathy to the case of  the editor of the Niagara _Spectator_, who had been imprisoned and  shamefully abused for publishing several of Mr. Gourlay's criticisms.  Some account of the persecution to which this gentleman was subjected  will be found on a future page.    [15] _Statistical Account_, Vol. 2, pp. 393, 394.    [16] _General Introduction_, p. xv.    [17] _General Introduction_, pp. ccviii., ccix., and note.    [18] The sheriff was Thomas Merritt, father of the gentleman who  afterwards became the Hon. William Hamilton Merritt, to whose  enterprise, more than to that of any other man, we owe the Welland  Canal. It is right to add that most of the subordinate duties of the  office of sheriff were discharged by an underling, and that Thomas  Merritt may have been personally free from blame in respect of Mr.  Gourlay. Assuming him to have been blamable, his son, the Hon. W. H.  Merritt, in after days, did his utmost to atone for it by espousing Mr.  Gourlay's cause in the Canadian Assembly, as will be seen by reference  to the Parliamentary debates of 1856, 1857 and 1858.    [19] _Statistical Account_, Vol. II., pp. 400, 401.    [20] Ib., p. 401.    [21] Mr. Gourlay was in error as to the date of the Duke's death. He  represents him as \"writhing in agony at the self same hour,\" and as  dying on the same day when he, Mr. Gourlay, crossed over into the United  States.--_Statistical Account_, vol. 2, p. 401. He was astray by exactly  a week. By reference to the precept of the court, I find that Mr.  Gourlay's trial took place on the day specified in the text--Friday, the  20th of August. He left the Province on the following day--Saturday, the  21st. The Duke's death took place on Saturday, the 28th.    It may perhaps be as well for me to refer here to a story which seems to  have obtained some currency, to the effect that the Duke of Richmond's  death was due, not to hydrophobia, but to delirium tremens. There is not  the shadow of truth in the story. The evidence as to the Duke's having  been bitten at Sorel by a tame fox; as to his showing the healed wound  on his thumb several weeks afterwards; as to his dread of water during  the day before his death, and as to all the circumstances attending that  tragical event, is as clear as evidence can very well be. Moreover, his  habits were by no means such as to lead to _mania a potu_. He was a _bon  vivant_, but, so far as I have been able to ascertain, he did not drink  to excess, and was always master of such brains as he possessed. His end  was one which his family might honestly mourn, and there was little in  his life, nothing in his death, of which they had any cause to feel  ashamed.    [22] \"Major-General\" D. McLeod, in his \"History of the Canadian  Insurrection,\" p. 75, incorrectly states that Ferguson \"died in jail  from extremely cruel usage.\"    [23] _Canadian Portrait Gallery_, Vol. III., pp. 240-256.          CHAPTER II.    A BILL OF PARTICULARS.      The course of bitter persecution sustained by Mr. Gourlay was really the  first remote germ of the Upper Canadian Rebellion. In making this  statement I would not be understood as asserting that Gourlay was the  first person to set himself up in opposition to authority in the  Province, or even that he was the first victim of Executive tyranny.  There had been more or less of dissatisfaction at the selfish and  one-sided policy of the Administration ever since shortly after the  departure of Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe in 1796. Between that date and  Mr. Gourlay's arrival in the Province several personages of some local  note had paid heavy penalties for daring to have opinions of their own.  Mr. Wyatt, the Surveyor-General, had been dismissed from office because  he had presumed to point out certain official irregularities, and  because he would not betray the trust reposed in him. Joseph Willcocks  had been goaded into treason by a long course of persecution. Judge  Thorpe had been driven from the country quite as effectually as Mr.  Gourlay, for no other reason than that he had persisted in holding up  official corruption to the public gaze. But none of these manifestations  of \"the oppressor's wrath, the proud man's contumely,\" had taken so deep  a hold upon the public mind as did the case of Mr. Gourlay. The injuries  inflicted upon him had been so cruel, the perversion of justice so vile,  that the public conscience received a shock from which it did not  recover during the existing generation. For the first time in Upper  Canada's history signs of an organized Opposition began to appear upon  the floor of the Assembly. Thenceforward the antagonism between the two  parties grew in intensity from year to year. In process of time the  Opposition frequently became the controlling power in the House. At a  later stage of its development it divided into two parts. One of these  constituted the moderate Reform Party of the Province. The other was  made up of the advanced Radical element, whence emanated the Rebellion  which forms the especial subject of the present work. All of which will  hereafter be narrated with greater amplitude of detail.    It has been intimated that traces of dissatisfaction began to be  apparent soon after Governor Simcoe's time. Upon his demission of  authority the direction of affairs devolved upon the Honourable Peter  Russell, as senior member of the Executive Council; and that gentleman  had not been long in authority before murmurs began to be heard about  the partial and defective administration of the important department of  Crown Lands. There were comparatively few men in the country possessed  of sufficient education and business experience to admit of their being  entrusted with the charge of public affairs; and where all the offices  were necessarily in the hands of a small number of persons, it was a  foregone conclusion that irregularities should creep in, and that  cliquishness and favouritism should prevail to a greater or less extent.  When Lieutenant-Governor Hunter arrived, in 1799, he found that certain  objectionable practices had become common, and that the foundation had  been laid of serious public evils. Greed and favouritism had obtained a  strong foothold, and scarcely any branch of the public service was  efficiently managed. The sin of covetousness was not confined to  subordinate officials, but included among its votaries some of the  highest dignitaries of the Province. It would seem that President  Russell himself had an itching palm, and that his individual interests  were carefully watched over during his temporary administration of  affairs. Everybody has heard how he made grants of public lands from  himself to himself,[24] thereby violating one of the most cherished  maxims of English jurisprudence. Lieutenant-Governor Hunter, in a letter  written to a friend in England soon after his arrival at York, refers to  P. R.--by whom Mr. Russell is clearly indicated--as \"an avaricious one.\"  In a subsequent part of the same epistle he adds: \"So far as depended  upon him [Mr. Russell] he would grant land to the de'il and all his  family as good Loyalists, if they would only pay the fees.\" During  Governor Hunter's own term of office, though there is no evidence of  corruption or double-dealing on his own part, abuses continued to exist,  and dishonesty too often stared honesty out of countenance. During the  _regime_ of his successor, Commodore Grant, these abuses grew steadily,  both in number and in bulk; and during Francis Gore's long though  interrupted administration, they reached a height which called aloud for  redress.    And here it is desirable to enquire into the specific nature of the  manifold evils which enriched a few at the expense of the many; which  endowed a venal and corrupt clique with a practical monopoly of  political and social power; which sowed the deadly seed of factious  strife, and stemmed the tide of Upper Canadian prosperity.    Theoretically speaking, the constitution granted to Upper Canada by the  Act of 1791 was not unfairly represented by Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe  as being \"the very image and transcript of that of Great Britain.\"[25]  We had a Legislative Council, the members whereof were appointed by the  Crown for life. This body bore some resemblance to the British House of  Lords. Next, we had a Legislative Assembly, the members whereof were  periodically elected by the"]]]
