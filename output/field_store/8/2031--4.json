THE RELATION OF THE ARCHAIC PEDIMENT           RELIEFS FROM THE ACROPOLIS TO           VASE-PAINTING.             [PLATE I.]               From one point of view it is a misfortune in the study of           archæology that, with the progress of excavation, fresh           discoveries are continually being made. If only the evidence of           the facts were all in, the case might be summed up and a final           judgment pronounced on points in dispute. As it is, the ablest           scholar must feel cautious about expressing a decided opinion;           for the whole fabric of his argument may be overturned any day           by the unearthing of a fragment of pottery or a sculptured           head. Years ago, it was easy to demonstrate the absurdity of           any theory of polychrome decoration. The few who dared to           believe that the Greek temple was not in every part as white as           the original marble subjected themselves to the pitying scorn           of their fellows. Only the discoveries of recent years have           brought proof too positive to be gainsaid. The process of           unlearning and throwing over old and cherished notions is           always hard; perhaps it has been especially so in archæology.             The thorough investigation of the soil and rock of the           Acropolis lately finished by the Greek Government has brought           to light so much that is new and strange that definite           explanations and conclusions are still far away. The           pediment-reliefs in poros which now occupy the second and third           rooms of the Acropolis Museum have already been somewhat fully           treated, especially in their architectural bearings. Dr.  Page 29  Brückner of the German Institute has written a full monograph           on the subject,[36] and it has also been fully treated by           Lechat in the _Revue Archeologique_.[37] Shorter papers have           appeared in the _Mittheilungen_ by Studniczka[38] and P.J.           Meier.[39] Dr. Waldstein in a recent peripatetic lecture           suggested a new point of view in the connection between these           reliefs and Greek vase-paintings. It is this suggestion that I           have tried to follow out.             The groups in question are too well known to need a detailed           description here. The first,[40] in a fairly good state of           preservation, represents Herakles in his conflict with the           Hydra, and at the left Iolaos, his charioteer, as a spectator.           Corresponding to this, is the second group,[41] with Herakles           overpowering the Triton; but the whole of this is so damaged           that it is scarcely recognizable. Then there are two larger           pediments in much higher relief, the one[42] repeating the           scene of Herakles and the Triton, the other[43] representing           the three-headed Typhon in conflict, as supposed, with Zeus.           All four of these groups have been reconstructed from a great           number of fragments. Many more pieces which are to be seen in           these two rooms of the Museum surely belonged to the original           works, though their relations and position cannot be           determined. The circumstances of their discovery between the           south supporting-wall of the Parthenon and Kimon's inner           Acropolis wall make it certain that we are dealing with           pre-Persian art. It is quite as certain, in spite of the           fragmentary condition of the remains, that they were pedimental           compositions and the earliest of the kind yet known.

We might say that in vases we have practically           the first products of Greek art; and further we might show           resemblances, more or less material, between these archaic           reliefs and vase pictures. But the proof of any connection           between the two would still be wanting. Here the discoveries  Page 30  made by the Germans at Olympia and confirmed by later           researches in Sicily and Magna Graecia, are of the utmost           importance.[44] In the Byzantine west wall at Olympia were           found great numbers of painted terracotta plates[45] which           examination proved to have covered the cornices of the Geloan           Treasury.

Currently,  there are 42 treaty member nations: 26 consultative and 16 acceding.  Consultative (voting) members include the seven nations that claim  portions of Antarctica as national territory (some claims overlap) and  19 nonclaimant nations. The US and some other nations that have made  no claims have reserved the right to do so. The US does not recognize  the claims of others. The year in parentheses indicates when an  acceding nation was voted to full consultative (voting) status, while  no date indicates the country was an original 1959 treaty signatory.  Claimant nations are-Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand,  Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant consultative nations are-Belgium,  Brazil (1983), China (1985), Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989), Germany  (1981), India (1983), Italy (1987), Japan, South Korea (1989),  Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989), Poland (1977), South Africa, Spain  (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay (1985), the US, and Russia.

Some US laws directly apply to  Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C.  section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties for the  following activities, unless authorized by regulation of statute: the  taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of nonindigenous  plants and animals; entry into specially protected or scientific  areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the importation  into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation of the  Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in fines  and one year in prison. The Departments of Treasury, Commerce,  Transportation, and Interior share enforcement responsibilities.  Public Law 95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, requires  expeditions from the US to Antarctica to notify, in advance, the  Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room 5801, Department of State,  Washington, DC 20520, which reports such plans to other nations as  required by the Antarctic Treaty.
