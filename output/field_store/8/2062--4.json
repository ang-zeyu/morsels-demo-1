Upon his return to the house, he went around on the valley side, so as  to see the place by light of day.  His father had built for permanence;  and evidently there had been three constructive periods in the history  of that long, substantial, picturesque log house. But few nails and  little sawed lumber and no glass had been used. Strong and skillful  hands, axes and a crosscut saw, had been the prime factors in erecting  this habitation of the Isbels.    \"Good mawnin', son,\" called a cheery voice from the porch.  \"Shore  we-all heard you shoot; an' the crack of that forty-four was as welcome  as May flowers.\"    Bill Isbel looked up from a task over a saddle girth and inquired  pleasantly if Jean ever slept of nights.  Guy Isbel laughed and there  was warm regard in the gaze he bent on Jean.    \"You old Indian!\" he drawled, slowly.  \"Did you get a bead on anythin'?\"    \"No.  I shot to scare away what I found to be some of your lofers,\"  replied Jean.  \"I heard them pullin' down a calf.  An' I found tracks  of two whoppin' big wolves.  I found the dead calf, too.  Reckon the  meat can be saved.  Dad, you must lose a lot of stock here.\"    \"Wal, son, you shore hit the nail on the haid,\" replied the rancher.  \"What with lions an' bears an' lofers--an' two-footed lofers of another  breed--I've lost five thousand dollars in stock this last year.\"    \"Dad!  You don't mean it!\" exclaimed Jean, in astonishment. To him that  sum represented a small fortune.    \"I shore do,\" answered his father.    Jean shook his head as if he could not understand such an enormous loss  where there were keen able-bodied men about.  \"But that's awful, dad.  How could it happen?  Where were your herders an' cowboys? An' Bill an'  Guy?\"    Bill Isbel shook a vehement fist at Jean and retorted in earnest,  having manifestly been hit in a sore spot.  \"Where was me an' Guy, huh?  Wal, my Oregon brother, we was heah, all year, sleepin' more or less  aboot three hours out of every twenty-four--ridin' our boots off--an'  we couldn't keep down that loss.\"    \"Jean, you-all have a mighty tumble comin' to you out heah,\" said Guy,  complacently.    \"Listen, son,\" spoke up the rancher.  \"You want to have some hunches  before you figure on our troubles.  There's two or three packs of  lofers, an' in winter time they are hell to deal with.  Lions thick as  bees, an' shore bad when the snow's on.  Bears will kill a cow now an'  then.  An' whenever an' old silvertip comes mozyin' across from the  Mazatzals he kills stock.  I'm in with half a dozen cattlemen. We all  work together, an' the whole outfit cain't keep these vermints down.  Then two years ago the Hash Knife Gang come into the Tonto.\"    \"Hash Knife Gang?  What a pretty name!\" replied Jean.  \"Who're they?\"    \"Rustlers, son.  An' shore the real old Texas brand.  The old Lone Star  State got too hot for them, an' they followed the trail of a lot of  other Texans who needed a healthier climate.  Some two hundred Texans  around heah, Jean, an' maybe a matter of three hundred inhabitants in  the Tonto all told, good an' bad.  Reckon it's aboot half an' half.\"    A cheery call from the kitchen interrupted the conversation of the men.    \"You come to breakfast.\"    During the meal the old rancher talked to Bill and Guy about the day's  order of work; and from this Jean gathered an idea of what a big cattle  business his father conducted.  After breakfast Jean's brothers  manifested keen interest in the new rifles.  These were unwrapped and  cleaned and taken out for testing.  The three rifles were forty-four  calibre Winchesters, the kind of gun Jean had found most effective. He  tried them out first, and the shots he made were satisfactory to him  and amazing to the others.  Bill had used an old Henry rifle. Guy did  not favor any particular rifle.  The rancher pinned his faith to the  famous old single-shot buffalo gun, mostly called needle gun. \"Wal,  reckon I'd better stick to mine.  Shore you cain't teach an old dog new  tricks.  But you boys may do well with the forty-fours. Pack 'em on  your saddles an' practice when you see a coyote.\"    Jean found it difficult to convince himself that this interest in guns  and marksmanship had any sinister propulsion back of it.  His father  and brothers had always been this way.  Rifles were as important to  pioneers as plows, and their skillful use was an achievement every  frontiersman tried to attain.  Friendly rivalry had always existed  among the members of the Isbel family: even Ann Isbel was a good shot.  But such proficiency in the use of firearms--and life in the open that  was correlative with it--had not dominated them as it had Jean. Bill  and Guy Isbel were born cattlemen--chips of the old block. Jean began  to hope that his father's letter was an exaggeration, and particularly  that the fatalistic speech of last night, \"they are goin' to kill me,\"  was just a moody inclination to see the worst side. Still, even as Jean  tried to persuade himself of this more hopeful view, he recalled many  references to the peculiar reputation of Texans for gun-throwing, for  feuds, for never-ending hatreds.  In Oregon the Isbels had lived among  industrious and peaceful pioneers from all over the States; to be sure,  the life had been rough and primitive, and there had been fights on  occasions, though no Isbel had ever killed a man.  But now they had  become fixed in a wilder and sparsely settled country among men of  their own breed.  Jean was afraid his hopes had only sentiment to  foster them.  Nevertheless, be forced back a strange, brooding, mental  state and resolutely held up the brighter side.  Whatever the evil  conditions existing in Grass Valley, they could be met with  intelligence and courage, with an absolute certainty that it was  inevitable they must pass away.  Jean refused to consider the old,  fatal law that at certain wild times and wild places in the West  certain men had to pass away to change evil conditions.    \"Wal, Jean, ride around the range with the boys,\" said the rancher.  \"Meet some of my neighbors, Jim Blaisdell, in particular.  Take a look  at the cattle.  An' pick out some hosses for yourself.\"    \"I've seen one already,\" declared Jean, quickly.  \"A black with white  face.  I'll take him.\"    \"Shore you know a hoss.  To my eye he's my pick.  But the boys don't  agree.  Bill 'specially has degenerated into a fancier of pitchin'  hosses.  Ann can ride that black.  You try him this mawnin'.... An',  son, enjoy yourself.\"    True to his first impression, Jean named the black horse Whiteface and  fell in love with him before ever he swung a leg over him. Whiteface  appeared spirited, yet gentle.  He had been trained instead of being  broken.  Of hard hits and quirts and spurs he had no experience.  He  liked to do what his rider wanted him to do.    A hundred or more horses grazed in the grassy meadow, and as Jean rode  on among them it was a pleasure to see stallions throw heads and ears  up and whistle or snort.  Whole troops of colts and two-year-olds raced  with flying tails and manes.    Beyond these pastures stretched the range, and Jean saw the gray-green  expanse speckled by thousands of cattle.  The scene was inspiring.  Jean's brothers led him all around, meeting some of the herders and  riders employed on the ranch, one of whom was a burly, grizzled man  with eyes reddened and narrowed by much riding in wind and sun and  dust. His name was Evans and he was father of the lad whom Jean had met  near the village.  Everts was busily skinning the calf that had been  killed by the wolves.  \"See heah, y'u Jean Isbel,\" said Everts, \"it  shore was aboot time y'u come home.  We-all heahs y'u hev an eye fer  tracks. Wal, mebbe y'u can kill Old Gray, the lofer thet did this job.  He's pulled down nine calves as' yearlin's this last two months thet I  know of.  An' we've not hed the spring round-up.\"    Grass Valley widened to the southeast.  Jean would have been backward  about estimating the square miles in it.  Yet it was not vast acreage  so much as rich pasture that made it such a wonderful range.  Several  ranches lay along the western slope of this section.  Jean was informed  that open parks and swales, and little valleys nestling among the  foothills, wherever there was water and grass, had been settled by  ranchers.  Every summer a few new families ventured in.    Blaisdell struck Jean as being a lionlike type of Texan, both in his  broad, bold face, his huge head with its upstanding tawny hair like a  mane, and in the speech and force that betokened the nature of his  heart.  He was not as old as Jean's father.  He had a rolling voice,  with the same drawling intonation characteristic of all Texans, and  blue eyes that still held the fire of youth.  Quite a marked contrast  he presented to the lean, rangy, hard-jawed, intent-eyed men Jean had  begun to accept as Texans.    Blaisdell took time for a curious scrutiny and study of Jean, that,  frank and kindly as it was, and evidently the adjustment of impressions  gotten from hearsay, yet bespoke the attention of one used to judging  men for himself, and in this particular case having reasons of his own  for so doing.    \"Wal, you're like your sister Ann,\" said Blaisdell.  \"Which you may  take as a compliment, young man.  Both of you favor your mother. But  you're an Isbel.  Back in Texas there are men who never wear a glove on  their right hands, an' shore I reckon if one of them met up with you  sudden he'd think some graves had opened an' he'd go for his gun.\"    Blaisdell's laugh pealed out with deep, pleasant roll.  Thus he planted  in Jean's sensitive mind a significant thought-provoking idea about the  past-and-gone Isbels.    His further remarks, likewise, were exceedingly interesting to Jean.  The settling of the Tonto Basin by Texans was a subject"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20709"],[0,"From Pole to Pole: A Book for Young People (#10)"],[1,"ive. Last year they yielded about eight million  tons of raw petroleum, some of them having sometimes given nearly 300  tons in twenty-four hours by pumping, and 2000 when the oil shot out  of the ground itself. The value on the spot is now about 20 shillings  a ton. The deepest boring is sunk 2800 feet into the earth.    [Illustration: PLATE III. OIL-WELL AT BALAKHANI.    A fountain of oil forced up by natural pressure.]    Late one evening in February, 1886, the dreadful cry of \"Fire! Fire!\"  was heard outside our house. The very thought of fire is enough to raise  terror and consternation throughout this oil-soaked district. We hurry  out and find the whole neighbourhood illuminated with a weird, whitish  light, as bright as day. The derricks stand out like ghosts against the  light background. We make for the place and feel the heat increasing.  Bright white flames shoot up fantastically into the air, sending off  black clouds of smoke. One derrick is in flames and beside it a pool of  raw petroleum is burning. A Tatar had gone to the derrick with a lantern  to fetch a tool. He lost his lantern, and only just escaped with his  life before the oil-soaked derrick took fire.    It is vain to fight against such a fire. The fire-engine came, and all  the hoses were at work, but what was the use when the jets of water were  turned to steam before they reached the burning surface of the oil pool?  The chief thing is to keep the fire from spreading, and if that is done,  the oil is left to bubble and burn until not a drop is left.      ACROSS PERSIA    It was an adventurous journey that I commenced from Baku on April 6,  1886. I had a travelling companion, a young Tatar, Baki Khanoff, about  L30 in my pocket, two changes of clothes and underclothing, a warm  coat, and a rug--all, except what I wore, packed in a Tatar bag. In a  small leather bag suspended by a strap from the shoulder I kept a  revolver, a sketch-book, a note-book, and two maps of Persia. Baki  Khanoff had a large cloak, a silver-mounted gun, and a dagger. Half the  money we had was sewed up in belts round our waists. The equipment was  therefore small for a journey of 2000 miles, through Persia and back.    For two days and a night we were compelled by a violent storm on the  Caspian Sea to wait on board before the vessel could take us to the  Persian coast. As soon as we landed we were surrounded by Persians, who,  with loud voices and lively gestures, extolled the good qualities of  their horses. After a cursory examination we chose two small, squat  steeds, secured our baggage behind the saddles, mounted, and rode  through dark woods and fragrant olive groves higher and higher towards  the Elburz Mountains.    We passed a night up on the heights in a village called Karzan. When we  set out next day it was snowing fast, and had snowed so thickly all  night that all the country was buried under deep drifts. We muffled  ourselves up as well as we could, mounted our horses, and rode on,  accompanied by their owner.    The snow fell silently in large, whirling flakes. Down in the valley it  melted off our clothes, but higher up on the open, windy heights it  froze to a cake of ice, and before long our clothes on the windward side  were converted into a thick cuirass which prevented every movement. At  last we were practically frozen fast in the saddle. Our hands were  benumbed, the reins fell on the horses' necks, our eyes were sore from  the snowstorm which dashed straight into our faces. I was so stiff that  I lost all feeling in my arms and legs, tumbled off my horse, and went  on foot, but I had to hold on to the animal's tail lest I should lose my  way in the blinding snow.    We could not go on long in this way, for we could not see where we were  going, so we decided to turn in at the first village on the road. Some  squalid huts soon came in sight through the snow. Outside one of them we  tied up our horses, shook off the snow, and entered a dark cabin with an  earthen floor. Here a large fire was lighted, and we sat down beside it  in a close circle with some other travellers who arrived at the same  time. The place had a low roof and was small, damp, and full of vermin,  but at any rate it was pleasant to warm ourselves and dry our clothes.  When Baki Khanoff had made tea, cooked eggs, and brought out bread and  salt, it was almost cosy. The company consisted of four Tatars, two  Persians, and myself, and the seven of us had to share the space for the  night. When the fire died down the close heat was succeeded by a damp  coolness, but at twenty-one years of age one is not particular.    Eventually we reached Teheran, the capital of Persia, safe and sound,  and there I stayed a short time as the guest of a fellow-countryman.  When I continued my journey southwards I had to travel alone, for Baki  Khanoff had caught fever and had to turn back to Baku.    Our journey to Teheran had been very expensive, but my good countryman  replenished my purse, so that I had again about L30 sewed up in my  waistbelt when I started off once more on April 27. The road is divided  by stations where horses are changed and you can pass the night if you  wish. A man accompanies you on every stage, and for a small silver coin  you can buy eggs and bread, a chicken, melons and grapes.    Sometimes the stable-boy who accompanies a traveller takes the best  horse for himself and gives the other to the traveller. This happened to  me on the road between the town of Kashan and the mountain village of  Kuhrud. As soon as I became aware of the trick, I exchanged horses with  my attendant, who dropped behind after some hours' journey, for his  sorry jade could go no farther. For four hours I rode along narrow paths  in complete darkness. I feared that I had gone astray, and, tired and  sleepy, I was on the point of coming to a halt, intending to tie the  horse to a tree and roll myself up in my rug for the night, when I saw a  light gleam through the darkness. \"Hurrah! that is the station-house of  Kuhrud.\" But when I came nearer I perceived that the light came from a  nomad's tent. I rode up and called out to the people. No one answered,  but I could see by the shadows on the cloth that the tent was inhabited.  After shouting again without receiving an answer, I tied up the horse,  lifted up the tent-flap, and asked my way to Kuhrud. \"Cannot one sleep  in peace in the middle of the night?\" came a voice from inside. \"I am a  European and you must show me the way,\" I returned sharply. Then a man  came out; he was as silent as a dummy, but I understood that I was to  follow him, leading my horse by the rein. He wound about in the dark  among bushes, and when he had led me to a brook a foot deep, skirted on  both sides by thick olive woods, he pointed uphill and vanished in the  darkness without saying a word. I mounted again and let the horse take  care of himself, and two hours later he stopped all right before the  station-house. It was pleasant to have reached my journey's end at last,  for I had been riding for fifteen hours, and the evening meal tasted  better than usual. Then I lay down full length on the floor, with the  saddle for a pillow and the rug over me. I made use of no other bed on  this journey.    A few days more on the great caravan road and we rode into the old  capital of Persia, Ispahan, with its many memorials of departed  greatness, its mosques with tall, graceful minarets, and its bazaars  full of the products of Persian handicrafts and industries--carpets,  silken materials, embroideries, shawls, lacquered work, water-pipes,  porcelain, and bronze vessels representing peacocks and elephants.    Farther south I came to Persepolis, so famous in ancient times, where  the great Persian kings, Xerxes and Darius, had their palaces. The  country round about is now inhabited only by some poor shepherds and  their flocks, but fine remains of the palaces still stand, in spite of  the 2400 years which have passed over them. Not far from Persepolis lies  one of the most noted towns of Persia, Shiraz, abounding in rose gardens  and country-houses, spring water and canals. The town is famous above  all, because here the immortal poets of Persia sang their most beautiful  songs.    When we came near the Persian Gulf the climate became hotter, and one  day the temperature was 102 deg. in the room where I was staying. People  therefore travel in the night. On the last stage the groom, who was an  old man, could not keep up with me, for I rode fast; so I went on all  night alone, keeping my revolver handy in case robbers showed  themselves. I was glad when the sun rose, lighting up the smooth mirror  of the Persian Gulf, and on May 22 I arrived at the town of Bushire, on  its eastern coast.    The Persian Gulf is an inlet of the Indian Ocean, and is enclosed  between Persia and Arabia. The island of Bahrein on the Arabian coast is  well known; it is under British protection, and here in summer and  autumn pearl fishing is carried on, the annual export of these beautiful  precious stones being now about L900,000. As many as a thousand boats,  with crews of thirty thousand men, are engaged in the industry. The  owner of each boat engages a number of divers, who work for him, and he  sells his pearls to the Indian markets. The diver seldom goes down to a  greater depth than seven fathoms, and remains at most fifty seconds  under water. He has wax in his ears, his nose is closed by a clip, and  with a stone at his feet and a rope round his waist he jumps overboard  and disappears into the depths. When he reaches the bottom of the sea he  gathers into a basket tied in front of him as many shells as he can get  hold of, and at a given signal is hauled up by the rope to the surface  again. Then the owner of the boat opens the shells and takes out the  costly pearls, which are of different values, according to their size  and other qualities.      ARABIA    Between the"]]]
