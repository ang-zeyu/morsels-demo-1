I might add, that I have not found  that from Venetian Talck (I say Venetian, because I have found other  kinds of that Mineral more open) from the _Lapis Ossifragus_, (which  the Shops call _Ostiocolla_) from _Muscovia_ Glass, from pure and  Fusible Sand, to mention now no other Concretes; those of my  Acquaintance that have try'd have been able by the Fire to separate  any one of the Hypostatical Principles, which you will the less  scruple to believe, if you consider that Glass may be made by the bare  Colliquation of the Salt and Earth remaining in the Ashes of a burnt  Plant, and that yet common Glass, once made, does so far resist the  violence of the Fire, that most Chymists think it a Body more  undestroyable then Gold it self. For if the Artificer can so firmly  unite such comparative gross Particles as those of Earth and Salt that  make up common Ashes, into a Body indissoluble by Fire; why may not  Nature associate in divers Bodies the more minute Elementary  Corpuscles she has at hand too firmly to let them be separable by the  Fire? And on this Occasion, _Eleutherius_, give me leave to mention to  you two or three sleight Experiments, which will, I hope, be found  more pertinent to our present Discourse, than at first perhaps they  will appear. The first is, that, having (for Tryals sake) put a  quantity of that Fugitive Concrete, Camphire, into a Glass Vessel, and  plac'd it in a gentle Heat, I found it (not leaving behinde, according  to my Estimate, not so much as one Grain) to sublime to the Top of the  Vessel into Flowers: which in Whiteness, Smell, &c. seem'd not to  differ from the Camphire it self. Another Experiment is that of  _Helmont_, who in several places affirms, That a Coal kept in a Glass  exactly clos'd will never be calcin'd to Ashes, though kept never so  long in a strong Fire. To countenance which I shall tell you this  Tryal of my own, That having sometimes distilled some Woods, as  particularly Box, whilst our _Caput mortuum_ remain'd in the Retort,  it continued black like Charcoal, though the Retort were Earthen, and  kept red-hot in a vehement Fire; but as soon as ever it was brought  out of the candent Vessel into the open Air, the burning Coals did  hastily degenerate or fall asunder, without the Assistance of any new  Calcination, into pure white Ashes. And to these two I shall add but  this obvious and known Observation, that common Sulphur (if it be pure  and freed from its Vinager) being leasurely sublim'd in close Vessels,  rises into dry Flowers, which may be presently melted into a Bodie of  the same Nature with that which afforded them. Though if Brimstone be  burnt in the open Air it gives, you know, a penetrating Fume, which  being caught in a Glass-Bell condenses into that acid Liquor called  Oyl of Sulphur _per Campanam_. The use I would make of these  Experiments collated with what I lately told you out of _Agricola_ is  this, That even among the Bodies that are not fixt, there are divers  of such a Texture, that it will be hard to make it appear, how the  Fire, as Chymists are wont to imploy it, can resolve them into  Elementary Substances. For some Bodies being of such a Texture that  the Fire can drive them into the cooler and less hot part of the  Vessels wherein they are included, and if need be, remove them from  place to place to fly the greatest heat, more easily than it can  divorce their Elements (especially without the Assistance of the Air)  we see that our Chymists cannot Analyze them in close Vessels, and of  other compound Bodies the open Fire can as little separate the  Elements. For what can a naked Fire do to Analyze a mixt Bodie, if its  component Principles be so minute, and so strictly united, that the  Corpuscles of it need less heat to carry them up, than is requisite to  divide them into their Principles. So that of some Bodies the Fire  cannot in close Vessels make any _Analysis_ at all, and others will in  the open Air fly away in the Forms of Flowers or Liquors, before the  Heat can prove able to divide them into their Principles. And this may  hold, whether the various similar parts of a Concrete be combin'd by  Nature or by Art; For in factitious _Sal Armoniack_ we finde the  common and the Urinous Salts so well mingled, that both in the open  Fire, and in subliming Vessels they rise together as one Salt, which  seems in such Vessels irresoluble by Fire alone. For I can shew you  _Sal Armoniack_ which after the ninth Sublimation does still retain  its compounded Nature. And indeed I scarce know any one Mineral, from  which by Fire alone Chymists are wont to sever any Substance simple  enough to deserve the name of an Element or Principle. For though out  of native Cinnaber they distill Quicksilver, and though from many of  those Stones that the Ancients called _Pyrites_ they sublime  Brimstone, yet both that Quicksilver and this Sulphur being very often  the same with the common Minerals that are sold in the Shops under  those names, are themselves too much compounded Bodies to pass for the  Elements of such. And thus much, _Eleutherius_, for the Second  Argument that belongs to my First Consideration; the others I shall  the lesse insist on, because I have dwelt so long upon this.    [Footnote 3: _Agricola_ de Natura Fossil. Lib. 9. Cap. 11. & 12.]    Proceed we then in the next place to consider, That there are divers  Separations to be made by other means, which either cannot at all, or  else cannot so well be made by the Fire alone. When Gold and Silver  are melted into one Mass, it would lay a great Obligation upon  Refiners and Goldsmiths to teach them the Art of separating them by  the Fire, without the trouble and charge they are fain to be at to  sever them. Whereas they may be very easily parted by the Affusion of  Spirit of Nitre or _Aqua fortis_ (which the French therefore call _Eau  de Depart_:) so likewise the Metalline part of Vitriol will not be so  easily and conveniently separated from the Saline part even by a  violent Fire, as by the Affusion of certain Alkalizate Salts in a  liquid Form upon the Solution of Vitriol made in common water. For  thereby the acid Salt of the Vitriol, leaving the Copper it had  corroded to joyn with the added Salts, the Metalline part will be  precipitated to the bottom almost like Mud. And that I may not give  Instances only in De-compound Bodies, I will add a not useless one of  another kinde. Not only Chymists have not been able (for ought is  vulgarly known) by Fire alone to separate true Sulphur from Antimony;  but though you may finde in their Books many plausible Processes of  Extracting it, yet he that shall make as many fruitlesse Tryals as I  have done to obtain it by, most of them will, I suppose, be easily  perswaded, that the Productions of such Processes are Antimonial  Sulphurs rather in Name than Nature. But though Antimony sublim'd by  its self is reduc'd but to a volatile Powder, or Antimonial Flowers,  of a compounded Nature like the Mineral that affords them: yet I  remember that some years ago I sublim'd out of Antimony a Sulphur, and  that in greater plenty then ever I saw obtain'd from that Mineral, by  a Method which I shall therefore acquaint you with, because Chymists  seem not to have taken notice of what Importance such Experiments may  be in the Indagation of the Nature, and especially of the Number of  the Elements. Having then purposely for Tryals sake digested eight  Ounces of good and well powder'd Antimony with twelve Ounces of Oyl of  Vitriol in a well stopt Glas-Vessel for about six or seven Weeks; and  having caus'd the Mass (grown hard and brittle) to be distill'd in a  Retort plac'd in Sand, with a strong Fire; we found the Antimony to be  so opened, or alter'd by the _Menstruum_ wherewith it had been  digested, That whereas crude Antimony, forc'd up by the Fire, arises  only in Flowers, our Antimony thus handled afforded us partly in the  Receiver, and partly in the Neck and at the Top of the Retort, about  an Ounce of Sulphur, yellow and brittle like common Brimstone, and of  so Sulphureous a smell, that upon the unluting the Vessels it infected  the Room with a scarce supportable stink. And this Sulphur, besides  the Colour and Smell, had the perfect Inflamability of common  Brimstone, and would immediately kindle (at the Flame of a Candle) and  burn blew like it. And though it seem'd that the long digestion  wherein our Antimony and _Menstruum_ were detain'd, did conduce to the  better unlocking of the Mineral, yet if you have not the leasure to  make so long a Digestion, you may by incorporating with powder'd  Antimony a convenient Quantity of Oyl of Vitriol, and committing them  immediately to Distillation, obtain a little Sulphur like unto the  common one, and more combustible than perhaps you will at first take  notice of. For I have observ'd, that though (after its being first  kindled) the Flame would sometimes go out too soon of its self, if the  same Lump of Sulphur were held again to the Flame of a Candle, it  would be rekindled and burn a pretty while, not only after the  second, but after the third or fourth accension. You, to whom I think  I shewed my way of discovering something of Sulphureous in Oyl of  Vitriol, may perchance suspect, _Eleutherius_, either that this  Substance was some Venereal Sulphur that lay hid in that Liquor, and  was by this operation only reduc'd into a manifest Body; or else that  it was a compound of the unctuous parts of the Antimony, and the  Saline ones of the Vitriol, in regard that (as _Gunther_[4] informs  us) divers learned men would have Sulphur to be nothing but a mixture  made in the Bowels of the Earth of Vitriolate Spirits and a certain  combustible Substance. But the Quantity of Sulphur we obtain'd by  Digestion was much too great to have been latent in the Oyl of  Vitriol. And that Vitriolate Spirits "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22925"],[0,"The Story of Young Abraham Lincoln (#10)"],[1,"his evenings in Jones' grocery \"talking politics\" and  other things with the men, who also gathered there. Mr. Jones took a  Louisville paper, which young Lincoln read eagerly. Slavery was a live  political topic then, and Abe soon acquired quite a reputation as a  stump orator.    As he read the \"Indiana Statutes\" he was supposed to \"know more law than  the constable.\" In fact, his taste for the law was so pronounced at that  early age that he went, sometimes, fifteen miles to Boonville, as a  spectator in the county court. Once he heard a lawyer of ability, named  Breckinridge, defend an accused murderer there. It was a great plea; the  tall country boy knew it and, pushing through the crowd, reached out his  long, coatless arm to congratulate the lawyer, who looked at the awkward  youth in amazement and passed on without acknowledging Abe's compliment.  The two men met again in Washington, more than thirty years later, under  very different circumstances.    But there were things other than politics discussed at the country  store, and Abe Lincoln often raised a laugh at the expense of some  braggart or bully. There was \"Uncle Jimmy\" Larkins, who posed as the  hero of his own stories. In acknowledgment of Abe's authority as a  judge of horse flesh, \"Uncle Jimmy\" was boasting of his horse's  superiority in a recent fox chase. But young Lincoln seemed to pay no  heed. Larkins repeated:    \"Abe, I've got the best horse in the world; he won the race and never  drew a long breath.\"    Young Lincoln still appeared not to be paying attention. \"Uncle Jimmy\"  persisted. He was bound to make Abe hear. He reiterated:    \"I say, Abe, I have got the best horse in the world; after all that  running he never drew a long breath.\"    \"Well, Larkins,\" drawled young Lincoln, \"why don't you tell us how many  _short_ breaths he drew.\" The laugh was on the boastful and discomfited  Larkins.      TRYING TO TEACH ASTRONOMY TO A YOUNG GIRL    Abe's efforts were not always so well received, for he was sometimes  misunderstood. The neighbors used to think the Lincoln boy was secretly  in love with Kate Roby, the pretty girl he had helped out of a dilemma  in the spelling class. Several years after that episode, Abe and Kate  were sitting on a log, about sunset, talking:    \"Abe,\" said Kate, \"the sun's goin' down.\"    \"Reckon not,\" Abe answered, \"we're coming up, that's all.\"    \"Don't you s'pose I got eyes?\"    \"Yes, I know you have; but it's the earth that goes round. The sun  stands as still as a tree. When we're swung round so we can't see it any  more, the light's cut off and we call it night.\"    \"What a fool you are, Abe Lincoln!\" exclaimed Kate, who was not to blame  for her ignorance, for astronomy had never been taught in Crawford's  school.      THE EARLY DEATH OF SISTER NANCY    While brother and sister were working for \"Old Blue Nose,\" Aaron  Grigsby, \"Nat's\" brother, was \"paying attention\" to Nancy Lincoln. They  were soon married. Nancy was only eighteen. When she was nineteen Mrs.  Aaron Grigsby died. Her love for Abe had almost amounted to idolatry. In  some ways she resembled him. He, in turn, was deeply devoted to his only  sister.    The family did not stay long at Pigeon Creek after the loss of Nancy,  who was buried, not beside her mother, but with the Grigsbys in the  churchyard of the old Pigeon Creek meeting-house.      EARNING HIS FIRST DOLLAR    Much as Abraham Lincoln had \"worked out\" as a hired man, his father kept  the money, as he had a legal right to do, not giving the boy any of the  results of his hard labor, for, strong as he was, his pay was only  twenty-five or thirty cents a day. Abe accepted this as right and  proper. He never complained of it.    After he became President, Lincoln told his Secretary of State the  following story of the first dollar he ever had for his own:    \"Seward,\" he said, \"did you ever hear how I earned my first dollar?\"  \"No,\" replied Seward. \"Well,\" said he, \"I was about eighteen years of  age . . . and had constructed a flatboat. . . . A steamer was going down  the river. We have, you know, no wharves on the western streams, and  the custom was, if passengers were at any of the landings they had to  go out in a boat, the steamer stopping and taking them on board. I  was contemplating my new boat, and wondering whether I could make it  stronger or improve it in any part, when two men with trunks came down  to the shore in carriages, and looking at the different boats, singled  out mine, and asked:    \"'Who owns this?'    \"I answered modestly, 'I do.'    \"'Will you,' said one of them, 'take us and our trunks out to the  steamer?'    \"'Certainly,' said I. I was very glad to have a chance of earning  something, and supposed that they would give me a couple of 'bits.' The  trunks were put in my boat, the passengers seated themselves on them,  and I sculled them out to the steamer. They got on board, and I lifted  the trunks and put them on deck. The steamer was moving away when I  called out:    \"'You have forgotten to pay me.'    \"Each of them took from his pocket a silver half-dollar and threw it on  the bottom of my boat. I could scarcely believe my eyes as I picked up  the money. You may think it was a very little thing, and in these days  it seems to me like a trifle, but it was a most important incident in my  life. I could scarcely credit that I, a poor boy, had earned a dollar in  less than a day--that by honest work I had earned a dollar. I was a more  hopeful and thoughtful boy from that time.\"          CHAPTER VIII    MOVING TO ILLINOIS      \"FOLLOWING THE RIVER\"    Thomas Lincoln had become restless again. Fourteen years was a long time  for him to live in one place. Abe was seven years old when they came  over from Kentucky, and he was now nearly twenty-one. During that time  Thomas had lost his wife, Nancy, and his only daughter, who bore her  mother's name. While the land he had chosen was fertile enough, the want  of water had always been a sad drawback. The desire to try his fortunes  in a newer country had taken possession of him.    John Hanks had gone to Illinois, and had written back that everything  was more favorable there for making a living. Thomas Lincoln had not  been successful in Indiana. His children's prospects seemed to be  against them. After working as a hired hand on the surrounding farms,  Abe had served for a time as a ferryman, and, working by the river, had  learned to build the boat with which he had earned his first dollar.    As George Washington longed to go to sea, Abraham Lincoln seems to have  yearned to \"follow the river.\" He tried to hire out as deck hand, but  his age was against him. He soon had a chance to go \"down river\" to New  Orleans, with his friend, Allen Gentry, the son of the man for whom  Gentryville was named. Allen afterward married Kate Roby. A flatboat  belonging to Allen's father was loaded with bacon and other farm  merchandise for the southern market. Allen went in charge of the  expedition, and young Lincoln was engaged as \"bow hand.\" They started in  April, 1828. There was nothing to do but steer the unwieldy craft with  the current. The flatboat was made to float down stream only. It was to  be broken up at New Orleans and sold for lumber.    The two young men from Indiana made the trip without incident until they  came to the plantation of Madame Duchesne, six miles from Baton Rouge,  where they moored their raft for the night. There they heard the  stealthy footsteps of midnight marauders on board.    Young Gentry was first aroused. He sprang up and found a gang of  lawless negroes on deck, evidently looking for plunder, and thinking so  many of them could easily cow or handle the two white men.    \"Bring the guns, Abe!\" shouted Allen. \"Shoot them!\" Abraham Lincoln was  among them, brandishing a club--they had no guns. The negroes were  frightened not only by the fierce, commanding form of their tall  adversary, but also by his giant strength. The two white men routed the  whole black crew, but Abraham Lincoln received a wound in the encounter,  and bore the scar of it to his dying day.    The trip required about three months, going and returning, and the two  adventurers from Gentryville came back in June, with good stories of  their experiences to tell in Jones' store.    Not long after this Thomas Lincoln, in response to an urgent invitation  from John Hanks, decided to move to Illinois. It took a long time, after  gathering in the fall crops, for Thomas Lincoln to have a \"vandoo\" and  sell his corn and hogs. As for selling his farm, it had never really  belonged to him. He simply turned it over to Mr. Gentry, who held a  mortgage on it. It was February, 1830, before the pioneer wagon got  under way. The emigrant family consisted of Thomas Lincoln and Sarah,  his wife, Abraham, and John Johnston; Sarah and Matilda Johnston were  both married, and, with their husbands, a young man named Hall and  Dennis Hanks, formed the rest of the party. The women rode with their  household goods in a great covered cart drawn by two yoke of oxen.      A TRAVELING PEDDLER    Merchant Jones, for whom Abe had worked that fall and winter, after his  return from New Orleans, sold the young man a pack of \"notions\" to  peddle along the road to Illinois. \"A set of knives and forks,\" related  Mr. Jones' son afterward, \"was the largest item on the bill. The other  items were needles, pins, thread, buttons, and other little domestic  necessities. When the Lincolns reached their new home, Abraham wrote  back to my father stating that he had doubled his money on his purchases  by selling them along the road. Unfortunately we did not keep that  letter, not thinking how highly we would prize it afterward.\"    In the early days of his presidency, an international problem came  before the cabinet which reminded Mr. Lincoln of an experience he had on  this journey, so he told the several secretaries this story:    \"The situation"]]]
