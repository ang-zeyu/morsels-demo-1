[Headnote: APPRENTICESHIP IN HENRY VII.'S TIME.]    On the general subject it should be noted that Fleta mentions nothing  about boarders or apprentices in his account of household economy; nor  does the _Liber Contrarotulatoris Garderobæ Edw. I^mi_ mention any  young noblemen as part of the King's household. That among tradesmen  in later times, putting out their children in other houses, and  apprenticeships, were the rule, we know from many statements and  allusions in our literature, and \"The Italian Relation of England\"  (temp. Hen. VII.) mentions that the Duke of Suffolk was boarded out to  a rich old widow, who persuaded him to marry her (p. 27). It also says      The want of affection in the English is strongly manifested    towards their children; for after having kept them at home till    they arrive at the age of 7 or 9 years at the utmost, they put    them out, both males and females, to hard service in the houses of    other people, binding them generally for another 7 or 9 years. And    these are called apprentices, and during that time they perform    all the most menial offices; and few are born who are exempted    from this fate, for every one, however rich he may be, sends away    his children into the houses of others, whilst he, in return,    receives those of strangers into his own. And on inquiring their    reason for this severity, they answered that they did it in order    that their children might learn better manners. But I, for my    part, believe that they do it because they like to enjoy all their    comforts themselves, and that they are better served by strangers    than they would be by their own children. Besides which, the    English being great epicures, and very avaricious by nature,    indulge in the most delicate fare themselves and give their    household the coarsest bread, and beer, and cold meat baked on    Sunday for the week, which, however, they allow them in great    abundance. That if they had their own children at home, they would    be obliged to give them the same food they made use of for    themselves. That if the English sent their children away from home    to learn virtue and good manners, and took them back again when    their apprenticeship was over, they might, perhaps, be excused;    but they never return, for the girls are settled by their patrons,    and the boys make the best marriages they can, and, assisted by    their patrons, not by their fathers, they also open a house and    strive diligently by this means to make some fortune for    themselves; whence it proceeds that, having no hope of their    paternal inheritance, that all become so greedy of gain that they    feel no shame in asking, almost \"for the love of God,\" for the    smallest sums of money; and to this it may be attributed, that    there is no injury that can be committed against the lower orders    of the English, that may not be atoned for by money. --_A Relation    of the Island of England_ (Camden Society, 1847), pp. 24-6.    \"This evidently refers to tradesmen.[23] The note by the Editor[24]  however says it was the case with the children of the first nobility,  and gives the terms for the Duke of Buckingham's children with Mrs  Hexstall. The document only shows that Mrs Hexstall boarded them by  contract 'during the time of absence of my Lord and my Ladie.'\"    The Earl of Essex says in a letter to Lord Burleigh, 1576, printed in  Murdin's _State Papers_, p. 301-2.      \"Neverthelesse, uppon the assured Confidence, that your love to me    shall dissend to my Childrenne, and that your Lordship will    declare yourself a Frend to me, both alive and dead, I have willed    Mr _Waterhouse_ to shew unto you how you may with Honor and Equity    do good to my Sonne _Hereford_, and how to bind him with perpetual    Frendship to you and your House. And to the Ende I wold have his    Love towardes those which are dissended from you spring up and    increase with his Yeares, I have wished his Education to be in    your Household, though the same had not bene allotted to your    Lordship as Master of the Wardes; and that the whole Tyme, which    he shold spend in _England_ in his Minority, might be devided in    Attendance uppon my Lord _Chamberlayne_ and you, to the End, that    as he might frame himself to the Example of my Lord of _Sussex_ in    all the Actions of his Life, tending either to the Warres, or to    the Institution of a Nobleman, so that he might also reverence    your Lordship for your Wisdome and Gravyty, and lay up your    Counsells and Advises in the Treasory of his Hart.\"        [Headnote: GIRLS SENT OUT TO LADIES' HOUSES.]    That girls, as well as boys, were sent out to noblemen's houses for  their education, is evident from Margaret Paston's letter of the 3rd of  April, 1469, to Sir John Paston, \"Also I would ye should purvey for your  sister [? Margery] to be with my Lady of Oxford, or with my Lady of  Bedford, or in some other worshipful place whereas ye think best, and I  will help to her finding, for we be either of us weary of other.\" Alice  Crane's Letter, in the Paston Letters, v. i. p. 35, ed. 1840, also  supports this view, as does Sir John Heveningham's to Margaret Paston,  asking her to take his cousin Anneys Loveday for some time as a boarder  till a mistress could be found for her. \"If that it please you to have  her with you to into the time that a mistress may be purveyed for her,  I pray you thereof, and I shall content you for her board that ye shall  be well pleased.\" Similarly Anne Boleyn and her sister were sent to  Margaret of Savoy, aunt of Charles V., who lived at Brussels, to learn  courtesy, &c., says Prof. Brewer. Sir Roger Twysden says that Anne was  \"Not above seven yeares of age, Anno 1514,\" when she went abroad. He  adds:      \"It should seeme by some that she served three in France    successively; Mary of England maryed to Lewis the twelfth, an.    1514, with whome she went out of England, but Lewis dying the    first of January following, and that Queene (being) to returne    home, sooner than either Sir Thomas Bullen or some other of her    frendes liked she should, she was preferred to Clauda, daughter to    Lewis XII. and wife to Francis I. then Queene (it is likely upon    the commendation of Mary the Dowager), who not long after dying,    an. 1524, not yet weary of France she went to live with    Marguerite, Dutchess of Alançon and Berry, a Lady much commended    for her favor towards good letters, but never enough for the    Protestant religion then in the infancy--from her, if I am not    deceived, she first learnt the grounds of the Protestant religion;    so that England may seem to owe some part of her happyness derived    from that Lady.\" (Twysden's Notes quoted by Singer in his ed. of    Cavendish's Life of Wolsey, 1825, p. 57.)    As Henry VIII. fell in love with his wife's maid of honour,--\"began to  kindle the brand of amours\" at the light of Anne Boleyn's beauty, \"her  excellent gesture and behaviour,\"--so we find in later times rich young  men became enamoured of poor young women staying in the same house with  them. Mr Bruce sends me an instance:      \"the young lady was niece, you will perceive, to a well-beneficed    clergyman, and a thriving gentleman well-advanced in the public    service. She had lost her mother, and her father was in debt and    difficulties. She was therefore placed by the influence of her    uncles in a well-known family in Wiltshire.\"      _State Papers. Dom. Car._ I. Vol. ccclii. No. 29. Dr Matthew    Nicholas, afterwards Dean of St Paul's, to Edward Nicholas, Clerk    of the Council, and afterwards Secretary of State. Dated, West    Dean, April 4, 1637.      \"I have spoken with Miss Evelyn since I wrote last unto you, and    enquired of her the cause w{hi}ch moued her to displace my coson    Hunton. She told me much accordinge to what she had sayd unto my    coson Hunton, w{i}th this addition, that she had respect in it as    well unto her good as her owne convenience, for hauinge nowe noe    employment for her but her needle, she founde that sittinge still    at her worke made her sickly, and therefore thought she might doe    better in another seruice where she might haue the orderinge of an    huswifely charge, for w{hi}ch (she told me) she had made her very    able. I expressed myselfe tender of the disgrace w{hi}ch would lay    uppon my coson in beinge displaced in such a manner by warninge    giuen, wherof whatsoeuer were the cause, it would be imagined by    all that knowe it not, to be in her ill carriage, and wished she    had done me that fauour as to haue acquainted me with her intents    in such time as I might haue taken some course to haue disposed of    her before it had bin knowne that she was to leaue her: she    slubbered it ouer w{i}th a slight excuse that she had acquainted    my wife ... but for my satisfaction she told me that she would be    as mindfull of her when God should call her as if she were w{i}th    her, and in testimony of her good likinge of her seruice she would    allowe her forty shillings yearly towarde her maintainance as    longe as herself should liue.

There is the flash of the armor of the Valkyrias.[11] A  battle is on somewhere, and Odin has sent his maidens to choose the  heroes for Valhalla.\"    Leif only laughed and lay down to sleep.    So in the spring they all went back to Norway. Leif got ready the boat  again and merrily sailed for Ireland.    \"Here I go to get riches for our new land,\" he said.    Ingolf set his men to cutting down pines in the forest and some to  building a new ship. He had his thralls plant large crops of grain and  grind flour and make new kegs and chests of wood. He himself worked much  at the forge, making all kinds of tools--spades, axes, hammers,  hunting-knives, cooking kettles. The women were busy weaving and sewing  new clothes. Ingolf sold his house and land and everything that he could  not take with him.    After about two years Leif came back. He had ten thralls that he had got  in Ireland. He took Ingolf aboard his ship and raised the covers of  great chests. Gold helmets, silver-trimmed drinking-horns, embroidered  robes, and swords flashed out.    \"Did I not say that I would come back with a full ship?\" he laughed.    At last all things were ready for starting.    \"To-day I will sacrifice to Thor and Odin,\" Ingolf said. \"If the omens  are good we will start to-morrow.\"    \"Well, go, foster-brother,\" laughed Leif. \"But I have better things to  do. I will be putting the cattle into the ship and will have all ready.\"    So Ingolf and his men went into the forests a little way. There in a  cleared space stood a large building. In front of this temple the men  killed two horses for Odin. Ingolf caught some of the blood in a brass  bowl. He raised it and looked up at the sky and said:    \"All-wise and all-father Odin, and Thor who loves the thunder, I give  these horses to you. Tell me whether it is your will that we go to  Iceland.\"    As he said that, a raven flew over his head. Ingolf watched it.    \"It is Odin's will that we go,\" he said. \"He sent his raven[12] to tell  us. It is flying straight toward Iceland.\"    The men shouted with joy at that.    Now they hung some of the meat of the horses on a tree near the temple.    \"For the ravens of Odin,\" they said.    Ingolf carried the bowl of blood into the temple. He went through the  feast hall in front to a little room at the back. Here stood wooden  statues of the gods in a semicircle. Before them was a stone altar.  Ingolf took a little brush of twigs that lay on it and dipped it into  the blood and sprinkled the statues.    \"You shall taste of our sacrifice,\" he said. \"Look kindly on us from  your happy seats in Asgard.\"    Then they went into the feast hall. There thralls were boiling the  horseflesh in pots over the fire. The tables were standing ready before  the benches. Ingolf walked to the high seat. All the others took their  places at the benches. When the horns came round, Ingolf made this vow:    \"I vow that I will build my house wherever these pillars lead me.\"    He put his hand upon a tall post that stood beside the high seat. There  was one at each side. They were the front posts of the chair. But they  stood up high, almost to the roof. They were wonderfully carved and  painted with men and dragons. On the top of each one was a little  statue of Thor with his hammer.    At the end of the feast Ingolf had his thralls dig these pillars up. He  had a little bronze chest filled with the earth that was under the  altar.    \"I will take the pillars of my high seat to Iceland,\" he said, \"and I  will set up my altar there upon the soil of Norway, the soil that all my  ancestors have trod, the soil that Thor loves.\"    So they carried the pillars and the chest of earth and the statues of  the gods, and put them into Ingolf's boat.    \"It is a well-packed ship,\" the men said. \"There is no spot to spare.\"    Tools, and chests of food, and tubs of drink, and chests of clothes, and  fishing nets were stowed in the bows of both boats. In the bottom were  laid some long, heavy, hewn logs.    \"The trees in Iceland are little,\" Ingolf said. \"We must take the great  beams for our homes with us.\"    Standing on these logs were a few cattle and sheep and horses and pigs.  The rowers' benches were along the sides. In the stern of each boat was  a little cabin. Here the women and children were to sleep. But the men  would sleep on the timbers in the middle of the boat and perhaps they  would put up the awning sometimes.    At last everyone was aboard. Men loosed the rope that held the boats.  The ships flashed down the rollers into the water, and Ingolf and Leif  were off for Iceland. As they sailed away everyone looked back at the  shore of old Norway. There were tears in the women's eyes. Helga, Leif's  wife, sang:        \"There was I born. There was I wed.      There are my father's bones.      There are the hills and fields,      The streams and rocks that I love.      There are houses and temples,      Women and warriors and feasts,      Ships and songs and fights--      A crowded, joyous land.      I go to an empty land.\"    There was the same long voyage with storm and fog. But at last the  people saw again the white cloud and saw it growing into land and  mountains. Then Ingolf took the pillars of his high seat and threw them  overboard.    \"Guide them to a good place, O Thor!\" he cried.    The waves caught them up and rolled them about. Ingolf followed them  with his ship. But soon a storm came up. The men had to take down the  sails and masts, and they could do nothing with their oars. The two  ships tossed about in the sea wherever the waves sent them. The pillars  drifted away, and Ingolf could not see them.    \"Remember your pillars, O Thor!\" he cried.    Then he saw that Leif's ship was being driven far off.    \"Ah, my foster-brother,\" he thought, \"shall I not have you to cheer me  in this empty land? O Thor, let him not go down to the caves of Ran! He  is too good a man for that.\"    On the next day the storm was not so hard, and Ingolf put in at a good  harbor. A high rocky point stuck out into the sea. A broad bay with  islands in the mouth was at the side. Behind the rocky point was a  level green place with ice-mountains shining far back.    After a day or two Ingolf said:    \"I will go look for my pillars.\"    So he and a few men got into the rowboat and went along the shore and  into all the fiords, but they could not find the pillars. After a week  they came back, and Ingolf said:    \"I will build a house here to live in while I look for the posts. This  way is uncomfortable for the women.\"    So he did. Then he set out again to look for the pillars, but he had no  better luck and came back.    \"I must stay at home and see to the making of hay and the drying of  fish,\" he said. \"Winter is coming on, and we must not be caught with  nothing to eat.\"    So he stayed and worked and sent two of his thralls to look for the holy  posts. They came back every week or two and always had to say that they  had not found them. Midwinter was coming on.    [Illustration: \"_Then he saw that Leif's ship was being driven afar  off_\"]    \"Ah!\" said Ingolf's wife one day, \"do you remember the gay feast that we  had at Yule-time? All our friends were there. The house rang with song  and laughter. Our tables bent with good things to eat. Walls were hung  with gay draperies. The floor was clean with sweet-smelling  pine-branches. Now look at this mean house; its dirt floor, its bare  stone walls, its littleness, its darkness! Look at our long faces. No  one here could make a song if he tried. Oh! I am sick for dear old  Norway.\"    \"It is Thor's fault,\" Ingolf cried. \"He will not let me find his posts.\"    He strode out of the house and stood scowling at the gray sea.    \"Ah, foster-brother!\" he said. \"It was never so gloomy when you were by  my side. Where are you now? Shall I never hear your merry laugh again?  That spot in my palm burns, and my heart aches to see you. That arch of  sod keeps rising before my eyes. Our vows keep ringing in my ears.\"    At last the long, gloomy winter passed and spring came.    \"Cheer up, good wife,\" Ingolf said. \"Better days are coming now.\"    But that same day the thralls came back from looking for the posts.    \"We have bad news,\" they said. \"As we walked along the shore looking for  the pillars we saw a man lying on the shore. We went up to him. He was  dead. It was Leif. Two well-built houses stood near. We went to them. We  knew from the carving on the door-posts that they were Leif's. We went  in. The rooms were empty. Along the shore and in the wood back of the  house we found all of his men, dead. There was no living thing about.\"    Ingolf said no word, but his face was white, and his mouth was set. He  went into the house and got his spears and his shield and said to his  men:    \"Follow me.\"    They put provisions into the boat and pushed off and sailed until they  saw Leif's houses on the shore of the harbor. There they saw Leif and  the men who were his friends, dead. Their swords and spears were gone.  Ingolf walked through the houses calling on Helga and on the thralls,  but no one answered. The storehouse was empty. The rich hangings were  gone from the walls of the houses. There was nothing in the stables. The  boat was gone.    Ingolf went out and stood on a high point of land that jutted out into  the water. Far along the coast he saw some little islands. He turned to  his men and said:    \"The thralls have done it. I think we shall find them on those islands.\"    Then he went back to Leif and stood looking at him.    \"What a shame for so brave a man to fall by the hands of thralls! But I  have found that such things always happen to men who do not sacrifice to  the gods. Ah, Leif! I did not think when we made those vows of  foster-brotherhood that this would ever happen. But do not fear. I  remember my promise."]]]
