There, too, stood a noble  palace, golden fronted, and with arcades of stainless marble that  shone like snow in the sun. At first all seemed like part of a dream  from which she dreaded to awake, but soon there came to her the joy of  knowing that all the exquisite things that made appeal to her senses  were indeed realities. Almost holding her breath, she walked forward  to the open golden doors. \"It is a trap,\" she thought. \"By this means  does the monster subtly mean to lure me into his golden cage.\" Yet,  even as she thought, there seemed to be hovering round her winged  words, like little golden birds with souls. And in her ears they  whispered, \"Fear not. Doubt not. Recall the half-formed dreams that so  short a time ago brought to thy heart such unutterable joy. No evil  shall come to thee--only the bliss of loving and of being loved.\"    [Illustration: THUS DID PSYCHE LOSE HER FEAR, AND ENTER THE GOLDEN  DOORS]    Thus did Psyche lose her fear, and enter the golden doors. And  inside the palace she found that all the beautiful things of which she  had ever dreamed, all the perfect things for which she had ever  longed, were there to greet her. From one to another she flitted, like  a humming-bird that sucks honey from one and then from another  gorgeous flower. And then, when she was tired with so much wearing out  of her thankful mind, she found a banquet ready spread for her, with  all the dainties that her dainty soul liked best; and, as she ate,  music so perfect rejoiced her ears that all her soul was soothed and  joyous and at peace. When she had refreshed herself, a soft couch  stood before her, ready for her there to repose, and when that strange  day had come to an end, Psyche knew that, monster or not, she was  beloved by one who had thought for her every thought, and who desired  only her desire.    Night came at last, and when all was dark and still, and Psyche, wide  awake, was full of forebodings and fears lest her happy dreams might  only be misleading fancies, and Horror incarnate might come to crown  her peaceful day, Eros softly entered the palace that was his own.  Even as he had gone to the palace of her father he went now, and found  Psyche lying with violet eyes that stared into the velvety darkness,  seeking something that she hoped for, trembling before something that  brought her dread.    His voice was as the voice of spring when it breathes on the sleeping  earth; he knew each note in Love's music, every word in the great  thing that is Love's vocabulary. Love loved, and Psyche listened, and  soon she knew that her lover was Love himself.    Thus, for Psyche, did a time of perfect happiness begin. All through  the day she roamed in her Love's dominion, and saw on every side the  signs of his passion and of his tenderness. All through the night he  stayed by her, and satisfied all the longing of her heart. Yet always,  ere daybreak, Eros left her, and when she begged him to stay he only  made answer:        \"I am with thee only while I keep      My visage hidden; and if thou once shouldst see      My face, I must forsake thee; the high gods      Link Love with Faith, and he withdraws himself      From the full gaze of knowledge.\"            Lewis Morris.    So did time glide past for Psyche, and ever she grew more in love with  Love; always did her happiness become more complete. Yet, ever and  again, there returned to her the remembrance of those sorrowful days  when her father and mother had broken their hearts over her martyrdom,  and her sisters had looked askance at her as at one whose punishment  must assuredly have come from her own misdoing. Thus at length she  asked Eros to grant her, for love's sake, a boon--to permit her to  have her sisters come to see for themselves the happiness that was  hers. Most unwillingly was her request granted, for the heart of Eros  told him that from their visit no good could come. Yet he was unable  to deny anything to Psyche, and on the following day Zephyrus was sent  to bring the two sisters to the pleasant valley where Psyche had her  home. Eagerly, as she awaited them, Psyche thought she might make the  princely palace wherein she dwelt yet fairer than it was. And almost  ere she could think, her thoughts became realities. When the two  sisters came, they were bewildered with the beauty and the  magnificence of it all. Beside this, their own possessions were paltry  trifles indeed. Quickly, in their little hearts, black envy grew. They  had always been jealous of their younger sister, and now that they  found her, whom all the world believed to have been slain by a  horrible monster, more beautiful than ever, decked with rare jewels,  radiant in her happiness, and queen of a palace fit for the gods,  their envy soon turned to hatred, and they sought how best to wreak  their malice upon the joyous creature who loaded them with priceless  gifts. They began to ply Psyche with questions. He who was her lord,  to whom she owed all her happiness, where was he? Why did he stay away  when her sisters came to be presented to him? What manner of man was  he? Was he fair or dark? Young or old? And as they questioned her,  Psyche grew like a bewildered child and answered in frightened words  that contradicted one another. And well the wicked sisters, who  brooded evil in their hearts, knew that this husband whom Psyche had  never seen must indeed be one of the deathless gods. Wily words they  spoke to her then.    \"Alas! unhappy one,\" they said, \"dost think to escape the evil fate  the gods meted out for thee? Thy husband is none other than the  monster of which the oracle spake! Oh, foolish Psyche! canst not  understand that the monster fears the light? Too great horror would  it mean for thee to see the loathsome thing that comes in the  blackness of night and speaks to thee words of love.\"    White-lipped and trembling, Psyche listened. Drop by drop the  poisonous words passed into her soul. She had thought him king of all  living things--worthy to rule over gods as well as men. She was so  sure that his body was worthy sheath for the heart she knew so  well.... She had pictured him beautiful as Eros, son of  Aphrodite--young and fair, with crisp, golden locks--a husband to  glory in--a lover to adore. And now she knew, with shame and dread,  that he who had won her love between the twilight and the dawn was a  thing to shame her, a monster to be shunned of men.    \"What, then, shall I do?\" piteously she asked of her sisters. And the  women, pitilessly, and well content, answered:    \"Provide thyself with a lamp and a knife sharp enough to slay the man  or monster. And when this creature to whom, to thy undying shame, thou  belongest, sleeps sound, slip from thy couch and in the rays of the  lamp have courage to look upon him in all his horror. Then, when thou  hast seen for thyself that what we say is truth, with thy knife  swiftly slay him. Thus shalt thou free thyself from the pitiless doom  meted out by the gods.\"    Shaking with sobs, Psyche made answer:    \"I love him so!... I love him so!\"    And her sisters turned upon her with furious scorn and well-simulated  wrath.    \"Shameless one!\" they cried; \"and does our father's daughter confess  to a thing so unutterable! Only by slaying the monster canst thou hope  to regain thy place amongst the daughters of men.\"    They left her when evening fell, carrying with them their royal gifts.  And while she awaited the coming of her lord, Psyche, provided with  knife and lamp, crouched with her head in her hands, a lily broken by  a cruel storm. So glad was Eros to come back to her, to find her  safely there--for greatly had he feared the coming of that treacherous  pair--that he did not note her silence. Nor did the dark night show  him that her eyes in her sad face looked like violets in a snow  wreath. He wanted only to hold her safely in his arms, and there she  lay, passive and still, until sleep came to lay upon him an omnipotent  hand. Then, very gently, she withdrew herself from his embrace, and  stole to the place where her lamp was hidden. Her limbs shook under  her as she brought it to the couch where he lay asleep; her arm  trembled as she held it aloft.    As a martyr walks to death, so did she walk. And when the yellow light  fell upon the form of him who lay there, still she gazed steadily.    And, lo, before her she saw the form of him who had ever been the  ideal of her dreams. Love himself, incarnate Love, perfect in beauty  and in all else was he whom her sisters had told her was a  monster--he, of whom the oracle had said that neither gods nor men  could resist him. For a moment of perfect happiness she gazed upon his  beauty. Then he turned in his sleep, and smiled, and stretched out  his arms to find the one of his love. And Psyche started, and,  starting, shook the lamp; and from it fell a drop of burning oil on  the white shoulder of Eros. At once he awoke, and with piteous,  pitying eyes looked in those of Psyche. And when he spoke, his words  were like daggers that pierced deep into her soul. He told her all  that had been, all that might have been. Had she only had faith and  patience to wait, an immortal life should have been hers.        \"Farewell! though I, a god, can never know      How thou canst lose thy pain, yet time will go      Over thine head, and thou mayst mingle yet      The bitter and the sweet, nor quite forget,      Nor quite remember, till these things shall seem      The wavering memory of a lovely dream.\"            William Morris.    He left her alone then, with her despair, and as the slow hours  dragged by, Psyche, as she awaited the dawn, felt that in her heart no  sun could ever rise again. When day came at last, she felt she could  no longer endure to stay in the palace where everything spoke to her  of the infinite tenderness of a lost love. Through the night a storm  had raged, and even with the day there came no calm.

The malicious writer dates from Paris; but  for such experiences our own city would probably be quite as prolific a  hunting-field.           *       *       *       *       *    How rapid is the progress of oblivion with respect to those who are no  more! How many a quadrille shall we see this winter, exclusively made up  from the ranks of inconsolable widows! Widows of this order exist only  in the literature of the tombstone. In the world, and after the lapse of  a certain period, there is but one sort of widows inconsolable--those  who refuse to be comforted, because they can't get married again!    One of our most distinguished sculptors was summoned, a short time  since, to the house of a young lady, connected by birth with a family of  the highest grade in the aristocracy of wealth, and united in marriage  to the heir of a title illustrious in the military annals of the empire.  The union, formed under the happiest auspices, had been, alas! of short  duration. Death, unpitying death, had ruptured it, by prematurely  carrying off the young husband. The sculptor was summoned by the widow.  He traversed the apartments, silent and deserted, until he was  introduced into a bedroom, and found himself in presence of a lady,  young and beautiful, but habited in the deepest mourning, and with a  face furrowed by tears. \"You are aware,\" said she, with a painful  effort, and a voice half choked by sobs, \"you are aware of the blow  which I have received?\" The artist bowed, with an air of respectful  condolence. \"Sir,\" continued the widow, \"I am anxious to have a funeral  monument erected in honor of the husband whom I have lost.\" The artist  bowed again. \"I wish that the monument should be superb, worthy of the  man whose loss I weep, proportioned to the unending grief into which his  loss has plunged me. I care not what it costs. I am rich, and I will  willingly sacrifice all my fortune to do honor to the memory of an  adored husband. I must have a temple--with columns--in marble--and in  the middle--on a pedestal--his statue.\"    \"I will do my best to fulfil your wishes, madam,\" replied the artist;  \"but I had not the honor of acquaintance with the deceased, and a  likeness of him is indispensable for the due execution of my work.  Without doubt, you have his portrait?\"    The widow raised her arm and pointed despairingly to a splendid likeness  painted by Amaury Duval.    \"A most admirable picture!\" observed the artist, \"and the painter's name  is a sufficient guarantee for its striking resemblance to the original.\"    \"Those are his very features, sir; it is himself. It wants but life. Ah!  would that I could restore it to him at the cost of all my blood!\"    \"I will have this portrait carried to my studio, madam, and I promise  you that the marble shall reproduce it exactly.\"    The widow, at these words, sprung up, and at a single bound throwing  herself towards the picture, with arms stretched out as though to defend  it, exclaimed, \"Take away this portrait! carry off my only consolation!  my sole remaining comfort! never! never!\"    \"But madam, you will only be deprived of it for a short time, and--\"    \"Not an hour! not a minute! could I exist without his beloved image!  Look you, sir, I have had it placed here, in my own room, that my eyes  might be fastened upon it, without ceasing, and through my tears. His  portrait shall never leave this spot one single instant, and in  contemplating _that_ will I pass the remainder of a miserable and  sorrowful existence.\"    \"In that case, madam, you will be compelled to permit me to take a copy  of it. But do not be uneasy--I shall not have occasion to trouble your  solitude for any length of time: one sketch--one sitting will suffice.\"    The widow agreed to this arrangement; she only insisted that the artist  should come back the following day. She wanted him to set to work on the  instant, so great was her longing to see the mausoleum erected. The  sculptor, however, remarked that he had another work to finish first.  This difficulty she sought to overcome by means of money.    \"Impossible!\" replied the artist, \"I have given my word; but do not  distress yourself; I will apply to it so diligently, that the monument  shall be finished in as short a time as any other sculptor would  require, who could apply himself to it forthwith.\"    \"You see my distress,\" said the widow; \"you can make allowance for my  impatience. Be speedy, then, and above all, be lavish of magnificence.  Spare no expense; only let me have a masterpiece.\"    Several letters echoed these injunctions, during the few days  immediately following the interview. At the expiration of three months  the artist called again. He found the widow still in weeds, but a little  less pallid, and a little more coquettishly dressed in her mourning  garb. \"Madam,\" said he, \"I am entirely at your service.\"    \"Ah! at last; this is fortunate,\" replied the widow, with a gracious  smile.    \"I have made my design, but I still want one sitting for the likeness.  Will you permit me to go into your bedroom?\"    \"Into my bedroom? For what?\"    \"To look at the portrait again.\"    \"Oh! yes; have the goodness to walk into the drawing-room; you will find  it there, now.\"    \"Ah!\"    \"Yes; it hangs better there; it is better lighted in the drawing-room  than in my own room.\"    \"Would you like, madam, to look at the design for the monument?\"    \"With pleasure. Oh! what a size! What profusion of decorations! Why, it  is a palace, sir, this tomb!\"    \"Did you not tell me, madam, that nothing could be too magnificent? I  have not considered the expense; and, by the way, here is a memorandum  of what the monument will cost you.\"    \"Oh, heavens!\" exclaimed the widow, after having cast an eye over the  total adding up. \"Why, this is enormous!\"    \"You begged me to spare no expense.\"    \"Yes, no doubt, I desire to do things properly, but not exactly to make  a fool of myself.\"    \"This, at present, you see, is only a design; and there is time yet to  cut it down.\"    \"Well, then, suppose we were to leave out the temple, and the columns,  and all the architectural part, and content ourselves with the statue?  It seems to me that this would be very appropriate.\"    \"Certainly it would.\"    \"So let it be, then--just the statue, alone.\"    Shortly after this second visit, the sculptor fell desperately ill. He  was compelled to give up work; but, on returning from a tour in Italy,  prescribed by his physician, he presented himself once more before the  widow, who was then in the tenth month of her mourning. He found, this  time, a few roses among the cypress, and some smiling colors playing  over half-shaded grounds. He brought with him a little model of his  statue, done in plaster, and offering in miniature the idea of what his  work was to be. \"What do you think of the likeness?\" he inquired of the  widow.    \"It seems to me a little flattered; my husband was all very well, no  doubt; but you are making him an Apollo!\"    \"Really? well, then, I can correct my work by the portrait.\"    \"Don't take the trouble--a little more, or a little less like, what does  it matter?\"    \"Excuse me, but I am particular about likenesses.\"    \"If you absolutely must--\"    \"It is in the drawing-room, yonder, is it not? I'll go in there.\"    \"It is not there any longer,\" replied the widow, ringing the bell.    \"Baptiste,\" said she to the servant who came in, \"bring down the  portrait of your master.\"    \"The portrait that you sent up to the garret last week, madam?\"    \"Yes.\"    At this moment the door opened, and a young man of distinguished air  entered; his manners were easy and familiar; he kissed the fair widow's  hand, and tenderly inquired after her health. \"Who in the world is this  good man in plaster?\" asked he, pointing with his finger to the  statuette, which the artist had placed upon the mantel-piece.    \"It is the model of a statue for my husband's tomb.\"    \"You are having a statue of him made? The devil! It's very majestic!\"    \"Do you think so?\"    \"It is only great men who are thus cut out of marble, and at full  length; it seems to me, too, that the deceased was a very ordinary  personage.\"    \"In fact, his bust would be sufficient.\"    \"Just as you please, madam,\" said the sculptor.    \"Well, let it be a bust, then; that's determined!\"    Two months later, the artist, carrying home the bust, encountered on the  stairs a merry party. The widow, giving her hand to the elegant dandy  who had caused the statue of the deceased to be cut down, was on her way  to the mayor's office, where she was about to take a second oath of  conjugal fidelity. If the bust had not been completed, it would  willingly have been dispensed with. When, some time later, the artist  called for his money, there was an outcry about the price; and it  required very little less than a threat of legal proceedings, before the  widow, consoled and remarried, concluded by resigning herself to pay for  this funeral homage, reduced as it was, to the memory of her departed  husband.          A NEW SERIES OF TALES BY MISS MARTINEAU.      There is scarcely in English literature a collection of tales by a  simple writer that are better adapted for the instruction of the masses,  than HARRIET MARTINEAU'S _Illustrations of Political Economy_. Without  believing her a very profound philosopher, we are inclined to think  these works could be remembered longer than any of her other writings.  The pleasure and instruction we derived from them were recalled by the  announcement in the London _Leader_ that she is to contribute a new  series of stories for the people, to that journal. We copy the first of  them.      THE OLD GOVERNESS.    The afternoon was come when the Morells must go on board. They were  going to Canada at last, after having talked about it for several years.
