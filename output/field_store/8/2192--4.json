It is proper to call, after an engagement has been announced, or a marriage  has taken place, in the family.    For the older residents in the city or street to call upon the newcomers to  their neighborhood is a long recognized custom.    It is proper, after a removal from one part of the city to another, to send  out cards with one's new address upon them.    To ascertain what are the prescribed hours for calling in the place where  one is living, or making a visit, and to adhere to those hours is a duty  that must not be overlooked.    A gentleman should ask for the lady of the house as well as the young  ladies, and leave cards for her as well as for the head of the family. {57}    [Illustration: _Improve Your Speech by Reading._]           *       *       *       *       *    ETIQUETTE IN YOUR SPEECH.

Don't sit down to your evening meal before a complete toilet if you have  company.    Don't cleanse your nails, your nose or your ears in public.    Don't use hair dye, hair oil or pomades.    Don't wear evening dress in daytime.    Don't wear jewelry of a gaudy character; genuine jewelry modestly worn is  not out of place.    Don't overdress yourself or walk affectedly.

Your conduct on the street should always be modest and dignified. Ladies  should carefully avoid all loud and boisterous conversation or laughter and  all undue liveliness in public.    2. When walking on the street do not permit yourself to be absent-minded,  as to fail to recognize a friend; do not go along reading a book or  newspaper.    3. In walking with a lady on the street give her the inner side of the  walk, unless the outside is the safer part; in which case she is entitled  to it.    4. Your arm should not be given to any lady except your wife or a near  relative, or a very old lady, during the day, unless her comfort or safety  requires it. At night the arm should always be offered; also in ascending  the steps of a public building.    5. In crossing the street a lady should gracefully raise her dress a little  above her ankle with one hand. To raise the dress with both hands is  vulgar, except in places where the mud is very deep.    6. A gentleman meeting a lady acquaintance on the street should not presume  to join her in her walk without first asking her permission.    7. If you have anything to say to a lady whom you may happen to meet in the  street, however intimate you may be, do not stop her, but turn round and  walk in company with her; you can take leave at the end of the street.    8. A lady should not venture out upon the street alone after dark. By so  doing she compromises her dignity, and exposes herself to indignity at the  hands of the rougher class.    9. Never offer to shake hands with a lady in the street if you have on dark  or soiled gloves, as you may soil hers.    10. A lady does not form acquaintances upon the street, or seek to attract  the attention of the other sex or of persons of her own sex. Her conduct is  always modest and unassuming. Neither does a lady demand services or favors  from a gentleman. She accepts them graciously, always {60} expressing her  thanks. A gentleman will not stand on the street corners, or in hotel  doorways, or store windows and gaze impertinently at ladies as they pass  by. This is the exclusive business of loafers.    11. In walking with a lady who has your arm, should you have to cross the  street, do not disengage your arm and go around upon the outside, unless  the lady's comfort renders it necessary. In walking with a lady, where it  is necessary for you to proceed singly, always go before her.           *       *       *       *       *    ETIQUETTE BETWEEN SEXES.    1. A lady should be a lady, and a gentleman a gentleman under any and all  circumstances.    2. FEMALE INDIFFERENCE TO MAN.--There is nothing that affects the nature  and pleasure of man so much as a proper and friendly recognition from a  lady, and as women are more or less dependent upon man's good-will, either  for gain or pleasure, it surely stands to their interest to be reasonably  pleasant and courteous in his presence or society. Indifference is always a  poor investment, whether in society or business.    3. GALLANTRY AND LADYISM should be a prominent feature in the education of  young people. Politeness to ladies cultivates the intellect and refines the  soul, and he who can be easy and entertaining in the society of ladies has  mastered one of the greatest accomplishments. There is nothing taught in  school, academy or college, that contributes so much to the happiness of  man as a full development of his social and moral qualities.    4. LADYLIKE ETIQUETTE.--No woman can afford to treat men rudely. A lady  must have a high intellectual and moral ideal and hold herself above  reproach. She must remember that the art of pleasing and entertaining  gentlemen is infinitely more ornamental than laces, ribbons or diamonds.  Dress and glitter may please man, but it will never benefit him.    5. CULTIVATE DEFICIENCIES.--Men and women poorly sexed treat each other  with more or less indifference, whereas a hearty sexuality inspires both to  a right estimation of the faculties and qualities of each other. Those who  are deficient should seek society and overcome their deficiencies. While  some naturally inherit faculties as entertainers, others are compelled to  acquire them by cultivation. {61}    [Illustration: ASKING AN HONEST QUESTION.]    6. LADIES' SOCIETY.--He who seeks ladies' society should seek an education  and should have a pure heart and a pure mind. Read good, pure and wholesome  literature and study human nature, and you will always be a favorite in the  society circle.    7. WOMAN HATERS.--Some men with little refinement and strong sensual  feelings virtually insult and thereby disgust and repel every female they  meet. They look upon woman with an inherent vulgarity, and doubt the virtue  and integrity of all alike. But it is because they are generally {62}  insincere and impure themselves, and with such a nature culture and  refinement are out of the question, there must be a revolution.    8. MEN HATERS.--Women who look upon all men as odious, corrupt or hateful,  are no doubt so themselves, though they may be clad in silk and sparkle  with diamonds and be as pretty as a lily; but their hypocrisy will out, and  they can never win the heart of a faithful, conscientious and well balanced  man. A good woman has broad ideas and great sympathy. She respects all men  until they are proven unworthy.    9. FOND OF CHILDREN.--The man who is naturally fond of children will make a  good husband and a good father. So it behooves the young man, to notice  children and cultivate the art of pleasing them. It will be a source of  interest, education and permanent benefit to all.    10. EXCESSIVE LUXURY.--Although the association with ladies is an expensive  luxury, yet it is not an expensive education. It elevates, refines,  sanctifies and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23624"],[0,"Ride Proud, Rebel!

As the other two, he had risen to his feet on the  approach of the older man. \"Them's pretty harsh words, suh. Cutthroat  now--I ain't never slit me a throat in all my born days. What about you,  Rennie? You done any fancy work with a bowie lately?\"    Mr. McKeever favored the Texan with a passing frown; then his attention  settled on Drew. \"Rennie,\" he repeated, and then said the name again  with the emphasis of one making a court identification. \"Drew Rennie!\"    \"Yes, suh.\" As Boyd had done, Drew answered to the indictment of being  where he was and who he was.    \"I am most unhappy to see Alexander Mattock's grandson and Meredith  Barrett's son in such company. Surely\"--he turned to Captain  Campbell--\"these boys are not your regular prisoners--\"    Campbell shook his head gravely. \"Unfortunately, sir, they are indeed  troopers with Morgan. And, as such, they are subject to the rules of war  governing prisoners--\"    \"That does not prevent my seeing what I can do for both of you,\" their  host said quickly. \"At least, Boyd, you are young enough to be released  by the authorities. Be sure I shall do all I can to bring that about.\"    As Boyd opened his mouth to protest, Drew spoke quickly:    \"Thank you, suh. I know Cousin Merry will appreciate that.\"    With a last assurance of his intention to help them, Mr. McKeever left.  Boyd grinned.    \"He did help me,\" he observed. \"He knows now I'm with Morgan, and nobody  can say that's not so!\"    Kirby laughed. \"Reckon that's true, kid. You locked yourself right into  the corral along with the rest of us bad men. Look's like you've been  outfought this time, Rennie.\"    Drew threw himself back under the tree. So Boyd had won this round--they  were still in Kentucky and not too far from Oak Hill.          5    _Bardstown Surrenders_      \"Now that's what I call true hospitality, gentlemen, true hospitality.\"  Kirby caressed his middle section gently with both hands, smiling  dreamily into the lacing of apple boughs over his head. \"I ain't had me  a feed like that since we took that sutler's wagon back outside Mount  Sterlin'. 'Mos' forgot theah was such vittles lyin' 'bout to be sampled.  An' you got us most of the cream, too, 'cause you're poor little  misguided boys a-runnin' 'way to be with us desperate characters. Git me  a bowie knife, an' I'll show you how to cut throats--all free, too.\"    Drew laughed, but Boyd did not appear amused. They had been favored with  a short but pungent lecture from Mr. McKeever, served along with food,  which to Drew made it worth the return of listening decorously to a  listing of their sins.    \"I ain't goin' home,\" Boyd repeated stubbornly.    \"Well,\" Kirby pointed out, \"if he rides up to the Yankee prison camp, he  ain't gonna find you neither. So what's the difference? I think we  oughta be movin' on, seein' as how we ain't really on speakin' terms  with the law heah 'bouts.\"    It would appear that Captain Campbell agreed with that. The order came  to saddle up and move out. But they went with provision sacks slung from  their saddles, a portion of McKeever's bounty stowed away against  tomorrow. And once they were past the house, the word came down the line  for Drew to quit his prisoner's role and join their commander.    Campbell held a fragment of map as he let his mount's pace fall to a  slow walk. \"There are about a hundred Union infantry stationed at  Bardstown, according to Mr. McKeever. Know anything about the town?\"    \"I was there once. My cousin went to St. Joseph's for a term.\"    \"Remember enough to find your way around?\"    \"I don't know, suh. But if there's a Union garrison--?\" He ended the  sentence with an implied question.    \"What are we going to do there?\" The captain grinned. \"We're going to  collect some arms, I hope. Supposing you were a Yankee commander,  Rennie, and a bold, bad raider like General Morgan was to ride clean up  to your door with a regiment or two tailing him and say: 'Your guns,  suh, or your life!' What would you do, especially if your troops were  mostly militia and green men who hadn't ever been in a real fight?\"    Drew understood. \"Probably, suh, I'd tell General Morgan that he could  have his guns, providin' he kept his side of the bargain.\"    \"As far as the Yankees in Bardstown may know, General Morgan could be  headed their way right now with a regiment. I don't think they've had  time yet to learn just how badly we were scattered back there by the  Licking River. You willing to take the flag in when we get there,  Rennie? Pick a couple of outriders to go with you!\"    It was risky, but no more risky than bluffs he had seen work before. And  they did need the weapons. Cutting westward now only kept them well  inside Union territory. Somehow they would have to skulk or fight their  way down through the southern part of Kentucky and then probably all the  way across Tennessee--a tall order, but one which was just possible of  accomplishment.    \"I'll do it, suh.\" Riding into Bardstown was no worse than riding over  the rest of this countryside where any moment they might be swept up by  the enemy.    It was lucky they had brought rations with them from McKeever's, for  they took no more chances of trying for such supplies again. Once more  they altered their advance, riding the pikes at night, hiding out by  day.    Hills then, and among them Bardstown. Drew borrowed a carbine, stringing  a dubiously white strip of shirt tail from its barrel, and flanked by  Kirby and Driscoll, a trooper Campbell had appointed, rode slowly up the  broad street opening from the pike. Great trees arched overhead, almost  as they had across the drive of the McKeever place, and the houses were  fine, equal to the best about Lexington.    A carriage pulled to the side, its two feminine occupants leaning  forward a little under the tilt of dainty parasols, eyes wide. While  their coachman stared open-mouthed at the three dirty, tattered  cavalrymen riding with an assumption of ease, though armed, down the  middle of the avenue.    \"You, suh.\" It was the coachman who hailed Drew. \"You soldier men?\"    Drew reined in the black, who this time obeyed without protest. The  weary miles had taught the gelding submission if not perfect manners.  Transferring his reins to the hand which also steadied the butt of his  carbine against his thigh so that his \"flag\" was well in evidence, Drew  swept off his dust-grayed hat and bowed to the ladies in the carriage.    \"General Morgan's compliments, ladies,\" he said, loud enough for his  words to carry beyond the vehicle to the townspeople gathering on the  walk. \"Flag of truce comin' in, ma'am.\" He spoke directly to the elder  of the two in the carriage. \"Would you be so kind as to direct me to  where I may find the Union commander?\"    \"You're from John Hunt Morgan, young man?\" She shut her parasol with a  snap, held it as if she was considering its use as a weapon.    \"Yes, ma'am. General Morgan, Confederate Army--\"    She sniffed. \"You'll find their captain at the inn, probably. Yankees  and whiskey apparently have an affinity for one another. So John  Morgan's coming to pay us a visit?\"    \"Maybe, ma'am. And where may I find the inn?\"    \"Straight ahead,\" the girl answered. \"You really are Morgan's men?\"    Kirby did not have a hat to doff, but his bow in the saddle was as  graceful as Drew's.    \"That's right, ma'am. My, did we know what we'd find in Bardstown now,  we'd bin ridin' in right sooner!\"    \"Suh! ... Louisa!\" The elder lady's intimidating glare was divided, but  Drew thought that Louisa got more than a half share of it.    \"No offense meant, ma'am. It's jus' that ridin' 'bout the way we do an'  all, we don't git us a chance to say Howdy to ladies.\" The Texan's  expression was properly contrite; his voice all diffidence.    \"The inn, young men, is on down the street. Drive on, Horace!\" she  ordered the coachman. But as the carriage started, she pointed her  parasol at Drew as a teacher might point an admonishing ruler at a  pupil. \"I hope you'll find what you're looking for, young man. In the  way of Yankees....\"    \"We generally do, ma'am,\" Kirby commented. \"For us Yankees jus' turn up  bright an' sassy all over the place.\"    Drew laughed. \"Bright and sassy, then on the run!\" For the success of  his present mission and all those listening ears he ended that boast in  as fervent a tone as he could summon.    \"See that you keep them that way!\" She enforced that order with a snap  of parasol being reopened as the carriage moved from the shade back into  the patch of open sunlight.    \"That sure was a pretty girl,\" observed Driscoll as Drew and the Texan  wheeled back into line with him. \"Wish we could settle down heah for say  two or three days. Git some of the dust outta our throats and have a  chance to say Howdy to some friendly folks--\"    \"You'd be more likely sayin' Howdy to a Yankee prison guard if you did  that,\" Drew replied. \"Let's find this inn and the garrison commander.\"    \"That's the proper way of layin' it out--the inn an' _then_ business.  Yankees an' whiskey go together; that's what she said, ain't it? I maybe  don't weah no blue coat regular, but whiskey sounds sorta refreshin',  don't it, now?\"    \"Just so you only think that, Anse, and don't try any tastin',\" Drew  warned. \"We make our big talk to this captain, and then we move  out--fast. You boys know the drill?\"    \"Sure,\" Driscoll repeated. \"We're the big raiders come to gobble up all  the blue bellies, 'less they walk out all nice an' peaceful, leavin'  their popguns behind 'em for better men to use. I'd say that theah was  the inn, Rennie--\"    They saw their first Yankees, a blot of blue by the horse trough at the  edge of the center square. And Drew, surveying the enemy with a critical  and experienced eye, was sure that he was indeed meeting either green  troops"]]]
