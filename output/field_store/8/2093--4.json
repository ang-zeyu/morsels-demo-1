He no doubt had  his full share of the _Lentulitas_ distinguishing his family. But all  was forgiven by Cicero to a man who had promoted his recall, and he  takes great pains to justify to Lentulus his own change of policy in  regard to the triumvirs after B.C. 56. When the civil war began Lentulus  joined Domitius at Corfinium, and with him fell into Caesar's hands, and  was dismissed unharmed. He afterwards joined Pompey in Epirus, intent on  succeeding Caesar as Pontifex Maximus, as soon as the latter had been  satisfactorily disposed of. After Pharsalia he sought refuge at Rhodes,  but was refused sanctuary by the islanders, and was eventually put to  death, though we do not know by whom (_Att._ xi. 13; _Fam._ ix. 18).    [Sidenote: M. Fadius Gallus, M. Marius, L. Lucceius, C. Scribonius  Curio, C. Trebatius Testa.]    M. FADIUS GALLUS, the Epicurean, and M. MARIUS, the valetudinarian and  wit, were among friends valued for their personal and agreeable  qualities rather than for any public or political importance attaching  to them. The same may be said of L. LUCCEIUS, of whose Roman history  Cicero thought so well, that he wrote a remarkable letter begging for an  honourable place in it for his consulship, as Pliny did to Tacitus.[22]  C. SCRIBONIUS CURIO, son of a great friend of Cicero, after a _jeunesse  orageuse_, returned to Rome from his quaestorship in Asia, in B.C. 53, to  take up the inheritance of his father, which he quickly dissipated.  Cicero seems to have had a high idea of his abilities, and to have  believed him capable of taking the lead of the Optimates. But in his  tribuneship of B.C. 51-50 he disappointed all such hopes by openly  joining Caesar's party, and resisting all attempts to recall him. He  joined Caesar at Ravenna as soon as his tribuneship was out, and urged  him to march on Rome. In B.C. 49 he was sent to secure Sicily and  Africa. The first he did, but in the second he perished in battle  against the senatorial governor and king Iuba. Cicero's relation to C.  TREBATIUS TESTA, a learned jurisconsult, was apparently that of a patron  or tutor, who, thinking that he has found a young man of ability,  endeavours to push him. He sent him with a letter of introduction to  Caesar, who was good-natured, though rather sarcastic as to the scope for  legal abilities to be found in Gaul. He gave him, however, a military  tribuneship, without exacting military duties, and apparently kept on  good terms with him, for he employed him in B.C. 49 to communicate his  wish to Cicero as to his remaining at Rome. Cicero's letters to him,  though numerous, are not among the most interesting. They are full of  banter of a rather forced and dull kind; and Cicero was evidently  annoyed to find that his scheme for advancing Trebatius in Caesar's  province had not been very successful. The friendship, however, survived  the civil war, and we find Cicero in B.C. 44 dedicating his _Topica_ to  Trebatius.    [Footnote 1: That Cicero up to the time of his consulship had been  connected rather with the _populares_ is illustrated by Quintus (_de  Petit._ i.) urging him to make it clear that he had never been a  demagogue, but that if he had ever spoken \"in the spirit of the popular  party, he had done so with the view of attracting Pompey.\"]    [Footnote 2: _De Orat._ ii.

CICERO'S LETTERS          I (A I, 5)      [Sidenote: B.C. 68. Coss., L. Caecilius Metellus, Q. Marcius Rex.]         This opening of the correspondence finds Cicero, now in his       thirty-ninth year, in the midst of his official career. He had       already been quaestor (B.C. 75) and aedile (B.C. 69), and was looking       forward to his election to the praetorship in the next year (B.C.       67). He had already risen almost to the highest place in his       profession as advocate, and had partly delivered, partly published       his great indictment of Verres only a year ago. He is married to       Terentia (B.C. 80), and has one daughter, Tullia or Tulliola, born       on August 5, probably the next year (B.C. 79). His intimacy with T.       Pomponius Atticus (three years his senior), perhaps begun at       school, had lasted at least eleven years, from the time when he met       him at Athens (B.C. 79), and with him had been initiated in the       Eleusinian mysteries (_de Leg._ 2, Sec. 36). There too they had both       seen much of the writer's cousin Lucius, whose death he deplores in       this letter (_de Fin._ 5, Sec. 1). Atticus had lived abroad in Athens       and Epirus, with occasional visits home from B.C. 88 to B.C. 65, in       which latter year he seems to have returned for a more lengthened       stay (Nep. _Att._ 4). The two friends have already corresponded       frequently, but this is the first letter preserved.      TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)    ROME    [Sidenote: B.C. 68, AET. 38]    We are such intimate friends that more than almost anyone else you can  appreciate the grief as well as the actual public and private loss that  the death of my cousin Lucius is to me. There is absolutely no  gratification which any human being can receive from the kindly  character of another that I have not been accustomed to receive from  him. I am sure, therefore, that you will share my grief. For, in the  first place, whatever affects me affects you; and in the second place,  you have yourself lost in him a friend and connexion of the highest  character and most obliging disposition, who was attached to you from  personal inclination, as well as from my conversation.    As to what you say in your letter about your sister,[23] she will  herself bear me witness what pains I have taken that my brother Quintus  should show her proper affection. Thinking him somewhat inclined to be  angry with her, I wrote to him in such a way as I thought would not hurt  his feelings as a brother, while giving him some good advice as my  junior, and remonstrating with him as being in the wrong. The result is  that, from frequent letters since received from him, I feel confident  that everything is as it ought and as we should wish it to be.    As to the frequency of my letters you have no ground for your complaint.  The fact is our good sister Pomponia never informed me of there being a  courier ready to take a letter. Farthermore, I never chanced to know of  anyone going to Epirus,[24] and I was not till recently informed of your  being at Athens.    Again, as to the business of Acutilius which you had left in my hands. I  had settled it on my first visit to Rome after your departure. But it  turned out that, in the first place, there was no urgency in the matter,  and, in the second place, as I felt confidence in your judgment, I  preferred that Peducaeus[25] rather than myself should advise you by  letter on the subject. For having submitted my ears to Acutilius for  several days (and I think you know his style), I should scarcely have  regarded it as a hardship to write you a letter describing his  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21254"],[0,"In Africa: Hunting Adventures in the Big Game Country (#10)"],[1," neatly rolled, ready to be wound around you from the tops of  the shoes to the knee. Your clean flannels (one always wears heavy  flannel underclothes and heavy woolen socks in this climate) are laid  out and your clothes for the day's march are ready for you. You get into  your clothes and boots, go out of your tent, and find there a basin of  hot water and your toilet equipment. The basin is supported on a  three-pronged stick thrust into the ground and makes a thoroughly  satisfactory washstand. The fire in front of the cook's tent is burning  merrily and he and his assistants are busily at work on the morning  breakfast. Twenty other camp-fires are burning around the twenty small  white tents that the porters and others occupy, and scores of half-clad  natives are cooking their breakfasts. The ration that we were required  to give them was a pound and a half of ground-corn a day for each man,  but in good hunting country we got them a good deal of meat to eat. They  are very fond of hartebeest, zebra, rhino, and especially hippo. In  fact, they are eager to eat any kind of meat, so that anything we killed  was certain to be of practical use as food for the porters. This fact  greatly relieves the conscience of the man who shoots an animal for its  fine horns. Six porters sleep in each of the little shelter tents which  we were required to supply them, and this number sleeping so closely  packed served to keep them warm through the cold African highland  nights.    By six o'clock our folding table in the mess tent is laid with white  linen and white enamel dishes for breakfast. So we take our places. If  we are in a fruit country we have some oranges and bananas or papayas, a  sort of pawpaw that is most delicious; it is a cross between a  cantaloupe and a mango. Then we have oatmeal with evaporated cream and  sugar; then we have choice cuts from some animal that was killed the day  before--usually the liver or the tenderloin. Then we have eggs and  finish up on jam or marmalade and honey. We have coffee for breakfast  and tea for the other meals.    While we are eating the tent boys have packed our tin trunks, our  folding tent table, our cots and our pillows, cork mattresses and  blankets. The gunbearer gets our two favorite rifles and cameras,  field-glasses and water bottles. Then down comes the double-roofed green  tents, all is wrapped into closely-packed bags, and before we are  through with breakfast all the tented village has disappeared and only  the mess tent and the two little outlying canvas shelters remain. It is  a scene of great activity. Porters are busily making up their packs and  the head-man with the askaris are busy directing them. In a half-hour  all that remains is a scattered assortment of bundles, all neatly bound  up in stout cords.    One man may carry a tent-bag and poles, another a tin uniform case with  a shot-gun strapped on top; another may have a bedding roll and a chair  or table, and so on until the whole outfit is reduced to eighty compact  bundles which include the food for the porters, the ant-proof food boxes  with our own food, and the horns and skins of our trophies. The work of  breaking camp is reduced to a science.    Our gunbearers are waiting and the saises with the mules are in  readiness. So we start off, usually walking the first hour or two, with  gunbearers and saises and mules trailing along behind. Soon afterward we  look back to see the long procession of porters following along in  single file. Our tent boys carry our third rifle, and behind them all  comes the head-man, ready to spur on any lagging porters.    [Drawing: _Our Safari on the March_]    The early morning hours are bright and cool, but along about nine  o'clock the equatorial sun begins to beat down upon our heavy sun  helmets and our red-lined and padded spine protectors. But it is seldom  hot for long. A cloud passes across the sun and instantly everything is  cooled. A wave of wind sweeps across the hill and cools the moist brow  like a camphor compress. An instant later the sun is out again and the  land lies swimming in the shimmer of heat waves. Distant hills swim on  miragic lakes, and if we are in plains country the mirages appear upon  all sides.    We rarely shot while on a march from camp to camp. We walked or rode  along, watching the swarms of game that slowly moved away as we  approached. The scenery was beautiful. Sometimes we wound along on game  trails or native trails through vast park-like stretches of rolling  hills; at other times we climbed across low hills studded with thorn  scrub, while off in the distance rose the blue hills and mountains. To  the northward, always with us, was the great Mount Kenia, eighteen  thousand feet high and nearly always veiled with masses of clouds. On  her slopes are great droves of elephants, and we could pick out the spot  where three years before Mrs. Akeley had killed her elephant with the  record pair of tusks.    Our marches were seldom long. At noon or even earlier we arrived at our  new camping place, ten or twelve miles from our starting of the morning.  Frequently we loitered along so that the porters might get there first  and the camp be fully established when we arrived. At other times we  arrived early and picked out a spot, where ticks and malaria were not  likely to be bothersome.    We usually camped near a river. Our first camp was on the Athi Plains,  near Nairobi; our second at Nairobi Falls, where the river plunges down  a sixty-foot drop in a spot of great beauty. Our third camp was on the  Induruga River, in a beautiful but malarious spot; our fifth was on the  Thika Thika River, where it was so cold in the morning that the vapor of  our breathing was visible; and our sixth on a wind-blown hill where a  whirlwind blew down our mess tent and scattered the cook's fire until  the whole grass veldt was in furious flames. It took a hundred men an  hour to put out the flames.    Our next camp was at Fort Hall, where a poisonous snake came into my  tent while I was working. It crawled under my chair and was by my feet  when I saw it. It was chased out and killed in the grass near my tent,  and a porter cut out the fangs to show me. For a day or two I looked  before putting on my shoes, but after that I ceased to think of it.    After that time our camps were along the Tana River, in a beautiful  country thronged with game, but, unhappily, a district into which  comparatively few hunters come on account of the fever that is said to  prevail there. We were obliged to leave our mules at Fort Hall because  it was considered certain death to them if we took them into this fly  belt.    When the porters arrive at a camping place a good spot is picked out for  our four tents and mess tent, the cook tent is located, and in a short  time the camp is ready. In my tent the cot is spread, with blankets  airing; the mosquito net is up, the table is ready, with toilet  articles, books and cigars laid out. The three tin uniform cases are in  their places, my cameras are in their places, as are also the guns and  lanterns. A floor cloth covers the ground and a long easy chair is ready  for occupancy. Towels and water are ready, and pajamas and cholera belt  are on the pillow of the cot. Everything is done that should be done,  and I am immediately in a well established house with all my favorite  articles in their accustomed places.    [Drawing: _The Safari in Camp_]    A luncheon, with fruit, meat, curry and a pastry is ready by the time we  are, and then we smoke or sleep through the broiling midday hours. Mr.  Stephenson--or \"Fred,\" as he is with us--and I go out on a scouting  expedition and look for good specimens to add to our collection of horns  or to get food for the porters. Sometimes the whole party went out,  either photographing charging rhinos or shooting, but this part of the  daily program was usually too varied to generalize as part of the daily  doings. Several porters went with each of us to bring in the game, which  there is rarely any uncertainty of securing.    In the evening we return and find our baths of hot water ready. We take  off our heavy hunting boots and slip into the soft mosquito boots. After  which dinner is ready and our menu is strangely varied. Sometimes we  have kongoni steaks, at other times we have the heart of waterbuck or  the liver of bushbuck or impalla. Twice we had rhino tongue and once  rhino tail soup. We eat, and at six o'clock the darkness of night  suddenly spreads over the land. We talk over our several adventures of  the afternoon, some of which may be quite thrilling, and then, with camp  chairs drawn around the great camp-fire, and with the sentinel askari  pacing back and forth, we spend a drowsy hour in talking. Gradually the  sounds of night come on. Off there a hyena is howling or a zebra is  barking, and we know that through all those shadowy masses of trees the  beasts of prey are creeping forth for their night's hunting. The  porters' tents are ranged in a wide semicircle, and their camp-fires  show little groups of men squatting about them. Somewhere one is playing  a tin flute, another is playing a French harp, and some are singing. It  is a picture never to be forgotten, and rich with a charm that will  surely always send forth its call to the restless soul of the man who  goes back to the city.    Sometimes the evening program is different. When one of us brings in  some exceptional trophy there is a great celebration, with singing and  native dances, and cheers for the Bwana who did the heroic deed. The  first lion in a camp is a signal for great rejoicing and  celebrating--however, that is another story--the story of my first lion.    At nine o'clock the tents are closed and all the camp is quiet in sleep.  Outside in the darkness the askari paces to and fro, and the thick  masses of foliage stand out in inky blackness against the brilliant  tropic night. We are far "]]]
