I can not recall a single example from eastern United  States in which it is entirely clear that the clay vessel was modeled in  a basket. The impressions of basket work occasionally seen are only  partial, having been applied after the vessel was practically finished.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. VII  DRAWINGS OF CHARRED FABRIC FROM MOUNDS.]    I present in figure 13, a small earthen vessel from a mound in North  Carolina, the entire exterior surface of which is marked with a fabric,  a pliable cloth or bag woven in the twined styled. The impressions are  not the result of a single application of the texture, but consist of  several disconnected imprintings as if the hand or a paddle covered with  cloth had been used in handling the vessel or in imparting a desired  finish to the surface.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Fabric-marked vase from a mound in North  Carolina.]    Specimens of diagonal fabrics, restored from potsherds, are given in  figures 14 and 15. The first is a very neatly woven diagonal from the  ancient pottery of Polk county, Tennessee. Two series of cords have been  interwoven at right angles to each other, but so arranged as to produce  the diagonal effect. One series of the cords is fine and well twisted,  the other coarser and very slightly twisted. The second is a piece of  matting restored from the impression on a small piece of pottery  collected in Alabama. It was probably made of rushes or heavy blades of  grass.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Diagonal fabric, ancient pottery of Tennessee.]    Twined weaving prevails in the fabrics impressed on pottery as in those  from all other aboriginal sources. An example of the simplest form,  obtained from a small fragment of pottery found in Polk county,  Tennessee, is shown in figure 16. Two series of threads are interwoven  at right angles, the warp being arranged in pairs and the woof singly.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Fabric from the ancient pottery of Alabama.]    At each intersection the pairs of warp threads are twisted half around  upon themselves, inclosing the woof threads and holding them quite  firmly, so that the open net-like effect is well preserved even under  strain or in long continued use. There are many varieties of this form  of fabric resulting from differences in size and spacing of the threads.  These differences are well brought out in the succeeding figures.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Twined fabric from ancient pottery, Tennessee.]    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Twined fabric from ancient pottery, Tennessee.]    In figure 17 we have a characteristic example of this fabric, obtained  from a fragment of pottery from a mound at Sevierville, Tennessee.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. VIII  COPPER CELTS WITH REMNANTS OF CLOTH.]    The impression is quite perfect. The cords are somewhat uneven, and seem  to have been only moderately well twisted. They were probably made of  hemp fiber. It will be observed that the threads of the web are placed  at regular intervals, while those of the woof are irregularly placed. It  may be noticed that in one case the woof has not been doubled, the  single thread having, as a consequence, exactly the same relation to the  opposing series as corresponding threads in simple interlacing. The  impression, of which this is only a part, indicates that the cloth used  in shaping the vessel was considerably distorted when applied to the  soft clay.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Twined fabric from ancient salt vessel,  Illinois.]    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Twined fabric from ancient salt vessel,  Illinois.]    Nowhere else are found so many fine impressions of fabrics on clay  vessels as in the ancient salt-making localities of the Mississippi  valley. The huge bowls or vats used by the primitive salt-maker have  generally been modeled in coarse, open fabrics, or have had cloths  impressed upon them for ornament. In figures 18 and 19 fine examples of  these impressions are given. The latter engraving illustrates a specimen  in which every detail is perfectly preserved. Only a small portion of  the original is shown in the cut. It is noticeable that the cords are  quite heavy and well twisted, although the spacing is somewhat  irregular.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Twined fabric from a piece of clay, Arkansas.]    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Twined fabric from ancient pottery, Tennessee.]    The example given in figure 20, impressed on a fragment of clay from  Arkansas, has an ornamental border produced by looping the cords of the  web, which seem to have been five in number, each one passing over four  others before recrossing the frame. A specimen showing a somewhat  different border is given in figure 21.    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Twined fabric from ancient pottery, Missouri.]    The interesting specimen illustrated in figure 22 was obtained from a  small fragment of pottery found in Ripley county, Missouri. The  combination of the two series of strands clearly indicates the type of  fabric, the twisted cords of the woof being placed very far apart. The  warp is of braid formed by plaiting strands of untwisted fiber, probably  bast. All the details are shown in the most satisfactory manner in the  clay cast.    [Illustration: FIG. 23.--Twined fabric from ancient pottery, Carter  county, Tennessee.]    In figure 23 we have a similar fabric closely woven or impacted. I have  made the drawing to show fillets of fiber appearing at the ends; these  do not appear in the impression. It is highly probable, however, that  these fillets are plaited bands, as in the preceding example. They are  wide and flat, giving somewhat the effect of basket-work of splints or  rushes.    [Illustration: FIG. 24.--Twined fabric from ancient pottery, Tennessee.]    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--Twined fabric from ancient pottery, Tennessee.]    Another variety of the twined fabrics, distinguished by peculiarities in  the combinations of the threads, is illustrated in figures 24 and 25.  The threads of the warp are arranged in pairs as in the specimens  already described, but are twisted in such a way as to inclose two of  the opposing series instead of one, each succeeding pair of warp threads  taking up alternate pairs of the woof threads. Figure 25 is from a small  piece of pottery exhumed from a mound on Fain island, Jefferson county,  Tennessee. The threads of the woof are quite close together, those of  the web being far apart.    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--Twined fabric, with patterns, Ohio valley.]    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--Net from ancient pottery, District of  Columbia.]    That the native love of decoration had a marked influence on the  weavers' art in its simplest and rudest as well as higher forms is well  evinced even in the meager vestiges brought to light by researches in  the mounds. Decorative borders and fanciful combinations of strands are  shown in some of the preceding cuts, and figure 26, copied from a  pottery fragment obtained in the Ohio valley, indicates a more ambitious  attempt at embellishment. The fabric was evidently of ornate design and  the execution excellent.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. IX BITS  OF FABRIC-MARKED POTTERY, WITH CLAY CASTS OF SAME]    Plate IX is intended to convey a clear notion of the nature and  appearance of fabric-marked pottery and of the manner of securing  positive impressions in clay. Three bits of pottery from Illinois are  placed at the left, and the three casts appear at the right. All  illustrate open fabrics of comparatively simple pattern done in the  characteristic twined style.    [Illustration: FIG. 28.--Net from ancient pottery, North Carolina.]    Nets were in use by the Indians of Florida and Virginia at the time of  the discovery, and the ancient pottery of the Atlantic states has  preserved impressions of innumerable specimens. The piece shown in  figure 27 is from a small fragment of pottery picked up in the District  of Columbia. The impression is so perfect that the twist of the cord and  the form of the knot may be seen with ease. Most of the examples from  this locality are of much finer cord and have a less open mesh than the  specimen illustrated. The net illustrated in figure 28 is from a  specimen of North Carolina pottery. Netting of this class was still in  use among the natives of the Chesapeake region when the English colonies  were founded.    The lesson of the prehistoric textile art of eastern United States is  simple and easily read, and goes far to round out the story of native  occupation and culture. Colonial records furnish definite knowledge of  the woven fabrics and weaving of the nations first encountered by the  whites. Graves, mounds, and caves give us an insight into the  pre-Columbian status of the art, and evidence furnished by associated  industries which happen to echo features of the textile art contribute  to our information. Charred cloths from the great mounds are identical  in material, combination of parts, and texture with the fabrics of the  simple savage. Cloths preserved by contact with copper implements and  ornaments characteristic of the art of the builders of the mounds do not  differ in any way from the humble work of the historic peoples. All tell  the same story of a simple, primitive culture, hardly advanced beyond  the grade separating the savage from the barbarous condition.       [51] Nat. and Abor. Hist, of Tenn., John Haywood.

I feel--see--something awful coming. In  the universal German hate, the national boundary stops any flow  outward of sympathy, good faith, equity. All peoples outside are  human insects whom it is proper for the Teuton to tread on if he  can, crush the life out of, because they are in his pathway to  glory.\"    Kirtley, who had stared at his new friend in this solemnity, turned  a serious face toward the clawlike branches of his linden in its  gauntness of late autumn-tide. This meaning of the animus that was  impelling his odd and yet so normal German household, he began to  see, was substantiated by a score of acts and attitudes in its daily  life. He scarcely deemed it proper to tell of them.    Besides, he did not want to fire up Anderson who already was so  unsettled, so comfortless, on the subject. But Kirtley was reasoning  out how this animus gave a solidity, a solidarity, to the German  household--a satisfied contentment--because it was working toward a  definite racial goal. Any such incentive was almost absent in the  American family.    \"And so,\" wound up Anderson with epigrams, \"the years will be left  humanity to weep these days of _insouciance_ and neglect. You can  see that Germany is a man-made nation. It is not the kind God or  Nature would make. God must have turned His face when the Teuton  species was manufactured. Germany is like a man-made hot air  register. When it isn't throwing up hot air, it is throwing up cold  air. It is always throwing up.\"    To change the somewhat painful theme, Kirtley soon began:    \"I don't see any sports--such as we know them--in Germany. How do  they get along without them?\" Like all Yankee college men he was  alert on these lines.    \"No sports in Deutschland. Go out on the Dresden golf links of a  morning and you'll find hardly a German soul playing. It's the same  in Vienna--the same in Berlin. They have links because it's the  fashion in England. The Germans ape everything. Go out on the  highway to Berlin or Vienna or any of the great roads and you will  seldom meet any Germans touring in their motors for pleasure. Only  Americans--English. The Germans are spoiling little time by such  matters. They are busy--busy working for their Empire--busy like  moles boring away to undermine the earth--busy drilling with arms.    \"So you see no sporting terms incorporated in their daily language,  in their newspaper language, such as we see in England and  America--terms denoting fair play, square deal, manly courtesy  toward the under dog. Our Anglo-Saxon motto, 'Don't hit him when  he's down,' is no motto with the Germans. They think that's just the  time _to_ hit him. Kick him when he's flattened out. Kick him  preferably in the face. That's one reason so many Teutons have  scarred faces. The Anglo-Saxon spirit in a sporting crowd is for the  little fellow. In Germany, it's for the big fellow--the fellow who  already has everything on his side.    \"This sort of thing, of course, kills the true idea and fun of  sport. Take away its knightliness of bearing, spirit of  self-sacrifice, exhibition of pluck though defeat is certain, and  what have you left to sport about? It merely becomes a question of  brute force--overwhelming force. You have cruelty left as a net  result. And that's a large part of German conduct--cruelty to  underlings or to those who are feebler or caught at an unfair  disadvantage. Having no leaven of sports is one thing that makes the  German life seem so heavy, ominous, brutal, to us.\"    \"Its growling rigidity, with all this,\" Anderson continued gravely,  \"is due to the fact that the old men are mainly in the saddle in  Germany--men sixty and seventy. The existence and influence of young  men are not as much in command as with us. These old Germans have  disgruntled stomachs from so much drinking, and they roar about.  Physical sports mean nothing to them. And so it seems sometimes as  if the Germans are born old, not young. Their children are old. This  helps make them such a serious race--the most serious. And yet  people insist on believing that this serious race means nothing but  fun by all its military preparations. Where's the logic?\"...    When the journalist went, Kirtley let him through the wall gate with  its weighted rope. The gate flew back in place with a loud report as  if to give emphasis to the old man's direful interpretations and  prophecies.          CHAPTER XII    HABITS AND CHILDREN      In spite of Anderson, Gard could not make up his mind that Rudolph  was anything more than a young braggadocio. The idea of an ordinary  family living comfortably along with a spy in its midst, ready to  inform on them and their guests, was so foreign to his notions, so  caddish, that it weakened his confidence in his compatriot's  judgment. While Gard felt that Rudi was not \"straight,\" he could not  consider him downright harmful. However, under the spur of the  valuable significance that Anderson attached to this typical  household life, Kirtley felt it profitable to observe closely its  manifestations and opinions. They were verified in other German  families where Gard often went with the Buchers. What could be more  truly educational?    In defiance of the famous Teuton discipline, a certain  disorderliness ran through the management of Villa Elsa. This  surprised him. The eruptive way meals were served, the jumbled-up  spectacle of the dining table, beds made up at any time of day,  knitting and sewing going on in many rooms--all this was in  unforeseen contrast to the rigorous military and educational  training and precision. He could but compare the _genre_ picture of  looseness in the homes with that of the correct and fine army.    The inadequate, almost primitive, bathing facilities in Villa Elsa  corresponded to the unscoured condition of its occupants. The  unsightly hairiness of German skins seemed to answer for much  washing. There was little thought of soap and hot water as a law of  health, a delight, a luxury. Kirtley had assumed that soiled bodies  did not betoken the loftiest state of man. But the bath was looked  upon here as a disagreeable performance and accordingly was only  indulged in at infrequent intervals. It was discussed freely at  table as a forthcoming, dreaded event. Gard bathed in town. As for  fresh underwear and hose, they were talked of over soup like some  new and rare dispensation of Providence.    Fraeulein alone had a toothbrush and powder, and they appeared rather  conspicuously here and there as if they were modern ornaments of  which the household was visibly proud. Bad breaths coming from  decayed teeth and from stomachs sour with drink were freely blown  about and without apologies. Indeed, apologies about anything were  small features at all times.    There was no particular provision for the maid. Gard scarcely knew  where or how she slept. Tekla dressed with unconcern in the kitchen  and in the hall. Servant girls were rather considered like calves  and therefore entitled to scant human consideration. The odors, the  unsightly colors, the clatter of the German home, gave further  evidence of the absence of sensitiveness, of any fine and balanced  poise of nerves.    This repulsiveness of existence, of course, did not affect the  audible consciousness of the family about their representing the  most progressive state of civilized man. And not to be forgotten was  the German ill-temperedness, which was pronounced in the morning,  and did not wear off considerably until stomachs were filled during  the day. All these facts testified that the Teuton little cultivates  loveliness in human contact. Beauty of living is not, with him, a  natural end to attain.    After awhile it came over Kirtley that the Buchers showed no  interest in his antecedents or in his country. Their apparent  ignorance of America was rivaled by their indifference about it.  They evidently were of the firm conclusion that there was nothing  worth while there to learn, nothing worthy of attention. It was, to  them, an unprofitable jumble of peoples and things in a rudimentary,  unvarnished state of development. It was Patagonia trying to copy  the ways of Europe. This was but a feature of the Teuton tribal  belief that all the racial evolutions outside the German borders  were undesirable, demoralizing and mischievously blocking the  outspread of _Kultur_.    Gard could not but know of the limited income on which existence  went on at Villa Elsa. It was characteristic. Though limited, the  income was _secure_. Despite the economies practiced, the prevailing  confidence and self-satisfaction did not suffer, as a result, the  slightest impairment. It was significantly German.    Gard said to himself:    \"There are here none of the spectacular ups and downs, everlasting  sudden changes and movings to and fro, riches one year, poverty the  next, the unsettledness and acute money misfortunes, that make up so  large a share of our feverish, restless, uncertain Yankee careers.  There does not seem to be a synonym for 'hard up' in German. As for  us Americans the habitual changes of location of the household, the  separation of the parents for reasons of business, travel, or  inharmonious temperaments, the resultant ever-growing crop of  divorces, the frequent living apart of the children, both from  fathers and mothers and from the home, the loose family ties and  ignoring of kin who are not of the most immediate relationship--how  far is all this from the steady, compact, solid, unanxious and  unthreatened examples of Villa Elsa and German households in  general!\"    The Teutons had a paternal Government which they knew would not let  them come to want. Their firesides could thrive and accomplish  greatly on so small a basis because this was stationary and  unfailing. The American needed so much more because, with him,"]]]
