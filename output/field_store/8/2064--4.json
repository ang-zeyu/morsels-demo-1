She knew they meant to tease, and the fewer sparks they could  raise from her the sooner they would desist and let the matter drop. It  would probably serve as a target for Addie's wit till the end of the  term, unless the excitement of the newly formed ambulance class chased  it from her memory. The Woodlanders were trying to do their duty by  their country, and all the girls were enthusiastically practising  bandaging.    \"I wish we'd some real patients to bind up,\" sighed Merle one day, as V  B took its turn under Nurse Griffith's instructions.    \"I'd be sorry for them if they were left to your tender mercies,\"  retorted Mavis, who had been posing as patient. \"My arm's sore yet with  your vigorous measures.\"    \"What nonsense! I was as gentle as a lamb.\"    \"A curious variety of lamb then, with a wolf inside.\"    \"I believe The Woodlands would make a gorgeous hospital,\" suggested  Addie hopefully. \"When we're through our course we might have some real  patients down and nurse them.\"    \"Don't you think it! The Rainbow won't carry ambulance lessons as far as  that!\"          CHAPTER VI    Quits      Ulyth, brushing her hair before the looking-glass one morning, hummed  cheerily.    \"You seem in spirits,\" commented Rona, from the washstand. \"It's more  than I am. Miss Lodge was a pig yesterday. She said my dictation was a  disgrace to the school, and I'd got to stop in during the interval this  morning and write out all the wrong words a dozen times each. It's too  sickening! I'd no luck yesterday. Phyllis Chantrey had my book to  correct, and her writing and mine are such opposite poles, we daren't  try it on.\"    \"Try what on?\" asked Ulyth, pausing with the brush in her hand.    \"Why, the exchange dodge, you know.\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"Don't you take dictation in V B? Well, in our form we get it twice a  week, and Miss Lodge makes us correct each other's books. We make it up  to try and exchange with a girl whose writing's pretty like one's own;  then, you see, we can alter things neatly, and allow full marks. It  generally works, but it didn't yesterday.\"    Ulyth's face was a study.    \"You mean to tell me you correct each other's mistakes!\"    \"Why not?\" said Rona, not the least abashed. \"Miss Lodge never finds  out.\"    Ulyth collapsed into a chair. What was she to do with such a girl?    \"Don't you know it's the most atrocious cheating?\"    \"Is it? Why, the whole form does it,\" returned the Cuckoo unconcernedly.    \"Then they're abominable little wretches, and don't deserve to be  candidates for the Camp-fire League. I'm thoroughly ashamed of them.  Have they no sense of honour?\"    The Cuckoo was looking perplexed.    \"Ulyth Stanton, you're always rounding something new on me,\" she sighed.  \"I can't keep up with you. I keep my hair tidy now, and don't leave my  things lying round the room, and I try to give a sort of twitter instead  of laughing, and I've dropped ever so many words you object to, and  practise walking down the passage with a book on my head. What more do  you want?\"    \"A great deal,\" said Ulyth gravely. \"Didn't you learn honour at home?\"    \"Catch Mrs. Barker!\"    \"But surely your father----?\"    \"I saw so little of Dad. He was out all day, and sometimes off for weeks  together at our other block. When he was at home he didn't care to be  bothered overmuch.\"    An amazed pity was taking the place of Ulyth's indignation. This was,  indeed, fallow ground. Mrs. Arnold's comment flashed across her mind:    \"What an opportunity for a Torch-bearer!\"    \"I don't want to be turned into a prig,\" urged the Cuckoo.    \"You needn't. There's a certain amount of slang and fun that's  allowable, but _noblesse oblige_ must always come first. You don't  understand French yet? Well, never mind. All that matters is that you  simply must realize, Rona--do listen, please--that all of us here,  including you, mustn't--couldn't--cheat at lessons. For your own sake,  and for the sake of the school, you must stop it.\"    \"You think a lot of the school!\"    \"And quite right too! The school stands to us for what the State does to  grown-up people. We've got to do our best to keep the tone up. Cheating  brings it down with a run. It's as bad as tearing up treaties.\"    \"Go ahead. Rub it in,\" returned the Cuckoo, beginning to whistle a  trifle defiantly.    She thought the matter over, nevertheless, and returned to the subject  that night when they were going to bed.    \"Ulyth, I told the girls exactly what you said about them. My gracious,  you should have seen their faces! Boiled lobsters weren't in it. That  hit about the Camp-fire Guild seemed specially to floor them. I don't  fancy, somehow, there'll be any more correcting done in dictation.  You've touched them up no end.\"    \"I'm extremely glad if what I said has brought them to their senses,\"  declared Ulyth.    Rona got on tolerably well among her comrades, but there was one  exception. With Stephanie she was generally in a state of guerrilla  warfare. The latter declared that the vulgar addition to the school was  an outrage on the feelings of those who had been better brought up.  Stephanie had ambitions towards society with a big S, and worshipped  titles. She would have liked the daughter of a duke for a schoolfellow,  but so far no member of the aristocracy had condescended to come and be  educated at The Woodlands. Stephanie felt injured that Miss Bowes and  Miss Teddington should have accepted such a girl as Rona, and lost no  opportunity of showing that she thought the New Zealander very far below  the accepted standard. The Cuckoo's undoubted good looks were perhaps  another point in her disfavour. The school beauty did not easily yield  place to a rival, and though she professed to consider Rona's complexion  too high-coloured, she had a sneaking consciousness that it was superior  to her own.    During the summer holidays Stephanie had taken part in a pageant that  was held in aid of a charity near her home. As Queen of the Roses she  had occupied a rather important position, and her portrait, in her  beautiful fancy costume, had appeared in several of the leading ladies'  newspapers. Stephanie's features were good, and the photograph had been  a very happy one--\"glorified out of all knowledge\" said some of the  girls; so the photographer had exhibited it in his window, and  altogether more notice had been taken of it than was perhaps salutary  for the original. Stephanie had brought a copy back to school, and it  now adorned her bedroom mantelpiece. She was never tired of descanting  upon the pageant, and telling about all the aristocratic people who had  come to see it. According to her account the very flower of the  neighbourhood had been present, and had taken special notice of her. A  girl who had so lately consorted with the county could not be expected  to tolerate a tyro from the backwoods. Stephanie was too well brought up  to allow herself to be often openly rude; her taunts were generally  ingeniously veiled, but they were none the less aggravating for that.  The Cuckoo might be callow in some respects, but in others she was very  much up-to-date. Though she would look obtuse, and pretend not to  understand, as a matter of fact not a gibe was lost upon her, and she  kept an exact account of the score.    One morning, early in December, Miss Teddington, who was distributing  the contents of the postbag, handed Stephanie a small parcel. It was  only a few days after the latter's birthday, and, supposing it to be a  belated present, the mistress did not ask the usual questions by which  she regulated her pupils' correspondence. The letters were always given  out immediately after breakfast, and the girls took them upstairs to  read in their dormitories during the quarter of an hour in which they  made their beds and tidied their rooms. This morning, just as Ulyth was  shaking her pillow, Rona came in, chuckling to herself. The Cuckoo's  eyes twinkled like stars.    \"D'you want some sport?\" she asked. \"If you do, come with me, and have  the time of your life!\"    Ulyth put down the pillow, and hesitated. Fifteen minutes was not too  long an allowance for all she was expected to do in her room. But Rona's  manner was inviting. She wanted to see what the fun was. The temptress  held the door open, and beckoned beguilingly.    \"All serene!\" yielded Ulyth.    Rona seized her by the arm and dragged her delightedly down the passage.    \"Now you're chummy,\" she murmured. \"Whatever you do, though, don't make  a noise and give the show away!\"    Still in the dark as to the Cuckoo's intentions, Ulyth allowed herself  to be led to Dormitory 2, No. 4, at the opposite side of the house. We  have mentioned before that the bedrooms at The Woodlands were very  spacious--so large, indeed, that each was partitioned into four cubicles  divided by lath-and-plaster walls. A passage inside the dormitory gave  access to the cubicles, which were in fact separate little bedrooms,  except that the partition walls, for purposes of ventilation, did not  reach the ceiling. At present the fourth cubicle in Dormitory 2 was  unoccupied, but its furniture was rather curiously arranged. One of the  beds had been pulled close against the partition, and a chest of  drawers, with the drawers removed, had been placed upon it.    \"I fixed it up last night, and it was a job,\" whispered the Cuckoo.  \"Good thing I'm strong. Now we've got to climb on that, and you'll see  what you'll see!\"    Ulyth had an uneasy consciousness that she ought not to be mixed up in  such a business; but, after all, the girls often scrambled up and peeped  into one another's cubicles for a joke, so her action would not be  without precedent. She was a very human person, and liked fun as well as  anybody. With extreme caution she and Rona mounted the chest of drawers,  trying not to make the slightest noise.

The Tenth of August produced a considerable change in  Robespierre's point of view. It awoke him to the precipitous steepness  of the slope down which the revolutionary car was rushing headlong. His  faith in the infallibility of the people suffered no shock, but he was  in a moment alive to the need of walking warily, and his whole march  from now until the end, twenty-three months later, became timorous,  cunning, and oblique. His intelligence seemed to move in subterranean  tunnels, with the gleam of an equivocal premiss at one end, and the mist  of a vague conclusion at the other.    The enthusiastic pedant, with his narrow understanding, his thin purism,  and his idyllic sentimentalism, found that the summoning archangel of  his paradise proved to be a ruffian with a pike. The shock must have  been tremendous. Robespierre did not quail nor retreat; he only revised  his notion of the situation. A curious interview once took place between  him and Marat. Robespierre began by assuring the Friend of the People  that he quite understood the atrocious demands for blood with which the  columns of Marat's newspaper were filled, to be merely useful  exaggerations of his real designs. Marat repelled the disparaging  imputation of clemency and common sense, and talked in his familiar vein  of poniarding brigands, burning despots alive in their palaces, and  impaling the traitors of the Assembly on their own benches.  'Robespierre,' says Marat, 'listened to me with affright; he turned pale  and said nothing. The interview confirmed the opinion I had always had  of him, that he united the integrity of a thoroughly honest man and the  zeal of a good patriot, with the enlightenment of a wise senator, but  that he was without either the views or the audacity of a real  statesman.' The picture is instructive, for it shows us Robespierre's  invariable habit of leaving violence and iniquity unrebuked; of  conciliating the practitioners of violence and iniquity; and of  contenting himself with an inward hope of turning the world into a right  course by fine words. He had no audacity in Marat's sense, but he was no  coward. He knew, as all these men knew, that almost from hour to hour he  carried his life in his hand, yet he declined to seek shelter in the  obscurity which saved such men as Sieyes. But if he had courage, he had  not the initiative of a man of action. He invented none of the ideas or  methods of the Revolution, not even the Reign of Terror, but he was very  dexterous in accepting or appropriating what more audacious spirits than  himself had devised and enforced. The pedant, cursed with the ambition  to be a ruler of men, is a curious study. He would be glad not to go too  far, and yet his chief dread is lest he be left behind. His  consciousness of pure aims allows him to become an accomplice in the  worst crimes. Suspecting himself at bottom to be a theorist, he hastens  to clear his character as man of practice by conniving at an enormity.  Thus, in September 1792, a band of miscreants committed the grievous  massacres in the prisons of Paris. Robespierre, though the best evidence  goes to show that he not only did not abet the prison murders, but in  his heart deplored them, yet after the event did not scruple to justify  what had been done. This was the beginning of a long course of  compliance with sanguinary misdeeds, for which Robespierre has been as  hotly execrated as if he prompted them. We do not, for the moment,  measure the relative degrees of guilt that attached to mere compliance  on the one hand, and cruel origination on the other. But his position in  the Revolution is not rightly understood, unless we recognise him as  being in almost every case an accessory after the fact.    Between the fall of Lewis in 1792 and the fall of Robespierre in 1794,  France was the scene of two main series of events. One set comprises the  repulse of the invaders, the suppression of an extensive civil war, and  the attempted reconstruction of a social framework. The other comprises  the rapid phases of an internecine struggle of violent and short-lived  factions. By an unhappy fatality, due partly to anti-democratic  prejudice, and partly to men's unfailing passion for melodrama, the  Reign of Terror has been popularly taken for the central and most  important part of the revolutionary epic. This is nearly as absurd as it  would be to make Gustave Flourens' manifestation of the Fifth of  October, or the rising of the Thirty-first of October, the most  prominent features in a history of the war of French defence in our own  day. In truth, the Terror was a mere episode; and just as the rising of  October 1870 was due to Marshal Bazaine's capitulation at Metz, it is  easy to see that, with one exception, every violent movement in Paris,  from 1792 to 1794, was due to menace or disaster on the frontier. Every  one of the famous days of Paris was an answer to some enemy without. The  storm of the Tuileries on the Tenth of August, as we have already said,  was the response to Brunswick's proclamation. The bloody days of  September were the reaction of panic at the capture of Longwy and Verdun  by the Prussians. The surrender of Cambrai provoked the execution of  Marie Antoinette. The defeat of Aix-la-Chapelle produced the abortive  insurrection of the Tenth of March; and the treason of Dumouriez, the  reverses of Custine, and the rebellion in La Vendee, produced the  effectual insurrection of the Thirty-first of May 1793. The last of  these two risings of Paris, headed by the Commune, against the  Convention which was until then controlled by the Girondins, at length  gave the government of France and the defence of the Revolution  definitely over to the Jacobins. Their patriotic dictatorship lasted  unbroken for a short period of ten months, and then the great party  broke up into factions. The splendid triumphs of the dictatorship have  been, in England at any rate, too usually forgotten, and only the crimes  of the factions remembered. Robespierre's history unfortunately belongs  to the less important battle.      II    The Girondins were driven out of the Convention by the insurgent  Parisians at the beginning of June 1793. The movement may be roughly  compared to that of the Independents in our own Rebellion, when the army  compelled the withdrawal of eleven of the Presbyterian leaders from the  parliament; or, it may recall Pride's memorable Purge of the same famous  assembly. Both cases illustrate the common truth that large deliberative  bodies, be they never so excellent for purposes of legislation, and even  for a general control of the executive government in ordinary times, are  found to be essentially unfit for directing a military crisis. If there  are any historic examples that at first seem to contradict such a  proposition, it will be found that the bodies in question were close  aristocracies, like the Great Council of Venice, or the Senate of Rome  in the strong days of the Commonwealth; they were never the creatures of  popular election, with varying aims and a diversified political spirit.  Modern publicists have substituted the divine right of assemblies for  the old divine right of monarchies. Those who condone the violence done  to the King on the Tenth of August, and even acquiesce in his execution  five months afterwards, are relentless against the violence done to the  Convention on the Thirty-first of May. We confess ourselves unable to  follow this transfer of the superstition of sacrosanctity from a king to  a chamber. No doubt, the sooner a nation acquires a settled government,  the better for it, provided the government be efficient. But if it be  not efficient, the mischief of actively suppressing it may well be fully  outweighed by the mischief of retaining it. We have no wish to smooth  over the perversities of a revolutionary time; they cost a nation very  dear; but if all the elements of the state are in furious convulsion and  uncontrollable effervescence, then it is childish to measure the march  of events by the standard of happier days of social peace and political  order. The prospect before France at the violent close of Girondin  supremacy was as formidable as any nation has ever yet had to confront  in the history of the world. Rome was not more critically placed when  the defeat of Varro on the plain of Cannae had broken up her alliances  and ruined her army. The brave patriots of the Netherlands had no  gloomier outlook at that dolorous moment when the Prince of Orange had  left them, and Alva had been appointed to bring them back by rapine,  conflagration, and murder, under the loathed yoke of the Spanish tyrant.    Let us realise the conditions that Robespierre and Danton and the other  Jacobin leaders had now to face. In the north-west one division of the  fugitive Girondins was forming an army at Caen; in the south-west  another division was doing the same at Bordeaux. Marseilles and Lyons  were rallying all the disaffected and reactionary elements in the  south-east. La Vendee had flamed out in wild rebellion for Church and  King. The strong places on the north frontier, and the strong places on  the east, were in the hands of the foreign enemy. The fate of the  Revolution lay in the issue of a struggle between Paris, with less than  a score of departments on her side, and all the rest of France and the  whole European coalition marshalled against her. And even this was not  the worst. In Paris itself a very considerable proportion of its  half-million of inhabitants were disaffected to the revolutionary cause.  Reactionary historians dwell on the fact that such risings as that of  the Tenth of August were devised by no more than half of the sections  into which Paris was divided. It was common, they say, for half a dozen  individuals to take upon themselves to represent the fourteen or fifteen  hundred other members of a section."]]]
