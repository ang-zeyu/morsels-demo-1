What madness!\" Now Bartolome's face expressed shock.    \"Not breaking,\" Drew corrected, \"training. It is another method  altogether. One puts a weanling on a rope halter, accustoms him to the  feel of the hackamore, of being with men. Then he grows older knowing no  fear or strangeness.\"    The Mexican looked from Drew to _Don_ Cazar, his shock fading to  puzzlement. Rennie nodded.    \"_Si, amigo_, so it is done--in Kentucky and Virginia. But this time we  must deal with the older ones. Can you modify those methods, gentle  without breaking? A colt with the fire still in him, but saddle-broke, is  worth much more--\"    \"I can try. But you have already said, suh, that you don't allow rough  breakin' here.\" Drew's half suspicion crystallized into belief. _Don_  Cazar had not really wanted another wrangler at all; he had wanted  Shiloh--and his foals. Well, perhaps he would find he did have a wrangler  who could deliver the goods into the bargain.    \"No, but it is always well to learn new ways. I have been in Kentucky,  Kirby. Perhaps some of their methods would not work on the Range. On the  other hand, others might. As you have said--we can but try.\" He picked up  the top sheet of paper and began to read:    \"_Bayos-blancos_--light duns--two. _Bayos-azafranados_--saffrons--one.  _Bayos-narajados_--orange duns--none----\"    \"There was one,\" Bartolome interrupted. \"The mare, she was lost at Canon  del Palomas.\"    Rennie frowned, \"_Si_, the mare. _Bayos-tigres_--striped ones --three.  _Bayos-cebrunos_--smoked duns--two. _Grullas_--blues--four. Roans--six.  Blacks--three. Bays--four. Twenty-five three-year-olds. You won't be  expected to take on the whole _remuda_, Kirby. Select any six of your own  choosing and use your methods of gentling on them. We'll make a test this  way.\"    Bartolome uttered a sound closer to a snort than anything else. And Drew  guessed how he stood with the Mexican foreman. Rennie might have faith, or  pretend to have faith, in some new method of training, but Rivas was a  conservative who preferred the tried and true and undoubtedly considered  the Kentuckian an interloper.    \"Now, the matter of Shiloh...\"    Drew finished the sherry with appreciation. He was beginning to see the  amusing side of this conference. Drew's work on the Range settled, Rennie  was about to get to what he really wanted. But _Don_ Cazar's first words  were a little startling.    \"We'll keep him close-in the water corral. To turn a stud of eastern  breeding loose is dangerous----\"    \"You mean he might be stolen, suh?\" Drew clicked his empty glass down on  the table.    \"No, he might be killed!\" And Rennie's tone indicated he meant just that.    \"How...why?\"    \"There are wild-horse bands out there, though we're trying to capture or  run them off the Range. And a wild stud will always try to add mares to  his band. Because he has fought many times to keep or take mares, he is a  formidable and vicious opponent, one that an imported, tamed stud can  rarely best. Right now, coming into Big Rock well for water is a pinto  that has killed three other stallions--including a black I imported back in  '60--and two of them were larger, heavier animals than he.    \"The Trinfans are moving down into that section this week. I hope they can  break up that band, run down the stud anyway. He has courage and cunning,  but his blood is not a line we want for foals on this range. So Shiloh  stays here at the Stronghold; don't risk him loose.\"    \"Yes, suh. What about these wild ones--they worth huntin'?\"    \"They're mixed; some are scrubs, inbred, poor stuff. But a few fine ones  turn up. Mostly when they do they're strays or bred from strays--escaped  from horse thieves or Indians. If the mustangers here pick up any branded  ones, they're returned to the owners, if possible, or sold at a yearly  auction. By the old Mexican law the hunting season for horses runs from  October to March. Foals are old enough then to be branded. Speaking of  foals, you left your mare and the filly in town?\"    \"Kells'll give them stable room till next month. I can bring them out  then.\"    \"We'll have a delivery of remounts to make to the camp about then. You can  help haze those in and pick up your own stock on return.\"    Leon appeared in the doorway. \"_Don_ Cazar, the _mesteneoes_--they arrive.\"    \"Good. These people are the real wild-horse experts, Kirby. Not much the  Trinfans don't know about horses.\" _Don_ Cazar was already on his way to  the door and Drew fell in behind Bartolome.    The Trinfan outfit was small, considering the job they intended, Drew  thought. A cart pulled by two mules, lightly made and packed high, was the  nucleus of their small caravan. Burros--two of them--were roped behind and,  to Drew's surprise, a cow, bawling fretfully and intended, he later  learned, to play foster mother to any unweaned foals which might be picked  up. The cart was driven by a Mexican in leather breeches and jacket over a  red shirt. Behind him rode the boy and girl Drew had seen in the Tubacca  alley, mounted on rangy, nervous horses that had speed in every line of  their under-fleshed bodies. Each rider trailed four spare mounts roped  nose to tail.    \"_Buenos dias, Don_ Cazar.\" For so small a man the Mexican on the cart  seat produced a trumpet-sized voice. He touched the roll-edged brim of his  sombrero, and Drew noted that his arm was crooked as if in the past it had  been broken and poorly set.    \"_Buenos dias, Senor_ Trinfan. This house is yours.\" Rennie went to the  side of the cart. \"The west corral is ready for your use as always. Draw  on the stores for any need you may have--\"    \"_Gracias, Don_ Cazar.\" It was the thanks of equal to equal. \"You have  some late news of the wild ones?\"    \"Only that the pinto still runs near the well.\"    \"That spotted one--_si_, he is an Apache for cunning, for deviltry of  spirit. It may be that this time he will not be the lucky one. There is in  him a demon. Did I not see him, with my own eyes, kill a foal, tear flesh  from the flanks of its dam when she tried to drop out of the run? _Si_--a  real _diablo_, that one!\"    \"Get rid of him one way or another, Trinfan. He is a danger to the Range.  He killed another stud this season. I am as sure of that as if I had seen  him in action.\"    \"Ah, the blue one you thought might be a runner to match Oro. _Si_, that  was a great pity, _Don_ Cazar. Well, we shall try, we shall try this time  to put that _diablo_ under!\"    An hour later Drew was facing a _diablo_ of his own, with far less  confidence than Hilario Trinfan had voiced. Just how stupid could one be?  Around him now were men trained from early childhood to this life, and he  could show no skill at their employment. All the way out from Texas he had  practiced doggedly with the lariat, and his best fell far short of what a  range-bred child could do.    Yet he had an audience waiting down at the corral. Drew's mouth was a  straight line. He would soon confirm their belief that _Don_ Cazar had in  truth hired Shiloh instead of his owner. But there was no use trying to  duck the ordeal, and the Kentuckian had never been one to put off the  inevitable with a pallid hope that something would turn up to save him.    Only this time, apparently, fortune was going to favor him.    \"Which one you wish, _senor?_\" Teodoro Trinfan, rope in hand, stood there  ready to cast for one of the milling colts. Why the boy was making that  offer of assistance Drew had no inkling. But to accept would give him a  slight chance to prove he could do part of the work.    He had already made his selection in the corral, though he had despaired  of ever getting that animal at rope's end.    \"The black--\"            6      He worked in the dust of the smaller corral, with Croaker's help, adapting  his knowledge of eastern gentling the way he had mentally planned it  during the days since he had accepted the job. With the excited and  frightened colt roped to the steady mule Drew tried to think horse, feel  horse, even be horse, shutting out all the rest of the world just as he  had on the day of the race. He must sense the colt's terror of the rope,  his horror of the strange human smell--the man odor which was so  frightening that a blanket hung up at a water hole could keep wild horses  away from the liquid they craved.    Drew talked as he had to Shiloh, as if this black could understand every  word. He twitched the lead rope, and Croaker paced sedately about in a  wide circle, dragging the colt with him. Drew then reached across the bony  back of the mule, pressed his hand up and down the sweaty, shivering hide  of the black. No hurry, must not rush the steady, mild gesture to the  horse that here was a friend.    The Kentuckian had no idea of the passing of time; it was all part of the  knowledge that slow movements, not swift ones, would prevent new panic.  The blanket was shown, allowing the black to sniff down its surface,  before it was flapped back and forth across the colt's back, and finally  left there. Now the saddle. And with that cinched into place, the black  stood quietly beside Croaker.    Drew mounted the mule and rode. The saddled black, loosened from the twin  tie, followed the mule twice around the corral. The rider dismounted from  Croaker, was up on the black. For perilous seconds he felt flesh and  muscles tense under his weight; then the body relaxed.    His hand went up. \"Open the gate!\" he called softly.    Seeming to realize he was free of the pole walls, the black exploded in a  burst of speed which was close to Shiloh's racing spurt. Drew let him go.  Three-quarters of an hour later he rode back, the black blowing foam, but  answering the rein.    He found _Don_ Cazar, Bartolome, and Hilario Trinfan waiting for him by  the corral. The mustanger walked forward with a lurch, his head thrown far  back so he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20846"],[0,"Handwork in Wood (#10)"],[1,"teeth have little or no set.    In sawing, the wood may be held either in the vise or on the  bench-hook. To help start the saw and at the same time to keep the  edges of the cut sharp, it is well to make a little groove with the  knife, on the waste side of the line to be followed, cutting the side  of the groove next to the line at right angles to the surface. The saw  drops directly into this groove, Fig. 91. In starting the saw cut, the  saw should be guided by holding the thumb of the left hand against the  side of the saw just above the teeth. Until the kerf is well started,  the saw should be held so that the teeth just touch the wood. It is  better not to attempt to start the saw level, i.e., with the teeth  resting clear across the wood, but the handle should be raised so that  the start is made only at the farther edge of the wood. Then as the  saw is gradually lowered, the kerf will extend quite across the wood.  Fig. 92. When the back-saw is used for ripping, the wood is held in  the vise, end up. Begin sawing as in crosscutting, that is, at the  farther corner with the handle end of the saw up, and gradually drop  the handle. Watch the lines on both the front and back sides, and if  necessary, reverse the piece to follow them.    [Illustration: Fig. 90. Using the Back-Saw with Bench-Hook.]    [Illustration: Fig. 91. Starting a Saw Cut in a Trough Cut With Knife.]    [Illustration: Fig. 92. Direction of the Back-Saw.]    [Illustration: Fig. 93. Dovetail-saw.]    [Illustration: Fig. 94. Compass-Saw.]    The _dovetail-saw_, Fig. 93, is a small back-saw for delicate work.    The _compass-saw_, Fig. 94, is narrow, pointed, thick, to prevent  buckling, and with a wide set to the teeth, to help in following the  curves. The teeth are a cross between the rip and crosscut teeth. It  is used in sawing curves.    The _turning-saw_, Fig. 95, is a narrow saw, set in a frame, which  stretches the saw tight, so that it works as a tension saw (cf. p. 62).  The best frames are made so that the handles which hold the blade  can revolve in the frame. The turning-saw is used chiefly for cutting  curves. A 14 inch blade, 3/16 of an inch wide is a good size for  ordinary use. The teeth are like those of a rip-saw, so that they are  quite likely to tear the wood in cutting across the grain. Allowance  should be made for this and the surplus removed with a spokeshave. The  turning-saw may be used to cut on either the pulling or the pushing  stroke, with the teeth pointed either toward or away from the worker.  The pulling cut is generally better, as it puts less strain on the  frame than the pushing cut. Both hands should grasp the frame as near  the end of the blade as possible, Fig. 95. Turns are made by revolving  the frame on the blade as an axis, which should always be kept at  right angles to the surface of the board. Care should be taken not to  twist the blade.    [Illustration: Fig. 95. Using a Turning Saw.]    [Illustration: Fig. 96. Saw-Vise.]    _To file and set a saw_, the saw is first fastened in the saw-vise,  Fig. 96, with the teeth up. It is then top-jointed by running a flat  file or a saw-jointer, Fig. 97, back and forth lengthwise along the  tops of the teeth to bring them to a level. After jointing the saw  should be set. For this purpose a saw-set, Fig. 98, is necessary.  Every alternate tooth is bent in the direction of its set by the  plunger in the instrument pushing against the anvil, which is an  adjustable eccentric disc. After the saw is set, it is filed. This  is done with a triangular file, Fig. 144, p. 90, which is held in  the right hand and its point in the thumb and fingers of the left.  Pressure is applied only on the forward stroke, which should be long  and even, the file being raised above the tooth on the return stroke.  The file should cut in the direction of the set, that is, the teeth  having the set away from the worker are filed first. Every alternate  tooth, 1st. 3d, 5th, etc., is filed, and then the saw is reversed and  the other set, the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc., is filed.    [Illustration: Fig. 97. A Saw-Jointer.]    [Illustration: Fig. 98. Saw-Set.]    In filing a rip-saw the file should move exactly perpendicularly to  the plane of the saw blade, that is, directly across the teeth. The  filing is done on the back of the teeth, the file just touching the  face of the next one. The filing is continued, with one, two, or three  strokes, for each tooth, as the case may require, or just until each  tooth is sharp.    In filing a crosscut-saw, the file is held pointing upward and toward  the point of the saw. The file should cut in the direction of the  set. The angle of the cutting edge is determined by the horizontal  inclination of the file to the blade; the angle of the point is  determined by the perpendicular inclination of the file to the blade.  Finally the sides of the teeth are rubbed lightly with a slipstone to  remove the wire edge. It should always be remembered that a saw is an  edge tool, and its edges are as liable to injury as any edges.      PLANES.    The _plane_ is a modified chisel. The chief difference in action  between a chisel and a plane in paring is this: the back of the chisel  lies close down on the surface of the wood that is cut, and acts as a  guide; whereas, in the plane, the cutter is elevated at an angle away  from the surface of the wood, and only its cutting edge touches the  wood, and it is held and guided mechanically by the plane mechanism.  In other words, a plane is a chisel firmly held in a device which  raises the cutter at an angle from the work, regulates the depth of  the cut, and favors the cutting rather than the splitting action.  An illustration of a chisel converted into a plane is the adjustable  _chisel-gage_, Fig. 99.    [Illustration: Fig. 99. Adjustable Chisel-Gage.]    [Illustration: Fig. 100. Wooden Bench-Plane.]    [Illustration: Fig. 101. Section of Jack Plane.]    The plane has developed as follows: it was first a chisel held in  a block of wood. This is all that oriental planes are now, simply a  sharpened wedge driven into a block of wood. When the hole works too  loose, the Japanese carpenter inserts a piece of paper to tighten it,  or he makes a new block. The first improvement was the addition of  a wooden wedge to hold in place the \"plane-iron\", as the cutter was  formerly called. In this form, the cutter or plane-iron, tho still  wedge-shaped, was reversed, being made heavier at the cutting edge in  order to facilitate fastening it in the wooden plane-stock by means of  the wooden wedge. Then a handle was added for convenience. Then came  the cap, the object of which is to break back the shaving and thus  weaken it as soon as possible after it is cut. Until a few years ago,  this was all that there was in a plane, and such planes are still  common, Fig. 100. Finally there appeared the iron plane, Fig. 101,  with it various mechanical adjustments. The following are the parts of  the Bailey iron plane:[4]      1. Cutter, or bit, or blade, or _plane-iron_.    2. Cap, or _plane-iron cap_, or curling iron.    3. Cutter screw, or _plane-iron Screw_.    4. Clamp, or _lever cap_, or wedge.    5. Clamp screw, or _cap screw_.    6. _Frog_.    7. _Y Adjustment_.    8. Brass set screw, or _brass adjusting nut_.    9. Lever (for _lateral adjustment_).    10. _Frog screw_.    11. _Handle_.    12. _Knob_.    13. _Handle bolt and nut_.    14. Knob screw, or _Knob bolt and nut_.    15. _Handle screw_.    16. _Bottom_, or sole.    17. Toe.    18. Heel.    19. Throat.    20. Thumb piece, or clamp lever, or cam.        [Footnote 4: The numbers and names in italics are those given in      Stanley's Catalog, No. 34. Some of these names, as \"plane-iron,\"      are survivals from the days of the wooden plane and are obviously      unsuitable now.]    There are various principles involved in the action of the plane. The  effect of the flat sole is to regulate the cut of the cutter. If the  surface be uneven, the cutter will not cut at all, or but little, in  passing over low places, since the toe and heel of the sole will then  be resting on higher places; but when the cutter reaches a high place  a shaving will be taken off. Hence it follows that the longer the  plane, the straighter will be the surface produced. The length of the  plane used is determined by the length of the wood to be planed, and  the degree of straightness desired.    The part of the sole directly in front of the cutter presses firmly  down on the wood and so prevents the shaving from splitting far in  advance of the edge. It follows that the narrowness of the mouth in  a plane is an important factor in the production of smooth surfaces.  This can be regulated by adjusting the toe in the block-plane, and by  moving the frog in the jack- and smooth-planes.    A recent improvement in jack-, smooth-, and fore-planes consists of  an adjustable frog, by means of which the throat can be narrowed  or widened at will by means of a set-screw in the rear of the frog  without removing the clamp and cutter. It is made by Sargent  and Company. The Stanley \"Bed Rock\" plane has a similar but less  convenient device.    [Illustration: Fig. 102. Sighting Along the Sole of Jack-Plane.]    The splitting of the wood in advance of the edge is also prevented by  the breaking of the shaving as it hits against the cutter or its cap.  Hence the advantage of bending up and breaking or partly breaking the  shaving as soon as possible after it is cut. This shows why the cap is  set close to the edge of the cutter. Another reason is that it thereby  stiffens the cutter and prevents \"chattering.\" If a thick shaving be  desired the cap has to be set farther back. In a smooth-plane 1/32  inch is enough, in a jack-plane 1/8 inch is often desirable. The  following are the planes in common use:    The _jack-plane_, Fig. 102, 14\" to 15\" long, is the one used where a  considerable amount of material"]]]
