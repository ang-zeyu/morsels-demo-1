He concludes thus:--\"When color, quality of  fleece, or outward form is wanted, the male may be most depended on  for these; but when milk is the object, when disposition, hardiness,  and freedom from diseases of the viscera, and, in short, all internal  qualities that may be desired, then the female may be most relied on.\"    One of the most valuable of these papers was written by the Rev. Henry  Berry of Worcestershire, in which, after stating that the question  proposed is one full of difficulty and that the discovery of an  independent quality such as that alluded to, in either sex, would be  attended with beneficial results, he proceeds to show, that it is not  to sex, but to high blood, or in other words, to animals long and  successfully selected, and bred with a view to particular  qualifications, whether in the male or female parent, that the quality  is to be ascribed, which the Highland Society has been desirous to  assign correctly.    The origin of the prevalent opinion which assigns this power  principally to the male, he explains by giving the probable history of  the first efforts in improving stock. The greatest attention would  naturally be paid to the male, both on account of his more extended  services, and the more numerous produce of which he could become the  parent; in consequence of which sires would be well-bred before dams.  \"The ideas entertained respecting the useful qualities of an animal  would be very similar and lead to the adoption of a general standard  of excellence, towards which it would be required that each male  should approximate; and thus there would exist among what may be  termed fashionable sires, a corresponding form and character different  from, and superior to, those of the general stock of the country. This  form and character would in most instances have been acquired by  _perseverance in breeding from animals which possessed the important  or fancied requisites_, and might therefore be said to be almost  _confirmed_ in such individuals. Under these circumstances, striking  results would doubtless follow the introduction of these sires to a  common stock; results which would lead superficial observers to  remark, that individual sires possessed properties as _males_, which  in fact were only assignable to them as _improved_ animals.\"    The opinion entertained by some, that the female possesses the power  generally ascribed to the male, he explains also by a reference to the  history of breeding: \"It is well known to persons conversant with the  subject of improved breeding, that of late years numerous sales have  taken place of the entire stocks of celebrated breeders of sires, and  thus, the females, valuable for such a purpose, have passed into a  great number of hands. Such persons have sometimes introduced a cow so  acquired to a bull inferior in point of descent and general good  qualities, and the offspring is known, in many instances, to have  proved superior to the sire by virtue of the dam's excellence, and to  have caused a suspicion in the minds of persons not habituated to  compare causes with effects, that certain females also possess the  property in question.\"    The writer gives various instances illustrative of his views, in some  of which the male only, and in others the female only, was the  high-bred animal, in all of which the progeny bore a remarkable  resemblance to the well-bred parent. He says, that where both parents  are equally well bred, and of nearly equal individual excellence, it  is not probable that their progeny will give general proof of a  preponderating power in either parent to impress peculiar  characteristics upon the offspring;--yet in view of all the  information we have upon the subject, he recommends a resort to the  best males as the most simple and efficacious mode of improving such  stocks as require improvement, and the only proceeding by which stock  already good can be preserved in excellence.    Mon. Giron[17] expresses the opinion that the relative age and vigor  of the parents exercises very considerable influence, and states as  the results of his observation, that the offspring of an old male and  a young female resembles the father less than the mother in  proportion as the mother is more vigorous and the father more  decrepit, and that the reverse occurs with the offspring of an old  female and a young male.    Among the more recent theories or hypotheses which have been started  regarding the relative influence of the male and female parents, those  of Mr. Orton, presented in a paper read before the Farmers' Club at  Newcastle upon Tyne, on the Physiology of Breeding, and of Mr. Walker  in his work on Intermarriage, as they both arrived to a certain  extent, at substantially the same conclusions by independent  observations of their own and as these seem to agree most nearly with  the majority of observed facts, are deemed worthy of favorable  mention.    The conclusions of Mr. Orton, briefly stated,[18] are, that in the  progeny there is no casual or haphazard blending of the parts or  qualities of the two parents, but rather that organization is  transmitted by halves, or that each parent contributes to the  formation of certain structures, and to the development of certain  qualities. Advancing a step further, he maintains, that the male  parent chiefly determines the external characters, the general  appearance, in fact, the outward structure and locomotive powers of  the offspring, as the framework, or bones and muscles, more  particularly those of the limbs, the organs of sense and skin; while  the female parent chiefly determines the internal structures and the  general quality, mainly furnishing the vital organs, i.e., the heart,  lungs, glands and digestive organs, and giving tone and character to  the vital functions of secretion, nutrition and growth. \"Not however  that the male is without influence on the internal organs and vital  functions, or the female without influence on the external organs and  locomotive powers of their offspring. The law holds only within  certain restrictions, and these form as it were a secondary law, one  of limitations, and scarcely less important to be understood than the  fundamental law itself.\"    Mr. Orton relies chiefly on the evidence presented by _hybrids_, the  progeny of distinct species, or by crosses between the most distinct  varieties embraced within a single species, to establish his law. The  examples adduced are chiefly from the former. The _mule_ is the  progeny of the male ass and the mare; the _hinny_ that of the horse  and the she ass. Both hybrids are the produce of the same set of  animals. They differ widely, however, in their respective  characters--the mule in all that relates to its external characters  having the distinctive features of the ass,--the hinny, in the same  respects having all the distinctive features of the horse; while in  all that relates to the internal organs and vital qualities, the mule  partakes of the character of the horse, and the hinny of those of the  ass. Mr. Orton says--\"The mule, the produce of the male ass and mare,  is essentially a _modified ass_: the ears are those of an ass somewhat  shortened; the mane is that of the ass, erect; the tail is that of an  ass; the skin and color are those of an ass somewhat modified; the  legs are slender and the hoofs high, narrow and contracted, like those  of an ass. In fact, in all these respects it is an ass somewhat  modified. The body and barrel, however, of the mule are round and  full, in which it differs from the ass and resembles the mare.    The hinny, on the other hand, the produce of the stallion and she ass,  is essentially a _modified horse_. The ears are those of a horse  somewhat lengthened; the mane flowing; the tail bushy, like that of  the horse; the skin is finer, like that of the horse, and the color  varies also, like the horse; the legs are stronger and the hoofs broad  and expanded like those of the horse. In fact, in all these respects  it is a horse somewhat modified. The body and barrel, however, of the  hinny are flat and narrow, in which it differs from the horse and  resembles the she ass.    A very curious circumstance pertains to the voice of the mule and the  hinny. The mule _brays_, the hinny _neighs_. The why and wherefore of  this is a perfect mystery until we come to apply the knowledge  afforded us by the law before given. The male gives the locomotive  organs, and the muscles are amongst these; the muscles are the organs  which modulate the voice of the animal; the mule has the muscular  structure of its sire, and brays; the hinny has the muscular structure  of its sire, and neighs.\"    In connexion with these examples Mr. Orton refers to a special feature  seen equally in the two instances, and which seems at first sight, a  departure from the principle laid down by him. It is this, both  hybrids, the mule and the hinny take after the male parents in all  their external characters save one, which is _size_. In this respect  they both follow the female parents, the mule being in all respects a  larger and finer animal than its sire, the ass; the hinny being in all  respects a smaller and inferior animal to its sire, the horse, the  body and barrel of the mule being large and round, those of the hinny  being flat and narrow; both animals being in these particulars the  reverse of their respective sires, but both resembling their female  parents.    In explanation of this seeming exception is adduced a well known  principle in physiology, which is, that the whole bony framework is  moulded in adaptation to the softer structures
