Deiecit voltum et demissa voce locuta est:    'O felix una ante alias Priameia virgo,    hostilem ad tumulum Troiae sub moenibus altis    iussa mori, quae sortitus non pertulit ullos,    nec victoris eri tetigit captiva cubile!    nos, patria incensa, diversa per aequora vectae,    stirpis Achilleae fastus iuvenemque superbum,    servitio enixae, tulimus:  qui deinde, secutus    Ledaeam Hermionen Lacedaemoniosque hymenaeos,    me famulo famulamque Heleno transmisit habendam.    Ast illum, ereptae magno inflammatus amore    coniugis et scelerum Furiis agitatus, Orestes    excipit incautum patriasque obtruncat ad aras.    Morte Neoptolemi regnorum reddita cessit    pars Heleno, qui Chaonios cognomine campos    Chaoniamque omnem Troiano a Chaone dixit,    Pergamaque Iliacamque iugis hanc addidit arcem.    Sed tibi qui cursum venti, quae fata dedere?    Aut quisnam ignarum nostris deus adpulit oris?    Quid puer Ascanius?  superatne et vescitur aura,    quem tibi iam Troia---    Ecqua tamen puero est amissae cura parentis?    Ecquid in antiquam virtutem animosque virilis    et pater Aeneas et avunculus excitat Hector?'      Talia fundebat lacrimans longosque ciebat    incassum fletus, cum sese a moenibus heros    Priamides multis Helenus comitantibus adfert,    adgnoscitque suos, laetusque ad limina ducit,    et multum lacrimas verba inter singula fundit.

We arrived very wet at Lamballe, a town most picturesquely situated on the  declivity of a granite cliff, surmounted by a handsome church, rising from  the very edge of the rocks. It formed part of the territory of the Duke of  Penthievre, whose heiress, Jeanne la Boiteuse, married Charles of Blois,  the competitor with John de Montfort(7) for the dukedom of Brittany. More  tenacious of her rights than her husband, Jeanne would never listen to any  compromise. After the treaty of Bretigny, the kings of England and France  proposed a division of the duchy between the two rivals; but, intimidated  by his wife, Charles dared not consent; and again, before the battle of  Auray, when a division was agreed upon, subject to the acceptance of the  Countess, Jeanne exclaimed, \"My husband makes too cheap a bargain of what  is not his own.\" And she wrote to Charles, \"Do what you please. I am a  woman, and cannot do more; but I had rather lose my life, or two if I had  them, before I would consent to so reproachable an act, to the shame of my  family\" (_des miens_). Later she said to him, \"Preserve me your heart, but  preserve me also my duchy, and, happen what may, act so that the  sovereignty remains to me entire.\" Her pride and obstinacy cost her  husband his life. The name of Lamballe is associated with the memory of  the unfortunate Princesse de Savoie de Carignan, the sad victim of  revolutionary fury. On the death of her husband, the Prince de Lamballe,  the vast estates of the Penthievre family passed to his sister, the wife  of Philippe Egalite, and from her descended to Louis Philippe, King of the  French.    [Illustration: 17. Section of Lanleff Church.]    Next day we made an excursion to the famed Temple of Lanleff, in Breton,  the \"land of tears,\" situated in a retired valley about six miles from the  sea. According to the tradition of the country, it was built by \"Les  moines rouges,\" as they style the Templar Knights. The road was  incessantly up and down hill, as we afterwards found they are throughout  Brittany; a \"pays accidente\" it may be truly called. The chapel of Lanleff  is composed of two concentric circular enclosures separated by twelve  round arches, with cushion-shaped capitals, having heads, human and  animal, rudely sculptured upon them at the four angles. Its whole diameter  is about twenty-two feet. It was probably built by some Templar Knight in  the beginning of the twelfth century on his return from the Holy Land. The  number of arches may allude to that of the twelve Apostles.    [Illustration: 18. Plan of Lanleff Church.]    The parish church was built into the east side of the temple, the only  part which has preserved its roof, and which served as a vestibule to the  more modern building. A gigantic yew formerly grew in the central  enclosure, and overshadowed it with its spreading branches; but the parish  church has been taken down and rebuilt in another part of the village, and  the yew-tree has disappeared.    Close to the temple is a spring enclosed by flagstones. When moistened,  they appear covered with blood-stained spots. According to the tradition,  in olden times an unnatural father sold his child to the Evil One. The  gold received for the bargain was counted out upon the side of the spring,  and the accursed money left its print upon the stones. A bare-legged  peasant who stood by with her pitcher, threw some water over the stones,  and immediately there appeared round red spots of different  sizes--indelible marks of the diabolical bargain. We went into a cottage  close by, and had some boiled eggs and cider. The inmates were at their  meal--a bowl of milk, into which they broke their buckwheat \"galette.\" We  were much struck with the jealous pertinacity of the Breton, to show he  considers himself as of a different people and country to the rest of  France, a feeling which more than three hundred years has not dissipated.  Our driver would talk of Bretons and French as of distinct nations, and  the Normans in this part of Brittany are the special objects of hatred,  originating, perhaps, in the former subjection of Brittany to Normandy.  When Charles the Simple ceded to the fierce Northmen the province now  known by their name, their sovereignty extended over Brittany, and the  dukes of Normandy did homage for both provinces to the King of France. The  Bretons struggled hard against the supremacy of the Barbarians, but  eventually had to acknowledge the Duke of Normandy as their sovereign  lord.    St. Brieuc, principal town of the department of the Cotes-du-Nord, has  been described as an old town with a new face. Though one of the oldest in  Brittany, it has little of antiquity to detain the traveller. The Palais  de Justice is a handsome building, in the midst of a pretty garden,  commanding a view of the Tour de Cesson, lower down the river (the Gouet),  a large circular tower built by Duke John IV., and blown up by Henry IV.,  at the desire of the Briochins, as the inhabitants of St. Brieuc style  themselves. The mine split it in two, and the part that remains serves as  a landmark for the pilots between St. Brieuc and its port, about two miles  distant, called Legue. Notre Dame d'Esperance is a pretty church, rebuilt  about ten years since, with a calvary in front, and a series of painted  windows representing the principal saints of Brittany, and the most  celebrated pilgrimages of the Virgin in that province. At St. Brieuc,  1689, James II. of England reviewed his little army, and was received with  royal honours by the bishop of the place.    We proceeded by the railway to Guingamp, next to St. Brieuc, the principal  town of the department, capital of the duchy of Penthievre. It is situated  in the richly wooded and cultivated valley of the Trieux, a favourite  fishing river of considerable size, and affording trout, salmon, and dace,  from Guingamp to Paimpol, where it falls into the sea, a distance of  twenty miles. It runs through the centre of the town, and is here a  considerable stream.    Attached to the Cathedral is the venerated sanctuary of Notre  Dame-du-Bon-Secours, one of the most celebrated places of pilgrimage in  Brittany. The pardon takes place the Saturday before the first Sunday in  July, and owes its origin to the brotherhood called the \"Frerie blanche,\"  an association of which Duke Peter accepted the title of lay-abbot. The  motto embroidered on their banner was (in Breton) \"A triple cord is not  easily broken.\" The triple cord being emblematic of the three  estates--clergy, nobles, and laity--in whose unity consisted the strength of  Brittany. The Frerie blanche no longer exists, the triple cable is broken,  the pilgrimage alone remains.    [Illustration: 19. Fountain of Duke Peter.]    La Pompe, or the fountain of Duke Peter, as it is called, is of later  dater date, being in the style of the Renaissance. It consists of three  circular basins in tiers. On the lower are sea-horses, which, with their  wings, support the second basin, and Naiads uphold the third. On the top  is a figure of the Virgin with her arms extended.    The women of Guingamp wear high muslin caps, dark petticoats, and black  stockings. Knitting-pins in hand, they work away at their stockings  whether walking, talking, or with a load of butter on their heads, as they  do throughout all Brittany. When not at work, their knitting-pins are  stuck in their hair. Knitting and spinning are the occupation of their  lives. When the Breton's idol, Du Guesclin, was a prisoner to the Black  Prince, and was asked how he could raise the large sum named for his  ransom, Du Guesclin replied, that \"the women of Brittany would rather spin  for a year and ransom him with their distaffs, than that he should remain  prisoner.\"          \"Quand vous etiez captif, Bertrand, fils de Bretagne,      Tous les fuseaux tournaient aussi dans la campagne;      Chaque femme apporte son echeveau de lin;      Ce fut votre rancon, messire Du Guesclin!\"                      _Les Bretons_, A. BRIZEUX.      Guingamp was given by Duke John V. to his son Peter, who resided here and  rebuilt the castle. When attacked by his mortal illness, the physicians  attributed his malady to witchcraft, and declared it could only be  remedied by counter-spells. The Prince refused to have recourse to such  means, saying, \"I had rather die by the will of God, than live by the will  of the Devil.\"--\"J'aime mieux mourir de par Dieu, que de vivre de par le  Diable.\"    We walked to the small chapel of St. Leonard, picturesquely situated on a  little eminence. It was built by Charles of Blois, on his return from his  captivity in England, and dedicated by him to St. Leonard, the  patron-saint of prisoners--a contemporary of Clovis, from whom he obtained  permission to set free all the captives he should find in the prisons. In  the month of May, people who are attacked with fever repair to St. Leonard  to seek, upon the walls of the chapel or on the calvary attached to it,  snails as cures for their malady. They must gather them themselves, pound  them, and put them into little bags, which they wear round their necks. As  soon as the fever leaves them they bury their bags at the foot of the  walls of the chapel, and, if they fail to perform this ceremony, the fever  will return. We found quantities of these bags, made of coarse linen,  lying half-buried under the walls of the chapel. There is a pardon here  every year, on which occasion only the chapel is opened.    We took a carriage to Paimpol. On our way we stopped at the Chateau de  Boisgelin, belonging to the Marquis of the same name, but could not obtain  admittance. On to the Abbey of Beauport (Sancta Maria de Bello Porto),  founded in the thirteenth century, beautifully situated on a tongue of  land at the entrance of the Bay of Paimpol, opposite the island of"]]]
