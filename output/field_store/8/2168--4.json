The Lord Justice, on hearing this, asked the prisoner if he had any  suspicions that his brother had a design on his life.    He answered that all along, from the time of their first unfortunate  meeting, his brother had dogged his steps so constantly, and so  unaccountably, that he was convinced it was with some intent out of the  ordinary course of events; and that if, as his lordship supposed, it  was indeed his shadow that he had seen approaching him through the  mist, then, from the cowering and cautious manner that it advanced,  there was no little doubt that his brother's design had been to push  him headlong from the cliff that morning.    A conversation then took place between the judge and the Lord Advocate;  and, in the meantime, a bustle was seen in the hall; on which the doors  were ordered to be guarded, and, behold, the precious Mr. R. Wringhim  was taken into custody, trying to make his escape out of court. Finally  it turned out that George was honourably acquitted, and young Wringhim  bound over to keep the peace, with heavy penalties and securities.    That was a day of high exultation to George and his youthful  associates, all of whom abhorred Wringhim; and, the evening being spent  in great glee, it was agreed between Mr. Adam Gordon and George that  their visit to the Highlands, though thus long delayed, was not to be  abandoned; and though they had, through the machinations of an  incendiary, lost the season of delight, they would still find plenty of  sport in deer-shooting. Accordingly, the day was set a second time for  their departure; and, on the day preceding that, all the party were  invited by George to dine with him once more at the sign of the Black  Bull of Norway. Everyone promised to attend, anticipating nothing but  festivity and joy. Alas, what short-sighted improvident creatures we  are, all of us; and how often does the evening cup of joy lead to  sorrow in the morning!    The day arrived--the party of young noblemen and gentlemen met, and  were as happy and jovial as men could be. George was never seen so  brilliant, or so full of spirits; and exulting to see so many gallant  young chiefs and gentlemen about him, who all gloried in the same  principles of loyalty (perhaps this word should have been written  disloyalty), he made speeches, gave toasts, and sung songs, all leaning  slyly to the same side, until a very late hour. By that time he had  pushed the bottle so long and so freely that its fumes had taken  possession of every brain to such a degree that they held Dame Reason  rather at the staff's end, overbearing all her counsels and  expostulations; and it was imprudently proposed by a wild inebriated  spark, and carried by a majority of voices, that the whole party should  adjourn to a bagnio for the remainder of the night.    They did so; and it appears from what follows that the house, to which  they retired must have been somewhere on the opposite side of the  street to the Black Bull Inn, a little farther to the eastward. They  had not been an hour in that house till some altercation chanced to  arise between George Colwan and a Mr. Drummond, the younger son of a  nobleman of distinction. It was perfectly casual, and no one  thenceforward, to this day, could ever tell what it was about, if it  was not about the misunderstanding of some word or term that the one  had uttered. However it was, some high words passed between them; these  were followed by threats, and, in less than two minutes from the  commencement of the quarrel, Drummond left the house in apparent  displeasure, hinting to the other that they two should settle that in a  more convenient place.    The company looked at one another, for all was over before any of them  knew such a thing was begun. \"What the devil is the matter?\" cried one.  \"What ails Drummond?\" cried another. \"Who has he quarrelled with?\"  asked a third.    \"Don't know.\"--\"Can't tell, on my life.\"--\"He has quarrelled with his  wine, I suppose, and is going to send it a challenge.\"    Such were the questions, and such the answers that passed in the jovial  party, and the matter was no more thought of.    But in the course of a very short space, about the length which the  ideas of the company were the next day at great variance, a sharp rap  came to the door. It was opened by a female; but, there being a chain  inside, she only saw one side of the person at the door. He appeared to  be a young gentleman, in appearance like him who had lately left the  house, and asked, in a low whispering voice, \"if young Dalcastle was  still in the house?\" The woman did not know. \"If he is,\" added he,  \"pray tell him to speak with me for a few minutes.\" The woman delivered  the message before all the party, among whom there were then sundry  courteous ladies of notable distinction, and George, on receiving it,  instantly rose from the side of one of them, and said, in the hearing  of them all, \"I will bet a hundred merks that is Drummond.\"--\"Don't go  to quarrel with him, George,\" said one.--\"Bring him in with you,\" said  another. George stepped out; the door was again bolted, the chain drawn  across, and the inadvertent party, left within, thought no more of the  circumstance till the morning, that the report had spread over the city  that a young gentleman had been slain, on a little washing-green at the  side of the North Loch, and at the very bottom of the close where this  thoughtless party had been assembled.    Several of them, on first hearing the report, basted to the dead-room  in the Guard-house, where the corpse had been deposited, and soon  discovered the body to be that of their friend and late entertainer,  George Colwan. Great were the consternation and grief of all concerned,  and, in particular, of his old father and Miss Logan; for George had  always been the sole hope and darling of both, and the news of the  event paralysed them so as to render them incapable of all thought or  exertion. The spirit of the old laird was broken by the blow, and he  descended at once from a jolly, good-natured and active man to a mere  driveller, weeping over the body of his son, kissing his wound, his  lips, and his cold brow alternately; denouncing vengeance on his  murderers, and lamenting that he himself had not met the cruel doom, so  that the hope of his race might have been preserved. In short, finding  that all further motive of action and object of concern or of love,  here below, were for ever removed from him, he abandoned himself to  despair, and threatened to go down to the grave with his son.    But, although he made no attempt to discover the murderers, the arm of  justice was not idle; and, it being evident to all that the crime must  infallibly be brought home to young Drummond, some of his friends  sought him out, and compelled him, sorely against his will, to retire  into concealment till the issue of the proof that should be led was  made known. At the same time, he denied all knowledge of the incident  with a resolution that astonished his intimate friends and relations,  who to a man suspected him guilty. His father was not in Scotland, for  I think it was said to me that this young man was second son to a John,  Duke of Melfort, who lived abroad with the royal family of the Stuarts;  but this young gentleman lived with the relations of his mother, one of  whom, an uncle, was a Lord of Session: these, having thoroughly  effected his concealment, went away, and listened to the evidence; and  the examination of every new witness convinced them that their noble  young relative was the slayer of his friend.    All the young gentlemen of the party were examined, save Drummond, who,  when sent for, could not be found, which circumstance sorely confirmed  the suspicions against him in the minds of judges and jurors, friends  and enemies; and there is little doubt that the care of his relations  in concealing him injured his character and his cause. The young  gentlemen of whom the party was composed varied considerably with  respect to the quarrel between him and the deceased. Some of them had  neither heard nor noted it; others had, but not one of them could tell  how it began. Some of them had heard the threat uttered by Drummond on  leaving the house, and one only had noted him lay his hand on his  sword. Not one of them could swear that it was Drummond who came to the  door and desired to speak with the deceased, but the general impression  on the minds of them all was to that effect; and one of the women swore  that she heard the voice distinctly at the door, and every word that  voice pronounced, and at the same time heard the deceased say that it  was Drummond's.    On the other hand, there were some evidences on Drummond's part, which  Lord Craigie, his uncle, had taken care to collect. He produced the  sword which his nephew had worn that night, on which there was neither  blood nor blemish; and, above all, he insisted on the evidence of a  number of surgeons, who declared that both the wounds which the  deceased had received had been given behind. One of these was below the  left arm, and a slight one; the other was quite through the body, and  both evidently inflicted with the same weapon, a two-edged sword, of  the same dimensions as that worn by Drummond.    Upon the whole, there was a division in the court, but a majority  decided it. Drummond was pronounced guilty of the murder; outlawed for  not appearing, and a high reward offered for his apprehension. It was  with the greatest difficulty that he escaped on board of a small  trading vessel, which landed him in Holland, and from thence, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22766"],[0,"Electricity for Boys (#10)"],[1," the corresponding annunciator.    [Illustration: _Fig. 60._ _Annunciators_]    [Illustration: _Fig. 61._ WIRING SYSTEM FOR A HOUSE]    WIRING UP A HOUSE.--The system of wiring up a house so that all doors  and windows will be connected to form a burglar alarm outfit, is shown  in Fig. 61. It will be understood that, in practice, the bell is mounted  on or at the annunciator, and that, for convenience, the annunciator  box has also a receptacle for the battery. The circuiting is shown  diagramatically, as it is called, so as fully to explain how the lines  are run. Two windows and a door are connected up with an annunciator  having three drops, or numbers 1, 2, 3. The circuit runs from one pole  of the battery to the bell and then to one post of the annunciator. From  the other post a wire runs to one terminal of the switch at the door or  window. The other switch terminal has a wire running to the other pole  of the battery.    A, B, C represent the circuit wires from the terminals of the window and  door switches, to the annunciators.    It is entirely immaterial which side of the battery is connected up with  the bell.    From the foregoing it will readily be understood how to connect up any  ordinary apparatus, remembering that in all cases the magnet must be  brought into the electric circuit.          CHAPTER VIII    ACCUMULATORS. STORAGE OR SECONDARY BATTERIES      STORING UP ELECTRICITY.--In the foregoing chapters we have seen that,  originally, electricity was confined in a bottle, called the Leyden jar,  from which it was wholly discharged at a single impulse, as soon as it  was connected up by external means. Later the primary battery and the  dynamo were invented to generate a constant current, and after these  came the second form of storing electricity, called the storage or  secondary battery, and later still recognized as accumulators.    THE ACCUMULATOR.--The term _accumulator_ is, strictly speaking, the more  nearly correct, as electricity is, in reality, \"_stored_\" in an  accumulator. But when an accumulator is charged by a current of  electricity, a chemical change is gradually produced in the active  element of which the accumulator is made. This change or decomposition  continues so long as the charging current is on. When the accumulator is  disconnected from the charging battery or dynamo, and its terminals are  connected up with a lighting system, or with a motor, for instance, a  reverse process is set up, or the particles re-form themselves into  their original compositions, which causes a current to flow in a  direction opposite to that of the charging current.    It is immaterial to the purposes of this chapter, as to the charging  source, whether it be by batteries or dynamos; the same principles will  apply in either case.    [Illustration: _Fig. 62._ ACCUMULATOR GRIDS]    ACCUMULATOR PLATES.--The elements used for accumulator plates are red  lead for the positive plates, and precipitated lead, or the well-known  litharge, for the negative plates. Experience has shown that the best  way to hold this material is by means of lead grids.    Fig. 62 shows the typical form of one of these grids. It is made of  lead, cast or molded in one piece, usually square, as at A, with a wing  or projection (B), at one margin, extending upwardly and provided with a  hole (C). The grid is about a quarter of an inch thick.    THE GRID.--The open space, called the grid, proper, comprises cross  bars, integral with the plate, made in a variety of shapes. Fig. 62  shows three forms of constructing these bars or ribs, the object being  to provide a form which will hold in the lead paste, which is pressed in  so as to make a solid-looking plate when completed.    THE POSITIVE PLATE.--The positive plate is made in the following manner:  Make a stiff paste of red lead and sulphuric acid; using a solution,  say, of one part of acid to two parts of water. The grid is laid on a  flat surface and the paste forced into the perforations with a stiff  knife or spatula. Turn over the grid so as to get the paste in evenly on  both sides.    The grid is then stood on its edge, from 18 to 20 hours, to dry, and  afterwards immersed in a concentrated solution of chloride of lime, so  as to convert it into lead peroxide. When the action is complete it is  thoroughly rinsed in cold water, and is ready to use.    THE NEGATIVE PLATE.--The negative plate is filled, in like manner, with  precipitated lead. This lead is made by putting a strip of zinc into a  standard solution of acetate of lead, and crystals will then form on the  zinc. These will be very thin, and will adhere together, firmly, forming  a porous mass. This, when saturated and kept under water for a short  time, may be put into the openings of the negative plate.    [Illustration: _Fig. 63._ ASSEMBLAGE OF ACCUMULATOR PLATES]    CONNECTING UP THE PLATES.--The next step is to put these plates in  position to form a battery. In Fig. 63 is shown a collection of plates  connected together.    For simplicity in illustrating, the cell is made up of glass, porcelain,  or hard rubber, with five plates (A), A, A representing the negative and  B, B the positive plates. A base of grooved strips (C, C) is placed in  the batteries of the cell to receive the lower ends of the plates. The  positive plates are held apart by means of a short section of tubing  (D), which is clamped and held within the plates by a bolt (E), this  bolt also being designed to hold the terminal strip (F).    In like manner, the negative plates are held apart by the two tubular  sections (G), each of which is of the same length as the section D of  the positives. The bolt (H) holds the negatives together as well as the  terminal (I). The terminals should be lead strips, and it would be well,  owing to the acid fumes which are formed, to coat all brass work,  screws, etc., with paraffine wax.    The electrolyte or acid used in the cell, for working purposes, is a  pure sulphuric acid, which should be diluted with about four times its  weight in water. Remember, you should always add the strong acid to the  water, and never pour the water into the acid, as the latter method  causes a dangerous ebullition, and does not produce a good mixture.    Put enough of this solution into the cell to cover the tops of the  plates, and the cell is ready.    [Illustration: _Fig. 64._ CONNECTING UP STORAGE BATTERY IN SERIES]    CHARGING THE CELLS.--The charge of the current must never be less than  2.5 volts. Each cell has an output, in voltage, of about 2 volts, hence  if we have, say, 10 cells, we must have at least 25 volts charging  capacity. We may arrange these in one line, or in series, as it is  called, so far as the connections are concerned, and charge them with a  dynamo, or other electrical source, which shows a pressure of 25 volts,  as illustrated in Fig. 64, or, instead of this, we may put them into two  parallel sets of 5 cells each, as shown in Fig. 65, and use 12.5 volts  to charge with. In this case it will take double the time because we are  charging with only one-half the voltage used in the first case.    The positive pole of the dynamo should be connected with the positive  pole of the accumulator cell, and negative with negative. When this has  been done run up the machine until it slightly exceeds the voltage of  the cells. Thus, if we have 50 cells in parallel, like in Fig. 64, at  least 125 volts will be required, and the excess necessary should bring  up the voltage in the dynamo to 135 or 140 volts.    [Illustration: _Fig. 65._ PARALLEL SERIES]    [Illustration: _Fig. 66._ CHARGING CIRCUIT]    THE INITIAL CHARGE.--It is usual initially to charge the battery from  periods ranging from 36 to 40 hours, and to let it stand for 12 or 15  hours, after which to re-charge, until the positive plates have turned  to a chocolate color, and the negative plates to a slate or gray color,  and both plates give off large bubbles of gas.    In charging, the temperature of the electrolyte should not exceed 100 deg.  Fahrenheit.    When using the accumulators they should never be fully discharged.    THE CHARGING CIRCUIT.--The diagram (Fig. 66) shows how a charging  circuit is formed. The lamps are connected up in parallel, as  illustrated. Each 16-candle-power 105-volt lamp will carry 1/2 ampere,  so that, supposing we have a dynamo which gives 110 volts, and we want  to charge a 4-volt accumulator, there will be 5-volt surplus to go to  the accumulator. If, for instance, you want the cell to have a charge of  2 amperes, four of these lamps should be connected up in parallel. If 3  amperes are required, use 6 lamps, and so on.          CHAPTER IX    THE TELEGRAPH      The telegraph is a very simple instrument. The key is nothing more or  less than a switch which turns the current on and off alternately.    The signals sent over the wires are simply the audible sounds made by  the armature, as it moves to and from the magnets.    MECHANISM IN TELEGRAPH CIRCUITS.--A telegraph circuit requires three  pieces of mechanism at each station, namely, a key used by the sender, a  sounder for the receiver, and a battery.    THE SENDING KEY.--The base of the sending instrument is six inches long,  four inches wide, and three-quarters of an inch thick, made of wood, or  any suitable non-conducting material. The key (A) is a piece of brass  three-eighths by one-half inch in thickness and six inches long. Midway  between its ends is a cross hole, to receive the pivot pin (B), which  also passes through a pair of metal brackets (C, D), the bracket C  having a screw to hold one of the line wires, and the other bracket  having a metal switch (E) hinged thereto. This switch bar, like the  brackets, is made of brass, one-half inch wide by one-sixteenth of an  inch thick.    Below the forward end of the key (A) is a cross bar of brass (F),  screwed to the base by a screw at one end, to receive the other line  wire."]]]
