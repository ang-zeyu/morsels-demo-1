Their number was incredible, and their cities were full of riotous  activity.  What their occupations were the hunters could not ascertain,  but it was perfectly evident that they visited a great deal and gossiped  tremendously, for they ran about from house to house, and sat chatting  in groups; but it was also observed that they never went far from their  own houses.  Each seemed to have a circle of acquaintance in the  immediate neighbourhood of his own residence, to which in case of sudden  danger he always fled.    But another thing about these prairie-dogs (perhaps, considering their  size, we should call them prairie-doggies), another thing about them, we  say, was that each doggie lived with an owl, or, more correctly, an owl  lived with each doggie!  This is such an extraordinary _fact_, that we  could scarce hope that men would believe us, were our statement not  supported by dozens of trustworthy travellers who have visited and  written about these regions.  The whole plain was covered with these  owls.  Each hole seemed to be the residence of an owl and a doggie, and  these incongruous couples lived together apparently in perfect harmony.    We have not been able to ascertain from travellers _why_ the owls have  gone to live with these doggies, so we beg humbly to offer our own  private opinion to the reader.  We assume, then, that owls find it  absolutely needful to have holes.  Probably prairie-owls cannot dig  holes for themselves.  Having discovered, however, a race of little  creatures that could, they very likely determined to take forcible  possession of the holes made by them.  Finding, no doubt, that, when  they did so, the doggies were too timid to object, and discovering,  moreover, that they were sweet, innocent little creatures, the owls  resolved to take them into partnership, and so the thing was settled--  that's how it came about, no doubt of it!    There is a report that rattlesnakes live in these holes also; but we  cannot certify our reader of the truth of this,--still it is well to be  acquainted with a report that is current among the men of the backwoods.  If it be true, we are of opinion that the doggie's family is the most  miscellaneous and remarkable on the face of--or, as Henri said, in the  bo'-els--of the earth.    Dick and his friends were so deeply absorbed in watching these curious  little creatures that they did not observe the rapid spread of the black  clouds over the sky.  _A_ few heavy drops of rain now warned them to  seek shelter, so wheeling round they dashed off at speed for the clump  of willows, which they gained just as the rain began to descend in  torrents.    \"Now, lads, do it slick.  Off packs and saddles,\" cried Joe Blunt,  jumping from his horse.  \"I'll make a hut for ye, right off.\"    \"A hut, Joe! what sort o' hut can ye make here?\" inquired Dick.    \"Ye'll see, boy, in a minute.\"    \"Ach! lend me hand here, Dick; de bockle am tight as de hosse's own  skin.  Ah! dere all right.\"    \"Hallo! what's this?\" exclaimed Dick, as Crusoe advanced with something  in his mouth.  \"I declare, it's a bird of some sort.\"    \"A prairie-hen,\" remarked Joe, as Crusoe laid the bird at Dick's feet;  \"capital for supper.\"    \"Ah! dat chien is superb! goot dog.  Come here, I vill clap you.\"    But Crusoe refused to be caressed.  Meanwhile, Joe and Dick formed a  sort of beehive-looking hut by bending down the stems of a tall bush and  thrusting their points into the ground.  Over this they threw the  largest buffalo robe, and placed another on the ground below it, on  which they laid their packs of goods.  These they further secured  against wet by placing several robes over them and a skin of parchment.  Then they sat down on this pile to rest and consider what should be done  next.    \"'Tis a bad look out,\" said Joe, shaking his head.    \"I fear it is,\" replied Dick in a melancholy tone.    Henri said nothing, but he sighed deeply on looking up at the sky, which  was now of a uniform watery grey, while black clouds drove athwart it.  The rain was pouring in torrents, and the wind began to sweep it in  broad sheets over the plains, and under their slight covering, so that  in a short time they were wet to the skin.  The horses stood meekly  beside them, with their tails and heads equally pendulous, and Crusoe  sat before his master, looking at him with an expression that seemed to  say, \"Couldn't you put a stop to this if you were to try?\"    \"This'll never do.  I'll try to git up a fire,\" said Dick, jumping up in  desperation.    \"Ye may save yerself the trouble,\" remarked Joe, drily--at least as  drily as was possible in the circumstances.    However, Dick did try, but he failed signally.  Everything was soaked  and saturated.  There were no large trees; most of the bushes were  green, and the dead ones were soaked.  The coverings were slobbery; the  skins they sat on were slobbery; the earth itself was slobbery; so Dick  threw his blanket (which was also slobbery) round his shoulders, and sat  down beside his companions to grin and bear it.  As for Joe and Henri,  they were old hands, and accustomed to such circumstances.  From the  first they had resigned themselves to their fate, and wrapping their wet  blankets round them sat down, side by side, wisely to endure the evils  that they could not cure.    There is an old rhyme, by whom composed we know not--and it matters  little--which runs thus--      \"For every evil under the sun    There is a remedy--or there's none.    If there is--try and find it;    If there isn't--never mind it!\"    There is deep wisdom here in small compass.  The principle involved  deserves to be heartily recommended.  Dick never heard of the lines, but  he knew the principle well; so he began to \"never mind it,\" by sitting  down beside his companions and whistling vociferously.  As the wind  rendered this a difficult feat he took to singing instead.  After that  he said, \"Let's eat a bite, Joe, and then go to bed.\"    \"Be all means,\" said Joe, who produced a mass of dried deer's meat from  a wallet.    \"It's cold grub,\" said Dick, \"and tough.\"    But the hunters' teeth were sharp and strong, so they ate a hearty  supper and washed it down with a drink of rain water collected from a  pool on the top of their hut.  They now tried to sleep, for the night  was advancing, and it was so dark that they could scarce see their hands  when held up before their faces.  They sat back to back, and thus, in  the form of a tripod, began to snooze.  Joe's and Henri's seasoned  frames would have remained stiff as posts till morning; but Dick's body  was young and pliant, so he hadn't been asleep a few seconds when he  fell forward into the mud and effectually awakened the others.  Joe gave  a grunt, and Henri exclaimed, \"Hah!\" but Dick was too sleepy and  miserable to say anything.  Crusoe, however, rose up to show his  sympathy, and laid his wet head on his master's knee as he resumed his  place.  This catastrophe happened three times in the space of an hour,  and by the third time they were all wakened up so thoroughly that they  gave up the attempt to sleep, and amused each other by recounting their  hunting experiences and telling stories.  So engrossed did they become  that day broke sooner than they had expected--and just in proportion as  the grey light of dawn rose higher into the eastern sky did the spirits  of these weary men rise within their soaking bodies.

THE \"WALLERING\" PECULIARITIES OF BUFFALO BULLS--THE FIRST BUFFALO HUNT  AND ITS CONSEQUENCES--CRUSOE COMES TO THE RESCUE--PAWNEES DISCOVERED--A  MONSTER BUFFALO HUNT--JOE ACTS THE PART OF AMBASSADOR.    Fortunately the day that succeeded the dreary night described in the  last chapter was warm and magnificent.  The sun rose in a blaze of  splendour and filled the atmosphere with steam from the moist earth.    The unfortunates in the wet camp were not slow to avail themselves of  his cheering rays.  They hung up everything on the bushes to dry, and by  dint of extreme patience and cutting out the comparatively dry hearts of  several pieces of wood, they lighted a fire and boiled some rain water,  which was soon converted into soup.  This, and the exercise necessary  for the performance of these several duties, warmed and partially dried  them, so that when they once more mounted their steeds and rode away  they were in a state of comparative comfort and in excellent spirits.  The only annoyance was the clouds of mosquitoes and large flies that  assailed men and horses whenever they checked their speed.    \"I tell ye wot it is,\" said Joe Blunt, one fine morning about a week  after they had begun to cross the prairie, \"it's my 'pinion that we'll  come on buffaloes soon.  Them tracks are fresh, an' yonder's one o'  their wallers that's bin used not long agone.\"    \"I'll go have a look at it,\" cried Dick, trotting away as he spoke.    Everything in these vast prairies was new to Dick Varley, and he was  kept in a constant state of excitement during the first week or two of  his journey.  It is true he was quite familiar with the names and habits  of all the animals that dwelt there, for many a time and oft had he  listened to the \"yarns\" of the hunters and trappers of the Mustang  Valley, when they returned laden with rich furs from their periodical  hunting expeditions.  But this knowledge of his only served to whet his  curiosity and his desire to _see_ the denizens of the prairies with his  own eyes, and now that his wish was accomplished, it greatly increased  the pleasures of his journey.    Dick had just reached the \"wallow\" referred to by Joe Blunt, and had  reined up his steed to observe it leisurely, when a faint hissing sound  reached his ear.  Looking quickly back he observed his two companions  crouching on the necks of their horses, and slowly descending into a  hollow of the prairie in front of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21736"],[0,"The Gorilla Hunters (#10)"],[1,"follow that every one who wears  a black coat and white neck-cloth, and goes abroad, is a missionary.  But what can a few men scattered along the coast here and there, however  earnest they be, do among the thousands upon thousands of savages that  wander about in the interior of Africa?  No good will ever be done in  this land, to any great extent, until traders and missionaries go hand  in hand into the interior, and the system of trade is entirely  remodelled.\"    \"From what you remark,\" said I, feeling much interested, \"I should  suppose that you have given this subject a good deal of attention.\"    \"I have.  But there are people in this world who, supposing that because  I am a trader I am therefore prone to exalt trade to an equality with  religion, do not give me credit for disinterestedness when I speak.  Perhaps you are one of these.\"    \"Not I, in truth,\" said I, earnestly.  \"My chief desire in conversing  with mankind is to acquire knowledge; I therefore listen with attention  and respect to the opinions of others, instead of endeavouring to assert  my own.  In the present instance, being ignorant, I have no opinions to  assert.\"    \"I wish there were more people in your country,\" replied the trader,  \"who felt as you do.  I would tell them that, although a trader, I  regard the salvation of men's souls as the most important work in this  world.  I would argue that until you get men to listen, you cannot  preach the gospel to them; that the present system of trade in Africa is  in itself antagonistic to religion, being based upon dishonesty, and  that, therefore, the natives will not listen to missionaries--of course,  in some cases they will; for I believe that the gospel, when truly  preached, is never preached in vain--but they will throw every possible  impediment in their way.  I would tell them that in order to make the  path of the missionary practicable, the system of trade must be  inverted, the trader and the missionary must go hand in hand, and  commerce and religion--although incomparably different in their nature  and ends--must act the part of brother and sister if anything _great_ is  to be done for the poor natives of Africa.\"    Conversing thus we beguiled the time pleasantly while we proceeded  rapidly on our way, for the day was drawing to a close, and we were  still at a considerable distance from the native village.        CHAPTER FIVE.    PREPARATIONS FOR A GRAND HUNT.    All was bustle, noise, and activity in the village, or, more correctly  speaking, in the native town of his Majesty King Jambai, early in the  morning after our arrival.  A great elephant-hunt had been resolved on.  The hunters were brushing up their spears and old guns--all of which  latter were flint-locks that had been procured from traders, and were  not worth more than a few shillings.  The women were busy preparing  breakfast, and the children were playing around their huts.    These huts were of the simplest construction--made of bamboo, roofed  with large palm-leaves, and open in front.  The wants of savages are  generally few; their household furniture is very plain, and there is  little of it.  A large hut near to that of his sable majesty had been  set apart for the trader and his party during our residence at the town.  In this we had spent the night as pleasantly as we could, but the  mosquitoes kept up an unceasing warfare upon us, so that daylight was  welcomed gladly when it came.    On going to the hut of King Jambai, who had invited us to breakfast with  him, we found the Princess Oninga alone, seated in the king's armchair  and smoking her pipe with uncommon gusto.  She had spent the early part  of the morning in preparing breakfast for her father and ourselves, and  was now resting from her labours.    \"You are early astir, Princess Oninga,\" said the trader as we entered  and took our seats round the fire, for at that hour the air felt chilly.    The princess took her pipe from her lips and admitted that she was,  blowing a long thin cloud of smoke into the air with a sigh of  satisfaction.    \"We are ready for breakfast,\" added the trader.  \"Is the king at home?\"    \"He is in the woods, but will be back quickly.\"  With this remark the  princess rose, and knocking the ashes out of her pipe, left the tent.    \"Upon my word, she's a cool beauty,\" said Peterkin.    \"I should rather say a black one,\" remarked Jack.    \"Perhaps an odd one would be the most appropriate term,\" said I.  \"Did  you ever see such a headdress?\"    The manner in which the Princess Oninga had seen fit to dress her head  was indeed peculiar, I may say ludicrous.  Her woolly hair had been  arranged in the form of a cocked hat, with a horn projecting in front,  and at a short distance off it might easily have been mistaken for the  headpiece of a general officer minus the feathers.  There was little in  the way of artificial ornament about it, but the princess wore a number  of heavy brass rings on her arms and ankles.  Those on the latter  reached half-way up to her knees, and they were so heavy that her walk  was little better than a clumsy waddle.  Before we could pass further  comment on her appearance, King Jambai entered, and saluted us by taking  us each separately and rubbing noses with us.  This done, he ordered in  breakfast, which consisted of roast and boiled plantains, ground nuts,  roast fowl, and roast pig; so we fell to at once, and being exceedingly  hungry after our long walk of the day before, made a hearty meal.    \"Now, sir,\" said Jack, when our repast was about concluded, \"as you are  going to leave us soon, you had better arrange with the king about  getting us an interpreter and supplying us with a few men to carry our  goods.  I think you said there was once a man in the tribe who spoke a  little English.  Have you found out whether he is alive?\"    \"Yes; I have heard that he is alive and well, and is expected in every  day from a hunting expedition.  He is a splendid hunter and a capital  fellow.  His name is Makarooroo, and if you get him you will be  fortunate.\"    \"Then ask his black majesty,\" said Peterkin, \"as quick as you please,  for, to say truth, I'm rather anxious on this point.  I feel that we  should never get on without a good interpreter.\"    To our satisfaction we found that the king was quite willing to do all  that we wished and a great deal more.  In fact, we soon perceived that  he felt highly honoured by our visit, and had boasted not a little of  \"_his white men_\" to the chiefs of neighbouring tribes, some of whom had  come a considerable distance to see us.    \"You have made quite a conquest, gentlemen, of worthy Jambai,\" said the  trader, after translating the king's favourable reply.  \"The fact is he  is pleased with the liberality you have shown towards him in the way of  gifts, and is proud of the confidence you have placed in him.  Had you  been bent on a trading expedition, he would have opposed your further  progress; but knowing that you are simply hunters, he is anxious to  assist you by all the means at his command.  He is surprised, indeed, at  your taking so much trouble and coming so far merely to kill wild  animals, for he cannot understand the idea of sporting.  He himself  hunts for the sake of procuring meat.\"    \"Can he not understand,\" said Peterkin, \"that _we_ hunt for fun?\"    \"No, he don't quite see through that.  He said to me a few minutes ago,  `Have these men no meat at home, that they come all this long way to get  it?'  I told him that you had plenty, and then endeavoured to explain  your idea of hunting `for fun.'  But he shook his head, and I think he  does not believe you.\"    At this point in our conversation the king rose and gave the signal to  set out on the hunting expedition.  Instantly the whole population of  the town turned out and rushed to the banks of the river, near which it  stood, where canoes were prepared for us.  Suddenly there arose a great  shout, and the name \"Makarooroo, Makarooroo,\" passed from mouth to  mouth.  Presently a fine, tall, deep-chested and broad-shouldered negro  stepped up to the king and laid a leopard skin at his feet, while the  people shouted and danced with delight at the success of their  companion; for, as I have already stated, it is deemed a bold feat to  attack and slay a leopard single-handed.    While the commotion caused by this event was going on, I said to the  trader--    \"How comes it that Makarooroo can speak English?\"    \"He spent a couple of years on the coast, in the service of a  missionary, and during that time attended the missionary school, where  he picked up a smattering of English and a trifle of geography and  arithmetic; but although a stout, sturdy hunter, and an intelligent man,  he was a lazy student, and gave the good missionary much trouble to  hammer the little he knows into his thick skull.  At last he grew tired  of it, and returned to his tribe; but he brought his Bible with him, and  I am told is very diligent in the study of it.  His education has gained  for him a great reputation as a fetishman, or doctor of mysteries, among  his people.  I used often to see him at school hammering away at m-a,  ma-b-a, ba, and so on, amid a group of children.  He used to sit beside  the king--\"    \"The king!\" said I, in surprise.    \"Ay; the king of that district became a Christian, and he and the queen,  with one or two others of the royal household, used to attend school  with the children every day, and their diligence in studying the A B C  was beyond all praise.  But they were terribly stupid.  The children  beat them easily, showing how true is the saying that `youth is the time  to learn.'  The king was always booby, and Makarooroo was always beside  him.\"    As the trader spoke, Makarooroo came forward and shook hands with him in  the English fashion.  He was then introduced to us, and expressed his  willingness to become our interpreter in somewhat curious but quite"]]]
