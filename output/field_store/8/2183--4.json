Suneetee heaped but evil,--hence her son      Dhruva the luckless! But for all this, child,      It is not meet that thou shouldst ever grieve      As I have said. That man is truly wise      Who is content with what he has, and seeks      Nothing beyond, but in whatever sphere,      Lowly or great, God placed him, works in faith;      My son, my son, though proud Suruchee spake      Harsh words indeed, and hurt thee to the quick,      Yet to thine eyes thy duty should be plain.      Collect a large sum of the virtues; thence      A goodly harvest must to thee arise.      Be meek, devout, and friendly, full of love,      Intent to do good to the human race      And to all creatures sentient made of God;      And oh, be humble, for on modest worth      Descends prosperity, even as water flows      Down to low grounds.\"                          She finished, and her son,      Who patiently had listened, thus replied:--        \"Mother, thy words of consolation find      Nor resting-place, nor echo in this heart      Broken by words severe, repulsing Love      That timidly approached to worship. Hear      My resolve unchangeable. I shall try      The highest good, the loftiest place to win,      Which the whole world deems priceless and desires.      There is a crown above my father's crown,      I shall obtain it, and at any cost      Of toil, or penance, or unceasing prayer.      Not born of proud Suruchee, whom the king      Favours and loves, but grown up from a germ      In thee, O mother, humble as thou art,      I yet shall show thee what is in my power.      Thou shalt behold my glory and rejoice.      Let Uttama my brother,--not thy son,--      Receive the throne and royal titles,--all      My father pleases to confer on him.      I grudge them not. Not with another's gifts      Desire I, dearest mother, to be rich,      But with my own work would acquire a name.      And I shall strive unceasing for a place      Such as my father hath not won,--a place      That would not know him even,--aye, a place      Far, far above the highest of this earth.\"        He said, and from his mother's chambers past,      And went into the wood where hermits live,      And never to his father's house returned.        Well kept the boy his promise made that day!      By prayer and penance Dhruva gained at last      The highest heavens, and there he shines a star!      Nightly men see him in the firmament.          VI.    BUTTOO.          \"Ho! Master of the wondrous art!      Instruct me in fair archery,      And buy for aye,--a grateful heart      That will not grudge to give thy fee.\"      Thus spoke a lad with kindling eyes,      A hunter's low-born son was he,--      To Dronacharjya, great and wise,      Who sat with princes round his knee.        Up Time's fair stream far back,--oh far,      The great wise teacher must be sought!      The Kurus had not yet in war      With the Pandava brethren fought.      In peace, at Dronacharjya's feet,      Magic and archery they learned,      A complex science, which we meet      No more, with ages past inurned.        \"And who art thou,\" the teacher said,      \"My science brave to learn so fain?      Which many kings who wear the thread      Have asked to learn of me in vain.\"      \"My name is Buttoo,\" said the youth,      \"A hunter's son, I know not Fear;\"      The teacher answered, smiling smooth,      \"Then know him from this time, my dear.\"        Unseen the magic arrow came,      Amidst the laughter and the scorn      Of royal youths,--like lightning flame      Sudden and sharp. They blew the horn,      As down upon the ground he fell,      Not hurt, but made a jest and game;--      He rose,--and waved a proud farewell,      But cheek and brow grew red with shame.        And lo,--a single, single tear      Dropped from his eyelash as he past,      \"My place I gather is not here;      No matter,--what is rank or caste?      In us is honour, or disgrace,      Not out of us,\" 'twas thus he mused,      \"The question is,--not wealth or place,      But gifts well used, or gifts abused.\"        \"And I shall do my best to gain      The science that man will not teach,      For life is as a shadow vain,      Until the utmost goal we reach      To which the soul points. I shall try      To realize my waking dream,      And what if I should chance to die?      None miss one bubble from a stream.\"        So thinking, on and on he went,      Till he attained the forest's verge,      The garish day was well-nigh spent,      Birds had already raised its dirge.      Oh what a scene! How sweet and calm!      It soothed at once his wounded pride,      And on his spirit shed a balm      That all its yearnings purified.        What glorious trees! The sombre saul      On which the eye delights to rest,      The betel-nut,--a pillar tall,      With feathery branches for a crest,      The light-leaved tamarind spreading wide,      The pale faint-scented bitter neem,      The seemul, gorgeous as a bride,      With flowers that have the ruby's gleam,        The Indian fig's pavilion tent      In which whole armies might repose,      With here and there a little rent,      The sunset's beauty to disclose,      The bamboo boughs that sway and swing      'Neath bulbuls as the south wind blows,      The mangoe-tope, a close dark ring,      Home of the rooks and clamorous crows,        The champac, bok, and South-sea pine,      The nagessur with pendant flowers      Like ear-rings,--and the forest vine      That clinging over all, embowers,      The sirish famed in Sanscrit song      Which rural maidens love to wear,      The peepul giant-like and strong,      The bramble with its matted hair,        All these, and thousands, thousands more,      With helmet red, or golden crown,      Or green tiara, rose before      The youth in evening's shadows brown.      He passed into the forest,--there      New sights of wonder met his view,      A waving Pampas green and fair      All glistening with the evening dew.        How vivid was the breast-high grass!      Here waved in patches, forest corn,--      Here intervened a deep morass,--      Here arid spots of verdure shorn      Lay open,--rock or barren sand,--      And here again the trees arose      Thick clustering,--a glorious band      Their tops still bright with sunset glows.--        Stirred in the breeze the crowding boughs,      And seemed to welcome him with signs,      Onwards and on,--till Buttoo's brows      Are gemmed with pearls, and day declines.      Then in a grassy open space      He sits and leans against a tree,      To let the wind blow on his face      And look around him leisurely.        Herds, and still herds, of timid deer      Were feeding in the solitude,      They knew not man, and felt no fear,      And heeded not his neighbourhood,      Some young ones with large eyes and sweet      Came close, and rubbed their foreheads smooth      Against his arms, and licked his feet,      As if they wished his cares to soothe.        \"They touch me,\" he exclaimed with joy,      \"They have no pride of caste like men,      They shrink not from the hunter-boy,      Should not my home be with them then?      Here in this forest let me dwell,      With these companions innocent,      And learn each science and each spell      All by myself in banishment.        \"A calm, calm life,--and it shall be      Its own exceeding great reward!      No thoughts to vex in all I see,      No jeers to bear or disregard;--      All creatures and inanimate things      Shall be my tutors; I shall learn      From beast, and fish, and bird with wings,      And rock, and stream, and tree, and fern.\"        With this resolve, he soon began      To build a hut, of reeds and leaves,      And when that needful work was done      He gathered in his store, the sheaves      Of forest corn, and all the fruit,      Date, plum, guava, he could find,      And every pleasant nut and root      By Providence for man designed,        A statue next of earth he made,      An image of the teacher wise,      So deft he laid, the light and shade,      On figure, forehead, face and eyes,      That any one who chanced to view      That image tall might soothly swear,      If he great Dronacharjya knew,      The teacher in his flesh was there.        Then at the statue's feet he placed      A bow, and arrows tipped with steel,      With wild-flower garlands interlaced,      And hailed the figure in his zeal      As Master, and his head he bowed,      A pupil reverent from that hour      Of one who late had disallowed      The claim, in pride of place and power.        By strained sense, by constant prayer,      By steadfastness of heart and will,      By courage to confront and dare,      All obstacles he conquered still;      A conscience clear,--a ready hand,      Joined to a meek humility,      Success must everywhere command,      How could he fail who had all three!        And now, by tests assured, he knows      His own God-gifted wondrous might,      Nothing to any man he owes,      Unaided he has won the fight;      Equal to gods themselves,--above      Wishmo and Drona,--for his worth      His name, he feels, shall be with love      Reckoned with great names of the earth.        Yet lacks he not, in reverence      To Dronacharjya, who declined      To teach him,--nay, with e'en offence      That well might wound a noble mind,      Drove him away;--for in his heart      Meek, placable, and ever kind,      Resentment had not any part,      And Malice never was enshrined.        One evening, on his work intent,      Alone he practised Archery,      When lo! the bow proved false and sent      The arrow from its mark awry;      Again he tried,--and failed again;      Why was it? Hark!--A wild dog's bark!      An evil omen:--it was plain      Some evil on his path hung dark!        Thus many times he tried and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23259"],[0,"Home Taxidermy for Pleasure and Profit (#10)"],[1,"to use excelsior for the  main bulk of the body, merely covering the outside with a thin layer of  tow. This is not only more economical but makes a lighter specimen than  one filled with tow entirely. Excelsior or wood wool is to be had in  varying degrees of fineness of upholstery dealers.    [Illustration: SPREAD EAGLE. WINGS BRACED UP TO DRY.]    In the case of a bird which has been wired and sewn up seeming to  require further filling out, it can be accomplished in most cases by  making an incision under each wing and introducing some flakes of tow  with a wire stuffing tool. If the bird is mounted with closed wings this  slit need not even be sewed up as the folded wing covers it completely.          CHAPTER XI.    TANNING, CLEANING AND POISONING SKINS.      I have used the following method for some years successfully on skins up  to and including the deer in size. Most larger skins need thinning with  a special tool, though an experienced hand can manage to thin a heavy  hide with a common draw knife.    An empty lard tub, a half barrel or a large earthenware jar to hold the  tan liquor, a fleshing knife and a fleshing beam are necessary to begin  with at least. Any smith can make a knife of an old, large file or rasp  by working both sides to a blunt edge and drawing the upper end out in a  tang for another handle. A piece of old scythe blade with cloth wrapped  around the ends will do, or a dull draw knife, either. One blade filed  into fine teeth will be useful in removing the inner or muscular skin.    [Illustration: FLESHING KNIFE. (Made from old rasp)]    A slab or plank 6 or 7 feet long, with one end tapered and half rounded,  on 2 or 4 legs of such length as to bring the end against the workman's  chest, makes a beam.    [Illustration: BENCH BEAM.]    A short piece of plank rounded off and bolted to the top of the table or  work bench will do for small skins.    [Illustration: ADJUSTABLE BEAM.]    Make up the quantity of tanning liquor you wish by the following  formula, also given in Chapter III:        Water                    1 gallon      Salt                     1 quart    Bring to the boiling point to readily dissolve the salt, and add        Sulphuric acid           1 fluid ounce    Allow it to cool before putting in the skins. _Handle the undiluted  acid with care._ Use common coarse salt and the commercial acid.  Skins not wanted at once may be left in this pickle for months without  injury.    About a gallon of pickle to a fox size skin is the correct amount, but  it may be used several times before losing its strength.    After the skin is removed from the carcass any blood and dirt is washed  from the fur, the flesh side well salted, rolled up and left 12 to 48  hours. Then thoroughly beam or scrape down the inside of the skin,  removing all flesh, fat and muscles. Skins already dry may be placed  either in clear water or tan liquor until they soften up. It takes  longer to soften in the tan, but if put in water it must be watched or  the hair will start, especially in warm weather.    A very hard, dry skin must be soaked and scraped alternately until  thoroughly relaxed. When well softened, treat same as a fresh skin. If  very fat or greasy, soak the skin in benzine an hour, wring out well,  hang up till the benzine is about evaporated, then place in the tan. If  not very fat the skin need not be put in the benzine first, but go in  the tan at once after being scraped. I use common stove gasoline for  benzine; it is as good for the purpose of cleaning and deodorizing, and  cheaper. It must never be used in the vicinity of fire or a lighted  lamp, as its evaporation produces a very explosive gas. For this reason  I do the cleaning and beating of furs out of doors if practicable.  Gasoline wrung out of skins may be saved and, after allowing to settle,  used again and again. It will not do for the final cleaning of white  furs, but for removing grease before tanning, it is as good as any. Stir  the skins about in the tan frequently that all parts may come in contact  with the solution.    Light skins like the fox will tan in 24 to 48 hours; heavier ones in  proportional time. When on pulling or stretching the flesh side, it  whitens, it is tanned. On taking from the tan, rinse the skin well in  lukewarm water containing a handful of washing soda to the bucketful.  Wring out with the hands and soak again in benzine for half an hour.  Wring out of this and clean the fur at once as follows:    Fill a shallow box part full of clean sand or corn meal which has been  heated in a pot or pan over the fire or in an oven. Work the skin about  in this until the fur is filled with the meal; then shake or beat it  out. Repeat the working in meal and beating until the fur is clean and  bright. Never put a damp skin into the meal without the gasoline bath  first, or you will have the time of your life getting the meal out.  Regular fur dressers use very fine saw dust, but meal is to be had  anywhere. Plaster of paris will do, but it is most too fine. This  treatment with gasoline or benzine removes the grease and animal odors  so apt to cling to Indian or home-dressed skins. After cleaning, allow  the skin to partly dry in the air and shade; then soften it by  stretching, pulling and rubbing in every part. There is no way to  accomplish this without work. A pad made of old bags, pieces of blanket,  etc., put on the beam, the skin placed on that and stretched in all  directions with the blunt edge of the fleshing knife is as good as any  way. Keep up the stretching until the skin is quite dry. If any part  should dry out too fast for the operator (that is, before it gets  stretched) it can be dampened with water on the flesh side and then  treated like the rest. If it is wanted extra soft the skin may be  thinned down with sandpaper. If the dressed skin is wanted to lie flat  as for a rug, it can be moistened on the flesh side; then stretched out  and tacked fur side up on a board, the table top or the floor until dry.  If this should cause it to harden or stiffen too much break it again  without stretching too much.    Another very good tanning solution is the following:        Salt                               1 quart      Oxalic acid (pulverized)           4 ounces      Water                              2 gallons    Dissolve well and immerse the skins, treating them as already directed,  rinsing in clear water only. It is also best to allow a little more time  for tanning in this solution.    While on the subject of dressing skins a few words in regard to cleaning  furs will be in order. White furs especially that have become soiled and  matted from use need cleaning frequently and are brought to the furrier  or taxidermist for that purpose.    A good washing in gasoline will usually remove the dirt, then dry out as  in dressing furs. Furriers often use powdered magnesia for this purpose  but almost any finely divided white powder will do about as well. A long  siege of beating, shaking and brushing will be necessary to get the  drying powder all out of the fur so it will not sift out on the garments  when wearing.    If the piece to be cleaned is large (like a coat or cloak) the lining  should be removed before cleaning. Neck pieces and small furs are  cleaned with linings, wadding, etc., intact. If the fur is so matted  that beating does not fluff it out, it must be combed, using a metal fur  comb to break up the tangles.    Charges for this work are based on the time used, though at least 75c.  or $1.00 each is charged for the small pieces.    As chemicals exposed to the changes of atmosphere are likely to lose  strength in time, the owners of mounted heads generally take the  precaution of having them poisoned against moth at varying intervals.    Personally I think once in three years is sufficient but some prefer to  be on the safe side where valuable heads are concerned and have them  treated yearly.    Large heads like buffalo, moose, and elk may be poisoned as they hang,  thus obviating any subsequent handling which would be to the detriment  of both specimen and operator.    Heads the size of deer and smaller are readily removed and replaced.    First dust the head well and comb the hair or pelt to detect the  presence of moth. If loose hairs reveal this the head should be removed  to the open air, unscrewed from the shield and saturated with gasoline,  which will kill both the moth and its eggs, after which poison against a  repetition of the offense.    Pin an old cloth or newspapers about the neck to protect the shield and  wall and spray the entire skin of the head with the diluted arsenical  solution as recommended in Chapter III. Seedsmen sell a sprayer for use  on plants which is about the most convenient size, though the larger  size used in the vegetable garden or even a toilet atomizer will  distribute the solution.    After it has dried wipe off the eyes and nose with a damp cloth and  handle as little as possible.    The common tariff on such work is for treating a single head not less  than $1.00. Two to four at one place, 75c. each, and over four, 50c.  This for poisoning only. Extra charges for killing moth. Such work  should be done in spring or early summer in the Central States in order  to be effective.          CHAPTER XII.    MAKING ANIMAL FUR RUGS.      Probably the first use (after clothing) made of skins was as rugs or  coverings for the ground or couches, and in this shape they are still to  be found in our most elegantly furnished homes. One of the few survivals  of primitive tastes.    The skins of some few animals such as Polar and Grizzly Bears, Tiger,  Jaguar, Lion, Puma, Leopards and Ocelots are used for little else,  though some of the spotted cats are used for eccentric looking coats and  fur sets. Other smaller skins such as wolf, fox, 'coon, wild cat, etc.  are much in favor as rugs as well as for garment furs.    In skinning an animal for use as "]]]
