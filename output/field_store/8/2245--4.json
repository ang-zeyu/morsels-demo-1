How long is it since you began it? Over three months,  isn't it?\"    \"This is the third piece of the same pattern I've done in three  months, Aunt Susanna,\" said Laura presently. Laura is an old duck. She  never gets cross and snaps back. I do; and it's so hard not to with  Aunt Susanna sometimes. But I generally manage it for I'd do anything  for Margaret. Laura did not tell Aunt Susanna that she sold her lace  at the Women's Exchange in town and made enough to buy her new hats.  She makes enough out of her water colors to dress herself.    Aunt Susanna took a second breath and started in again.    \"I notice your violin hasn't quite as much dust on it as the rest of  the things in this room, Kate. It's a pity you stopped playing just as  I came in. I don't enjoy fiddling much but I'd prefer it to seeing  anyone using a needle who isn't accustomed to it.\"    Kate is really a most dainty needlewoman and does all the fine sewing  in our family. She colored and said nothing--that being the highest  pitch of virtue to which our Katie, like myself, can attain.    \"And there's Margaret ruining her eyes over books,\" went on Aunt  Susanna severely. \"Will you kindly tell me, Margaret Thorne, what good  you ever expect Latin to do you?\"    \"Well, you see, Aunt Susanna,\" said Margaret gently--Magsie and Laura  are birds of a feather--\"I want to be a teacher if I can manage to get  through, and I shall need Latin for that.\"    All the girls except me had now got their accustomed rap, but I knew  better than to hope I should escape.    \"So you're reading a recipe book, Agnes? Well, that's better than  poring over a novel. I'm afraid you haven't been at it very long  though. People generally don't read recipes upside down--and besides,  you didn't quite cover up your portfolio. I see a corner of it  sticking out. Was genius burning before I came in? It's too bad if I  quenched the flame.\"    \"A cookery book isn't such a novelty to me as you seem to think, Aunt  Susanna,\" I said, as meekly as it was possible for me. \"Why I'm a real  good cook--'if I do say it as hadn't orter.'\"    I am, too.    \"Well, I'm glad to hear it,\" said Aunt Susanna skeptically, \"because  that has to do with my errand her to-day. I'm in a peck of troubles.  Firstly, Miranda Mary's mother has had to go and get sick and Miranda  Mary must go home to wait on her. Secondly, I've just had a telegram  from my sister-in-law who has been ordered west for her health, and  I'll have to leave on to-night's train to see her before she goes. I  can't get back until the noon train Thursday, and that is  Thanksgiving, and I've invited Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert to dinner that  day. They'll come on the same train. I'm dreadfully worried. There  doesn't seem to be anything I can do except get on of you girls to go  up to the Pinery Thursday morning and cook the dinner for us. Do you  think you can manage it?\"    We all felt rather dismayed, and nobody volunteered with a rush. But  as I had just boasted that I could cook it was plainly my duty to step  into the breach, and I did it with fear and trembling.    \"I'll go, Aunt Susanna,\" I said.    \"And I'll help you,\" said Kate.    \"Well, I suppose I'll have to try you,\" said Aunt Susanna with the air  of a woman determined to make the best of a bad business. \"Here is the  key of the kitchen door. You'll find everything in the pantry, turkey  and all. The mince pies are all ready made so you'll only have to warm  them up. I want dinner sharp at twelve for the train is due at 11:50.  Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert are very particular and I do hope you will have  things right. Oh, if I could only be home myself! Why will people get  sick at such inconvenient times?\"    \"Don't worry, Aunt Susanna,\" I said comfortingly. \"Kate and I will  have your Thanksgiving dinner ready for you in tiptop style.\"    \"Well I'm sure I hope so. Don't get to mooning over a story, Agnes.  I'll lock the library up and fortunately there are no fiddles at the  Pinery. Above all, don't let any of the McGinnises in. They'll be sure  to be prowling around when I'm not home. Don't give that dog of theirs  any scraps either. That is Miranda Mary's one fault. She will feed  that dog in spite of all I can do and I can't walk out of my own back  door without falling over him.\"    We promise to eschew the McGinnises and all their works, including  the dog, and when Aunt Susanna had gone we looked at each other with  mingled hope and fear.    \"Girls, this is the chance of your lives,\" said Laura. \"If you can  only please Aunt Susanna with this dinner it will convince her that  you are good cooks in spite of your nefarious bent for music and  literature. I consider the illness of Miranda Mary's mother a  Providential interposition--that is, if she isn't too sick.\"    \"It's all very well for you to be pleased, Lolla,\" I said dolefully.  \"But I don't feel jubilant over the prospect at all. Something will  probably go wrong. And then there's our own nice little Thanksgiving  celebration we've planned, and pinched and economized for weeks to  provide. That is half spoiled now.\"    \"Oh, what is that compared to Margaret's chance of going to college?\"  exclaimed Kate. \"Cheer up, Aggie. You know we can cook. I feel that it  is now or never with Aunt Susanna.\"    I cheered up accordingly. We are not given to pessimism which is  fortunate. Ever since father died four years ago we have struggled on  here, content to give up a good deal just to keep our home and be  together. This little gray house--oh, how we do love it and its apple  trees--is ours and we have, as aforesaid, a tiny income and our  ambitions; not very big ambitions but big enough to give zest to our  lives and hope to the future. We've been very happy as a rule. Aunt  Susanna has a big house and lots of money but she isn't as happy as  we are. She nags us a good deal--just as she used to nag father--but  we don't mind it very much after all. Indeed, I sometimes suspect that  we really like Aunt Susanna tremendously if she'd only leave us alone  long enough to find it out.    Thursday morning was an ideal Thanksgiving morning--bright, crisp and  sparkling. There had been a white frost in the night, and the orchard  and the white birch wood behind it looked like fairyland. We were all  up early. None of us had slept well, and both Kate and I had had the  most fearful dreams of spoiling Aunt Susanna's Thanksgiving dinner.    \"Never mind, dreams always go by contraries, you know,\" said Laura  cheerfully. \"You'd better go up to the Pinery early and get the fires  on, for the house will be cold. Remember the McGinnises and the dog.  Weigh the turkey so that you'll know exactly how long to cook it. Put  the pies in the oven in time to get piping hot--lukewarm mince pies  are an abomination. Be sure--\"    \"Laura, don't confuse us with any more cautions,\" I groaned, \"or we  shall get hopelessly fuddled. Come on, Kate, before she has time to.\"    [Illustration]    It wasn't very far up to the Pinery--just ten minutes' walk, and such  a delightful walk on that delightful morning. We went through the  orchard and then through the white birch wood where the loveliness of  the frosted boughs awed us. Beyond that there was a lane between ranks  of young, balsamy, white-misted firs and then an open pasture field,  sere and crispy. Just across it was the Pinery, a lovely old house  with dormer windows in the roof, surrounded by pines that were dark  and glorious against the silvery morning sky.    The McGinnis dog was sitting on the back-door steps when we arrived.  He wagged his tail ingratiatingly, but we ruthlessly pushed him off,  went in and shut the door in his face. All the little McGinnises were  sitting in a row on their fence, and they whooped derisively. The  McGinnis manners are not those which appertain to the caste of Vere de  Vere; but we rather like the urchins--there are eight of them--and we  would probably have gone over to talk to them if we had not had the  fear of Aunt Susanna before our eyes.    We kindled the fires, weighed the turkey, put it in the oven and  prepared the vegetables. Then we set the dining-room table and  decorated it with Aunt Susanna's potted ferns and dishes of lovely red  apples. Everything went so smoothly that we soon forgot to be nervous.  When the turkey was done, we took it out, set it on the back of the  range to keep warm and put the mince pies in. The potatoes, cabbage  and turnips were bubbling away cheerfully, and everything was going as  merrily as a marriage bell. Then, all at once, things happened.    In an evil hour we went to the yard window and looked out. We saw a  quiet scene. The McGinnis dog was still sitting on his haunches by the  steps, just as he had been sitting all the morning. Down in the  McGinnis yard everything wore an unusually peaceful aspect. Only one  McGinnis was in sight--Tony, aged eight, who was perched up on the  edge of the well box, swinging his legs and singing at the top of his  melodious Irish voice. All at once, just as we were looking at him,  Tony went over backward and apparently tumbled head foremost down his  father's well.    Kate and I screamed simultaneously. We tore across the kitchen, flung  open the door, plunged down over Aunt Susanna's yard, scrambled over  the fence and flew to the well. Just as we reached it, Tony's red head  appeared as he climbed serenely out over the box. I don't know whether  I felt more relieved or furious. He had merely fallen on the blank  guard inside the box: and there are times when I am tempted to think  he fell on purpose because he saw Kate and me looking out at the  window. At least he didn't seem at all frightened, and grinned most  impishly at us.    Kate and I turned on our heels and marched back in as dignified a  manner as was possible under the circumstances.

I always feel as if I'd like to be alone for a spell  after a disagreeable experience.\"    David obeyed sadly and put on his cap and overcoat. Josephine kindly  warned him not to slip and break his legs on the porch, because the  floor was as icy as anything; and she even lighted a candle and held  it up at the kitchen door to guide him safely out. David, as he  trudged sorrowfully homeward across the fields, carried with him the  mental picture of a plump, sonsy woman, in a trim dress of  plum-coloured homespun and ruffled blue-check apron, haloed by  candlelight. It was not a very romantic vision, perhaps, but to David  it was more beautiful than anything else in the world.    When David was gone Josephine shut the door with a little shiver. She  blew out the candle, for it was not yet dark enough to justify  artificial light to her thrifty mind. She thought the big, empty  house, in which she was the only living thing, was very lonely. It was  so still, except for the slow tick of the \"grandfather's clock\" and  the soft purr and crackle of the wood in the stove. Josephine sat down  by the window.    \"I wish some of the Sentners would run down,\" she said aloud. \"If  David hadn't been so ridiculous I'd have got him to stay the evening.  He can be good company when he likes--he's real well-read and  intelligent. And he must have dismal times at home there with nobody  but Zillah.\"    She looked across the yard to the little house at the other side of  it, where her French-Canadian hired man lived, and watched the purple  spiral of smoke from its chimney curling up against the crocus sky.  Would she run over and see Mrs. Leon Poirier and her little  black-eyed, brown-skinned baby? No, they never knew what to say to  each other.    \"If 'twasn't so cold I'd go up and see Ida,\" she said. \"As it is, I  guess I'd better fall back on my knitting, for I saw Jimmy Sentner's  toes sticking through his socks the other day. How setback poor David  did look, to be sure! But I think I've settled that marrying notion of  his once for all and I'm glad of it.\"    She said the same thing next day to Mrs. Tom Sentner, who had come  down to help her pick her geese. They were at work in the kitchen with  a big tubful of feathers between them, and on the table a row of dead  birds, which Leon had killed and brought in. Josephine was enveloped  in a shapeless print wrapper, and had an apron tied tightly around her  head to keep the down out of her beautiful hair, of which she was  rather proud.    \"What do you think, Ida?\" she said, with a hearty laugh at the  recollection. \"David Hartley was here to tea last night, and asked me  to marry him again. There's a persistent man for you. I can't brag of  ever having had many beaux, but I've certainly had my fair share of  proposals.\"    Mrs. Tom did not laugh. Her thin little face, with its faded  prettiness, looked as if she never laughed.    \"Why won't you marry him?\" she said fretfully.    \"Why should I?\" retorted Josephine. \"Tell me that, Ida Sentner.\"    \"Because it is high time you were married,\" said Mrs. Tom decisively.  \"I don't believe in women living single. And I don't see what better  you can do than take David Hartley.\"    Josephine looked at her sister with the interested expression of a  person who is trying to understand some mental attitude in another  which is a standing puzzle to her. Ida's evident wish to see her  married always amused Josephine. Ida had married very young and for  fifteen years her life had been one of drudgery and ill-health. Tom  Sentner was a lazy, shiftless fellow. He neglected his family and was  drunk half his time. Meadowby people said that he beat his wife when  \"on the spree,\" but Josephine did not believe that, because she did  not think that Ida could keep from telling her if it were so. Ida  Sentner was not given to bearing her trials in silence.    Had it not been for Josephine's assistance, Tom Sentner's family would  have stood an excellent chance of starvation. Josephine practically  kept them, and her generosity never failed or stinted. She fed and  clothed her nephews and nieces, and all the gray socks whose  destination puzzled David so much went to the Sentners.    As for Josephine herself, she had a good farm, a comfortable house, a  plump bank account, and was an independent, unworried woman. And yet,  in the face of all this, Mrs. Tom Sentner could bewail the fact that  Josephine had no husband to look out for her. Josephine shrugged her  shoulders and gave up the conundrum, merely saying ironically, in  reply to her sister's remark:    \"And go to live with Zillah Hartley?\"    \"You know very well you wouldn't have to do that. Ever since John  Hartley's wife at the Creek died he's been wanting Zillah to go and  keep house for him, and if David got married Zillah'd go quick. Catch  her staying there if you were mistress! And David has such a beautiful  house! It's ten times finer than yours, though I don't deny yours is  comfortable. And his farm is the best in Meadowby and joins yours.  Think what a beautiful property they'd make together. You're all right  now, Josephine, but what will you do when you get old and have nobody  to take care of you? I declare the thought worries me at night till I  can't sleep.\"    \"I should have thought you had enough worries of your own to keep you  awake at nights without taking over any of mine,\" said Josephine  drily. \"As for old age, it's a good ways off for me yet. When your  Jack gets old enough to have some sense he can come here and live with  me. But I'm not going to marry David Hartley, you can depend on that,  Ida, my dear. I wish you could have heard him rhyming off that poetry  last night. It doesn't seem to matter much what piece he  recites--first thing that comes into his head, I reckon. I remember  one time he went clean through that hymn beginning, 'Hark from the  tombs a doleful sound,' and two years ago it was 'To Mary in Heaven,'  as lackadaisical as you please. I never had such a time to keep from  laughing, but I managed it, for I wouldn't hurt his feelings for the  world. No, I haven't any intention of marrying anybody, but if I had  it wouldn't be dear old sentimental, easy-going David.\"    Mrs. Tom thumped a plucked goose down on the bench with an expression  which said that she, for one, wasn't going to waste any more words on  an idiot. Easy-going, indeed! Did Josephine consider that a drawback?  Mrs. Tom sighed. If Josephine, she thought, had put up with Tom  Sentner's tempers for fifteen years she would know how to appreciate a  good-natured man at his real value.    The cold snap which had set in on the day of David's call lasted and  deepened for a week. On Saturday evening, when Mrs. Tom came down for  a jug of cream, the mercury of the little thermometer thumping against  Josephine's porch was below zero. The gulf was no longer blue, but  white with ice. Everything outdoors was crackling and snapping. Inside  Josephine had kept roaring fires all through the house but the only  place really warm was the kitchen.    \"Wrap your head up well, Ida,\" she said anxiously, when Mrs. Tom rose  to go. \"You've got a bad cold.\"    \"There's a cold going,\" said Mrs. Tom. \"Everyone has it. David Hartley  was up at our place to-day barking terrible--a real churchyard cough,  as I told him. He never takes any care of himself. He said Zillah had  a bad cold, too. Won't she be cranky while it lasts?\"    Josephine sat up late that night to keep fires on. She finally went to  bed in the little room opposite the big hall stove, and she slept at  once, and dreamed that the thumps of the thermometer flapping in the  wind against the wall outside grew louder and more insistent until  they woke her up. Some one was pounding on the porch door.    Josephine sprang out of bed and hurried on her wrapper and felt shoes.  She had no doubt that some of the Sentners were sick. They had a habit  of getting sick about that time of night. She hurried out and opened  the door, expecting to see hulking Tom Sentner, or perhaps Ida  herself, big-eyed and hysterical.    But David Hartley stood there, panting for breath. The clear moonlight  showed that he had no overcoat on, and he was coughing hard.  Josephine, before she spoke a word, clutched him by the arm and pulled  him in out of the wind.    \"For pity's sake, David Hartley, what is the matter?\"    \"Zillah's awful sick,\" he gasped. \"I came here because 'twas nearest.  Oh, won't you come over, Josephine? I've got to go for the doctor and  I can't leave her alone. She's suffering dreadful. I know you and her  ain't on good terms, but you'll come, won't you?\"    \"Of course I will,\" said Josephine sharply. \"I'm not a barbarian, I  hope, to refuse to go to the help of a sick person, if 'twas my worst  enemy. I'll go in and get ready and you go straight to the hall stove  and warm yourself. There's a good fire in it yet. What on earth do you  mean, starting out on a bitter night like this without an overcoat or  even mittens, and you with a cold like that?\"    \"I never thought of them, I was so frightened,\" said David  apologetically. \"I just lit up a fire in the kitchen stove as quick's  I could and run. It rattled me to hear Zillah moaning so's you could  hear her all over the house.\"    \"You need someone to look after you as bad as Zillah does,\" said  Josephine severely.    In a very few minutes she was ready, with a basket packed full of  homely remedies, \"for like as not there'll be no putting one's hand on  anything there,\" she muttered. She insisted on wrapping her big plaid  shawl around David's head and neck, and made him put on a pair of  mittens she had knitted for Jack Sentner. Then she locked the door and  they started across the gleaming, crusted field. It was so slippery  that Josephine had to cling to David's arm to keep her feet. In the"]]]
