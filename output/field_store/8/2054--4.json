The knotted, blood-stained hands, like claws of steel, bound the hind  legs close and fast with a leathern belt, and left between them a torn  and bloody sock.    \"Seven! On! Old Faithfull! We MUST have another! the last! This is your  day.\"    The blood that flecked the hunter was not all his own.    The sun slanted westwardly toward the purpling horizon; the grassy  plain gleamed like a ruffled sea of glass; the gray wolves loped on.    When next the hunter came within sight of the herd, over a wavy ridge,  changes in its shape and movement met his gaze. The calves were almost  done; they could run no more; their mothers faced the south, and  trotted slowly to and fro; the bulls were grunting, herding, piling  close. It looked as if the herd meant to stand and fight.    This mattered little to the hunter who had captured seven calves since  dawn. The first limping calf he reached tried to elude the grasping  hand and failed. Kentuck had been trained to wheel to the right or  left, in whichever way his rider leaned; and as Jones bent over and  caught an upraised tail, the horse turned to strike the calf with both  front hoofs. The calf rolled; the horse plunged down; the rider sped  beyond to the dust. Though the calf was tired, he still could bellow,  and he filled the air with robust bawls.    Jones all at once saw twenty or more buffalo dash in at him with fast,  twinkling, short legs. With the thought of it, he was in the air to the  saddle. As the black, round mounds charged from every direction,  Kentuck let out with all there was left in him. He leaped and whirled,  pitched and swerved, in a roaring, clashing, dusty melee. Beating hoofs  threw the turf, flying tails whipped the air, and everywhere were  dusky, sharp-pointed heads, tossing low. Kentuck squeezed out  unscathed. The mob of bison, bristling, turned to lumber after the main  herd. Jones seized his opportunity and rode after them, yelling with  all his might. He drove them so hard that soon the little fellows  lagged paces behind. Only one or two old cows straggled with the calves.    Then wheeling Kentuck, he cut between the herd and a calf, and rode it  down. Bewildered, the tously little bull bellowed in great affright.  The hunter seized the stiff tail, and calling to his horse, leaped off.  But his strength was far spent and the buffalo, larger than his  fellows, threshed about and jerked in terror. Jones threw it again and  again. But it struggled up, never once ceasing its loud demands for  help. Finally the hunter tripped it up and fell upon it with his knees.    Above the rumble of retreating hoofs, Jones heard the familiar short,  quick, jarring pound on the turf. Kentuck neighed his alarm and raced  to the right. Bearing down on the hunter, hurtling through the air, was  a giant furry mass, instinct with fierce life and power--a buffalo cow  robbed of her young.    With his senses almost numb, barely able to pull and raise the Colt,  the plainsman willed to live, and to keep his captive. His leveled arm  wavered like a leaf in a storm.    Bang! Fire, smoke, a shock, a jarring crash, and silence!    The calf stirred beneath him. He put out a hand to touch a warm, furry  coat. The mother had fallen beside him. Lifting a heavy hoof, he laid  it over the neck of the calf to serve as additional weight. He lay  still and listened. The rumble of the herd died away in the distance.    The evening waned. Still the hunter lay quiet. From time to time the  calf struggled and bellowed. Lank, gray wolves appeared on all sides;  they prowled about with hungry howls, and shoved black-tipped noses  through the grass. The sun sank, and the sky paled to opal blue. A star  shone out, then another, and another. Over the prairie slanted the  first dark shadow of night.    Suddenly the hunter laid his ear to the ground, and listened. Faint  beats, like throbs of a pulsing heart, shuddered from the soft turf.  Stronger they grew, till the hunter raised his head. Dark forms  approached; voices broke the silence; the creaking of a wagon scared  away the wolves.    \"This way!\" shouted the hunter weakly.    \"Ha! here he is. Hurt?\" cried Rude, vaulting the wheel.    \"Tie up this calf. How many--did you find?\" The voice grew fainter.    \"Seven--alive, and in good shape, and all your clothes.\"    But the last words fell on unconscious ears.        CHAPTER 4.    THE TRAIL    \"Frank, what'll we do about horses?\" asked Jones. \"Jim'll want the bay,  and of course you'll want to ride Spot. The rest of our nags will only  do to pack the outfit.\"    \"I've been thinkin',\" replied the foreman. \"You sure will need good  mounts. Now it happens that a friend of mine is just at this time at  House Rock Valley, an outlyin' post of one of the big Utah ranches. He  is gettin' in the horses off the range, an' he has some crackin' good  ones. Let's ooze over there--it's only thirty miles--an' get some  horses from him.\"    We were all eager to act upon Frank's suggestion. So plans were made  for three of us to ride over and select our mounts. Frank and Jim would  follow with the pack train, and if all went well, on the following  evening we would camp under the shadow of Buckskin.    Early next morning we were on our way. I tried to find a soft place on  Old Baldy, one of Frank's pack horses. He was a horse that would not  have raised up at the trumpet of doom. Nothing under the sun, Frank  said, bothered Old Baldy but the operation of shoeing. We made the  distance to the outpost by noon, and found Frank's friend a genial and  obliging cowboy, who said we could have all the horses we wanted.    While Jones and Wallace strutted round the big corral, which was full  of vicious, dusty, shaggy horses and mustangs, I sat high on the fence.  I heard them talking about points and girth and stride, and a lot of  terms that I could not understand. Wallace selected a heavy sorrel, and  Jones a big bay; very like Jim's. I had observed, way over in the  corner of the corral, a bunch of cayuses, and among them a clean-limbed  black horse. Edging round on the fence I got a closer view, and then  cried out that I had found my horse. I jumped down and caught him, much  to my surprise, for the other horses were wild, and had kicked  viciously. The black was beautifully built, wide-chested and powerful,  but not heavy. His coat glistened like sheeny black satin, and he had a  white face and white feet and a long mane.    \"I don't know about giving you Satan--that's his name,\" said the  cowboy. \"The foreman rides him often. He's the fastest, the best  climber, and the best dispositioned horse on the range.    \"But I guess I can let you have him,\" he continued, when he saw my  disappointed face.    \"By George!\" exclaimed Jones. \"You've got it on us this time.\"    \"Would you like to trade?\" asked Wallace, as his sorrel tried to bite  him. \"That black looks sort of fierce.\"    I led my prize out of the corral, up to the little cabin nearby, where  I tied him, and proceeded to get acquainted after a fashion of my own.  Though not versed in horse-lore, I knew that half the battle was to win  his confidence. I smoothed his silky coat, and patted him, and then  surreptitiously slipped a lump of sugar from my pocket. This sugar,  which I had purloined in Flagstaff, and carried all the way across the  desert, was somewhat disreputably soiled, and Satan sniffed at it  disdainfully. Evidently he had never smelled or tasted sugar. I pressed  it into his mouth. He munched it, and then looked me over with some  interest. I handed him another lump. He took it and rubbed his nose  against me. Satan was mine!    Frank and Jim came along early in the afternoon. What with packing,  changing saddles and shoeing the horses, we were all busy. Old Baldy  would not be shod, so we let him off till a more opportune time. By  four o'clock we were riding toward the slopes of Buckskin, now only a  few miles away, standing up higher and darker.    \"What's that for?\" inquired Wallace, pointing to a long, rusty,  wire-wrapped, double-barreled blunderbuss of a shotgun, stuck in the  holster of Jones's saddle.    The Colonel, who had been having a fine time with the impatient and  curious hounds, did not vouchsafe any information on that score. But  very shortly we were destined to learn the use of this incongruous  firearm. I was riding in advance of Wallace, and a little behind Jones.  The dogs--excepting Jude, who had been kicked and lamed--were ranging  along before their master. Suddenly, right before me, I saw an immense  jack-rabbit; and just then Moze and Don caught sight of it. In fact,  Moze bumped his blunt nose into the rabbit. When it leaped into scared  action, Moze yelped, and Don followed suit. Then they were after it in  wild, clamoring pursuit. Jones let out the stentorian blast, now  becoming familiar, and spurred after them. He reached over, pulled the  shotgun out of the holster and fired both barrels at the jumping dogs.    I expressed my amazement in strong language, and Wallace whistled.    Don came sneaking back with his tail between his legs, and Moze, who  had cowered as if stung, circled round ahead of us. Jones finally  succeeded in gettin him back.    \"Come in hyah! You measly rabbit dogs! What do you mean chasing off  that way? We're after lions. Lions! understand?\"    Don looked thoroughly convinced of his error, but Moze, being more  thick-headed, appeared mystified rather than hurt or frightened.    \"What size shot do you use?\" I asked.    \"Number ten. They don't hurt much at seventy five yards,\" replied our  leader. \"I use them as sort of a long arm. You see, the dogs must be  made to know what we're after. Ordinary means would never do in a case  like this. My idea is to break them of coyotes, wolves and deer, and  when we cross a lion trail, let them go. I'll teach them sooner than  you'd think. Only we must get where we can see what they're trailing."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20571"],[0,"Woman's Work in Music (#10)"],[1,"  last he was able to return to Prague and marry his faithful Caroline,  with the certainty of being able to provide her a home. The newly wedded  pair made a triumphant concert tour, and settled down to a life of  domestic felicity in Dresden. It can hardly be said that Weber lived  happily ever afterward, for he found many troubles in connection with  his new post. But his married life was such a constant source of joy to  him that he felt always inspired with fresh energy to overcome all  difficulties. It was during his married career that he won those immense  popular successes, with \"Der Freischuetz,\" \"Euryanthe,\" and \"Oberon,\"  that gave the most brilliant lustre to a name already immortal. The last  opera took him to London, away from his beloved family. Aware of his  failing health, he made every effort to reach home, but that boon was  denied him, and he died without another view of those who would have  been anxious to soothe his last moments.    Ludwig Spohr was another composer who possessed a musical wife. He came  of a musical family, his father being a flutist, while his mother played  the piano and sang. Ludwig took up the violin at five years of age, and  at six was able to take part in concerted music. His compositions began  at about the same time. After a youth of earnest study, long practice,  and successful tours, he finally became leader in the band of the Duke  of Gotha. It was there that he met Dorette Scheidler, the famous  harpist, whom he afterward married. Her influence is seen in his later  compositions, for he wrote for her a number of sonatas for harp and  violin, as well as a good many harp solos. The musical pair went on many  tours, always sharing the honours of the performances.    Still more evident is the influence of woman upon music in the case of  Hector Berlioz. This great genius, born in 1803, was the son of an opium  eater, and the morbid character of most of his works may be traced to  this cause. Berlioz studied at the Paris Conservatoire, but his  sensational style did not win favour with the classical Cherubini, and  the young man was forced to work against many difficulties. He was even  forbidden at one time to compete for the _Prix de Rome_, and came near  giving up his career in dejection.    On the Parisian stage was a beautiful Irish actress, named Harriet  Smithson, who was performing the plays of Shakespeare. Berlioz at once  fell in love with her, but it was some time before his needy  circumstances allowed him to lay his suit before her. When he did so,  his passion found shape and expression in a great musical work,--the  Symphonic Fantastique.    This is a weird and sinister composition, but very effective. It is in  five movements. The first represents a young man seeing his ideal and  falling in love with her, the object of this sudden affection being  depicted by a tender theme on the violin. This theme pervades the entire  work. In the second movement, which represents a ball, it signifies the  entrance of the fair one. The third movement is called \"In the Fields,\"  and contains a duet between the two lovers in the guise of a shepherd  and shepherdess. They are portrayed by an English horn and an oboe, the  result being one of the great instrumental dialogues that are sometimes  found in-works of the tone masters. An effective touch is the  introduction of a thunder-storm, after which the English horn begins a  plaintive note of inquiry, but meets with no reply. In the fourth  movement, the young man has slain his love in a fit of jealousy, and is  on his way to execution. Very powerful music expresses the fatal march,  interrupted every now and then by the surging footsteps of the crowd. At  its close, the hero ascends the scaffold; amid a hush, the tender love  theme reappears, but is obliterated by a sudden crash of the full  orchestra, and all is still. Berlioz, however, does not let his hero  rest in the grave, but adds a fifth movement to show him in the infernal  regions. Piccolo and other wild instruments depict the fury of the  demons, a parody on the Dies Irae follows, and even the tender  love-theme is not spared, but is turned into the most vulgar of waltzes.    This musical love-letter was understood, and Miss Smithson afterward  married the great composer. But, unfortunately, the romance stopped at  this point, and they did not \"live happily ever afterward.\" The actress  was forced by an accident to leave the stage permanently. She and her  husband did not agree well, and were continually at odds. Finally she  took to drink, and a separation soon followed. Berlioz married again,  his second wife being the singer, Mlle. Recio. He outlived her, and in  later life was taken care of by her mother.    The symphony, incidentally, was so successful at its first performance  that a strange-looking man rushed to the platform, saluted the composer,  and sent him a more substantial token in the shape of twenty thousand  francs. The stranger proved to be Paganini, but that famous violinist  was such a miser that the story has been doubted. It is said that he  acted in behalf of an unknown benefactor, but his enthusiasm at the  performance seems to disprove this, and the work possesses just the dark  and sinister character that would appeal to Paganini.    Another composition inspired by the same love episode is the \"Romeo and  Juliette\" Symphony. Berlioz tried to make all his music tell a story,  and he believed in the theory that tones could be made to represent  ideas in a much greater degree than is usually supposed. The result is  shown in many characteristic passages in his works, an excellent example  being the gentle and melancholy theme that typifies Childe Harold in the  symphony of that name. But Berlioz carried his idea to extremes, and  fairly earned the half-reproach of Wagner, who said of him: \"He ciphers  with notes.\" That Berlioz could write with more direct beauty is shown  by his practical joke at the expense of the critics; for he pretended to  unearth an old piece by a certain Pierre Ducre, which they praised  greatly in contrast with his own works, and after they had done their  worst, Berlioz proved that he himself was the mythical Ducre.    Giuseppe Verdi was another great musician who felt the full richness of  domestic happiness, if only for a time. Born in the little hamlet of Le  Roncole in 1813, he proved himself possessed of unusual talent, and  after a time went to Busseto for lessons. There he came to the notice of  M. Barezzi, who became the friend and patron of the young student. The  story of his being refused at the Milan Conservatory, and afterward  amazing the authorities by his speed in composing fugues, is too well  known to need repetition. After his Milan studies, we find him back at  Busseto, in love with Barezzi's daughter Margherita. The father, unlike  the usual stern parent who repels impecunious musicians, gave his  permission for their union, which took place soon after, in 1836.    In a couple of years he settled down in Milan, with his wife and two  children. Success began to crown his efforts, and his career of opera  composer was well begun, when his domestic happiness came to a complete  end. First one child fell sick and died of an unknown malady, then the  second followed it in a few days, and within two months the bereaved  mother was stricken with a fatal inflammation of the brain. In the midst  of all these misfortunes, Verdi was kept at work by a commission for \"Un  Giorno di Regno,\" which was to be a comic opera! Little wonder that the  wit oozed out of the occasion, and the performance proved a failure. The  despondent Verdi resolved to give up his career altogether, and only by  the insistence of the manager, Merelli, was he finally persuaded to  resume his occupation. In later life he married again, passing a placid  existence on his extensive estates.    The domestic career of Richard Wagner has formed the subject for endless  discussions. His birth, his early studies, his university career, and  his start as a professional musician, all took place in Leipsic. There,  too, he met the famous opera singer, Wilhelmine Schroeder-Devrient,  whose gifts made such an impression on the young composer. It was the  excellence of her acting, as well as her singing, that gave the embryo  reformer his first ideas of the intimate union of drama and music that  is one phase of his later operatic greatness. Many of his leading roles  were written for her, and as late as 1872 he stated that whenever he  conceived a new character he imagined her in the part.    His work as leader took him first to Magdeburg. The failure of his early  opera, \"Das Liebesverbot,\" put an end to this enterprise, and soon  afterward he appeared as concert leader in Koenigsberg. There he met and  married his first wife, Wilhelmina (or Minna) Planer. Their natures were  different in many respects. While he displayed many of the vagaries of  genius, she was patient and practical, and, if not wholly understanding  the highest side of his nature, she gave up her own career to help him  through his days of poverty and struggle.    The first venture of the wedded pair was at Riga, where Wagner was  engaged for a term to conduct in a new theatre. After this, they took  ship for Paris, and the stormy passage gave Wagner many a suggestion  for his \"Flying Dutchman.\" It was in the French capital that Minna's  domestic qualities were given their most severe trial, for the composer  found little or no chance to produce his own works, and was forced to  gain a precarious living by the commonest musical drudgery. Probably her  constant care and economy were all that turned the scale in favour of  success. At length the Dresden authorities became interested in some of  the earlier operas, and Wagner was liberated from his dependent  position.    The stay in Dresden being cut short by the political troubles of 1848  and 1849, Wagner"]]]
