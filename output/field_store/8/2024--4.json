Upon which it was worth observing how far they are come  from taking the reprehensions of a bishop seriously, that they all  laugh in the Chapel when he reflected on their ill actions and  courses. He did much press us to joy in these public days of joy, and  to hospitality; but one that stood by whispered in my eare that the  Bishop do not spend one groate to the poor himself. The Sermon done, a  good anthem followed with vialls, and the King come down to receive  the Sacrament. But I staid not, but, calling my boy from my Lord's  lodgings, and giving Sarah some good advice, by my Lord's order, to be  sober, and look after the house, I walked home again with great  pleasure, and there dined by my wife's bed side with great content,  having a mess of brave plum-porridge and a roasted pullet for dinner,  and I sent for a mince pie abroad, my wife not being well, to make any  herself yet.\"    [Footnote 15: Bishop of Winchester, died 1684.]    The popular love of Christmas is well exemplified in a little 16mo  book, printed in 1678, entitled \"The Examination and Tryal of old  Father CHRISTMAS; Together with his Clearing by the Jury, at the  Assizes held at the Town of _Difference_, in the County of  _Discontent_.\" The Jury was evidently a packed one. \"Then saith the  _Clerk_ to the _Cryer_, count them--_Starve-mouse_, one, _All-pride_,  two, _Keep-all_, three, _Love-none_, four, _Eat-alone_, five,  _Give-little_, six, _Hoard-corn_, seven, _Grutch-meat_, eight,  _Knit-gut_, nine, _Serve-time_, ten, _Hate-good_, eleven,  _Cold-kitchen_, twelve.    \"Then saith the _Cryer_, all you bountiful Gentlemen of the Jury,  answer to your names, and stand together, and hear your Charge.    \"With that there was such a lamentable groan heard, enough to turn Ice  into Ashes, which caused the _Judge_, and the rest of the Bench, to  demand what the matter was; it was replied that the grave old  Gentleman, _Christmas_, did sound (_swoon_) at the naming of the Jury;  then it was commanded that they should give him air, and comfort him  up, so that he might plead for himself: and here, I cannot pass by in  silence, the love that was expressed by the Country people, some  shreeking and crying for the old man; others striving to hold him up,  others hugging him, till they had almost broke the back of him,  others running for Cordials and strong waters, insomuch that, at last  they had called back his wandring spirits, which were ready to take  their last farewel.\"    Christmas challenged this jury, and another was empanelled consisting  of Messrs _Love-friend_, _Hate-strife_, _Free-man_, _Cloath-back_,  _Warm-gut_, _Good-work_, _Neighbour-hood_, _Open-house_, _Scorn-use_,  _Soft-heart_, _Merry-man_, and _True-love_. His Indictment was as  follows:    \"_Christmas_, thou art here indicted by the name of _Christmas_, of  the Town of _Superstition_, in the County of _Idolatry_, and that thou  hast, from time to time, abused the people of this Common-wealth,  drawing and inticing them to Drunkenness, Gluttony, and unlawful  Gaming, Wantonness, Uncleanness, Lasciviousness, Cursing, Swearing,  abuse of the Creatures, some to one Vice, and some to another; all to  Idleness: what sayest thou to thy Inditement, guilty or not guilty? He  answered, Not guilty, and so put himself to the Trial.\"    After the witnesses against him were heard, Christmas was asked what  he could say in his defence.    \"_Judge._--Old _Christmas_, hold up thy head, and speak for thy self.  Thou hast heard thy inditement, and also what all these Witnesses have  evidenced against thee; what sayest thou now for thy self, that  sentence of condemnation should not be pronounced against thee?    \"_Christmas._--Good my Lord, be favourable to an old man, I am above  One thousand six hundred years old, and was never questioned at Sizes  or Sessions before: my Lord, look on these white hairs, are they not a  Crown of Glory?...    \"And first, my Lord, I am wronged in being indited by a wrong name, I  am corruptly called _Christmas_, my name is _Christ-tide_ or time.    \"And though I generally come at a set time, yet I am with him every  day that knows how to use me.    \"My Lord, let the Records be searcht, and you shall find that the  Angels rejoyced at my coming, and sung _Gloria in excelsis_; the  Patriarchs and Prophets longed to see me.    \"The Fathers have sweetly imbraced me, our modern Divines all  comfortably cherisht me; O let me not be despised now I'm old. Is  there not an injunction in _Magna Charta_, that commands men to  inquire for the old way, which is the good way; many good deeds do I  do, O, why do the people hate me? We are commanded to be given to  Hospitality, and this hath been my practice from my youth upward: I  come to put men in mind of their redemption, to have them love one  another, to impart with something here below, that they may receive  more and better things above; the wise man saith _There is a time for  all things_, and why not for thankfulness? I have been the cause that  at my coming, Ministers have instructed the people every day in  publick, telling the people how they should use me, and other  delights, not to effeminate, or corrupt the mind, and bid them abhor  those pleasures from which they should not rise bettered, and that  they should by no means turn pass-time into Trade: And if that at any  time they have stept an Inch into excess, to punish themselves for it,  and be ever after the more careful to keep within compass.    \"And did also advise them to manage their sports without Passion; they  would also tell the people that their feasts should not be much more  than nature requires, and grace moderates; not pinching, nor  pampering; And whereas they say that I am the cause they sit down to  meat, and rise up again graceless, they abundantly wrong me: I have  told them that before any one should put his hand in the dish, he  should look up to the owner, and hate to put one morsel in his mouth  unblessed: I tell them they ought to give thanks for that which is  paid for already, knowing that neither the meat, nor the mouth, nor  the man, are of his own making: I bid them fill their bellies, not  their eyes, and rise from the board, not glutted, but only satisfied,  and charge them to have a care that their guts be no hindrances to  their brains or hands, and that they should not lose themselves in  their feasts, but bid them be soberly merry, and wisely free. I also  advise them to get friendly Thrift to be there Caterer, and Temperance  to carve at the board, and be very watchful that obscenity, detraction  and scurrility be banisht the table; but let their discourse be as  savoury as the meat, and so feed as though they did live to eat, and,  at last, rise as full of thankfulness, as of food; this hath, this is,  and this shall be my continual practice.    \"Now, concerning the particulars that these folks charge me with, I  cannot answer them, because I do not remember them; my memory is but  weak, as old men's use to be; but, methinks, they seem to be the seed  of the Dragon; they send forth of their mouths whole floods of impious  inventions against me, and lay to my charge things which I am not  guilty of, which hath caused some of my friends to forsake me, and  look upon me as a stranger: my brother _Good-works_ broke his heart  when he heard on it, my sister _Charity_ was taken with the  Numb-palsie, so that she cannot stretch out her hand....\"    Counsel was heard for him as well as witnesses examined on his behalf,  and the Jury \"brought him in, _Not Guilty_, with their own judgement  upon it. That he who would not fully celebrate _Christmas_ should  forfeit his estate. The Judge being a man of old integrity, was very  well pleased, and _Christmas_ was released with a great deal of  triumph and exaltation.\"          CHAPTER VI         Commencement of Christ-tide--\"O Sapientia!\"--St. Thomas's       Day--William the Conqueror and the City of York--Providing       for Christmas fare--Charities of       food--Bull-baiting--Christ-tide charities--Going       \"a-Thomassing,\" etc.--Superstitions of the day.      We take it for granted that in the old times, when Christ-tide was  considered so great a festival as to be accorded a Novena--that it  began on the 16th December, when, according to the use of Sarum, the  antiphon \"O Sapientia,\" is sung. This, as before stated, is pointed  out plainly in our English Church Calendar, which led to a curious  mistake on the part of Dr. Ellicott, Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol,  who on one occasion described it as the _Festival_ of \"O Sapientia.\"  The other antiphons which are sung between the 16th December and  Christmas Eve are \"O Adonai,\" \"O Radix Jesu,\" \"O Clavis David,\" \"O  Oriens Splendor,\" \"O Rex Gentium,\" and \"O Emmanuel,\" and they are  commonly called the O's.    But, beyond its being lawful to eat mince pies on the 16th December, I  know of nothing noteworthy on the days intervening between that date  and the festival of St. Thomas on the 21st December, which is, or was,  celebrated in different parts of the country, with some very curious  customs. The earliest I can find of these is noted by Drake in his  _Eboracum_,[16] and he says he took the account from a MS. which came  into his possession.    [Footnote 16: Ed. 1736, p. 217.]    \"William the Conqueror, on the third year of his reign (on St.  Thomas's Day), laid siege to the City of York; but, finding himself  unable, either by policy or strength, to gain it, raised the siege,  which he had no sooner done but by accident he met with two fryers at  a place"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19980"],[0,"A Joy For Ever (and Its Price in the Market) (#10)"],[1,"wholly on the quantity of attention and  energy of mind you can bring to bear upon it. Now, that attention and  energy depend much more on the freshness of the thing than you would at  all suppose; unless you very carefully studied the movements of your own  minds. If you see things of the same kind and of equal value very  frequently, your reverence for them is infallibly diminished, your  powers of attention get gradually wearied, and your interest and  enthusiasm worn out; and you cannot in that state bring to any given  work the energy necessary to enjoy it. If, indeed, the question were  only between enjoying a great many pictures each a little, or one  picture very much, the sum of enjoyment being in each case the same, you  might rationally desire to possess rather the larger quantity than the  small; both because one work of art always in some sort illustrates  another, and because quantity diminishes the chances of destruction.      64. But the question is not a merely arithmetical one of this kind. Your  fragments of broken admirations will not, when they are put together,  make up one whole admiration; two and two, in this case, do not make  four, nor anything like four. Your good picture, or book, or work of art  of any kind, is always in some degree fenced and closed about with  difficulty. You may think of it as of a kind of cocoanut, with very  often rather an unseemly shell, but good milk and kernel inside. Now, if  you possess twenty cocoanuts, and being thirsty, go impatiently from one  to the other, giving only a single scratch with the point of your knife  to the shell of each, you will get no milk from all the twenty. But if  you leave nineteen of them alone, and give twenty cuts to the shell of  one, you will get through it, and at the milk of it. And the tendency of  the human mind is always to get tired before it has made its twenty  cuts; and to try another nut: and moreover, even if it has perseverance  enough to crack its nuts, it is sure to try to eat too many, and to  choke itself. Hence, it is wisely appointed for us that few of the  things we desire can be had without considerable labour, and at  considerable intervals of time. We cannot generally get our dinner  without working for it, and that gives us appetite for it, we cannot get  our holiday without waiting for it, and that gives us zest for it; and  we ought not to get our picture without paying for it, and that gives us  a mind to look at it.      65. Nay, I will even go so far as to say that we ought not to get books  too cheaply. No book, I believe, is ever worth half so much to its  reader as one that has been coveted for a year at a bookstall, and  bought out of saved halfpence; and perhaps a day or two's fasting.  That's the way to get at the cream of a book. And I should say more on  this matter, and protest as energetically as I could against the plague  of cheap literature, with which we are just now afflicted, but that I  fear your calling me to order, as being unpractical, because I don't  quite see my way at present to making everybody fast for their books.  But one may see that a thing is desirable and possible, even though one  may not at once know the best way to it,--and in my island of Barataria,  when I get it well into order, I assure you no book shall be sold for  less than a pound sterling; if it can be published cheaper than that,  the surplus shall all go into my treasury, and save my subjects taxation  in other directions; only people really poor, who cannot pay the pound,  shall be supplied with the books they want for nothing, in a certain  limited quantity. I haven't made up my mind about the number yet, and  there are several other points in the system yet unsettled; when they  are all determined, if you will allow me, I will come and give you  another lecture, on the political economy of literature.[10]    [Note 10: See note 6th, in Addenda.]      66. Meantime, returning to our immediate subject, I say to my generous  hearers, who want to shower Titians and Turners upon us, like falling  leaves, \"Pictures ought not to be too cheap;\" but in much stronger tone  I would say to those who want to keep up the prices of pictorial  property, that pictures ought not to be too dear--that is to say, not as  dear as they are. For, as matters at present stand, it is wholly  impossible for any man in the ordinary circumstances of English life to  possess himself of a piece of great art. A modern drawing of average  merit, or a first-class engraving, may, perhaps, not without some  self-reproach, be purchased out of his savings by a man of narrow  income; but a satisfactory example of first-rate art--masterhands'  work--is wholly out of his reach. And we are so accustomed to look upon  this as the natural course and necessity of things, that we never set  ourselves in any wise to diminish the evil; and yet it is an evil  perfectly capable of diminution.      67. It is an evil precisely similar in kind to that which existed in the  Middle Ages, respecting good books, and which everybody then, I suppose,  thought as natural as we do now our small supply of good pictures. You  could not then study the work of a great historian, or great poet, any  more than you can now study that of a great painter, but at heavy cost.  If you wanted a book, you had to get it written out for you, or to write  it out for yourself. But printing came, and the poor man may read his  Dante and his Homer; and Dante and Homer are none the worse for that.  But it is only in literature that private persons of moderate fortune  can possess and study greatness: they can study at home no greatness in  art; and the object of that accumulation which we are at present aiming  at, as our third object in political economy, is to bring great art in  some degree within the reach of the multitude; and, both in larger and  more numerous galleries than we now possess, and by distribution,  according to his wealth and wish, in each man's home, to render the  influence of art somewhat correspondent in extent to that of literature.  Here, then, is the subtle balance which your economist has to strike: to  accumulate so much art as to be able to give the whole nation a supply  of it, according to its need, and yet to regulate its distribution so  that there shall be no glut of it, nor contempt.      68. A difficult balance, indeed, for us to hold, if it were left merely  to our skill to poise; but the just point between poverty and profusion  has been fixed for us accurately by the wise laws of Providence. If you  carefully watch for all the genius you can detect, apply it to good  service, and then reverently preserve what it produces, you will never  have too little art; and if, on the other hand, you never force an  artist to work hurriedly, for daily bread, nor imperfectly, because you  would rather have showy works than complete ones, you will never have  too much. Do not force the multiplication of art, and you will not have  it too cheap; do not wantonly destroy it, and you will not have it too  dear.      69. \"But who wantonly destroys it?\" you will ask. Why, we all do.  Perhaps you thought, when I came to this part of our subject,  corresponding to that set forth in our housewife's economy by the  \"keeping her embroidery from the moth,\" that I was going to tell you  only how to take better care of pictures, how to clean them, and varnish  them, and where to put them away safely when you went out of town. Ah,  not at all. The utmost I have to ask of you is, that you will not pull  them to pieces, and trample them under your feet. \"What!\" you will say,  \"when do we do such things? Haven't we built a perfectly beautiful  gallery for all the pictures we have to take care of?\" Yes, you have,  for the pictures which are definitely sent to Manchester to be taken  care of. But there are quantities of pictures out of Manchester which it  is your business, and mine too, to take care of no less than of these,  and which we are at this moment employing ourselves in pulling to pieces  by deputy. I will tell you what they are, and where they are, in a  minute; only first let me state one more of those main principles of  political economy on which the matter hinges.      70. I must begin a little apparently wide of the mark, and ask you to  reflect if there is any way in which we waste money more in England than  in building fine tombs? Our respect for the dead, when they are _just_  dead, is something wonderful, and the way we show it more wonderful  still. We show it with black feathers and black horses; we show it with  black dresses and bright heraldries; we show it with costly obelisks and  sculptures of sorrow, which spoil half of our most beautiful cathedrals.  We show it with frightful gratings and vaults, and lids of dismal stone,  in the midst of the quiet grass; and last, and not least, we show it by  permitting ourselves to tell any number of lies we think amiable or  credible, in the epitaph. This feeling is common to the poor as well as  the rich; and we all know how many a poor family will nearly ruin  themselves, to testify their respect for some member of it in his  coffin, whom they never much cared for when he was out of it; and how  often it happens that a poor old woman will starve herself to death, in  order that she may be respectably buried.      71. Now, this being one of the most complete and special ways of wasting  money,--no money being less productive of good, or of any percentage  whatever, than that which we shake away from the ends of undertakers'  plumes,--it is of course the duty of all good economists, and kind  persons, to prove and proclaim continually, to the poor as well as the  rich, that respect for the dead is not really shown by laying great  stones on them to tell us where they are laid; but by remembering where  they are laid, without a stone to help us; trusting them to the sacred  grass and saddened flowers;"]]]
