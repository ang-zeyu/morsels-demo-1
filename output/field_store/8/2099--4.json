This _is_ a river.\"    And really Jack had an idea that he had tumbled upon a stream whose  waters were wine-like in their flavour; and but for a few words of  warning he would have gone on drinking more deeply still.    \"Thank goodness!\" cried Mr Rogers, as soon as he could gain his breath.  \"But what an escape!  The waggon nearly went over.  Where is that  scoundrel of a Zulu?  Oh there you are,\" he cried excitedly.  \"How dared  you touch the oxen, sir!  Your mad folly nearly spoiled our journey.\"    The General looked back at Mr Rogers, drawing himself up in savage  pride, and his eyes seemed to flash in the darkness; but he did not  speak, only turned away with a dignified look of displeasure.    \"I know why he did it, father,\" cried Dick, excitedly.  \"Look, don't you  see?  The ground slopes down here to the water.  Up there it's all rock,  and the team would have gone over a precipice.  See, it's twenty feet  deep.\"    \"Of course!  To be sure!\" cried Mr Rogers eagerly.  \"His keen sight  showed him the danger.  I beg your pardon, my man,\" he cried, \"I did not  know the reason, and ought not to have acted and spoken so rashly.\"    He held out his hand to the stern scowling Zulu, as he spoke; but for a  moment the savage hot blood that had been roused by his leader's  injustice refused to be tamed down, and he remained with his arms  folded; but glancing at Dick's eager countenance, and recalling how it  was due to him that the real truth of his actions was made known, the  General let his better feelings prevail, and snatching Mr Rogers' hand  in his, he held it for a moment to his broad breast, and then let it  fall.    \"Why you saved the waggon,\" said Mr Rogers, after walking to the edge  of the sudden descent where the rock went down sheer to the water, which  bubbled and foamed against its side.    \"Yes; all gone over together,\" said the General quietly.  \"Now all go  across.\"    \"But is it wise--is it safe--to attempt to cross to-night?\" said Mr  Rogers.    \"Will see,\" replied the General; and going down into the water, he  walked straight out past the heads of the oxen, literally disappearing  into the darkness as he waded on.    \"Isn't he very brave to do that, father?\" asked Jack, who had watched  the Zulu go from where they stood by the hind part of the waggon, whose  back wheels were on the dry sand.    \"Coffee no 'fraid to go,\" said that young gentleman.    \"Chicory go too after father,\" said his brother; and the two boys dashed  into the rushing water past the oxen, and then disappeared.    \"What madness!\" said Mr Rogers.  \"Why the stream runs swiftly enough  for them to be swept away.\"    Both Jack and Dick gazed eagerly out over the swift river; but the black  figures of the young Zulus seemed to disappear in the darkness, and for  some few minutes there was an excited pang while they listened to the  bubbling of the water against the fore wheels of the waggon, or the  plashing made by the oxen as they lazily moved their legs, apparently  enjoying the pleasant coolness of the water after their toilsome march.    \"I ought not to have allowed them to go,\" said Mr Rogers suddenly.  \"Here, Dinny, bring me the bay.  I'll mount, and try and ride over to  their help.\"    \"Bring the what, sor?\" said Dinny.    \"The bay,\" cried Mr Rogers.  \"Quick, man! quick!\"    \"An' how'll I be getting at him, sor?\" said Dinny.  \"Sure he's standing  out there in the wather catching cowld, and I couldn't reach him widout  getting very wet.\"    \"Why you did wade in to drink,\" cried Jack, indignantly.    And with a rush and a splash he ran into the water, to where he could  dimly make out the form of the big bay; and catching it by the halter,  he drew it after him, the rest of the thirst-quenched horses coming  _plash_! _plash_! out of the water, and following the bay like so many  sheep.    Mr Rogers was about to mount, when the General's voice was heard  hailing Peter and Dirk; and directly after their hearts were set at rest  about Coffee and Chicory, who could be heard laughing in the darkness.    \"All shallow water,\" cried the General.  \"Trek, Peter; trek, Dirk.  Good  place all across.\"    Mr Rogers hesitated as to the advisability of crossing in the darkness;  but the oxen were already in, the waggon was also nearly in the river,  and if allowed to stay for a few hours it would probably sink deeply in  the sand.  So, leaving his men to pursue their own course, he also waded  in, while Dirk cracked his whip, Peter mounted on to the box and  followed suit, and Klipmann, the black bullock, headed on into the  stream.  The shadowy-looking team could be dimly seen to straighten out;  there was a heavy pull at the waggon, and another, and another, before  its fore wheels were extricated from the sand in which they were sinking  fast, showing the wisdom of at once proceeding; and then, _plash_!  _plash_! and with the water rushing against them, the party began to  cross.    \"My! how strong the current is,\" cried Jack.    \"Take hold of the waggon, my boy,\" said Mr Rogers.    But as the water did not come up to his waist, Jack did not mind.  And  so the heavy load was dragged slowly through the stream.    \"I say, Jack,\" said Dick, suddenly, just as they started, \"there are  crocodiles in these rivers, ain't there?\"    \"Oh, murther!\" ejaculated Dinny, who had gone into the water very  unwillingly, and had wanted to ride, but Mr Rogers had refused to have  the waggon loaded any more, preferring himself to walk.    Then there was a rush and a splash, that passed unnoticed in the bustle  of crossing; and at the end of ten minutes, by the General's guidance  the team was led to a gentle slope, which they easily mounted, and  dragged the dripping waggon forth on to a level grassy plain.    The horses had followed, to stand about snorting and stamping, fresh and  bright with their bathe; and it was now determined, dark as it was, to  trek on for a couple of miles to a rich grassy spot that the General  said was ahead, and would be a good place for outspanning and camp, when  a dismal yell was heard from the farther shore.    \"What's that?\" exclaimed Mr Rogers.    But no one answered.    \"Some one must be in the river,\" cried Dick, excitedly.  \"Where's  Coffee?\"    \"Here Coffee,\" cried the Zulu boy, who had quite accepted his name.    \"Then who is it?\" said Jack, looking round in the darkness.  \"Here's  Chicory.\"    \"Why, it's Dinny,\" cried Dick.  \"Ahoy!  Dinny!\"    \"Ahoy!  Help now, Masther Dick, sor,\" came from some distance off.    \"The poor fellow is being swept down the river,\" exclaimed Mr Rogers,  leaping on the bay to ford or swim down to the drowning man.  \"Dinny!  Shout, man!  Where are you?\" he cried.    \"Sure, I'm here.  How'll I get over at all?\" came back.    \"What!  Are you ashore?\" cried Mr Rogers.    \"Yis, sor.\"    \"Then wade across, man.  It isn't deep.\"    \"Sure, sor, and I daren't.\"    \"Dare not!\" cried Jack.  \"Why we did.\"    \"Yis, sor; but a great baste of a thing laid howlt o' me, and I had to  go back.\"    \"Are there any crocodiles here?\" said Mr Rogers, to the Zulu.    \"No, boss; no crocodile.  All in Limpopo river.\"    \"I thought so.  Here, Dinny.\"    \"Yis, sor.\"    \"Come across directly, man!  There's nothing to be afraid of!\"    \"Sure, sor, I'm not afraid a bit!\" yelled Dinny.    \"Then come over.\"    \"If I did, sor, the crockydiles would be aiting me, and thin what would  you do?\"    \"Let me fetch him, father,\" cried Jack.  \"I'll wade over.\"    \"No, let me,\" said Dick.  \"I'm not afraid.\"    \"I don't think a second wetting will do either of you any good,\" replied  their father.  \"Here, Dick, take the bay and go across, and make the  stupid fellow hold on by your stirrup-leather.  Take care to go  straight.\"    \"Help.  What'll I do now?  Are ye going to lave me?\" cried Dinny, in  piteous tones.    \"He really deserves to be left,\" said Mr Rogers.  \"We shall have to  cure him of this cowardice.  Go on, Dick.\"    Dick leaped into the saddle, touched the willing bay's sides, and the  horse began to ford the rapid stream, hesitating just a trifle as they  reached the middle, where the current pressed most hardly against his  flanks; but keeping steadily on till he was safe across.    \"Ah, Masther Dick, dear!\" whined Dinny.  \"An' it's you, thin?\"    \"Yes, it's me, my brave Irish boy!\" said Dick.    \"An' ye didn't bring another of the horses for me, sor?\"    \"No, Dinny, I didn't,\" replied Dick, smiling at the other's cowardice.  \"My father said you were to hold on by the stirrup-leather.\"    \"What, and walk acrost?\"    \"To be sure.\"    \"Saints alive!  I daren't do it, Masther Dick, dear.  Sure the bottom of  the say--I mane the river--there's paved wid crockydiles; an' every step  I took I could feel them heaving up under me.\"    \"What, as you were going across, Dinny?\"    \"Yis, sor.  Not as I minded as long as they kep' quiet; but whin one  hungry baste laid howlt toight o' me trousers, and scratched me leg wid  his ugly teeth, I felt that it was time to be off back, and I jist  escaped.\"    \"Hoi, there, Dick!  Look sharp!\"    \"Coming!\" roared Dick.  \"Now then, Dinny.  There are no crocodivils  here.\"    \"Hark at him now!\" cried Dinny.  \"Why the river swarms wid 'em.  Did  they ate the black boys?\"    \"No, of course not.  What nonsense!  Come, catch hold, and let's go.\"    \"Masther Dick, dear, I've a mother at home in the owld country, and if  anything was to happen to me, she'd never forgive the masther.\"    \"Catch hold, Dinny.  I tell you there's nothing to fear.\"    \"Sure, Masther Dick, dear, an' I'm not afraid--not the laste bit in the  worrld; but I couldn't go across there to-night.  Wouldn't ye fetch one  of the horses, Masther Dick?\"    \"No,\" cried Dick impatiently.  \"I couldn't do that.

He was ready to kill or  to take the chances of being killed, but he had no more hate apparently  for the wild men than for the wild beasts he hunted.          VII. THE RENEGADES.    Simon Girty, who tried so hard to save Kenton's life at Wapatimika, was  the most notorious of those white renegades who abounded in the Ohio  country during the Indian wars. The life of the border was often such  as to make men desperate and cruel, and the life of the wilderness had  a fascination which their fierce natures could hardly resist. Kenton  himself, as we have seen, might perhaps have willingly remained with the  Indians if they had wished him to be one of them, though he was at heart  too kindly and loyal ever to have become the enemy of his own people,  and if he had been adopted into an Indian family he would probably have  been such an Indian as Smith was. But in the sort of backwoodsman he  had been there was such stuff as renegades were made of. Like him these  desperadoes had mostly fled from the settlements after some violent  deed, and could not have gone back to their homes there if they would.  Yet they were not much worse than the traders who came and went among  the Indians in times of peace, and supplied them with the weapons and  the ammunition they might use at any moment against the settlers.    Indeed, wherever the two races touched they seemed to get all of each  other's vices, and very few of each other's virtues; and it is doubtful  if the law breakers who escaped from the borders to the woods were more  ferocious than many whom they left behind. Neither side showed mercy;  their warfare was to the death; the white men tomahawked and scalped  the wounded as the red men did, and if the settlers were not always  so pitiless to their prisoners or to the wives and children of their  warriors, they were guilty of many acts of murderous treachery and  murderous fury. One of the best and truest friends they ever had, the  great Mingo chief Logan, who was at last the means of Kenton's escape  from the stake, bore witness to these facts in his famous speech; for in  spite of his friendship for the whites, he had suffered the worst  that they could do to the worst of their foes. When such white men as  butchered Logan's kindred sided with the Indians, they only changed  their cause; their savage natures remained unchanged; but very few of  these, even, seem to have been so far trusted in their fear and hate for  their own people as to be taken by the Indians in their forays against  the whites.    The great Miami chief Little Turtle, who outgeneralled the Americans at  the defeat of St. Clair, used to tell with humorous relish how he once  trusted a white man adopted into his tribe. This white man was very  eager to go with him on a raid into Kentucky, and when they were  stealing upon the cabin they were going to attack, nothing could  restrain his desire to be foremost. When they got within a few yards, he  suddenly dashed forward with a yell of \"Indians, Indians!\" and left his  red brethren to get out of the range of the settlers' rifles as fast as  they could.    But Simon Girty led many of the savage attacks, and showed himself the  relentless enemy of the American cause at every chance, though more than  once he used his power with the Indians to save prisoners from torture  and death. He was born in Pennsylvania, and he was captured with his  brothers, George and James, during Braddock's campaign. They were all  taken to Ohio, where George was adopted by the Delawares, James by the  Shawnees, and Simon by the Senecas. George died a drunken savage; James  became the terror of the Kentucky border, and infamous throughout the  West by his cruelty to the women among the Indians' captives; he seems  to have been without one touch of pity for the fate of any of their  prisoners, and his cruelties were often charged upon Simon, who had  enough of his own to answer for. Yet he seems to have been the best as  well as the ablest of the three brothers whose name is the blackest in  Ohio history. Many of the stories about him are evidently mere romance,  and they often conflict. As he was captured when very young, he never  learned to read or write; and it is said that he was persuaded by worse  and wiser men to take sides with the British in the Revolution. But  we need not believe that he was so ignorant or so simple as this in  accounting for his preference of his red brethren and their cause.  In fact, several letters attributed to him exist, though he may have  dictated these, and may not have known how to write after all.    It is certain that he was a man of great note and power among the  Indians, and one of their most trusted captains. He led the attack on  Wheeling in 1777, where he demanded the surrender of the fort to the  English king, whose officer he boasted himself. In 1782 he attacked  Bryan's Station in Kentucky with a strong force of Indians, but met with  such a gallant resistance that he attempted to bring the garrison  to terms by telling them who he was and threatening them with the  reenforcements and the cannon which he said he expected hourly. He  promised that all their lives should be spared if they yielded, but  while he waited with the white flag in his hand on the stump where he  stood to harangue them, a young man answered him from the fort: \"You  need not be so particular to tell us your name; we know your name and  you, too. I've had a villainous untrustworthy cur dog this long while  named Simon Girty, in compliment to you, he's so like you, just as ugly  and just as wicked. As to the cannon, let them come on; the country's  aroused, and the scalps of your red cutthroats, and your own too, will  be drying in our cabins in twenty-four hours; and if, by chance, you or  your allies do get into the fort, we've a big store of rods laid in to  scourge you out again.\"    [Illustration: Simon Girty 079L]    The Indians retreated, but Girty glutted his revenge for the failure and  the insult in many a fight afterwards with the Americans and in many a  scene of torture and death. The Kentuckians now followed his force to  the Blue Licks, where the Indians ambushed them and beat them back with  fearful slaughter.    Girty remained with the savages and took part in the war which they  carried on against our people long after our peace with the British. He  was at the terrible defeat of St. Clair in 1791, and he had been present  at the burning of Colonel Crawford in 1782. By some he is said to have  tried to beg and to buy their prisoner off from the Wyandots, and by  others to have taken part in mocking his agonies, if not in torturing  him. It seems certain that he lived to be a very old man, and it is  probable that he died fighting the Americans in our second war with  Great Britain.    But the twilight of the forest rests upon most of the details of his  history and the traits of his character. The truth about him seems to  be that he had really become a savage, and it would not be strange if he  felt all the ferocity of a savage, together with the rare and capricious  emotions of pity and generosity which are apt to visit the savage heart.  There have always been good Indians and bad Indians, and Simon Girty was  simply a bad Indian.          VIII. THE WICKEDEST DEED IN OUR HISTORY.    The Indians despised the white men for what they thought their stupidity  in warfare, when they stood up in the open to be shot at, as the  soldiers who were sent against them mostly did, instead of taking  to trees and hiding in tall grass and hollows of the ground, as the  backwoodsmen learned to do. Smith tells us that when Tecaughretanego  heard how Colonel Grant, in the second campaign against Fort Duquesne,  outwitted the French and Indians by night and stole possession of a hill  overlooking the post, he praised his craft as that of a true warrior;  but as to his letting his pipers play at daybreak, and give the enemy  notice of his presence, so that the Indians could take to trees and  shoot his Highlanders down with no danger to themselves, he could only  suppose that Colonel Grant had got drunk over night.    The savages respected the whites when they showed cunning, and they did  not hate them the more for not showing mercy in fight; but we have seen  how fiercely they resented the crime of horse stealing in Kenton's case,  though they were always stealing horses themselves from the settlers;  and any deed of treachery against themselves they were eager and prompt  to punish, though they were always doing such deeds against their  enemies. Still, it is doubtful whether with all their malignity they  were ever guilty of anything so abominable as the massacre of the  Christian Indians at Gnadenhutten, by the Americans; and if there is  record of any wickeder act in the history not only of Ohio, but of the  whole United States, I do not know of it. The Spaniards may have outdone  it in some of their dealings with the Indians, but I cannot call to mind  any act of theirs that seems so black, so wholly without justice and  without reason. It is no wonder that it embittered the hostilities  between the red men and the white men and made the war, which outlasted  our Revolution ten years, more and more unmerciful to the very end.    The missionaries of the Moravian Church were more successful than any  others in converting the Indians, perhaps because they asked the most of  them. They made them give up all the vices which the Indians knew were  vices, and all the vices that the Indians thought were virtues when  practiced outside of their tribe. They forbade them to lie, to steal, to  kill; they taught them to wash themselves, to put on clothes, to work,  and to earn their bread. Upon these hard terms they had congregations  and villages in several parts of Connecticut, New York, and  Pennsylvania, which flourished for a time against the malice of the  disorderly and lawless settlers around"]]]
