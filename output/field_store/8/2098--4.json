Now, then, try to believe that I am acting for the best.\"    \"And you will not be so stern with him?\"    \"As far as my lights will illumine me, I will do what is right by my  sister's boy, Laura--the lad I want to see grow up into a  straightforward Englishman, proud of his name.  There, can I say more  fairly than that?\"    \"No.  I only beg that you will think of Lindon as a high-spirited boy,  who, though he does not always do as you wish, is still extremely  sensitive.\"    \"Proud and stubborn, eh, Laura?\"    \"I will say no more, my own brother, only leave myself in your hands.\"    \"Yes, you may well look at the clock,\" said Uncle Josiah, laughing, as  he put his arm round his sister, and kissed her very tenderly; \"the  young dog is unconscionably late.\"    \"You do not think--after what I said?\"    \"Think?  Nonsense.  No, no.  Lindon is too manly for that.  Here, I am  sure that you have a terrible headache, and you are worn out.  Go to  bed, and I'll sit up for the young rascal, and have a talk to him when  he comes in.\"    \"No, no!\" exclaimed Mrs Lavington excitedly; \"I do not like you to sit  up for him.  I will.\"    \"Not you.  Too tired out as it is.  No, my dear, you shall go to bed,  and I will sit up for him.\"    \"Then let neither of us sit up.\"    \"Afraid I shall scold him, eh?\"    \"I cannot help being afraid of something of the kind, dear.\"    \"Very well, then we will both go, and let Jessie sit up.\"    The maid was rung for, and entered.    \"We are going to bed, Jessie.  Master Lindon has not returned yet.  You  will sit up until he comes in.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    The maid left the room, and brother and sister sat looking at each  other.    \"Did you speak, Josiah?\" said Mrs Lavington.    \"No; I was only thinking that I do not trust you and you don't trust  me.\"    \"What do you mean?\" faltered the poor woman, who looked more agitated  now.    \"You were not going to bed, but to listen for Lindon's return, and were  then going to watch whether I left my room to talk to him.\"    Mrs Lavington was silent.    \"Guilty,\" said Uncle Josiah, smiling.  \"Come now, fair play.  Will you  go to your room and promise to stay there till breakfast time to-morrow  morning, if I give you my word to do the same?\"    \"Yes,\" said the shrinking woman eagerly.    \"That's agreed to, then.  Good-night, Laura, my dear.\"    \"Good-night, Josiah.\"    Ten minutes after all was still in the house, but matters did not turn  out quite as Uncle Josiah intended.  For before he was undressed, a  bedroom door was opened very gently, and the creak it gave produced a  low ejaculation of dismay.    Then there was five minutes' interval before a slight little figure  stole gently downstairs and glided into the kitchen, where round  red-faced Jessie was seated in a window, her chair being opposite to  what looked like a lady's back, making the most careful bows from time  to time, to which the lady made no response, for it was only Jessie's  cloak hanging on a peg with her old bonnet just above.    The slight little figure stood in the kitchen doorway listening, and  then Jessie seemed to be bowing her head to the fresh comer, who did  take some notice of the courtesy, for, crossing the kitchen rapidly,  there was a quick sharp whisper.    \"Jessie, Jessie!\"    No reply.    \"Jessie, Jessie!\"    \"Two new and one stale,\" said the maid.    \"Oh, how tiresome!  Jessie, Jessie!\"    \"Slack baked.\"    \"Jessie!\" and this time there was a shake of the maid's shoulder, and  she jumped up, looking startled.    \"Lor, Miss Kitty, how you frightened me!\"    \"You were asleep.\"    \"Sleep?  Me, miss?  That I'm sure I wasn't.\"    \"You were, Jessie, and I heard father tell you to sit up till Cousin  Lindon came home.\"    \"Well, that's what I'm a-doin' of, miss, as plain as I can,\" said  Jessie.    She spoke in an ill-used tone, for it had been a busy day consequent  upon a certain amount of extra cleaning, but Kitty did not notice it.    \"I shall stay till I hear my cousin's knock,\" she said; \"and then run  upstairs.  I hope he will not be long.\"    \"So do I, Miss Kitty,\" said the woman with a yawn.  \"What's made him so  late?  Is it because of the trouble at the yard?\"    \"Yes, Jessie; but you must not talk about it.\"    \"But I heerd as Master Don took some money.\"    \"He did not, Jessie!\" cried Kitty indignantly.  \"There isn't a word of  truth in it.  My Cousin Lindon couldn't have done such a thing.  It's  all a mistake, and I want to see him come in, poor boy, and tell him  that I don't believe it I'll whisper it to him just as he's going up to  bed, and it will make him happy, for I know he thinks I have gone  against him, and I only made believe that I did.\"    _Snurrrg_!    The sound was very gentle, and Kitty did not hear it, for she was  looking intently toward the door in the belief that she had heard Don's  footstep.    But it was only that of some passer on his way home, and Kitty went  on,--    \"You mustn't talk about it, Jessie, for it is a great trouble, and aunt  is nearly heart-broken, and--\"    _Snurg-urg_!    This time there was so loud and gurgling a sound that Kitty turned  sharply upon the maid, who, after emitting a painful snore, made her  young mistress the most polite of bows.    \"Jessie!  You're asleep.\"    _Snurrg_!  And a bow.    \"Oh, Jessie, you're asleep again.  How can you be so tiresome?\"    _Snurrg_!  Gurgled Jessie again, and Kitty gave an impatient stamp of  her little foot.    \"How can any one sleep at a time like this?\" she half sobbed.  \"It's too  bad, that it is.\"    Jessie bowed to her politely, and her head went up and down as if it  were fixed at the end of a very easy moving spring, but when Kitty  reproached her the words had not the slightest effect, and a dull stupid  stare was given, of so irritating a nature that some people would have  felt disposed to awaken the sleeper by administering a sound slap upon  the hard round cheek.    One hour, two hours, three hours passed away, and still no Don; and at  last, unable to bear the company of the snoring woman longer, Kitty left  her and went into the drawing-room, where, kneeling down at the end of  the couch under the window, she remained watching the dark street,  waiting for him who did not come.    Kitty watched till the street began to look less dark and gloomy, and by  degrees the other side became so plain that she could make out the  bricks on the opposite walls.    Then they grew plainer and plainer, and there was a bright light in the  sky, for the sun was near to its rising.    Then they grew less plain, then quite indistinct, for Kitty was crying  bitterly, and she found herself wondering whether Don could have come in  and gone to bed.    A little thought told her that this was impossible, and the tears fell  faster still.    Where could he be?  What could he be doing?  Ought she to awaken her  aunt?    Kitty could not answer these self-imposed questions, and as her misery  and despair grew greater it seemed as if the morning was growing very  cold and the bricks of the houses opposite more and more obscure, and  then soon after they were quite invisible, for she saw them not.        CHAPTER NINE.    A SOCIAL THUNDERBOLT.    \"Morning!\" said Uncle Josiah, as, after a turn up and down the  dining-room, he saw the door open and his sister enter, looking very  pale and red-eyed.  \"Why, Laura, you have not been to bed.\"    \"Yes,\" she said sadly.  \"I kept my word, and now I feel sorry that I  did, for I fell into a heavy sleep from which I did not wake till half  an hour ago.\"    \"Glad of it,\" said her brother bluffly.  \"That's right, my dear, make  the tea; I want my breakfast, for I have plenty of work to-day.\"    Mrs Lavington hastily made the tea, for the urn was hissing on the  table when she came down, Uncle Josiah's orders being that it was always  to be ready at eight o'clock, and woe betide Jessie if it was not there.    \"Have--have you seen Don this morning?\"    \"No.  And when he comes down I shall not say a word.  There, try and put  a better face on the matter, my dear.  He will have to appear at the  magistrate's office, and there will be a few admonitions.  That's all.  Isn't Kitty late?\"    \"Yes.  Shall I send up for her?\"    \"No; she will be down in a few minutes, I daresay, and Lindon too.\"    The few minutes passed, and Uncle Josiah looked stern.  Then he rang for  the servants, and his brow grew more heavy.  Neither Kitty nor Lindon  down to prayers.    \"Shall I send up, Josiah?\"    \"No; they know what time we have prayers,\" said the old man sternly; and  upon the servants entering he read his customary chapter and the  prayers, but no one stole in while the service was in progress, and when  it was over the old merchant looked more severe than ever.    Mrs Lavington looked more troubled as her brother grew more severe, but  she did not speak, feeling that she might make matters worse.    Just then Jessie brought in the ham and eggs, and as she took off the  cover, and Mrs Lavington began to pour out tea, the old man said  roughly,--    \"Go and tell Miss Kitty to come down to breakfast directly.\"    The maid left the room.    \"You did not send a message to Don, Josiah.\"    \"No.  I suppose his lordship was very late.  No business to have gone  out.\"    Uncle Josiah began his breakfast.  Mrs Lavington could not taste hers.    Then Jessie entered, looking startled.    \"If you please, sir--\"    \"Well, if you please what?\"    \"Miss Kitty, sir.\"    \"Yes?\"    \"She's not in her room.\"    \"Eh?\" ejaculated the old merchant.  \"Humph!  Come down and gone for a  walk, I suppose.  Back soon.\"    The breakfast went on, but there was no Kitty, no Don, and Uncle Josiah  began to eat his food ferociously.    At last he got up and rang the bell sharply, and Jessie responded.    \"What time did Master Lindon come home?\" he said.    \"Come home, sir?\"    \"Yes; did I not speak plainly?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21324"],[0,"Recollections of Old Liverpool (#10)"],[1,"we were somewhat  laughed at for our extraordinary haste in coming to the conclusions we  did, we had nothing to be ashamed of.  We Liverpool men showed our pluck  on that and many other occasions during the French war.  I fear we were a  little too much alive.  We had too much pugnacity about us if anything.  I recollect some poor simple looking French fishermen in that year put  into Liverpool, in order to sell some oysters, when it was all once taken  for granted that they were spies, sent to ascertain what we were doing.  The mayor at a meeting held to consider the state of the  harbour-defences, actually alluded to these poor fishermen as having in  their possession the soundings and bearings of the harbour and  river-entrance.  I, for one, did not believe in their being spies, never  having seen such a lot of harmless, stupid-looking men.    About this period the press-gang was very actively engaged in taking men  for the navy.  These gangs were made up of the very worst and most  violent men in the service.  They were by no means particular whom they  took: to them a man was a man, and that was a sufficient reason for  securing him.  Cases of horrible cruelty and great hardship frequently  occurred to individuals.  Men were constantly torn from their homes,  wives, and families, without a moment's warning.  They disappeared and  were not heard of for years, or perhaps not at all.  There was a man I  knew who was seized in Pool-lane and hurried off to the tender, and was  not heard of for four years, when he returned suddenly as his wife was  about to be married for the third time since his departure.  His arrival,  with a good store of pay, and prize-money, was ample compensation for the  loss of the new husband.  Terrible rows took place between the  press-gangs and the sailor-men--the latter resisted to the very death any  attempt to capture them.  Blood was frequently shed, and loss of life was  not uncommon.  I recollect one murderous business with which I should  have been mixed up if I had not made my escape by running into a house in  Atherton-street.  The men used to get across the water to Cheshire to  hide until their ships were ready to sail.  Near Egremont, on the shore,  there used to be a little low public-house, known as \"Mother Redcap's,\"  from the fact of the owner always wearing a red hood or cap.  This  public-house is still standing.  I have often been in it.  At that time  there were no inner walls to divide the room on the upper floor; but only  a few screens put up of about seven or eight feet in height to form  apartments.  The roof was not latted or plastered.  When I last saw it,  some twenty-five years or more ago, the joists and timbers were all open  to view.  Mother Redcap was a great favourite with the sailor-men and had  their entire confidence.  She had hiding-places for any number, and the  men used, on returning from their voyages, to deposit with her their pay  and prize-money, until they wanted it.  It was known, or at least, very  commonly believed, that Mother Redcap had in her possession enormous (for  her) sums of money, hidden or put away somewhere; but where that  somewhere was, it was never known; for, at her death, very little  property was found in her possession, although only a few days before she  was taken ill and died, a rich prize was brought into Liverpool which  yielded every sailor on board at least a thousand pounds.  Mother  Redcap's was swarming with sailors belonging to the privateer, directly  after the vessel had come into port, and it was known that the old lady  had received a good deal of the prize-money on their account, yet none of  it was ever discovered.  It is a very remarkable circumstance that some  few years ago, I think about ten or twelve, but I forget exactly when, a  quantity of money in spade-ace guineas was found in a cavity by the  shore, not far from Mother Redcap's.  It has always been a firm belief  with me that some day a rich harvest will be in store for somebody--a  case of treasure trove like that which some years ago was known as \"the  Cuerdly Find.\"  Mother Redcap's was the resort of many a rough,  hard-hunted fellow, and many a strange story has been told, and scene  enacted, under the old roof.    The passage of the river then and at the beginning of the last century,  until steam-boats were introduced, was a complete and serious voyage,  which few undertook.  The boatmen used to run their boats at one time on  the beach opposite the end of Water-street and ply for hire.  After the  piers were ran out they hooked on at the steps calling aloud, \"Woodside,  ahoy!\" \"Seacombe, ahoy!\" and so on.  It is a fact that thousands of  Liverpool people at that time never were in Cheshire in their lives.  We  used to cross in open or half-decked boats, and sometimes we have been  almost as many hours in crossing as we are now minutes.  I recollect once  wanting to go to Woodside on a stormy day, to see a man who lived in a  small house between the Ferry-house and Wallasey Pool, and which, by the  way, was the only house then standing thereabout.  The tide was running  very strong and the wind blowing hard, and, after nearly four hours hard  work, we managed to land near the Rock Perch, thankful for our lives  being spared.  The Rock Perch was a pole with a sort of beacon or basket  at the top of it, implanted in the rocks on which the lighthouse now  stands.  There were no houses then anywhere about what is now called New  Brighton.  The country was sandy and barren, and the only trees that  existed grew close to the mouth of the river near the shore.  There was  scarcely a house between the Rock and Wallasey.  Wirrall at that time and  the middle of the last century was a desperate region.  The inhabitants  were nearly all wreckers or smugglers--they ostensibly carried on the  trade and calling of fishermen, farm-labourers, and small farmers; but  they were deeply saturated with the sin of covetousness, and many a  fierce fire has been lighted on the Wirrall shore on stormy nights to  lure the good ship on the Burbo or Hoyle Banks, there to beat, and  strain, and throb, until her timbers parted, and her planks were floating  in confusion on the stormy waves.  Fine times, then, for the Cheshire  men.  On stormy days and nights, crowds might have been seen hurrying to  the shore with carts, barrows, horses, asses, and oxen even, which were  made to draw timber, bales, boxes, or anything that the raging waters  might have cast up.  Many a half-drowned sailor has had a knock on the  sconce whilst trying to obtain a footing, that has sent him reeling back  into the seething water, and many a house has been suddenly replenished  with eatables and drinkables, and furniture and garniture, where  previously bare walls and wretched accommodation only were visible.  Then  for smuggling--fine times the runners used to have in my young days.  Scarcely a house in north Wirral that could not provide a guest with a  good stiff glass of brandy or Hollands.  The fishermen used to pretend to  cast their nets to take the fish that then abounded on our coasts, but  their fishing was of a far different sort.  Formby, on this side, was a  great place for smugglers and smuggling.  I don't think they wrecked as  the Cheshire people did--these latter were very fiends.  The Formby  fishermen were pretty honest and hardworking, and could always make a  good living by their calling, so that the smuggling they did was nothing  to be compared to their Cheshire compatriots.  Strings upon strings of  ponies have I seen coming along the road from Formby, laden with the  finny spoil.  The ponies had panniers slung over their backs, while  sometimes the fisherman's wife or child, if the horse could bear the  double burden, was seated between them.  These were called \"Formby  Trotters.\"  There were good fish caught in the river at that time; and I  have heard say that herrings used to be taken in great profusion in our  vicinity until the people fought at the Fish Stones by St. Nicholas's  Church wall, and blood was shed on the occasion.  Many a fisherman  steadfastly believed that the herrings then left the coast, and never  returned in consequence.  Wallasey was certainly, at one period, a great  place for the curing of herrings, as can be proved by tradition as well  as written history.    How well I recollect the Woodside Ferry when I was a boy.  There was a  long causeway at it, which ran into the river, formed of logs of wood and  large boulder stones.  Up this causeway you walked until you came to the  overhanging shore which on the left hand was cut away to admit the  causeway continuing up into the land.  There was a small thicket of trees  on the rock-top and a patch of garden which belonged to the ferryman.  The only house visible was a farm-house which stood on the spot where the  (Gough's) Woodside Hotel may now be found.  It had a garden enclosed by a  hedge round it.  The road to Bidston was a rough, rutted way, and the  land was for the most part marshy between Woodside and Bidston, and the  country looked very desolate, wild, and rugged.  There were some pretty  walks over the fields.  There was one from Holt Hill to Oxton which I was  very fond of.  When the weather was fine I have had many and many a  pleasant ramble over land where now houses show themselves in hundreds,  nay, thousands, and where I have gone bird-nesting, and picking wild  flowers, and mushrooming in their season.  Lord! what changes I have seen  and yet live to see; and I am very thankful for His mercies, which have  been manifold and abundant.  Wallasey Pool was a glorious piece of water  once, and many a good fish I have taken out of it in the upper waters.  The view of Birkenhead Priory was at one time very picturesque, before  they built the church near it and the houses round it.  I recollect when  there was not a dwelling near it.  It seemed to stand out well "]]]
