I. D.    NEW SCOTLAND YARD. S. W.          IX    THE MAN IN BLACK      Mrs. Brian started back, with a wild look, a trapped look, in her eyes.    \"What's he done?\" she inquired. \"What's he done? Tom's not done  anything!\"    \"Be good enough to waken him,\" persisted the inspector. \"I wish to speak  to him.\"    Mrs. Brian walked slowly from the room and could be heard entering one  further along the passage. An angry snarling, suggesting that of a wild  animal disturbed in its lair, proclaimed the arousing of Taximan Thomas  Brian. A thick voice inquired, brutally, why the sanguinary hell he (Mr.  Brian) had had his bloodstained slumbers disturbed in this gory manner  and who was the vermilion blighter responsible.    Then Mrs. Brian's voice mingled with that of her husband, and both  became subdued. Finally, a slim man, who wore a short beard, or had  omitted to shave for some days, appeared at the door of the living-room.  His face was another history upon the same subject as that which might  be studied from the walls, the floor, and the appointments of the room.  Inspector Dunbar perceived that the shadow of the neighboring hostelry  overlay this home.    \"What's up?\" inquired the new arrival.    The tone of his voice, thickened by excess, was yet eloquent of the  gentleman. The barriers passed, your pariah gentleman can be the  completest blackguard of them all. He spoke coarsely, and the infectious  Cockney accent showed itself in his vowels; but Dunbar, a trained  observer, summed up his man in a moment and acted accordingly.    \"Come in and shut the door!\" he directed. \"No\"--as Mrs. Brian sought to  enter behind her husband--\"I wish to speak with you, privately.\"    \"Hop it!\" instructed Brian, jerking his thumb over his shoulder--and  Mrs. Brian obediently disappeared, closing the door.    \"Now,\" said Dunbar, looking the man up and down, \"have you been into the  depot, to-day?\"    \"No.\"    \"But you have heard that there's an inquiry?\"    \"I've heard nothing. I've been in bed.\"    \"We won't argue about that. I'll simply put a question to you: Where  did you pick up the fare that you dropped at Palace Mansions at twelve  o'clock last night?\"    \"Palace Mansions!\" muttered Brian, shifting uneasily beneath the  unflinching stare of the tawny eyes. \"What d'you mean? What Palace  Mansions?\"    \"Don't quibble!\" warned Dunbar, thrusting out a finger at him. \"This is  not a matter of a loss of license; it's a life job!\"    \"Life job!\" whispered the man, and his weak face suddenly relaxed,  so that, oddly, the old refinement shone out through the new, vulgar  veneer.    \"Answer my questions straight and square and I'll take your word that  you have not seen the inquiry!\" said Dunbar.    \"Dick Hamper's done this for me!\" muttered Brian. \"He's a dirty, low  swine! Somebody'll do for him one night!\"    \"Leave Hamper out of the question,\" snapped Dunbar. \"You put down a fare  at Palace Mansions at twelve o'clock last night?\"    For one tremendous moment, Brian hesitated, but the good that was in  him, or the evil--a consciousness of wrongdoing, or of retribution  pending--respect for the law, or fear of its might--decided his course.    \"I did.\"    \"It was a man?\"    Again Brian, with furtive glance, sought to test his opponent; but his  opponent was too strong for him. With Dunbar's eyes upon his face, he  chose not to lie.    \"It was a woman.\"    \"How was she dressed?\"    \"In a fur motor-coat--civet fur.\"    The man of culture spoke in those two words, \"civet fur\"; and Dunbar  nodded quickly, his eyes ablaze at the importance of the evidence.    \"Was she alone?\"    \"She was.\"    \"What fare did she pay you?\"    \"The meter only registered eightpence, but she gave me half-a-crown.\"    \"Did she appear to be ill?\"    \"Very ill. She wore no hat, and I supposed her to be in evening dress.  She almost fell as she got out of the cab, but managed to get into  the hall of Palace Mansions quickly enough, looking behind her all the  time.\"    Inspector Dunbar shot out the hypnotic finger again.    \"She told you to wait!\" he asserted, positively. Brian looked to right  and left, up and down, thrusting his hands into his coat pockets, and  taking them out again to stroke his collarless neck. Then:--    \"She did--yes,\" he admitted.    \"But you were bribed to drive away? Don't deny it! Don't dare to trifle  with me, or by God! you'll spend the night in Brixton Jail!\"    \"It was made worth my while,\" muttered Brian, his voice beginning to  break, \"to hop it.\"    \"Who paid you to do it?\"    \"A man who had followed all the way in a big car.\"    \"That's it! Describe him!\"    \"I can't! No, no! you can threaten as much as you like, but I can't  describe him. I never saw his face. He stood behind me on the near side  of the cab, and just reached forward and pushed a flyer under my nose.\"    Inspector Dunbar searched the speaker's face closely--and concluded that  he was respecting the verity.    \"How was he dressed?\"    \"In black, and that's all I can tell you about him.\"    \"You took the money?\"    \"I took the money, yes\"...    \"What did he say to you?\"    \"Simply: 'Drive off.'\"    \"Did you take him to be an Englishman from his speech?\"    \"No; he was not an Englishman. He had a foreign accent.\"    \"French? German?\"    \"No,\" said Brian, looking up and meeting the glance of the fierce eyes.  \"Asiatic!\"    Inspector Dunbar, closely as he held himself in hand, started slightly.    \"Are you sure?\"    \"Certainly. Before I--when I was younger--I traveled in the East, and I  know the voice and intonation of the cultured Oriental.\"    \"Can you place him any closer than that?\"    \"No, I can't venture to do so.\" Brian's manner was becoming,  momentarily, more nearly that of a gentleman. \"I might be leading you  astray if I ventured a guess, but if you asked me to do so, I should say  he was a Chinaman.\"    \"A CHINAMAN?\" Dunbar's voice rose excitedly.    \"I think so.\"    \"What occurred next?\"    \"I turned my cab and drove off out of the Square.\"    \"Did you see where the man went?\"    \"I didn't. I saw nothing of him beyond his hand.\"    \"And his hand?\"    \"He wore a glove.\"    \"And now,\" said Dunbar, speaking very slowly, \"where did you pick up  your fare?\"    \"In Gillingham Street, near Victoria Station.\"    \"From a house?\"    \"Yes, from Nurse Proctor's.\"    \"Nurse Proctor's! Who is Nurse Proctor?\"    Brian shrugged his shoulders in a nonchalant manner, which obviously  belonged to an earlier phase of existence.    \"She keeps a nursing home,\" he said--\"for ladies.\"    \"Do you mean a maternity home?\"    \"Not exactly; at least I don't think so. Most of her clients are society  ladies, who stay there periodically.\"    \"What are you driving at?\" demanded Dunbar. \"I have asked you if it is a  maternity home.\"    \"And I have replied that it isn't. I am only giving you facts; you don't  want my surmises.\"    \"Who hailed you?\"    \"The woman did--the woman in the fur coat. I was just passing the door  very slowly when it was flung open with a bang, and she rushed out as  though hell were after her. Before I had time to pull up, she threw  herself into my cab and screamed: 'Palace Mansions! Westminster!' I  reached back and shut the door, and drove right away.\"    \"When did you see that you were followed?\"    \"We were held up just outside the music hall, and looking back, I saw  that my fare was dreadfully excited. It didn't take me long to find out  that the cause of her excitement was a big limousine, three or four back  in the block of traffic. The driver was some kind of an Oriental, too,  although I couldn't make him out very clearly.\"    \"Good!\" snapped Dunbar; \"that's important! But you saw nothing more of  this car?\"...    \"I saw it follow me into the Square.\"    \"Then where did it wait?\"    \"I don't know; I didn't see it again.\"    Inspector Dunbar nodded rapidly.    \"Have you ever driven women to or from this Nurse Proctor's before?\"    \"On two other occasions, I have driven ladies who came from there. I  knew they came from there, because it got about amongst us that the tall  woman in nurse's uniform who accompanied them was Nurse Proctor.\"    \"You mean that you didn't take these women actually from the door of the  house in Gillingham Street, but from somewhere adjacent?\"    \"Yes; they never take a cab from the door. They always walk to the  corner of the street with a nurse, and a porter belonging to the house  brings their luggage along.\"    \"The idea is secrecy?\"    \"No doubt. But as I have said, the word was passed round.\"    \"Did you know either of these other women?\"    \"No; but they were obviously members of good society.\"    \"And you drove them?\"    \"One to St. Pancras, and one to Waterloo,\" said Brian, dropping  back somewhat into his coarser style, and permitting a slow grin to  overspread his countenance.    \"To catch trains, no doubt?\"    \"Not a bit of it! To MEET trains!\"    \"You mean?\"    \"I mean that their own private cars were waiting for them at the ARRIVAL  platform as I drove 'em up to the DEPARTURE platform, and that they  simply marched through the station and pretended to have arrived by  train!\"    Inspector Dunbar took out his notebook and fountain-pen, and began to  tap his teeth with the latter, nodding his head at the same time.    \"You are sure of the accuracy of your last statement?\" he said, raising  his eyes to the other.    \"I followed one of them,\" was the reply,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20293"],[0,"A Popular History of the Art of Music (#10)"],[1,"similar  combinations. The latest writer of the Greek school was Claudius  Ptolemy, who lived at Alexandria about 150 A.D. In his work upon  harmony he gives a very large number of tables of fractions of this  kind--his own and those of all previous Greek theorists, and it is to  his book that we principally owe all the exact knowledge of Greek  musical theory which we possess. Among other computations, Ptolemy  gives the precise formula of the first four notes of the scale as we  now have it, but as this occurred only as one among many of a similar  character, and is in no way distinguished from any of the others by  any adjective implying greater confidence in it, we can only count it  as a lucky accident. The eminence that has been awarded to Ptolemy as  the original discoverer of the correct ratio of the major scale,  therefore, does not properly belong to him.    This will more clearly appear from the entire table of the various  determinations of the diatonic mode made by Ptolemy, taken from his  work. (Edition by John Wallis, Oxford, 1682, pp. 88 and 172.) He gives  no less than five of his own forms of diatonic genus, as follows: (The  fractions give vibration ratios.)         Soft diatonic, 8/7 x 10/9 x 21/20 = 4/3.       Medium diatonic, 9/8 x 8/7 x 28/27 = 4/3.       Intense diatonic, 10/9 x 9/8 x 16/15 = 4/3.       Equable diatonic, 10/9 x 11/10 x 12/11 = 4/3.       Diatonic diatonic, 9/8 x 9/8 x 256/243 = 4/3.    Among these there is no one that is correct or rational. The proper  ratios are given in the diatonic intense, but the large and small  steps stand in the wrong order. It is in Ptolemy's record of the  determinations of Didymus (born at Alexandria, 63 B.C.) that the true  tuning of the first four tones of the scale occurs. This is it:         Diatonic (Didymus), 9/8 x 10/9 x 16/15 = 4/3.    Thus it appears that it was Didymus, and not Ptolemy, who proposed the  tuning of the tetrachord which is now accepted as correct. It is very  evident from the entire course of the discussion as conducted by  Ptolemy that his calculations were purely abstract. He is to be  reckoned among the Pythagoreans, who held that in time and number all  things consist. It was not until some centuries later that the happy  thought of Didymus came to recognition as the true statement of the  mathematical relation of the first four tones of the scale, and then  only through the ears of a race of musicians following the great  thesis of Aristoxenos, that in music it is always the ear which must  be the arbiter, and not abstract reasoning or calculation. The ratios  of the major and minor third also occur among the calculations of  Didymus; but here, again, they count for nothing in the history of  art, because these intervals derive their value and expressive quality  from their harmonic relation, while Didymus and all the Greeks  employed them as melodic skips only, and reckoned them in with a  multitude of other skips and progressions, without distinguishing them  in any way.    The one characteristic instrument of Greek music from the earliest to  the latest days was the lyre. In the oldest times, those of Homer and  Hesiod, it was called phorminx, which is believed to have been the  form so often represented on Greek vases of a turtle shell with side  pieces like horns, an instrument having but little effective  resonance. The later form was the so-called cithara, the most common  shape of which is that made familiar to all by the pedal piece of the  square pianoforte. This instrument rarely had more than six strings,  and as it had no finger board it could have had no more notes than  strings. Chappell, the English historian, attempts to demonstrate that  certain ones of these instruments had a bridge dividing the string  into two parts, thus largely increasing the compass, but the evidence  supporting this hypothesis is not satisfactory. Plato speaks of  instruments of many strings imported from Asia, which seem to have  been the fashion or fad in his day. He disapproved of them very  heartily, but the terms in which he speaks of them show that he cannot  have been very familiar with their appearance, for it is impossible to  make out what he is driving at.    [Illustration: Fig. 13.    LYRE.]    [Illustration: Fig. 14.    CITHARA.]    There is considerable doubt as to the extent to which the larger  instruments of Asiatic origin penetrated the general musical practice  of Greece. Athenaeus, in his \"Banquets of the Learned\" (B. xvi, C),  quotes Anakreon as saying:         \"I hold my magadis, and sing,       Striking loud the twentieth string,       Leucaspis at the rapid hour       Leads you to youth and beauty's bower.\"    Most certainly the lyre of Terpander had no twenty strings.    The so-called Greek flute was a very reedy oboe or clarinet, a pipe  played with a reed, the pitch determined by holes stopped by the  fingers. These instruments were so hard to blow that the players wore  bands over their cheeks because there were cases on record where, in  the contests, they broke their cheeks by the wind pressure. The flute  or aulos does not seem to have been used in connection with the  cithara at all, and the Greeks had nothing corresponding to what we  call an orchestra. The aulos was appropriate to certain religious  services and to certain festivals, and it had a moderate status in the  various contests of the national games, but the great instrument of  Greek music, the universal dependence for all occasions, public and  private, was the lyre.    In spite of the meager resources of Greek music upon its tonal side,  this development of art has had a very important bearing upon the  progress of music, even down to our own times. Opera was re-discovered  about 1600 in the effort to re-create the Greek musical drama, and the  ideal proposed to himself by Richard Wagner was nothing else than that  of a new music drama in which the severe and lofty conceptions of the  old Greek poets should be embodied in musical forms the most advanced  that the modern mind has been able to conceive. Upon the aesthetic side  musical theory is entirely indebted to the Greek. Nothing more  suitable or appropriate can be said concerning musical taste and  cultivation than what was said by Aristotle 300 years before Christ.  For example, he has the following (Politics, viii, C. Jowett's  translation, p. 245): \"The customary branches of education are in  number four. They are: (1) reading and writing, (2) gymnastic  exercises, (3) music, to which is somewhat added (4) drawing. Of  these, reading, writing and drawing are regarded as useful to the  purposes of life in a variety of ways.\" He recommends the study of  music as part of the preparation of the fit occupation of leisure.  \"There remains, then, the use of music for the intellectual enjoyment  of leisure; which appears to have been the reason of its introduction,  this being one of the ways in which it is thought that a freeman  should pass his leisure; as Homer says:         'How good it is to invite men to the pleasant feast,'    and afterward he speaks of others whom he describes as inviting         'The bard who would delight them all' (Od. xvii, 385);    and in another place he says that there is no better way of passing  life than when         'Men's hearts are merry, and the banqueters in the hall       Sitting in order hear the voice of the minstrel.'\"    Plato is particular that only the noble harmonies shall be permitted  in his state. He says, \"Of the harmonies I want to have one warlike,  which will sound the word or note which a brave man utters in the hour  of danger or stern resolve, or when his cause is failing and he is  going to wounds or death, or is overtaken by some other evil, and in  every such crisis meets fortune with calmness and endurance; and  another which may be used by him in times of peace and freedom of  action, when there is no pressure of necessity--expressive of entreaty  or persuasion or prayer to God, or of instruction to man, or again  willingness to listen to persuasion or entreaty or advice. These two  harmonies I ask you to leave; the strain of necessity and the strain  of freedom, the strain of the unfortunate and the strain of the  fortunate, the strain of courage and the strain of temperance; these,  I say, leave.\" These he explains will be only the Dorian and the  Phrygian harmonies. In another place Plato shows himself a disciple of  the Egyptian ideas of conservatism, already mentioned. \"And therefore  when one of these clever and multiform gentlemen who can imitate  anything comes to our state, and proposes to exhibit himself and his  poetry, we will fall down and worship him as a sweet and holy and  wonderful being; but we must also inform him that there is no place  for such as he is in our state--the law will not allow him. And so  when we have anointed him with myrrh and set a garland of wool upon  his head, we shall send him away to another city.\" (Republic, Jowett,  iii, 398.)    In fact, upon the subject of music, Plato is one of the least  satisfactory of writers. He has many noble sentiments which might well  be printed in letters of gold and hung upon the walls of educational  institutions to-day, as (\"Laws,\" Jowett's translation, 668): \"Those  who seek for the best kind of song and music, ought not to seek for  that which is pleasant, but for that which is true.\" In another place,  however, he speaks of music as a kind of imitation. He says that music  without words is very difficult to understand. (\"Laws,\" _ibid._, 668.)  All these inconsistencies disappear, however, as soon as we recognize  the limitations of the music which Plato knew, upon its tonal side.  All the richness of sense incitation, and all the definiteness of  expression which come into our modern music through the magic of  \"tones in key,\" were wholly outside the range of Plato's knowledge.    The musical notation of the Greeks consisted of"]]]
