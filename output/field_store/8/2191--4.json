A single example will enable you to understand this method of  adaptation perfectly. The lower part of the facade of the cathedral of  Lyons, built either late in the thirteenth or early in the fourteenth  century, is decorated with a series of niches, filled by statues of  considerable size, which are supported upon pedestals within about eight  feet of the ground. In general, pedestals of this kind are supported on  some projecting portion of the basement; but at Lyons, owing to other  arrangements of the architecture into which I have no time to enter,  they are merely projecting tablets, or flat-bottomed brackets of stone,  projecting from the wall. Each bracket is about a foot and a half  square, and is shaped thus (_fig._ 13), showing to the spectator, as he  walks beneath, the flat bottom of each bracket, quite in the shade, but  within a couple of feet of the eye, and lighted by the reflected light  from the pavement. The whole of the surface of the wall round the great  entrance is covered with bas-relief, as a matter of course; but the  architect appears to have been jealous of the smallest space which was  well within the range of sight; and the _bottom_ of every bracket is  decorated also--nor that slightly, but decorated with no fewer than _six  figures each, besides a flower border_, in a space, as I said, _not  quite a foot and a half square_. The shape of the field to be decorated  being a kind of quatre-foil, as shown in _fig._ 13, four small figures  are placed, one in each foil, and two larger ones in the center. I had  only time, in passing through the town, to make a drawing of one of the  angles of these pedestals; that sketch I have enlarged, in order that  you may have some idea of the character of the sculpture. Here is the  enlargement of it (_fig._ 15). Now observe, this is _one_ of the angles  of the bottom of a pedestal, not two feet broad, on the outside of a  Gothic building; it contains only one of the four little figures which  form those angles; and it shows you the head only of one of the larger  figures in the center. Yet just observe how much design, how much  wonderful composition, there is in this mere fragment of a building of  the great times; a fragment, literally no larger than a school-boy could  strike off in wantonness with a stick: and yet I cannot tell you how  much care has been spent--not so much on the execution, for it does not  take much trouble to execute well on so small a scale--but on the  design, of this minute fragment. You see it is composed of a branch of  wild roses, which switches round at the angle, embracing the minute  figure of the bishop, and terminates in a spray reaching nearly to the  head of the large figure. You will observe how beautifully that figure  is thus _pointed to_ by the spray of rose, and how all the leaves around  it in the same manner are subservient to the grace of its action. Look,  if I hide one line, or one rosebud, how the whole is injured, and how  much there is to study in the detail of it. Look at this little diamond  crown, with a lock of the hair escaping from beneath it; and at the  beautiful way in which the tiny leaf at _a_, is set in the angle to  prevent its harshness; and having examined this well, consider what a  treasure of thought there is in a cathedral front, a hundred feet wide,  every inch of which is wrought with sculpture like this! And every front  of our thirteenth century cathedrals is inwrought with sculpture of this  quality! And yet you quietly allow yourselves to be told that the men  who thus wrought were barbarians, and that your architects are  wiser and better in covering your walls with sculpture of this kind  (_fig._ 14, Plate VIII.)    [Illustration: PLATE IX. (Fig. 15.)]    [Illustration: PLATE X. (Fig. 16.)]    38. Walk round your Edinburgh buildings, and look at the height of your  eye, what you will get from them. Nothing but square-cut  stone--square-cut stone--a wilderness of square-cut stone forever and  forever; so that your houses look like prisons, and truly are so; for  the worst feature of Greek architecture is, indeed, not its costliness,  but its tyranny. These square stones are not prisons of the body, but  graves of the soul; for the very men who could do sculpture like this of  Lyons for you are here! still here, in your despised workmen: the race  has not degenerated, it is you who have bound them down, and buried them  beneath your Greek stones. There would be a resurrection of them, as of  renewed souls, if you would only lift the weight of these weary walls  from off their hearts.[17]    [Footnote 17: This subject is farther pursued in the Addenda at the end  of this Lecture.]    39. But I am leaving the point immediately in question, which, you will  remember, was the proper adaptation of ornament to its distance from the  eye. I have given you one example of Gothic ornament, meant to be seen  close; now let me give you one of Gothic ornament intended to be seen  far off. Here (_fig._ 16) is a sketch of a niche at Amiens Cathedral,  some fifty or sixty feet high on the facade, and seven or eight feet  wide. Now observe, in the ornament close to the eye, you had _six  figures_ and a whole wreath of roses in the space of _a foot and a half_  square; but in the ornament sixty feet from the eye, you have now only  ten or twelve large _leaves_ in a space of _eight feet square_! and note  also that now there is no attempt whatsoever at the refinement of line  and finish of edge which there was in the other example. The sculptor  knew that, at the height of this niche, people would not attend to the  delicate lines, and that the broad shadows would catch the eye instead.  He has therefore left, as you see, rude square edges to his niche, and  carved his leaves as massively and broadly as possible: and yet, observe  how dexterously he has given you a sense of delicacy and minuteness in  the work, by mingling these small leaves among the large ones. I made  this sketch from a photograph, and the spot in which these leaves  occurred was obscure; I have, therefore, used those of the Oxalis  acetosella, of which the quaint form is always interesting.    40. And you see by this example also what I meant just now by saying,  that our own ornament was not only wrongly placed, but wrongly FINISHED.  The very qualities which _fit_ this leaf-decoration for due effect upon  the eye, are those which would _conduce to economy_ in its execution. A  more expensive ornament would be less effective; and it is the very  price we pay for finishing our decorations which spoils our  architecture. And the curious thing is, that while you all appreciate,  and that far too highly, what is called \"the bold style\" in painting,  you cannot appreciate it in sculpture. You like a hurried, broad,  dashing manner of execution in a water-color drawing, though that may be  seen as near as you choose, and yet you refuse to admit the nobleness of  a bold, simple, and dashing stroke of the chisel in work which is to be  seen forty fathoms off. Be assured that \"handling\" is as great a thing  in marble as in paint, and that the power of producing a masterly effect  with few touches is as essential in an architect as in a draughtsman;  though indeed that power is never perfectly attained except by those who  possess the power of giving the highest finish when there is occasion.    41. But there is yet another and a weightier charge to be brought  against our modern Pseudo-Greek ornamentation. It is, first, wrongly  placed; secondly, wrongly finished; and, thirdly, utterly _without  meaning_. Observe in these two Gothic ornaments, and in every other  ornament that ever was carved in the great Gothic times, there is a  definite aim at the representation of some natural object. In _fig._ 15  you have an exquisite group of rose-stems, with the flowers and buds; in  _fig._ 16, various wild weeds, especially the Geranium pratense; in  every case you have an approximation to a natural form, and an unceasing  variety of suggestion. But how much of Nature have you in your Greek  buildings? I will show you, taking for an example the best you have  lately built; and, in doing so, I trust that nothing that I say will be  thought to have any personal purpose, and that the architect of the  building in question will forgive me; for it is just because it is a  good example of the style that I think it more fair to use it for an  example. If the building were a bad one of the kind, it would not be a  fair instance; and I hope, therefore, that in speaking of the  institution on the Mound, just in progress, I shall be understood as  meaning rather a compliment to its architect than otherwise. It is not  his fault that we force him to build in the Greek manner.    42. Now, according to the orthodox practice in modern architecture, the  most delicate and minute pieces of sculpture on that building are at the  very top of it, just under its gutter. You cannot see them in a dark  day, and perhaps may never, to this hour, have noticed them at all. But  there they are: sixty-six finished heads of lions, all exactly the same;  and, therefore, I suppose, executed on some noble Greek type, too noble  to allow any modest Modern to think of improving upon it. But whether  executed on a Greek type or no, it is to be presumed that, as there are  sixty-six of them alike, and on so important a building as that which is  to contain your school of design, and which is the principal example of  the Athenian style in modern Athens, there must be something especially  admirable in them, and deserving your most attentive contemplation. In  order, therefore, that you might have a fair opportunity of estimating  their beauty, I was desirous of getting a sketch of a real lion's head  to compare with them, and my friend Mr. Millais kindly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/236"],[0,"The Jungle Book (#10)"],[1,"back, Little Brother, and we will go  home.\"    One of the beauties of Jungle Law is that punishment settles all scores.  There is no nagging afterward.    Mowgli laid his head down on Bagheera's back and slept so deeply that he  never waked when he was put down in the home-cave.          Road-Song of the Bandar-Log         Here we go in a flung festoon,       Half-way up to the jealous moon!       Don't you envy our pranceful bands?       Don't you wish you had extra hands?       Wouldn't you like if your tails were--so--       Curved in the shape of a Cupid's bow?          Now you're angry, but--never mind,          Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!         Here we sit in a branchy row,       Thinking of beautiful things we know;       Dreaming of deeds that we mean to do,       All complete, in a minute or two--       Something noble and wise and good,       Done by merely wishing we could.          We've forgotten, but--never mind,          Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!         All the talk we ever have heard       Uttered by bat or beast or bird--       Hide or fin or scale or feather--       Jabber it quickly and all together!       Excellent!  Wonderful!  Once again!         Now we are talking just like men!          Let's pretend we are ... never mind,          Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!          This is the way of the Monkey-kind.         Then join our leaping lines that scumfish through the pines,       That rocket by where, light and high, the wild grape swings.       By the rubbish in our wake, and the noble noise we make,       Be sure, be sure, we're going to do some splendid things!          \"Tiger! Tiger!\"         What of the hunting, hunter bold?          Brother, the watch was long and cold.       What of the quarry ye went to kill?          Brother, he crops in the jungle still.       Where is the power that made your pride?          Brother, it ebbs from my flank and side.       Where is the haste that ye hurry by?          Brother, I go to my lair--to die.    Now we must go back to the first tale. When Mowgli left the wolf's cave  after the fight with the Pack at the Council Rock, he went down to the  plowed lands where the villagers lived, but he would not stop there  because it was too near to the jungle, and he knew that he had made at  least one bad enemy at the Council. So he hurried on, keeping to  the rough road that ran down the valley, and followed it at a steady  jog-trot for nearly twenty miles, till he came to a country that he  did not know. The valley opened out into a great plain dotted over with  rocks and cut up by ravines. At one end stood a little village, and at  the other the thick jungle came down in a sweep to the grazing-grounds,  and stopped there as though it had been cut off with a hoe. All over the  plain, cattle and buffaloes were grazing, and when the little boys in  charge of the herds saw Mowgli they shouted and ran away, and the yellow  pariah dogs that hang about every Indian village barked. Mowgli walked  on, for he was feeling hungry, and when he came to the village gate he  saw the big thorn-bush that was drawn up before the gate at twilight,  pushed to one side.    \"Umph!\" he said, for he had come across more than one such barricade in  his night rambles after things to eat. \"So men are afraid of the People  of the Jungle here also.\" He sat down by the gate, and when a man came  out he stood up, opened his mouth, and pointed down it to show that  he wanted food. The man stared, and ran back up the one street of the  village shouting for the priest, who was a big, fat man dressed in  white, with a red and yellow mark on his forehead. The priest came to  the gate, and with him at least a hundred people, who stared and talked  and shouted and pointed at Mowgli.    \"They have no manners, these Men Folk,\" said Mowgli to himself. \"Only  the gray ape would behave as they do.\" So he threw back his long hair  and frowned at the crowd.    \"What is there to be afraid of?\" said the priest. \"Look at the marks on  his arms and legs. They are the bites of wolves. He is but a wolf-child  run away from the jungle.\"    Of course, in playing together, the cubs had often nipped Mowgli harder  than they intended, and there were white scars all over his arms and  legs. But he would have been the last person in the world to call these  bites, for he knew what real biting meant.    \"Arre! Arre!\" said two or three women together. \"To be bitten by wolves,  poor child! He is a handsome boy. He has eyes like red fire. By my  honor, Messua, he is not unlike thy boy that was taken by the tiger.\"    \"Let me look,\" said a woman with heavy copper rings on her wrists and  ankles, and she peered at Mowgli under the palm of her hand. \"Indeed he  is not. He is thinner, but he has the very look of my boy.\"    The priest was a clever man, and he knew that Messua was wife to the  richest villager in the place. So he looked up at the sky for a minute  and said solemnly: \"What the jungle has taken the jungle has restored.  Take the boy into thy house, my sister, and forget not to honor the  priest who sees so far into the lives of men.\"    \"By the Bull that bought me,\" said Mowgli to himself, \"but all this  talking is like another looking-over by the Pack! Well, if I am a man, a  man I must become.\"    The crowd parted as the woman beckoned Mowgli to her hut, where there  was a red lacquered bedstead, a great earthen grain chest with funny  raised patterns on it, half a dozen copper cooking pots, an image of a  Hindu god in a little alcove, and on the wall a real looking glass, such  as they sell at the country fairs.    She gave him a long drink of milk and some bread, and then she laid her  hand on his head and looked into his eyes; for she thought perhaps that  he might be her real son come back from the jungle where the tiger had  taken him. So she said, \"Nathoo, O Nathoo!\" Mowgli did not show that he  knew the name. \"Dost thou not remember the day when I gave thee thy new  shoes?\" She touched his foot, and it was almost as hard as horn. \"No,\"  she said sorrowfully, \"those feet have never worn shoes, but thou art  very like my Nathoo, and thou shalt be my son.\"    Mowgli was uneasy, because he had never been under a roof before. But as  he looked at the thatch, he saw that he could tear it out any time if he  wanted to get away, and that the window had no fastenings. \"What is the  good of a man,\" he said to himself at last, \"if he does not understand  man's talk? Now I am as silly and dumb as a man would be with us in the  jungle. I must speak their talk.\"    It was not for fun that he had learned while he was with the wolves to  imitate the challenge of bucks in the jungle and the grunt of the little  wild pig. So, as soon as Messua pronounced a word Mowgli would imitate  it almost perfectly, and before dark he had learned the names of many  things in the hut.    There was a difficulty at bedtime, because Mowgli would not sleep under  anything that looked so like a panther trap as that hut, and when they  shut the door he went through the window. \"Give him his will,\" said  Messua's husband. \"Remember he can never till now have slept on a bed.  If he is indeed sent in the place of our son he will not run away.\"    So Mowgli stretched himself in some long, clean grass at the edge of  the field, but before he had closed his eyes a soft gray nose poked him  under the chin.    \"Phew!\" said Gray Brother (he was the eldest of Mother Wolf's cubs).  \"This is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles. Thou smellest  of wood smoke and cattle--altogether like a man already. Wake, Little  Brother; I bring news.\"    \"Are all well in the jungle?\" said Mowgli, hugging him.    \"All except the wolves that were burned with the Red Flower. Now,  listen. Shere Khan has gone away to hunt far off till his coat grows  again, for he is badly singed. When he returns he swears that he will  lay thy bones in the Waingunga.\"    \"There are two words to that. I also have made a little promise. But  news is always good. I am tired to-night,--very tired with new things,  Gray Brother,--but bring me the news always.\"    \"Thou wilt not forget that thou art a wolf? Men will not make thee  forget?\" said Gray Brother anxiously.    \"Never. I will always remember that I love thee and all in our cave. But  also I will always remember that I have been cast out of the Pack.\"    \"And that thou mayest be cast out of another pack. Men are only men,  Little Brother, and their talk is like the talk of frogs in a pond. When  I come down here again, I will wait for thee in the bamboos at the edge  of the grazing-ground.\"    For three months after that night Mowgli hardly ever left the village  gate, he was so busy learning the ways and customs of men. First he had  to wear a cloth round him, which annoyed him horribly; and then he had  to learn about money, which he did not in the least understand, and  about plowing, of which he did not see the use. Then the little children  in the village made him very angry. Luckily, the Law of the Jungle had  taught him to keep his temper, for in the jungle life and food depend on  keeping your temper; but when they made fun of him because he would not  play games or fly kites, or because he mispronounced some word, only the  knowledge that it was unsportsmanlike to kill little naked cubs kept him  from picking them up and breaking them in two.    He did not know his own strength in the least. In the jungle he knew he  was weak compared with the beasts, but in the village people said that  he was as strong as a bull.    And Mowgli had not the faintest idea of the difference that caste makes  between man and man. When the potter's donkey slipped in the clay pit,  Mowgli hauled it out by the tail, and helped to stack the pots for their  journey to the market at Khanhiwara. That was very shocking, too, for  the potter is a low-caste man, and his donkey is worse. When the"]]]
