Nowhere was the failure of the British Government to comprehend the  largeness, at once of the current struggle and of its Imperial  opportunities, more evident than in the wording of its momentary  rejection of the second proffered help from the self-governing  colonies. To the offer of the Canadian Government on November 3, the  British Ministry on the 8th replied that circumstances then were such  that the necessity of a second contingent was not apparent. It may be  that, to quote again a contemporary utterance, \"It has been decided  that the forces so contributed shall rather serve to assert a  principle than to constitute a serious burden on {p.081} the  colonies\"; and it is doubtless more judicious to accept less, and  charily, of a too eager giver than to overtask his benevolence.  Nevertheless, a more guarded and contingent refusal would have shown  better appreciation of current conditions, and of the Imperial  possibilities involved in the continued and increased participation of  the colonies in an Imperial war.    In order not to revert again to the matter of colonial participation,  it may be well to state here that the reverse of Methuen at  Magersfontein, on December 11, occasioned a casual suggestion in the  London _Times_ of the 14th that \"the colonies, whose forces are  especially suited for the exigencies of the present struggle, have  already offered in some instances to increase the strength of their  contingents ... and should now be invited to do so.\" Official  invitation was not awaited. The colonies took the initiative by asking  if reinforcements would be acceptable, and upon an affirmative reply  the additional troops and sums required received the votes of men of  all parties; Buller's first repulse at Colenso, and the news of  Roberts' appointment to the chief {p.082} command in South Africa,  contributing simultaneously to harden determination and to swell  enthusiasm. Whatever may be thought of the judgment of the Ministry in  the first refusal, which but reflected the slowness with which both it  and the nation it represented aroused to the magnitude of their task,  there can be little doubt that the general outcome was favourable  beyond all antecedent probability to nurturing the growth of the  Imperial sentiment. In the second effort Canada sent 1,969 officers  and men, Australasia 1,843. From the number of horses accompanying  them it is evident that these were chiefly, if not all, mounted  troops; the kind especially needed for the seat of war.    The figures given yield a grand total of 6,352 sent from the Canadian  and Australasian colonies in the more formal organization. To these  are to be added from New Zealand and Australia some 2,700 irregular  horse, raised from among the men who live there in the open, not  previously enrolled, and corresponding in general characteristics to  the Rough Riders of our recent war in Cuba. India also sent a  contingent of 2,437 men and officers. {p.083} Up to this moment of  writing, no certain account of the number of colonial troops furnished  by the South African colonies has been accessible to me. Speaking in  public recently, Mr. Chamberlain has said that more than 30,000 men  had been offered by the self-governing colonies. Early in December it  was estimated that, including the forces in Kimberley, Mafeking, and  Rhodesia, Cape Colony had already 10,000 in service. In February, an  official, but incomplete, and therefore a minimum, list attributed  7,158 at that time to Natal. Combining these various statements, and  reckoning at 12,000 the contingents from the other self-governing  colonies (excluding India), at the time of Chamberlain's speech (May  11), it seems probable that British South Africa put into the field  from 20,000 to 25,000 men. This conclusion agrees substantially with  one furnished to the author from an independent source, using other  data.    In its entirety, the contribution of some 12,000 troops--more or  less[5]--from the greater remote {p.084} dependencies does not indeed  loom very large alongside the truly gigantic figure of 166,277  officers and men, who, between the 20th of October and the 31st of  March, were despatched for South Africa from the ports of the United  Kingdom; in which number are not included those drawn from India and  from England prior to the earlier date, and who constituted the bulk  of the force shut up in Ladysmith under Sir George White. But the  practical importance of a common sentiment--of a great moral fact--is  not to be measured by figures only. The idea of Imperial Federation  justifies itself to the intelligence as well as to the imagination,  resting upon the solid foundation of common interests as well as of  common traditions.                       [Footnote 5: More have sailed since the above                     information, but exact figures are wanting to the                     author.]    In the adjustment of relative importance in men's intellects--which  must precede any useful adjustment of mutual relations, benefits and  responsibilities, by former political agreement--the colonies on the  one hand will have to recognize the immensely greater burden, as  indicated by the above figures and by the size of the fleet, borne by  the United Kingdom. The latter on its part must acknowledge, as  {p.085} in practice she has done, not merely the right of the colonies  to their local administration and self-government, but also the  indispensable contribution to the mutual interests of all parts in the  Federation, that results from local naval bases of operations in many  decisive parts of the world, resting everywhere upon the one sure  foundation for such bases--an enthusiastically loyal, self-dependent,  and military population. Military power, in analysis, consists  principally of two factors--force and position--and if the greater  wealth and population of the home country causes it to exceed in the  former, the dispersion and character of the dependencies contribute  decisively to the latter.    The transportation of the above immense body of soldiers, with all the  equipment and supplies of war needed for a protracted campaign a  distance of 6,000 miles[6] by sea, is an incident unprecedented, and  in its success unsurpassed, in military history. The nature of the  war, it is true, removed from the undertaking all {p.086} military or  naval risk; there was in it nothing corresponding to the anxious  solicitude imposed upon the British generals, by the length of their  thin railroad line and its exposure in numerous critical points to a  mobile enemy. But as a triumph of organisation--of method, of system,  and of sedulous competent attention to details--the performance has  reflected the utmost credit not only upon the Admiralty, to which,  contrary to the rule of the United States, this matter is intrusted,  and which is ultimately responsible both for the general system in  force and for the results, but also upon the Director of Transports,  Rear-Admiral Bouverie Clark, to whose tenure of this office has fallen  the weighty care of immediate supervision. To success in so great an  undertaking are needed both a good antecedent system and a good  administrator; for administration under such exceptional conditions,  precipitated also at the end by the rapid development of events, means  not merely the steady running of a well-adjusted and well-oiled  machine, but continual adaptation--flexibility and readiness as well  as precision, the spirit as well as the letter. When a particular  {p.087} process has had so large a share in the general conduct of a  war, a broad account of its greater details is indispensable to a  complete history of the operations.                       [Footnote 6: The distance from Southampton, the                     chief though not the only port of departure, to                     Cape Town is 5,978 miles.]    The number and varied distribution, in place and in climate, of the  colonial or foreign posts occupied by the British army at the present  time, and the extensive character of its operations abroad, during war  and peace, for two centuries have occasioned a gradual elaboration of  regulation in the transport system, to which, by the necessity of  frequent changes of troops, are added an extent and a continuity of  practical experience that has no parallel in other nations. These have  vastly facilitated the unprecedented development demanded by the  present war. A leaven of experimental familiarity, by previous  personal contact with the various problems to be solved, suffices to  permeate the very large lump of crude helplessness that may be  unavoidably thrown upon the hands of regimental officers; and even  where such personal experience has been wholly wanting to a particular  ship's company, the minuteness of the regulations, if intelligently  followed, gives {p.088} a direction and precision to action, which  will quickly result in the order and convenience essential to the  crowded life afloat. Nowhere more than on board ship does man live  ever face to face with the necessity of order and system, for there  always the most has to be disposed in the least space.    When a ship is engaged for the government service wholly--but not  otherwise--she is known officially as a \"transport\"; when passage for  troops is taken, but the ship is not entirely at the government's  disposal, she is a \"troop freight ship.\" In the former capacity, to  adapt her to her new employment, she passes under the charge of  designated naval officers for particular fitting; the time for which,  in this war's practice, has not exceeded two weeks for infantry or  four for cavalry transports. Upon preparation completed ensues an  immediate inspection by a mixed board of army, navy, and medical  officers before the ship proceeds to the place for embarkation. The  aim necessarily is to keep this process well in advance of the  mobilisation "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2099"],[0,"A History of the Moravian Church (#10)"],[1," his  hand on my head,\" says Michael, \"and consecrated me a Bishop.\" Forthwith  the new Bishop returned to Lhota, ordained the chosen three as Priests,  and consecrated Matthias of Kunwald a Bishop. And thus arose those  Episcopal Orders which have been maintained in the Church of the  Brethren down to the present day.    The goal was reached; the Church was founded; the work of Gregory was  done. For twenty years he had taught his Brethren to study the mind  of Christ in the Scriptures and to seek the guidance of God in united  prayer, and now he saw them joined as one to face the rising storm.    \"Henceforth,\" he wrote gladly to King George Podiebrad, \"we have done  with the Church of Rome.\" As he saw the evening of life draw near, he  urged his Brethren more and more to hold fast the teaching of Peter of  Chelcic, and to regulate their daily conduct by the law of Christ; and  by that law of Christ he probably meant the \"Six Commandments\" of  the Sermon on the Mount.[15] He took these Commandments literally,  and enforced them with a rod of iron. No Brother could be a judge or  magistrate or councillor. No Brother could take an oath or keep an inn,  or trade beyond the barest needs of life. No noble, unless he laid  down his rank, could become a Brother at all. No peasant could render  military service or act as a bailiff on a farm. No Brother could ever  divorce his wife or take an action at law. As long as Gregory remained  in their midst, the Brethren held true to him as their leader. He had  not, says Gindely, a single trace of personal ambition in his nature;  and, though he might have become a Bishop, he remained a layman to the  end. Full of years he died, and his bones repose in a cleft where tufts  of forget-me-not grow, at Brandeis-on-the-Adler, hard by the Moravian  frontier {Sept.13th, 1473.}.          CHAPTER VI. -- LUKE OF PRAGUE AND THE HIGH CHURCH REACTION. 1473-1530.    Of the Brethren who settled in the valley of Kunwald the greater number  were country peasants and tradesmen of humble rank. But already the  noble and mighty were pressing in. As the eyes of Gregory closed in  death, a new party was rising to power. Already the Brethren were strong  in numbers, and already they were longing to snap the fetters that  Gregory had placed upon their feet. From Neustadt in the North to Skutch  in the South, and from Chlumec in the West to Kunwald in the East,  they now lay thickly sprinkled; and in all the principal towns of that  district, an area of nine hundred square miles, they were winning  rich and influential members. In came the University dons; in came the  aldermen and knights. In came, above all, a large colony of Waldenses,  who had immigrated from the Margravate of Brandenburg {1480.}. Some  settled at Fulneck, in Moravia, others at Landskron, in Bohemia;  and now, by their own request, they were admitted to the Brethren's  Church.[16] For a while the Brethren held to the rule that if a nobleman  joined their Church he must first lay down his rank. But now that rule  was beginning to gall and chafe. They were winning golden opinions on  every hand; they were becoming known as the best men for positions of  trust in the State; they were just the men to make the best magistrates  and aldermen; and thus they felt forced by their very virtues to  renounce the narrow ideas of Peter and to play their part in national  and city life.    At this moment, when new ideas were budding, there entered the service  of the Church a young man who is known as Luke of Prague. He was  born about 1460, was a Bachelor of Prague University, was a well-read  theological scholar, and for fifty years was the trusted leader of the  Brethren. Forthwith he read the signs of the times, and took the tide  at the flood. In Procop of Neuhaus, another graduate, he found a  warm supporter. The two scholars led the van of the new movement. The  struggle was fierce. On the one side was the \"great party\" of culture,  led by Luke of Prague and Procop of Neuhaus; on the other the so-called  \"little party,\" the old-fashioned rigid Radicals, led by two farmers,  Amos and Jacob. \"Ah, Matthias,\" said Gregory the Patriarch, on his  death-bed, \"beware of the educated Brethren!\" But, despite this warning,  the educated Brethren won the day. For once and for ever the Brethren  resolved that the writings of Peter and Gregory should no longer be  regarded as binding. At a Synod held at Reichenau they rejected the  authority of Peter entirely {1494.}. They agreed that nobles might join  the Church without laying down their rank; they agreed that if a man's  business were honest he might make profits therein; they agreed that  Brethren might enter the service of the State; and they even agreed that  oaths might be taken in cases of special need.[17] And then, next year,  they made their position still clearer {1495.}. Instead of taking Peter  as their guide, they now took the Bible and the Bible alone. \"We content  ourselves,\" they solemnly declared, at another Synod held at Reichenau,  \"with those sacred books which have been accepted from of old by all  Christians, and are found in the Bible\"; and thus, forty years before  John Calvin, and eighty years before the Lutherans, they declared that  the words of Holy Scripture, apart from any disputed interpretation,  should be their only standard of faith and practice. No longer did they  honour the memory of Peter; no longer did they appeal to him in their  writings; no longer, in a word, can we call the Brethren the true  followers of Peter of Chelcic. Instead, henceforward, of regarding Peter  as the founder of their Church, they began now to regard themselves  as the disciples of Hus. In days gone by they had spoken of Hus as a  \"causer of war.\" Now they held his name and memory sacred; and from this  time onward the real followers of Peter were, not the Brethren, but the  \"little party\" led by Amos and Jacob.[18]  But the scholars led the Brethren further still. If the reader will  kindly refer to the chapter on Peter, he will see that that racy  pamphleteer had far more to say about good works than about the merits  of saving faith; but now, after years of keen discussion, Procop of  Neuhaus put to the Council of Elders the momentous question: \"By what  is a man justified?\" The answer given was clear: \"By the merits of Jesus  Christ.\" The great doctrine of justification by grace was taught;  the old doctrine of justification by works was modified; and thus the  Brethren's Church became the first organized Evangelical Church in  Europe.[19]  And Luke designed to make her the strongest, too. His energy never  seemed to flag. As he wished to establish the ministry more firmly,  he had the number of Bishops enlarged, and became a Bishop himself. He  enlarged the governing Council, with his friend Procop of Neuhaus as  Ecclesiastical Judge. He beautified the Church Services, and made the  ritual more ornate. He introduced golden communion cups and delicately  embroidered corporals, and some of the Brethren actually thought that  he was leading them back to Rome. He gave an impulse to Church music,  encouraged reading both in Priests and in people, and made a use of the  printing press which in those days was astounding. Of the five printing  presses in all Bohemia, three belonged to the Brethren; of sixty printed  works that appeared between 1500 and 1510, no fewer than fifty were  published by the Brethren; and of all the scribes of the sixteenth  century, Luke was the most prolific. He wrote a \"Catechism for  Children.\" He edited the first Brethren's hymn book (1501), the first  Church hymnal in history. He published a commentary on the Psalms,  another on the Gospel of St. John, and another on the eleventh chapter  of 1 Corinthians; he drew up \"Confessions of Faith,\" and sent them to  the King; and thus, for the first time in the history of Bohemia, he  made the newly invented press a mighty power in the land.    And even with this the good Bishop was not content {1491.}. If the  Brethren, thought he, were true to their name, they must surely long for  fellowship with others of like mind with themselves. For this purpose  Luke and his friends set off to search for Brethren in other lands. Away  went one to find the pure Nestorian Church that was said to exist in  India, got as far as Antioch, Jerusalem and Egypt, and, being misled  somehow by a Jew, returned home with the wonderful notion that the River  Nile flowed from the Garden of Eden, but with no more knowledge of the  Church in India than when he first set out. Another explored the South  of Russia, and the third sought Christians in Turkey. And Luke himself  had little more success. He explored a number of Monasteries in Greece,  came on to Rome {1498.}, saw the streets of the city littered with  corpses of men murdered by Caesar Borgia, picked up some useful  information about the private character of the Pope, saw Savonarola put  to death in Florence, fell in with a few Waldenses in the Savoy, and  then, having sought for pearls in vain, returned home in a state of  disgust, and convinced that, besides the Brethren, there was not to be  found a true Christian Church on the face of God's fair earth. He even  found fault with the Waldenses.    It was time, indeed, for Luke to return, for trouble was brewing  at home. For some years there dwelt in the town of Jungbunzlau, the  headquarters of the Brethren's Church, a smart young man, by name John  Lezek. He began life as a brewer's apprentice; he then entered the  service of a Brother, and learned a good deal of the Brethren's manners  and customs; and now he saw the chance of turning his knowledge to good  account. If only he told a good tale against the Brethren, he would  be sure to be a popular hero. For this purpose he visited the parish  priest, and confessed to a number of abominations committed by him while  among the wicked Brethren. The parish priest was delighted;"]]]
