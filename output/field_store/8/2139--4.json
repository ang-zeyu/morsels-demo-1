Thus did the people of Newport resist tyranny.    It may well be imagined that so bold a defiance of the royal authority  caused a great sensation. Prolonged and vigorous were the attempts of  the servants of the king to find out the rebellious parties who had  thus destroyed his Majesty's property. But their efforts were in vain.  The identity of the captors of the \"Liberty\" was carefully concealed,  and even to this day none of their names has become known. But, before  the people of Newport had done talking about this affair, another  outbreak occurred, which cast the capture and destruction of the  \"Liberty\" into the shade.    This was the affair of the \"Gaspee,\"--considered by many historians  the virtual opening of the revolutionary struggle of the Colonies  against Great Britain. The \"Gaspee,\" like the \"St. John\" and the  \"Liberty,\" was an armed vessel stationed in Narragansett Bay to  enforce the revenue. She was commanded by Lieut. Dudingston of the  British navy, and carried eight guns. By pursuing the usual tactics of  the British officers stationed on the American coast, Duddingston had  made himself hated; and his vessel was marked for destruction. Not a  boat could pass between Providence and Newport without being subjected  to search by the crew of the \"Gaspee;\" and the Yankee sailors swore  darkly, that, when the time was ripe, they would put an end to the  Britisher's officious meddling.    The propitious time arrived one bright June morning in the year 1772,  when the \"Gaspee\" gave chase to a Newport packet which was scudding  for Providence, under the command of Capt. Thomas Lindsey. The armed  vessel was a clean-cut little craft, and, carrying no heavier load  than a few light guns of the calibre then in vogue, could overhaul  with ease almost any merchantman on the coast. So on this eventful day  she was rapidly overhauling the chase, when, by a blunder of the  pilot, she was run hard and fast upon a spit of sand running out from  Namquit Point, and thus saw her projected prize sail away in triumph.    But the escape of her prize was not the greatest disaster that was to  befall the \"Gaspee\" that day. Lindsey, finding himself safe from the  clutches of the enemy, continued his course to Providence, and on  arriving at that city reported the condition of the \"Gaspee\" to a  prominent citizen, who straightway determined to organize an  expedition for the destruction of the pest of marine traffic. He  therefore gave orders to a trusty ship-master to collect eight of the  largest long-boats in the harbor, and, having muffled their oars and  rowlocks, place them at Fenner's Wharf, near a noted tavern.    That night, soon after sunset, as the tradesmen were shutting up their  shops, and the laboring men were standing on the streets talking after  their day's work, a man passed down the middle of each street, beating  a drum, and crying aloud,--    \"The schooner 'Gaspee' is ashore on Namquit Point. Who will help  destroy her?\"    All who expressed a desire to join in the enterprise were directed to  repair to the Sabin House; and thither, later in the evening, flocked  many of the townspeople carrying guns, powder-flasks, and  bullet-pouches. Within the house all was life and bustle. The great  hall was crowded with determined men, discussing the plan of attack.  Guns stood in every corner, while down in the kitchen a half a dozen  men stood about a glowing fire busily casting bullets. At last, all  being prepared, the party crossed the street to the dock, and  embarked,--a veteran sea-captain taking the tiller of each boat.    On the way down the harbor the boats stopped, and took aboard a number  of paving-stones and stout clubs, as weapons for those who had no  muskets. After this stoppage the boats continued on their way, until,  when within sixty yards of the \"Gaspee,\" the long-drawn hail. \"Who  comes there?\" rang out over the water. No answer was made, and the  lookout quickly repeated his hail. Capt. Whipple, one of the leaders of  the attack, then responded,--    \"I want to come on board.\"    Dudingston, who was below at the time, rushed on deck, exclaiming,  \"Stand off. You can't come aboard.\"    As Dudingston stood at the side of the \"Gaspee\" warning off the  assailants, he presented a good mark; and Joseph Bucklin, who pulled  an oar in the leading boat, turned to a comrade and said, \"Ephe, lend  me your gun, and I can kill that fellow.\" The gun was accordingly  handed him, and he fired. Dudingston fell to the deck. Just as the  shot was fired, the leader of the assailants cried out,--    \"I am sheriff of the county of Kent. I am come for the commander of  this vessel; and have him I will, dead or alive. Men, spring to your  oars.\"    In an instant the boats were under the lee of the schooner, and the  attacking party was clambering over the side. The first man to attempt  to board seized a rope, and was clambering up, when one of the British  cut the rope, and let him fall into the water. He quickly recovered  himself, and was soon on deck, where he found his comrades driving the  crew of the \"Gaspee\" below, and meeting with but little resistance.    A surgeon who was with the party of Americans led the boarders below,  and began the task of tying the hands of the captured crew with strong  tarred cord. While thus engaged, he was called on deck.    \"What is wanted, Mr. Brown?\" asked he, calling the name of the person  inquiring for him.    \"Don't call names, but go immediately into the cabin,\" was the  response. \"There is one wounded, and will bleed to death.\"    The surgeon went into the captain's cabin, and there found Dudingston,  severely wounded, and bleeding freely. Seeing no cloth suitable for  bandages, the surgeon opened his vest, and began to tear his own shirt  into strips to bind up the wound. With the tenderest care the hurt of  the injured officer was attended to; and he was gently lowered into a  boat, and rowed up the river to Providence.    The Americans remained in possession of the captured schooner, and  quickly began the work of demolition. In the captain's cabin were a  number of bottles of liquor, and for these the men made a rush; but  the American surgeon dashed the bottles to pieces with the heels of  his heavy boots, so that no scenes of drunkenness were enacted. After  breaking up the furniture and trappings of the craft, her people were  bundled over the side into the boats of their captors, and the torch  was set to the schooner. The boats layoff a little distance until the  roaring flames satisfied them that the \"Gaspee\" would never again  annoy American merchantmen. As the schooner's shotted guns went off  one after the other, the Americans turned their boats' prows homeward,  and soon dispersed quietly to their homes.    It is almost incredible that the identity of the parties to this  expedition was kept a secret until long after the Revolution. Although  the British authorities made the most strenuous efforts, and offered  huge rewards for the detection of the culprits, not one was discovered  until after the Colonies had thrown off the royal yoke, when they came  boldly forward, and boasted of their exploit.    After the destruction of the \"Gaspee,\" the colonists in no way openly  opposed the authority of the king, until the time of those stirring  events immediately preceding the American Revolution. Little was done  on the water to betoken the hatred of the colonists for King George.  The turbulent little towns of Providence and Newport subsided, and the  scene of revolt was transferred to Massachusetts, and particularly to  Boston. In the streets of Boston occurred the famous massacre, and at  the wharves of Boston lay the three ships whose cargo aroused the ire  of the famous Boston tea-party.    To almost every young American the story of the Boston tea-party is as  familiar as his own name,--how the British Parliament levied a tax  upon tea, how the Colonies refused to pay it; and determined to use  none of the article; how British merchants strove to force the tea  upon the unwilling colonists, and how the latter refused to permit the  vessels to unload, and in some cases drove them back to England. At  Philadelphia, Annapolis, Charleston, Newport, and Providence,  disturbances took place over the arrival of the tea-ships; but at  Boston the turbulence was the greatest.    The story of that dramatic scene in the great drama of American  revolution has been told too often to bear repetition. The arrival of  three ships laden with tea aroused instant indignation in the New  England city. Mass meetings were held, the captains of the vessels  warned not to attempt to unload their cargoes, and the consignees were  terrified into refusing to have any thing to do with the tea.    In the midst of an indignation meeting held at the Old South Church, a  shrill war-whoop resounded from one of the galleries. The startled  audience, looking in that direction, saw a person disguised as a  Mohawk Indian, who wildly waved his arms and shouted,--    \"Boston Harbor, a tea-pot to-night! Hurrah for Griffin's Wharf.\"    In wild excitement the meeting adjourned, and the people crowded out  into the streets. Other Indians were seen running down the streets in  the direction of Griffin's Wharf, where the tea-ships were moored, and  thither the people turned their steps.    On reaching the wharf, a scene of wild confusion was witnessed. The  three tea-ships lay side by side at the wharf. Their decks were  crowded with men, many of them wearing the Indian disguise. The  hatches were off the hatchways; and the chests of tea were being  rapidly passed up, broken open, and thrown overboard. There was little  noise, as the workers seemed to be well disciplined, and went about  their work in the bright moonlight with systematic activity. In about  three hours the work was done.

These poor men    Which have got little in your service, vow    To take your fortune:  but your wiser buntings,[96]    Now they are fledg'd, are gone.      DUCHESS.                         They have done wisely.    This puts me in mind of death:  physicians thus,    With their hands full of money, use to give o'er    Their patients.      ANTONIO.

Yes, from the Lord Ferdinand your brother    All love and safety.      DUCHESS.              Thou dost blanch mischief,    Would'st make it white.

Will you reject that noble and free league    Of amity and love which I present you?      DUCHESS.

I know not which is best,    To see you dead, or part with you.--Farewell, boy:    Thou art happy that thou hast not understanding    To know thy misery; for all our wit    And reading brings us to a truer sense    Of sorrow.--In the eternal church, sir,    I do hope we shall not part thus.

I prithee, who is greatest?  Can you tell?    Sad tales befit my woe:  I 'll tell you one.    A salmon, as she swam unto the sea.    Met with a dog-fish, who encounters her    With this rough language; 'Why art thou so bold    To mix thyself with our high state of floods,    Being no eminent courtier, but one    That for the calmest and fresh time o' th' year    Dost live in shallow rivers, rank'st thyself    With silly smelts and shrimps?  And darest thou    Pass by our dog-ship without reverence?'    'O,' quoth the salmon, 'sister, be at peace:    Thank Jupiter we both have pass'd the net!    Our value never can be truly known,    Till in the fisher's basket we be shown:    I' th' market then my price may be the higher,    Even when I am nearest to the cook and fire.'    So to great men the moral may be stretched;    Men oft are valu'd high, when they're most wretched.--    But come, whither you please.  I am arm'd 'gainst misery;    Bent to all sways of the oppressor's will:    There 's no deep valley but near some great hill.         Exeunt.
