In Shakespeare, besides the songs most commonly known (some of which  are by earlier authors), there are allusions to many kinds of vocal  music, and scraps of the actual words of old songs--some with  accompaniment, some without; a duet; a trio; a chorus; not to mention  several rounds, either quoted or alluded to.    It will be useful here to refer to a few of these less known examples.    _L.L.L._ I, ii, 106. The Ballad of 'The King and the Beggar.' Moth  says \"The world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages  since; but I think now 'tis not to be found; or, if it were, it would  neither serve for the writing, nor the tune.\"    _Id._ III, i, 2. Moth begins a song 'Concolinel,' which Armado calls a  'sweet air.'    Various snatches of ballads, ancient and modern--_e.g._,    (_a_) By Falstaff. _H. 4. B._ II, iv, 32, 'When Arthur first in court  began,' 'And was a worthy king.'    (_b_) By Master Silence. _H. 4. B._ V, iii, 18. 'Do nothing but eat,  and make good cheer,' etc.; 'Be merry, be merry, my wife has all,'  etc.; 'A cup of wine, that's brisk and fine,' etc. 'Fill the cup, and  let it come,' etc.; 'Do me right, And dub me knight,' etc.; 'and Robin  Hood, Scarlet, and John.'    (_c_) By Benedick, _Much Ado_ V, ii, 23. 'The god of love.'    (_d_) The old tune 'Light o' love' [see Appendix], the original words  of which are unknown. _Much Ado_ III, iv, 41, 'Clap us into \"Light o'  love;\" that goes without a burden; do you sing it, and I'll dance it.'  Here is one verse of 'A very proper Dittie,' to the tune of \"Lightie  Love\" (date 1570).         \"By force I am fixed my fancie to write,       Ingratitude willeth me not to refrain:       Then blame me not, Ladies, although I indite       What lighty love now amongst you doth rayne,       Your traces in places, with outward allurements,       Dothe moove my endevour to be the more playne:       Your nicyngs and tycings, with sundrie procurements,       To publish your lightie love doth me constraine.\"    There were several songs of the 16th century that went to this tune.  See also Shakespeare, _Gent._ I, ii, 80, and Fletcher, _Two Noble  Kinsmen_ V, ii, 54.    (_e_) Song by Parson Evans, _Wiv._ III, i, 18; 'To shallow rivers,'  for words of which see Marlowe's 'Come live with me,' printed in the  'Passionate Pilgrim,' Part xx. [see tunes in Appendix]. Sir Hugh is in  a state of nervous excitement, and the word 'rivers' brings 'Babylon'  into his head, so he goes on mixing up a portion of the version of Ps.  cxxxvii. with Marlowe.    (_f_) By Sir Toby. _Tw. Nt._ II, iii, 79, 85, 102. Peg-a-Ramsey,  'Three merry men be we,' 'There dwelt a man in Babylon,' 'O! the  twelfth day of December,' 'Farewell, dear heart.'

Song, 'Love, love, nothing  but love,' accompanied on an 'instrument' by the singer himself.    (_i_) Another, _Id._ IV, iv, 14, 'O heart, heavy heart.'    (_j_) _Lear_ I, iv, 168, two verses sung by the Fool, 'Fools had ne'er  less grace in a year.'    (_k_) Ballads by Autolycus, _Winter's Tale_ IV, ii, 1, 15.

(_l_) Duet by King Cymbeline's two sons; Funeral Song over Imogen,  _Cymb._ IV, ii, 258, 'Fear no more the heat of the sun.'    (_m_) Stephano's 'scurvy tunes,' _Temp._ II, ii, 41, 'I shall no more  to sea,' 'The master, the swabber,' etc. [Appendix]. _Id._ l. 175,  Caliban's Song, 'Farewell, master,' etc.    (_n_) Song accompanied by lute. _H._ 8. III, i. 'Orpheus.'    Besides these there are allusions to the names of various popular  tunes and catches, of which the music is still to be had. Amongst  these are--    'The Hunt is up' [Appendix]. See _Rom. and Jul._ III, v, 34. Juliet  says of the lark's song, 'that voice doth us affray, Hunting thee  hence with _hunts-up_ to the day.' Any rousing morning song, even a  love-song, was called a _hunts-up_. The tune of this song was also  sung (in 1584) to 'O sweete Olyver, leave me not behind the,' but  altering the time to 4 in a bar. See _As You Like It_ III, iii, 95.    'Heart's ease' [Appendix], the words of which are not known. Tune  before 1560. See _Romeo_ IV, v, 100.    _Id._, 'My heart is full of woe.'    _Id._ l. 125. 'When griping grief' [Appendix], by Richard Edwards,  gentleman of Queen Elizabeth's Chapel, printed in the 'Paradyse of  daynty Devises' (printed 1577). Hawkins gives four verses, the first  of which is here quoted by Shakespeare, but with several variations--         '_Where_ griping grief the hart _would_ wound,       And doleful domps the mind oppresse,       _There_ Musick with her silver sound       _Is wont with spede to give_ redresse;       Of troubled minds, for every sore,       Swete Musick hath a salve in store.'    The last verse is charming--         'Oh heavenly gift, that turnes the minde,       Like as the sterne doth rule the ship,       Of musick whom the Gods assignde,       To comfort man whom cares would nip;       Sith thou both man and beast doest move,       What wise man then will thee reprove.'    'Green Sleeves' [Appendix].    _Wiv._ II, i, 60.         _Mrs Ford._ ... I would have sworn his disposition       [Falstaff's] would have gone to the truth of his words; but       they do _no more adhere_ and _keep place_ together, than the       _Hundredth Psalm_ to the _tune of 'Green Sleeves_.'    Also see _Wiv._ V, v, 20. The tune is given in its most complete form  by Chappell, and is probably of Henry VIII.'s time. The ballad was  published in 1580, with title, 'A new Northerne dittye of the Ladye  Greene Sleeves.' Verse 1 is as follows:--         \"Alas my love, you do me wrong       To cast me off discourteously,       And I have loved you so long,       Delighting in your company.       Greensleeves was all my joy,       Greensleeves was my delight,       Greensleeves was my heart of gold,       And who but my Lady Greensleeves.\"    The 'Hundredth Psalm' (All people that on earth do dwell) will only  adhere and keep place with the tune of Green Sleeves to a certain  extent. If the reader will try to sing it to the tune in the Appendix,  he will find that in the first half he is led into several false  accents; while the second half is quite unmanageable without altering  the notes. There is, however, a form of the tune in Hawkins which is  much further off 'the truth of the words,' for it has exactly the  right quantity of _notes_, but the _accents_ are all as wrong as  possible, thus--    [Transcriber's Note: In the passage below, \"u\" represents a breve and  \"-\" a macron.]           -    u    -     u   -     u    -       _All_ peo-_ple_ that _on_ earth _do_            u     u   u    u    u    u      -    u     -       _Dwell_ sing to _the_ Lord with _cheer_ful _voice_.    It may be that this form of 'Green Sleeves' was known better than the  older one in Shakespeare's day.    'Carman's whistle' [Appendix].    _H. 4. B._ III, ii, 320. Falstaff soliloquises on Shallow's lies  concerning his wild youth.         _Fal._ He (Shallow) came ever in the rearward of the       fashion, and _sung those tunes_ ... that he heard the       _carmen whistle_, and sware--they were his _fancies_, or his       _goodnights_.... The _case of a treble hautboy_ was a       mansion for him, a court.    The Carman's Whistle was a popular Elizabethan tune, and was arranged  as a virginal lesson by Byrd. This arrangement can be had most readily  in Litolff's publication, 'Les maitres du Clavecin.'    The 'fancies' referred to above are the 'Fantazies' already remarked  on (chest of viols); and the 'Goodnights' are songs _in memoriam_, or  dirges.    'Fortune my foe.' [Appendix]. _Merry Wives_ III, iii, 62. _Falstaff_  (to Mrs Ford). 'I see what thou wert, if _Fortune thy foe_ were not,  Nature thy friend.' This old tune is at latest of Elizabeth's time,  and was sung to the ancient ballad of \"Titus Andronicus.\" The first  verse of 'Fortune my foe' is as follows:--         \"Fortune my foe, why dost thou frown on me?       And will thy favour never better be?       Wilt thou, I say, for ever breed my pain,       And wilt thou not restore my joyes again?\"    'Ophelia's Songs.' _Hamlet_ IV, v. [Appendix]. 'How should I your  true love know'; 'Good morrow, 'tis St Valentine's day'; 'They bore  him barefaste'; 'Bonny sweet Robin'; 'And will he not come again.'    The one line of 'Bonny sweet Robin' is all that remains of the song,  except the title, which is also the first line--viz., 'My Robin is to  the greenwood gone.' The line Shakespeare gives would be the last. One  tune to it is at any rate older than 1597.    Lastly, there are the old catches, 'Hold thy peace,' sung by Toby, Sir  Andrew, and Feste in _Twelfth Night_ II, iii; 'Jack boy, ho boy, news,  The cat is in the well,' etc., referred to by Grumio in _Shrew_ IV, i,  42; besides 'Flout 'em and scout em,' sung by Stephano, Trinculo, and  Caliban in _Tempest_ III, ii; and 'What shall he have that killed the  deer,' for the foresters in _As You Like It_ IV, ii, 5. The original  music of the first two, probably much earlier than Shakespeare, is in  the Appendix. A Round for four voices by John Hilton (flourished 1600)  to 'What shall he have,' is probably "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19699"],[0,"Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, \"Bréquigny, Louis Georges Oudard Feudrix (#10)"],[1,"of the role  played by these substances in the brewing process is due to the influence  which they exert on the solvent action of the water on the various  constituents of the malt, and possibly of the hops. The excellent quality  of the Burton ales was long ago surmised to be due mainly to the well water  obtainable in that town. On analysing Burton water it was found to contain  a considerable quantity of calcium sulphate--gypsum--and of other calcium  and magnesium salts, and it is now a well-known fact that good bitter ales  cannot be brewed except with waters containing these substances in  sufficient quantities. Similarly, good mild ale waters should contain a  certain quantity of sodium chloride, and waters for stout very little  mineral matter, excepting perhaps the carbonates of the alkaline earths,  which are precipitated on boiling.    The following analyses (from W.J. Sykes, _The Principles and Practice of  Brewing_) are fairly illustrative of typical brewing waters.          _Burton Water_ (Pale Ale)                      Grains per Gallon  Sodium Chloride                  3.90  Potassium Sulphate               1.59  Sodium Nitrate                   1.97  Calcium Sulphate                77.87  Calcium Carbonate                7.62  Magnesium Carbonate             21.31  Silica and Alumina               0.98         _Dublin Water_ (Stout).  Sodium Chloride                  1.83  Calcium Sulphate                 4.45  Calcium Carbonate               14.21  Magnesium Carbonate              0.90  Iron Oxide and                   0.24  Alumina  Silica                           0.26            _Mild Ale Water_.  Sodium Chloride                 35.14  Calcium Chloride                 3.88  Calcium Sulphate                 6.23  Calcium Carbonate                4.01  Iron Oxide and                   0.24  Alumina  Silica                           0.22    Our knowledge of the essential chemical constituents of brewing waters  enables brewers in many cases to treat an unsatisfactory supply  artificially in such a manner as to modify its character in a favourable  sense. Thus, if a soft water only is to hand, and it is desired to brew a  bitter ale, all that is necessary is to add a sufficiency of gypsum,  magnesium sulphate and calcium chloride. If it is desired to convert a soft  water lacking in chlorides into a satisfactory mild ale liquor, the  addition of 30-40 grains of sodium chloride will be necessary. On the other  hand, to convert a hard water into a soft supply is scarcely feasible for  brewing purposes. To the substances used for treating brewing liquors  already mentioned we may add kainite, a naturally deposited composite salt  containing potassium and magnesium sulphates and magnesium chloride.    _Malt Substitutes._--Prior to the repeal of the Malt Acts, the only  substitute for malt allowed in the United Kingdom was sugar. The quantity  of the latter employed was 295,865 cwt. in 1870, 1,136,434 cwt. in 1880,  and 2,746,615 cwt. in 1905; that is to say, that the quantity used had been  practically trebled during the last twenty-five years, although the  quantity of malt employed had not materially increased. At the same time  other substitutes, such as unmalted corn and preparations of rice and  maize, had come into favour, the quantity of these substances used being in  1905 125,671 bushels of unmalted corn and 1,348,558 cwt. of rice, maize,  &c.    The following statistics with regard to the use of malt substitutes in the  United Kingdom are not without interest.    [v.04 p.0508]    Year.

In the first place, it  was not until the malt tax was repealed that the brewer was able to avail  himself of the surplus diastatic energy present in malt, for the purpose of  transforming starch (other than that in malted grain) into sugar. The  diastatic enzyme or ferment (see below, under _Mashing_) of malted barley  is present in that material in great excess, and a part of this surplus  energy may be usefully employed in converting the starch of unmalted grain  into sugar. The brewer has found also that brewing operations are  simplified and accelerated by the use of a certain proportion of  substitutes, and that he is thereby enabled appreciably to increase his  turn-over, _i.e._ he can make more beer in a given time from the same  plant. Certain classes of substitutes, too, are somewhat cheaper than malt,  and in view of the keenness of modern competition it is not to be wondered  at that the brewer should resort to every legitimate means at his disposal  to keep down costs. It has been contended, and apparently with much reason,  that if the use of substitutes were prohibited this would not lead to an  increased use of domestic barley, inasmuch as the supply of home barley  suitable for malting purposes is of a limited nature. A return to the  policy of \"malt and hops only\" would therefore lead to an increased use of  foreign barley, and to a diminution in the demand for home barley, inasmuch  as sugar and prepared cereals, containing as they do less nitrogen, &c.  than even the well-cured, sun-dried foreign barleys, are better diluents  than the latter. At the same time, it is an undoubted fact that an  excessive use of substitutes leads to the production of beer of poor  quality. The better class of brewer rarely uses more than 15-20%, knowing  that beyond that point the loss of flavour and quality will in the long run  become a more serious item than any increased profits which he might  temporarily gain.    With regard to the nature of the substitutes or adjuncts for barley malt  more generally employed, raw grain (unmalted barley, wheat, rice, maize,  &c.) is not used extensively in Great Britain, but in America brewers  employ as much as 50%, and even more, of maize, rice or similar materials.  The maize and rice preparations mostly used in England are practically  starch pure and simple, substantially the whole of the oil, water, and  other subsidiary constituents of the grain being removed. The germ of maize  contains a considerable proportion of an oil of somewhat unpleasant  flavour, which has to be eliminated before the material is fit for use in  the mash-tun. After degerming, the maize is unhusked, wetted, submitted to  a temperature sufficient to rupture the starch cells, dried, and finally  rolled out in a flaky condition. Rice is similarly treated.    The _sugars_ used are chiefly cane sugar, glucose and invert sugar--the  latter commonly known as \"saccharum.\" Cane sugar is mostly used for the  preparation of heavy mild ales and stouts, as it gives a peculiarly sweet  and full flavour to the beer, to which, no doubt, the popularity of this  class of beverage is largely due. _Invert sugar_ is prepared by the action  either of acid or of yeast on cane sugar. The chemical equation  representing the conversion (or inversion) of cane sugar is:--      C12H22O11  +  H2O  =  C6H12O6   +  C6H12O6.    cane sugar   water    glucose      fructose                          ----invert sugar----    Invert sugar is so called because the mixture of glucose and fructose which  forms the \"invert\" is laevo-rotatory, whereas cane sugar is dextro-rotatory  to the plane of polarized light. The preparation of invert sugar by the  acid process consists in treating the cane sugar in solution with a little  mineral acid, removing the excess of the latter by means of chalk, and  concentrating to a thick syrup. The yeast process (Tompson's), which makes  use of the inverting power of one of the enzymes (invertase) contained in  ordinary yeast, is interesting. The cane sugar solution is pitched with  yeast at about 55 deg. C., and at this comparatively high temperature the  inversion proceeds rapidly, and fermentation is practically impossible.  When this operation is completed, the whole liquid (including the yeast) is  run into the boiling contents of the copper. This method is more suited to  the preparation of invert in the brewery itself than the acid process,  which is almost exclusively used in special sugar works. Glucose, which is  one of the constituents of invert sugar, is largely used by itself in  brewing. It is, however, never prepared from invert sugar for this purpose,  but directly from starch by means of acid. By the action of dilute boiling  acid on starch the latter is rapidly converted first into a mixture of  dextrine and maltose and then into glucose. The proportions of glucose,  dextrine and maltose present in a commercial glucose depend very much on  the duration of the boiling, the strength of the acid, and the extent of  the pressure at which the starch is converted. In England the materials  from which glucose is manufactured are generally sago, rice and purified  maize. In Germany potatoes form the most common raw material, and in  America purified Indian corn is ordinarily employed.    _Hop substitutes_, as a rule, are very little used. They mostly consist of  quassia, gentian and camomile, and these substitutes are quite harmless  _per se_, but impart an unpleasantly rough and bitter taste to the beer.    _Preservatives_.--These are generally, in fact almost universally, employed  nowadays for draught ales; to a smaller extent for stock ales. The light  beers in vogue to-day are less"]]]
