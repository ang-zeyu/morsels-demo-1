The library which he acquired after his accession to  the throne of England is of little consequence, for he was not the  person to purchase books when he had the means, and doubtless many of  his bookish possessions were gifts. In the library at Eton College there  is his copy of Captain John Smith's 'History of Virginia,' 1624, which  was rescued by Storer from a dirty bookseller's shop in Derby, and the  existence of many others might be traced. It is certain that 'he gave  them shabby coverings, and scribbled idle notes on their margins.' Had  his son Henry lived, he might have developed into a respectable  book-collector. We know for certain that he 'paid a Frenchman that  presented a book, L4 10s.'; and that he paid 'Mr. Holyoak for writing a  catalogue of the library which the Prince had of Lord Lumley, L8 13s.  4d.' Charles II., like his forbears, was not a book-buyer, and so far as  he is concerned we must content ourselves with repeating a little  anecdote after Dibdin, who refers to an 'old and not incurious library  at Workingham, in Suffolk,' where there was a very fine ruled copy of  Hayes's Bible, published at Cambridge, 1674, in two volumes folio; on  the fly-leaf it contains the following memorandum: 'N.B.--This Bible  belonged to K. Charles IId. and [was] given by him to Duke Lauderdale  and sold by auction w{th} y{e} rest of his Books.' In a comparatively  modern hand, below, is written in pencil:         'Hark ye, my friends, that on this Bible look,        Marvel not at the fairness of the Book;        No soil of fingers, nor such ugly things,        Expect to find, Sirs, for it _was the King's_.'    [Illustration: _Sir Robert Cotton._]    The most distinguished Metropolitan book-collector of the period was Sir  Robert Cotton, who began as early as 1588, and who had assistance from  such antiquaries as William Camden and Sir Henry Spelman. This library,  after being closed on account of the treasonable character of the  documents contained in it, passed into the possession of Cotton's son,  Sir Thomas, whose house was almost adjoining Westminster Hall. Anthony a  Wood gives a curious account of a visit he paid it, when he found its  owner practising on the lute. The key of the library was in the  possession of one Pearson, who lodged with a bookseller in Little  Britain. Wood was 'forced to walk thither, and much ado there was to  find him.' This library was removed to Essex Street, and again back to  Westminster to Ashburnham House in Little Dean's Yard, where it suffered  greatly from a fire in 1731, and what remains of it is now in the  British Museum. Sir Thomas Bodley was another collector, but few of his  accumulations appear to have come from London. The extraordinary  collection of pamphlets got together by Tomlinson, and now stored in the  British Museum, is too well known to need more than a passing reference.  It is not so generally known that Narcissus Luttrell was a very  voracious collector of broadsides, tracts, and so forth. To nearly every  one of the items he affixed the price he paid for it. In 1820, at the  Bindley sale, this extraordinary collection, ranging in date from 1640  to 1688, and comprising twelve volumes, realized the then large amount  of L781.    [Illustration: _Sir Julius Caesar's Travelling Library._]    Sir Julius Caesar, Master of the Rolls under James I., was a  book-collector of the right sort, and his box of charming little  editions of the classics, with which he used to solace himself on a  journey, is now in the safe keeping of the British Museum. Sir Julius  was born in 1557, and died in April, 1636; he possessed a fine  collection of highly interesting manuscripts, which had the narrowest  possible escape from being destroyed at the latter part of the last  century. The collection was rescued in time by Samuel Paterson, the  auctioneer, and it is now in the British Museum.    Robert Burton (the author of the 'Anatomy of Melancholy') was, like  Luttrell, also a great collector of tracts, and his library, now in the  Bodleian, is peculiarly rich in historical, political, and poetical  pamphlets, and in miscellaneous accounts of murders, monsters, and  accidents. He seems to have purchased and preserved a copy of everything  that came out. 'There is no nation,' says Johnson, 'in which it is so  necessary as in our own to assemble the small tracts and fugitive  pieces.' 'The writers of these' frequently have opportunities 'of  inquiring from living witnesses, and of copying their representations  from the life, and preserve a multitude of particular incidents which  are forgotten in a short time, or omitted in formal relations, and yet  afford light in some of the darkest scenes of state.' 'From pamphlets,'  says the same writer, 'are to be learned the progress of every debate,  and of every opinion.' And he compares the impression produced on the  mind of him who shall consult these tracts, and of another that refers  merely to formal historians, to the _difference of him who hears of a  victory, and him who sees the battle_. Archbishop Laud collected from  far and wide. John Selden, like Laud, had a distinct weakness for  learned books, and consequently could have found little to satisfy his  cravings in London. Selden, when disturbed, put his spectacles into the  book he was busy with by way of marking the place; and after his death  numbers of volumes were found with these curious book-markers. John  Felton, who murdered Buckingham, was also a book-collector in a small  way. In Lilly's catalogue for 1863 there was a copy of Peacham's  'Compleat Gentleman,' 1622, with the following on the fly-leaf: 'John  Felton, vicessimo secundo die Junii, 1622.'    A few glances, at this point, at the more material phases of  book-collecting may not be without interest. The following is one of the  earliest bookseller's statements of accounts with which we are  acquainted. It was rendered to 'the Right Honourable the Lord Conway,'  on May 31, 1638, by Henry Seile, whose shop was at the sign of the  Tiger's Head, Fleet Street:      1 Nash's Ha' wee you to Saffron Walden                  00 02 06    1 Greene's Arcadia               }                   {    1 Farewell to Folly              }                   {    1 Tullies' Love                  } These nine Bookes {    1 Lady Fitzwater's Nightingale   } were delivered to {  00 10  0    1 Mamilia                        } your Lordship at  {    1 Never too Late                 } Xs.               {    1 Groatesworth of Wit            }                   {    1 Mourning Garment               }                   {    1 Peers pennylesse supplication  }                   {    In a letter addressed to Evelyn by Dr. Cosin (afterwards Bishop of  Durham) during his exile, and dated July 18, 1651, we get a delightful  glimpse of two book-lovers doing 'a deal.' Mr. Evelyn was apparently a  man who could drive a bargain with Hebraic shrewdness. 'Truly, sir,'  expostulated mildly the excited ecclesiastic, 'I thought I had prevented  any further motion of abatement by the large offer that I made to  you. . . . If you consider their number, I desire you would be pleased  to consider likewise, that they are a choice number, and a company of  the best selected books among them all. . . . There is in your note  Pliny's \"Natural History\" in English, priced at 36s., which is worth L3;  Camden's \"Errors,\" priced at 5s. 6d., for which I have seen L1 given;  Paulus Jovius at L1, which sells now in Paris at 4 pistoles; and Pol.  Virgil at 10s., which sells here for L10; William of Malmesbury at 15s.,  for which they demand here L30, and Asser Menev, etc., at 14s., which  they will not part with here nor elsewhere abroad for L20.'    It is highly probable that the book-market was never so bad in London  as during this period; for, in addition to the above illustration, and  at about the same time, Isaac Vossius came over to this country with a  quantity of literary property, some of which had belonged to his learned  father, in the hopes of selling it; but he 'carried them back into  Holland,' where 'a quicker mercate' was expected.      III.    [Illustration: _Archbishop Usher._]    _Sic transit gloria mundi_ might well be the motto of a History of  Book-Collectors, for in by far the majority of cases great private  libraries have been formed in one generation by genuine bookworms, only  to be scattered in the next by needy legatees or in consequence of  impoverished estates. There can be no doubt that several famous  libraries have derived their origin from the mere vanity of emulating a  fashionable pursuit. Into this matter, however, it is not necessary for  us to enter, except to hazard the suggestion that if the money had not  been spent in that direction it would doubtless have been squandered in  some less worthy and enduring manner. One of the most interesting and  valuable contributions to the history of private collections of the  seventeenth century is embedded in the long and entertaining letter  which John Evelyn addressed to Mr. Pepys in August, 1689. This letter is  so accessible that it may seem superfluous to quote any part of it; but  a few of the leading points are necessary to the proper sequence of our  story. 'The Bishop of Ely has a very well-stored library, but the very  best is what Dr. Stillingfleet has at Twickenham, ten miles out of  town. . . . Our famous lawyer, Sir Edward Coke, purchased a very choice  library of Greek and other MSS., which were sold him by Dr. Meric  Casaubon, son of the learned Isaac; and these, together with his  delicious villa, Durdens, came into the possession of the present Earl  of Berkeley from his uncle, Sir Robert Cook. . . . I have heard that Sir  Henry Savill was master of many precious MSS., and he is frequently  celebrated for it by the learned Valesius, almost in every page of that  learned man's Annotations on Eusebius, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22608"],[0,"A Book for All Readers (#10)"],[1,", he never read. Burns, on opening the folio, found the leaves  sadly worm-eaten, and wrote these lines on the fly-leaf:        \"Through and through th' inspired leaves,          Ye maggots make your windings;        But O respect his lordship's taste,          And spare the golden bindings!\"    Yet no real book-lover fails to appreciate the neatness and beauty of a  tasteful binding, any more than he is indifferent to the same qualities  in literary style. Slovenly binding is almost as offensive to a  cultivated eye as slovenly composition. No doubt both are \"mere  externals,\" as we are told, and so are the splendors of scenery, the  beauty of flowers, and the comeliness of the human form, or features, or  costume. Talk as men will of the insignificance of dress, it constitutes  a large share of the attractiveness of the world in which we live.    The two prime requisites of good binding for libraries are neatness and  solidity. It is pleasant to note the steady improvement in American  bindings of late years. As the old style of \"Half cloth boards,\" of half  a century ago, with paper titles pasted on the backs, has given way to  the neat, embossed, full muslin gilt, so the clumsy and homely sheep-skin  binding has been supplanted by the half-roan or morocco, with marble or  muslin sides. Few books are issued, however, either here or abroad, in  what may be called permanent bindings. The cheapness demanded by buyers  of popular books forbids this, while it leaves to the taste and fancy of  every one the selection of the \"library style\" in which he will have his  collection permanently dressed.    What is the best style of binding for a select or a public library? is a  question often discussed, with wide discrepancies of opinion. The so  universally prevalent cloth binding is too flimsy for books subjected to  much use--as most volumes in public collections and many in private  libraries are likely to be. The choice of the more substantial bindings  lies between calf and morocco, and between half or full bindings of  either. For nearly all books, half binding, if well executed, and with  cloth sides, is quite as elegant, and very nearly as solid and lasting as  full leather; for if a book is so worn as to need rebinding, it is  generally in a part where the full binding wears out quite as fast as the  other. That is, it gets worn at the hinges and on the back, whether full  or half-bound. The exceptions are the heavy dictionaries, encyclopaedias,  and other works of reference, which are subjected to much wear and tear  at the sides, as well as at the back and corners. Full leather is much  more expensive than half binding, though not doubly so.    Every librarian or book collector should understand something of  book-binding and its terms, so that he may be able to give clear  directions as to every item involved in binding, repairing, or  re-lettering, and to detect imperfect or slighted work.    The qualities that we always expect to find in a well-bound book are  solidity, flexibility, and elegance. Special examination should be  directed toward each of these points in revising any lot of books  returned from a binder. Look at each book with regard to:--        1. Flexibility in opening.        2. Evenness of the cover, which should lie flat and      smooth--each edge being just parallel with the others      throughout.        3. Compactness--see that the volumes are thoroughly      pressed--solid, and not loose or spongy.        4. Correct and even lettering of titles, and other tooling.        5. Good wide margins.    A well-bound book always opens out flat, and stays open. It also shuts up  completely, and when closed stays shut. But how many books do we see  always bulging open at the sides, or stiffly resisting being opened by  too great tightness in the back? If the books you have had bound do not  meet all these requirements, it is time to look for another binder.    The different styles of dressing books may all be summed up in the  following materials: Boards, cloth, vellum, sheep, bock, pig-skin, calf,  Russia, and morocco--to which may be added of recent years, buckram,  duck, linoleum, and the imitations of leather, such as leatherette and  morocco paper, and of parchment. I take no account here of obsolete  styles--as ivory, wood, brass, silver and other metals, nor of velvet,  satin, and other occasional luxuries of the binder's art. These belong to  the domain of the amateur, the antiquary, or the book-fancier--not to  that of the librarian or the ordinary book-collector.    Roan leather is nothing but sheep-skin, stained or colored; basil or  basan is sheepskin tanned in bark, while roan is tanned in sumac, and  most of the so called moroccos are also sheep, ingeniously grained by a  mechanical process. As all the manufactures in the world are full of  \"shoddy,\" or sham materials, the bookbinder's art affords no exception.  But if the librarian or collector patronises shams, he should at least do  it with his eyes open, and with due counting of the cost.    Now as to the relative merits and demerits of materials for binding. No  one will choose boards covered with paper for any book which is to be  subjected to perusal, and cloth is too flimsy and shaky in its attachment  to the book, however cheap, for any library volumes which are to be  constantly in use. It is true that since the bulk of the new books coming  into any library are bound in cloth, they may be safely left in it until  well worn; and by this rule, all the books which nobody ever reads may be  expected to last many years, if not for generations. Cloth is a very  durable material, and will outlast some of the leathers, but any wetting  destroys its beauty, and all colors but the darkest soon become soiled  and repulsive, if in constant use. In most libraries, I hold that every  cloth-bound book which is read, must sooner or later come to have a  stout leather jacket. It may go for years, especially if the book is well  sewed, but to rebinding it must come at last; and the larger the volume,  the sooner it becomes shaky, or broken at some weak spot.    The many beautiful new forms of cloth binding should have a word of  praise, but the many more which we see of gaudy, fantastic, and  meretricious bindings, and frightful combinations of colors must be  viewed with a shudder.    Vellum, formerly much used for book-bindings, is the modern name for  parchment. Parchment was the only known writing material up to the 12th  century, when paper was first invented. There are two kinds--animal and  vegetable. The vegetable is made from cotton fibre or paper, by dipping  it in a solution of sulphuric acid and [sometimes] gelatine, then  removing the acid by a weak solution of ammonia, and smooth finishing by  rolling the sheets over a heated cylinder. Vegetable parchment is used to  bind many booklets which it is desired to dress in an elegant or dainty  style, but is highly unsuitable for library books. Vellum proper is a  much thicker material, made from the skins of calves, sheep, or lambs,  soaked in lime-water, and smoothed and hardened by burnishing with a hard  instrument, or pumice-stone. The common vellum is made from sheep-skin  splits, or skivers, but the best from whole calf-skins. The hard, strong  texture of vellum is in its favor, but its white color and tendency to  warp are fatal objections to it as a binding material.    Vellum is wholly unfit for the shelves of a library; the elegant white  binding soils with dust, or the use of the hands, more quickly than any  other; and the vellum warps in a dry climate, or curls up in a heated  room, so as to be unmanageable upon the shelves, and a nuisance in the  eyes of librarian and reader alike. The thin vegetable parchment lately  in vogue for some books and booklets is too unsubstantial for anything  but a lady's boudoir, where it may have its little day--\"a thing of  beauty,\" but by no means \"a joy forever.\"    Sheepskin--once the full binding for most school-books, and for a large  share of law and miscellaneous works for libraries, is now but little  used, except in its disguised forms. It is too soft a leather for hard  wear and tear, and what with abrasion and breaking at the hinges (termed  by binders the joints), it will give little satisfaction in the long run.  Under the effect of gas and heated atmospheres sheep crumbles and turns  to powder. Its cheapness is about its only merit, and even this is  doubtful economy, since no binding can be called cheap that has to be  rebound or repaired every few years. In the form of half-roan or bock,  colored sheep presents a handsome appearance on the shelf, and in volumes  or sets which are reasonably secure from frequent handling, one is  sometimes justified in adopting it, as it is far less expensive than  morocco. Pig-skin has been recently revived as a binding material, but  though extremely hard and durable, it is found to warp badly on the  shelves.    Calf bindings have always been great favorites with book-lovers, and  there are few things more beautiful--_prima facie_, than a volume  daintily bound in light French calf, as smooth as glass, as fine as silk,  with elegant gold tooling without and within, gilt edges, and fly-leaves  of finest satin. I said beautiful, _prima facie_--and this calls to mind  the definition of that law term by a learned Vermont jurist, who said:  \"Gentlemen of the jury, I must explain to you that a _prima facie_ case  is a case that is very good in front, but may be very bad in the rear.\"  So of our so much lauded and really lovely calf bindings: they develop  qualities in use which give us pause. Calf is the most brittle of the  leathers--hence it is always breaking at the hinges; it is a very smooth  leather--hence it shows every scratch instantly; it is a light and  delicate leather--hence it shows soils and stains more quickly than any  other. Out of every hundred calf-bound volumes"]]]
