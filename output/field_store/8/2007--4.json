[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19706"],[0,"Brood of the Witch-Queen (#10)"],[1," It looked to me like sheer  nervous exhaustion. He gave me quite an anxious five minutes.  Incidentally, the room was blazing hot, with a fire roaring right up  the chimney, and it smelt like a Hindu temple.\"    \"Ah!\" muttered Cairn, \"between his mode of life and his peculiar  studies he will probably crack up. He has a fragile constitution.\"    \"Who the deuce is he, Cairn?\" pursued Sir Elwin. \"You must know all  the circumstances of his adoption; you were with the late Sir Michael  in Egypt at the time. The fellow is a mystery to me; he repels, in  some way. I was glad to get away from his rooms.\"    \"You were going to tell me something about Lord Lashmore's case, I  think?\" said Cairn.    Sir Elwin Groves screwed up his eyes and readjusted his pince-nez, for  the deliberate way in which his companion had changed the conversation  was unmistakable. However, Cairn's brusque manners were proverbial,  and Sir Elwin accepted the lead.    \"Yes, yes, I believe I was,\" he agreed, rather lamely. \"Well, it's  very singular. I was called there last Monday, at about two o'clock in  the morning. I found the house upside-down, and Lady Lashmore, with a  dressing-gown thrown over her nightdress, engaged in bathing a bad  wound in her husband's throat.\"    \"What! Attempted suicide?\"    \"My first idea, naturally. But a glance at the wound set me wondering.  It was bleeding profusely, and from its location I was afraid that it  might have penetrated the internal jugular; but the external only was  wounded. I arrested the flow of blood and made the patient  comfortable. Lady Lashmore assisted me coolly and displayed some skill  as a nurse. In fact she had applied a ligature before my arrival.\"    \"Lord Lashmore remained conscious?\"    \"Quite. He was shaky, of course. I called again at nine o'clock that  morning, and found him progressing favourably. When I had dressed the  wounds--\"    \"Wounds?\"    \"There were two actually; I will tell you in a moment. I asked Lord  Lashmore for an explanation. He had given out, for the benefit of the  household, that, stumbling out of bed in the dark, he had tripped upon  a rug, so that he fell forward almost into the fireplace. There is a  rather ornate fender, with an elaborate copper scrollwork design, and  his account was that he came down with all his weight upon this, in  such a way that part of the copperwork pierced his throat. It was  possible, just possible, Cairn; but it didn't satisfy me and I could  see that it didn't satisfy Lady Lashmore. However, when we were alone,  Lashmore told me the real facts.\"    \"He had been concealing the truth?\"    \"Largely for his wife's sake, I fancy. He was anxious to spare her the  alarm which, knowing the truth, she must have experienced. His story  was this--related in confidence, but he wishes that you should know.  He was awakened by a sudden, sharp pain in the throat; not very acute,  but accompanied by a feeling of pressure. It was gone again, in a  moment, and he was surprised to find blood upon his hands when he felt  for the cause of the pain.    \"He got out of bed and experienced a great dizziness. The hemorrhage  was altogether more severe than he had supposed. Not wishing to arouse  his wife, he did not enter his dressing-room, which is situated  between his own room and Lady Lashmore's; he staggered as far as the  bell-push, and then collapsed. His man found him on the  floor--sufficiently near to the fender to lend colour to the story of  the accident.\"    Dr. Cairn coughed drily.    \"Do you think it was attempted suicide after all, then?\" he asked.    \"No--I don't,\" replied Sir Elwin emphatically. \"I think it was  something altogether more difficult to explain.\"    \"Not attempted murder?\"    \"Almost impossible. Excepting Chambers, Lord Lashmore's valet, no one  could possibly have gained access to that suite of rooms. They number  four. There is a small boudoir, out of which opens Lady Lashmore's  bedroom; between this and Lord Lashmore's apartment is the  dressing-room. Lord Lashmore's door was locked and so was that of the  boudoir. These are the only two means of entrance.\"    \"But you said that Chambers came in and found him.\"    \"Chambers has a key of Lord Lashmore's door. That is why I said  'excepting Chambers.' But Chambers has been with his present master  since Lashmore left Cambridge. It's out of the question.\"    \"Windows?\"    \"First floor, no balcony, and overlook Hyde Park.\"    \"Is there no clue to the mystery?\"    \"There are three!\"    \"What are they?\"    \"First: the nature of the wounds. Second: Lord Lashmore's idea that  something was in the room at the moment of his awakening. Third: the  fact that an identical attempt was made upon him last night!\"    \"Last night! Good God! With what result?\"    \"The former wounds, though deep, are very tiny, and had quite healed  over. One of them partially reopened, but Lord Lashmore awoke  altogether more readily and before any damage had been done. He says  that some soft body rolled off the bed. He uttered a loud cry, leapt  out and switched on the electric lights. At the same moment he heard a  frightful scream from his wife's room. When I arrived--Lashmore  himself summoned me on this occasion--I had a new patient.\"    \"Lady Lashmore?\"    \"Exactly. She had fainted from fright, at hearing her husband's cry, I  assume. There had been a slight hemorrhage from the throat, too.\"    \"What! Tuberculous?\"    \"I fear so. Fright would not produce hemorrhage in the case of a  healthy subject, would it?\"    Dr. Cairn shook his head. He was obviously perplexed.    \"And Lord Lashmore?\" he asked.    \"The marks were there again,\" replied Sir Elwin; \"rather lower on the  neck. But they were quite superficial. He had awakened in time and had  struck out--hitting something.\"    \"What?\"    \"Some living thing; apparently covered with long, silky hair. It  escaped, however.\"    \"And now,\" said Dr. Cairn--\"these wounds; what are they like?\"    \"They are like the marks of fangs,\" replied Sir Elwin; \"of two long,  sharp fangs!\"          CHAPTER VIII    THE SECRET OF DHOON      Lord Lashmore was a big, blonde man, fresh coloured, and having his  nearly white hair worn close cut and his moustache trimmed in the neat  military fashion. For a fair man, he had eyes of a singular colour.  They were of so dark a shade of brown as to appear black: southern  eyes; lending to his personality an oddness very striking.    When he was shown into Dr. Cairn's library, the doctor regarded him  with that searching scrutiny peculiar to men of his profession, at the  same time inviting the visitor to be seated.    Lashmore sat down in the red leathern armchair, resting his large  hands upon his knees, with the fingers widely spread. He had a massive  dignity, but was not entirely at his ease.    Dr. Cairn opened the conversation, in his direct fashion.    \"You come to consult me, Lord Lashmore, in my capacity of occultist  rather than in that of physician?\"    \"In both,\" replied Lord Lashmore; \"distinctly, in both.\"    \"Sir Elwin Groves is attending you for certain throat wounds--\"    Lord Lashmore touched the high stock which he was wearing.    \"The scars remain,\" he said. \"Do you wish to see them?\"    \"I am afraid I must trouble you.\"    The stock was untied; and Dr. Cairn, through a powerful glass,  examined the marks. One of them, the lower, was slightly inflamed.    Lord Lashmore retied his stock, standing before the small mirror set  in the overmantel.    \"You had an impression of some presence in the room at the time of the  outrage?\" pursued the doctor.    \"Distinctly; on both occasions.\"    \"Did you see anything?\"    \"The room was too dark.\"    \"But you felt something?\"    \"Hair; my knuckles, as I struck out--I am speaking of the second  outrage--encountered a thick mass of hair.\"    \"The body of some animal?\"    \"Probably the head.\"    \"But still you saw nothing?\"    \"I must confess that I had a vague idea of some shape flitting away  across the room; a white shape--therefore probably a figment of my  imagination.\"    \"Your cry awakened Lady Lashmore?\"    \"Unfortunately, yes. Her nerves were badly shaken already, and this  second shock proved too severe. Sir Elwin fears chest trouble. I am  taking her abroad as soon as possible.\"    \"She was found insensible. Where?\"    \"At the door of the dressing-room--the door communicating with her own  room, not that communicating with mine. She had evidently started to  come to my assistance when faintness overcame her.\"    \"What is her own account?\"    \"That is her own account.\"    \"Who discovered her?\"    \"I did.\"    Dr. Cairn was drumming his fingers on the table.    \"You have a theory, Lord Lashmore,\" he said suddenly. \"Let me hear  it.\"    Lord Lashmore started, and glared across at the speaker with a sort of  haughty surprise.    \"_I_ have a theory?\"    \"I think so. Am I wrong?\"    Lashmore stood on the rug before the fireplace, with his hands locked  behind him and his head lowered, looking out under his tufted eyebrows  at Dr. Cairn. Thus seen, Lord Lashmore's strange eyes had a sinister  appearance.    \"If I had had a theory--\" he began.    \"You would have come to me to seek confirmation?\" suggested Dr. Cairn.    \"Ah! yes, you may be right. Sir Elwin Groves, to whom I hinted  something, mentioned your name. I am not quite clear upon one point,  Dr. Cairn. Did he send me to you because he thought--in a word, are  you a mental specialist?\"    \"I am not. Sir Elwin has no doubts respecting your brain, Lord  Lashmore. He has sent you here because I have made some study of what  I may term psychical ailments. There is a chapter in your family  history\"--he fixed his searching gaze upon the other's face--\"which  latterly has been occupying your mind?\"    At that, Lashmore started in good earnest.    \"To what do you refer?\"    \"Lord Lashmore, you have come to me for advice. A rare  ailment--happily very rare in England--has assailed you.

I wonder, dear Little Fox, will you help me again?\"    \"Yes, brother, I will help you again for you were good to me. Take hold  of my tail and away we'll go.\"    So Janko took hold of the Little Fox's tail and away they went. How far  they went and how long they were gone I don't know, but it was a great  distance and a long time. However they arrived without feeling in the  least tired or breathless.    \"Now, brother,\" the Little Fox said, \"this time listen carefully to what  I tell you. Here we are in another kingdom close to the king's own  stable where the Golden Horse is guarded by thirty-six watches of twelve  guards each. When night comes you must slip into the stable and pass all  those guards when they are asleep with their eyes wide open and staring  straight at you. When you reach the Golden Horse you will see hanging  beside him a golden bridle and a common bridle made of hempen rope. Slip  the hempen bridle over the Horse's head and lead him quietly out of the  stable. But mind you don't touch the golden bridle! This time don't  forget!\"    Janko promised faithfully to remember what the Little Fox said and when  night came he crept into the stable and cautiously made his way through  the sleeping guards. He reached at last the stall of the Golden Horse.  It was the most beautiful horse in the world and the gleam of its  shining flanks was like sunshine in the dark stable.    Janko stroked its golden mane and whispered softly into its ear. The  horse responded to his touch and rubbed its muzzle against his shoulder.    Janko reached over to take the hempen bridle and then he paused. \"It  would be an outrage,\" he thought to himself, \"to put a common rope on  this glorious creature!\"    Just think of it! For the third time Janko forgot the Little Fox's  warning! I have no excuse to make for him. I don't see how he could have  forgotten a third time! But he did. He took the golden bridle instead of  the hempen one and put it over the head of the Golden Horse. The Horse  neighed and instantly all the sleeping guards awoke and came running to  the stall. They caught Janko, of course, and when morning broke carried  him to their master, the king.    He questioned Janko as the others had done and Janko answered him  simply:    \"You see I have to have the Golden Horse, O king, to exchange it for the  Golden Apple-Tree. And I have to have the Golden Apple-Tree to exchange  it for the Magic Grape-Vine that really belongs to my father. It was  stolen from him years ago and ever since then his left eye has wept over  the loss of it. Give me the Golden Horse, O king, for if you don't give  him to me I shall have to come back and try again to steal him.\"    \"But, Janko,\" the king said, \"I can't give you the Golden Horse for  nothing! But I tell you what I'll do: I will give him to you provided  you get for me the Golden Maiden who has never seen the sun.\"    With that Janko was dismissed and led out of the stable.    Janko really was awfully ashamed this time when he had again to confess  to the Little Fox that he had forgotten her warning and had touched the  golden bridle.    \"Janko! Janko!\" the Little Fox said. \"Where are your wits! Now what  shall we do?\"    Then Janko told the Little Fox of the king's offer:    \"He will give me the Golden Horse provided I get for him the Golden  Maiden who has never seen the sun. Dear Little Fox, will you help me  this one time more? I know I am very stupid but I promise you faithfully  that this time I will not forget.\"    \"Of course, brother,\" the Little Fox said, \"I'll help you again. But  this will have to be the last time. If you forget this time I won't be  able to help you any more. Take hold of my tail and away we'll go.\"    So for the fourth time Janko took hold of the Little Fox's tail and away  they went. They went and they went--I can't tell you how far! But they  weren't tired when they arrived, they weren't even breathless.    \"Now, brother,\" the Little Fox said, \"listen carefully to what I tell  you. Here we are in another kingdom close to a great cavern where for  sixteen years the Golden Maiden has been kept a prisoner under the  enchantment of her wicked mother and never allowed to see the golden  light of the sun. There are forty-eight chambers in the cavern and each  chamber is guarded by a watch of twelve guards. Steal softly through  each chamber when the eyes of all the guards are wide open and staring  straight at you. In the last chamber of all you will find the Golden  Maiden playing in her Golden Cradle. Over the Cradle stands a fearful  ghost who will cry out to you to go away and threaten to kill you. But  don't be afraid. It is only an empty ghost which the wicked mother has  placed there to frighten men off from rescuing the Golden Maiden. Take  the Golden Maiden by the hand, put the Golden Cradle on your shoulder,  and hurry back to me. But one thing: As you leave each chamber be sure  to lock the door after you so that the guards when they wake cannot  follow you.\"    Janko crept into the cavern and cautiously made his way from chamber to  chamber through the wide-eyed guards. In the forty-eighth chamber he  found the Golden Maiden playing in her Golden Cradle. He ran to take her  when a horrible creature rose above the Cradle and in hollow tones  cried: \"Back! Back! Back!\" For a moment Janko was frightened, then he  remembered that the awful creature was only an empty ghost. So he went  boldly up to the Golden Cradle and sure enough the ghost faded away.    \"You have come to rescue me, haven't you?\" the Golden Maiden cried.    She gave Janko her hand and he helped her to her feet. Then he put the  Golden Cradle on his shoulder and together they hurried out from chamber  to chamber. And I am happy to tell you that this time Janko remembered  the Little Fox's warning and locked the door of every chamber as they  left it. So they reached the upper world safely and found the Little Fox  waiting for them.    \"There's no time to lose,\" the Little Fox said. \"Put the Cradle across  my back, Janko, and take hold of my tail with one hand and give your  other hand to the Golden Maiden and away we'll go.\"    Janko did as the Little Fox said and away they all three went.    When they reached the stable of the Golden Horse, the Little Fox said:    \"It doesn't seem right to give the Golden Maiden to the king of the  Golden Horse unless she wants us to, does it?\"    The Golden Maiden at once begged them to keep her.    \"Don't give me to the king of the Golden Horse!\" she said. \"I want to  stay with Janko who has rescued me!\"    \"But unless I give up the Golden Maiden,\" Janko asked, \"how can I get  the Golden Horse?\"    \"Perhaps I can help you,\" the Little Fox said. \"Perhaps I can enchant  myself into looking like the Golden Maiden.\"    With that the Little Fox leaped up in the air, turned this way and that,  and lo! you might have thought her the Golden Maiden except that her  eyes were still fox's eyes.    \"Now leave the Maiden outside here hidden in her Golden Cradle and take  me in to the master of the stable. Exchange me for the Golden Horse and  make off at once. Then pick up the Golden Maiden in her Golden Cradle  and ride away and soon I'll join you.\"    Janko did this very thing. He took in the fox maiden and exchanged her  for the Golden Horse and instantly rode off as the Little Fox had told  him.    The king of the stable at once called all his courtiers together and  showed them the fox maiden.    \"See,\" he said, \"this is the Golden Maiden who has never seen the sun!  She is the most beautiful maiden in the world and she now belongs to  me!\"    The courtiers looked at her and admired her, but one of them a little  keener than the others said:    \"Yes, she's very beautiful and all that but look at her eyes. They don't  look like maiden's eyes but like fox's eyes!\"    Instantly at the word _fox_ the false maiden turned to a fox and went  scampering off.    \"See what you've done!\" cried the king in a fury. \"You have changed my  Golden Maiden into a fox with your nonsense! You shall pay for this with  your life!\" And he had him executed at once.    The Little Fox meantime had caught up with Janko and the Golden Maiden  and the Golden Horse. As they neared the garden of the king of the  Golden Apple-Tree the Fox said:    \"It would be a pity to give away the Golden Horse. Rightly it belongs to  the Golden Maiden and was taken from her by her wicked mother.\"    \"Don't give my Golden Horse away!\" the Golden Maiden begged.    \"But how else can I get the Golden Apple-Tree?\" Janko asked.    \"Perhaps I can help you,\" the Little Fox said. \"Perhaps I can enchant  myself into looking like the Golden Horse.\"    With that the Little Fox leaped up in the air, turned this way and that,  and lo! you might have thought her the Golden Horse except that her tail  was still a fox's tail.    When they reached the garden of the Golden Apple-Tree, Janko left the  Golden Horse and the Golden Maiden outside and took the fox horse in to  the king.    The king was delighted and at once had his servants deliver to Janko the  Golden Apple-Tree.    When Janko was safely gone, the king called all his courtiers together  and showed them the fox horse.    \"See my Golden Horse!\" he said. \"Isn't it the most beautiful horse in  the world!\"    \"It is! It is!\" they all told him.    But one courtier, a little keener than the rest, remarked:    \"What a curious tail for a horse to have! It is like a fox's tail!\"    At the word _fox_ the false horse changed back into a fox and went  scampering off.    \"See what you've done with your nonsense!\" cried the king. \"You have  lost me my Golden Horse and now you shall lose your own life!\" And he  ordered the courtier to be executed at once.    The Fox soon caught up with the real Golden Horse and with Janko and the  Golden Maiden who were holding in their arms the Golden Cradle "]]]
