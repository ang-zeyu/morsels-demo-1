She let nothing interfere with his schooling. When  times were bad, and her husband came home with his goods unsold, she  borrowed and begged, till the rebbe's fee was produced. If bad luck  continued, she pleaded with the rebbe for time. She pawned not only  the candlesticks, but her shawl and Sabbath cap as well, to secure the  scant rations that gave the young scholar strength to study. More than  once in the bitter winter, as my father remembers, she carried him to  heder on her back, because he had no shoes; she herself walking  almost barefoot in the cruel snow. No sacrifice was too great for her  in the pious cause of her boy's education. And when there was no rebbe  in Yuchovitch learned enough to guide him in the advanced studies, my  father was sent to Polotzk, where he lived with his poor relations,  who were not too poor to help support a future rebbe or rav. In  Polotzk he continued to distinguish himself for scholarship, till  people began to prophesy that he would live to be famous; and  everybody who remembered Israel Kimanyer regarded the promising  grandson with double respect.    At the age of fifteen my father was qualified to teach beginners in  Hebrew, and he was engaged as instructor in two families living six  versts apart in the country. The boy tutor had to make himself useful,  after lesson hours, by caring for the horse, hauling water from the  frozen pond, and lending a hand at everything. When the little sister  of one of his pupils died, in the middle of the winter, it fell to my  father's lot to take the body to the nearest Jewish cemetery, through  miles of desolate country, no living soul accompanying him.    After one term of this, he tried to go on with his own studies,  sometimes in Yuchovitch, sometimes in Polotzk, as opportunity  dictated. He made the journey to Polotzk beside his father, jogging  along in the springless wagon on the rutty roads. He took a boy's  pleasure in the gypsy life, the green wood, and the summer storm;  while his father sat moody beside him, seeing nothing but the spavins  on the horse's hocks, and the mud in the road ahead.    There is little else to tell of my father's boyhood, as most of his  time was spent in the schoolroom. Outside the schoolroom he was  conspicuous for high spirits in play, daring in mischief, and  independence in everything. But a boy's playtime was so short in  Yuchovitch, and his resources so limited, that even a lad of spirit  came to the edge of his premature manhood without a regret for his  nipped youth. So my father, at the age of sixteen and a half, lent a  willing ear to the cooing voice of the marriage broker.    Indeed, it was high time for him to marry. His parents had kept him so  far, but they had two daughters to marry off, and not a groschen laid  by for their dowries. The cost of my father's schooling, as he  advanced, had mounted to seventeen rubles a term, and the poor rebbe  was seldom paid in full. Of course my father's scholarship was his  fortune--in time it would be his support; but in the meanwhile the  burden of feeding and clothing him lay heavy on his parents'  shoulders. The time had come to find him a well-to-do father-in-law,  who should support him and his wife and children, while he continued  to study in the seminary.    After the usual conferences between parents and marriage brokers, my  father was betrothed to an undertaker's daughter in Polotzk. The girl  was too old,--every day of twenty years,--but three hundred rubles in  dowry, with board after marriage, not to mention handsome presents to  the bridegroom, easily offset the bride's age. My father's family, to  the humblest cousin, felt themselves set up by the match he had made;  and the boy was happy enough, displaying a watch and chain for the  first time in his life, and a good coat on week days. As for his  fiancee, he could have no objection to her, as he had seen her only at  a distance, and had never spoken to her.    When it was time for the wedding preparations to begin, news came to  Yuchovitch of the death of the bride-elect, and my father's prospects  seemed fallen to the ground. But the undertaker had another daughter,  girl of thirteen, and he pressed my father to take her in her sister's  place. At the same time the marriage broker proposed another match;  and my father's poor cousins bristled with importance once more.    Somehow or other my father succeeded in getting in a word at the  family councils that ensued; he even had the temerity to express a  strong preference. He did not want any more of the undertaker's  daughters; he wanted to consider the rival match. There were no  serious objections from the cousins, and my father became engaged to  my mother.    This second choice was Hannah Hayye, only daughter of Raphael, called  the Russian. She had had a very different bringing-up from Pinchus,  the grandson of Israel Kimanyer. She had never known a day of want;  had never gone barefoot from necessity. The family had a solid  position in Polotzk, her father being the owner of a comfortable home  and a good business.    Prosperity is prosaic, so I shall skip briefly over the history of my  mother's house.    My grandfather Raphael, early left an orphan, was brought up by an  elder brother, in a village at no great distance from Polotzk. The  brother dutifully sent him to heder, and at an early age betrothed him  to Deborah, daughter of one Solomon, a dealer in grain and cattle.  Deborah was not yet in her teens at the time of the betrothal, and so  foolish was she that she was afraid of her affianced husband. One day,  when she was coming from the store with a bottle of liquid yeast, she  suddenly came face to face with her betrothed, which gave her such a  fright that she dropped the bottle, spilling the yeast on her pretty  dress; and she ran home crying all the way. At thirteen she was  married, which had a good effect on her deportment. I hear no more of  her running away from her husband.    Among the interesting things belonging to my grandmother, besides her  dowry, at the time of the marriage, was her family. Her father was so  original that he kept a tutor for his daughters--sons he had none--and  allowed them to be instructed in the rudiments of three or four  languages and the elements of arithmetic. Even more unconventional was  her sister Hode. She had married a fiddler, who travelled constantly,  playing at hotels and inns, all through \"far Russia.\" Having no  children, she ought to have spent her days in fasting and praying and  lamenting. Instead of this, she accompanied her husband on his  travels, and even had a heart to enjoy the excitement and variety of  their restless life. I should be the last to blame my great-aunt, for  the irregularity of her conduct afforded my grandfather the opening  for his career, the fruits of which made my childhood so pleasant. For  several years my grandfather travelled in Hode's train, in the  capacity of shohat providing kosher meat for the little troup in the  unholy wilds of \"far Russia\"; and the grateful couple rewarded him so  generously that he soon had a fortune of eighty rubles laid by.    My grandfather thought the time had now come to settle down, but he  did not know how to invest his wealth. To resolve his perplexity, he  made a pilgrimage to the Rebbe of Kopistch, who advised him to open a  store in Polotzk, and gave him a blessed groschen to keep in the money  drawer for good luck.    The blessing of the \"good Jew\" proved fruitful. My grandfather's  business prospered, and my grandmother bore him children, several sons  and one daughter. The sons were sent to heder, like all respectable  boys; and they were taught, in addition, writing and arithmetic,  enough for conducting a business. With this my grandfather was  content; more than this he considered incompatible with piety. He was  one of those who strenuously opposed the influence of the public  school, and bribed the government officials to keep their children's  names off the register of schoolboys, as we have already seen. When he  sent his sons to a private tutor, where they could study Russian with  their hats on, he felt, no doubt, that he was giving them all the  education necessary to a successful business career, without violating  piety too grossly.    If reading and writing were enough for the sons, even less would  suffice the daughter. A female teacher was engaged for my mother, at  three kopecks a week, to teach her the Hebrew prayers; and my  grandmother, herself a better scholar than the teacher, taught her  writing in addition. My mother was quick to learn, and expressed an  ambition to study Russian. She teased and coaxed, and her mother  pleaded for her, till my grandfather was persuaded to send her to a  tutor. But the fates were opposed to my mother's education. On the  first day at school, a sudden inflammation of the eyes blinded my  mother temporarily, and although the distemper vanished as suddenly as  it had appeared, it was taken as an omen, and my mother was not  allowed to return to her lessons.    Still she did not give up. She saved up every groschen that was given  her to buy sweets, and bribed her brother Solomon, who was proud of  his scholarship, to give her lessons in secret. The two strove  earnestly with book and quill, in their hiding-place under the  rafters, till my mother could read and write Russian, and translate a  simple passage of Hebrew.    My grandmother, although herself a good housewife, took no pains to  teach her only daughter the domestic arts. She only petted and coddled  her and sent her out to play. But my mother was as ambitious about  housework as about books. She coaxed the housemaid to let her mix the  bread. She learned knitting from watching her playmates. She was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20897"],[0,"A Short History of England (#10)"],[1,"  called the white man \"a sky-breaker.\" The mediaeval spirit loved its part  in life as a part, not a whole; its charter for it came from something  else. There is a joke about a Benedictine monk who used the common grace  of _Benedictus benedicat_, whereupon the unlettered Franciscan  triumphantly retorted _Franciscus Franciscat_. It is something of a  parable of mediaeval history; for if there were a verb Franciscare it  would be an approximate description of what St. Francis afterwards did.  But that more individual mysticism was only approaching its birth, and  _Benedictus benedicat_ is very precisely the motto of the earliest  mediaevalism. I mean that everything is blessed from beyond, by something  which has in its turn been blessed from beyond again; only the blessed  bless. But the point which is the clue to the Crusades is this: that for  them the beyond was not the infinite, as in a modern religion. Every  beyond was a place. The mystery of locality, with all its hold on the  human heart, was as much present in the most ethereal things of  Christendom as it was absent from the most practical things of Islam.  England would derive a thing from France, France from Italy, Italy from  Greece, Greece from Palestine, Palestine from Paradise. It was not  merely that a yeoman of Kent would have his house hallowed by the  priest of the parish church, which was confirmed by Canterbury, which  was confirmed by Rome. Rome herself did not worship herself, as in the  pagan age. Rome herself looked eastward to the mysterious cradle of her  creed, to a land of which the very earth was called holy. And when she  looked eastward for it she saw the face of Mahound. She saw standing in  the place that was her earthly heaven a devouring giant out of the  deserts, to whom all places were the same.    It has been necessary thus to pause upon the inner emotions of the  Crusade, because the modern English reader is widely cut off from these  particular feelings of his fathers; and the real quarrel of Christendom  and Islam, the fire-baptism of the young nations, could not otherwise be  seized in its unique character. It was nothing so simple as a quarrel  between two men who both wanted Jerusalem. It was the much deadlier  quarrel between one man who wanted it and another man who could not see  why it was wanted. The Moslem, of course, had his own holy places; but  he has never felt about them as Westerns can feel about a field or a  roof-tree; he thought of the holiness as holy, not of the places as  places. The austerity which forbade him imagery, the wandering war that  forbade him rest, shut him off from all that was breaking out and  blossoming in our local patriotisms; just as it has given the Turks an  empire without ever giving them a nation.    Now, the effect of this adventure against a mighty and mysterious enemy  was simply enormous in the transformation of England, as of all the  nations that were developing side by side with England. Firstly, we  learnt enormously from what the Saracen did. Secondly, we learnt yet  more enormously from what the Saracen did not do. Touching some of the  good things which we lacked, we were fortunately able to follow him. But  in all the good things which he lacked, we were confirmed like adamant  to defy him. It may be said that Christians never knew how right they  were till they went to war with Moslems. At once the most obvious and  the most representative reaction was the reaction which produced the  best of what we call Christian Art; and especially those grotesques of  Gothic architecture, which are not only alive but kicking. The East as  an environment, as an impersonal glamour, certainly stimulated the  Western mind, but stimulated it rather to break the Moslem commandment  than to keep it. It was as if the Christian were impelled, like a  caricaturist, to cover all that faceless ornament with faces; to give  heads to all those headless serpents and birds to all these lifeless  trees. Statuary quickened and came to life under the veto of the enemy  as under a benediction. The image, merely because it was called an idol,  became not only an ensign but a weapon. A hundredfold host of stone  sprang up all over the shrines and streets of Europe. The Iconoclasts  made more statues than they destroyed.    The place of Coeur de Lion in popular fable and gossip is far more  like his place in true history than the place of the mere denationalized  ne'er-do-weel given him in our utilitarian school books. Indeed the  vulgar rumour is nearly always much nearer the historical truth than the  \"educated\" opinion of to-day; for tradition is truer than fashion. King  Richard, as the typical Crusader, did make a momentous difference to  England by gaining glory in the East, instead of devoting himself  conscientiously to domestic politics in the exemplary manner of King  John. The accident of his military genius and prestige gave England  something which it kept for four hundred years, and without which it is  incomprehensible throughout that period--the reputation of being in the  very vanguard of chivalry. The great romances of the Round Table, the  attachment of knighthood to the name of a British king, belong to this  period. Richard was not only a knight but a troubadour; and culture and  courtesy were linked up with the idea of English valour. The mediaeval  Englishman was even proud of being polite; which is at least no worse  than being proud of money and bad manners, which is what many Englishmen  in our later centuries have meant by their common sense.    Chivalry might be called the baptism of Feudalism. It was an attempt to  bring the justice and even the logic of the Catholic creed into a  military system which already existed; to turn its discipline into an  initiation and its inequalities into a hierarchy. To the comparative  grace of the new period belongs, of course, that considerable cultus of  the dignity of woman, to which the word \"chivalry\" is often narrowed, or  perhaps exalted. This also was a revolt against one of the worst gaps in  the more polished civilization of the Saracens. Moslems denied even  souls to women; perhaps from the same instinct which recoiled from the  sacred birth, with its inevitable glorification of the mother; perhaps  merely because, having originally had tents rather than houses, they had  slaves rather than housewives. It is false to say that the chivalric  view of women was merely an affectation, except in the sense in which  there must always be an affectation where there is an ideal. It is the  worst sort of superficiality not to see the pressure of a general  sentiment merely because it is always broken up by events; the Crusade  itself, for example, is more present and potent as a dream even than as  a reality. From the first Plantagenet to the last Lancastrian it haunts  the minds of English kings, giving as a background to their battles a  mirage of Palestine. So a devotion like that of Edward I. to his queen  was quite a real motive in the lives of multitudes of his  contemporaries. When crowds of enlightened tourists, setting forth to  sneer at the superstitions of the continent, are taking tickets and  labelling luggage at the large railway station at the west end of the  Strand, I do not know whether they all speak to their wives with a more  flowing courtesy than their fathers in Edward's time, or whether they  pause to meditate on the legend of a husband's sorrow, to be found in  the very name of Charing Cross.    But it is a huge historical error to suppose that the Crusades concerned  only that crust of society for which heraldry was an art and chivalry an  etiquette. The direct contrary is the fact. The First Crusade especially  was much more an unanimous popular rising than most that are called  riots and revolutions. The Guilds, the great democratic systems of the  time, often owed their increasing power to corporate fighting for the  Cross; but I shall deal with such things later. Often it was not so much  a levy of men as a trek of whole families, like new gipsies moving  eastwards. And it has passed into a proverb that children by themselves  often organized a crusade as they now organize a charade. But we shall  best realize the fact by fancying every Crusade as a Children's Crusade.  They were full of all that the modern world worships in children,  because it has crushed it out of men. Their lives were full, as the  rudest remains of their vulgarest arts are full, of something that we  all saw out of the nursery window. It can best be seen later, for  instance, in the lanced and latticed interiors of Memling, but it is  ubiquitous in the older and more unconscious contemporary art; something  that domesticated distant lands and made the horizon at home. They  fitted into the corners of small houses the ends of the earth and the  edges of the sky. Their perspective is rude and crazy, but it is  perspective; it is not the decorative flatness of orientalism. In a  word, their world, like a child's, is full of foreshortening, as of a  short cut to fairyland. Their maps are more provocative than pictures.  Their half-fabulous animals are monsters, and yet are pets. It is  impossible to state verbally this very vivid atmosphere; but it was an  atmosphere as well as an adventure. It was precisely these outlandish  visions that truly came home to everybody; it was the royal councils and  feudal quarrels that were comparatively remote. The Holy Land was much  nearer to a plain man's house than Westminster, and immeasurably nearer  than Runymede. To give a list of English kings and parliaments, without  pausing for a moment upon this prodigious presence of a religious  transfiguration in common life, is something the folly of which can but  faintly be conveyed by a more modern parallel, with secularity and  religion reversed. It is as if some Clericalist or Royalist writer  should give a list of the Archbishops of Paris"]]]
