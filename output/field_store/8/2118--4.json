He was rather  fastidious as to where he stepped, and with his eyes on the ground ran  directly into Fred.    \"Hi! look where you are going!\" cried the youngest of the Rover boys,  and then, to keep himself from slipping down, made a clutch at Randy's  arm. This brought Randy around, and both he and Fred bumped into the  elegantly attired youth.    \"Stop that!\" cried the stranger, and then, seeing a puddle directly in  front of him, attempted to leap over it. But his foot slipped in the  mud and down he went flat on his back with a loud splash.          CHAPTER VIII    AT COLBY HALL      \"My! look at that!\"    \"Some tumble that, eh?\"    \"Why! he sent some of that water and mud over me!\"    Such were some of the exclamations as the loudly-dressed youth went  down in the puddle of water and mud.    He was flat on his back, and it took several seconds for him to turn  over and get to his feet. The fall had attracted the attention of  everybody making for the auto-stage excepting Spouter and Jack.    \"Oh, my eye! you're certainly a sight to see,\" came from the biggest  boy in the crowd, Slugger Brown.    \"It wasn't my fault that I fell,\" retorted the unfortunate one. \"Those  fellows bumped into me and made me lose my footing,\" and he pointed to  Fred and Randy.    \"No such thing!\" burst out Fred, indignantly. \"You bumped into us  first; and you only fell when you tried to jump across the puddle and  your feet slipped.\"    \"I say it's your fault!\" spluttered the boy who had gone down. His  hands were covered with mud and water and he stood there helpless,  filled with rage.    \"Take your handkerchief and wipe your hands off,\" advised Slugger  Brown. He looked coldly at Fred and Randy. \"If they tripped you up,  they ought to have a licking for doing it.\"    \"That's the fellow who's responsible,\" answered the boy who had fallen,  and he strode up to confront Fred. \"For two pins I'd smash you on the  nose,\" he continued, hotly.    \"You leave him alone!\" broke in Randy, and doubled up his fists.    The boy who had gone down had expected Fred to back away; but the  youngest Rover bravely stood his ground.    \"Say! what's up back there?\" queried Spouter, suddenly looking around  to see why the other boys had not followed him to the auto-stage.    \"Looks to me as if somebody was going to get into a fight,\" returned  Jack. \"See! one of those fellows just made a pass at Fred. Come on,  this won't do!\" and he ran back towards the crowd that was gathering.    The boy who had fallen had, indeed, made a pass with one of his dirty  fists at Fred, but the latter had dodged the blow with ease and now he  had the loudly dressed youth by the arm.    \"You behave yourself!\" he said sharply. \"I didn't knock you down, and  you know it! I'm sorry you got yourself all dirty, but it wasn't my  fault.\"    \"You fight him, and you'll fight me too!\" broke in Randy. \"If there is  any blame in this it belongs to me as much as to my cousin.\"    By this time Jack had reached the group and pushed his way to the  front. As he caught sight of the face of the boy who had fallen, he  gave a quick exclamation.    \"Well I never! Nappy Martell!\"    \"Do you know this fellow?\" questioned Andy, quickly.    \"I've met him before,\" was the reply. \"He's Nappy Martell--the fellow I  had trouble with in front of the office in Wall Street--the fellow who  so mistreated that poor street peddler.\"    \"Oh! So this is the same chap, eh?\" broke out Randy. \"No wonder he  wants to fight with Fred. He's a regular scrapper, in spite of his fine  clothes.\"    \"What are you doing here?\" asked Nappy Martell, curiously, as he looked  at Jack. Then his gaze suddenly shifted to Fred and Randy. \"Are you  Rovers, too?\"    \"We are,\" was the quick response.    \"Humph! No wonder you knocked me down. I suppose that fellow told you  all about me?\" and Nappy pointed to Jack.    \"What's the use of quarreling about a little thing like a tumble in the  dirt?\" panted Fatty, who was almost out of breath because of his run  towards the auto-stage. \"Come on! let's get to the Hall and see who is  there.\"    \"I'm not anxious to fight,\" answered Fred, readily; \"but I don't like  this fellow's talk.\"    \"I'll talk as I please,\" blustered Martell. \"And I'll fight, too, if I  want to.\"    \"That's the talk, Nappy!\" came from Slugger Brown. \"Don't let any new  boys lord it over you. If you want to fight, go ahead.\"    \"I owe these Rovers one,\" muttered the loudly dressed youth. \"I had a  run-in with this one in New York,\" and he pointed to Jack. \"They are  all of a kind--too fresh to live.\"    \"There is no use of your talking that way, Martell,\" broke in Jack. \"We  didn't come here to scrap, but everyone of us can take his own part if  it is necessary.\"    A perfect war of words followed, and the argument proved so hot that it  looked as if there would certainly be a fight with Fred and Randy, and  possibly some of the others, on one side, and Nappy Martell, Slugger  Brown and one or two of their cronies who had come up on the other. But  then came a sudden diversion as a heavily built and military looking  man came from the main street of the town and walked towards them.    \"Cheese it, boys!\" came from one of the lads present. \"Here comes  Captain Dale. He'll report us all if he knows there's anything like a  fight going on.\"    At the announcement that Captain Mapes Dale, who was the military  instructor at Colby Hall, was approaching, the boys who had attended  the academy the term previous fell back in alarm. They knew the captain  to be a strict disciplinarian who abhorred fighting except in a  military way.    \"Well, boys, are you going up to the Hall?\" said the captain  pleasantly, as he came closer. The old pupils present saluted him and  were saluted in return.    \"Yes, sir,\" answered Spouter. And then before any of the others could  speak he added: \"Captain Dale, will you permit me to introduce some new  scholars?\" and thereupon he mentioned the Rover boys' names.    \"Glad to know you,\" said Captain Dale, and shook hands all around.    In the meanwhile Nappy Martell had dropped somewhat in the background  so that the military instructor might not notice the soiled condition  of his clothing. Then one or two other new pupils were introduced, and  the whole crowd made for the auto-stage.    The stage was a large affair, and Slugger Brown, Nappy Martell and some  of their friends kept to the front end, leaving the Rovers and their  friends together at the rear, the captain and a professor connected  with the Hall seating themselves between the two factions.    \"This row is only stopped for the time being,\" whispered Randy to Jack.  \"I think that fellow Martell is too ugly to let it drop.\"    \"He's rather a big fellow to tackle Fred,\" returned Jack. \"Why, he is  even bigger than I am!\"    \"That's the way with most bullies,\" put in Fatty. \"They don't feel like  tackling a fellow of their size. They like to pick out little chaps.\"    \"Oh, don't misunderstand me,\" returned the oldest of the Rover boys.  \"Fred may be small, but he is very strong and wiry, and he knows how to  take care of himself. But I shouldn't like to see any out and out  fighting--at least not so soon. We don't want to get a black eye before  we get settled down.\"    \"That's the talk!\" came from Andy. \"I'd rather have some fun than have  any fighting. I hope we'll find the other fellows at the Hall more  pleasant than this Martell and that great big Slugger Brown.\"    \"It's queer you didn't mention Martell to us on the train,\" remarked  Fred.    \"I thought he had left school,\" answered Spouter. \"You see, he went  home before the term closed last Spring, and I didn't know that he was  coming back.\"    \"He and Brown seem to be pretty thick,\" was Randy's comment.    \"Yes; they were always together last term, they and a fellow named  Henry Stowell. Stowell is a regular little sneak, and most of the boys  call him Codfish on account of the awfully broad mouth he's got.\"    \"Well, there's one thing sure,\" remarked Jack; \"we'll all have to keep  our eyes open for Martell, Brown and Company.\"    While on the train the Rover boys had learned that Haven Point was a  clean and compactly built town containing about two thousand  inhabitants. It was located at the head of Clearwater Lake, a beautiful  sheet of water about two miles long and half a mile wide and containing  a number of picturesque islands. At the head of the lake was the Rick  Rack River, running down from the hills and woods beyond. Up in the  hills it was a wild and rocky watercourse containing a number of  dangerous rapids, but where it passed Colby Hall it was a broad and  fairly deep stream, joining the lake at a point where there were two  rocky islands. The distance from the railroad station to the Military  Academy was a little over half a mile, along a road branching off  through the main street into a country highway bordered on one side by  the river and on the other by a number of well-kept farms, with here  and there a small patch of timber.    \"There's the Hall!\" exclaimed Spouter presently, after the auto-stage  made a turn through a number of trees and came out on a broad highway  running in a semi-circle around a large campus. \"What do you think of  the place? Looks rather fine, doesn't it?\"    All of the Rover boys gazed eagerly at what was before them. They saw a  large stone building, shaped almost in the form of a cross, the upper  portion facing the river. It was three stories in height and contained  not only the classrooms and mess hall of the institution, but also the  dormitories for the boys. To one side was a small brick building which  at one time had evidently been a private dwelling. This was now  occupied by Colonel Colby and his family and the various professors. On  the opposite side was a long, low, wooden building.    \"That's our gym,\" explained Fatty. \"You can go in there any time you  want to, do a turn on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21899"],[0,"A Rip Van Winkle Of The Kalahari (#10)"],[1,"reached its bare and boulder-strewn base. It  was perhaps three hundred feet high, of bare granite boulders heaped  one on the other, with big cavities between them, and all so rounded  and smooth that I had great difficulty in climbing it, but at length I  stood on the huge boulder poised on the summit. And from it, to my joy,  I saw glimmering away on the far northern horizon a wide stretch of  water. I rubbed my eyes and peered again and again, for often the false  mirage had raised my hopes to a frantic pitch by its glittering  deception. But this was water, and I could scarce refrain from setting  forth immediately in its direction, yet, knowing the exhausted state of  the horses I feared to do so, and seeking a hollow under a gigantic  boulder I lay through the heat of that long scorching day, parched and  longing for the water I had seen, dreaming of it when I dozed, and  gloating over it when awake. How I would revel in it; could I ever be  satisfied again to do aught but drink, and drink, and lay and soak my  sun-scorched body in it, and drink again?    Impatient as I was, the day seemed intolerably long, but at length the  sun was sufficiently low to allow of the horses trekking again,  although the poor beasts' plight was pitiful. Again I trekked through  the better part of the night, due north, and with no fear of missing  the water, for it was a wide sheet that the kopje had shown me almost a  lake it appeared to be.    Towards morning the horses were so exhausted that I could scarcely urge  them forward, and I myself but stumbled doggedly on, kept alive solely  by the knowledge that soon now I should drink.    And now, thank God, I could see the water faintly reflecting the light  in the east, and just as the sun rose I stumbled clear of the dunes.  Before me stretched a wide sheet of water, several miles in length, the  shores barren and destitute of vegetation, and without a sign of bird  or animal life. My heart mis-gave me, as I noticed how silent, dead,  and forbidding the place was: noticed, too, that the horses made no  attempt to reach the water they were dying for, but stood dejected and  spirit-less where I had let go of their bridles. A few staggering  strides and my awful doubt was confirmed. For the water was as salt as  brine!    And now for a time I gave way to absolute despair. I was exhausted, and  tortured by thirst, my lips cracked and swollen, my tongue like  leather; and I felt that when the sun reached its full power I must  perish in the horrible agony and madness of a death from thirst unless  indeed my revolver saved me the last torture! Sorely was I tempted, as  I lay there by the brink of the salt lake, where I had thrown myself  down in the agony of my disappointment.    But, thank God, I kept my sanity, and even in that terrible plight Hope  again crept into my heart.    \"T'samma!\" There might be t'samma there to the right where the dunes  were higher, and the sand redder, certainly a little dark vegetation  appeared to show in the hollows.    And so I staggered to my feet again, and leaving the horses I made my  panting, laborious way across to the dunes I had marked, on the eastern  shore of the lake. They were about half a mile away, and it seemed as  though I should never reach them, but at length I entered the hollow  between two of them, and found a few stunted bushes covered with red  berries the size of cherries, and the like of which I had never seen  before. I hesitated to eat them, for many of the desert berries are  poisonous, and almost all are bitter and acrid, but I could see no  t'samma, and so I bit one, hesitatingly at first, but as the sharp,  delicious flavor penetrated my scorched palate, ravenously.    Cool, full of juice, and of a flavor something like a black-currant,  they tasted to me the most delicious morsel that had ever passed my  lips, and all thoughts of their being poison left me, as I plucked and  ate them greedily. Most grateful they were, and soon I felt a new  being, though some poisonous properties they must have contained, for  within a few minutes I felt a rush of blood to my head, a buzzing in my  ears, and was soon staggering as though drunk. I ate no more then, and  in a short time the effects passed off, and wonderfully refreshed and  invigorated, I made my way back to the horses; who, the image of  despair, stood where I had left them.    I literally dragged them to the little bushes, which to my delight they  ate greedily; fruit, foliage, and even the bare twigs. So, again I was  respited; but I knew it to be only a respite, for the bushes were few,  and I could find no sign of others or of t'samma.    And so for days I wandered, finding a few of the berries here and  there, often half maddened and stupefied by them, my head awhirl too  with fever, alternately hoping and despairing, my sense of direction  almost gone, striving, whenever possible, to work north in my lucid  moments, but finding often by crossing my own spoor that I had been  wandering in a vain circle.    Then one afternoon, as I lay in a sort of semi-stupor beneath one of  the bushes that had yielded me a fair number of berries, a sharp gust  of wind aroused me, and looking around me I saw, whirling across the  bare dunes towards me, a huge cloud of thick opaque dust, gathering up  the loose sand as it sped, whirling high in the air and blotting out  the whole sky with its dense volume, snatching up, carrying away, and  burying deep again, all that came in its path. It was a sandstorm, and  I was in its path, here amongst the loose dunes, where escape seemed  impossible. I must fly or be buried! The horses, snorting with fear,  would have bolted had I not caught them quickly; and tired as they  were, they needed no urging on from the destroying monster that sped  relentlessly after them. The dunes were here low and open, and the red  berries on which the horses had lived of late, seemed to have maddened  and stimulated them, for they seemed to fly on the very wings of the  wind. Right before the storm they sped, the first advance gusts eddying  around us, the sky overhead already thick with the flying sand.    And now, maddened with fever, intoxicated with the strange stimulation  of the berries I too had been eating, I no longer fled in fear, but in  its place came a wild exhilaration, and I shouted aloud as I flogged  the panting horses to further efforts.    Now, to my disordered brain, the sandstorm was a legion of pursuing  fiends, that snatched at me from every gust and eddy; now, too, they  were gaining on us, and I shrieked and fought with the imaginary demons  as, in spite of the speed of the horses, the storm gained on us and  enveloped us more and more at every stride. And so for an eternity I  seemed to fly, now hemmed in with blinding sand, seeing nothing,  knowing nothing but an overpowering desire to escape from the clutching  fiends around, tortured with thirst maddened, screaming. Dark now, as  at midnight, except when a flash of forked lightning burst through the  driving chaos; now I had burst free again, as the storm veered in  another direction, yet still it threatened me and still I galloped on.  Then a snort of fright from the horses, a wild plunge forward that  almost threw me from the saddle, a sense of falling, a stunning crash  that seemed to me to be the bursting asunder of the world's very  foundations and then a merciful oblivion.         CHAPTER VI        THE CRATER THE PLEASANT BERRIES SLEEP AND THE AWAKENING         I awoke to the tortures of the damned, crushed, broken and in  agonizing pain, and with the aasvogels tearing at my face. Pinned to  the earth as by some great weight, my hands were fortunately still  free; and my revolver still in its holster; and a few shots sent the  lewd, cowardly birds flapping away. The blood was streaming from my  face, and again and again I fainted with sheer agony; moreover the  fierce midday sun beat down intolerably full in my eyes, for I lay on  my back and could move nothing but my arms. But gradually the sun  passed, a cool shadow fell across me, and although I believed I was  hurt unto death and indeed longed for death to end my agony some  modicum of relief must have come with the shade, and with it strength  and the desire to live. Moreover, it was borne upon me that from  somewhere near me came the sound of running, gurgling water;  tantalizing and maddening me in my pain and agony. I was lying on a  slope with my head lower than my limbs, and all I could see was the sky  above me; do all I could, I could not lift myself, and could not see  what pinned my lower limbs to the sand.    But, maddened more, I believe, by thirst and hearing water running,  than by the actual agony of my hurt, I at length began to work at the  sand on either side of me with my hands, scratching it away until I had  altered my position enough to enable me to turn somewhat, and raise  myself a little on one elbow.    Then I found it was my dead horses that pinned me down, for both of  them lay crushed and broken partly above me; and looking upwards I saw  that a sheer cliff of smooth rock towered straight above me, from which  the horses had evidently fallen.    I could hear the water plainer now, and though I swooned once or twice  from agony, I gradually worked my limbs clear of the incubus pressing  on them, and tried to stand up. But this I could not do, some injury to  my spine preventing me, and it was as a beast, on all fours, that I at  length made shift to crawl in search of the water I was dying for. Each  yard I crawled was agony to me, but at last I came to a rock-encircled  pool in which lay water clear and deep, and into which a tiny stream  splashed and gurgled from an overhanging cliff. Sweet and pure the  water was, and in great abundance. I peered into its dark depths and  could see the white sand glimmering at the bottom, full ten or twelve  feet below me as I judged.    I"]]]
