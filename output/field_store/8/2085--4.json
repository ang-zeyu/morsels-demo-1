From what we  see remaining, it is clear that it was (if ever built) similar to the  southern limb; and it was doubtless terminated in the same way by two  massive octangular towers. Imagine, therefore, a west front, having to  the left of the tower (as we look at it from the west) a limb  corresponding to that on the right; imagine also a line of roof,  extending over both western transepts, situated in a line with the foot  of the three lancet windows just below the clock; imagine also, further,  a roof of similar pitch over the galilee porch,[6] and, instead of the  present Decorated stage at the summit, a pyramidal spire of timber,  leaded. \"The front, with its tower thus terminated, with leaded spires  also on the four terminal towers of the transept, and with the high  roofs of the transept and western porch, must have presented a _tout  ensemble_ of the most imposing and majestic character.\"[7]    When we examine the details of the architecture we can express nothing  but the greatest admiration. The whole of the south wing of the front  belongs to the last quarter of the twelfth century. The lowest stage of  all (for there are six stages, divided by horizontal strings) is blank;  the next three are late Norman. These have in the lowest stage in each  of the two divisions an arcade of seven tall lancets; in the next above  are four broader arches, each containing two small lancets beneath; in  the upper one is a large window, under a round arch of four receding  orders, with a blank lancet on each side. In the north wing, it should  be noted, the late Norman work was carried up one stage higher than on  the south. The upper stages are Transitional in character, but they  carry on the idea of the Norman design below. Here we see first an  arcade of four trefoiled lancets, of greater depth than those  underneath; while the uppermost stage has a large pointed window, with a  lancet on each side, and above each lancet a quatrefoil in a circle. The  arches of the window and lancets are highly enriched with carving. Below  the parapet is a good corbel table. The fourth and sixth stages are  further covered with admirable diaper panel-work. The octagonal towers  at the end of the southern transept, of which that to the west is larger  than the other, have three more stages, the central one having small,  deeply sunk trefoiled lancets; the other two, large plain ones; the  uppermost tier of lancets being open. A singular effect is produced in  the third stage from the top by the lancets being divided in the centre  by the main shaft that rises from the ground at the angles of the tower.  On the south and east these shafts are not perfect.    #The Galilee Porch# is of excellent Early English work, with details  of great beauty. Certainly nowhere in England, possibly nowhere in the  world, is there to be seen so fine a porch. \"Perhaps the most gorgeous  porch of this style in existence is the Galilee at the west end of Ely  Cathedral: this magnificent specimen of the Early English style must be  seen to be duly appreciated; it combines the most elegant general forms  with the richest detail; a very happy effect is produced by the double  arcade on each side, one in front of the other with detached shafts, not  opposite but alternate.\"[8] Each side, externally, is covered with  lancet arcading in four tiers. In the upper tier the lancets are  trefoiled, with dogtooth in the moulding; in the next lower tier the  lancets are cinquefoiled, with two sets of dogtooth. The lancets in the  west face are all cinquefoiled, and the three lower tiers here have  trefoils in the spandrels. Nearly all are highly enriched with  dogtooth; while the mouldings of the west door have conventional foliage  as well. The lancets here are deeper than on the sides of the porch, and  were probably designed to hold figures. Of the three large lancets in  the west window the central one is slightly more lofty than the others.    [Illustration: DOORWAY OF THE GALILEE.]    The interior of the porch is even more beautiful; the profusion of  ornamentation on the inner doorway and the exceeding gracefulness of the  double arcades in the sides are quite unsurpassed. Both doorways are  divided by a shaft, and both have open tracery of exceptional beauty  above.    Bishop Eustace, to whom this porch is attributed, died in 1215. It is  not surprising to learn that many careful students of English  architecture have found a difficulty in believing that work of such  consummate grace and perfection of detail can belong to so early a date.  Many dated examples belonging to later years in the century, which seem  to indicate a steady growth from the simplest pointed lancets to the  elaborately cusped arches which were themselves the prelude to the  Geometric period, are adduced as evidence of the improbability of the  Early English style having, so to say, grown suddenly to perfection at  Ely. Numerous instances may, however, be found in other great minsters,  where a similar difficulty has been encountered. The probable  explanation is that the best artists and the most original designers  belonged to the monastic or cathedral bodies. They maintained what would  be described in modern language as schools of architects; and the very  best talents and energies of such bodies would naturally be brought to  bear upon any great work connected with their own church. We cannot  suppose that a new conception in architectural design sprang into  existence simultaneously in several different centres. There must have  been a beginning in some one place. The idea would spread in the  neighbourhood and in buildings where the particular abbey or cathedral  had property or influence, and would by degrees be carried to other  religious houses, and so become generally adopted, and mark a distinct  change in style. But this would take time. Sometimes we can trace how  new methods were carried about. Those who were brought over from  Normandy by the Norman kings of England to be abbots in English  monasteries, brought with them their characteristic style of building;  and at the end of the twelfth century this had entirely superseded the  old English style. One monastery passed on the new fashion to another,  as Simeon, at Ely, came fresh from the great work being carried on at  Winchester under his brother Walkelin.    It is not claimed for Bishop Eustace that his work here is the earliest  known specimen of the style finished in so perfect a form. At Lincoln  the choir was erected in the time of Bishop Hugh, who died in 1200. Some  features there have been pointed out that shew that the style was a new  departure, and that the architect was feeling his way. It is admitted  that there is not to be found an earlier dated example of the finest  Early English work than the choir at Lincoln. Second only to this the  galilee porch at Ely may take rank. Other erections of very nearly the  same date have admirable work, such as the lady-chapel at Winchester and  the east end of Chichester; but there is nothing in either of those  examples to compare with the elaborate richness of detail at Ely.    #The West Tower# has six stages of Early English date above the  porch. Three of these have each three separate lancet windows, the two  lower having banded shafts. In the projecting corner turrets are lancets  of similar design in the two upper stages, but not so broad and not  pierced for windows; while in the lowest stage in the turrets above the  porch are several tall, thin, trefoiled lancets, having more the  character of Transition Norman work. Between the window ranges are  arcades of short, deep, trefoiled lancets; at the top below the parapet  and corbel table are five quatrefoils in circles, one not pierced. On  the north and south sides are but two ranges of windows. The tower must,  of course, have been built before the porch, and may consequently be  assigned to the last years of the twelfth century; and it is a noble  specimen for such an early date. The upper Decorated stage consists of  an octagon having a fine window of three lights in each face, the part  below the transom not glazed, and an open parapet above. At the corners  are octagonal turrets, with open lights above the level of the central  portion, and plain parapets. The turrets are detached from the centre,  except at the top and bottom. The latest calculations give the height of  these turrets as 215 feet. This would be nearly the same as the central  tower at Durham.    The Early English tower must have had some erection above it, probably  of wood, of a low pyramidal form. But before long it was replaced by  something of a better style. Bishop Northwold (1229-1254) \"construxit de  novo turrim ligneam versus galileam ab opere cementario usque ad  summitatem.\" This was in turn removed when the present octagonal stage  was erected, about the year 1400. This addition was soon found to be a  source of danger, and it threatened the destruction of the whole tower.  For several years, in the middle of the fifteenth century, the tower was  undergoing repairs. Before this the upper part had been braced together  with frames of timber. In the interior, as will be seen hereafter, inner  arches of great strength were inserted under the original Norman arches  of the tower. A light and thin wooden spire was unwisely placed at the  top, and this was in 1757 reported to be in bad condition, and injurious  to the tower. It was not finally restored till about 1801, when the  whole of the upper portion, including the corner turrets, was materially  strengthened.    [Illustration: THE WEST TOWER FROM THE SOUTH.]    On the west face of the buttress, built against the tower in the north,  can be seen some panels of Perpendicular date. These have suggested the  idea that it was in contemplation to rebuild "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21007"],[0,"The Bird Study Book (#10)"],[1,"wrought among birds by cold, snowy weather.  Early in the year 1895  a long, severe cold spell, accompanied by snow and sleet, almost  exterminated the Bluebird in the eastern United States.  The bodies of no  less than twenty-four of these birds were found in the cavity of one  tree.  It looked as if they had crowded together with the hope of keeping  warm.  It was not the cold alone which had destroyed the birds: a famine  had preceded the cold snap, and the birds, weakened by hunger, were ill  prepared to withstand its rigours.    One winter some years ago a prolonged freezing {91} wave swept over our  South Atlantic States, and played havoc with the Woodcock in South  Carolina.  This is what happened: the swamps in the upper reaches of the  Pee Dee, the Black, and Waccamaw rivers were frozen solid, and the  Woodcock, that in winter abound in this region, were thus driven to the  softer grounds farther downstream.  The cold continued and the frozen  area followed the birds.  The Woodcock, unable to drive their long bills  into the once-responsive mud, were forced to continue their flight toward  the coast in search of open ground where worms could be found.  When at  length they reached Winyaw Bay, where these rivers converge, they were at  the point of exhaustion.  Thousands of the emaciated birds swarmed in the  streets and gardens of Georgetown.  They were too weak to fly, and  negroes killed them with sticks and offered baskets of these wasted  bodies, now worthless as food, for a few cents a dozen.  Several  shipments were made to Northern cities by local market men, who hoped to  realize something by their industry.    {92}    Of the Wild Ducks which remain North in the winter many die because of  the freezing of the water in which they must dive or dabble for their  food.  On the morning of February 11, 1912, Cayuga Lake in western New  York State was found to be covered with a solid sheet of ice from end to  end.  It is a large body of water, having an area of nearly sixty-seven  square miles.  It rarely freezes over--only once in about twenty years,  as the records show.  The Ducks inhabiting the lake at this time were  caught unawares.  Many of them moved quickly to more Southern waters, but  others tarried, evidently hoping for better times.  Subsequently a few  air-holes opened and the Ducks gathered about them, but there was little  food even here, and numbers starved to death.  One observer who went out  to the air-holes reported examining the bodies of twenty-eight  Canvas-backs and nineteen Scaups in addition to many others such as  Redheads and Golden-eyes.  His survey was not exhaustive and the Gulls  had doubtless removed many bodies from the territory {93} he visited.  When the surface of lakes and bays freezes suddenly in the night Ducks  are sometimes caught and held fast by the ice adhering to their feathers  and legs.  In this condition they are utterly unable to escape the  attacks of man and beast, and in the latitude of New York captures in  this way are now and then reported.    _Wild Fowl Destroyed in the Oil Fields._--In the oil fields of the  Southwest and old Mexico the surface of many ponds is covered with oil  into which unsuspecting flocks of Ducks alight never again to emerge  until their dead bodies drift to the shore.  It was on November 27, 1912,  that the naval tank ship _Arethusa_ steamed into the harbour of  Providence, Rhode Island, with a cargo of crude oil.  For several days  following her bilge pumps sent overboard a continuous stream of water and  oil seepage.  On December 3d the following news-item appeared in the  _Providence Daily Bulletin_, \"The east shore of the lower harbour and  upper bay, from Wilkesbarre pier to Riverside and below, is strewn with  the bodies of dead {94} Wild Ducks, which began to drift ashore  yesterday.  The wildfowl came into the bay in enormous flocks about the  middle of November and have since been seen flying about or feeding in  the shallow water, as is usual at this time of year.  As no such amount  of oil, it is believed, was ever let loose into the bay at one time  before, and as Ducks along the shore, dead from poisoning, have never  been seen before, it is reasonable to connect the two occurrences.\"    _Hunting Winter Birds._--Birds are to be found in winter in nearly every  neighbourhood, and it is astonishing under what adverse natural  conditions one may find them.  As I write these lines on a dark February  afternoon, here in New York City, I can see through the window a Starling  sitting ruffled up on the bare twig of an elm tree.  Every minute or two  he calls, and as he is looking this way perhaps he is growing impatient  for the little girl of the house to give him his daily supply of crumbs.  A few minutes ago there was a Downy on the trunk of the same tree, and  out over the Harlem River I see a flock of {95} Herring Gulls passing, as  their custom is in the late afternoon.    Several years ago Dr. Frank M. Chapman sent out a notice to bird students  that he would be pleased to have them make a record of the birds to be  seen in their different neighbourhoods on Christmas.    Many responded, and he published their reports in his magazine  _Bird-Lore_.  This aroused so much interest that bird observers all over  the country now have a regular custom of following this practice.  In the  January-February, 1916, issue of _Bird-Lore_ appears the results of the  last census which was taken on December 25, 1915.  By examining this one  may get a good idea of the birds to be found in various communities at  this season.  Some of the lists were very large, ninety-three specimens  being noted in the one sent by Ludlow Griscom, from St. Marks, Florida.  The largest number reported by any of the observers was 221, seen in the  neighbourhood of Los Angeles, California.  The following are reports from  typical sections:    {96}    _Wolfville, N.
