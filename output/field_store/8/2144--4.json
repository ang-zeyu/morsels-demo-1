He charged Merlin to go and espy through all the land of  Britain for another fifty knights, so that the tale of the noble  company of the Round Table should be complete.    Now, it chanced that while Arthur sat in the hall of his palace at  London, waiting for Gwenevere to come to him, and for Merlin to return  from his quest, King Ban, who had aided him in his fierce battle  against the eleven kings, sent his young son Lancelot to Arthur's  court, to learn knightly deeds and noble prowess.    None knew who he was but Arthur, who kept the matter secret. Many had  smiled at the huge limbs of Lancelot, until his great strength had  caused them to respect him; and being but a young man he had not yet  got all the courtly bearing and noble manners for which in later time  he was famous throughout all Christendom. So that many knights and  ladies smiled sourly upon him, but others saw that he would shortly  prove a fine man of his hands, full courteous and gentle, and of a  noble nature and great presence.    At the court was also young Gawaine, son of King Lot, and nephew of the  king. Both Lancelot and Gawaine were as yet not knighted, but together  they tilted at each other in the lists beyond the walls, and spent  their days in sword-play and all knightly exercises. Lancelot was the  stronger and the better fighter; and though Gawaine never overcame him,  yet did they twain love each other passing well.    Now Gawaine went to the king one day, and asked of him a gift, and King  Arthur said he would grant it.    'Sir,' said Gawaine, while Lancelot stood a little way off, fondling  the hounds that licked at his hand, 'I ask that ye will make me knight  the same day that ye shall wed fair Gwenevere.'    'I will do it with a good will,' said the king. 'And Lancelot,' he  said, calling to the young man, 'have ye no boon to ask of me?'    'Not at this time, sir,' replied Lancelot, 'but in a little while I  may.'    Into the hall next day, as the king sat at dinner, came an old woman,  bent and feeble, but with reverend white hair and gentle face, and she  kneeled at the king's feet.    'What is it, dame?' said Arthur. 'What is't you crave?'    'Justice, lord king,' she said in a weak voice, while the tears gushed  from her eyes. 'Or else I die beside the gate where you do give the  justice that all men praise.'    'Who hath done evil to you?' said the king.    'Sir Caradoc of the Dolorous Tower in the Marsh,' replied the old  woman. 'I and my son, lord, did build a little hut of wattle on a  little plot which we banked from the marsh, near the great wall of the  rich baron, deeming it safe to rest within the shadow of the strong  lord, and though his hard rule was hateful to those whom he oppressed,  we were so humble that we thought he would not notice us. And meagrely  we reared our living from the ground, and sold our poor herbs to Sir  Caradoc his steward, or to the people in the villages in the marsh  about us. But soon the Lord Caradoc desired the land on which our  little hut was standing, to make his lands the broader. He tore our  poor home down, and scattered all, and thrust us out to wander in the  marshes; and when my poor son pleaded with the lord, he had him  whipped, and he was brought and cast half dead at my feet as I waited  outside the hall. Now if thou givest us not justice, we shall surely  die.'    'Doth any know Sir Caradoc?' asked the king of his knights.    'Yea, sir,' said one, 'and he is a great man of his hands, fierce and  bold, of strong family, and his brother is Sir Turquine of Camber, who  tried to slay thee at Caerleon, and was with the eleven kings in  battle. Sir Caradoc liveth in a strong tower beyond the marshes to the  south of the river, and he slayeth all that desire to pass them, unless  they pay him all he demands.'    'What!' said the king with fierce anger, 'within a few miles of this my  justice-seat doth such tyranny rule unchecked, and ye tell me naught of  it? Are ye then more fearful of this marsh robber than of me your  king?'    The knights hung their heads abashed, and were silent.    Then Lancelot came and stood before the king.    'Let me, sir king, go and summon this tyrant to your presence,' he  said, 'so that this poor dame may have justice, and that ye may punish  him for his oppression.'    'I fear me, Lancelot, thou art over young for so fierce a knight,' said  Arthur.    'I shall but bear thy words, sir,' said Lancelot, and he will not harm  thy messenger.'    'Take two stout men-at-arms with you, then,' said Arthur, 'and say to  this Sir Caradoc that if he come not back with thee to answer unto me,  I will come and take his life and burn his evil tower to the ground.'    Many of the younger men that had despite against Lancelot for his  greater prowess at the sword and the lance thought that now, indeed,  they would be ridded of him, for they deemed Sir Caradoc would slay  him.    Two days later came young Lancelot back with his two men-at-arms, and  with them, bound upon a great horse, was a full fierce and raging  knight, red of face, large of body, his clothes all tossed and torn,  and his mouth full of dire threatenings against Lancelot. Men made way  for them marvelling, and together Lancelot and his captive rode up the  hall to the king.    'Here, lord, is Sir Caradoc of the Dolorous Tower in the Marsh,' said  Lancelot. 'He would not come when I gave him your message, so I bided  my time until he was sunk in wine, and was sleeping alone, and I have  brought him secretly from his hold. Now, lord king, I think Sir Caradoc  would joust with me, if you will give me knighthood.'    'Joust with thee, thou smooth-faced boy!' cried Sir Caradoc, straining  at his bonds. 'I will spit thee on my lance if I may get at thee, and  when thou art slain I will fight with this little king of thine--and  his death shall wipe out this insult thou hast put upon me!'    At his rage and fierce bearing men marvelled and many were afeared,  seeing that Sir Caradoc was great in lands and kinsmen, and big of his  body.    'Thou art full young, Lancelot,' said Arthur, 'to joust with so strong  a knight. Let an older man have ado with him.'    'Sir king,' cried Lancelot eagerly, 'I claim the first battle with this  strong tyrant. He is my captive, and I claim it.'    'Have it as ye will,' said Arthur, 'and God speed you. But I misdoubt  me much 'twill end in your sorrow.'    'Ay, and thine too, thou gentle lady's knight!' sneered Sir Caradoc.    'Peace, man, peace,' said the king sternly. 'I think God will fight in  this battle, for I have inquired far, and the tale of thy evil deeds is  over-full.'    Therewith King Arthur made young Lancelot knight, and men eagerly  rushed away to the tilting-ground to see the battle between the virgin  knight, Sir Lancelot, and the old robber knight, Sir Caradoc. And when  Sir Caradoc was released and armed, he laughed and shook his lance, so  sure was he of revenge right speedily.    Then they hurtled together most fiercely, and young Sir Lancelot was  thrust from his horse by Sir Caradoc. Quickly he rose from the ground,  and dressed his shield and drew his sword, and cried, 'Alight, Sir  Caradoc, for I will fight thee on foot.' But Sir Caradoc, being  traitorous, rode at Sir Lancelot with his spear, as if he would pin him  to the earth, and the young knight had much ado to avoid him. All the  knights cried out upon Sir Caradoc for a foul knight, and for shame he  threw down his lance and alighted, and rushed at Sir Lancelot full  fiercely, in order to slay him instantly.    But that was not easily to be done, for however wise Sir Caradoc was in  sword-play, he was mad with wrath, and therefore thought of naught but  to slay his enemy instantly. He raged like a wild boar, and gave Sir  Lancelot many evil strokes, yet never did he beat down the young  knight's guard. Soon men perceived that Sir Caradoc's great fierceness  was causing him to make blind strokes, and then Sir Lancelot seemed the  more wary. Suddenly they saw the young knight leap forward, and beat so  heavily upon the other's helm that it cracked. Sir Caradoc strove to  guard himself, but Sir Lancelot was so wroth, and so mighty of his  blows, that he could not. At last Sir Lancelot beat him to his knees,  and then thrust him grovelling to the ground. Sir Lancelot bade him  yield, but he would not, and still sought to thrust at the other. Then  the young knight struck at him between the neck and the head and slew  him.    Both the knights and the common people shouted with joy, and acclaimed  Sir Lancelot as a noble and mighty knight. But the young man was full  modest, and withdrew from the press. King Arthur gave unto him the  Dolorous Tower and the lands which had belonged to Sir Caradoc, and  Lancelot caused the old dame and her son to be given a fair piece of  land and a hut, and many other wrongs and evil customs that had been  done by Sir Caradoc, Sir Lancelot caused to be righted.    The kinsmen of Sir Caradoc went apart and conspired to have Sir  Lancelot slain, but for a long time they could not come at him.    Then, when the queen came unto King Arthur, there was great feasting  and joustings and merry games, and Sir Lancelot, for his knightly  prowess in the lists, and for his gentle courtesy and noble manners to  all, both poor and rich, high and low, was sought by many, and for some  time rested himself in knightly games and play.    Then, on a day in June, when a sudden wind from a lattice blew upon his  face as he laughed and jested with ladies and knights in silks and rich  garments, he bethought him of the fair green woods and the wide lands  through which lonely roads were winding. And departing from the hall  forthwith, he bade his horse and arms be brought to him, and rode into  a deep forest, and thought to prove himself in strange adventures.

And then she was constrained, as his servant, to gather the  money and to deliver it unto him.\"[77]    [Footnote 76: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 55.]    [Footnote 77: _Ibid._, p. 105.]    For some reason, however, the debt was not settled, and Hide continued  his futile demands. Several times Burbage offered to pay the sum in  full if the title of the Theatre were made over to his son Cuthbert  Burbage; and Brayne's widow made similar offers in an endeavor to gain  the entire property for herself. But Hide, who seems to have been an  honest man, always declared that since Burbage and Brayne \"did jointly  mortgage it unto him\" he was honor-bound to assign the property back  to Burbage and the widow of Brayne jointly. So matters stood for a  while.    At last, however, in 1589, Hide declared that \"since he had forborne  his money so long, he could do it no more, so as they that came first  should have it of him.\" Thereupon Cuthbert Burbage came bringing not  only the money in hand, but also a letter from his master and patron,  Walter Cape, gentleman usher to the Lord High Treasurer, requesting  Hide to make over the Theatre to Cuthbert, and promising in return to  assist Hide with the Lord Treasurer when occasion arose. Under this  pressure, Hide accepted full payment of his mortgage, and made over  the title of the property to Cuthbert Burbage. Thus Brayne's widow was  legally excluded from any share in the ownership of the Theatre. Myles  deposed, in 1592, that henceforth Burbage \"would not suffer her to  meddle in the premises, but thrust her out of all.\"    This led at once to a suit, in which Robert Myles acted for the widow.  He received an order from the Court of Chancery in her favor, and  armed with this, and accompanied by two other persons, he came on  November 16, 1590, to Burbage's \"dwelling house near the Theatre,\"  called to the door Cuthbert Burbage, and in \"rude and exclamable sort\"  demanded \"the moiety of the said Theatre.\" James Burbage \"being within  the house, hearing a noise at the door, went to the door, and there  found his son, the said Cuthbert, and the said Myles speaking loud  together.\" Words were bandied, until finally Burbage, \"dared by the  same Myles with great threats and words that he would do this and  could do that,\" lost his temper, and threatened to beat Myles off the  ground.[78]    [Footnote 78: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 57, 60, 62.]    Next the widow, attended by Robert Myles and others, visited the home  of the Burbages \"to require them to perform the said award\" of the  court. They were met by James Burbage's wife, who \"charged them to go  out of her grounds, or else she would make her son break their knaves'  heads.\" Aroused by this noise, \"James Burbage, her husband, looking  out a window upon them, called the complainant [Widow Brayne]  murdering whore, and ... the others villaines, rascals, and knaves.\"  And when Mistress Brayne spoke of the order of the court, \"he cryed  unto her, 'Go, go. A cart, a cart for you! I will obey no such order,  nor I care not for any such orders, and therefore it were best for you  and your companions to be packing betimes, for if my son [Cuthbert]  come he will thump you hence!'\" Just then Cuthbert did \"come home, and  in very hot sort bid them get thence, or else he would set them  forwards, saying 'I care for no such order. The Chancery shall not  give away what I have paid for.'\" And so, after \"great and horrible  oathes\" by James Burbage and his son, the widow and her attendants  \"went their ways.\"[79]    [Footnote 79: _Ibid._, p. 121.]    Receiving thus no satisfaction from these visits to the home of James  Burbage, the widow and Robert Myles came several times to the Theatre,  bearing the order of the court in their hands; but each time they were  railed upon and driven out. Finally, the widow, with her ever-faithful  adjutant Robert Myles, his son Ralph, and his business partner,  Nicholas Bishop, went \"to the Theatre upon a play-day to stand at the  door that goeth up to the galleries of the said Theatre to take and  receive for the use of the said Margaret half of the money that should  be given to come up into the said gallery.\" In the Theatre they were  met by Richard Burbage, then about nineteen years old, and his mother,  who \"fell upon the said Robert Myles and beat him with a broom staff,  calling him murdering knave.\" When Myles's partner, Bishop, ventured  to protest at this contemptuous treatment of the order of the court,  \"the said Richard Burbage,\" so Bishop deposed, \"scornfully and  disdainfully playing with this deponent's nose, said that if he dealt  in the matter, he would beat him also, and did challenge the field of  him at that time.\" One of the actors then coming in, John  Alleyn--brother of the immortal Edward Alleyn--\"found the foresaid  Richard Burbage, the youngest son of the said James Burbage, there  with a broom staff in his hand; of whom when this deponent Alleyn  asked what stir was there, he answered in laughing phrase how they  came for a moiety, 'But,' quod he (holding up the said broom staff)  'I have, I think, delivered him a moiety with this, and sent them  packing.'\" Alleyn thereupon warned the Burbages that Myles could bring  an action of assault and battery against them. \"'Tush,' quod the  father, 'no, I warrant you; but where my son hath now beat him hence,  my sons, if they will be ruled by me, shall at their next coming  provide charged pistols, with powder and hempseed, to shoot them in  the legs.'\"[80]    [Footnote 80: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 63, 97, 100, 101, 114.]    But if the Burbages could laugh at the efforts of Myles and the widow  to secure a moiety of the Theatre from Cuthbert, they were seriously  troubled by the continued refusal of Gyles Alleyn to renew the lease.  James Burbage many times urged his landlord to fulfill the original  agreement, but in vain. At last, Alleyn, \"according to his own will  and discretion, did cause a draft of a lease to be drawn, wherein were  inserted many unreasonable covenants.\" The new conditions imposed by  Alleyn were: (1) that Burbage should pay a rental of L24 instead of  L14 a year; (2) that he should use the Theatre as a place for acting  for only five years after the expiration of the original  twenty-one-year lease, and should then convert the building to other  uses; (3) that he should ultimately leave the building in the  possession of Alleyn.[81] The first and third conditions, though  unjust, Burbage was willing to accept, but the second condition--that  he should cease to use the Theatre for plays--he \"utterly refused\" to  consider.    [Footnote 81: See Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 195, 212, 216, 250, 258,  _et al._]    Finally, perceiving that it was useless to deal further with Alleyn,  he made plans to secure a new playhouse in the district of  Blackfriars, a district which, although within the city walls, was not  under the jurisdiction of the city authorities. He purchased there the  old Blackfriars refectory for L600, and then at great expense made the  refectory into a playhouse. But certain influential noblemen and  others living near by protested against this, and the Privy Council  ordered that the building should not be used as a public playhouse.  All this belongs mainly to the history of the Second Blackfriars  Playhouse, and for further details the reader is referred to the  chapter dealing with that theatre.    Shortly after the order of the Privy Council cited above, Burbage  died, just two months before the expiration of his lease from Alleyn;  and the Theatre with all its troubles passed to his son Cuthbert. By  every means in his power Cuthbert sought to induce Alleyn to renew the  lease: \"Your said subject was thereof possessed, and being so  possessed, your said servant did often require the said Alleyn and  Sara his wife to make unto him the said new lease of the premises,  according to the agreement of the said indenture.\" Cuthbert's  importunity in the matter is clearly set forth in a deposition by  Henry Johnson, one of Alleyn's tenants. It was Alleyn's custom to come  to London at each of the four pay terms of the year, and stop at the  George Inn in Shoreditch to receive his rents; and on such occasions  Johnson often observed Cuthbert's entreaties with Alleyn. In his  deposition he says that he \"knoweth that the said complainant  [Cuthbert Burbage] hath many times labored and entreated the defendant  [Gyles Alleyn] to make him a new lease of the premises in question,  for this deponent sayeth that many times when the defendant hath come  up to London to receive his rents, he, this deponent, hath been with  him paying him certain rent; and then he hath seen the plaintiff with  his landlord, paying his rent likewise; and then, finding opportunity,  the plaintiff would be intreating the defendant to make him a new  lease of the premises in question; and sayeth that it is at least  three years since [i.e., in 1597] he, this deponent, first heard the  plaintiff labor and entreat the defendant for a new lease.\"[82]  Cuthbert tells us that Alleyn did not positively refuse to renew the  lease, \"but for some causes, which he feigned, did defer the same from  time to time, but yet gave hope to your subject, and affirmed that he  would make him such a lease.\"[83]    [Footnote 82: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 246.]    [Footnote 83: _Ibid._, p. 184.]    Cuthbert's anxiety in this matter is explained by the fact that the  old lease gave him the right to tear down the Theatre and carry away  the timber and other materials to his own use, provided he did so  before the expiration of the twenty-one years. Yet, relying on  Alleyn's promises"]]]
