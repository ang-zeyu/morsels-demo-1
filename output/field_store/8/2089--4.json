Our ignorance on this  point will be so complete that we shall not even be able to know  whether any state which we call mental may not be physical. The  distinction between physical and mental will have lost its _raison  d'etre_, since the existence of the physical is necessary to give a  meaning to the existence of the mental. We are brought, whether we  like it or not, to an experimental monism, which is neither psychical  nor physical; panpsychism and panmaterialism will have the same  meaning.[16]    But this monism can be only transitory, for it is more in the words  than in the thing itself. It is brought about by the terminology  adopted, by the resolution to call mental all the phenomena that it is  possible to know. Luckily, our speculations are not at the mercy of  such trifling details as the details of language. Whatever names may  be given to this or that, it will remain none the less true that  nature will continue to present to us a contrast between phenomena  which are flints, pieces of iron, clods of earth, brains--and some  other phenomena which we call states of consciousness. Whatever be the  value of this dualism, it will have to be discussed even in the  hypothesis of panpsychism.[17] As for myself, I shall also continue to  make a distinction between what I have called objects of cognition and  acts of cognition, because this is the most general distinction that  can be traced in the immense field of our cognitions. There is no  other which succeeds, to the same degree, in dividing this field into  two, moreover, this distinction is derived directly from observation,  and does not depend for its validity on the physical or mental nature  of the objects. Here is, then, a duality, and this duality, even when  it does not bear the names physical and moral, should necessarily play  the same part, since it corresponds to the same distinction of fact.    In the end, nothing will be changed, and this second opinion must  gradually merge into the one first stated by me, and of which I take  the responsibility. We may, therefore, put it out of consideration.    I have mentioned a third opinion, stating that it appeared to me to be  radically false. Outwardly it is the same as the last; looked at  superficially it seems even confused with it; but, in reality it is of  a totally different nature. It supposes that sensation is an entirely  psychological phenomenon. Then, having laid down this thesis, it  undertakes to demonstrate it by asserting that sensation differs from  the physical fact, which amounts to supposing that we cannot know  anything but sensations, and that physical facts are known to us  directly and by another channel. This is where the contradiction comes  in. It is so apparent that one wonders how it has been overlooked by  so many excellent minds. In order to remove it, it will be sufficient  to recollect that we do not know anything other than sensations; it is  therefore impossible to make any distinction between the physical  object and the object of cognition contained in every sensation. The  line of demarcation between the physical and the moral cannot pass  this way, since it would separate facts which are identical.    We can, therefore, only deplore the error of all those who, to express  the difference between mind and matter, have sought a contrast between  sensation and physical facts. Physiologists, with hardly an exception,  have fallen into this error; when contemplating in imagination the  material working of the brain, they have thought that between the  movement of cerebral matter and sensation there was a gulf fixed. The  comparison, to have been correct, required to be presented in quite  another way. A parallel, for instance, should have been drawn between  a certain cerebral movement and the act of consciousness, and there  should have been said: \"The cerebral motion is the physical  phenomenon, the act of consciousness the psychical.\" But this  distinction has not been made. It is sensation _en bloc_ which is  compared to the cerebral movement, as witness a few passages I will  quote as a matter of curiosity, which are borrowed from philosophers  and, especially, from physiologists.    While philosophers take as a principle of idealism, that the mental  can only know the mental, physiologists take, as a like principle,  the heterogeneity existing, or supposed to exist, between the nerve  impression and the sensation. \"However much we may follow the  excitement through the whole length of the nerve,\" writes Lotze,[18]  \"or cause it to change its form a thousand times and to metamorphose  itself into more and more delicate and subtle movements, we shall  never succeed in showing that a movement thus produced can, by its  very nature, cease to exist as movement and be reborn in the shape of  sensation....\" It will be seen that it is on the opposition between  molecular movement and sensation, that Lotze insists. In like manner  Ferrier: \"But how is it that the molecular modifications in the  cerebral cells coincide with the modifications of the consciousness;  how, for instance, do luminous vibrations falling upon the retina  excite the modification of consciousness called _visual sensation_?  These are problems we cannot solve. We may succeed in determining the  exact nature of the molecular changes which take place in the cerebral  cells when a sensation is felt, but this will not bring us an inch  nearer to the explanation of the fundamental nature of sensation.\"  Finally, Du Bois Reymond, in his famous discussion in 1880, on the  seven enigmas of the world, speaks somewhat as follows: \"The  astronomical knowledge of the encephalon, that is, the most intimate  to which we can aspire, only reveals to us matter in motion. But no  arrangement nor motion of material particles can act as a bridge by  which we can cross over into the domain of intelligence.... What  imaginable link is there between certain movements of certain  molecules in my brain, on the one hand, and on the other hand  primitive, undefinable, undeniable facts such as: I have the sensation  of softness, I smell the odour of a rose, I hear the sound of an  organ, I see a red colour, &c....\"    These three quotations show very conclusively that their authors  thought they could establish the heterogeneity of the two phenomena by  opposing matter to sensation. It must be recognised that they have  fallen into a singular error; for matter, whatever it may be, is for  us nothing but sensation; matter in motion, I have often repeated, is  only a quite special kind of sensation; the organic matter of the  brain, with its whirling movements of atoms, is only sensation.  Consequently, to oppose the molecular changes in the brain to the  sensation of red, blue, green, or to an undefined sensation of any  sort, is not crossing a gulf, and bringing together things which  cannot be compared, it is simply comparing one sensation to another  sensation.    There is evidently something equivocal in all this; and I pointed this  out when outlining and discussing the different theories of matter. It  consists in taking from among the whole body of sensations certain of  them which are considered to be special, and which are then invested  with the privilege of being more important than the rest and the  causes of all the others. This is about as illegitimate as to choose  among men a few individuals to whom is attributed the privilege of  commanding others by divine right. These privileged sensations which  belong to the sight, the touch, and the muscular sense, and which are  of large extent, are indeed extensive. They have been unduly  considered as objective and as representing matter because they are  better known and measurable, while the other sensations, the  unextensive sensations of the other senses, are considered as  subjective for the reasons that they are less known and less  measurable: and they are therefore looked on as connected with our  sensibility, our Ego, and are used to form the moral world.    We cannot subscribe to this way of establishing the contrast between  matter and thought, since it is simply a contrast between two  categories of sensations, and I have already asserted that the  partitioning-out of sensations into two groups having different  objective values, is arbitrary.

He communicates as follows to the Albany _Argus_: \"December will, in  all probability, open with little snow, but the weather will be cloudy,  threatening snow falls. During the opening days of the month, dust, with  the very light mixture of snow which may have fallen, will be swept in  flurries by the gusty wind. There will probably be some snow from about  the 4th of the month. With the second quarter of the month colder  weather will probably set in with falls of snow. The farmers will be  able to enjoy sleigh rides in the cold, exhilarating air, but good  sleighing need not be expected until after the middle of the month.  There will be a spell of mild weather about the 13th and 14th. After a  brief interval of mild weather, during which more snow will fall, the  third quarter of the month will probably see blustering and cold  weather--a cold snap with heavy snow storms and consequent good  sleighing. Very cold weather may be expected during this quarter. The  last quarter of the month will bring milder weather, but will terminate,  probably, with heavy snow-falls and stormy weather; in fact, the  heaviest snow falls will be toward the end of the month, and snow  blockades may be looked for, the snow falls extending far to the  southward, possibly as far as Washington, with very stormy weather  around New York and Boston.\" Mr. Vennor's latest predictions are that  the coming month will be \"decidedly cold, with tremendous snow-falls  during the latter half and early part of January, causing destructive  blockades to railroads.\"           *       *       *       *       *          THE LONDON UNDERGROUND RAILWAY.      The opening recently of the extension of the Metropolitan Railway to  Harrow, and the early commencement of another of the lines of the  company, give especial prominence to it. The Metropolitan Underground  Railway is emphatically the great passenger railway of the country, for  its few miles of line carry more than the hundreds of miles of line of  companies such as the London and North Western or Great Western.  Seventeen years ago--in 1868--the Metropolitan carried less than  10,000,000 passengers, and in the full year's work of the following  twelve months it carried less than 12,000,000. But year by year, almost  without exception, the number of passengers has grown. In 1865, over  15,000,000 passengers were carried; in 1867, over 23,000,000; and in  1870, over 39,000,000 passengers traveled on the line. The years that  have since passed have swollen that number. In 1872, over 44,300,000  were carried, but in the following year there was one of the few checks,  and not till 1875 was the number of 1872 exceeded. In 1875 it rose to  48,302,000; in 1877 it had advanced to 56,175,000; in 1878 to  58,807,000; and in 1879 to 60,747,000. In the present year there has  been a further advance, the number carried for the first six months of  the present year being 31,592,429. When it is borne in mind that this is  equal to 7,272 passengers every hour, and that the length of line worked  by the company's engines, including that of the \"foreign\" line worked,  is slightly less than 25 miles, the fecundity in traffic of the  metropolitan district must be said to be marvelous. It is to be  regretted that the official account from which these figures are given  does not give any idea of the number of passengers in the different  classes, for such a return would be of value. It is a marvelous fact in  the history of locomotion that this great passenger traffic is worked  with not more than 53 engines, while the total number of carriages, 195,  is in comparison with the number of travelers in them a marvel in  railway history. But it is tolerably clear that there is yet a vast  amount of undeveloped metropolitan traffic, and it is also certain that  as that traffic is developed the future of the Metropolitan as it  attains more completeness will be brighter even than it has been in the  past. The great city is more and more the mart of the world, and the  traffic and travel to and in it must increase. That increase will be  shared in considerable degree by the \"underground\" companies, and as  they have shown that their capabilities of traffic are almost boundless,  it may be expected that the oldest and the chief of these will in the  early future know a growth as continuous if less rapid than in the past.    We take the above from the _Engineer_, London. In this city there are  now existing 27 miles of elevated steam railways for local passenger  traffic. These roads have carried during the past year 61,000,000 of  passengers. In this service they employ 175 locomotives and 500  passenger cars. It is a terrible nuisance to have these locomotives and  cars constantly whizzing through the public streets; still the roads are  a great accommodation. The only underground railway in this city is that  of the New York Central and Hudson River, 4 miles in length, extending  under Fourth avenue from Forty-second street to Harlem River. Over this  road the enormous traffic of the Central, Harlem, and the New Haven  roads, with their connections, passes. But so removed from public sight  are the cars and locomotives that the existence of this underground  railway is almost forgotten.           *       *       *       *       *          TEMPERING CHISELS.      A practical mechanic communicates to the Scientific American the  following: In hardening and tempering a cold chisel care should be taken  to have a gradual shading of temper. If there is a distinct boundary  line of temper color between the hard cutting edge and softer shank  portion, it will be very apt to break at or near that line. The cutting  edge portion of the chisel should be supported by a backing of steel  gradually diminishing in hardness; and so with all metal cutting tools  that are subjected to heavy strain. Not every workman becomes uniformly  successful in this direction, for, in addition to dexterity, it requires  a nice perception of degree of heat and of color in order to obtain the  best result.           *       *       *       *       *      MR. A. A. KNUDSON, of Brooklyn, N. Y., has lately perfected and patented  a system of protecting oil tanks from lightning, which is approved by  several prominent electricians. The invention includes a device for  distributing a spray of water over the top of the tank for condensing  the rising vapor and cooling the tank; a system of lightning conductors  connected with a gutter surrounding the tank, and a hollow earth  terminal connected with the gutter by a pipe, and designed to moisten  the earth, and at the same time prevent the earth around the terminal  from becoming saturated with oil.           *       *       *       *       *      A correspondant of the _Christian Union_, writing from Constantinople,  says that Abd ul-Hamid, the Sultan of Turkey, reads the Scientific  American, the engravings in which seem to specially interest him. The  writer adds that whatever in literature the Sultan may chance to hear of  which he thinks may interest him, he has translated into Turkish.           *       *       *       *       *          AMATEUR MECHANICS.      A SIMPLE SINGLE-ACTING STEAM ENGINE.    The great bugbear staring the amateur mechanic in the face when he  contemplates making a small steam engine is the matter of boring the  cylinder. To bore an iron cylinder on a foot lathe is difficult even  when the lathe is provided with automatic feed gear, and it is almost  impossible with the ordinary light lathe possessed by most amateurs. To  bore a brass cylinder is easier, but even this is difficult, and the  cylinder, when done, is unsatisfactory on account of the difficulty of  adapting a durable piston to it.    The engravings show a simple steam engine, which requires no difficult  lathe work; in fact the whole of the work may be done on a very ordinary  foot lathe. The engine is necessarily single-acting, but it is effective  nevertheless, being about 1-20 H. P., with suitable steam supply. It is  of sufficient size to run a foot lathe, scroll saw, or two or three  sewing machines.    The cylinder and piston are made from mandrel drawn brass tubing, which  may be purchased in any desired quantity in New York city. The fittings  are mostly of brass, that being an easy metal to work.    The principal dimensions of the engine are as follows:      Cylinder.--Internal diameter, 11/2 in.; thickness, 1/8 in.;  length, 3-3/8 in.    Piston.--External diameter, 11/2 in.; thickness, 3-32 in.; length,  33/4 in.    Length of stroke. 2 in.    Crank pin.--Diameter, 1/4 in.; length of bearing surface, 1/2 in.    Connecting rod.--Diameter, 5/16 in.;"]]]
