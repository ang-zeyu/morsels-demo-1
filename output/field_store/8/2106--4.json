[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2160"],[0,"The Expedition of Humphry Clinker (#10)"],[1,"the first day; but,  afterwards, all these things became familiar, and even agreeable.--Right  under the Pump-room windows is the King's Bath; a huge cistern, where  you see the patients up to their necks in hot water. The ladies wear  jackets and petticoats of brown linen with chip hats, in which they  fix their handkerchiefs to wipe the sweat from their faces; but, truly,  whether it is owing to the steam that surrounds them, or the heat of the  water, or the nature of the dress, or to all these causes together, they  look so flushed, and so frightful, that I always turn my eyes another  way--My aunt, who says every person of fashion should make her  appearance in the bath, as well as in the abbey church, contrived a cap  with cherry-coloured ribbons to suit her complexion, and obliged Win to  attend her yesterday morning in the water. But, really, her eyes were so  red, that they made mine water as I viewed her from the Pump-room; and  as for poor Win, who wore a hat trimmed with blue, what betwixt her wan  complexion and her fear, she looked like the ghost of some pale maiden,  who had drowned herself for love. When she came out of the bath, she  took assafoetida drops, and was fluttered all day; so that we could  hardly keep her from going into hysterics: but her mistress says it will  do her good; and poor Win curtsies, with the tears in her eyes. For  my part, I content myself with drinking about half a pint of the water  every morning.    The pumper, with his wife and servant, attend within a bar; and the  glasses, of different sizes, stand ranged in order before them, so you  have nothing to do but to point at that which you choose, and it is  filled immediately, hot and sparkling from the pump. It is the only  hot water I could ever drink, without being sick--Far from having that  effect, it is rather agreeable to the taste, grateful to the stomach,  and reviving to the spirits. You cannot imagine what wonderful cures it  performs--My uncle began with it the other day; but he made wry faces in  drinking, and I'm afraid he will leave it off--The first day we came to  Bath, he fell into a violent passion; beat two black-a-moors, and I was  afraid he would have fought with their master; but the stranger proved  a peaceable man. To be sure, the gout had got into his head, as my aunt  observed; but, I believe, his passion drove it away; for he has been  remarkably well ever since. It is a thousand pities he should ever be  troubled with that ugly distemper; for, when he is free from pain, he is  the best tempered man upon earth; so gentle, so generous, so charitable,  that every body loves him; and so good to me, in particular, that I  shall never be able to shew the deep sense I have of his tenderness and  affection.    Hard by the Pump-room, is a coffee-house for the ladies; but my aunt  says, young girls are not admitted, insomuch as the conversation  turns upon politics, scandal, philosophy, and other subjects above  our capacity; but we are allowed to accompany them to the booksellers'  shops, which are charming places of resort; where we read novels, plays,  pamphlets, and newspapers, for so small a subscription as a crown a  quarter; and in these offices of intelligence (as my brother calls them)  all the reports of the day, and all the private transactions of the  Bath, are first entered and discussed. From the bookseller's shop, we  make a tour through the milliners and toymen; and commonly stop at Mr  Gill's, the pastry-cook, to take a jelly, a tart, or a small bason of  vermicelli. There is, moreover, another place of entertainment on the  other side of the water, opposite to the Grove, to which the company  cross over in a boat--It is called Spring-garden; a sweet retreat,  laid out in walks and ponds, and parterres of flowers; and there is  a long-room for breakfasting and dancing. As the situation is low and  damp, and the season has been remarkably wet, my uncle won't suffer me  to go thither, lest I should catch cold: but my aunt says it is all a  vulgar prejudice; and, to be sure, a great many gentlemen and ladies of  Ireland frequent the place, without seeming to be the worse for it. They  say, dancing at Spring-gardens, when the air is moist, is recommended to  them as an excellent cure for the rheumatism. I have been twice at  the play; where, notwithstanding the excellence of the performers, the  gayety of the company, and the decorations of the theatre, which are  very fine, I could not help reflecting, with a sigh, upon our poor  homely representations at Gloucester--But this, in confidence to my dear  Willis--You know my heart, and will excuse its weakness.    After all, the great scenes of entertainment at Bath, are the two  public rooms; where the company meet alternately every evening. They are  spacious, lofty, and, when lighted up, appear very striking. They are  generally crowded with well-dressed people, who drink tea in separate  parties, play at cards, walk, or sit and chat together, just as they are  disposed. Twice a-week there is a ball; the expence of which is defrayed  by a voluntary subscription among the gentlemen; and every subscriber  has three tickets. I was there Friday last with my aunt, under the care  of my brother, who is a subscriber; and Sir Ulic Mackilligut recommended  his nephew, captain O Donaghan, to me as a partner; but Jery excused  himself, by saying I had got the head-ach; and, indeed, it was really  so, though I can't imagine how he knew it. The place was so hot, and the  smell so different from what we are used to in the country, that I was  quite feverish when we came away. Aunt says it is the effect of a vulgar  constitution, reared among woods and mountains; and, that as I become  accustomed to genteel company, it will wear off.--Sir Ulic was very  complaisant, made her a great many high-flown compliments; and, when  we retired, handed her with great ceremony to her chair. The captain, I  believe, would have done me the same favour; but my brother seeing him  advance, took me under his arm, and wished him good night. The Captain  is a pretty man, to be sure; tall and strait, and well made; with  light-grey eyes, and a Roman nose; but there is a certain boldness in  his look and manner, that puts one out of countenance--But I am afraid  I have put you out of all patience with this long unconnected scrawl;  which I shall therefore conclude, with assuring you, that neither Bath,  nor London, nor all the diversions of life, shall ever be able to efface  the idea of my dear Letty, from the heart of her ever affectionate    LYDIA MELFORD          To Mrs MARY JONES, at Brambleton-hall.    DEAR MOLLY JONES,    Heaving got a frank, I now return your fever, which I received by Mr  Higgins, at the Hot Well, together with the stockings, which his wife  footed for me; but now they are of no survice. No body wears such things  in this place--O Molly! you that live in the country have no deception  of our doings at Bath. Here is such dressing, and fidling, and dancing,  and gadding, and courting and plotting--O gracious! if God had not  given me a good stock of discretion, what a power of things might not  I reveal, consarning old mistress and young mistress; Jews with beards  that were no Jews; but handsome Christians, without a hair upon their  sin, strolling with spectacles, to get speech of Miss Liddy. But she's  a dear sweet soul, as innocent as the child unborn. She has tould me all  her inward thoughts, and disclosed her passion for Mr Wilson; and that's  not his name neither; and thof he acted among the player-men, he is meat  for their masters; and she has gi'en me her yallow trollopea; which Mrs  Drab, the mantymaker, says will look very well when it is scowred and  smoaked with silfur--You knows as how, yallow fitts my fizzogmony. God  he knows what havock I shall make among the mail sex, when I make my  first appearance in this killing collar, with a full soot of gaze, as  good as new, that I bought last Friday of madam Friponeau, the French  mullaner--Dear girl, I have seen all the fine shews of Bath; the Prades,  the Squires, and the Circlis, the Crashit, the Hottogon, and Bloody  Buildings, and Harry King's row; and I have been twice in the Bath with  mistress, and na'r a smoak upon our backs, hussy. The first time I was  mortally afraid, and flustered all day; and afterwards made believe that  I had got the heddick; but mistress said, if I didn't go I should take  a dose of bumtaffy; and so remembering how it worked Mrs Gwyllim a  pennorth, I chose rather to go again with her into the Bath, and then I  met with an axident. I dropt my petticoat, and could not get it up from  the bottom.--But what did that signify; they mought laff but they could  see nothing; for I was up to the sin in water. To be sure, it threw me  into such a gumbustion, that I know not what I said, nor what I did, nor  how they got me out, and rapt me in a blanket--Mrs Tabitha scoulded a  little when we got home; but she knows as I know what's what Ah Laud  help you!--There is Sir Yury Micligut, of Balnaclinch, in the cunty of  Kalloway--I took down the name from his gentleman, Mr 0 Frizzle, and he  has got an estate of fifteen hundred a year--I am sure he is both rich  and generous--But you nose, Molly, I was always famous for keeping  secrets; and so he was very safe in trusting me with his flegm for  mistress; which, to be sure is very honourable; for Mr O Frizzle assures  me, he values not her portion a brass varthing--And, indeed, what's poor  ten thousand pounds to a Baron Knight of his fortune? and, truly, I told  Mr 0 Frizzle that was all she had trust to--As for John Thomas, he's  a morass fellor--I vow, I thought he would a fit with Mr 0 Frizzle,  because he axed me to dance with him at Spring Garden--But God he knows  I have no thoughts eyther of wan or t'other.

Here Cestius waited two days but, seeing how the hills  around him swarmed with our people, who flocked in from all  quarters, he gave the word for a further retreat; killing all the  beasts of burden, and leaving all the baggage behind, and taking on  only those animals which bore the arrows and engines of war. Then  he marched down the valley, towards Bethoron.    \"The multitude felt now that their enemy was delivered into their  hands. Was it not in Bethoron that Joshua had defeated the  Canaanites, while the sun stayed his course? Was it not here that  Judas, the Maccabean, had routed the host of Nicanor? As soon as  the Romans entered the defile, the Jews rushed down upon them, sure  of their prey.    \"The Roman horse were powerless to act. The men of the legions  could not climb the rocky sides and, from every point, javelins,  stones, and arrows were poured down upon them; and all would have  been slain, had not night come on and hidden them from us, and  enabled them to reach Bethoron.    \"What rejoicings were there not, on the hills that night, as we  looked down on their camp there; and thought that, in the morning,  they would be ours! Fires burned on every crest. Hymns of praise,  and exulting cries, arose everywhere in the darkness; but the watch  was not kept strictly enough. Cestius left four hundred of his  bravest men to mount guard, and keep the fires alight--so that we  might think that all his army was there--and then, with the rest,  he stole away.    \"In the morning, we saw that the camp was well-nigh deserted and,  furious at the escape of our foes, rushed down, slew the four  hundred whom Cestius had left behind, and then set out in pursuit.  But Cestius had many hours' start and, though we followed as far as  Antipatris, we could not overtake him; and so returned, with much  rich spoil, and all the Roman engines of war, to Jerusalem--having,  with scarcely any loss, defeated a great Roman army, and slain five  thousand three hundred foot, and three hundred and eighty horse.    \"Such is the history of events which have brought about the present  state of things. As you see, there is no hope of pardon, or mercy,  from Rome. We have offended beyond forgiveness. But the madness  against which I fought so hard, at first, is still upon the people.  They provoked the power of Rome; and then, by breaking the terms,  and massacring the Roman garrison, they went far beyond the first  offense of insurrection. By the destruction of the army of Cestius,  they struck a heavy blow against the pride of the Romans. For  generations, no such misfortune had fallen upon their arms.    \"What, then, would a sane people have done since? Surely they would  have spent every moment in preparing themselves for the struggle.  Every man should have been called to arms. The passes should have  been all fortified, for it is among the hills that we can best cope  with the heavy Roman troops. The cities best calculated for defense  should have been strongly walled; preparations made for places of  refuge, among the mountains, for the women and children; large  depots of provisions gathered up, in readiness for the strife. That  we could ever, in the long run, hope to resist, successfully, the  might of Rome was out of the question; but we might so sternly, and  valiantly, have resisted as to be able to obtain fair terms, on our  submission.    \"Instead of this, men go on as if Rome had no existence; and we  only show an energy in quarreling among ourselves. At bottom, it  would seem that the people rely upon our God doing great things for  us, as he did when he smote the Assyrian army of Sennacherib; and  such is my hope, also, seeing that, so far, a wonderful success has  attended us. And yet, how can one expect the Divine assistance, in  a war so begun and so conducted--for a people who turn their swords  against each other, who spend their strength in civil feuds, who  neither humble themselves, nor repent of the wickedness of their  ways?    \"Alas, my son, though I speak brave words to the people, my heart  is very sad; and I fear that troubles, like those which fell upon  us when we were carried captive into Babylon, await us now!\"    There was silence, as the rabbi finished. John had, of course,  heard something of the events which had been taking place but, as  he now heard them, in sequence, the gravity and danger of the  situation came freshly upon him.    \"What can be done?\" he asked, after a long pause.    \"Nothing, save to pray to the Lord,\" the rabbi said, sorrowfully.  \"Josephus is doing what he can, towards building walls to the  towns; but it is not walls, but soldiers that are wanted and, so  long as the people remain blind and indifferent to the danger,  thinking of naught save tilling their ground, and laying up money,  nothing can be done.\"    \"Then will destruction come upon all?\" John asked, looking round in  a bewildered and hopeless way.    \"We may hope not,\" the rabbi said. \"Here in Galilee, we have had no  share in the events in Jerusalem; and many towns, even now, are  faithful to the Romans. Therefore it may be that, in this province,  all will not be involved in the lot of Jerusalem. There can be,  unless a mighty change takes place, no general resistance to the  Romans; and it may be, therefore, that no general destruction will  fall upon the people. As to this, none can say.    \"Vespasian--the Roman general who has been charged, by Nero, with  the command of the army which is gathering against us--is said to  be a merciful man, as well as a great commander. The Roman mercies  are not tender, but it may be that the very worst may not fall upon  this province. The men of spirit and courage will, doubtless,  proceed to Jerusalem to share in the defense of the Holy City. If  we cannot fight with success, here, it is far better that the men  should fight at Jerusalem; leaving their wives and families here,  and doing naught to call down the vengeance of the Romans upon this  province.    \"In Galilee there have, as elsewhere, been risings against the  Romans; but these will count for little, in their eyes, in  comparison to the terrible deeds at Jerusalem; and I pray, for the  sake of all my friends here, that the Romans may march through the  land, on their way to Jerusalem, without burning and wasting the  country. Here, on the eastern shore of Galilee, there is much more  hope of escape than there is across the lake. Not only are we out  of the line of the march of the army, but there are few important  cities on this side; and the disposition of the people has not been  so hostile to the Romans.    \"My own opinion is that, when the Romans advance, it will be the  duty of every Jew who can bear arms to go down to the defense of  the Holy City. Its position is one of vast strength. We shall have  numbers, and courage, though neither order nor discipline; and it  may be that, at the last, the Lord will defend his sanctuary, and  save it from destruction at the hands of the heathen. Should it not  be so, we can but die; and how could a Jew better die than in  defense of God's Temple?\"    \"It would have been better,\" Simon said, \"had we not, by our evil  doings, have brought God's Temple into danger.\"    \"He has suffered it,\" the rabbi said, \"and his ways are not the  ways of man. It may be that He has suffered such madness to fall  upon, us in order that His name may, at last, be glorified.\"    \"May it be so!\" Simon said piously; \"and now, let us to bed, for  the hour is growing late.\"    The following morning Simon, his wife, and the whole household  accompanied John to the shore; as Simon had arranged with one of  the boatmen to take the lad to Hippos. The distance was but short;  but Simon, when his wife had expressed surprise at his sending John  in a boat, said:    \"It is not the distance, Martha. A half-hour's walk is naught to  the lad; but I had reasons, altogether apart from the question of  distance. John is going out to play a man's part. He is young but,  since my lord Josephus has chosen to place him among those who form  his bodyguard, he has a right to claim to be regarded as a man.  That being so, I would not accompany him to Hippos; for it would  seem like one leading a child, and it were best to let him go by  himself.    \"Again, it were better to have but one parting. Here he will  receive my blessing, and say goodbye to us all. Doubtless he will  often be with us, for Tiberias lies within sight and, so long as  Josephus remains in Galilee, he will never be more than a long  day's journey from home. The lad loves us, and will come as often  as he can but, surrounded as Josephus is by dangers, the boy will  not be able to get away on his own business. He must take the  duties, as well as the honor of the office; and we must not blind  ourselves to the fact that, in one of these popular tumults, great  danger and even death may come upon him.    \"This seems to you terrible,\" he went on, in answer to an  exclamation of alarm from Martha; \"but it does not seem so terrible  to me. We go on planting, and gathering in, as if no danger  threatened us, and the evil day were far off; but it is not so. The  Roman hosts are gathering, and we are wasting our strength, in  party strife, and are doing naught to prepare against the storm. We  have gone to war, without counting the cost. We have affronted and  put to shame Rome, before whom all nations bow and, assuredly, she  will take a terrible vengeance. Another year, and who can say who  will be alive, and who dead--who will be wandering over the wasted  fields of our people, or who will be a slave, in Rome!    \"In the times that are at hand, no man's life will be worth  anything; and therefore I say, wife, that though there be danger  and peril around the lad, let us not trouble overmuch; for he is,  like all of us, in God's hands.\""]]]
