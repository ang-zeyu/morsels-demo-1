[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21721"],[0,"The Coral Island (#10)"],[1," do us a serious injury.  So we  never stayed at the bottom as long as we might have done, but came up  frequently to the top for fresh air, and dived down again immediately.  Sometimes, when Jack happened to be in a humorous frame, he would seat  himself at the bottom of the sea on one of the brain-corals, as if he  were seated on a large paddock-stool, and then make faces at me in  order, if possible, to make me laugh under water.  At first, when he  took me unawares, he nearly succeeded, and I had to shoot to the surface  in order to laugh; but afterwards I became aware of his intentions, and  being naturally of a grave disposition, I had no difficulty in  restraining myself.  I used often to wonder how poor Peterkin would have  liked to be with us; and he sometimes expressed much regret at being  unable to join us.  I used to do my best to gratify him, poor fellow, by  relating all the wonders that we saw; but this, instead of satisfying,  seemed only to whet his curiosity the more, so one day we prevailed on  him to try to go down with us.  But although a brave boy in every other  way, Peterkin was very nervous in the water; and it was with difficulty  we got him to consent to be taken down, for he could never have managed  to push himself down to the bottom without assistance.  But no sooner  had we pulled him down a yard or so into the deep, clear water than he  began to struggle and kick violently; so we were forced to let him go,  when he rose out of the water like a cork, gave a loud gasp and a  frightful roar, and struck out for the land with the utmost possible  haste.    Now all this pleasure we were to forego, and when we thought thereon,  Jack and I felt very much depressed in our spirits.  I could see, also,  that Peterkin grieved and sympathised with us; for, when talking about  this matter, he refrained from jesting and bantering us upon it.    As, however, a man's difficulties usually set him upon devising methods  to overcome them, whereby he often discovers better things than those he  may have lost, so this our difficulty induced us to think of searching  for a large pool among the rocks, where the water should be deep enough  for diving, yet so surrounded by rocks as to prevent sharks from getting  at us.  And such a pool we afterwards found, which proved to be very  much better than our most sanguine hopes anticipated.  It was situated  not more than ten minutes' walk from our camp, and was in the form of a  small, deep bay or basin, the entrance to which, besides being narrow,  was so shallow that no fish so large as a shark could get in--at least,  not unless he should be a remarkably thin one.    Inside of this basin, which we called our Water Garden, the coral  formations were much more wonderful, and the seaweed plants far more  lovely and vividly coloured, than in the lagoon itself.  And the water  was so clear and still that, although very deep, you could see the  minutest object at the bottom.  Besides this, there was a ledge of rock  which overhung the basin at its deepest part, from which we could dive  pleasantly, and whereon Peterkin could sit and see not only all the  wonders I had described to him, but also see Jack and me creeping  amongst the marine shrubbery at the bottom, like--as he expressed  it--\"two great white sea-monsters.\"  During these excursions of ours to  the bottom of the sea we began to get an insight into the manners and  customs of its inhabitants, and to make discoveries of wonderful things,  the like of which we never before conceived.  Among other things, we  were deeply interested with the operations of the little coral insect,  which, I was informed by Jack, is supposed to have entirely constructed  many of the numerous islands in the Pacific Ocean.  And certainly, when  we considered the great reef which these insects had formed round the  island on which we were cast, and observed their ceaseless activity in  building their myriad cells, it did at first seem as if this might be  true; but then, again, when I looked at the mountains of the island, and  reflected that there were thousands of such (many of them much higher)  in the South Seas, I doubted that there must be some mistake here.  But  more of this hereafter.    I also became much taken up with the manners and appearance of the  anemones, and starfish, and crabs, and sea-urchins, and such-like  creatures; and was not content with watching those I saw during my dives  in the Water Garden, but I must needs scoop out a hole in the coral rock  close to it, which I filled with salt water, and stocked with sundry  specimens of anemones and shell-fish, in order to watch more closely how  they were in the habit of passing their time.  Our burning-glass, also,  now became a great treasure to me, as it enabled me to magnify, and so  to perceive more clearly, the forms and actions of these curious  creatures of the deep.    Having now got ourselves into a very comfortable condition, we began to  talk of a project which we had long had in contemplation--namely, to  travel entirely round the island, in order, first, to ascertain whether  it contained any other productions which might be useful to us; and,  second, to see whether there might be any place more convenient and  suitable for our permanent residence than that on which we were now  encamped.  Not that we were in any degree dissatisfied with it.  On the  contrary, we entertained quite a home-feeling to our bower and its  neighbourhood; but if a better place did exist, there was no reason why  we should not make use of it.  At any rate, it would be well to know of  its existence.    We had much earnest talk over this matter.  But Jack proposed that,  before undertaking such an excursion, we should supply ourselves with  good defensive arms; for, as we intended not only to go round all the  shore, but to descend most of the valleys, before returning home, we  should be likely to meet in with--he would not say _dangers_--but at  least with everything that existed on the island, whatever that might  be.    \"Besides,\" said Jack, \"it won't do for us to live on cocoa-nuts and  oysters always.  No doubt they are very excellent in their way, but I  think a little animal food now and then would be agreeable as well as  good for us; and as there are many small birds among the trees, some of  which are probably very good to eat, I think it would be a capital plan  to make bows and arrows, with which we could easily knock them over.\"    \"First-rate!\" cried Peterkin.  \"You will make the bows, Jack, and I'll  try my hand at the arrows.  The fact is, I'm quite tired of throwing  stones at the birds.  I began the very day we landed, I think, and have  persevered up to the present time, but I've never hit anything yet.\"    \"You forget,\" said I, \"you hit me one day on the shin.\"    \"Ah, true!\" replied Peterkin; \"and a precious shindy you kicked up in  consequence.  But you were at least four yards away from the impudent  paroquet I aimed at, so you see what a horribly bad shot I am.\"    \"But, Jack,\" said I, \"you cannot make three bows and arrows before  to-morrow; and would it not be a pity to waste time, now that we have  made up our minds to go on this expedition?--Suppose that you make one  bow and arrow for yourself, and we can take our clubs?\"    \"That's true, Ralph.  The day is pretty far advanced, and I doubt if I  can make even one bow before dark.  To be sure, I might work by  firelight after the sun goes down.\"    We had, up to this time, been in the habit of going to bed with the sun,  as we had no pressing call to work o' nights; and, indeed, our work  during the day was usually hard enough--what between fishing, and  improving our bower, and diving in the Water Garden, and rambling in the  woods--so that when night came we were usually very glad to retire to  our beds.  But now that we had a desire to work at night, we felt a wish  for candles.    \"Won't a good blazing fire give you light enough?\" inquired Peterkin.    \"Yes,\" replied Jack, \"quite enough; but then it will give us a great  deal more than enough of heat in this warm climate of ours.\"    \"True,\" said Peterkin; \"I forgot that.  It would roast us.\"    \"Well, as you're always doing that at any rate,\" remarked Jack, \"we  could scarcely call it a change.  But the fact is, I've been thinking  over this subject before.  There is a certain nut growing in these  islands which is called the candle-nut, because the natives use it  instead of candles; and I know all about it, and how to prepare it for  burning--\"    \"Then why don't you do it?\" interrupted Peterkin.  \"Why have you kept us  in the dark so long, you vile philosopher?\"    \"Because,\" said Jack, \"I have not seen the tree yet, and I'm not sure  that I should know either the tree or the nuts if I did see them.  You  see, I forget the description.\"    \"Ah! that's just the way with me,\" said Peterkin with a deep sigh.  \"I  never could keep in my mind for half-an-hour the few descriptions I ever  attempted to remember.  The very first voyage I ever made was caused by  my mistaking a description--or forgetting it, which is the same thing.  And a horrible voyage it was.  I had to fight with the captain the whole  way out, and made the homeward voyage by swimming!\"    \"Come, Peterkin,\" said I, \"you can't get even _me_ to believe that.\"    \"Perhaps not, but it's true notwithstanding,\" returned Peterkin,  pretending to be hurt at my doubting his word.    \"Let us hear how it happened,\" said Jack, while a good-natured smile  overspread his face.    \"Well, you must know,\" began Peterkin, \"that the very day before I went  to sea I was greatly taken up with a game at hockey, which I was playing  with my old school-fellows for the last time before leaving them.--You  see I was young then, Ralph.\"  Peterkin gazed, in an abstracted and  melancholy manner, out to sea.--\"Well, in the midst of the game, my  uncle, who had taken all the bother and trouble"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21724"],[0,"The Handbook of Soap Manufacture (#10)"],[1,"deg.
