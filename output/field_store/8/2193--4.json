'What's fair to one is fair to all,' said the Constable. 'You'll admit  that, of course?' he added to Bill.    'I admit nothin' of the sort,' said Bill. 'If you want to arrest  anybody, do your duty and arrest these here puddin'-snatchers.      'If you're an officer of the Law,      A constant felon-catcher,    Then do not hesitate before      A common puddin'-snatcher.'    [Illustration]    'We call on you to arrest these assaulters and batterers of people  wearing top-hats,' said the puddin'-thieves;      'Our innocence let all attest,      We prove it by our hatter;    It is your duty to arrest    Not those in top-hats of the best      But those who top-hats batter.'    'It's very clear that somebody has to be arrested,' said the Mayor. 'I  can't be put to the trouble of wearing my robes of office in public  without somebody having to pay for it. I don't care whether you arrest  the top-hat batterers, or the battered top-hatters; all I say is, do  your duty, whatever happens--      'So somebody, no matter who,      You must arrest or rue it;    As I'm the Mayor of Tooraloo,    And you've the painful job to do,      I call on you to do it.'    [Illustration]    'Very well,' said the Constable, peevishly, 'as I've got to take all the  responsibility, I'll settle the matter by arresting the Puddin'. As far  as I can see, he's the ringleader in this disturbance.'    'You're a carrot-nosed poltroon,' said the Puddin' loudly. 'As for the  Mayor, he's a sausage-shaped porous plaster,' and he gave him a sharp  pinch in the leg.    'What a ferocious Puddin',' said the Mayor, turning as pale as a turnip.  'Officer, do your duty and arrest this dangerous felon before he  perpetrates further sacrilegious acts.'    'That's all very well, you know,' said the Constable, turning as pale as  tripe; 'but he might nip me.'    'I can't help that,' cried the Mayor, angrily. 'At all costs I must be  protected from danger. Do your duty and arrest this felon with your  hat.'    The Constable looked round, gasped, and summoning all his courage,  scooped up the Puddin' in his hat.    'My word,' he said, breathlessly, 'but that was a narrow squeak. I  expected every moment to be my last.'    'Now we breathe more freely,' said the Mayor, and led the way to the  Tooraloo Court House.    'If this isn't too bad,' said Bill, furiously. 'Here we've had all the  worry and trouble of fightin' puddin'-thieves night and day, and, on top  of it all, here's this Tooralooral tadpole of a Mayor shovin' his nose  into the business and arrestin' our Puddin' without rhyme or reason.'    [Illustration]    As they had arrived at the Court House at that moment, Bill was forced  to smother his resentment for the time being. There was nobody in Court  except the Judge and the Usher, who were seated on the bench having a  quiet game of cards over a bottle of port.    'Order in the Court,' shouted the Usher, as they all came crowding in;  and the Judge, seeing the Constable carrying the Puddin' in his hat,  said severely:    'This won't do, you know; it's Contempt of Court, bringing your lunch  here.'    'An' it please you, My Lord,' said the Constable hurriedly, 'this here  Puddin' has been arrested for pinching the Mayor.'    'As a consequence of which, I see you've pinched the Puddin',' said the  Judge facetiously. 'Dear me, what spirits I am in to-day, to be sure!'    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    'The felon has an aroma most dangerously suggestive of beef gravy,' said  the Usher, solemnly.    'Beef gravy?' said the Judge. 'Now, it seems to me that the aroma is  much more subtly suggestive of steak and kidney.'    'Garnished, I think, with onions,' said the Usher.    'In order to settle this knotty point, just hand the felon up here a  moment,' said the Judge. 'I don't suppose you've got a knife about you?'  he asked.    'I've got a paper-knife,' said the Usher; and, the Puddin' having been  handed up to the bench, the Judge and the Usher cut a slice each, and  had another glass of port.    Bill was naturally enraged at seeing total strangers eating  Puddin'-owners' private property, and he called out loudly:    'Common justice and the lawful rights of Puddin'-owners.'    'Silence in the Court while the Judge is eating,' shouted the Usher; and  the Judge said severely--      'I really think you ought      To see I'm taking food,    So, Silence in the Court!    (I'm also taking port),      If you intrude, in manner rude,    A lesson you'll be taught.'    'An' it please Your Lordship,' said the Mayor, pointing to Bill, 'this  person is a brutal assaulter of people wearing top-hats.'    'No insults,' said Bill, and he gave the Mayor a slap in the face.    [Illustration]    The Mayor went as pale as cheese, and the Usher called out: 'No  face-slapping while the judge is dining!' and the Judge said, angrily--      'It's really far from nice,      As you ought to be aware,    While I am chewing a slice,      To have you slapping the Mayor.    If I have to complain of you again      I'll commit you in a trice,      You'd better take my advice;      Don't let me warn you twice.'    'All very well for you to talk,' said Bill, scornfully, 'sittin' up  there eatin' our Puddin'. I'm a respectable Puddin'-owner, an' I calls  on you to hand over that Puddin' under threat of an action-at-law for  wrongful imprisonment, trespass, and illegally using the same.'    'Personal remarks to the Judge are not allowed,' shouted the Usher, and  the Judge said solemnly--      'A Judge must be respected,      A Judge you mustn't knock,    Or else you'll be detected      And shoved into the dock.      You'll get a nasty shock      When gaolers turn the lock.    In prison cell you'll give a yell      To hear the hangman knock.'    Here, the Usher took off his coat, as the day was warm, and hung it on  the back of his chair. He then rapped on the bench and said--      'In the name of the Law I must request    Less noise while we're having a well-earned rest,    For the Judge and the Usher never must shirk    [Illustration]      A well-earned rest in the middle of work.    It's the duty of both they are well aware    To preserve their precious lives with care;    It's their duty, when feeling overwrought,    To preserve their lives with Puddin' and Port.'    He sat down and tossed off a bumper of port to prove his words. 'Your  deal, I think,' said the Judge, and they went on sipping and munching  and dealing out cards. At this, Bill gave way to despair.    'What on earth's to be done?' he asked. 'Here's these legal ferrets has  got our Puddin' in their clutches, and here's us, spellbound with  anguish, watchin' them wolfin' it. Here's a situation as would wring  groans from the breast of a boiled onion.'    'Why, it's worse than droppin' soverins down a drain,' said Sam.    'It's worse than catchin' your whiskers in the mangle,' said Bill.    By a fortunate chance, at this moment the Possum happened to put his  snout within Bill's reach, and Bill hit it a swinging clout to relieve  his feelings.    'It's unlawful,' shouted the Possum, 'to hit a man's snout unexpectedly  when he isn't engaged puddin'-stealing.'    'Observe the rules,' said the Wombat solemnly. 'Be kind to snouts when  not engaged in theft.'    'If it hadn't been for you two tryin' to steal our Puddin' all this  trouble wouldn't have happened,' said Bill.    'It's the Mayor's fault for bringing us all here,' cried the Possum,  angrily. 'If you was a just man, you'd clout him on the snout, too.'    'The Mayor's to blame,' said the Wombat. 'What about the whole lot of us  settin' on to him?'    At this suggestion the Mayor trembled so violently that his hat fell  off.    'What dreadful words are these?' he asked, and the Constable said  hurriedly, 'Never set on to the Mayor while the local Constable is  present. Let that be your golden rule.'    'That's all very well,' said Bill, 'but if you two hadn't come  interferin' at the wrong moment, our Puddin' wouldn't have been  arrested, and all this trouble wouldn't have happened. As you're  responsible, the question now is, What are you going to do about it?'    'My advice is,' said the Constable, impressively, 'resign yourselves to  Fate.'    'My advice,' said the Mayor in a low voice, 'is general expressions of  esteem and friendship, hand-shaking all round, inquiries after each  other's health, chatty remarks about the weather, the price of potatoes,  and how well the onions are looking.'    Bill treated these suggestions with scorn. 'If any man in the company  has better advice to offer, let him stand forth,' said he.    Bunyip Bluegum stood forth. 'My advice,' he said, 'is this: try the case  without the Judge; or, in other words, assume the legal functions of  this defaulting personage in the bag-wig who is at present engaged in  distending himself illegally with our Puddin'. For mark how runs the  axiom--      'If you've a case without a Judge,    It's clear your case will never budge;    But if a Judge you have to face,    The chances are you'll lose your case.    To win your case, and save your pelf,    Why, try the blooming case yourself!'    'As usual, our friend here solves the problem in a few well-chosen  words,' said Bill, and preparations were made at once for trying the  case. After a sharp struggle, in which it was found necessary to bend  the Possum's snout severely in order to make him listen to reason, the  puddin'-thieves were forced into the dock. Their top-hats and  frock-coats were taken away, for fear the jury might take them for  undertakers, and not scoundrels. The Mayor and the Constable were pushed  into the jury box to perform the duties of twelve good men and true, and  the others took seats about the Court as witnesses for the prosecution.    There was some delay before the proceedings began, for Bill said,  'Here's me, the Crown Prosecutor, without a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23626"],[0,"The Chemistry, Properties and Tests of Precious Stones (#10)"],[1,"minerals, we  find that when this is heated to between 50 deg. F. and 300 deg. F. it assumes  electric polarity, becoming electrified positively at one end or pole  and negatively at the opposite pole. If it is suspended on a silken  thread from a glass rod or other non-conducting support in a similar  manner to the pith ball, the tourmaline will be found to have become an  excellent magnet. By testing this continually as it cools there will  soon be perceived a point which is of extreme delicacy of temperature,  where the magnetic properties are almost in abeyance. But as the  tourmaline cools yet further, though but a fraction of a degree, the  magnetic properties change; the positive pole becomes the negative, the  negative having changed to the positive.    It is also interesting to note that if the tourmaline is not warmed so  high as to reach a temperature of 50 deg. F., or is heated so strongly as to  exceed more than a few degrees above 300 deg. F., then these magnetic  properties do not appear, as no polarity is present. This polarity, or  the presence of positive and negative electricity in one stone, may be  strikingly illustrated in a very simple manner:--If a little sulphur and  red-lead, both in fine powder, are shaken up together in a paper or  similar bag, the moderate friction of particle against particle  electrifies both; one negatively, the other positively. If, then, a  little of this now golden-coloured mixture is gently dusted over the  surface of the tourmaline or other stone possessing electric polarity, a  most interesting change is at once apparent. The red-lead separates  itself from the sulphur and adheres to the negative portion of the  stone, whilst the separated sulphur is at once attracted to the positive  end, so that the golden-coloured mixture becomes slowly transformed into  its two separate components--the brilliant yellow sulphur, and the  equally brilliant red-lead. These particles form in lines and waves  around the respective poles in beautiful symmetry, their positions  corresponding with the directions of the lines of magnetic force,  exactly as will iron filings round the two poles of a magnet.    From this it will clearly be seen how simple a matter it is to isolate  the topaz, tourmaline, and all the pyro-electric stones from the  non-pyro-electric, for science has not as yet been able to give to  spurious stones these same electric properties, however excellent some  imitations may be in other respects. Further, almost all minerals lose  their electricity rapidly on exposure to atmospheric influences, even to  dry air; the diamond retains it somewhat longer than most stones, though  the sapphire, topaz, and a few others retain it almost as long again as  the diamond, and these electric properties are some of the tests which  are used in the examination of precious stones.    Those stones which show electricity on the application of pressure are  such as the fluorspar, calcite, and topaz.    With regard to magnetism, the actual cause of this is not yet known with  certainty. It is, of course, a self-evident fact that the magnetic iron  ore, which is a form of peroxide, commonly known as magnetite, or  lodestone, has the power of attracting a magnet when swinging free, or  of being attracted by a magnet, to account for which many plausible  reasons have been advanced. Perhaps the most reasonable and acceptable  of these is that this material contains molecules which have half their  substance positively and the other half negatively magnetised.    Substances so composed, of which magnets are an example, may be made  the means of magnetising other substances by friction, without they  themselves suffering any loss; but it is not all substances that will  respond to the magnet. For instance, common iron pyrites, FeS_{2}, is  unresponsive, whilst the magnetic pyrites, which varies from 5FeS,  Fe_{2}S_{3}, to 6FeS, Fe_{2}S_{3}, and is a sulphide of iron, is  responsive both positively and negatively. Bismuth and antimony also are  inactive, whilst almost all minerals containing even a small percentage  of iron will deflect the magnetic needle, at least under the influence  of heat. So that from the lodestone--the most powerfully magnetic  mineral known--to those minerals possessing no magnetic action whatever,  we have a long, graduated scale, in which many of the precious stones  appear, those containing iron in their composition being more or less  responsive, as already mentioned, and that either in their normal state,  or when heated, and always to an extent depending on the quantity or  percentage of iron they contain.    In this case, also, science has not as yet been able to introduce into  an artificial stone the requisite quantity of iron to bring it the same  analytically as the gem it is supposed to represent, without completely  spoiling the colour. So that the behaviour of a stone in the presence of  a magnet, to the degree to which it should or should not respond, is one  of the important tests of a genuine stone.          CHAPTER XI.    THE CUTTING OF PRECIOUS STONES.      As existing in a state of nature precious stones do not, as a rule,  exhibit any of those beautiful and wonderful properties which cause them  to be so admired and sought after as to become of great intrinsic value,  for their surfaces have become clouded by innumerable fine cuts or  abrasions, because of the thousands of years during which they have been  under pressure, or tumbled about in rivers, or subjected to the  incessant friction caused by surrounding substances. All this occurring  above and under ground has given them an appearance altogether different  to that which follows cutting and polishing. Further, the shape of the  stone becomes altered by the same means, and just as Michael Angelo's  figure was already in the marble, as he facetiously said, and all he had  to do was to chip off what he did not require till he came to it, so is  the same process of cutting and polishing necessary to give to the  precious stones their full value, and it is the manner in which these  delicate and difficult operations are performed that is now under  consideration. Just as experience and skill are essential to the  obtaining of a perfect figure from the block of marble, so must the  cutting and polishing of a precious stone call for the greatest  dexterity of which a workman is capable, experience and skill so great  as to be found only in the expert, for in stones of great value even a  slight mistake in the shaping and cutting would probably not only be  wasteful of the precious material, but would utterly spoil its beauty,  causing incalculable loss, and destroying altogether the refrangibility,  lustre and colour of the stone, thus rendering it liable to easy  fracture: in every sense converting what would have been a rare and  magnificent jewel to a comparatively valueless specimen.    One of the chief services rendered by precious stones is that they may  be employed as objects of adornment, therefore, the stone must be cut of  such a shape as will allow of its being set without falling out of its  fastening--not too shallow or thin, to make it unserviceable and liable  to fracture, and in the case of a transparent stone, not too deep for  the light to penetrate, or much colour and beauty will be lost. Again,  very few stones are flawless, and the position in which the flaw or  flaws appear will, to a great extent, regulate the shape of the stones,  for there are some positions in which a slight flaw would be of small  detriment, because they would take little or no reflection, whilst in  others, where the reflections go back and forth from facet to facet  throughout the stone, a flaw would be magnified times without number,  and the value of the stone greatly reduced. It is therefore essential  that a flaw should be removed whenever possible, but, when this is not  practicable, the expert will cut the stone into such a shape as will  bring the defect into the least important part of the finished gem, or  probably sacrifice the size and weight of the original stone by cutting  it in two or more pieces of such a shape that the cutting and polishing  will obliterate the defective portions. Such a method was adopted with  the great Cullinan diamond, as described in Chapter IV. From this  remarkable diamond a great number of magnificent stones were obtained,  the two chief being the largest and heaviest at present known. Some idea  of the size of the original stone may be gathered from the fact that the  traditional Indian diamond, the \"Great Mogul,\" is said to have weighed  280 carats. This stone, however, is lost, and some experts believe that  it was divided, part of it forming the present famous Koh-i-nur; at any  rate, all trace of the Great Mogul ceased with the looting of Delhi in  1739. The Koh-i-nur weighs a little over 106 carats; before cutting it  weighed a shade over 186; the Cullinan, in the same state, weighed  nearly 3254 carats. This massive diamond was cut into about 200 stones,  the largest, now placed in \"The Royal Sceptre with the Cross,\" weighing  516-1/2 carats, the second, now placed under the historic ruby in \"The  Imperial State Crown,\" weighing 309-3/16ths carats. These two diamonds  are now called \"The Stars of Africa.\" Both these stones, but especially  the larger, completely overshadow the notorious Koh-i-nur, and  notwithstanding the flaw which appeared in the original stone, every one  of the resulting pieces, irrespective of weight, is without the  slightest blemish and of the finest colour ever known, for the great  South African diamond is of a quality never even approached by any  existing stone, being ideally perfect.    It requires a somewhat elaborate explanation to make clear the various  styles of cut without illustrations. They are usually divided into two  groups, with curved, and with flat or plane surfaces. Of the first, the"]]]
