No room with walls constructed wholly of adobe can  be made out, but walls of this character closing one side of a room are  common, and rooms with two or even three sides of adobe are not  uncommon. There are some instances in which part of a wall is stone and  part adobe, and also instances in which the lower wall, complete in  itself, is of stone, while the upper part, evidently a later addition,  is of adobe; such, for example, is the cross wall in the eastern tier,  about 30 feet from the cliff.    The mere occurrence of adobe here is evidence of the occupancy of this  site at a period subsequent to the sixteenth century--we might almost  say subsequent to the middle of the seventeenth; but its occurrence in  this way and in such intimate association with the stone walls indicates  that the occupancy was continuous from a time prior to the introduction  of adobe construction to a period some time subsequent to it. This  hypothesis is supported by other evidence, which will appear later.  Attention may here be directed to the fact that there are four  chimney-like structures in the lower ruin, all of adobe, and all, except  the one which pertains to the kiva, attached to adobe walls.    On the western margin of the ruin, and nowhere else within it, there are  traces of another kind of construction which was not found elsewhere  within the canyon. This method is known to the Mexicans as \"jacal,\" and  much used by them. It consists of a row of sticks or thin poles set  vertically in the ground and heavily plastered with mud. At present not  one of these walls remains to a height of 6 inches above the ground, but  the lines of poles broken off at the ground level are still visible. The  ground at this point is but 3 or 4 feet above the general level of the  bottom. The ground plan shows the occurrence of these wall remains on  the western edge of the site. They are all outside of but attached to  what was formerly the exterior wall on that side.    There are remains of four Navaho burial cists in the lower ruin, at the  points shown on the ground plan. These are constructed of stones and mud  roughly put together in the ordinary manner, forming thin, rounded  walls; but these can not be confounded with the other methods of  construction described. Three of the cists have long been in ruins and  broken down; the one on the east is but a few years old.    Access to the upper ruin can now be had only with much difficulty. In  the western end of the cave there is a single room placed on the cliff  edge, and between this and the end of a wall to the right a small stick  has been embedded in the masonry at a height of about 2 feet from the  rock. The cliff here is vertical and affords no footing, but by throwing  a rope over the stick a man can ascend hand over hand. During the period  when the houses were occupied, access was had in another and much easier  way, through a doorway or passageway nearly in the center of the ruin  and directly over the point where the lower village was four stories  high. The roof of the lower structure was less than 4 feet below the  floor of the cave; yet there is no doubt that a doorway or passageway  existed also at the western end of the cave, as the western end of the  wall on the right of the stick is neatly finished and apparently  complete.    The principal room in the upper ruin is situated nearly in the center of  the cave, and is the one that has given the whole ruin its name. The  walls are 2 feet thick, constructed of stone, 12 feet high in front and  7 feet high on the sides and inside. The exterior was finished with a  coat of whitewash, with a decorative band in yellow; hence the name of  Casa Blanca or White House. West of the principal room there is a  smaller one, which appears to be a later addition. The walls of this  room are only 7 inches thick, of adobe on the sides and back and of  small stones in front. The top of the wall is about 2 feet below the top  of the wall on the east. The coat of whitewash and the yellow decorative  band are continuous over both rooms, but the white coat was also applied  to the exterior western wall of the main room. In the main room there is  a series of small sticks, about half an inch in diameter, projecting 8  inches from the wall and on a line 3 or 4 inches under where the roof  was.    The small room in the eastern end of the cave was located on a kind of  bench or upper level, and was constructed partly of stone and partly of  adobe. The stone part is the upper portion of the eastern half. On the  west there is a small opening or window, with an appliance for closing  it. It is probable that this room was used only for storage. In the  western end of the cave there is another single room, which is clearly  shown in plate XLVII. The front wall is 11 feet high outside and 5 feet  high inside. The lower portion is stone, the upper part and sides are  adobe, and the side walls rest on nearly 2 feet of straw, ashes, etc.  The buttress shown in the illustration is of stone and the front wall  that it supports is slightly battened. A close inspection of the  illustration will show that this wall rests partly on horizontal timber  work, a feature which is repeated in several walls in the main cluster  of the ruins.    The use of timber laid horizontally under a wall is not uncommon, and as  it will be discussed at greater length in another place, it may be  dismissed here with the statement that as a rule it failed to accomplish  the purpose intended. But the use of the buttress is an anomalous  feature which it is difficult to believe was of aboriginal conception.  Its occurrence in this ruin together with so many other unaboriginal  features is suggestive.    The walls of the principal room and of the rooms immediately in front of  it are constructed of stone; all the other walls in the upper ruin are  of adobe or have adobe in them. The two rooms on the east and two walls  of the room adjoining on the west are wholly of adobe, about 7 inches  thick and now 3 and 4 feet high. In the southeast corner of the second  room from the east there is an opening through the front wall which may  have been a drain. It is on the floor level, round, 5 inches in  diameter, and smoothly plastered. In the fourth room from the east there  is a similar hole. Both of these discharge on the edge of the cliff, and  it is difficult to imagine their purpose unless they were expedients for  draining the rooms; but this would imply that the rooms were not roofed.  Although the cliff above is probably 500 feet high, and overhangs to the  degree that a rock pushed over its edge falls 15 feet or more outside of  the outermost wall remains, and over 70 feet from the foot of the cliff,  still a driving storm of rain or snow would leave considerable  quantities of water in the front rooms if they were not roofed, and some  means would have to be provided to carry it off.    In the same room, the fourth from the east, there are the remains of a  chimney-like structure, the only one in the upper ruin. It is in the  northeast corner, at a point where the wall has fallen and been replaced  by a Navaho burial cist also fallen in ruin, and was constructed of  stone. There is no doubt that it was added some time after the walls  were built, as it has cracked off from the wall on the east, which shows  at that point its original finish. In the eastern wall of this room  there is a well-finished opening, and at the corresponding point in the  wall of the room on the right, the third wall from the east, there is  another. The latter wall is of adobe, or rather there are two adobe  walls built side by side; one, the eastern, considerably thinner than  the other. The opening extends through both walls; it was neatly  finished and was closed by a thin slab of stone plastered in with mud.  It has the appliance for closing mentioned above and described later  (page 165). Most of the openings in the walls appear to have been closed  up at the time the houses were abandoned.    The front wall of the main room is 12 feet high in front and was stepped  back 6 inches at half its height from the ground. The stepback is  continued through the front wall of the small room on the west. Near the  center of the main room there is a well-finished doorway, directly over  the point where a cross wall in front of it comes in. This opening was  originally a double-notched or T-shape doorway, but at a later period  was filled up so as to leave only a rectangular orifice. The principal  entrance to the upper ruin was in front of this opening and a little to  the left of it. It will be noticed from an inspection of the plan that  the room into which this entrance opened was divided at a point about  4 feet back from the cliff edge by a stone wall not more than half the  thickness of the walls on either side of it. This cross wall is still  6 feet high on the side nearest the cliff, but there is no evidence of a  doorway or opening through it. The back rooms must have been reached by  a ladder in front, thence over the roof of the room. The cliff entrance  was a narrow doorway left in the front wall. The ends of the walls on  either side were smoothly finished, as in the western doorway.    There are many lumps of clay scattered about on the ground, some showing  impressions of small sticks. Apparently they are the debris of roofs.  There are also some fragments of pottery, principally corrugated ware.  The adobe walls in the upper ruin rest generally on rock, sometimes on  ashes and loose debris; in the lower ruin they rest usually on stone  foundations. The occurrence in this ruin of many features that are not  aboriginal suggests that it was one of the last to be abandoned in the  canyon, but there are certain features which make it seem probable that  the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19726"],[0,"The Door Through Space (#10)"],[1,"es, which I doubted--I  had no impulse to protest their offered prices.    I gathered up the rejected lenses, repacked them neatly, and helped  Kyral recrate the tools and instruments the Silent Ones had not wanted.  I noticed that in addition to the microscope lenses and surgical  instruments, they had taken all the fine wire. I couldn't imagine, and  didn't particularly want to imagine, what they intended to do with it.    On our way back through the streets, unshepherded this time, Kyral's  tongue was loosened as if with a great release from tension. \"They're  psychokinetics,\" he told me. \"Quite a few of the nonhuman races are. I  guess they have to be, having no eyes and no hands. But sometimes I  wonder if we of the Dry-towns ought to deal with them at all.\"    \"What do you mean?\" I asked, not really listening. I was thinking mostly  about the way the small objects had melted away and reappeared. The  sight had stirred some uncomfortable memory, a vague sense of danger. It  was not tangible enough for me to know why I feared it, but just a  subliminal uneasiness that kept prodding at me, like a tooth that isn't  quite aching yet.    Kyral said, \"We of Shainsa live between fire and flood. Terra on the one  hand, and on the other maybe something worse, who knows? We know so  little about the Silent Ones, and those like them. Who knows, maybe  we're giving them the weapons to destroy us--\" He broke off, with a  gasp, and stood staring down one of the streets.    It lay open and bare between two rows of round houses, and Kyral was  staring fixedly at a doorway which had opened there. I followed his  paralyzed gaze, and saw the girl.    Hair like spun black glass fell in hard waves around her shoulders, and  the red eyes smiled with alien malice, alien mischief, beneath the dark  crown of little stars. And the Toad God sprawled in hideous  embroideries across the white folds of her breast.    Kyral gulped hoarsely. His hand flew up as he clutched the charms strung  about his neck. I imitated the gesture mechanically, watching Kyral,  wondering if he would turn and run again. But he stood frozen for a  minute. Then the spell broke and he took one step toward the girl, arms  outstretched.    \"Miellyn!\" he cried, and there was heartbreak in his voice. And again,  the cry making ringing echoes in the strange street:    \"Miellyn! _Miellyn!_\"    This time it was the girl who whirled and fled. Her white robes  fluttered and I saw the twinkle of her flying feet as she vanished into  a space between the houses and was gone.    Kyral took one blind step down the street, then another. But before he  could burst into a run I had him by the arm, dragging him back to  sanity.    \"Man, you've gone mad! Chase, in a nonhuman town?\"    He struggled for a minute, then, with a harsh sigh, he said, \"It's all  right, I won't--\" and shook loose from my arm.    He did not speak again until we reached the gates of Canarsa and they  closed, silently and untouched, behind us. I had forgotten the place  already. I had space only to think of the girl, whose face I had not  forgotten since the moment when she saved me and disappeared. Now she  had appeared again to Kyral. What did it all mean?    I asked, as we walked toward the camp, \"Do you know that girl?\" But I  knew the question was futile. Kyral's face was closed, conceding  nothing, and his friendliness had vanished completely.    He said, \"Now I know you. You saved me from the catmen, and again in  Canarsa, so my hands are bound from harming you. But it is evil to have  dealings with those who have been touched by the Toad God.\" He spat  noisily on the ground, looked at me with loathing, and said, \"We will  reach Shainsa in three days. Stay away from me.\"          CHAPTER SEVEN      Shainsa, first in the chain of Dry-towns that lie in the bed of a  long-dried ocean, is set at the center of a great alkali plain; a dusty,  parched city bleached by a million years of sun. The houses are high,  spreading buildings with many rooms and wide windows. The poorer sort  were made of sun-dried brick, the more imposing being cut from the  bleached salt stone of the cliffs that rise behind the city.    News travels fast in the Dry-towns. If Rakhal were in the city, he'd  soon know that I was here, and guess who I was or why I'd come. I might  disguise myself so that my own sister, or the mother who bore me, would  not know me. But I had no illusions about my ability to disguise myself  from Rakhal. He had created the disguise that was me.    When the second sun set, red and burning, behind the salt cliffs, I knew  he was not in Shainsa, but I stayed on, waiting for something to happen.  At night I slept in a cubbyhole behind a wineshop, paying an inordinate  price for that very dubious privilege. And every day in the sleepy  silence of the blood-red noon I paced the public square of Shainsa.    This went on for four days. No one took the slightest notice of another  nameless man in a shabby shirtcloak, without name or identity or known  business. No one appeared to see me except the dusty children, with pale  fleecy hair, who played their patient games on the windswept curbing of  the square. They surveyed my scarred face with neither curiosity or  fear, and it occurred to me that Rindy might be such another as these.    If I had still been thinking like an Earthman, I might have tried to  question one of the children, or win their confidence. But I had a  deeper game in hand.    On the fifth day I was so much a fixture that my pacing went unnoticed  even by the children. On the gray moss of the square, a few  dried-looking old men, their faces as faded as their shirtcloaks and  bearing the knife scars of a hundred forgotten fights, drowsed on the  stone benches. And along the flagged walk at the edge of the square, as  suddenly as an autumn storm in the salt flats, a woman came walking.    She was tall, with a proud swinging walk, and a metallic clashing kept  rhythm to her swift steps. Her arms were fettered, each wrist bound with  a jeweled bracelet and the bracelets linked together by a long,  silver-gilt chain passed through a silken loop at her waist. From the  loop swung a tiny golden padlock, but in the lock stood an even tinier  key, signifying that she was a higher caste than her husband or consort,  that her fettering was by choice and not command.    She stopped directly before me and raised her arm in formal greeting  like a man. The chain made a tinkling sound in the hushed square as her  other hand was pulled up tight against the silken loop at her waist. She  stood surveying me for some moments, and finally I raised my head and  returned her gaze. I don't know why I had expected her to have hair like  spun black glass and eyes that burned with a red reflection of the  burning star.    This woman's eyes were darker than the poison-berries of the salt  cliffs, and her mouth was a cut berry that looked just as dangerous. She  was young, the slimness of her shoulders and the narrow steel-chained  wrists told me how very young she was, but her face had seen weather and  storms, and her dark eyes had weathered worse psychic storms than that.  She did not flinch at the sight of my scars, and met my gaze without  dropping her eyes.    \"You are a stranger. What is your business in Shainsa?\"    I met the direct question with the insolence it demanded, hardly moving  my lips. \"I have come to buy women for the brothels of Ardcarran.  Perhaps when washed you might be suitable. Who could arrange for your  sale?\"    She took the rebuke impassively, though the bitter crimson of her mouth  twitched a little in mischief or rage. But she made no sign. The battle  was joined between us, and I knew already that it would be fought to the  end.    From somewhere in her draperies, something fell to the ground with a  little tinkle. But I knew that trick too and I did not move. Finally she  went away without bending to retrieve it and when I looked around I saw  that all the fleece-haired children had stolen away, leaving their  playthings lying on the curbing. But one or two of the gaffers on the  stone benches, who were old enough to show curiosity without losing  face, were watching me with impassive eyes.    I could have asked the woman's name then, but I held back, knowing it  could only lessen the prestige I had gained from the encounter. I  glanced down, without seeming to do so, at the tiny mirror which had  fallen from the recesses of the fur robe. Her name might have been  inscribed on the reverse.    But I left it lying there to be picked up by the children when they  returned, and went back to the wineshop. I had accomplished my first  objective; if you can't be inconspicuous, be so damned conspicuous that  nobody can miss you. And that in itself is a fair concealment. How many  people can accurately describe a street riot?    I was finishing off a bad meal with a stone bottle of worse wine when  the _chak_ came in, disregarding the proprietor, and made straight for  me. He was furred immaculately white. His velvet muzzle was contracted  as if the very smells might soil it, and he kept a dainty paw  outstretched to ward off accidental contact with greasy counters or  tables or tapestries. His fur was scented, and his throat circled with a  collar of embroidered silk. This pampered minion surveyed me with the  innocent malice of an uninvolved nonhuman for merely human intrigues.    \"You are wanted in the Great House of Shanitha, thcarred man.\" He spoke  the Shainsa dialect with an affected lisp. \"Will it pleathe you, come  wis' me?\"    I came, with no more than polite protest, but was startled. I had not  expected the encounter to reach the Great House so soon. Shainsa's Great  House had changed hands four times since I had last been in Shainsa. I  wasn't overly anxious to appear there.    The white _chak_, as out of place in the rough Dry-town as a jewel in  the streets or a raindrop in"]]]
