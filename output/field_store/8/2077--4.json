Mahaffy says his work was intended to be a military history, compiled  from original documents and from personal observations made by himself  and other eye-witnesses. \"There can not be the smallest doubt,\" adds  Mahaffy, \"that, in the hands of Thucydides, the art of writing history  made an extraordinary stride and attained a perfection which no  subsequent Hellenic, and few modern writers have attained.\" He is  praised for the \"lofty dignity\" which he imparts to every subject. His  temper is so solemn and severe as to be \"strangely un-Attic.\" Among  his great and enduring merits is the fact that he has \"taught us to  know more of Greek interpolitical life than all other Greek writers  put together.\" No historian has been greater than he, not only in  dignity of language, but in calmness of judgment, in intellectual  force, and in breadth and acuteness of observation.]    [Footnote 19: From Book I of the \"History of the Peloponnesian War.\"  Translated by Benjamin Jowett.]    [Footnote 20: The Peloponnesians were the people of the peninsula  which forms the southern part of Greece, and which is now known as  Morea. In ancient times this territory was called the Peloponnesus.  Its people comprized the inhabitants of several political domains  called Achaia, Sicyonia, Corinthia, Argolis, Arcadia, Laconia,  Messenia, and Elis. Laconia was otherwise, and quite anciently, known  as Lacedaemon, its capital being the city of Sparta.]    [Footnote 21: Potidaea, the modern Pinaka, had revolted from Athens in  432 B.C., but did not capitulate until the end of the second year of  the Peloponnesian war.

During one of the Eastern  invasions of Greece, it fell into Persian hands.]    [Footnote 22: These walls connected Athens with its port, the Piraeus,  and were each about five miles long. They ran parallel and were  separated from each other by about 500 feet of space. This intervening  land was used for a carriage road, on either side of which were  houses. Thus was formed a continuous walled street from Athens to the  sea, so that communication in case of war was made secure.]    [Footnote 23: The battle of Marathon was fought in September, 490.

They [the enemy] had not been there [in Attica] many days when the  plague broke out at Athens for the first time. A similar disorder is  said to have previously smitten many places, particularly Lemnos;[27]  but there is no record of such a pestilence occurring elsewhere, or of  so great a destruction of human life. For a while physicians, in  ignorance of the nature of the disease, sought to apply remedies; but  it was in vain, and they themselves were among the first victims,  because they oftenest came into contact with it. No human art was of  any avail, and as to supplications in temples, inquiries of oracles,  and the like, they were utterly useless, and at last men were  overpowered by the calamity and gave up all remedies.    The disease is said to have begun south of Egypt in Ethiopia; thence  it descended into Egypt and Libya, and after spreading over the  greater part of the Persian empire, suddenly fell upon Athens. It  first attacked the inhabitants of the Piraeus, and it was supposed that  the Peloponnesians had poisoned the cisterns, no conduits having as  yet been made there. It afterward reached the upper city, and then the  mortality became far greater. As to its probable origin or the causes  which might or could have produced such a disturbance of nature, every  man, whether a physician or not, will give his own opinion. But I  shall describe its actual course, and the symptoms by which any one  who knows them beforehand may recognize the disorder should it ever  reappear. For I was myself attacked, and witnessed the sufferings of  others.    The season was admitted to have been remarkably free from ordinary  sickness; and if anybody was already ill of any other disease, it was  absorbed in this. Many who were in perfect health, all in a moment,  and without any apparent reason, were seized with violent heats in the  head and with redness and inflammation of the eyes. Internally the  throat and the tongue were quickly suffused with blood, and the breath  became unnatural and fetid. There followed sneezing and hoarseness; in  a short time the disorder, accompanied by a violent cough, reached the  chest; then fastening lower down, it would move the stomach and bring  on all the vomits of bile to which physicians have ever given names;  and they were very distressing. An ineffectual retching producing  violent convulsions attacked most of the sufferers; some as soon as  the previous symptoms had abated, others not until long afterward. The  body externally was not so very hot to the touch, nor yet pale; it was  of a livid color inclining to red, and breaking out in pustules and  ulcers. But the internal fever was intense; the sufferers could not  bear to have on them even the finest linen garment; they insisted on  being naked, and there was nothing which they longed for more eagerly  than to throw themselves into cold water. And many of those who had no  one to look after them actually plunged into the cisterns, for they  were tormented by unceasing thirst, which was not in the least  assuaged whether they drank little or much. They could not sleep; a  restlessness which was intolerable never left them.    While the disease was at its height the body, instead of wasting away,  held out amid these sufferings in a marvelous manner, and either they  died on the seventh or ninth day, not of weakness, for their strength  was not exhausted, but of internal fever, which was the end of most;  or, if they survived, then the disease descended into the bowels and  there produced violent ulcerations; severe diarrhea at the same time  set in, and at a later stage caused exhaustion, which finally with few  exceptions carried them off. For the disorder, which had originally  settled in the head, passed gradually through the whole body, and, if  a person got over the worst, would often seize the extremities and  leave its mark, attacking the privy parts and the fingers and the  toes; and some escaped with the loss of these, some with the loss of  their eyes. Some, again, had no sooner recovered than they were seized  with a forgetfulness of all things and knew neither themselves nor  their friends.    The malady took a form not to be described, and the fury with which it  fastened upon each sufferer was too much for human nature to endure.  There was one circumstance in particular which distinguished it from  ordinary diseases. The birds and animals, which feed on human flesh,  altho so many bodies were lying unburied, either never went near them  or died if they touched them. This was proved by a remarkable  disappearance of the birds of prey, which were not to be seen either  about the bodies or anywhere else; while in the case of the dogs the  fact was even more obvious, because they live with man.    Such was the general nature of the disease; I omit many strange  peculiarities which characterized individual cases. None of the  ordinary sicknesses attacked any one while it lasted, or, if they did,  they ended in the plague. Some of the sufferers died from want of  care, others equally who were receiving the greatest attention. No  single remedy could be deemed a specific; for that which did good to  one did harm to another. No constitution was of itself strong enough  to resist or weak enough to escape the attacks; the disease carried  off all alike and defied every mode of treatment. Most appalling was  the despondency which seized upon any one who felt himself sickening;  for he instantly abandoned his mind to despair and, instead of holding  out, absolutely threw away his chance of life. Appalling too was the  rapidity with which men caught the infection, dying like sheep if they  attended on one another, and this was the principal cause of  mortality. When they were afraid to visit one another, the sufferers  died in their solitude, so that many houses were empty because there  had been no one left to take care of the sick; or if they ventured  they perished, especially those who aspired to heroism. For they went  to see their friends without thought of themselves and were ashamed to  leave them, even at a time when the very relatives of the dying were  at last growing weary and ceased to make "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20910"],[0,"South American Fights and Fighters, and Other Tales of Adventure (#10)"],[1,"put to death, besides a numerous lot of his own  countrymen.  If we lop off two ciphers, the record is still bad enough.    In 1515, Pizarro and Morales, by direction of Pedrarias, made an  expedition to the south of the Gulf of San Miguel, into the territory  of a chieftain named Biru, from whom they early got into the habit of  calling the vague land believed to exist in the South Sea, the \"Land of  Biru,\" or Peru.  It was on this expedition that the Spaniards, hotly  pursued by the natives, stabbed their captives one by one and left them  dying at intervals in the pathway to check pursuit.  The practice was  effective enough and the action throws an interesting light on the  Spanish conquistador in general and Pizarro in particular.    It fell to the lot of Pizarro also to arrest his old captain, Balboa,  just as the latter was about to sail on a voyage of discovery to the  fabulous gold country of Peru in 1517.[1]  When Balboa and Pizarro had  crossed the Isthmus six years before, the son of the Cacique Comagre,  observing their avidity for gold, told them {57} that it abounded in a  mysterious land far toward the south, and the young Indian made a  little clay image of a llama further to describe the country.    To conquer that El Dorado had been Balboa's cherished dream.  Well  would it have been for the country had not the jealousy of Pedrarias  cut short Balboa's career by taking off his head, thus forcing the  enterprise to be undertaken by men of coarser mould and meaner clay.  It does not appear that Pizarro had any hand in the judicial murder of  Balboa, and no reflection can be made on his conduct for the arrest,  which was simply a matter of military duty, probably as distasteful to  Pizarro as it was surprising to Balboa.      II. The Terrible Persistence of Pizarro    In 1519, Pizarro was living in Panama in rather straightened  circumstances.  His life had been a failure.  A soldier of fortune, he  possessed little but his sword.  He was discontented, and although now  nearly fifty years of age, he still had ambition.  With remembrance of  what he had heard the young Indian chief tell Balboa, constantly  inciting him to a further grapple with hitherto coy and elusive  fortune, he formed a partnership with another poverty-stricken but  enterprising veteran named Diego de Almagro, whose parentage was as  obscure as Pizarro's--indeed more so, for he is reputed to have been a  foundling, although Oviedo describes him as the son of a Spanish  laboring man.  The two men supplemented each other.  Pizarro, although  astute and circumspect, was taciturn and chary of speech, though fluent  enough on occasion; he was slow in making up his mind, too, but when it  {58} was made up, resolute and tenacious of his purpose.  Almagro was  quick, impulsive, generous, frank in manner, \"wonderfully skilled in  gaining the hearts of men,\" but sadly deficient in other qualities of  leadership.  Both were experienced soldiers, as brave as lions and  nearly as cruel as Pedrarias himself--being indeed worthy disciples of  his school.    The two penniless, middle-aged soldiers of fortune determined to  undertake the conquest of that distant empire--a stupendous resolution.  Being almost without means, they were forced to enlarge the company by  taking on a third partner, a priest named Luque, who had, or could  command, the necessary funds.  With the sanction of Pedrarias, who  demanded and received a share, largely gratuitous, in the expedition,  they bought two of the four vessels which Balboa had caused to be taken  to pieces, transported them across the Isthmus, then set them up again,  and relaunched in the Pacific.  Enlisting one hundred men under his  banner, Pizarro set sail with the first vessel on the 14th of November,  1524.  Almagro was to follow after with reenforcements and supplies in  the second ship.  One Andagoya had made a short excursion southward  some time before, but they soon passed his latitude and were the first  white men to cleave those southern seas.    With only their hopes to guide them, without pilot, chart or  experience, being, I suspect, indifferent sailors and wretched  navigators, they crept along the forbidding shore in a crazy little  ship, landing from time to time, seeing no evidence of the empire,  being indeed unable to penetrate the jungles far enough to find out  much of anything about the countries they passed.  Finally, at one  place, that they afterwards called \"Starvation {59} Harbor,\" the men  rebelled and demanded to be led back.  They had seen and heard little  of importance.  There seemed to be nothing before them but death by  starvation.    Pizarro, however, who has been aptly described as \"terribly  persistent,\" refused to return.  He sent the ship back to the Isles of  Pearls for provisions, and grimly clung to the camp on the desolate  shore.  When twenty of his men were dead of starvation, the ship came  back with supplies.  In one of their excursions, during this wait at  Starvation Harbor, they had stumbled upon and surprised an Indian  village in which they found some clumsy gold ornaments, with further  tales of the El Dorado to the southward.  Instead of yielding to the  request of his men that they immediately return in the ship, therefore,  the indomitable Spaniard made sail southward.  He landed at various  places, getting everywhere little food and less gold, but everywhere  gaining more and more confirmation that the foundation of his dreams  was not \"the baseless fabric of a vision.\"    In one place they had a fierce battle with the Indians in which two of  the Spaniards were killed and a large number wounded.  Pizarro now  determined to return to Panama with the little gold he had picked up  and the large stories he had heard, there to recruit his band and to  start out again.  Almagro meanwhile had set forth with his ship with  sixty or seventy additional adventurers.  He easily followed the traces  of Pizarro on the shore but the ships did not meet.  Almagro went  farther south than Pizarro.  At one landing-place he had a furious  battle with the natives in which he lost an eye.  He turned back after  reaching the mouth of the river San Juan in about the fourth {60}  parallel of north latitude.  He, too, had picked up some little  treasure and a vast quantity of rumor to compensate for his lost optic  and bitter experience.  But the partners had little to show for their  sufferings and expenditures but rumors and hopes.    Pedrarias in disgust withdrew from the expedition for a price, which,  with the money necessary to send out a second expedition, was furnished  through Luque by the Licentiate Espinosa.  About September, 1526, with  two ships, the two captains set forth once more.  This time they had  with them a capable pilot named Ruiz.  They avoided the coast and  steered direct for the mouth of the San Juan River.  Pizarro surprised  a village here, carried off some of the natives, and a considerable  amount of gold.  This Almagro, as the best \"persuader,\" took back to  Panama in the hope that by exhibiting it he could gain much needed  reenforcements for their expedition.    The ships were very much undermanned.  The experience of the first  expedition, as related by the survivors, had been so horrible that it  was with difficulty that they could get anybody to go with them on the  second.  Pizarro agreed to remain at the mouth of the river and examine  the vicinity, while Ruiz with the second ship sailed southward to see  what he could discover.  Pizarro's men found no gold, although they  explored the country with prodigious labor.  Indians fell upon them, at  one time killing fourteen who had stranded in a canoe on the bank of a  river.  Many other Spaniards perished, and all except Pizarro and a few  of the stoutest hearts begged to return to Panama.    Ruiz came back just as they had begun to despair.  He had crossed the  Equator, the first European to {61} cross it from the north, and had  sailed half a degree south from the line.[2]    He brought back some Indians, further specimens of gold and silver  ornaments, exquisitely woven woollen garments, _et cetera_, which he  had taken from a craft cruising near the shore, which were proofs  positive of the existence of the long-desired country.    Almagro now made his appearance with reenforcements and the keels were  soon turned to the south.  Coasting along the shore, they saw  increasing evidence of cultivation in the valleys and uplands, backed  by the huge snow-crowned range of the Andes.  Large villages appeared  here and there.  Finally, they anchored opposite a considerable town  laid out in well-defined streets, containing about two thousand houses,  many of them built of stone.  From their position close to the shore  they thought that they could make out that the inhabitants wore  ornaments of gold.  Several canoes approached the ship, one of them  crowded with warriors carrying a species of gold mask as an ensign.    There appeared to be at least ten thousand warriors assembled on the  shore but Pizarro landed with the few horses which he had brought along  in the ship.  A sharp engagement ensued, and the result might have been  disastrous to the Spaniards had not one of them fallen from his horse  during the fray.  This diversion of what they considered a single  animal into two, both living, alarmed the Indians so much, that they  desisted from the attack and withdrew, the Spaniards taking advantage  of the chance to return to the ships.    What to do next was the problem.  They had not {62} sufficient force or  supplies with them to encounter the natives, or conquer or even explore  the country.  The expedition was about as meagrely equipped as it well  could be and be an expedition at all.  There were long discussions on  the ships and a fierce quarrel between the two partners.  Finally, it  was composed outwardly, and it was decided that Pizarro should remain  at the"]]]
