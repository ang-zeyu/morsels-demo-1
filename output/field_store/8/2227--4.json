The Indus  below Kalabagh once ran through the heart of what is now the Thal  desert. We know that in 1245 A.D. Multan was in the Sind Sagar Doab  between the Indus and the united streams of the Jhelam, Chenab, and  Ravi. The Bias had then no connection with the Sutlej, but ran in a bed  of its own easily to be traced to-day in the Montgomery and Multan  districts, and joined the Indus between Multan and Uch. The Sutlej was  still flowing in the Hakra bed. Indeed its junction with the Bias near  Harike, which probably led to a complete change in the course of the  Bias, seems only to have taken place within the last 150 years[2].    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 2: Raverty's \"The Mehran of Sind and its Tributaries,\" in  _Journal of Asiatic Society of Bengal_, 1897.]          CHAPTER IV    GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES      ~Extent of Geological Record.~--Although the main part of the Panjab plain  is covered by a mantle of comparatively recent alluvium, the provinces  described in this book display a more complete record of Indian  geological history than any other similar area in the country. The  variety is so great that no systematic or sufficient description could  be attempted in a short chapter, and it is not possible, therefore, to  do more in these few pages than give brief sketches of the patches of  unusual interest.    ~Aravalli System.~--In the southern and south-eastern districts of the  Panjab there are exposures of highly folded and metamorphosed rocks  which belong to the most ancient formations in India. These occupy the  northern end of the Aravalli hills, which form but a relic of what must  have been at one time a great mountain range, stretching roughly  south-south-west through Rajputana into the Bombay Presidency. The  northern ribs of the Aravalli series disappear beneath alluvial cover in  the Delhi district, but the rocks still underlie the plains to the west  and north-west, their presence being revealed by the small promontories  that peep through the alluvium near the Chenab river, standing up as  small hills near Chiniot in the Shahpur, Jhang, and Lyallpur districts.    The Salt Range in the Jhelam and Shahpur districts, with a western  continuation in the Mianwali district to and beyond the Indus, is the  most interesting part of the Panjab to the geologist. It contains  notable records of three distinct eras in geological history. In  association with the well-known beds of rock-salt, which are being  extensively mined at Kheora, occur the most ancient fossiliferous  formations known in India, corresponding in age with the middle and  lower part of the Cambrian system of Europe. These very ancient strata  immediately overlie the red marls and associated rock-salt beds, and it  is possible that they have been thrust over bodily to occupy this  position, as we have no parallel elsewhere for the occurrence of great  masses of salt in formation older than the Cambrian.    The second fragment of geological history preserved in the Salt Range is  very much younger, beginning with rocks which were formed in the later  part of the Carboniferous period. The most remarkable feature in this  fragment is a boulder-bed, resting unconformably on the Cambrian strata  and including boulders of various shapes and sizes, which are often  faceted and striated in a way indicative of glacial action. Several of  the boulders belong to rocks of a peculiar and unmistakable character,  such as are found _in situ_ on the western flanks of the Aravalli Range,  some 750 miles to the south. The glacial conditions which gave rise to  these boulder-beds were presumably contemporaneous with those that  produced the somewhat similar formation lying at the base of the great  coal-bearing system in the Indian peninsula. The glacial boulder-bed  thus offers indirect evidence as to the age of the Indian coal-measures,  for immediately above this bed in the Salt Range there occur sandstones  containing fossils which have affinities with the Upper Carboniferous  formations of Australia, and on these sandstones again there lie  alternations of shales and limestones containing an abundance of fossils  that are characteristic of the Permo-Carboniferous rocks of Russia.  These are succeeded by an apparently conformable succession of beds of  still younger age, culminating in a series of shales, sandstones, and  limestones of unmistakably Triassic age.    There is then an interruption in the record, and the next younger series  preserved occurs in the western part of the Salt Range as well as in the  hills beyond the Indus. This formation is of Upper Jurassic age,  corresponding to the well-known beds of marine origin preserved in  Cutch. Then follows again a gap in the record, and the next most  interesting series of formations found in the Salt Range become of great  importance from the economic as well as from the purely scientific point  of view; these are the formations of Tertiary age.    The oldest of the Tertiary strata include a prominent limestone  containing Nummulitic fossils, which are characteristic of these Lower  Tertiary beds throughout the world. Here, as in many parts of  North-Western India, the Nummulitic limestones are associated with coal  which has been largely worked. The country between the Salt Range  plateau and the hilly region away to the north is covered by a great  stretch of comparatively young Tertiary formations, which were laid down  in fresh water after the sea had been driven back finally from this  region. The incoming of fresh-water conditions was inaugurated by the  formation of beds which are regarded as equivalent in age to those known  as the Upper Nari in Sind and Eastern Baluchistan, but the still later  deposits, belonging to the well-known Siwalik series, are famous on  account of the great variety and large size of many of the vertebrate  fossil remains which they have yielded. In these beds to the north of  the Salt Range there have been found remains of Dinotherium, forms  related to the ancestors of the giraffe and various other mammals, some  of them, like the Sivatherium, Mastodon, and Stegodon, being animals of  great size. On the northern side of the Salt Range three fairly  well-defined divisions of the Siwalik series have been recognised, each  being conspicuously fossiliferous--a feature that is comparatively rare  in the Siwalik hills further to the south-east, where these rocks were  first studied. The Siwalik series of the Salt Range are thus so well  developed that this area might be conveniently regarded as the type  succession for the purpose of correlating isolated fragmentary  occurrences of the same general series in northern and western India. To  give an idea as to the age of these rocks, it will be sufficient to  mention that the middle division of the series corresponds roughly to  the well-known deposits of Pikermi and Samos.    ~Kashmir~ deserves special mention, as it is a veritable paradise for the  geologist. Of the variety of problems that it presents one might mention  the petrological questions connected with the intrusion of the great  masses of granite, and their relation to the slates and associated  metamorphic rocks. Of fossiliferous systems there is a fine display of  material ranging in age from Silurian to Upper Trias, and additional  interest is added by the long-continued volcanic eruptions of the  \"Panjal trap.\" Students of recent phenomena have at their disposal  interesting problems in physiography, including a grand display of  glaciers, and the extensive deposits of so-called _karewas_, which  appear to have been formed in drowned valleys, where the normal  fluviatile conditions are modified by those characteristic of lakes. The  occurrence of sapphires in Zanskar gives the State also an interest to  the mineralogist and connoisseur of gem-stones.    Of this kaleidoscopic assemblage of questions the ones of most immediate  interest are connected with the Silurian-Trias succession in the Kashmir  valley, for here we have a connecting-link between the marine formations  of the Salt Range area and those which are preserved in greater  perfection in Spiti and other parts of the Tibetan highlands, stretching  away to the south-east at the back of the great range of crystalline  snow-covered peaks.    In this interesting part of Kashmir the most important feature to Indian  geologists is the occurrence of plant remains belonging to genera  identical with those that occur in the lower part of the great  coal-bearing formation of Peninsular India, known as the Gondwana  system. Until these discoveries were made in Kashmir about ten years ago  the age of the base of the Gondwanas was estimated only on indirect  evidence, partly due to the assumption that glacial conditions in the  Salt Range and those at the base of the Gondwanas were contemporaneous,  and partly due to analogy with the coal measures of Australia and South  Africa. In Kashmir the characteristic plant remains of the Lower  Gondwanas are found associated with marine fossils in great abundance,  and these permit of a correlation of the strata with the upper part of  the Carboniferous system of the European standard stratigraphical scale.    Kashmir seems to have been near the estuary of one of the great rivers  that formerly flowed over the ancient continent of _Gondwanaland_ (when  India and South Africa formed parts of one continental mass) into the  great Eurasian Ocean known as _Tethys_. As the deposits formed in this  great ocean give us the principal part of our data for forming a  standard stratigraphical "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24583"],[0,"Langstroth on the Hive and the Honey-Bee: A Bee Keeper's Manual (#10)"],[1,"some of the doctrines of revealed religion, is not  equally unphilosophical. Neither our ignorance of all the facts  necessary to their full elucidation, nor our inability to harmonize  these facts in their mutual relations and dependencies, will justify us  in rejecting any truth which God has seen fit to reveal, either in the  book of nature, or in His holy word. The man who would substitute his  own speculations for the divine teachings, has embarked, without rudder  or chart, pilot or compass, upon the uncertain ocean of theory and  conjecture; unless he turns his prow from its fatal course, no Sun of  Righteousness will ever brighten for him the dreary expanse of waters;  storms and whirlwinds will thicken in gloom, on his \"voyage of life,\"  and no favoring gales will ever waft his shattered bark to a peaceful  haven.    The thoughtful reader will require no apology for the moralizing strain  of many of my remarks, nor blame a clergyman, if forgetting sometimes to  speak as the mere naturalist, he endeavors to find,        \"Tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,      _Sermons_ in '_bees_,' and 'GOD' in every thing.\"    To return to the point from which I have digressed; a new attempt to  account for the existence of so many drones. If a farmer persists in  what is called \"breeding in and in,\" that is, from the same stock  without changing the blood, it is well known that a rapid degeneracy is  the inevitable consequence. This law extends, as far as we know, to all  animal life, and even man is not exempt from its influence. Have we any  reason to suppose that the bee is an exception? or that ultimate  degeneracy would not ensue, unless some provision was made to counteract  the tendency to in and in breeding? If fecundation had taken place in  the hive, the queen bee must of necessity, have been impregnated by  drones from a common parent, and the same result must have taken place  in each successive generation, until the whole species would eventually  have \"run out.\" By the present arrangement, the young females, when they  leave the hive, often find the air swarming with drones, many of which  belong to other colonies, and thus by crossing the breed, a provision is  constantly made to prevent deterioration.    Experience has proved not only that it is unnecessary to impregnation  that there should be drones in the colony of the young queen, but that  this may be effected even when there are no drones in the Apiary, and  none except at some considerable distance. Intercourse takes place very  high in the air, (perhaps that less risk may be incurred from birds,)  and this is the more favorable to the continual crossing of stocks.    I am strongly persuaded that the decay of many flourishing stocks, even  when managed with great care, is to be attributed to the fact that they  have become enfeebled by \"close breeding,\" and are thus unable to resist  the injurious influences which were comparatively harmless when the bees  were in a state of high physical vigor. I shall, in the chapter on  Artificial Swarming, explain in what way, by the use of my hives, the  stock of bees may be easily crossed, when a cultivator is too remote  from other Apiaries, to depend upon its being naturally effected.      THE WORKERS OR COMMON BEES.    The number of workers in a hive varies very much. A good swarm ought to  contain 15,000 or 20,000; and in large hives, strong colonies which are  not reduced by swarming, frequently number two or three times as many,  during the height of the breeding season. We have well-authenticated  instances of stocks much more populous than this. The Polish hives will  hold several bushels, and yet we are informed by Mr. Dohiogost, that  they swarm regularly, and that the swarms are so powerful that \"they  resemble a little cloud in the air.\" I shall hereafter consider how the  size of the hive affects the number of bees that it may be expected to  produce.    The workers, (as has been already stated,) are all females whose ovaries  are too imperfectly developed to admit of their laying eggs. For a long  time, they were regarded as neither males nor females, and were called  Neuters; but more careful microscopic examinations have enabled us to  detect the rudiments of their ovaries, and thus to determine their sex.  The accuracy of these examinations has been verified by the well-known  facts respecting _fertile workers_.    Riem, a German Apiarian, first discovered that workers sometimes lay  eggs. Huber, in the course of his investigations on this subject,  ascertained that such workers were raised in hives that had lost their  queen, and in the vicinity of the royal cells in which young queens were  being reared. He conjectured that they received accidentally, a small  portion of the peculiar food of these infant queens, and in this way, he  accounted for their reproductive organs being more developed than those  of other workers. Workers reared in such hives, are in close proximity  to the young queens, and there is certainly much probability that some  of the royal jelly may be accidentally dropped into their cells; as, in  these hives, the queen cells when first commenced are parallel to the  horizon, instead of being perpendicular to it, as they are in other  hives. I do not feel confident, however, that they are not sometimes  bred in hives which have not lost their queen. The kind of eggs laid by  these fertile workers, has already been noticed. Such workers are seldom  tolerated in hives containing a fertile, healthy queen, though instances  of this kind have been known to occur. The worker is much smaller than  either the queen or the drone.[5] It is furnished with a tongue or  proboscis, of the most curious and complicated structure, which, when  not in use, is nicely folded under its abdomen; with this, it licks or  brushes up the honey, which is thence conveyed to its honey-bag. This  receptacle is not larger than a very small pea, and is so perfectly  transparent, as to appear when filled, of the same color with its  contents; it is properly the first stomach of the bee, and is surrounded  by muscles which enable the bee to compress it, and empty its contents  through her proboscis into the cells. (See Chapter on Honey.)    The hinder legs of the worker are furnished with a spoon-shaped hollow  or basket, to receive the pollen or bee bread which she gathers from the  flowers. (See Chapter on Pollen.)    Every worker is armed with a formidable sting, and when provoked, makes  instant and effectual use of her natural weapon. The sting, when  subjected to microscopic examination, exhibits a very curious and  complicated mechanism. \"It is moved[6] by muscles which, though  invisible to the eye, are yet strong enough to force the sting, to the  depth of one twelfth of an inch, through the thick skin of a man's hand.  At its root are situated two glands by which the poison is secreted:  these glands uniting in one duct, eject the venemous liquid along the  groove, formed by the junction of the two piercers. There are four barbs  on the outside of each piercer: when the insect is prepared to sting,  one of these piercers, having its point a little longer than the other,  first darts into the flesh, and being fixed by its foremost beard, the  other strikes in also, and they alternately penetrate deeper and deeper,  till they acquire a firm hold of the flesh with their barbed hooks, and  then follows the sheath, conveying the poison into the wound. The action  of the sting, says Paley, affords an example of the union of _chemistry_  and mechanism; of chemistry in respect to the _venom_, which can produce  such powerful effects; of mechanism as the sting is a compound  instrument. The machinery would have been comparatively useless had it  not been for the chemical process, by which in the insect's body _honey_  is converted into _poison_; and on the other hand, the poison would have  been ineffectual, without an instrument to wound, and a syringe to  inject it.\"    \"Upon examining the edge of a very keen razor by the microscope, it  appears as broad as the back of a pretty thick knife, rough, uneven, and  full of notches and furrows, and so far from anything like sharpness,  that an instrument, as blunt as this seemed to be, would not serve even  to cleave wood. An exceedingly small needle being also examined, it  resembled a rough iron bar out of a smith's forge. The sting of a bee  viewed through the same instrument, showed everywhere a polish amazingly  beautiful, without the least flaw, blemish, or inequality, and ended in  a point too fine to be discerned.\"    The extremity of the sting being barbed like an arrow, the bee can  seldom withdraw it, if the substance into which she darts it is at all  tenacious. In losing her sting she parts with a portion of her  intestines, and of necessity, soon perishes.    As the loss of the sting is always fatal to the bees, they pay a dear  penalty for the exercise of their patriotic instincts; but they always  seem ready, (except when they have taken \"a drop too much,\" and are  gorged with honey,) to die in defence of their home and treasures; or as  the poet has expressed it, they        \"Deem life itself to vengeance well resign'd,      Die on the wound, and leave their sting behind.\"    Hornets, wasps and other stinging insects are able to withdraw their  stings from the wound. I have never seen any attempt to account for the  exception in the case of the honey bee. But if the Creator intended the  bee for the use of man, as He most certainly did, has He not given it  this peculiarity, to make it less formidable, and therefore more  completely subject to human control? Without a sting, it would have  stood no chance of defending its tempting sweets against a host of  greedy depredators; but if it could sting a number of times, it would be  much more difficult to bring it into a state of thorough domestication.
