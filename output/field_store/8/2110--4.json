[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],[0,"Milton (#10)"],[1,"he sees that you are in so  special a manner the favoured object of the Divine regard.\" His mind is  full of the achievements of Cyrus, Epaminondas, and Scipio; he denies to  the Protector no honour that may be drawn from these high comparisons.  And then, as in _Lycidas_, so also in _The Second Defence of the People  of England_, Milton concludes his celebration of another by a return to  himself and his pride in a duty fulfilled. Opportunity, he declares, is  offered for great achievements; if it be not seized, posterity will judge  \"that men only were wanting for the execution; while they were not  wanting who could rightly counsel, exhort, inspire, and bind an unfading  wreath of praise round the brows of the illustrious actors in so glorious  a scene.\"    In the measures that he recommends to Cromwell as necessary for the  public welfare, his mistakes are the generous errors of an idealist. He  writes as if all were either Cromwells or Miltons, and worthy of the  fullest measure of liberty. \"Now the time seems come,\" he exclaims,  \"wherein Moses, the great prophet, may sit in heaven rejoicing to see  that memorable and glorious wish of his fulfilled, when not only our  seventy elders, but all the Lord's people, are become prophets.\" His  general propositions on the function of law are unimpeachable. \"He who  wisely would restrain the reasonable soul of man within due bounds, must  first himself know perfectly how far the territory and dominion extends  of just and honest liberty. As little must he offer to bind that which  God hath loosened as to loosen that which He hath bound. The ignorance  and mistake of this high point hath heaped up one huge half of all the  misery that hath been since Adam.\" But with the application to issues of  the day it appears that the mistake has been all one way. \"Laws are  usually worse in proportion as they are more numerous.\" The free spirit  of man can govern him without \"a garrison upon his neck of empty and  over-dignified precepts.\"    Whether he treat of religion, of education, of divorce, or of civil  government, the error is always the same, a confidence too absolute in  the capacity and integrity of the reasonable soul of man. A liturgy, for  example, is intolerable, because it is a slur upon the extemporary  effusions of ministers of the Gospel. \"Well may men of eminent gifts set  forth as many forms and helps to prayer as they please; but to impose  them on ministers lawfully called and sufficiently tried ... is a  supercilious tyranny, impropriating the Spirit of God to themselves.\"  Milton, we know, did not habitually attend public worship at any of the  conventicles of the sectaries, or perhaps he might have found reason to  modify this censure.    Some of his impassioned pleadings were possibly not wholly without effect  on the politics of the time. It is interesting, at any rate, to find  Cromwell, in his letter written in 1650 to the Governor of Edinburgh  Castle, adopting one of the main arguments of the _Areopagitica_, and  enforcing it against the Presbyterians by a figure which may have been  borrowed from that tract. \"Your pretended fear,\" he writes, \"lest error  should step in, is like the man who would keep all wine out of the  country lest men should be drunk. It will be found an unjust and unwise  jealousy to deprive a man of his natural liberty upon a supposition that  he may abuse it. When he doth abuse it, judge.\" But Cromwell never  applied his logic to the removal of the restraint upon printing, which by  this same argument Milton had judged to be \"the greatest displeasure and  indignity to a free and knowing spirit that can be put upon him.\" He was  too practical a statesman to be frightened into logic by a little paper  shot.    Logical Milton always was. He learned little or nothing from the  political events of his time. He was throughout consistent with himself;  prepared to take any risks that his advocacy might bring upon him, not  prepared to forego or modify his opinions because of human incompetence  or human imbecility. Between the consistent and unflinching Royalists on  the one hand, and the consistent and unflinching Republicans on the  other, the most of the population of England wavered and hung. But  half-measures and half-heartedness were alike unintelligible to Milton.  He fell upon the Presbyterians when they showed a disposition to palter  with the logical consequences of their own action, and scourged them  unmercifully. They had \"banded and borne arms against their king,  divested him, disanointed him, nay, cursed him all over in their pulpits,  and their pamphlets.\" But when once the king was brought to trial, then  \"he who but erewhile in the pulpits was a cursed tyrant, an enemy to God  and saints, laden with all the innocent blood spilt in three kingdoms,  and so to be fought against, is now, though nothing penitent or altered  from his first principles, a lawful magistrate, a sovereign lord, the  Lord's anointed, not to be touched, though by themselves imprisoned.\" He  prepares for them a similar dilemma, between the horns of which they have  since been content to dwell, in his treatment of the question of divorce:  \"They dare not affirm that marriage is either a sacrament or a mystery  ... and yet they invest it with such an awful sanctity, and give it such  adamantine chains to bind with, as if it were to be worshipped like some  Indian deity, when it can confer no blessing upon us, but works more and  more to our misery.\"    Milton's astonishment and indignation in cases like these are a  convincing evidence of his inability to understand average politics, and  that world of convenience, precaution, and compromise which is their  native place. His own tenacity and constancy have something grim about  them. Andrew Marvell, in his tract called _The Rehearsal Transposed_,  speaking of the intolerance of his adversary, Samuel Parker, says: \"If  you have a mind to die, or to be of his party (there are but these two  conditions), you may perhaps be rendered capable of his charity.\" Neither  of these two conditions was a certain title to the charity of Milton. In  the _Eikonoklastes_ he pursues the dead king with jibe and taunt, and  exults over the smallest advantage gained. The opening words of the tract  show him conscious of the difficulty and delicacy of the part he acted in  making war on one who had \"paid his final debt to nature and his faults.\"  But what then? If the king, being dead, could speak, the dead king must  be answered, and his gauntlet taken up \"in the behalf of liberty and the  commonwealth.\"    The manner in which he conducts this and other controversies has brought  upon Milton's head universal reproach. He is intemperate and violent, he  heaps up personal scurrilities against his adversaries, and triumphs in  their misfortunes. There is nothing wherein our age more differs from his  than in the accepted rules governing controversy, and he has lost  estimation accordingly. Yet not a few critics, it may be suspected, have  allowed their dislike of the thing he says to hurry them into an  exaggerated censure on his manner of saying it. It is important, in the  first place, to remember that his violences are not the violences of the  hired rhetorician. He was prepared to stand by what he wrote, and he knew  the risks that he ran in those shifting and uncertain times. His life was  in danger at the Restoration, and was saved by some unknown piece of good  fortune or clemency. He was not a coward reviler, a \"tongue-doughty  giant,\" whose ears are the most delicate part about him, but an open  fighter, who got as good as he gave. And then it is sometimes forgotten  that the most scurrilous of Milton's pamphlets were written in Latin, a  language which has always enjoyed an excellent liberty in the matter of  personal abuse; while even his English pamphlets, wherein at times he  shows almost as pretty a talent in reviling, were written for an audience  inured to the habitual amenities of Latin controversy. Sir Thomas More  was famous for his knack of calling bad names in good Latin, yet his  posterity rise up and call him blessed. Milton, like More, observed the  rules of the game, which allowed practices condemned in the modern  literary prize-ring. He calls Salmasius a poor grammarian, a pragmatical  coxcomb, a silly little scholar, a mercenary advocate, a loggerhead, a  hare-brained blunderbuss, a witless brawler, a mongrel cur; he reproaches  him with the domestic tyranny put upon him by that barking she-wolf, his  wife, and winds up with an elaborate comparison (not wholly unfamiliar to  modern methods of controversy) between Salmasius and Judas. With his  nameless opponent in the Divorce quarrel he deals--this time in  English--no less contemptuously: \"I mean not to dispute philosophy with  this pork, who never read any.\" The creature is a conspicuous gull, an  odious fool, a dolt, an idiot, a groom, a rank pettifogger, a  presumptuous losel, a clown, a vice, a huckster-at-law, whose \"jabberment  is the flashiest and the fustiest that ever corrupted in such an  unswilled hogshead.\" \"What should a man say more to a snout in this  pickle? What language can be low and degenerate enough?\" In the _Apology_  for Smectymnuus, Milton sets forth his own defence of his acrimony and  violence: \"There may be a sanctified bitterness,\" he remarks, \"against  the enemies of the truth;\" and he dares to quote the casuistry of Electra  in _Sophocles_:--      'Tis you that say it, not I. You do the deeds,    And your ungodly deeds find me the words.    The exigencies of controversy revealed in Milton not only an  inexhaustible store of coarse invective, but also, at times, the flash of  real wit. \"My fate,\" he says, with some sense of the incongruity of the  thing, \"extorts from me a talent of sport, which I had thought to hide in  a napkin.\" We are privileged to hear Milton laugh. It is not mirthful nor  gentle "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21687"],[0,"The Youngest Girl in the Fifth: A School Story (#10)"],[1,"were present, and if  she were to get a prize, how pleased they would be!    The proceedings began with the usual speeches from the chairman and  others. Gwen had heard these every year, and they were always pretty  much on the same theme. It is hard to be original at prize-givings,  and the gentlemen who had been asked to \"say a few words\" might be  forgiven if their remarks were somewhat hackneyed. Miss Roscoe read  the examiners' report on the school, and the successes in the  Matriculation and the Senior and Junior Oxfords. These the girls knew  already, so, though they clapped heartily, it did not cause much  excitement. Everyone was waiting in suspense for the prize list.    Miss Roscoe always began with the lowest Form, so the first to walk up  to the platform was a small kindergarten child, who had won honours  for \"general improvement\". Neither Giles nor Basil had any luck; they  were too erratic to be serious students, but when it came to the turn  of the Middle Second, Lesbia Gascoyne was awarded the prize for plain  sewing. A perfect storm of clapping greeted pretty Lesbia as she  returned down the hall to her place. She was a tremendous favourite at  Rodenhurst, and Seniors and Juniors alike applauded. It was the first  time she had ever distinguished herself in any way, and though it was  only for plain sewing, the girls were ready to give her an ovation. At  last the Upper Fourth was reached, and Gwen knew that as she had taken  her exams with her old Form (the Middle Fourth it had been in July)  her name would be still on that list.    \"First prize for Mathematics, Gwen Gascoyne,\" read Miss Roscoe.    Gwen's heart thumped, for a moment she did not move, till Netta gave  her an admonishing push, then she walked up the hall. The Mayor handed  her a volume of Coleridge's poems, handsomely bound in calf, and  emblazoned with the school arms; he smiled pleasantly as he did so,  and added a word of compliment. Gwen murmured \"Thank you\", and turned  away. Father was clapping his loudest on the platform, and there was a  nervous little applause from the rest of the family and from Netta,  but that was all. Not a single girl in either Gwen's old Form or her  new one gave her the least sign of appreciation. The colour flamed  into her face as she made her way back to her seat. It is hard at any  time to be unpopular, but it is a cruel thing when the lack of favour  is displayed before a public audience. Gwen stuck her nose in the air,  and put on the most defiant, don't care expression she could assume,  but she felt the slight deeply, especially when she heard the hearty  reception given to Iris Watson, who had won the Languages medal.    \"Never mind, childie!\" said Mr. Gascoyne, when at \"good night\" time  that evening, in the safe sanctuary of Father's study, she broke down,  and burst out crying; \"you did your best, and you deserved your prize.  That's the main thing!\"    \"I shall hate the prize now!\" sobbed Gwen. \"I can't bear to look at  it; it will always remind me of this horrid afternoon. Why should they  have been so nasty to me? They clapped Lesbia!\"    \"Gwen, you're not jealous?\" Father's voice was just a trifle anxious.    \"No, no!\" gulped Gwen emphatically. \"Lesbia's a darling; I don't  wonder people are fond of her. But oh, Dad, it is hard sometimes to be  left out in the cold!\"    \"Very hard. Many older and wiser people than you have felt that. Yet  to bear neglect well is one of the bravest things in life. Don't worry  about not being appreciated; your own self-respect is worth more to  you than the opinion of other people. If you're quite sure you're  doing your duty, you can afford to ignore what the world thinks.\"    \"I don't know why I should be so unpopular,\" sighed Gwen, squeezing  Father's hand tightly, and rubbing her cheek against his coat sleeve,  as if there were something comforting in the very feel of the cloth.    \"You must live it down. It may take a long time, and a great deal of  patience, but I'm sure you'll win, and the girls will be proud of you  yet.\"    \"Proud! They may get to tolerate me, but I don't believe I'll ever  make them like me, Daddy!\"    \"Courage! We never know what we can do till we try. If you want to be  liked, make yourself wanted. Good night, childie! Cheer up! The  world's not such a bad place, after all.\"    \"Not while you're in it!\" said Gwen, kissing the dear, plain face that  was so like her own.          CHAPTER VII    Dick Chambers      Since the afternoon when Gwen had stopped behind in Stedburgh to  arrange about the broken china, and had been obliged to walk home, she  had seen nothing more of Dick Chambers. She looked out for him every  morning on the bus, but he was not there, and she was just wondering  what had become of him when he turned up in the most unexpected  quarter. It was the Saturday morning after the prize-giving. Saturday  was a whole holiday, and therefore a blissful day, every moment of  which was appreciated. Gwen was returning about ten o'clock from an  errand she had been sent to do in the village, and as she opened the  Parsonage gate she saw in the middle of the front walk a boyish figure  that looked familiar.    \"Hello! What are you doing here?\" she exclaimed.    \"Come on business of a rather particular character,\" grinned Dick.  \"Didn't you know your Father's coaching me?\"    \"He never said so!\"    \"He is, though. I'm to come three days a week, from nine to ten, and  I've just made a start this morning. I say, he's a ripping chap!\"    \"I agree with you there,\" remarked Gwen. \"But why aren't you going to  school?\"    \"Thereby hangs a tale! I happened to do an idiotic thing one  afternoon--fainted in the lab, and had to be picked up in the midst of  fragments of glass that I'd smashed to smithereens. Then Dad got some  wretched specialist to come down and see me, and the fellow said I  must stop school for this term at any rate.\"    \"Oh, I'm so sorry! Do you feel ill?\"    \"No. I'm all right--but it's rather rotten, for I'm knocked off  'footer'.\"    \"How sickening for you! I know how wild I should be if I mightn't play  hockey. What may you do?\"    \"Only just loaf about--not even golf.\"    \"May you go walks?\"    \"Oh, yes! but it's rather slow mooning about on the moors by oneself.\"    \"Have you been to see Stack Head, where the sea-birds build? Or the  chasms? Oh! you ought to go there! I'll show you the way if you like!\"    \"I wish you would!\"    \"There'd be heaps of time this morning--that's to say if I may go,\"  added Gwen, suddenly recollecting that she had promised Beatrice on  her honour not to go anywhere without leave. \"Oh, here's Dad, so I can  ask him.\"    \"Yes, by all means take Dick to Stack Head, the walk will do him  good,\" replied Mr. Gascoyne. \"Be careful, and don't scramble about too  much, that's all--those cliffs are dangerous, remember!\"    \"We'll go as cautiously as two pussy-cats,\" said Gwen.    \"Hardly an apt simile!\" laughed Mr. Gascoyne, pointing to Pluto, the  black Persian, that was careering madly up a tree at the moment.  \"However, you're used to Skelwick rocks, and Dick will have to learn  his footing. Only please don't learn it at the expense of your neck,  Dick! We haven't gone far enough with the Latin prose yet!\"    \"You needn't be afraid for me, sir, though I came a cropper over old  Cicero this morning,\" laughed Dick.    It was a beautiful, sunny day in early November; one of those late  autumn days when a little crisp hoar frost lingers in the hollows, but  in the full sunshine it is almost as warm as summer. Gwen fetched a  favourite stick, her indispensable companion on the moors, and,  discarding her jacket, set forth joyously for a five-mile tramp. She  loved the great bare headland that rose behind the Parsonage; there  was a sense of freedom in leaving the houses of the village, and  seeing only sea and sky around, and feeling the short, fine grass  under her feet. It was a stiff climb to the top of the plateau, but  once up there was a tolerably flat walk of about a couple of miles to  the jagged rocks that formed the end of the promontory.    \"Isn't it glorious?\" said Gwen, when, the scrambling part finished,  they sat for a moment or two on a rock to take breath. Below lay the  clear, grey, even, shimmering surface of the sea, a little hazy at the  horizon, and changing to deepest green as it neared the cliffs, where  the sea-birds wheeled round screaming in sheer joy of life. \"Don't you  feel as if you could take a jump from the edge and just go sailing  down like a gull, and land gently on the water, and float off?\"    \"Better not try the experiment unless you provide yourself with a  parachute! An aeroplane could make a good start up here. Do you ever  get any guillemots' eggs? Or puffins'?\"    \"Not often; though sometimes the lighthouse men bring us a few. Are  you collecting eggs?\"    \"Rather! I've got nearly five hundred. I could do with a razor-bill's  or a puffin's.\"    \"You'll have to wait till next summer. June and July are the best  months. I can show you where the birds sit, though. They haven't  proper nests, they just squat on the rocks, packed as close together  as sardines. It's wonderful to see them. And the noise they make! No,  it isn't here, it's over by the chasms; we shall get there soon.\"    Half an hour's brisk walking brought them to what must have seemed to  the ancient inhabitants of these islands the end of the world. The  headland descended in a sheer precipice into the water, while  wicked-looking rocks showed a black point here and there among the  surf as a warning to any vessel to give them a wide berth. The cliff  was hardly less dangerous than the rocks below, for its surface was  torn into great rugged chasms, each as deep as the sea level, though  often only a few feet in breadth. These curious natural rents wound in  tortuous course to the edge of the precipice, sometimes crossing one  another, and thus leaving islands stranded"]]]
