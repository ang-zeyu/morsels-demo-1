[20] Dean Patrick, in his supplement to _Gunton's History of        the Cathedral_, says it was famous for three things, \"a        stately front, a curious altar piece, and a beautiful cloister.\"        Mr. Davys, in his _Guide_, also says, \"we learn, from other        writings, that the stall-work, in its choir, was remarkably        fine, that its windows of painted glass were of a most superb        description, and that, in the number, and beauty of its monuments        and brasses, it excelled most of the other churches of the realm.        Its central tower, though then in an incomplete state, was much        finer than it now is, as it had a handsome octagon above what now        forms the central tower. The north western transept tower was        also adorned with a lofty spire. This spire, which was of wood        covered with lead, was taken down soon after this time.\"          [21] \"Wulfade was much addicted to hunting, and one day pursuing        a goodly hart, which being hotly pursued, took soil in a fountain        near unto the cell of St. Chad, who espying the hart weary, and        almost spent, was so compassionate towards him that he covered        him with boughs and leaves, conjecturing, as if heaven had some        design in the access and deportment of that beast. Presently        comes Prince Wulfade, and enquired of St. Chad concerning the        hart, who answered, That he was not a keeper of beasts, but the        souls of men, and that Wulfade was then, as an hart to the water        brooks, sent by God to the fountain of living water: which        Wulfade hearing with astonishment, entered into further        conference with St. Chad in his cell, and was by him baptized:        and returning with joy to his father's court, he secretly told        his brother Rufine of all that had passed, perswading him to be        baptized also; to which Rufine consenting, Wulfade brought him to        St. Chad, who likewise baptized this other brother.\"          [22] \"This Christian pair of brothers did often resort to a        private oratory, where they performed their devotions; but at        length being discovered to their father by the steward Werbode,        who instigated, and enflamed the fire of paternal fury against        the sons, King Wolfere, the father, watching the time when his        sons were gone to pray, followed them, and entering the oratory,        slew both his sons with his own hand; and he, and Werbode        demolishing the place, left the bodies of his sons buried in the        rubbish.\" \"Queen Ermenild, having searched for the bodies of her        sons, found them out, and giving them burial, [in one stone        coffin,] built in the same place where they were slain, a church        of stone.\"          [23] Dean Kipling, on the authority of tradition, is of opinion,        that St. Chad's well was in the quadrangle on the south side of        the minster, called the laurel court; but Gunton says, \"St. Chad        had his cell in the county of Stafford, was the first bishop of        Lichfield, where he founded the cathedral church, and there lieth        buried.\" And this assertion would appear to be born out by the        fact that the \"church of stone\" referred to in the previous note,        is known to have been erected at _Stone_, in Staffordshire.          [24] The present painted windows are of modern date, excepting        one or two, which are composed of fragments of the windows of the        cloisters above described.          CHAPTER IV.    _Historical account of the building of the monastery, and description  of the architectural peculiarities of the present cathedral._      Having in the preceding chapters given a brief history of the former  monastery and present cathedral of Peterborough, up to the present  time, it now remains for us to say something of its architectural  peculiarities, and to notice some of the remarkable relicts of  antiquity which are still to be found within its walls. It has already  been stated, that in the year 655, the foundation for a monastic  institution was laid at _Medeshamstede_; that it was completed seven  years afterwards;--and was destroyed by fire in 870. The architectural  character of the building at this period cannot be strictly  ascertained; but, from the accounts given of it by monkish writers, it  is supposed to have been of the pure Saxon style. The monastery was  again re-built in 966, and again destroyed by the lawless hands of  barbarian invaders. Five successive times did it undergo various  changes of ruin and desolation, until the year 1117, when a new  building was raised upon the foundations of the old one, and many  additions were made to it;--extending its circuit, and improving its  architectural appearance.    The immense stones which were laid as the foundation of the minster of  _Medeshamstede_, is a sufficient proof of the vastness and massive  strength of the building which was raised upon it;[25]--yet, as we have  no definite information respecting the size of the monastery, we must  leave it to be imagined by the reader, and proceed with the \"new  church,\" which was commenced in 1117, under the rule of John de Sais,  and which we have already noticed in the first chapter of our history.    This John was a Norman by birth, and an admirer of the Norman style of  architecture, which is discernable throughout the whole of this great  building. That there is a mixture of style, however, in the monastery,  is admitted on all hands;--nor could it well have been otherwise, if we  take into consideration the different character of the ages in which  additions were made to it. Still the leading features of the building  clearly show that they are of Norman origin; and in this opinion we are  supported by Mr. Britton, who says, \"I cannot consent to discontinue  this phrase, [viz. that the cathedral is a specimen of Norman  architecture,] although it offends certain critics, who manifest more  prejudice than discrimination in their reprobatory animadversion. That  the Normans not only employed a peculiar style and character in the  buildings of their own provence, and in England, after they possessed  this country, is sufficiently proved by history, by the older edifices  still remaining, and by the admission of the best informed antiquaries.  It seems to me therefore absurd, as well as false, to say there is no  Norman architecture--that the term is misapplied,--that the Normans  were incompetent either to invent a novelty in art, or improve upon any  thing of their Saxon predecessors. The instance of the building before  us, which is said by its monastic historians to have been raised  between the years 1117 and 1250, is sufficient evidence to confute the  reasoning, or rather dogmatic assertions, of those who wish to exalt  the Saxons by depreciating the Normans: and we have a still stronger  confutation of this theory in the style and general character of the  Trinity chapel, Canterbury, the history of which is well authenticated  and generally credited. That it is a novelty and great beauty in  architecture can only be disputed by those who are blinded by  prejudice, or influenced by obstinacy and bad taste.\"[26]    During the prelacy of Bishop Marsh, 1819-1839, great efforts were made  to restore the cathedral to its original beauty, under the auspices of  Dr. Monk, then Dean of Peterborough, and afterwards Bishop of  Gloucester. \"By him the noble west front, which he found in a very  ruinous state, was perfectly restored from top to bottom;  six-and-thirty windows were opened in various parts of the church,  which were built up, and two Norman doors were brought to light, which  had been hidden under mean depressed arches.\"    It may, perhaps, be desirable to describe the different portions of the  building in the order in which they present themselves to the visitor,  and in doing this, we shall avail ourselves of the excellent remarks  made by the Rev. Owen Davys, son of bishop Davys, in his work on the  cathedral, and also of the superior talent of a gentleman, formerly  well known in this city, (the Rev. T. Garbett,) who has investigated,  with great care, the whole plan of the building, and has laid the  result of his researches before the public.    [Sidenote: Western Gateway.]    First, then, is the ancient western gateway, built by Benedict, and  though it has since been much altered, a considerable part of the  original structure remains: \"The western side has been faced with  Perpendicular work, and an arch of that character has been built in  front of the original Norman arch, above which is a very elegant  arcade, the alternate arches of which have small windows within them;  these light the chamber over the gateway which occupies the situation  of the chapel of St. Nicholas. The lower roof of this gateway is a good  specimen of a plain Norman roof, being groined with bold cross ribs.  The arcades on the right and left hand, which have lately been very  judiciously restored, are also worthy of notice; one of the arches in  each arcade is considerably larger than the others, and forms a  door-way. Above the arch, on the east side of this gateway, is a window  which may strike the architect at first sight as being somewhat  peculiar. It is in reality a part of an ancient Perpendicular shrine,  which formerly existed in the cathedral, of which a portion is still  standing in the northern part of the new building; it was brought  there, and turned to its present use as a window, some time ago.\"    [Sidenote: Thomas a Becket's Chapel.]    On the left hand, as we pass through the gate, is the grammar  school-room, formerly the chapel of Thomas a Becket, who was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2097"],[0,"The Sign of the Four (#10)"],[1," near the water's edge at Lambeth. The third house on the right-hand  side is a bird-stuffer's: Sherman is the name.  You will see a weasel  holding a young rabbit in the window.  Knock old Sherman up, and tell  him, with my compliments, that I want Toby at once.  You will bring  Toby back in the cab with you.\"    \"A dog, I suppose.\"    \"Yes,--a queer mongrel, with a most amazing power of scent.  I would  rather have Toby's help than that of the whole detective force of  London.\"    \"I shall bring him, then,\" said I.  \"It is one now.  I ought to be back  before three, if I can get a fresh horse.\"    \"And I,\" said Holmes, \"shall see what I can learn from Mrs. Bernstone,  and from the Indian servant, who, Mr. Thaddeus tell me, sleeps in the  next garret.  Then I shall study the great Jones's methods and listen  to his not too delicate sarcasms. 'Wir sind gewohnt das die Menschen  verhoehnen was sie nicht verstehen.'  Goethe is always pithy.\"        Chapter VII    The Episode of the Barrel    The police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted Miss  Morstan back to her home.  After the angelic fashion of women, she had  borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker  than herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by the  side of the frightened housekeeper.  In the cab, however, she first  turned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping,--so sorely had  she been tried by the adventures of the night.  She has told me since  that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey.  She little  guessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of self-restraint  which held me back.  My sympathies and my love went out to her, even as  my hand had in the garden.  I felt that years of the conventionalities  of life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had this  one day of strange experiences.  Yet there were two thoughts which  sealed the words of affection upon my lips.  She was weak and helpless,  shaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her at a disadvantage to  obtrude love upon her at such a time.  Worse still, she was rich.  If  Holmes's researches were successful, she would be an heiress.  Was it  fair, was it honorable, that a half-pay surgeon should take such  advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about?  Might she not  look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker?  I could not bear to risk  that such a thought should cross her mind.  This Agra treasure  intervened like an impassable barrier between us.    It was nearly two o'clock when we reached Mrs. Cecil Forrester's. The  servants had retired hours ago, but Mrs. Forrester had been so  interested by the strange message which Miss Morstan had received that  she had sat up in the hope of her return.  She opened the door herself,  a middle-aged, graceful woman, and it gave me joy to see how tenderly  her arm stole round the other's waist and how motherly was the voice in  which she greeted her. She was clearly no mere paid dependant, but an  honored friend.  I was introduced, and Mrs. Forrester earnestly begged  me to step in and tell her our adventures.  I explained, however, the  importance of my errand, and promised faithfully to call and report any  progress which we might make with the case.  As we drove away I stole a  glance back, and I still seem to see that little group on the step, the  two graceful, clinging figures, the half-opened door, the hall light  shining through stained glass, the barometer, and the bright  stair-rods.  It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a  tranquil English home in the midst of the wild, dark business which had  absorbed us.    And the more I thought of what had happened, the wilder and darker it  grew.  I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I  rattled on through the silent gas-lit streets.  There was the original  problem:  that at least was pretty clear now. The death of Captain  Morstan, the sending of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter,--we  had had light upon all those events.  They had only led us, however, to  a deeper and far more tragic mystery.  The Indian treasure, the curious  plan found among Morstan's baggage, the strange scene at Major Sholto's  death, the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the  murder of the discoverer, the very singular accompaniments to the  crime, the footsteps, the remarkable weapons, the words upon the card,  corresponding with those upon Captain Morstan's chart,--here was indeed  a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my  fellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue.    Pinchin Lane was a row of shabby two-storied brick houses in the lower  quarter of Lambeth.  I had to knock for some time at No. 3 before I  could make my impression.  At last, however, there was the glint of a  candle behind the blind, and a face looked out at the upper window.    \"Go on, you drunken vagabone,\" said the face.  \"If you kick up any more  row I'll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs upon you.\"    \"If you'll let one out it's just what I have come for,\" said I.    \"Go on!\" yelled the voice.  \"So help me gracious, I have a wiper in the  bag, an' I'll drop it on your 'ead if you don't hook it.\"    \"But I want a dog,\" I cried.    \"I won't be argued with!\" shouted Mr. Sherman.  \"Now stand clear, for  when I say 'three,' down goes the wiper.\"    \"Mr. Sherlock Holmes--\" I began, but the words had a most magical  effect, for the window instantly slammed down, and within a minute the  door was unbarred and open.  Mr. Sherman was a lanky, lean old man,  with stooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and blue-tinted glasses.    \"A friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome,\" said he.  \"Step in, sir.  Keep clear of the badger; for he bites.  Ah, naughty, naughty, would  you take a nip at the gentleman?\"  This to a stoat which thrust its  wicked head and red eyes between the bars of its cage.  \"Don't mind  that, sir:  it's only a slow-worm.  It hain't got no fangs, so I gives  it the run o' the room, for it keeps the beetles down.  You must not  mind my bein' just a little short wi' you at first, for I'm guyed at by  the children, and there's many a one just comes down this lane to knock  me up.  What was it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted, sir?\"    \"He wanted a dog of yours.\"    \"Ah! that would be Toby.\"    \"Yes, Toby was the name.\"    \"Toby lives at No. 7 on the left here.\"  He moved slowly forward with  his candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round  him.  In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly that there were  glancing, glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and  corner.  Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls,  who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices  disturbed their slumbers.    Toby proved to be an ugly, long-haired, lop-eared creature, half spaniel  and half lurcher, brown-and-white in color, with a very clumsy waddling  gait.  It accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugar which the old  naturalist handed to me, and, having thus sealed an alliance, it  followed me to the cab, and made no difficulties about accompanying me.  It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself back  once more at Pondicherry Lodge.  The ex-prize-fighter McMurdo had, I  found, been arrested as an accessory, and both he and Mr. Sholto had  been marched off to the station.  Two constables guarded the narrow  gate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the  detective's name.    Holmes was standing on the door-step, with his hands in his pockets,  smoking his pipe.    \"Ah, you have him there!\" said he.  \"Good dog, then!  Atheney Jones has  gone.  We have had an immense display of energy since you left.  He has  arrested not only friend Thaddeus, but the gatekeeper, the housekeeper,  and the Indian servant.  We have the place to ourselves, but for a  sergeant up-stairs.  Leave the dog here, and come up.\"    We tied Toby to the hall table, and reascended the stairs.  The room  was as he had left it, save that a sheet had been draped over the  central figure.  A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner.    \"Lend me your bull's-eye, sergeant,\" said my companion.  \"Now tie this  bit of card round my neck, so as to hang it in front of me. Thank you.  Now I must kick off my boots and stockings.--Just you carry them down  with you, Watson.  I am going to do a little climbing.  And dip my  handkerchief into the creasote.  That will do.  Now come up into the  garret with me for a moment.\"    We clambered up through the hole.  Holmes turned his light once more  upon the footsteps in the dust.    \"I wish you particularly to notice these footmarks,\" he said. \"Do you  observe anything noteworthy about them?\"    \"They belong,\" I said, \"to a child or a small woman.\"    \"Apart from their size, though.  Is there nothing else?\"    \"They appear to be much as other footmarks.\"    \"Not at all.  Look here!  This is the print of a right foot in the  dust.  Now I make one with my naked foot beside it.  What is the chief  difference?\"    \"Your toes are all cramped together.  The other print has each toe  distinctly divided.\"    \"Quite so.  That is the point.  Bear that in mind.  Now, would you  kindly step over to that flap-window and smell the edge of the  wood-work?  I shall stay here, as I have this handkerchief in my hand.\"    I did as he directed, and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry  smell.    \"That is where he put his foot in getting out.  If YOU can trace him, I  should think that Toby will have no difficulty.  Now run down-stairs,  loose the dog, and look out for Blondin.\"    By the time that I got out into the grounds Sherlock Holmes was on the  roof, and I could see him like an enormous glow-worm crawling very  slowly along the ridge.  I lost sight of him behind a stack of  chimneys, but he presently reappeared, and"]]]
