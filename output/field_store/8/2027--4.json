But the letters of Queen  Adelaide are always written in a strain of touching devotion and  affection, and reveal her as a woman of large heart and great  simplicity of character.      [Pageheading: KING LEOPOLD]    But the most interesting series of letters are the Queen's own  correspondence with King Leopold, of which several hundred are  preserved. The letters, too, received by her from the King of the  Belgians are preserved in their entirety.    The letters which the Queen wrote to King Leopold are of extraordinary  interest; she kept up an unbroken correspondence with him, and spoke  freely of all that was in her mind. Two points are worthy of special  mention: though she was early convinced of the necessity of holding an  independent constitutional position in politics she mentions the Tory  party with undisguised mistrust; and further, the name of King William  hardly ever occurs until his last illness.    King Leopold's early letters reveal his character in the most amiable  light. He familiarised the Queen with all the complicated details of  foreign politics; he gave her the most sensible and wise advice; he  warned and encouraged her; he answered her enquiries with the minutest  care: and the warm affection to which he gave frequent expression is a  very sacred and beautiful thing to contemplate.    We have selected several of the Princess Victoria's letters to the  King of the Belgians before her accession, because they throw a  remarkable light upon her temperament. In the first place, they reveal  the deep affectionateness of her character, and, what is still more  remarkable at her age, her frankness and outspokenness in expressing  her feelings.    In the second place, they show with what interest and eagerness the  Princess was following the course of foreign politics. Her view was  naturally a personal one, but it may be said that there can have been  very few, if any, girls in England, of the Princess's age, who were  taking any interest at all in Continental affairs. It is true that  King Leopold had early impressed upon the Princess that it was a  duty to become acquainted with the course of current events; but the  letters show that the interest she felt was congenial and innate, and  did not spring from a sense of duty. The allusions to home politics  are not so frequent, but still show that here also her attention was  alert.    Thirdly, they reveal her abounding vitality, her love of life and  amusement, her devotion to music, and the simple unspoilt zest with  which she threw herself into all that surrounded her.    There is a special interest which attaches to the correspondence  between Queen Victoria and King Leopold after the Accession. The  letters reveal, as no other documents could do, the monarchical point  of view. However intimate may be the relations between a Sovereign  and a subject, there is bound to appear a certain discretion, and  even condescension, on the one hand, and on the other a due degree of  deference. But here we have the remarkable spectacle of two monarchs,  both of eminent sagacity, and both, so to speak, frankly interested in  the task of constitutional government, corresponding freely on all the  difficulties and problems inseparable from their momentous task,  and with an immense sense of their weighty responsibilities. It is  impossible to exaggerate the deep and abiding interest of such a  correspondence; and the seriousness, the devotion, the public spirit  that are displayed, without affectation or calculated impressiveness,  make the whole series of letters singularly memorable.    The King of the Belgians had married Princess Louise of Orleans,  daughter of Louis Philippe, in 1832. She was only seven years older  than the Princess Victoria, who grew to regard her with the tenderest  affection.    The letters from Queen Louise are very numerous. A few are in French,  but they are mostly written in brisk, lively English, not always very  correct, either in construction or in spelling. They are full of small  family details--the movements of various relations, the improvement in  her brothers' looks, Court festivities, the childish ailments of her  little boys, the journeys and expeditions, recollections of Windsor,  their visitors, elaborate descriptions of dresses--interesting to  read, but difficult to select from. They are full of heart-felt  expressions of the sincerest affection for \"your dear Majesty,\" a  quaint phrase that often occurs.      [Pageheading: PRINCE ALBERT]    After their marriage in 1840, Prince Albert naturally became the  Queen's confidential Secretary.    A close study of the Queen's correspondence reveals the character of  the Prince in a way which nothing else could effect. Traces of  his untiring labour, his conscientious vigilance, his singular  devotedness, appear on every page. There are innumerable memoranda in  his own hand; the papers are throughout arranged and annotated by him;  nothing seems to have escaped him, nothing to have dismayed him. As  an instance of the minute laboriousness which characterised the Royal  household, it may be mentioned that there are many copies of important  letters, forwarded to the Prince for his perusal, the originals of  which had to be returned, written not only by the Prince himself, but  by the Queen under his direction. But besides keeping a vigilant eye  upon politics, the Prince took the lead in all social and educational  movements of the time, as well as devoting a close and continuous  attention to the affairs of Europe in general, and Germany in  particular. It is obvious from the papers that the Prince can hardly  ever have taken a holiday; many hours of every day must have been  devoted by him to work; yet he was at the same time a tender husband  and father, always ready with advice and sympathy, and devoted to  quiet domestic life.    After the Queen's marriage the correspondence becomes far more  voluminous. It is difficult to exaggerate the amount of conscientious  labour bestowed by the Queen and the Prince Consort on all matters  which concerned the welfare of the nation. The number of documents  which passed through their hands, and which were carefully studied by  them, was prodigious.    The drafts of the Queen's replies to letters are in many cases in the  handwriting of the Prince Consort, but dated by herself, and often  containing interlinear corrections and additions of her own. Whether  the Queen indicated the lines of the replies, whether she dictated the  substance of them, or whether they contain the result of a discussion  on the particular matter, cannot be precisely ascertained. But  they contain so many phrases and turns of expression which are  characteristic of her outspoken temperament, that it is clear that  she not only followed every detail, but that the substance of  the communication bore in most cases the impress of her mind. A  considerable number of the drafts again are in her own hand, with  interlinear corrections and additions by the Prince; and these so  strongly resemble in style the drafts in the handwriting of the  Prince, that it is clear that the Queen did not merely accept  suggestions, but that she had a strong opinion of her own on important  matters, and that this opinion was duly expressed.    One fact must, however, be borne in mind. It happens in many cases  that a correspondence on some particular point seems to be about to  lead up to a definite conclusion, but that the salient and decisive  document is absent. In these cases it is clear that the matter was  settled at a personal interview; in many cases the Prince prepared  a memorandum of an important interview; but there are a considerable  number of such correspondences, where no record is preserved of the  eventual solution, and this incompleteness is regrettable, but, by the  nature of the case, inevitable.      [Pageheading: LEADING STATESMEN IN 1837]    The young Queen, on coming to the Throne, had little technical  knowledge of the details of diplomacy, but she already had a real and  intelligent acquaintance with foreign affairs, though it was rather  personal than political, and, as we have seen, was more inspired by  her interest in the fortunes and position of her numerous maternal  relations than by the political views of her paternal relatives. Among  the English statesmen of the day there were few who were qualified  to help and instruct her. The two men who for over twenty years  alternately guided the foreign policy of the country were Lord  Aberdeen and Lord Palmerston. They represented two opposed schools.  Lord Aberdeen, a Peelite, was naturally and by tradition inclined to  desire harmonious relations with all foreign Powers, and to abstain,  as far as was consistent with maintaining British interests, from any  sort of intervention in European affairs; Palmerston was a disciple of  Canning, who had definitely broken with the principles of the Congress  of Vienna, and openly avowed his approval of a policy of intervention,  to any extent short of actual war, in the interests of liberty and  good government. The only other man who had any title to speak with  authority on foreign affairs was the Duke of Wellington, who had held  the seals as Foreign Secretary for a few months in 1834 and 1835. He  had, however, lost much of the reputation for political sagacity which  he had held at the time when he was the arbiter of Europe and virtual  ruler of France. Moreover, being, as he was, a much occupied man, with  varied business to transact, and at the mercy of his almost excessive  conscientiousness, he held himself to a considerable extent aloof  from current politics, though he never lost his absorbing interest in  Continental affairs.          CHAPTER IV    1821-1835      [The first letter ever received by Queen Victoria appears to be the  following little note, written by the Duchess of Clarence, afterwards  Queen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20031"],[0,"A Final Reckoning: A Tale of Bush Life in Australia (#10)"],[1," was a strong one, had been cut with a saw round the lock. The  butler testified to the plate having been safe, the night before,  and the strong chest in which it was kept having been forced open.    Directly it was discovered, the constable of the village was placed  in charge of the room, with orders to admit no one; and a man on  horseback was sent off to Lewes, to the chief constable. The  village constable gave evidence as to the state of the place, when  he was put in charge.    The constable who had been sent over from Lewes then stepped into  the witness box. He testified to the marks of entry of the thieves,  and said that the manner in which they had gone to work, and in  which the door had been sawn through, and the chest forced open,  seemed to show that it was the work of practised hands. On  examining closely the butler's pantry, he found a powerful  screwdriver and a heavy chisel. These corresponded to marks in the  lid, and had evidently been used for the purpose of forcing it  open. They had the initials \"R W.\" burnt in the handles. The  inmates of the house all denied any knowledge of these tools.    Mr. Ellison had been present when he showed them to Mrs. Ellison.  On looking at them she said at once:    \"R. W. Why, that must be Reuben Whitney, that wicked boy, again.\"    Upon making inquiries, he found that the man named worked at Mr.  Penfold's, the mill wright at Lewes. He returned there at once and,  going to Mr. Penfold, found the prisoner was absent from work. The  men identified the brand on the tools as that of the prisoner.  Another constable proved the arrest.    The chief constable then read the statement that the prisoner had  made to him. The magistrates conferred together for a few minutes,  in an undertone.    \"Mrs. Ellison,\" the senior of them said, addressing that lady, who  was sitting on a chair placed at the upper end of the court, \"we  are sorry to trouble you, but we must ask you to go into the  witness box.    \"I wish to ask you,\" he went on, when she had taken her stand in  the box, \"how it was you at once connected the initials with the  prisoner?\"    \"Because he had at one time lived in the village, and was employed  assisting our gardener. He was discharged on suspicion of having  poisoned a watchdog which had bit him; and as the three dogs about  the place had all been poisoned, on the night when the house was  broken into, his name had been in my mind and, on seeing the  initials, I naturally recognized them at once.\"    There was a deep silence in the court, when Mrs. Ellison gave her  evidence. Hitherto the impression had been rather favourable to the  prisoner. His story, though strange, had been by no means  impossible and, if true, would have completely accounted for the  finding of the tools, which were the only evidence against him. The  evidence of Mrs. Ellison, however, entirely altered the complexion  of the case.    Reuben had stood, quiet and composed, during the hearing. His  countenance had evinced no surprise or emotion, when the tools were  produced. He had, indeed, upon thinking the matter over before  coming into court, come to the conclusion that the tools, which he  had in a small basket at the time he was attacked, had been found  in or near the house; having been left there purposely, by Tom  Thorne, in order to throw suspicion upon him. Their production,  therefore, was no surprise to him.    A slight shade had passed over his face when Mrs. Ellison entered  the witness box. Glancing at the squire as she gave her evidence,  Reuben saw that Mr. Ellison looked greatly vexed and annoyed. As  before, at the conclusion of the evidence of each witness, Reuben  was asked if he had any question to put. He hesitated for a moment  and then, as before, replied in the negative.    Again the magistrates consulted together.    \"Mr. Ellison, we shall be obliged if you will enter the witness box  again. In your former evidence, Mr. Ellison, you said nothing in  any way relating to the prisoner; but it now seems you had a  previous acquaintance with him. Will you tell the court what it  is?\"    \"I have not much to say,\" the squire said. \"As a boy he lived in  the village with his mother, a most respectable person; and widow  of Jacob Whitney, a miller in a good way of business, who, as it  may be in your memory, was found drowned in his mill pond some  seven or eight years ago. The widow, being in reduced circumstances,  settled in Tipping. The boy was an intelligent lad and, when the boy  employed in my garden left, I gave him the place.  He gave every  satisfaction. One day he was severely bitten by the watchdog and,  three days later, the dog was found poisoned. My gardener saw a boy  running away from the spot, a quarter of an hour before the dog died.  He believed it to be the prisoner, but it was too dark for him to  distinguish the features.    \"At the time, I certainly suspected that he had been guilty of  poisoning the dog and, in spite of his denying that he had anything  to do with it, as he was unable to account for where he was at the  time the boy was seen, I discharged him. I wish to say publicly  that I have deeply regretted having done so, ever since, and that I  consider I acted hastily and wrongly in so doing. Considering his  previous good character, I ought not to have assumed his guilt  without more positive evidence than I had before me. I may also say  that the schoolmaster of our village will give the prisoner the  highest character for truthfulness, and he has known him ever  since. His present employer, Mr. Penfold, is also, I believe, ready  to testify to his excellent conduct during his four years of  apprenticeship.\"    \"I suppose, Mr. Ellison,\" the senior magistrate said, \"you have  not, at any time since the poisoning of the dog, obtained any  actual evidence which would show that you were mistaken in your  first view, and that your subsequent change of opinion was due  solely to your general view of the boy's character, so far as you  knew it.\"    \"That is so,\" the squire assented and, no further question being  asked, he resumed his seat. His evidence had caused surprise and  some little amusement in court. It was clear that there was a  strong difference of opinion between him and his wife on the  subject; and that, while the lady had something like an animus  against the prisoner, the squire was strongly impressed in his  favour. After some consultation, the magistrate said:    \"The case will be remanded until this day week, to see if further  evidence is forthcoming; but I may say that, under the present  circumstances of the case, we shall feel ourselves obliged to send  it for trial. The prisoner's account of his proceedings, from the  time he left Lewes on the previous evening up to that of his return  and arrest here, may be true; but so far it is entirely  unsupported. On the other hand, we have the evidence of the tools,  admitted to belong to him, being found on the scene of the  burglary. We have the further important fact that he had been  formerly employed upon the place; and had, it may be supposed, some  knowledge of the premises. He had been discharged upon a suspicion,  rightfully or wrongly entertained, of his having poisoned a dog  belonging to Mr. Ellison, and there is reason for the belief that  the dogs poisoned before the burglary were got at by some one  acquainted with the place.\"    \"Will it be any use my calling evidence as to character, at the  next meeting?\" Reuben asked.    \"No,\" the magistrate said. \"Evidence of that kind will be useful at  the trial, when the matter will be thoroughly sifted. We only have  to decide that there is prima facie evidence connecting you with  the offence, and of that there can be no doubt.\"    At the sitting a week later, no fresh evidence was produced; and  Reuben was committed for trial at the next assizes. Public opinion  in Lewes ran high on the subject of Reuben's guilt or innocence.  The other workmen at the mill wright's were strongly in his  favour--he was very popular among his fellows--and they pointed out  that several hands must have been concerned in the business, that  he was never seen about in public houses of an evening, or was  likely to have any connection with bad characters. Was it probable,  if he had gone about such a job as that, he would have taken tools  marked with his own initials; or if he had, that he would have been  fool enough to leave them behind?    Upon the other hand, opinion in general ran strongly against him.  His story was declared to be utterly improbable, and a fellow who  had once been dismissed for poisoning a dog would be likely, at any  future time, to revenge himself upon the employer who turned him  off. As to Mr. Ellison's declaration of his subsequent opinion that  he acted hastily, little weight was attached to it. Everyone knew  Squire Ellison was a kind-hearted man, and as he acknowledged  himself that he had obtained no evidence which would satisfy him  that he had acted wrongly in the first case, it was clear that it  was from mere kindness of heart that he had changed his mind on the  subject.    At Tipping the subject was never mentioned. The squire and Mrs.  Ellison had, on the drive home, had the most serious quarrel which  had ever taken place during their wedded life; which had ended by  the former saying:    \"If anyone had ever told me before, Mary, that you were a  vindictive woman, I should have knocked him down. I might do so  now, but I should know in my heart that he had spoken truly. For  some reason or other you took a prejudice against that boy, and you  never forgave his mother for standing up in his defence. I was  shocked, downright shocked, when you gave your evidence in court.\"    Mrs. Ellison had been too much offended to reply, and the rest of  the drive had been passed in silence. Upon their return home the  girls were full of eager questions, but the squire said shortly:    \"My"]]]
