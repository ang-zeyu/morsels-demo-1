The greatest part of it had been built in the year Queen Mary married  Darnley (1565), but part of the building was very much older; a  subterranean passage especially, of considerable length, well arched,  too narrow for a sally-port, unaccountable therefore by any other  theory, Dr Burton always believed as old as the Romans. Craighouse had  been besieged by Queen Mary's son in person, and had stood the siege and  resisted the king.[11] The then laird of Craighouse, whose name was  Kincaid, ran away with a widow, who was a royal ward, and married her in  spite of the king; whether with or without the lady's own consent no  record condescends to specify. The laird was afterwards nearly ruined  by a fine, of which a part consisted of a favourite _nag_, which it  would appear King Jamie had been personally acquainted with and coveted.    [Footnote 11: See Pitcairn's Criminal Trials.]    The distance of Craighouse from the town was not great--nothing as a  walk to such walkers as Dr Burton and all his family; but it was enough  to interfere seriously with evening engagements. Once home from  business, it was an effort to return again to the town to dine or attend  any sort of social gathering. The thing was not impossible, but its  difficulty served as too good an excuse for Dr Burton's increasing  unsociability. For a time, while some of the old circle still survived,  Dr Burton saw them with pleasure at his own table, but he too early  adopted a determination--which no one should ever adopt--to make no new  friends. Almost all his old friends predeceased him, and he found  himself thrown entirely on the society of his own family.    But to return. From a romantic wish to give his wife what he imagined  she desired, Dr Burton returned from Lochgoilhead, leaving his family  there, took all the steps for obtaining a lease of Craighouse in their  absence, and on their return presented his wife, as her birthday gift,  with the keys of Craighouse--a huge bunch of antique keys, some of them  with picturesque old handles. Mrs Burton and all her family loved their  beautiful home as much as any home ever was loved. They occupied it for  seventeen years.    During the exceptionally severe winter of 1860-61, the most essential  repairs were executed on the old house, and the family moved into it in  March.    The 5th of March was long kept by them as a festival--the anniversary of  the day on which they drove out to take possession of Craighouse in a  spring snowstorm. They had resolved to get possession before the  snowdrops, with which the beautiful avenue was carpeted, should be over;  and they did--but the snowdrops were buried in snow.    [Illustration: _Craighouse._]          CHAPTER V.    THIRD STAGE OF LITERARY LIFE.    _Craighouse--Birth and marriages--Office and literary work--\"Perth  days\"--Captain Speke--Library--Athenaeum--Historiographership--Unsociability  and Hospitality--St Albans--Strasburg--London--Stories, jokes, and  nonsense-verses._      At Craighouse a second son was born to Dr Burton; his seventh and  youngest child. There also his eldest and his third daughters married;  the younger, Matilda Lauder, in June 1877, becoming the wife of William  Lennox Cleland, of Adelaide, South Australia; the elder, Isabella  Jessie, that of James Rodger, M.D., of Aberdeen, in April 1878.    The whole of the period at Craighouse was one of active literary as well  as official life. Dr Burton walked daily to the Office of Prisons, no  longer to perform the duty of secretary, but that of manager, at the  same salary he had enjoyed as secretary. The transference of the  principal part of the duty to London altered his position but slightly.  Both before and after this change a monthly visit to the General Prison  at Perth was part of his duty. His wife occasionally accompanied him in  these excursions, and by experience can judge of the fatigue, or rather  the exertion without fatigue, which he underwent in them. At home Dr  Burton was never an early riser, but in travelling he willingly  performed a first stage before breakfast.    On his \"Perth days,\" in going from Craighouse he was obliged to be astir  by four in the morning. His wife usually drove him to the railway  station in time to catch a train starting at six. Sometimes he would  consent to be met again on the arrival of the latest return train at  night and driven home; generally he preferred walking home, after a call  at his office, to see if anything there required his attention. He thus  arrived at Perth by breakfast-time; spent the whole day in passing from  cell to cell of the many hundred prisoners there confined, interrogating  each of them, and taking notes of anything requiring notice; and reached  home not till nearly midnight, yet never appearing at all fatigued.  Latterly he gave up this great effort and did not return till the  following day, sleeping in a hotel at Perth on the occasions of his  official visits.    In 1867 he published the first four volumes of his 'History of Scotland,  from Agricola's Invasion to the Revolution of 1688,' and in 1870 other  three volumes, completing the work, and, together with the portion  published in 1853, forming a complete narrative of Scotch history from  the earliest times down to the suppression of the Jacobite insurrection  of '45.    As offshoots from his great work, he published, first in 'Blackwood's  Magazine,' and then, with some additions, in volume shape, two pleasant  books--the 'Book-Hunter' and the 'Scot Abroad,'--besides many other  slighter works. During these years he was often obliged to refuse his  pen for fugitive writing, from unwillingness to interrupt his more  serious tasks.    The following is a note declining, very characteristically, an  application of the kind from his valued friend, Mr Russel, editor of the  'Scotsman':--         \"_11th August 1862._         \"MY DEAR RUSSEL,--What am I expected to do with the Cat Stane? Not       to review it, I hope. I have had a sniff of it already in the       proceedings of the Antiquarian Society. It is a brilliant specimen       of the pedantic pottering of the learned body which enables me to       append to my name the A.S.S., fraudulently inverted into S.S.A.       Such twaddle always excites me into feverishness. I haven't nerve       for it.         \"I see the grandfather of Hengist and Horsa is made out very       clearly, but there seem insuperable difficulties in proving Hengist       and Horsa themselves. This strikes me as a characteristic of the       author's[12] profession. He has to deal with parents actual and       possible, but the offspring are seen evanescently, often loom in       the distance, and sometimes can't be got to exist even when most       desired.--Yours truly, J.H. BURTON.\"         [Footnote 12: The late Professor Simpson.]    Dr Simpson's really universal genius led him pretty deeply into  archaeology, in which he sometimes, as on the present occasion, showed  more zeal than knowledge.    One of the first summers at Craighouse was enlivened by a long visit  from the African traveller, Captain Speke. Dr Burton met with him in the  hospitable house of his friendly publisher, the late John Blackwood, at  Strathtyrum. Captain Speke was then preparing, or endeavouring to  prepare, for the press, his book, the 'Discovery of the Source of the  Nile.' The truly gallant Captain being more practised in exploring than  in writing, Mr Blackwood suggested his going home with Dr Burton, that  he might have the benefit of his advice in the formation of his  materials into a book. The family at Craighouse became warmly attached  to their guest. He endeared himself by his simple unassuming character,  and a peculiar sweetness of temper. The sorrow at Craighouse was great  on hearing, during the following autumn, of his most lamentable death.  He who had escaped so many dangers--was so well accustomed to  firearms--accidentally shot by his own gun while partridge-shooting near  his paternal home!    While at Craighouse, Dr Burton's library gradually increased from being  an ordinary room full of books, to a collection numbering about 10,000  volumes. From his earliest years Dr Burton had been a collector of  books, and Craighouse led to the increase of his collection in two ways.  The distance from the town was an impediment to the use of the  Advocates' Library in his historical studies, and there was space at  Craighouse for any number of books. There were always rooms which could  be taken into occupation when wanted; and to his life's end it was a  favourite amusement of Dr Burton's to construct and erect shelves for  his books.    In an article in 'Blackwood's Magazine' for August 1879, there occurs  the following lively description of the impression made by the library  on the mind of a visitor. Before the passage quoted was published, Dr  Burton had left Craighouse for Morton House, but the description  evidently refers to Craighouse:--    \"We have had the privilege of dropping in upon him [Dr Burton clearly  being meant, though not named] in what we might call his lair, if the  word did not sound disrespectful. It was in a venerable,  half-castellated, ivy-grown manor-house, among avenues of ancient trees,  where the light had first to struggle through the foliage before it fell  on the narrow windows, in walls that were many feet in thickness. And  seldom, surely, has so rich a collection been stowed away in so strange  a suite of rooms. Rooms, indeed, are hardly the word. The central point,  where the proprietor wrote and studied, was a vaulted chamber, and all  around was a labyrinth of passages to which you mounted or descended by  a step or two; of odd nooks and sombre little corridors, and tiny  apartments squeezed aside into corners, and lighted either"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22153"],[0,"Pagan and Christian Rome (#10)"],[1," other details will be incidentally described in the  following chapters. I close the present one by referring to a graceful  custom, borrowed likewise from the classic world,--the use of roses in  church or funeral ceremonies and in social life.    The ancients celebrated, in the month of May, a feast called  _rosaria_, in which sepulchres were profusely decorated with the  favorite flower of the season. Roses were also used on occasions of  public rejoicing. A Greek inscription, discovered by Fraenkel at  Pergamon, mentions, among the honors shown to the emperor Hadrian, the  _Rhodismos_, which is interpreted as a scattering of roses. Traces of  the custom are found in more recent times. In the Illyrian peninsula,  and on the banks of the Danube, the country people, still feeling the  influence of Roman civilization, celebrated feasts of flowers in  spring and summer, under the name of _rousalia_. In the sixth century,  when the Slavs were vacillating between the influence of the past and  the present, the celebration of the Pentecost was mixed up with that  of the half-pagan, half-barbarous _rousalia_. Southern Russians  believe in supernatural female beings, called _Rusalky_, who bring  prosperity to the fields and forests, which they have inhabited as  flowers.    The early Christians decorated the sepulchres of martyrs and  confessors, on the anniversary of their interment, with roses,  violets, amaranths, and evergreens; and they celebrated the  _rosationes_ on the name-days of churches and sanctuaries. Wreaths and  crowns of roses are often engraved on tombstones, hanging from the  bills of mystic doves. The symbol refers more to the joys of the just  in the future life than to the fleeting pleasures of the earth. The  Acts of Perpetua relate a legend on this subject; that Saturus had a  vision in the dungeon in which he was awaiting his martyrdom, in which  he saw himself transported with Perpetua to a heavenly garden,  fragrant with roses, and turning to his fair companion, he exclaimed:  \"Here we are in possession of that which our Lord promised!\"    Roses and other flowers are painted on the walls of historical  cubiculi. In a fresco of the crypts of Lucina, in the Catacombs of  Callixtus, are painted birds, symbolizing souls who have been  separated from their bodies, and are playing in fields of roses around  the Tree of Life. As the word _Paradeisos_ signifies a garden, so its  mystic representation always takes the form of a delightful field of  flowers and fruit. Dante gives to the seat of the blessed the shape of  a fair rose, inside of which a crowd of angels with golden wings  descend and return to the Lord:--        \"Nel gran fior discendeva, che s'adorna      Di tante foglie: e quindi risaliva,      La dove lo suo amor sempre soggiorna.\"[33]                                    _Paradiso_, xxxi. 10-12.    Possibly it is from this allegory of paradise that the rite of the  \"golden rose\" which the Pope blesses on Quadragesima Sunday is  derived. The ceremony is very ancient, although the first mention of  it appears only in the life of Leo IX. (1049-1055); and I may mention,  as a curious coincidence, that the kings and queens of Navarre, their  sons, and the dukes and peers of the realm, were bound to offer roses  to the Parliament at the return of spring.    Roses played such an important part in church ceremonies that we find  a _fundus rosarius_ given as a present by Constantine to Pope Mark.  The _rosaria_ outlived the suppression of pagan superstitions, and by  and by assumed its Christian form in the feast of Pentecost, which  falls in the month of May. In that day roses were thrown from the  roofs of churches on the worshipers below. The Pentecost is still  called by the Italians _Pasqua rosa_.

They are surely  genuine and ancient. I examined them in company with Mommsen, Jordan,  and de Rossi, and they attributed them to the beginning of the third  century of our era. The best suggestion regarding their origin is that  they belong to a person, probably Christian, who used the name Petrus  as _gentilitium_, and Paulus as _cognomen_, and who was the son of  Lillutus, however barbaric this last name may sound.
