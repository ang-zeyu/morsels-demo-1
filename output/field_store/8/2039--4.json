They are the happiest who  have the least; and the fable of the stricken king and the shirtless  beggar contains the germ of truth. The wise hold all earthly ties very  lightly--they are stripping for eternity.    World-weariness is only a desire for a better spiritual condition. There  is more to be written on this subject of world-pain--to exhaust the  theme would require a book. And certain it is that I have no wish to  say the final word on any topic. The gentle reader has certain rights,  and among these is the privilege of summing up the case. But the fact  holds that world-pain is a form of desire. All desires are just, proper  and right; and their gratification is the means by which Nature supplies  us that which we need. Desire not only causes us to seek that which we  need, but is a form of attraction by which the good is brought to us,  just as the ameba creates a swirl in the waters that brings its food  within reach. Every desire in Nature has a fixed, definite purpose in  the Divine Economy, and every desire has its proper gratification. If we  desire the friendship of a certain person, it is because that person has  certain soul-qualities that we do not possess, and which complement our  own. Through desire do we come into possession of our own; by submitting  to its beckonings we add cubits to our stature; and we also give out to  others our own attributes, without becoming poorer, for soul is not  limited.    All Nature is a symbol of spirit, so I believe that somewhere there must  be a proper gratification for this mysterious nostalgia of the soul. The  Eternal Unities require a condition where men and women will live to  love, and not to sorrow; where the tyranny of things hated shall not  ever prevail, nor that for which the heart yearns turn to ashes at our  touch.           *       *       *       *       *    \"I believe Stevie is not quite at home here--he'll not remain so very  long,\" said a woman to me in Eighteen Hundred Ninety-five. Five years  have gone by, and recently the cable flashed the news that Stephen Crane  was dead.    Dead at twenty-nine, with ten books to his credit, two of them good,  which is two good books more than most of us scribblers will ever write.  Yes, Stephen Crane wrote two things that are immortal. \"The Red Badge of  Courage\" is the strongest, most vivid work of imagination ever fished  from an ink-pot by an American.    \"Men who write from the imagination are helpless when in presence of the  fact,\" said James Russell Lowell. In answer to which I'll point you \"The  Open Boat,\" the sternest, creepiest bit of realism ever penned, and  Stevie was in the boat.    American critics honored Stephen Crane with more ridicule, abuse and  unkind comment than was bestowed on any other writer of his time.  Possibly the vagueness, and the loose, unsleeked quality of his work  invited the gibes, jeers, and the loud laughter that tokens the vacant  mind; yet as half-apology for the critics we might say that scathing  criticism never killed good work; and this is true, but it sometimes has  killed the man.    Stephen Crane never answered back, nor made explanation, but that he was  stung by the continued efforts of the press to laugh him down, I am very  sure.    The lack of appreciation at home caused him to shake the dust of  America from his feet and take up his abode across the sea, where his  genius was being recognized, and where strong men stretched out sinewy  hands of welcome, and words of appreciation were heard, instead of  silly, insulting parody. In passing, it is well to note that the five  strongest writers of America had their passports to greatness viseed in  England before they were granted recognition at home. I refer to Walt  Whitman, Thoreau, Emerson, Poe and Stephen Crane.    Stevie did not know he cared for approbation, but his constant refusal  to read what the newspapers said about him was proof that he did. He  boycotted the tribe of Romeike, because he knew that nine clippings out  of every ten would be unkind, and his sensitive soul shrank from the  pin-pricks.    Contemporary estimates are usually wrong, and Crane is only another of  the long list of men of genius to whom Fame brings a wreath and finds  her poet dead.    Stephen Crane was a reincarnation of Frederic Chopin. Both were small in  stature, slight, fair-haired, and of that sensitive, acute, receptive  temperament--capable of highest joy and keyed for exquisite pain.  Haunted with the prophetic vision of quick-coming death, and with the  hectic desire to get their work done, they often toiled the night away  and were surprised by the rays of the rising sun. Both were shrinking  yet proud, shy but bold, with a tenderness and a feminine longing for  love that earth could not requite. At times mad gaiety, that ill-masked  a breaking heart, took the reins, and the spirits of children just out  of school seemed to hold the road. At other times--and this was the  prevailing mood--the manner was one of placid, patient, calm and smooth,  unruffled hope; but back and behind all was a dynamo of energy, a  brooding melancholy of unrest, and the crouching world-sorrow that would  not down.    Chopin reached sublimity through sweet sounds; Crane attained the same  heights through the sense of sight and words that symboled color, shapes  and scenes. In each the distinguishing feature is the intense  imagination and active sympathy. Knowledge consists in a sense of  values--of distinguishing this from that, for truth lies in the mass.  The delicate nuances of Chopin's music have never been equaled by  another composer; every note is cryptic, every sound a symbol. And yet  it is dance-music, too, but still it tells its story of baffled hope and  stifled desire--the tragedy of Poland in sweet sounds.    Stephen Crane was an artist in his ability to convey the feeling by just  the right word, or a word misplaced, like a lady's dress in disarray, or  a hat askew. This daring quality marks everything he wrote. The  recognition that language is fluid, and at best only an expedient,  flavors all his work. He makes no fetish of a grammar--if grammar gets  in the way, so much the worse for the grammar. All is packed with color,  and charged with feeling, yet the work is usually quiet in quality and  modest in manner.    Art is born of heart, not head; and so it seems to me that the work of  these men whose names I have somewhat arbitrarily linked, will live.  Each sowed in sorrow and reaped in grief. They were tender, kind,  gentle, with a capacity for love that passes the love of woman. They  were each indifferent to the proprieties, very much as children are.  They lived in cloister-like retirement, hidden from the public gaze, or  wandered unnoticed and unknown. They founded no schools, delivered no  public addresses, and in their own day made small impress on the times.  Both were sublimely indifferent to what had been said and done--the term  precedent not being found within the covers of their bright lexicon of  words. In the nature of each was a goodly trace of peroxide of iron that  often manifested itself in the man's work.    The faults in each spring from an intense personality, uncolored by the  surroundings, and such faults in such men are virtues.    They belong to that elect few who have built for the centuries. The  influence of Chopin, beyond that of other composers, is alive today, and  moves unconsciously, but profoundly, every music-maker; the seemingly  careless style of Crane is really lapidaric, and is helping to file the  fetters from every writer who has ideas plus, and thoughts that burn.    Mother Nature in giving out energy gives each man about an equal  portion. But that ability to throw the weight with the blow, to  concentrate the soul in a sonnet, to focus force in a single effort, is  the possession of God's Chosen Few. Chopin put his affection, his  patriotism, his wrath, his hope, and his heroism into his music--as if  the song of all the forest birds could be secured, sealed and saved for  us!           *       *       *       *       *    The father of Chopin was a Frenchman who went up to Poland seeking gain  and adventure. He became a soldier under Kosciusko and arose to rank of  Captain. He found such favor with the nobility by his gracious ways that  he became a teacher of French in the family of Count Frederic Skarbek.  In the family group was a fair young dependent of nervous  temperament--slight, active, gentle and intelligent. She was descendent  from a line of aristocrats, but in a country where revolutions have been  known to begin and end before breakfast, titles stand for little.    Nicholas Chopin, ex-soldier, teacher of French and Deportment, married  this fine young girl, and they lived in one of Count Skarbek's  straw-thatched cottages at the little village of Zelazowa-Wola,  twenty-nine miles from Warsaw. Here it was that Frederic Chopin was  born, in Eighteen Hundred Nine--that memorable year when Destiny sent a  flight of great souls to the planet Earth.    The country was bleak and battle-scarred; it had been drained of its men  and treasure, and served as a dueling-ground and the place of skulls for  kings and such riffraff who have polluted this fair world with their  boastings of a divine power.    The struggle of Poland to free herself from the grip of the imperial  succubi has generated an atmosphere of ultramarine, so we view the  little land of patriots (and fanatics) through a mist of melancholy.  The history of Poland is written in blood and tears.    Go ask John Sobieski, who saw his father hanged by order of Ferdinand  Maximilian, and child though he was, realized that banishment was the  fate of himself and mother; and then ten years after, himself, stood  death-guard over this same Maximilian in Mexico, and told that tyrant  the story of his life, and shook hands with him, calling it quits, ere"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20346"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Winchester (#10)"],[1,"on the  reredos--\"the Saviour's coat, with the Cross, crown of thorns, nails,  hammer, pillar, scourges, reed, sponge, lance, sword with the ear of  Malchus upon it, lanthorn, ladder, cock, dice, etc.\" Under the tower the  vaulting is of wood, dating from 1634. Before this year the  choir-lantern was visible from below, with its striking late Norman  stonework divided into two tiers. It has been proposed to re-open the  lantern, but this would necessitate the removal of the bells from the  tower, a matter of considerable expense. It would also be a pity to take  down the vaulting with its various devices, including the arms, etc., of  Charles I., his queen, and the Prince of Wales, a medallion of the two  former, the Scotch and Irish arms, and those of Archbishop Laud, Bishop  Curie, and Dean Young. The central emblem is that of the Trinity, with a  \"chronogram\" indicating the year 1634 thus:--sInt DoMUs hUjUs pII reges  nUtrItII regInae nUtrICes pIae. The larger letters, picked out in red,  serve as Roman figures which added together make up the required number.    [Illustration: THE CHOIR STALLS. _Photochrom Co. Ltd., Photo._]    From the commencement of the choir to the high altar are eleven steps,  making nineteen in all from the level of the nave. This elevation, of  course, much enhances the imposing effect of the altar and reredos as  seen from the lower plane. It is due to the existence of the Norman  crypt beneath, and can be paralleled both at Canterbury and at  Rochester. The raised platform includes the presbytery with its aisles  and the retro-choir, and extends under the central tower to the second  pillar beyond. The nave and transepts are thus on a lower level. Before  the altar are rails which date from the reign of Charles I., while the  Altar Books were presented to the cathedral by Charles II.    The great #Reredos#, which separates the presbytery from the feretory  and the eastern end of the church, is, to judge from its style, late  fifteenth-century work. It has been attributed to Cardinal Beaufort, and  to Bishop Fox and Prior Silkstede, but no inscription or armorial  details can be discovered to confirm either of these suppositions. It is  similar in character to the altar-screens of Christchurch Priory, Hants,  and S. Mary Overy (S. Saviour's, Southwark); but, less fortunate than  the former, it was despoiled of all the statues which once filled its  niches, while it has not \"the exquisite grace of detail which marks the  choir of angels at Southwark.\" The reredos at S. Albans, in the same  style, though not so large, was erected between 1476 and 1484; and, as  at Winchester before 1899, shows a cross-shaped space where, according  to legend, a huge silver crucifix was placed. Now once more, as in the  sixteenth century, there is a figure on the great cross. It is curious  to note an attempt, during the rage for pseudo-classic architecture in  the last century, to beautify the reredos by placing sham funeral urns  in its niches. These were fortunately removed in 1820, and in recent  years they have been replaced by a series of statues intended to  reproduce as far as possible the original effect. In the _Builder_ for  October 10, 1892, a large reproduction was given of a very interesting  drawing by the late Mr J.W. Sedding, showing the whole screen completely  restored; but this scheme was unfortunately not used. A large  oil-painting, \"The Raising of Lazarus,\" by Benjamin West, purchased in  1782 by Dean Ogle, till 1899 hung immediately over the altar. Before  1818 a huge wooden canopy in Jacobean style, freely enriched with gold,  covered all the central portion of the screen. This was due to Bishop  Curie.    The reredos is so large that it occupies the whole of the space between  the choir piers, and, being constructed of a very white stone, is the  prominent feature of the choir. The work is very elaborate, the whole  screen being arranged in three tiers with canopied niches containing  eighteen large statues, while smaller figures--kings, saints, angels,  etc.--occupy the splays between. The pinnacles are pierced and  crocketted, and there is a central projecting canopy over the place of  the original crucifix. On either side of the high altar is a door  leading to the feretory at the back of the reredos, and these have in  their four spandrels interesting groups of fifteenth-century sculpture,  representing various scenes in the life of the Virgin, the Annunciation,  and the Visitation of S. Elizabeth, still showing traces of colour. The  fact that these carvings have escaped destruction, just as the lower  tier at Christchurch escaped, is only to be explained on the assumption  that they were hidden behind some panelling since removed, for of all  images which provoked iconoclastic fury those representing the Virgin  were the most certain to be attacked. The whole is crowned by a triple  frieze of leaves, Tudor roses, and quatrefoils, at a height little short  of the corbels which support the arches of the roof.    [Illustration: THE ALTAR AND REREDOS. _H.W. Salmon, Photo._]    The eighteen larger statues were, and are now, since the restoration of  the reredos, arranged in the following order. In the uppermost tier, to  the left and right of the head of cross, were S. Peter and S. Paul, who  were the patron saints of the church. Two on either side of these were  the four Latin Doctors, SS. Augustine, Gregory, Jerome, and Ambrose.  \"Below these, on the middle tier, we had two great local bishops, S.  Birinus, first occupant of the see, standing beside the figure of the  Virgin, and on the other side S. Swithun, the benevolent bishop,  patron-saint of the church: beyond them, over the two doors, were SS.  Benedict and Giles,[3] the one founder of the Order to which the Priory  belonged, the other the Hermit Saint, who always pitched his tabernacle  just outside the walls of medieval cities; he is here set in honour to  commemorate S. Giles' Hill, and especially S. Giles' Fair, from which  the Convent reaped great benefit\" (Dean Kitchin: \"Great Screen of  Winchester Cathedral\"). Outermost on this tier stand the statues of the  two deacons, SS. Stephen and Lawrence. In the lowest tier, on either  side of the altar, stand SS. Hedda and Ethelwolf, two of the most famous  Anglo-Saxon bishops of the see of Winchester. Next these saints there is  the doorway on either side and beyond these doors are statues of King  Edward the Confessor, and S. Edmund the King. Between the figures of SS.  Swithun and Birinus, stand statues of the Virgin and S. John, while  above the arms of the Cross are the four Archangels, Uriel, Gabriel,  Michael, and Raphael. In all there are now fifty-six statues on the  screen, the smaller figures including famous kings, bishops, women, and  a representation of Izaak Walton.       [3] The charter of William Rufus which gave permission for S.         Giles' Fair still exists, and may be found, with a commentary by         Dean Kitchin, in the \"Winchester Cathedral Records.\" The Fair was         granted for three days (August 31, September 1 and 2) on the         \"eastern hill,\" known as S. Giles' Hill. The object of the Fair         \"was evidently,\" says Dean Kitchin, \"to help the Bishop in         completing his great Norman Church.... Parts of the proceeds of         the Fair were at a later time assigned to Hyde Abbey, to S.         Swithun's Priory, and to the Hospital of S. Mary Magdalen.\"    Above the altar it is said that there was once \"a table of images of  silver and gilt garnished with stones.\" These images are conjectured to  have represented Christ and his disciples, possibly at the Last Supper;  but no traces remain of them. From 1782 till 1899 West's picture, \"The  Raising of Lazarus,\" now in the South Transept, hung here. The place is  now more happily occupied by a representation of the Incarnation.    [Illustration: THE NORTH TRANSEPT. From Britton's \"Winchester.\"]    The most recent feature of the screen is the great central figure of  Christ Crucified, the gift of Canon Valpy and the work of Messrs Farmer  and Brindley. The final restoration of the screen by the filling of the  space left vacant for three centuries was commemorated by a solemn  dedication service, held at the Cathedral on March 24, 1899.    On the reredos as a whole, one authority has said that \"no description  could do justice to the beauty and effect of the whole work.\" But  another has declared that \"a huge screen of this uncompromising  squareness of outline is a flagrantly artless device which in previous  periods (to the latter half of the fifteenth century) would have been  impossible.\" Milner again describes its \"exquisite workmanship\" as being  \"as magnificent as this or any other nation can exhibit.\" Doctors most  certainly differ here.    It will perhaps be most convenient to deal at this point with the  #Transepts#, of which the western walls are almost level with the  choir-screen. Having been but little injured by the fall of the tower in  1107, they still remain to a great extent what they were when originally  built by Walkelin. We therefore get the massive and rugged early Norman  walls still divided into the three nearly equal storeys which in the  nave have given place to two. Where the fall of the central tower  necessitated a partial rebuilding, the difference between the Early and  the Late masonry is very evident. That of the transepts generally is  coarse and very thick, as is the case with all Early Norman stonework.  The new masonry, on the other hand, recalls what William of Malmesbury  says of the Later Norman masonry at Salisbury, when he speaks of \"the  courses of stone so correctly laid that the joint deceives the eye, and  leads it to imagine that the whole wall is composed of a single block.\"  The juncture of the two works at Winchester can be easily traced. Of the  general style of the transepts, Willis says: \"The architecture is of the "]]]
