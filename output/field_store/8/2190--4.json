Immediately behind the temple are the springs of Georg and Kasimir, at  which stand two charming maidens ready to fill your glasses. No  conventional and hideous hat or bonnet disfigures the neat outline of  their heads. No travesty of Berlin or Paris fashion burlesques their  sturdy figures. Theirs the traditional costume of the Thuringian  female peasant--a dark skirt, and white, short-sleeved chemisette, a  blue apron and the daintiest of white silk kerchiefs, fringed sparsely  and brocaded abundantly with red roses. Albeit their arms are red and  coarse with the combined effect of iron-water, hot sun, and exposure  to the air, their faces make ample amends in their innocent,  good-tempered comeliness. They greet you with a kindly \"Guten Tag\" or  \"Guten Abend,\" and, in the case of a lady, seldom omit the pretty  \"Gnaedige Frau,\" for which our \"Ma'am\" is but a poor correlative.    Wandering through the streets of Liebenstein, one is struck by the  intensely picturesque sights of its older and original part. The  little houses are timber-framed and whitewashed, with deep projecting  eaves and often many gables. Their windows are made gay outside by  boxes filled with geraniums, nasturtiums, and fuchsias. Beneath the  windows lie small gardens, in which bloom roses and single dahlias,  while scarlet runners send their tendrils climbing over the palings  which separate road and garden. Many of the little houses have  projecting signs, on which one reads such legends as \"_Tabak,  Cigarren, Cigaretten_;\" \"Adolf Schmidt, _Herren kleidermacher_;\"  \"_Weinhandlung Naturreinheit garantirt_;\" or the very indispensable  \"_Baeckerei_.\" One house bears a tablet announcing to an admiring world  that \"_Herzoglich. Sachsen-Meiningen Stadtesbeamter_\" lives within.  Cocks and hens, dogs and children, make common playground of these  narrow streets, and one sees in them pretty well every form of animal  life represented, except horses. Now a long cart, drawn by oxen and  well filled, toils up the hill, and not long after follows one drawn  by a big dog. At a pump two tiny girls are busily employed filling  stone jars, which by the beauty and purity of their outlines might  have been Etruscan. Mothers beat mats at their cottage doors, and  shrilly scream at their children to get out of the way of the passing  carts; and the world in this remote village goes on pretty much as it  does elsewhere.    But the fashionable life of Liebenstein does not concern itself with  such mean sights and bucolic sounds as oxen-carts and crowing of  cocks. It takes its pleasure up and down the long avenues of beech  trees which lie between the Kur-Haus and the Hotel Bellevue. It  rallies round the bandstand, and makes great show of studying the  programmes of the daily concert. It chatters glibly over the previous  evening's illuminations, and describes them as \"_colossal!_\" and  \"_wunderschoen_.\" Beauty is not in vogue at Liebenstein, judging by the  middle-class Kur guests who haunt the shade of the beech trees.  Indeed, if anywhere in the world an Englishman might be forgiven for  thanking God that he is not as other men are, it would be here among  the \"_Ober-Lieutenants_\" and \"Herr Professors\" and their mates.  Figures, both male and female, seem to be of the switchback  order--faces rudimentary in their modelling, and uncompromising in  their plainness, dressing of the ugliest. Yet, _Gott sei Dank!_ Hans  thinks his Gretchen perfection, and it would never enter into innocent  Gretchen's head, as it does mine, to bestow upon Hans the carping  criticism of Portia upon Monsieur Le Bon: \"God made him, and therefore  let him pass for a man.\"                                          TREVES      The dominant glory of the Moselle region is Treves. No town or city  near has the smallest affinity with its peculiar character, and all  seem modern and prosaic compared with its well-preserved tale of  antiquity. \"Nowhere north of the Alps,\" we are told in weary  iteration, \"exist such magnificent Roman remains.\" It is generally on  the obvious that the unimaginative English parson takes upon himself  to comment. We listen submissively to much school-book lore as to  \"Claudius\" and the \"fourth century\" and the \"residence of Roman  Emperors,\" but when it rains Bishops and Archbishops and Electors we  fly before them. For, after all, what signifies the paltry learning of  a dry-as-dust dominie compared with the vivid tales these grand old  ruins tell if suffered to speak for themselves? In Treves people need  to absorb silently, and then assimilate undisturbed by weary chatter.  One looks at the tender turquoise sky, flecked with luminous clouds;  at the fine horizontal distance, with its sense of breadth and  breathing-space; at the low hills covered with vines; at the  cornfields, and orchards, and river--and we wonder what the old Romans  thought of it all, and reflect on the strangeness of life that a  people so remote from our times should have lived and loved and died,  as we live and love and die to-day. Whether Treves lie on the right or  left bank of the Moselle is immaterial except to the tiresomely  precise or to those who pin their faith to guide-books and such  shallow teachers. There is a more valuable lesson to be learnt of the  place than that of its exact situation; and no Baedeker or Murray can  help you to appreciate Treves as quiet communings with your own  intelligence will. If it so happens that you have none to commune  with, then God help you--and yours!    In Treves you have not far to go in search of the Romans. Their  _magnum opus_ confronts you boldly at the very threshold of the town.  Solid and massive and symmetrical, it stands a pregnant lesson to the  jerry-builders of to-day. There is little affinity indeed between the  building methods of the ancient Romans and those of their trade whose  sorry, pitiable record exists in the Quartiere Nuovo of Rome. About  the Porta Nigra is no trace of stucco or rubble. The huge blocks of  which it is built stand one upon the other clean-hewn and square. No  signs of mortar are left, but we see marks of iron or brass clamps.  Its colour is a warm, deep red, softened here and there by streaks of  green.    The Porta Nigra has passed through strange phases since first it  started in life as a city gate. Obviously built for purposes of  fortification, and equipped with towers of defence, its second phase  was an ecclesiastical one, and the \"spears\" were indeed turned into  \"pruning-hooks\" when the bellicose propugnaculum found itself  transformed into a church.                              \"Last scene of all,      That ends this strange, eventful history.\"    The gate was in 1876 finally cleared of priests and altars, and  allowed to revert to its original form.    Not far from the Porta Nigra stands the Cathedral, one of the oldest  in Germany, archaeologically interesting, inasmuch as it owes its  inception to the Romans. The Basilica, built by Valentinian as a court  of law, is clearly traceable in the present cathedral, and one reads a  strange tale of Romans and Franks in the sandstone and limestone and  brick of its walls. Here is treasured the famous Heilige Rock, or holy  coat worn by our Saviour when a boy. At rare intervals this garment is  exhibited to the faithful, who come from all countries to gaze  reverently upon it. Who that has seen can forget the last exposition  in 1891? Never before or since has there been anything more pathetic  than the sight of the long rows of tired, haggard, perspiring, praying  pilgrims, who stood patiently for hours in the broiling August sun,  moving only when permitted, and then at a snail's pace, towards their  Mecca. Plebeian though the majority of faces were, their devotional,  solemn, rapt expressions for the time being ennobled and beautified  them.    Treves during that time, however, was by no means the reposeful,  dignified city it is to-day. Its buildings were defaced with flags and  banners, its streets blocked with pilgrims, and the road leading from  the station to the town was lined with booths, whose owners disposed  quickly of such delicacies as Napfkuchen, Streusel-Kuchen, and  Apfelwein. Piety and profit went everywhere hand-in-hand, and a  roaring trade was done in rosaries and benitiers, the last made of the  blue pottery of the country, and stamped with a representation of Leo  XIII. against a background of Domkirche.    But to be thoroughly in harmony with Treves one must be Pagan and  Roman rather than Christian and German. Indeed, one feels in sympathy  with the Isle of Wight farmer who after he had found a Roman villa on  his farm gave up the bucolic and inglorious occupation of growing  turnips and potatoes, and could talk of nothing meaner than hypocausts  and thermae. So we, like the farmer, slight the really beautiful Early  Gothic \"Liebfrauenkirche\" and roam and muse for hours about the ruins  of the Amphitheatre, the Roman Baths, the Roman Palace and the  Basilica.

The peoples of all lands came to Joseph in Egypt to  buy grain, for everywhere the famine was severe.      THE TESTING OF JOSEPH'S BROTHERS    When Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt, he said to  his sons, \"Why do you stand looking at each other? I have heard that  there is grain for sale in Egypt; go down there and buy some for us,  that we may live and not die.\" So Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy  grain from Egypt. But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's own brother,  with his brothers, for he feared that some harm might come to him. So  the sons of Jacob went with others to buy grain, for the famine was in  the land of Canaan.    Now Joseph was the governor over Egypt; it was he who sold grain to all  the people of the land. So Joseph's brothers came and bowed before him  with their faces to the earth. When Joseph saw his brothers, he knew  them; but he acted as a stranger toward them and spoke harshly to them  and said, \"Where do you come from?\" They said, \"From the land of Canaan  to buy food.\" So Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not know him.    Joseph also remembered the dreams which he had had about them and said  to them, \"You spies! you have come to see how defenseless the land is.\"  But they said to him, \"No, my lord; your servants have come to buy  food. We are all sons of one man; we are honest men; your servants are  not spies.\" But he again said to them, \"No, you have come to see how  defenseless the land is.\" They answered, \"We, your servants, are twelve  brothers, the sons of one father in the land of Canaan. The youngest is  to-day with our father, and one is dead.\" Joseph said to them, \"It is  just as I said to you, 'You are spies.' By this you shall be tested: as  sure as Pharaoh lives you shall not go away unless your youngest brother  comes here. Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you  remain in prison, that it may be proved whether you are telling the  truth or not. Or else, as sure as Pharaoh lives, you are indeed spies.\"  So he put them all into prison for three days.    Then Joseph said to them on the third day, \"Do this and live, for I fear  God: if you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay in prison, but  you go, carry grain for the needs of your households and bring your  youngest brother to me. So you will prove that you have told the truth  and you shall not die.\"    They did as Joseph commanded, but they said to one another, \"We are  indeed guilty because of the way we treated our brother, for when we saw  his trouble and when he pleaded with us, we would not listen. That is  why this trouble has come upon us.\" Reuben added, \"Did I not say to you,  'Do not sin against the boy,' but you would not listen?\"    They did not know, however, that Joseph understood them, for he had  spoken to them through an interpreter. But he turned away from them and  wept. Then he came back and spoke to them, and taking Simeon from among  them, bound him before their eyes. Then Joseph gave orders to fill their  vessels with grain and to put every man's money back in his sack and to  give them food for the journey; and thus it was done to them. So they  loaded their asses with their grain and went away.    When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told  him all that had happened, saying, \"The man who is master in that land  spoke harshly to us and put us in prison as spies. We said to him, 'We  are honest men; we are not spies; we are twelve brothers, sons of the  same father; one is no longer living, and the youngest is to-day with  our father in the land of Canaan.' But the man who is master in that  land said to us, 'This is how I shall know that you are honest men:  leave one of your brothers with me and take the grain to supply the  needs of your households and go. Bring your youngest brother to me; then  I shall know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men; and I  will give your brother back to you and you shall be free to go about in  the land.'\"    As they were emptying their sacks, they found that each man's purse with  his money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their  purses and the money, they were afraid and they turned trembling to one  another with the question, \"What is this that God has done to us?\" Jacob  their father said to them, \"You have robbed me of my children: Joseph is  no longer living and Simeon is no longer here, and now you would take  Benjamin also! All this trouble has come to me!\" But Reuben said to his  father, \"You may put my two sons to death, if I do not bring him to you.  Put him in my charge and I will bring him back to you.\" Then Jacob said,  \"My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he only  is left. If harm should come to him on the way by which you go, then you  will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\"    The famine was severe in the land; and when Joseph's brothers had eaten  up the grain which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to  them, \"Go again, buy us a little food.\" But Judah said to him, \"The man  plainly said to us: 'You shall not see me again unless your brother is  with you.' If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy  you food, but if you will not send him, we will not go down; for the man  said to us, 'You shall not see me unless your brother is with you.'\"  Jacob said, \"Why did you bring trouble upon me by telling the man you  had another brother?\" They replied, \"The man asked all about us and our  family, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?'  So we answered his questions as he asked them. How were we to know that  he would say, 'Bring your brother down'?\"    Then Judah said to Jacob, his father, \"Send the lad with me, and we will  go at once, that both we and you and our little ones may live and not  die. I will be responsible for him; from me you may demand him. If I do  not bring him to you and set him before you, let me bear the blame  forever; for if we had not waited so long, surely we would by this time  have come back the second time.\" So their father said to them, \"If it  must be so, then do this: take some of the fruits of the land in your  jars and carry a present to the man, a little balsam, a little syrup,  spices, ladanum, pistachio nuts, and almonds. Take twice as much money  with you, carrying back the money that was put in your sacks. Perhaps it  was a mistake. Take also your brother and go again to the man. May God  Almighty grant that the man may be merciful to you and free Benjamin and  your other brother. But if I am robbed of my sons, I am bereaved  indeed!\" So the men took the present and twice as much money and  Benjamin, and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.    When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house,  \"Bring the men into the house, kill animals, and prepare the meal, for  these men will dine with me at noon.\" The steward did as Joseph ordered,  and brought the men into Joseph's house. But the men were afraid,  because they were brought into Joseph's house, and they said, \"We are  being brought in on account of the money that was put in our grain sacks  at our first visit, that he may accuse us and fall upon us and take us  as slaves, together with our asses.\"    So when they came near to Joseph's steward, they spoke to him at the  door of the house and said, \"Oh, my lord, we came down the first time  only to buy food; but when we reached home, we opened our sacks and  found that each man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in  its full weight; and we have brought it back with us. We have brought  down with us more money with which to buy food. We do not know who put  our money into our sacks.\" He replied, \"Peace be to you, fear not; your  God and the God of your father has given you the treasure in your sacks;  your money came to me.\"    Then he brought Simeon out to them. The steward also took the men to  Joseph's house and gave them water with which to wash their feet, and he  gave their asses fodder. Then they made ready the present for Joseph,  when he should come at noon, for they had heard that they were to eat  there.    When Joseph came into the house, they gave him the present which they  had brought and bowed down low before him. He asked them about their  welfare and said, \"Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke?  Is he still living?\" They replied, \"Your servant, our father, is well;  he is still alive.\" Then they bowed their heads and knelt down before  him.    When Joseph looked up and saw Benjamin his brother, his own mother's  son, he said, \"Is this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me?\"  And he added, \"God be gracious to you, my son.\" Then because of his  longing for his brother he sought a place in which to weep. So he went  into his room and wept there.    Then he bathed his face and came out and said, \"Bring on the food.\" So  they brought food for him by himself and for them by themselves and for  the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians  would not eat with the Hebrews, for to do so was hateful to them.  Joseph's brothers were seated before him, the eldest first, as was his  right as the oldest, and the youngest last, and the men looked at each  other in astonishment. Then Joseph had portions served to them from the  food before him. But Benjamin's portions were five times as much as any  of theirs. So they drank and were merry with him.    Then he gave this command to the steward of his household: \"Fill the  men's grain sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put my cup,  the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest and the money  too that he paid for his grain.\" And the steward did as Joseph  commanded.    As soon as the morning light appeared,"]]]
