The Lyons Chamber of Commerce beg you to be so kind as to accept a  private invitation at dinner which it will give to the members of  the Commission of the United States on Thursday, September 21st, 7  o'clock P. M. at Berrier and Millet, 31 Bellecour Square.  Business dress.    R.S.V.P.    We were welcomed in English by the vice-president of the Chamber of  Commerce, and discussed the following menu:      Supreme of Lobster A l'amiral    Tenderloin a la bearnaise    Artichoke Hearts    Chantilly style    Roast Truffled Bresse Chicken    Scotch Salad    Havana Ice    Desert    Wines    Fleurie (Beaujolais) in Decanter    Pouilly (Maconnais) in Decanter    White Hermitage 1904    Chateau Vaudieu 1904    Saint-Peray frappe    On my right was General d'Armade, one of the noted generals of the  French army, who had seen service all through the present war. On my  left was M. Farrand. My talk with General d'Armade was most interesting.  He said the best soldiers of both the French and the German armies were  gone; that they had been destroyed in the early part of the war and that  the soldiers now fighting were civilians who had been trained for two  years. He declared that a French soldier was always a French soldier. He  had no doubt of the ultimate victory of the Allies. In addition to  General d'Armade's experience in the present war, he had been in Morocco  and the Sudan with important commands.    On Friday, the day following, we were entertained by the directors of  the Lyons Fair. On my left was Charles Cabaud, Russian Consul General.  On my right sat Dr. Jules Courmont, who in time of peace is Professor of  the faculty of medicine and physician to the hospitals of Lyons, but who  now, in time of war, is in the War Department, has the rank of general,  and is charged with the hygiene of the army.    We found him a very competent and interesting gentleman. He accompanied  us in the private car which the railroad furnished us, and went south  with us some distance to where there is a large government garrison, and  where he had an inspection to make.    During the trip on the train Dr. Courmont told us many interesting  things about the hygiene of the army. He said that the warfare of today  is very different from the warfare of former times in respect to the  hygiene; that contrary to what was commonly supposed, the hygiene of the  trenches is excellent; that the soldiers are in better condition, most  of them, than they are in time of peace. They are more regularly and  better fed, and are strong, well nourished and hearty. The experience  has been the regeneration of very many of them physically. This is due,  he says, to the fact that they have their food served to them regularly  and abundantly; whereas in former wars it was a matter of the greatest  difficulty for troops to be provisioned.    We asked him whether or not the water in the trenches was harmful to the  soldiers and he replied that they had very little rheumatism, and the  men did not seem to suffer from it. He said there was almost, or in  fact, no smallpox, and there was comparatively no typhoid. All of the  soldiers are innoculated against typhoid, receiving on the first  innoculation three or four injections, and subsequently being  innoculated about once in every six months, receiving then two  injections. This is for soldiers, whereas civilians are usually  innoculated about once every three years, if it is desired that they  should be kept immune from typhoid. He says they use with best results  the system of Dr. Vidal, of Paris, employing a serum in which the  bacteria have been destroyed by heat rather than by boiling. They find  the effect of this serum much better than that of others. He says that  tuberculosis does, of course, exist, because tuberculosis exists among  most civilized peoples. There is even more tuberculosis now among the  troops than at the beginning of the war; but this is not due to an  increase of tuberculosis, but is due to the fact that the later levies  of troops have included many soldiers who at the beginning would not  have been accepted, because they either had the disease or had a  tendency toward it.    He then spoke about the effect of various weapons in use. He was asked  whether the modern rifle wound was serious. He said it was either so  serious as to kill the soldier by passing-through the brain, the heart,  or some other vital part, or else it was a matter of more or less  indifference. If a rifle ball went through the fleshy part of the body,  you could pretty safely say it was not a grave wound, because the  bullets passing through the air are so cleansed and heated that when  they go through the fleshy part of the body they leave no germs and do  little harm unless they fracture a bone. We asked if they did not carry  into the wound infected pieces of the soldiers' clothing, and he said  no, that they did not find that to be the case; that the bullet went  through so quickly that it separated the clothing, and went through the  flesh clean. He even stated that a bullet could pass through the lungs;  that the wounded soldier would spit up blood, but that when attended to  at once, and the wound dressed, it would be a matter of only eight or  ten days when he would be again in fairly good condition. He said,  however, that wounds from fragments of shrapnel were of quite a  different character; that they were ragged, unclean and usually gave  much concern. He said, also, as a matter of fact, that the gun or rifle  was performing a less and less important function in warfare. That many  were even in favor of abandoning the rifle entirely as a weapon. That  the war, as carried on today, is carried on in personal assaults mainly  through the effectiveness of the grenades, handknives, revolvers and  similar weapons; that the trenches and trench warfare are not suited to  close hand-to-hand encounters, as there is not usually room enough to  manipulate a gun and bayonet. (This agrees with what was told us by our  Negro friend, Bob Scanlon, whom we met at Clermond, and who said all he  wanted and carried in an assault or a fight were grenades, a knife and a  good club, preferably of iron.)    The doctor said that for the warfare of today reliance is mainly upon  the mitrailleuse, which fires 300 shots a minute. He says that nothing  living within the range of these guns, and exposed to them, can possibly  stand. This is the small arm which had such great effect for the French  in the first days of the war. The Germans had very few guns of this kind  in the beginning, but they have since provided themselves with them. He  said that outside of these guns the most effective are the famous 75 mm.  and the 155 mm. rifles. He asked us to recall the fact that both of  these guns were fired for our benefit at St. Charmond, under the  direction of Col. Rimailho, whom we had the pleasure of meeting there,  and who was one of the important men co-operating in building the \"75\",  and who was, himself, the inventor and author of the \"155\". These are  the guns of lighter caliber which do such effective work in the field.  Of course, in addition, the French are also using guns of very large  caliber, for instance the 350 mm. These, of course, are for the  reduction of forts, and the enemy's line prior to assault.    [Illustration: Women Employed in Munitions Factories.]    Dr. Courmont wanted to know whether we had seen the new armored  caterpillar cars which they were preparing, and we told him we had seen  them at St. Charmond. He said they were to be equipped with one \"75\" gun  and with two or three mitrailleuses (the rapid fire gun), and that an  equipment like this, armored against the shrapnel of the enemy, would  doubtless be most effective for the French, as a similar caterpillar had  been for the English.          VII.    ART AND ARCHITECTURE OF ARLES      We left Lyons for Arles, in the military automobiles, passing through  and stopping for a brief time at Tarascon, made famous by Daude in his  novel, \"Tartarin of Tarascon\". Here we were given the usual reception  and pretty much the entire population of the town turned out to greet  us. The following leaflet by the Arles Chamber of Commerce outlines the  program:    * * *    Reception of the Economical Commission of the United States    Friday, September 22nd    5 o'clock 25' P.M. Reception of the Commission at the station  by the Chamber of Commerce and  the officials of the City of Arles.    7 o'clock 45' P.M. Dinner given by the Chamber of Commerce  (Hotel Du Nord).    Saturday, September 23rd    8 o'clock 30' A.M. Leave the Forum Square for the visit  of the monuments and museums of Arles.  11 o'clock 25' Luncheon given by the Chamber of Commerce  (Forum hotel).    1 o'clock 10\" P.M. Leave Forum Square for the station.    * * *    At the evening banquet at the Hotel Du Nord, on my right was J. E.  Agate, an English army officer. He had been in the quartermaster's  department, engaged in purchasing supplies for the English army. On my  left was M. Bonnet Guillaume, vice-president of the Chamber of Commerce,  and who lives at Tarascon. We met at this banquet Henri Brenier, advance  agent of the Marseilles Chamber of Commerce. He distributed a handsome  booklet prepared by the Marseilles Chamber.    [Illustration: Arlesiennes--Types of Southern France.]    Mr. Geo. B. Ford, of the Commission, delivered the following address  before the Arles Chamber of Commerce:    Yesterday afternoon I went to the Arena alone, and climbed up as  high as I could and studied it while the sunset shadows crept high  and higher and the great arches gradually faded into gloom.    The wonderful history of Arles passed before me. I saw it as the  great imperial Roman city dominating the valley.

Useful to grow for temporary  effect with permanent trees, as it will fail by the time the desirable  kinds are well established. Propagated from seed or cuttings.    =Note.=--Points of difference between _P. tremuloides_ and _P.  grandidentata_. These trees may be best distinguished in early spring by  the color of the unfolding leaves. In the sunlight the head of _P.  tremuloides_ appears yellowish-green, while that of _P. grandidentata_  is conspicuously cotton white. The leaves of _P. grandidentata_ are  larger and more coarsely toothed, and the main branches go off usually  at a broader angle. The buds of _P. grandidentata_ are mostly divergent,  dusty-looking, dull; of _P. tremuloides_, mostly appressed, highly  polished with a resinous lustre.

POPLAR.    =Habitat and Range.=--In moist soil; river banks and basins, shores of  lakes, not uncommon in drier locations.         Throughout Quebec and Ontario to the base of the Rocky mountains.    Maine,--not reported; New Hampshire,--restricted to the immediate  vicinity of the Connecticut river, disappearing near the northern part  of Westmoreland; Vermont,--western sections, abundant along the shores  of the Hoosac river in Pownal and along Lake Champlain (W. W.  Eggleston); in the Connecticut valley as far north as Brattleboro  (_Flora of Vermont_, 1900); Massachusetts,--along the Connecticut and  its tributaries; Rhode Island,--occasional; Connecticut,--occasional  eastward, common along the Connecticut, Farmington, and Housatonic  rivers.         South to Florida; west to the Rocky mountains.    =Habit.=--A stately tree, 75-100 feet in height; trunk 3-5 feet in  diameter, light gray, straight or sometimes slightly inclined, of nearly  uniform size to the point of branching, surmounted by a noble,  broad-spreading, open, symmetrical head, the lower branches massive,  horizontal, or slightly ascending, more or less pendulous at the  extremities, the upper coarse and spreading, rising at a sharper angle;  branchlets stout; foliage brilliant green, easily set in motion; the  sterile trees gorgeous in spring with dark red pendent catkins.    =Bark.=--In old trees thick, ash-gray, separated into deep, straight  furrows with rounded ridges; in young trees light yellowish-green,  smooth; season's shoots greenish, marked with pale longitudinal lines.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds large, conical, smooth, shining. Leaves  3-6 inches long, scarcely less in width, variable in color and shape,  ordinarily dark green and shining above, lighter beneath, ribs raised on  both sides; outline broadly ovate, irregularly crenate-toothed; apex  abruptly acute or acuminate; base truncate, slightly heart-shaped or  sometimes acute; stems long, slender, somewhat flattened at right angles  to the plane of the blade; stipules linear, soon falling.    =Inflorescence.=--April to May. In solitary, densely flowered catkins;  bracts lacerate-fringed, each bract subtending a cup-shaped scale;  stamens very numerous; anthers longer than the filaments, dark red:  fertile catkins elongating to 5 or 6 inches; ovary ovoid; stigmas 3 or  4, nearly sessile, spreading.    =Fruit.=--Capsules ovate, rough, short-stalked; seeds densely cottony.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy in southern-central New England; grows  rapidly in almost any soil and is readily obtainable in nurseries. Where  an immediate effect is desired, the cottonwood serves the purpose  excellently and frequently makes very fine large individual trees, but  the wood is soft and likely to be broken by wind or ice. Usually  propagated from cuttings.      [Illustration: PLATE XVII.--Populus deltoides.]      1. Winter buds.    2. Branch with sterile catkins.    3. Sterile flower, back view.    4.

POPLAR. BALM OF GILEAD.    =Habitat and Range.=--Alluvial soils; river banks, valleys, borders of  swamps, woods.         Newfoundland and Nova Scotia west to Manitoba; northward to the       coast of Alaska and along the Mackenzie river to the Arctic circle.    Maine,--common; New Hampshire,--Connecticut river valley, generally near  the river, becoming more plentiful northward; Vermont,--frequent;  Massachusetts and Rhode Island,--not reported; Connecticut,--extending  along the Housatonic river at New Milford for five or six miles, perhaps  derived from an introduced tree (C. K. Averill, _Rhodora_, II, 35).         West through northern New York, Michigan, Minnesota, Dakota (Black       Hills), Montana, beyond the Rockies to the Pacific coast.    =Habit.=--A medium-sized tree, 30-75 feet high, trunk 1-3 feet in  diameter, straight; branches horizontal or nearly so, slender for size  of tree, short; head open, narrow-oblong or oblong-conical; branchlets  mostly terete; foliage thin.    =Bark.=--In old trees dark gray or ash-gray, firm-ridged, in young trees  smooth; branchlets grayish; season's shoots reddish or greenish brown,  sparsely orange-dotted.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds 3/4 inch long, appressed or slightly  divergent, conical, slender, acute, resin-coated, sticky, fragrant when  opening. Leaves 3-6 inches long, about one-half as wide, yellowish when  young, when mature bright green, whitish below; outline ovate-lanceolate  or ovate, finely toothed, gradually tapering to an acute or acuminate  apex; base obtuse to rounded, sometimes truncate or heart-shaped;  leafstalk much shorter than the blade, terete or nearly so; stipules  soon falling. The leaves of var. _intermedia_ are obovate to oval; those  of var. _latifolia_ closely approach the leaves of _P. candicans_.    =Inflorescence.=--April. Sterile 3-4 inches long, fertile at first about  the same length, gradually elongating, loosely flowered; bracts  irregularly and rather narrowly cut-toothed, each bract subtending a  cup-shaped disk; stamens numerous; anthers red: ovary short-stalked;  stigmas two, 2-lobed, large, wavy-margined.    =Fruit.=--Fruiting catkins drooping, 4-6 inches long: capsules ovoid,  acute, longer than the pedicels, green: seeds numerous, hairy.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; grows in all  excepting very wet soils, in full sun or light shade, and in exposed  situations; of rapid growth, but subject to the attacks of borers, which  kill the branches and make the head unsightly; also spreads from the  roots, and therefore not desirable for ornamental plantations; most  useful in the formation of shelter-belts; readily transplanted but not  common in nurseries. Propagated from cuttings.    [Illustration: PLATE XVIII.--Populus balsamifera.]      1. Branch with"]]]
