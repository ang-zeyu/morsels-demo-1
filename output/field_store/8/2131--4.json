The  mean value of the proper motions amounts to 1\".34, a very high value.    In the table we find no star with great apparent luminosity. The  brightest is the 10th star in the table which has the magnitude 5.1. The  mean apparent magnitude is 7.7. As to the absolute magnitude (_M_) we  see that most of these speedy stars, as well as the stars with great  proper motions in table 3, have a rather great _positive_ magnitude and  thus are absolutely faint stars, though they perhaps may not be directly  considered as dwarf stars. Their mean absolute magnitude is +3.0.    Regarding the spectrum we find that these stars generally belong to the  yellow or red types (G, K, M), but there are 6 F-stars and, curiously  enough, two A-stars. After the designation of their type (A2 and A3) is  the letter _p_ (= peculiar), indicating that the spectrum in some  respect differs from the usual appearance of the spectrum of this type.  In the present case the peculiarity consists in the fact that a line of  the wave-length 448.1, which emanates from magnesium and which we may  find on plate III in the spectrum of Sirius, does not occur in the  spectrum of these stars, though the spectrum has otherwise the same  appearance as in the case of the Sirius stars. There is reason to  suppose that the absence of this line indicates a low power of radiation  (low temperature) in these stars (compare ADAMS).

It has a parallax of 0\".75,  corresponding to a distance of 0.27 siriometers (= 4.26 light years).  This distance is obtained from the annual parallax with great accuracy,  and the result is moreover confirmed in another way (from the study of  the orbit of the companion of [alpha] Centauri). In the year 1916 INNES  discovered at the observatory of Johannesburg in the Transvaal a star of  the 10th magnitude, which seems to follow [alpha] Centauri in its path  in the heavens, and which, in any case, lies at the same distance from  the earth, or somewhat nearer. It is not possible at present to decide  with accuracy whether _Proxima Centauri_--as the star is called by  INNES--or [alpha] Centauri is our nearest neighbour. Then comes  BARNARD's star (175204), whose large proper motion we have already  mentioned. As No. 5 we find Sirius, as No. 8 Procyon, as No. 21 Altair.  The others are of the third magnitude or fainter. No. 10--61 Cygni--is  especially interesting, being the first star for which the astronomers,  after long and painful endeavours in vain, have succeeded in determining  the distance with the help of the annual parallax (BESSEL 1841).    From column 4 we find that the distribution of these stars on the sky is  tolerably uniform, as might have been predicted. All these stars have a  large proper motion, this being in the mean 3\".42 per year. This was a  priori to be expected from their great proximity. The radial velocity  is, numerically, greater than could have been supposed. This fact is  probably associated with the generally small mass of these stars.    Their apparent magnitude is upon an average 6.3. The brightest of the  near stars is Sirius (_m_ = -1.6), the faintest Proxima Centauri (_m_ =  11). Through the systematic researches of the astronomers we may be sure  that no bright stars exist at a distance smaller than one siriometer,  for which the distance is not already known and well determined. The  following table contains without doubt--we may call them briefly all  _near_ stars--all stars within one siriometer from us with an apparent  magnitude brighter than 6m (the table has 8 such stars), and probably  also all near stars brighter than 7m (10 stars), or even all brighter  than the eighth magnitude (the table has 13 such stars and two near the  limit). Regarding the stars of the eighth magnitude or fainter no  systematic investigations of the annual parallax have been made and  among these stars we may get from time to time a new star belonging to  the siriometer sphere in the neighbourhood of the sun. To determine  the total number of stars within this sphere is one of the fundamental  problems in stellar statistics, and to this question I shall return  immediately.

Tra la lee! Tra la lee!      Putnam Hall's the place for me!          The best old school I know!\"    And then, as the carryall swung up to the campus, they set up the school  yell, which brought out a score of students to witness the arrival of  the Rover boys.          CHAPTER XI    WILLIAM PHILANDER TUBBS      As my old readers know, Putnam Hall was a handsome structure of brick  and stone standing in the center of a large plot of ground, bounded on  two sides by cedar woods. To the front was the campus and the wagon road  and beyond this a slope leading to the lake. To the rear were rich farm  lands, cultivated solely for the benefit of the institution. Besides the  school, there were a building fitted up as a gymnasium, and also several  barns and carriage houses. The Hall was built in the form of the letter  E, and was three stories high. It contained numerous classrooms, a  private office, a large mess hall, or dining room, and both large and  small dormitories.    The master of the school was Captain Victor Putnam, who was a bachelor,  and as kind as he was strict. Captain Putnam was a West Point graduate,  and had modeled his school somewhat after that famous government  institution. When the school was first organized the Rover boys did not  go there, but a number of other bright and lively lads did, and what  these cadets accomplished has already been related in a line of stories  called \"The Putnam Hall Series,\" starting with \"The Putnam Hall Cadets.\"  These lads had some awful quarrels with the head assistant, Josiah  Crabtree, and they were glad when the Rovers appeared and made it so hot  for Crabtree that he had to leave. George Strong was now first assistant  in place of Crabtree, and the cadets found him a teacher after their own  heart.    \"Hurrah! here are the Rovers!\" was the cry from the campus. \"Welcome  back!\"    \"Boys, I am glad to see you again,\" came from Captain Putnam, as he  appeared at the front door and shook hands. \"From what I have heard you  have had rather strenuous times during the past vacation.\"    \"That is true, Captain,\" answered Dick. \"I am glad to get back here.\"    \"So am I glad,\" came from Tom and Sam, and all shook hands. Then the  boys were told to go to the mess hall, where a hot supper awaited them.  Here Mrs. Green met them with her round, ruddy and smiling face.    \"It's wonderful stories I've heard of you,\" said the matron. \"I declare,  you'll have to go into a museum!\"    \"Not until after supper anyhow,\" answered Tom, dryly. And then everybody  present laughed.    The supper over, the boys went up to their dormitory, and here as many  of the cadets as could crowded in, to talk over the doings of the past  vacation. Larry Colby had spent the time on the coast of Maine, and  George Granbury had been to the Thousand Islands and to Montreal.    \"Yes, Crabtree is in Canada,\" said George. \"I met him in Montreal, and I  can tell you, he looked seedy enough.\"    \"Well, he deserves to be seedy,\" was Dick's comment. He could not forget  how the former teacher had endeavored to hypnotize the widow Stanhope  into marrying him, so that he could gain possession of the money she was  holding in trust for Dora.    Of course all the boys wanted to know about Dan Baxter, for he had been  a leading character at the Hall for many years. Some shook their heads  at the idea of the former bully reforming.    \"It will be the greatest surprise I ever heard of,\" was Larry's comment.    \"He'll do it--mark my words,\" said Dick.    \"Let us hope so,\" said George.    \"Well, it would seem that Putnam Hall is not to suffer for the want of a  bully,\" came from Fred. \"We've got a new one here who is as bad as Dan  Baxter ever was.\"    \"Who is he?\" questioned Dick, with interest.    \"A chap named Tad Sobber. He is a big, overbearing fellow with hardly  any education, and he wants to rule everybody. I can't understand how  Captain Putnam took him as a pupil.\"    \"He came well recommended, that's why,\" answered Songbird. \"But I guess  the captain has found out that the recommendation was false.\"    \"He shan't rule me,\" said Tom, decidedly.    \"We want no bullies here,\" put in Dick. \"The day for all such is past.\"    \"So say we all of us!\" cried several cadets.    At that moment came a knock on the door, and a tall youth, wearing an  unusually high collar and very large cuffs, came in.    \"Well, if it isn't our old chum, William Philander Tubbs!\" cried Dick,  running forward and grasping the hand of the dude student.    \"Hullo, Tubbsey, old man!\" said Tom, gaily. \"What's the price of the  best cologne now?\"    \"Very--ah--glad to meet you again,\" drawled Tubbs. \"But--er--please  don't call me Tubbsey, because it isn't my name, don't you know.\"    \"To be sure, Buttertub--I mean Washtub,\" answered Tom. \"Had your hair  crimped lately?\"    \"Now, Tom, I never crimp my hair--it hurts the color, don't you know,\"  explained William Philander. \"I use----\"    \"Glue with an egg beater,\" finished Tom with a wink at his friends. \"By  the way, Tubblets, do you know what I heard some girls say last week?  They said they thought you were a regular fashion plate.\"    \"Now did they really?\" gushed the dude, much pleased. \"Who--er--said  it?\"    \"Two girls living not many miles from here.\"    \"You--ah--don't happen to know their names?\"    \"No. But I can tell you all about them.\"    \"Ah! Then please do, Tom,\" said the dude eagerly. To have any young  ladies think of him pleased him immensely.    \"Well, these are a couple of young ladies who work in a laundry. Maybe  they wash your shirts. They are colored, and----\"    \"Colored!\" gasped the dude, and then a shout of laughter went up, in the  midst of which William Philander started to leave the room.    \"Don't go away mad, Billy,\" cried Tom. \"Isn't it nice even to have two  dusky damsels think of you?\"    \"No, it is not--it is--is horrid!\" answered William Philander. \"I think  you are--er--poking fun at me.\"    \"Never did such a thing in my life, my dear fellow--it's against my  internal regulations. But how have you been since the week before next  month?\"    \"I had a delightful vacation.\"    \"Took the girls out to ice-cream sociables and yellow teas every day you  wasn't playing golf or hop-scotch, I suppose.\"    \"I--er--took the young ladies out some--we had glorious times, don't you  know. One moonlight night on Lake George I shall never forget, don't you  know. We were out in a tiny rowboat and the moon was sparkling over the  water, and Geraldine and I----\"    \"Lucky Geraldine!\" sighed Tom. \"And thrice lucky Philander Willander--I  mean William Philander!\"    \"Can't you make up a poem about Geraldine, Songbird?\" asked Sam.    \"And don't forget to put in the moonlight,\" came from Dick.    \"And the silvery waves, and murmuring breeze,\" added Fred.    \"How much older than you is Geraldine, any how?\" quizzed Tom.    \"Geraldine is----\"    \"You haven't got to tell her age if she is over thirty, Billy,\" said  Larry. \"Her age is sacred after that, you know.\"    \"And don't tell us even if she has false teeth,\" came from Sam.    \"And it doesn't make any real difference whether her hair is her own or  not.\"    \"It's hers if it is paid for,\" said Tom. \"You don't suppose a girl that  Billy would fall in love with would wear tresses that were stolen?\"    \"And to think she may be fat!\" sighed Sam. \"I hope she doesn't weigh  over two hundred, Willy.\"    \"Oh dear me!\" cried the dude, in desperation. \"I want you to  remember----\"    \"That she is yours and yours only,\" finished Tom. \"Yes, nobody shall  walk in your corn patch, Bill--not over my dead body. But tell  us--secretly if you must--does she wear a number eight shoe or a  twelve?\"    \"If you don't stop your fooling----\" gasped the dude.    \"He is going to keep his dreadful secrets to himself,\" cried Tom,  mournfully. \"Alack! and too bad! But never mind, we'll all come to the  wedding, Tubblets, and bring lemons if you say so?\"    \"Who said I was going to get married?\"    \"Is it to be a church affair or just a little private home gathering?\"  went on Tom, seriously. \"If it's to be in a church, and you want us all  for rushers--I mean ushers, why----\"    \"We'll all be on the job,\" finished Dick. \"Wouldn't miss the chance for  a farm with a blind mule thrown in.\"    \"Vots der madder mid me peing a flower girl?\" asked Hans, grinning  broadly.    \"No, Hansy, you'll have to carry Billy's coat-tails for him,\" said Fred.  \"The latest style from London, don't you know, is to have them trailing  on behind like----\"    \"Oh, stop! stop!\" screamed William Philander, putting his hands to his  ears. \"You are all perfectly horrid, don't you know! I'll not remain  another minute!\" and he fled from the dormitory, the laughter of the  crowd ringing in his ears as he departed.          CHAPTER XII    WHAT HAPPENED ON THE STAIRS      In a few days the Rover boys felt perfectly at home once more--indeed it  was as if they had never been away, so Sam said. The majority of the  students were old friends, although there was a fair sprinkling of new  boys.    It was not until the end of the week that Dick Rover came into contact  with Tad Sobber, a stocky youth, with a shock of black hair and eyes  which were cold and penetrating. Sobber was with a chum named Nick Pell,  and both eyed Dick in a calculating manner which was highly offensive.    \"He's the fellow who does the hero act,\""]]]
