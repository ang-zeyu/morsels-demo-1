There we       find traces of an extra column of text preceding that in       which the first Kingdom of Kish was recorded. It would seem       almost certain that this extra column was devoted to       Antediluvian kings. The only alternative explanation would       be that it was inscribed with the summaries which conclude       the Sumerian copies of our list. But later scribes do not so       transpose their material, and the proper place for summaries       is at the close, not at the beginning, of a list. In the       Assyrian copy the Dynastic List is brought up to date, and       extends down to the later Assyrian period. Formerly its       compiler could only be credited with incorporating       traditions of earlier times. But the correspondence of the       small fragment preserved of its Second Column with part of       the First Column of the Nippur texts (including the name of       \"Enmennunna\") proves that the Assyrian scribe reproduced an       actual copy of the Sumerian document.    Though Professor Barton, on the other hand, holds that the Dynastic  List had no concern with the Deluge, his suggestion that the early  names preserved by it may have been the original source of Berossus'  Antediluvian rulers(1) may yet be accepted in a modified form. In coming  to his conclusion he may have been influenced by what seems to me an  undoubted correspondence between one of the rulers in our list and the  sixth Antediluvian king of Berossus. I think few will be disposed to  dispute the equation    {Daonos poimon} = Etana, a shepherd.    Each list preserves the hero's shepherd origin and the correspondence of  the names is very close, Daonos merely transposing the initial vowel  of Etana.(2) That Berossus should have translated a Post-diluvian ruler  into the Antediluvian dynasty would not be at all surprising in view of  the absence of detailed correspondence between his later dynasties and  those we know actually occupied the Babylonian throne. Moreover, the  inclusion of Babylon in his list of Antediluvian cities should make us  hesitate to regard all the rulers he assigns to his earliest dynasty  as necessarily retaining in his list their original order in Sumerian  tradition. Thus we may with a clear conscience seek equations between  the names of Berossus' Antediluvian rulers and those preserved in the  early part of our Dynastic List, although we may regard the latter as  equally Post-diluvian in Sumerian belief.         (1) See the brief statement he makes in the course of a       review of Dr. Poebel's volumes in the _American Journal of       Semitic Languages and Literature_, XXXI, April 1915, p. 225.       He does not compare any of the names, but he promises a       study of those preserved and a comparison of the list with       Berossus and with Gen. iv and v. It is possible that       Professor Barton has already fulfilled his promise of       further discussion, perhaps in his _Archaeology and the       Bible_, to the publication of which I have seen a reference       in another connexion (cf. _Journ. Amer. Or. Soc._, Vol.       XXXVI, p. 291); but I have not yet been able to obtain sight       of a copy.         (2) The variant form {Daos} is evidently a mere contraction,       and any claim it may have had to represent more closely the       original form of the name is to be disregarded in view of       our new equation.    This reflection, and the result already obtained, encourage us to accept  the following further equation, which is yielded by a renewed scrutiny  of the lists:    {'Ammenon} = Enmenunna.    Here Ammenon, the fourth of Berossus' Antediluvian kings, presents a  wonderfully close transcription of the Sumerian name. The _n_ of the  first syllable has been assimilated to the following consonant in  accordance with a recognized law of euphony, and the resultant doubling  of the _m_ is faithfully preserved in the Greek. Precisely the same  initial component, _Enme_, occurs in the name Enmeduranki, borne by a  mythical king of Sippar, who has long been recognized as the original  of Berossus' seventh Antediluvian king, {Euedorakhos}.(1) There too  the original _n_ has been assimilated, but the Greek form retains no  doubling of the _m_ and points to its further weakening.         (1) Var. {Euedoreskhos}; the second half of the original       name, Enmeduranki, is more closely preserved in       _Edoranchus_, the form given by the Armenian translator of       Eusebius.    I do not propose to detain you with a detailed discussion of Sumerian  royal names and their possible Greek equivalents. I will merely point  out that the two suggested equations, which I venture to think we  may regard as established, throw the study of Berossus' mythological  personages upon a new plane. No equivalent has hitherto been suggested  for {Daonos}; but {'Ammenon} has been confidently explained as the  equivalent of a conjectured Babylonian original, Ummanu, lit. \"Workman\".  The fact that we should now have recovered the Sumerian original of  the name, which proves to have no connexion in form or meaning with the  previously suggested Semitic equivalent, tends to cast doubt on other  Semitic equations proposed. Perhaps {'Amelon} or {'Amillaros} may after  all not prove to be the equivalent of Amelu, \"Man\", nor {'Amempsinos}  that of Amel-Sin. Both may find their true equivalents in some of the  missing royal names at the head of the Sumerian Dynastic List. There too  we may provisionally seek {'Aloros}, the \"first king\", whose equation  with Aruru, the Babylonian mother-goddess, never appeared a very happy  suggestion.(1) The ingenious proposal,(2) on the other hand, that his  successor, {'Alaparos}, represents a miscopied {'Adaparos}, a Greek  rendering of the name of Adapa, may still hold good in view of Etana's  presence in the Sumerian dynastic record. Ut-napishtim's title,  Khasisatra or Atrakhasis, \"the Very Wise\", still of course remains  the established equivalent of {Xisouthros}; but for {'Otiartes} (?  {'Opartes}), a rival to Ubar-Tutu, Ut-napishtim's father, may perhaps  appear. The new identifications do not of course dispose of the old  ones, except in the case of Ummanu; but they open up a new line of  approach and provide a fresh field for conjecture.(3) Semitic, and  possibly contracted, originals are still possible for unidentified  mythical kings of Berossus; but such equations will inspire greater  confidence, should we be able to establish Sumerian originals for the  Semitic renderings, from new material already in hand or to be obtained  in the future.         (1) Dr. Poebel (_Hist Inscr._, p. 42, n. 1) makes the       interesting suggestion that {'Aloros} may represent an       abbreviated and corrupt form of the name Lal-ur-alimma,       which has come down to us as that of an early and mythical       king of Nippur; see Rawlinson, _W.A.I._, IV, 60 (67), V, 47       and 44, and cf. _Sev. Tabl. of Creat._, Vol. I, p. 217, No.       32574, Rev., l. 2 f. It may be added that the sufferings       with which the latter is associated in the tradition are       perhaps such as might have attached themselves to the first       human ruler of the world; but the suggested equation, though       tempting by reason of the remote parallel it would thus       furnish to Adam's fate, can at present hardly be accepted in       view of the possibility that a closer equation to {'Aloros}       may be forthcoming.

But it is time I read you extracts from the earlier extant portions of  the Sumerian Dynastic List, in order to illustrate the class of document  with which we are dealing. From them it will be seen that the record  is not a tabular list of names like the well-known King's Lists of the  Neo-Babylonian period. It is cast in the form of an epitomized chronicle  and gives under set formulae the length of each king's reign, and his  father's name in cases of direct succession to father or brother. Short  phrases are also sometimes added, or inserted in the sentence referring  to a king, in order to indicate his humble origin or the achievement  which made his name famous in tradition. The head of the First Column  of the text is wanting, and the first royal name that is completely  preserved is that of Galumum, the ninth or tenth ruler of the earliest  \"kingdom\", or dynasty, of Kish. The text then runs on connectedly for  several lines:         Galumum ruled for nine hundred years.       Zugagib ruled for eight hundred and forty years.       Arpi, son of a man of the people, ruled for seven hundred and            twenty       years.       Etana, the shepherd who ascended to heaven, who subdued all lands,       ruled for six hundred and thirty-five years.(1)       Pili . . ., son of Etana, ruled for four hundred and ten years.       Enmenunna ruled for six hundred and eleven years.       Melamkish, son of Enmenunna, ruled for nine hundred years.       Barsalnunna, son of Enmenunna, ruled for twelve hundred years.       Mesza(. . .), son of Barsalnunna, ruled for (. . .) years.       (. . .), son of Barsalnunna, ruled for (. . .) years.         (1) Possibly 625 years.    A small gap then occurs in the text, but we know that the last two  representatives of this dynasty of twenty-three kings are related to  have ruled for nine hundred years and six hundred and twenty-five  years respectively. In the Second Column of the text the lines are also  fortunately preserved which record the passing of the first hegemony  of Kish to the \"Kingdom of Eanna\", the latter taking its name from  the famous temple of Anu and Ishtar in the old city of Erech. The text  continues:         The kingdom of Kish passed to Eanna.         In Eanna, Meskingasher, son of the Sun-god, ruled as high       priest and king for three"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20300"],[0,"Henry VIII. (#10)"],[1,"yed, he would be a rash man who  would guarantee even now the integrity of parliamentary power or the  continuance of cabinet rule. In those days, with thirty years of civil  war and fifteen more of conspiracy fresh in men's minds, with no  alternative to anarchy save Henry VIII., with a peerage fallen     (p. 042)  from its high estate, and a Parliament almost lost to respect, royal  autocracy was not a thing to dread or distrust. \"If a lion knew his  strength,\" said Sir Thomas More of his master to Cromwell, \"it were  hard for any man to rule him.\" Henry VIII. had the strength of a lion;  it remains to be seen how soon he learnt it, and what use he made of  that strength when he discovered the secret.                       [Footnote 77: F.M. Nichols, _Epistles of Erasmus_,                     i., 457.]          CHAPTER III.                                                       (p. 043)    THE APPRENTICESHIP OF HENRY VIII.      Quietly and peacefully, without a threat from abroad or a murmur at  home, the crown, which his father had won amid the storm and stress of  the field of battle, devolved upon Henry VIII. With an eager profusion  of zeal Ferdinand of Aragon placed at Henry's disposal his army, his  fleet, his personal services.[78] There was no call for this sacrifice.  For generations there had been no such tranquil demise of the crown.  Not a ripple disturbed the surface of affairs as the old King lay sick  in April, 1509, in Richmond Palace at Sheen. By his bedside stood his  only surviving son; and to him the dying monarch addressed his last  words of advice. He desired him to complete his marriage with Catherine,  he exhorted him to defend the Church, and to make war on the infidel;  he commended to him his faithful councillors, and is believed to have  urged upon him the execution of De la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, the White  Rose of England. On the 22nd he was dead. A fortnight later the funeral  procession wended its way from Sheen to St. Paul's, where the illustrious  John Fisher, cardinal and martyr, preached the _eloge_. Thence it  (p. 044)  passed down the Strand, between hedges and willows clad in the fresh  green of spring, to          That acre sown indeed    With the richest, royallest seed    That the earth did e'er drink in.    There, in the vault beneath the chapel in Westminster Abbey, which  bears his name and testifies to his magnificence in building, Henry  VII. was laid to rest beside his Queen; dwelling, says Bacon, \"more  richly dead in the monument of his tomb than he did alive in Richmond  or any of his palaces\". For years before and after, Torrigiano, the  rival of Buonarotti, wrought at its \"matchless altar,\" not a stone of  which survived the Puritan fury of the civil war.                       [Footnote 78: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 4.]    On the day of his father's death, or the next, the new King removed  from Richmond Palace to the Tower, whence, on 23rd April, was dated  the first official act of his reign. He confirmed in ampler form the  general pardon granted a few days before by Henry VII.; but the ampler  form was no bar to the exemption of fourscore offenders from the act  of grace.[79] Foremost among them were the three brothers De la Pole,  Sir Richard Empson and Edmund Dudley. The exclusion of Empson and  Dudley from the pardon was more popular than the pardon itself. If  anything could have enhanced Henry's favour with his subjects, it was  the condign punishment of the tools of his father's extortion. Their  death was none the less welcome for being unjust. They were not merely  refused pardon and brought to the block; a more costly concession was  made when their bonds for the payment of loans were cancelled.[80]  Their victims, so runs the official record, had been \"without      (p. 045)  any ground or matter of truth, by the undue means of certain of the  council of our said late father, thereunto driven contrary to law,  reason and good conscience, to the manifest charge and peril of the  soul of our said late father\".                       [Footnote 79: _L. and P._, i., 2, 12.]                       [Footnote 80: _Cf. L. and P._, i., 1004.]    If filial piety demanded the delivery of his father's soul from peril,  it counselled no less the fulfilment of his dying requests, and the  arrangements for Catherine's marriage were hurried on with an almost  indecent haste. The instant he heard rumours of Henry VII.'s death,  Ferdinand sent warning to his envoy in England that Louis of France  and others would seek by all possible means to break off the match.[81]  To further it, he would withdraw his objections to the union of Charles  and Mary; and a few days later he wrote again to remove any scruples  Henry might entertain about marrying his deceased brother's wife;  while to Catherine herself he declared with brutal frankness that she  would get no other husband than Henry.[82] All his paternal anxiety  might have been spared. Long before Ferdinand's persuasions could  reach Henry's ears, he had made up his mind to consummate the marriage.  He would not, he wrote to Margaret of Savoy,[83] disobey his father's  commands, reinforced as they were by the dispensation of the Pope and  by the friendship between the two families contracted by his sister  Mary's betrothal to Catherine's nephew Charles. There were other  reasons besides those he alleged. A council trained by Henry VII. was  loth to lose the gold of Catherine's dower; it was of the utmost  importance to strengthen at once the royal line; and a full-blooded  youth of Henry's temperament was not likely to repel a comely      (p. 046)  wife ready to his hand, when the dictates of his father's policy no  longer stood between them. So on 11th June, barely a month after Henry  VII.'s obsequies, the marriage, big with destinies, of Henry VIII. and  Catherine of Aragon was privately solemnised by Archbishop Warham \"in  the Queen's closet\" at Greenwich.[84] On the same day the commission  of claims was appointed for the King's and Queen's coronation. A week  then sufficed for its business, and on Sunday, 24th June, the Abbey  was the scene of a second State function within three months. Its  splendour and display were emblematic of the coming reign. Warham  placed the crown on the King's head; the people cried, \"Yea, yea!\" in  a loud voice when asked if they would have Henry as King; Sir Robert  Dymock performed the office of champion; and a banquet, jousts and  tourneys concluded the ceremonies.                       [Footnote 81: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 3.]                       [Footnote 82: _Ibid._, ii., 8, 15.]                       [Footnote 83: _L. and P._, i., 224.]                       [Footnote 84: _L. and P._, iv., 5774.]           *       *       *       *       *    Though he had wedded a wife and been crowned a king, Henry was as yet  little more than a boy. A powerful mind ripens slowly in a vigorous  frame, and Henry's childish precocity had given way before a youthful  devotion to physical sports. He was no prodigy of early development.  His intellect, will and character were of a gradual, healthier growth;  they were not matured for many years after he came to the throne. He  was still in his eighteenth year; and like most young Englishmen of  means and muscle, his interests centred rather in the field than in  the study. Youth sat on the prow and pleasure at the helm. \"Continual  feasting\" was the phrase in which Catherine described their early married  life. In the winter evenings there were masks and comedies, romps  (p. 047)  and revels, in which Henry himself, Bessie Blount and other young  ladies of his Court played parts.[85] In the spring and summer there  were archery and tennis. Music, we are told, was practised day and  night. Two months after his accession Henry wrote to Ferdinand that he  diverted himself with jousts, birding, hunting, and other innocent and  honest pastimes, in visiting various parts of his kingdom, but that he  did not therefore neglect affairs of State.[86] Possibly he was as  assiduous in his duties as modern university athletes in their studies;  the neglect was merely comparative. But Ferdinand's ambassador remarked  on Henry's aversion to business, and his councillors complained that  he cared only for the pleasures of his age. Two days a week, said the  Spaniard, were devoted to single combats on foot, initiated in imitation  of the heroes of romance, Amadis and Lancelot;[87] and if Henry's  other innocent and honest pastimes were equally exacting, his view of  the requirements of State may well have been modest. From the earliest  days of his reign the general outline of policy was framed in accord  with his sentiments, and he was probably consulted on most questions  of importance. But it was not always so; in August, 1509, Louis XII.  acknowledged a letter purporting to come from the English King with a  request for friendship and peace. \"Who wrote this letter?\" burst out  Henry. \"I ask peace of the King of France, who dare not look me in the  face, still less make war on me!\"[88] His pride at the age of eighteen  was not less than his ignorance of what passed in his name. He had (p. 048)  yet to learn the secret that painful and laborious mastery of detail  is essential to him who aspires not merely to reign but to rule; and  matters of detail in administration and diplomacy were still left in  his ministers' hands.                       [Footnote 85: _L. and P._, vol. ii., p. 1461.]                       [Footnote 86: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 19.]                       [Footnote 87: _Ibid._, ii., 44, 45.]                       [Footnote 88: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 11.]    With the exception of Empson and Dudley, Henry made little or no change  in the council his father bequeathed him. Official precedence appertained  to his Chancellor, Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury. Like most of  Henry VII.'s prelates, he received his preferment in the Church as a  reward for services to"]]]
