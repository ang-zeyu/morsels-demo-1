Rantzau, the founder of the great library at Copenhagen, whose days were  dissolved in the pleasures of reading, discovers his taste and ardour in  the following elegant effusion:--        Salvete aureoli mei libelli,      Meae deliciae, mei lepores!      Quam vos saepe oculis juvat videre,      Et tritos manibus tenere nostris!      Tot vos eximii, tot eruditi,      Prisci lumina saeculi et recentis,      Confecere viri, suasque vobis      Ausi credere lucubrationes:      Et sperare decus perenne scriptis;      Neque haec irrita spes fefellit illos.        IMITATED.        Golden volumes! richest treasures!      Objects of delicious pleasures!      You my eyes rejoicing please,      You my hands in rapture seize!      Brilliant wits, and musing sages,      Lights who beamed through many ages,      Left to your conscious leaves their story,      And dared to trust you with their glory;      And now their hope of fame achieved,      Dear volumes! you have not deceived!    This passion for the enjoyment of _books_ has occasioned their lovers  embellishing their outsides with costly ornaments;[7] a fancy which  ostentation may have abused; but when these volumes belong to the real  man of letters, the most fanciful bindings are often the emblems of his  taste and feelings. The great Thuanus procured the finest copies for his  library, and his volumes are still eagerly purchased, bearing his  autograph on the last page. A celebrated amateur was Grollier; the Muses  themselves could not more ingeniously have ornamented their favourite  works. I have seen several in the libraries of curious collectors. They  are gilded and stamped with peculiar neatness; the compartments on the  binding are drawn, and painted, with subjects analogous to the works  themselves; and they are further adorned by that amiable inscription,  _Jo. Grollierii et amicorum!_--purporting that these literary treasures  were collected for himself and for his friends.    The family of the Fuggers had long felt an hereditary passion for the  accumulation of literary treasures: and their portraits, with others in  their picture gallery, form a curious quarto volume of 127 portraits,  rare even in Germany, entitled \"Fuggerorum Pinacotheca.\"[8] Wolfius, who  daily haunted their celebrated library, pours out his gratitude in some  Greek verses, and describes this bibliotheque as a literary heaven,  furnished with as many books as there were stars in the firmament; or as  a literary garden, in which he passed entire days in gathering fruit and  flowers, delighting and instructing himself by perpetual occupation.    In 1364, the royal library of France did not exceed twenty volumes.  Shortly after, Charles V. increased it to 900, which, by the fate of  war, as much at least as by that of money, the Duke of Bedford  afterwards purchased and transported to London, where libraries were  smaller than on the continent, about 1440. It is a circumstance worthy  observation, that the French sovereign, Charles V. surnamed the Wise,  ordered that thirty portable lights, with a silver lamp suspended from  the centre, should be illuminated at night, that students might not find  their pursuits interrupted at any hour. Many among us, at this moment,  whose professional avocations admit not of morning studies, find that  the resources of a public library are not accessible to them, from the  omission of the regulation of the zealous Charles V. of France. An  objection to night-studies in public libraries is the danger of fire,  and in our own British Museum not a light is permitted to be carried  about on any pretence whatever. The history of the \"Bibliotheque du Roi\"  is a curious incident in literature; and the progress of the human mind  and public opinion might be traced by its gradual accessions, noting the  changeable qualities of its literary stores chiefly from theology, law,  and medicine, to philosophy and elegant literature. It was first under  Louis XIV. that the productions of the art of engraving were there  collected and arranged; the great minister Colbert purchased the  extensive collections of the Abbe de Marolles, who may be ranked among  the fathers of our print-collectors. Two hundred and sixty-four ample  portfolios laid the foundations, and the very catalogues of his  collections, printed by Marolles himself, are rare and high-priced. Our  own national print gallery is growing from its infant establishment.    Mr. Hallam has observed, that in 1440, England had made comparatively  but little progress in learning--and Germany was probably still less  advanced. However, in Germany, Trithemius, the celebrated abbot of  Spanheim, who died in 1516, had amassed about two thousand manuscripts;  a literary treasure which excited such general attention, that princes  and eminent men travelled to visit Trithemius and his library. About  this time, six or eight hundred volumes formed a royal collection, and  their cost could only be furnished by a prince. This was indeed a great  advancement in libraries, for at the beginning of the fourteenth century  the library of Louis IX. contained only four classical authors; and that  of Oxford, in 1300, consisted of \"a few tracts kept in chests.\"    The pleasures of study are classed by Burton among those exercises or  recreations of the mind which pass _within doors_. Looking about this  \"world of books,\" he exclaims, \"I could even live and die with such  meditations, and take more delight and true content of mind in them than  in all thy wealth and sport! There is a sweetness, which, as Circe's  cup, bewitcheth a student: he cannot leave off, as well may witness  those many laborious hours, days, and nights, spent in their voluminous  treatises. So sweet is the delight of study. The last day is _prioris  discipulus_. Heinsius was mewed up in the library of Leyden all the year  long, and that which, to my thinking, should have bred a loathing,  caused in him a greater liking. 'I no sooner,' saith he, 'come into the  library, but I bolt the door to me, excluding Lust, Ambition, Avarice,  and all such vices, whose nurse is Idleness, the mother of Ignorance and  Melancholy. In the very lap of eternity, amongst so many divine souls, I  take my seat with so lofty a spirit, and sweet content, that I pity all  our great ones and rich men, that know not this happiness.'\" Such is the  incense of a votary who scatters it on the altar less for the ceremony  than from the devotion.[9]    There is, however, an intemperance in study, incompatible often with our  social or more active duties. The illustrious Grotius exposed himself to  the reproaches of some of his contemporaries for having too warmly  pursued his studies, to the detriment of his public station. It was the  boast of Cicero that his philosophical studies had never interfered with  the services he owed the republic, and that he had only dedicated to  them the hours which others give to their walks, their repasts, and  their pleasures. Looking on his voluminous labours, we are surprised at  this observation;--how honourable is it to him, that his various  philosophical works bear the titles of the different villas he  possessed, which indicates that they were composed in these respective  retirements! Cicero must have been an early riser; and practised that  magic art in the employment of time, which multiplies our days.      FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 5: The Cottonian collection is the richest English historic  library we possess, and is now located in the British Museum, having  been purchased for the use of the nation by Parliament in 1707, at a  cost of 4500_l._ The collection of Sir Hans Sloane was added thereto in  1753, for the sum of 20,000_l._ Dr. Birch and Mr. Cracherode bequeathed  their most valuable collections to the British Museum. Mr. Douce is the  only collector in the list above who bequeathed his curious gatherings  elsewhere. He was an officer of the Museum for many years, but preferred  to leave his treasures to the Bodleian Library, where they are preserved  intact, according to his earnest wish, a wish he feared might not be  gratified in the national building. It is to this scholar and friend,  the author of these volumes has dedicated them, as a lasting memorial of  an esteem which endured during the life of each.]    [Footnote 6: By Mr. Inglis, in 1832. This famous bishop is said to have  possessed more books than all the others in England put together. Like  Magliabechi, he lived among them, and those who visited him had to  dispense with ceremony and step over the volumes that always strewed his  floor.]    [Footnote 7: The earliest decorated books were the Consular Diptycha,  ivory bookcovers richly sculptured in relief, and destined to contain  upon their tablets the Fasti Consulares, the list ending with the name  of the new consul, whose property they happened to be. Such as have  descended to our own times appear to be works of the lower empire. They  were generally decorated with full length figures of the consul and  attendants, superintending the sports of the circus, or conjoined with  portraits of the reigning prince and emblematic figures. The Greek  Church adopted the style for the covers of the sacred volume, and  ancient clerical libraries formerly possessed many such specimens of  early bookbinding; the covers being richly sculptured in ivory, with  bas-reliefs designed from Scripture history. Such ivories were sometimes  placed in the centre of the covers, and framed in an ornamental  metal-work studded with precious stones and engraved cameos. The  barbaric magnificence of these volumes has never been surpassed; the era  of Charlemagne was the culmination of their glory. One such volume,  presented by that sovereign to the Cathedral at Treves, is enriched with  Roman ivories and decorative gems.

It has failed utterly to destroy or even minimize the  horrible scourge of its own creation.    Crime is naught but misdirected energy.  So long as every institution  of today, economic, political, social, and moral, conspires to  misdirect human energy into wrong channels; so long as most people  are out of place doing the things they hate to do, living a life they  loathe to live, crime will be inevitable, and all the laws on the  statutes can only increase, but never do away with, crime.  What does  society, as it exists today, know of the process of despair, the  poverty, the horrors, the fearful struggle the human soul must pass  on its way to crime and degradation.  Who that knows this terrible  process can fail to see the truth in these words of Peter Kropotkin:    \"Those who will hold the balance between the benefits thus attributed  to law and punishment and the degrading effect of the latter on  humanity; those who will estimate the torrent of depravity poured  abroad in human society by the informer, favored by the Judge even,  and paid for in clinking cash by governments, under the pretext of  aiding to unmask crime; those who will go within prison walls and  there see what human beings become when deprived of liberty, when  subjected to the care of brutal keepers, to coarse, cruel words, to a  thousand stinging, piercing humiliations, will agree with us that the  entire apparatus of prison and punishment is an abomination which  ought to be brought to an end.\"    The deterrent influence of law on the lazy man is too absurd to merit  consideration.  If society were only relieved of the waste and  expense of keeping a lazy class, and the equally great expense of the  paraphernalia of protection this lazy class requires, the social  tables would contain an abundance for all, including even the  occasional lazy individual.  Besides, it is well to consider that  laziness results either from special privileges, or physical and  mental abnormalities.  Our present insane system of production  fosters both, and the most astounding phenomenon is that people  should want to work at all now.  Anarchism aims to strip labor of its  deadening, dulling aspect, of its gloom and compulsion.  It aims to  make work an instrument of joy, of strength, of color, of real  harmony, so that the poorest sort of a man should find in work both  recreation and hope.    To achieve such an arrangement of life, government, with its unjust,  arbitrary, repressive measures, must be done away with.  At best it  has but imposed one single mode of life upon all, without regard to  individual and social variations and needs.  In destroying government  and statutory laws, Anarchism proposes to rescue the self-respect and  independence of the individual from all restraint and invasion by  authority.  Only in freedom can man grow to his full stature.  Only  in freedom will he learn to think and move, and give the very best in  him.  Only in freedom will he realize the true force of the social  bonds which knit men together, and which are the true foundation of a  normal social life.    But what about human nature?  Can it be changed?  And if not, will it  endure under Anarchism?    Poor human nature, what horrible crimes have been committed in thy  name!  Every fool, from king to policeman, from the flatheaded parson  to the visionless dabbler in science, presumes to speak  authoritatively of human nature.  The greater the mental charlatan,  the more definite his insistence on the wickedness and weaknesses of  human nature.  Yet, how can any one speak of it today, with every  soul in a prison, with every heart fettered, wounded, and maimed?    John Burroughs has stated that experimental study of animals in  captivity is absolutely useless.  Their character, their habits,  their appetites undergo a complete transformation when torn from  their soil in field and forest.  With human nature caged in a narrow  space, whipped daily into submission, how can we speak of its  potentialities?    Freedom, expansion, opportunity, and, above all, peace and repose,  alone can teach us the real dominant factors of human nature and all  its wonderful possibilities.    Anarchism, then, really stands for the liberation of the human mind  from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from  the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint  of government.  Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free  grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social  wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access  to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according  to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.    This is not a wild fancy or an aberration of the mind.  It is the  conclusion arrived at by hosts of intellectual men and women the  world over; a conclusion resulting from the close and studious  observation of the tendencies of modern society: individual liberty  and economic equality, the twin forces for the birth of what is fine  and true in man.    As to methods.  Anarchism is not, as some may suppose, a theory of  the future to be realized through divine inspiration.  It is a living  force in the affairs of our life, constantly creating new conditions.  The methods of Anarchism therefore do not comprise an iron-clad  program to be carried out under all circumstances.  Methods must grow  out of the economic needs of each place and clime, and of the  intellectual and temperamental requirements of the individual.  The  serene, calm character of a Tolstoy will wish different methods for  social reconstruction than the intense, overflowing personality of a  Michael Bakunin or a Peter Kropotkin.  Equally so it must be apparent  that the economic and political needs of Russia will dictate more  drastic measures than would England or America.  Anarchism does not  stand for military drill and uniformity; it does, however, stand for  the spirit of revolt, in whatever form, against everything that  hinders human growth.  All Anarchists agree in that, as they also  agree in their opposition to the political machinery as a means of  bringing about the great social change.    \"All voting,\" says Thoreau, \"is a sort of gaming, like checkers, or  backgammon, a playing with right and wrong; its obligation never  exceeds that of expediency.  Even voting for the right thing is doing  nothing for it.  A wise man will not leave the right to the mercy of  chance, nor wish it to prevail through the power of the majority.\"  A close examination of the machinery of politics and its achievements  will bear out the logic of Thoreau.    What does the history of parliamentarism show?  Nothing but failure  and defeat, not even a single reform to ameliorate the economic and  social stress of the people.  Laws have been passed and enactments  made for the improvement and protection of labor.  Thus it was proven  only last year that Illinois, with the most rigid laws for mine  protection, had the greatest mine disasters.  In States where child  labor laws prevail, child exploitation is at its highest, and though  with us the workers enjoy full political opportunities, capitalism  has reached the most brazen zenith.    Even were the workers able to have their own representatives, for  which our good Socialist politicians are clamoring, what chances are  there for their honesty and good faith?  One has but to bear in mind  the process of politics to realize that its path of good intentions  is full of pitfalls: wire-pulling, intriguing, flattering, lying,  cheating; in fact, chicanery of every description, whereby the  political aspirant can achieve success.  Added to that is a complete  demoralization of character and conviction, until nothing is left  that would make one hope for anything from such a human derelict.  Time and time again the people were foolish enough to trust, believe,  and support with their last farthing aspiring politicians, only to  find themselves betrayed and cheated.    It may be claimed that men of integrity would not become corrupt in  the political grinding mill.  Perhaps not; but such men would be  absolutely helpless to exert the slightest influence in behalf of  labor, as indeed has been shown in numerous instances.  The State is  the economic master of its servants.  Good men, if such there be,  would either remain true to their political faith and lose their  economic support, or they would cling to their economic master and be  utterly unable to do the slightest good.  The political arena leaves  one no alternative, one must either be a dunce or a rogue.    The political superstition is still holding sway over the hearts and  minds of the masses, but the true lovers of liberty will have no more  to do with it.  Instead, they believe with Stirner that man has as  much liberty as he is willing to take.  Anarchism therefore stands  for direct action, the open defiance of, and resistance to, all laws  and restrictions, economic, social, and moral.  But defiance and  resistance are illegal.  Therein lies the salvation of man.  Everything illegal necessitates integrity, self-reliance, and  courage.  In short, it calls for free, independent spirits, for \"men  who are men, and who have a bone in their backs which you cannot pass  your hand through.\"    Universal suffrage itself owes its existence to direct action.  If  not for the spirit of rebellion, of the defiance on the part of the  American revolutionary fathers, their posterity would still wear the  King's coat.  If not for the direct action of a John Brown and his  comrades, America would still trade in the flesh of the black man.  True, the trade in white flesh is still going on; but that, too, will  have to be abolished by direct action.  Trade-unionism, the economic  arena of the modern gladiator, owes its existence to direct action.  It is but recently that law and"]]]
