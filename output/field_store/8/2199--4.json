On such  occasions the preacher was not infrequently observed, without affront to  anyone, to refresh himself from behind the bar just before announcing  his text.    In 1824 commenced in Boston a temperance movement which accomplished in  this matter the most happy reform. It swept New England, passing thence  to all the other parts of the Union. By the end of 1829 over a thousand  temperance societies were in existence. The distilling and importation  of spirits fell off immensely. It became fashionable not to drink, and  little by little drinking came to be stigmatized as immoral.    By the time of which we now speak, the old habit of expressing  solicitude for the fate of the Union had passed away. Whig like  Democrat--so different from old Federalist-swore by \"the people.\" Every  American believed in America. Travelling abroad, the man from this  country was wont to assume, and if opposed to contend, ill-manneredly  sometimes, that its institutions were far the best in the world. No one  wished a change. The unparalleled prosperity of all contributed to this  satisfaction. Cities and towns came up in a day. Public improvements  were to be seen making in every direction. There was no idle aristocracy  on the one hand, no beggars on the other. Self-respect was universal.  The people held the power. If men attained great wealth, as not a few  did, they usually did not waste it but invested it. Business enterprise  was intense and common. Character entered into credit as an element  along with financial resources. People did not crowd into cities, but  loved and built up the country rather. Laws and penalties were become  more mild. In 1837 a man was flogged at the whipping-post in Providence,  R. I., for horse-stealing, perhaps the last case of the kind in the  country. Prisons were now made clean and healthy, and the idea of  reforming the criminal instead of taking vengeance upon him was  spreading. Reformatories for children had been opened in New York,  Boston, and Philadelphia. There were institutions for homeless children,  for the sick poor, for the insane, and for other unfortunate classes.    By this time the Methodists and Baptists had become extremely strong in  numbers. In 1833 the Massachusetts constitution was altered, abolishing  obligatory contributions for the support of the ministry of the standing  order. Connecticut had made the same change fifteen years before, in its  constitution of 1818. In many localities the newer denominations,  hitherto sects, were more influential than the old one, and in this  abolition of ecclesiastical taxes they had with them Jews, atheists,  deists, agnostics, and heathen.    About 1825 began a period of peculiar religious enthusiasm. Missions to  the heathen were instituted. Revivals were numerous and often shook  whole neighborhoods for weeks and months. About this date Millerism  began to make converts. William Miller, from whom it took its name,  preached far and wide that the world would be destroyed in 1843,  securing multitudes of disciples, who clung to his general belief even  after his prophecy as to the specific date for the final catastrophe was  seen to have failed. Mormonism was also founded, in 1830, and the Book  of Mormon published by Joseph Smith. A church of this order, organized  this year at Manchester, N. Y., removed the next to Kirtland, O., and  thence to Independence, Mo. Driven from here by mob violence, they built  the town of Nauvoo, Ill. Meeting in this place too with what they  regarded persecution, several of their members being prosecuted for  polygamy, they were obliged to migrate to Salt Lake City, where,  however, they were not fully settled until 1848.    As part of the same general stir we may perhaps register the  anti-masonic movement. One William Morgan, a Mason residing in Western  New York, was reported about to expose in a publication the secrets of  that order. The Masons were desirous of preventing this and made several  forcible efforts to that end. Morgan was soon missing, and the exciting  assumption was almost universally made that the Masons had taken him  off. There was much evidence of this; but conviction was found  impossible because, as was alleged, judges, juries, and witnesses were  nearly all Masons. An intense and widespread feeling was developed that  Masonry held itself superior to the laws, was therefore a foe to the  Government and must be destroyed. The Anti-Masons became a mighty  political party. Masons were driven from office. In 1832 anti-masonic  nominations were made for President and Vice-President, which had much  to do with the small vote of Clay in that year. It was this party that  brought to the front politically William H. Seward, Millard Fillmore,  and Thurlow Weed.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Thurlow Weed.

In 1833 Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania passed laws  suppressing lotteries, but the gambling mania seemed to transform itself  into a craze for banks. In many parts this was such that actual riots  took place when subscriptions to the stock of banks were opened, the  earliest comers subscribing the whole with the purpose of selling to  others at an advance. To make a bank was thought the great panacea for  every ill that could befall. In this we see that the American people,  bright as they were, could be duped.    Less wonder, then, at the success of the Moon Hoax, perpetrated in 1835.  It was generally known that Sir John Herschel had gone to the Cape of  Good Hope to erect an observatory. One day the New York Sun came out  with what purported to be part of a supplement to the Edinburgh Journal  of Science, giving an account of Herschel's remarkable discoveries. The  moon, so the bogus relation ran, had been found to be inhabited by human  beings with wings. Herschel had seen flocks of them flying about. Their  houses were triangular in form. The telescope had also revealed beavers  in the moon, exhibiting most remarkable intelligence. Pictures of some  of these and of moon scenery accompanied the article. The fraud was so  clever as to deceive learned and unlearned alike. The sham story was  continued through several issues of the Sun, and gave the paper an  enormous sale. As it arrived in the different places, crowds scrambled  for it, nor would those who failed to secure copies disperse until some  one more fortunate had read to them all that the paper said upon the  subject. Several colleges sent professorial deputations to the Sun  office to see the article, and particularly the appendices, which, it  was alleged, had been kept back. Richard Adams Locke was the author of  this ingenious deception, which was not exploded until the arrival of  authentic intelligence from Edinburgh.    Party spirit sometimes ran terribly high. A New York City election in  1834 was the occasion of a riot between men of the  two parties,  disturbances continuing several days. Political meetings were broken up,  and the militia had to be called out to enforce order. Citizens armed  themselves, fearing attacks upon banks and business houses. When it was  found that the Whigs were triumphant in the city, deafening salutes were  fired. Philadelphia Whigs celebrated this victory with a grand barbecue,  attended, it was estimated, by fifty thousand people. The death of  Harrison was malignantly ascribed to overeating in Washington, after his  long experience with insufficient diet in the West. Whigs exulted over  Jackson's cabinet difficulties. Jackson's \"Kitchen Cabinet,\" the power  behind the throne, gave umbrage to his official advisers. Duff Green,  editor of the United States Telegraph, the President's \"organ,\" was one  member; Isaac Hill, of New Hampshire, and Amos Kendall, first of  Massachusetts, then of Kentucky, were others, these three the most  influential. All had long worked, written, and cheered for Old Hickory.  In return he gave them good places at Washington, and now they enjoyed  dropping in at the White House to take a smoke with the grizzly hero and  help him curse the opposition as foes of \"the people.\"    Major Eaton, Old Hickory's first Secretary of War, had married a  beautiful widow, maiden name Peggy O'Neil, of common birth, and much  gossipped about. The female members of other cabinet families refused to  associate with her, the Vice-President's wife leading. Jackson took up  Mrs. Eaton's cause with all knightly zeal. He berated her traducers and  persecutors in long and fierce personal letters. His niece and  housekeeper, Mrs. Donelson, one of the anti-Eatonites, he turned out of  the White House, with her husband, his private secretary. The breach was  serious anyway, and might have been far more so but for the healing  offices of Van Buren, who used all his courtliness and power of place to  help the President bring about the social recognition of Mrs. Eaton. He  called upon her, made parties in her honor, and secured her entree to  the families of the greatest foreign ministers. Mrs. Eaton triumphed,  but the scandal would not down.    When Jackson wrote his foreign message upon the French spoliation  claims, his cabinet were aghast and begged him to soften its tone. Upon  his refusal, it is said, they stole to the printing-office and did it  themselves. But the proofs came back for Jackson's perusal. The lad who  brought them was the late Mr. J. S. Ham, of Providence, R. I. He used to  say that he had never known what profane swearing was till he listened  to General Jackson's comments as those proofs were read.    Jackson and Quincy Adams were personal as well as political foes. When  the President visited Boston, Harvard College bestowed on him the degree  of Doctor of Laws. Adams, one of the overseers, opposed this with all  his might. As \"an affectionate child of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23755"],[0,"Birds of the Indian Hills (#10)"],[1,"are those of the common green  parrot: its cries, however, are less harsh, and it is less  aggressively bold. The pretty little western blossom-headed paroquet  (_P. cyanocephalus_) ascends the hills to a height of some 5000 feet.  It is recognisable by the fact that the head of the cock is red, tinged  with blue like the bloom on a plum.      THE STRIGIDAE OR OWL FAMILY    We now come to those much-abused birds--the owls. The Himalayas, in  common with most other parts of the world, are well stocked with these  pirates of the night. The vast majority of owls, being strictly  nocturnal, escape observation. Usually the presence of any species  of owl in a locality is made known only by its voice. I may here remark  that diurnal birds know as little about nocturnal birds as the man  in the street does, hence the savage manner in which they mob any  luckless owl that happens to be abroad in the daytime. Birds are  intensely conservative; they resent strongly what they regard as an  addition to the local avifauna. This assertion may be proved by  setting free a cockatoo in the plains of India. Before the bird has  been at large for ten minutes it will be surrounded by a mob of reviling  crows.    The collared pigmy owlet (_Glaucidium brodiei_) is perhaps the  commonest owl in the Himalayas: at any rate, it is the species that  makes itself heard most often. Those who sit out of doors after dinner  cannot fail to have remarked a soft low whistle heard at regular  intervals of about thirty seconds. That is the call of the pigmy  collared owlet. The owlet itself is a tiny creature, about the size  of a sparrow. Like several other little owls, it sometimes shows  itself during the daytime. Once at Mussoorie I noticed a pigmy  collared owlet sitting as bold as brass on a conspicuous branch about  midday and making grimaces at me. The other species likely to be heard  at hill stations are the brown wood-owl (_Syrnium indrani_), the call  of which has been syllabised _to-whoo_, and the little spotted  Himalayan scops owl (_Scops spilocephalus_), of which the note is  double whistle _who-who_.      THE VULTURIDAE OR VULTURE FAMILY    From the owls to the diurnal birds of prey it is but a short step.  Next to the warblers, the raptores are the most difficult birds to  distinguish one from the other. Nearly all of them are creatures of  mottled-brown plumage, and, as the plumage changes with the period  of life, it is impossible to differentiate them by descriptions of  their colouring.    The vultures are perhaps the ugliest of all birds. Most of them have  the head devoid of feathers, and they are thus enabled to bury this  member in their loathsome food without soiling their feathers. In  the air, owing to the magnificent ease with which they fly, they are  splendid objects. Their habit is to rise high above the earth and  hang motionless in the atmosphere on outstretched wings, or sail in  circles without any perceptible motion of the pinions. Vultures are  not the only raptorial birds that do this. Kites are almost equally  skilled. But kites are distinguished by having a fairly long tail,  that of vultures being short and wedge shaped. The sides of the wings  of the vultures are straight, and the wings stand out at right angles  to the body. In all species, except the scavenger vulture, the tips  of the wings are turned up as the birds float or sail in the air,  and the ends of the wings are much cut up, looking like fingers.    Perhaps the commonest vulture of the Himalayas is that very familiar  fowl--the small white scavenger vulture (_Neophron ginginianus_),  often called Pharaoh's chicken and other opprobrious names that I  will not mention. This bird eats everything that is filthy and unclean.  The natural consequence is that it looks untidy and disreputable.  It is, without exception, the ugliest bird in the world. It is about  the size of a kite. The plumage is a dirty white, except the edges  of the wing feathers, which are shabby black. The naked face is of  a pale mustard colour, as are the bill and legs. The feathers on the  back of the head project like the back hairs of an untidy schoolboy.  Its walk is an ungainly waddle. Nevertheless--so great is the magic  of wings--this bird, as it soars high above the earth, looks a noble  fowl; it then appears to be snow-white with black margins to the wings.    Another vulture frequently met with is the Indian white-backed  vulture (_Pseudogyps bengalensis_). The plumage of this species is  a very dark grey, almost black. The naked head is rather lighter than  the rest of the body. The lower back is white: this makes the bird  easy to identify when it is perched. It has some white in the wings,  and this, during flight, is visible as a very broad band that runs  from the body nearly to the tip of the wing. Thus the wing from below  appears to be white with broad black edges. During flight this species  may be distinguished from the last by the fingered tips of its wings,  by both edges of the wing being black and the body being dark instead  of white.    The third common vulture is the Himalayan griffon (_Gyps  himalayensis_). This is distinguishable from the two species already  described by having no white in the wings.    The lammergeyer or bearded vulture (_Gypaetus barbatus_) is the king  of the vultures. Some ornithologists classify it with the eagles.  It is a connecting link between the two families. It is 4 feet in  length and is known to the hillmen as the Argul.    During flight it may be recognised by the whitish head and nape, the  pale brown lower plumage and the dark rounded tail.    Usually it keeps to rocky hills and mountains, over which it beats  with a steady, sailing, vulturine flight. Numerous stories are told  of its swooping down and carrying off young children, lambs, goats,  and other small animals. Those who will may believe these stories.  I do not. The lammergeyer is quite content to make a meal of offal,  old bones, or other refuse.      THE FALCONIDAE OR FAMILY OF BIRDS OF PREY    First and foremost of the Falconidae are the eagles. Let me preface  what little I have to say about these birds with the remark that I  am unable to set forth any characteristics whereby a novice may  recognise an eagle when he sees one on the wing. The reader should  disabuse his mind of the idea he may have obtained from the writings  of the poets of the grandeur of the eagle. Eagles may be, and doubtless  often are, mistaken for kites. They are simply rather large falcons.  They are mostly coloured very like the kite.    All true eagles have the leg feathered to the toe. I give this method  of diagnosis for what it is worth, and that is, I fear, not very much,  because eagles as a rule do not willingly afford the observer an  opportunity of inspecting their tarsi.    The eagles most commonly seen in the Himalayas are the imperial eagle  (_Aquila helica_), the booted eagle (_Hieraetus pennatus_),  Bonelli's eagle (_Hieraetus fasciatus_), the changeable hawk-eagle  (_Spizaetus limnaetus_), and Hodgson's hawk-eagle (_Spizaetus  nepalensis_).    The imperial eagle has perhaps the darkest plumage of all the eagles.  This species does not live up to its name. It feeds largely on carrion,  and probably never catches anything larger than a rat. The imperial  eagle is common about Mussoorie except in the rains. Captain Hutton  states that he has seen as many as fifty of them together in the month  of October when they reassemble after the monsoon.    The booted eagle has a very shrill call. Its lower parts are pale  in hue.    Bonelli's eagle is fairly common both at Naini Tal and Mussoorie.  It is a fine bird, and has plenty of courage. It often stoops to fowls  and is destructive to game birds. It is of slighter build than the  two eagles above described. Its lower parts are white.    The changeable hawk-eagle is also a fine bird. It is very addicted  to peafowl. The hillmen call it the _Mohrhaita_, which, being  interpreted, is the peacock-killer. It utters a loud cry, which  Thompson renders _whee-whick_, _whee-whick_. This call is uttered  by the bird both when on the wing and at rest. Another cry of this  species has been syllabised _toot_, _toot_, _toot_, _toot-twee_.    Hodgson's hawk-eagle is also destructive to game. It emits a shrill  musical whistle which can sometimes be heard when the bird is so high  as to appear a mere speck against the sky. This species has a narrow  crest.    Allied to the true eagles are the serpent-eagles. In these the leg  is not feathered to the toe, so they may be said to form a link between  the true eagles and the falcons.    One species--the crested serpent-eagle (_Spilornis cheela_)--is  common in the Himalayas up to 8000 feet.    This eagle is perhaps the most handsome of the birds of prey. The  crest is large and imposing. The upper parts are dark brown, almost  black, with a purple or green gloss. The breast and under parts are  rich deep brown profusely dotted with white ocelli. On the tail and  wings are white bars. The wing bars are very conspicuous during flight.  The crested serpent-eagle flies with the wings held very far back,  so that it looks, as \"Exile\" says, like a large butterfly. When flying  it constantly utters its shrill, plaintive call composed of two short  sharp cries and three prolonged notes, the latter being in a slightly  higher key.    Of the remaining birds of prey perhaps only two can fairly be numbered  among the common birds of the Himalayas, and both of these are easy  to recognise. They are the kite and the kestrel.    The common pariah kite (_Milvus govinda_) is the most familiar  raptorial bird in India. Hundreds of kites dwell at every hill-station.  They spend the greater part of the day on the wing, either sailing  gracefully in circles high overhead or gliding on outstretched  pinions over mountain and valley, with head pointing downwards,  looking for the refuse on which "]]]
