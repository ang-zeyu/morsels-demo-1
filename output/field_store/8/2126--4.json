All are saying, \"No bird is so poor as the crow; he is  always hungry. Next summer, let us plant and raise a big crop of corn,  and gather and save it for the winter. Next winter, crows will not be  hungry; they will have food.    \"We will no longer take from the fields of the Red Children just enough  corn for a meal to-day. We will raise our own corn, and lay by a store  for the winter.\"    And having agreed that this is a wise plan, the council ends.    A few days later, another council will be called. At this, the crows  will plan how and where to plant the corn. Some will be appointed to  select a field, others to find seed, and still others to plant and tend  the corn.    But, alas! When spring comes, and skies are blue, and the sun shines  warm, the crows forget the hunger of the winter, and the councils in the  tree. They remember only that the skies are blue, and the sun shines  warm, and now there is plenty of corn.    Happy and content, they walk up and down the fields of the Red Children.    \"We have all we want to-day,\" they say, \"Why should we think of  to-morrow, or next winter? We had a good meal this morning, and we are  sure of one to-night. Is not this enough for a crow? What more can he  ask?\"    And the next winter comes, and finds the crows as poor and as hungry as  they were the last. Again they are holding noisy councils in the council  tree. Again they are laying plans for the great crop of corn that they  will raise next summer!    [Illustration]          WHY THE INDIAN LOVES HIS DOG      The dog is the Indian's best friend. He is the comrade by day and the  protector by night. As long as the Indian's dog has strength, he will  fight for his friend.    The Indian says this is how the dog came to take his part.    An Indian and his dogs went into the woods to hunt. It was in the days  when dogs and men could talk together, and each understood the language  of the other.    When they reached the woods, the dogs began to talk with the Indian.  They told him many wonderful things about the woods, which he did not  know. They taught him many tricks of the chase: how to scent and track  the game, and where to look for trails.    [Illustration]    The man listened to what the dogs said, and he did as they told him.  Soon the sledge which the dogs had drawn to the woods was piled high  with deer and other game.    Never had the Indian's arrows brought him so much game. Never had he met  with such success in hunting. He was so pleased that he said to the  dogs, \"Always shall I talk with you, give ear to what you say, and be  one of you.\"    \"Ah, but listen!\" said the dogs. \"If you wish to be one of us, you must  live under the law of dogs, not men. Animals have laws different from  those of men. When two dogs meet for the first time, they try their  strength to see which is the better dog.    \"Men do not fight when strangers meet, they shake hands. As we fight  strange dogs, so you, too, must fight strange men, to see which is the  best man,--if you are to live under the law of dogs.\"    The man said he would think it over, and at sunrise give his answer.  Indians always sleep before deciding a question.    Next morning, the man said he would live under the law of animals, and  fight strange men.    The following day, the man made ready to leave the woods. From the  basswood, he made a strong harness for the dogs, so that they could draw  the load of game back to the camp for him.    [Illustration]    When the sun was high, the man and the dogs started with the sledge  load of game. They had not gone far before they saw two strange Indians  coming.    \"Now,\" said the dogs to the man, \"remember you are living under the  dog's law. You must fight these strange men.\"    The man attacked first one Indian and then the other. At last both  turned on him, and when they left him, he was nearly dead. At this, the  dogs took a hand. They leaped upon the Indians and drove them from the  woods. Then they came back to where their friend lay on the ground, and  began to talk with him and lick his face.    The man could not speak for some time, but when his voice came to him,  he said to the dogs, \"No longer do I wish to live under the law of  animals. No more shall I fight strangers. From this time, I shall shake  hands with strangers, and bid them welcome. From this time, I shall be a  man and live under the law of men.\"    \"Then,\" said the dogs sadly, \"we shall no longer be able to talk with  you, and tell you the things that we know. But we will always stand by  you. We will be your friends and will fight for you, when you need us as  you did to-day.\"    This is why the Indian and his dog are now unable to speak each other's  language. This is also why an Indian's dog will fight to the death for  his friend.    Not only is the dog a true friend to the Indian in this world, but in  the next as well. It seems that the soul of an Indian on its journey to  the Happy Hunting Ground must cross a deep, swift-running stream. On  either side of this dark river, there stand two dogs who hold in their  teeth a great log upon which the souls pass.    The soul of the Indian who has been kind to his dog crosses the log  easily, for the dogs stand guard. As the soul of such an Indian reaches  the river, they say, \"This Indian was kind to his dog. He gave him of  his own food, and the dog always had a warm place by his fire. We will  help this Indian to cross.\"    Then the dogs grip the log firmly in their teeth, and hold it steady  while the soul of the kind Indian passes over.    But if the soul of an Indian who has been unkind to his dog comes to the  river, the dogs say, \"This man was cruel to his dog. He gave his dog no  place by the fire, he beat him, he let him go hungry. This man shall not  cross.\"    Then the dogs grip the log lightly in their teeth, and when the soul of  the unkind Indian is half way across, they turn it quickly to one side,  and the soul is thrown into the deep, dark river.    Many an Indian has been kind to his dog, that he might make sure of a  safe crossing on that log.          GREEDY FAWN AND THE PORRIDGE      [Illustration]    In the days when there was no one living in this country but the  Indians, there were no houses; there were only Indian wigwams. There  were no roads and no streets, but Indian trails.    At that time there grew a wonderful chestnut, which the Indians used in  their cooking. A very small bit of this chestnut grated into a kettle  would make a potful of porridge.    [Illustration]    In a certain wigwam lived Deerheart and Sky Elk, and their little son  Greedy Fawn. The mother was called Deerheart because she was so loving,  and gentle, and kind. The father was named Sky Elk because he was so  strong and fleet of foot. Greedy Fawn, too, came rightly by his name.  You will soon know why.    One day, Deerheart and Sky Elk went on a long trail. As they left the  wigwam, they said to Greedy Fawn, \"Do not touch the chestnut, do not  build a fire, while we are away.\"    Greedy Fawn promised. He watched his father and mother disappear down  the western trail. Then he went back to the wigwam.    \"Now,\" thought he, \"I will have all the porridge I want.\"    So he ran and gathered some sticks. He built a fire with the sticks.  Then he hung the kettle over the fire, and put some water in it. Then he  found the chestnut. He grated a little of the chestnut into the kettle,  and began to stir. Then he grated some more, and some more, and some  more.    Faster and faster Greedy Fawn stirred the boiling porridge, for it began  to swell and fill the kettle.    Larger and larger, it grew, and it grew, and it grew.    Greedy Fawn was so frightened he did not know what to do.    \"Oh, will it never stop swelling?\" he thought. Harder and harder he  stirred to keep the porridge from boiling over. Beads of perspiration  ran down his little bronze face, yet still he stirred. He dared not  stop.    Then he remembered that sometimes his mother would rap the kettle with  the porridge stick, if it became too full.    Rap, rap, rap, went the porridge stick on the edge of the kettle.  Instantly the _kettle_ began to swell. Larger, and larger, and larger it  grew. Greedy Fawn was so frightened he did not know what to do.    Now Greedy Fawn could not reach across the kettle, to stir the porridge  with his stick, so he began to run around it. And around, and around,  and around the kettle he ran, stirring, and stirring, and stirring.    At last the kettle was so large that it nearly filled the wigwam. There  was just space enough left for Greedy Fawn to run around it. And around,  and around, and around the kettle he ran, stirring, and stirring, and  stirring.    Oh, how his little arms ached! And, oh, how tired his small legs were!  But still he ran. He dared not stop.    Here was porridge enough to last a small boy a lifetime, and he could  not stop to taste one mouthful!    [Illustration]    At last Greedy Fawn could run no longer. He stumbled and fell by the  side of the kettle. He was too weak to rise. The stick fell from his  hand, and the porridge boiled on. Higher, and higher, and higher it  rose, until it ran over and down the sides of the kettle. Closer, and  closer the boiling porridge crept to the little Indian boy, and soon  Greedy Fawn and his stick were nearly buried in porridge.    For once Greedy Fawn had all the porridge he wanted. And never again  would he have wanted anything, had not Deerheart and Sky Elk heard his  cries, and come running like deer up the trail to save him.    [Illustration]          WHY HOUNDS OUTRUN OTHER ANIMALS      A hound was chasing a hare through the woods.    Some wolves and panthers were chasing a bull that had been feeding in  the valley near the woods. For some time they had been trying to run him  down, but they did not seem to gain on him.

I think it will  be of the greatest assistance in producing the witness whom I require.  Thank you very much. I believe you have some matches in your pocket,  Watson. Now, Mr. Lestrade, I will ask you all to accompany me to the top  landing.\"    As I have said, there was a broad corridor there, which ran outside  three empty bedrooms. At one end of the corridor we were all marshalled  by Sherlock Holmes, the constables grinning and Lestrade staring at  my friend with amazement, expectation, and derision chasing each other  across his features. Holmes stood before us with the air of a conjurer  who is performing a trick.    \"Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water?  Put the straw on the floor here, free from the wall on either side. Now  I think that we are all ready.\"    Lestrade's face had begun to grow red and angry.    \"I don't know whether you are playing a game with us, Mr. Sherlock  Holmes,\" said he. \"If you know anything, you can surely say it without  all this tomfoolery.\"    \"I assure you, my good Lestrade, that I have an excellent reason for  everything that I do. You may possibly remember that you chaffed me a  little some hours ago, when the sun seemed on your side of the hedge, so  you must not grudge me a little pomp and ceremony now. Might I ask you,  Watson, to open that window, and then to put a match to the edge of the  straw?\"    I did so, and, driven by the draught, a coil of grey smoke swirled down  the corridor, while the dry straw crackled and flamed.    \"Now we must see if we can find this witness for you, Lestrade. Might I  ask you all to join in the cry of 'Fire!'? Now, then; one, two, three--\"    \"Fire!\" we all yelled.    \"Thank you. I will trouble you once again.\"    \"Fire!\"    \"Just once more, gentlemen, and all together.\"    \"Fire!\" The shout must have rung over Norwood.    It had hardly died away when an amazing thing happened. A door suddenly  flew open out of what appeared to be solid wall at the end of the  corridor, and a little, wizened man darted out of it, like a rabbit out  of its burrow.    \"Capital!\" said Holmes, calmly. \"Watson, a bucket of water over the  straw. That will do! Lestrade, allow me to present you with your  principal missing witness, Mr. Jonas Oldacre.\"    The detective stared at the new-comer with blank amazement. The latter  was blinking in the bright light of the corridor, and peering at us  and at the smouldering fire. It was an odious face--crafty, vicious,  malignant, with shifty, light-grey eyes and white eyelashes.    \"What's this, then?\" said Lestrade at last. \"What have you been doing  all this time, eh?\"    Oldacre gave an uneasy laugh, shrinking back from the furious red face  of the angry detective.    \"I have done no harm.\"    \"No harm? You have done your best to get an innocent man hanged. If it  wasn't for this gentleman here, I am not sure that you would not have  succeeded.\"    The wretched creature began to whimper.    \"I am sure, sir, it was only my practical joke.\"    \"Oh! a joke, was it? You won't find the laugh on your side, I promise  you. Take him down and keep him in the sitting-room until I come. Mr.  Holmes,\" he continued, when they had gone, \"I could not speak before the  constables, but I don't mind saying, in the presence of Dr. Watson,  that this is the brightest thing that you have done yet, though it is a  mystery to me how you did it. You have saved an innocent man's life,  and you have prevented a very grave scandal, which would have ruined my  reputation in the Force.\"    Holmes smiled and clapped Lestrade upon the shoulder.    \"Instead of being ruined, my good sir, you will find that your  reputation has been enormously enhanced. Just make a few alterations in  that report which you were writing, and they will understand how hard it  is to throw dust in the eyes of Inspector Lestrade.\"    \"And you don't want your name to appear?\"    \"Not at all. The work is its own reward. Perhaps I shall get the credit  also at some distant day when I permit my zealous historian to lay out  his foolscap once more--eh, Watson? Well, now, let us see where this rat  has been lurking.\"    A lath-and-plaster partition had been run across the passage six feet  from the end, with a door cunningly concealed in it. It was lit within  by slits under the eaves. A few articles of furniture and a supply of  food and water were within, together with a number of books and papers.    \"There's the advantage of being a builder,\" said Holmes, as we came  out. \"He was able to fix up his own little hiding-place without any  confederate--save, of course, that precious housekeeper of his, whom I  should lose no time in adding to your bag, Lestrade.\"    \"I'll take your advice. But how did you know of this place, Mr. Holmes?\"    \"I made up my mind that the fellow was in hiding in the house. When I  paced one corridor and found it six feet shorter than the corresponding  one below, it was pretty clear where he was. I thought he had not the  nerve to lie quiet before an alarm of fire. We could, of course, have  gone in and taken him, but it amused me to make him reveal himself;  besides, I owed you a little mystification, Lestrade, for your chaff in  the morning.\"    \"Well, sir, you certainly got equal with me on that. But how in the  world did you know that he was in the house at all?\"    \"The thumb-mark, Lestrade. You said it was final; and so it was, in a  very different sense. I knew it had not been there the day before. I pay  a good deal of attention to matters of detail, as you may have observed,  and I had examined the hall and was sure that the wall was clear.  Therefore, it had been put on during the night.\"    \"But how?\"    \"Very simply. When those packets were sealed up, Jonas Oldacre got  McFarlane to secure one of the seals by putting his thumb upon the soft  wax. It would be done so quickly and so naturally that I dare say the  young man himself has no recollection of it. Very likely it just so  happened, and Oldacre had himself no notion of the use he would put it  to. Brooding over the case in that den of his, it suddenly struck him  what absolutely damning evidence he could make against McFarlane by  using that thumb-mark. It was the simplest thing in the world for him to  take a wax impression from the seal, to moisten it in as much blood as  he could get from a pin-prick, and to put the mark upon the wall during  the night, either with his own hand or with that of his housekeeper.  If you examine among those documents which he took with him into  his retreat I will lay you a wager that you find the seal with the  thumb-mark upon it.\"    \"Wonderful!\" said Lestrade. \"Wonderful! It's all as clear as crystal, as  you put it. But what is the object of this deep deception, Mr. Holmes?\"    It was amusing to me to see how the detective's overbearing manner had  changed suddenly to that of a child asking questions of its teacher.    \"Well, I don't think that is very hard to explain. A very deep,  malicious, vindictive person is the gentleman who is now awaiting us  downstairs. You know that he was once refused by McFarlane's mother?  You don't! I told you that you should go to Blackheath first and Norwood  afterwards. Well, this injury, as he would consider it, has rankled  in his wicked, scheming brain, and all his life he has longed for  vengeance, but never seen his chance. During the last year or two things  have gone against him--secret speculation, I think--and he finds himself  in a bad way. He determines to swindle his creditors, and for this  purpose he pays large cheques to a certain Mr. Cornelius, who is, I  imagine, himself under another name. I have not traced these cheques  yet, but I have no doubt that they were banked under that name at some  provincial town where Oldacre from time to time led a double existence.  He intended to change his name altogether, draw this money, and vanish,  starting life again elsewhere.\"    \"Well, that's likely enough.\"    \"It would strike him that in disappearing he might throw all pursuit off  his track, and at the same time have an ample and crushing revenge upon  his old sweetheart, if he could give the impression that he had been  murdered by her only child. It was a masterpiece of villainy, and he  carried it out like a master. The idea of the will, which would give  an obvious motive for the crime, the secret visit unknown to his own  parents, the retention of the stick, the blood, and the animal remains  and buttons in the wood-pile, all were admirable. It was a net from  which it seemed to me a few hours ago that there was no possible escape.  But he had not that supreme gift of the artist, the knowledge of when to  stop. He wished to improve that which was already perfect--to draw the  rope tighter yet round the neck of his unfortunate victim--and so  he ruined all. Let us descend, Lestrade. There are just one or two  questions that I would ask him.\"    The malignant creature was seated in his own parlour with a policeman  upon each side of him.    \"It was a joke, my good sir, a practical joke, nothing more,\" he whined  incessantly. \"I assure you, sir, that I simply concealed myself in order  to see the effect of my disappearance, and I am sure that you would not  be so unjust as to imagine that I would have allowed any harm to befall  poor young Mr. McFarlane.\"    \"That's for a jury to decide,\" said Lestrade. \"Anyhow, we shall have you  on a charge of conspiracy, if not for attempted murder.\"    \"And"]]]
