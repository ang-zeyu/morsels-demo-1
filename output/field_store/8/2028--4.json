For some seconds after this I sat still, hardly daring  to breathe, and pretending to be extremely angry with myself for being  such a fool. With a stupendous effort I turned my attention to the  most material of things. One of the skirt buttons on my hip--they were  much in vogue then--being loose, I endeavoured to occupy myself in  tightening it, and when I could no longer derive any employment from  that, I set to work on my shoes, and tied knots in the laces, merely  to enjoy the task of untying them. But this, too, ceasing at last to  attract me, I was desperately racking my mind for some other device,  when there came again the queer, booming noise I had heard before, but  which I could now no longer doubt was the report of firearms. I looked  in the direction of the sound--and--my heart almost stopped. Racing  towards me--as if not merely for his life, but his soul--came the  figure of a Highlander. The wind rustling through his long dishevelled  hair, blew it completely over his forehead, narrowly missing his eyes,  which were fixed ahead of him in a ghastly, agonised stare. He had not  a vestige of colour, and, in the powerful glow of the moonbeams, his  skin shone livid. He ran with huge bounds, and, what added to my  terror and made me double aware he was nothing mortal, was that each  time his feet struck the hard, smooth road, upon which I could well  see there was no sign of a stone, there came the sound, the  unmistakable sound of the scattering of gravel. On, on he came, with  cyclonic swiftness; his bare sweating elbows pressed into his panting  sides; his great, dirty, coarse, hairy fists screwed up in bony  bunches in front of him; the foam-flakes thick on his clenched,  grinning lips; the blood-drops oozing down his sweating thighs. It was  all real, infernally, hideously real, even to the most minute details:  the flying up and down of his kilt, sporan, and swordless scabbard;  the bursting of the seam of his coat, near the shoulder; and the  absence of one of his clumsy shoe-buckles. I tried hard to shut my  eyes, but was compelled to keep them open, and follow his every  movement as, darting past me, he left the roadway, and, leaping  several of the smaller obstacles that barred his way, finally  disappeared behind some of the bigger boulders. I then heard the loud  rat-tat of drums, accompanied by the shrill voices of fifes and  flutes, and at the farther end of the Pass, their arms glittering  brightly in the silvery moonbeams, appeared a regiment of scarlet-clad  soldiers. At the head rode a mounted officer, after him came the  band, and then, four abreast, a long line of warriors; in their centre  two ensigns, and on their flanks, officers and non-commissioned  officers with swords and pikes; more mounted men bringing up the rear.  On they came, the fifes and flutes ringing out with a weird clearness  in the hushed mountain air. I could hear the ground vibrate, the  gravel crunch and scatter, as they steadily and mechanically  advanced--tall men, enormously tall men, with set, white faces and  livid eyes. Every instant I expected they would see me, and I became  sick with terror at the thought of meeting all those pale, flashing  eyes. But from this I was happily saved; no one appeared to notice me,  and they all passed me by without as much as a twist or turn of the  head, their feet keeping time to one everlasting and monotonous tramp,  tramp, tramp. I got up and watched until the last of them had turned  the bend of the Pass, and the sheen of his weapons and trappings could  no longer be seen; then I remounted my boulder and wondered if  anything further would happen. It was now half-past two, and blended  with the moonbeams was a peculiar whiteness, which rendered the whole  aspect of my surroundings indescribably dreary and ghostly. Feeling  cold and hungry, I set to work on my beef sandwiches, and was  religiously separating the fat from the lean, for I am one of those  foolish people who detest fat, when a loud rustling made me look up.  Confronting me, on the opposite side of the road, was a tree, an ash,  and to my surprise, despite the fact that the breeze had fallen and  there was scarcely a breath of wind, the tree swayed violently to and  fro, whilst there proceeded from it the most dreadful moanings and  groanings. I was so terrified that I caught hold of my bicycle and  tried to mount, but I was obliged to desist as I had not a particle of  strength in my limbs. Then to assure myself the moving of the tree was  not an illusion, I rubbed my eyes, pinched myself, called aloud; but  it made no difference--the rustling, bending, and tossing still  continued. Summing up courage, I stepped into the road to get a closer  view, when to my horror my feet kicked against something, and, on  looking down, I perceived the body of an English soldier, with a  ghastly wound in his chest. I gazed around, and there, on all sides of  me, from one end of the valley to the other, lay dozens of  bodies,--bodies of men and horses,--Highlanders and English,  white-cheeked, lurid eyes, and bloody-browed,--a hotch-potch of livid,  gory awfulness. Here was the writhing, wriggling figure of an officer  with half his face shot away; and there, a horse with no head; and  there--but I cannot dwell on such horrors, the very memory of which  makes me feel sick and faint. The air, that beautiful, fresh mountain  air, resounded with their moanings and groanings, and reeked with the  smell of their blood. As I stood rooted to the ground with horror, not  knowing which way to look or turn, I suddenly saw drop from the ash,  the form of a woman, a Highland girl, with bold, handsome features,  raven black hair, and the whitest of arms and feet. In one hand she  carried a wicker basket, in the other a knife, a broad-bladed,  sharp-edged, horn-handled knife. A gleam of avarice and cruelty came  into her large dark eyes, as, wandering around her, they rested on the  rich facings of the English officers' uniforms. I knew what was in  her mind, and--forgetting she was but a ghost--that they were all  ghosts--I moved heaven and earth to stop her. I could not. Making  straight for a wounded officer that lay moaning piteously on the  ground, some ten feet away from me, she spurned with her slender,  graceful feet, the bodies of the dead and dying English that came in  her way. Then, snatching the officer's sword and pistol from him, she  knelt down, and, with a look of devilish glee in her glorious eyes,  calmly plunged her knife into his heart, working the blade backwards  and forwards to assure herself she had made a thorough job of it.  Anything more hellish I could not have imagined, and yet it fascinated  me--the girl was so fair, so wickedly fair and shapely. Her act of  cruelty over, she spoiled her victim of his rings, epaulets, buttons  and gold lacing, and, having placed them in her basket, proceeded  elsewhere. In some cases, unable to remove the rings easily, she  chopped off the fingers, and popped them, just as they were, into her  basket. Neither was her mode of dispatch always the same, for while  she put some men out of their misery in the manner I have described,  she cut the throats of others with as great a nonchalance as if she  had been killing fowls, whilst others again she settled with the  butt-ends of their guns or pistols. In all she murdered a full  half-score, and was decamping with her booty when her gloating eyes  suddenly encountered mine, and with a shrill scream of rage she rushed  towards me. I was an easy victim, for strain and pray how I would, I  could not move an inch. Raising her flashing blade high over her head,  an expression of fiendish glee in her staring eyes, she made ready to  strike me. This was the climax, my overstrained nerves could stand no  more, and ere the blow had time to descend, I pitched heavily forward  and fell at her feet. When I recovered, every phantom had vanished,  and the Pass glowed with all the cheerful freshness of the early  morning sun. Not a whit the worse for my venture, I cycled swiftly  home, and ate as only one can eat who has spent the night amid the  banks and braes of bonnie Scotland.                                   CASE VII        \"PEARLIN' JEAN\" OF ALLANBANK      Few ghosts have obtained more notoriety than \"Pearlin' Jean,\" the  phantasm which for many years haunted Allanbank, a seat of the  Stuarts.    The popular theory as to the identity of the apparition is as  follows:--    Mr. Stuart, afterwards created first baronet of Allanbank, when on a  tour in France, met a young and beautiful French Sister of Charity of  the name of Jean, whom he induced to leave her convent. Tiring of her  at length, Mr. Stuart brutally left her, and, returning abruptly to  Scotland, became engaged to be married to a lady of his own  nationality and position in life. But Jean was determined he should  not escape her so easily. For him she had sacrificed everything: her  old vocation in life was gone, she had no home, no honour,--nothing,  so she resolved to leave no stone unturned to discover his  whereabouts. At last her perseverance was rewarded, and, Fortune  favouring her, she arrived without mishap at Allanbank.    The truth was then revealed to her: her cruel and faithless lover was  about to be wedded to another. But despair gave her energy, and,  burning with indignation, she hastened to his house to upbraid him.  She reached the spot just as he was driving out with his fiancee. With  a cry of anguish, Jean rushed forward and, swinging herself nimbly on  to the fore-wheel of the coach, turned her white and passionate face  towards its occupants. For a moment, Mr. Stuart was too dumbfounded to  do anything; he could scarcely believe his senses. Who on earth was  this frantic female? Good Heavens! Jean! Impossible! How on earth had  she got there? And the tumultuous beating of his guilty heart turned  him sick "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2005"],[0,"Piccadilly Jim (#10)"],[1,"rprise. She waved her hand graciously--in the manner  of the Duchess of Axminster, a supreme hand-waver--to indicate  that she was all attention.    \"Your step-son, James Crocker,\" repeated Mrs. Pett. \"What is it  the New York papers call him, Peter?\"    Mr. Pett, the human opossum, came to life. He had contrived to  create about himself such a defensive atmosphere of non-existence  that now that he re-entered the conversation it was as if a  corpse had popped out of its tomb like a jack-in-the-box.    Obeying the voice of authority, he pushed the tombstone to one  side and poked his head out of the sepulchre.    \"Piccadilly Jim!\" he murmured apologetically.    \"Piccadilly Jim!\" said Mrs. Crocker. \"It is extremely impertinent  of them!\"    In spite of his misery, a wan smile appeared on Mr. Pett's  death-mask at this remark.    \"They should worry about--!\"    \"Peter!\"    Mr. Pett died again, greatly respected.    \"Why should the New York papers refer to James at all?\" said Mrs.  Crocker.    \"Explain, Peter!\"    Mr. Pett emerged reluctantly from the cerements. He had supposed  that Nesta would do the talking.    \"Well, he's a news-item.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Well, here's a boy that's been a regular fellow--raised in  America--done work on a newspaper--suddenly taken off to England  to become a London dude--mixing with all the dukes, playing  pinochle with the King--naturally they're interested in him.\"    A more agreeable expression came over Mrs. Crocker's face.    \"Of course, that is quite true. One cannot prevent the papers  from printing what they wish. So they have published articles  about James' doings in English Society?\"    \"Doings,\" said Mr. Pett, \"is right!\"    \"Something has got to be done about it,\" said Mrs. Pett.    Mr. Pett endorsed this.    \"Nesta's going to lose her health if these stories go on,\" he  said.    Mrs. Crocker raised her eyebrows, but she had hard work to keep a  contented smile off her face.    \"If you are not above petty jealousy, Nesta . . .\"    Mrs. Pett laughed a sharp, metallic laugh.    \"It is the disgrace I object to!\"    \"The disgrace!\"    \"What else would you call it, Eugenia? Wouldn't you be ashamed if  you opened your Sunday paper and came upon a full page article  about your nephew having got intoxicated at the races and fought  a book-maker--having broken up a political meeting--having been  sued for breach-of-promise by a barmaid . . .\"    Mrs. Crocker preserved her well-bred calm, but she was shaken.  The episodes to which her sister had alluded were ancient  history, horrors of the long-dead past, but it seemed that they  still lived in print. There and then she registered the resolve  to talk to her step-son James when she got hold of him in such a  manner as would scourge the offending Adam out of him for once  and for all.    \"And not only that,\" continued Mrs. Pett. \"That would be bad enough  in itself, but somehow the papers have discovered that I am the  boy's aunt. Two weeks ago they printed my photograph with one of  these articles. I suppose they will always do it now. That is why I  have come to you. It must stop. And the only way it can be made to  stop is by taking your step-son away from London where he is  running wild. Peter has most kindly consented to give the boy a  position in his office. It is very good of him, for the boy cannot  in the nature of things be of any use for a very long time, but we  have talked it over and it seems the only course. I have come this  morning to ask you to let us take James Crocker back to America  with us and keep him out of mischief by giving him honest work.  What do you say?\"    Mrs. Crocker raised her eyebrows.    \"What do you expect me to say? It is utterly preposterous. I have  never heard anything so supremely absurd in my life.\"    \"You refuse?\"    \"Of course I refuse.\"    \"I think you are extremely foolish.\"    \"Indeed!\"    Mr. Pett cowed in his chair. He was feeling rather like a nervous  and peace-loving patron of a wild western saloon who observes two  cowboys reach for their hip-pockets. Neither his wife nor his  sister-in-law paid any attention to him. The concluding exercises  of a duel of the eyes was in progress between them. After some  silent, age-long moments, Mrs. Crocker laughed a light laugh.    \"Most extraordinary!\" she murmured.    Mrs. Pett was in no mood for Anglicisms.    \"You know perfectly well, Eugenia,\" she said heatedly, \"that  James Crocker is being ruined here. For his sake, if not for  mine--\"    Mrs. Crocker laughed another light laugh, one of those offensive  rippling things which cause so much annoyance.    \"Don't be so ridiculous, Nesta! Ruined! Really! It is quite true  that, a long while ago, when he was much younger and not quite used  to the ways of London Society, James was a little wild, but all  that sort of thing is over now. He knows\"--she paused, setting  herself as it were for the punch--\"he knows that at any moment  the government may decide to give his father a Peerage . . .\"    The blow went home. A quite audible gasp escaped her stricken  sister.    \"What!\"    Mrs. Crocker placed two ringed fingers before her mouth in order  not to hide a languid yawn.    \"Yes. Didn't you know? But of course you live so out of the world.  Oh yes, it is extremely probable that Mr. Crocker's name will  appear in the next Honours List. He is very highly thought of by  the Powers. So naturally James is quite aware that he must behave  in a suitable manner. He is a dear boy! He was handicapped at  first by getting into the wrong set, but now his closest friend  is Lord Percy Whipple, the second son of the Duke of Devizes, who  is one of the most eminent men in the kingdom and a personal  friend of the Premier.\"    Mrs. Pett was in bad shape under this rain of titles, but she  rallied herself to reply in kind.    \"Indeed?\" she said. \"I should like to meet him. I have no doubt  he knows our great friend, Lord Wisbeach.\"    Mrs. Crocker was a little taken aback. She had not supposed that  her sister had even this small shot in her locker.    \"Do you know Lord Wisbeach?\" she said.    \"Oh yes,\" replied Mrs. Pett, beginning to feel a little better.  \"We have been seeing him every day. He always says that he looks  on my house as quite a home. He knows so few people in New York.  It has been a great comfort to him, I think, knowing us.\"    Mrs. Crocker had had time now to recover her poise.    \"Poor dear Wizzy!\" she said languidly.    Mrs. Pett started.    \"What!\"    \"I suppose he is still the same dear, stupid, shiftless fellow?  He left here with the intention of travelling round the world,  and he has stopped in New York! How like him!\"    \"Do you know Lord Wisbeach?\" demanded Mrs. Pett.    Mrs. Crocker raised her eyebrows.    \"Know him? Why, I suppose, after Lord Percy Whipple, he is James'  most intimate friend!\"    Mrs. Pett rose. She was dignified even in defeat. She collected  Ogden and Mr. Pett with an eye which even Ogden could see was not  to be trifled with. She uttered no word.    \"Must you really go?\" said Mrs. Crocker. \"It was sweet of you to  bother to come all the way from America like this. So strange to  meet any one from America nowadays. Most extraordinary!\"    The _cortege_ left the room in silence. Mrs. Crocker had touched  the bell, but the mourners did not wait for the arrival of  Bayliss. They were in no mood for the formalities of polite  Society. They wanted to be elsewhere, and they wanted to be there  quick. The front door had closed behind them before the butler  reached the morning-room.    \"Bayliss,\" said Mrs. Crocker with happy, shining face, \"send for  the car to come round at once.\"    \"Very good, madam.\"    \"Is Mr. James up yet?\"    \"I believe not, madam.\"    Mrs. Crocker went upstairs to her room. If Bayliss had not been  within earshot, she would probably have sung a bar or two. Her  amiability extended even to her step-son, though she had not  altered her intention of speaking eloquently to him on certain  matters when she could get hold of him. That, however, could  wait. For the moment, she felt in vein for a gentle drive in the  Park.    A few minutes after she had disappeared, there was a sound of  slow footsteps on the stairs, and a young man came down into the  hall. Bayliss, who had finished telephoning to the garage for  Mrs. Crocker's limousine and was about to descend to those lower  depths where he had his being, turned, and a grave smile of  welcome played over his face.    \"Good morning, Mr. James,\" he said.        CHAPTER IV    JIMMY'S DISTURBING NEWS    Jimmy Crocker was a tall and well-knit young man who later on in  the day would no doubt be at least passably good-looking. At the  moment an unbecoming pallor marred his face, and beneath his eyes  were marks that suggested that he had slept little and ill. He  stood at the foot of the stairs, yawning cavernously.    \"Bayliss,\" he said, \"have you been painting yourself yellow?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Strange! Your face looks a bright gamboge to me, and your  outlines wobble. Bayliss, never mix your drinks. I say this to  you as a friend. Is there any one in the morning-room?\"    \"No, Mr. James.\"    \"Speak softly, Bayliss, for I am not well. I am conscious of a  strange weakness. Lead me to the morning-room, then, and lay me  gently on a sofa. These are the times that try men's souls.\"    The sun was now shining strongly through the windows of the  morning-room. Bayliss lowered the shades. Jimmy Crocker sank onto  the sofa, and closed his eyes.    \"Bayliss.\"    \"Sir?\"    \"A conviction is stealing over me that I am about to expire.\"    \"Shall I bring you a little breakfast, Mr. James?\"    A strong shudder shook Jimmy.    \"Don't be flippant, Bayliss,\" he protested. \"Try to cure yourself  of this passion for being funny at the wrong time. Your comedy is  good, but tact is a finer quality than humour. Perhaps you think  I have forgotten that morning when I was feeling just as I do  to-day and you"]]]
