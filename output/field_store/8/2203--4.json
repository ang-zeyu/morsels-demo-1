He would do no more because of the women and children in the  place; and, considering his disadvantage, the Boers with a little more  determination might have held the town. After showing on the left  General Wavell swept round on the right, sending the North  Staffordshires towards the north side. There they entered, and the place  was, so to speak, nipped between the two arms of the brigade, with the  artillery in the middle ready to speak. The Boers now broke and fled  south-west and north-west, followed by showers of shrapnel. \"It was an  awfully pretty sight,\" the General remarked to me, \"to see the shrapnel  bursting all round in showers; one of the prettiest things I have ever  seen.\" The enemy had open country and soon got away, but in the meantime  the Union Jack was blowing bravely over Jacobsdaal, and we were in  possession of a most important square on the big chessboard of the  Orange Free State.    Of course the chief importance of the position was that it formed a  depot for stores and a halting-place for convoys on the way to the  front. The General, with Captain Carleton (brigade-major) and Captain  Davidson (A.D.C.), was under fire during the whole of this brisk little  action; and Captain Carleton told me that the bullets were whizzing past  as briskly at two thousand yards as at two hundred. It need hardly be  said that since there were only three staff-officers, whose lives were  of the utmost value to the expedition, they spent most of their time in  and about the front firing lines. As soon as the General had occupied  the square he turned his men out and bivouacked them on the plain round  the village. They were exhausted after an eight-mile march, with this  action at the end of it; hot and thirsty too, suffering from such heat  and thirst as is only known in dusty deserts like the Karoo in time of  drought. There was a certain amount of looting--chiefly of cloth and  stuffs from the shops; but it was suddenly brought to an end by Lord  Roberts's startling order that any man found in the act of looting, or  any man against whom acts of looting could be proved, would be hanged,  and his battalion sent down to the base. There was no more looting.  \"There _were_ three ducks found with their necks wrung,\" the General  admitted, \"but we paid for them!\"    The occupation of Jacobsdaal was, of course, only an incident in the  great whirl of operations which began on the 3rd of February, when  General Macdonald with the Highland Brigade moved westward from Modder  River and seized Koodoesberg. Hitherto we had been waging a very  straightforward kind of war, and Lord Roberts's masterly tactics between  Modder River and Paardeberg were the first hint we had given our enemy  that we also could be cunning. When I arrived at Modder River the wheels  of this great operation were spinning, but Modder itself was in an eddy,  where there was no movement and little news of any. French was racing to  head Cronje off on the north of the Modder River, and the main body of  the army was advancing in his rear, but we at Modder River knew next to  nothing of these movements.    It is worth while to recall the principal events in Lord Roberts's  operations near Modder River. The seizing of Koodoesberg was, of course,  intended to divert the attention of the Boers from the points at which  the real movement was taking place. On the 8th of the month General  Macdonald was recalled to Modder River; on the 9th Lord Roberts arrived  there and assumed command; on the 12th General French marched from  Ramdam, where he had been collecting a big cavalry force, seized  Dekiel's Drift and Klip Drift on the Modder, and the next day occupied a  commanding position on the north of the river, capturing three of the  enemy's laagers. On the 15th, having traversed Cronje's communications,  French reached Kimberley and dislodged the enemy from the southern side  of the town; they evacuated Magersfontein and Spytfontein, and retreated  to Koodoesrand, contriving in their turn to slip through our containing  lines. Jacobsdaal was captured on the same day, and on the 16th of  February began the fighting at Paardeberg, which was only brought to an  end by Cronje's surrender on the 27th.    However, one was only (as I have said) in the stagnant middle of things  at Jacobsdaal, and the outer currents did not reach us. From our point  of view Jacobsdaal was not an important station on the war-path to  Bloemfontein; it was simply a place of insufficient food, bad smells,  choking dust, and many hospitals. The Red Cross flag flew from all the  churches and every available house; furniture was piled in verandahs,  and pews were stacked in churchyards.    Enteric was rife there; but could a man, officer or private, who had  been out for twelve hours on foraging or convoy duty, sit down and boil  his water and then wait for a drink until it cooled? Because the water  looked clear and innocent they drank it by the quart, and therefore the  hospitals were full. Jacobsdaal is responsible for many of the  inglorious deaths of \"active service.\"    Early one morning, while the air was yet fresh and cool, General Wavell  took me round with him on his hospital inspection. He is one of the  small, keen, kind-eyed men who emerge in the senior ranks of the army.  One never meets them as subalterns, and they represent the army's best  workmanship in the matter of moulding and finishing. We were still  talking about the \"pretty\" little action when we entered the first  hospital--a small Dutch church. I should have said that besides our own  field hospitals at Jacobsdaal there was a Boer hospital and one of the  German Red Cross Society.    This first was the Boer hospital, and even at this early hour the air  was pungent with the reek of strong tobacco. The General spoke to all  the patients, and had a kind word for everyone, and they all greeted him  with gratitude and cordiality. Their one cry was, \"We've had as much as  we want. If we could only get back to our farms!\" Most of those to whom  I spoke said that they had never wanted to fight us, never hoped to beat  us, and were heartily sick of the whole affair. \"I wish I could send you  back to your homes, men,\" said the General; \"but I must obey orders.\"  They chatted away to us, and said they hoped the General would come in  often. It was much the same in the German and English houses, only here  Boers and Englishmen lay side by side, sharing pipes and papers and talk  with each other. Truly, animosity ceases at the hospital door; and the  attitude of these men who had been menacing each other's lives and now  lay stricken together was not unlike the shame-faced amity of children  who have been caught fighting, and are made to share a punishment.    And no one was more concerned and depressed by the whole business than  the brisk little General, who had been speaking almost caressingly of  his shells and shrapnel. He is surely a good soldier who fights at as  small a cost as possible, disregards that cost while he fights, and  afterwards so behaves that his enemies like to take him by the hand.    Hospitals, where so many virtues too tender for the airs of the outside  world have time to bloom, are generally attractive rather than repulsive  places, and I was on that account the more surprised to find myself  repelled by these field-hospitals. To see men lying about distorted,  impotent, disfigured by all kinds of fantastic deformities, their wounds  still new, themselves lying near the spot where they fell; and to  remember the cause of it all, and how vague that cause really was to the  men who were suffering for it; the grossness and brutality of  mutilation--here a man with lead in his bowels, there a man with his  face obliterated, one man groaning and spitting from bleeding lungs,  another, struck by a great piece of flying iron, silent under the shock  of news that his sight was gone for ever; the feeling that these men  were suffering on our account, and the realisation that every one of us  has had his share in the responsibility for the whole, makes a load that  one cannot, or should not, slough away in a moment.          VII    MAGERSFONTEIN AND KIMBERLEY      There was a train going to Kimberley with cattle and forage on the  afternoon of Thursday, February 22nd, and the stagnation of everything  except dust at Modder being complete, I jumped on the twenty-ninth truck  as the engine was taking up the slack of the couplings and was  immediately jerked forward on the newly-mended road to the north. I had  nothing with me except what I stood in and a waterproof; but as the  journey of twenty-four miles occupied four hours, and as the heavens  poured down a deluge during three hours and twenty-five minutes of the  time I was glad to have even that. The line passes beside Magersfontein  and through gaps in six ridges behind it, affording an excellent view of  the whole position. That position seemed to me practically impregnable.  To have won a way to Kimberley upon this road would probably have meant  six bloody battles, always with the likelihood of a reverse after each  for the attacking army. Imagine a wide and perfectly level plain with a  ridge standing straight across it like a great railway embankment, but  with arms at each end curving towards the front as the arms of a trench  are curved; behind the ridge, and higher, two or three kopjes which  command it; behind the kopjes another ridge like the first, with more  kopjes to command it; the same thing repeated half a dozen times,  without another eminence within fifteen miles. Imagine this, and you see  the country between Modder River and Kimberley. And throughout the  position every piece of open ground was slashed and seamed by trenches  and works, constructed as though for the inspection of an examiner in  engineering--beautiful, artistic,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2388"],[0,"The Song Celestial; Or, Bhagavad-Gîtâ (from the Mahâbhârata) (#10)"],[1,"the known    By the knower![FN#27] What it is, that \"field\" of life,    What qualities it hath, and whence it is,    And why it changeth, and the faculty    That wotteth it, the mightiness of this,    And how it wotteth-hear these things from Me!      .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .[FN#28]        The elements, the conscious life, the mind,    The unseen vital force, the nine strange gates    Of the body, and the five domains of sense;    Desire, dislike, pleasure and pain, and thought    Deep-woven, and persistency of being;    These all are wrought on Matter by the Soul!

And what is otherwise is ignorance!      Now will I speak of knowledge best to know-    That Truth which giveth man Amrit to drink,    The Truth of HIM, the Para-Brahm, the All,    The Uncreated;; not Asat, not Sat,    Not Form, nor the Unformed; yet both, and more;--    Whose hands are everywhere, and everywhere    Planted His feet, and everywhere His eyes    Beholding, and His ears in every place    Hearing, and all His faces everywhere    Enlightening and encompassing His worlds.    Glorified in the senses He hath given,    Yet beyond sense He is; sustaining all,    Yet dwells He unattached: of forms and modes    Master, yet neither form nor mode hath He;    He is within all beings--and without--    Motionless, yet still moving; not discerned    For subtlety of instant presence; close    To all, to each; yet measurelessly far!    Not manifold, and yet subsisting still    In all which lives; for ever to be known    As the Sustainer, yet, at the End of Times,    He maketh all to end--and re-creates.    The Light of Lights He is, in the heart of the Dark    Shining eternally. Wisdom He is    And Wisdom's way, and Guide of all the wise,    Planted in every heart.      So have I told    Of Life's stuff, and the moulding, and the lore    To comprehend. Whoso, adoring Me,    Perceiveth this, shall surely come to Me!      Know thou that Nature and the Spirit both    Have no beginning! Know that qualities    And changes of them are by Nature wrought;    That Nature puts to work the acting frame,    But Spirit doth inform it, and so cause    Feeling of pain and pleasure. Spirit, linked    To moulded matter, entereth into bond    With qualities by Nature framed, and, thus    Married to matter, breeds the birth again    In good or evil yonis.[FN#29]      Yet is this    Yea! in its bodily prison!--Spirit pure,    Spirit supreme; surveying, governing,    Guarding, possessing; Lord and Master still    PURUSHA, Ultimate, One Soul with Me.      Whoso thus knows himself, and knows his soul    PURUSHA, working through the qualities    With Nature's modes, the light hath come for him!    Whatever flesh he bears, never again    Shall he take on its load. Some few there be    By meditation find the Soul in Self    Self-schooled; and some by long philosophy    And holy life reach thither; some by works:    Some, never so attaining, hear of light    From other lips, and seize, and cleave to it    Worshipping; yea! and those--to teaching true--    Overpass Death!      Wherever, Indian Prince!    Life is--of moving things, or things unmoved,    Plant or still seed--know, what is there hath grown    By bond of Matter and of Spirit: Know    He sees indeed who sees in all alike    The living, lordly Soul; the Soul Supreme,    Imperishable amid the Perishing:    For, whoso thus beholds, in every place,    In every form, the same, one, Living Life,    Doth no more wrongfulness unto himself,    But goes the highest road which brings to bliss.    Seeing, he sees, indeed, who sees that works    Are Nature's wont, for Soul to practise by    Acting, yet not the agent; sees the mass    Of separate living things--each of its kind--    Issue from One, and blend again to One:    Then hath he BRAHMA, he attains!      O Prince!    That Ultimate, High Spirit, Uncreate,    Unqualified, even when it entereth flesh    Taketh no stain of acts, worketh in nought!    Like to the ethereal air, pervading all,    Which, for sheer subtlety, avoideth taint,    The subtle Soul sits everywhere, unstained:    Like to the light of the all-piercing sun    [Which is not changed by aught it shines upon,]    The Soul's light shineth pure in every place;    And they who, by such eye of wisdom, see    How Matter, and what deals with it, divide;    And how the Spirit and the flesh have strife,    Those wise ones go the way which leads to Life!

Yet farther will I open unto thee    This wisdom of all wisdoms, uttermost,    The which possessing, all My saints have passed    To perfectness. On such high verities    Reliant, rising into fellowship    With Me, they are not born again at birth    Of Kalpas, nor at Pralyas suffer change!      This Universe the womb is where I plant    Seed of all lives! Thence, Prince of India, comes    Birth to all beings! Whoso, Kunti's Son!    Mothers each mortal form, Brahma conceives,    And I am He that fathers, sending seed!      Sattwan, Rajas, and Tamas, so are named    The qualities of Nature, \"Soothfastness,\"    \"Passion,\" and \"Ignorance.\" These three bind down    The changeless Spirit in the changeful flesh.    Whereof sweet \"Soothfastness,\" by purity    Living unsullied and enlightened, binds    The sinless Soul to happiness and truth;    And Passion, being kin to appetite,    And breeding impulse and propensity,    Binds the embodied Soul, O Kunti's Son!    By tie of works. But Ignorance, begot    Of Darkness, blinding mortal men, binds down    Their souls to stupor, sloth, and drowsiness.    Yea, Prince of India! Soothfastness binds souls    In pleasant wise to flesh; and Passion binds    By toilsome strain; but Ignorance, which blots    The beams of wisdom, binds the soul to sloth.    Passion and Ignorance, once overcome,    Leave Soothfastness, O Bharata! Where this    With Ignorance are absent, Passion rules;    And Ignorance in hearts not good nor quick.    When at all gateways of the Body shines    The Lamp of Knowledge, then may one see well    Soothfastness settled in that city reigns;    Where longing is, and ardour, and unrest,    Impulse to strive and gain, and avarice,    Those spring from Passion--Prince!--engrained; and where    Darkness and dulness, sloth and stupor are,    'Tis Ignorance hath caused them, Kuru Chief!      Moreover, when a soul departeth, fixed    In Soothfastness, it goeth to the place--    Perfect and pure--of those that know all Truth.    If it departeth in set habitude    Of Impulse, it shall pass into the world    Of spirits tied to works; and, if it dies    In hardened Ignorance, that blinded soul    Is born anew in some unlighted womb.      The fruit of Soothfastness is true and sweet;    The fruit of lusts is pain and toil; the fruit    Of Ignorance is deeper darkness. Yea!    For Light brings light, and Passion ache to have;    And gloom, bewilderments, and ignorance    Grow forth from Ignorance. Those of the first    Rise ever higher; those of the second mode    Take a mid place; the darkened souls sink back    To lower deeps, loaded with witlessness!      When, watching life, the living man perceives    The only actors are the Qualities,    And knows what rules beyond the Qualities,    Then is he come nigh unto Me!      The Soul,    Thus passing forth from the Three Qualities--    Whereby arise all bodies--overcomes    Birth, Death, Sorrow, and Age; and drinketh deep    The undying wine of Amrit.      Arjuna.    Oh, my Lord!    Which be the signs to know him that hath gone    Past the Three Modes? How liveth he? What way    Leadeth him safe beyond the threefold Modes?      Krishna.    He who with equanimity surveys    Lustre of goodness, strife of passion, sloth    Of ignorance, not angry if they are,    Not wishful when they are not: he who sits    A sojourner and stranger in their midst    Unruffled, standing off, saying--serene--    When troubles break, \"These be the Qualities!\"    He unto whom--self-centred--grief and joy    Sound as one word; to whose deep-seeing eyes    The clod, the marble, and the gold are one;    Whose equal heart holds the same gentleness    For lovely and unlovely things, firm-set,    Well-pleased in praise and dispraise; satisfied    With honour or dishonour; unto friends    And unto foes alike in tolerance;    Detached from undertakings,--he is named    Surmounter of the Qualities!      And such--    With single, fervent faith adoring Me,    Passing beyond the Qualities, conforms    To Brahma, and attains Me!      For I am    That whereof Brahma is the likeness! Mine    The Amrit is; and Immortality    Is mine; and mine perfect Felicity!      HERE ENDS CHAPTER XIV.
