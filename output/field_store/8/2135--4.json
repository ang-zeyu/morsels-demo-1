Harvey rang lustily, for he felt two lives depended on him. But Disko  in the cabin, scrawling in the log-book, did not look like a murderer,  and when he went to supper he even smiled drily at the anxious Harvey.    \"This ain't no weather,\" said Dan. \"Why, you an' me could set thet  trawl! They've only gone out jest far 'nough so's not to foul our  cable. They don't need no bell reelly.\"    \"Clang! cling! clang!\" Harvey kept it up, varied with occasional  rub-a-dubs, for another half-hour. There was a bellow and a bump  alongside. Manuel and Dan raced to the hooks of the dory-tackle; Long  Jack and Tom Platt arrived on deck together, it seemed, one half the  North Atlantic at their backs, and the dory followed them in the air,  landing with a clatter.    \"Nary snarl,\" said Tom Platt, as he dripped. \"Danny, you'll do yet.\"    \"The pleasure av your comp'ny to the banquit,\" said Long Jack,  squelching the water from his boots as he capered like an elephant and  stuck an oilskinned arm into Harvey's face. \"We do be condescending to  honour the second half wid our presence.\" And off they all four rolled  to supper, where Harvey stuffed himself to the brim on fish-chowder and  fried pies, and fell fast asleep just as Manuel produced from a locker  a lovely two-foot model of the Lucy Holmes, his first boat, and was  going to show Harvey the ropes. Harvey never even twiddled his fingers  as Penn pushed him into his bunk.    \"It must be a sad thing--a very sad thing,\" said Penn, watching the  boy's face, \"for his mother and his father, who think he is dead. To  lose a child--to lose a man-child!\"    \"Git out o' this, Penn,\" said Dan. \"Go aft and finish your game with  Uncle Salters. Tell dad I'll stand Harve's watch ef he don't keer. He's  played aout.\"    \"Ver' good boy,\" said Manuel, slipping out of his boots and  disappearing into the black shadows of the lower bunk. \"Expec' he make  good man, Danny. I no see he is any so mad as your parpa he says. Eh,  wha-at?\"    Dan chuckled, but the chuckle ended in a snore.    It was thick weather outside, with a rising wind, and the elder men  stretched their watches. The hours struck clear in the cabin; the  nosing bows slapped and scuffled with the seas; the fo'c'sle stovepipe  hissed and sputtered as the spray caught it; and the boys slept on,  while Disko, Long Jack, Tom Plait, and Uncle Salters, each in turn,  stumped aft to look at the wheel, forward to see that the anchor held,  or to veer out a little more cable against chafing, with a glance at  the dim anchor-light between each round.        CHAPTER IV    Harvey waked to find the \"first half\" at 'breakfast, the fo'c'sle door  drawn to a crack, and every square inch of the schooner singing its own  tune. The black bulk of the cook balanced behind the tiny galley over  the glare of the stove, and the pots and pans in the pierced wooden  board before it jarred and racketed to each plunge. Up and up the  fo'c'sle climbed, yearning and surging and quivering, and then, with a  clear, sickle-like swoop, came down into the seas. He could hear the  flaring bows cut and squelch, and there was a pause ere the divided  waters came down on the deck above, like a volley of buck-shot.  Followed the woolly sound of the cable in the hawse-hole; a grunt and  squeal of the windlass; a yaw, a punt, and a kick, and the \"We're Here\"  gathered herself together to repeat the motions.    \"Now, ashore,\" he heard Long Jack saying, \"ye've chores, an' ye must do  thim in any weather. Here we're well clear of the fleet, an' we've no  chores--an' that's a blessin'. Good night, all.\" He passed like a big  snake from the table to his bunk, and began to smoke. Tom Platt  followed his example; Uncle Salters, with Penn, fought his way up the  ladder to stand his watch, and the cook set for the \"second half.\"    It came out of its bunks as the others had entered theirs, with a shake  and a yawn. It ate till it could eat no more; and then Manuel filled  his pipe with some terrible tobacco, crotched himself between the  pawl-post and a forward bunk, cocked his feet up on the table, and  smiled tender and indolent smiles at the smoke. Dan lay at length in  his bunk, wrestling with a gaudy, gilt-stopped accordion, whose tunes  went up and down with the pitching of the \"We're Here\". The cook, his  shoulders against the locker where he kept the fried pies (Dan was fond  of fried pies), peeled potatoes, with one eye on the stove in event of  too much water finding its way down the pipe; and the general smell and  smother were past all description.    Harvey considered affairs, wondered that he was not deathly sick, and  crawled into his bunk again, as the softest and safest place, while Dan  struck up, \"I don't want to play in your yard,\" as accurately as the  wild jerks allowed.    \"How long is this for?\" Harvey asked of Manuel.    \"Till she get a little quiet, and we can row to trawl. Perhaps  to-night. Perhaps two days more. You do not like? Eh, wha-at?\"    \"I should have been crazy sick a week ago, but it doesn't seem to upset  me now--much.\"    \"That is because we make you fisherman, these days. If I was you, when  I come to Gloucester I would give two, three big candles for my good  luck.\"    \"Give who?\"    \"To be sure--the Virgin of our Church on the Hill. She is very good to  fishermen all the time. That is why so few of us Portugee men ever are  drowned.\"    \"You're a Roman Catholic, then?\"    \"I am a Madeira man. I am not a Porto Pico boy. Shall I be Baptist,  then? Eh, wha-at? I always give candles--two, three more when I come to  Gloucester. The good Virgin she never forgets me, Manuel.\"    \"I don't sense it that way,\" Tom Platt put in from his bunk, his  scarred face lit up by the glare of a match as he sucked at his pipe.  \"It stands to reason the sea's the sea; and you'll git jest about  what's goin', candles or kerosene, fer that matter.\"    \"Tis a mighty good thing,\" said Long Jack, \"to have a fri'nd at coort,  though. I'm o' Manuel's way o' thinkin'. About tin years back I was  crew to a Sou' Boston market-boat. We was off Minot's Ledge wid a  northeaster, butt first, atop of us, thicker'n burgoo. The ould man was  dhrunk, his chin waggin' on the tiller, an' I sez to myself, 'If iver I  stick my boat-huk into T-wharf again, I'll show the saints fwhat manner  o' craft they saved me out av.' Now, I'm here, as ye can well see, an'  the model of the dhirty ould Kathleen, that took me a month to make, I  gave ut to the priest, an' he hung Ut up forninst the altar. There's  more sense in givin' a model that's by way o' bein' a work av art than  any candle. Ye can buy candles at store, but a model shows the good  saints ye've tuk trouble an' are grateful.\"    \"D'you believe that, Irish?\" said Tom Platt, turning on his elbow.    \"Would I do Ut if I did not, Ohio?\"    \"Wa-al, Enoch Fuller he made a model o' the old Ohio, and she's to  Salem museum now. Mighty pretty model, too, but I guess Enoch he never  done it fer no sacrifice; an' the way I take it is--\"    There were the makings of an hour-long discussion of the kind that  fishermen love, where the talk runs in shouting circles and no one  proves anything at the end, had not Dan struck up this cheerful rhyme:      \"Up jumped the mackerel with his striped back.    Reef in the mainsail, and haul on the tack;    For it's windy weather--\"    Here Long Jack joined in:      \"And it's blowy weather;    When the winds begin to blow, pipe all hands together!\"    Dan went on, with a cautious look at Tom Plait, holding the accordion  low in the bunk:      \"Up jumped the cod with his chuckle-head,    Went to the main-chains to heave at the lead;    For it's windy weather,\" etc.    Tom Platt seemed to be hunting for something. Dan crouched lower, but  sang louder:      \"Up jumped the flounder that swims to the ground.    Chuckle-head! Chuckle-head!    Mind where ye sound!\"    Tom Platt's huge rubber boot whirled across the fo'c'sle and caught  Dan's uplifted arm. There was war between the man and the boy ever  since Dan had discovered that the mere whistling of that tune would  make him angry as he heaved the lead.    \"Thought I'd fetch yer,\" said Dan, returning the gift with precision.  \"Ef you don't like my music, git out your fiddle. I ain't goin' to lie  here all day an' listen to you an' Long Jack arguin' 'baout candles.  Fiddle, Tom Platt; or I'll learn Harve here the tune!\"    Tom Platt leaned down to a locker and brought up an old white fiddle.  Manuel's eye glistened, and from somewhere behind the pawl-post he drew  out a tiny, guitar-like thing with wire strings, which he called a  _machette_.    \"'Tis a concert,\" said Long Jack, beaming through the smoke. \"A reg'lar  Boston concert.\"    There was a burst of spray as the hatch opened, and Disko, in yellow  oilskins, descended.    \"Ye're just in time, Disko. Fwhat's she doin' outside?\"    \"Jest this!\" He dropped on to the lockers with the push and heave of  the \"We're Here\".    \"We're singin' to kape our breakfasts down. Ye'll lead, av course,  Disko,\" said Long Jack.    \"Guess there ain't more'n 'baout two old songs I know, an' ye've heerd  them both.\"    His excuses were cut short by Tom Platt launching into a most dolorous  tune, like unto the moaning of winds and the creaking of masts. With  his eyes fixed on the beams above, Disko began this ancient, ancient  ditty, Tom Platt flourishing all round him to make the tune and words  fit a little:      \"There is a crack packet--crack packet o' fame,    She hails from Noo York, an'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22257"],[0,"Bulgaria (#10)"],[1,"in 1830.    The Treaty of San Stefano brought into being on paper a Bulgaria greater  in area than the Bulgaria of 1912, and greater even than the Bulgaria of  1914. But the Treaty was not ratified. Other European Powers, alarmed at  the prospect of Russia becoming supreme in the Balkans through the aid  of a Bulgarian vassal state, interfered, and the Congress of Berlin  substituted for the Treaty of San Stefano the Treaty of Berlin.    The Treaty of Berlin provided:        Bulgaria is to be an independent Principality, subject to the      Sultan, with a Christian government and a national militia; the      Prince of Bulgaria will be freely chosen by the Bulgarian nation      and accepted by the Sublime Porte, with the approval of the      Great Powers; no member of a reigning European family can be      elected Prince of Bulgaria; in case of a vacancy of the throne      the election will be repeated under the same conditions and with      the same forms; before the election of the Prince, an assembly      of notables will decide on the constitutional statute of the      Principality at Tirnovo. The laws will be based on principles of      civil and religious liberty.    By the Treaty of Berlin the boundaries of Bulgaria were very greatly  curtailed as compared with those of the Treaty of San Stefano, shrinking  from an area as great almost as the Bulgarian Empire of Simeon down to a  broad band of territory running between Eastern Roumelia and Roumania.    [Illustration: A BLIND BEGGAR WOMAN]    But the Bulgars kept the Treaty of San Stefano rather than the Treaty of  Berlin before their eyes as their national charter. Almost from the  first there were encroachments upon the provisions of the Treaty of  Berlin. Its limitations of Bulgarian sovereignty were ignored little by  little. Eastern Roumelia was united to Bulgaria proper by a bold and  well-timed stroke. Another occasion was sought to get rid of the tribute  to Turkey, and from a Prince, subject to a suzerain, the ruler of  Bulgaria became a Czar, responsible to none but his subjects. Finally,  when the war of 1912 against Turkey was entered upon to liberate further  Christian provinces from the rule of the Turk, the Bulgarian people, if  not the Bulgarian rulers, had clearly before their eyes the vision of  the Bulgaria of the San Stefano Treaty. At one time it seemed as if that  fond hope would be realised. But misfortunes and mistakes intervened,  and as a final result of that and succeeding wars Bulgaria has been left  with a comparatively small accession of territory, and is not much  better off than she was in 1912.    It is not my purpose to attempt any detailed history of Bulgaria. I have  designed, rather, an indication in broad outline of her national growth  as a basis for, and an introduction to, an intimate picture of the  country as it is to-day. All that is needed, then, to add to this  chapter regarding the Liberation of Bulgaria, is that after the Treaty  of Berlin had been ratified, the first task that faced the principality  of Bulgaria was to make it clear to Russia that, whilst she was grateful  for the aid which had enabled her to become independent, she aspired to  a real independence, and did not wish to exchange one master for  another. The task was difficult, and caused some early trouble for the  revived nation.    [Illustration: A YOUNG MARRIED SHOP WOMAN]    The first Prince chosen to be monarch of Bulgaria was Prince Alexander  of Battenberg, a brave soldier but an indifferent statesman. He offended  in turn both the Bulgarian patriots who wished him to lead their country  to a complete freedom, and the Russians who would have her kept under a  kind of tutelage to the \"Little Father.\" Still Bulgaria, in his reign,  made notable advances towards her national ideals. In 1885, obedient to  the earnest wish of its inhabitants, Eastern Roumelia was incorporated  with Bulgaria as a united principality, and that much of the Treaty of  Berlin torn up. Turkey, whose rights were chiefly affected, decided not  to make war upon this issue. The Great Powers, other than Russia, which  had insisted, in the first instance, on the separation of Bulgaria into  Bulgaria Proper and Eastern Roumelia because they feared that  Bulgaria would be a mere appanage of Russia and would in actual effect  bring the Russian frontier so much nearer to Constantinople, were now  fairly reassured on that point. They not only made no protest, but they  prevented Greece from doing so. There remained to be reckoned with only  Russia and Servia. Russia showed her displeasure by recalling every  Russian officer then serving with the Bulgarian army; but she did not  make war. Servia, fearful that this Bulgarian aggrandisement jeopardised  her own future in the Balkans, made war. Prince Alexander took the field  with his troops--made up of Bulgarians, Macedonians, and Turks living in  Bulgaria--and in the battle of Slivnitza Bulgaria won a decisive  victory. She was not allowed to reap any direct fruits from it, as  Austria interfered on behalf of Servia. The Treaty of Bucharest made  peace without penalty to Servia, and Bulgaria was left with a greatly  enhanced prestige as her sole reward.    It was a sad sequel to Prince Alexander's courage and address in this  campaign that the next year he was deposed by a conspiracy in which the  moving figures were the chiefs of the pro-Russian party in Bulgaria. The  majority of the Bulgarians were not friendly to this revolution, and  after the kidnapping of the Prince by the rebels a counter-revolution  under Stambuloff would have restored him to the throne had it not been  for the fact that he was irresolute in council though brave in the  field. He could have won back his Crown, but chose rather to surrender  it to Russia.    For some time after it was difficult to find a Prince for Bulgaria. The  Crown was offered in turn to Prince Waldemar of Denmark and King Carol  of Roumania. Finally, Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha consented to  embark on the great adventure of ruling Bulgaria. Wealthy, descended  from the old French royal house on his mother's side, and connected with  the Austrian and German royal houses on his father's, handsome and  youthful, Prince Ferdinand had splendid qualifications for his new  responsibility. He showed, too, from the outset, a fine diplomatic skill  and successfully steered his country through the perilous days which  followed his accession. Russia at first refused to sanction the choice  of him as Prince, and that involved the other Powers in a policy of  refusing him \"recognition.\" He was thus, in a sense, a boycotted  monarch.    With steady and patient skill Prince Ferdinand worked to overcome the  obstacles which stood in the way of Bulgarian national aspirations,  aided much by the masterful statesmanship of Stambuloff. A good  understanding was come to with Turkey, still Bulgaria's suzerain power,  and in 1890 Turkey made the important concession to Bulgaria of  appointing Bulgarian bishops in Macedonia. In 1893 Prince Ferdinand  married Princess Marie Louise of Parma, and the next year an heir was  born to them, Prince Boris. A reconciliation with Russia followed.    [Illustration: A BULGARIAN MARKET TOWN]    Bulgaria now made steady and peaceful progress, the only cloud on her  sky the sorrows of her co-religionists in Macedonia. In 1908 advantage  was taken of the \"Young Turk\" revolution in Turkey for the Bulgarian  Prince to denounce all allegiance to Turkey, and Bulgaria was declared  fully independent and Ferdinand was crowned at Tirnovo as Czar of the  Bulgarians. Turkey was not able to protest, and her confessed weakness  nourished to powerful strength the general desire of the Christian  peoples in the Balkans to free their co-religionists in Thrace and  Macedonia from the rule of the Moslem. \"The Balkan League\" was formed,  and Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro, and Servia prepared to force from  Turkey by war what the Great Powers had so far failed to secure by  diplomacy--the relief of Macedonia from oppression and misrule. It was  during the war of 1912-1913 that I had an opportunity of studying the  Bulgarian people at close hand, as I accompanied the Bulgarian forces as  war correspondent.          CHAPTER VI    THE WAR OF 1912-1913      I can still recollect the glad surprise which a first sight of Sofia  gave to me. With the then conventional view of the Balkan states, I had  expected, on leaving Buda-Pesth, to cut away altogether from  civilisation. Paved streets; solid and good, if not exactly handsome,  buildings; first-class hotels and cafes; electric trams and comfortable,  cheap cabs; luxurious public baths; well-stocked stores; a telephone  system, water-supply, drainage--each one of these was a surprise. I had  expected a semi-barbaric Eastern town. I found a modern capital, small  but orderly, clean, and well managed.    That enthusiastic friend of the Balkan nationalities, Mr. Noel Buxton,  M.P., writing of Sofia and other Balkan capitals, becomes quite lyrical  in his praise:        \"Their capitals,\" he writes, \"have at all times an aspect of      reality, industry, and simplicity. There is little needless      wealth to show, and nothing which, in the West, would be called      luxury. Every one is a worker, and every one a serious      politician. There are no drones, and none who spend their lives      in the pleasures, refinements, luxuries, vices, the idle      amusements of the great cities of Europe. The buildings      represent utility, means fairly adapted to ends, but with no      cumbrous decoration or ponderous display. These capitals are      bureaucratic settlements, devoted to the deliberate ends of      national government with a minimum of waste, strictly      appropriated to use alone, rendering their service to the nation      as a counting-house renders its service to a great factory.
