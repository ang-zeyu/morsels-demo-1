In half an hour we must  continue our journey.\"    Just then the carriage drove past the main guard-house. The soldiers  presented arms, and the drums beat.    A melancholy smile overspread the queen's features. \"Do you remember  what Prince Louis Ferdinand said to his mother, on the eve of his  departure to the army?\" she asked in a low voice.    \"No, your majesty, I do not remember, and it is possible that I never  heard of it.\"    \"The princess believed a defeat of our army to be utterly impossible,\"  said the queen. \"She thought Prussia was so strong a bulwark that the  proud assault of the French empire would be in vain. 'You are mistaken,'  exclaimed Prince Louis Ferdinand; 'you think nothing will change, and  the drums will always be beaten when you ride out at the gate? On the  contrary, I tell you, mamma, one day you will ride out of the gate, and  no drums will be beaten!' The same will happen to us, my dear--we will  often ride out of the gate, and no drums will be beaten. But here is our  house, and I must hide my tears. I will show a smiling face to my  children.\"    The queen's carriage stopped for the first time at the doorsteps of the  palace without meeting there the ladies and gentlemen of the court, the  high dignitaries and functionaries who had formerly never failed to wait  on her. She had come without being expected, but on this day of anxiety  and terror the announcement of her arrival would have made no  difference; for every one thought only of himself, and was occupied with  his own safety. Only a few faithful servants, therefore, received her,  and bade her welcome with tearful eyes.    \"Where are my children?\" exclaimed the queen, anxiously. \"Why are they  not here to receive their mother?\"    \"Your majesty,\" said the palace-steward, in a low voice, \"a courier,  sent hither by the king, arrived last night, unfortunately having failed  to meet with your majesty on the road. The royal princes and princesses  set out two hours ago to Stettin, and thence to Grandenz. Such were his  majesty's orders.\"    The queen suppressed the cry of pain which rose to her lips, but a  deadly pallor overspread her cheeks. \"In half an hour I shall set out,\"  she said faintly. \"Pack up only the most indispensable articles for me;  in half an hour I must be ready to enter my carriage. I shall, perhaps,  overtake my children in Stettin.\" And she retired to her room,  struggling to conceal the emotions that so violently agitated her.          CHAPTER V.    QUIET IS THE CITIZEN'S FIRST DUTY.      The people in the meantime, gathering in still greater numbers in the  broad street under the Linden, returned to the house of Lombard, and  saw, to their great disappointment, that the courier was no longer  there.    \"Now, we want to know the news contained in the dispatches, and  Counsellor Lombard must tell us,\" shouted one of the men standing in  front of the house; he then commenced hammering the door with his  powerful fists. Others joined him, and to the measure of this  threatening music the crowd yelled, \"The dispatches! the dispatches!  Lombard must come out! He must tell us what the dispatches contain! We  want to know whether our army has been defeated, or has won the battle!\"    When no voice replied, nor door nor window opened, the mob, whose anger  grew more menacing, seized once more their former weapons, the stones,  and hurled them at the house. \"He shall not escape from us! We will stay  here until he makes his appearance, and replies to our questions!\" they  cried. \"If he do not come to us, we will go to him and compel him to  hear us!\"    \"Fortunately, you will not find him at home,\" whispered Lombard, who was  listening at the door. \"Every thing is in good order,\" he added in a low  voice. \"The dear enraged people will have to hammer a good while before  breaking these bolts. By that time I shall be far from here, on the road  to Stettin.\"    The cabinet counsellor glided away with a sarcastic smile to the back  gate. There stood his wife, weeping piteously and wringing her hands.    M. Lombard, who had hitherto only smiled, now laughed outright. \"Truly,\"  he said, \"it is really worth while to make a scene in consequence of  this demonstration of the people! My dear, I should think our family  ought to know how to manage them! Your father has shaved those stupid  fiends enough, and my father pulled the wool over their eyes,[9] and, as  good children of our parents, we ought to do so too.\"    [Footnote 9: Lombard's father was a hair-dresser, and his wife's father  a barber. Lombard liked to jest about his descent, particularly at the  dinner-table of some prince or minister. He always alluded to his father  in the following terms: \"_Feu mon pere de poudreuse memoire!_\"]    \"Oh, Lombard, just listen,\" wailed his wife, \"they are knocking at the  door with heavy clubs; we must perish if they succeed in forcing it open  and entering the house. They will assassinate you, for you have heard  their imprecations against you.\"    \"_Ma chere_,\" said Lombard, composedly, \"this is not the first time that  I discover that the people despise and persecute me. I knew it long ago.  These blockheads will never forgive me for being a Frenchman, and for  having, consequently, a predilection for France and her heroic emperor.  And not only they, but the so-called educated and high-born classes  also, hate me intensely. Throughout all Europe I have been branded as a  traitor in the pay of Napoleon. Conspiracies were got up everywhere to  bring about my removal. All the princes of the royal house--nay, the  queen herself, united against me.[10] But you see, my dear, that they  did not succeed after all in undermining my position; and the howling  rabble outside will have no better success. Indeed, the fellows seem to  be in earnest. Their blows shake the whole house!\"    [Footnote 10: Lombard's own words.--Vide Gentz's Diary in his  \"Miscellanies,\" edited by G. Schlesier, vol. iv.]    \"They will succeed in breaking in,\" said his wife, anxiously; \"and then  they will assassinate all of us.\"    \"They will do no such thing, for they do not come for spoils, but only  for news,\" said Lombard. \"And then, my love, they know just as well as I  the German maxim: 'The people of Nuremberg do not hang anybody unless  they have got him!' but they will not get me, for there comes my  faithful Jean across the yard.--Well, Jean, is every thing ready?\" he  said to the approaching footman.    \"Yes,\" he replied. \"The carriage with four excellent horses is waiting  for you, sir. I ordered it, however, not to stop at the garden gate, but  a little farther down, in front of another house.\"    \"That was well done, my sagacious Jean. But I hope you did not forget  either to place several bottles of Tokay wine and some roast fowl in the  carriage for me? The ill-mannered rabble outside will not permit me  to-day to lunch at home. Hence I must make up my mind to do so on the  road.\"    \"I have not forgotten the wine nor the roast pheasant, your excellency.\"    \"You have packed up a pheasant!\" exclaimed Lombard. \"If the noisy  gentlemen outside there knew that, they would be sure to assert that the  Emperor Napoleon had sent it to me as a bribe. Now, Jean, come, we will  set out. The street is quiet, I suppose?\"    \"Perfectly so. All those who have legs have gathered in front of the  house.\"    \"And all those who have fists are hammering at the door,\" wailed Mde.  Lombard. \"Make haste, Lombard--make haste lest it be too late!\"    \"You are right. I must go,\" said Lombard, quietly. \"Now listen to what I  am going to tell you. So soon as you hear my carriage roll away, be kind  enough to repair to the balcony, of the first floor and address the  people. Their surprise at seeing you will cause them to be silent for a  moment.\"    \"But, good Heaven! what am I to say to them?\" asked Mde. Lombard, in  dismay.    \"You are to say to them, 'My husband, Cabinet-Counsellor Lombard, is not  at home. He has gone to the governor of Berlin, Count von  Schulenburg-Kehnert, and the bearer of dispatches has accompanied him.'  Your words will have the same effect as though a pistol were discharged  among a number of sparrows--all of them will fly away. You see, my dear,  there is a very impressive and dramatic scene in store for you, and my  father, _de poudreuse memoire_, and your father, the barber, would  rejoice in their graves if they could see you haranguing the people from  the balcony. Farewell, my dear, and manage the affair as skilfully as  possible.\"    He embraced her hurriedly, and was about to leave the garden, leaning on  his servant's arm, and as fast as his gouty feet would permit it; but  his wife suddenly held him back.    \"I cannot go to the parlor,\" she said in terror, convulsively clinging  to Lombard. \"Remember, that they are continually hurling stones at our  house. Suppose a stone should be thrown into the window and strike my  head?\"    \"My dear,\" said Lombard, laughing, \"I do not believe any stone passing  through the window would be immediately dangerous, for you have a hard  head, as I have found out often enough. Farewell, and do as I have told  you, unless you want the rabble to penetrate into your room. Farewell!\"    He disengaged himself rather roughly, and hastened, as fast as his  aching and stiffened feet would permit, to the street contiguous to the  garden.    His wife waited until the departure of the carriage announced to her  that her husband had gone. At the same time the voices outside shouted  with redoubled fury, \"Lombard! We want to see Lombard!\" And their blows  thundered louder than ever at the door.    Mde. Lombard sighed; and, commending her body and soul to God, she  proceeded to comply with her husband's instructions, and went to the  balcony.    Lombard had prophesied correctly; profound silence ensued when the wife  of the cabinet counsellor appeared; hence, every one was able to  understand her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19564"],[0,"The Pirates' Who's Who (#10)"],[1,"  The captain and forty men set about building a new vessel, while the  remainder went off in canoes to join Captain England's pirates at Johanna.      BOWEN.    A Bristol man. In 1537, when the Breton pirates were becoming very daring  along the south coast of England and Wales, Bowen contrived to capture  fourteen of these robbers, who had landed near Tenby, and had them put in  prison.      BOWEN, CAPTAIN JOHN.    The practice of this South Sea pirate extended from Madagascar to Bengal.  He commanded a good ship, the _Speaker_, a French vessel, owned by an  English company interested in the slave trade, which Bowen had captured by  a cunning ruse. He afterwards lost his ship off Mauritius, but was well  treated by the Dutch Governor, who supplied doctors, medicine, and food to  the shipwrecked pirates. After three months' hospitality on the island,  Bowen procured a sloop, and in March, 1701, sailed for Madagascar. As a  parting friendly gift to the Governor, he gave him 2,500 pieces of eight  and the wreck of the _Speaker_, with all the guns and stores. On arriving  at Madagascar, Bowen erected a fort and built a town. Shortly after this a  ship, the _Speedy Return_, and a brigantine were so very thoughtless as to  put into the port, and paid for this thoughtlessness by being promptly  seized by Bowen. With these two vessels Bowen and his merry men went  \"a-pyrating\" again, and with great success, for in a short time they had  gathered together over a million dollars in coin, as well as vast  quantities of valuable merchandise. The pirates then, most wisely,  considering that they had succeeded well enough, settled down amongst  their Dutch friends in the Island of Mauritius to a quiet and comfortable  life on shore.      BOWMAN, WILLIAM.    A seaman; one of the party which crossed the Isthmus of Darien on foot  with Dampier in 1681. Wafer records that Bowman, \"a weakly Man, a Taylor  by trade,\" slipped while crossing a swollen river, and was carried off by  the swift current, and nearly drowned by the weight of a satchel he  carried containing 400 pieces of eight.      BOYD, ROBERT.    Of Bath Town, North Carolina.    Sailed with Major Stede Bonnet in the _Royal James_. Hanged on November  8th, 1718, at Charleston.      BOYZA.    A Columbian.    One of Captain Gilbert's crew in the _Panda_. Hanged at Boston in June,  1835.      BRADISH, CAPTAIN JOSEPH.    A notorious pirate. Born at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on November 28th,  1672. In March, 1689, was in London out of a berth, and shipped as mate in  the hake-boat _Adventure_, bound for Borneo on an interloping trade.    In September, 1698, when most of the officers and passengers were ashore  at the Island of Polonais, Bradish and the crew cut the cable and ran away  with the ship. The crew shared the money which was found in the  bread-room, and which filled nine chests, amounting to about 3,700 Spanish  dollars.    Bradish sailed the _Adventure_ to Long Island, arriving there on March  19th, 1699. After leaving their money and jewels on Nassau Island, they  sank their ship. Most of the crew bought horses at the neighbouring  farmhouses and disappeared. Bradish and a few others were rash enough to  go to Massachusetts, where they were promptly arrested and placed in the  Boston Gaol. But the gaolkeeper, one Caleb Ray, was a relation of Bradish,  and allowed him to escape. An offer of a reward of L200 brought the  escaped prisoner back, and he sailed in irons on H.M.S. _Advice_, with  Kidd and other pirates, to England, and was hanged in chains in London at  Hope Dock in 1700.      BRADLEY, GEORGE.    Master of Captain Fenn's ship, the _Morning Star_, wrecked on the Grand  Caymans in August, 1722. The crew got ashore on an island and hid in the  woods. Bradley and the other pirates afterwards surrendered themselves to  an English sloop, and were carried to Bermuda. Bradley escaped to England,  and was last heard of at Bristol.      BREAKES, CAPTAIN HIRAM.    This Dutch pirate was the second son of a well-to-do councillor of the  Island of Saba in the West Indies. Hiram was appointed in the year 1764 to  a ship which traded between that island and Amsterdam. In the latter port,  Hiram, who was now 19 years of age and a handsome fellow standing over six  feet in height, fell in love with a certain Mrs. Snyde.    Getting command of a small ship that traded between Schiedam, in Holland,  and Lisbon, Breakes for some time sailed between these ports. Returning to  Amsterdam, he and Mrs. Snyde murdered that lady's husband, but at the  trial managed to get acquitted.    Breakes's next exploit was to steal his employer's ship and cargo and go  out as a pirate, naming his vessel the _Adventure_. His first exploit was  a daring one. Sailing into Vigo Harbour in full view of the forts, he  seized a vessel, the _Acapulco_, lately come from Valparaiso, and took her  off. On plundering her they found 200,000 small bars of gold, each about  the size of a man's finger. The captain and crew of this Chilian vessel  were all murdered. Breakes preferred the _Acapulco_ to his own ship, so he  fitted her up and sailed in her to the Mediterranean.    Breakes was one of the religious variety of pirate, for after six days of  robbing and throat-slitting he would order his crew to clean themselves on  the Sabbath and gather on the quarter-deck, where he would read prayers to  them and would often preach a sermon \"after the Lutheran style,\" thus  fortifying the brave fellows for another week of toil and bloodshed.    Gifted with unlimited boldness, Breakes called in at Gibraltar and  requested the Governor to grant him a British privateer's commission,  which the Governor did \"for a consideration.\" Sailing in the neighbourhood  of the Balearic Islands, he took a few ships, when one day, spying a  nunnery by the sea-shore in Minorca, he proposed to his crew that they  should fit themselves out with a wife apiece.    This generous offer was eagerly accepted, and the crew, headed by Captain  Breakes, marched up to the nunnery unopposed, and were welcomed at the  door by the lady abbess. Having entered the peaceful cloister, each pirate  chose a nun and marched back to the ship with their spoils. Soon after  this Breakes decided to retire from piracy, and returned to Amsterdam to  claim Mrs. Snyde. But he found that she had but lately been hanged for  poisoning her little son, of which the pirate was father. This tragedy so  preyed upon the mind of Captain Breakes that he turned \"melancholy mad\"  and drowned himself in one of the many dykes with which that city abounds.      BRECK, JOHN.    One of the crew of the brigantine _Charles_ (Captain John Quelch). Tried  for piracy at Boston in 1704.      BREHA, CAPTAIN, _alias_ LANDRESSON.      BRENNINGHAM, CAPTAIN.    Of Jamaica and Tortuga.    In 1663 commanded a frigate of six guns and seventy men.      BRIERLY, JOHN, _alias_ TIMBERHEAD.    Of Bath Town in North Carolina.    One of the crew of the _Royal James_. Hanged at Charleston in November,  1718.      BRIGHT, JOHN.    Of St. Margaret's, Westminster.    One of the crew of Captain Charles Harris. Hanged at Newport, Rhode  Island, in July, 1723, at the age of 25.      BRINKLEY, JAMES.    Of Suffolk, England.    One of Captain Charles Harris's crew. Hanged for piracy at Newport, Rhode  Island, on July 19th, 1723. Age 28.      BRODLEY, CAPTAIN JOSEPH, or BRADLEY, sometimes called  \"Lieutenant-Colonel.\" \"An ancient and expert pirate.\"    Appointed Vice-Admiral by Morgan in his expedition up the Chagre River. He  was a tough old pirate, and had proved himself a terror to the Spaniards,  particularly when Mansvelt took the Isle of St. Catharine. In 1676 Brodley  was sent by Morgan to capture the Castle of Chagre, a very strongly  garrisoned fort. All day the pirates kept up a furious attack, but were  driven back. At last, when it seemed impossible for the pirates ever to  succeed in entering the castle, a remarkable accident happened which  altered the whole issue. One of the pirates was wounded by an arrow in his  back, which pierced his body and came out the opposite side. This he  instantly pulled out at the side of his breast; then, taking a little  cotton, he wound it about the arrow, and, putting it into his musket, he  shot it back into the castle. The cotton, kindled by the powder, set fire  to several houses within the castle, which, being thatched with  palm-leaves, took fire very easily. This fire at last reached the powder  magazine, and a great explosion occurred. Owing to this accident of the  arrow the pirates were eventually able to take the Castle of Chagre. This  was one of the finest and bravest defences ever made by the Spaniards. Out  of 314 Spanish soldiers in the castle, only thirty survived, all the rest,  including the Governor, being killed. Brodley was himself severely wounded  in this action and died as a consequence ten days later.      BROOKS, JOSEPH (senior).    One of Blackbeard's crew in the _Queen Ann's Revenge_. Killed on November  22nd, 1718, at North Carolina.      BROOKS, JOSEPH (junior).    One of Blackbeard's crew in the _Queen Ann's Revenge_. Taken prisoner by  Lieutenant Maynard on November 22nd, 1718. Carried to Virginia, where he  was tried and hanged.      BROWN, CAPTAIN.    A notorious latter-day pirate, who \"worked\" the east coast of Central  America in the early part of the nineteenth century.      BROWN, CAPTAIN.    On July 24th, 1702, sailed from Jamaica in command of the _Blessing_--ten  guns and crew of seventy-nine men, with the famous Edward Davis on  board--to attack the town of Tolu on the Spanish Main. The town was taken  and plundered, but Brown was killed, being shot through the head.      BROWN, CAPTAIN NICHOLAS.    Surrendered to the King's pardon for pirates at New Providence, Bahamas,  in 1718. Soon afterwards he surrendered to the Spanish Governor of Cuba,  embraced the Catholic faith, and turned pirate once more; and was"]]]
