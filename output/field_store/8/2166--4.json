With equal probability did old cosmogonists say fossils were created, as  we now see them, with a false resemblance to living beings{105}; what  would the Astronomer say to the doctrine that the planets moved <not>  according to the law of gravitation, but from the Creator having willed  each separate planet to move in its particular orbit? I believe such a  proposition (if we remove all prejudices) would be as legitimate as to  admit that certain groups of living and extinct organisms, in their  distribution, in their structure and in their relations one to another  and to external conditions, agreed with the theory and showed signs of  common descent, and yet were created distinct. As long as it was thought  impossible that organisms should vary, or should anyhow become adapted  to other organisms in a complicated manner, and yet be separated from  them by an impassable barrier of sterility{106}, it was justifiable,  even with some appearance in favour of a common descent, to admit  distinct creation according to the will of an Omniscient Creator; or,  for it is the same thing, to say with Whewell that the beginnings of all  things surpass the comprehension of man. In the former sections I have  endeavoured to show that such variation or specification is not  impossible, nay, in many points of view is absolutely probable. What  then is the evidence in favour of it and what the evidence against it.  With our imperfect knowledge of past ages [surely there will be some] it  would be strange if the imperfection did not create some unfavourable  evidence.         {105} This passage corresponds roughly to the conclusion of the       _Origin_, see Ed. i. p. 482, vi. p. 661.         {106} A similar passage occurs in the conclusion of the _Origin_,       Ed. i. p. 481, vi. p. 659.    Give sketch of the Past,--beginning with facts appearing hostile under  present knowledge,--then proceed to geograph. distribution,--order of  appearance,--affinities,--morphology &c., &c.    Our theory requires a very gradual introduction of new forms{107}, and  extermination of the old (to which we shall revert). The extermination  of old may sometimes be rapid, but never the introduction. In the groups  descended from common parent, our theory requires a perfect gradation  not differing more than breed<s> of cattle, or potatoes, or cabbages in  forms. I do not mean that a graduated series of animals must have  existed, intermediate between horse, mouse, tapir{108}, elephant [or  fowl and peacock], but that these must have had a common parent, and  between horse and this <?> parent &c., &c., but the common parent may  possibly have differed more from either than the two do now from each  other. Now what evidence of this is there? So perfect gradation in some  departments, that some naturalists have thought that in some large  divisions, if all existing forms were collected, a near approach to  perfect gradation would be made. But such a notion is preposterous with  respect to all, but evidently so with mammals. Other naturalists have  thought this would be so if all the specimens entombed in the strata  were collected{109}. I conceive there is no probability whatever of  this; nevertheless it is certain all the numerous fossil forms fall  in<to>, as Buckland remarks, _not_ present classes, families and genera,  they fall between them: so is it with new discoveries of existing forms.  Most ancient fossils, that is most separated <by> space of time, are most  apt to fall between the classes--(but organisms from those countries  most separated by space also fall between the classes <_e.g._>  Ornithorhyncus?). As far as geological discoveries <go> they tend towards  such gradation{110}. Illustrate it with net. Toxodon,--tibia and  fibula,--dog and otter,--but so utterly improbable is <it>, in _ex. gr._  Pachydermata, to compose series as perfect as cattle, that if, as many  geologists seem to infer, each separate formation presents even an  approach to a consecutive history, my theory must be given up. Even if  it were consecutive, it would only collect series of one district in our  present state of knowledge; but what probability is there that any one  formation during the _immense_ period which has elapsed during each  period will _generally_ present a consecutive history. [Compare number  living at one period to fossils preserved--look at enormous periods of  time.]         {107} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 312, vi. p. 453.         {108} See _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 280, 281, vi. p. 414. The author       uses his experience of pigeons for examples for what he means by       _intermediate_; the instance of the horse and tapir also occurs.         {109} The absence of intermediate forms between living organisms       (and also as regards fossils) is discussed in the _Origin_, Ed. i.       pp. 279, 280, vi. p. 413. In the above discussion there is no       evidence that the author felt this difficulty so strongly as it is       expressed in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 299,--as perhaps \"the most       obvious and gravest objection that can be urged against my theory.\"       But in a rough summary written on the back of the penultimate page       of the MS. he refers to the geological evidence:--\"Evidence, as far       as it does go, is favourable, exceedingly incomplete,--greatest       difficulty on this theory. I am convinced not insuperable.\"       Buckland's remarks are given in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 329, vi. p.       471.         {110} That the evidence of geology, as far as it goes, is       favourable to the theory of descent is claimed in the _Origin_, Ed.       i. pp. 343-345, vi. pp. 490-492. For the reference to _net_ in the       following sentence, see Note 1, p. 48, {Note 161} of this Essay.    Referring only to marine animals, which are obviously most likely to be  preserved, they must live where <?> sediment (of a kind favourable for  preservation, not sand and pebble){111} is depositing quickly and over  large area and must be thickly capped, <illegible> littoral deposits:  for otherwise denudation <will destroy them>,--they must live in a  shallow space which sediment will tend to fill up,--as movement is <in?>  progress if soon brought <?> up <?> subject to denudation,--[if] as  during subsidence favourable, accords with facts of European  deposits{112}, but subsidence apt to destroy agents which produce  sediment{113}.         {111} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 288, vi. p. 422. \"The remains that do       become embedded, if in sand and gravel, will, when the beds are       upraised, generally be dissolved by the percolation of rain-water.\"         {112} The position of the following is not clear:--\"Think of       immense differences in nature of European deposits,--without       interposing new causes,--think of time required by present slow       changes, to cause, on very same area, such diverse deposits,       iron-sand, chalk, sand, coral, clay!\"         {113} The paragraph which ends here is difficult to interpret. In       spite of obscurity it is easy to recognize the general resemblance       to the discussion on the importance of subsidence given in the       _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 290 et seq., vi. pp. 422 et seq.    I believe safely inferred <that> groups of marine <?> fossils only  preserved for future ages where sediment goes on long <and>  continuous<ly> and with rapid but not too rapid deposition in <an> area  of subsidence. In how few places in any one region like Europe will <?>  these contingencies be going on? Hence <?> in past ages mere [gaps]  pages preserved{114}. Lyell's doctrine carried to extreme,--we shall  understand difficulty if it be asked:--what chance of series of  gradation between cattle by <illegible> at age <illegible> as far back  as Miocene{115}? We know then cattle existed. Compare number of  living,--immense duration of each period,--fewness of fossils.         {114} See Note 3, p. 27.         {115} Compare _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 298, vi. p. 437. \"We shall,       perhaps, best perceive the improbability of our being enabled to       connect species by numerous, fine, intermediate, fossil links, by       asking ourselves whether, for instance, geologists at some future       period will be able to prove that our different breeds of cattle,       sheep, horses, and dogs have descended from a single stock or from       several aboriginal stocks.\"    This only refers to consecutiveness of history of organisms of each  formation.    The foregoing argument will show firstly, that formations are distinct  merely from want of fossils <of intermediate beds>, and secondly, that  each formation is full of gaps, has been advanced to account for  _fewness_ of _preserved_ organisms compared to what have lived on the  world. The very same argument explains why in older formations the  organisms appear to come on and disappear suddenly,--but in [later]  tertiary not quite suddenly{116}, in later tertiary gradually,--becoming  rare and disappearing,--some have disappeared within man's time. It is  obvious that our theory requires gradual and nearly uniform  introduction, possibly more sudden extermination,--subsidence of  continent of Australia &c., &c.         {116} The sudden appearance of groups of allied species in the       lowest known fossiliferous strata is discussed in the _Origin_, Ed.       i. p. 306, vi. p. 446. The gradual appearance in the later strata       occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 312, vi. p. 453.    Our theory requires that the first form which existed of each of the  great divisions would present points intermediate between existing ones,  but immensely different.

The trip had already done the man good  and his face wore a brighter look.    Tom and Ned, in the speedy ARROW, cruised along the lakeshores all that  morning.  At noon they went ashore, made a temporary camp and arranged  to spend the night there in the tent.  After this was erected they got  out their fishing tackle and passed the afternoon at that sport, having  such good luck that they provided their own supper without having to  depend on canned stuff.    They lived this life for three days, making a new camp each night,  being favored with good weather, so that they did not have to sleep in  the boat to keep dry.  On the afternoon of the third day Tom, with a  critical glance at the sky, remarked:    \"I shouldn't be surprised if it rained to-morrow, Ned.\"    \"Me either.  It does look sort of hazy, and the wind is in a bad  quarter.\"    \"Then what do you say to heading for the hotel? I fancy dad will be glad  to see us.\"    \"That suits me. We can start camp life again after the storm passes.\"    They started for Sandport that afternoon.  When within about two miles  of the hotel dock Tom saw, just ahead of them, a small motor-boat.  Ned  observed it too and called out:    \"S'pose that's Andy looking for another race?\"    \"No, the boat's too small for his.  We'll put over that way and see who  it is.\"    The other craft did not appear to be moving very rapidly and the ARROW  was soon overhauling it.  As the two chums came nearer they could hear  the puffing of the motor.  Tom listened with critical ears.    \"That machine isn't working right,\" he remarked to his chum.    At that moment there sounded a loud explosion from the other boat and  at the same time there came over the water a shrill cry of alarm.  \"That's a girl in that boat!\" exclaimed Ned.  \"Maybe she's hurt.\"    \"No, the motor only backfired,\" observed Tom.  \"But we'll go over and  see if we can help her.  Perhaps she doesn't understand it.  Girls  don't know much about machinery.\"    A little later the ARROW shot up alongside the other craft, which had  come to a stop.  The two lads could see a girl bending over the motor,  twirling the flywheel and trying to get it started.  \"Can I help you?\"  asked Tom, shutting off the power from his craft.    The young lady glanced up.  Her face was red and she seemed ill at  ease.  At the sight of the young inventor she uttered an exclamation of  relief.    \"Why, Mr. Swift!\" she cried.  \"Oh, I'm in such trouble.  I can't make  the machine work, and I'm afraid it's broken; it exploded.\"    \"Miss Nestor!\" blurted out Tom, more surprised evidently to see his  acquaintance of the runaway again than she was at beholding him.  \"I  didn't know you ran a motor-boat,\" he added.  \"I don't,\" said she  simply and helplessly.  \"That's the trouble, it won't run.\"    \"How comes it that you are up here?\" went on Tom.    \"I am stopping with friends, who have a cottage near the Lakeview  Hotel.  They have a motor-boat and I got Dick Blythe--he's the owner of  this--to show me how to run it.  I thought I knew, and I started out a  little while ago.  At first it went beautifully, but a few minutes ago  it blew up, or--or something dreadful happened.\"    \"Nothing very dreadful, I guess,\" Tom assured her.  \"I think I can fix  it.\"  He got into the other boat and soon saw what the trouble was.  The carburetor had gotten out of adjustment and the gasoline was not  feeding properly.  The young inventor soon had it in order, and,  testing the motor, found that it worked perfectly.    \"Oh, I can't thank you enough,\" cried Miss Nestor with a flash from her  brown eyes that made Tom's heart beat double time.  \"I was afraid I had  damaged the boat, and I knew Dick, who is a sort of second cousin of  mine, would never forgive me.\"    \"There's no harm done,\" Tom assured her.  \"But you had better keep near  us on your way back, that is, if you are going back.\"    \"Oh, indeed I am.  I was frightened when I found I'd come so far away  from shore, and then, when that explosion took place--well, you can  imagine how I felt.  Indeed I will keep near you.  Are you stopping  near here?  If you are, I wish you'd come and see me, you and Mr.  Newton,\" she added, for Tom had introduced his chum.    \"I'll be very glad to,\" answered our hero, and he told how he happened  to be in the neighborhood.  \"I'll give you a few lessons in managing a  boat, if you like,\" he added.    \"Oh, will you?  That will be lovely!  I won't tell Dick about it, and  I'll surprise him some day by showing him how well I can run his boat.\"    \"Good idea,\" commented Tom.    He started the motor for Miss Nestor, having stopped it after his first  test, and then, with the DOT, which was the name of the small boat Miss  Nestor was in, following the larger ARROW, the run back to the hotel  was made.  The young lady turned off near the Lakeview dock to go to  the cottage where she was stopping and the lads tied up at the hotel  boathouse.    \"Yes, we are in for a storm,\" remarked Tom as he and his chum walked up  toward the hotel.  \"I wonder how dad is?  I hope the outing is doing  him good.\"    \"There he comes now,\" observed Ned, and, looking up, Tom saw his father  approaching.  The young inventor was at once struck by the expression  on his parent's face.  Mr. Swift looked worried and Tom anxiously  hastened forward to meet him.    \"What's the matter dad?\" he asked as cheerfully as he could.  \"Have you  been figuring over that gyroscope problem again, against my express  orders?\" and he laughed a little.    \"No, Tom, it's not the gyroscope that's worrying me.\"    \"What is it then?\"    \"Those scoundrels are around again, Tom!\" and Mr. Swift looked  apprehensively about him.    \"You mean the men who stole the turbine model?\"    \"Yes.  I was walking in the woods near the hotel yesterday and I saw  Anson Morse.  He did not see me, for I turned aside as quickly as I had  a glimpse of him.  He was talking to another man.\"    \"What sort of a man?\"    \"Well, an ordinary enough individual, but I noticed that he had  tattooed on the little finger of his left hand a blue ring.\"    \"Happy Harry, the tramp!\" exclaimed Tom.  \"What can he and Morse be  doing here?\"    \"I don't know, Tom, but I'm worried.  I wish I was back home.  I'm  afraid something may happen to some of my inventions.  I want to go  back to Shopton, Tom.\"    \"Nonsense, dad.  Don't worry just because you saw some of your former  enemies.  Everything is all right at home.  Mrs. Baggert and Garret  Jackson will look after things.  But, if you like, I, can find out for  you how matters are.\"    \"How, Tom?\"    \"By taking a run down there in my motor-boat.  I can do it to-morrow  and get back by night, if I start early.  Then you will not worry.\"    \"All right, Tom; I wish you would.  Come up to my room and we will talk  it over.  I'd rather leave you go than telephone, as I don't like to  talk of my business over the wire if I can avoid it.\"          CHAPTER X    A CRY FOR HELP      \"Now, dad, tell me all about it,\" requested Tom when he and Ned were in  Mr. Swift's apartment at the hotel, safe from the rain that was  falling.  \"How did you happen to see Anson Morse and Happy Harry?\" My  old readers will doubtless remember that the latter was the disguised  tramp who was so vindictive toward Tom, while Morse was the man who  endeavored to sneak in Mr. Swift's shop and steal a valuable invention.    \"Well, Tom,\" proceeded the inventor, \"there isn't much to tell.  I was  out walking in the woods yesterday, and when I was behind a clump of  bushes I heard voices.  I looked out and there I saw the two men.\"    \"At first I thought they were trailing me, but I saw that they had not  seen me, and I didn't see how they could know I was in the  neighborhood.  So I quietly made my way back to the hotel.\"    \"Could you hear what they were saying?\"    \"Not all, but they seemed angry over something.  The man with the blue  ring on his finger asked the other man whether Murdock had been heard  from.\"    \"Who is Murdock?\"    \"I don't know, unless he is another member of the gang or unless that  is an assumed name.\"    \"It may be that.  What else did you hear?\"    \"The man we know as Morse replied that he hadn't heard from him, but  that he suspected Murdock was playing a double game.  Then the  tramp--Happy Harry--asked this question: 'Have you any clew to the  sparkler?' And Morse answered: 'No, but I think Murdock has hid it  somewhere and is trying to get away with it without giving us our  share.' Then the two men walked away, and I came back to the hotel,\"  finished Mr. Swift.    \"Sparkler,\" murmured Tom.  \"I wonder what that can be?\"    \"That's a slang word for diamonds,\" suggested Ned.    \"So it is.  In that case, dad, I think we have nothing to worry about.  Those fellows must be going to commit a diamond robbery or perhaps it  has already taken place.\"    The inventor seemed relieved at this theory of his son.  His face  brightened and he said: \"If they are going to commit a robbery, Tom, we  ought to notify the police.\"    \"But if they said that 'Murdock,' whoever he is, had the sparkler and  was trying to get away with it without giving them their share,  wouldn't that indicate that the robbery had already taken place?\" asked  Ned.    \"That's so,\" agreed Tom.  \"But it won't do any harm to tell the hotel  detective that suspicious characters are around, no matter if the robbery  has been committed.  Then he can be on the lookout.  But I don't think we  have anything to worry about, dad.  Still, if you like, I'll take a run  down to the house to see that everything is all right, though I'm sure  it will be found that we have nothing to be alarmed over.\"    \"Well, I will be more relieved if you do,\" said the inventor, \"However,  suppose we have a good supper now and you boys can stay at the hotel  to-ni"]]]
