It is very common for those who marry young to die young.    From statistics which have been carefully compiled, it is proven that  the first labors of very young mothers are much more painful, tedious,  and dangerous to life, than others. As wives, they are frequently  visited either with absolute sterility, and all their lives must bear  the reproach of barren women, or, what to many is hardly less  distasteful, they have an excessively numerous family.    What adds to their sufferings in the latter event, is that the children  of such marriages are rarely healthy. They are feeble, sickly,  undersized, often with some fault of mind or body, which is a cross to  them and their parents all their lives. They inherit more readily the  defects of their ancestors, and, as a rule, die at earlier years than  the progeny of better-timed unions.    These considerations are formidable enough, it would seem, to prevent  young girls from marrying, without the need of a law, as exists in some  countries. Moreover, they are not imaginary, but real, as many a woman  finds out to her cost.    The objections to marriage after the age of twenty-five are less cogent.  They extend only to the woman herself. She should know that the first  labors of wives over thirty are nearly _twice_ as fatal as those between  twenty and twenty-five. Undoubtedly nature points to the period between  the twentieth and twenty-fifth year as the fittest one for marriage in  the woman.          _LOVE._      ITS POWER ON HUMANITY.    Love, pure love, true love, what can we say of it? The dream of youth;  the cherished reminiscence of age; celebrated in the songs of poets;  that which impels the warrior to his most daring deeds; which the  inspired prophet chooses to typify the holiest sentiments,--what new  thing is it possible to say about this theme?    Think for a moment on the history or the literature of the world. Ask  the naturalist to reveal the mysteries of life; let the mythologist  explain the origin and meaning of all unrevealed religions; look within  at the promptings of your own spirit, and this whole life of ours will  appear to you as one grand epithalamium.    The profoundest of English poets has said--        'All thoughts, all passions, all delights,        Whatever stirs this mortal frame,      All are but ministers of Love,        And feed his sacred flame.'    That life which is devoid of love is incomplete, sterile,  unsatisfactory. It fails of its chiefest end. Nature, in anger, blots it  out sooner, and it passes like the shadow of a cloud, leaving no trace  behind. Admirable as it may be in other respects, to the eye of the  statesman, the physician, the lover of his species, it remains but a  fragment, a torso.    Love is one thing to a woman, another to a man. To him, said Madame de  Stael, it is an episode; to her, it is the whole history of life. A  thousand distractions divert man. Fame, riches, power, pleasure, all  struggle in his bosom to displace the sentiment of love. They are its  rivals, not rarely its masters. But woman knows no such distractions.  One passion only sits enthroned in her bosom; one only idol is enshrined  in her heart, knowing no rival, no successor. This passion is love! This  idol is its object.    This is not fancy, not rhetoric; it is the language of cold and exact  science, pronounced from the chair of history, from the bureau of the  statistician, from the dissecting table of the anatomist. We shall  gather up their well-weighed words, and present them, not as fancy  sketches, but as facts.    This deep, all-absorbing, single, wondrous love of woman, is something  that man cannot understand. This sea of unfathomed depth is to him a  mystery. The shallow mind sees of it nothing but the rippling waves, the  unstable foam-crests dashing hither and thither, the playful ripples of  the surface, and, blind to the still and measureless waters beneath,  calls woman capricious, uncertain,--_varium et mutabile_. But the  thinker and seer, undeceived by such externals, knows that beneath this  seeming change is stability unequaled in the stronger sex, a power of  will to which man is a stranger, a devotion and purpose which strike him  with undefined awe.    Therefore, in the myths and legends which the early races framed to  express their notions of divine things,--the Fates, who spin and snip  the thread of life; the Norns, who        Lay down laws,      And select life      For the children of time--      The destinies of men,--    are always females. The seeresses and interpreters of oracles--those  who, like the witch of Endor, could summon from the grave the shades of  the departed--were women.    Therefore, also, modern infidelity, going back, as it ever does, to the  ignorance of the past, and holding it up as something new, makes woman  the only deity. Comte and his disciples, having reasoned away all gods,  angels, and spirits, and unable to still the craving for something to  adore, agree to meet once a week to worship--woman. The French  revolutionists, having shut up the churches and abolished God by a  decree of the Convention, set up in His stead--a woman.    We could never exhaust this phase of world-history. Everywhere we see  the unexpected hand of Love moulding, fashioning all things. The  fortunes of the individual, the fate of nations, the destinies of races,  are guided by this invisible thread. Let us push our inquiries as to the  nature of this all-powerful agent.      WHAT IS LOVE?    It has a divided nature. As we have an immortal soul, but a body of  clay; as the plant roots itself in decaying earth, but spreads its  flowers in glorious sunlight,--so love has a physiological and a moral  nature. It is rooted in that unconscious law of life which bids us  perpetuate our kind; which guards over the conservation of life; which  enforces, with ceaseless admonition, that first precept which God gave  to man before the gates of Eden had been closed upon him: 'Be thou  fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.' Nothing but a spurious  delicacy, or an ignorance of facts, can prevent our full recognition  that love looks to marriage, and marriage to offspring, as a natural  sequence.    Do we ask proofs of this? We have them in abundance. Those unfortunate  beings who are chosen by Oriental custom to guard the seraglios undergo  a mutilation which disqualifies them from becoming parents. Soon all  traces of passion, all regard for the other sex, all sentiments of love,  totally disappear. The records of medicine contain not a few cases where  disease had rendered it necessary to remove the ovaries from women. At  once a change took place in voice, appearance, and mind. They spoke like  men, a slender beard commenced on their faces, a masculine manner was  conspicuous in all their motions, and every thought of sexual love  passed away for ever. These are the results in every case. What do they  signify? Undoubtedly that the passion of love is dependent upon the  capacity of having offspring, and that such was the intention of Nature  in implanting in our bosom this all-powerful sentiment.    But this is not all. Nature, as beneficent to those who obey her  precepts as she is merciless to those who disregard them, has added to  this sentiment of love a physical pleasure in its gratification,--an  honourable and proper pleasure, which none but the hypocrite or the  ascetic will affect to condemn, none but the coarse or the lewd will  regard as the object of love. There is, indeed, a passion which is the  love of the body. We call it by its proper name of _lust_. There is  another emotion, for which the rich tongue of the ancient Greeks had a  word, to which we have nothing to correspond. Call it, if you will,  Platonic love, and define it to be an exalted friendship. But understand  that neither the one nor the other is _love_, in the true sense of the  word, and that _both_ are inferior to it.    Does the father, watching, with moistened eyes, his child at its  mother's breast; does the husband, bending with solicitude over the  sick-bed of his wife; does the wife, clinging to her husband through  evil report and good report, through broken fortunes and failing health,  indicate no loftier emotion than _lust_, no warmer sentiment than  _friendship_? What ignorance, what perversity is so gross as not to  perceive something here nobler than either? Do you say that such scenes  are, alas, rare? We deny it. We see them daily in the streets; we meet  them daily in our rounds. Admitted, by our calling, to the sacred  precincts of many houses in the trying hours of sickness and death, we  speak advisedly, and know that this is the prevailing meaning of love in  domestic life.    A warm, rich affection blesses the one who gives and the one who  receives. Character developes under it as the plant beneath the  sunlight. Happiness is an unknown word without it. Love and marriage are  the only normal conditions of life. Without them, both man and woman for  ever miss the best part of themselves. They suffer more, they sin more,  they perish sooner. These are not hasty assertions. As a social law, let  it be well understood that science pronounces that      LOVE IS A NECESSITY.    The single life is forced upon many of both sexes, in our present social  condition. Many choose it from motives of economy, from timidity, or as  a religious step, pleasing to God. The latter is a notion which probably  arose from a belief that, somehow, celibacy, strictly observed, means  chastity. It simply means continence. The chastest persons have been,  and are, not the virgins and celibates, but the married. When this truth  is known better, we shall have fewer sects and more religion.    We know women who refrain from marrying to keep out of trouble. The old  saying is, that every sigh drives a nail in one's coffin. They are not  going to worry themselves to death"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24003"],[0,"Confessions of a Book-Lover (#10)"],[1,"of art and  life. One would steel oneself against the fallacy that art, true art,  might exist only for art's sake, when one had read \"Sesame and Lilies\"  and \"The Stones of Venice.\" Those wise men who make literary  \"selections\" for the young have done well to include in their volumes  that graphic description, so carefully modulated in tone, of the  Cathedral of St. Mark. Its only fault is that it comes too near to being  prose poetry; and discriminating readers who ponder over it will find  some epithets possible only to a writer who was an artist in lines and  pigments before he began to paint with the pen.    Ruskin opened our eyes rather violently to some aspects of life which  we, the young, did not know; for the young after all learn very little  by intuition. They must be taught things. This is perhaps an excuse for  those vagaries in youth, those seemingly inexplicable adventures which  shock the old who have forgotten what it is to be young.          CHAPTER II    POETS AND POETRY    _France--Of Maurice de Gu['e]rin_      In 1872, the attention of readers was forced on a few great names. These  were generally the names of Frenchmen. The sympathy of Americans during  the Franco-Prussian War had been with France, and during the latter days  of the French Empire, before the war, Americans had been much more  interested in France than in any other part of the world. There were  letters from Paris in the newspapers. The Empress Eug['e]nie and her  coterie at the Tuileries, the Operas of Offenbach, and the gossip about  literary magnets of the time, which included a great deal of Victor  Hugo, had been a constant subject of conversations.    One could buy French books easily in Philadelphia; and the Mercantile  Library--now dreadfully shorn of its former pretensions, reduced in  size, no longer so comfortable, so delightfully easy of access as to  its shelves--had an excellent collection of volumes in French.    How often in later life I blessed the discriminating collectors of that  library! Nothing worth while at that time, even \"L'Homme\" of Ernest  Hello, seemed to have been left out; I fear that I was not always guided  by the critics of the period. I found Am['e]d['e]e Achard as interesting as  Octave Feuillet; George Sand bored me; I could never get through even  \"La Petite Fadette,\" although the critics were constantly recommending  her for her \"vitality.\" I found Madame de G['e]rardin's \"La Femme qui  D['e]teste Son Mari\" one of the cleverest plays I had yet read. I have not  seen it since; but, outside of some of the pieces of Augier, it seemed  to me to be the best bit of construction I knew, and the human interest  and the suspense were so admirably kept up. There were some plays by  Octave Feuillet--\"Redemption\" was one and \"Le Roman d'un Jeune Homme  Pauvre,\" which divided my admiration with the management of \"Adrienne  Lecouvreur,\" by Scribe, and \"Mademoiselle de la Seigli[`e]re,\" by Jules  Sandeau. The French playwrights of to-day have not even the technique of  their predecessors.    At this time I was very royalist, an infuriated partisan of the Comte de  Chambord--Henry V., as a few of us preferred to call him. And this  reminds me of my partisanship in things English--if I may turn for the  moment from things French--and of a little incident not without humour.  I was ardently devoted to the cause of the Stuarts, and was for a time  attached to the White Rose Society, whose correspondents in England  invariably sent their letters, with the stamp turned upside down, to  indicate their contempt for the Guelf dynasty. But when, at a small and  frugal reunion at Mr. Green's restaurant in Philadelphia, our host--he  was an American Walsh of the family of de Serrant--insisted on waving  his glass of beer over the finger bowls, to insinuate that we were  drinking to the last of the Stuarts across the water--whoever he might  be--and another member suggested that, if it were not for the brutal  Hanoverians on the throne of England, we, in the British Colonies, might  be still enjoying the blessedness of being ruled by a descendant of Mary  Stuart, I resigned! I was still devoutly faithful to the divine Mary of  Scotland; but I would not have her mixed up in American politics!    Octave Feuillet satisfied my taste for elegance. Some of his people were  not above reproach--notice the lady in \"Redemption,\" who becomes  suddenly converted to a belief in God because her twenty-fifth lover is  suddenly restored to her. I thought that, though he was somewhat  corrupted by the influence of the Tuileries, he was socially so  admirably correct.    Everybody at this time talked of Renan. This went by me as an idle  dream, for I could never understand why anybody should take a man  seriously who was palpably wrong. To-day, when Renan's \"Life of Jesus\"  seems almost forgotten, it is strange to recall the fury of interest it  excited in the seventies. Louis Veuillot interested me much more than  Renan, whom I avoided deliberately because I understood that he had  attacked the Christian religion. Now, Louis Veuillot, in \"Les Odeurs de  Paris\" and \"Les Parfums de Rome\" delighted me almost beyond bounds. I  did often wonder how such a good man as Louis Veuillot could have  acquired such un-Christian use of language. When he announced that if  his wife wrote such novels as George Sand, he would hesitate to  recognize her children, it seemed to me that he had gone too far--still  it was a pleasant thing to shock the chaste Philadelphians by quoting  these trenchant words when the novels of the lady in question were  mentioned with rapt admiration.    But to come to the poets!    It was, I think, through the reading of the \"Lundis\" of Sainte-Beuve  that I discovered Maurice de Gu['e]rin. He almost drove my beloved Keats  from my mind. Somebody warned me against Maurice de Gu['e]rin on the ground  of his pantheism. I had been warned against the poems of Emerson on  account of their paganism; but as I had been brought up on Virgil, I  looked on pantheism and paganism as rather orthodox compared to Renan's  negation and the horrors of Calvinism. And, after all, the Catholic  Church had retained so much that was Jewish and pagan that I was sure to  find myself almost as much at home among the pagans as I was in the Old  Testament at times.    Keats and Maurice de Gu['e]rin will be always associated in my mind. I  discovered them about the same time. I had been solemnly told by an  eminent Philadelphian that Wordsworth was the only poet worth  considering, after Shakespeare, and that Keats had no intellectual value  whatever. But I was not looking for intellectual value. I mixed up the  intellect with a kind of scientific jargon about protoplasm and natural  selection and the survival of the fittest, and bathybius, which was then  all the fashion; so I promptly devoted myself to De Gu['e]rin.    I had already found great pleasure in the \"Journal\" of his sister  Eug['e]nie. The \"Journal\" ought never to be allowed to go out of fashion,  and probably it is only out of fashion in those circles which Mr.  Mencken so scorns, that devote themselves to imitations of Marie  Bashkirtseff or Sarah McLean. I had begun to enjoy the flavour of the  calm life of Eug['e]nie at La Cayla when I found it necessary, in order to  understand the allusions, to plunge again into the journals, letters,  and poems of Maurice de Gu['e]rin. Thus it happened that I had fallen upon  \"Le Centaure\" first. It is very short, as everybody knows. It was to me  the most appealing poem I had ever read.    Keats's Greece seems somehow to be a Greece too full of modern colour,  too unclassical. This was a mistake, of course, due to the fact that all  my Greek reading had been filtered through professors and textbooks; and  all my Greek seeing had been centred on pale white statues. It did not  occur to me then--at least I did not know it--that the great Greek  statues were not colourless, and that at Delphi there were statues that  glowed with the hues of life. Strange to say, though \"Le Centaure\"  seemed to me to be Greek in the classical sense, yet it palpitated with  human emotion. Who that has read it can forget the simplicity of the  opening? Says the Centaur:         I received my birth in the fastnesses of these mountains. As the       stream of this valley of which the primitive drops run from the       rocks which weep in a deep grotto, the first moment of my life fell       among the darkness of a secluded place in which the silence was not       troubled. When our mothers come near the time of their deliverance,       they flee towards the caverns, and in the depth of the most remote,       in the darkest of shadows, their children are born without a moan       and the fruits of their womb are as silent as themselves. Their       strong milk enables us to overcome without weakness or a doubtful       struggle the first difficulties of life; however, we go out from       our caves later than you from your cradles. It is understood among       us that we must hide and envelope the first moments of existence as       days filled by the gods. My growth followed its course almost among       the shadows where I was born. The depth of my living place was so       lost in the shadow of the mountain that I would not have known       where the opening was if rushing sometimes into this opening the       winds had not passed about me certain movements suddenly and       refreshing breezes. Sometimes, too, my mother came back carrying       the perfume of the valleys, or dripping with the waves of the water       she frequented. Now these returns of hers gave me no knowledge of       the valleys or the stream, but their suggestions disquieted my       spirit, and I paced agitatedly in my shades.    After all, it requires leisure to enjoy fully the writings of Eug['e]nie de  Gu['e]rin and her brother--I inevitably think of this brother and sister"]]]
