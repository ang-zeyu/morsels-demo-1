Above the steam the monarch bent,  And, as he smelt the fragrant scent,  In time and order drove afar  All error that his hopes could mar.  Then sixteen priests together came  And cast into the sacred flame  The severed members of the horse,  Made ready all in ordered course.  On piles of holy Fig-tree raised  The meaner victims' bodies blazed:  The steed, of all the creatures slain,  Alone required a pile of cane.  Three days, as is by law decreed,  Lasted that Offering of the Steed.  The Chatushtom began the rite,  And when the sun renewed his light,  The Ukthya followed: after came  The Atiratra's holy flame.  These were the rites, and many more  Arranged by light of holy lore,  The Aptoryam of mighty power,  And, each performed in proper hour,  The Abhijit and Visvajit  With every form and service fit;  And with the sacrifice at night  The Jyotishtom and Ayus rite.(103)    The task was done, as laws prescribe:  The monarch, glory of his tribe,  Bestowed the land in liberal grants  Upon the sacred ministrants.  He gave the region of the east,  His conquest, to the Hotri priest.  The west, the celebrant obtained:  The south, the priest presiding gained:  The northern region was the share  Of him who chanted forth the prayer,(104)  Thus did each priest obtain his meed  At the great Slaughter of the Steed,  Ordained, the best of all to be,  By self-existent deity.  Ikshvaku's son with joyful mind  This noble fee to each assigned,  But all the priests with one accord  Addressed that unpolluted lord:  \"Tis thine alone to keep the whole  Of this broad earth in firm control.  No gift of lands from thee we seek:  To guard these realms our hands were weak.  On sacred lore our days are spent:  Let other gifts our wants content.\"      The chief of old Ikshvaku's line  Gave them ten hundred thousand kine,  A hundred millions of fine gold,  The same in silver four times told.  But every priest in presence there  With one accord resigned his share.  To Saint Vasishtha, high of soul,  And Rishyasring they gave the whole.  That largess pleased those Brahmans well,  Who bade the prince his wishes tell.  Then Dasaratha, mighty king,  Made answer thus to Rishyasring:  \"O holy Hermit, of thy grace,  Vouchsafe the increase of my race.\"  He spoke; nor was his prayer denied:  The best of Brahmans thus replied:  \"Four sons, O Monarch, shall be thine,  Upholders of thy royal line.\"          Canto XIV. Ravan Doomed.        The saint, well read in holy lore,  Pondered awhile his answer o'er,  And thus again addressed the king,  His wandering thoughts regathering:  \"Another rite will I begin  Which shall the sons thou cravest win,  Where all things shall be duly sped  And first Atharva texts be read.\"      Then by Vibhandak's gentle son  Was that high sacrifice begun,  The king's advantage seeking still  And zealous to perform his will.  Now all the Gods had gathered there,  Each one for his allotted share:  Brahma, the ruler of the sky,  Sthanu, Narayan, Lord most high,  And holy Indra men might view  With Maruts(105) for his retinue;  The heavenly chorister, and saint,  And spirit pure from earthly taint,  With one accord had sought the place  The high-souled monarch's rite to grace.  Then to the Gods who came to take  Their proper share the hermit spake:  \"For you has Dasaratha slain  The votive steed, a son to gain;  Stern penance-rites the king has tried,  And in firm faith on you relied,  And now with undiminished care  A second rite would fain prepare.  But, O ye Gods, consent to grant  The longing of your supplicant.  For him beseeching hands I lift,  And pray you all to grant the gift,  That four fair sons of high renown  The offerings of the king may crown.\"  They to the hermit's son replied:  \"His longing shall be gratified.  For, Brahman, in most high degree  We love the king and honour thee.\"      These words the Gods in answer said,  And vanished thence by Indra led.  Thus to the Lord, the worlds who made,  The Immortals all assembled prayed:  \"O Brahma, mighty by thy grace,  Ravan, who rules the giant race,  Torments us in his senseless pride,  And penance-loving saints beside.  For thou well pleased in days of old  Gavest the boon that makes him bold,  That God nor demon e'er should kill  His charmed life, for so thy will.  We, honouring that high behest,  Bear all his rage though sore distressed.  That lord of giants fierce and fell  Scourges the earth and heaven and hell.  Mad with thy boon, his impious rage  Smites saint and bard and God and sage.  The sun himself withholds his glow,  The wind in fear forbears to blow;  The fire restrains his wonted heat  Where stand the dreaded Ravan's feet,  And, necklaced with the wandering wave,  The sea before him fears to rave.  Kuvera's self in sad defeat  Is driven from his blissful seat.  We see, we feel the giant's might,  And woe comes o'er us and affright.  To thee, O Lord, thy suppliants pray  To find some cure this plague to stay.\"      Thus by the gathered Gods addressed  He pondered in his secret breast,  And said: \"One only way I find  To slay this fiend of evil mind.  He prayed me once his life to guard  From demon, God, and heavenly bard,  And spirits of the earth and air,  And I consenting heard his prayer.  But the proud giant in his scorn  Recked not of man of woman born.  None else may take his life away,  But only man the fiend may slay.\"  The Gods, with Indra at their head,  Rejoiced to hear the words he said.  Then crowned with glory like a flame,  Lord Vishnu to the council came;  His hands shell, mace, and discus bore,  And saffron were the robes he wore.  Riding his eagle through the crowd,  As the sun rides upon a cloud,  With bracelets of fine gold, he came  Loud welcomed by the Gods' acclaim.  His praise they sang with one consent,  And cried, in lowly reverence bent:  \"O Lord whose hand fierce Madhu(106) slew,  Be thou our refuge, firm and true;  Friend of the suffering worlds art thou,  We pray thee help thy suppliants now.\"  Then Vishnu spake: \"Ye Gods, declare,  What may I do to grant your prayer?\"      \"King Dasaratha,\" thus cried they,  \"Fervent in penance many a day,  The sacrificial steed has slain,  Longing for sons, but all in vain.  Now, at the cry of us forlorn,  Incarnate as his seed be born.  Three queens has he: each lovely dame  Like Beauty, Modesty, or Fame.  Divide thyself in four, and be  His offspring by these noble three.  Man's nature take, and slay in fight  Ravan who laughs at heavenly might:  This common scourge, this rankling thorn  Whom the three worlds too long have borne  For Ravan in the senseless pride  Of might unequalled has defied  The host of heaven, and plagues with woe  Angel and bard and saint below,  Crushing each spirit and each maid  Who plays in Nandan's(107) heavenly shade.  O conquering Lord, to thee we bow;  Our surest hope and trust art thou.  Regard the world of men below,  And slay the Gods' tremendous foe.\"      When thus the suppliant Gods had prayed,  His wise reply Narayan(108) made:  \"What task demands my presence there,  And whence this dread, ye Gods declare.\"      The Gods replied: \"We fear, O Lord,  Fierce Ravan, ravener abhorred.  Be thine the glorious task, we pray,  In human form this fiend to slay.  By thee of all the Blest alone  This sinner may be overthrown.  He gained by penance long and dire  The favour of the mighty Sire.  Then He who every gift bestows  Guarded the fiend from heavenly foes,  And gave a pledge his life that kept  From all things living, man except.  On him thus armed no other foe  Than man may deal the deadly blow.  Assume, O King, a mortal birth,  And strike the demon to the earth.\"      Then Vishnu, God of Gods, the Lord  Supreme by all the worlds adored,  To Brahma and the suppliants spake:  \"Dismiss your fear: for your dear sake  In battle will I smite him dead,  The cruel fiend, the Immortal's dread.  And lords and ministers and all  His kith and kin with him shall fall.  Then, in the world of mortal men,  Ten thousand years and hundreds ten  I as a human king will reign,  And guard the earth as my domain.\"      God, saint, and nymph, and minstrel throng  With heavenly voices raised their song  In hymns of triumph to the God  Whose conquering feet on Madhu trod:    \"Champion of Gods, as man appear,      This cruel Ravan slay,    The thorn that saints and hermits fear,      The plague that none can stay.    In savage fury uncontrolled      His pride for ever grows:    He dares the Lord of Gods to hold      Among his deadly foes.\"          Canto XV. The Nectar.      When wisest Vishnu thus had given  His promise to the Gods of heaven,  He pondered in his secret mind  A suited place of birth to find,  Then he decreed, the lotus-eyed,  In four his being to divide,  And Dasaratha, gracious king,  He chose as sire from whom to spring.  That childless prince of high renown,  Who smote in war his foemen down,  At that same time with utmost care  Prepared the rite that wins an heir.(109)  Then Vishnu, fain on earth to dwell,  Bade the Almighty Sire farewell,  And vanished while a reverent crowd  Of Gods and saints in worship bowed.      The monarch watched the sacred rite,  When a vast form of awful might,  Of matchless splendour, strength, and size  Was manifest before his eyes.  From forth the sacrificial flame,  Dark, robed in red, the being came.  His voice was drumlike, loud and low,  His face suffused with rosy glow.  Like a huge lion's mane appeared  The long locks of his hair and beard.  He shone with many a lucky sign,  And many an ornament divine;  A towering mountain in his height,  A tiger in his gait and might.  No precious mine more rich could be,  No burning flame more bright than he.  His arms embraced in loving hold,  Like a dear wife, a vase of gold  Whose silver lining held a draught  Of nectar as in heaven is quaffed:  A vase so vast, so bright to view,  They scarce could count the vision true.

A stray girl passing through the hall called out, \"Ruth, Miss Siviter  wishes to see you about something in Room C.\"    Ruth got up quickly. She was glad to get away, for it seemed to her  that in another minute she would break down altogether.    Carol Golden hardly noticed her departure. She gathered up her letters  and went abstractedly to her room, unheeding a gay call for \"Golden  Carol\" from a group of girls in the corridor. Maud Russell was not in  and Carol was glad. She wanted to be alone and fight down that sudden  idea.    \"It is ridiculous to think of it,\" she said aloud, with a petulance  very unusual in Golden Carol, whose disposition was as sunny as her  looks. \"Why, I simply cannot. I have always been longing to ask Maud  to visit me, and now that the chance has come I am not going to throw  it away. I am very sorry for Ruth, of course. It must be dreadful to  be all alone like that. But it isn't my fault. And she is so fearfully  quiet and dowdy--what would they all think of her at home? Frank and  Jack would make such fun of her. I shall ask Maud just as soon as she  comes in.\"    Maud did come in presently, but Carol did not give her the invitation.  Instead, she was almost snappish to her idol, and the Princess soon  went out again in something of a huff.    \"Oh, dear,\" cried Carol, \"now I've offended her. What has got into me?  What a disagreeable thing a conscience is, although I'm sure I don't  know why mine should be prodding me so! I don't want to invite Ruth  Mannering home with me for the holidays, but I feel exactly as if I  should not have a minute's peace of mind all the time if I didn't.  Mother would think it all right, of course. She would not mind if Ruth  dressed in calico and never said anything but yes and no. But how the  boys would laugh! I simply won't do it, conscience or no conscience.\"    In view of this decision it was rather strange that the next morning,  Carol Golden went down to Ruth Mannering's lonely little room on  Corridor Two and said, \"Ruth, will you go home with me for the  holidays? Mother wrote me to invite anyone I wished to. Don't say you  can't come, dear, because you must.\"    Carol never, as long as she lived, forgot Ruth's face at that moment.    \"It was absolutely transfigured,\" she said afterwards. \"I never saw  anyone look so happy in my life.\"           *       *       *       *       *    A fortnight later unwonted silence reigned at Oaklawn. The girls were  scattered far and wide, and Ruth Mannering and Carol Golden were at  the latter's home.    Carol was a very much surprised girl. Under the influence of kindness  and pleasure Ruth seemed transformed into a different person. Her  shyness and reserve melted away in the sunny atmosphere of the Golden  home. Mrs. Golden took her into her motherly heart at once; and as for  Frank and Jack, whose verdict Carol had so dreaded, they voted Ruth  \"splendid.\" She certainly got along very well with them; and if she  did not make the social sensation that pretty Maud Russell might have  made, the Goldens all liked her and Carol was content.    \"Just four days more,\" sighed Carol one afternoon, \"and then we must  go back to Oaklawn. Can you realize it, Ruth?\"    Ruth looked up from her book with a smile. Even in appearance she had  changed. There was a faint pink in her cheeks and a merry light in her  eyes.    \"I shall not be sorry to go back to work,\" she said. \"I feel just like  it because I have had so pleasant a time here that it has heartened me  up for next term. I think it will be very different from last. I begin  to see that I kept to myself too much and brooded over fancied  slights.\"    \"And then you are to room with me since Maud is not coming back,\" said  Carol. \"What fun we shall have. Did you ever toast marshmallows over  the gas? Why, I declare, there is Mr. Swift coming up the walk. Look,  Ruth! He is the richest man in Westleigh.\"    Ruth peeped out of the window over Carol's shoulder.    \"He reminds me of somebody,\" she said absently, \"but I can't think who  it is. Of course, I have never seen him before. What a good face he  has!\"    \"He is as good as he looks,\" said Carol, enthusiastically. \"Next to  Father, Mr. Swift is the nicest man in the world. I have always been  quite a pet of his. His wife is dead, and so is his only daughter. She  was a lovely girl and died only two years ago. It nearly broke Mr.  Swift's heart. And he has lived alone ever since in that great big  house up at the head of Warner Street, the one you admired so, Ruth,  the last time we were uptown. There's the bell for the second time,  Mary can't have heard it. I'll go myself.\"    As Carol showed the caller into the room, Ruth rose to leave and thus  came face to face with him. Mr. Swift started perceptibly.    \"Mr. Swift, this is my school friend, Miss Mannering,\" said Carol.    Mr. Swift seemed strangely agitated as he took Ruth's timidly offered  hand.    \"My dear young lady,\" he said hurriedly, \"I am going to ask you what  may seem a very strange question. What was your mother's name?\"    \"Agnes Hastings,\" answered Ruth in surprise. And then Carol really  thought that Mr. Swift had gone crazy, for he drew Ruth into his arms  and kissed her.    \"I knew it,\" he said. \"I was sure you were Agnes' daughter, for you  are the living image of what she was when I last saw her. Child, you  don't know me, but I am your Uncle Robert. Your mother was my  half-sister.\"    \"Oh, Mr. Swift!\" cried Carol, and then she ran for her mother.    Ruth turned pale and dropped into a chair, and Mr. Swift sat down  beside her.    \"To think that I have found you at last, child. How puzzled you look.  Did your mother never speak of me? How is she? Where is she?\"    \"Mother died last year,\" said Ruth.    \"Poor Agnes! And I never knew! Don't cry, little girl. I want you to  tell me all about it. She was much younger than I was, and when our  mother died my stepfather went away and took her with him. I remained  with my father's people and eventually lost all trace of my sister. I  was a poor boy then, but things have looked up with me and I have  often tried to find her.\"    By this time Carol had returned with her father and mother, and there  was a scene--laughing, crying, explaining--and I don't really know  which of the two girls was the more excited, Carol or Ruth. As for Mr.  Swift, he was overjoyed to find his niece and wanted to carry her off  with him then and there, but Mrs. Golden insisted on her finishing her  visit. When the question of returning to Oaklawn came up, Mr. Swift  would not hear of it at first, but finally yielded to Carol's  entreaties and Ruth's own desire.    \"I shall graduate next year, Uncle, and then I can come back to you  for good.\"    That evening when Ruth was alone in her room, trying to collect her  thoughts and realize that the home and love that she had so craved  were really to be hers at last, Golden Carol was with her mother in  the room below, talking it all over.    \"Just think, Mother, if I had not asked Ruth to come here, this would  not have happened. And I didn't want to, I wanted to ask Maud so much,  and I was dreadfully disappointed when I couldn't--for I really  couldn't. I could not help remembering the look in Ruth's eyes when  she said that she had no home to go to, and so I asked her instead of  Maud. How dreadful it would have been if I hadn't.\"          Detected by the Camera      One summer I was attacked by the craze for amateur photography. It  became chronic afterwards, and I and my camera have never since been  parted. We have had some odd adventures together, and one of the most  novel of our experiences was that in which we played the part of chief  witness against Ned Brooke.    I may say that my name is Amy Clarke, and that I believe I am  considered the best amateur photographer in our part of the country.  That is all I need tell you about myself.    Mr. Carroll had asked me to photograph his place for him when the  apple orchards were in bloom. He has a picturesque old-fashioned  country house behind a lawn of the most delightful old trees and  flanked on each side by the orchards. So I went one June afternoon,  with all my accoutrements, prepared to \"take\" the Carroll  establishment in my best style.    Mr. Carroll was away but was expected home soon, so we waited for him,  as all the family wished to be photographed under the big maple at the  front door. I prowled around among the shrubbery at the lower end of  the lawn and, after a great deal of squinting from various angles, I  at last fixed upon the spot from which I thought the best view of the  house might be obtained. Then Gertie and Lilian Carroll and I got into  the hammocks and swung at our leisure, enjoying the cool breeze  sweeping through the maples.    Ned Brooke was hanging around as usual, watching us furtively. Ned was  one of the hopeful members of a family that lived in a tumble-down  shanty just across the road from the Carrolls. They were wretchedly  poor, and old Brooke, as he was called, and Ned were employed a good  deal by Mr. Carroll--more out of charity than anything else, I fancy.    The Brookes had a rather shady reputation. They were notoriously lazy,  and it was suspected that their line of distinction between their own  and their neighbours' goods was not very clearly drawn. Many people  censured Mr. Carroll for encouraging them at all, but he was too  kind-hearted to let them suffer actual want and, as a consequence, one  or the other of them was always dodging about his place.    Ned was a lank, tow-headed youth of about fourteen, with shifty,  twinkling eyes that could never look you straight in the face. His  appearance was anything but prepossessing, and I always felt, when I  looked at him, that if anyone wanted to do a piece of shady work by  proxy, Ned Brooke"]]]
