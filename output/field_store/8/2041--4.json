After reaching  the point illustrated in the diagram, the needle draws the thread  through, thus making a firm knot round the loop. This completes the  picot, the bar is then buttonholed to the end. The second picot is made  in much the same way; instead, however, of putting the needle as the  diagram shows, bring the thread up through the centre of the loop, then  round under the pin from left to right, and it will be in position to  make three buttonhole stitches along the loop, which completes the  second example.    [Illustration: Fig. 78.]    The upper bar on fig. 78 shows a buttonholed picot. The bar must be  worked to the left-hand end of the required picot; the thread is then  from there taken back about one-eighth of an inch and threaded through  the edge of the buttonhole. This is repeated to and fro until there is a  loop composed of three threads ready to be buttonholed over. Upon this  being done, the thread will have arrived at the right point to continue  the bar.    Bullion stitch makes another simple picot--Work the bar to the point  where the picot is required, then, instead of taking the next stitch,  insert the point of the needle in the heading of the last stitch. Leave  the needle in this position, and twist the thread six or eight times  round the point of it, just as for the bullion knot (fig. 59). Place the  left thumb over the tight coil thus formed, and pull the needle and  thread through tightly in order to make the stitch double up into a  tight semi-circle, then continue the buttonholing to the end of the  bar.          CHAPTER VII    CANVAS WORK AND STITCHES      Introduction--Samplers--Petit Point Pictures--Cross Stitch--Tent    Stitch--Gobelin Stitch--Irish Stitch--Plait Stitch--Two-sided    Italian Stitch--Holbein Stitch--Rococo Stitch.      Canvas work, known in the XIIIth century as _opus pulvinarium_ or  cushion work, is of great antiquity, and seems to have had an  independent origin in several countries. It is sometimes given the  misleading name of tapestry, perhaps owing to hangings of all kinds  being called tapestries, whether loom-woven, worked with the needle, or  painted. Large wall hangings with designs similar to those of woven  tapestries have been most successfully carried out on canvas in cross or  tent stitch; as a rule, however, smaller objects are worked, such as  furniture coverings, screens or cushions, whence it is obvious canvas  work received its ancient and descriptive Latin name. Many Eastern  carpets are worked upon a strong canvas in a kind of tent stitch, and  so come under the heading of canvas work. It is a particularly durable  method of embroidering, and this makes it suitable for use upon anything  subjected to hard wear.    The work has usually a very decided and attractive character of its own.  A familiar example of this can be seen in the XVIIIth century samplers.  Its peculiar character is perhaps due to the fact that it cannot break  away from a certain conventionality due to constant use of the same  stitch, and its dependence upon the web of the fabric. This regularity  prevents the work from showing certain faults of design that other  methods may exaggerate. It is hardly possible to copy a natural spray of  flowers in cross stitch and keep it very naturalistic. The stitch being  square and alike all over gives a formality of treatment to every part  of the design, also, some detail is perforce omitted owing to the  impossibility of putting it in; all of this tends to a right method of  treatment, which renders the sampler an admirable lesson not only in  workmanship but also in design.    The XVIth and XVIIth century pictorial subjects worked upon fine canvas  in cross or tent stitch afford instances of most interesting work in  canvas stitches. Some of these, though, as a rule, very much smaller in  size, equal, in their way, the finest tapestries. Most of them, if  judged from a painter's standpoint, would be pronounced failures, but  this effect is not what is sought after; the method of treatment belongs  rather to the great traditions of the tapestry weaver, and is not  governed by the canons of the painter. Plate VI. shows a detail of  foliage from a particularly fine example of this work lately added to  the Victoria and Albert Museum collection.[2]    In what went by the name of Berlin wool work, popular in the early XIXth  century, we have before us a degenerate offshoot of this fine and poetic  kind of work in which all its possibilities are missed, with a result  that is prosaic in the extreme. Some of the canvas-work seat covers  decorated with geometrical designs, seen on Chippendale chairs, were a  pleasant and satisfactory variation in their way, but in most of the  work after that period, the attempt at impossible naturalistic effect  gave such unsatisfactory results as to almost deal a death blow to all  canvas embroidery. It is, however, a method too good and useful to die  out; it must always be more or less in vogue.    Patterns carried out in canvas stitches are sometimes to be seen worked  apparently upon velvet or similar ground materials. This is done by  first laying the canvas upon the velvet and stitching through both  materials; this would have to be carried out in a frame. The threads of  the canvas are afterwards either withdrawn or closely cut off. In the  former case, the stitches must be drawn tight, or the finished work will  not look well. This method has the advantage of saving the labour of  working the background, and sometimes it suits the pattern to have a  contrast in the ground material. In old embroideries, heraldic devices  may be seen successfully treated in this way.    The usual canvas stitches can be worked upon other fabrics that have an  even and square mesh, such as various kinds of linen; also other  embroidery stitches, such as stem, satin, or chain, can be used upon  canvas; they are then always worked with a certain regularity, following  the web of the material.    Canvas work can be done in the hand or in a frame, but the technique is  often better in work done in a frame. In all-over work it is important  that not even a suggestion of the ground fabric should be allowed to  show through; for this reason work in light colours should be done on  white canvas, and _vice versa_, as far as possible, also the thread used  must suit in thickness the mesh of the canvas. To work a plain ground  well is less easy than to work the pattern, though it may sound more  simple. The back of the work, though not necessarily similar to the  front, must be alike in stitch all over, for the direction the stitch  takes at the back affects the regularity of appearance of the front. The  stitch must not be commenced in exactly the same place in each row, lest  a ridge should appear upon the surface; this can be avoided by using  threads of different lengths. A ground is usually commenced at the lower  left-hand corner, and a pattern, if a complicated one, from the centre  outwards. These technical points are of importance, but they are of  little value unless the stitches are at the same time expressing an  interesting and suitable design.    The stitches used are exceedingly numerous; those described in the  following pages are the varieties most commonly seen.    Cross stitch, the best known in this group, can be worked in slightly  different ways, according to the purpose for which it is required. On  the surface it is always the same, but it can vary at the back. For  instance, when used for marking purposes it should form on the reverse  side either a cross or a square, to do either of which demands some  ingenuity on the part of the worker. For ordinary work the really  correct method is to complete each stitch before going on to the next,  though grounding is frequently done by working the first half of the  stitch along an entire line, and completing the cross upon a return  journey. In any case, the crossing must always be worked in the same  direction.    Cross stitch is a double stitch worked diagonally over two threads of  the canvas each way. It can, however, be taken over more or fewer  threads if required larger or smaller. To work it (fig. 79)--Bring the  needle through on the upper left side of the threads to be covered, and  take it back again on the lower right, then bring it through on the  upper right side and return it to the back on the lower left, which  completes the first stitch.    [Illustration: Fig. 79.]    Tent stitch (fig. 80) is the finest canvas stitch, and is therefore  suitable for work involving much detail. Pictorial and heraldic subjects  are frequently carried out in it. It is worked diagonally over a  perpendicular and horizontal thread of the canvas. The diagram shows  the method of working both back and front. It will be noticed that  though the line goes alternately from left to right and from right to  left, the stitch is always the same at the back as well as the same upon  the front; if this were not so, alternate rows would have a different  appearance upon the right side. The diagram does not show the connection  between the first and the second row, but it is evident that it must be  a short upright line.    [Illustration: Fig. 80.]    Gobelin stitch is a useful variety; it lends itself to shading better  than cross stitch. It is most often worked upon a fine single canvas,  and it can be used as a raised stitch. Fig. 81 represents the stitch; it  is worked similarly to tent stitch but over two threads in height and  one in width, no matter whether the single or double thread canvas is  used. In order to work it as a raised stitch, a line of some kind of  padding is thrown across the canvas, and the stitch taken over it. This  line can be arranged to show in part, in which case the material must be  one presentable, such as a gold cord or narrow braid. The padding would  be covered with stitching to form the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20387"],[0,"A Thin Ghost and Others (#10)"],[1," doubt but what it did stand in need of repair. There was very few  winters passed but what we'd lose a pinnicle.\" Mr. Lake expressed his  concurrence with Worby's views of restoration, but owns to a fear  about this point lest the story proper should never be reached.  Possibly this was perceptible in his manner.    Worby hastened to reassure him, \"Not but what I could carry on about  that topic for hours at a time, and do do when I see my opportunity.  But Dean Burscough he was very set on the Gothic period, and nothing  would serve him but everything must be made agreeable to that. And one  morning after service he appointed for my father to meet him in the  choir, and he came back after he'd taken off his robes in the vestry,  and he'd got a roll of paper with him, and the verger that was then  brought in a table, and they begun spreading it out on the table with  prayer books to keep it down, and my father helped 'em, and he saw it  was a picture of the inside of a choir in a Cathedral; and the  Dean--he was a quick spoken gentleman--he says, 'Well, Worby, what do  you think of that?' 'Why', says my father, 'I don't think I 'ave the  pleasure of knowing that view. Would that be Hereford Cathedral, Mr.  Dean?' 'No, Worby,' says the Dean, 'that's Southminster Cathedral as  we hope to see it before many years.' 'In-deed, sir,' says my father,  and that was all he did say--leastways to the Dean--but he used to  tell me he felt really faint in himself when he looked round our  choir as I can remember it, all comfortable and furnished-like, and  then see this nasty little dry picter, as he called it, drawn out by  some London architect. Well, there I am again. But you'll see what I  mean if you look at this old view.\"    Worby reached down a framed print from the wall. \"Well, the long and  the short of it was that the Dean he handed over to my father a copy  of an order of the Chapter that he was to clear out every bit of the  choir--make a clean sweep--ready for the new work that was being  designed up in town, and he was to put it in hand as soon as ever he  could get the breakers together. Now then, sir, if you look at that  view, you'll see where the pulpit used to stand: that's what I want  you to notice, if you please.\" It was, indeed, easily seen; an  unusually large structure of timber with a domed sounding-board,  standing at the east end of the stalls on the north side of the choir,  facing the bishop's throne. Worby proceeded to explain that during the  alterations, services were held in the nave, the members of the choir  being thereby disappointed of an anticipated holiday, and the organist  in particular incurring the suspicion of having wilfully damaged the  mechanism of the temporary organ that was hired at considerable  expense from London.    The work of demolition began with the choir screen and organ loft, and  proceeded gradually eastwards, disclosing, as Worby said, many  interesting features of older work. While this was going on, the  members of the Chapter were, naturally, in and about the choir a great  deal, and it soon became apparent to the elder Worby--who could not  help overhearing some of their talk--that, on the part of the senior  Canons especially, there must have been a good deal of disagreement  before the policy now being carried out had been adopted. Some were of  opinion that they should catch their deaths of cold in the  return-stalls, unprotected by a screen from the draughts in the nave:  others objected to being exposed to the view of persons in the choir  aisles, especially, they said, during the sermons, when they found it  helpful to listen in a posture which was liable to misconstruction.  The strongest opposition, however, came from the oldest of the body,  who up to the last moment objected to the removal of the pulpit. \"You  ought not to touch it, Mr. Dean,\" he said with great emphasis one  morning, when the two were standing before it: \"you don't know what  mischief you may do.\" \"Mischief? it's not a work of any particular  merit, Canon.\" \"Don't call me Canon,\" said the old man with great  asperity, \"that is, for thirty years I've been known as Dr. Ayloff,  and I shall be obliged, Mr. Dean, if you would kindly humour me in  that matter. And as to the pulpit (which I've preached from for thirty  years, though I don't insist on that) all I'll say is, I _know_ you're  doing wrong in moving it.\" \"But what sense could there be, my dear  Doctor, in leaving it where it is, when we're fitting up the rest of  the choir in a totally different _style_? What reason could be  given--apart from the look of the thing?\" \"Reason! reason!\" said old  Dr. Ayloff; \"if you young men--if I may say so without any disrespect,  Mr. Dean--if you'd only listen to reason a little, and not be always  asking for it, we should get on better. But there, I've said my say.\"  The old gentleman hobbled off, and as it proved, never entered the  Cathedral again. The season--it was a hot summer--turned sickly on a  sudden. Dr. Ayloff was one of the first to go, with some affection of  the muscles of the thorax, which took him painfully at night. And at  many services the number of choirmen and boys was very thin.    Meanwhile the pulpit had been done away with. In fact, the  sounding-board (part of which still exists as a table in a  summer-house in the palace garden) was taken down within an hour or  two of Dr. Ayloff's protest. The removal of the base--not effected  without considerable trouble--disclosed to view, greatly to the  exultation of the restoring party, an altar-tomb--the tomb, of course,  to which Worby had attracted Lake's attention that same evening. Much  fruitless research was expended in attempts to identify the occupant;  from that day to this he has never had a name put to him. The  structure had been most carefully boxed in under the pulpit-base, so  that such slight ornament as it possessed was not defaced; only on the  north side of it there was what looked like an injury; a gap between  two of the slabs composing the side. It might be two or three inches  across. Palmer, the mason, was directed to fill it up in a week's  time, when he came to do some other small jobs near that part of the  choir.    The season was undoubtedly a very trying one. Whether the church was  built on a site that had once been a marsh, as was suggested, or for  whatever reason, the residents in its immediate neighbourhood had,  many of them, but little enjoyment of the exquisite sunny days and  the calm nights of August and September. To several of the older  people--Dr. Ayloff, among others, as we have seen--the summer proved  downright fatal, but even among the younger, few escaped either a  sojourn in bed for a matter of weeks, or at the least, a brooding  sense of oppression, accompanied by hateful nightmares. Gradually  there formulated itself a suspicion--which grew into a conviction--that  the alterations in the Cathedral had something to say in the matter.  The widow of a former old verger, a pensioner of the Chapter of  Southminster, was visited by dreams, which she retailed to her  friends, of a shape that slipped out of the little door of the south  transept as the dark fell in, and flitted--taking a fresh direction  every night--about the close, disappearing for a while in house after  house, and finally emerging again when the night sky was paling. She  could see nothing of it, she said, but that it was a moving form: only  she had an impression that when it returned to the church, as it  seemed to do in the end of the dream, it turned its head: and then,  she could not tell why, but she thought it had red eyes. Worby  remembered hearing the old lady tell this dream at a tea-party in the  house of the chapter clerk. Its recurrence might, perhaps, he said, be  taken as a symptom of approaching illness; at any rate before the end  of September the old lady was in her grave.    The interest excited by the restoration of this great church was not  confined to its own county. One day that summer an F.S.A., of some  celebrity, visited the place. His business was to write an account of  the discoveries that had been made, for the Society of Antiquaries,  and his wife, who accompanied him, was to make a series of  illustrative drawings for his report. In the morning she employed  herself in making a general sketch of the choir; in the afternoon she  devoted herself to details. She first drew the newly exposed  altar-tomb, and when that was finished, she called her husband's  attention to a beautiful piece of diaper-ornament on the screen just  behind it, which had, like the tomb itself, been completely concealed  by the pulpit. Of course, he said, an illustration of that must be  made; so she seated herself on the tomb and began a careful drawing  which occupied her till dusk.    Her husband had by this time finished his work of measuring and  description, and they agreed that it was time to be getting back to  their hotel. \"You may as well brush my skirt, Frank,\" said the lady,  \"it must have got covered with dust, I'm sure.\" He obeyed dutifully;  but, after a moment, he said, \"I don't know whether you value this  dress particularly, my dear, but I'm inclined to think it's seen its  best days. There's a great bit of it gone.\" \"Gone? Where?\" said she.  \"I don't know where it's gone, but it's off at the bottom edge behind  here.\" She pulled it hastily into sight, and was horrified to find a  jagged tear extending some way into the substance of the stuff; very  much, she said, as if a dog had rent it away. The dress was, in any  case, hopelessly spoilt, to her great vexation, and though they looked  everywhere, the missing piece could not be found. There were many  ways, they concluded, in which the injury might have come about, for  the choir was full of old bits of woodwork with nails sticking out of  them. Finally, they could only suppose that one of these had caused  the mischief, and that "]]]
