Alice, who played the part this time of a frivolous young woman,  was to save her pet cat.    \"Here they come!\" yelled Paul, as the first of the Unionists came into  view at the head of the street. \"Hurry, girls!\"    Out they rushed, down the steps of the mansion, fleeing before the  mounted Union soldiers, who laughed and jeered, firing at the  Confederates, who were retreating.    Ruth and Estelle, with some of the other women, were in the lead. Alice  had lingered behind, for the cat showed a disposition to wiggle out of  her arms, and she wanted to keep it to make an effective picture.    Finally the creature did make its escape, but Alice was not going to  give up so easily. She started in pursuit, and then one of the Union  soldiers, Maurice Whitlow, spurred his horse forward. He wanted to get  in the foreground of the picture and took this chance.    \"Get back where you belong!\" yelled the director angrily. \"Who told you  to get in the spotlight? Get back!\"    But it was too late. Alice, in pursuit of the cat, was running straight  toward Whitlow's horse, and the next moment she slipped and went down,  almost under the feet of the prancing animal.          CHAPTER IX    MISS DIXON'S LOSS      \"Look out!\" shouted Paul, and, dropping what he was carrying, he made a  leap toward the animal Whitlow was riding.    \"Roll out of the way of his feet!\" cried the director.    \"Shall I keep on with the film?\" asked the camera man, for his duty was  to turn until told to stop, no matter what happened.    \"Let it run!\" Alice cried. \"I can get out of the way. Don't stop on my  account!\"    She had been in motion pictures long enough to know what it meant to  spoil a hundred feet or more of film in a spirited picture,  necessitating a retake. She had seen her danger, and had done her best  to get out of harm's way.    The cat had leaped into some bushes and was out of sight.    Whitlow, his face showing his fear and his inability to act in this  emergency, had instinctively drawn back on the reins. But it was to the  intelligent horse itself, rather than to the rider, that Alice owed her  immunity from harm. For the horse reared, and came down with feet well  to one side of the crouching girl, who had partly risen to her knees.    At the same moment Paul sprang for the steed's bridle and swerved him to  one side. Then, seeing that Alice was practically out of danger, Paul's  rage at the carelessness of Whitlow rose, and he reached up and fairly  dragged that young man out of the saddle.    \"You don't know enough to lead a horse to water, let alone ride one in a  movie battle scene!\" he cried, as he pushed the player to one side. \"Why  don't you look where you're going?\"    Whitlow was too shaken and startled to reply.    \"Go on. Help her up and keep on with the retreat!\" cried the director.  \"That's one of the best scenes of the picture. Couldn't have been better  if we had rehearsed it. Never mind the cat, Miss DeVere. Run on. Paul,  you land a couple of blows on Whitlow and then follow Alice. Hold back,  there--you Union men--until we get this bit of by-play.\"    Paul, nothing loath, gave Whitlow two hard blows, and the latter dared  not return them for fear of spoiling the picture, but he muttered in  rage.    Then Paul, shaking his fist at the Unionists, hurried on after Alice,  and the retreat continued. What had threatened to be a disaster, or at  least a spoiling of the scene, had turned out well. It is often so in  moving pictures.    In the remainder of the scene the girls had little part. They had been  driven from their home, and, presumably, were taken in by friends. The  rest of the scenes showed the Union soldiers making merry in the  Southern town they had captured.    \"My! That was a narrow escape you had!\" exclaimed Ruth, when she and her  sister were at liberty to return to the farmhouse. \"Were you hurt?\"    \"No; I strained one arm just a little. But it will make a good scene, so  Russ said.\"    \"Too good--too realistic!\" declared Paul. \"When I get a chance at that  Whitlow----\"    \"Please don't do anything!\" begged Alice. \"It wasn't really his fault.  If I hadn't had the cat----\"    \"It was his fault for pushing himself to the front the way he did,\" said  the young actor. \"Only the best riders were picked to lead the charge.  He might have known he couldn't control his horse in an emergency.  That's where he was at fault.\"    \"He is a poor rider,\" commented Estelle. \"But you showed rare good  sense, Alice, in acting as you did. A horse will not step on a person if  he can possibly avoid it. Mr. Whitlow's horse was better than he was.\"    \"Just the same, I got in two good punches!\" chuckled Paul, \"and he  didn't dare hit back.\"    \"He may make trouble for you later,\" Alice said.    \"Oh, I'm not worrying about that. I'm satisfied.\"    There was a spirited battle scene later in the day between the Union and  Confederate forces; the latter endeavoring to retake the village.    A Confederate battery in a distant town was sent for, and the Union  position was shelled. But as by this time the Union cannon had come up  and were entrenched in the town, an artillery duel ensued.    Views were shown of the Union guns being manned by the men, who wore  bloody cloths around their foreheads and who worked hard serving the  cannon. Real powder was used, but no balls, of course, and now and then  a man would fall dead at his gun.    Similar views with another camera were taken of the Confederate guns and  the scenes alternated on the screen afterward, creating a big  sensation.    Then came an attack of the Confederate infantry under cover of the  Southern battery. This was spirited, detachments of men rushing forward,  firing and then seeking what cover they could. At times a man would roll  over, his gun dropping, sometimes several would drop at the same time.  These were those who were detailed to be shot.    The Unionists replied with a counter charge, and for a time the battle  waged fiercely on both sides. Then came a lull in the fighting, with the  Confederates ready to make a last charge in a desperate attempt to  recapture the town.    \"I know what would make a good scene,\" said Maurice Whitlow, during the  lull when fresh films were being loaded into the cameras. \"If we had an  airship now some of us Union fellows could go for reinforcements in  that. It would make a dandy scene.\"    \"An airship!\" cried Russ. \"Say! remember that these scenes are supposed  to have taken place in 1863. The only airships then were those the  inventors were dreaming about or making in their laboratories. No  airships in Civil War plays! I guess not! Balloons, maybe, but no  airships.\"    \"More fighting! Camera!\" called Mr. Pertell, and again the spirited  action was under way. Cannon boomed; rifles spat fire and smoke; men  fought hand to hand, often rolling over dead; riderless horses dashed  here and there. Now and then a man would narrowly escape being run down.  As it was, several were burned from being too near the cannon or the  guns, and one man's leg was broken in a fall from his horse.    But it was part of the game, and no one seemed to mind. A real hospital  was set up at Oak Farm, not a mere shell of a building, and here the  injured, as well as those who simulated injury, were attended.    Ruth and some of the women made up as nurses, though this was not the  big scene in which Ruth and Alice were to take part.    \"Confederates retreat!\" directed Mr. Pertell, and the Southern forces,  having been defeated, were forced to withdraw. Their attempt to  recapture their town had failed.    \"Whew! that was hot work!\" cried Paul, as he came back to the farmhouse,  having played his part as a Confederate soldier.    \"It certainly was,\" agreed Mr. DeVere, who had been the directing Union  General. Now that the \"war\" was over Northerners and Southerners mingled  together in friendly converse, their differences forgotten.    \"I just can't bear the smell of powder!\" complained Miss Dixon. \"I wish  I had my salts.\"    \"I'll get them for you, dear,\" offered Miss Pennington. \"I'm going up to  our rooms.\" The former vaudeville actresses, with Ruth, Alice, and some  of the others, were resting on the farmhouse porch.    Miss Dixon smelled the salts and declared she felt much better.    \"There's to be a dance in the village to-night,\" Paul remarked at the  supper table.    \"Let's go!\" proposed Alice. \"Will you take me, Paul?\"    \"Of course I will.\"    \"May I have the pleasure?\" asked Russ, of Ruth.    \"Why, yes, if the rest go.\"    \"We'll all go!\" chimed in Miss Dixon. \"Some of the extra men are good  dancers. They proved it in the ballroom scene the other day. We can get  a man, Pearl.\"    \"All right, my dear, just as you say.\"    The little party was soon arranged.    \"Estelle might like to go,\" suggested Alice.    \"I'll go to ask her,\" offered Ruth, for Miss Brown had quit the supper  table early and gone to her room.    As Ruth mounted the stairs she heard Miss Dixon and Miss Pennington  talking in the hall outside their rooms.    \"I can't see where it can be,\" Miss Dixon was saying.    \"It was on your dresser when I went up for the salts,\" said her chum.  \"Are you sure you didn't take it after that?\"    \"Positive! It's gone--that's all there is to it.\"    \"What's gone?\" asked Ruth.    \"One of my rings,\" was Miss Dixon's answer. \"I left it on my dresser and  my door was open. It was there when I went down to supper, and we were  all at the table together----\"    \"Except Estelle Brown!\" said Miss Pennington quickly.          CHAPTER X    LIEUTENANT VARLEY      For a moment Ruth stood looking with wide-open eyes at the two former  vaudeville actresses. On their part they stared boldly at Ruth, and then"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20354"],[0,"Jack of Both Sides: The Story of a School War (#10)"],[1,"him up?\"    \"No, sir; it was Brady.\"    \"Indeed? And what business had he to take the law into his hands? What  were you locked up for, Trevelyan?\"    Poor Toppin was feeling very sorry for himself, and distinctly bitter  against Jack. He had heard the sound of many interesting things  happening, and had a strong suspicion that he had been forgotten. Aware  that he had not merited such hard treatment, he now replied plaintively:    \"Nuffing at all, sir!\"    \"Well, in any case, I have not yet given his training over to Brady,\"  observed Mr. West dryly, and without further question Jack was sentenced  to twenty minutes' detention at twelve o'clock, \"to see how he liked his  own treatment\".    \"Rough on you, Jack of Both Sides!\" said Simmons, as he passed him on  his way into the open air. \"Your policy's fine in theory, but I'm afraid  it won't pay. Jack of Both Sides, friend of neither, eh?\"    Jack's reply was quite cheerful:    \"Not so bad as that, thanks, Lucy. We're going to be friends all  together, the whole boiling of us, before we've done!\"    \"Think so?\" said Hughes, and shrugged his shoulders. \"Not much chance of  that yet, I'm afraid. I spoke to Hallett just now, and he wouldn't even  answer me.\"    Jack seemed out of luck's way this week, for the next morning he had an  accident with the ink, was fined sixpence for breaking one of the pots,  and ordered upstairs to change his bespattered garments.    Just outside his bedroom, in the passage, he came upon one of the  housemaids, in front of whom, on the ground, lay a pillow and a heavy  overcoat.    \"Hullo, Hannah! Having a pillow-fight with an overcoat, for fault of a  live enemy, eh? I've caught you in the act! Now, I want you to do  something for me. I've been taking an ink shower-bath, you see, and I go  home to-day, and I must wear this jacket. Could you--\"    But there Jack stopped short, for Hannah had broken into his sentence  with a jerky little sniff which he felt pretty sure was a stifled sob.    \"Why, my good Hannah, what's up? I'm most awfully sorry if there is  anything wrong. Do tell us what it is!\"    \"Oh, well, Master Brady, I'm sure it isn't your doing, but it's one of  the young gentlemen, and I don't mind which, but I do think it's very  ill-mannered and unkind, and I've always tried to do my duty by you  all, and more than that sometimes; and it's turned my thumb-nail back  and broken it, and the big buttons banged in my face, and dragged my  hair down; and it's no pleasure to do it, but I shall 'ave to carry the  tale to the master--\"    \"A booby-trap, I suppose,\" interposed Jack, looking thoughtful.    \"Well, sir, a trap--that's certain, for I walked in through the door as  innocent as a child; but I don't see on that account that I'm to be set  down for a booby.\"    \"No, no; it's only the name for the trick,\" Jack hastened to explain,  for Hannah was looking more hurt than ever. \"You balance the pillow on  the door, you know--and it needs some care, because it might fall the  wrong way, don't you see, and never hit you at all; and adding the  overcoat must have made it more difficult.\"    There was an unconscious tinge of admiration in Jack's voice, and Hannah  did not seem entirely consoled. As he handed her his stained jacket,  however, he added: \"You know, it wasn't meant for you, Hannah. You got  it by mistake. It was put up for Frere; I'm sure of that. On these  mornings he always comes to this room first thing to practise his  violin. Whoever set the trap never thought about you, that's certain.\"    \"That don't matter, sir, it hurt me just as much,\" persisted the maid.  \"And they've no business, 'aven't the young gentlemen, to play pranks  like this. You never know what you'll be let in for next. I shall be in  a heverlasting flutter now. It's worse than living in a monkey-house.\"    \"Have you ever tried that, Hannah? I shouldn't have thought this was  actually worse; but of course when one's tried both--\"    \"Master Brady, you're teasing me, and you know my meaning quite well.\"  Hannah's voice was positively tearful, and Jack grew alarmed.    \"Nonsense! I wouldn't tease you for the world. But look here, I want you  to think better of what you said--about carrying the tale to Mr. West.  There's an awful lot done by passing things over; you don't know! Let's  return these articles--see, it's Cadbury's pillow and Trevelyan's coat,  so neither of them set the trap--and let's agree to forgive and forget  for once. Won't you?\"    Jack could be very gentle and persuasive, and Hannah's heart was not  proof against his pleading.    \"Well, sir, just this once, since you put it like that, and hask so  particular.\"    \"There's an angel! I knew you would. You come to me, Hannah, when you're  in any fix, and see if I don't repay you for this. Hullo! here's Frere  and his fiddle. I'd better scuttle.\"    \"Yes, Brady, I think you had better,\" observed Frere. \"I heard Mr. West  asking for you.\"    \"Ugh! I never like being asked for,\" remarked Jack, and straightway  vanished.    \"So peace isn't signed yet,\" he said to himself. \"The campaign has only  changed its character, for secret and irregular warfare. I don't seem to  have accomplished much so far.\"    Jack went home that Saturday feeling rather discouraged. He little knew  what his accidental interview with Hannah, the housemaid, would result  in.    He was flinging his own and Trevelyan's muddy boots into the big basket  which stood in the scullery, on Monday evening, when a low voice close  at hand startled him.    \"Please, Master Brady, if you have a minute to spare, I should like to  speak to you.\"    Jack turned round in surprise, to face his friend of Saturday, the  housemaid.    \"Why, certainly. Fire away! I'm all attention.\"    \"I hope you won't think me foolish, sir, but you--you do seem  sympithetic like, though you can't help me, I know; and yet you told me  to come to you, and it's a relief to out with one's trouble; and Emma,  she don't understand, because she's going to be married, and she don't  think of nothin' else; and Cook, she says she's never 'ad nothin' to do  with plants, not excep' the eatin' sorts, like cabbages and turnips--\"    \"But, Hannah, you haven't given me a chance yet. Plants?\" said Jack.    \"Yes, sir; I'll tell you all about it if I may. You see, my 'ome's at  Brickland--that's a matter of four miles from Elmridge,--and my father,  he's steadily wastin', and doctor says there's no chance for him, not  unless he gets to one of the hopen-air 'ospitals, and he's not to doddle  about the green-'ouse any more.\"    \"That's a bad business,\" said Jack, looking grave. \"Then your father has  been a gardener?\"    \"Yes, and a salesman in a small way, sir. But now he's to give up, and  sell all the plants. Doctor says he'll never again be fit for that work.  It's goin' in and out of the cold and the heat and the damp that's so  tryin'. He's been holdin' on as long as he could, but now he's ready  enough to part with 'em, and if only he could get a good price it'd  maybe take 'im to the hopen-air, and help to keep the 'ome together till  he's well.\"    \"That sounds the wisest plan,\" observed Jack thoughtfully.    \"Yes, sir, but the point is the sellin' of 'em. They ought to go into a  good big sale, where there'll be plenty of biddin'; they aren't enough  in themselves to draw buyers. And Mother says in her letter this mornin'  they've heard of one that's bein' held in Elmridge on Saturday, a big  one, in the Rookwood grounds. They call it a 'Nurserymen's Combine';  there's a many of them joining, and they're willin' to take in Father's  little lot.\"    [Illustration]    \"Surely the very thing!\" said Jack.    \"It seems so, doesn't it, sir? Father he sent round at once to make  arrangements. But what do you think? he can't get the carting of 'em  done under three-and-six a load; and, as he says, he hasn't got half a  guinea to lay out that way. Why, it'd pay his train to the hopen-air! So  'e'll have to let it slide, and not get such a chance again in a hurry.\"    \"I'm sure I'm awfully sorry about it,\" responded Jack feelingly.  \"But--but--but keep up your spirits, and who knows what may turn up?\"    And with this consoling advice, he turned on his heel.          CHAPTER VIII    JACK'S MAIDEN SPEECH      \"You really wish me to understand, Brady, that not you alone, but all  the elder boys--day-pupils and boarders alike--desire of your own  free-will to devote your next Saturday's half-holiday to conveying this  poor man's plants from his house at Brickland to the Rookwood sale?\"    \"Yes, sir, that's what we want to do.\"    \"H'm! Well, the proposal does you credit, and you certainly might employ  your time much worse than in carrying it out. I don't think it would be  right for me to refuse your request. Mr. Anderson, I feel sure, will be  ready to help and advise you, if necessary, but as the idea is your own  I should like you, as far as possible, to carry it out by yourselves.\"    \"Thank you, sir!\" said Jack, and withdrew.    It was evening when this dialogue took place. The day-boys had departed  in an irritable frame of mind, on account of various annoyances of which  they had been the victims during the past two days. Bacon had been  tripped up twice by a piece of string, Hughes had found his coat-sleeves  tightly sewn up with packing-thread, and Simmons's pockets had been  crammed with moist, wriggling earthworms.    Knowing this, it may be wondered that they were prevailed on to agree to  Jack's scheme for the coming Saturday. But our hero was wily, and he  worded his suggestion so carefully that they did not for a moment  imagine that their enemies the boarders were at all connected with the  plan, which seemed to offer scope for fun and adventure of a new  description. Was not Saturday Jack's regular day of release? Of course  this was to be an \"out-of-school\" affair altogether. So they imagined.    \"Now then, you fellows!\" cried Jack, bursting into"]]]
