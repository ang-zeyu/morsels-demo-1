Lydia was fortunate enough to get two maids from one of the agencies,  one of whom was to sleep on the premises. The flat was not illimitable,  and she regretted that she had promised to place a room at the disposal  of the aged Mr. Jaggs. If he was awake all night as she presumed he  would be, and slept in the day, he might have been accommodated in the  kitchen, and she hinted as much to Jack. To her surprise the lawyer had  turned down that idea.    \"You don't want your servants to know that you have a watchman.\"    \"What do you imagine they will think he is?\" she asked scornfully. \"How  can I have an old gentleman in the flat without explaining why he is  there?\"    \"Your explanation could be that he did the boots.\"    \"It wouldn't take him all night to do the boots. Of course, I'm too  grateful to him to want him to do anything.\"    Mr. Jaggs reported again for duty that night. He came at half-past nine,  a shabby-looking old man, and Lydia, who had not yet got used to her new  magnificence, came out into the hall to meet him.    He was certainly not a prepossessing object, and Lydia discovered that,  in addition to his other misfortunes, he had a slight squint.    \"I hadn't an opportunity of thanking you the other day, Mr. Jaggs,\" she  said. \"I think you saved my life.\"    \"That's all right, miss,\" he said, in his hoarse voice. \"Dooty is  dooty!\"    She thought he was looking past her, till she realised that his curious  slanting line of vision was part of his infirmity.    \"I'll show you to your room,\" she said hastily.    She led the way down the corridor, opened the door of a small room which  had been prepared for him, and switched on the light.    \"Too much light for me, miss,\" said the old man, shaking his head. \"I  like to sit in the dark and listen, that's what I like, to sit in the  dark and listen.\"    \"But you can't sit in the dark, you'll want to read, won't you?\"    \"Can't read, miss,\" said Jaggs cheerfully. \"Can't write, either. I don't  know that I'm any worse off.\"    Reluctantly she switched out the light.    \"But you won't be able to see your food.\"    \"I can feel for that, miss,\" he said with a hoarse chuckle. \"Don't you  worry about me. I'll just sit here and have a big think.\"    If she was uncomfortable before, she was really embarrassed now. The  very sight of the door behind which old Jaggs sat having his \"big think\"  was an irritation to her. She could not sleep for a long time that  night for thinking of him sitting in the darkness, and \"listening\" as  he put it, and had firmly resolved on ending a condition of affairs  which was particularly distasteful to her, when she fell asleep.    She woke when the maid brought her tea, to learn that Jaggs had gone.    The maid, too, had her views on the \"old gentleman.\" She hadn't slept  all night for the thought of him, she said, though probably this was an  exaggeration.    The arrangement must end, thought Lydia, and she called at Jack Glover's  office that afternoon to tell him so. Jack listened without comment  until she had finished.    \"I'm sorry he is worrying you, but you'll get used to him in time, and I  should be obliged if you kept him for a month. You would relieve me of a  lot of anxiety.\"    At first she was determined to have her way, but he was so persistent,  so pleading, that eventually she surrendered.    Lucy, the new maid, however, was not so easily convinced.    \"I don't like it, miss,\" she said, \"he's just like an old tramp, and I'm  sure we shall be murdered in our beds.\"    \"How cheerful you are, Lucy,\" laughed Lydia. \"Of course, there is no  danger from Mr. Jaggs, and he really was very useful to me.\"    The girl grumbled and assented a little sulkily, and Lydia had a  feeling that she was going to lose a good servant. In this she was not  mistaken.    Old Jaggs called at half-past nine that night, and was admitted by the  maid, who stalked in front of him and opened his door.    \"There's your room,\" she snapped, \"and I'd rather have your room than  your company.\"    \"Would you, miss?\" wheezed Jaggs, and Lydia, attracted by the sound of  voices, came to the door and listened with some amusement.    \"Lord, bless me life, it ain't a bad room, either. Put the light out, my  dear, I don't like light. I like 'em dark, like them little cells in  Holloway prison, where you were took two years ago for robbing your  missus.\"    Lydia's smile left her face. She heard the girl gasp.    \"You old liar!\" she hissed.    \"Lucy Jones you call yourself--you used to be Mary Welch in them days,\"  chuckled old Jaggs.    \"I'm not going to be insulted,\" almost screamed Lucy, though there was a  note of fear in her strident voice. \"I'm going to leave to-night.\"    \"No you ain't, my dear,\" said old Jaggs complacently. \"You're going to  sleep here to-night, and you're going to leave in the morning. If you  try to get out of that door before I let you, you'll be pinched.\"    \"They've got nothing against me,\" the girl was betrayed into saying.    \"False characters, my dear. Pretending to come from the agency, when you  didn't. That's another crime. Lord bless your heart, I've got enough  against you to put you in jail for a year.\"    Lydia came forward.    \"What is this you're saying about my maid?\"    \"Good evening, ma'am.\"    The old man knuckled his forehead.    \"I'm just having an argument with your young lady.\"    \"Do you say she is a thief?\"    \"Of course she is, miss,\" said Jaggs scornfully. \"You ask her!\"    But Lucy had gone into her room, slammed the door and locked it.    The next morning when Lydia woke, the flat was empty, save for herself.  But she had hardly finished dressing when there came a knock at the  door, and a trim, fresh-looking country girl, with an expansive smile  and a look of good cheer that warmed Lydia's heart, appeared.    \"You're the lady that wants a maid, ma'am, aren't you?\"    \"Yes,\" said Lydia in surprise. \"But who sent you?\"    \"I was telegraphed for yesterday, ma'am, from the country.\"    \"Come in,\" said Lydia helplessly.    \"Isn't it right?\" asked the girl a little disappointedly. \"They sent me  my fare. I came up by the first train.\"    \"It is quite all right,\" said Lydia, \"only I'm wondering who is running  this flat, me or Mr. Jaggs?\"          Chapter XI      Jean Briggerland had spent a very busy afternoon. There had been a  string of callers at the handsome house in Berkeley Street.    Mr. Briggerland was of a philanthropic bent, and had instituted a club  in the East End of London which was intended to raise the moral tone of  Limehouse, Wapping, Poplar and the adjacent districts. It was started  without ostentation with a man named Faire as general manager. Mr. Faire  had had in his lifetime several hectic contests with the police, in  which he had been invariably the loser. And it was in his role as a  reformed character that he undertook the management of this social  uplift club.    Well-meaning police officials had warned Mr. Briggerland that Faire had  a bad character. Mr. Briggerland listened, was grateful for the warning,  but explained that Faire had come under the influence of the new uplift  movement, and from henceforward he would be an exemplary citizen. Later,  the police had occasion to extend their warning to its founder. The club  was being used by known criminal characters; men who had already been  in jail and were qualifying for a return visit.    Again Mr. Briggerland pointed to the object of the institution which was  to bring bad men into the society of good men and women, and to arouse  in them a desire for better things. He quoted a famous text with great  effect. But still the police were unconvinced.    It was the practice of Miss Jean Briggerland to receive selected members  of the club and to entertain them at tea in Berkeley Street. Her friends  thought it was very \"sweet\" and very \"daring,\" and wondered whether she  wasn't afraid of catching some kind of disease peculiar to the East End  of London. But Jean did not worry about such things. On this afternoon,  after the last of her callers had gone, she went down to the little  morning-room where such entertainments occurred and found two men, who  rose awkwardly as she entered.    The gentle influence of the club had not made them look anything but  what they were. \"Jail-bird\" was written all over them.    \"I'm very glad you men have come,\" said Jean sweetly. \"Mr. Hoggins----\"    \"That's me, miss,\" said one, with a grin.    \"And Mr. Talmot.\"    The second man showed his teeth.    \"I'm always glad to see members of the club,\" said Jean busy with the  teapot, \"especially men who have had so bad a time as you have. You  have only just come out of prison, haven't you, Mr. Hoggins?\" she asked  innocently.    Hoggins went red and coughed.    \"Yes, miss,\" he said huskily and added inconsequently, \"I didn't do it!\"    \"I'm sure you were innocent,\" she said with a smile of sympathy, \"and  really if you were guilty I don't think you men are so much to blame.  Look what a bad time you have! What disadvantages you suffer, whilst  here in the West End people are wasting money that really ought to go to  your wives and children.\"    \"That's right,\" said Mr. Hoggins.    \"There's a girl I know who is tremendously rich,\" Jean prattled on. \"She  lives at 84, Cavendish Mansions, just on the top floor, and, of course,  she's very foolish to sleep with her windows open, especially as people  could get down from the roof--there is a fire escape there. She always  has a lot of jewellery--keeps it under her pillow I think, and there is  generally a few hundred pounds scattered about the bedroom. Now that is  what I call putting temptation in the way of the weak.\"    She lifted her blue eyes, saw the glitter in the man's eyes and went on.    \"I've told her lots of times that there is danger, but she only laughs.  There is an old man who sleeps in the house--quite a feeble old man who  has only the use of one arm. Of course,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21531"],[0,"Woodwork Joints: How They Are Set Out, How Made and Where Used. (#10)"],[1,"of  the back rail tenon, the joint actually draws up and, having done so, is  locked in position. The exact location of this groove is obtained in a  similar manner to that used in marking out tenons for drawbore pinning,  _i.e._, the tenon is inserted in its mortise and the position of the back  rail mortise transferred to it, after which the lines are set back by  1/64 in. (approximately) to cause the joint to draw.    From the illustration the construction of the joint should be clear. The  method is particularly adapted to a section of rectangular form where one  side is longer than the other, such as the back leg of a chair, as this  shape allows for the accommodation of the extra length of tenon  required.          THE DOWELLING JOINT      Dowelling is the term generally given to the method of jointing timber  and other materials by wooden or metal pegs, which are called dowels. For  cabinet-making and similar work straight-grained beechwood dowels are  mostly used; these may be bought by the gross, in lengths of about 36  ins., and of any desired diameter.    [Illustration: Fig. 190.--Steel Dowel Plate.]    MAKING DOWELS.--Many, however, prefer to make what they require for the  work in hand, and the following is the method that is generally employed.  Pieces of straight-grained wood are wrought to a square section, after  which the corners are planed away to form an octagonal section. The sharp  corners are now planed away, and the roughly formed dowel is driven  through a steel dowel plate, Fig. 190, by the aid of a heavy hammer, thus  giving the necessary roundness and finish to the dowels. When hammering  dowels through a plate the hammer should on no account be allowed to come  in contact with the face of the dowel plate, or the cutting edge of the  hole will be spoilt. Simply drive the dowel to within 1/8 in. of the  plate and knock it out with the next dowel.    [Illustration: Fig. 191.--Cradle for Planing Dowels.]    [Illustration: Fig. 192.--Dowel with Groove.]    [Illustration: Fig. 193.--Sawing Groove in Dowel.]    To plane off the corners a \"cradle\" (Fig. 191) is made and kept for the  purpose. The advantage of this cradle is obvious, preventing as it does  any tendency of the partly-formed dowel to slip or wobble. A jig, or  cradle, is easily made by bevelling the edges of two separate pieces of  wood and then glueing and screwing them together as at Fig. 191. A small  block of wood is inserted to act as a stop whilst the planing operation  is in progress. It is usual to bevel both edges of the timber from which  the cradle is formed, thus accommodating all sizes of dowels from 1/4 in.  to 5/8 in. in diameter.    [Illustration: Fig. 194.--Pricking the Centres ready for Boring. Also  showing how Brace is used in conjunction with Try Square.]    Fig. 192 shows a completed dowel with a small groove running along its  entire length. The object of this groove is to allow the air and  superfluous glue to escape and thus avoid splitting the work on hand; the  groove also secretes a certain amount of glue, which increases its hold  on the timber.    Fig. 198 illustrates the method of marking out and gauging two boards for  dowelling. The edges of the boards are first shot to a true joint; then  the face sides are placed together and the lines for the dowels are  marked across the edges with a fine pencil and the aid of a try square.  The boards are then gauged from the face side, thus giving the points  indicated in the sketch.    [Illustration: Fig. 195.--Countersink.]    [Illustration: Fig. 196.--Dowel Rounder.]    [Illustration: Fig. 197.--Twist Bit.]    To start the twist bit (Fig. 197) it is a good plan to prick the board at  the point of intersection of the marked lines with a sharp,  circular-pointed marking awl. This obviates any tendency of the boring  bit to run out of truth and thus cause unevenness on the face side of the  jointed board. (See Fig. 194.)    A safe rule for the spacing of dowels when jointing sideboard tops,  dressing table and wardrobe ends, etc., is to place the dowels 9 ins. to  10 ins. apart, and place two dowels at each end as shown at Fig. 198. The  length of the dowels should be about 7/8 in. to 1-1/4 in. long.    Fig. 199 shows the two boards prepared ready for glueing. The back one  is bored to receive the dowels, and the front one shows the dowels glued  in position. It is customary to warm the edges of the boards before  spreading the glue, and cramps are required to squeeze the joint tight.  These should be left on the jointed board from one to four hours  according to the state of the weather. In cases where thick timber (say  2-in. or 2-1/2-in. boards) is to be jointed, two rows of dowels may be  used, the position of the dowels being as Fig. 200.    [Illustration: Fig. 198.--Marking and Gauging Boards for Dowelling.]    [Illustration: Fig. 199.--Dowelled Joint ready for Glueing.]    Fig. 201 shows the plan of a 3-in. cornice pole made to fit a bay window;  the straight portions of the pole are generally turned in the lathe, the  corner portions being afterwards jointed and worked up to the required  shape. To avoid any difficulty in the setting out of the dowels, a disc  of cardboard or sheet metal is made to the same diameter as that of the  cornice pole; this disc is called a template. The positions of the dowels  are set out geometrically, and the centres are pricked through with a  fine-pointed marking awl (see sketch of template, _a_, Fig. 201). The  template is put on the ends of the straight pole, and the dowel centres  are pricked into the wood. The process is repeated on the ends of the  corner block (_b_, Fig. 201), and if the holes be now bored at the  centres indicated a true fit will be obtained.    [Illustration: Fig. 200.--Method of Dowelling Thick Timber.]    [Illustration: Fig. 201.--Method of Dowelling Cornice Pole by Means of  Template.]    Fig. 201 _c_ shows two portions of the circular pole jointed up to a  corner block, and the dotted lines P indicate the direct line of pressure  and shows the position for the cramp. When the glue is thoroughly set the  corner block is sawn and spokeshaved to the desired shape as shown by the  dotted line. This method is illustrated to show that, by the use of a  suitable template, dowels may be exactly set out even when there is no  straight or square face from which to use a marking gauge, and the method  may, of course, be applied to many other examples of dowelling at the  discretion of the workman.    [Illustration: Fig. 202.--Dowelling a Mitred Frame.]    [Illustration: Fig. 203.--Method of Frame Dowelling. (Long and Short  Shoulders.)]    [Illustration: Fig. 204.--Table Leaf with Dowels.]    [Illustration: Fig. 205.--Block for Twist Bit.]    [Illustration: Fig. 206.--Dowelling for Moulded Frame.]    [Illustration: Fig. 207.--Cap.]    Fig. 202 shows one corner of a mitred and dowelled frame. It needs  little or no explanation beyond the fact that the dowels should be at  right angles to the line of joint, and consequently the dowel at the  outside edge of the frame will have to be much shorter than the others.  This gives a strong and serviceable joint, suitable for many purposes.    FRAME DOWELLING.--Fig. 203 shows one corner of a frame with long and  short shoulders, such as occurs when the upright is rebated through its  entire length. The holes in both pieces are bored for the dowels before  they are rebated. This avoids any difficulty in endeavouring to bore with  only one side of the twist bit in the wood. A similar type of joint is  used on nearly all kinds of glass and door frames in cabinet work.    Fig. 204 is a leaf for the screw type of table. Circular dowels are shown  at one end, and rectangular wooden pegs at the other; both methods are  equally good, and, of course, the dowels are only glued into one leaf.  The object of these dowels is to guide the table leaf into its proper  position when the leaf engages the table proper, and to make the flat  surface of the table top and leaf register correctly and thus ensure a  level surface.    Fig. 205 is a wooden block made in two portions and held together by  screws; it is used to fasten around a twist bit, the object being to  ensure that all the dowel holes are of uniform depth. It may be adjusted  as desired and firmly screwed round the twist bit; if the hole is made  1/4 in. in diameter it will clip round a 1/4-in. or 3/8-in. bit and will  answer a dual purpose. It is a preventative for bad dowelling.    Fig. 206 is an example of dowelling framing when the moulding on the edge  has to be mitred. It is necessary to cut the shoulders away so as to  allow the members of the moulding to intersect. The section of the mould  is not shown in the sketch for clearness of representation. The portion  marked H is called the \"horn,\" and it is not cut off until after the  frame is glued up; its object is to prevent the rail splitting or  bursting when knocking up the frame or during the cramping process.    Fig. 207 shows the method of dowelling a moulded cap to the top of a  wooden bedstead post or similar pillar where it is desired to avoid any  unsightliness.    Fig. 208 is a dining-table leg and portion of the framing, showing the  method of dowelling the frame to the leg. Chairs, couch frames, etc., are  made in a similar manner.    Fig. 209 shows the top portion of a table leg and a home-made dowel  gauge. The gauge is made of any hardwood, and steel wire pins are driven  through at the required positions and sharpened similar to the spur of a  marking gauge. The legs are sawn and planed up true and square, and the  advantage of the gauge is that all legs are marked exactly alike and are  therefore interchangeable until glued up. A gauge of this type is easily  and quickly made and may be kept for its specific purpose or altered for  other work.
