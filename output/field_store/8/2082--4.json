I believe one of these mummies is now in the  British Museum. From Mummy Hall you pass into Gothic Avenue, where the  resemblance to Gothic architecture very perceptibly increases. The wall  juts out in pointed arches, and pillars, on the sides of which are  various grotesque combinations of rock. One is an elephant's head. The  tusks and sleepy eyes are quite perfect; the trunk, at first very  distinct, gradually recedes, and is lost in the rock. On another pillar  is a lion's head; on another, a human head with a wig, called Lord  Lyndhurst, from its resemblance to that dignitary.    From this gallery you can step into a side cave, in which is an immense  pit, called the Lover's Leap. A huge rock, fourteen or fifteen feet  long, like an elongated sugar-loaf running to a sharp point, projects  half way over this abyss. It makes one shudder to see the guide walk  almost to the end of this projectile bridge, over such an awful chasm.  As you pass along, the Gothic Avenue narrows, until you come to a porch  composed of the first separate columns in the cave. The stalactite and  stalagmite formations unite in these irregular masses of brownish  yellow, which, when the light shines through them, look like transparent  amber. They are sonorous as a clear-toned bell. A pendent mass, called  the Bell, has been unfortunately broken, by being struck too powerfully.    [Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE GOTHIC GATE.]    The porch of columns leads to the Gothic Chapel, which has the circular  form appropriate to a true church. A number of pure stalactite columns  fill the nave with arches, which in many places form a perfect Gothic  roof. The stalactites fall in rich festoons, strikingly similar to the  highly ornamented chapel of Henry VII. Four columns in the centre form a  separate arch by themselves, like trees twisted into a grotto, in all  irregular and grotesque shapes. Under this arch stands Wilkins'  arm-chair, a stalactite formation, well adapted to the human figure. The  Chapel is the most beautiful specimen of the Gothic in the cave. Two or  three of the columns have richly foliated capitals, like the Corinthian.    If you turn back to the main avenue, and strike off in another  direction, you enter a vast room, with several projecting galleries,  called the Ball Room. In close vicinity, as if arranged by the severer  school of theologians, is a large amphitheatre, called Satan's Council  Chamber. From the centre rises a mountain of big stones, rudely piled  one above another, in a gradual slope, nearly one hundred feet high. On  the top rests a huge rock, big as a house, called Satan's Throne. The  vastness, the gloom, partially illuminated by the glare of lamps,  forcibly remind one of Lucifer on his throne, as represented by Martin  in his illustrations of Milton. It requires little imagination to  transform the uncouth rocks all around the throne, into attendant  demons. Indeed, throughout the cave, Martin's pictures are continually  brought to mind, by the unearthly effect of intense gleams of light on  black masses of shadow. In this Council Chamber, the rocks, with  singular appropriateness, change from an imitation of Gothic  architecture, to that of the Egyptian. The dark, massive walls resemble  a series of Egyptian tombs, in dull and heavy outline. In this place is  an angle, which forms the meeting point of several caves, and is  therefore considered one of the finest points of view. Here parties  usually stop and make arrangements to kindle the Bengal Lights, which  travellers always carry with them. It has a strange and picturesque  effect to see groups of people dotted about, at different points of  view, their lamps hidden behind stones, and the light streaming into the  thick darkness, through chinks in the rocks. When the lights begin to  burn, their intense radiance casts a strong glare on Satan's Throne; the  whole of the vast amphitheatre is revealed to view, and you can peer  into the deep recesses of two other caves beyond. For a few moments,  gigantic proportions and uncouth forms stand out in the clear, strong  gush of brilliant light! and then--all is darkness. The effect is so  like magic, that one almost expects to see towering genii striding down  the deep declivities, or startled by the brilliant flare, shake off  their long sleep among the dense black shadows.    [Illustration: THE GOTHIC CHAPEL.]    If you enter one of the caves revealed in the distance, you find  yourself in a deep ravine, with huge piles of gray rock jutting out more  and more, till they nearly meet at top. Looking upward, through this  narrow aperture, you see, high, high above you, a vaulted roof of  _black_ rock, studded with brilliant spar, like constellations in the  sky, seen at midnight, from the deep clefts of a mountain. This is  called the Star Chamber. It makes one think of Schiller's grand  description of William Tell sternly waiting for Gessler, among the  shadows of the Alps, and of Wordsworth's picture of                        \"Yorkshire dales      Among the rocks and winding scars,      Where deep and low the hamlets lie,      Beneath their little patch of sky,      And little lot of stars.\"    [Illustration: THE STAR CHAMBER.]    In this neighborhood is a vast, dreary chamber, which Stephen, the  guide, called Bandit's Hall, the first moment his eye rested on it; and  the name is singularly expressive of its character. Its ragged roughness  and sullen gloom are indescribable. The floor is a mountainous heap of  loose stones, and not an inch of even surface could be found on roof or  walls. Imagine two or three travellers, with their lamps, passing  through this place of evil aspect. The deep, suspicions-looking recesses  and frightful crags are but partially revealed in the feeble light. All  at once, a Bengal Light blazes up, and every black rock and frowning  cliff stands out in the brilliant glare. The contrast is sublime beyond  imagination. It is as if a man had seen the hills and trees of this  earth only in the dim outline of a moonless night, and they should, for  the first time, be revealed to him in the gushing glory of the morning  sun. But the greatest wonder in this region of the cave, is Mammoth  Dome--a giant among giants. It is so immensely high and vast, that three  of the most powerful Bengal Lights illuminate it very imperfectly. That  portion of the ceiling which becomes visible, is three hundred feet  above your head, and remarkably resembles the aisles of Westminster  Abbey. It is supposed that the top of this dome is near the surface of  the ground. Another route from the Devil's Council Chamber conducts you  to a smooth, level path, called Pensacola Avenue. Here are numerous  formations of crystallized gypsum, but not as beautiful or as various as  are found farther on. From various slopes and openings, caves above and  below are visible. The Mecca's shrine of this pilgrimage is Angelica's  Grotto, completely lined and covered with the largest and richest dog's  tooth spar. A person who visited the place, a few years since, laid his  sacrilegious hands upon it, while the guide's back was turned towards  whim. He coolly demolished a magnificent mass of spar, sparkling most  conspicuously on the very centre of the arch, and wrote his own  insignificant name in its place. This was _his_ fashion of securing  immortality! It is well that fairies and giants are powerless in the  nineteenth century, else had the indignant genii of the cave crushed his  bones to impalpable powder.    [Illustration: THE BOTTOMLESS PIT.]    If you pass behind Satan's Throne, by a narrow ascending path, you come  into a vast hall where there is nothing but naked rock. This empty  dreary place is appropriately called the Deserted Chamber. Walking along  the verge, you arrive at another avenue, inclosing sulphur springs. Here  the guide warns you of the vicinity of a pit, one hundred and twenty  feet deep, in the shape of a saddle. Stooping over it, and looking  upward, you see an abyss of precisely the same shape over head; a fact  which indicates that it began in the upper region, and was merely  interrupted by this chamber.    From this, you may enter a narrow and very tortuous path, called the  Labyrinth, which leads to an immense split, or chasm, in the rocks. Here  is placed a ladder, down which you descend twenty-five or thirty feet,  and enter a narrow cave below, which brings you to a combination of rock  called the Gothic Window. You stand in this recess, while the guided  ascends huge cliffs overhead, and kindles Bengal Lights, by the help of  which you see, two hundred feet above you, a Gothic dome of one solid  rock, perfectly overawing in its vastness and height. Below, is an abyss  of darkness, which no eye but the Eternal can fathom. If, instead of  descending the ladder, you pass straight alongside the chasm, you arrive  at the Bottomless Pit, beyond which no one ever ventured to proceed till  1838. To this fact we probably owe the meagre account given by Lieber,  in the Encyclopaedia Americana. He says, \"This cave is more remarkable  for extent, than the variety or beauty of its productions; having none  of the beautiful stalactites found in many other caves.\" For a long  period this pit was considered bottomless, because, when stones were  thrown into it, they reverberated and reverberated along the sides, till  lost to the ear, but seemed to find no resting place. It has since been  sounded, and found to be one hundred "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2096"],[0,"A Smaller History of Greece: from the Earliest Times to the Roman Conquest (#10)"],[1,"under the name of CLERUCI.    The successes of Athens excited the jealousy of the Spartans, and they  now resolved to make a third attempt to overthrow the Athenian  democracy.  They had meantime discovered the deception which had been  practised upon them by the Delphic oracle; And they invited Hippias to  come from Sigeum to Sparta, in order to restore him to Athens.  The  experience of the last campaign had taught them that they could not  calculate upon the co-operation of their allies without first obtaining  their approval of the project; and they therefore summoned deputies  from all their allies to meet at Sparta, in order to determine  respecting the restoration of Hippias.  But the proposal was received  with universal repugnance; and the Spartans found it necessary to  abandon their project.  Hippias returned to Sigeum, and afterwards  proceeded to the court of Darius.    Athens had now entered upon her glorious career.  The institutions of  Clisthenes had given her citizens a personal interest in the welfare  and the grandeur of their country.  A spirit of the warmest patriotism  rapidly sprang up among them; and the history of the Persian wars,  which followed almost immediately, exhibits a striking proof of the  heroic sacrifices which they were prepared to make for the liberty and  independence of their state.        CHAPTER VI.    THE GREEK COLONIES.    The vast number of the Greek colonies, their wide-spread diffusion over  all parts of the Mediterranean, which thus became a kind of Grecian  lake, and their rapid growth in wealth, power, and intelligence, afford  the most striking proofs of the greatness of this wonderful people.  Civil dissensions and a redundant population were the chief causes of  the origin of most of the Greek colonies.  They were usually undertaken  with the approbation of the cities from which they issued, and under  the management of leaders appointed by them.  But a Greek colony was  always considered politically independent of the mother-city and  emancipated from its control.  The only connexion between them was one  of filial affection and of common religious ties.  Almost every  colonial Greek city was built upon the sea-coast, and the site usually  selected contained a hill sufficiently lofty to form an acropolis.    The Grecian colonies may be arranged in four groups:  1. Those founded  in Asia Minor and the adjoining islands;  2. Those in the western parts  of the Mediterranean, in Italy, Sicily, Gaul, and Spain;  3. Those in  Africa;  4. Those in Epirus, Macedonia, and Thrace.    1. The earliest Greek colonies were those founded on the western shores  of Asia Minor.  They were divided into three great masses, each bearing  the name of that section of the Greek race with which they claimed  affinity.  The AEolic cities covered the northern part of this coast,  together with the islands of Lesbos and Tenedos; the Ionians occupied  the centre, with the islands of Chios and Samos; and the Dorians the  southern portion, with the islands of Rhodes and Cos.  Most of these  colonies were founded in consequence of the changes in the population  of Greece which attended the conquest of Peloponnesus by the Dorians.  The Ionic cities were early distinguished by a spirit of commercial  enterprise, and soon rose superior in wealth and in power to their  AEolian and Dorian neighbours.  Among the Ionic cities themselves  Miletus and Ephesus were the most flourishing, Grecian literature took  its rise in the AEolic and Ionic cities of Asia Minor.  Homer was  probably a native of Smyrna.  Lyric poetry flourished in the island of  Lesbos, where Sappho and Alcaeus were born.  The Ionic cities were also  the seats of the earliest schools of Grecian philosophy.  Thales, who  founded the Ionic school of philosophy, was a native of Miletus.  Halicarnassus was one of the most important of the Doric cities, of  which Herodotus was a native, though he wrote in the Ionic dialect.    2. The earliest Grecian settlement in Italy was Cumae in Campania,  situated near Cape Misenum, on the Tyrrhenian sea.  It is said to have  been a joint colony from the AEolic Cyme in Asia and from Chalcis in  Euboea, and to have been founded, according to the common chronology,  in B.C. 1050.  Cumae was for a long time the most flourishing city in  Campania; and it was not till its decline in the fifth century before  the Christian era that Capua rose into importance.    The earliest Grecian settlement in Sicily was founded in B.C. 735.  The  extraordinary fertility of the land soon attracted numerous colonists  from various parts of Greece, and there arose on the coasts of Sicily a  succession of flourishing cities.  Of these, Syracuse and Agrigentum,  both Dorian colonies, became the most powerful.  The former was founded  by the Corinthians in B.C. 734, and at the time of its greatest  prosperity contained a population of 500,000 souls, and was surrounded  by walls twenty-two miles in circuit.  Its greatness, however, belongs  to a later period of Grecian history.    The Grecian colonies in southern Italy began to be planted at nearly  the same time as in Sicily.  They eventually lined the whole southern  coast, as far as Cumae on the one sea and Tarentum on the other.  They  even surpassed those in Sicily in number and importance; and so  numerous and flourishing did they become, that the south of Italy  received the name of Magna Graecia.  Of these, two of the earliest and  most prosperous were Sybaris and Croton, both situated upon the gulf of  Tarentum, and both of Achaean origin.  Sybaris was planted in B.C. 720  and Croton in B.C. 710. For two centuries they seem to have lived in  harmony, and we know scarcely anything of their history till their  fatal contest in B.C. 510, which ended in the ruin of Sybaris.  During  the whole of this period they were two of the most flourishing cities  in all Hellas.  Sybaris in particular attained to an extraordinary  degree of wealth, and its inhabitants were so notorious for their  luxury, effeminacy, and debauchery, that their name has become  proverbial for a voluptuary in ancient and modern times.  Croton was  the chief seat of the Pythagorean philosophy.  Pythagroras was a native  of Samos, but emigrated to Croton, where he met with the most wonderful  success in the propagation of his views.  He established a kind of  religious brotherhood, closely united by a sacred vow.  They believed  in the transmigration of souls, and their whole training was designed  to make them temperate and self-denying.  The doctrines of Pythagoras  spread through many of the other cities of Magna Graecia.    Of the numerous other Greek settlements in the south of Italy, those of  Locri, Rhegium, and Tarentum were the meet important. Locri was founded  by the Locrians from the mother-country in B.C. 683.  The laws of this  city were drawn up by one of its citizens, named Zaleucus, and so  averse were the Locrians to any change in them, that whoever proposed a  new law had to appear in the public assembly with a rope round his  neck, which was immediately tightened if he failed to convince his  fellow-citizens of the necessity of the alteration.  Rhegium, situated  on the straits of Messina, opposite Sicily, was colonised by the  Chalcidians, but received a large body of Messenians, who settled here  at the close of the Messenian war.  Anaxilas, tyrant of Rhegium about  B.C. 500, was of Messenian descent.  He seized the Sicilian Zancle on  the opposite coast, and changed its name into Messana, which it still  bears.  Tarentum was a colony from Sparta and was founded about B.C.  708.  After the destruction of Sybaris it was the most powerful and  flourishing city in Magna Graecia, and continued to enjoy great  prosperity till its subjugation by the Romans.  Although of Spartan  origin, it did not maintain Spartan habits, and its citizens were noted  at a later time for their love of luxury and pleasure.    The Grecian settlements in the distant countries of Gaul and Spain were  not numerous.  The most celebrated was Massalia, the modern Marseilles,  founded by the Ionic Phocaeans in B.C. 600.    3. The northern coast of Africa, between the territories of Carthage  and Egypt, was also occupied by Greek colonists.  The city of Cyrene  was founded about B.C. 630.  It was a colony from the island of Thera  in the AEgean, which was itself a colony from Sparta.  The situation of  Cyrene was well chosen.  It stood on the edge of a range of hills, at  the distance of ten miles from the Mediterranean, of which it commanded  a fine view.  These hills descended by a succession of terraces to the  port of the town, called Apollonia.  The climate was most salubrious,  and the soil was distinguished by extraordinary fertility.  With these  advantages Cyrene rapidly grew in wealth and power; and its greatness  is attested by the immense remains which still mark its desolate site.  Cyrene planted several colonies in the adjoining district, of which  Barca, founded about B.C. 560, was the most important.    4. There were several Grecian colonies situated on the eastern side of  the Ionian sea, in Epirus and its immediate neighbourhood.  Of these  the island of Corcyra, now called Corfu, was the most wealthy and  powerful.  It was founded by the Corinthians about B.C. 700, and in  consequence of its commercial activity it soon became a formidable  rival to the mother-city. Hence a war broke out between these two  states at an early period; and the most ancient naval battle on record  was the one fought between their fleets in B.C. 664.  The dissensions  between the mother-city and her colony are frequently mentioned in  Grecian history, and were one of the immediate causes of the  Peloponnesian war.  Notwithstanding their quarrels they joined in  planting four Grecian colonies upon the same line of coast--Leucas,  Anactorium, Apollonia, and Epidamnus.    The colonies in Macedonia and"]]]
