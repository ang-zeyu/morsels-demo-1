Washington himself (and he at least was no      dissembler--from him, at least, there never came any promise or      assurance that did not deserve the most implicit credit) had only      a few months before presided at a meeting of Fairfax County, in      Virginia. That meeting, while claiming relief of grievances, had      also at his instance adopted the following Resolve:--'That it is      our greatest wish and inclination, as well as interest, to      continue our connection with, and dependence upon, the British      Government.' But further still, although the first Congress was      praised by Chatham for its moderate counsels, and although the      calmer voice of history has ratified the praise, we learn that      these moderate counsels did not lag behind, but rather exceeded      and outran the prevailing sentiment in many of the colonies. To      this fact we find an unimpeachable testimony in the letters of      President Reed, who, writing to a friend in strict confidence,      laments that 'The proceedings of Congress have been pitched on too      high a key for some of those middle provinces.' With such      feelings, how gladly, how gratefully would they have welcomed the      hand of reconciliation stretched out by the Parliament of England!      It may be true, indeed, that such feelings as these did not      prevail in all, or nearly all, the colonies. It may be true,      especially, that no amount of good government, of forbearance, or      of kindness, would have won back Massachusetts. But herein lay, as      I think, the especial force and efficacy of Lord Chatham's scheme,      that it did not refer the questions of parliamentary supremacy and      colonial taxation to the decision of any one province; but, as the      Americans themselves desired, to the decision of a Congress      composed from all the provinces, so that disaffection, however      firmly rooted here and there, would of course be overpowered by a      loyal and large majority. Nor do I believe that the proposal of a      new grant to the Crown, and the consequent necessity of increased      taxation to the people, would have interposed any serious      obstacle. The load of taxation on the colonies was at this period      light indeed: according to a calculation made by Lord North in      that very year, each inhabitant of England paid in taxes, upon an      average, not less than twenty-five shillings annually; but each      inhabitant of British America no more than sixpence. The      experience of the closely-following Revolutionary war proves how      easily and readily, when their feelings were involved, the      Americans could raise far greater supplies. And surely had Lord      Chatham's scheme prevailed, their feelings would have been      involved. They would have been pleased and proud to show that      their previous refusal to pay taxes sprang from principle, and not      from inability or disaffection; and that, when once their views of      principle had been complied with, they could contribute with no      sparing hand to the exigencies of their countrymen, and to the      service of their king.\"      The opinion of Lord Mahon that, even after Burgoyne's surrender, and the  treaty of alliance between France and America, the colonies might have  been preserved, had Lord Chatham lived and returned to office, we think  entirely erroneous. Our separation from England, though there had been no  stamp act or tea tax, was inevitable.    Lord Mahon is exceedingly fond of personal portraiture, in which he is  sometimes very successful. One of his most carefully-elaborated  performances in this way has for its subject Washington, and in the dozen  pages he devotes to the analysis of the character of the great chief he  has displayed his best abilities, though, we confess, without suggesting  any thing very novel. He dislikes Franklin, and loses no opportunity of  imputing to him personal dishonesty. We think the influence of Mr. William  B. Reed's Life of President Reed is traceable in almost every allusion  made by Lord Mahon to our philosopher. Without further observation upon  the qualities of the work, we avail ourselves of the possession of an  early copy of it to present our readers with some of the most striking  passages pencilled in a hasty reading.                                     WASHINGTON.        During many years did Washington continue to enjoy the pleasures      and fulfil the duties of an independent country gentleman.      Field-sports divided his time with the cultivation and improvement      of his land, and the sales of his tobacco; he showed kindness to      his dependents, and hospitality to his friends; and having been      elected one of the House of Burgesses in Virginia, he was,      whenever that House met, exact in his attendance. To that      well-regulated mind nothing within the course of its ordinary and      appointed avocations seemed unworthy of its care. His ledgers and      day-books were kept by himself: he took note of all the houses      where he partook of hospitality, so that not even the smallest      courtesies might pass by unremembered; and until his press of      business in the Revolutionary War he was wont every evening to set      down the variations of the weather during the preceding day. It      was also his habit through life, whenever he wished to possess      himself perfectly of the contents of any paper, to transcribe it      in his own hand, and apparently with deliberation, so that no      point might escape his notice. Many copies of this kind were after      his death found among his manuscripts.        We may observe, however, that in the mind of Washington      punctuality and precision did not, as we often find them, turn in      any degree to selfishness. On the contrary, he was rather careless      of small points where only his own comfort was concerned. Thus he      could seldom be persuaded to take any remedy, or desist from any      business, whenever he caught a cold, but used to say, \"let it go      as it came!\"        Nor yet was his constant regularity of habits attended by undue      formality of manner. In one of his most private letters there      appears given incidentally, and as it were by chance, a golden      rule upon that subject:--\"As to the gentlemen you mention I cannot      charge myself with incivility, or what in my opinion is      tantamount, ceremonious civility.        In figure Washington was thin and tall (above six feet high), in      countenance grave, unimpassioned, and benign. An inborn worth, an      unaffected dignity, beamed forth in every look as in every word      and deed. His first appearance and address might not convey the      idea of superior talents; such at least was the remark of his      accomplished countryman, Mr. Gallatin; but no man, whether friend      or enemy, ever viewed without respect the noble simplicity of his      demeanor, the utter absence in him of every artifice and every      affectation.        It has been justly remarked that of General Washington there are      fewer anecdotes to tell than perhaps of any other great man on      record. So equally framed were the features of his mind, so      harmonious all its proportions, that no one quality rose salient      above the rest. There were none of those chequered ques, none of      those warring emotions, in which Biography delights. There was no      contrast of lights and shades, no flickering of the flame; it was      a mild light that seldom dazzled, but that ever cheered and      warmed. His contemporaries or his close observers, as Mr.      Jefferson and Mr. Gallatin, assert that he had naturally strong      passions, but had attained complete mastery over them. In      self-control indeed he has never been surpassed. If sometimes on      rare occasions, and on strong provocation, there was wrung from      him a burst of anger, it was almost instantly quelled by the      dominion of his will. He decided surely, though he deliberated      slowly; nor could any urgency or peril move him from his serene      composure, his calm and clear-headed good sense. Integrity and      truth were also ever present in his mind. Not a single instance,      as I believe, can be found in his whole career when he was      impelled by any but an upright motive, or endeavored to attain an      object by any but worthy means. Such are some of the high      qualities which have justly earned for General Washington the      admiration even of the country he opposed, and not merely the      admiration but the gratitude and affection of his own. Such was      the pure and upright spirit to which, when its toils were over and      its earthly course had been run, was offered the unanimous homage      of the assembled Congress, all clad in deep mourning for their      common loss, as to \"the man first in war, first in peace, and      first in the hearts of his fellow-citizens.\" At this day in the      United States the reverence for his character is, as it should be,      deep and universal, and not confined, as with nearly all our      English statesmen, to one party, one province, or one creed. Such      reverence for Washington is felt even by those who wander furthest      from the paths in which he trod. A President when recommending      measures of aggression and invasion can still refer to him whose      rule was ever to arm only in self-defence as to \"the greatest and      best of men!\" States which exult in their bankruptcy as a proof of      their superior shrewdness, and have devised \"Repudiation\" as a      newer and more graceful term for it, yet look up to their great      General--the very soul of good faith and honor--with their reverence      unimpaired!\"                                    PATRICK HENRY.

In this case we perceive the cause as well  as the effect. But, when we see an apple fall from a tree to the ground,  we say that the cause of the fall is the force of gravitation exercised  by the superior mass of the earth on the inferior mass of the apple. In  this case, though we perceive the effect, we do not perceive the cause,  we only infer it by a process of reasoning from experience. Causes of  the latter sort may be called inferential or hypothetical causes to  distinguish them from those which are perceived. Of the two classes of  causes a deity belongs in general, if not universally, to the second,  that is, to the inferential or hypothetical causes; for as a rule at all  events his existence is not perceived by our senses but inferred by our  reason. To say that he has never appeared in visible and tangible form  to men would be to beg the question; it would be to make an assertion  which is incapable of proof and which is contradicted by a multitude of  contrary affirmations recorded in the traditions or the sacred books of  many races; but without being rash we may perhaps say that such  appearances, if they ever took place, belong to a past order of events  and need hardly be reckoned with at the present time. For all practical  purposes, therefore, God is now a purely inferential or hypothetical  cause; he may be invoked to explain either our own thoughts and  feelings, our impulses and emotions, or the manifold states and  processes of external nature; he may be viewed either as the inspirer of  the one or the creator and preserver of the other; and according as he  is mainly regarded from the one point of view or the other, the  conception of the divine nature tends to beget one of two very different  types of piety. To the man who traces the finger of God in the workings  of his own mind, the deity appears to be far closer than he seems to the  man who only infers the divine existence from the marvellous order,  harmony, and beauty of the external world; and we need not wonder that  the faith of the former is of a more fervent temper and supplies him  with more powerful incentives to a life of active devotion than the calm  and rational faith of the latter. We may conjecture that the piety of  most great religious reformers has belonged to the former rather than to  the latter type; in other words, that they have believed in God because  they felt, or imagined that they felt, him stirring in their own hearts  rather than because they discerned the handiwork of a divine artificer  in the wonderful mechanism of nature.    [Sidenote: Besides the two sorts of gods already distinguished, namely  natural gods and living human gods, there is a third sort which has  played an important part in history, namely, the spirits of deified dead  men. Euhemerism.]    Thus far I have distinguished two sorts of gods whom man discovers or  creates for himself by the exercise of his unaided faculties, to wit  natural gods, whom he infers from his observation of external nature,  and human gods or inspired men, whom he recognises by virtue of certain  extraordinary mental manifestations in himself or in others. But there  is another class of human gods which I have not yet mentioned and which  has played a very important part in the evolution of theology. I mean  the deified spirits of dead men. To judge by the accounts we possess not  only of savage and barbarous tribes but of some highly civilised  peoples, the worship of the human dead has been one of the commonest and  most influential forms of natural religion, perhaps indeed the commonest  and most influential of all. Obviously it rests on the supposition that  the human personality in some form, whether we call it a soul, a spirit,  a ghost, or what not, can survive death and thereafter continue for a  longer or shorter time to exercise great power for good or evil over the  destinies of the living, who are therefore compelled to propitiate the  shades of the dead out of a regard for their own safety and well-being.  This belief in the survival of the human spirit after death is  world-wide; it is found among men in all stages of culture from the  lowest to the highest; we need not wonder therefore that the custom of  propitiating the ghosts or souls of the departed should be world-wide  also. No doubt the degree of attention paid to ghosts is not the same in  all cases; it varies with the particular degree of power attributed to  each of them; the spirits of men who for any reason were much feared in  their lifetime, such as mighty warriors, chiefs, and kings, are more  revered and receive far more marks of homage than the spirits of common  men; and it is only when this reverence and homage are carried to a very  high pitch that they can properly be described as a deification of the  dead. But that dead men have thus been raised to the rank of deities in  many lands, there is abundant evidence to prove. And quite apart from  the worship paid to those spirits which are admitted by their  worshippers to have once animated the bodies of living men, there is  good reason to suspect that many gods, who rank as purely mythical  beings, were once men of flesh and blood, though their true history has  passed out of memory or rather been transformed by legend into a myth,  which veils more or less completely the real character of the imaginary  deity. The theory that most or all gods originated after this fashion,  in other words, that the worship of the gods is little or nothing but  the worship of dead men, is known as Euhemerism from Euhemerus, the  ancient Greek writer who propounded it. Regarded as a universal  explanation of the belief in gods it is certainly false; regarded as a  partial explanation of the belief it is unquestionably true; and perhaps  we may even go further and say, that the more we penetrate into the  inner history of natural religion, the larger is seen to be the element  of truth contained in Euhemerism. For the more closely we look at many  deities of natural religion, the more distinctly do we seem to perceive,  under the quaint or splendid pall which the mythical fancy has wrapt  round their stately figures, the familiar features of real men, who once  shared the common joys and the common sorrows of humanity, who trod  life's common road to the common end.    [Sidenote: The deification of dead men presupposes the immortality of  the human soul, or rather its survival for a longer or shorter time  after death.]    When we ask how it comes about that dead men have so often been raised  to the rank of divinities, the first thing to be observed is that all  such deifications must, if our theory is correct, be inferences drawn  from experience of some sort; they must be hypotheses devised to explain  the unperceived causes of certain phenomena, whether of the human mind  or of external nature. All of them imply, as I have said, a belief that  the conscious human personality, call it the soul, the spirit, or what  you please, can survive the body and continue to exist in a disembodied  state with unabated or even greatly increased powers for good or evil.  This faith in the survival of personality after death may for the sake  of brevity be called a faith in immortality, though the term immortality  is not strictly correct, since it seems to imply eternal duration,  whereas the idea of eternity is hardly intelligible to many primitive  peoples, who nevertheless firmly believe in the continued existence, for  a longer or shorter time, of the human spirit after the dissolution of  the body. Now the faith in the immortality of the soul or, to speak more  correctly, in the continued existence of conscious human personality  after death, is, as I remarked before, exceedingly common among men at  all levels of intellectual evolution from the lowest upwards; certainly  it is not peculiar to adherents of the higher religions, but is held as  an unquestionable truth by at least the great majority of savage and  barbarous peoples as to whose ideas we possess accurate information;  indeed it might be hard to point to any single tribe of men, however  savage, of whom we could say with certainty that the faith is totally  wanting among them.    [Sidenote: The question of immortality is a fundamental problem of  natural theology in the wider sense.]    Hence if we are to explain the deification of dead men, we must first  explain the widespread belief in immortality; we must answer the  question, how does it happen that men in all countries and at all stages  of ignorance or knowledge so commonly suppose that when they die their  consciousness will still persist for an indefinite time after the decay  of the body? To answer that question is one of the fundamental problems  of natural theology, not indeed in the full sense of the word theology,  if we confine the term strictly to a reasoned knowledge of a God; for  the example of Buddhism proves that a belief in the existence of the  human soul after death is quite compatible with disbelief in a deity.  But if we may use, as I think we may, the phrase natural theology in an  extended sense to cover theories which, though they do not in themselves  affirm the existence of a God, nevertheless appear to be one of the  deepest and most fruitful sources of the belief in his reality, then we  may legitimately say that the doctrine of human immortality does fall  within the scope of natural theology. What then is its origin? How is it  that men so commonly believe themselves to be immortal?    [Sidenote: If there is any natural knowledge of immortality, it must be  acquired either by intuition or experience; it is apparently not given  by intuition; hence it must be acquired, if at all, by experience.]    If there is any natural knowledge of human immortality, it must be  acquired either by intuition or by experience; there is no other way.  Now whether other men from a simple contemplation "]]]
