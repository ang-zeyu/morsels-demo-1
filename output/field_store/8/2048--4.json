[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20470"],[0,"Etiquette (#10)"],[1,"on, allowing time to pay respects to the host and hostess,  without haste of manner, before the dinner is announced.    A gentleman wears a dress suit at dinner.  A lady wears a handsome  gown, \"dinner dress\" being \"full dress;\" differing, however, from the  evening party or reception gown in the kind of fabrics used.  The most  filmy gauzes are suitable for a ball costume; while dinner dress--for  any but very young ladies--is usually of more substantial  materials--rich silk or velvet softened in effect with choice lace, or  made brilliant with jet trimmings.    When the dinner party is strictly formal, and the company evenly  matched in pairs, the following order is observed:    Each gentleman finds in the hall, as he enters, a card bearing his name  and the name of the lady whom he is to take out; also, a small  _boutonniere_, which he pins on his coat.  If the lady is a stranger,  he asks to be presented to her, and establishes an easy conversation  before moving toward the dining-room.      THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF DINNER    When dinner is ready the fact is made known to the hostess by the  butler, or maid-servant, who comes to the door and quietly says \"Dinner  is served.\"  A bell is never rung for dinner, nor for any other formal  meal.    The host leads the way, taking out the lady who is given the place of  first consideration; the most distinguished woman, the greatest  stranger, the most elderly--whatever the basis of distinction.  Other  couples follow in the order assigned to them, each gentleman seating  the lady on his right.  The hostess comes last, with the most  distinguished male guest.  If there is a footman, or more than one, the  chairs are deftly placed for each guest; but if only a maid is in  waiting, each gentleman arranges his own and his partner's chairs as  quietly as possible.    As soon as the company are seated, each one removes the bread; and the  napkin, partially unfolded, is laid across the lap.  It is not tucked  in at the neck or the vest front, or otherwise disposed as a  feeding-bib.  It is a towel, for wiping the lips and fingers in  emergencies, but should be used unobtrusively--not flourished like a  flag of truce.      THE SERVING OF THE DINNER    The servant is ready to hand from the side-board any condiments desired  for the oysters, which are promptly disposed of.  It may be remarked at  the outset, that everything at table is handed at the left, _except  wine_, which is offered at the right.  Ladies are served first.    After the oyster-plates are removed, the soup is served from the side  table--a half ladleful to each plate being considered the correct  quantity.  The rule regarding soup is double, you must, and you must  not.  You must accept it (whether you eat it or merely pretend to), but  you must not ask for a second helping, since to do so would prolong a  course that is merely an \"appetizer\" preparatory to the substantials.    The soup-plates are removed, and the fish immediately appears, served  on plates with mashed potatoes or salad, or sometimes both, in which  case a separate dish is provided for the salad.  The _entrees_ follow  the fish, hot plates being provided, as required.  Dishes containing  the _entrees_ should have a large spoon and fork laid upon them, and  should be held low, so that the guest may help himself easily.    Again the dishes are removed.  Here we may pause to remark that the  prompt and orderly removal of the dishes after each successive course  is a salient feature of skillful waiting.  The accomplished waiter  never betrays haste or nervousness, but his every movement \"tells,\" and  that, too, without clatter, or the dropping of small articles, or the  dripping of sauces.  The plates, etc., vanish from the table--whither,  we observe not.  The waiter in the dining-room must have the  co-operation of the servant behind the scenes, to receive and convey  the relays of dishes to the kitchen.  However it is managed, and it  _must be managed_, the nearer the operation can appear to be a \"magic  transformation,\" the better.    To return; the roast is the next course.  The carving is done at the  side table.  Guests are consulted as to their preference for \"rare\" or  \"well-done;\" and the meat, in thin slices, is served on hot plates,  with vegetables at discretion on the same plate, separate vegetable  dishes--except for salads--not being used on private dinner tables.  Certain vegetables, as sweet corn on the cob, may be regarded as a  course by themselves, being too clumsy to be disposed of conveniently  on a plate with other things.    The game course is next in order (if it is included, as it generally is  in an elaborate dinner).  Celery is an appropriate accompaniment of the  game course.  The salad is sometimes served with the game; otherwise it  follows as a course by itself.    The salad marks the end of the heavy courses.  The crumb tray is  brought, and the table-cloth is cleared of all stray fragments.  A  rolled napkin makes a quiet brush for this purpose, especially on a  finely polished damask cloth.    The dessert is now in order.  Finger-bowls and doylies are brought in  on the dessert-plates.  Each person at once removes the bowl and doyley  to make ready for whatever is to be put on the plate.    Ices, sweets (pastry and confections), cheese, follow in course; and,  finally, the fruits and bon-bons.  Strong coffee is served last of all,  in small cups.  Fashion decrees _cafe noir_, and few lovers of cream  care to rebel on so formal an occasion as a dinner; but when the  formality is not too rigid, the little cream jug may be smuggled in for  those who prefer _cafe au lait_.    Water is the staple drink of the American dinner-table.  A palatable  table water, like Apollinaris, well iced, is an elegant substitute for  wine when habit or conscience forbids the latter.    When wine is served with the different courses at dinner, the  appropriate use is as follows: with soup, sherry; with the fish,  chablis, hock, or sauterne; with the roast, claret and champagne; after  the game course, Madeira and port; with the dessert, sherry, claret, or  Burgundy.  After dinner are served champagne and other sparkling wines,  just off the ice, and served without decanting, a napkin being wrapped  around the wet bottle.    While wine may be accounted indispensable by many, the growing  sentiment in favor of its total banishment from the dinner-table has  this effect on the etiquette of the case, that the neglect to provide  wine for even a very formal dinner is not now the breach of good form  which it would have been held to be some years ago.  Such neglect has  been sanctioned by the example of acknowledged social leaders; and when  it is the exponent of a temperance principle it has the respect of  every diner-out, whatever his private choice in the matter.  No  _gentleman_ will grumble at the absence of wine at his host's table.  It is good form for a host to serve or _not_ serve wine, as he chooses;  it is very bad form for his guest to comment on his choice.  When any  one who is conscientiously opposed to wine-drinking, or for any reason  abstains, is present at a dinner where wine is served, he declines it  by simply laying his hand on the rim of his glass as the butler  approaches.  No words are necessary.  Apollinaris will take the place  of stronger waters, and no embarrassment follows to either host or  guest.  As to the moral involved, a silent example may be quite as  influential as an aggressive exhibition of one's principles.  Questions  of manners and morals are constantly elbowing one another, and it is a  nice point to decide when and how far duty requires one to defy  conventionality.  It is safe to say that only in extreme cases is this  ever necessary, or even permissible.  The hostess who simply _does not  offer wine to any guest under any circumstances_, is using her  influence effectively and courteously, especially when she supplies the  deficiency with delicious coffee and cocoa, fragrant tea, and, best and  _rarest_ of all, crystal clear, sparkling cold water.  By pointing out  a \"more excellent way,\" she is adding to her faith _virtue_.      MISCELLANEOUS POINTS    Extra knives and forks are brought in with any course that requires  them.  The preliminary lay-out is usually meant to provide all that the  scheme of the dinner will call for; but one must have a goodly supply  of silver and cutlery to avoid altogether the necessity for having some  of it washed and returned to the table during the progress of the  dinner.  It is very desirable to be amply equipped, as it facilitates  the prompt and orderly serving of the courses.    Fruit-knives are required, and ice-spoons, orange-spoons, and other  unique conceits in silver utensils may be provided with the dessert, if  one happens to own them; otherwise, plain forks and spoons do duty as  required.  The fork bears the chief burden of responsibility, being  used for everything solid or semi-solid, leaving the spoon to the  limited realm of soft custards and fruits that are so juicy as to elude  the tines of the fork.    The knife is held in hand as little as possible, being used only when  cutting is actually necessary, the fork easily separating most  vegetables, etc.  In the fish course, however, the knife is used to  assist in removing the troublesome small bones.    In holding the knife the fingers should not touch the blade, except  that the forefinger rests upon the upper edge not far below the shank  when the cutting requires some firmness of pressure.  The dinner knife  should be sharp enough to perform its office without too much muscular  effort, or the possible accident of a duck's wing flying unexpectedly  \"from cover\" under the ill-directed stress of a despairing carver's  hand.

We go  this way. Don't be frightened about to-morrow. I doubt if she says  anything; and if she does, we are all implicated.\"    The young people separated, still singing and laughing; never dreaming  of the storm brewing from their evening's prank.    \"Anne,\" pursued David, as they strolled down River Street together,  \"when I make my flying machine will you be afraid to take a sail with  me?\"    \"Never,\" replied Anne, \"but I wish it had been made in time to carry me  away from Miss Leece to-morrow morning.\"    And Anne's words had more meaning than either of them realized at the  time.    Imagine the surprise and horror of the Hallowe'en party when, next  morning, they discovered the effigy of Miss Leece planted right in front  of the Girls' High School!    And the teacher herself was the first to see the impious outrage.          CHAPTER VIII    MISS LEECE      Yes, there stood the hideous, grotesque effigy just where her abductors  had left her the night before, her green veil floating in the breezes.  As a figure of fun and an object of ridicule, she might not have created  more than a ripple with the faculty. But it was evident that Miss  Leece's function, even in effigy, was to make trouble.    And trouble was certainly brewing that memorable morning. The figure  itself might never have been recognized, but a placard which had been  pinned on the front of the old ulster left no room for doubt. Across it  had been inscribed in large printed letters:    \"THE MOST UNPOPULAR TEACHER IN SCHOOL.\"    No one dared take the effigy away for fear of being implicated.  Everybody had seen it, both men and women professors and the boys and  girls of the two schools. But it was not until Miss Thompson, the  principal of the Girls' High School, had arrived that the figure was  removed.    \"How could those boys have been so mean!\" exclaimed Grace to her three  friends just before the gong sounded. \"They might have known what would  happen.\"    There was an ominous quiet in the various class rooms all morning; but  nothing was said or done to indicate just when the storm would burst.  When the first class in algebra met, Anne trembled with fear, but Miss  Leece, in a robin's egg-blue dress, which offset the angry hue of her  complexion, was apparently too angry to trust herself to look in the  direction of the young girl and the lesson progressed without incident.    However, she was only biding her time.    \"Miss Pierson,\" she said, toward the end of the lesson, in a voice so  rasping as to make the girls fairly shiver, \"go to the blackboard and  demonstrate this problem.\"    Then she read aloud in the same disagreeable voice, the following  difficult problem:    \"'Train A starts from Chicago going thirty miles an hour. An hour later  Train B starts from Chicago going thirty-five miles an hour. How far  from Chicago will they be when Train B passes Train A?'\"    The girls looked up surprised. The problem was well in advance of what  they had been studying and Miss Leece was really asking Anne to recite  something she had not yet learned.    Anne hardly knew how to reply to the terrible woman who stood glowering  at her as if she would like to crush her to bits.    \"I'm sorry,\" said the girl. \"I cannot.\"    \"Miss Nesbit,\" said the teacher, \"will you demonstrate this problem?\"    Miriam rose with a little smile of triumph on her face and went to the  blackboard, where she worked out the problem.    \"Why, what on earth does the woman mean?\" whispered Grace. \"Are we  expected to learn lessons we have never been taught and has that horrid  Miriam been studying ahead?\"    \"I think I must be dreaming,\" replied Anne, looking sorrowfully at Miss  Leece.    \"Miss Pierson,\" thundered the teacher, \"you are aware, I believe, that I  permit no conversation in this class. Stupidity and inattention are not  to be supported in any student, and I must ask you to leave the room.\"    Anne rose in a dazed sort of way, looking very small and shabby as she  left the room.    But Miss Leece was not to come off so easily in the fight, and Anne had  a splendid champion in Grace Harlowe, who could not endure injustice and  was fearless where her rights or her friends' rights were concerned.    She rose quietly and faced the angry teacher, who already regretted  having gone so far.    \"If Miss Pierson is to be ordered from the room, Miss Leece, I shall  follow her. I spoke to her first. I was naturally surprised that you  gave out a problem so far in advance of our regular work. It is doubtful  if any girl in the class could do it except Miriam, and she must have  been prepared.\"    \"Miss Harlowe,\" said Miss Leece, stamping her foot, and again giving way  to rage, \"I must ask you to take your seat at once and never interfere  again with the way I conduct this class.\"    \"You conduct this class with injustice and violence, Miss Leece,\" said  Grace, turning very white, but holding herself in admirable control  considering the conduct of the older woman.    \"I am in no humor to be answered back this morning, Miss Harlowe, and I  would advise you to be careful,\" continued the enraged woman. \"I have  had enough to try me since last night and this morning. Miss Pierson  must answer to the principal for those insults, and her insubordination  just now has only made matters worse.\"    \"Miss Pierson has nothing to answer for which I have not, and I shall  join her,\" replied Grace, and she left the room.    Miss Leece was about to continue the lesson when Jessica, pale and  trembling, rose and followed her friend. Nora was next to go and in  another moment there was not a girl left in the algebra class except  Miriam and her four particular friends. The gong sounded as the last  pupil closed the door behind her, but there was little doubt that the  first class in algebra had gone on a strike.    The noon recess gong had sounded before the girls were able to meet and  talk about the incident, and, during the time that intervened, Anne had  received a summons in the form of a small note to meet the principal in  her office at three that afternoon. She said nothing to her friends,  however, and hid the envelope in her pocket.    The girls in IV. algebra gathered around their friends to hear the  story. They were indignant and expressed their readiness to join the  strike out of sympathy in case there was any more trouble.    \"They have no right to put such a violent woman over us,\" said Grace, as  she nibbled at a pickle and a cracker in the locker room. \"I wish they  would give me the opportunity. I should be more than willing to testify  to her behavior before the entire faculty and the school board  combined.\"    Anne, herself, the center of the whole affair was very quiet. This  remarkable young girl seemed to possess some secret force that she was  able to draw upon when she most needed it.    \"Anne, you precious child,\" exclaimed the impetuous Nora, \"you must not  get scared. Whatever happens, the whole class means to stand by you.  Don't we, girls?\"    \"Yes,\" came from all sides.    \"I don't think anything in particular will happen,\" replied Anne. \"I  believe Miss Leece really wants to prevent my winning the prize. That's  all.\"    \"She has certainly adopted a pet,\" cried Marian Barber.    \"What did Miriam Nesbit mean by studying ahead like that?\" exclaimed  another. \"It was disloyal to the whole class.\"    \"It looks very much as if they had fixed it up between them,\" continued  Grace. \"I'm sorry about the effigy, but I won't stand that kind of  favoritism. It's mean and underhanded.\"    After school Anne lingered in the corridor until the other girls had  gone. Then she made her way slowly to the office of the principal. \"Come  in,\" came the answer to her timid knock.    Miss Thompson, the principal, was a fine woman, much beloved by the  people of Oakdale where she had served as principal of the Girls' High  School for many years. She had adjusted numerous difficulties in her  time, but never such a knotty problem as the present one. It was  incredible that Anne Pierson, who stood so well in her classes that she  had already been mentioned by the faculty, should have engaged in such  an escapade as Miss Leece had accused her of.    \"Sit down,\" she said kindly to the young girl, whose small, tired face  appealed to her sympathies. \"What is this trouble between you and Miss  Leece, Miss Pierson?\" she continued, plunging into the subject.    \"I do not know myself, Miss Thompson,\" answered Anne quietly.    \"But she accuses you of rather terrible things, Miss Pierson,\" went on  the principal, picking up a slip of paper and reading aloud,  \"'inattention, insubordination, impertinence and a tendency to make  trouble.' Have you any answer to make to these charges?\"    \"No,\" replied Anne.    \"Have you nothing to say?\"    \"Only that they are untrue.\"    \"Miss Pierson,\" continued the principal, opening a closet door, \"do you  recognize this figure.\"    [Illustration: \"Miss Pierson, Do You Recognize This Figure?\"]    There, hanging by its neck on a coat hook and still wearing its  fantastic bonnet and green veil, was the famous effigy.    Anne looked at the absurd thing for a moment in silence. Then her eyes  met Miss Thompson's, and both teacher and pupil burst out laughing.    The young girl never knew how far that laugh went to soften her present  predicament. As a matter of fact, Miss Thompson had never liked the  teacher in mathematics, while the small, shabby pupil appealed strongly  to her sympathy.    \"Were you not the originator of this outrageous plot, Miss Pierson?\"    Anne was silent. She could hardly say she was the originator and still  she had participated.    \"I will put the question in another form,\" said the principal. \"If you  were not the originator, who was?\"    Still Anne made no reply.    \"Miss Leece,\" continued the principal, \"alleges that she distinctly saw "]]]
