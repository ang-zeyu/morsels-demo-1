[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2082"],[0,"Memoirs of the Comtesse Du Barry (#10)"],[1," duc de Fronsac was justly hated by his father; he was what is called  a decided scamp, without one redeeming point or virtue. Dissipated  without agreeableness, a courtier without address, a soldier without  courage, he thoroughly deserved his bad reputation. He was not hated,  because hatred implies a species of honor, but he was universally  despised. His father hated him; he hated his father. The reciprocity was  edifying. I have often seen the duc de Fronsac, and always with disgust.  He had incurred the extremity of punishment; when trying to carry off a  butcher's daughter, he rendered himself guilty of the triple crimes of  arson, rape, and robbery. This was the most splendid deed of his life,  at least his father said so, the only one in which he had shown--guess  what for, my friend, I will not pen the cynical word made use of by his  father. It must be confessed that we sometimes kept very bad company at  Versailles. The king, who abhorred degrading actions, did not like  the duc de Fronsac, but was full of kindly feeling towards the duc  d'Aiguillon. The latter experienced the extent of his favor in his  long and obstinate struggle with the parliament of Bretagne. It must be  owned, that if he gained the victory at court, he decidedly lost it in  the city, and I was publicly insulted on this account in the most brutal  manner. However, the friendship which his first interview inspired me  with, I have always preserved unaltered.    The week glided away, and each day my fortune seemed more fully assured.  The love of the king increased, he heaped presents on me perpetually,  and seemed to think he never could do enough for me. The bounties of  Louis XV were known, and instantly aroused against me the two enemies  with whom I had been threatened--the duc de Choiseul and the duchesse de  Grammont, his sister. I must say, however, that, at first, the brother  contented himself with despising me, but the duchesse was furious; I had  offended her feminine self-love, and she could not forgive me. I have  told you that she obtained possession of the king by stratagem. This is  fact. She was in a place of concealment during a regal debauch, and when  Louis left the table, with his head heated by wine, she awaited him in  his bed to commit a sort of violence on him. What curious ambition! As  soon as this noble lady learned my position, she was desirous of knowing  who I was, and I have been told since all the measures she took to learn  this. She did not confine her search to the circle of Versailles, but  hastened to prosecute her inquiries in Paris with M. de Sartines. The  lieutenant of police not suspecting the favor that awaited me, as well  as that which I already enjoyed, and on the other hand persuaded of that  of the Choiseul family, set all his bloodhounds on my traces. They did  not fail to bring him back a thousand horrible tales about me, with  which he gratified the duchesse, who, thinking thereby to do me a severe  injury, spread in the chateau a multitude of prejudicial tales against  me, hoping that they would reach the ears of the king and disgust him  with his amour. It was at this juncture that appeared in the \"_Nouvelles  a la Main_\" those infamous articles, collected in what they call the  Collection of Bachaumont. From the same source proceeded the songs _a la  Bourbonnaise_ which filled Paris, and were sung about everywhere. These  scandals produced no other effect than increasing the attachment which  the king had for me, and to diminish that which he felt for the duc de  Choiseul.    Passion never reasons; if it had common sense, it would perceive that it  cannot disgust a lover by vilifying his mistress, but, on the contrary,  interests his self-love in supporting her. Thus all these intrigues  scathed me not; I did not mention to my counsellor comte Jean an insult  which I met with in the park at Versailles from madame de Grammont. I  did not tell it to the king, not wishing to create any disturbance  at court. I avenged myself by myself, and think I conducted myself  remarkably well in this adventure, which was as follows:    I was walking in the garden with Henriette, who had given me her arm;  it was early in the morning, and the walks appeared solitary. We walked  towards towards the side of the Ile d'Amour, when we heard the steps of  two persons who came behind us. Henriette turned her head and then said  to me, \"Here are mesdames de Brionne and de Grammont.\" I knew the latter  but very slightly, and the former not at all. Certainly she could not  have been there by chance; they knew I should be there, and wished to  see me closely. Not suspecting what was to follow, I was delighted at  the rencontre. They passed us with head erect, haughty air; looked at  me with a disdainful stare, laughed rudely and walked away. Altho' such  behavior offended me, it did not put me out of humor; I thought it very  natural for madame de Grammont to be irritated against me. Henriette had  less magnanimity. She repeated so often how impertinent it was thus to  insult a female honored by the bounties of the king, and so far excited  my feelings, that instead of returning as prudence suggested, I followed  the steps of these ladies. I did not proceed far before I rejoined  them; they were seated on a bench, awaiting my arrival as it appeared.  I passed close to them, and at that moment the duchesse de Grammont,  raising her voice, said,    \"It must be a profitable business to sleep with every body.\"    I was excessively nettled, and instantly retorted, \"At least I cannot  be accused of making a forcible entry into any person's bed.\" The arrow  went to the mark and penetrated deeply. The whole countenance of the  duchesse turned pale, except her lips, which became blue. She would have  said something foolish, but madame de Brionne, more cool because touched  less nearly, placed her hand over her companion's mouth. I in my turn  walked away with Henriette, laughing till tears came into my eyes at  this pleasing victory.    The duchesse de Grammont, who had no further inclination to laugh, told  the whole to her brother. He, who loved her excessively, too much so  perhaps, reprimanded her, nevertheless, and pointed out to her the  disadvantage in an open struggle with me. Madame de Brionne was enjoined  to secrecy, but that did not prevent her from confiding the affair to  the dowager duchesse d'Aiguillon.    This latter was a lady of most superior merit, uniting to much wit more  solid acquirements. She spoke English like a native. Her death, which  happened in 1772, was a great misfortune to her son, to whom she  gave the most excellent counsel. She told my adventure to her  daughter-in-law, who, excessively ambitious, saw, without any pain,  the increasing attachment of her husband for me. I must tell you, in a  parenthesis, that I always lived on the best terms with her, and that,  in my disgrace, her friendship did not weaken. I must do her this  justice. All my _faithful friends_ have not been equally faithful  towards me.    These two ladies knowing this occurrence, the duc d'Aiguillon was not  long kept in ignorance that something had happened. He came in haste to  see me, and inquired what it was. But he asked in vain, I would not tell  him. My secrecy hurt him, and on his return home he wrote to me. As  I have great pleasure in telling you all that recalls this amiable  gentleman to my mind, I will transcribe his letter, which will give you  an opportunity of judging of the turn of his mind.    \"I am very unhappy, madame. I had flattered myself with having obtained  your confidence, but the obstinate silence which you have kept with  me has cruelly informed me of my mistake. Allow the deep interest with  which you have inspired me to offer a suggestion. You know nothing of  forms, you are unacquainted with our usages: you require a friend who  shall direct and counsel you. Why should you not select a man entirely  devoted to you, and as equally so to the king, the king whose affections  you possess--and who could refuse them to you? I pause. Nothing is more  dangerous than to use a pen where we have a heart overflowing like mine.  Be more gracious towards me, I ask it of you in charity, and take no  pleasure in driving me to twofold desperation. Adieu, madame, etc.    \"Signed, the Duc D'A.\"    I read and read again this epistle: it delighted me from beginning to  end. I found in it a depth of passion which did not displease me: I  perfectly comprehended the obscurity of the latter phrase. I needed  a sort of mentor superior to comte Jean, and I preferred the duc  d'Aiguillon to any other, because he pleased me. This feeling decided  me, and I replied to him in these terms:--    \"You are wrong, monsieur, to be annoyed, and to think that I am not  disposed to grant you my confidence. It seems to me that I cannot place  myself in better hands. However, we do not know each other well enough  for me to repose in you at once: see me frequently, and then, with the  habit of being in your company, I will allow myself to glide quietly  into that state of confidence which you desire. Yes, I am indeed a  stranger to all that passes around me; my only support is the protection  with which the king honors me. That is all-powerful, but I will not  employ it unseasonably or improperly. I know that I need the counsels  of an honorable, prudent, and well-informed man. I accept, therefore, of  yours; I even ask them from you, if your friendship go along with them.  Adieu, monsieur. My regards are due to your uncle, the marechal, the  first time you write to him.\"    This letter filled the duc d'Aiguillon with joy. Some days afterwards,  the prince de Soubise, who also wished to give me his advice, did not  attain the same success. It must be owned, that, for a man of the world,  he went about it in a very clumsy way. He committed the extreme error of  selecting mademoiselle Guimard as mediatrix between "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20839"],[0,"The Mountain Chant, A Navajo Ceremony (#10)"],[1,"entered the medicine lodge and  said: \"I will send my grandson as an akÃ¡ninili.\" This old woman's lodge  was not far from where the medicine lodge was built and all present knew  her grandson well. Whenever they visited her lodge he was always lying  on the ground asleep; they never saw him go abroad to hunt, and they all  supposed him to be lazy and worthless; so when she made her offer they  only looked at one another and laughed. She waited awhile, and getting  no response she again offered the services of her grandson, only to  provoke again laughter and significant looks. A third and a fourth time  she made her proposal, and then she said: \"Why do you not at least  answer me? I have said that I will let my grandson take your messages to  one of these camps and you laugh at me and thank me not. Why is this?\"  Hearing her words, the chief medicine man, who came from a distant camp  and did not know her, asked the men who were present who the woman was  and what sort of a young man her grandson was; but again the men laughed  and did not answer him either. He turned to the old woman and said:  \"Bring hither your grandson, that I may see him.\" The woman answered:  \"It is already late; the night is falling and the way is long. It is of  no use for you to see him to-night; let us wait until the morning.\"  \"Very well,\" said the shaman; \"bring him at dawn to-morrow.\" She left  the lodge promising to do as she was bidden; and the moment she was gone  the long suppressed merriment of the men broke forth. They all laughed  inordinately, made many jokes about the lazy grandson, and told the  medicine man that there was no use in sending such a person with the  message when the best runners among them did not dare to undertake the  journey. \"He is too weak and lazy to hunt,\" said they; \"he lives on  seeds and never tastes flesh.\"    63. As soon as there was light enough in the morning to discern objects,  a man who was looking out of the door of the medicine lodge cried out,  \"He comes,\" and those inside laughed and waited. Presently TlÃ Â¢esÃ§Ã¬ni  (such was the name of the old woman's grandson) entered and sat down  near the fire. All looked at him in astonishment. When last they saw him  his hair was short and matted, as if it had not been combed or washed  for three years, and his form was lean and bent. Now he appeared with  thick glossy locks that fell below his knee; his limbs were large and  firm looking; he held his head erect and walked like a youth of courage;  and many said to one another, \"This cannot be the same man.\" In a little  while another young man named IndsiskÃ Ã¯ (Radiating White Streaks), as  fair and robust as the first, entered and sat down by the fire on the  side opposite to where TlÃ Â¢esÃ§Ã¬ni sat. The white earth and the charcoal  for painting the akÃ¡ninili were already prepared; so some of the young  men in the lodge, when they beheld this pair of fine couriers, arose  without a word of debate and began to paint the latter and to adorn  their persons for the journey. When the toilet was done, the medicine  man sent the couriers forth with many messages and injunctions and told  them to blow on their whistles four times before they got out of hearing  of the lodge. TlÃ Â¢esÃ§Ã¬ni went to the north and IndsiskÃ Ã¯ to the south,  and they walked so slowly that all the spectators again laughed and made  merry, and many said: \"They will never reach the camps whither we have  sent them.\" They passed out of sight just before the sun rose. Those who  remained in camp prepared to amuse themselves. They cleared the ground  for the game of nÃ¡[n]joj, and brought out their sticks and hoops. Some  said: \"We will have plenty of time for play before the couriers return.\"  Others said: \"At yonder tree we saw TlÃ Â¢esÃ§Ã¬ni last. I suppose if we  went there now we would find him asleep under it.\"    64. About the middle of the afternoon, while they were playing their  games, one looked to the north, and, at a distance, he saw one of the  messengers approaching them, and he cried out, \"Here comes TlÃ Â¢esÃ§Ã¬ni;  he has wakened from his sleep and is coming back for something to eat.\"  A moment later IndsiskÃ Ã¯ was announced as approaching from the south.  They both reached the door of the medicine lodge at the same time; but  TlÃ Â¢esÃ§Ã¬ni entered first, handed his bag to the medicine man, and sat  down in the same place where he sat when he entered in the morning.  IndsiskÃ Ã¯ followed and, handing his bag to the shaman, sat down opposite  his companion. Now, many who were without thronged into the lodge to  enjoy the sport, and they laughed and whispered among themselves; but  the couriers were grave and silent, and, while the medicine man opened  the bags, they took off their ornaments and washed the paint from their  bodies. In the bag of TlÃ Â¢esÃ§Ã¬ni were found four ears of lÃ©jyip[)e]j  (corn baked in the husk underground). They were still hot from the fire,  and the shaman broke them into fragments and passed the pieces around.  From the bag of IndsiskÃ Ã¯ two pieces of noÃ§Ã¡` (the hard sugar of the  maguey), such as the Apache make, were taken. When the young men had  finished cleaning themselves, they passed out in silence, without a  glance for any one.    65. At nightfall they returned to the lodge, and entering, sat down in  the west, one on each side of the medicine man, and TlÃ Â¢esÃ§Ã¬ni addressed  him, saying: \"When we came to the lodge this afternoon, we did not give  you an account of our journeys because the people who are with you are  fools, who laughed when we came home from the long journey which they  feared to undertake; but now we have come to tell you our  adventures. I,\" continued TlÃ Â¢esÃ§Ã¬ni, \"went to the north. On my way I  met another messenger who was traveling from a distant camp to this one  to call you all to a dance in a circle of branches of a different kind  from ours. When he learned my errand he tried to prevail on me to return  hither and put off our dance till another day, so that we might attend  their ceremony and that they in turn might attend ours; but I refused,  saying our people were in haste to complete their dance. Then we  exchanged bows and quivers as a sign to our people that we had met and  that what we would tell on our return was the truth. You observe that  the bow and quiver I have now are not those with which I left this  morning. We parted, and I kept on my way towards the north. It was yet  early in the day when I reached ÃÃ²gojilÃ¡`, where the Jicarilla and  friendly Ute were encamped. There I sprinkled meal on the medicine man  and gave him my message. When I arrived they were just opening a pit in  which they had roasted corn, and they gave me the ears which I have  brought home. They promised to be here in our camp at the end of the  third day, which will be the night of our dance.\"    66. When TlÃ Â¢esÃ§Ã¬ni had done speaking, IndsiskÃ Ã¯ gave the following  account of himself: \"It was but a little while after sunrise when I  reached Tse`lakÃ Ã¯-silÃ  and entered the camps of the four tribes. In one  they were just taking some noÃ§Ã¡` out of a pit, and they gave me those  pieces which I brought home. I entered the lodge of a medicine man in  each tribe, scattered on him the sacred meal, and announced to him when  our dance would take place. They all promised to be here with their  people on the end of the third day, which will be on the night we hold  our ceremony.\"    67. When the akÃ¡ninilis came to tell their adventures to the medicine  man, they were beautifully attired. They wore earrings and necklaces of  turquoise, coral, and rare shells. They had on embroidered blankets of a  kind we see no longer, but the gods wore them in the ancient days. They  rustled like dry leaves. The blanket of one was black and that of the  other was white. When they came out of the medicine lodge they went  around among the huts and inclosures of those who were assembled,  visiting the wives and the sweethearts of the silly men who had laughed  at them in the morning; and everywhere the women smiled on the beautiful  and well dressed youths. The next morning the men laughed and sneered at  them no more, nor whispered in their presence, but glanced at them with  sulky or shamefaced looks. During the day the akÃ¡ninilis took part in  the game of nÃ¡[n]joj with those who once jeered at them, and won many  articles of great value.    68. On the afternoon of the third day following the one on which the  akÃ¡ninilis made their journeys, a great cloud of dust was observed on  the northern horizon and a similar cloud was seen in the south. They  grew greater and came nearer, and then the invited Indians began to  arrive from both directions. They continued to come in groups until  nightfall, when a great multitude had assembled to witness the dance.  After the guests began to arrive the young men set to work to cut trees  for the corral, and when the sun had set the building of the dark circle  of branches began. While the young men were making the circle the old  men were making speeches to the multitude, for the old men always love  to talk when the young men are hard at work. It was the greatest corral  that has ever been built in the Navajo country. It was as broad as from  CaÃ±on Bonito to \"the Haystacks\" (a distance of about six miles), yet the  visiting tribes were so numerous that they filled the circle full. In  the mean time the sounds of singing and of the drum were heard all  around, for many different parties of dancers, who were to take part in  the night's entertainment, were rehearsing.    69. There was some delay after the inclosure was finished before the  first dancers made their appearance. A man entered the corral and made a  speech begging the atsÃ¡leÃ¯, or first dancers, to hasten, as there were  so many parties from a distance who wished to perform during the night.  Soon after he had spoken, the two atsÃ¡leÃ¯ who led"]]]
