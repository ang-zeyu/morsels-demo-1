[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21654"],[0,"In and Around Berlin (#10)"],[1,"alone the history of art is represented on the inner  walls of this venerable and unique edifice, but the municipal history,  and the history of the \"Mark of Brandenburg,\" and the Kingdom of  Prussia as well.    Almost as ancient as the Nicolai Kirche is the Heiliggeist Kirche,  behind the Boerse. Near this is the Marien Kirche, with its high spire,  its Abbot's Cross--the emblem of Old Berlin--before the entrance, and  on the inner walls its frescos of the Dance of Death, painted to  commemorate the plague which ravaged Berlin in 1460. Adjoining this  church, in the Neue Markt, Berlin's statue of Luther is to be erected.  Of the same old time, and in the same old heart of Berlin, is the fine  Kloster Kirche of the Franciscan monks, who had once a monastery  adjoining. A morning's stroll or two enables one to inspect all these  interesting old churches,--passing first to the Nicolai Kirche from  the end of the tramway in the Fisch Markt, and then, by a convenient  circuit, to each of the others, returning by the Museums and the  Lustgarten. The Jerusalems Kirche, about three quarters of a mile  south, is said to have been founded by a citizen at the end of the  Crusades as a memento of his journey to Palestine; but its present  ornamented architecture belongs to a modern reconstruction. An  effective architectural group is formed by the two churches in the  Schiller Platz, with the great _Schauspielhaus_, or Royal Theatre,  between them,--a view which soon becomes familiar to one passing often  through the central part of the city. The French Church, on the north  side of the Theatre, we did not enter, and of the \"New Church\"--a  hundred years old and recently rejuvenated--our most abiding memories  are of an exquisite sacred concert given there in aid of a local  charity. We made a pilgrimage to see the effect of this group by  moonlight, but, perhaps because it had been too highly praised, we  found the view rather disappointing. But we shall long remember a  walk at evening twilight through this place, when early dusk and  gleaming gas-jets around and within the square had taken the place of  departing sunlight, which still bathed in radiance the gilded figures  surmounting the domes in the clear upper air. Few of the hurrying  multitudes stopped to look upward, but those who did could hardly fail  to gain an impressive lesson from the inspiring and suggestive sight.    Frommel, the good man and attractive preacher who usually officiates  in the Garrison Church, is one of the four Court-preachers, each of  whom is eminent in his way. We sat one morning, with many others, on  the steps to the chancel in the Garrison Church, as the house was  crowded in every part. The spacious galleries were filled with  soldiers in Prussian uniform, and many also were in the pews below.  The soldiers were not there merely in obedience to orders. They  listened intently, for Court-preacher Frommel has a message to the  minds and hearts of men. His oratory is eloquent, scintillating; from  first to last it holds captive the crowded audience. Never have I  witnessed gestures which were so essentially a part of the speaker;  hands so incessantly assisting to convey subtle thought and feeling  from the brain and heart of the orator to the magnetized audience,  whose faces unconsciously testified to a mental and spiritual  uplifting. It was told me that the aged Emperor never travelled from  his capital without the attendance of this chaplain, as well known for  his simple Christian integrity and his ceaseless good deeds as for his  wonderful eloquence.    Trinity Church, where for a quarter of a century Schleiermacher  preached and wrought, is now ministered to by the worthy Dryander and  his colleagues, who faithfully do what they can for the spiritual  welfare of the immense parish. The edifice, of a peculiar model,  stands in a central portion of Berlin, almost under the shadow of the  lofty and famous hotel known as the Kaiserhof. On the Sunday mornings  when Dryander preaches here, aisles, vestibules, and stairways are  crowded until there is no standing-room, much less a seat, within  sight or hearing of the popular preacher. His manner is simple, but  very forceful and sympathetic, his earnest face and voice holding the  audience like a spell.    The finest religious music in Berlin is rendered on Friday evenings at  sunset, in the great Jewish synagogue in the Oranienburger Strasse,  built at a cost of six million marks, and said to be the best in  Europe. The spacious interior seats nearly five thousand, with pews on  the main floor for men only, and galleries for the women. Three  thousand burning gas-jets above and behind the rich stained glass of  the dome and side windows give an effect remarkable both for beauty  and weirdness. The building without loses much by its close  surroundings of ordinary houses, but the Moorish arches and  decorations within are unique and effective. Over the sacred  enclosure, where a red light always burns, and which contains the ark  \"of the law and the testimony,\" a gallery across the eastern end holds  the fine organ, and accommodates the choir of eighty trained singers.  Christmas eve happened in 1886 on a Friday; so, before the later  German Christian home festival to which we were invited, we wended our  way to the Jewish weekly sunset service. Neither among the men nor the  women was there much outward evidence of devotion. In the female  countenances around me in the gallery the well-known Jewish  physiognomy was almost universal. While the rabbi read the service,  with his back to the audience, most followed in their Hebrew books;  but one by one many men slipped out, as though they were \"on 'Change\"  and did not care to stay any longer to-day. The women remained, but  with a slightly perfunctory air in most cases. One old crone before me  seemed touched with the true pathos which belongs to her race and its  history. She followed the service intently, swaying her body back and  forth in time with the beautiful music, and ever and anon breaking  forth in a low, sweet, plaintive strain with her own voice. Oh the  longing of such lives, waiting to find through the centuries the  realization of a hope never fulfilled and growing ever more and more  dim! My Puritanism had been scarcely reconciled to the crucifix and  the candles of the Protestant churches in Berlin, but now, if my life  and hopes had depended on the religion of this Jewish ceremonial, I  would have given worlds to find a crucifix in the vacant space above  their Sacred Ark. These sweet strains of exquisite music seem to give  voice without articulation to the unrevealed, imprisoned longing of  the Jewish heart for something better than it knows. I could only  compare the feeling, in this cold, mechanical worship of the  Fatherhood of God, as it seemed to me, with the vague disappointment  of climbing stairs in the dark, and stretching out foot and hand for  another which is not there. The Christmas torches were burning in the  Schloss-platz and the market-places without, crowded for days and  nights past with a busy multitude, making ready for the  Christ-festival which was to light a Christmas-tree that night in  every home in Germany. Even Jews could not resist the gladness; and  their homes, like the rest, had every one its Christmas-tree and its  fill of cheer, paying their tribute to the world-wide joy, even though  they would not. But as I sat among them and went forth with them, I  thought also of their ancestral line stretching back to Abraham  through centuries of the most wonderful history which belongs to any  race. Beside these Israelites, how puerile the fame and deeds of the  Hohenzollerns! The sixty or seventy thousand Jews of Berlin hold in  their hands, it is said, a large part of the wealth of the city; but  they are proscribed, and it is thought by many, unjustly treated  before the law.    The one English church in Berlin rejoices in a new and beautiful  though chaste and modest edifice in the gardens of Monbijou Palace.  The site, presented by the Emperor William I., is in the heart of the  city, surrounded, in this quiet and beautiful place, by many  interesting historic associations. The edifice was built chiefly  through the efforts of the Crown Princess Victoria, who raised in  London in a few hours a large part of the necessary funds, and who  also devoted to this object, so dear to her English heart, presents  received at her silver wedding. The service attracts on Sunday  mornings, of course, all adherents of the Church of England, as well  as many Americans, to whom the magnet of an Episcopal service is  greater than that of the association of Christians of all  denominations in the devout and simple worship of the Chapel in Junker  Strasse, where the Union American and British service is held. One of  the first places we essayed to find in Berlin was the chapel at  present used by this organization. Our German landlady had unwittingly  misdirected us, and we insisted on her direction, to the bewilderment  of our cabman. Up one strange street and down another he drove, with  sundry protests and shakes of the head on our part. We insist on  \"Heulmann Strasse.\" He stops and inquires. \"Nein! nein!\" he says,  \"Junker Strasse.\" \"No! no!\" we reply. He holds a conference with two  brother drosky-men. Three Germans \"of the male persuasion\" outside  insist on \"Junker Strasse.\" Three Americans \"of the female persuasion\"  inside insist on \"Heulmann Strasse.\" \"Nein!\" says the man, with a  determined air, and takes the reins now as though he means business.  We lean back in our seats, resigned to going wrong because we cannot  help ourselves, when lo! we draw up at the door of the building used  by the American church in Junker Strasse. Those barbarous men were  right, after all! Late; but how our hearts were warmed and cheered by  the sight of a plain audience-room, holding about two hundred  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21656"],[0,"The Princess of the School (#10)"],[1,"by the nuns at a  convent; her work-box was of inlaid wood from Sorrento; the trinkets on  her dressing-table were Italian; her clothes and shoes bore the names of  Paris shops. Some of the books she had brought with her were in French;  the calendar that hung on her wall held pictures of Naples and Vesuvius.    Carmel was undoubtedly a most unusual combination of two nationalities.  Though in some respects she was English enough, there was a certain  little gracious dignity and finish about her manners that was peculiarly  southern. Clifford, with a child's true instinct, had named her  \"Princess.\" She was indeed \"royal\" with that best type of good breeding  which gives equal courtesy to all, be it queen or beggar. In the school  she was soon an immense favorite. The girls admired her attitude towards  Lilias and Dulcie. If she had posed as the heiress of the Chase, they  would probably have \"sat upon her\" thoroughly, but, as she never put  forward her claims in that respect, they were disposed to show her  decided consideration, all the more so as she was visibly fretting for  her Sicilian home. She put a brave face on things in the day-time, but  at night she would be caught crying, and her eagerness for letters was  pathetic.    \"Poor child! She's like an exotic plant transferred to a northern soil!\"  said Miss Walters. \"We must try to settle her somehow. It won't do for  her to go about with dark rings round her eyes. I wonder how we could  possibly interest her? I don't believe our school happenings appeal to  her in the least.\"    Certainly the new-comer went through the ordinary routine of classes,  walks, and games without any display of enthusiasm. Gowan Barbour tried  to coach her at cricket, but the result was not successful.    \"It's a boy's game, and the ball is so hard, it hurts my hands!\"  objected Carmel.    \"Didn't you play cricket at home?\"    \"Never!\"    \"Or tennis?\"    \"On a cinder court. The sun scorched up our grass court.\"    \"What used you to do then, to amuse yourself?\"    \"We made paper dresses for the carnival, and sometimes we acted. We used  to have plays on the veranda, or in the garden. And we went on picnics  to the hills. It was beautiful there in spring, when the anemones were  out in the fields.\"    \"We're to have a picnic next Saturday,\" announced Gowan; \"I heard Miss  Walters telling Miss Herbert so.\"    It was perhaps with special reference to Carmel that Miss Walters had  arranged an outing for the school. It was bluebell time, and the woods  in the neighborhood would be a show. By permission of the owner, Sir  Ranald Joynson, they were to have access to large private grounds, and  to be allowed to ramble in his famous rhododendron gardens. None of the  girls had ever been there before, so it was a treat for all. Motor  wagonettes were to convey them all the six miles; they were to start  after an early lunch, and to take tea baskets with them. Even Carmel  cheered up at the pleasant prospect.    \"You have a treat before you!\" Dulcie assured her. \"You may talk about  your Sicilian flowers, but just wait till you have seen an English wood  full of bluebells! There's nothing to beat it in the whole world. I've  often heard of Sir Ranald Joynson's grounds. We're in luck to get leave  to go in them, because I believe he's generally rather stingy about  allowing people there. I wonder how Miss Walters managed it.\"    \"She's a clever woman,\" said Gowan. \"She always seems to manage to get  what she wants. Some people do!\"    \"I wish _I_ did!\" wailed Bertha. \"I've wanted a principal part in the  French plays ever since I came to school, and Mademoiselle never will  give me one; I always have to be a servant, or an extra guest, and speak  about two lines!\"    \"Well, your French accent is so atrociously bad, I don't wonder!\"  returned Gowan. \"You certainly wouldn't be a credit to Mademoiselle in a  principal part. And you're very stiff and wooden in acting, too!\"    \"Thank you for your compliments!\" sniffed Bertha, much offended.    \"Oh, don't be sarkie! I must tell the truth. Cheer up! It's a picnic on  Saturday, not a French play!\"    \"Thank goodness it is!\" rejoiced Dulcie. \"I hate Mademoiselle's French  afternoons! I don't know which is worst; to have to learn and act yards  of dialogue, or to sit in the audience and listen while other people  show off. I like out-of-doors treats! I'm an open-air girl.\"    The occupants of the Blue bedroom decided that it was high time  something happened to stir up Carmel, who was behaving more like an  exile than an heiress. Now the first excitement of her arrival and  unpacking was over, she had relapsed into a piteous fit of homesickness.    \"I believe she's crying again!\" said Dulcie, laying an ear to the door  that communicated with the dressing-room. \"Do you think I ought to go in  to her?\"    \"It's no use!\" declared Lilias. \"I went last night and tried to comfort  her, and I'm sure I only made her cry harder. Best leave her to  herself.\"    \"Homesick people always do cry harder if you sympathize,\" proclaimed  Gowan. \"I was prefect of the junior dormitory at my other school before  I came here, and the new kids always turned on the water works at first.  I learnt how to manage them. Sympathy makes them worse. What you want is  to switch their minds off thinking about home, and make them enjoy  school life. Carmel will come round in time.\"    \"Meantime,\" said Bertha, \"she reminds me of that picture in Miss  Walters' study: 'The Hostage.' You know the one I mean, the girl who's  standing leaning over the castle wall and gazing out to sea, and  evidently thinking of her own country. I wonder if princesses who were  sent to be married to foreign princes felt homesick?\"    \"I dare say they did,\" grunted Gowan, \"but I'm sure my plan's the best  for curing the complaint. Smack them on the back and make them cheer up,  instead of letting them weep on your shoulder. I don't like a damp  atmosphere!\"    To do Carmel justice, however acute her sense of exile might be, she had  not obtruded her woes upon her schoolfellows, and had conducted her  weeping in secret. If sounds of distress filtered through the door, it  was only when matters seemed particularly hopeless. On Saturday she  came down dressed for the jaunt, and all smiles.    \"Sit her between Edith and Bertha,\" commanded Gowan, \"and tell them they  may be their silliest! Make her laugh till she's weak. I'll take a turn  at her myself later. Don't let her mope about in the woods alone. Keep  close to her, and make all the insane jokes you can. I tell you I was  homesick myself once, though you mayn't believe it. I don't often dab my  eyes now, do I?\"    \"Here are the wagonettes,\" said Dulcie. \"Why, that driver has stuck up a  flag! How nice of him! It looks so festive. Bags me go in his chariot.\"    It took a little while to arrange mistresses, girls, and tea-baskets  inside the two motors, but at last everything was packed in, and they  started off in the direction of Bradstone. Other people were out  enjoying Saturday's holiday, and cars, bicycles, and conveyances were  frequent on the road. Grinsdale Park, their destination, was approached  by great gates, outside which the wagonettes stopped and unloaded their  passengers. Miss Walters, armed with Sir Ranald Joynson's letter, called  at the lodge for permission to enter, and, her credentials being in  strict order, the party was duly admitted.    \"Won't everybody who sees us go in be just green with envy?\" rejoiced  Edith. \"Did you see how those two cyclists tried to hang on to us and  push in too? Miss Walters looked at them most witheringly. 'May I ask if  you have a private permit?' I heard her say to them. It squashed them  flat, and they beat a retreat.\"    \"I believe Sir Ranald used to let the public in at one time,\" said  Noreen, \"but people behaved so atrociously that he had to stop. Rough  boys used to tear about and break the bushes, and take the flowers, and  do a great deal of damage.\"    \"I know! I've heard about it,\" said Lilias. \"They went bird-nesting,  too, and took all the eggs. That was the absolute finish. Sir Ranald is  very keen on natural history, and he keeps these grounds as a sort of  bird sanctuary. I believe quite rare kinds build here, and he never lets  them be disturbed.\"    \"I wonder he gave us a permit to come!\"    \"Well, you see, most of the young birds are fledged by now, and,  besides, he wouldn't expect us to go about climbing trees and robbing  nests!\"    Carrying the picnic-baskets amongst them, the party started forth along  the drive, but after ten minutes' walking turned down a bypath into the  woods. They were at the edge of a beautiful lake, and on one side of  them stretched a gleaming expanse of water, edged with shimmering reeds,  and on the other grew thick groves of trees with a carpet of wild  hyacinths beneath. The sun glinted through the new green leaves on to  the springing bracken and bluebells, and made long rifts of light across  the water, birds were flitting about and twittering in the trees, and  everywhere there was that delicious scent of the woodlands, a mixture of  honey and flowers and warm moist earth and damp moss, which is the  incense nature burns at the shrine of the goddess of spring.    It was so lovely that the party straggled considerably. They could not  help putting down the picnic-baskets and leaving the path to explore and  gather flowers. There were so many delightful surprises. Phillida and  Noreen noticed a moorhen's nest built on an overhanging bough that swept  the lake, and saw four tiny downy creatures swimming away very fast to  take cover; Ursula found a specimen of the Truelove-knot, and triumphed  immensely, partly on botanical grounds and partly because she regarded  it as an omen of early matrimony, though needless to say this latter  aspect of her rejoicing was not communicated to Miss Walters, only  chuckled over in private with her intimate"]]]
