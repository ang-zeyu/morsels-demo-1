It was sufficient for Patrasche.    There was only one thing which caused Patrasche any uneasiness in his  life, and it was this. Antwerp, as all the world knows, is full at every  turn of old piles of stones, dark and ancient and majestic, standing  in crooked courts, jammed against gateways and taverns, rising by the  water's edge, with bells ringing above them in the air, and ever and  again out of their arched doors a swell of music pealing. There they  remain, the grand old sanctuaries of the past, shut in amid the squalor,  the hurry, the crowds, the unloveliness, and the commerce of the modern  world; and all day long the clouds drift and the birds circle and  the winds sigh around them, and beneath the earth at their feet there  sleeps--RUBENS.    And the greatness of the mighty master still rests upon Antwerp, and  wherever we turn in its narrow streets his glory lies therein, so that  all mean things are thereby transfigured; and as we pace slowly through  the winding ways, and by the edge of the stagnant water, and through the  noisome courts, his spirit abides with us, and the heroic beauty of his  visions is about us, and the stones that once felt his footsteps and  bore his shadow seem to arise and speak of him with living voices. For  the city which is the tomb of Rubens still lives to us through him, and  him alone.    It is so quiet there by that great white sepulchre--so quiet, save only  when the organ peals and the choir cries aloud the Salve Regina or the  Kyrie eleison. Sure no artist ever had a greater gravestone than that  pure marble sanctuary gives to him in the heart of his birthplace in the  chancel of St. Jacques.    Without Rubens, what were Antwerp? A dirty, dusky, bustling mart, which  no man would ever care to look upon save the traders who do business on  its wharves. With Rubens, to the whole world of men it is a sacred name,  a sacred soil, a Bethlehem where a god of art saw light, a Golgotha  where a god of art lies dead.    O nations! closely should you treasure your great men; for by them alone  will the future know of you. Flanders in her generations has been wise.  In his life she glorified this greatest of her sons, and in his death  she magnifies his name. But her wisdom is very rare.    Now, the trouble of Patrasche was this. Into these great, sad piles of  stones, that reared their melancholy majesty above the crowded roofs,  the child Nello would many and many a time enter, and disappear through  their dark, arched portals, while Patrasche, left without upon the  pavement, would wearily and vainly ponder on what could be the charm  which thus allured from him his inseparable and beloved companion. Once  or twice he did essay to see for himself, clattering up the steps with  his milk-cart behind him; but thereon he had been always sent back again  summarily by a tall custodian in black clothes and silver chains of  office; and fearful of bringing his little master into trouble, he  desisted, and remained couched patiently before the churches until such  time as the boy reappeared. It was not the fact of his going into them  which disturbed Patrasche; he knew that people went to church; all  the village went to the small, tumble-down, gray pile opposite the  red windmill. What troubled him was that little Nello always looked  strangely when he came out, always very flushed or very pale; and  whenever he returned home after such visitations would sit silent and  dreaming, not caring to play, but gazing out at the evening skies beyond  the line of the canal, very subdued and almost sad.    What was it? wondered Patrasche. He thought it could not be good or  natural for the little lad to be so grave, and in his dumb fashion he  tried all he could to keep Nello by him in the sunny fields or in the  busy market-place. But to the churches Nello would go; most often of all  would he go to the great cathedral; and Patrasche, left without on the  stones by the iron fragments of Quentin Matsys's gate, would stretch  himself and yawn and sigh, and even howl now and then, all in vain,  until the doors closed and the child perforce came forth again, and  winding his arms about the dog's neck would kiss him on his broad,  tawny-colored forehead, and murmur always the same words, \"If I could  only see them, Patrasche!--if I could only see them!\"    What were they? pondered Patrasche, looking up with large, wistful,  sympathetic eyes.    One day, when the custodian was out of the way and the doors left ajar,  he got in for a moment after his little friend and saw. \"They\" were two  great covered pictures on either side of the choir.    Nello was kneeling, rapt as in an ecstasy, before the altar-picture of  the Assumption, and when he noticed Patrasche, and rose and drew the dog  gently out into the air, his face was wet with tears, and he looked up  at the veiled places as he passed them, and murmured to his companion,  \"It is so terrible not to see them, Patrasche, just because one is poor  and cannot pay! He never meant that the poor should not see them when  he painted them, I am sure. He would have had us see them any day, every  day; that I am sure. And they keep them shrouded there--shrouded! in the  dark, the beautiful things! And they never feel the light, and no eyes  look on them, unless rich people come and pay. If I could only see them,  I would be content to die.\"    But he could not see them, and Patrasche could not help him, for to gain  the silver piece that the church exacts as the price for looking on the  glories of the \"Elevation of the Cross\" and the \"Descent of the Cross\"  was a thing as utterly beyond the powers of either of them as it would  have been to scale the heights of the cathedral spire. They had never so  much as a sou to spare; if they cleared enough to get a little wood for  the stove, a little broth for the pot, it was the utmost they could do.  And yet the heart of the child was set in sore and endless longing upon  beholding the greatness of the two veiled Rubens.    The whole soul of the little Ardennois thrilled and stirred with an  absorbing passion for art. Going on his ways through the old city in  the early days before the sun or the people had risen, Nello, who looked  only a little peasant boy, with a great dog drawing milk to sell from  door to door, was in a heaven of dreams whereof Rubens was the god.  Nello, cold and hungry, with stockingless feet in wooden shoes, and the  winter winds blowing among his curls and lifting his poor thin garments,  was in a rapture of meditation, wherein all that he saw was the  beautiful fair face of the Mary of the Assumption, with the waves of her  golden hair lying upon her shoulders, and the light of an eternal sun  shining down upon her brow. Nello, reared in poverty, and buffeted  by fortune, and untaught in letters, and unheeded by men, had the  compensation or the curse which is called genius. No one knew it; he as  little as any. No one knew it. Only, indeed, Patrasche, who, being with  him always, saw him draw with chalk upon the stones any and every thing  that grew or breathed, heard him on his little bed of hay murmur all  manner of timid, pathetic prayers to the spirit of the great master;  watched his gaze darken and his face radiate at the evening glow of  sunset or the rosy rising of the dawn; and felt many and many a time the  tears of a strange, nameless pain and joy, mingled together, fall hotly  from the bright young eyes upon his own wrinkled yellow forehead.    \"I should go to my grave quite content if I thought, Nello, that when  thou growest a man thou couldst own this hut and the little plot of  ground, and labor for thyself, and be called Baas by thy neighbours,\"  said the old man Jehan many an hour from his bed. For to own a bit of  soil, and to be called Baas (master) by the hamlet round, is to have  achieved the highest ideal of a Flemish peasant; and the old soldier,  who had wandered over all the earth in his youth, and had brought  nothing back, deemed in his old age that to live and die on one spot in  contented humility was the fairest fate he could desire for his darling.  But Nello said nothing.    The same leaven was working in him that in other times begat Rubens and  Jordaens and the Van Eycks, and all their wondrous tribe, and in times  more recent begat in the green country of the Ardennes, where the Meuse  washes the old walls of Dijon, the great artist of the Patroclus, whose  genius is too near us for us aright to measure its divinity.    Nello dreamed of other things in the future than of tilling the little  rood of earth, and living under the wattle roof, and being called Baas  by neighbours a little poorer or a little less poor than himself. The  cathedral spire, where it rose beyond the fields in the ruddy evening  skies or in the dim, gray, misty mornings, said other things to him than  this. But these he told only to Patrasche, whispering, childlike, his  fancies in the dog's ear when they went together at their work through  the fogs of the daybreak, or lay together at their rest among the  rustling rushes by the water's side.    For such dreams are not easily shaped into speech to awake the slow  sympathies of human auditors; and they would only have sorely perplexed  and troubled the poor old man bedridden in his corner, who, for his  part, whenever he had trodden the streets of Antwerp, had thought the  daub of blue and red that they called a Madonna, on the walls of the  wine-shop where he drank his sou's worth of black beer, quite as good as  any of the famous altarpieces for which the stranger folk traveled far  and wide into Flanders from every land on which the good sun shone."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20729"],[0,"At the Point of the Bayonet: A Tale of the Mahratta War (#10)"],[1,"as civil  and, if war breaks out, may hold a position vastly better than you  could hope to attain to as the mere chief of a troop.\"    \"It seems very ridiculous, Sufder, that I should be thus put  forward, without any merit of my own; while you, who have fought in  many battles, are still only commander of your troop.\"    \"I have no desire for more,\" Sufder replied. \"I am a soldier, and  can do my duty as ordered, but I have no head for intrigues; and I  consider the risks of a battle are quite sufficient, without those  of being put out of the way for mixing myself up in plots.    \"Again, your rise is not altogether undeserved. You have, by your  exercises, attained the strength of manhood early; and your  experience as a tiger hunter has fitted you for the post for which  you are appointed, just as your diligence in exercise in arms will  be of good service to you, if you come to hold military command.  But you must be circumspect and, above all things, do not forget to  use the dye with which Soyera has furnished you. Hitherto your  white skin has done you no harm but, were it discovered here that  you are English, it would at once be imagined that you were a spy,  and little time would be given you to explain how matters stand.\"    \"I will certainly be careful as to that and, now that I am to have  a private apartment, I shall be able to apply the dye without the  fear of being interrupted, as might have been the case in camp.\"    On the following day, Harry, having obtained clothes suitable to  his position, betook himself to the palace, where one of the  officers of the chamberlain conducted him to his apartment, and  assigned to him two men appointed to his service.        Chapter 3: A Change In Affairs.      Harry Lindsay's duties were little more than nominal. The reports  sent in to him, by those in charge of the royal preserves, could  scarcely be considered as satisfactory; as they stated that, owing  to the fact that for years there had been no hunting there, the  tigers had greatly increased in number, and had thinned down the  stags and, indeed, in some cases had so destroyed other game that  they were driven to escape from the enclosures, and to ravage the  villages. But beyond receiving these reports, and riding over  occasionally to the preserves, Harry had little to do save to take  part in any court ceremonies and, when called upon to do so, to  accompany the Peishwa in his walks in the palace garden. He  therefore determined to learn to read and write in Mahratta and,  for two or three hours a day, a man of the weynsh, or mercantile  class, came in to teach him. So careful was Nana Furnuwees, in  preventing Scindia's adherents from approaching the prince, that  Harry had nothing whatever to report on this head.    One day, when Mahdoo Rao, who had taken a great liking to him, was  walking in the garden, chatting familiarly to him of his life in  the country, and his adventures with tigers and other wild beasts,  he said:    \"Have you seen my cousin, Bajee Rao?\"    \"No, Your Highness, I have never seen him.\"    \"You have heard of him, of course, and nothing but good.\"    \"That is so, Prince. It seems that, both in sports and learning, he  is wonderfully well instructed.\"    \"I should like to see him,\" the prince said. \"I admire what I have  heard of him, greatly, and it is hard that he should be shut up in  prison; and yet he is scarcely more a prisoner than I am.\"    Harry was struck with dismay.    \"But Your Highness is in no way a prisoner!\"    \"I am not shut up in a fortress,\" the young prince said, \"but I am  no more my own master than Bajee Rao is. Nana Furnuwees treats me  as if I were a child. He is, I know, devoted to me; but that makes  it no more pleasant. I can go where I like, but it is always with  my retinue. I cannot choose my own friends.\"    \"Your Highness will forgive me, if I say that it is for your own  safety, and for the peace of the country that your minister watches  over you so jealously; and doubtless he thinks that, having been  the chief adviser to your family, for so many years, having guarded  it so successfully from those who would have lessened your  authority, for the present it is of the greatest importance that he  should continue to guide the state.\"    \"I am, at least, very glad that he allows me a companion of my own  age, to whom I can talk freely.\"    \"On all subjects, Your Highness, excepting state matters. Nana  presented me because I was ignorant of the court, and knew nothing  whatever of intrigues, and was not likely to take any part in them.  Therefore, Your Highness, I pray you but to speak upon ordinary  matters; be assured I am your devoted servant, but the courtiers  would grow suspicious, were you to talk of state matters with me.  These things speedily become known, and I should fall under Nana's  displeasure.\"    \"Perhaps you are right,\" the Peishwa admitted, in a tone of  melancholy. \"No doubt, whatever passes in this house is known to my  minister; and indeed, it is his duty to make himself so acquainted.  Still, I feel it hard that I should not have one friend to whom I  can speak.\"    \"The time will come, Prince, when you will be able to do so and,  doubtless, there will be at hand those who will dare to have your  confidence.\"    The prince was silent but, after this, he abstained from any  remarks to Harry concerning the state. He had, indeed, for some  time been in correspondence with Bajee Rao, who had gained the  confidence of one of those appointed to look after him and, though  there was nothing save expressions of friendship on the part of  both princes, Nana was furious when he found out, from his spies,  what was going on.    The news came as a shock to the minister. Nana had been the  greatest enemy of the house of Rugoba; and the discovery of this  correspondence, and the friendship between the two young men, so  threatened his authority that, after ordering that Bajee Rao and  his brothers should be more strictly confined than before, he  visited the Peishwa and upbraided him bitterly for having entered  upon a friendship with the head of a party which had harassed his  family, and had brought innumerable troubles on the state. Then he  sent a message to Harry, bidding him to come, at once.    \"How is it, Puntojee,\" he said sternly, \"that you have altogether  failed to justify the faith I put in you, and have already assisted  Mahdoo Rao to enter into relations with my enemy, Bajee Rao?\"    Harry was thunderstruck at this sudden attack.    \"My lord, you must have been misinformed. I know nothing of any  such correspondence and, if it really went on, I think the Peishwa  would have taken me into his confidence.\"    \"Do you mean to say that Mahdoo has not spoken to you about his  cousin?\"    \"No, sir, I do not say so for, some four months ago, he spoke in  terms of admiration for Bajee Rao; but he did not pursue the  subject, and never afterwards alluded to it.\"    The minister looked at him fixedly.    \"I believe you,\" he said. \"You do not look like a double-faced man,  but as one who would tell the truth, whatever were the consequences.  Moreover, I felt that if you had known of Mahdoo Rao's intentions,  and had not reported them to me, you would, on receiving my message,  have endeavoured to make your escape. I have of course enquired, and  found that you spent your afternoon, as usual, with your scribe; and  that you afterwards rode out to Sufder's camp, and there talked for  half an hour, sitting outside the tent and conversing on ordinary  matters; and then you returned here to the palace. These proceedings  go far to assure me that you were ignorant of the discovery that had  been made, that a correspondence had been going on between Mahdoo and  Bajee. Still, I thought you might have known of the correspondence,  though not of the discovery; but now I am quite convinced that you  were altogether ignorant of what was going on.\"    The scene with Nana, and the knowledge that he had brought upon his  cousins even stricter confinement than before, acted most painfully  upon the mind of the young Peishwa, already embittered by the  restraint in which he was being held. He now shut himself up in his  room, and absolutely refused to leave it. His absence from the  durbars was put down to illness. Nana paid no great attention to  him, believing that the young prince would speedily recover  himself.    This, however, was not the case, for settled melancholy took  possession of him. On the 22nd of October he appeared at the  Duddera, a high ceremonial, went among his troops and, in the  evening, received his chiefs and the representatives from the great  rajahs but, three days later, he threw himself from a terrace in  front of his palace, broke two of his limbs, and so seriously  injured himself that he died, two days afterwards; having, almost  in his last breath, expressed to Nana his strong desire that Bajee  Rao should succeed him on the musnud.    The consternation of the minister was unbounded. It seemed that, by  this sudden and unexpected blow, the whole of his plans were  overthrown; and that not only his position, but his very life, was  in danger.    He sent for Harry, two hours after the Peishwa's death.    \"Answer me frankly,\" he said. \"Can I depend upon you, absolutely?  And have you had no communication of any kind from my enemies?\"    \"You can depend upon me, my lord. Everyone knows that you have  saved the state, a score of times; and will, I doubt not, do the  same again.\"    \"I have the will,\" the minister said, gravely, \"but whether I have  the power is another thing. I sent off a messenger to the general,  Purseram Bhow, bidding him gather as many troops as possible and  march hither; and I shall send letters to the Rajah of Nagpore, and  Scindia. Holkar, being in Poona, I have already seen and, as he has  always supported me against Rugoba, he is as anxious as I am as to  the succession.    \"I"]]]
