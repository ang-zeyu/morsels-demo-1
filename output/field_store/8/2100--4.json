A fire, which had been kindled for cooking, being deserted, spread in  all directions, setting the bamboos in flames and very nearly destroying  their luggage.  Two of the asses died here, and others were missing.    Several of the soldiers now fell sick, and were mounted on the horses  and spare asses.    At Toombin, which the caravan reached on the 16th of June, in the  neighbourhood of Malacotta, the good old schoolmaster, Park's former  friend, arrived just as the baggage had started, having travelled all  night to visit him.  Park invited him to go forward to the next place  where they should halt, that he might reward him for his former  kindness.    After leaving the village he found Hinton, one of the party, to whom Mr  Anderson had lent his horse, lying under a tree, and the horse grazing  at a little distance.  Park put the sick man on the horse and drove it  before him, but was at length compelled to leave him.  A mile further on  he came to two others lying in the shade of a tree, whom he placed on  his own and Mr Anderson's horses, and carried on to the next village.  Hence he sent back for poor Hinton, and left the three in charge of the  _dooty_, giving him beads to purchase provisions for them should they  live, and to bury them if they died.    On the 22nd one of the carpenters was also left behind at his own  request.  A soldier, Bloore, lost his way in the woods while looking for  an ass which had strayed, and in the search another sick man, Walter,  was found.  He had laid himself down among the bushes.  He died soon  after being taken up, and Park with his sword, and two of the soldiers  with their bayonets, dug his grave in the desert, covering it over with  a few branches.    Thus, one by one, in rapid succession, Park's companions, attacked by  fever, either sank on the road or were left behind, too probably to  perish.    On the 30th of June both Mr Anderson and Mr Scott were attacked by the  fever.    While encamped during a violent tornado, when it was necessary to put  out the watch-fires, a peculiar roaring and growling was heard.  Supposing the sound to be that of wild boars, Park and Lieutenant Martyn  went in search of them and fired several shots into the bush.  The  natives on their return told them that they were not boars, but young  lions, and that unless a very good look out was kept they would probably  kill some of the cattle during the night.  About midnight the lions  attempted to seize one of the asses, which so alarmed the rest that they  broke the ropes and came full gallop in amongst the tents.  Two of the  lions followed so close that the sentry cut one with his sword, but  dared not fire for fear of killing the asses.    Both Anderson and Scott were worse, but Park urged them to proceed.  Alston, a seaman, had become so weak that he was unable to sit his  horse, and entreated to be left in the woods till the morning.  Park  gave him a loaded pistol and some cartridges to protect himself.    The next day, the 4th of July, the river Wanda, which they reached, was  found to be greatly swollen.  There was but one canoe.  In this the  baggage was carried over, and Isaaco endeavoured to make the asses cross  by swimming and pushing them before him.  While thus employed, just as  he reached the middle of the stream, a crocodile suddenly rose and,  seizing him by the left thigh, pulled him under water.  With wonderful  presence of mind he thrust his finger into the creature's eye; on which  it quitted its hold, and Isaaco attempted to reach the further shore,  calling out for a knife.  The crocodile returned and seized him by the  other thigh, and again pulled him under water.  He had recourse to the  same expedient, and thrust his finger into its eyes with such violence  that it again quitted him and, when it rose, after flouncing about, swam  down the stream.  Isaaco reached the other side, and as soon as the  canoe returned Park went over, and, having dressed his wounds with  adhesive plaster, he was carried to the nearest village, fortunately not  far off.  Park here found himself very ill and unable to stand erect  without feeling a tendency to faint, while all the people were so sickly  that they could with difficulty carry the loads into the tents, though  rain threatened.  Greatly to their astonishment, Ashton the sailor  arrived, with his fever much abated, but quite naked, having been  stripped of his clothes by some natives during the night.    Important as it was to push on, they found it impossible to do so  without Isaaco, whose recovery seemed doubtful, though the delay would  expose them to the full violence of the rain shortly to be expected.  Isaaco, under Park's care, notwithstanding his fears, rapidly recovered;  and on the 10th of July they were able once more to travel forward,  taking a west and north-west direction.    They were now exposed to the thieving propensities of the natives, who  took every opportunity of carrying off whatever they could lay their  hands on.  Among the chief robbers were the sons of a potentate called  Mansa Mumma, whose town they reached on the 12th.  As Park was looking  out for an easy ascent over some rocky ground, two of these young  princes, approaching, snatched his musket from his hand and ran off with  it.  He instantly sprang from his saddle and followed the robber with  his sword, calling to Mr Anderson to tell some of the people to look  after his horse.  Anderson got within musket-shot of the man, but,  seeing that he was Mumma's son, had some doubt about shooting him.  The  thief made his escape, and on Park's return he found that the other  prince had stolen his great coat.  An elder brother, who had been  engaged as a guide, told him that after what had happened he would be  justified in shooting the first who attempted to steal from the loads.  The soldiers were accordingly ordered to load their muskets and be  ready.  Notwithstanding this, a short time afterwards a man made a dash  at one of the asses which had strayed a little from the rest, took off  the load, and began to cut it open with his knife.  The soldiers fired,  but did not hit him, and he made his escape, leaving the load behind  him.  Another seized a soldier's knapsack and attempted to make off with  it.  The soldier covered him with his piece, but it flashed in the pan,  and the robber escaped.  Another robber, however, who had attempted to  carry off a great coat from an ass driven by one of the sick men, was  wounded, and Mansa's son insisted that he should be killed, as otherwise  they would not fulfil the orders of the king, who had directed that  every person be shot who stole from the caravan.    In this way, day after day, they were attacked, and they had little  doubt that one of the sick men who had fallen behind had been robbed and  murdered by these people.    A deep stream being reached, it was proposed to form a raft; but the  Mandingoes insisted that it would be necessary to build a bridge to  enable them to cross.  It was most ingeniously and rapidly constructed.  The people, however, were too sickly to carry the baggage over, and  negroes were therefore hired for the purpose, as well as to swim the  asses across.    Another of the soldiers here lay down and expired, and, as the sun was  very hot, it was impossible to stop and bury him.    As he was riding on, Park found Mr Scott lying by the side of the path,  too sick to walk, and, shortly afterwards, Lieutenant Martyn lay down in  the same state.    Pushing on to the town of Mareena, Park sent back a party to bring in  his sick companions.    Hence they proceeded to Bangassi, six miles distant, the capital of the  Chief Serenummo.  While encamped outside, one of the sick men, who had  been left under the shade of a tree, was nearly being torn to pieces by  wolves, which he found, on awakening, smelling at his feet.  Ill as he  was, he started up and rushed to the camp.    Here the corporal died, and several soldiers, as well as one of the  carpenters, insisted on being left behind.  Park handed to the _dooty's_  son a quantity of amber and other articles of trade, that the poor men  might be taken care of.    Poor Park's troubles increased.  Mr Scott, who rode his horse,  continued very ill, and the soldiers were so weak that, when the loads  fell off the asses, they were unable to lift them on again.  In the  course of one day's march Park himself had to assist in re-loading  thirteen of the animals.  The caravan was also followed by wolves, who  prowled round them during the night, showing too plainly what would be  the fate of any of the sick men who dropped behind.  Provisions also  became scarce, and thieves likewise dodged their footsteps, taking every  opportunity of robbing them.    On the 10th of August, as Park, who was bringing up the rear, reached a  stream, he found many of the soldiers sitting on the ground, and Mr  Anderson was lying under a bush, apparently dying.  He took his  brother-in-law on his back, and carried him across the stream, though it  took him up to his middle.  He had then to carry other loads, and get  the animals over, having thus to cross sixteen times.  He then put Mr  Anderson on his horse and conveyed him to the next village, where,  however, a solitary fowl was the only food he could obtain.    During the last two marches four more men had been lost, and, though Mr  Scott was somewhat recovered, Mr Anderson was in a very dangerous  state.  He struggled on, however, for another day, when, after he had  passed a number of sick men, Mr Anderson declared that he could ride no  further.  Park, having turned the horses and ass to feed, sat down in  the shade to watch the pulsations of his dying friend.  In the evening,  there being a fine breeze, Mr Anderson agreed to make another attempt  to move on, in the hopes of reaching a town before dark.

Take, for instance, the  well-known change which every soprano who sings the role of Leonora  introduces in the _Miserere_ scene of _Il Trovatore_. The passage  occurs four times in succession, and as printed becomes commonplace  and monotonous.    [Music: Di te, di te scordarmi! di te, di te scordarmi!]    The accepted traditional change certainly conveys the impression of  Leonora's gradually increasing anguish and terror; not the idea that  it is introduced merely to exploit a high tone:    [Music: Di te, di te scordarmi! di te, di te scordarmi!]    That this departure from the text must have been sanctioned by Verdi,  is, I think, proved by the fact that it has always been sung thus, and  the composer himself must often have heard the substitution. He would  certainly have forbidden its use, had he not approved of it, for he  was particularly averse to having changes made in his music. The  following anecdote illustrates this trait in his character. It was  related by the late Mme. Marie Saxe, better known under her  Italianized name of Marie Sasse. This distinguished soprano singer, a  member of the Paris Opera for a number of years, was engaged to give a  certain number of performances at the Opera of Cairo. _Aida_ was one  of the operas stipulated for in her contract. She had never sung the  role, and in studying it found the _tessitura_ of the music, at one or  two points, a little too high for her natural means. As she was  compelled by her contract to sing the opera, she asked Verdi to make  some slight changes to bring the music within her reach. But he  refused absolutely to make the least alteration.    Madame Saxe was specially selected by Meyerbeer to create the role of  Selika in _l'Africaine_. She studied the part for three months with  the composer, and sang it when the work was first given at the Paris  Opera. She was also chosen by Richard Wagner for the part of Elisabeth  when _Tannhaeuser_ was given its stormy performances, with Niemann in  the title-role, at the same theatre in 1861.    Madame Saxe possessed a score of _Tannhaeuser_ with the inscription in  the composer's handwriting:        \"_A ma courageuse amie        Mademoiselle Marie Saxe._        _L'Auteur_        RICHARD WAGNER.\"    The slight modifications, or _pointages_, asked from Verdi, were not,  I was assured by Madame Saxe, of a character to alter either the role  or the opera, and she remarked (I quote her own words): \"Why should  Verdi have shown himself more unreasonable or less yielding than  Meyerbeer or Wagner?\" (_plus intransigeant, plus intraitable que_  Meyerbeer _ou_ Wagner?).           *       *       *       *       *    In tradition, however, there is the true or accepted tradition--so  called because believed to have been sanctioned by the composer  himself, or approved of by competent authorities and its use warranted  by time--and the false. This latter is simply an accumulation of  excrescences superimposed on the original by individual whim or  personal fancy. These have been invented by singers desirous of  bringing into relief certain special and peculiar gifts, or who have  mistaken, perhaps forgotten, the original and authentic tradition.  Thus their artistic heritage has become so altered and disfigured by  successive additions, or \"machicotage,\" as to bear no resemblance to  the original, this being buried under a heap of useless complications.    But it may be asked, are there no authoritatively correct printed  editions of such classics with the accepted traditions and the proper  mode of their performance expressed in modern musical notation? Yes:  but they are incomplete, being for the most part confined to airs and  other excerpts, instead of the complete works themselves. In this  connection, I may cite the admirable edition of the \"_Gloires  d'Italie_\" by the late erudite musician and authority, Gevaert, for so  many years Director of the Conservatoire at Brussels. These editions  are characterized by a scrupulous fidelity to the composers' text as  it was understood when written, as well as by great taste and musical  sense of what is appropriate and fitting, in such ornaments as the  editor has introduced, when these have been left to the discretion of  the singer. The solo parts for the principal singers in Mozart's  operas of _Don Giovanni_ and _Le Nozze di Figaro_, edited and revised  for performance by the well-known singing-master and excellent  musician, Signor Randegger, are also admirable. But other editions  exist which do not bear the same imprint of authority, or  conscientious care in their revision, as do the versions just  mentioned.    In the edition of the well-known air \"_J'ai perdu mon Eurydice_\" (_che  faro senza Euridice?_) from _Orphee_ (Gluck), revised by Madame  Pauline Viardot-Garcia, no mention is made of two traditions which  have been used and handed down by a number of the most famous singers  of the role of Orphee. I give them here:    [Music: (as printed)    dechire mon coeur. J'ai perdu mon Eurydice    (Traditional changes)    Ah! dechire mon coeur. J'ai perdu mon Eurydice]    The change on the third repetition of the principal theme is quite in  accordance with the license then accorded in such airs.    In a special version of the opera _Armide_ (Gluck), revised and edited  by the late Sir Charles Halle, the first bars of the great air of  Armide in the first scene of the fourth act, \"_Ah! si la liberte_\"  (Ah! if my liberty must from me then be taken), are printed thus:    [Music: Ah! si la liberte]    The situation is where Armide perceives the knight Renaud in the  gardens of her enchanted palace, whither he has come to destroy the  sorceress on account of her magic arts. Although the enchantress knows  that the mission of the knight is to deprive her of liberty, she  herself succumbs to the fatal passion of love. I have briefly  described the scene in order that my meaning may be clear. In the  second half of the first bar, the _acciaccatura_ was never intended by  the composer to be actually sung as printed. It was his only way of  indicating the sob or sigh whereby Armide finishes her exclamation,  \"Ah!\" The effect is called \"the Dramatic sob,\" and is known to every  opera-singer. Here is the composer's meaning, as far as it is possible  to convey it in writing:    [Music: Ah! si la liberte]    (A _portamento_ must be made from the first note to the next, when the  breath must be taken quickly to give the idea of a sob or sigh.)    Again, in a recent edition of the same air by the distinguished  composer Vincent d'Indy (_Nouvelle Edition Francaise de Musique  Classique_), occurs the following:    [Music: tu regnes dans mon coeur!]    The effect of the _F_ sharp in the last bar, if sung against the  harmony given, in which the preceding chord is resolved, would be  intolerable. Surely, the composer intended a pronounced _rallentando_  on the latter half of the bar, and a carrying of the voice by a  _portamento_ to the last note. Thus:    [Music: tu regnes dans mon coeur!]    In the edition of the immortal air in the opera of _Xerxes_,  universally known as the \"Largo of Handel,\" also revised and edited by  d'Indy, may be noticed the following:    [Music: Non v'oltraggino mai la cara pace, ne giunga a profanarvi  austro rapace!]    Of course, every operatic conductor knows that the chord in the  orchestra must be played \"after the voice,\" as the technical phrase  has it. But not every pianist or organist is familiar with this usage,  and the effect would be very disagreeable if given as written. It  should be performed thus:    [Music: Non v'oltraggino mai la cara pace, ne giunga a profanarvi  austro rapace!]    Besides, why claim that a certain edition is \"revised and edited,\"  when all the care and musical knowledge seem to have been expended on  the harmonies only? Surely, the voice-part in these classics is not  without its need of elucidation.    An edition of _The Messiah_, revised for performance, can scarcely be  called accurate when such defects as the following occur:         \"And [fermata symbol over \"they\"] they ---- [breath symbol] were       sore afraid.\"    The following is the authentic mode of performing the phrase:         \"And [fermata symbol over dash] ---- [breath symbol] [slur symbol       and \"sombre\" over the following words] they were sore afraid.\"    In the same edition for the solo singers occurs: (\"Behold and see\"):    [Music: If there be any sorrow like un_to_ His sorrow.]    But by a slight syllabic rearrangement, the disagreeable accent on the  last syllable of \"un-_to_\" is avoided, and the accent placed on the  word \"His,\" to which it belongs, while the composer's music remains  untouched.    [Music: like unto _His_ sorrow.]    Again, in the same air occurs:    [Music: (as printed)    like un_to_ His sorrow.    (should be sung)    like unto _His_ sorrow.]    While recognizing the benefits conferred by some of these specially  prepared editions, there remains still more to be accomplished in this  direction before the work is complete. A flood of light has been  thrown on the dark and nebulous places of the instrumental classics by  various distinguished and highly competent musicians. It is sincerely  to be hoped, in the interests of this branch of the aesthetics of vocal  art, that those competent to speak with authority will do so, in order  that in this direction also \"the crooked shall be made straight, and  the rough places plain.\"    I admit that this question of revising the composer's written text is  an exceedingly delicate and difficult one. It should be attempted only  by those possessed of the requisite authority, those who combine tact  and taste with judgment and experience. To these qualities should be  added a sincere and reverential desire to place in the highest relief  the meaning of"]]]
