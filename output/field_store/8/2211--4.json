Saratoga extorted it. On the one hand it removed a principal cause of  hesitation. After such a success it was unlikely that the colonists  would tamely surrender. On the other it made it necessary to take  immediate action. Lord North's attitude showed clearly that the British  Government was ready to make terms with the colonists. It was clearly in  the interests of France that those terms should be refused. She must  venture something to make sure of such a refusal. With little hesitation  the advisers of the French Crown determined to take the plunge. They  acknowledged the revolted colonies as independent States, and entered  into a defensive alliance with these States against Great Britain. That  recognition and alliance immediately determined the issue of the war.  What would have happened if it had been withheld cannot be certainly  determined. It seems not unlikely that the war would have ended as the  South African War ended, in large surrenders of the substance of  Imperial power in return for a theoretic acknowledgment of its  authority. But all this is speculative. The practical fact is that  England found herself, in the middle of a laborious, and so far on the  whole unsuccessful, effort to crush the rebellion of her colonies,  confronted by a war with France, which, through the close alliance then  existing between the two Bourbon monarchies, soon became a war with both  France and Spain. This change converted the task of subjugation from a  difficult but practicable one, given sufficient time and determination,  to one fundamentally impossible.    Yet, so far as the actual military situation was concerned, there were  no darker days for the Americans than those which intervened between the  promise of French help and its fulfilment. Lord Cornwallis had appeared  in the South and had taken possession of Charleston, the chief port of  South Carolina. In that State the inhabitants were less unanimous than  elsewhere. The \"Tories,\" as the local adherents of the English Crown  were called, had already attempted a rebellion against the rebellion,  but had been forced to yield to the Republican majority backed by the  army of Washington. The presence of Cornwallis revived their courage.  They boasted in Tarleton, able, enterprising and imperious, an excellent  commander for the direction of irregular warfare, whose name and that of  the squadron of horse which he raised and organized became to the rebels  what the names of Claverhouse and his dragoons were to the Covenanters.  Cornwallis and Tarleton between them completely reduced the Carolinas,  save for the strip of mountainous country to the north, wherein many of  those families that Tarleton had \"burnt out\" found refuge, and proceeded  to overrun Georgia. Only two successes encouraged the rebels. At the  Battle of the Cowpens Tarleton having, with the recklessness which was  the defeat of his qualities as a leader, advanced too far into the  hostile country, was met and completely defeated by Washington. The  defeat produced little immediate result, but it was the one definite  military success which the American general achieved before the advent  of the French, and it helped to keep up the spirit of the insurgents.  Perhaps even greater in its moral effect was the other victory, which  from the military point of view was even more insignificant. In Sumter  and Davie the rebels found two cavalry leaders fully as daring and  capable as Tarleton himself. They formed from among the refugees who had  sought the shelter of the Carolinian hills a troop of horse with which  they made a sudden raid upon the conquered province and broke the local  Tories at the Battle of the Hanging Rock. It was a small affair so far  as numbers went, and Davie's troopers were a handful of irregulars drawn  as best might be from the hard-riding, sharp-shooting population of the  South. Many of them were mere striplings; indeed, among them was a boy  of thirteen, an incorrigible young rebel who had run away from school to  take part in the fighting. In the course of this narration it will be  necessary to refer to that boy again more than once. His name was Andrew  Jackson.    While there was so little in the events of the Southern campaign to  bring comfort to the rebels, in the North their cause suffered a moral  blow which was felt at the moment to be almost as grave as any military  disaster. Here the principal American force was commanded by one of the  ablest soldiers the Rebellion had produced, a man who might well have  disputed the pre-eminent fame of Washington if he had not chosen rather  to challenge--and with no contemptible measures of success--that of  Iscariot. Benedict Arnold was, like Washington, a professional soldier  whose talent had been recognized before the war. He had early embraced  the revolutionary cause, and had borne a brilliant part in the campaign  which ended in the surrender of Burgoyne. There seemed before him every  prospect of a glorious career. The motives which led him to the most  inexpiable of human crimes were perhaps mixed, though all of them were  poisonous. He was in savage need of money to support the extravagance of  his private tastes: the Confederacy had none to give, while the Crown  had plenty. But it seems also that his ravenous vanity had been wounded,  first by the fact that the glory of Burgoyne's defeat had gone to Gates  and not to him, and afterwards by a censure, temperate and tactful  enough and accompanied by a liberal eulogy of his general conduct, which  Washington had felt obliged to pass on certain of his later military  proceedings. At any rate, the \"ingratitude\" of his country was the  reason he publicly alleged for his treason; and those interested in the  psychology of infamy may give it such weight as it may seem to deserve.  For history the important fact is that Arnold at this point in the  campaign secretly offered his services to the English, and the offer was  accepted.    Arnold escaped to the British camp and was safe. The unfortunate  gentleman on whom patriotic duty laid the unhappy task of trafficking  with the traitor was less fortunate. Major Andre had been imprudent  enough to pay a visit to a spot behind the American lines, and, at  Arnold's suggestion, to do so in plain clothes. He was taken, tried, and  hanged as a spy. Though espionage was not his intention, the Americans  cannot fairly be blamed for deciding that he should die. He had  undoubtedly committed an act which was the act of a spy in the eyes of  military law. It is pretty certain that a hint was given that the  authorities would gladly exchange him for Arnold, and it is very  probable that the unslaked thirst for just vengeance against Arnold was  partly responsible for the refusal of the American commanders to show  mercy. Andre's courage and dignity made a profound impression on them,  and there was a strong disposition to comply with his request that he  should at least be shot instead of hanged. But to that concession a  valid and indeed irresistible objection was urged. Whatever the  Americans did was certain to be scanned with critical and suspicious  eyes. Little could be said in the face of the facts if they treated  Andre as a spy and inflicted on him the normal fate of a spy. But if  they showed that they scrupled to hang him as a spy, it would be easy to  say that they had shot a prisoner of war.    Arnold was given a command in the South, and the rage of the population  of that region was intensified into something like torment when they saw  their lands occupied and their fields devastated no longer by a stranger  from overseas who was but fulfilling his military duty, but by a  cynical and triumphant traitor. Virginia was invaded and a bold stroke  almost resulted in the capture of the author of the Declaration of  Independence himself, who had been elected Governor of that State. In  the course of these raids many abominable things were done which it is  unnecessary to chronicle here. The regular English troops, on the whole,  behaved reasonably well, but Tarleton's native \"Tories\" were inflamed by  a fanaticism far fiercer than theirs, while atrocity was of course  normal to the warfare of the barbarous mercenaries of England, whether  Indian or German. It is equally a matter of course that such excesses  provoked frequent reprisals from the irregular colonial levies.    But aid was at last at hand. Already Lafayette, a young French noble of  liberal leanings, had appeared in Washington's camp at the head of a  band of volunteers, and the accession, small as it was, led to a  distinct revival of the fortunes of the revolution in the South. It was,  however, but a beginning. England, under pressure of the war with France  and Spain, lost that absolute supremacy at sea which has ever been and  ever will be necessary to her conduct of a successful war. A formidable  French armament was able to cross the Atlantic. A French fleet  threatened the coasts. Cornwallis, not knowing at which point the blow  would fall, was compelled to withdraw his forces from the country they  had overrun, and to concentrate them in a strong position in the  peninsula of Yorktown. Here he was threatened on both sides by  Washington and Rochambeau, while the armada of De Grasse menaced him  from the sea. The war took on the character of a siege. His resources  were speedily exhausted, and on September 19, 1781, he surrendered.    It was really the end of the war so far as America was concerned, though  the struggle between England and France continued for a time with  varying fortunes in other theatres, and the Americans, though approached  with tempting offers, wisely as well as righteously refused to make a  separate peace at the expense of their Allies. But the end could no  longer be in doubt. The surrender of Burgoyne had forced North to make "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24063"],[0,"A Handbook of Some South Indian Grasses (#10)"],[1,"is a distinct membrane, truncate, rarely  irregularly toothed.
