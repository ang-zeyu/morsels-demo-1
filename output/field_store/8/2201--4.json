[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2376"],[0,"Up from Slavery: An Autobiography (#10)"],[1,"student in school volunteered to go.    I was one of the volunteers. The winter that we spent in those tents  was an intensely cold one, and we suffered severely--how much I am sure  General Armstrong never knew, because we made no complaints. It was  enough for us to know that we were pleasing General Armstrong, and  that we were making it possible for an additional number of students to  secure an education. More than once, during a cold night, when a stiff  gale would be blowing, our tent was lifted bodily, and we would find  ourselves in the open air. The General would usually pay a visit to the  tents early in the morning, and his earnest, cheerful, encouraging voice  would dispel any feeling of despondency.    I have spoken of my admiration for General Armstrong, and yet he was but  a type of that Christlike body of men and women who went into the Negro  schools at the close of the war by the hundreds to assist in lifting  up my race. The history of the world fails to show a higher, purer, and  more unselfish class of men and women than those who found their way  into those Negro schools.    Life at Hampton was a constant revelation to me; was constantly taking  me into a new world. The matter of having meals at regular hours, of  eating on a tablecloth, using a napkin, the use of the bath-tub and of  the tooth-brush, as well as the use of sheets upon the bed, were all new  to me.    I sometimes feel that almost the most valuable lesson I got at the  Hampton Institute was in the use and value of the bath. I learned there  for the first time some of its value, not only in keeping the body  healthy, but in inspiring self-respect and promoting virtue. In all my  travels in the South and elsewhere since leaving Hampton I have always  in some way sought my daily bath. To get it sometimes when I have been  the guest of my own people in a single-roomed cabin has not always been  easy to do, except by slipping away to some stream in the woods. I have  always tried to teach my people that some provision for bathing should  be a part of every house.    For some time, while a student at Hampton, I possessed but a single pair  of socks, but when I had worn these till they became soiled, I would  wash them at night and hang them by the fire to dry, so that I might  wear them again the next morning.    The charge for my board at Hampton was ten dollars per month. I was  expected to pay a part of this in cash and to work out the remainder. To  meet this cash payment, as I have stated, I had just fifty cents when I  reached the institution. Aside from a very few dollars that my brother  John was able to send me once in a while, I had no money with which to  pay my board. I was determined from the first to make my work as janitor  so valuable that my services would be indispensable. This I succeeded in  doing to such an extent that I was soon informed that I would be allowed  the full cost of my board in return for my work. The cost of tuition was  seventy dollars a year. This, of course, was wholly beyond my ability to  provide. If I had been compelled to pay the seventy dollars for tuition,  in addition to providing for my board, I would have been compelled to  leave the Hampton school. General Armstrong, however, very kindly got  Mr. S. Griffitts Morgan, of New Bedford, Mass., to defray the cost of  my tuition during the whole time that I was at Hampton. After I finished  the course at Hampton and had entered upon my lifework at Tuskegee, I  had the pleasure of visiting Mr. Morgan several times.    After having been for a while at Hampton, I found myself in difficulty  because I did not have books and clothing. Usually, however, I got  around the trouble about books by borrowing from those who were more  fortunate than myself. As to clothes, when I reached Hampton I had  practically nothing. Everything that I possessed was in a small hand  satchel. My anxiety about clothing was increased because of the fact  that General Armstrong made a personal inspection of the young men in  ranks, to see that their clothes were clean. Shoes had to be polished,  there must be no buttons off the clothing, and no grease-spots. To wear  one suit of clothes continually, while at work and in the schoolroom,  and at the same time keep it clean, was rather a hard problem for me to  solve. In some way I managed to get on till the teachers learned that  I was in earnest and meant to succeed, and then some of them were kind  enough to see that I was partly supplied with second-hand clothing that  had been sent in barrels from the North. These barrels proved a blessing  to hundreds of poor but deserving students. Without them I question  whether I should ever have gotten through Hampton.    When I first went to Hampton I do not recall that I had ever slept in  a bed that had two sheets on it. In those days there were not many  buildings there, and room was very precious. There were seven other boys  in the same room with me; most of them, however, students who had been  there for some time. The sheets were quite a puzzle to me. The first  night I slept under both of them, and the second night I slept on top  of them; but by watching the other boys I learned my lesson in this, and  have been trying to follow it ever since and to teach it to others.    I was among the youngest of the students who were in Hampton at the  time. Most of the students were men and women--some as old as forty  years of age. As I now recall the scene of my first year, I do not  believe that one often has the opportunity of coming into contact with  three or four hundred men and women who were so tremendously in earnest  as these men and women were. Every hour was occupied in study or work.  Nearly all had had enough actual contact with the world to teach them  the need of education. Many of the older ones were, of course, too old  to master the text-books very thoroughly, and it was often sad to watch  their struggles; but they made up in earnest much of what they lacked  in books. Many of them were as poor as I was, and, besides having to  wrestle with their books, they had to struggle with a poverty which  prevented their having the necessities of life. Many of them had aged  parents who were dependent upon them, and some of them were men who had  wives whose support in some way they had to provide for.    The great and prevailing idea that seemed to take possession of every  one was to prepare himself to lift up the people at his home. No one  seemed to think of himself. And the officers and teachers, what a rare  set of human beings they were! They worked for the students night and  day, in seasons and out of season. They seemed happy only when they were  helping the students in some manner. Whenever it is written--and I hope  it will be--the part that the Yankee teachers played in the education  of the Negroes immediately after the war will make one of the most  thrilling parts of the history off this country. The time is not far  distant when the whole South will appreciate this service in a way that  it has not yet been able to do.        Chapter IV. Helping Others    At the end of my first year at Hampton I was confronted with another  difficulty. Most of the students went home to spend their vacation. I  had no money with which to go home, but I had to go somewhere. In those  days very few students were permitted to remain at the school during  vacation. It made me feel very sad and homesick to see the other  students preparing to leave and starting for home. I not only had no  money with which to go home, but I had none with which to go anywhere.    In some way, however, I had gotten hold of an extra, second-hand coat  which I thought was a pretty valuable coat. This I decided to sell, in  order to get a little money for travelling expenses. I had a good deal  of boyish pride, and I tried to hide, as far as I could, from the other  students the fact that I had no money and nowhere to go. I made it known  to a few people in the town of Hampton that I had this coat to sell,  and, after a good deal of persuading, one coloured man promised to come  to my room to look the coat over and consider the matter of buying it.  This cheered my drooping spirits considerably. Early the next morning my  prospective customer appeared. After looking the garment over carefully,  he asked me how much I wanted for it. I told him I thought it was worth  three dollars. He seemed to agree with me as to price, but remarked in  the most matter-of-fact way: \"I tell you what I will do; I will take the  coat, and will pay you five cents, cash down, and pay you the rest of  the money just as soon as I can get it.\" It is not hard to imagine what  my feelings were at the time.    With this disappointment I gave up all hope of getting out of the town  of Hampton for my vacation work. I wanted very much to go where I  might secure work that would at least pay me enough to purchase some  much-needed clothing and other necessities. In a few days practically  all the students and teachers had left for their homes, and this served  to depress my spirits even more.    After trying for several days in and near the town of Hampton, I finally  secured work in a restaurant at Fortress Monroe. The wages, however,  were very little more than my board. At night, and between meals, I  found considerable time for study and reading; and in this direction I  improved myself very much during the summer.    When I left school at the end of my first year, I owed the institution  sixteen dollars that I had not been able to work out. It was my greatest  ambition during the summer to save money enough with which to pay this  debt. I felt that this was a debt of honour, and that I could hardly  bring myself to the point of even trying to enter school again till it  was paid. I economized in every way that I could think of--did my own  washing, and went without necessary garments--but still I found my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23770"],[0,"Mission Furniture: How to Make It, Part 1 (#10)"],[1,"from  showing, a strip of 3/8-in. lumber may be put on all around as shown in  the drawing.    Have the sides, front and back squared up perfectly. The sides are to  overlap the back and to be fastened to it with round-head brass or blue  screws. To the center of the top and base attach one of the 6-1/4-in.  square pieces. Over these, fit the sides and back and fasten them with  screws or nails. The four corner blocks are now put under the base.    Two or more shelves may be set in as shown. Brass or copper hinges will  look well if a dark stain is to be used.    Around the sides and back a 1-in. strip should be fastened to the base  to give added strength.    If a dull finish is desired, apply two coats of stain and two of  prepared wax. If a polished surface is wanted, first fill the pores of  the wood with any standard filler, which can be purchased at a paint  store. After this has dried partly, rub off any surplus filler, rubbing  across the grain of the wood. When perfectly dry apply one coat of  shellac and as many coats of varnish as desired, rubbing down each coat,  except the last, with No. 00 sandpaper and pumice stone.    [Illustration: Detail of Cellarette Pedestal]          A DRESSER      The dresser shown in the illustration was made of quarter-sawed white  oak and finished golden and waxed. The mirror is of beveled glass and  the following is the stock bill:      1 top, 3/4 by 19-1/2 by 33 in., S-2-S.    4 posts, 1-3/4 by 1-3/4 by 28 in., S-4-S.    4 end rails, 3/4 by 2-1/4 by 17 in., S-2-S.    4 stiles, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 20 in., S-2-S.    2 panels, 3/16 by 12 by 18 in., S-2-S.    3 facings, 3/4 by 2-1/4 by 29 in., S-2-S.    2 top frame pieces, 3/4 by 2 by 32 in., S-2-S.    2 top frame pieces, 3/4 by 2 by 19 in., S-2-S.    2 mirror supports, 1 by 2 by 33 in., S-2-S.    1 mirror support, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 33 in., S-2-S.    1 drawer front, 3/4 by 7-1/4 by 28 in., S-2-S.    1 drawer front, 3/4 by 6-1/4 by 28 in., S-2-S.    2 drawer fronts, 3/4 by 5-1/4 by 14 in., S-2-S.    1 partition, 3/4 by 1 by 6 in.    2 mirror-frame pieces, 3/4 by 2 by 40 in., S-2-S.    2 mirror-frame pieces, 3/4 by 2 by 20 in., S-2-S.    The following material list may be of common stock and not  quarter-sawed:      Mirror-backing pieces equivalent to 1/4 by 18-1/2 by 36 in., S-2-S.    2 cleats, 3/4 by 2 by 10 in., S-4-S.    4 drawer-support frame pieces, 3/4 by 2 by 29 in.    7 drawer-support frame pieces, 3/4 by 2 by 15 in.    Slides taken from scrap stock, 3/4 by 1 by 15 in.    3 back pieces, 3/4 by 2-1/4 by 28 in., S-2-S.    2 back pieces, 1/4 by 8 by 28 in., S-2-S.    8 drawer sides, 1/2 by 7-1/4 by 17 in., S-2-S.    2 drawer backs, 3/8 by 7 by 27 in., S-2-S.    2 drawer backs, 3/8 by 7 by 13 in., S-2-S.    2 drawer bottoms, 3/8 by 15 by 27 in., S-2-S.    2 drawer bottoms, 3/8 by 15 by 13 in., S-2-S.    In working up the various parts proceed in the usual manner. If not  thoroughly familiar with the various tool processes involved, it will be  necessary to investigate pieces of near-by furniture and to read up some  good text dealing with the processes involved.    [Illustration: Dresser in Quarter-Sawed Oak]    The exact size of the mirror is 18 by 36 in. and the frame should be  rabbeted to correspond.    [Illustration: Detail of the Dresser]    For a finish, a coat of paste filler colored so as to give a rich  golden brown should be applied first. Allow this to harden, after  rubbing and polishing it in the usual manner, then apply a thin coat of  shellac. Sand this lightly when hard, and over this apply a coat of  orange shellac. Over the shellac put several coats of some good rubbing  wax and polish each coat well. If a striking contrast is wanted for the  medullary rays of the quartering, apply a golden-oak stain first. Sand  this lightly, then apply a second coat diluted one-half with solvent and  sand again lightly. Apply a thin coat of shellac, then, when dry, sand  lightly and apply paste, and proceed as before.          A MISSION SIDEBOARD      Oak is the most suitable material for making this sideboard and it  should be first-class stock, planed and cut to the dimensions given in  the following list:      1 top, 7/8 by 22 by 48 in., S-2-S.    1 top shelf, 7/8 by 12 by 48 in., S-2-S.    1 bottom, 7/8 by 22 by 48 in., S-2-S.    2 back posts, 2 by 2 by 57 in., S-4-S.    2 front posts, 2 by 2 by 36 in., S-4-S.    2 standards, 2 by 2 by 20 in., S-4-S.    2 mirror rails, 7/8 by 2 by 47 in., S-2-S.    2 mirror rails, 7/8 by 2 by 20 in., S-2-S.    3 front and back rails, 7/8 by 3 by 46 in., S-2-S.    4 end rails, 7/8 by 3 by 20 in., S-2-S.    4 standard rails, 7/8 by 2 by 10 in., S-2-S.    2 vertical pieces, 7/8 by 19-1/2 by 22 in., S-2-S.    1 horizontal piece, 7/8 by 22 by 14-1/4 in., S-2-S.    1 drawer front, 7/8 by 6 by 14-1/4 in., S-2-S.    1 piece, 7/8 by 3 by 3 in.    4 vertical door pieces, 7/8 by 2 by 17 in., S-2-S.    4 horizontal door pieces, 7/8 by 2 by 15 in., S-2-S.    2 drawer sides, 7/8 by 5 by 14 in., S-2-S.    1 drawer bottom, 1/4 by 14 by 14-1/4 in., S-2-S.    1 back panel, 1/4 by 16-1/2 by 44-1/2 in., S-2-S.    2 door panels, 1/4 by 10-1/2 by 15-1/2 in., S-2-S.    2 side panels, 1/4 by 18-1/2 by 16-1/2 in., S-2-S.    [Illustration: Detail of the Mission Sideboard]    Begin work by cutting the posts to the length indicated in the detail  drawing. The top ends are tapered with a 1/2-in. slant. These posts are  cut in pairs and it is best to stand them up in the same position they  will be in the finished sideboard, and mark the sides to be mortised  with a pencil. Also cut the grooves into which the panels are to fit.  These are to be 1/4 in. wide and a little over 1/4 in. deep.    [Illustration: Mission Sideboard in Quarter-Sawed Oak]    The rails are cut with tenon ends to match the mortises, and also have  grooves to receive the panels.    The bottom part of the back is closed with a panel and two rails, one at  the same height from the floor as the front bottom rail, and the top one  even with the under side of the top. The large panel is for the opening  thus formed.    These parts are now put together, using plenty of good hot glue, and  spreading it well on the mortises and tenon ends.    When drawing the frame together with the clamps, care must be taken to  get it square.    After the glue is hard enough to remove the clamps, the top and bottom  are put in place. The corners of the top are notched out to fit around  the posts, while the bottom is cut to fit on the inside of the rails and  is held in place by putting screws in at an angle through the bottom  into the rails. The top is also fastened in this way, except that the  screws are run through the rails into the top.    The two vertical pieces are now put in place. Drive nails through the  bottom and into these pieces. On the top end use screws driven at an  angle. Glue may be used if desired.    The doors are made to match these openings. The corners are mitered and  the backs rabbeted to receive the panels. These panels may be made in  art glass if so desired.    The horizontal piece for the drawer to rest upon is now put in place and  fastened by driving nails through the vertical pieces. The drawer is  made to fit this opening, and it should be lined with velvet to keep the  silverware in good condition.    The standards and shelves are put on as shown in the drawing. The mirror  is put in a frame, which is made to fit the back opening and has the  corners mitered and the back rabbeted to receive the mirror.    Thoroughly scrape and sandpaper all parts that are visible. The  sideboard is now ready to be finished as desired.          A HALL OR WINDOW SEAT      [Illustration: Seat Made of Quarter-Sawed Oak]    A simple design for a hall or window seat is shown in the accompanying  sketch and detail drawing. Anyone who has a few sharp tools, and is at  all handy with them, can make this useful and attractive piece of  furniture in a few spare hours. Quarter-sawed oak is the best wood to  use in its construction, as it looks best when finished and is easy to  procure. If the stock is ordered from the mill ready cut to length,  squared and sanded, much of the labor will be saved. The following is a  list of the material needed:      4 corner posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 28 in., S-4-S.    2 side rails, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 36-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 end rails, 3/4 by 4 by 14-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 side braces, 1 by 1 by 36-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 end braces, 1 by 1 by 14-1/2 in. S-4-S.    1 seat, 1 by 16 by 35-3/4 in., S-4-S.    2 top end braces, 3/4 by 2 by 14-1/2 in., S-4-S.    6 slats, 3/4 by 2 by 6-1/2 in., S-4-S.    Square up the four posts and lay out the mortises according to the  drawing. To do this, lay them on a flat surface with the ends square and  mark them with a try-square. The tenons on the end and side rails are  laid out in the same manner as the posts. The end rails should be marked  and mortises cut for the upright slats as shown in the detail drawing.  Fit the end and side braces with mortise and tenon joints.    The two end frames can now be glued and clamped together and set away to  dry. Put all the parts together before gluing to see that they fit  square and tight.    The seat should be made of one piece if possible, otherwise two or more  boards will have to be glued together. The corners should be cut out to  fit around the posts. It rests on the side rails and cleats fastened to  the inner side of the end rails.    When the window seat is complete go over it carefully and scrape all the  surplus glue from about the joints, as the finish will not take where  there is any glue. Remove all rough spots with fine sandpaper, then  apply the stain best liked, which may be any one of the many mission  stains supplied by the trade for this purpose. If this window seat is  well made and finished, it will be an ornament to any home.    [Illustration: Detail of the Hall or Window Seat]          A MISSION PLANT STAND      For the"]]]
