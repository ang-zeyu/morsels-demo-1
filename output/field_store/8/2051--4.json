The result of these contradictory  inclinations and influences is shown in our present political  weakness, which I am afraid will be fruitless in the end.    What is to be expected from this policy? In case of victory of the  Triple Entente, Bulgaria can hope for nothing good. If the Dual  Alliance is victorious we shall have certain compensations that to my  deep conviction will be far from satisfying our national aspirations.  The Austro-German alliance, first of all, will think of itself; that  is to say, to realize the greatest ideals of pan-Germanism, the  debouching of Austria in the Aegean Sea through Saloniki, which  necessarily comprises the occupation by Austria of all Macedonia west  of the Vardar. In the second place, Turkey will have to be compensated  and strengthened, as in the future her army will be a more obedient  organ in the hands of German diplomacy and more amenable than Slav  Bulgaria, whose troops, in the opinion of the most prominent German  papers, cannot fight the Russians, while Turkey at any time is ready  to serve Germany. But Turkey can be compensated in Europe only at the  expense of Bulgarian Thrace. To Bulgaria will be given, at most,  Istip, Kotchana, Radovich, Serres Drama, and Cavalla to make good the  losses in Thrace.    To obtain such a meagre result, the Government of Bulgaria maintains a  policy contrary to popular sentiment and to the racial bonds of the  people, and a policy contrary to the further interests of Bulgaria,  which are incompatible with the building up of a strong Turkey in the  Balkans, a Turkey that would be the bulwark of Germany. The most  essential part of it is that this policy is based on a most  improbable hypothesis, that is to say, the final triumph of the  Austro-German arms. If the Bulgarian Government had left prejudices to  one side and looked clearly at the events, they would not have been  slow to understand that from the moment England stepped into the war  and Italy abandoned her allies, the Austro-German alliance politically  lost the game. Each passing day diminishes more and more the hopes of  success of the Dual Alliance, and permits England and Russia to expand  their inexhaustible forces. It is not difficult to foresee from now  the terms of peace that England and Russia will impose. Any policy  which expects to profit from the defeat of these two powers is doomed  to failure, and because such is the policy of the Bulgarian  Government, we think that it is against the interests of the country.    This policy, among its other disadvantages, opens forever a gap  between little Bulgaria and great Russia, which power, even if  defeated, will never cease to play an active part in the Balkans.  Against this policy, which is risking much to obtain little, we  propose the policy of coming to an agreement with the Triple Entente,  on the basis of a Bulgarian neutrality favorable to it, which surely  and without sacrifices is expected to bring to us greatest results.  The only thing that the powers of the Triple Entente are demanding  from us is to open negotiations with them. This does not abolish our  neutrality, because other States, too, such as Italy, Rumania, Greece,  and Turkey, are negotiating at the present time.      BALKAN ALLIANCE OPPOSED.    _An editorial article which appeared in the Bulgarian paper Volja of  the Stamboulovist Party, on Dec. 20, 1914, appears below._    The question has been raised whether in reality negotiations are being  conducted between the Balkan States, that is to say, Bulgaria and  Servia, Greece and Bulgaria, Bulgaria and Rumania. How much of this is  true?    Such negotiations are not being conducted, neither do we believe that  it is possible for them to exist, because we do not know what our  neighbors demand from us. The only true part of this story is that the  powers of the Triple Entente are endeavoring to drag into the war  Greece, Bulgaria, and Rumania, a thing that would be not only  profitable to them, but even necessary for these same powers of the  Triple Entente.    And as long as Bulgaria is not any longer inhabited by imbeciles, who  will undertake once more a war for the promotion of the glory and the  interests of those who by every means endeavored to ruin us, these  powers are thinking today, being moved by some sentiment of humanity,  that certain concessions must be made to Bulgaria, but on condition of  military support.    And so far as concerns Servia, who only a few days ago was on the  brink of the precipice, and who, in a little while from now, will find  herself in a worse position, it is apparent that, without the  assistance of Bulgaria, her ruin will be certain. This, however, does  not prevent Servia as well as the Triple Entente from insisting on  giving us as little as possible, and then only after the Serbs have  taken Bosnia and Herzegovina.    Rumania and Greece desire an understanding for the sake of their  tranquillity. And it was said that Rumania is giving Dobrudja, but  Greece does not want even to hear of the cession of Cavalla Drama and  Serres, but, on the contrary, demands, in case Bulgaria gets Servian  Macedonia, to obtain for her (Greece's) account Doirani, Ghevgeli, and  Monastir. Greece and Rumania agree on one point--themselves to stay  out of the war, while inducing Bulgaria to fight.    But Bulgaria insists on getting compensation, not by war but by her  neutrality. The aspirations therefore of the interested States are  totally different, and, under such circumstances, no understanding is  possible. The object of the Triple Entente is clear. But this is no  concern of ours, nor of any of the other Balkan States, with the  exception of Servia.    Therefore, to speak plainly, the understanding will be possible only  when interests are taken into account. And on this basis some means to  an understanding with our neighbors will be found, whether they want  it or not.          THE TURK IN EGYPT'S EYES.    [Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES.]      Cairo, Jan. 31, (Dispatch to The London Daily News.)--In order to  understand the bearing of the latest news upon Moslem opinion,  particularly in Cairo and Alexandria, it must be borne in mind that  Turkey still enjoys considerable military prestige here. Tens of  thousands of Egyptians continue to regard her one of the great powers.  They never believed the news of her defeat in the Balkans and the  reoccupation of Adrianople confirmed them in their skepticism. At the  same time, a secret German propaganda for some years before the war  did much to spread abroad the doctrine of German invincibility. It is  not to be wondered at, therefore, that a section of the population  holds entirely erroneous views as to the present balance of power and  requires unmistakable evidence of Turkish defeat to open their eyes.          Greece's Watchful Waiting    Grecian Neutrality Defined    [From the Athenae, Athens, July 23, (Aug. 3,) 1914.]      Yesterday at 10 A.M. the Council of Ministers met at the Premier's  house and took cognizance of a number of dispatches from the Hellenic  representatives of the Governments of the great powers relating to the  European war which has just begun. At 11 A.M. the Ministers went in a  body to the palace, where, under the Presidency of the King, a council  was held which discussed the position of Greece in the European  conflict. His Majesty, having listened to the Premier, who  communicated all the latest news regarding the situation, agreed on  all points as to the attitude of Greece in the Austro-Servian  conflict, which attitude would be one of absolute neutrality as long  as Bulgaria and Turkey remained neutral.    During this council the Chief of Staff of the army, Gen. v. Dousmanis,  was sent for, and he gave the Ministers some information of a military  character regarding the position of Greece. Gen. Dousmanis assured  them that the army was in excellent condition and that all preliminary  preparations for a mobilization were already taken.      FRENCH, GREEKS, AND GERMANS.    [_Editorial comment of the Athenae of Aug. 9 (Sept. 21)_]:    ... In Greece there does not exist a discrimination between those who  love France and those who do not, because as a rule the entire nation  worships France. The Hellenic world, from the most uneducated citizen  to the one who represents all the development of intellect, worships  France.    It was always with admiration that the discerning Hellenic intellect  looked upon the French Nation, which is the leader in every progress.  French letters, French art, and French industry have found in Greece  sincere admirers and enthusiastic heralds. The French heroism, the  devotion that every Frenchman feels for the ideals of the fatherland,  the superiority of the French woman, whom certain malevolent writers  have so misrepresented to the world; the virtue of the French  housewife, the French mother, and the French patriot, have always been  splendid examples to those who are apt to think on the world's  progress. The birthplace of the forerunners of the modern social and  civic spirit and the mother of the most genuine philhellenism, the  France of Rabelais, Moliere and Voltaire and Beranger and Hugo has  always been an object of respectful sympathy for those in Greece who  are admirers of the beautiful, the liberal, and the ideal.    Every one of us knows that, if France has not been able to help  materialize the Greek's rightful aspirations, this is not due to lack  of good intentions on her part, but rather to the French compliance  with the interests of the Slav; and we know that France had to  cultivate those interests by her own wealth, and contrary to her  democratic principles, only in order to have an alliance against her  neighboring enemy, against whom she meditated revenge for a defeat and  the vindication of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20523"],[0,"Religion and Art in Ancient Greece (#10)"],[1,"excellence, the combination of  music and gymnastic, which again brings us back to a national Hellenic  ideal. Throughout the representations of the gods in the art of the  fifth century we find the same essential character. They embody in  themselves the expression, by means of the most perfect physical forms,  of the qualities attributed to the god himself, or given by him to his  worshippers. They are no impersonal abstraction of these qualities, but  are real and living beings, in whom these qualities exist to a degree  impossible for a mere mortal. But, on the other hand, they have nothing  of the passions and emotions, the weaknesses and imperfections of mortal  nature. In this they are inconsistent, perhaps, with that Homeric  presentment of the gods which the greatest artists consciously set  before themselves. But we cannot wonder that an age of such clear and  lofty intellectual and moral perceptions should have rejected what it  felt to be unworthy in the current notions of the gods, and should have  selected only what it felt to be truly divine. Art did not, however,  remain very long upon its highest level of religious feeling; but in  Greece, by a fortunate coincidence, the age of the greatest religious  ideals was also that of the highest perfection of physical type in art  as well as of technical skill in execution. We do not therefore find in  this age that the sculptor lacks the power to express his ideas, or that  his ideas are too strong for the forms in which they are expressed;  there is rather that perfect harmony between the two that, here as  elsewhere, is characteristic of Hellenic art.          CHAPTER VI    INDIVIDUALISM      The great religious ideals of the fifth century were, as we have seen,  closely bound up with the subordination of the individual to the State;  and their expression in sculpture was also due in almost every case to  the employment of the artist by the community. In the fourth century, on  the other hand, we find on every side a stronger assertion of  individuality. It was a commonplace among Attic orators in the fourth  century to contrast the private luxury and ostentation of their own day  with the simplicity of life among the great men of the earlier age,  whose houses could not be distinguished from those of the common people,  though their public buildings and the temples they raised to the gods  were of unparalleled splendour. In religion, and above all in religious  art, we find something of the same tendency. There are few if any  records of the dedication during the fourth century of those great  statues of the chief gods which were looked back to by all subsequent  generations as the embodiment of a national ideal. But there were,  perhaps, more statues of the gods made in the fourth century which were  the objects not merely of artistic admiration, but of intense and  sometimes morbid personal devotion. The mere list of the gods preferred  for representation is an indication in itself; while in the fifth  century, Zeus and Athena and Hera, the great gods of the State or of the  Hellenic race, are the subjects of the most famous statues, in the  fourth century it is rather Aphrodite and Dionysus and Asclepius, those  whose gifts contribute to individual happiness or enjoyment, that offer  most scope to the powers of the artist.    And the sculptors themselves, in the fourth century, show more  individuality of style. In the latter part of the fifth century the  genius of Phidias had so dominated religious art that the works of his  successors, men like Alcamenes and Agoracritus, could hardly be  distinguished from his. But the great sculptors of the fourth century,  Scopas and Praxiteles and Lysippus, not to mention others of less note,  devoted themselves not so much to the expression through perfect  physical form of great religious ideals, but to a realisation of the  character and, so to speak, the personality of the gods whom they  portrayed. And they did this by the same means by which they expressed  in their art the characters and passions of heroes or of men, thereby  removing the gods from the sphere of passionless benignity and power  which is assigned to them by the art of the fifth century. Such a  treatment evidently gave more scope for variety in the styles of the  sculptors; and although we can sometimes trace the influence of one upon  another, yet each clearly shows his own characteristics. We are  expressly told of Praxiteles that he showed the most admirable skill in  infusing into his marble works the passions and emotions of the soul;  and the extant remains of the statues made by Scopas and Lysippus show  that they also, each in his own way, attained the same results.    If the sculpture of the fifth century was ethical, expressing noble  ideals of character whether in gods or men, that of the fourth century  may be called psychological. It is not content with character; it  expresses also mood and even passion, and thereby gives more prominence  to individuality. At first sight it is not easy to realise how this  change came to affect the representations of the gods. The gods of Homer  are, indeed, full of individual character; but we have seen how in the  fifth century, though the greatest sculptors declared it was the gods of  Homer that they represented, these representations were idealised and  raised above those human touches in which the individuality is most  conspicuous. There was, in the Homeric hymns and in the lyric poets, a  delight in details of incident and in personal peculiarities and even in  romantic tales about the gods; and in the fourth century, when the high  idealisation of the preceding age is no longer so strong in its  influence, we find a similar tendency in art as well. While the great  statues of the gods in the fifth century are almost all represented as  either enthroned or standing, not employed in any particular action or  function, the most characteristic examples of the statues of gods made  in the fourth century have almost all some definite motive. We may take  as an example what was perhaps the most famous statue of antiquity, the  Aphrodite by Praxiteles at Cnidus. The goddess is represented as nude;  and it is often said that goddesses would not have been so represented  in the fifth century. It is true that full drapery seems more consistent  with the dignified and august figures of Phidian art. But if the  religious type had required that Phidias should make a nude goddess, we  may be sure he would have made her naked and unashamed, with no more  self-consciousness than a nude Apollo; above all, he would not have  thought it necessary to provide a motive for her nudity. With Praxiteles  it is otherwise. He represents the goddess as preparing for the bath,  and just letting her last garment slip from her hand on to a vase that  stands beside her; and, in addition to this provision of a motive--an  excuse, one might almost say--for representing her without her clothes,  he hints, from the instinctive gesture of her other hand which she holds  before her body, at a half-conscious shrinking from exposure, a feeling  of modesty which, however suitable to a woman, is by no means consistent  with a high ideal of the goddess. The face and figure are of  extraordinary physical beauty of type, of a breadth and nobility which  contrast with the smaller, prettier, and less dignified forms of later  art; the gesture, too, has not the conscious coquetry which we see in  such a work as the Venus de' Medici. But, on the other hand, we must  recognise that the statue represents the goddess under a human rather  than a divine aspect, that even her mood and feeling of timidity are  portrayed in a manner which, however charming in itself, is totally  inconsistent with her worship as a great goddess. We are not surprised  to hear that this statue inspired a personal passion; she is the goddess  of love, and is represented as not beyond the reach of human attraction;  but she is brought down to the level of mortals, rather than capable of  raising mortals to a higher sphere by her contemplation. It is the same,  though perhaps to a less degree, with other statues of the gods made in  the fourth century. The motives with which the later Greeks went to  visit the great statues of the Phidian age were, as we have seen, to a  great extent religious, and their contemplation was regarded to some  extent as a service; here we have \"idolatry\" in its highest form. But  those who went to see the Aphrodite of Cnidus went chiefly to enjoy the  beauty of the statue; and although this may be the best thing from the  artistic point of view, it certainly has not the same religious import.    There is another element in the individuality of fourth-century statues  which may appeal to modern artists, and which certainly did appeal--in  an inverted manner--to early Christian writers of invectives against  pagan idolatry. It was said that Phryne had posed as a model for the  Cnidian Aphrodite of Praxiteles; and the character of the goddess was  inferred from that of her votary. It is clear that a Greek artist could  not have, in the case of a nude female statue, the same choice of types  constantly present to his observation and his memory as he had in the  case of male statues; and the individuality of the model, however  beautiful, would thus tend to assert itself against the type. Thus  personality and individual character, \"the ultimate condition of  beauty,\" to use Mr. Ruskin's words, in modern as in Tuscan art, comes  much nearer to expression in the fourth century than in the fifth. But a  study of such a statue as the Cnidian Aphrodite shows us nevertheless  that in the beauty of the type and the avoidance of the accidental, the  art of Praxiteles was as far removed from realism as it was from the  vague generalisation of Graeco-Roman and modern pseudo-classical art. It  is full of life and individuality, but it "]]]
