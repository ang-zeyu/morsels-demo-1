[Note 37: It is thus that I am compelled to render a female  garment not known, so far as I am aware, to Western Europe.  It is called by the natives \"doushegreika,\" that is to say,  \"warmer of the soul\"--in French, chaufferette de l'ame. It  is a species of thick pelisse worn over the \"sarafan,\" or  gown.]    XXI    But borne in spirit far away  Tattiana gazes on the moon,  And starting suddenly doth say:  \"Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.  Pen, paper bring: the table too  Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go--  Good-night.\" Behold! she is alone!  'Tis silent--on her shines the moon--  Upon her elbow she reclines,  And Eugene ever in her soul  Indites an inconsiderate scroll  Wherein love innocently pines.  Now it is ready to be sent--  For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?    XXII    I have known beauties cold and raw  As Winter in their purity,  Striking the intellect with awe  By dull insensibility,  And I admired their common sense  And natural benevolence,  But, I acknowledge, from them fled;  For on their brows I trembling read  The inscription o'er the gates of Hell  \"Abandon hope for ever here!\"(38)  Love to inspire doth woe appear  To such--delightful to repel.  Perchance upon the Neva e'en  Similar dames ye may have seen.    [Note 38: A Russian annotator complains that the poet has  mutilated Dante's famous line.]    XXIII    Amid submissive herds of men  Virgins miraculous I see,  Who selfishly unmoved remain  Alike by sighs and flattery.  But what astonished do I find  When harsh demeanour hath consigned  A timid love to banishment?--  On fresh allurements they are bent,  At least by show of sympathy;  At least their accents and their words  Appear attuned to softer chords;  And then with blind credulity  The youthful lover once again  Pursues phantasmagoria vain.    XXIV    Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?--  Because in singleness of thought  She never of deception dreamed  But trusted the ideal she wrought?--  Because her passion wanted art,  Obeyed the impulses of heart?--  Because she was so innocent,  That Heaven her character had blent  With an imagination wild,  With intellect and strong volition  And a determined disposition,  An ardent heart and yet so mild?--  Doth love's incautiousness in her  So irremissible appear?    XXV    O ye whom tender love hath pained  Without the ken of parents both,  Whose hearts responsive have remained  To the impressions of our youth,  The all-entrancing joys of love--  Young ladies, if ye ever strove  The mystic lines to tear away  A lover's letter might convey,  Or into bold hands anxiously  Have e'er a precious tress consigned,  Or even, silent and resigned,  When separation's hour drew nigh,  Have felt love's agitated kiss  With tears, confused emotions, bliss,--    XXVI    With unanimity complete,  Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;  Do not cold-bloodedly repeat  The sneers of critics superfine;  And you, O maids immaculate,  Whom vice, if named, doth agitate  E'en as the presence of a snake,  I the same admonition make.  Who knows? with love's consuming flame  Perchance you also soon may burn,  Then to some gallant in your turn  Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame  The triumph of a conquest new.  The God of Love is after you!    XXVII    A coquette loves by calculation,  Tattiana's love was quite sincere,  A love which knew no limitation,  Even as the love of children dear.  She did not think \"procrastination  Enhances love in estimation  And thus secures the prey we seek.  His vanity first let us pique  With hope and then perplexity,  Excruciate the heart and late  With jealous fire resuscitate,  Lest jaded with satiety,  The artful prisoner should seek  Incessantly his chains to break.\"    XXVIII    I still a complication view,  My country's honour and repute  Demands that I translate for you  The letter which Tattiana wrote.  At Russ she was by no means clever  And read our newspapers scarce ever,  And in her native language she  Possessed nor ease nor fluency,  So she in French herself expressed.  I cannot help it I declare,  Though hitherto a lady ne'er  In Russ her love made manifest,  And never hath our language proud  In correspondence been allowed.(39)    [Note 39: It is well known that until the reign of the late Tsar  French was the language of the Russian court and of Russian  fashionable society. It should be borne in mind that at the time  this poem was written literary warfare more or less open was  being waged between two hostile schools of Russian men of  letters. These consisted of the _Arzamass_, or French school, to  which Pushkin himself together with his uncle Vassili Pushkin  the \"Nestor of the Arzamass\" belonged, and their opponents who  devoted themselves to the cultivation of the vernacular.]    XXIX    They wish that ladies should, I hear,  Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!  I can't conceive a little dear  With the \"Well-Wisher\" in her hand!(40)  I ask, all ye who poets are,  Is it not true? the objects fair,  To whom ye for unnumbered crimes  Had to compose in secret rhymes,  To whom your hearts were consecrate,--  Did they not all the Russian tongue  With little knowledge and that wrong  In charming fashion mutilate?  Did not their lips with foreign speech  The native Russian tongue impeach?    [Note 40: The \"Blago-Namierenni,\" or \"Well-Wisher,\" was an  inferior Russian newspaper of the day, much scoffed at by  contemporaries. The editor once excused himself for some  gross error by pleading that he had been \"on the loose.\"]    XXX    God grant I meet not at a ball  Or at a promenade mayhap,  A schoolmaster in yellow shawl  Or a professor in tulle cap.  As rosy lips without a smile,  The Russian language I deem vile  Without grammatical mistakes.  May be, and this my terror wakes,  The fair of the next generation,  As every journal now entreats,  Will teach grammatical conceits,  Introduce verse in conversation.  But I--what is all this to me?  Will to the old times faithful be.    XXXI    Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,  With inexact pronunciation  Raises within my breast as oft  As formerly much agitation.  Repentance wields not now her spell  And gallicisms I love as well  As the sins of my youthful days  Or Bogdanovitch's sweet lays.(41)  But I must now employ my Muse  With the epistle of my fair;  I promised!--Did I so?--Well, there!  Now I am ready to refuse.  I know that Parny's tender pen(42)  Is no more cherished amongst men.    [Note 41: Hippolyte Bogdanovitch--b. 1743, d. 1803--though  possessing considerable poetical talent was like many other  Russian authors more remarkable for successful imitation  than for original genius. His most remarkable production  is \"Doushenka,\" \"The Darling,\" a composition somewhat in  the style of La Fontaine's \"Psyche.\" Its merit consists in  graceful phraseology, and a strong pervading sense of humour.]    [Note 42: Parny--a French poet of the era of the first Napoleon,  b. 1753, d. 1814. Introduced to the aged Voltaire during  his last visit to Paris, the patriarch laid his hands upon  the youth's head and exclaimed: \"Mon cher Tibulle.\" He is  chiefly known for his erotic poetry which attracted the  affectionate regard of the youthful Pushkin when a student  at the Lyceum. We regret to add that, having accepted a  pension from Napoleon, Parny forthwith proceeded to damage  his literary reputation by inditing an \"epic\" poem entitled  \"Goddam! Goddam! par un French--Dog.\" It is descriptive  of the approaching conquest of Britain by Napoleon, and  treats the embryo enterprise as if already conducted to a  successful conclusion and become matter of history.

He presently drew a roll  of paper from under his waist-belt, and in a short time was engrossed  with his study. The women seeing this conduct, exerted themselves in  every possible way of wile to attract his attention and to distract his  soul. They succeeded only so far as to make him roll his head with a  smile, and to remember that such is always the custom of man's bane;  after which he turned over a fresh page of manuscript. And although he  presently began to wonder what had become of the prince his master, he  did not look up even once from his study.    He was a philosopher, that young man. But after all, Raja Vikram, what  is mortal philosophy? Nothing but another name for indifference! Who was  ever philosophical about a thing truly loved or really hated?--no one!  Philosophy, says Shankharacharya, is either a gift of nature or the  reward of study. But I, the Baital, the devil, ask you, what is a born  philosopher, save a man of cold desires? And what is a bred philosopher  but a man who has survived his desires? A young philosopher?--a  cold-blooded youth! An elderly philosopher?--a leuco-phlegmatic old  man! Much nonsense, of a verity, ye hear in praise of nothing from your  Rajaship's Nine Gems of Science, and from sundry other such wise fools.    Then the prince began to relate the state of his case, saying, \"O  friend, I have seen a damsel, but whether she be a musician from Indra's  heaven, a maiden of the sea, a daughter of the serpent kings, or the  child of an earthly Raja, I cannot say.\"    \"Describe her,\" said the statesman in embryo.    \"Her face,\" quoth the prince, \"was that of the full moon, her hair like  a swarm of bees hanging from the blossoms of the acacia, the corners of  her eyes touched her ears, her lips were sweet with lunar ambrosia, her  waist was that of a lion, and her walk the walk of a king goose. [53]  As a garment, she was white; as a season, the spring; as a flower, the  jasmine; as a speaker, the kokila bird; as a perfume, musk; as a  beauty, Kamadeva; and as a being, Love. And if she does not come into my  possession I will not live; this I have certainly determined upon.\"    The young minister, who had heard his prince say the same thing more  than once before, did not attach great importance to these awful words.  He merely remarked that, unless they mounted at once, night would  surprise them in the forest. Then the two young men returned to their  horses, untethered them, drew on their bridles, saddled them, and  catching up their weapons, rode slowly towards the Raja's palace.  During the three hours of return hardly a word passed between the  pair. Vajramukut not only avoided speaking; he never once replied till  addressed thrice in the loudest voice.    The young minister put no more questions, \"for,\" quoth he to himself,  \"when the prince wants my counsel, he will apply for it.\" In this point  he had borrowed wisdom from his father, who held in peculiar horror the  giving of unasked-for advice. So, when he saw that conversation was  irksome to his master, he held his peace and meditated upon what he  called his \"day-thought.\" It was his practice to choose every morning  some tough food for reflection, and to chew the cud of it in his mind  at times when, without such employment, his wits would have gone  wool-gathering. You may imagine, Raja Vikram, that with a few years of  this head work, the minister's son became a very crafty young person.    After the second day the Prince Vajramukut, being restless from grief  at separation, fretted himself into a fever. Having given up writing,  reading, drinking, sleeping, the affairs entrusted to him by his father,  and everything else, he sat down, as he said, to die. He used constantly  to paint the portrait of the beautiful lotus gatherer, and to lie gazing  upon it with tearful eyes; then he would start up and tear it to pieces  and beat his forehead, and begin another picture of a yet more beautiful  face.    At last, as the pradhan's son had foreseen, he was summoned by the  young Raja, whom he found upon his bed, looking yellow and complaining  bitterly of headache. Frequent discussions upon the subject of the  tender passion had passed between the two youths, and one of them had  ever spoken of it so very disrespectfully that the other felt ashamed  to introduce it. But when his friend, with a view to provoke  communicativeness, advised a course of boiled and bitter herbs and  great attention to diet, quoting the hemistich attributed to the learned  physician Charndatta,          A fever starve, but feed a cold,    the unhappy Vajramukut's fortitude abandoned him; he burst into tears,  and exclaimed, \"Whosoever enters upon the path of love cannot survive  it; and if (by chance) he should live, what is life to him but a  prolongation of his misery?\"    \"Yea,\" replied the minister's son, \"the sage hath said--    \"The road of love is that which hath no beginning nor end; Take thou heed  of thyself, man I ere thou place foot upon it.    \"And the wise, knowing that there are three things whose effect upon  himself no man can foretell--namely, desire of woman, the dice-box, and  the drinking of ardent spirits--find total abstinence from them the best  of rules. Yet, after all, if there is no cow, we must milk the bull.\"    The advice was, of course, excellent, but the hapless lover could not  help thinking that on this occasion it came a little too late. However,  after a pause he returned to the subject and said, \"I have ventured  to tread that dangerous way, be its end pain or pleasure, happiness or  destruction.\" He then hung down his head and sighed from the bottom of  his heart.    \"She is the person who appeared to us at the tank?\" asked the pradhan's  son, moved to compassion by the state of his master.    The prince assented.    \"O great king,\" resumed the minister's son, \"at the time of going away  had she said anything to you? or had you said anything to her?\"    \"Nothing!\" replied the other laconically, when he found his friend  beginning to take an interest in the affair.    \"Then,\" said the minister's son, \"it will be exceedingly difficult to  get possession of her.\"    \"Then,\" repeated the Raja's son, \"I am doomed to death; to an early and  melancholy death!\"    \"Humph!\" ejaculated the young statesman rather impatiently, \"did she  make any sign, or give any hint? Let me know all that happened: half  confidences are worse than none.\"    Upon which the prince related everything that took place by the side  of the tank, bewailing the false shame which had made him dumb, and  concluding with her pantomime.    The pradhan's son took thought for a while. He thereupon seized the  opportunity of representing to his master all the evil effects of  bashfulness when women are concerned, and advised him, as he would be a  happy lover, to brazen his countenance for the next interview.    Which the young Raja faithfully promised to do.    \"And, now,\" said the other, \"be comforted, O my master! I know her name  and her dwelling-place. When she suddenly plucked the lotus flower and  worshipped it, she thanked the gods for having blessed her with a sight  of your beauty.\"    Vajramukut smiled, the first time for the last month.    \"When she applied it to her ear, it was as if she would have explained  to thee, 'I am a daughter of the Carnatic: [54] and when she bit it with  her teeth, she meant to say that 'My father is Raja Dantawat, [55]' who,  by-the-bye, has been, is, and ever will be, a mortal foe to thy father.\"    Vajramukut shuddered.    \"When she put it under her foot it meant, 'My name is Padmavati. [56]'\"    Vajramukut uttered a cry of joy.    \"And when she placed it in her bosom, 'You are truly dwelling in my  heart' was meant to be understood.\"    At these words the young Raja started up full of new life, and after  praising with enthusiasm the wondrous sagacity of his dear friend,  begged him by some contrivance to obtain the permission of his parents,  and to conduct him to her city. The minister's son easily got leave for  Vajramukut to travel, under pretext that his body required change  of water, and his mind change of scene. They both dressed and armed  themselves for the journey, and having taken some jewels, mounted their  horses and followed the road in that direction in which the princess had  gone.    Arrived after some days at the capital of the Carnatic, the minister's  son having disguised his master and himself in the garb of travelling  traders, alighted and pitched his little tent upon a clear bit of ground  in one of the suburbs. He then proceeded to inquire for a wise woman,  wanting, he said, to have his fortune told. When the prince asked  him what this meant, he replied that elderly dames who professionally  predict the future are never above ministering to the present, and  therefore that, in such circumstances, they are the properest persons to  be consulted.    \"Is this a treatise upon the subject of immorality, devil?\" demanded the  King Vikram ferociously. The Baital declared that it was not, but that  he must tell his story.    The person addressed pointed to an old woman who, seated before the door  of her hut, was spinning at her wheel. Then the young men went up to her  with polite salutations and said, \"Mother, we are travelling traders,  and our stock is coming after us; we have come on in advance for the  purpose of finding a place to live in. If you will give us a house, we  will remain there and pay you highly.\"    The old woman, who was a physiognomist as well as a fortune-teller,  looked at the faces of the young"]]]
