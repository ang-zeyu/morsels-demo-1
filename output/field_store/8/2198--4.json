This camp was fully six miles from  Schuermann's ranch and was surrounded by some of the wildest scenery  that I had ever witnessed. The accompanying view (plate XCVIII) was  taken from a small elevation near by, and gives a faint idea of the  magnificent mountains by which we were surrounded. The colors of the  rocks are variegated, so that the gorgeous cliffs appear to be banded,  rising from 800 to 1,000 feet sheer on all sides. These rocks had  weathered into fantastic shapes suggestive of cathedrals, Greek  temples, and sharp steeples of churches extending like giant needles  into the sky. The scenery compares very favorably with that of the  Garden of the Gods, and is much more extended. This place, I have no  doubt, will sooner or later become popular with the sightseer, and I  regard the discovery of these cliffs one of the most interesting of my  summer's field work.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY    SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. XCVII    PICTOGRAPHS NEAR CLIFF RANCH, VERDE VALLEY]    On the sides of these inaccessible cliffs we noticed several cliff  houses, but so high were they perched above us that they were almost  invisible. To reach them at their dizzy altitude was impossible, but  we were able to enter some caves a few hundred feet above our camp,  finding in them nothing but charred mescal and other evidences of  Apache camps. Their walls and entrances are blackened with smoke, but  no sign of masonry was detected.    We moved our camp westward from this canyon (which, from a great cliff  resembling the Parthenon, I called Temple canyon), following the base  of the precipitous mountains to a second canyon, equally beautiful but  not so grand, and built our fire in a small grove of scrub oak and  cottonwood. In this lonely place Lloyd had lived over a winter,  watching his stock, and had dug a well and erected a corral. We  adopted his name for this camp and called it Lloyd canyon. There was  no water in the well, but a few rods beyond it there was a pool, from  which we watered our horses. On the first evening at this camp we  sighted a bear, which gave the name Honanki, \"Bear-house,\" to the  adjacent ruined dwellings.    The enormous precipice of red rock west of our camp at Lloyd's corral  hid Honanki from view at first, but we soon found a trail leading  directly to it, and during our short stay in this neighborhood we  remained camped near the cottonwoods at the entrance to the canyon,  not far from the abandoned corral. Our studies of Honanki led to the  discovery of Palatki (figure 247), which we investigated on our return  to Temple canyon. I will, therefore, begin my description of the  Red-rock cliff houses with those last discovered, which, up to the  visit which I made, had never been studied by archeologists.      PALATKI    There are two neighboring ruins which I shall include in my  consideration of Palatki, and these for convenience may be known as  Ruin I and Ruin II, the former situated a little eastward from the  latter. They are but a short distance apart, and are in the same box  canyon. Ruin I (plate XCIX) is the better preserved, and is a fine  type of the compact form of cliff dwellings in the Red-rock country.    This ruin is perched on the top of a talus which has fallen from the  cliff above, and is visible for some distance above the trees, as one  penetrates the canyon. It is built to the side of a perpendicular  wall of rock which, high above its tallest walls, arches over it,  sheltering the walls from rain or eroding influences. From the dry  character of the earth on the floors I suspect that for years not a  drop of water has penetrated the inclosures, although they are now  roofless.    A highly characteristic feature of Ruin I is the repetition of rounded  or bow-shape front walls, occurring several times in their length, and  arranged in such a way as to correspond roughly to the inclosures  behind them. By this arrangement the size of the rooms was increased  and possibly additional solidity given to the wall itself. This  departure from a straight wall implies a degree of architectural  skill, which, while not peculiar to the cliff dwellings of the  Red-rocks, is rarely found in southern cliff houses. The total length  of the front wall of the ruin, including the part which has fallen, is  approximately 120 feet, and the altitude of the highest wall is not  far from 30 feet.    [Illustration: FIG. 247--Ground plan of Palatki (Ruins I and II)]    From the arrangement of openings in the front wall at the highest part  there is good evidence of the former existence of two stories. At  several points the foundation of the wall is laid on massive bowlders,  which contribute to the height of the wall itself. The masonry is made  up of irregular or roughly squared blocks of red stone laid in red  clay, both evidently gathered in the immediate neighborhood of the  ruin. The building stones vary in size, but are as a rule flat, and  show well directed fractures as if dressed by hammering. In several  places there still remains a superficial plastering, which almost  conceals the masonry. The blocks of stone in the lower courses are  generally more massive than those higher up; this feature, however,  whether considered as occurring here or in the cliff houses of Mesa  Verde, as pointed out by Nordenskioeld, seems to me not to indicate  different builders, but is due simply to convenience. There appears to  be no regularity in the courses of component blocks of stone, and when  necessity compelled, as in the courses laid on bowlders, which serve  as a foundation, thin wedges of stone, or spalls, were inserted in the  crevices. The walls are vertical, but the corners are sometimes far  from perpendicular.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY    SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. XCVIII    THE RED ROCKS; TEMPLE CANYON]    The interior of the ruin is divided into a number of inclosures by  partitions at right angles to the front wall, fastening it to the face  of the cliff. This I have lettered, beginning at the extreme right  inclosure with _A_. The inclosure has bounding walls, built on a  bowlder somewhat more than six feet high. It has no external  passageway, and probably the entrance was from the roof. This  inclosure communicates by a doorway directly with the adjoining  chamber, _B_. The corner of this room, or the angle made by the  lateral with the front walls, is rounded, a constant feature in  well-built cliff houses. No windows exist, and the upper edge of both  front and lateral walls is but slightly broken.    The front wall of inclosure _B_ bulges into bow-shape form, and was  evidently at least two stories high. This wall is a finely laid  section of masonry, composed of large, rough stones in the lower  courses, upon which smaller, roughly hewn stones are built. It is  probable, from the large amount of debris in the neighborhood, that  formerly there were rows of single-story rooms in front of what are  now the standing walls, but the character of their architecture is  difficult to determine with certainty. Their foundations, although  partially covered, are not wholly concealed.    The front wall of inclosure _B_ is pierced by three openings, the  largest of which is a square passageway into the adjoining room, and  is situated in the middle of the curved wall. A wooden lintel, which  had been well hewn with stone implements, still remains in place above  this passageway, and under it the visitor passes through a low opening  which has the appearance of having been once a doorway. Above this  entrance, on each side, in the wall, is a square hole, which  originally may have been the points of support of floor beams.  Formerly, likewise, there was a large square opening above the middle  passageway, but this has been closed with masonry, leaving in place  the wooden beam which once supported the wall above. The upper edge of  the front wall of inclosure _B_ is level, and is but little broken  except in two places, where there are notches, one above each of the  square holes already mentioned. It is probable that these depressions  were intended for the ends of the beams which once supported a  combined roof and floor.    On the perpendicular wall which forms the rear of inclosure _B_, many  feet above the top of the standing front walls, there are several  pictographs of Apache origin. The height of these above the level of  the former roof would appear to indicate the existence of a third  story, for the hands which drew them must have been at least 15 feet  above the present top of the standing wall.    The front of _C_ is curved like that of inclosure _B_, and is much  broken near the foundations, where there is a passageway. There is a  small hole on each side of a middle line, as in _B_, situated at about  the same level as the floor, indicating the former position of a beam.  Within the ruin there is a well-made partition separating inclosures  _B_ and _C_.    The size of room _D_ is much less than that of _B_ or _C_, but, with  the exception of a section at the left, the front wall has fallen. The  part which remains upright, however, stands like a pinnacle,  unconnected with the face of the cliff or with the second-story wall  of inclosure _C_. It is about 20 feet in height, and possibly its  altitude appears greater than it really is from the fact that its  foundations rest upon a bowlder nearly six feet high (plate CX).    The foundations of rooms _E_ and _F_ (plate C) are built on a lower  level than those of _B_ and _C_ or _D_, and their front walls, which  are really low, are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23692"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 1 (of 8) (#10)"],[1,"north. The farmers were too few to  reduce the natives to submission, though always able to defeat them  in the field, and, while they relished an expedition, they had an  invincible dislike to any protracted operations which cost money.  Taxes they would not pay. They lived in a sort of rude plenty among  their sheep and cattle, but they had hardly any coined money,  conducting their transactions by barter, and they were too rude to  value the benefits which government secures to a civilised people.\"      TRANSVAAL DISSENSIONS    Among other things an attempt was made on the part of the Boers to  annex the Orange Free State. President Pretorius crossed the Vaal in  1857, at the head of a large commando, with the intention of seizing  on the neighbouring territory. He was doomed to disappointment,  however, for his intended raid was stopped by the timely resistance  of the forewarned President of the Orange Free State. An encounter  was happily avoided through the intervention of Mr. Kruger, and  finally the two Republics decided to mutually recognise each other's  independent States.    But the ambitions of Pretorius merely smouldered. He still kept a  greedy eye on the Orange Free State, and machinated for the union of  the two States into a gigantic whole. He therefore refused the  Presidency of the Transvaal for that of the Free State, in the hope  of gathering into his own hands the reins of both governments. He  was again disappointed, however, and in 1864 he returned and was  re-elected President of the Transvaal.    The return of Pretorius was the signal for temporary peace. During  his second Presidency, however, the little rift within the lute--the  rift of insolvency, which eventually wrecked South African  independence--began to be observable.    Mr. Nixon, who took great pains to acquaint himself with the true  state of the country, says \"that the intestine disturbances and the  incessant Kaffir wars had well-nigh exhausted the finances of the  Republic. The exchequer was only tardily replenished under a loose  system of taxation. The Boers have never been good taxpayers, and no  Government has been able to enforce the proper payment of taxes due  to the State. A decade after its establishment the Republic was  practically insolvent. Even as early as 1857 the Government was  compelled to issue _mandaten_, or bills, wherewith to raise money to  buy ammunition, and to pay its servants. In 1866 a regular issue of  paper money was sanctioned by the Volksraad. This was followed by  further issues, until, in 1867, a Finance Commission found that  there were more notes in circulation than had been authorised by the  Volksraad. Nevertheless, the financial requirements of the State  became so pressing that still more issues had to be made, and in  1870 there were over L73,000 worth of notes in circulation. The  notes were declared a legal tender, but the Government were unable  to keep up their value by artificial methods. They fell to a low  ebb, and passed from hand to hand at a discount of about 75 per  cent, from their nominal value.\"    In 1867 occurred two events which served to change the whole  political and financial outlook of the Transvaal. Diamonds were  discovered in the district of Kimberley. Gold was unearthed in  Lydenburg. From that hour a procession of European miners began  slowly to march north from the Cape. A highway was opened up between  the two promising districts, and diggers of every race, pioneers  bent on the propagation of modern ideas, teachers, missionaries, and  traders of all kinds, attracted by the promise of wealth, flocked to  the scene and settled themselves among the trekkers.      ZULU DISTURBANCES    After this period, when, as stated before, small but promising  quantities of gold had been unearthed, it was no longer possible to  prevent parties of miners and speculators from trickling into the  Transvaal, to the annoyance of its inhabitants. Outside, too, there  were troubles, disputes, and skirmishes with the Zulus, and further  north was waged a fierce fight between the Boers and the chief of  the Bapedi, one Sekukuni, whose father had signed away his  independence to the Boers, and who refused in his turn to abide by  the conditions of the compact. In this fight Sekukuni was  successful, and the Boers, worsted and discontented, and believing  that the Almighty was displeased with them and with their President,  Mr. Burgers, retired from the campaign. At the same time, in the  south, Cetchwayo was itching to be on the warpath, and the general  state of affairs suggested a possible annihilation of the Transvaal  by an uncontrollable horde of natives. Things went from bad to  worse, and in October 1876 Lord Carnarvon remonstrated with the  President of the South African Republic regarding the unprovoked  barbarity of the Sekukuni war, which had again been renewed. The  reason for the interference of Lord Carnarvon is to be found in the  following despatch, forwarded by Sir Henry Barkly, the then Governor  of the Cape:--    \"As Von Schlickman has since fallen fighting bravely, it is not  without reluctance that I join in affixing this dark stain on his  memory, but truth compels me to add the following extract from a  letter which I have since received from one whose name (which I  communicate to your lordship privately) forbids disbelief:--    \"'There is no longer the slightest doubt as to the murder of the two  women and the child at Steelpoort by the direct order of Schlickman,  and in the attack on the kraal near which these women were captured  (or some attack about that period) he ordered his men to cut the  throats of all the wounded! This is no mere report; it is  positively true.\" And in a subsequent letter the same writer informs  me that the statements are based on the evidence, not alone of  Kaffirs, but of whites who were present.    \"'As regards the even more serious accusations brought against Abel  Erasmus' (the Kruger's Post field-cornet), 'as specially alluded to  in my letter to President Burgers, on the 28th ult.' (viz. of  treacherously killing forty or fifty friendly natives, men and  women, and carrying off the children), I beg to invite your  lordship's attention to an account derived, I am assured, from a  respectable Boer who accompanied the expedition, and protested  against the slaughter and robbery of friendly Kaffirs, committed by  order of the above-named field-cornet.    \"'Should I not shortly receive such a reply from the President to my  letters of last month, as to convince me that his Honour has taken  effectual steps to check such outrages and punish the perpetrators,  I will enter another protest, if only for form's sake.    \"'Seeing, however, that Aylward, who is said to boast, whether truly  or not, that he took part with his brother Fenians in the murder of  the police constable at Manchester, as well as in the attempt to  blow up the Clerkenwell prison, had succeeded Schlickman in the  command of the Steelpoort Volunteers, I question whether the  Government of the South African Republic has the power, even  supposing it to have the will, to put a stop to further atrocities  on the part of this band of \"Filibusters,\" as they are commonly  styled in the newspapers.    \"'In my opinion it will be requisite to call in the aid of British  troops before this can be done, and I am not without hope that one  of the results of the mission on which Sir T. Shepstone is about to  start, will be a petition from persons of education and property  throughout the country for such an intervention on the part of her  Majesty's Government as will terminate this wanton and useless  bloodshed, and prevent the recurrence of the scenes of injustice,  cruelty, and rapine, which abundant evidence is every day  forthcoming to prove, have rarely ceased to disgrace the Republics  beyond the Vaal ever since they first sprang into existence.'\"    Von Schlickman was an ex-Russian officer, commanding a force of  filibusters which had been engaged by the Transvaal Government, and  his men being unpaid, were allowed to reimburse themselves by cattle  or land seized from the natives.    As a natural consequence, the war assumed a character of  unrestrained ferocity. On receiving this information Lord Carnarvon  wrote that his Government \"could not view passively, and with  indifference, the engagement of the Republic in foreign military  operations the object or the necessity of which had not been made  apparent.\"    The quarrel with the chief had originated, as stated, in a Boer  claim to his land, and the Boer President in replying urged the  natural right of the Boers to all the land of the Transvaal. The  chief magistrate at that time was President Burgers, a man who, if  report may be believed, was far superior to those with whom he  associated. This man, a Cape Dutchman, and sometime minister of the  Reformed Church, had been called to the onerous post of President of  the South African Republic in 1872. He was bent on the advancement  of his nation, and his intelligence was remarkable. He was a man of  sterling character, fanciful, enthusiastic, an idealist even, with a  horror of slaveholding, and a hankering for the pure life of the  humanist. In a measure he was too much in advance of the people with  whom he was connected. To them he was something of a Freethinker, a  man too ready to judge for himself while the Gospel was at hand to  judge for him. Such liberal views were not in accord with peasant  limitations. His desire to raise his country to the level of other  nations, to bring commerce and railways within touch of his people,  savoured of heresy. The appreciation for civilisation was so strong  within him that he is even said to have carried it to extremes, to  have favoured the prompt and regular payment of taxes, and to have  executed an elaborate design for an international coat-of-arms! Now  this reformer, like most reformers, was not "]]]
