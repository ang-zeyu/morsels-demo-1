The Captain gives the command FRONT.    [Illustration]    Being in line, to form column of platoons, or the reverse: 1. Platoons  right (left), 2. MARCH, 3. Company, 4. HALT; or, 3. Forward, 4. MARCH.    [Illustration]    Executed by each platoon as described for the company.    Before forming line the captain sees that the guides on the flank toward  which the movement is to be executed are covering. This is effected by  previously announcing the guide to that flank.    The two common errors are: 1. First, the pivot man takes a short step  instead of marking time. Second, (being in line), the pivot men of the  platoons forget that they are the pivots and therefore do not execute  the command when ordered.    [Illustration]    The following illustration shows the side view of a platoon. Note the  common errors: No. 1 rear rank is closed up to about twenty inches. He  is looking down at the heels of his front rank file (man). Rifles are  improperly held. Some men in the rear rank have more than forty inches  distance from their front rank men.    Being in line, to form column of squads, or the reverse; or, being in  line of platoons, to form column of platoons, or the reverse: 1. Squads  right (left), 2. MARCH; or, 1. Squads right (left), 2. MARCH, 3.  Company, 4. HALT.    Executed by each squad as described in the School of the Squad.    [Illustration]    If the company or platoons be formed in line toward the side of the file  closers they dart through the column and take posts in rear of the  company at the second command. If the column of squads be formed from  line, the file closers take posts on the pivot flank, abreast of and 4  inches from the nearest flank.    Being in column of platoons, to change direction: 1. Column right  (left), 2. MARCH.    At the first command the leader of the leading platoon commands: Right  turn. At the command march the leading platoon turns to the right on  moving pivot; its leader commands: Forward, 2. MARCH, on completion of  the turn. Rear platoons march squarely up to the turning point of the  leading platoon and turn at the command of their leaders. When each  platoon has completed its turn, the leader commands forward, MARCH.    [Illustration]    Being in column of squads, to form line of platoons or the reverse: 1.  Platoons, column right (left), 2. MARCH.    Executed by each platoon as described for the company.    Being in line, to form column of squads and then change direction. 1.  Squads left (right), column right (left), 2. MARCH.    [Illustration: The dotted line shows the company in line before the new  movement is begun.    This shows the movement half completed.]    The left squad initiates (begins) The column right as soon as it has  completed the squad left.]    Being in line, to form line of platoons: 1. Squads left (right),  platoons, column left (right), 2.    [Illustration: LINE OF PLATOONS]    MARCH; or, 1. Platoons, right (left) by squads, 2. MARCH.    Executed by each platoon as described for the company in the preceding  paragraph.        FACING OR MARCHING TO THE REAR      Being in line, line of platoons, or in column of platoons or squads, to  face or march to the rear: 1. Squads right (left) about, 2. MARCH; or,  1. Squads right (left) about, 2. MARCH, 3. Company, 4. HALT.    Executed by each squad as described in the School of the Squad.    If the company is in line of platoons, or in column of squads, the file  closers turn about toward the column, and take their posts; if in line,  each darts through the nearest interval between squads.    To march to the rear for a few paces: 1. About, 2. FACE, 3. Forward, 4.  MARCH.    If in line, the guides place themselves in the rear rank, now in front  rank; the file closers, on facing about, maintain their relative  positions. No other movement is executed until the line is faced to the  original front.    Being in column of squads to form column of platoons, or being in line  of platoons, to form the company in line: 1. Platoons, right (left)  front into line, 2. MARCH, 3. Company, 4. HALT, 5. FRONT.    Executed by each platoon as described for the company. If forming column  of platoons, platoon leaders verify the alignment before taking their  posts; the captain commands front when the alignments have been  verified.    When front into line is executed in double time the commands for  halting and aligning are omitted and the guide is toward the side of the  first unit in line.        ROUTE STEP AND AT EASE      The column of squads is the habitual column of route, but route step  and at ease are applicable to any marching formation.    To march at route step: 1. Route step, 2. MARCH. Sabers are carried at  will or in the scabbard; the men carry their pieces at will, keeping the  muzzles elevated; they are not required to preserve silence, nor to keep  the step. The ranks cover and preserve their distance. If halted from  route step, the men stand at rest.    To march at ease: 1. At ease, 2. MARCH.    The company marches as in route step, except that silence is preserved  when hated, the men remain at ease.    Marching at route step or at ease: 1. Company, 2. ATTENTION.    At the command attention the pieces are brought to the right shoulder  and the cadenced step in quick time is resumed.        RULES FOR GUIDES      A guide is a noncommissioned officer or a private upon whom the company  regulates its march.    It is not difficult for an inexperienced man learn, with a little  practice, the duties and the correct positions of a guide. Remember the  rule of thumb, The guide and the file closers are on the opposite  flanks when the company is in column of squads. In squads right about  it would be ridiculous for the file closers to move from one flank to  another. Guides are permitted and supposed look around to see if they  are in their proper places; most new men are timid about this.    The following general rules and examples will help you:    The guide of a company or platoon in line is right, unless otherwise  announced.    The guide of a company or platoon in column of squads is toward the side  of the guide, who places himself on the side of the company away from  the file closers.    The guide of a deployed line (a skirmish line) is always center unless  otherwise announced.      EXAMPLES    Suppose the company to be in line.    In executing:        1. Squads right. The guides go to the left flank.        2. Right by squads. The guides go to the left flank.        3. Squads left. The guides go to the right flank.        4. Left by squads. The guides go to the right flank.    If the company is in column of squads and the command is either squads  right or left about, the guides simply remember to remain on the flank  opposite from the file closers. It is very easy to see that a world of  confusion would be caused by the file closers attempting to move to the  opposite flank during squads right or left about. If the guides are in  doubt look to see where the file closers are and then apply the rule of  thumb: File closers and guides are always on opposite flanks.      TO DIMINISH THE FRONT OF A COLUMN OF SQUADS    Being in column of squads: 1. Right (left) by twos, 2. MARCH.    At the command march all files except the two right files on the leading  squad execute \"in Place Halt\"; the two left files of the leading squads  oblique to the right when disengaged and follow the right files at the  shortest practicable distance. The remaining squads follow successively  in like manner.    Being in column of squads or twos:    1. Right (left) by file, 2. MARCH.    At the command march, all files execute \"In Place Halt,\" except the  right file of the leading two or squad. The left file or files of the  leading two or squad oblique successively to the right when disengaged  and each follows the file on its right at the shortest practicable  distance. The remaining twos or squads follow successively in like  manner.    [Illustration: RIGHT BY TWOS]    Being in column of files or twos, to form column of squads; or, being in  column of files, to form column of twos: 1. Squads (twos), right (left)  front into line, 2. MARCH.    At the command march, the leading file or files halt and come to order  arms. The remainder of the squad, or twos, obliques to the right and  halts on line with the leading file or files. The remaining squads or  twos close up and successively form in rear of the first in like manner.    The movement described in this paragraph will be ordered right or left,  so as to restore the files to their normal relative positions in column  of twos or in column of squads.    [Illustration: RIGHT BY FILE]    The movements prescribed in the three preceding paragraphs are difficult  of execution at attention and have no value as disciplinary exercises.    [Illustration: Executing twos left front into line.    Executing squads left front into line.]    Marching by twos or files can not be executed without serious delay and  waste of road space. Every reasonable precaution will be taken to  obviate the necessity for these formations.    The remainder of chapter on close order drill, School of the Company,  is in general for those above the grade of private, therefore, unless we  are perfectly clear in what we have had so far, let us not go too deeply  into these special features until we have more experience.    The captain is responsible for the theoretical and practical instruction  of his officers and noncommissioned officers, not only in the duties of  their respective grades, but in those of the next higher grades.    If the left squad contains less than six men, it is either increased to  that number by transfers from other squads or is broken up and its  members assigned to other squads and posted in the line of file closers.  These squad organizations are maintained, by transfers if"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19560"],[0,"Applied Eugenics (#10)"],[1,"most popular writers are  confused. Let us examine it through a hypothetical case. A woman, not  herself strong, bears a child that is weak. The woman then goes in for  athletics, in order better to fit herself for motherhood; she  specializes on tennis. After a few years she bears another child, which  is much stronger and better developed than the first. \"Look,\" some one  will say, \"how the mother has transmitted her acquirement to her  offspring.\" We grant that her improved general health will probably  result in a child that is better nourished than the first; but that is a  very different thing from heredity. If, however, the mother had played  tennis until her right arm was over-developed, and her spine bent; if  these characteristics were nowhere present in the ancestry and not seen  in the first child; but if the second child were born with a bent spine  and a right arm of exaggerated musculature, we would be willing to  consider the case on the basis of the inheritance of an acquired  character. We are not likely to have such a case presented to us.    To put the matter more generally, it is not enough to show that _some_  modification in the parent results in _some_ modification in the child.  For the purposes of this argument there must be a similar modification.    (8) Finally, data are frequently presented, which cover only two  generations--parent and child. Indeed, almost all the data alleged to  show the inheritance of acquired characteristics are of this kind. They  are of little or no value as evidence. Cases covering a number of  generations, where a _cumulative_ change was visible, would be of  weight, but on the rare occasions when they are forthcoming, they can be  explained in some other way more satisfactorily than by an appeal to the  theory of Lamarck.[13]    If the evidence currently offered to support a belief in the inheritance  of acquired characters is tested by the application of these  \"misunderstandings,\" it will at once be found that most of it  disappears; that it can be thrown out of court without further  formality. The Lamarckian doctrine is now held mainly by persons who  have either lacked training in the evaluation of evidence, or have never  examined critically the assumptions on which they proceed. Medical men  and breeders of plants or animals are to a large extent believers in  Lamarckism, but the evidence (if any) on which they rely is always  susceptible of explanation in a more reasonable way. It must not be  forgotten that some of the ablest intellects in the world have been  assidously engaged in getting at the truth in the case, during the last  half-century; and it is certainly worthy of consideration that not in a  single case has the transmission of an acquired body character ever  been proved beyond dispute. Those who still hold a belief in it (and it  is fair to say that some men of real ability are among that number) too  often do so, it is to be feared, because it is necessary for the support  of some theoretical doctrine which they have formulated. Certainly there  are few men who can say that they have carefully examined the evidence  in the case, and accept Lamarckism because the evidence forces them to  do so. It will be interesting to review the various classes of alleged  evidence, though we can cite only a few cases from the great number  available (most of them, however, dealing with plants or lower animals).    Nearly all the evidence adduced can be put in one of these four classes:      (1)  Mutilations.    (2)  Diseases.    (3)  Results of use or disuse.    (4)  Physico-chemical effects of environment.    The case in regard to mutilations is particularly clear cut and leaves  little room for doubt. The noses and ears of oriental women have been  pierced for generations without number, yet girls are still born with  these parts entire. Circumcision offers another test case. The evidence  of laboratory experiments (amputation of tails) shows no inheritance. It  may be said without hesitation that mutilations are not heritable, no  matter how many generations undergo them.    (2) The transmissibility of acquired diseases is a question involved in  more of a haze of ignorance and loose thinking. It is particularly  frequent to see cases of uterine infection offered as cases of the  inheritance of acquired characters. To use the word \"heredity\" in such a  case is unjustified. Uterine infection has no bearing whatever on the  question.    Taking an historical view, it seems fairly evident that if diseases were  really inherited, the race would have been extinct long ago. Of course  there are constitutional defects or abnormalities that are in the  germ-plasm and are heritable: such is the peculiar inability of the  blood to coagulate, which marks \"bleeders\" (sufferers from hemophilia, a  highly hereditary disease). And in many cases it is difficult to  distinguish between a real germinal condition of this sort, and an  acquired disease.    The inheritance of an acquired disease is not only inconceivable, in the  light of what is known about the germ-plasm, but there is no evidence to  support it. While there is most decidedly such a thing as the  inheritance of a tendency to or lack of resistance to a disease, it is  not the result of incidence of the disease on the parent. It is possible  to inherit a tendency to headaches or to chronic alcoholism; and it is  possible to inherit a lack of resistance to common diseases such as  malaria, small-pox or measles; but actually to inherit a zymotic disease  as an inherent genetic trait, is impossible,--is, in fact, a  contradiction of terms.    (3) When we come to the effects of use and disuse, we reach a much  debated ground, and one complicated by the injection of a great deal of  biological theorizing, as well as the presence of the usual large amount  of faulty observation and inference.    It will be admitted by every one that a part of the body which is much  used tends to increase in size, or strength, and similarly that a part  which is not used tends to atrophy. It is further found that such  changes are progressive in the race, in many cases. Man's brain has  steadily increased in size, as he used it more and more; on the other  hand, his canine teeth have grown smaller. Can this be regarded as the  inheritance of a long continued process of use and disuse? Such a view  is often taken, but the Lamarckian doctrine seems to us just as mystical  here as anywhere else, and no more necessary. Progressive changes can be  satisfactorily accounted for by natural selection; retrogressive changes  are susceptible of explanation along similar lines. When an organ is no  longer necessary, as the hind legs of a whale, for instance, natural  selection no longer keeps it at the point of perfection. Variation,  however, continues to occur in it. Since the organ is now useless,  natural selection will no longer restrain variation in such an organ,  and degeneracy will naturally follow, for of all the variations that  occur in the organ, those tending to loss are more numerous than those  tending to addition. If the embryonic development of a whale's hind leg  be compared to some complicated mechanical process, such as the  manufacture of a typewriter, it will be easier to realize that a trivial  variation which affected one of the first stages of the process would  alter all succeeding stages and ruin the final perfection of the  machine. It appears, then, that progressive degeneration of an organ can  be adequately explained by variation with the removal of natural  selection, and that it is not necessary or desirable to appeal to any  Lamarckian factor of an unexplainable and undemonstrable nature.    The situation remains the same, when purely mental processes, such as  instincts, are considered. Habit often repeated becomes instinctive, it  is said; and then the instinct thus formed by the individual is passed  on to his descendants and becomes in the end a racial instinct. Most  psychologists have now abandoned this view, which receives no support  from investigation. Such prevalence as it still retains seems to be  largely due to a confusion of thought brought about by the use of the  word \"instinctive\" in two different senses,--first literally and then  figuratively.    A persistent attempt has been made in America during recent years, by  C. L. Redfield, a Chicago engineer, to rehabilitate the theory of the  inheritance of the effects of use and disuse. He has presented it in a  way that, to one ignorant of biology, appears very exact and plausible;  but his evidence is defective and his interpretation of his evidence  fallacious. Because of the widespread publicity, Mr. Redfield's work has  received, we discuss it further in Appendix B.    Since the importance of hormones (internal secretions) in the body  became known, it has often been suggested that their action may furnish  the clue to some sort of an inheritance of modifications. The hormone  might conceivably modify the germ-plasm but if so, it would more likely  be in some wholly different way.    In general, we may confidently say that there is neither theoretical  necessity nor adequate experimental proof for belief that the results of  use and disuse are inherited.    (4) When we come to consider whether the effects of the environment are  inherited, we attack a stronghold of sociologists and historians.  Herbert Spencer thought one of the strongest pieces of evidence in this  category was to be found in the assimilation of foreigners in the United  States. \"The descendants of the immigrant Irish,\" he pointed out, \"lose  their Celtic aspect and become Americanised.... To say that 'spontaneous  variation,' increased by natural selection, can have produced this  effect, is going too far.\" Unfortunately for Mr. Spencer, he was basing  his conclusions on guesswork. It is only within the last few months that  the first trustworthy evidence "]]]
