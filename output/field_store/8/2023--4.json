Round about him there seemed a press and  throng of knights, and the eagles in the gold above him to the  sight were moving in the wind. The wretched woman among all these  seemed to be saying, \"Lord, do vengeance for me for my son who is  slain, whereat I am broken-hearted.\" And he to answer her, \"Now  wait till I return;\" and she, \"My Lord,\"--like one in whom grief  is hasty,--\"if thou return not?\" And he, \"He who shall be where I  am will do it for thee.\" And she, \"What will the good deed of  another be to thee if thou art mindless of thine own?\" Whereon  he, \"Now comfort thee; for it behoves that I discharge my own  duty ere I go; justice requires it, and pity constrains me.\" He  who hath never seen new thing [2] had produced that visible  speech, novel to us, since on earth it is not found.    [1] This legend of Trajan had great vogue during the Middle Ages.  It was believed that Pope Gregory the Great interceded for him,  praying that he might be delivered from Hell; \"then God because  of these prayers drew that soul from pain and put it into glory.\"  This was Gregory's great victory. See Paradise, XX., p. 131.    [2] God, to whom nothing can be new.      While I was delighting me with regarding the images of such great  humilities, and for their Maker's sake dear to behold, \"Lo, on  this side many people, but they make few steps,\" murmured the  Poet. \"They will put us on the way to the high stairs.\" My eyes  that were intent on looking in order to see novelties whereof  they are fain, in turning toward him were not slow.    I would not, indeed, Reader, that thou be dismayed at thy good  purpose, through hearing how God wills that the debt be paid.  Attend not to the form of the suffering; think on what follows;  think that at worst beyond the Great Judgment it cannot go!    I began, \"Master, that which I see moving toward us, seems to me  not persons, but what I know not, my look is so in vain.\" And he  to me, \"The heavy condition of their torment so presses them to  earth, that mine own eyes at first had contention with it. But  look fixedly there, and disentangle with thy sight that which  cometh beneath those stones; now thou canst discern how each is  smitten.\"    O proud Christians, wretched weary ones, who, diseased in vision  of the mind, have confidence in backward steps, are ye not aware  that we are worms born to form the angelic butterfly which flies  unto judgment without defence? Why doth your mind float up aloft,  since ye are as it were defective insects, even as a worm in  which formation fails?    As sometimes for support of ceiling or roof, by way of corbel, a  figure is seen joining its knees to its breast, which out of its  unreality makes a real pang rise in him who sees it, thus  fashioned saw I these when I gave good heed. True it is that they  were more or less contracted according as they had more or less  upon their backs; and he who had most patience in his looks,  weeping, appeared to say, \"I can no more.\"        CANTO XI. First Ledge: the Proud.--Prayer.--Omberto  Aldobrandeschi.--Oderisi d' Agubbio.--Provinzan Salvani.      \"O our Father who art in Heaven, not circumscribed, but through  the greater love which to the first effects on high Thou hast,[1]  praised be Thy name and Thy power by every creature, even as it  is befitting to render thanks to Thy sweet effluence. May the  peace of Thy Kingdom come towards us, for we to it cannot of  ourselves, if it come not, with all our striving. As of their  will Thine angels, singing Hosanna, make sacrifice to Thee, so  may men make of theirs. Give us this day the daily manna, without  which through this rough desert he backward goes, who toils most  to go on. And as we pardon every one for the wrong that we have  suffered, even do Thou, benignant, pardon and regard not our  desert. Our virtue which is easily overcome put not to proof with  the old adversary, but deliver from him who so spurs it. This  last prayer, dear Lord, truly is not made for ourselves, for it  is not needful, but for those who behind us have remained.\"    [1] Not circumscribed by Heaven, but having Thy seat there  because of the love Thou bearest to the first effects --the  angels, and the heavens--of Thyself the First Cause.      Thus praying for themselves and us good speed, those souls were  going under the weight, like that of which one sometimes dreams,  unequally in anguish, all of them round and round, and weary,  along the first cornice, purging away the mists of the world. If  good they ask for us always there, what can here be said and done  for them by those who have a good root for their will? Truly we  ought to aid them to wash away the marks which they bore hence,  so that pure and light they may go forth unto the starry wheels.    \"Ah! so may justice and pity unburden you speedily that ye may be  able to move the wing, which according to your desire may lift  you, show on which hand is the shortest way towards the stair;  and if there is more than one pass, point out to us that which  least steeply slopes; for this man who comes with me, because of  the load of the flesh of Adam wherewith he is clothed, is chary  against his will of mounting up.\" It was not manifest from whom  came the words which they returned to these that he whom I was  following had spoken, but it was said, \"To the right hand along  the bank come ye with us, and ye will find the pass possible for  a living person to ascend. And if I were not hindered by the  stone which tames my proud neck, wherefore I needs must carry my  face low, I would look at that one who is still alive and is not  named, to see if I know him, and to make him pitiful of this  burden. I was Italian, and born of a great Tuscan; Guglielmo  Aldobrandesco was my father: I know not if his name was ever with  you.[1] The ancient blood and the gallant deeds of my ancestors  made me so arrogant that, not thinking on the common mother, I  held every man in scorn to such extreme that I died therefor, as  the Sienese know, and every child in Campagnatico knows it. I am  Omberto: and not only unto me Pride doth harm, for all my  kinsfolk bath she dragged with her into calamity; and here must I  heap this weight on her account till God be satisfied,--here  among the dead, since I did it not among the living.\"    [1] The Aldobrandeschi were the counts of Santa Fiore (see Canto  VI.) in the Sienese Maremma. Little is known of them, but that  they were in constant feud with Siena. The one who speaks was  murdered in his own stronghold of Campagnatico, in 1259.      Listening, I bent down my face; and one of them, not he who was  speaking, twisted himself under the weight that hampers him; and  he saw me, and recognized me and called out, keeping his eyes  with effort fixed on me, who was going along all stooping with  him.[1] \"Oh,\" said I to him, \"art thou not Oderisi, the honor of  Gubbio, and the honor of that art which in Paris is called  illumination?\" \"Brother,\" said he, \"more smiling are the leaves  that Franco of Bologna pencils; the honor is now all his, and  mine in part.[2] Truly I should not have been so courteous while  I lived, because of the great desire of excelling whereon my  heart was intent. Of such pride here is paid the fee; and yet I  should not be here, were it not that, still having power to sin,  I turned me unto God. Oh vainglory of human powers! how little  lasts the green upon the top, if it be not followed by dull  ages.[3] Cimabue thought to hold the field in painting, and now  Giotto has the cry, so that the fame of him is obscured. In like  manner one Guido hath taken from the other the glory of the  language; and he perhaps is born who shall drive both one and the  other from the nest.[4] Worldly renown is naught but a breath of  wind, which now comes hence and now comes thence, and changes  name because it changes quarter. What more fame shalt thou have,  if thou strippest old flesh from thee, than if thou hadst died  ere thou hadst left the pap and the chink,[5] before a thousand  years have passed?--which is a shorter space compared to the  eternal than a movement of the eyelids to the circle that is  slowest turned in Heaven. With him who takes so little of the  road in front of me, all Tuscany resounded, and now he scarce is  lisped of in Siena, where he was lord when the Florentine rage  was destroyed,[6] which at that time was proud, as now it is  prostitute. Your reputation is color of grass that comes and  goes, and he[7] discolors it through whom it came up fresh from  the earth.\" And I to him, \"Thy true speech brings good humility  to my heart, and thou allayest a great swelling in me; but who is  he of whom thou now wast speaking?\" \"He is,\" he answered,  \"Provinzan Salvani;[8] and he is here, because he was  presumptuous in bringing all Siena to his hands. He has gone  thus--and he goes without repose--ever since he died: such money  doth he pay in satisfaction, who is on earth too daring.\" And I,  \"If that spirit who awaits the verge of life ere he repents  abides there below, and unless good prayer further him ascends  not hither, ere as much time pass us he lived, how has this  coining been granted unto him?\" \"When he was living most  renowned,\" said he, \"laying aside all shame, of his own accord he  planted himself in the Campo of Siena,[9] and there, to draw his  friend from the punishment he was enduring in the prison of  Charles, brought himself to tremble in every vein. More I will  not say, and I know that I speak darkly; but little time will  pass, before thy neighbors will so act that thou wilt he able to  gloss it.[10] This deed released him from those limits.\"[11]    [1] This stooping is the symbol of Dante's consciousness of pride  as his own besetting sin.

O insensate care of mortals, how defective are those syllogisms  which make thee downward beat thy wings! One was going after the  Laws, and one after the Aphorisms,[1] and one following the  priesthood, and one to reign by force or by sophisms, and one to  rob, and one to civic business; one, involved in pleasure of the  flesh, was wearying himself, and one was giving himself to  idleness, when I, loosed from all these things, with Beatrice,  was thus gloriously received on high in Heaven.    [1] The Aphorisms of Hippocrates, meaning here, the study of  medicine.      When each[1] had returned unto that point of the circle at which  it was at first, it stayed, as a candle in a candlestick. And  within that light which first had spoken to me I heard, as  smiling it began, making itself more clear, \"Even as I am  resplendent with its radiance, so, looking into the Eternal  Light, I apprehend whence thou drawest the occasion of thy  thoughts. Thou art perplexed, and hast the wish that my speech be  bolted again in language so open and so plain that it may be  level to thy sense, where just now I said, 'where well one  fattens,' and there where I said, 'the second has not been born;'  and here is need that one distinguish well.

Beatrice and Dante.      \"The Providence which governs the world with that counsel, in  which every created vision is vanquished ere it reach the depth,  in order that the bride[1] of Him, who with loud cries espoused  her with His blessed blood, might go toward her beloved, secure  in herself and also more faithful to Him, ordained two princes in  her favor, who on this side and that should be to her for guides.  The one was all seraphic in ardor,[2] the other, through wisdom,  was a splendor of cherubic light[3] on earth. Of the one I will  speak, because both are spoken of in praising one, whichever be  taken, for unto one end were their works.    [1] The Church.    [2] St. Francis of Assisi    [3] St. Dominic.    \"Between the Tupino and the water[1] which descends from the  hill chosen by the blessed Ubaldo, hangs the fertile slope of a  high mountain, wherefrom Perugia at Porta Sole[2] feeleth cold  and heat, while behind it Nocera and Gualdo weep because of their  heavy yoke.[3] On that slope, where it most breaks its steepness,  rose a Sun upon the world, as this one sometimes does from the  Ganges. Therefore let him who talks of that place not say  Ascesi,[4] for he would speak short, but Orient,[5] if be would  speak properly. He was not yet very far from his rising when he  began to make the earth feel some comfort from his great virtue.  For, still a youth, he ran to strife[6] with his father for a  lady such as unto whom, even as unto death, no one unlocks the  gate of pleasure; and before his spiritual court et coram  patre[7] to her he had himself united; thereafter from day to day  he loved her more ardently. She, deprived of her first  husband,[8] for one thousand and one hundred years and more,  despised and obscure, had stood without wooing till he came;[9]  nor had it availed[10] to hear, that he, who caused fear to all  the world, found her at the sound of his voice secure with  Amyclas;[11] nor had it availed to have been constant and bold,  so that where Mary remained below, she wept with Christ upon the  cross. But that I may not proceed too obscurely, take henceforth  in my diffuse speech Francis and Poverty for these lovers. Their  concord and their glad semblances made love, and wonder, and  sweet regard to be the cause of holy thoughts;[12] so that the  venerable Bernard first bared his feet,[13] and ran following  such great peace, and, running, it seemed to him that he was  slow. Oh unknown riches! oh fertile good! Egidius bares his feet  and Sylvester bares his feet, following the bridegroom; so  pleasing is the bride. Then that father and that master goes on  his way with his lady, and with that family which the humble cord  was now girding.[14] Nor did baseness of heart weigh down his  brow at being son of Pietro Bernardone,[15] nor at appearing  marvellously despised; but royally he opened his bard intention  to Innocent, and received from bim the first seal for his  Order.[16] After the poor people had increased behind him, whose  marvellous life would be better sung in glory of the heavens, the  holy purpose of this archimandrite[17] was adorned with a second  crown by the Eternal Spirit, through Honorius.[18] And when,  through thirst for martyrdom, he had preached Christ and the rest  who followed him in the proud presence of the Sultan,[19] and  because he found the people too unripe for conversion, and in  order not to stay in vain, had returned to the fruit of the  Italian grass,[20] on the rude rock,[21] between the Tiber and  the Arno, he took from Christ the last seal,[22] which his limbs  bore for two years. When it pleased Him, who had allotted him to  such great good, to draw him up to the reward which he had gained  in making himself abject, he commended his most dear lady to his  brethren as to rightful heirs, and commanded them to love her  faithfully; and from her lap, his illustrious soul willed to  depart, returning to its realm, and for his body he willed no  other bier.[23]    [1] The Chiassi, which flows from the hill chosen for his  hermitage by St. Ubaldo.

[5] As the sun at the vernal equinox, the sacred season of the  Creation and the Resurrection, rises in the due east or orient,  represented in the geographical system of the time by the Ganges,  so the place where this new Sun of righteousness arose should be  called Orient.
