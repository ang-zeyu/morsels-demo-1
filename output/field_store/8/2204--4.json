IT'S ALL RIGHT!\"    Then Bruce understood at last that he was to stay in this place of  abominations, far from everything he loved; and that he must do so  because the Master ordained it. He made no further effort to break away  and to follow his god ashore. But he shivered convulsively from head to  foot; and his desolate gaze continued to trace the Master's receding  figure out of sight. Then, with a long sigh, he lay down, heavily, his  head between his white forepaws, and resigned himself to whatever of  future misery his deities might have ordained for him.    Ensued a fortnight of mental and bodily anguish, as the inland-reared  dog tasted the horrors of a voyage in a rolling ship, through heaving  seas. Afterward, came the landing at a British port and the train ride  to the camp which was to be his home for the next three months.    Bruce's sense of smell told him the camp contained more dogs than ever  he had beheld in all his brief life put together. But his hearing would  have led him to believe there were not a dozen other dogs within a mile  of him.    From the encampment arose none of the rackety barking which betokens  the presence of many canines, and which deafens visitors to a dog-show.    One of the camp's first and most stringent rules forbade barking,  except under special order. These dogs--or the pick of them--were  destined for work at the front. The bark of a dog has a carrying  quality greater than the combined shouting of ten men. It is the last  sound to follow a balloonist, after he has risen above the reach of all  other earth-noises.    Hence, a chance bark, rising through the night to where some enemy  airman soared with engines turned off, might well lead to the bombing  of hitherto unlocated trenches or detachment-camps. For this and divers  other reasons, the first lesson taught to arriving wardogs was to  abstain from barking.    The dogs were divided, roughly, by breeds, as regarded the line of  training assigned to them. The collies were taught courier-work. The  Airedales, too,--hideous, cruel, snake-headed,--were used as couriers,  as well as to bear Red Cross supplies and to hunt for the wounded. The  gaunt and wolflike police dogs were pressed into the two latter tasks,  and were taught listening-post duty. And so on through all available  breeds,--including the stolidly wise Old English sheepdogs who were to  prove invaluable in finding and succoring and reporting the  wounded,--down to the humble terriers and mongrels who were taught to  rid trenches of vermin.    Everywhere was quiet efficiency and tirelessly patient and skillful  work on the part of the trainers. For Britain's best dog men had been  recruited for service here. On the perfection of their charges'  training might depend the fate of many thousand gallant soldiers.  Wherefore, the training was perfect.    Hundreds of dogs proved stupid or unreliable or gun-shy or too easily  confused in moments of stress. These were weeded out, continually, and  shipped back to the masters who had proffered them.    Others developed with amazing speed and cleverness, grasping their  profession as could few human soldiers. And Bruce, lonely and  heartsore, yet throwing himself into his labors with all the zest of  the best thoroughbred type,--was one of this group.    His early teachings now stood him in good stead. What once had been a  jolly game, for his own amusement and that of the Mistress and the  Master, was now his life-work. Steadily his trainer wrought over him,  bringing out latent abilities that would have dumfounded his earliest  teachers, steadying and directing the gayly dashing intelligence;  upbuilding and rounding out all his native gifts.    A dog of Bruce's rare type made up to the trainers for the dullness of  their average pupils. He learned with bewildering ease. He never forgot  a lesson once taught.    No, the Mistress need not have interceded to save him from beating. As  soon would an impresario think of thrashing Caruso or Paderewski as  would Bruce's glum Scottish trainer have laid whip to this best pupil  of his. Life was bare and strict for Bruce. But life was never unkind  to him, in these first months of exile from The Place. And, bit by bit,  he began to take a joy in his work.    Not for a day,--perhaps not for an hour, did the big collie forget the  home of his babyhood or those he had delighted to worship, there. And  the look of sadness in his dark eyes became a settled aspect. Yet,  here, there was much to interest and to excite him. And he grew to look  forward with pleasure to his daily lessons.    At the end of three months, he was shipped to France. There his  seemingly aimless studies at the training camp were put to active use.          *      *      *      *      *    At the foot of the long Flanders hill-slope the \"Here-We-Come\"  Regiment, of mixed American and French infantry, held a  caterpillar-shaped line of trenches.    To the right, a few hundred yards away, was posted a Lancashire  regiment, supported by a battalion from Cornwall. On the left were two  French regiments. In front, facing the hill-slope and not a half-mile  distant, was the geometric arrangement of sandbags that marked the  contour of the German first-line trenches.    The hill behind them, the boches in front of them, French and British  troops on either side of them--the Here-We-Comes were helping to defend  what was known as a \"quiet\" sector. Behind the hill, and on loftier  heights far to the rear, the Allied artillery was posted. Somewhere in  the same general locality lay a division of British reserves.    It is almost a waste of words to have described thus the surroundings  of the Here-We-Comes. For, with no warning at all, those entire  surroundings were about to be changed.    Ludendorff and his little playmates were just then engaged in the  congenial sport of delivering unexpected blows at various successive  points of the Allied line, in an effort to find some spot that was soft  enough to cave in under the impact and let through a horde of gray-clad  Huns. And though none of the defenders knew it, this \"quiet\" sector had  been chosen for such a minor blow.    The men in higher command, back there behind the hill crest, had a  belated inkling, though, of a proposed attack on the lightly defended  front trenches. For the Allied airplanes which drifted in the upper  heavens like a scattered handful of dragon-flies were not drifting  there aimlessly. They were the eyes of the snakelike columns that  crawled so blindly on the scarred brown surface of the earth. And those  \"eyes\" had discerned the massing of a force behind the German line had  discerned and had duly reported it.    The attack might come in a day. It might not come in a week. But it was  coming--unless the behind-the-lines preparations were a gigantic feint.    A quiet dawn, in the quiet trenches of the quiet sector. Desultory  artillery and somewhat less desultory sniping had prevailed throughout  the night, and at daybreak; but nothing out of the ordinary.    Two men on listening-post had been shot; and so had an overcurious  sentry who peeped just an inch too far above a parapet. A shell had  burst in a trench, knocking the telephone connection out of gear and  half burying a squad of sleepers under a lot of earth. Otherwise,  things were drowsily dull.    In a dugout sprawled Top-Sergeant Mahan,--formerly of Uncle Sam's  regular army, playing an uninspiring game of poker with Sergeant Dale  of his company and Sergeant Vivier of the French infantry. The  Frenchman was slow in learning poker's mysteries.    And, anyway, all three men were temporarily penniless and were forced  to play for I.O.U's--which is stupid sport, at best.    So when, from the German line, came a quick sputt-sputt-sputt from a  half-dozen sharpshooters' rifles, all three men looked up from their  desultory game in real interest. Mahan got to his feet with a grunt.    \"Some other fool has been trying to see how far he can rubber above the  sandbags without drawing boche fire,\" he hazarded, starting out to  investigate. \"It's a miracle to me how a boche bullet can go through  heads that are so full of first-quality ivory as those rubberers'.\"    But Mahan's strictures were quite unwarranted. The sharpshooters were  not firing at the parapet. Their scattering shots were flying high, and  hitting against the slope of the hill behind the trenches.    Adown this shell-pocked hillside, as Mahan and the other disturbed  idlers gazed, came cantering a huge dark-brown-and-white collie. The  morning wind stirred the black stippling that edged his tawny fur,  showing the gold-gray undercoat beneath it. His white chest was like a  snowdrift, and offered a fine mark for the German rifles. A bullet or  two sang whiningly past his gayly up-flung head.    A hundred voices from the Here-We-Come trenches hailed the advancing  dog.    \"Why, it's Bruce!\" cried Mahan in glad welcome. \"I might 'a' known he  or another of the collies would be along. I might 'a' known it, when  the telephones went out of commission. He--\"    \"Regardez-donc!\" interrupted the admiring Vivier. \"He acts like bullets  was made of flies! Mooch he care for boche lead-pills, ce brave vieux!\"    \"Yes,\" growled Dale worriedly; \"and one of these days a bullet will  find its way into that splendid carcass of his. He's been shot at, a  thousand times, to my own knowledge. And all I ask is a chance, with a  rifle-butt, at the skull of the Hun who downs him!\"    \"Downs Bruce?\" queried Vivier in fine scorn. \"The boche he is no borned  who can do it. Bruce has what you call it, in Ainglish, the 'charm  life.' He go safe, where other caniche be pepper-potted full of holes.  I've watch heem. I know.\"    Unscathed by the several shots that whined past him, Bruce came to a  halt at the edge of a traverse. There he stood, wagging his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2392"],[0,"Further Adventures of Lad (#10)"],[1,"hands off Lad's collar and let him hold you out in the  lake till it freezes for the winter. As it is, one of you men can swim  out for your canoe and tow it in; and then the rest of you can bundle  aboard it and finish your picnic on somebody else's land.\"    \"Well!\" shrilled the wet damsel, striding shoreward like some sloppily  overdressed Venus rising from the sea. \"Well! I MUST say! Nice  neighborly, hospitable way to treat poor unfortunate--!\"    \"Trespassers?\" suggested the Master, as she groped for a climax word.  \"You're right. It is no way to treat a woman who has fallen into the  lake; trespasser or not. If you and this other young lady care to go up  to the kitchen, the maids will see that your clothes are dried; and  they'll lend you other clothes to go home in. Lad won't hurt you. And  in this hot weather you're in no danger of catching cold. While you're  gone, Higham and Rice can get hold of the canoe and right it and bail  it out. And, by the way, I want one of you two men to clear that litter  of food and greasy paper off my lawn. Then--\"    \"Into the kitchen!\" snorted the wet maid. \"Into the KITCHEN? I'm a  lady! I don't go into kitchens. I--\"    \"No?\" queried the Master, trying once more not to laugh. \"Well, my wife  does. So does my mother. I spoke of the kitchen because it's the only  room with a fire in it, in this weather. If you'd prefer the barn or--\"    \"I won't step one foot in your house!\" declaimed the girl. \"Nor yet I  didn't come here to be insulted. You've gone and spoiled our whole day,  you big brute! Boys, go get that canoe! We won't lower ourselves by  staying another minute on his rotten land. Afterward, our lawyer'll see  what's the penalty for treating us like this! Hurry up!\"    Rice had clumped along shore until he found a dead branch washed up in  a recent rainstorm. Wading back into deeper water he was just able to  reach the gunwale of the drifting canoe with the forked end of the  bough and, by careful jockeying, to haul it within hand-grasp.    Aided by Higham, he drew the overturned craft to the beach and righted  it. All the time, both men maintained a half-coherent diatribe, whose  language waxed hotter and hotter and whose thunderbolts centered about  the Master and his dog;--particularly about Lad;--and about the dire  legal penalties which were to be inflicted on them.    The Master, still holding Lad's ruff, stood to one side during the work  of salvaging the canoe; and while Rice replaced the paddles and  cushions in it. Only when the two women were helped sputteringly aboard  did he interfere.    \"One minute!\" he said. \"I think you've forgotten your lunch. That and  the ream or two of newspapers you've strewn around: and a few wooden  dishes. I--\"    \"I picked up all the lunch that was worth saving,\" grunted Rice. \"Your  mangy collie trampled the rest of it, when he ran down here at us. I  wisht it'd had strychnia in it and he'd et it! We'll go eat our dinner  over to the village. And, before we go, I got this much more to say to  YOU:--If--\"    \"Before you go,\" interrupted the Master, shifting himself and Lad  between Higham and the canoe, \"before you go, let me remind you that  you've left a lot of litter on my clean lawn; and that I asked you to  clean it up.\"    \"Go clean it up, yourself!\" snapped Rice, from the boat. \"This upstage  talk about 'trespassing' makes me sick! As soon as a guy has a  three-dollar patch of bum land (with a mortgage eating it up, most  likely), he always blats about 'trespassing' whenever decent folks  happens to walk on it. Go clean up the papers, yourself! We ain't your  slaves. You're due to hear a lot from us, later, too. Clean it,  yourself!\"    The ladies applauded these stirring proletariat sentiments right  vigorously. But Higham did not applaud. Rice and the women were in the  canoe. Higham had gone back to the picnic site for an overlooked  cushion. On returning toward the beach, he had found the Master and Lad  standing in his way. Loftily, he made as though to skirt them and reach  the canoe.    \"WATCH him, Laddie!\" whispered the Master, loosing his hold on the  dog's ruff.    This, in the midst of Rice's tirade. Higham stood extremely still. As  the others applauded, he began, very fervently, to swear.    \"Higham,\" suggested the Master, \"I've no personal objection to your  blasphemy. If the women of your party can stand it, I can. But aren't  you wasting a good deal of time! These papers have all got to be picked  up, you know; and the camp nicely policed. Get busy.\"    Higham glowered on him in murderous hate; then at the tensely watching  dog. Lad's upper lip curled. The man took a tentative step toward the  beach. Lad crouched, panther-like; and a low growl parted still further  his writhing lips.    Higham was enough of a collie man to foresee the inevitable next move.  He stood stock still. The Master put his hand once more on Lad's ruff;  but none too tightly. And he nodded toward the clutter of newspapers  and wooden plates. Higham's language soared spoutingly to high heaven.  But he turned back and, with vicious grabs, cleared the lawn of its  unsightly litter.    \"Take it into the boat with you.\" said the Master. \"That's all.  Goodbye. See you at the Beauville show.\"    Waiting only for the canoe and its four vociferous occupants to start  safely from shore, the Master returned to the house; Lad at his heels;  pursued by a quadruple avalanche of abuse from the damp trespassers.    \"There'll be a comeback of some kind to this, Laddie,\" he told the  collie, as they moved on. \"I don't know just what it'll be. But those  two worthy youths didn't look at all lovingly at us. And there's  nothing else in country life so filthily mean as an evicted trespasser.  Don't let's say anything to the Mistress about it, Lad. It'd only worry  her! And--and she'll think I ought to have invited all those  panhandlers up to the house to get dry. Perhaps she'd be right, too.  She generally is.\"    A week later, Lad received a summons that made his heart sink. For he  knew precisely what it foretold. He was called to the bathroom; where  awaited him a tub half full of warm water.    Now, baths were no novelty to Lad. But when a bath tub contained  certain ingredients from boxes on the dog-closet shelf,--ingredients  that fluff the coat and burnish it and make all its hairs stand out  like a Circassian Beauty's, that meant but one thing.    It meant a dog-show was at hand.    And Lad loathed dog-shows, as he loathed tramps and castor oil and  motorcycles.    After a single experience, he had never been taken to one of those  canine ordeals known as \"three-or-more-day shows.\" But the Mistress and  the Master rejoiced at his triumphs at such local one-day shows as were  within pleasant driving distance of the Place. These exhibitions  entailed no great strain or danger. Lad's chief objection to them was  that he hated to be chirped to and pawed and stared upon by an army of  strangers.    Such a one-day event was the outdoor Charity Dogshow at the Beauville  Country Club, forty miles to northeast of the Place; an easy two-hour  drive. It was to be a \"specialty show\"; at which the richness and  variety of prizes were expected to atone for the lack of A. K. C.  points involved.    A premium-list of the show had been mailed to the Place; and one of its  \"specials\" had caught the Mistress's quick eye and quicker imagination.  The special was offered by Angus McGilead, an exiled Scot whose life  fad was the Collie; and whose chief grievance was that most American  breeders did not seem able to produce collies with the unbelievable  wealth of outer-and-undercoat displayed by the oversea dogs. This  particular special was offered in the following terms:    Embossed Sterling Silver Cup, 9 Inches High (Genuine Antique) For The  Best-Coated Collie Shown.    Now, Lad's coat was the pride of the Mistress's heart. By daily  brushings she kept it in perfect condition and encouraged its luxuriant  growth. When she read of McGilead's eccentric offer, she fell to  visualizing the \"embossed sterling silver cup, 9 inches high (genuine  antique)\" as it would loom up from the hedge of dog-show prizes already  adorning the living room trophy-shelves.    Summer is the zero hour for collies' coats. Yet, this year, Lad had not  yet begun to shed his winter raiment; and he was still in full bloom.  This fact decided the Mistress. Not one collie in ten would be in  anything like perfect coat. And the prize cup grew clearer and nearer,  to her mental vision. Hence the series of special baths and brushings.  Hence, too, Laddie's daily-increasing gloom.    At eight o'clock on the morning of the show, the Mistress and the  Master, with Lad stretched forlornly on the rear seat of the car, set  forth up the Valley on the forty-mile run to Beauville. On the tonneau  floor, in front of Lad, rested a battered suitcase, which held his  toilet appurtenances;--brushes, comb, talcum, French chalk, show-leash,  sponge, crash towel, squeaking rubber doll (this to attract his bored  interest in the ring and make him \"show\") and a box of liver cut in  small bits and fried stiff.    Lad blinked down at the suitcase in morose disapproval. He hated that  bag. It spelt \"dogshow\" to him. Even the presence of the delicious  fried liver and of the mildly dramatic squeaking doll could not atone  for the rest of its contents and for all they implied.    As the car sent the miles slipping behind and as the Mistress and the  Master glanced back less and less often for a pat or a cheery word to  their sulking chum, Lad's dislike for that pestilential bag grew  sharper. True, it held squares of fried liver;--liver whose heavenly  odor penetrated through the musty leather smell of the suitcase and to  the dog's acute senses. Also, it held a doll which exuded thrilling  squeaks when gently bitten. But these things, he knew full well, were  designed as show-ring baits; not as free"]]]
