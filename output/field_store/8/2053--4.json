That's why I advise you to be  on your guard, lest something should happen to you also.\"    \"All right, all right, just let me alone, father,\" replied the youth,  and they went to rest.    When day dawned, the lad rose and set off with the flock. I don't know  how or why, but he could not feel content to gaze at the elves'  beautiful meadows, while the sheep were grazing on Mogarzea's barren  ground.    On the third day, when he was standing in the shade of a tree playing  on the flute, for he was, as it were, a master of the art of flute  playing, one of the sheep strayed away into the flowery meadows,  others followed, then others, till, when the youth noticed them, a  number of the animals had crossed the boundaries.    Still playing on his flute, he went to drive back the sheep which had  left the flock, but he suddenly saw before him three merry maidens,  who stopped him and began to dance around him. When the lad  discovered the state of affairs, he summoned up his courage and blew  with all his might. They danced until the evening.    \"Let me go now,\" he said, \"poor Mogarzea will be hungry; to-morrow, if  you wish, I'll play still better.\"    \"We will let you go,\" they replied, \"but you know that if you don't  come you will not escape our punishment.\"    So they agreed that he was to come directly to them the next morning,  sheep and all, then each went home. Mogarzea wondered why the milk had  increased so much, and was not satisfied until the lad assured him  that he had not crossed the boundaries. They ate their supper and went  to rest.    The youth did not wait till it had become perfectly light, but at the  first streak of dawn set off with the sheep straight to the elves'  meadows. When he began to play on his flute, the elves instantly  appeared and danced and danced till evening. Then the youth pretended  to drop the flute and, as if by accident, stepped upon it and broke  it.    If you could have seen how he bewailed it, how he wrung his hands and  wept over the loss of his companion, you would surely have pitied him.  Even the elves were touched with compassion and tried to comfort him.    \"I wouldn't care so much,\" he said, \"only I shall never find another  flute that will sound as merry as this one, for it was made out of the  heart of a seven-year-old cherry tree.\"    \"We have, in the court-yard, a cherry tree that is just seven years  old; if you want it, come, we'll cut it down and you can make yourself  another flute.\"    They all went there, felled the cherry tree, and for fear of touching  the pith while stripping off the bark, the youth requested all the  elves to help.    After having made a cleft in the trunk with his ax, large enough for  them to get their fingers in, he told them to take hold of it in order  to break it apart solely by the strength of their arms, that the blade  of the ax might not touch the pith of the wood. They were actually  stupid enough to do so as they stood around the trunk, and, while  saying \"pull,\" he drew out the ax and caught their fingers in the  crack.    In vain the elves begged him to release them, in vain they said that  they were almost faint with pain; the lad would not even listen to the  fine promises they made, but remained as cold as a stone.    Finally he asked them for Mogarzea's soul.    \"It is in a bottle on the window-sill,\" they said.    After he had fetched it, he inquired how he could restore it to its  place, and the elves explained, hoping he would then release them from  their torture.    \"You have tormented many people so that they suffered terrible agony  all their lives; now you too can suffer for one night, it won't make  the sky fall.\"    With these words he took the sheep and Mogarzea's soul and departed;  but the elves wailed so that any one's heart might have been torn with  pity. When he reached home, Mogarzea scolded him for being late. The  boy's only reply was to ask him to lie down on his back, then  climbing upon his breast he jumped up and down several times, until  the lazy soul the elves had conjured into him darted out and the  youngster gave him his own to swallow; holding his mouth and nose with  his hands he made him drink the water that had been in the bottle, and  then put on a plaster he had brought from the elves.    He had scarcely got it on, when Mogarzea sprang up like a deer and  said:    \"Whether you are my son or not, what do you want as a reward for what  you have done?\"    \"Tell me where the Milk Lake is, and what I am to do to obtain one of  the three fairies who are there for my wife, and let me be your son  forever.\"    Mogarzea granted the lad's wishes and they sat down to supper without  his wondering how the sheep gave so much milk; all night long they  amused themselves by shouting, singing and dancing.    Noticing that dawn was approaching before they had gone to rest, they  resolved to set out together to pay a visit to the cheated elves,--and  did so. When Mogarzea saw them, he took them, log and all, on his back  and went to his father's kingdom, where every body rejoiced when he  came home as brave and cheery as ever. But he pointed out his  deliverer, who was following behind with the sheep.    Then they all thanked the lad for his cleverness in rescuing Mogarzea  from misfortune, and the festivities at the palace lasted three whole  days.    After these three days had passed, the boy took Mogarzea aside and  said:    \"I want to go now; please tell me where the Sweet-milk Lake is, and,  God willing, I'll come back again with my wife.\"    At first Mogarzea tried to detain him, but finding it no use to talk  till he was tired, he told him what he had heard--he had seen nothing,  on account of the elves.    The boy took his flute and some food for the journey, and then,  departing, walked three long summer days until the evening, before he  reached the Milk Lake, which was in a fairy's kingdom. Early the next  morning he began to play on his flute at the edge of the lake,--and  what did he see? A beautiful fairy, whose hair was exactly like gold,  and whose clothes were more costly than any he had ever seen; she was  more dazzling than the sun as she began to dance. The boy stood  motionless with his eyes fixed upon her, but when the fairy noticed  that he was no longer playing she vanished. The next day she did the  same thing. On the third, still playing, he approached, and as in the  pleasure of dancing she did not notice it, he suddenly rushed upon  her, clasped her in his arms, kissed her, and snatched the rose from  her head.    She screamed and then begged him to give her back the flower, but he  refused. Even wood and stone might have wept over her grief, as she  lamented and entreated. But when he fastened the rose in his hat, she  followed him.    Finding that he could not be persuaded to restore the rose, they  agreed to be married. So they went to Mogarzea, to be wedded by the  emperor, and remained there, but every year in the month of May they  returned to the Milk Lake to bathe their children in its waves.    After the emperor's death Mogarzea divided the kingdom with his  preserver.          Cunning Ileane.      Once upon a time something happened. If it had not happened, it would  not be told.    There was once an emperor who had three daughters; the oldest was  beautiful, the middle one more beautiful, but the youngest, Ileane,  was so fair that even the sun stopped to gaze at her and admire her  charms.    One day the emperor received the news that his neighbor, a mighty  monarch, was no longer friendly, but wanted to fight with him on  account of a great imperial feud. The emperor consulted the old men of  the country, and, seeing there was nothing else to be done, he  commanded his valiant soldiers to mount their horses, take their  weapons, and prepare for the terrible battle which was to be fought.    Before mounting himself, the emperor called his daughters, addressed a  few fatherly, touching words to them, and gave each one a beautiful  flower, a merry little bird, and a rosy-cheeked apple.    \"Whoever has her flower wither, her bird mope or her apple rot, I  shall know has not kept her faith,\" said the wise emperor; then  mounting his steed he wished them \"Good-health\" and set off with his  brave soldiers on their toilsome way.    When the neighboring emperor's three sons heard the news that the  emperor had quitted his home and gone to the war, they made an  agreement among themselves and sprang on their horses to ride to the  palace and vex the monarch by making his three daughters faithless to  his trust. The oldest prince, a brave, spirited, handsome fellow, went  first to see how matters stood and bring tidings afterward to the  others.    Three days and three nights the champion stood under the wall, but not  one of the girls had appeared at the windows. In the gray dawn of the  fourth day he lost patience, plucked up his courage, and tapped on the  oldest princess's window.    \"What is it--what is it? What is wanted?\" asked the royal maiden,  roused from her sleep.    \"It is I, little sister,\" said the prince, \"I, an emperor's son, who  have stood under your window three days for love of you.\"    The princess did not even approach the window, but replied in a  prudent tone:    \"Go back home by the way you came; may flowers spring up before you  and thorns remain behind.\"    After three more days and nights the prince again knocked on the  girl's window. This time the princess approached it, and said in a  more gentle voice:    \"I told you to go back home by the way you came; may thorns spring up  before you and flowers remain behind.\"    Once more the prince waited three days and three nights under the  maiden's window.

We will let him describe it  in his own words, especially since the account is somewhat  autobiographical. It is the second memoir he addressed to the Committee  of Public Instruction of the National Convention, dated 4 vendemiaire,  l'an III. (1795):      \"In my first memoir I have given you an account of the works which I    have published and of those which I have undertaken to contribute to    the progress of natural history; also of the travels and researches    which I have made.      \"But for a long time I have had in view a very important    work--perhaps better adapted for education in France than those I    have already composed or undertaken--a work, in short, which the    National Convention should without doubt order, and of which no part    could be written so advantageously as in Paris, where are to be    found abundant means for carrying it to completion.      \"This is a _Systeme de la Nature_, a work analogous to the _Systema    naturae_ of Linnaeus, but written in French, and presenting the    picture complete, concise, and methodical, of all the natural    productions observed up to this day. This important work (of    Linnaeus), which the young Frenchmen who intend to devote themselves    to the study of natural history always require, is the object of    speculations by foreign authors, and has already passed through    thirteen different editions. Moreover, their works, which, to our    shame, we have to use, because we have none written expressly for    us, are filled (especially the last edition edited by Gmelin) with    gross mistakes, omissions of double and triple occurrence, and    errors in synonymy, and present many generic characters which are    inexact or imperceptible and many series badly divided, or genera    too numerous in species, and difficulties insurmountable to    students.      \"If the Committee of Public Instruction had the time to devote any    attention to the importance of my project, to the utility of    publishing such a work, and perhaps to the duty prescribed by the    national honor, I would say to it that, after having for a long time    reflected and meditated and determined upon the most feasible plan,    finally after having seen amassed and prepared the most essential    materials, I offer to put this beautiful project into execution. I    have not lost sight of the difficulties of this great enterprise. I    am, I believe, as well aware of them, and better, than any one else;    but I feel that I can overcome them without descending to a simple    and dishonorable compilation of what foreigners have written on the    subject. I have some strength left to sacrifice for the common    advantage; I have had some experience and practice in writing works    of this kind; my herbarium is one of the richest in existence; my    numerous collection of shells is almost the only one in France the    specimens of which are determined and named according to the method    adopted by modern naturalists--finally, I am in a position to profit    by all the aid which is to be found in the National Museum of    Natural History. With these means brought together, I can then hope    to prepare in a suitable manner this interesting work.      \"I had at first thought that the work should be executed by a    society of naturalists; but after having given this idea much    thought, and having already the example of the new encyclopaedia, I    am convinced that in such a case the work would be very defective in    arrangement, without unity or plan, without any harmony of    principles, and that its composition might be interminable.      \"Written with the greatest possible conciseness, this work could not    be comprised in less than eight volumes in 8vo, namely: One volume    for the quadrupeds and birds; one volume for the reptiles and    fishes; two volumes for the insects; one volume for the worms (the    molluscs, madrepores, lithophytes, and naked worms); two volumes for    the plants; one volume for the minerals: eight volumes in all.      \"It is impossible to prepare in France a work of this nature without    having special aid from the nation, because the expense of printing    (on account of the enormous quantity of citations and figures which    it would contain) would be such that any arrangement with the    printer or the manager of the edition could not remunerate the    author for writing such an immense work.      \"If the nation should wish to print the work at its own expense, and    then give to the author the profits of the sale of this edition,    the author would be very much pleased, and would doubtless not    expect any further aid. But it would cost the nation a great deal,    and I believe that this useful project could be carried through with    greater economy.      \"Indeed, if the nation will give me twenty thousand francs, in a    single payment, I will take the whole responsibility, and I agree,    if I live, that before the expiration of seven years the _Systeme de    la Nature_ in French, with the complemental addition, the    corrections, and the convenient explanations, shall be at the    disposition of all those who love or study natural history.\"      FOOTNOTES:    [32] Most men of science of the Revolution, like Monge and others, were  advanced republicans, and the Chevalier Lamarck, though of noble birth,  was perhaps not without sympathy with the ideas which led to the  establishment of the republic. It is possible that in his walks and  intercourse with Rousseau he may have been inspired with the new notions  of liberty and equality first promulgated by that philosopher.    His studies and meditations were probably not interrupted by the events  of the Terror. Stevens, in his history of the French Revolution, tells  us that Paris was never gayer than in the summer of 1793, and that  during the Reign of Terror the restaurants, _cafes_, and theatres were  always full. There were never more theatres open at the same period than  then, though no single great play or opera was produced. Meanwhile the  great painter David at this time built up a school of art and made that  city a centre for art students. Indeed the Revolution was \"a grand time  for enthusiastic young men,\" while people in general lived their  ordinary lives. There is little doubt, then, that the savants, except  the few who were occupied by their duties as members of the _Convention  Nationale_, worked away quietly at their specialties, each in his own  study or laboratory or lecture-room.    [33] Bern. Germ. Etienne, Comte de Lacepede, born in 1756, died in 1825,  was elected professor of the zooelogy of \"quadrupedes ovipares, reptiles,  et poissons,\" January 12, 1795 (Records of the Museum). He was the  author of works on amphibia, reptiles, and mammals, forming  continuations of Buffon's _Histoire Naturelle_. He also published  _Histoire Naturelle des Poissons_ (1798-1803), _Histoire des Cetaces_  (1804), and _Histoire Naturelle de l'Homme_ (1827), _Les Ages de la  Nature et Histoire de l'Espece Humaine_, tome 2, 1830.    [34] Perrier, _l. c._, p. 14.    [35] _Fragments Biographiques_, p. 214.    [36] _Fragments Biographiques_, p. 213.    [37] A few years ago, when we formed the plan of writing his life, we  wrote to friends in Paris for information as to the exact house in which  Lamarck lived, and received the answer that it was unknown; another  proof of the neglect and forgetfulness that had followed Lamarck so many  years after his death, and which was even manifested before he died.  Afterwards Professor Giard kindly wrote that by reference to the _proces  verbaux_ of the Assembly, it had been found by Professor Hamy that he  had lived in the house of Buffon.    The house is situated at the corner of Rue de Buffon and Rue Geoffroy  St. Hilaire. The courtyard facing Rue Geoffroy St. Hilaire bears the  number 2 Rue de Buffon, and is in the angle between the Galerie de  Zoologie and the Bibliotheque. The edifice is a large four-storied one.  Lamarck occupied the second _etage_, what we should call the third  story; it was first occupied by Buffon. His bedroom, where he died, was  on the _premier etage_. It was tenanted by De Quatrefages in his time,  and is at present occupied by Professor G. T. Hamy; Professor L.  Vaillant living in the first _etage_, or second story, and Dr. J.  Deniker, the _bibliothecaire_ and learned anthropologist, in the third.  The second _etage_ was, about fifty years ago (1840-50), renovated for  the use of Fremy the chemist, so that the exact room occupied by Lamarck  as a study cannot be identified.    This ancient house was originally called _La Croix de Fer_, and was  built about two centuries before the foundation of the Jardin du Roi. It  appears from an inspection of the notes on the titles and copies of the  original deeds, preserved in the Archives, and kindly shown me by  Professor G. T. Hamy, the Archivist of the Museum, that this house was  erected in 1468, the deed being dated _1xbre_, 1468. The house is  referred to as _maison ditte La Croix de Fer_ in deeds of 1684, 1755,  and 1768. It was sold by Charles Roger to M. le Compte de Buffon,  March 23, 1771. One of the old gardens overlooked by it was called _de  Jardin de la Croix_. It was originally the first structure erected on  the south side of the Jardin du Roi.    [38] In the \"avertissement\" to his _Systeme des Animaux sans Vertebres_  (1801), after stating that he had at his disposition the magnificent  collection of invertebrate animals of the museum, he refers to his  private collection as follows: \"Et une autre assez riche que j'ai formee  moi-meme par pres de trente annees de recherches,\" p. vii. Afterwards he  formed another collection of shells named according to his system, and  containing a part of the types described in his _Histoire Naturelle des  Animaux sans Vertebres_ and in his minor articles.
