But  the rig with a long mid rope, to which the dogs are attached by  single-trees in such manner that they may at will be hitched abreast or  one ahead of the other as the trail is wide or narrow, is superseding  the tandem rig, and one sees more bushy tails amongst the dogs. The  thick, long-haired tail of the dog in this country is indeed his  blanket, and in cold weather the tailless dog is at a great  disadvantage.    It was said that all the dogs retired to the nests of spruce bough; it  should have been all but one. It is Lingo's special charge to guard the  sled and his special privilege to sleep on it. Turning around and  curling up on the softest spot he can find of the unlashed and partly  unloaded toboggan, he will not touch anything it contains nor permit any  other dog to touch it.    The northern skies are clouded the next morning, the first day of the  new year, and there is a ruddy dawn that is glorious to behold. The  white earth gives back a soft rose tint, as an organ pipe gives back a  faint tone to the strong vibration of another pipe in pitch with it. We  shall not see the sun himself any more for many weeks, but we see his  light upon the flanks of the mountains for an hour or so around noon.  The bold, shapely peaks of the South Fork of the Koyukuk turn their  snows to pink fire as his rays slowly descend their sides, and the  whole scene is exquisitely beautiful. What a wonderful thing colour is!  When the skies are overcast this is a dead black-and-white country in  winter, for spruce, the prevailing wood, is black in the mass at a  little distance. Gaze where one will, there is naught but black and  white. The eye becomes tired of the monotony and longs for some warmer  tone. That is surely the reason why all those who live in the country  cherish some gay article of attire, why the natives love brilliant  handkerchiefs, why the white man also will choose a crimson scarf.  Trudging at the handle-bars, I have found pleasure in the red pompons of  the dogs' harness, in the gay beading of mitten and hind-sack. And that  is why a lavish feast of colour such as this dawn stirs one's spirit  with such keen delight. It gives life to a dead world.    But the wind is still bitter and interferes sadly with one's enjoyment.  All through the valley, up the creek by which we leave it, past the twin  lakes on the low summit, the wind grows in force, and when we leave  Slate Creek for the present and make a \"portage\" over a mountain  shoulder to strike the creek again much lower down, the wind has risen  to a gale that overturns the toboggans and makes the men fight for their  footing. The actual physical labour of it is enormous, and there can be  no rest; it is too bitterly cold in that blast to stop. For a mile or  two we struggle and slave to beat our way around that mountain shoulder  and then drop down to the creek again. The blessed relief it is to get  out of the fury of that wind into the comparative shelter of the creek,  to be done with the ceaseless toil of holding the heavy toboggans from  hurtling down the hillside, to be able to keep one's feet without  continually slipping and falling on the wind-hardened snow, no words can  adequately convey. We are all frozen again a little; this man's nose is  touched, that man's cheeks, and the other man's finger.    [Sidenote: THE KOYUKUK GOLD CAMP]    On the middle fork of the Koyukuk, at the mouth of Slate Creek, Coldfoot  sits within a cirque of rugged mountain peaks, the most northerly postal  town in the interior of Alaska, the most northerly gold-mining town in  the world, as it claims. It sprang into existence in 1900 and flourished  for a season or two with the usual accompaniments of such florification.  In 1906 it was already much decayed, and is now dead. Ever since its  start the Koyukuk camp has steadily produced gold and given occupation  to miners numbering from one hundred and fifty to three hundred, but the  scene of operations, and therefore the depot for supplies, has  continually changed. In 1900 the chief producing creek was Myrtle, which  is a tributary of Slate Creek, and the town at the mouth was in eligible  situation, though much over-built from the first. Then the centre of  interest shifted to Nolan Creek, fifteen miles farther up the river,  which is a tributary of Wiseman Creek, and the town of Wiseman sprang up  at the mouth of that creek. The post-office, the commissioner's office,  and the saloon, the stores and road-houses, migrated to the new spot,  and Coldfoot was abandoned. Now the chief producing creek is the Hammond  River, still farther up the Koyukuk, and if its placer deposits prove  as rich as they promise it is likely that a town will spring up at the  mouth of the Hammond which will supersede Wiseman.    There has never been found a continuous pay-streak in the Koyukuk camp.  It is what is known as a \"pocket\" camp. Now and again a \"spot\" is found  which enriches its discoverers, while on the claims above and below that  spot the ground may be too poor to work at a profit; for ground must be  rich to be worked at all in the Koyukuk. It is the most expensive camp  in Alaska, perhaps in the world. This is due to its remoteness and  difficulty of access. Far north of the Arctic Circle, the diggings are  about seventy-five miles above the head of light-draught steamboat  navigation, and more than six hundred miles above the confluence of the  Koyukuk with the Yukon. Transshipped at Nulato to the shoal-water  steamboats that make three or four trips a season up the Koyukuk,  transshipped again at Bettles, the head of any steamboat navigation,  freight must be hauled on horse scows the remaining seventy-five miles  of the journey; and all that handling and hauling means high rates. The  cost of living, the cost of machinery, the general cost of all mining  operations is much higher than on the Yukon or on the other tributaries  of that river. The very smallness of the camp is a factor in the high  prices, for there is not trade enough to induce brisk competition with  the reduction of rates that competition brings.    [Sidenote: MINERS' GENEROSITY]    Yet the smallness and the isolation of the camp have their  compensations. There is more community life, more _esprit de corps_  amongst the Koyukuk miners than will be found in any other camp in  Alaska. Thrown upon their own resources for amusement, social gatherings  are more common and are made more of, and hospitality is universal. Like  all sparsely settled and frontier lands, Alaska is a very hospitable  place in general, but the Koyukuk has earned the name of the most  hospitable camp in Alaska. Since the numbers are small, and each man is  well known to all the others, any sickness or suffering makes an  immediate appeal and brings a generous response. Again and again the  unfortunate victim of accident or disease has been sent outside for  treatment, the considerable money required being quickly raised by  public subscription. There is probably no other gold camp in the world  where it is a common thing for the owner of a good claim to tell a  neighbour who is \"broke\" to take a pan and go down to the drift and help  himself.    Until my visit of the previous year no minister of religion of any sort  had penetrated to the Koyukuk, and, save for one journey thither by  Bishop Rowe, my annual visits have been the only opportunities for  public worship since. It will suffice for the visit now describing as  well as for all the others to say that the reception was most cordial  and the opportunity much appreciated. We went from creek to creek and  gathered the men and the few women in whatever cabin was most  convenient, and no clergyman could wish for more attentive or interested  congregations.    [Illustration: THE UPPER KOYUKUK.]    Upon our return to Coldfoot from the creek visits the thermometer stood  at 52 deg. below zero, although it had been no lower than 38 deg. below when we  left the last creek, some fifteen miles away. As a general rule, the  temperature on these mountain creeks, which are at some considerable  elevation above the river into which they flow, will read from 10 deg. to  15 deg. higher than on the river, and if one climbed to the top of the peaks  around Coldfoot, the difference then would probably be 20 deg. or 25 deg.. At  the summit road-house between Fairbanks and Cleary City in the Tanana  country in cold weather the thermometer commonly reads 20 deg. above the one  place and 10 deg. or 15 deg. above the other.    [Illustration: THE BARREN SHORES OF KOTZEBUE SOUND.]    [Sidenote: LINGO]    This interesting fact, which surprises a good many people, for we are  used to think of elevated places as cold places, is due to the greater  heaviness of cold air, which sinks to the lowest level it can reach; and  the river bed is the lowest part of the country. It would be interesting  to find out to what extent this rule holds good. The ridges and the  hilltops are always the warmest places in cold weather; would this hold  as regards mountain tops?--as regards high mountain tops? Probably it  would hold in the sunshine, but the rapid radiation of heat in the  rarefied atmosphere of mountain tops would swing the balance the other  way after dark. There is no doubt, however, that the coldest place in  cold weather in Alaska is the river surface, and it is on the river  surface that most of our travelling is done. The night we returned to  Coldfoot we put our toboggan up high on the roof of an outhouse to keep  its skin sides from the teeth of some hungry native dogs, leaving some  of the load that was not required within it, covered by the sled  cloth.

My mammy Ferbie, an' her brother Darson belonged ter Mr. David Hinnant  in Edgecombe County till young Marster Charlie got married. Den dey wuz  drawed an' sent wid him down hyar ter Wendell. De ole Hinnant home am  still standin' dar ter dis day.    Marster Charlie an' Missus Mary wuz good ter de hundred slaves what  belonged ter' em. Dey gib 'em good houses, good feed, good clothes an'  plenty uv fun. Dey had dere co'n shuckin's, dere barn dances, prayer  meetin's an' sich like all de year, an' from Christmas till de second  day o' January dey had a holiday wid roast oxes, pigs, turkey an' all de  rest o' de fixin's. From Saturday till Monday de slaves wuz off an' dey  had dere Sunday clothes, which wuz nice. De marster always gib 'em a  paper so's de patterollers won't git 'em.    Dey went up de riber to other plantations ter dances an' all dem  things, an' dey wuz awful fond uv singin' songs. Dat's whut dey done  atter dey comes ter dere cabins at de end o' de day. De grown folkses  sings an' somebody pickin' de banjo. De favorite song wuz 'Swing Low  Sweet Chariot' an' 'Play on yo' Harp Little David'. De chilluns uster  play Hide an' Seek, an' Leap Frog, an' ever'body wuz happy.    Dey had time off ter hunt an' fish an' dey had dere own chickens, pigs,  watermillons an' gyardens. De fruits from de big orchard an' de honey  from de hives wuz et at home, an' de slave et as good as his marster et.  Dey had a whole heap o' bee hives an' my mammy said dat she had ter  tell dem bees when Mis' Mary died. She said how she wuz cryin' so hard  dat she can't hardly tell 'em, an' dat dey hum lak dey am mo'nin' too.    My mammy marry my pappy dar an' she sez dat de preacher from de  Methodis' Church marry 'em, dat she w'ar Miss Mary's weddin' dress, all  uv white lace, an' dat my pappy w'ar Mr. Charlie's weddin' suit wid a  flower in de button hole. Dey gived a big dance atter de supper dey had,  an' Marster Charlie dance de first [HW correction: fust] set wid my  mammy.    I jist thought of a tale what I hyard my mammy tell 'bout de Issue  Frees of Edgecombe County when she wuz a little gal. She said dat de  Issue Frees wuz mixed wid de white folks, an' uv cou'se dat make 'em  free. Sometimes dey stay on de plantation, but a whole heap uv dem, long  wid niggers who had done runned away from dere marster, dugged caves in  de woods, an' dar dey lived an' raised dere families dar. Dey ain't  wored much clothes an' what dey got to eat an' to w'ar dey swiped from  de white folkses. Mammy said dat she uster go ter de spring fer water,  an' dem ole Issue Frees up in de woods would yell at her, 'Doan yo'  muddy dat spring, little gal'. Dat scared her moughty bad.    Dem Issue Frees till dis day shows both bloods. De white folkses won't  have 'em an' de niggers doan want 'em but will have ter have 'em  anyhow.    My uncle wuz raised in a cave an' lived on stold stuff an' berries. My  cousin runned away 'cause his marster wuz mean ter him, but dey put de  blood hounds on his trail, ketched him. Atter he got well from de  beatin' dey gib him, dey sold him.    I'se hyard ole lady Prissie Jones who died at de age of 103 las' winter  tell 'bout marsters dat when dere slaves runned away dey'd set de  bloodhounds on dere trail an' when dey ketched 'em dey'd cut dere haids  off wid de swords.    Ole lady Prissie tole 'bout slaves what ain't had nothin' ter eat an'  no clothes 'cept a little strip uv homespun, but my mammy who died four  months ago at de age 106 said dat she ain't knowed nothin' 'bout such  doin's.    When de Yankees come, dey come a burnin' an' a-stealin' an' Marster  Charlie carried his val'ables ter mammy's cabin, but dey found 'em. Dey  had a money rod an' dey'd find all de stuff no matter whar it wuz.  Mammy said dat all de slaves cried when de Yankees come, an' dat most uv  'em stayed on a long time atter de war. My mammy plowed an' done such  work all de time uv slavery, but she done it case she wanted to do it  an' not 'cause dey make her.    All de slaves hate de Yankees an' when de southern soldiers comed by  late in de night all de niggers got out of de bed an' holdin' torches  high dey march behin' de soldiers, all of dem singin', 'We'll Hang Abe  Lincoln on de Sour Apple Tree.' Yes mam, dey wuz sorry dat dey wuz free,  an' dey ain't got no reason to be glad, case dey wuz happier den dan  now.    I'se hyard mammy tell 'bout how de niggers would sing as dey picked de  cotton, but yo' ain't hyard none uv dat now. Den dey ain't had to worry  'bout nothin'; now dey has ter study so much dat dey ain't happy nuff  ter sing no mo'.    \"Does yo' know de cause of de war?\" Aunt Alice went to a cupboard and  returned holding out a book. \"Well hyar's de cause, dis _Uncle Tom's  Cabin_ wuz de cause of it all; an' its' de biggest lie what ever been  gived ter de public.\"          N.

I reckon dat I wuz 'bout nine years old at de surrender, but we warn't  happy an' we stayed on dar till my parents died. My pappy wuz named  Green an' my mammy wuz named Molly, an' we belonged ter Mr. Joe Edwards,  Mr. Marion Gully, an' Mr. Hilliard Beckwith, as de missus married all of  'em. Dar wuz twenty-one other slaves, an' we got beat ever' onct in a  while.    When dey told us dat de Yankees wuz comin' we wuz also told dat iffen  we didn't behave dat we'd be shot; an' we believed it. We would'uv  behaved anyhow, case we had good plank houses, good food, an' shoes. We  had Saturday an' Sunday off an' we wuz happy.    De missus, she raised de nigger babies so's de mammies could wuck. I  'members de times when she rock me ter sleep an' put me ter bed in her  own bed. I wuz happy den as I thinks back of it, until dem Yankees  come.    Dey come on a Chuesday; an' dey started by burnin' de cotton house an'  killin' most of de chickens an' pigs. Way atter awhile dey fin's de  cellar an' dey drinks brandy till dey gits wobbly in de legs. Atter dat  dey comes up on de front porch an' calls my missus. When she comes ter  de do' dey tells her dat dey am goin' in de house ter look things over.  My missus dejicts, case ole marster am away at de war, but dat doan do  no good. Dey cusses her scan'lous an' dey dares her ter speak. Dey robs  de house, takin' dere knives an' splittin' mattresses, pillows an' ever'  thing open lookin' fer valerables, an' ole missus dasen't open her  mouth.    Dey camped dar in de grove fer two days, de officers takin' de house  an' missus leavin' home an' goin' ter de neighbor's house. Dey make me  stay dar in de house wid 'em ter tote dere brandy frum de cellar, an'  ter make 'em some mint jelup. Well, on de secon' night dar come de wust  storm I'se eber seed.
