All things therefore appear to be made up and produced by the coming  together of these elements, so that they have been distributed by nature  among an infinite number of kinds of things. Hence I believed it right  to treat of the diversity and practical peculiarities of these things as  well as of the qualities which they exhibit in buildings, so that  persons who are intending to build may understand them and so make no  mistake, but may gather materials which are suitable to use in their  buildings.          CHAPTER III    BRICK      1. Beginning with bricks, I shall state of what kind of clay they ought  to be made. They should not be made of sandy or pebbly clay, or of fine  gravel, because when made of these kinds they are in the first place  heavy; and, secondly, when washed by the rain as they stand in walls,  they go to pieces and break up, and the straw in them does not hold  together on account of the roughness of the material. They should rather  be made of white and chalky or of red clay, or even of a coarse grained  gravelly clay. These materials are smooth and therefore durable; they  are not heavy to work with, and are readily laid.    2. Bricks should be made in Spring or Autumn, so that they may dry  uniformly. Those made in Summer are defective, because the fierce heat  of the sun bakes their surface and makes the brick seem dry while inside  it is not dry. And so the shrinking, which follows as they dry, causes  cracks in the parts which were dried before, and these cracks make the  bricks weak. Bricks will be most serviceable if made two years before  using; for they cannot dry thoroughly in less time. When fresh undried  bricks are used in a wall, the stucco covering stiffens and hardens into  a permanent mass, but the bricks settle and cannot keep the same height  as the stucco; the motion caused by their shrinking prevents them from  adhering to it, and they are separated from their union with it. Hence  the stucco, no longer joined to the core of the wall, cannot stand by  itself because it is so thin; it breaks off, and the walls themselves  may perhaps be ruined by their settling. This is so true that at Utica  in constructing walls they use brick only if it is dry and made five  years previously, and approved as such by the authority of a magistrate.    3. There are three kinds of bricks. First, the kind called in Greek  Lydian, being that which our people use, a foot and a half long and one  foot wide. The other two kinds are used by the Greeks in their  buildings. Of these, one is called [Greek: pentadoron], the other  [Greek: tetradoron]. [Greek: Doron] is the Greek for \"palm,\" for in  Greek [Greek: doron] means the giving of gifts, and the gift is always  presented in the palm of the hand. A brick five palms square is called  \"pentadoron\"; one four palms square \"tetradoron.\" Public buildings are  constructed of [Greek: pentadora], private of [Greek: tetradora].    4. With these bricks there are also half-bricks. When these are used in  a wall, a course of bricks is laid on one face and a course of  half-bricks on the other, and they are bedded to the line on each face.  The walls are bonded by alternate courses of the two different kinds,  and as the bricks are always laid so as to break joints, this lends  strength and a not unattractive appearance to both sides of such walls.    [Illustration: VITRUVIUS' BRICK-BOND ACCORDING TO REBER]    In the states of Maxilua and Callet, in Further Spain, as well as in  Pitane in Asia Minor, there are bricks which, when finished and dried,  will float on being thrown into water. The reason why they can float  seems to be that the clay of which they are made is like pumice-stone.  So it is light, and also it does not, after being hardened by exposure  to the air, take up or absorb liquid. So these bricks, being of this  light and porous quality, and admitting no moisture into their texture,  must by the laws of nature float in water, like pumice, no matter what  their weight may be. They have therefore great advantages; for they are  not heavy to use in building and, once made, they are not spoiled by bad  weather.          CHAPTER IV    SAND      1. In walls of masonry the first question must be with regard to the  sand, in order that it may be fit to mix into mortar and have no dirt in  it. The kinds of pitsand are these: black, gray, red, and carbuncular.  Of these the best will be found to be that which crackles when rubbed in  the hand, while that which has much dirt in it will not be sharp enough.  Again: throw some sand upon a white garment and then shake it out; if  the garment is not soiled and no dirt adheres to it, the sand is  suitable.    2. But if there are no sandpits from which it can be dug, then we must  sift it out from river beds or from gravel or even from the sea beach.  This kind, however, has these defects when used in masonry: it dries  slowly; the wall cannot be built up without interruption but from time  to time there must be pauses in the work; and such a wall cannot carry  vaultings. Furthermore, when sea-sand is used in walls and these are  coated with stucco, a salty efflorescence is given out which spoils the  surface.    3. But pitsand used in masonry dries quickly, the stucco coating is  permanent, and the walls can support vaultings. I am speaking of sand  fresh from the sandpits. For if it lies unused too long after being  taken out, it is disintegrated by exposure to sun, moon, or hoar frost,  and becomes earthy. So when mixed in masonry, it has no binding power on  the rubble, which consequently settles and down comes the load which the  walls can no longer support. Fresh pitsand, however, in spite of all its  excellence in concrete structures, is not equally useful in stucco, the  richness of which, when the lime and straw are mixed with such sand,  will cause it to crack as it dries on account of the great strength of  the mixture. But river sand, though useless in \"signinum\" on account of  its thinness, becomes perfectly solid in stucco when thoroughly worked  by means of polishing instruments.          CHAPTER V    LIME      1. Sand and its sources having been thus treated, next with regard to  lime we must be careful that it is burned from a stone which, whether  soft or hard, is in any case white. Lime made of close-grained stone of  the harder sort will be good in structural parts; lime of porous stone,  in stucco. After slaking it, mix your mortar, if using pitsand, in the  proportions of three parts of sand to one of lime; if using river or  sea-sand, mix two parts of sand with one of lime. These will be the  right proportions for the composition of the mixture. Further, in using  river or sea-sand, the addition of a third part composed of burnt brick,  pounded up and sifted, will make your mortar of a better composition to  use.    2. The reason why lime makes a solid structure on being combined with  water and sand seems to be this: that rocks, like all other bodies, are  composed of the four elements. Those which contain a larger proportion  of air, are soft; of water, are tough from the moisture; of earth, hard;  and of fire, more brittle. Therefore, if limestone, without being  burned, is merely pounded up small and then mixed with sand and so put  into the work, the mass does not solidify nor can it hold together. But  if the stone is first thrown into the kiln, it loses its former property  of solidity by exposure to the great heat of the fire, and so with its  strength burnt out and exhausted it is left with its pores open and  empty. Hence, the moisture and air in the body of the stone being burned  out and set free, and only a residuum of heat being left lying in it, if  the stone is then immersed in water, the moisture, before the water can  feel the influence of the fire, makes its way into the open pores; then  the stone begins to get hot, and finally, after it cools off, the heat  is rejected from the body of the lime.    3. Consequently, limestone when taken out of the kiln cannot be as heavy  as when it was thrown in, but on being weighed, though its bulk remains  the same as before, it is found to have lost about a third of its weight  owing to the boiling out of the water. Therefore, its pores being thus  opened and its texture rendered loose, it readily mixes with sand, and  hence the two materials cohere as they dry, unite with the rubble, and  make a solid structure.          CHAPTER VI    POZZOLANA      1. There is also a kind of powder which from natural causes produces  astonishing results. It is found in the neighbourhood of Baiae and in  the country belonging to the towns round about Mt. Vesuvius. This  substance, when mixed with lime and rubble, not only lends strength to  buildings of other kinds, but even when piers of it are constructed in  the sea, they set hard under water. The reason for this seems to be that  the soil on the slopes of the mountains in these neighbourhoods is hot  and full of hot springs. This would not be so unless the mountains had  beneath them huge fires of burning sulphur or alum or asphalt. So the  fire and the heat of the flames, coming up hot from far within through  the fissures, make the soil there light, and the tufa found there is  spongy and free from moisture. Hence, when the three substances, all  formed on a similar principle by the force of fire, are mixed together,  the water suddenly taken in makes them cohere, and the moisture quickly  hardens them so that they set into a mass which neither the waves nor  the force of the water can dissolve.    2. That there is burning heat in these regions may be proved by the  further fact that in the mountains near Baiae, which belongs to the  Cumaeans, there are places excavated to serve as sweating-baths, where  the intense heat that comes from far below bores its way through the  earth, owing to the force of the fire,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20248"],[0,"The Necessity of Atheism (#10)"],[1,"of its popes put to shame the statement that they  could possibly be the earthly representatives of a Benevolent Being. \"In  the ninth and tenth centuries the papacy passed through a period of  shameful disorder. The Rome of John X was a cloaca in which the Popes  set the example of the worst misconduct.\" (For a good short account of  the lives of the popes, see Draper's, \"History of the Intellectual  Development of Europe.\")    During the complete control by the Church of civilization in Europe, it  has retarded the progress of humanity for at least 2000 years, and its  precepts and fundamental principles are today detrimental to the advance  of mankind. It has to its credit a long series of judicial murders for  differences of opinion. The Crusades, instigated by the popes and  seconded by the monks, cost millions of lives and exhausted the  resources of Christian Europe; they aggravated fanaticism, exaggerated  the worship of saints and relics to the point of mania, and encouraged  the abuse of and traffic in indulgences. There had never been a single  opinion persecuted by the Church in the Middle Ages the adoption of  which would not have brought about a diminution of her revenues; the  Church has always primarily considered her finances. The papacy was  responsible for the Inquisition, and it actively encouraged and excited  its ferocity. It gave birth to the Witchcraft Mania. The first Grand  Inquisitor, Torquemada, received the congratulations of the Pope. It  diabolically applauded the St. Bartholomew Massacre, and instigated the  numerous religious wars that tore Europe asunder, and was the cause of  the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives and incalculable suffering.  With such savage alacrity did it carry out its object of protecting the  interests of religion that between 1481 and 1808 it had punished three  hundred and forty thousand persons, and of these, nearly 32,000 had been  burnt.    \"It is perfectly certain that the Catholic Church has taught, and still  teaches that intellectual liberty is dangerous, that it should be  forbidden. It was driven to take this position because it had taken  another. It taught, and still teaches, that a certain belief is  necessary to salvation. It has always known that investigation and  inquiry led, or might lead, to doubt; that doubt leads, or may lead, to  heresy, and that heresy leads to Hell. In other words, the Catholic  Church has something more important than this world, more important than  the well-being of man here. It regards this life as an opportunity for  joining that Church, for accepting that creed, and for the saving of  your soul. If the history of the world proves anything, if proves that  the Catholic Church was for many centuries the most merciless  institution that ever existed among men. We, too, know that the  Catholic Church was, during all the years of its power, the enemy of  every science. It preferred magic to medicine, relics to remedies,  priests to physicians. It hated geologists, persecuted the chemists, and  imprisoned the naturalists, and opposed every discovery of science  calculated to improve the condition of mankind. There is no crime that  the Catholic Church did not commit, no cruelty that it did not reward,  and no virtue that it did not persecute. It was the greatest and most  powerful enemy of human rights. In one hand, it carried an alms dish,  and in the other, a dagger. It argued with the sword, persecuted with  poison, and convicted with faggot.\" R. G. Ingersoll, \"_Rome or Reason_.\"    \"From the time of Newton to our own day, the divergence of science from  the dogmas of the Church has steadily increased. The Church declared  that the earth is the central and most important body in the Universe,  that the sun and moon and stars are tributary to it. On these points she  was worsted by astronomy. She affirmed that a universal deluge had  covered the earth; that the only surviving animals were such as had been  saved in the Ark. In this, her error was established by geology. She  taught that there was a first man who, some 6000 or 8000 years ago, was  suddenly created or called into existence in a condition of physical and  moral perfection, and from that condition he fell. But anthropology has  shown that human beings existed far back in geological time, and in a  savage state but little better than that of the brute.... Convicted of  so many errors, the papacy makes no attempt at explanation. It ignores  the whole matter. Nay, more, relying on the efficacy of audacity,  although confronted by these facts, it lays claim to infallibility.\"    The persecutions of Bruno, Galileo, and Copernicus, together with the  facts hitherto stated, did not impress the Martian with the  \"infallibility\" of the Church. The only great spiritual power that could  have interposed to prevent the outbreak of the World War was the papacy.  Pope Pius X had his Nuncio admonish the Austrian emperor, but he failed  even to get an audition from that old imbecile. The next Pope, Benedict  XV, was under the influence of a majority of pro-German cardinals. He  strove to remain neutral. He attempted to solace the Belgians with  words, but he did not reprove the murderous invaders. He protested  against the new and devilish methods of warfare but he did not condemn,  he did not excommunicate those that used them. Had the papacy lost its  much-used power of commanding kings and nations, and had it lost its  greatest threat, a threat which hitherto could have thrown the masses of  its adherents into a panic, the threat of excommunication? No, the  papacy still blessed the banners of the armies, just as it did during  the middle ages, and sent its adherents out to slaughter; but first took  great care that the minds of the devout be completely drugged with the  poison of its creed. A creed that told its followers that do what you  might, no matter how dastardly that act might be, so long as you repent  and confess your sins, life everlasting will be the reward. What is the  value of a church that has claimed the moral leadership of the world  when such things can happen?    Now that the Martian has become acquainted with the three major  religions which dominate the world, Judaism, Christianity, and  Mohammedanism, and has been amazed and shocked at the significance of  their teachings in the history of civilization, his curiosity is further  aroused, and he decides to obtain some information of the respective  personalities responsible for the amassing of devotees to these creeds,  all \"infallible,\" and all detrimental to progress. This time his  interest leads him to ancient and contemporary sources, of a literal  rather than verbal nature; sources dealing with the three most  influential prophets in the history of mankind, Jesus, Moses, and  Mohammed.          CHAPTER III    THE PROPHETS MOHAMMED, JESUS, AND MOSES CHARLATANS OR VICTIMS OF MENTAL  AND PHYSICAL DISEASE        _The prophet or seer is a man of strong imaginative powers, which      have not been calmed by education. The ideas which occur to his mind      often present themselves to his eyes and ears in corresponding      sights and sounds.... Prophets have existed in all countries and at      all times; but the gift becomes rare in the same proportion as      people learn to read and write_.        WINWOOD READE.      Religious apologists are forever reminding us that we must interpret  both the lives and the works of their prophets and recorders in the  spirit and meaning of the ages in which they lived. To this I agree; but  the apologists have so mutilated the meaning of the words of the seers  and built about them such a mass of nonsense, myth, and fable that it  becomes nearly impossible after the lapse of centuries to differentiate  the actual man from the fabled man. But there are certain facts that do  come down to us recorded by disinterested observers from which can be  derived finally some conception of their mode of life, and the content  and significance of their teachings.    Although time causes great changes in customs and manners, it only  effects a negligible variation in the vast majority of diseases which  affect the body and mind of man. We know from the examination of the  skeletal remains of prehistoric man that the diseases of the bone of  thousands of years ago were similar in their manifestations to those  same diseases of bone of today. From the writings of the early Egyptian,  Greek, and Roman physicians we identify diseases by their symptoms, and  recognize that the symptoms of these diseases have not changed  throughout the ages. Therefore, with the knowledge of the signs and  symptoms of various diseases which we have today, we can safely assert  that if an ancient complained of the same group of signs and symptoms  (which is now termed a \"disease complex\"), he was suffering from the  same disease which we can identify in modern man.    What applies to physical disease is just as applicable to mental  disease. In speaking of mental disease, it is important for the layman  to keep in mind a few fundamental principles held by the physician. The  physician in speaking of mental disease means a more or less permanent  departure from the normal or usual way of thinking, acting, or feeling.  In the examination of a patient with mental disease the physician looks  for delusions, illusions, and hallucinations.    A delusion is a false belief, concerning which the individual who holds  it is unable to admit evidence such as would be admitted by ordinary  individuals.    An illusion is a deception of the senses, a misinterpretation of sensory  impressions; the normal person can be convinced of this deception. The  mirage, for example, is an optical illusion which has a starting point  in an external stimulus.    A hallucination is a deception of any of the five senses, in which there  is no starting point but it is fabricated in a disordered mind."]]]
