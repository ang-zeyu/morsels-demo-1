Leaving the harbor, we all stayed on deck as long as possible trying to  fix the grandeur of the scenery in our minds so it could not slip away,  and then Priest Rock was passed, we had turned about eastward, and were  in Unimak Pass. Here the wind blew a gale from the west, on account of  which we were obliged to go below to our staterooms after watching the  sailors lash everything on the hurricane deck well down in case of  storm. After a few hours we left the Pass, with its precipitous cliffs,  its barren and rocky slopes, its cones of extinct volcanoes, its rough  and deep water, and headed due southeast for \"Frisco.\"    Many unpleasant people and things we found on board as we proceeded, for  not all of these had been left at Nome; but with a philosopher's  fortitude we studied to overlook everything disagreeable, and partly  succeeded. That our efforts were not a complete success was due partly,  at least, to our early education and large stock of ideality, and we  were really not so much to blame.    The remainder of our journey was somewhat monotonous, broken only by  drunken brawls at midnight on deck, waking us from sound slumbers; or  the sight of a whale spouting during the day. Sometimes a breeze would  spring up from the wrong direction, rolling us for a few hours, causing  us to prefer a reclining posture instead of an upright one, and giving  our complexions a still deeper lemonish cast; sometimes we were well  inclined to feed the fishes in the sea, and did not; but at all times we  were thankful that matters were no worse.    Then, after many days out from Unalaska we began to look for land.  Seagulls and goonies had followed in the wake of our ship, and rested  themselves each day aloft in the rigging. Sails were now and then seen  in the distance, like the spreading white wings of enormous swans  gliding quietly over the bosom of the deep, and we realized that we were  nearing land. In the darkness one night there came to us a little white  boat containing three men,--one was a pilot to guide us safely through  the beautiful Golden Gate; the light on Point Bonita was sighted--we  were almost home.    We were now six weeks out from Dawson and twenty-one days from Nome; we  had no storms, accidents or deaths on board, and carried five hundred  passengers, as well as three million dollars in gold. I had been away  from home four months without a day's illness, and during my trip  through Alaska had traveled seventy-five hundred miles, nearly one-half  of this distance alone.    [Illustration: UNALASKA.]          CHAPTER VII.    GOING TO NOME.      One beautiful day in the spring of 1900 I sailed again for Alaska--this  time for Nome from San Francisco. An English family consisting of the  mother, one son and a daughter were to accompany me, and we had spent  weeks in making our preparations. We were taking supplies of clothing,  food, tents and bedding sufficient to last until some of our numerous  plans of work after our arrival brought in returns. My hope was to meet  my father there, for he had written that he thought he should go to the  new gold fields, where he could do beach mining.    I was not above doing any honest work, and felt confident that I could  make my way if I could gain an entrance into that country. The English  people were all workers, and I had known them for ten years or more.    Our steamer was the good ship \"St. Paul,\" belonging to the Alaska  Commercial Company, and was advertised to sail on May twenty-fifth. When  I laughingly called the attention of one of the owners of the ship to  the fact that that date fell upon Friday, and many persons objected to  sailing upon that day, he postponed the starting of the \"St. Paul\" to  May twenty-sixth, and we left the dock on Saturday afternoon amid the  cheers and hand-waving of thousands of people who had come to see the  big boat off for Nome.    The steamer was well fitted out, spick and span in fresh carpets and  paint, and crowded to the utmost capacity for comfort. Every stateroom  was full; each seat at the tables occupied. Not a foot of space above or  below decks was left unused, but provision was made for all, and the  ship was well manned.    I was now much gratified to learn that there were many on board whom I  had met before; that the steward, stewardess and several of the waiters  had been on duty on the steamer \"Bertha\" during my trip out from Alaska  the fall before, while I was upon speaking terms with a dozen or more of  the passengers with whom I had traveled from the same place. Of  passengers we had, all told, four hundred and eighty-seven. Of these  thirty-five were women. There was only one child on board, and that was  the little black-eyed girl with her Eskimo mother and white father from  Golovin Bay whom I had seen at St. Michael some months before, and who  was now going back to her northern home. She wore a sailor suit of navy  blue serge, trimmed with white braid, and was as coy and cunning as  ever, not speaking often to strangers, but laughing and running away to  her mother when addressed.    From the day we sailed from San Francisco until we reached Nome I missed  no meals in the dining salon, a pace which my English friends and others  could not follow, for they were uncomfortably ill in the region of their  digestive apparatus for several days. I slept for hours each day and  thoroughly enjoyed the trip.    During the nine days' sail from San Francisco to Unalaska, a distance of  two thousand three hundred and sixty-eight miles, I studied well the  passengers. We had preachers on board, as well as doctors, lawyers,  merchants and miners, and there were women going to Nome to start eating  houses, hotels and mercantile shops. There were several Swedish  missionaries; one, a zealous young woman from San Francisco, going to  the Swedish Mission at Golovin Bay.    This young person was pretty and pleasant, and I was glad to make her  acquaintance as well as that of three other women speaking the same  tongue and occupying the next stateroom to mine. The last named were  going to start a restaurant in Nome. As they were sociable, jolly, and  good sailors for the most part, I enjoyed their society. They had all  lived in San Francisco for years, and though not related to each other,  were firm friends of long standing and were uniting their little  fortunes in the hope of making greater ones.    The young missionary was a friend to the other three, and I found no  better or more congenial companions on board the ship than these four  honest, hard-working women, so full of hope, courage and good sense as  well as Christianity. Little did I then think that these people, placed  by a seeming chance in an adjoining stateroom, were to be my  fellow-workers and true friends, not only for the coming months in that  Arctic land to which we were going, but, as the sequel will show,  perhaps for years to come.    Not many days had passed when we found that we had on board what few  steamers can boast of, and that was an orchestra of professional  musicians among the waiters. These were men going, with all the others,  to seek their fortunes in the new gold fields, working their passage as  waiters on the ship to Nome, where they intended to leave it. Three  evenings in the week these musicians, with the help of several singers  on board, gave concerts in the dining salon, which, though impromptu,  were very enjoyable.    A sweet and trained singer was the English girl of our company, and she  sang many times, accompanied by the stringed instruments of the  musicians, much to the delight of the assembled passengers. When she  sang, one evening, in her clear sympathetic voice the selection, \"Oh,  Where Is My Wandering Boy Tonight,\" there was not a dry eye in the room,  and the mind of many a man went back to his old home and praying mother  in some far distant state, making him resolve to write oftener to her  that she might be comforted with a knowledge of his whereabouts and  welfare. These evenings were sometimes varied by recitations from an  elocutionist on board; and a practised clog dancer excited the risibles  of the company to the extent that they usually shouted with laughter at  his exhibition of flying heels.    Day after day passed. Those who were continually seasick had diversion  enough. It was useless for us to tell them a pathetic tale of some one,  who, at some time, had been more ill than they, because they would not  believe a word of it, and it was equally useless to recommend an  antidote for mal de mer such as theirs. \"No one was ever so ill before,\"  they said. They knew they should die and be buried at sea, and hoped  they would if that would put an end to their sufferings. We tried at  last to give them comfort by recommending out of former experiences  ship's biscuit, dry toast and pop-corn as remedies, but only received  black looks as our reward. We then concluded that a diet of tea, coffee  and soup was exactly such a one as the fishes would recommend could they  speak, these favorite and much used liquids keeping up a continual  \"swishing\" in one's interior regions, and causing one to truthfully  speak of the same as \"infernal\" instead of internal. But they were all  tree physical as well as free moral agents and decided these things for  themselves.    At last we entered the Japan current and the weather was warmer and  more enjoyable. On Monday, June fourth, we saw from the deck a few  drifting logs and a quantity of seaweed, and these, with the presence of  gulls and goonies flying overhead, convinced us that we were nearing  land.    We were not mistaken. After eating an excellent six o'clock dinner we  went above to find ourselves between high, rocky cliffs, which loomed up  into mountains not far distant, and we "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22420"],[0,"The Book of Nature Myths (#10)"],[1," can no longer see your face.\"    The clouds grew darker and fell like a cloak over the mountain, the  trees trembled in the wind, the forked lightning shot across the sky,  and the thunder called aloud.    \"It is the anger of the manito,\" cried the people. \"The heavens are  falling,\" they whispered, and they hid their faces in fear.    Morning came, the storm had gone, and the sky was clear. Tremblingly the  people looked up toward the mountain top for the face of the manito. It  was not there, but after they had long gazed in sorrow, a wise man  cried, \"There it is, where no cloud will hide it from us.\" In the storm  the rocks had fallen from the mountain top. They were halfway down the  mountain side, and in them could be seen the face of the manito.    Then the people cried, \"Praise to the good manito! His loving face will  look down upon us from the mountain side forever-more.\"    For a long time all went well, but at last trouble came, for they heard  that a great tribe were on the war-path coming to kill them. \"Help us,  dear manito,\" they cried but there was no help. The warriors came nearer  and nearer. Their war-cry was heard, \"O manito,\" called the people,  \"help us, help us!\" A voice from the mountain answered, \"My children, be  not afraid.\" The war-cry was still, and when the people looked, for the  warriors, they were nowhere to be seen. The people gazed all around, and  at last one of the wise men cried, \"There they are, there they are!\"    They were at the foot of the mountain, but the people no longer feared  them, for now they were not warriors but rocks. To keep from harm those  whom he loved, the manito had made the warriors into stone. They stood  at the foot of the mountain, and to-day, if you should go to that  far-away country, you could see the rocks that were once warriors, and  above them, halfway up the mountain side, you could see the face of the  manito.          THE STORY OF THE FIRST DIAMONDS.      The chief of an Indian tribe had two sons whom he loved very dearly.  This chief was at war with another tribe, and one dark night two of his  enemies crept softly through the trees till they came to where the two  boys lay sound asleep. The warriors caught the younger boy up gently,  and carried him far away from his home and his friends.    When the chief woke, he cried, \"Where is my son? My enemies have been  here and have stolen him.\"    All the Indians in the tribe started out in search of the boy. They  roamed the forest through and through, but the stolen child could not be  found.    The chief mourned for his son, and when the time of his death drew near,  he said to his wife, \"Moneta, my tribe shall have no chief until my boy  is found and taken from our enemies. Let our oldest son go forth in  search of his brother, and until he has brought back the little one, do  you rule my people.\"    Moneta ruled the people wisely and kindly. When the older son was a man  she said to him, \"My son, go forth and search for your brother, whom I  have mourned these many years. Every day I shall watch for you, and  every night I shall build a fire on the mountain top.\"    \"Do not mourn, mother,\" said the young man. \"You will not build the fire  many nights on the mountain top, for I shall soon find my brother and  bring him back to you.\"    He went forth bravely, but he did not come back. His mother went every  night to the mountain top, and when she was so old that she could no  longer walk, the young men of the tribe bore her up the mountain side in  their strong arms, so that with her own trembling hand she could light  the fire.    One night there was a great storm. Even the brave warriors were afraid,  but Moneta had no fear, for out of the storm a gentle voice had come to  her that said, \"Moneta, your sons are coming home to you.\"    [Illustration]    \"Once more I must build the fire on the mountain top,\" she cried. The  young men trembled with fear, but they bore her to the top of the  mountain.    \"Leave me here alone,\" she said. \"I hear a voice. It is the voice of my  son, and he is calling, 'Mother, mother.' Come to me, come, my boys.\"    Coming slowly up the mountain in the storm was the older son. The  younger had died on the road home, and he lay dead in the arms of his  brother.    In the morning the men of the tribe went to the mountain top in search  of Moneta and her sons. They were nowhere to be seen, but where the  tears of the lonely mother had fallen, there was a brightness that had  never been seen before. The tears were shining in the sunlight as if  each one of them was itself a little sun. Indeed, they were no longer  tears, but diamonds.    The dearest thing in all the world is the tear of mother-love, and that  is why the tears were made into diamonds, the stones that are brightest  and clearest of all the stones on the earth.          THE STORY OF THE FIRST PEARLS.      There was once a man named Runoia, and when he walked along the pathways  of the forest, the children would say shyly to one another, \"Look, there  is the man who always hears music.\"    It was really true that wherever he went he could hear sweet music.  There are some kinds of music that every one can hear, but Runoia heard  sweet sounds where others heard nothing. When the lilies sang their  evening song to the stars, he could hear it, and when the mother tree  whispered \"Good-night\" to the little green leaves, he heard the music of  her whisper, though other men heard not a sound.    He was sorry for those other men, and he said to himself, \"I will make a  harp, and then even if they cannot hear all the kinds of music, they  will hear the sweet voice of the harp.\"    This must have been a magic harp, for if one else touched it, no sound  was heard, but when Runoia touched the strings, the trees bent down  their branches to listen, the little blossoms put their heads out shyly,  and even the wind was hushed. All kinds of beasts and birds came about  him as he played, and the sun and the moon stood still in the heavens to  hear the wonderful music. All these beautiful things happened whenever  Runoia touched the strings.    Sometimes Runoia's music was sad. Then the sun and the moon hid their  faces behind the clouds, the wind sang mournfully, and the lilies bent  low their snow-white blossoms.    One day Runoia roamed far away till he came to the shores of the great  sea. The sun had set, darkness hid the sky and the water, not a star was  to be seen. Not a sound was heard but the wailing of the sea. No friend  was near. \"I have no friends,\" he said. He laid his hand upon his harp,  and of themselves the strings gave forth sweet sounds, at first softly  and shyly. Then the sounds grew louder, and soon the world was full of  music, such as even Runoia had never heard before, for it was the music  of the gods. \"It is really true,\" he said to himself softly. \"My harp is  giving me music to drive away my sadness.\"    [Illustration]    He listened, and the harp played more and more sweetly. \"He who has a  harp has one true friend. He who loves music is loved by the gods,\" so  the harp sang to him.    Tears came into Runoia's eyes, but they were tears of happiness, not of  sadness, for he was no longer lonely. A gentle voice called, \"Runoia,  come to the home of the gods.\"    As darkness fell over the sea, Runoia's friends went to look for him. He  was gone, but where he had stood listening happily to the music of the  gods, there on the fair white sand was the harp, and all around it lay  beautiful pearls, shining softly in the moonlight, for every tear of  happiness was now a pearl.          THE STORY OF THE FIRST EMERALDS.      In the days of long ago there was a time when there were no emeralds on  the earth. Men knew where to find other precious stones. They could get  pearls and diamonds, but no one had ever seen an emerald, because the  emeralds were hidden away in the bed of the sea, far down below the  waves.    The king of India had many precious things, and he was always eager to  get others. One day a stranger stood before his door, and when the king  came out he cried, \"O king, you have much that is precious. Do you wish  to have the most beautiful thing in earth, air, or water?\"    \"Yes, in truth,\" said the king. \"What is it?\"    \"It is a vase made of an emerald stone,\" answered the stranger.    \"And what is an emerald stone?\" asked the king.    \"It is a stone that no one on earth has ever seen,\" said the stranger.  \"It is greener than the waves of the sea or the leaves of the forest.\"    \"Where is the wonderful vase?\" cried the king eagerly.    \"Where the waves of the sea never roll,\" was the answer, but when the  king was about to ask where that was, the stranger had gone.    The king asked his three wise men where it was that the waves of the sea  never rolled. One said, \"In the forest;\" another said, \"On the  mountain;\" and the last said, \"In the sea where the water is deepest.\"    The king thought a long time about these answers of the wise men. At  last he said: \"If the emerald vase had been in the forest or on the  mountain, it would have been found long before now. I think it is in the  deepest water of the sea.\"    This king of India was a great magician. He went to the sea, and there  he sang many a magical song, for he said to himself, \"I have no diver  who can go to the bed of the sea, but often magic will do what a diver  cannot.\"    The king of the world under the water owned the beautiful vase, but when  he heard the songs, he knew that he must give it up. \"Take it,\" he said  to the spirits that live in the deepest water. \"Bear it to the king of  India. The spirits of the air will try to take it from you, but see that  it goes safely to the king whose magic has called it from the sea.\"    The spirits of the sea rose from the waves bearing the precious vase.    \"It is ours, it is ours,\" cried the spirits of the air. \"The king of  India shall never have it.\" The spirits of "]]]
