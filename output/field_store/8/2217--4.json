(We had no gun.) Presently, through the thick brushy growth, we caught  sight of a small animal running along, that we at first took for a red  squirrel. A moment more, and it came into full view but a few yards from  us, and we saw that it was a weasel. A second glance showed that it  carried something in its mouth which, as it drew near, we saw was a  mouse or a mole of some sort. The weasel ran nimbly along, now the  length of a decayed log, then over stones and branches, pausing a moment  every three or four yards, and passed within twenty feet of us, and  disappeared behind some rocks on the bank at the edge of the swamp. \"He  is carrying food into his den,\" I said; \"let us watch him.\" In four or  five minutes he reappeared, coming back over the course along which he  had just passed, running over and under the same stones and down the  same decayed log, and was soon out of sight in the swamp. We had not  moved, and evidently he had not noticed us. After about six minutes we  heard the same rustle as at first, and in a moment saw the weasel coming  back with another mouse in his mouth. He kept to his former route as if  chained to it, making the same pauses and gestures, and repeating  exactly his former movements. He disappeared on our left as before, and,  after a few moments' delay, reemerged and took his course down into the  swamp again. We waited about the same length of time as before, when  back he came with another mouse. He evidently had a big crop of mice  down there amid the bogs and bushes, and he was gathering his harvest in  very industriously. We became curious to see exactly where his den was,  and so walked around where he had seemed to disappear each time, and  waited. He was as punctual as usual, and was back with his game exactly  on time. It happened that we had stopped within two paces of his hole,  so that, as he approached it, he evidently discovered us. He paused,  looked steadily at us, and then, without any sign of fear, entered his  den. The entrance was not under the rocks as we had expected to find it,  but was in the bank a few feet beyond them. We remained motionless for  some time, but he did not reappear. Our presence had made him  suspicious, and he was going to wait a while. Then I removed some dry  leaves and exposed his doorway, a small, round hole, hardly as large as  the chipmunk makes, going straight down into the ground. We had a lively  curiosity to get a peep into his larder. If he had been carrying in mice  at this rate very long, his cellars must be packed with them. With a  sharp stick I began digging into the red clayey soil, but soon  encountered so many roots from near trees that I gave it up, deciding to  return next day with a mattock. So I repaired the damages I had done as  well as I could, replacing the leaves, and we moved off.    [Illustration: WEASEL]    The next day, which was mild and still, I came back prepared, as I  thought, to unearth the weasel and his treasures. I sat down where we  had sat the day before and awaited developments. I was curious to know  if the weasel was still carrying in his harvest. I had sat but a few  minutes when I heard again the rustle in the dry leaves, and saw the  weasel coming home with another mouse. I observed him till he had made  three trips; about every six or seven minutes, I calculated, he brought  in a mouse. Then I went and stood near his hole. This time he had a fat  meadow-mouse. He laid it down near the entrance, went in and turned  around, and reached out and drew the mouse in after him. That store of  mice I am bound to see, I thought, and then fell to with the heavy  mattock. I followed the hole down about two feet, when it turned to the  north. I kept the clue by thrusting into the passage slender twigs;  these it was easy to follow. Two or three feet more and the hole  branched, one part going west, the other northeast. I followed the west  one a few feet till it branched. Then I turned to the easterly tunnel,  and pursued it till it branched. I followed one of these ways till it  divided. I began to be embarrassed and hindered by the accumulations of  loose soil. Evidently this weasel had foreseen just such an assault upon  his castle as I was making, and had planned it accordingly. He was not  to be caught napping. I found several enlargements in the various  tunnels, breathing spaces, or spaces to turn around in, or to meet and  chat with a companion, but nothing that looked like a terminus, a  permanent living-room. I tried removing the soil a couple of paces away  with the mattock, but found it slow work. I was getting warm and tired,  and my task was apparently only just begun. The farther I dug, the more  numerous and intricate became the passages. I concluded to stop, and  come again the next day, armed with a shovel in addition to the mattock.    Accordingly, I came back on the morrow, and fell to work vigorously. I  soon had quite a large excavation; I found the bank a labyrinth of  passages, with here and there a large chamber. One of the latter I  struck only six inches under the surface, by making a fresh breach a few  feet away.    While I was leaning upon my shovel-handle and recovering my breath, I  heard some light-footed creature tripping over the leaves above me just  out of view, which I fancied might be a squirrel. Presently I heard the  bay of a hound and the yelp of a cur, and then knew that a rabbit had  passed near me. The dogs came hurrying after, with a great rumpus, and  then presently the hunters followed. The dogs remained barking not many  rods south of me on the edge of the swamp, and I knew the rabbit had run  to hole. For half an hour or more I heard the hunters at work there,  digging their game out; then they came along and discovered me at my  work. They proved to be an old trapper and woodsman and his son. I told  them what I was in quest of. \"A mountain weasel,\" said the old man.  \"Seven or eight years ago I used to set deadfalls for rabbits just over  there, and the game was always partly eaten up. It must have been this  weasel that visited my traps.\" So my game was evidently an old resident  of the place. This swamp, maybe, had been his hunting-ground for many  years, and he had added another hall to his dwelling each year. After  further digging, I struck at least one of his banqueting halls, a cavity  about the size of one's hat, arched over by a network of fine  tree-roots. The occupant evidently lodged or rested here also. There was  a warm, dry nest, made of leaves and the fur of mice and moles. I took  out two or three handfuls. In finding this chamber I had followed one of  the tunnels around till it brought me within a foot of the original  entrance. A few inches to one side of this cavity there was what I took  to be a back alley where the weasel threw his waste; there were large  masses of wet, decaying fur here, and fur pellets such as are  regurgitated by hawks and owls. In the nest there was the tail of a  flying squirrel, showing that the weasel sometimes had this game for  supper or dinner.    I continued my digging with renewed energy; I should yet find the grand  depot where all these passages centred; but the farther I excavated, the  more complex and baffling the problem became; the ground was honeycombed  with passages. What enemy has this weasel, I said to myself, that he  should provide so many ways of escape, that he should have a back door  at every turn? To corner him would be impossible; to be lost in his  fortress was like being lost in Mammoth Cave. How he could bewilder his  pursuer by appearing now at this door, now at that; now mocking him from  the attic, now defying him from the cellar! So far, I had discovered but  one entrance; but some of the chambers were so near the surface that it  looked as if the planner had calculated upon an emergency when he might  want to reach daylight quickly in a new place.    Finally I paused, rested upon my shovel a while, eased my aching back  upon the ground, and then gave it up, feeling as I never had before the  force of the old saying, that you cannot catch a weasel asleep. I had  made an ugly hole in the bank, had handled over two or three times a ton  or more of earth, and was apparently no nearer the weasel and his store  of mice than when I began.    Then I regretted that I had broken into his castle at all; that I had  not contented myself with coming day after day and counting his mice as  he carried them in, and continued my observation upon him each  succeeding year. Now the rent in his fortress could not be repaired, and  he would doubtless move away, as he most certainly did, for his doors,  which I had closed with soil, remained unopened after winter had set in.    But little seems known about the intimate private lives of any of our  lesser wild creatures. It was news to me that any of the weasels lived  in dens in this way, and that they stored up provision against a day of  need. This species was probably the little ermine, eight or nine inches  long, with tail about five inches. It was still in its summer dress of  dark chestnut-brown above and whitish below.    It was a mystery where the creature had put the earth which it must have  removed in digging its den; not a grain was to be seen anywhere, and yet  a bushel or more must have been taken out. Externally, there was not the  slightest sign of that curious habitation there under the ground. The  entrance was hidden beneath dry leaves, and was surrounded by little  passages and flourishes between the leaves and the ground. If any of my  readers find a weasel's den, I hope they will be wiser than I was, and  observe his goings and comings without disturbing his habitation.    A few years later I had another adventure with a weasel that had its den  in a bank on the margin of "]]]
