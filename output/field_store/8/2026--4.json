The miller, therefore, takes toll of the grist, which is another source  of seignorial revenue, although not a very great one, for the toll is,  excepting the miller's thumb rights, not very large.    The crown of England is the lord paramount or suzerain, and demands a  tax of one fifth of the purchase-money of each seignory sold or  transferred by the lord of the manor.    By law, the lands cannot be subdivided, and if a seigneurie is sold it  cannot be sold in parts, nor can any compromise with the habitants for  rent, or any other claim or incumbrance, be made.    An institution like this paralyzes the resident, paralyzes the settler,  and destroys that aristocracy for whose benefit it was created; for it  prevents the lord of the manor from ever becoming rich, or taking much  interest in the improvement of his domain; and thus every thing  continues as it was a hundred years ago. The British emigrant pauses ere  he buys land thus enthralled; and almost all the old French families,  who dated from Charlemagne, Clovis, or Pepin, from the Merovingian or  Carlovingian monarchies, have disappeared and dwindled away, and their  places have been supplied by the more enterprising, or the _nouveau  riche_ men of the old world, or by restless, acute lawyers, and  metaphysical body-curers.    It was no wonder, therefore, that, upon the removal of the seat of  government from Toronto, and the appointment of a governor-general  untrammelled by the lieutenant governorship of Western Canada, over  which he had had before no control, that it should be considered  desirable by degrees to introduce the English land system throughout  Canada, and that parliamentary inquiry should be made into the necessity  of abolishing all feudal taxation. In Montreal this has been done, and,  as the seignoral rights of succession lapse, it will soon be done every  where, for the recent enactments have emancipated many already.    But no sensible or feeling mind will desire to see the French Canadian  driven to break up all at once habits formed by ages of contentment;  and, as it does not press upon them beyond their ready endurance, why  should we, to please a few rich capitalists or merchants, suddenly force  a British population into the heart of French Canada?    Jean Baptiste is too good a fellow to desire this. On our part, we  should not forget his truly amiable character; we should not forget the  services he rendered to us, when our children fought to drive us from  our last hold on the North American continent; we should not forget his  worthy and excellent priesthood; nor should we ever lose sight of the  fact, that he is contented under the old system. Above all, we should  never forget that he fought our battles when his Gallic sires joined our  revolted children.    I feel persuaded that, if an unhappy war must take place between the  United States and England, the French Canadians will prove, as they did  before on a similar occasion, loyal to a man.    All animosity, all heart-burning, will be forgotten, and the old French  glory will shine again, as it did under De Salaberry.    Ma foi, nous ne sommes pas perdus, encore; and some hero of the war has  only to rouse himself and cry, as Roland did,      Suivez, mon panage eclatant,    Francais ainsi que ma banniere;    Qu'il soit point du ralliement,    Vous savez tous quel prix attend    Le brave, qui dans la carriere,    Marche sur le pas de Roland.    Mourons pour notre patrie    C'est le sort le plus beau et le plus digne d'envie.          CHAPTER III.      A journey to the Westward.      We must leave Roncesvalles and La Gloire awhile, and, instead of riding  a war horse, canter along upon the hobby, or a good serviceable Canadian  pony, the best of all hobbies for seeing the Canadian world, and on  which mettlesome charger we can much better instruct the emigrant than  by long prosings about political economy and systematic colonisation.    So, _en avant_! I am going to relate the incidents of a journey last  summer to the Westward, and to give all the substance of my observations  on men and things made therein.    I left Kingston on the 26th of June, in the Princess Royal mail steamer,  at 8 p.m., the usual hour of starting being seven, for Toronto; the  weather unusually cold.    This fine boat constitutes, with two others, the City of Toronto and the  Sovereign, the royal mail line between Kingston and Toronto. All are  built nearly alike, are first class seaboats, and low pressure; they  combine, with the Highlander, the Canada, and the Gildersleave, also  splendid vessels, to form a mail route to Montreal--the latter boats  taking the mail as far as Coteau du Lac, forty-five miles from Montreal,  on which route a smaller vessel, the Chieftain, plies, wherein you  sleep, at anchor, or rather moored, till daylight, if going down, or  going upwards, on board the mail boat.    Passengers go from Montreal to Kingston by the mail route in twenty-four  hours, a distance of 180 miles; a small portion, between the Cascades  Rapids and the Coteau being traversed in a coach, on a planked road as  smooth as a billiard-table.    From Kingston to Toronto, or nearly the whole length of Lake Ontario,  takes sixteen hours, the boat leaving at seven, and arriving about or  before noon next day; performing the passage at the rate of eleven miles  an hour, exclusively of stoppages.    The transit between Montreal and Kingston is at the rate, including  stoppage for daylight, the river being dangerous, of eight miles an  hour; thus, in forty hours, the passenger passes from the seat of  government to the largest city of Western Canada most comfortably, a  journey which twenty years ago it always took a fortnight, and often a  month, to accomplish, in the most precarious and uncomfortable  manner--on board small, roasting steamers, crowded like a cattle-pen--in  lumbering leathern conveniences, miscalled coaches, over roads which  enter not into the dreams of Britons--by canoes--by bateaux, (a sort of  coal barges,)--by schooners, where the cabin could never permit you to  display either your length, your breadth, or your thickness, and thus  reducing you to a point in creation, according to Euclid and his  commentators.    Your _compagnons de voyage_, on board a bateau or Durham boat, which was  a _monstre_ bateau, were French Canadian voyageurs, always drunk and  always gay, who poled you along up the rapids, or rushed down them with  what will be will be.    These happy people had a knack of examining your goods and chattels,  which they were conveying in the most admirable manner, and with the  utmost _sang-froid_; but still they were above stealing--they only  tapped the rum cask or the whiskey barrel, and appropriated any cordage  wherewith you bound your chests and packages. I never had a chest, box,  or bale sent up by bateau or Durham boat that escaped this rope mail.    By the by, the Durham boat, a long decked barge, square ahead, and  square astern, has vanished; Ericson's screw-propellers have crushed it.  It was neither invented by nor named after Lord Durham, but was as  ancient as Lambton House itself.    The way the conductors of these boats found out vinous liquors was, as  brother Jonathan so playfully observes, a _caution_.    I have known an instance of a cask of wine, which, for security from  climate, had an outer case or cask strongly secured over it, with an  interior space for neutralizing frost or heat, bored so carefully that  you could never discover how it had been effected, and a very  considerable quantum of beverage extracted.    I once had a small barrel, perhaps twenty gallons of commissariat West  India ration rum, the best of all rum for liqueurs, sucked dry. Of  course, it had leaked, but I never could discover the leak, and it held  any liquid very well afterwards.    I know the reader likes a story, and as this is not by any means an  historical or scientific work, excepting always the geological portion  thereof, I will tell him or her, as the case may be, a story about  ration rum.    There was a funny fellow, an Irish auctioneer at Kingston, some years  ago, called Paddy Moran, whom all the world, priest and parson, minister  and methodist, soldier and sailor, tinker and tailor, went to hear when  he mounted his rostrum.    He was selling the goods of a quarter-master-general who was leaving the  place. At last he came to the cellar and the rum. \"Now, gintlemin,\" says  Moran, \"I advise you to buy this rum, 7s. 6d. a gallon! going, going!  Gintlemin, I was once a sojer--don't laugh, you officers there, for I  was--and a sirjeant into the bargain. It wasn't in the Irish  militia--bad luck to you, liftenant, for laughing that way, it will  spoil the rum! I was the tip-top of the sirjeants of the regiment--long  life to it! Yes, I was quarter-master-sirjeant, and hadn't I the sarving  out of the rations; and didn't I know what good ration rum was; and  didn't I help meself to the prime of it! Well, then, gintlemin and  ladies--I mane, Lord save yees, ladies and gintlemin--if a  quarter-master-sirjeant in the army had good rum, what the devil do you  think a quarter-master-general gets?\"    The rum rose to fifteen shillings per gallon at the next bid.    You can have every convenience on board a Lake Ontario mail-packet,  which is about as large as a small frigate, and has the usual sea  equipment of masts, sails, and iron rigging. The fare is five dollars in  the cabin, or about L1 sterling; and two dollars in the steerage. In the  former you have tea and breakfast, in the latter nothing but what is  bought at the bar. By paying a dollar extra you may have a state-room on  deck, or rather on the half-deck, where you find a good bed, a large  looking-glass, washing-stand and towels, and a night-lamp, if required.

It is only a pencil outline, by Edward Burne-Jones, in  illustration of the story of Psyche; it is the introduction of Psyche,  after all her troubles, into heaven.    Now in this of Burne-Jones, the landscape is clearly full of light  everywhere, color or glass light: that is, the outline is prepared  for modification of color only. Every plant in the grass is set  formally, grows perfectly, and may be realized completely. Exquisite  order, and universal, with eternal life and light, this is the faith  and effort of the schools of Crystal; and you may describe and  complete their work quite literally by taking any verses of Chaucer in  his tender mood, and observing how he insists on the clearness and  brightness first, and then on the order. Thus, in Chaucer's \"Dream\":         \"Within an yle me thought I was,       Where wall and yate was all of glasse,       And so was closed round about       That leavelesse none come in ne out,       Uncouth and straunge to beholde,       For every yate of fine golde       A thousand fanes, aie turning,       Entuned had, and briddes singing       Divers, and on each fane a paire       With open mouth again here;       And of a sute were all the toures       Subtily corven after floures,       Of uncouth colors during aye       That never been none seene in May.\"    93. Next to this drawing of Psyche I place two of Turner's most  beautiful classical landscapes. At once you are out of the open  daylight, either in sunshine admitted partially through trembling  leaves, or in the last rays of its setting, scarcely any more warm on  the darkness of the ilex wood. In both, the vegetation, though  beautiful, is absolutely wild and uncared for, as it seems, either by  human or by higher powers, which, having appointed for it the laws of  its being, leave it to spring into such beauty as is consistent with  disease and alternate with decay.    [Illustration: AESACUS AND HESPERIE.    From the painting by Turner.]    In the purest landscape, the _human_ subject is the immortality of the  soul by the faithfulness of love: in both the Turner landscapes it is  the death of the body by the impatience and error of love. The one is  the first glimpse of Hesperia to AEsacus:[13]         \"Aspicit Hesperien patria Cebrenida ripa,       Injectos humeris siccantem sole capillos:\"    in a few moments to lose her forever. The other is a mythological  subject of deeper meaning, the death of Procris.    [Footnote 13: Ovid, \"Metamorphoses,\" XI. 769.]    94. I just now referred to the landscape by John Bellini in the  National Gallery as one of the six best existing of the purist school,  being wholly felicitous and enjoyable. In the foreground of it indeed  is the martyrdom of Peter Martyr; but John Bellini looks upon that as  an entirely cheerful and pleasing incident; it does not disturb or  even surprise him, much less displease in the slightest degree.    Now, the next best landscape[14] to this, in the National Gallery, is  a Florentine one on the edge of transition to the Greek feeling; and  in that the distance is still beautiful, but misty, not clear; the  flowers are still beautiful, but--intentionally--of the color of  blood; and in the foreground lies the dead body of Procris, which  disturbs the poor painter greatly; and he has expressed his disturbed  mind about it in the figure of a poor little brown--nearly  black--Faun, or perhaps the god Faunus himself, who is much puzzled by  the death of Procris, and stoops over her, thinking it a woeful thing  to find her pretty body lying there breathless, and all spotted with  blood on the breast.    [Footnote 14: (Of the Purist school.)]    95. You remember I told you how the earthly power that is necessary in  art was shown by the flight of Daedalus to the [Greek: herpeton] Minos.  Look for yourselves at the story of Procris as related to Minos in the  fifteenth chapter of the third book of Apollodorus; and you will see  why it is a Faun who is put to wonder at her, she having escaped by  artifice from the Bestial power of Minos. Yet she is wholly an  earth-nymph, and the son of Aurora must not only leave her, but  himself slay her; the myth of Semele desiring to see Zeus, and of  Apollo and Coronis, and this having all the same main interest. Once  understand that, and you will see why Turner has put her death under  this deep shade of trees, the sun withdrawing his last ray; and why he  has put beside her the low type of an animal's pain, a dog licking its  wounded paw.    96. But now, I want you to understand Turner's depth of sympathy  farther still. In both these high mythical subjects the surrounding  nature, though suffering, is still dignified and beautiful. Every line  in which the master traces it, even where seemingly negligent, is  lovely, and set down with a meditative calmness which makes these two  etchings capable of being placed beside the most tranquil work of  Holbein or Duerer. In this \"Cephalus\" especially, note the extreme  equality and serenity of every outline. But now here is a subject of  which you will wonder at first why Turner drew it at all. It has no  beauty whatsoever, no specialty of picturesqueness; and all its lines  are cramped and poor.    The crampness and the poverty are all intended. This is no longer to  make us think of the death of happy souls, but of the labor of unhappy  ones; at least, of the more or less limited, dullest, and--I must not  say homely, but--unhomely life of the neglected agricultural poor.    It is a gleaner bringing down her one sheaf of corn to an old  watermill, itself mossy and rent, scarcely able to get its stones to  turn. An ill-bred dog stands, joyless, by the unfenced stream; two  country boys lean, joyless, against a wall that is half broken down;  and all about the steps down which the girl is bringing her sheaf, the  bank of earth, flowerless and rugged, testifies only of its malignity;  and in the black and sternly rugged etching--no longer graceful, but  hard, and broken in every touch--the master insists upon the ancient  curse of the earth--\"Thorns also and Thistles shall it bring forth to  thee.\"    97. And now you will see at once with what feeling Turner completes,  in a more tender mood, this lovely subject of his Yorkshire stream, by  giving it the conditions of pastoral and agricultural life; the cattle  by the pool, the milkmaid crossing the bridge with her pail on her  head, the mill with the old millstones, and its gleaming weir as his  chief light led across behind the wild trees.    [Illustration: MILL NEAR GRANDE CHARTREUSE.    From the painting by Turner.]    98. And not among our soft-flowing rivers only; but here among the  torrents of the Great Chartreuse, where another man would assuredly  have drawn the monastery, Turner only draws their working mill. And  here I am able to show you, fortunately, one of his works painted at  this time of his most earnest thought; when his imagination was still  freshly filled with the Greek mythology, and he saw for the first time  with his own eyes the clouds come down upon the actual earth.    [Illustration: L'AIGUILLETTE, VALLEY OF CLUSES.    From the painting by Turner.]    99. The scene is one which, in old times of Swiss traveling, you would  all have known well; a little cascade which descends to the road from  Geneva to Chamouni, near the village of Maglans, from under a  subordinate ridge of the Aiguille de Varens, known as the Aiguillette.  You, none of you, probably, know the scene now; for your only object  is to get to Chamouni and up Mont Blanc and down again; but the Valley  of Cluse, if you knew it, is worth many Chamounis; and it impressed  Turner profoundly. The facts of the spot are here given in mere and  pure simplicity; a quite unpicturesque bridge, a few trees partly  stunted and blasted by the violence of the torrent in storm at their  roots, a cottage with its mill-wheel--this has lately been pulled down  to widen the road--and the brook shed from the rocks and finding its  way to join the Arve. The scene is absolutely Arcadian. All the  traditions of the Greek Hills, in their purity, were founded on such  rocks and shadows as these; and Turner has given you the birth of the  Shepherd Hermes on Cyllene, in its visible and solemn presence, the  white cloud, Hermes Eriophoros forming out of heaven upon the Hills;  the brook, distilled from it, as the type of human life, born of the  cloud and vanishing into the cloud, led down by the haunting Hermes  among the ravines; and then, like the reflection of the cloud itself,  the white sheep, with the dog of Argus guarding them, drinking from  the stream.    100. And now, do you see why I gave you, for the beginning of your  types of landscape thought, that \"Junction of Tees and Greta\" in their  misty ravines; and this glen of the Greta above, in which Turner has  indeed done his best to paint the trees that live again after their  autumn--the twilight that will rise again with twilight of dawn--the  stream that flows always, and the resting on the cliffs of the  clouds that return if they vanish; but of human life, he says, a boy  climbing among the trees for his entangled kite, and these white  stones in the mountain churchyard, show forth all the strength and all  the end.    101. You think that saying of the Greek school--Pindar's summary of  it, \"[Greek: ti de tis; ti d'ou tis];\"[15]--a sorrowful and degrading  lesson. See at least, then, that you reach the level of such  degradation. See that your lives be in nothing worse than a boy's  climbing for his entangled kite. It will be well for you if you join  not with those who instead of kites fly falcons; who instead of  obeying the last words of the great Cloud-Shepherd--to feed his sheep,  live the lives--how much less than vanity!--of the war-wolf and the  gier-eagle. Or, do you think it a dishonor to man to say to him that  Death is but only Rest? See that when it draws"]]]
