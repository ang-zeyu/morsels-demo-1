Awaking at daylight, I went on deck to relieve the young men.  No sail  was in sight.  Once more we put the schooner on her proper course.  I  proposed touching on the western or southern coast of Australia for the  sake of obtaining grass or hay for the sheep, and water and fuel.  We  had found the importance of having a good supply of fuel.  I was no  longer anxious about the stranger, but still I knew that if he was bound  in the same direction that we were, owing to the uncertain winds and  calms, we might very possibly again fall in with him.  Still, he might  after all be a friend.  I would banish the subject from my mind.  I did  so.  In the next week we had fine weather and a fair breeze, till the  land, stretching away in the north, blue and indistinct, was seen on our  larboard bow.  We hauled up for it till we got near enough to  distinguish objects on shore.  I cannot say that the appearance of that  part of the new country which was to be our future home was at all  attractive.  Backs and sand-hills, and slight elevations covered with  dark green trees, were the only objects we could discern.  We could  obtain plenty of wood, but that we could find any water in that dry  looking country seemed very doubtful, even if we could manage to land.  We had all been so eagerly watching the coast, that for a long time no  one had turned their eyes to the southward; Mary, happening to do so,  exclaimed, \"Father, there's a sail in the horizon no bigger than my  hand, but I see it clearly.\"    Charley, on hearing this, sprang aloft with his glass.  He quickly  returned, and quietly remarked to me, \"A ship standing in for the land,  not unlike our friend of last week.\"    I agreed with him it would be prudent to avoid her.  The best way to do  this was to stand close in, so that our masts should not appear above  the land.  The shore was here higher and more broken than that which we  had before passed.    The stranger was drawing near, and judging from the cut of his sails I  had little doubt that he was a Frenchman.  Whether or not he saw us it  was hard to say; I was afraid he did, as he was steering a course which  would inevitably cut us off.  I still did not like to communicate my  fears to my wife and daughters.  It must be done soon I felt, for the  nearer the stranger drew the more convinced I was that he was French.  While we were watching our supposed enemy we did not neglect to look out  for a place of refuge, and we kept scanning the coast anxiously for any  opening into which we might run to hide ourselves.  My wife and  daughters suspected, from what they observed, that I did not like the  look of the stranger; and when at last I saw that it was no use  concealing from them what I suspected, Mary, I think it was, proposed  loading the boats with as many necessaries as they could carry, running  close in, and, having deserted the vessel, hiding ourselves in the woods  till our enemies had gone away.    Her sisters chimed in, and thought that it would not be at all  unpleasant to picnic in the woods for a few days, or perhaps settle  there altogether.  They little dreamed of the inhospitable character of  that part of the country; still I would say nothing to damp their  courage.  The breeze was fresh and from the south-west, and though it  brought up the stranger, it enabled us to stand close in shore with less  danger than if the wind had been dead on it.  As far as we could judge,  there was no opening to indicate a harbour or shelter of any sort.  The  big ship was approaching rapidly; I felt as if we were caught in a trap.  We had no choice now but to stand on; the wind was too much to the  westward to allow us to retrace our course, and so double on the  stranger.  I thought by this time that we must be seen.  We were small,  that was one thing; and another was, probably, that no one was looking  for us.  If not seen now, we should be in a few minutes; of that I felt  sure.  Again and again I examined the strange vessel, and became more  and more convinced that if not a government ship she was worse; one of  the large privateers which were known to infest the Indian seas, and  which occasionally made excursions to other regions.  They were  generally commanded by ruffians, and manned with desperadoes of all  nations--the scourings of the French galleys.  To fall into such hands  would be worse than death.  I cannot tell you what fearful suggestions  were offered to my mind.  To run the vessel in among the breakers, to  scuttle her, to set her on fire; anything seemed better than being  taken.    We stood on; the atmosphere was so clear that it seemed impossible to  escape the observation of the stranger.  Just then a line of white foam  appeared almost ahead.  It was, I judged, a reef extending from the  shore.  Hauling round it, I observed an indentation in the coast, the  first we had seen in that long, unbroken line of sandy shore.  I steered  towards it; an opening appeared; the lead was kept going; the wind  favoured us; we shortened sail, and in a few minutes brought up within a  high woody point, completely concealed from any vessel passing even  close outside.  As soon as the canvas was made snug, Charley and the  boys hurried on shore to watch the strange ship.  I followed them.  She  was steering it seemed for the very end of the reef.  It struck me that  perhaps she was looking for the very harbour in which we had brought up.  If so, after all our efforts to escape, we should fall into her power.  She drew closer and closer.  Could the entrance of our harbour be seen  from her deck?    \"She is a good way to the eastward of the reef,\" observed Charley.  \"Her  lead is going; she intends to bring up; she is looking for a harbour,  and probably this one.\"    \"She has missed it, though,\" observed Peter, \"see, she is standing on to  the eastward.\"    We remained on the height to which we had climbed, so hidden among the  trees, that even if glasses had been directed towards us we should not  have been seen.  The stranger stood on for about three miles, and then,  furling sails, brought up at the entrance of what we thought was perhaps  a harbour, from the appearance of the land about it.  Our hope was that  she would send her boats to examine the harbour, and that if she went in  we might put to sea late in the evening and escape her.  We were,  however, pretty safe in our present position, and we determined to  profit by it.    We divided for this purpose into three parties: one to search for water,  another to land the sheep, and a third to cut wood.    Charley and I set off to look for water.  No signs were to be seen near  where we landed.  To the west the country looked especially barren, and  we therefore agreed to go towards the east, although it was in the  direction where the Frenchmen were supposed to be.  We first explored  the shore of the harbour, but found no stream running into it.  Indeed  it was a mere inlet of the sea and of small extent.    An old settler would have had far less difficulty than we experienced in  discovering water, because he would have known exactly the sort of trees  to look out for, such as grow only on the banks of streams or water  holes.    \"What a fearfully arid country this is,\" I observed to Charley, \"I hope  the part we are going to is not like it.\"    We were about to turn back in despair, when my companion, who was a  little ahead, exclaimed that he saw some water just below us.  We were  not long in reaching a pure and clear pool or water-hole.  We slaked our  own thirst, but it was a long way to bring our sheep, while it would  have been nearly impossible to fill our casks from it.  We discovered,  however, that water ran into it, therefore it must have an outlet.  This  we discovered, and traced it down towards the sea.  Great was our  pleasure to find that it ran into a small harbour, where we could  quickly fill our casks.  We hastened back, and trusting to be able to  obtain as much as we required, brought a supply for the sheep from the  vessel.  We had as yet seen no natives; indeed, from the barren nature  of the country, I could scarcely believe that any could exist there.    There were animals, however, for at night the boys, who were watching  over the sheep, saw a creature approaching stealthily.    Mark fired, but missed, and then made chase.  The creature got off,  leaving some traces of blood seen in the morning.  It was a dingo, or  native dog.  Early next day, the weather being very fine, we went in the  boat with the casks to the small harbour we had discovered.  We had  brought some wooden pipes, and by placing them a little way up the  stream, we were able to conduct the water so as to fall over a rock  directly into the casks.  While the boys were filling them, I climbed to  a height at the mouth of the harbour.  There the masts of the French  ship were plainly discernible.  This did not give me much concern, but  directly afterwards I perceived, through my glass, a party of men coming  along the beach and rapidly approaching us.        CHAPTER NINE.    LAND, HURRAH!    I hurried back to the boat.  The casks were filled.  We got them in.  Should we remain in the harbour and try to conceal ourselves, or should  we boldly pull out with the certainty of being seen, but yet with the  possibility of getting back to the schooner and putting to sea before  the privateer's men could reach us.  We decided on the latter course,  not a moment was to be lost.  If we should succeed in getting out to sea  we should be safe; for with so large a number of her people on shore it  was not likely that the French ships would chase us.    \"Now, my lads, pull for life and liberty!\"  I exclaimed, as I took the  helm.  \"Gently at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2306"],[0,"Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings (#10)"],[1," de fattes' rabbit w'at I ever see,  but he bin dead too long.

OLD MR. RABBIT, HE'S A GOOD FISHERMAN    \"BRER RABBIT en Brer Fox wuz like some chilluns w'at I knows  un,\" said Uncle Remus, regarding the little boy, who had come to  hear another story, with an affectation of great solemnity. \"Bofe  un um wuz allers atter wunner nudder, a prankin' en a pesterin'  'roun', but Brer Rabbit did had some peace, kaze Brer Fox done  got skittish 'bout puttin' de clamps on Brer Rabbit.    \"One day, w'en Brer Rabbit, en Brer Fox, en Brer Coon, en Brer  B'ar, en a whole lot un um wuz clearin' up a new groun' fer ter  plant a roas'n'-year patch, de sun gun ter git sorter hot, en  Brer Rabbit he got tired; but he didn't let on, kaze he fear'd de  balance un um'd call 'im lazy, en he keep on totin' off trash en  pilin' up bresh, twel bimeby he holler out dat he gotter brier in  his han', en den he take'n slip off, en hunt fer cool place fer  ter res'.

XVII. MR. RABBIT NIBBLES UP THE BUTTER    '\"DE animils en de creeturs,\" said Uncle Remus, shaking his  coffee around in the bottom of his tin-cup, in order to gather up  all the sugar, 'dey kep' on gittin' mo' en mo' familious wid  wunner nudder, twel bimeby, 'twan't long 'fo' Brer Rabbit, en  Brer Fox, en Brer Possum got ter sorter bunchin' der perwishuns  tergedder in de same shanty. Atter w'ile de roof sorter 'gun ter  leak, en one day Brer Rabbit, en Brer Fox, en Brer Possum,  'semble fer ter see ef dey can't kinder patch her up. Dey had a  big day's work in front un um, en dey fotch der dinner wid um.  Dey lump de vittles up in one pile, en de butter w'at Brer Fox  brung, dey goes en puts in de spring-'ouse fer ter keep cool, en  den dey went ter wuk, en 'twan't long 'fo' Brer Rabbit's stummuck  'gun ter sorter growl en pester 'im.

Fus' news you know,  w'ile dey wuz all wukkin' long, Brer Rabbit raise his head quick  en fling his years forerd en holler out:    \"'Here I is.

You know how fokes  duz w'en dey gits whar people's a moanin'.\"    The little boy didn't know, fortunately for him, and Uncle Remus  went on:    \"Brer Fox en Brer Possum rustle roun', dey did, gittin out de  vittles, en bimeby Brer Fox, he say, sezee:    \"'Brer Possum, you run down ter de spring en fetch de butter, en  I'll sail 'roun' yer en set de table,' sezee.    \"Brer Possum, he lope off atter de butter, en dreckly here he  come lopin' back wid his years a trimblin' en his tongue a  hangin' out.
