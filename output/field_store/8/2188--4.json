In spite of the efforts of Don John, King of Portugal, to reap advantage  from the discovery of Columbus, Ferdinand and Isabella obtained from the  Pope a bull, making over the newly-discovered lands and all such others  as might be discovered to the crown of Castile.  The utmost exertions  were at once made to fit out a second expedition.  The affairs of the  New World were placed under the superintendence of Juan Rodrigues de  Foneseca, Archdeacon of Seville, who was finally appointed Patriarch of  the Indies.  He was a worldly man, malignant and vindictive.  He not  only wronged the early discoverers, but frequently impeded the progress  of their enterprises.  Other men of similar character were associated  with him.    A royal order was issued that all ships in the ports of Andalusia, with  their captains, pilots, and crews, should be held in readiness to serve  in the expedition.  Columbus and Foneseca were authorised to freight or  purchase any of those vessels they might think proper, and overcome them  by force if refused.    To provide for the expenses of the expedition, a royal revenue arising  from Church tithes was placed at the disposal of the treasurer Pincello,  and further funds were derived from the jewels and other valuables, the  sequestrated property of the unfortunate Jews, banished from the kingdom  according to the bigoted edict of the preceding year.  As the conversion  of the heathen was professed to be the grand object of this expedition,  twelve zealous and able ecclesiastics were directed to accompany it.  At  their head was Bernado Boyle, one of those subtle politicians of the  cloister who in those days glided into all temporal concerns.    The Indians Columbus had brought to Barcelona were baptised, the King,  Queen, and Prince Juan officiating as sponsors; and great hopes were  entertained that on their return to their native country they would  facilitate the introduction of Christianity among their countrymen.  One  of them, who remained in the household of Prince John, died not long  afterwards, the first of his nation who entered heaven, according to the  notion of a Spanish historian.    The Spanish monarchs were anxious for the speedy departure of the  expedition, on account of the proceedings of King John of Portugal, who  had prepared a large armament for the avowed object of an expedition to  Africa, its real destination being to seize upon the newly-discovered  countries.  Before, however, the Portuguese vessels sailed, the King was  compelled to sign a treaty by which the Papal line of partition was  moved to three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape de Verde  Islands.  The Spaniards might appropriate all countries to the west of  the line, the Portuguese to the east.  But no one appears to have  reflected that they must ultimately meet at the antipodes.    The Spanish fleet, consisting of three large ships of heavy burden, and  fourteen caravels, large and small, was rapidly got ready.  The number  of persons permitted to embark had been limited to a thousand, but so  many volunteers applied, that the number was increased to twelve  hundred, among whom were numerous cavaliers of the best families, eager  to acquire honour or obtain the gold supposed to abound in the Indies.    The best pilots of Spain, husbandmen, miners, carpenters, and other  mechanics, were engaged for the projected colony; horses, mules,  domestic animals of all kinds were shipped, as well as grain, seeds,  vines, sugar-canes, and saplings, and vast quantities of merchandise,  consisting of trinkets, beads, hawks' bells, and looking-glasses.    At dawn on the 25th of September the fleet set sail from the Bay of  Cadiz, and keeping wide of the coast of Portugal, stood south-west for  the Canaries, where it arrived on the ist of October.  After touching at  the Grand Canary, Columbus anchored on the 5th at Gomera, where he  obtained a supply of water, and also purchased calves, goats, sheep,  eight hogs, and a number of domestic fowls, these latter the progenitors  of those now found in abundance in the New World.  By sealed  instructions the commanders were ordered in case of separation to  rendezvous in the harbour of La Navidad, the residence of the cacique  Guacanagari.    After leaving Gomera Columbus steered considerably more to the southward  than in his first voyage, hoping to fall in with the islands of the  Caribs.    Being in the region of the trade winds, the breeze continued fair and  steady, while the sea was perfectly smooth.  As October drew on, they  were visited by showers and a storm, lasting, however, only four hours.  They were cheered during it by observing the lights of Saint Elmo, which  the ignorant mariners believed to be the body of the saint himself  holding lighted tapers as an assurance of safety.    How different was this voyage to the former!  Then tears and wailing  accompanied the unwilling seamen on board, and often and often, their  hearts failing them, they desired to turn back.  Now one and all pressed  on, eager to witness the wonders of the New World.  On the evening of  Saturday, the 2nd of November, Columbus was convinced, by the colour of  the sea and other signs, that he was drawing near the land, and  accordingly ordered a vigilant watch to be kept during the night.    On Sunday, at dawn, a lofty island was seen to the west, and as the  ships glided on, others rose to sight covered with forests, while  flights of parrots and other tropical birds passed from one to the  other.  To the first island seen, on account of the day on which it was  discovered, Columbus gave the name of Dominica, or Sunday Island.  On  the whole group the appellation of The Antilles was bestowed, because a  group so-called was supposed to exist off the coast of Asia, and  Columbus now fully believed that he had arrived at it, and that the  mainland was to be found at no great distance farther west.    Six beautiful islands were seen during the day, to one of which he gave  the name of Marigalante, the name of his ship.  It was overspread with  trees, some in full bloom, others laden with unknown fruits.    Sailing on to a larger island with a volcanic peak in the centre, they  saw a cataract, of prodigious height, descending from the mountain-side.  The Admiral called this island Guadaloupe, in fulfilment of a promise  to the monks of the convent of Guadaloupe in Estremadura to call some  newly-discovered place after it.    Landing here, the Spaniards visited a village, the inhabitants of which  fled, some leaving their children behind.  These were soothed by binding  hawks' bells and trinkets round their arms.  The huts were formed with  the trunks of trees, interwoven with twigs and branches, and thatched  with palm-leaves.  They were square, and each had its portico, one of  which was decorated with images of serpents tolerably well carved in  wood.  Hammocks of cotton netting were hung up, and their utensils were  formed of calabashes or earthenware.  There were great quantities of  cotton and many bows and arrows, as also domestic geese and large  parrots of blue, green, white, and scarlet plumage.    Here the Spaniards first met with the anana, or pineapple, with the  fragrance and flavour of which they were delighted.  In another house  was the sternpost of a vessel, probably part of a wreck driven across  from the coast of Africa.  The voyagers, however, were struck with  horror at the sight of what they took to be human bones and skulls,  convincing them that the island was inhabited by Caribs, supposed to be  cannibals.    Leaving this spot, Columbus sailed some miles along the coast.  The boat  landing succeeded in taking and bringing off a boy and several women.  From them he understood that this was one of the islands of the Caribs,  and that it was their custom to make descents on the neighbouring  islands, in order to carry off the youngest and best-looking women, and  to murder and eat the men.    He had just gained this information when it was reported to him that  Diego Marques, the captain of one of the caravels, and eight men were  missing.  They had landed in the morning, and strayed into the woods.  The night passed away, and they did not appear.  The next morning  parties were sent in quest of them, each with a trumpeter to sound  calls, and guns were fired from the ships.    The searching parties found, as they supposed, human limbs suspended  from the beams of houses, and some declared that they saw the head of a  young man recently killed, while parts of his body were roasting before  a fire.    The natives were seen on shore, looking with wonder at the ships.  When  the boats approached, they fled to the woods.  Several women, however,  came off, and some were captured.  Columbus ordered that they should be  decorated with hawks' bells and other baubles, and sent on shore to  entice off the men.  They soon, however, returned to the boats stripped  of their ornaments, imploring to be taken on board again.  The greater  portion of the male inhabitants were, they informed the Spaniards, on a  cruise in search of prisoners and booty.    Anxious to continue his course to Hispaniola, Columbus was much annoyed  at the absence of the wanderers.  At length Alonzo de Ojeda, a brave  young cavalier, offered to go in search of them.  Ojeda and his party  had great difficulty in making their way through the tangled forest.  In  vain they sounded their trumpets and shot off their arquebuses.  No  reply was received, and they returned on board without tidings of the  stragglers.    Several days passed, and the fleet was about to sail, when the missing  ones appeared on the beach, their haggard looks showing how much they  had suffered.    They had been lost in the trackless forest, too dense to allow them to  see any distance ahead, until they had reached the sea-shore, keeping  along which they had made"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23495"],[0,"The Story of the Greeks (#10)"],[1,"it away to save yourself by flight;  or die so bravely that your companions will bring back your body resting  on your shield, to give you a glorious burial.\"          XXV. LAWS OF LYCURGUS.      The Spartan girls, who were brought up by the women, were, like the  boys, taught to wrestle, run, and swim, and to take part in gymnastics  of all kinds, until they too became very strong and supple, and could  stand almost any fatigue.    [Illustration: A Dancing Girl.]    They were also taught to read, write, count, sing, play, and dance; to  spin, weave, and dye; and to do all kinds of woman's work. In short,  they were expected to be strong, intelligent, and capable, so that when  they married they might help their husbands, and bring up their children  sensibly. At some public festivals the girls strove with one another in  various games, which were witnessed only by their fathers and mothers  and the other married people of the city. The winners in these contests  were given beautiful prizes, which were much coveted.    Lycurgus hoped to make the Spartans a strong and good people. To hinder  the kings from doing anything wrong, he had the people choose five men,  called ephors, to watch over and to advise them.    Then, knowing that great wealth is not desirable, Lycurgus said that the  Spartans should use only iron money. All the Spartan coins were  therefore bars of iron, so heavy that a yoke of oxen and a strong cart  were needed to carry a sum equal to one hundred dollars from one spot to  another. Money was so bulky that it could neither be hidden nor stolen;  and no one cared to make a fortune, since it required a large space to  stow away even a small sum.    When Charilaus, the infant king, had grown up, Lycurgus prepared to go  away. Before he left the town, he called all the citizens together,  reminded them of all he had done to make them a great people, and ended  by asking every man present to swear to obey the laws until he came  back.    The Spartans were very grateful for all he had done for them, so they  gladly took this oath, and Lycurgus left the place. Some time after, he  came back to Greece; but, hearing that the Spartans were thriving under  the rules he had laid down, he made up his mind never to visit Sparta  again.    It was thus that the Spartans found themselves bound by solemn oath to  obey Lycurgus' laws forever; and as long as they remembered this  promise, they were a thriving and happy people.          XXVI. THE MESSENIAN WAR.      Not very far from Sparta, and next to Laconia, was a country called  Mes-se'ni-a, which was much more fertile, and had long been occupied by  a kindred race descended from Le'lex, brother of Lacedaemon.    When the Spartans found out that the Mes-se'ni-an fields were more  fruitful than their own, they longed to have them, and anxiously watched  for some excuse to make war against the Messenians and win their land.  It was not long before they found one.    There was a temple on the boundary of Messenia and Laconia, where the  people of both countries used to assemble on certain days to offer up  sacrifices to the gods. The Messenian lads, seeing the beauty of the  Spartan girls, and longing to have such strong, handsome, and  intelligent wives, once carried off a few of them into their own  country, and refused to give them up again. The Spartans, indignant at  this conduct, flew to arms, and one night, led by their king, attacked  the Messenian town of Am-phe'a.    As no one expected them, they soon became masters of the place, and in  their anger killed all the inhabitants. The other Messenians, hearing of  this cruel deed, quickly made ready to fight, and bravely began the  struggle which is known as the First Messenian War.    Although very brave, the Messenians had not been as well trained as the  Spartans, and could not drive them back. On the contrary, they were  themselves driven from place to place, until they were forced to take  refuge in the fortified city of I-tho'me. Here they were shut in with  their king, Aristodemus, who was a proud and brave man.    Ithome was built high up on a rock, so steep that the Spartan soldiers  could not climb it, and so high that they could not even shoot their  arrows into the town.    The Messenians, hoping to keep this place of refuge, kept a sharp  lookout, and, whenever the Spartans made any attempt to climb the rocks,  they rolled great blocks of stone down upon them.    All went well as long as the food lasted, but the time came when the  Messenians in Ithome had nothing to eat. Some of their bravest men tried  to go down into the valley in search of provisions; but, as they were  attacked by the Spartans, they could not bring the hungry people much to  eat.    When Aristodemus saw that the people would all die of hunger unless some  way were found to get food, he consulted an oracle, in order to find out  what it was best for him to do. The oracle answered that a battle should  be fought, and promised the victory to the king who offered his daughter  in sacrifice to the gods.    When Aristodemus heard this answer, he shuddered with fear; for,  although he knew that his ancestors had offered up human victims on  their altars, he loved his only daughter too well to give her up.    For some time longer, therefore, he resisted every attack, and tried to  think of some other way to save his people. At last, however, seeing  that they would all die unless something were done, he sacrificed the  child he loved so well.    The Messenians were touched by his generosity, and by his readiness to  do all in his power to save them. They felt sure that the gods would now  give them the victory, and rushed out of the town and into the Spartan  camp. Their attack was so sudden, and they fought with such fury, that  they soon killed three hundred Spartans and one of their kings.    This battle did not, as they had hoped, end the war, which went on for  several years. At last Aristodemus, despairing of victory, went to his  beloved daughter's tomb, and there killed himself.    When he was dead, the city of Ithome fell into the hands of the  Spartans. They treated the conquered Messenians with great cruelty, made  them all slaves, and were as unkind to them as they had been to the  Helots.          XXVII. THE MUSIC OF TYRTAEUS.      After suffering great tortures under the Spartan yoke for forty long  years, the Messenians began to plan a revolt.    One of their princes, Ar-is-tom'e-nes, a man of unusual bravery, made up  his mind to free the unhappy people, and to ruin the proud city of  Sparta, which had caused them so much suffering.    He therefore secretly assembled all the Messenians, and, when his plans  were ready, began to war openly against the Spartans, whom he defeated  in several battles.    With his small army, he even pressed forward toward the city of Sparta,  and camped within sight of its dwellings. The Spartan women could thus  see a very unusual sight,--the light of the enemies' fires.    To frighten the Spartans still more, Aristomenes went secretly into the  city one dark night, stole into the principal temple, and there hung up  the arms he had taken during the war.    These weapons were arranged so as to form what the Greeks called a  trophy, and right under them Aristomenes boldly wrote his name in  letters so large that all could see it.    When morning dawned, and the Spartans came as usual into the temple to  offer up their morning prayer and sacrifice, they were astonished and  dismayed at the sight of this trophy. Aristomenes' bravery was so great  that they despaired of conquering him without divine aid, and so they  sent to ask an oracle what they should do.    The oracle answered that the Spartans would be victorious if they  marched to war under the command of an Athenian general. Now, the  Spartans were a proud people, and did not like to ask aid of any one;  but they made up their minds to obey this command, and so sent a  messenger to Athens to ask for a good leader.    Whether the Athenians, who were well known for their love of joking,  wished to make fun of the Spartans, or whether they wanted to show them  that the bodily beauty and strength which the Spartans prized so highly  was not everything, no one now knows. The fact is, however, that the  Athenians sent the Spartans a poor, lame schoolmaster, called Tyr-tae'us,  to lead them in battle. This man had never handled a weapon in his life,  and the Spartans were very angry when he placed himself at their head  with a lyre instead of a sword; but when he suddenly began to sing one  of those war songs which make one's blood tingle, it roused their  patriotism to such a point that all were ready to conquer or die, and  their scorn was soon changed to deep admiration.    Fired by these patriotic songs, and by the stirring music the lame  schoolmaster played, the Spartans fought better than ever before,  overcame the Messenians, and came home in triumph with their prisoners,  among whom was the brave Aristomenes.    As it was then usual to put all prisoners of war to death, the Spartans  threw all the Messenians down into a horrible pit called the Ce'a-das.  This was a dark hole of great depth, and its sides were all covered with  jagged rocks, against which the prisoners were dashed to pieces long  before they reached the bottom.    The Messenians were cast into this place one after another, Aristomenes  being thrown in last of all, so that he might have the sorrow of seeing  his companions die. Of course, this was very cruel, but the Spartans had  been brought up to think this mode of getting rid of their enemies quite  right; and when they had thus killed them, they cheerfully went back to  the city and celebrated their victory.
