OLD-WOMAN-WHO-NEVER-DIES    _Mandan_      In the sun lives the Lord of Life. In the moon lives  Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies. She has six children, three sons and three  daughters. These live in the sky. The eldest son is the Day; another  is the Sun; another is Night. The eldest daughter is the Morning Star,  called \"The Woman who Wears a Plume\"; another is a star which circles  around the polar star, and she is called \"The Striped Gourd\"; the  third is Evening Star.    Every spring Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies sends the wild geese, the swans,  and the ducks. When she sends the wild geese, the Indians plant their  corn and Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies makes it grow. When eleven wild  geese are found together, the Indians know the corn crop will be very  large. The swans mean that the Indians must plant gourds; the ducks,  that they must plant beans.    Indians always save dried meat for these wild birds, so when they come  in the spring they may have a corn feast. They build scaffolds of many  poles, three or four rows, and one above the others. On this they  hang the meat. Then the old women in the village, each one with a  stick, meet around the scaffold. In one end of the stick is an ear of  corn. Sitting in a circle, they plant their sticks in the ground in  front of them. Then they dance around the scaffolds while the old men  beat the drums and rattle the gourds.    Afterwards the old women in the village are allowed to eat the dried  meat.    In the fall they hold another corn feast, after the corn is ripe. This  is so that Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies may send the buffalo herds to  them. Each woman carries the entire cornstalk, with the ears attached,  just as it was pulled up by the roots. Then they call on  Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies and say,    \"Mother, pity us. Do not send the cold too soon, or we may not have  enough meat. Mother, do not let the game depart, so that we may have  enough for winter.\"    In the fall, when the birds go south to Old-Woman, they take back the  dried meat hung on the scaffolds, because Old-Woman is very fond of  it.    Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies has large patches of corn, kept for her by  the great stag and by the white-tailed stag. Blackbirds also help her  guard her corn patches. The corn patches are large, therefore the Old  Woman has the help also of the mice and the moles. In the spring the  birds go north, back to Old-Man-Who-Never-Dies.    In the olden time, Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies lived near the Little  Missouri. Sometimes the Indians visited her. One day twelve came, and  she offered them only a small kettle of corn. They were very hungry  and the kettle was very small. But as soon as it was empty, it at once  became filled again, so all the Indians had enough to eat.          LEGEND OF THE CORN    _Arikara_      The Arikara were the first to find the maize. A young man went out  hunting. He came to a high hill. Looking down a valley, he saw a  buffalo bull near where two rivers joined. When the young man looked  to see how he could kill the buffalo, he saw how beautiful the country  was. The banks of the two rivers were low, with many trees. The  buffalo faced the north; therefore he could not get within bowshot of  him. He thought he should wait until the buffalo moved close to the  banks of one of the rivers, or to a ravine where there were bushes and  shrubs. So the young man waited. The sun went down before the buffalo  moved.    Nearly all night the hunter lay awake. He had little food. He felt  sorry he could not reach the buffalo. Before the sun rose, he hurried  to the top of the hill. The buffalo stood just where it had, but it  faced the east. Again he waited for it to move. He waited all day.  When the sun went down, the buffalo still stood in the same place.    Nearly all night the young man lay awake. He had very little food  indeed. The next morning he rose early, and came to the top of the  hill, just as the sun came up. The buffalo was still standing in the  same place; but now it faced the south. He waited all day. Then the  sun went down.    Now the next morning, when he arose early, the buffalo stood in the  same place; this time it faced the west. All day the young man waited,  but the buffalo did not move.    Now the young man thought, \"Why does not the buffalo move?\" He saw it  did not drink, did not eat, did not sleep. He thought some power must  be influencing it.    Now the next morning, the young man hurried to the top of the hill.  The sun had risen and everything was light. The buffalo was gone. Then  he saw where the buffalo had stood there was a strange bush.    He went to the place; then he saw it was a plant. He looked for the  tracks of the buffalo. He saw where it had turned to the east and to  the south and to the west. In the center there was one track; out of  it the small plant had grown. There was no track to show where the  buffalo had left the place.    Then the hunter hurried to his village. He told the chiefs and the  people of the strange buffalo and the plant. So all the chiefs and  the people came to the place. They saw the tracks of the buffalo as he  had stood, but there were no tracks of his coming or going.    So all the people knew that Wahkoda had given this strange plant to  the people. They knew of other plants they might eat. They knew there  was a time when each plant was ripe. So they watched the strange  plant; they guarded it and protected it.    Then a flower appeared on the plant. Afterwards, at one of the joints,  a new part of the plant pushed out. It had hair. At first the hair was  green; then it was brown. Then the people thought, \"Perhaps this fruit  is ripe.\" But they did not dare touch it. They met together. They  looked at the plant.    Then a young man said, \"My life has not been good. If any evil comes  to me, it will not matter.\"    So the people were willing, and the young man put his hand on the  plant and then on its fruit. He grasped the fruit boldly. He said to  the people, \"It is solid. It is ripe.\" Then he pulled apart the husks,  and said, \"It is red.\"    He took a few of the grains and showed them to the people. He ate  some. He did not die. So the people knew Wahkoda had sent this plant  to them for food.    Now in the fall, when the prairie grass turned brown, the leaves of  this plant turned brown also. Then the fruit was plucked, and put  away. After the winter was over, the kernels were divided. There were  four to each family.    Then the people moved the lodges to the place where the plant had  grown. When the hills became green, they planted the seed of the  strange plant. But first they built little mounds like the one out of  which it grew. So the fruit grew and ripened. It had many colors; red,  and yellow, and white, and blue.    Then the next year there were many plants and many ears of corn. So  they sent to other tribes. They invited them to visit them and gave  them of the new food. Thus the Omahas came to have corn.          TRADITION OF THE FINDING OF HORSES    _Ponca_      Long ago, the people followed the Missouri River northward to a place  where they could step over the water. Then they turned, and were going  across the land. Then they met the Padouca [Comanche].    At that time the Ponca had no animals but dogs to help them carry  burdens. Wherever they went they had to go on foot, but the people  were strong and fleet. They could run a great distance and not be  weary. One day when they were hunting buffalo, they met the Padouca.  Then they had many battles with them. The Padouca were mounted on  strange animals. At first the Ponca thought it was all one animal. The  Padouca had bows made from elk horn. They were not very long, nor were  they very strong. They boiled the horn until it was soft; then they  scraped it, and bound it together with sinews and glue. Their arrows  were tipped with bone. They fought also with a stone battle-ax. The  handle was a sapling; a grooved stone ax head, pointed at both ends,  was fastened to this with rawhides. So the Padouca were terrible  fighters. They protected their horses with a covering of thick rawhide  cut in round pieces, and put together like fish scales. They spread  glue over the outside and then sand. So when the Comanches fought, the  arrows of their enemies glanced off the horses' armor. Then the  Padouca made breastplates for themselves like those of the horses.    When the Ponca met these terrible warriors, they were afraid. They  thought man and horse were one. They named it \"Kawa\" because they  noticed the odor of the horse. Then they knew by this odor when the  Padouca were coming. When a man smelled the horses, he would run to  the camp and say, \"The wind tells us the Kawa are coming.\" Then the  Ponca would make ready to defend themselves. The Ponca had many  battles with the Comanches. They did not know how to use the animals,  so they killed the horses as well as the men. Neither could they find  out where the Padouca lived.    One day the two tribes had a great battle. The people fought all day.  Sometimes the Ponca were driven back, sometimes the Padouca."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22089"],[0,"The Liberty Minstrel (#10)"],[1," its sunny hills,    On every mountain broods,  And sleeps by all its gushing rills,    And all its mighty floods.    The wife sits meekly by the hearth,    Her infant child beside;  The father on his noble boy    Looks with a fearless pride.  The grey old man, beneath the tree,    Tales of his childhood tells;  And sweetly in the hush of morn    Peal out the Sabbath bells.    And we ARE free--but is there not    One blot upon our name?

The Freed Slave.      Yet once again, once more again,    My bark bounds o'er the wave;  They know not, who ne'er clanked the chain,    What 'tis to be a slave:  To sit alone, beside the wood,    And gaze upon the sky:  This may, indeed, be solitude,    But 'tis not slavery.    Fatigued with labor's noontide task,    To sigh in vain for sleep;  Or faintly smile, our griefs to mask,    When 't would be joy to weep;  To court the shade of leafy bower,    Thirst for the freedom wave,  But to obtain denied the power--    This is to be a slave!    Son of the sword! on honor's field    'Tis thine to find a grave;  Yet, when from life's worst ill 'twould shield,    It comes not to the slave.

Fling abroad its folds to the cooling breeze,    Let it float at the mast-head high;  And gather around, all hearts resolved,    To sustain it there or die:  An emblem of peace and hope to the world,    Unstained let it ever be;  And say to the world, where'er it waves,    Our flag is the flag of the free!    That banner proclaims to the list'ning earth,    That the reign of base tyrants is o'er,  The galling chain of the cruel lord,    Shall enslave mankind no more:  An emblem of hope to the poor and crushed,    O place it where all may see;  And shout with glad voice as you raise it high,    Our flag is the flag of the free!    Then on high, on high let that banner wave,    And lead us the foe to meet,  Let it float in triumph o'er our heads,    Or be our winding sheet;  And never, oh, never be it furled,    'Till it wave o'er earth and sea;  And all mankind shall swell the shout    Our flag is the flag of the free.          MARCH TO THE BATTLEFIELD.    Parody by G.W.C. Air \"Oft in the stilly night.\"      [Music]    March to the battlefield,    The foe is now before us;  Each heart is freedom's shield,    And heaven is smiling o'er us.  The woes and pains of slavery's chains,    That bind three millions under;  In proud disdain we'll burst their chain,    And tear each link asunder.    Who for his country brave,    Would fly from her invader?  Who his base life to save    Would traitor like degrade her?  Our hallowed cause--    Our homes and laws,  'Gainst tyrant hosts sustaining,    We'll win a crown of bright renown,  Or die, man's rights maintaining,      March to the battlefield, &c.          Oft in the Chilly Night.    BY PIERPONT.      Oft in the chilly night,    Ere slumber's chain has bound me,  When all her silvery light    The moon is pouring round me,  Beneath its ray I kneel and pray    That God would give some token  That slavery's chains on Southern plains,    Shall all ere long be broken:  Yes, in the chilly night,    Though slavery's chain has bound me,  Kneel I, and feel the might    Of God's right arm around me.    When at the driver's call,    In cold or sultry weather,  We slaves, both great and small,    Turn out to toil together,  I feel like one from whom the sun    Of hope has long departed;  And morning's light, and weary night,    Still find me broken hearted:  Thus, when the chilly breath    Of night is sighing round me,  Kneel I, and wish that death    In his cold chain had bound me.          SONG OF THE FREE.    Parodied by G.W.C. Tune, Lutzow's Wild Hunt.      [Music]    From valley and mountain, from hilltop and glen,    What shouts thro' the air are rebounding!  And echo is sending the sounds back again,    And loud thro' the air they are sounding,    And loud through the air they are sounding:  And if you ask what those joyous strains?    'Tis the songs of bondmen now bursting their chains.    And who through our nation is waging the fight?    What host from the battle is flying?  Our true hearted freemen maintain the right,    And the monster oppression is dying,    And the monster oppression is dying:  And if you ask what you there behold?  'Tis the army of freemen, the true and the bold.    Too long have slave-holders triumphantly reigned,    Too long in their chains have they bound us;  To freedom awaking, no longer enchained,    The goddess of freedom has saved us,    The goddess of freedom has saved us:  And if you ask what has made us free?  'Tis the vote that gave us our liberty.          Holy Freedom.    BY PIERPONT.      The bondmen are free in the isles of the main!    The chains from their limbs they are flinging!  They stand up as men!--never tyrant again,    In the pride of his heart, shall God's image profane!      It is Liberty's song that is ringing!  Hark! loud comes the cry o'er the bounding sea,    \"Freedom! Freedom! Freedom, our joy is in thee!\"    Alas! that to-day, on Columbia's shore,    The groans of her slaves are resounding!  On plains of the South their life-blood they pour!  O, Freemen! blest Freemen! your help they implore!      It is Slavery's wail that is sounding!  Hark! loud comes the cry on the Southern gale,  \"Freedom! Freedom! Freedom or death, must prevail!\"    O ye who are blest with fair Liberty's light,    With courage and hope all abounding,  With weapons of love be ye bold for the right!  By the preaching of truth put oppression to flight!      Then, your altars triumphant surrounding,  Loud, loud let the anthem of joy ring out!  \"Freedom! Freedom!\" list all the world to the shout!          YE SONS OF FREEMEN.    Words by Mrs. J.G. Carter. Air, \"Marseilles Hymn.\"      [Music]        Ye sons of freemen wake to sadness,        Hark! hark, what myriads bid you rise;      Three millions of our race in madness        Break out in wails, in bitter cries,        Break out in wails, in bitter cries;      Must men whose hearts now bleed with anguish,        Yes, trembling slaves, in freedom's land        Endure the lash, nor raise a hand?      Must nature 'neath the whip-cord languish?          Have pity on the slave,          Take courage from God's word;  Pray on, pray on, all hearts resolved, these captives shall be free.        The fearful storm--it threatens lowering,        Which God in mercy long delays;      Slaves yet may see their masters cowering,        While whole plantations smoke and blaze!        While whole plantations smoke and blaze!      And we may now prevent the ruin,        Ere lawless force with guilty stride        Shall scatter vengeance far and wide--      With untold crimes their hands embruing.          Have pity on the slave;          Take courage from God's word;  Pray, on, pray on, all hearts resolved--these captives shall be free!        With luxury and wealth surrounded,        The southern masters proudly dare,      With thirst of gold and power unbounded,        To mete and vend God's light and air!        To mete and vend God's light and air;      Like beasts of burden, slaves are loaded,        Till life's poor toilsome day is o'er;        While they in vain for right implore;      And shall they longer still be goaded?          Have pity on the slave;          Take courage from God's word;  Toil on, toil on, all hearts resolved these captives shall be free.        O Liberty! can man e'er bind thee?        Can overseers quench thy flame?      Can dungeons, bolts, or bars confine thee,        Or threats thy Heaven born spirit tame?        Or threats thy Heaven born spirit tame?      Too long the slave has groaned bewailing        The power these heartless tyrants wield;        Yet free them not by sword or shield,      For with men's heart's they're unavailing,          Have pity on the slave:          Take courage from God's word;  Vote on! vote on! all hearts resolved--these captives shall be free!          ARE YE TRULY FREE?    Words by J.R. Lowell. Air, \"Martyn.\"      [Music]    Men! whose boast it is that ye  Come of fathers brave and free;  If there breathe on earth a slave,  Are ye truly free and brave?  Are ye not base slaves indeed,  Men unworthy to be freed?  If ye do not feel the chain,  When it works a brother's pain?    Women! who shall one day bear  Sons to breathe God's bounteous air,  If ye hear without a blush,  Deeds to make the roused blood rush  Like red lava through your veins,  For your sisters now in chains;  Answer! are ye fit to be  Mothers of the brave and free?    Is true freedom but to break  Fetters for our own dear sake,  And, with leathern hearts forget  That we owe mankind a debt?  No! true freedom is to share  All the chains our brothers wear,  And with hand and heart to be  Earnest to make others free.    They are slaves who fear to speak  For the fallen and the weak;  They are slaves, who will not choose  Hatred, scoffing, and abuse,  Rather than, in silence, shrink  From the truth they needs must think;  They are slaves, who dare not be  In the right with _two_ or _three_.          That's my Country.      Does the land, in native might,  Pant for Liberty and Right?  Long to cast from human kind  Chains of body and of mind--  That's my country, that's the land  I can love with heart and hand,  O'er her miseries weep and sigh,  For her glory live and die.    Does the land her banner wave,  Most invitingly, to save;  Wooing to her arms of love,  Strangers who would freemen prove?  That's the land to which I cling,  Of her glories I can sing,  On her altar nobly swear  Higher"]]]
