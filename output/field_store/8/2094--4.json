Perhaps  the girl with the violet eyes was another.  What else to be dreaded  Hassan might hold in store for us I could not conjecture.    Do you wonder that I feared?  Do you wonder that I hoped (I confess  it), hoped that the slipper might be recovered without further  bloodshed?          CHAPTER XI    THE HOLE IN THE BLIND      I stepped over to the door, where a constable stood on duty.    \"You observed a tall Eastern gentleman in the room a while ago,  officer?\"    \"I did, sir.\"    \"How long is he gone?\"    The man started and began to peer about anxiously.    \"That's a funny thing, sir,\" he said.  \"I was keeping my eyes  specially upon him.  I noticed him hovering around while Mr.  Mostyn was speaking; but although I could have sworn he hadn't  passed out, he's gone!\"    \"You didn't notice his departure, then?\"    \"I'm sorry to say I didn't, sir.\"    The man clearly was perplexed, but I found small matter for wonder  in the episode.  I had more than suspected the stranger to be a spy  of Hassan's, and members of that strange company were elusive as  will-o'-the-wisps.    Bristol, at the far end of the room, was signalling to me.  I  walked back and joined him.    \"Come over here,\" he said, in a low voice, \"and pretend to examine  these things.\"    He glanced significantly to his left.  Following the glance, my  eyes fell upon the lean American; he was peering into the receptacle  which held the holy slipper.    Bristol led me across the room, and we both faced the wall and bent  over a glass case.  Some yellow newspaper cuttings describing its  contents hung above it, and these we pretended to read.    \"Did you notice that man I glanced at?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, that's Earl Dexter, the first crook in America!  Ssh!  Only  goes in on very big things.  We had word at the Yard he was in town;  but we can't touch him--we can only keep our eyes on him.  He  usually travels openly and in his own name, but this time he seems  to have slipped over quietly.  He always dresses the same and has  just given me 'good day!'  They call him The Stetson Man.  We heard  this morning that he had booked two first-class sailings in the  Oceanic, leaving for New York three weeks hence.  Now, Mr. Cavanagh,  what is his game?\"    \"It has occurred to me before, Bristol,\" I replied, \"and you may  remember that I mentioned the idea to you, that there might be a  third party interested in the slipper.  Why shouldn't Earl Dexter  be that third party?\"    \"Because he isn't a fool,\" rapped Bristol shortly.  \"Earl Dexter  isn't a man to gather up trouble for himself.  More likely if his  visit has anything really to do with the slipper he's retained by  Hassan and Company.  Museum-breaking may be a bit out of the line  of Hashishin!\"    This latter suggestion dovetailed with my own ideas, and oddly  enough there was something positively wholesome in the notion of  the straightforward crookedness of a mere swell cracksman.    Then happened a singular thing, and one that effectually concluded  our whispered colloquy.  From the top end of the room, beyond the  case containing the slipper, one of the yellow blinds came down  with a run.    Bristol turned in a flash.  It was not a remarkable accident, and  might portend no more than a loose cord; but when, having walked  rapidly up the room, we stood before the lowered blind, it  appeared that this was no accident at all.    Some four feet from the bottom of the blind (or five feet from the  floor) a piece of linen a foot square had been neatly slashed out!    I glanced around the room.  Several fashionably dressed visitors  were looking idly in our direction, but I could fasten upon no one  of them as a likely perpetrator.    Bristol stared at me in perplexity.    \"Who on earth did it,\" he muttered, \"and what the blazes for?\"          CHAPTER XII    THE HASHISHIN WATCH      \"The American gentleman has just gone out, sir,\" said the sergeant  at the door.    I nodded grimly and raced down the steps.  Despite my half-formed  desire that the slipper should be recovered by those to whom  properly it belonged, I experienced at times a curious interest in  its welfare.  I cannot explain this.  Across the hall in front of  me I saw Earl Dexter passing out of the Museum.  I followed him  through into Kingsway and thence to Fleet Street.  He sauntered  easily along, a nonchalant gray figure.  I had begun to think that  he was bound for his hotel and that I was wasting my time when he  turned sharply into quiet Salisbury Square; it was almost deserted.    My heart leapt into my mouth with a presentiment of what was coming  as I saw an elegant and beautifully dressed woman sauntering along  in front of us on the far side.    Was it that I detected something familiar in her carriage, in the  poise of her head--something that reminded me of former  unforgettable encounters; encounters which without exception had  presaged attempts upon the slipper of the Prophet?  Or was it that  I recollected how Dexter had booked two passages to America?  I  cannot say, but I felt my heart leap; I knew beyond any possibility  of doubt that this meeting in Salisbury Square marked the opening  of a new chapter in the history of the slipper.    Dexter slipped his arm within that of the girl in front of him and  they paced slowly forward in earnest conversation.  I suppose my  action was very amateurish and very poor detective work; but  regardless of discovery I crossed the road and passed close by  the pair.    I am certain that Dexter was speaking as I came up, but, well out  of earshot, his voice was suddenly arrested.  His companion turned  and looked at me.    I was prepared for it, yet was thrilled electrically by the  flashing glance of the violet eyes--for it was she--the beautiful  harbinger of calamities!    My brain was in a whirl; complication piled itself upon complication;  yet in the heart of all this bewilderment I thought I could detect  the key of the labyrinth, but at the time my ideas were in disorder,  for the violet eyes were not lowered but fixed upon me in cold scorn.    I knew myself helpless, and bending my head with conscious  embarrassment I passed on hurriedly.    I had work to do in plenty, but I could not apply my mind to it;  and now, although the obvious and sensible thing was to go about  my business, I wandered on aimlessly, my brain employed with a  hundred idle conjectures and the query, \"Where have I seen The  Stetson Man?\" seeming to beat, like a tattoo, in my brain.  There  was something magnetic about the accursed slipper, for without  knowing by what route I had arrived there, I found myself in Great  Orchard Street and close under the walls of the British Antiquarian  Museum.  Then I was effectually aroused from my reverie.    Two men, both tall, stood in the shadow of a doorway on the Opposite  side of the street, staring intently up at the Museum windows.  It  was a tropically hot afternoon and they stood in deepest shadow.  No  one else was in Orchard Street--that odd little backwater--at the  time, and they stood gazing upward intently and gave me not even a  passing glance.    But I knew one for the Oriental visitor of the morning, and despite  broad noonday and the hum of busy London about me, my blood seemed  to turn to water.  I stood rooted to the spot, held there by a most  surprising horror.    For the gray-bearded figure of the other watcher was one I could  never forget; its benignity was associated with the most horrible  hours of my life, with deeds so dreadful that recollection to this  day sometimes breaks my sleep, arousing me in the still watches,  bathed in a cold sweat of fear.    It was Hassan of Aleppo!    If he saw me, if either of them saw me, I cannot say.  What I should  have done, what I might have done it is useless to speak of here--for  I did nothing.  Inert, thralled by the presence of that eerie,  dreadful being, I watched them leave the shadow of the doorway and  pace slowly on with their dignified Eastern gait.    Then, knowing how I had failed in my plain duty to my fellow-men--how,  finding a serpent in my path, I had hesitated to crush it,  had weakly succumbed to its uncanny fascination--I made my way  round to the door of the Museum.          CHAPTER XIII    THE WHITE BEAM      That night the deviltry began.  Mr. Mostyn found himself wholly  unable to sleep.  Many relics have curious histories, and the  experienced archaeologist becomes callous to that uncanniness which  seems to attach to some gruesome curios.  But the slipper of the  Prophet was different.  No mere ghostly menace threatened its  holders; an avenging scimitar followed those who came in contact  with it; gruesome tragedies, mutilations, murders, had marked its  progress throughout.    The night was still--as still as a London night can be; for there  is always a vague murmuring in the metropolis as though the  sleeping city breathed gently and sometimes stirred in its sleep.    Then, distinct amid these usual nocturnal noises, rose another,  unaccountable sound, a muffled crash followed by a musical tinkling.    Mostyn sprang up in bed, drew on a dressing-gown, and took from the  small safe at his bed-head the Museum keys and a loaded revolver.  A somewhat dishevelled figure, pale and wild-eyed, he made his way  through the private door and into the ghostly precincts of the  Museum.  He did not hesitate, but ascended the stairs and unlocked  the door of the Assyrian gallery.    Along its ghostly aisles he passed, and before the door which gave  admittance to the Burton Room paused, fumbling a moment for the  key.    Inside the room something was moving!    Mostyn was keenly alarmed; he knew that he must enter at once or  never.  He inserted the key in the lock, swung open the heavy door,  stepped through and closed it behind him.  He was a man of  tremendous moral courage, for now,--alone in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21272"],[0,"The Bibliotaph, and Other People (#10)"],[1,"taste.' 'This,' said the Bibliotaph, 'is as if one were to say, \"The  guests were Americans, but no one expectorated on the carpet.\"' The  Bibliotaph thought that there was not so much reason for this  attitude. The sins of Englishmen and Americans were identical, he  believed, but the forms of their expression were different. 'Our sin  is a voluble boastfulness; theirs is an irritating, unrestrainable,  all-but-constantly manifested, satisfied self-consciousness. The same  results are reached by different avenues. We praise ourselves; they  belittle others.' Then he added with a smile: 'Thus even in these  latter days are the Scriptures exemplified; the same spirit with  varying manifestations.'    He was once commenting upon Jowett's classification of humorists.  Jowett divided humorists 'into three categories or classes; those who  are not worth reading at all; those who are worth reading once, but  once only; and those who are worth reading again and again and for  ever.' This remark was made to Swinburne, who quotes it in his all too  brief _Recollections of Professor Jowett_. Swinburne says that the  starting-point of their discussion was the _Biglow Papers_, which  'famous and admirable work of American humour' Jowett placed in the  second class. Swinburne himself thought that the _Biglow Papers_ was  too good for the second class and not quite good enough for the third.  'I would suggest that a fourth might be provided, to include such  examples as are worth, let us say, two or three readings in a  life-time.'    The Bibliotaph made a variety of comments on this, but I remember only  the following; it is a reason for not including the _Biglow Papers_ in  Jowett's third and crowning class. 'Humor to be popular permanently  must be general rather than local, and have to do with a phase of  character rather than a fact of history; that is, it must deal in a  great way with what is always interesting to all men. Humor that does  not meet this requirement is not likely, when its novelty has worn  off, to be read even occasionally save by those who enjoy it as an  intellectual performance or who are making a critical study of its  author.' The observation, if not profound, is at least sensible, and  it illustrates very well the Bibliotaph's love of alliteration and  antithesis. But it is easier to remember and to report his caustic and  humorous remarks.    The Country Squire had a card-catalogue of the books in his library,  and he delighted to make therein entries of his past and his new  purchases. But it was not always possible to find upon the shelves  books that were mentioned in the catalogue. The Bibliotaph took  advantage of a few instances of this sort to prod his moneyed friend.  He would ask the Squire if he had such-and-such a book. The Squire  would say that he had, and appeal to his catalogue in proof of it.  Then would follow a search for the volume. If, as sometimes happened,  no book corresponding to the entry could be found, the Bibliotaph  would be satirical and remark:--    'I'll tell you what you ought to name your catalogue.'    'What?'    'Great expectations!'    Another time he said, 'This is not a list of your books, this is a  list of the things that you intend to buy;' or he would suggest that  the Squire would do well to christen his catalogue _Vaulting  Ambition_. Perhaps the variation might take this form. After a  fruitless search for some book, which upon the testimony of the  catalogue was certainly in the collection, the Bibliotaph would  observe, 'This catalogue might not inappropriately be spoken of as the  substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen.'  Another time the Bibliotaph said to the Squire, calling to mind the  well-known dictum as to the indispensableness of certain books,  'Between what one sees on your shelves and what one reads in your  card-catalogue one would have reason to believe that you were a  gentleman.'    Once the Bibliotaph said to me in the presence of the Squire: 'I think  that our individual relation to books might be expressed in this way.  You read books but you don't buy them. I buy books but I don't read  them. The Squire neither reads them nor buys them,--only  card-catalogues them!'    To all this the Squire had a reply which was worldly, emphatic, and  adequate, but the object of this study is not to exhibit the virtues  of the Squire's speech, witty though it was.    One of the Bibliotaph's friends began without sufficient provocation  to write verse. The Bibliotaph thought that if the matter were taken  promptly in hand the man could be saved. Accordingly, when next he  gave this friend a book he wrote upon a fly-leaf: 'To a Poet who is  nothing if not original--and who is not original!' And the injured  rhymester exclaimed when he read the inscription: 'You deface every  book you give me.'    He could pay a compliment, as when he was dining with a married pair  who were thought to be not yet disenchanted albeit in the tenth year  of their married life. The lady was speaking to the Bibliotaph, but in  the eagerness of conversation addressed him by her husband's first  name. Whereupon he turned to the husband and said: 'Your wife implies  that I am a repository of grace and a bundle of virtues, and calls me  by your name.'    He once sent this same lady, apropos of the return of the shirt-waist  season, a dozen neckties. In the box was his card with these words  penciled upon it: 'A contribution to the man-made dress of a God-made  woman.'    The Squire had great skill in imitating the cries of various domestic  fowl, as well as dogs, cats, and children. Once, in a moment of social  relaxation, he was giving an exhibition of his power to the vast  amusement of his guests. When he had finished, the Bibliotaph said:  'The theory of Henry Ward Beecher that every man has something of the  animal in him is superabundantly exemplified in _your_ case. You, sir,  have got the whole Ark.'    There was a quaint humor in his most commonplace remarks. Of all the  fruits of the earth he loved most a watermelon. And when a  fellow-traveler remarked, 'That watermelon which we had at dinner was  bad,' the Bibliotaph instantly replied: 'There is no such thing as a  _bad_ watermelon. There are watermelons, and _better_ watermelons.'    I expressed astonishment on learning that he stood six feet in his  shoes. He replied: 'People are so preoccupied in the consideration of  my thickness that they don't have time to observe my height.'    Again, when he was walking through a private park which contained  numerous monstrosities in the shape of painted metal deer on  pedestals, pursued (also on pedestals) by hunters and dogs, the  Bibliotaph pointed to one of the dogs and said, 'Cave cast-iron  canem!'    He once accompanied a party of friends and acquaintances to the summit  of Mt. Tom. The ascent is made in these days by a very remarkable  inclined plane. After looking at the extensive and exquisite view, the  Bibliotaph fell to examining his return coupon, which read, 'Good for  one Trip Down.' Then he said: 'Let us hope that in a post-terrestrial  experience our tickets will not read in this way.'    He was once ascending in the unusually commodious and luxurious  elevator of a new ten-story hotel and remarked to his companion: 'If  we can't be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease, we can at  least start in that direction under not dissimilar conditions.' He  also said that the advantage of stopping at this particular hotel was  that you were able to get as far as possible from the city in which it  was located.    He studied the dictionary with great diligence and was unusually  accurate in his pronunciation. He took an amused satisfaction in  pronouncing exactly certain words which in common talk had shifted  phonetically from their moorings. This led a gentleman who was  intimate with the Bibliotaph to say to him, 'Why, if I were to  pronounce that word among my kinsfolk as you do they'd think I was  crazy.' 'What you mean,' said the Bibliotaph, 'is, that they would  look upon it in the light of supererogatory supplementary evidence.'    He himself indulged overmuch in alliteration, but it was with humorous  intent; and critics forgave it in him when they would have reprehended  it in another. He had no notion that it was fine. Taken, however, in  connection with his emphatic manner and sonorous voice he produced a  decided and original effect. Meeting the Squire's wife after a  considerable interval, I asked whether her husband had been behaving  well. She replied 'As usual.' Whereupon the Bibliotaph said, 'You mean  that his conduct in these days is characterized by a plethora of  intention and a paucity of performance.'    He objected to enlarging the boundaries of words until they stood for  too many things. Let a word be kept so far as was reasonable to its  earlier and authorized meaning. Speaking of the word 'symposium,'  which has been stretched to mean a collection of short articles on a  given subject, the Bibliotaph said that he could fancy a honey-bee  which had been feasting on pumice until it was unable to make the line  characteristic of its kind, explaining to its queen that it had been  to a symposium; but that he doubted if we ought to allow any other  meaning.    The Bibliotaph got much amusement from what he insisted were the  ill-concealed anxieties of his friend the actor on the subject of a  future state. 'He has acquired,' said the Bibliotaph, 'both a pathetic  and a prophetic interest in that place which begins as heaven does,  but stops off monosyllabically.'    The two men were one day discussing the question of the permanency of  fame, how ephemeral for example was that reputation which depended  upon the living presence of the artist to make good its claim; how an  actor, an orator, a singer, was bound to enjoy his glory while it  lasted, since at the instant of his death all tangible"]]]
