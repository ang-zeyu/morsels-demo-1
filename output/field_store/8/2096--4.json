From the northern lakes with the reeds and rushes,     Where the hills are clothed with a purple haze,     Where the bell-birds chime and the songs of thrushes     Make music sweet in the jungle maze,     They will hold their course to the westward ever,     Till they reach the banks of the old grey river,     Where the waters wash, and the reed-beds quiver     In the burning heat of the summer days.       Oh! ye strange wild birds, will ye bear a greeting     To the folk that live in that western land?     Then for every sweep of your pinions beating,     Ye shall bear a wish to the sunburnt band,     To the stalwart men who are stoutly fighting     With the heat and drought and the dust-storm smiting,     Yet whose life somehow has a strange inviting,     When once to the work they have put their hand.       Facing it yet!  Oh, my friend stout-hearted,     What does it matter for rain or shine,     For the hopes deferred and the gain departed?     Nothing could conquer that heart of thine.     And thy health and strength are beyond confessing     As the only joys that are worth possessing.     May the days to come be as rich in blessing     As the days we spent in the auld lang syne.       I would fain go back to the old grey river,     To the old bush days when our hearts were light,     But, alas! those days they have fled for ever,     They are like the swans that have swept from sight.     And I know full well that the strangers' faces     Would meet us now in our dearest places;     For our day is dead and has left no traces     But the thoughts that live in my mind to-night.       There are folk long dead, and our hearts would sicken --     We would grieve for them with a bitter pain,     If the past could live and the dead could quicken,     We then might turn to that life again.     But on lonely nights we would hear them calling,     We should hear their steps on the pathways falling,     We should loathe the life with a hate appalling     In our lonely rides by the ridge and plain.           .   .   .   .   .       In the silent park is a scent of clover,     And the distant roar of the town is dead,     And I hear once more as the swans fly over     Their far-off clamour from overhead.     They are flying west, by their instinct guided,     And for man likewise is his fate decided,     And griefs apportioned and joys divided     By a mighty power with a purpose dread.          The All Right 'Un           He came from 'further out',     That land of heat and drought     And dust and gravel.     He got a touch of sun,     And rested at the run     Until his cure was done,     And he could travel.       When spring had decked the plain,     He flitted off again     As flit the swallows.     And from that western land,     When many months were spanned,     A letter came to hand,     Which read as follows:       'Dear sir, I take my pen     In hopes that all your men     And you are hearty.     You think that I've forgot     Your kindness, Mr. Scott,     Oh, no, dear sir, I'm not     That sort of party.       'You sometimes bet, I know,     Well, now you'll have a show     The 'books' to frighten.     Up here at Wingadee     Young Billy Fife and me     We're training Strife, and he     Is a all right 'un.       'Just now we're running byes,     But, sir, first time he tries     I'll send you word of.     And running 'on the crook'     Their measures we have took,     It is the deadest hook     You ever heard of.       'So when we lets him go,     Why, then, I'll let you know,     And you can have a show     To put a mite on.     Now, sir, my leave I'll take,     Yours truly, William Blake.     P.S. -- Make no mistake,     _HE'S A ALL RIGHT 'UN_.'           .   .   .   .   .       By next week's _RIVERINE_     I saw my friend had been     A bit too cunning.     I read:  'The racehorse Strife     And jockey William Fife     Disqualified for life --     Suspicious running.'       But though they spoilt his game,     I reckon all the same     I fairly ought to claim     My friend a white 'un.     For though he wasn't straight,     His deeds would indicate     His heart at any rate     Was 'a all right 'un'.          The Boss of the 'Admiral Lynch'           Did you ever hear tell of Chili?  I was readin' the other day     Of President Balmaceda and of how he was sent away.     It seems that he didn't suit 'em -- they thought that they'd like a change,     So they started an insurrection and chased him across the range.     They seemed to be restless people -- and, judging by what you hear,     They raise up these revolutions 'bout two or three times a year;     And the man that goes out of office, he goes for the boundary _QUICK_,     For there isn't no vote by ballot -- it's bullets that does the trick.     And it ain't like a real battle, where the prisoners' lives are spared,     And they fight till there's one side beaten       and then there's a truce declared,       And the man that has got the licking goes down like a blooming lord     To hand in his resignation and give up his blooming sword,     And the other man bows and takes it, and everything's all polite --     This wasn't that kind of a picnic, this wasn't that sort of a fight.     For the pris'ners they took -- they shot 'em;       no odds were they small or great,     If they'd collared old Balmaceda, they reckoned to shoot him straight.     A lot of bloodthirsty devils they were -- but there ain't a doubt     They must have been real plucked 'uns -- the way that they fought it out,     And the king of 'em all, I reckon, the man that could stand a pinch,     Was the boss of a one-horse gunboat.  They called her the 'Admiral Lynch'.       Well, he was for Balmaceda, and after the war was done,     And Balmaceda was beaten and his troops had been forced to run,     The other man fetched his army and proceeded to do things brown,     He marched 'em into the fortress and took command of the town.     Cannon and guns and horses troopin' along the road,     Rumblin' over the bridges, and never a foeman showed     Till they came in sight of the harbour, and the very first thing they see     Was this mite of a one-horse gunboat a-lying against the quay,     And there as they watched they noticed a flutter of crimson rag,     And under their eyes he hoisted old Balmaceda's flag.     Well, I tell you it fairly knocked 'em -- it just took away their breath,     For he must ha' known if they caught him, 'twas nothin' but sudden death.     An' he'd got no fire in his furnace, no chance to put out to sea,     So he stood by his gun and waited with his vessel against the quay.       Well, they sent him a civil message to say that the war was done,     And most of his side were corpses, and all that were left had run;     And blood had been spilt sufficient, so they gave him a chance to decide     If he'd haul down his bit of bunting and come on the winning side.     He listened and heard their message, and answered them all polite,     That he was a Spanish hidalgo, and the men of his race _MUST_ fight!     A gunboat against an army, and with never a chance to run,     And them with their hundred cannon and him with a single gun:     The odds were a trifle heavy -- but he wasn't the sort to flinch,     So he opened fire on the army, did the boss of the 'Admiral Lynch'.       They pounded his boat to pieces, they silenced his single gun,     And captured the whole consignment, for none of 'em cared to run;     And it don't say whether they shot him -- it don't even give his name --     But whatever they did I'll wager that he went to his graveyard game.     I tell you those old hidalgos so stately and so polite,     They turn out the real Maginnis when it comes to an uphill fight.     There was General Alcantara, who died in the heaviest brunt,     And General Alzereca was killed in the battle's front;     But the king of 'em all, I reckon -- the man that could stand a pinch --     Was the man who attacked the army with the gunboat 'Admiral Lynch'.          A Bushman's Song           I'm travellin' down the Castlereagh, and I'm a station hand,     I'm handy with the ropin' pole, I'm handy with the brand,     And I can ride a rowdy colt, or swing the axe all day,     But there's no demand for a station-hand along the Castlereagh.       So it's shift, boys, shift, for there isn't the slightest doubt     That we've got to make a shift to the stations further out,     With the pack-horse runnin' after, for he follows like a dog,     We must strike across the country at the old jig-jog.       This old black horse I'm riding -- if you'll notice what's his brand,     He wears the crooked R, you see -- none better in the land.     He takes a lot of beatin', and the other day we tried,     For a bit of a joke, with a racing bloke, for twenty pounds a side.       It was shift, boys, shift, for there wasn't the slightest doubt     That I had to make him shift, for the money was nearly out;     But he cantered home a winner, with the other one at the flog --     He's a red-hot sort to pick up with his old jig-jog.       I asked a cove for shearin' once along the Marthaguy:     'We shear non-union here,' says he.  'I call it scab,' says I.     I looked along the shearin' floor before I turned to go --     There were eight or ten dashed Chinamen a-shearin' in a row.       It was shift, boys, shift, for there wasn't the slightest doubt     It was time to make a shift with the leprosy about.     So I saddled up my horses, and I whistled to my dog,     And I left his scabby station at the old jig-jog.       I went to Illawarra, where my brother's got a farm,     He has to ask his landlord's leave before he lifts his arm;     The landlord owns the country side -- man, woman, dog, and cat,     They haven't the cheek to dare to speak without they touch their hat.

He will put you in a wagon and be off in the rain,    You will go up on Tongue River on the U-S-U range.      You will drive up to the ranch and there you will stop.    It's a little sod house with dirt all on top.    You will ask what it is and they will tell you out plain    That it's the ranch house on the U-S-U range.      You will go in the house and he will begin to explain;    You will see some blankets rolled up on the floor;    You may ask what it is and they will tell you out plain    That it is the bedding on the U-S-U range.      You are up in the morning at the daybreak    To eat cold beef and U-S-U steak,    And out to your work no matter if it's rain,--    And that is the life on the U-S-U range.      You work hard all day and come in at night,    And turn your horse loose, for they say it's all right,    And set down to supper and begin to complain    Of the chuck that you eat on the U-S-U range.      The grub that you get is beans and cold rice    And U-S-U steak cooked up very nice;    And if you don't like that you needn't complain,    For that's what you get on the U-S-U range.      Now, kind friends, I must leave you, I no longer can remain,    I hope I have pleased you and given you no pain.    But when I am gone, don't think me strange,    For I have been a cow-puncher on the U-S-U range.          I'M A GOOD OLD REBEL        Oh, I'm a good old rebel, that's what I am;    And for this land of freedom, I don't care a damn,    I'm glad I fought agin her, I only wish we'd won,    And I don't axe any pardon for anything I've done.      I served with old Bob Lee, three years about,    Got wounded in four places and starved at Point Lookout;    I caught the rheumatism a-campin' in the snow,    But I killed a _chance_ of Yankees and wish I'd killed some mo'.          For I'm a good old rebel, etc.      I hate the constitooshin, this great republic too;    I hate the mouty eagle, an' the uniform so blue;    I hate their glorious banner, an' all their flags an' fuss,    Those lyin', thievin' Yankees, I hate 'em wuss an' wuss.          For I'm a good old rebel, etc.      I won't be re-constructed! I'm better now than them;    And for a carpet-bagger, I don't give a damn;    So I'm off for the frontier, soon as I can go,    I'll prepare me a weapon and start for Mexico.          For I'm a good old rebel, etc.          THE COWBOY        All day long on the prairies I ride,    Not even a dog to trot by my side;    My fire I kindle with chips gathered round,    My coffee I boil without being ground.      I wash in a pool and wipe on a sack;    I carry my wardrobe all on my back;    For want of an oven I cook bread in a pot,    And sleep on the ground for want of a cot.      My ceiling is the sky, my floor is the grass,    My music is the lowing of the herds as they pass;    My books are the brooks, my sermons the stones,    My parson is a wolf on his pulpit of bones.      And then if my cooking is not very complete    You can't blame me for wanting to eat.    But show me a man that sleeps more profound    Than the big puncher-boy who stretches himself on the ground.      My books teach me ever consistence to prize,    My sermons, that small things I should not despise;    My parson remarks from his pulpit of bones    That fortune favors those who look out for their own.      And then between me and love lies a gulf very wide.    Some lucky fellow may call her his bride.    My friends gently hint I am coming to grief,    But men must make money and women have beef.      But Cupid is always a friend to the bold,    And the best of his arrows are pointed with gold.    Society bans me so savage and dodge    That the Masons would ball me out of their lodge.      If I had hair on my chin, I might pass for the goat    That bore all the sins in the ages remote;    But why it is I can never understand,    For each of the patriarchs owned a big brand.      Abraham emigrated in search of a range,    And when water was scarce he wanted a change;    Old Isaac owned cattle in charge of Esau,    And Jacob punched cows for his father-in-law.      He started in business way down at bed rock,    And made quite a streak at handling stock;    Then David went from night-herding to using a sling;    And, winning the battle, he became a great king.    Then the shepherds, while herding the sheep on a hill,    Got a message from heaven of peace and goodwill.          The Cowboy (Mus. Not.)    Music by the \"Kid\"        All day on the prai-rie in the sad-dle I ride,    Not e-ven a dog, boys, to trot by my side.    My fire I must kin-dle with chips gathered round,    And boil my own cof-fee with-out be-ing ground.    I wash in a pool and I wipe on a sack,    I car-ry my ward-robe all on my back.          BILL PETERS, THE STAGE DRIVER        Bill Peters was a hustler    From Independence town;    He warn't a college scholar    Nor man of great renown,    But Bill had a way o' doing things    And doin' 'em up brown.      Bill driv the stage from Independence    Up to the Smokey Hill;    And everybody knowed him thar    As Independence Bill,--    Thar warn't no feller on the route    That driv with half the skill.      Bill driv four pair of horses,    Same as you'd drive a team,    And you'd think you was a-travelin'    On a railroad driv by steam;    And he'd git thar on time, you bet,    Or Bill 'u'd bust a seam.      He carried mail and passengers,    And he started on the dot,    And them teams o' his'n, so they say,    Was never known to trot;    But they went it in a gallop    And kept their axles hot.      When Bill's stage 'u'd bust a tire,    Or something 'u'd break down,    He'd hustle round and patch her up    And start off with a bound;    And the wheels o' that old shack o' his    Scarce ever touched the ground.      And Bill didn't low no foolin',    And when Inguns hove in sight    And bullets rattled at the stage,    He druv with all his might;    He'd holler, \"Fellers, give 'em hell,    I ain't got time to fight.\"      Then the way them wheels 'u'd rattle,    And the way the dust 'u'd fly,    You'd think a million cattle,    Had stampeded and gone by;    But the mail 'u'd get thar just the same,    If the horses had to die.      He driv that stage for many a year    Along the Smokey Hill,    And a pile o' wild Comanches    Did Bill Peters have to kill,--    And I reckon if he'd had good luck    He'd been a drivin' still.      But he chanced one day to run agin    A bullet made o' lead,    Which was harder than he bargained for    And now poor Bill is dead;    And when they brung his body home    A barrel of tears was shed.          HARD TIMES        Come listen a while and I'll sing you a song    Concerning the times--it will not be long--    When everybody is striving to buy,    And cheating each other, I cannot tell why,--    And it's hard, hard times.      From father to mother, from sister to brother,    From cousin to cousin, they're cheating each other.    Since cheating has grown to be so much the fashion,    I believe to my soul it will run the whole Nation,--    And it's hard, hard times.      Now there is the talker, by talking he eats,    And so does the butcher by killing his meats.    He'll toss the steelyards, and weigh it right down,    And swear it's just right if it lacks forty pounds,--    And it's hard, hard times.      And there is the merchant, as honest, we're told.    Whatever he sells you, my friend, you are sold;    Believe what I tell you, and don't be surprised    To find yourself cheated half out of your eyes,--    And it's hard, hard times.      And there is the lawyer you plainly will see,    He will plead your case for a very large fee,    He'll law you and tell you the wrong side is right,    And make you believe that a black horse is white,--    And it's hard, hard times.      And there is the doctor, I like to forgot,    I believe to my soul he's the worst of the lot;    He'll tell you he'll cure you for half you possess,    And when you're buried he'll take all the rest,--    And it's hard, hard times.      And there's the old bachelor, all hated with scorn,    He's like an old garment all tattered and torn,    The girls and the widows all toss him a sigh,    And think it quite right, and so do I,--    And it's hard, hard times.      And there's the young widow, coquettish and shy,    With a smile on her lips and a tear in her eye,    But when she gets married she'll cut quite a dash,    She'll give him the reins and she'll handle the cash,--    And it's hard, hard times.      And there's the young lady I like to have missed,    And I believe to my soul she'd like to be kissed;    She'll tell you she loves you with all pretence    And ask you to call again some time hence,--    And it's hard, hard times.      And there's the young man, the worst of the whole.    Oh, he will tell you with all of his soul,    He'll tell you he loves you and for you will die,    And when he's away he will swear it's a lie,--    And it's hard, hard times.          COLE YOUNGER        Am one of a band of highwaymen, Cole Younger is my name;    My crimes and depredations have brought my friends to shame;    The robbing of the Northfield Bank, the same I can't deny,    For now I am a prisoner, in the Stillwater jail I lie.      'Tis of a bold, high robbery, a story to you I'll tell,    Of a California miner who unto us befell;    We robbed him of his money and bid him go his way,    For which I will be sorry until my dying day.      And then we started homeward, when brother Bob did say:    \"Now, Cole, we will buy fast horses and on them ride away.    We will ride to avenge our father's death and try to win the prize;    We will fight those anti-guerrillas until the day we die.\"      And then we rode towards Texas, that good old Lone Star State,    But on Nebraska's prairies the James boys we did meet;    With knives, guns, and revolvers we all sat down to play,    A-drink"]]]
