The great initials are  double lined, and the interlinear space filled in with a flat tint of  colour and lines of red dots, as in the Book of Kells occasionally  follow the contours. Here, also, are the fish or bird-form letters as in  the Laon \"Orosius.\" Now and then occurs a tiny scene--perhaps a fight  between two grotesque brutes, neither fish, nor fowl, nor beast known to  the naturalist, but a horrible compound of the worst qualities of each.  The human figure, when it occurs, is childishly shapeless. But the  design and treatment, nevertheless, bear witness to a lively imagination  and considerable knowledge of Christian symbolism. It is these mental  qualities which, in spite of the manifest absence of manual skill,  render the Gellone Evangeliary one of the most precious monuments of its  time. Of the rest of the MSS. of this wretched period we will say  nothing.              \"Non ragioniam di lor', ma guard' e passa.\"    We are glad to hurry on for another century or so, remembering that the  leading idea now is the development of the initial letter.          CHAPTER IX    DEVELOPMENT OF THE INITIAL    The initial and initial paragraph the main object of decoration in  Celtic illumination--Study of the letter L as an example--The I of \"In  principio\" and the B of \"Beatus Vir.\"      From the moment when the initial was placed beneath the miniature the  object of the whole design was not to give prominence to the initial but  to the picture. Until then, that is, whilst the initial remains above or  beside or outside the picture, it is the initial we must watch for style  and development. And therefore we seize on one letter among those of the  latter part of the eighth century, because of the frequency of its  occurrence in the Gospel-book or Evangeliary, one of the commonest books  of the time. This the letter L of \"Liber Generationis,\" etc., the  commencing words of St. Matthew. This passage is always made of  importance, and on the initial and arrangement of the words the artist  expends his best efforts.    Properly I should here display pictorially the series of which I speak.  It would certainly be the quickest way of explaining the matter. But as  this is out of the question for many reasons, and as the present little  guide aims rather at showing the way than marching through it, the  reader must be content to take its advice about where to look for  examples which it cannot reproduce.    Regarding the letter L as an index of time and style, first we may take  the Irish L of the Book of Kells on p. 17, pt. 1, of Miss Stokes' _Early  Christian Art in Ireland_. Note first the form of the letter, then the  way it is filled up with ornament. Compare this, which dates from the  seventh century, with a similar L in the Ada-Codex in the Town Library  at Trèves, No. 22. A black and white copy of this is given in taf. 6 of  Lamprecht Initial Ornamentik. This carries up the work to the second  half of the eighth century. Next, say the L in the Town Archives at  Cologne, No. 147. This belongs to the second half of the ninth century.  The chief departure here is towards the knotted band work which figures  so largely afterwards both in German and Italian book ornament, the form  is still unchanged. But with the tenth century comes change of form as  well as of mode of filling, as for example taf. 19 of Lamprecht, in  which there is a complete alteration of treatment. The student may take  for similar comparison also the I of \"In principio\" of St. John's  Gospel, and the B of the first psalm in the Psalter, and carry the  comparison on to the end of the fourteenth century, by referring to the  MSS. in the British Museum and other public libraries, or in the  numerous illustrated works to be found in those collections.          CHAPTER X    FIRST ENGLISH STYLES    Transition from Iona to Lindisfarne--Influence of Frankish art--The  \"Opus Anglicum\"--The Winchester school and its characteristics--Whence  obtained--Method of painting--Examples--Where found and described.      The succession of the school of Iona shows us in the first examples of  English illumination the type exemplified in the Book of Kells,  modified, but not very much, by its transference to Lindisfarne.    Whatever doubt may be felt as to the influence of Byzantine or  Romanesque models on pure Irish work, such as the Book of Kells, there  can be none as regards the Lindisfarne Gospels. In the first place we  have gold both in the lettering and ornament. This MS., known also as  the Durham Book (Brit. Mus., Nero D. iv.), was the work of Abbat  Eadfrith, of Lindisfarne. It has been often described, as it is really a  most precious example of eighth-century art in this country. No other  MS. of its time is to be found in any continental scriptorium to be  compared with it. It is not a collection of clumsy inartistic attempts  at ornamental writing, but high-class, effective work, which should be  seen and studied by every student of illumination.    From its style of execution, its details of portraiture, and other  features, it may be looked on as one of the earliest links between the  two extremes of Oriental and Occidental Art.    Another MS. in the British Museum (Vesp. A. 1), which combines the Roman  method of painting as in the Vergils with the penwork of these  Anglo-Celtic Gospel-books, may also repay careful examination.    It is very possible that the celebrated _scriptoria_ of York and Jarrow  may have been furnished with both MSS. and copyists from Rome, yet there  can be little doubt that the intercourse with Durham would be quite as  active. Nor is it less probable that similar intercourse would keep them  _en rapport_ with Oxford, St. Alban's, Westminster, Glastonbury, and  other _scriptoria_, so that in the eighth century England stood with  respect to art second to no other country in the Christian world.    During the ninth century active intercourse with the Frankish Empire  enriched English churches and religious houses, especially Winchester,  with examples of Byzantine and Roman models, which Charlemagne had  introduced into his own palatine schools. From such secondary models as  the Sacramentaries and Evangeliaries executed at Tours, Soissons, Metz,  and other busy centres of production, English illuminators succeeded in  forming a distinctive style of their own. In the French or, rather,  Frankish MSS., while the richness of the gold and the beauty and  delicacy of the colouring are in themselves most charming, and while  certain features may in general be recognised as no doubt suggestive  there is nothing which quite predicts the remarkable treatment which  characterises the English work. \"Opus Anglicum\" was its distinctive  title. The term, indeed, was applied to all English artistic productions  more or less--embroidery among the rest. The women of England, says  William of Poitiers, were famous for their needlework, the men excelled  in metal-work and jewellery. But it was the illuminated Service Books  that have perpetuated the term.    From the Lindisfarne Gospels to the Winchester Benedictionals is a far  cry--but Art is long and time is fleeting, hence many pages of  intervening description must be omitted. We may, however, refer the  reader to Westwood's _Palæographia Sacra Pictoria_, the Palæographical  Society's publications, and other works, for enlightenment on this  period. On the Rouen and Devonshire Benedictionals much interesting  information may be found in vol. 24 of the _Archæologia_ and in the  recent volume of the Bradshaw Society concerning them.    The work is peculiar; and if we consider the treatment of foliage apart  from the colour, we cannot but notice its similarity to the ivory  carving observable in the consular diptychs. Ivory carving was then a  popular artistic occupation. The foliage is graceful, the composition  well-balanced, and the colour mostly bright body colour applied in the  Greek manner. The fault of the heads is that they are too small for the  figure, and of the draperies that the folds are overdone too much  fluttering detail. The gilding differs from the Byzantine in not being  laid on the vellum in the form of burnished leaf, but painted on like  the colours, not only in the figures but in the framework and ornaments.    The British Museum contains several characteristic examples, but, as has  been said, the very finest are those at Rouen and in the library of the  Duke of Devonshire.    Perhaps no genuine example exists earlier than the Golden Charter of  King Edgar of true Winchester illumination, executed forty years after  the accession of Athelstan, whose Coronation Book (Brit. Mus., Tib. A.  2) is most probably not English at all, but Carolingian of the finest  type. Many other _scriptoria_ in England in the tenth century were  equally busy with Winchester, but none could vie with the royal city in  the production of illuminated books.          CHAPTER XI    CAROLINGIAN ILLUMINATION    Why so-called--Works to be consulted--The Library of St. Gall--Rise and  progress of Carolingian art--Account of various MSS.--Features of the  style--Gospels of St. Sernin--The Ada-Codex--Centres of  production--Other splendid examples--The Alcuin Bible--The Gospel of St.  Médard of Soissons.      Once more crossing the Channel let us now inquire what has been doing  among the Franks since the Gellone Sacramentary, especially in the  schools instituted by the Emperor Charles the Great. Materials for this  inquiry are most abundant. One of the more important works on the  subject is the lucid monograph of Dr. Rahn, of Zurich, on the Golden  Psalter of Folchard at St. Gall, which deals more or less with the whole  question of Carolingian art, while M. Léop. Delisle's brochure on the  Evangeliary of St. Vaast of Arras gives us a copious account of the  Franco-Saxon branch of it. Apart, however, from these sources of  information, we have not a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19880"],[0,"Voice Production in Singing and Speaking (#10)"],[1,"lows, must be  developed. To some Nature has been generous--they have large chests;  to others she has given a smaller wind-chest, but has perhaps  compensated by providing an especially fine voice-box. Happy are they  who have both, and thrice happy those who have all three requirements:  a fine chest, a well-constructed larynx, and beautifully formed  resonance-chambers. If with all these there are the musical ear and  the artistic temperament, we have the singer who is born great. These  are the very few. To most it must be--if greatness at all--greatness  thrust upon them, greatness the result of long and patient effort to  attain perfect development. Indeed, even those with the most complete  natural outfit can only reach the highest results of which they are  capable by long and patient application. Those who do not believe in  attainment only through labor would do well to abandon an art career,  as there is already a great deal too much poor speaking and bad  singing.          CHAPTER V.    BREATHING WITH SPECIAL REGARD TO PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS.      The first great requisite for a voice-user is a well-developed chest;  the next, complete control of it, or, to put it otherwise, the art of  breathing, as briefly explained above.    The chest may be large enough, yet not be, in the physiological sense,  developed. The voice-user is a sort of athlete, a specialist whose  chest muscles must be strong and not covered up by very much  superfluous tissue in the form of fat, etc. Whatever the public may  think of the goodly form, the singer must remember that fat is  practically of no use to any one in voice-production, and may prove a  great hindrance, possibly in some cases being a cooeperative cause of  that _tremolo_ so fatal to good singing.    [Illustration: FIG. 16. The appearance of a well-developed, healthy  person, with special reference to the chest.]    [Illustration: FIG. 17. The appearance of the chest after undue  compression, as with corsets.]    [Illustration: FIG. 18. In this figure, the dark curved line in the  middle is meant to represent the position, etc., of the diaphragm,  beneath which, and fitting closely to it, are the liver, stomach, and  other abdominal organs, in this case not pressed upon or injured in  any way. This represents the normal human being.]    [Illustration: FIG. 19. A condition the reverse of that represented in  the preceding. The vital organs are pressed upon, with results some of  which are obvious; others equally serious are not such as appear to  the eye.]    The voice-user should eschew ease and take plenty of exercise, but  most of all must he use those forms of exercise which develop the  breathing apparatus and tend to keep it in the best condition.  Walking, running, and hill climbing are all excellent, but do not in  themselves suffice to develop the chest to the utmost.    To the beginner the following exercises are strongly recommended. They  are highly important for all, whether beginners or not, who would  have the best development of the breathing apparatus.    Deep breathing, such a use of the respiratory organs as leads to the  greatest possible expansion of the chest, should be learned and  practised, if not absolutely before vocal exercises are attempted, at  all events as soon after as possible. As in all cases where muscles  are employed, the exercise should be _graduated_. It may be even  harmful to attempt to fill the chest to its utmost capacity at once.  It is better to breathe very moderately for several days. Any such  symptoms as dizziness or headache accompanying or following the  exercises indicate that they have been too vigorous, too long  continued, or carried out under unsuitable conditions. Above all must  the air be pure, and the body absolutely unhampered--most of all, the  chest--by any form of clothing. Last century most ladies and some men  applied to the chest a form of apparatus known as corsets, under the  mistaken belief that they were for women a necessary support and  improved the figure. They no doubt were responsible for much lack of  development, and feeble health, and, as has been proved by examination  of the body after death, led to compression of the liver and other  organs. No voice-user should use such an effective means of preventing  the very thing he should most desire, a full and free use of the  breathing apparatus.    Before carrying out the exercises suggested or others equally good,  the student is recommended to be weighed, and especially to have the  chest carefully _measured_. This can be done with sufficient accuracy  by the use of a tape-measure. It will be well to take the  circumference a few inches above and below a certain point, so that it  may be ascertained that the chest expands in every region. The  measurements should be taken under the following conditions:    1. The chest should be almost or wholly divested of clothing.    2. Its circumference is to be ascertained--(_a_) when the breath has  been allowed to pass out gently, and before a new breath is taken;  (_b_) with the deepest possible inspiration; (_c_) after the deepest  possible expiration, which has been preceded by a similar inspiration.    After about three weeks the individual should be again measured, by  the same person, in exactly the same way, in order to learn whether  there has been development or not, and, if so, how much. It is  important that the measurements should be made at exactly the same  horizontal planes, and with this end in view it is desirable to put a  small mark of some kind on the chest, which may remain till the next  measurements are made.    The method of breathing recommended is as follows:    1. Inhale very slowly through the nostrils, with closed mouth,  counting mentally one, two, three, four, etc., with regularity.    2. Hold the breath thus taken, but only for a short time, counting in  the same manner as before.    3. Exhale slowly, still counting.    After a few moments' rest the exercise may be again carried out in the  same way. These exercises may be in series, several times a day.    The following warnings are especially to be observed:    1. Never continue any exercise when there is a sense of discomfort of  any kind whatever. Such usually indicates that it is being carried out  too vigorously.    2. Increase the depth of the inspirations daily, but not very rapidly.    3. The inspirations and expirations should both be carried out very  slowly at first.    4. Cease the exercise before any sense of fatigue is experienced.  Fatigue is Nature's warning, and should be always obeyed. It indicates  that the waste products which result from the use of the muscles are  accumulating and proving harmful.    After a week of such exercises the following modification of them is  recommended:    1. Inhale with the lips slightly apart.    2. Gradually increase the length of the time the breath is held, but  let it never exceed a few seconds.    3. Through open lips allow the breath to pass out, but with extreme  slowness. The student should try to increase this last, somewhat,  daily, as it is above all what is required in singing, and also in  speaking, though to a somewhat less degree--a slow, regulated  expulsion of the breath.    If when the chest is full of air the subject gently raises the arms  over the head, or directs them backward, he will experience a sense of  pressure on the chest. If this be carefully done, its effect is to  strengthen, and it is especially valuable for those inclined to stoop.  The recommendation to inspire through the open lips applies only when  one is in a room, or in the open air when it is warm enough and free  from dust. But the student should learn to inspire through the  slightly open mouth, as to breathe through the nose in speaking, and  especially in singing, is objectionable for several reasons which can  be better explained later; so that the rule is to _breathe through the  nose when not using the voice, and through the mouth when one does_.    Though all the exercises thus far referred to tend to develop the  diaphragm and abdominal muscles, these may be strengthened by special  exercises. The diaphragm is the soft floor of the chest, and must at  once bear the strain of the air that acts on the approximated vocal  bands, and assist in applying that pressure with just the amount of  force required, and no more; hence it is important that this muscle be  both strong and under perfect control. This large central muscle is  probably not only the most generally effective of all the respiratory  muscles, but has an action more precise and often more delicate, more  nicely controlled, than that of any other. It is possible to make very  powerful movements of this muscle, and an exercise that will cause it  to descend deeply and remain in a tense condition is valuable. To  effect this, one pushes it down as far as possible, and holds it there  for a few seconds, then permits it to relax gradually. The extent to  which this is successful can be inferred from the degree to which the  abdominal wall bulges forward.    The sudden though slight movements required in those forms of  vocalization that bear more or less resemblance to what vocalists term  _staccato_, and which are so effective in dramatic speaking and  singing, can be prepared for by larger but sudden movements of the  diaphragm, as when one taking a full breath imitates coughing  movements, but in a regular and measured way, the throat being used  but little. At the same time, or separately, the abdominal muscles may  be effectively exercised by being drawn in and thrust out with  considerable force.    None of these movements are elegant--they scarcely put one in an  artistic light; but they are highly effective in strengthening parts  every voice-user must employ.    To furnish adequate support for the diaphragm and chest in a very  vigorous use of the voice, as in the most trying passages a"]]]
