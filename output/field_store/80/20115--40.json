Its history, (#5)"],[1,"vertigo, and almost delirious  with pain, would fall during this first period, as if struck by  lightning.    The same phenomena are sometimes observed in the typhoid fever of man,  which offers moreover some analogy with the contagious typhus of the ox;  but as the ox and the horse have likewise the real typhus fever, they  may some day supply us with the preventive virus for that fever, in the  same manner as the cow now supplies us with the preventive virus for the  small-pox.    _2nd Period._--In most cases the disease pursued its course with greater  or less regularity; the sick animal experienced gnawing pains or  twitchings, and spasmodic shootings in the limbs, apparently attended  with pain. His thirst was insatiable, but he had no appetite, the  functions of the bladder and intestines were impeded, then diarrhoea  supervened, accompanied with dry, fetid, and sometimes bloody excreta.  Thick viscid mucosities dripped from the nostrils, mouth, and eyes. The  dorsal regions and the loins were constantly aching, headache and  sleeplessness were permanent. The animal continued either standing or  lying down, and if he wanted to rest, he could not bend himself  gradually, but would fall like an inert mass to the ground.    _3rd Period._--Diarrhoea was continual, becoming more fetid every day,  the wasting of flesh made rapid strides; the cellular tissue beneath the  hide was filled with gas along the vertebral channels and under the  abdomen; the nostrils were stopped up with mucosities, the animal could  only breathe through the mouth, puffing and blowing aloud as he drew in  the air; and at last pustular eruptions showed themselves on various  parts; but as this depurating crisis was insufficient, the poor beast,  in this final period of the attack, fell a sacrifice to it between the  seventh and twelfth day. If he chanced to be lying down his agony was  slow, but if standing, he would sink upon himself, and expire at once.    In this dreadful epizootia, very few of the smitten cattle survived--not  more than four or five in a hundred; and in these favourable cases, the  symptoms presented certain signs and critical phenomena of a happy omen.  In these rare exceptions, the pulse did not exceed seventy, the  beatings of the heart were always perceptible, the patient did not  refuse to drink, the continuous fever exhibited no aggravation at night,  pustular eruptions and tumours appeared on the dewlap and the fore  limbs, and the epidermis over the mouth and nostrils peeled off about  the twelfth day.    When dissected, the bodies offered to view the following alterations,  the same having already been observed by Frascator during the prevalence  of the epizootia in 1514, and by Lancisi and Ramazzini during that which  was so fatal in 1711. The mucous glands of the mouth were livid, and  occasionally excoriated; the bronchial tubes were obstructed with  mucosities; the lungs, besides being partially congested, were sometimes  emphysematous, that is, inflated with compressed air. Of the four  stomachs, the rumen was full of food, the reticulum, the omasum, and the  abomasum exhibited purple or livid spots, according to their place. The  thin intestine and the thick intestine showed either a general  injection, scattered livid spots, or ulcerations, according as the fever  had worn the exanthematous or typhoid form; for the mucous membrane of  the digestive channels, and especially that of the intestines, displays,  like the external tegument in man and the brute creation, divers forms  of inflammation, analogous with the measles, the scarlatina, and the  small-pox; so that, if the typhoid fever in man, which is nothing else  than the small-pox of the intestines, is so frequently cured, it is  because the general morbid condition, the fever, often conceals  different intestinal lesions, albeit they seem to be similar in the  general symptoms, which taken collectively constitute the disease.    The flesh of these diseased animals was blackish, and devoid of blood;  the animals which fed upon it, if uncooked, sickened afterwards, or  died. The wrecks of the bodies, and more particularly the skin,  sometimes retained a strength of contagion so deadly, that the mere  exportation of them was enough to cause its propagation, and to this  cause was at that time attributed the outbreak of the contagion in  England.    An extraordinary case of this pernicious influence, which is related by  Hartmann, who observed this epizootia at its decline in 1756, will give  an idea of the subtlety of this malignant virus.    A farmer who had lost an ox in consequence of that virulent distemper,  buried it in one of his fields. The following night a bear smelt the ox,  raked it up with his feet, ate a portion of the flesh, and a few days  after, the beast of prey was found dead in a neighbouring wood by a  peasant in the parish of Eumaki. The skin belonging to this bear was  magnificent. The peasant flayed the animal and carried home his skin in  triumph. But his triumph was short; for that same night the poor  countryman fell ill, and died two days after the attack. The magistrates  of Wiburg, having heard of this occurrence, sent orders to have the  infected skin burned. Meanwhile, the skin had been given to the curate  of the place as a compensation for the offices of burial; but his  cupidity having persuaded him that this fine skin could not have  destroyed the peasant whom he had just buried, he did not burn it at  all, but induced another peasant to clean and dress it for him. This  simple fellow and two other clodpoles, who assisted him in the  preparation, fell ill, and all three of them died in the course of a  few days. A new and peremptory order now came from Wiburg to burn this  skin, to burn the house in which it had been dressed, to burn even the  presbytery itself, should it be deemed necessary. The skin had already  passed through several hands. However, the curate being still reluctant  to part with it, took it home again. \"Can it be possible,\" said he to  himself, \"that this skin has really proved fatal to life? What can have  been the cause, I wonder?\" At the same time he rubbed it in his hands  and smelt it. Unlucky curate! A few days afterwards he himself was taken  ill and died. (_Memoirs of the Academy of Stockholm._)    A native of Clermont Ferrand, in the department of Puy de Dome, in  France, the birth-place of Pascal, one day finding an ox which had died  of the epizootia, stripped off the skin and carried it away. After his  return home, the black typhus, and then gangrene, broke out on one of  his arms, which had to be cut off, and the patient died of the effects  of the amputation.    A butcher having slaughtered an ox smitten with this typhus, sold the  flesh for meat to some soldiers of the Regiment Royal Baviere, then  garrisoned in one of the towns of Languedoc. All those who partook of  this meat were seized with diarrhoea, dysentery, and fever, and  several of the sick soldiers very nearly died. The butcher, whose  avarice had caused all this mischief, had richly deserved some exemplary  punishment, and some of the sufferers proposed that he should be hanged  outright, but the majority, more clement, sentenced him to be beaten  black and blue with horsewhips.    The popular saying, _when the beast is dead the poison is dead_, being  generally true, the virulence of the contagion, in the above instances,  possessed venomous properties of an exceptional character, for if every  sick animal slaughtered by the butchers and sold to the consumers, or  those which had been flayed for the sake of the skin, had contained so  murderous a virus in their tissues, the number of victims to the  contagion among the human species would have been appalling. And in that  case, too, similar sacrifices would be witnessed at present, for it  cannot be doubted that, in the actual state of the meat market in  London, the people are now in the daily habit of eating the flesh of  cattle which are diseased.      IV.    Physicians of different countries have naturally bestowed much time and  care in considering and discussing the nature of this epizootia, because  they have felt that a satisfactory theory and appreciation of its  principal phenomena, might afford the medical faculty a rational basis  for some special treatment.    Layard and the physicians of Geneva have considered this cattle disease  to be _a malignant fever with an eruptive tendency_.    In the estimation of the faculties of Paris and Montpellier, this cattle  disease, considered in its symptoms, was nothing more than _a malignant  fever essentially contagious_, the action of which appeared to tend  exclusively towards the skin, and therefore it was rational to provoke  external eruptions and deposits which, as they matured, diverted from  the centre the greatest part of the morbific matter.    _The treatment_, to which, above all, we invite the reader's attention  (more particularly that of medical men), necessarily varied according to  the period of the disease. It was sometimes preservative, sometimes  curative, as the case might be.    _The Preventive Treatment._--The farmers and cattle-breeders, whose  herds were still exempt from the contagion, mindful of the advice which  they received through the public press, took very particular care of  their cattle during this season of epizootia: they rubbed them over with  a brush, and washed them at least once a day; they sheltered them from  the inclemency of wind and rain; they took their milch cows, which until  then they had kept shut up in unhealthy cow-houses, into the open air of  the fields; they washed and fumigated the stables; they examined the  quality of the fodder and of the other articles of food; they added  marine salt to their drinking water, or poured salt water over their  forage; and above all, they took care that no foreign animal commingled  with their flocks and herds."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36504"],[0,"Freshwater Sponges, Hydroids & Polyzoa (#5)"],[1,"stratiotes_, _Lemna_, and _Limnanthemum_, and a few have  brickwork or artificial stonework at their sides. In those parts of the  town that approach the Salt Lakes (large lagoons and swamps of brackish  water connected with the sea by the Mutlah River) the water of the ponds  is slightly brackish and permits few plants except algae to flourish. Few  of the bigger tanks ever dry up. The best of the tanks from the  sponge-collector's point of view, so far as I have been able to  discover, is the one in the compound of the Indian Museum. It enjoys all  the advantages of light and shade, solid supports, prolific aquatic  vegetation, considerable depth, and the vicinity of human dwellings that  seem to be favourable to the growth of sponges, no less than nine  species of which, representing three genera and two subgenera, grow  abundantly in it. _Hydra_ also flourishes in this pond, but for some  reasons there are few polyzoa. The phylactolaematous species of the  latter group, however, are extraordinarily abundant in one of the tanks  in the Zoological Gardens at Alipore. In this tank, which unlike the  Museum tank is directly connected with the river, no less than six  species and varieties of the genus _Plumatella_ have been found growing  together on sticks, floating seeds, and water-plants. Except _Hislopia_,  which is common on _Vallisneria_ in one tank on the Maidan (opposite the  Bengal Club), the ctenostomes of stagnant water are only found in the  tanks near the Salt Lakes.    PORT CANNING is situated on the Mutlah River about 30 miles from  Calcutta and about 60 from the open sea. The Mutlah is really a tidal  creek rather than a river, in spite of the fact that it runs for a  considerable number of miles, and its waters are distinctly brackish.  Water taken from the edge at Port Canning in March was found to contain  25.46 per thousand of saline residue. The interesting feature of Port  Canning, however, is from a zoological point of view not the Mutlah but  certain ponds of brackish water now completely separated from it, except  occasionally when the river is in flood, but communicating regularly  with it in the memory of living persons. These ponds, which were  apparently not in existence in 1855, have on an average an area of about  half an acre each, and were evidently formed by the excavation of earth  for the construction of an embankment along the Mutlah. They are very  shallow and lie exposed to the sun. The salinity differs considerably in  different ponds, although the fauna seems to be identical; the water of  one pond was found to contain 22.88 per thousand of saline residue in  May, 20.22 per thousand in March, and 12.13 in December. A second pond  in the neighbourhood of the first and apparently similar to it in every  way contained only 9.82 per thousand in July, after the rains had  broken. The fauna of these ponds includes not only a freshwater sponge  (_Spongilla alba_ var. _bengalensis_) but also many aquatic insects  (_e. g._, larvae of mosquitos and of _Chironomus_ and several species of  beetles and Rhynchota); while on the other hand essentially marine  coelenterates (_Irene ceylonensis_, etc.) and worms (_e. g._, the  gephyrean _Physcosoma lurco_[G]) form a part of it, together with forms  of intermediate habitat such as _Bowerbankia caudata_ subsp.  _bengalensis_, _Victorella bengalensis_, and several fish and crustacea  common in brackish water.         [Footnote G: I am indebted to Mr. W. F. Lanchester for the       identification of this species.]    _Orissa._    Orissa may be described in general terms as consisting of the coastal  area of Bengal south of the Gangetic delta. It extends in inland,  however, for a considerable distance and includes hilly tracts. There is  no geographical boundary between it and the north-eastern part of the  Madras Presidency or the eastern part of the Central Provinces.    CHILKA LAKE.--This marine lake is a shallow lagoon measuring about 40  miles in length and 10 miles in breadth, and formed in geologically  recent times by the growth of a narrow sand-bank across the mouth of a  wide bay. At its northern end it communicates with the sea by a narrow  channel, and throughout its length it is strongly affected by the tides.  At its south end, which is actually situated in the Ganjam district of  Madras, the water is distinctly brackish and is said to be nearly fresh  at certain times of year. At this end there are numerous small  artificial pools of brackish water somewhat resembling those of Port  Canning as regards their fauna.    SUR (or SAR) LAKE.--A shallow, freshwater lake of very variable size  situated a few miles north of Puri on the Orissa coast. In origin it  probably resembled the Chilka Lake, but it is now separated from the sea  by about 3 miles of barren sand dunes, among which numerous little pools  of rain-water are formed during the rains. These dry up completely in  winter, and even the lake itself is said sometimes almost to disappear,  although when it is full it is several miles in length. The fauna is  essentially a freshwater one, but includes certain Mysidae and other  crustacea usually found in brackish water.    _Bombay Presidency._    BOMBAY.--The town of Bombay, built on an island near the mainland, is  situated close to swamps and creeks of brackish water not unlike those  that surround Calcutta. Its \"tanks,\" however, differ from those of  Calcutta in having rocky bottoms and, in many cases, in drying up  completely in the hot weather. Of the fauna of the swamps extremely  little is known, but so far as the sponges and polyzoa of the tanks are  concerned the work undertaken by Carter was probably exhaustive.    IGATPURI.--Igatpuri is situated at an altitude of about 2000 feet, 60  miles north-east of Bombay. Above the town there is a lake of several  square miles in area whence the water-supply of several stations in the  neighbourhood is obtained. The water is therefore kept free from  contamination. The bottom is composed of small stones and slopes  gradually up at the edges. During the dry weather its level sinks  considerably. Several interesting sponges and polyzoa have been found in  this lake, most of them also occurring in a small pond in the  neighbourhood in which clothes are washed and the water is often full of  soap-suds.    _Southern India._    MADRAS.--The city of Madras is built by the sea, straggling over a large  area of the sandy soil characteristic of the greater part of the east  coast of India. In wet weather this soil retains many temporary pools of  rain-water, and there are numerous permanent tanks of no great size in  the neighbourhood of the town. The so-called Cooum River, which flows  through the town, is little more than a tidal creek, resembling the  Mutlah River of Lower Bengal on a much smaller scale. The sponges and  polyzoa as yet found in the environs of Madras are identical with those  found in the environs of Calcutta.    BANGALORE.--Bangalore (Mysore State) is situated near the centre of the  Madras Presidency on a plateau about 3000 feet above sea-level. The  surrounding country is formed of laterite rock which decomposes readily  and forms a fine reddish silt in the tanks. These tanks are numerous,  often of large size, and as a rule at least partly of artificial origin.  Their water supports few phanerogamic plants and is, as my friend Dr.  Morris Travers informs me, remarkably free from salts in solution. The  sponge fauna of the neighbourhood of Bangalore appears to be  intermediate between that of Madras and that of Travancore.    THE BACKWATERS OF COCHIN AND TRAVANCORE.--The \"backwaters\" of Cochin and  Travancore were originally a series of shallow lagoons stretching along  the coast of the southern part of the west coast of India for a distance  of considerably over a hundred miles. They have now been joined together  by means of canals and tunnels to form a tidal waterway, which  communicates at many points directly with the sea. The salinity of the  water differs greatly at different places and in different seasons, and  at some places there is an arrangement to keep out sea-water while the  rice-fields are being irrigated. The fauna is mainly marine, but in the  less saline parts of the canals and lakes many freshwater species are  found.    _Shasthancottah._--There are two villages of this name, one situated on  the backwater near Quilon (coast of Travancore), the other about three  miles inland on a large freshwater lake. This lake, which does not  communicate with the backwater, occupies a narrow winding rift several  miles in length at a considerable depth below the surrounding country.  Its bottom is muddy and it contains few water-plants, although in some  places the water-plants that do exist are matted together to form  floating islands on which trees and bushes grow. The fauna, at any rate  as regards mollusca and microscopic organisms, is remarkably poor, but  two species of polyzoa (_Fredericella indica_ and _Plumatella  fruticosa_) and one of sponge (_Trochospongilla pennsylvanica_) grow in  considerable abundance although not in great luxuriance.    _The Himalayas._    BHIM TAL[H] is a lake situated at an altitude of 4500 feet in that part  of the Western Himalayas known as Kumaon, near the plains. It has a  superficial area of several square miles, and is deep in the middle. Its  bottom and banks are for the most part muddy. Little is known of its  fauna, but two polyzoa (_Plumatella allmani_ and _Lophopodella carteri_)  and the gemmules of two sponges (_Spongilla carteri_ and _Ephydatia  meyeni_) have been found in it.         [Footnote H: The fauna of this lake and of others in the       neighbourhood has recently been investigated by Mr. S. W.       Kemp.
