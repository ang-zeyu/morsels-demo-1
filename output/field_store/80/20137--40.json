The probable position of the connectives is shown  and the proportionate distances between ganglia are given. The upper  ganglion is the cerebro-pleural with large nerves leading off from the  ganglion which is itself lobed into four chief lobes. The pedal  ganglion is next. In section the pedal ganglion at one place seems to  be made up of four parts which may correspond to four connectives from  the cerebro-pleural although only one pair of connectives was clearly  determined. The visceral ganglion is connected with the pedal below.  x70.    Fig. 2. Cross section of cerebro-pleural ganglion. On the right side  one of the lateral ganglia is shown. The one of the other side does not  show because the section is not straight across. The dorsal side is up.  x300.    Fig. 3. Section of the pedal mass of _Nucula_, through the center.

I reidentify as _M. aureolum_  the two specimens recorded by Jennings (_loc. cit._) as _M.  erythrurum_.    The subspecific status of _M. aureolum_ in the Kansas River Basin is  to be the subject of another paper.    =Catostomus commersonnii= (Lacepede), white sucker: Canfield and Wiebe  (1931:8) as \"common suckers\"; and Breukelman (1940:380). Stations 7-G,  11-G, 12-G, 13-G, 16-G, 18-G, 19-G, 23-G, 29-G, 31-G, 53-S, 57-M, and  58-G.    The white sucker occurred primarily in upland streams of the Flint  Hills, with one occurrence in muddy habitat, and one in the main  stream of the Big Blue River. Young _C. commersonnii_ were often  taken in riffles, but adults were in the larger, deeper pools. The  ages and total lengths at the last annulus for 12 white suckers  were: I, 2.8 (4); II, 3.9 (6); III, 8.2 (1); and IV, 9.2 (1).    =Cyprinus carpio= Linnaeus, carp: Canfield and Wiebe (1931:5-8, 10)  as \"carp.\" Stations 1-S, 2-S, 3-S, 4-S, 6-S, 7-G, 8-S, 15-S, 16-G,  18-G, 23-G, 24-G, 25-S, 27-G, 30-M, 35-M, 38-S, 41-S, 42-S, 43-S,  44-S, 45-M, 52-S, 53-S, and 56-S.    Carp occurred throughout the basin. The habitat of this species  closely approximated that of the river carpsucker; however, carp  were more often taken in moderate to swift water than were _C. c.  carpio_.    The ages and average lengths at the last annulus for 40 carp from  the Big Blue River Basin were: I, 2.3 (4); II, 4.7 (10); III, 7.0  (10); IV, 9.0 (3); V, 11.3 (4); VI, 18.6 (1); VII, 18.9 (3); VIII,  no fish; IX, 20.6 (3); X, 19.1 (2); XI, 21.1 (1); XII, 22.0 (1); and  XIII, 24.1 (2).    =Carassius auratus= (Linnaeus), goldfish. Station 4-S.    I saw goldfish seined from Station 4-S by anglers obtaining bait on  April 20, 1957. Goldfish were commonly used for bait at Stations 4-S  and 54-S.    =Semotilus atromaculatus= (Mitchill), creek chub: Evermann and Cox  (1896:399); and Jennings (1942:364) as _Semotilus atromaculatus  atromaculatus_ (Mitchill). Stations 5-G, 7-G, 10-G, 11-G, 12-G,  13-G, 16-G, 17-G, 18-G, 23-G, 24-G, 27-G, 28-G, 29-G, 31-G, 32-G,  33-M, 34-M, 36-M, 37-M, 40-M, 46-M, 47-M, 48-M, 49-M, 50-S, 53-S,  54-G, 55-M, 56-S, 57-M, 58-G, and 59-G.    Creek chubs were found in all habitats in the Big Blue River Basin,  but were abundant only in the headwaters of muddy streams and in  clear upland creeks.    =Chrosomus erythrogaster= (Rafinesque), southern redbelly dace:  Jennings (1942:365). Stations 11-G, 12-G, 13-G, 16-G, 27-G, 29-G,  and 53-S.    This colorful species occupied the headwaters of the clear,  spring-fed creeks where it was abundant. Only one specimen was taken  in muddy or sandy habitat (at the mouth of a small creek at Station  53-S), where it may have been washed by floods just prior to my  collecting.    =Hybopsis storeriana= (Kirtland), silver chub. Station 3-S.    One specimen of _H. storeriana_ (KU 3810) was seined in swift water  near a sandbar on April 6, 1957, and another was taken at the same  locality on April 26, 1958.    =Hybopsis aestivalis= (Girard), speckled chub: Meek (1895:137); and  Evermann and Cox (1896:409), both as _Hybopsis hyostomus_ Gilbert.  Stations 3-S, 4-S, 14-S, 25-S, 38-S, 39-S, 50-S, and 56-S.    This species was restricted to wide, swift parts of the Big Blue and  Little Blue rivers, and was found over clean, sometimes shifting,  sand bottoms. On May 29, 1958, three males in breeding condition  were collected and on June 16, 1958, a large series of both male and  female _H. aestivalis_, all with well-developed gonads, was  collected. The water temperature was 77.0 deg.F. Hubbs and Ortenburger  (1929:25-26) reported that _Extrarius tetranemus_ (Gilbert) (=  _Hybopsis aestivalis tetranemus_) spawns in summer especially in  early July. Cross (1950:135) reported a single pair of _H. a.  tetranemus_ that he considered in breeding condition on June 9,  1948.    Breukelman (1940:380) recorded speckled chubs in the Kansas River  Basin as _Extrarius_ (= _Hybopsis_) _aestivalis_: _sesquialis_ x  _tetranemus_; however, the name _sesquialis_ is a _nomen nudum_,  and the status of this species in the Kansas River Basin is yet to  be elucidated.    =Phenacobius mirabilis= (Girard), plains suckermouth minnow: Meek  (1895:136); and Evermann and Cox (1896:408). Stations 2-S, 3-S, 4-S,  5-G, 6-S, 7-G, 8-S, 9-G, 11-G, 16-G, 18-G, 25-S, 26-G, 27-G, 35-M,  38-S, 39-S, 40-M, 42-S, 47-M, 50-S, 52-S, 53-S, 54-G, and 56-S.    _Phenacobius mirabilis_ was widespread in the basin, occurring most  frequently on riffles over bottoms of clean sand or gravel.  Young-of-the-year were usually taken in backwaters.    =Notropis percobromus= (Cope), plains shiner. Stations 3-S and 4-S.    The plains shiner occurred only in the lower part of the main stream  of the Big Blue River.    =Notropis rubellus= (Agassiz), rosyface shiner. Station 5-G.    One rosyface shiner (KU 4195) was taken. This species was previously  reported from only two localities in the Kansas River Basin: in the  Mill Creek Watershed, Wabaunsee County, and Blacksmith Creek,  Shawnee County as _Notropis rubrifrons_ (Cope) (Gilbert, 1886:208).  Mill Creek and Blacksmith Creek are northward-flowing tributaries of  the Kansas River that arise in the Flint Hills. Graham (1885:73)  also recorded _N. rubellus_ (as _N. rubrifrons_) from the \"Kansas  and Missouri Rivers\"; however, I suspect that his specimens were  _Notropis percobromus_, a species not generally recognized in  Graham's time (see Hubbs, 1945:16-17). _Notropis rubellus_ is now  abundant in the Mill Creek Watershed (Wabaunsee County), but, except  for my specimen No. 4195, has not been taken recently in other  streams in the Kansas River Basin.    =Notropis umbratilis umbratilis= (Girard), redfin shiner. Station  3-S.    One specimen of _N. u. umbratilis_ was captured near a sandbar on  March 26, 1958. The absence of this species in Flint Hills streams  of the Big Blue River Basin is unexplained; redfin shiners occur  commonly in southern tributaries of the Kansas River both upstream  and downstream from the mouth of the Big Blue River. In Kansas this  species is usually associated with the larger pools of clear, upland  streams.    Canfield and Wiebe (1931:6-8) may have referred to this species in  recording \"black-fin minnows\" from the Nebraskan portion of the Big  Blue River Basin.    =Notropis cornutus frontalis= (Agassiz), common shiner. Stations  4-S, 5-G, 7-G, 10-G, 11-G, 12-G, 13-G, 18-G, 22-G, 26-G, 27-G, 28-G,  29-G, 31-G, 32-G, and 59-G.    Common shiners were most abundant in middle sections of the clear,  gravelly creeks.    =Notropis lutrensis= (Baird and Girard), red shiner: Meek  (1895:136); and Evermann and Cox (1896:404-405). All stations  excepting 1-S, 17-G, 30-M, and 51-M.    Red shiners were the most widespread species taken in my survey,  occurring in all habitats, and in all kinds of streams. On two  occasions I observed what apparently was spawning behavior of this  species. Both times the specimens collected were in the height of  breeding condition, stripping in the hand easily, and often without  pressure. At the first locality (Station 29-G) no attempt was made  to obtain eggs, but by disturbing the bottom at the second (55-M) I  found eggs that were thought to be those of red shiners. The eggs  were slightly adhesive, clinging to the hand and to the bobbinet  seine.    On June 29, 1958, at Station 29-G, red shiners appeared to be  spawning in an open-water area measuring about 15 by 15 feet, over  nests of _Lepomis cyanellus_ Rafinesque and _L. humilis_ (Girard).  No interspecific activity was noted between the sunfish and the red  shiners. Water temperature at this station was 73.4 deg.F., and the  bottom was gravel, sand, and mud. Observations were made from a high  cut-bank, by naked eye and by use of 7-X binoculars.    The red shiners moved rapidly at the surface of the water, with one  male (rarely two or more) following one female. The male followed  closely, passing the female and causing her to change direction. At  the moment of the female's hesitation, prior to her turn, the male  would erect his fins in display, at the side and a little in front  of the female. After brief display, usually less than two seconds,  the male resumed the chase, swimming behind and around the female in  a spiral fashion. After a chase of two to three feet, the female  would sometimes allow the male to approach closely on her left side.  The male nudged the female on the caudal peduncle and in the anal  region, moving alongside with his head near the lower edge of the  left operculum of the female, thus placing his genital pore about a  head-length behind and below that of the female. At this time  spawning must have occurred; however, possibly because of the speed  of the chase, I observed no vibration of the fish as described for  other species of _Notropis_ at the culmination of spawning  (Pfeiffer, 1955:98; Raney, 1947:106; and others). While the spawning  act presumably occurred the pair was in forward motion in a straight  course, for three to five feet, at the end of which the male moved  rapidly away, gyrating to the side and down. The female then swam  away at a slower rate. In instances when the female failed to allow  the male to move alongside, the male sometimes increased his speed,  striking the female, and often causing her to jump from the water.    Some conflict between males was observed, usually when two or more  followed one female. The males would leave the female, swerve to one  side, and stop, facing each other or side by side. At this moment  the fins were greatly elevated in display. There was usually a rush  on the part of one male, resulting in the flight of the other, and  the aggressive male would pursue for about two feet. Many times the  pursued male jumped from the water.    At Station 55-M, on July 9, 1958,"]]]
