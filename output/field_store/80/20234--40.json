Every day she was quite as eager as Guiseppe to set forth, although  they were in search of different things--Pappina coveting the smiles  and applause of the lords and ladies who seemed to her like beings  from another world, Guiseppe eager for gold.    Every morning they would start out for some new quarter of the city  which was visited by tourists and held mysteries for Pappina. It meant  money to have these foreigners admire the child. Every one stopped  to listen to her. She was kept singing, dancing, here, there, and  everywhere, it seemed to her. Many times she was willful, and would  stubbornly refuse to obey Guiseppe.    [Illustration: A wine cart of Naples]    \"I'm tired of singing and dancing and being stared at,\" she would say,  with a determined look on her little face that warned the man not to  force her. \"I've earned enough for to-day.\"    The child would always assert her independence when among people, and  at a time quite impossible for Guiseppe to discipline her.    It is well that these two high-tempered people had Marta always with  them. Often she was able to keep the peace when an outbreak threatened.  Pappina loved her, and would listen to and obey her when no threats  from Guiseppe could move her.    As the first Sunday in June drew near, preparations were begun for the  Festival of the Constitution, the Italian Fourth of July; and to the  nearness of this fete day Marta was indebted for many an opportunity to  make the child forget Guiseppe when he showed an ugly temper.    Stores were draped with bunting. On all the principal streets arches  were erected, and every man, woman, and child seemed to be preparing  for it. Even Guiseppe made ready for the fete. Late one forenoon he  took a sudden turn into the Corso Garibaldi and hurried down its broad  walk at such a pace that even Pappina was almost breathless in trying  to keep up with him.    \"Where are you going now, Guiseppe?\" she asked, seizing hold of him.  \"Is there a crowd some place, that you hurry so?\"    Marta listened eagerly for a reply. It was a never-ending source of  astonishment to her that Guiseppe would answer the child's questions  without impatience; she, herself, rarely received a pleasant word from  him.    \"You see, _bambina_,\" the heavy-browed man graciously replied with a  good-natured twinkle in his bright black eyes, \"you are so fine since  you have your red dress, old Guiseppe thinks he must get a new coat,  and so we're on our way to Porta Nolana.\"    \"But Marta bought my new dress over there in the shops, where there is  everything in the world,\" exclaimed Pappina, waving her little hand  over her shoulder.    \"Ah, but I don't buy, I trade, little one. It's Rag Fair day.\"    \"Rag Fair day,\" Pappina repeated, wrinkling her forehead. There were  so many things to wonder about these days that she did not question  him further, but trotted along by his side, until suddenly she found  herself among a throng of chattering, bartering men and women, who were  offering all kinds of garments for sale or exchange.    Guiseppe stopped and, handing the Punchinellos to Marta, stripped  off his coat. Pappina stood with wide-open eyes and lips parted  in amazement to see him offer his coat for a better one, with one  franc--two--three--then five--and the exchange was made.    When at last Guiseppe donned his good coat, Pappina told him over and  over again, to his amusement: \"Guiseppe, you look just lovely.\"    \"You like my coat, _bambina_?\" he said. \"Then come along. It takes  money to buy good coats and bright red dresses.\"    Taking Pappina's hand, he strolled buoyantly away from the noisy  Rag Fair, toward the Observatory, beyond which some of the wealthy  Neapolitans have their homes.    Up the hilly streets they climbed. Pappina, darting ahead on  explorations, would stop at each corner as she came to it and wait for  Guiseppe and Marta.    \"Keep your eyes open for a likely house where they will pay for  entertainment,\" urged Guiseppe, who was as much a stranger in this new  quest for money as was Marta.    At the two or three places at which they stopped the voice of the  little girl rose through the heated afternoon air, but only a few  _soldi_ tinkled on the pavement.    If Guiseppe was disappointed he did not show any signs of it. He smiled  calmly upon Pappina.    \"We'll save your voice and strength for to-morrow, _bambina_. Not  another song to-day. Come along, Marta. Old Guiseppe's getting to be a  kind master, eh, Pappina?\"    His was a selfish kindness. He knew the morrow's fete would prove a  harvest to him, and since no one gave to-day, he thought best to let  Pappina rest for the fete day's strain.    When the bright, beautiful fete morning dawned, Guiseppe was early  astir.    \"Come, Marta! Up, little one!\" he exclaimed. \"The day can neither begin  too soon nor last too long for me.\"    \"Nor for me,\" declared Pappina.    First they, with every one else, must go to mass in the handsome church  San Francesco di Paola.    The thunder of guns from the vessels of war and the harbor batteries  frightened Pappina. She held Marta's hand tightly and sometimes in her  fear even Guiseppe's, but when she saw the militia she forgot the noise.    \"Oh, I like the soldiers,\" she cried happily. It was the first military  parade she had ever seen, and she wanted to follow the marching troops  down the street and lend her cheers to those of the crowd.    How grand the carriages were! How gay the people looked, tricked out  in all the magnificence they could command! Pappina, looking at the  surging mass of holiday-makers, asked: \"Marta, is the whole world here  to-day?\"    Days before the fete Pappina had been taught to sing the Garibaldi.  Guiseppe knew well the effect the song would have upon the people. For  years he had sung it himself on fete day, but that was before he had  his Punchinellos, before his voice had grown thin and cracked. Time and  again he had scolded Marta because neither she nor the puppets could  sing the Garibaldi.    Now he had a child with voice and beauty. As they paused at a crowded  corner where he thought it would be well to have her sing, he looked  at her with satisfaction. He had talked to her so much of the applause  and _soldi_ she would win that she could scarcely curb her impatience  to begin. Like a high-bred, prancing horse eager to run, she stood with  her gayly decorated tambourine ready, anxiously waiting for Guiseppe to  bid her sing. When he said, \"_Canta_,\" she needed no second bidding.  Wildly she struck her tambourine. Her voice rang out:    \"_Viva! Viva! Viva!_ Garibaldi!\"    Such a din of applause! She could scarcely hear her own voice, but  loudly she continued: \"_Viva! Viva!_ Victor Emanuel!\"    She need not pass her tambourine to-day. She need not even stop to pick  up the _soldi_ as they rained upon her. That was Marta and Guiseppe's  pleasant task.    \"Bravo! Bravo! Encore! Encore!\" the crowd shouted, and Pappina sang the  song over and over again.    As one throng left for new sights and amusements another took its  place, and so the tambourine was filled again and again. Yet Guiseppe  kept her singing and dancing, dancing and singing. Never, it seemed to  Marta, would he be satisfied to let the child rest.    The woman noticed with anxiety and pain the bright, feverish spots  burning on Pappina's cheeks, and the unusual brilliancy of her great  black eyes. Several times she made bold to ask Guiseppe if she might  not take the child home, but Guiseppe replied only with glances of  contempt and indignation at her interference.    Even the buoyancy of youth must give way to fatigue after a time, and  Pappina's little limbs began to ache. She sat down to rest.    \"Get up, girl. We must be moving,\" said Guiseppe.    Pappina arose.    \"Take me home, Guiseppe,\" she begged, \"I'm so tired.\" The request was  ignored.    \"There's a crowd up the street; come,\" was all the man said.    Pappina's bright eyes spied an empty carriage on the thoroughfare. All  her little life since she could remember, she had longed for a ride in  a carriage; here was her first chance for one and she grasped it.    \"I'm too tired to walk, Guiseppe,\" she said quietly. \"I'm going home  now, and I'm going to ride, for I've earned lots of money to-day.\"    Guiseppe took no notice of the remark.    \"Come on, I say!\" he growled. \"Don't you see that crowd? Come!\"    \"Guiseppe, I'm going home, and I'm going to ride, for I've earned lots  of money to-day.\" Pappina repeated, stepping, as she spoke, into the  carriage.    What was Guiseppe to do? They were still among a crowd of people who  had poured _soldi_ and _soldi_, even francs, into her tambourine.  Should he attempt to discipline her and have a scene on this public,  crowded thoroughfare? He looked savagely at Pappina seated in the  carriage, her proud little head resting against the cushions like that  of a princess. He could not doubt that she intended to ride. Should he  humor her? He stood a moment in deep study. The people were smiling  admiringly at the dainty child. Guiseppe knew their sympathy was with  Pappina. He could not hide his anger.    \"Confound her!\" he muttered. \"Get in, Marta,\" he commanded with an oath.    There is no knowing what, in his rage, Guiseppe would not have said  and done had not Pappina fallen asleep almost immediately. It was poor  Marta who was destined to feel the fury of his rage.    \"She always takes advantage of me when I can't help myself,\" he began.  \"The upstart! Am I, Guiseppe, to give in to her, an imp raised in  poverty and dirt?\" He beat his hand on his breast. \"Marta, I'll show  her. I'll teach her who is master. I'll curb her temper. I'll conquer  her or I'll die. Bah! Do you hear me? I say I'll conquer her or I'll  die.\"    Marta certainly heard him and believed him as well."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45573"],[0,"Out with Garibaldi: A story of the liberation of Italy (#5)"],[1,"rushed forward, opening out as they ran to something like  order. When within ten yards of the French bayonets every man delivered  his fire, and then hurled himself upon the broken ranks. The struggle  was a short one. The weight and impetuosity of the attack, supported as  it was by a surging crowd of excited citizens, was irresistible, and the  regiment broke and fled hastily to the shelter of the troops following  it, leaving the ground strewn with dead and wounded. Then the bugles at  the gate rang out the order to the exulting crowd to retire. The  officers threw themselves in front of the men, and with great difficulty  checked the pursuit, and caused them to withdraw to their original  position behind the wall.          CHAPTER II.    A DESPERATE DEFENCE.      After a short halt the French, having re-formed, changed their course  and marched along parallel to the fortifications. Captain Percival had,  on returning from the sortie, joined the officer on the wall, and  watched alternately the movements of the French and the scene in the  city. This was one of wild excitement--the men cheering and shouting,  shaking each other by the hand, placing their hats on their bayonets,  and waving them in answer to the wild applause of the women on the  housetops. Some, however, were not content at being called back, instead  of being allowed to complete what they considered their partial victory;  forgetting that they would have been met in a very different manner by  the troops in support, who would have been prepared for the attack and  would have reserved their fire until the last moment. As soon as it  became evident that the French intended to make their next move against  the gate of San Pancrazio, the greater portion of the volunteers marched  in that direction, Captain Percival accompanying them.    \"You have done well so far,\" Garibaldi said, as he joined them. \"Now it  will be our turn, and we shall have tougher work than you had, for they  will be prepared. I suppose your loss was not heavy?\"    \"Very trifling indeed; there were but three dead brought in, and there  were some ten or twelve wounded.\"    \"It was just the sort of action to raise the spirits of the men, and  they are all in the humour for fighting. I shall therefore lead them out  here. But we cannot hope to succeed with a rush as you did--they will be  prepared for us this time; the best men would be killed before we  reached them, and the mass behind, but few of whom have guns, would be  simply massacred.\"    The volunteers, who had undergone a rough sort of drill, were assembled  before the French had concluded their preparations for an assault.  Garibaldi appointed Captain Percival to take charge of the gate, having  with him two hundred of the volunteers, behind whom were the armed  citizens. These clamoured to go out as before; but Garibaldi raised his  hand for silence, and then told them that he would not lead them to a  useless massacre against an army of well-armed soldiers.    \"Your duty,\" he said, \"is to remain here. If we have to fall back, you  will open to let us pass. We shall be ready to do our share when  necessary; but the defence of the gate will be for a while entrusted to  you. If the enemy force an entrance, fall upon them as you would upon  wild beasts; their discipline and their arms would be of no great  advantage in a hand-to-hand fight. Each man must fight as he would were  he protecting his family from a band of wolves--hatchet and pike must  meet musket and bayonet, those who have knives must dive among the  throng and use them fearlessly. It is a great charge that we entrust to  you: we go out to fight; you will guard the city and all you hold dear.\"    A loud cheer showed that he had struck the right chord, and the mob drew  back as he led out some five thousand volunteers. These advanced to  within musket-shot of the enemy, and then scattering, took shelter  behind houses and cottages, walls and ruins. The French cannon opened  fire as the movement was going on. These were answered by the guns on  the walls, and as the French advanced a murderous fire was opened by  their hidden foes. The battle raged for several hours. Sometimes the  French advanced close up to the position held by the Garibaldians, but  as soon as they did so, they were exposed also to the fire from the men  on the walls; and in spite of Captain Percival's efforts, groups of men  made their way down the road and joined the firing line, lying down  until the moment should come when they could spring like wild cats upon  the French.    Once or twice, when the assailants pressed back the Garibaldians in  spite of their efforts, they found themselves presently opposed by a  crowd that seemed to leap from the ground, and who, with wild shouts,  rushed upon them so furiously that they recoiled almost panic-struck  before so unaccustomed an enemy. Men were pulled down, and as Garibaldi  had given strict orders that no French soldier should be killed except  when fighting, these were carried back triumphantly into the city. At  last General Oudinot, seeing that his troops were making no progress,  and that, even if they could force their way into the city, they would  suffer terribly in street-fighting with such assailants, gave the order  for his men to retire. This they did sullenly, while a roar of  triumphant shouting rose from the volunteers, the men on the walls, and  the crowd that covered every house and vantage-ground, from which a view  of what was passing outside could be obtained.    The Italian loss was only about a hundred men killed and wounded,  whereas the French lost three hundred killed and wounded and five  hundred prisoners. So unprepared was the French general for such a  resistance, that he had to undergo the humiliation of sending in to  Garibaldi to ask him to supply him with surgeons to dress the wounds of  the French soldiers. During the fighting the French artillery had done  far more injury to works of art in Rome than they had inflicted upon the  defenders, as the artillery played principally upon the dome of St.  Peter's and the Vatican, both of which buildings were much damaged.    The joy caused in Rome by this victory was prodigious. Fires blazed that  night on all the hills, every house was illuminated, the people thronged  the streets, shouting and cheering. They had, indeed, much to be proud  of: five thousand almost undrilled volunteers had defeated seven  thousand of the best troops of France.    [Illustration: \"WALKING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LIKE A CAGED LION\"]    The French retired at once to Palo, on the road to Civita Vecchia.  Garibaldi gave his troops a few hours' rest, and then moved out to  attack the French, and took up a most advantageous position. His troops  were flushed with victory, while the French were cowed and dispirited;  and he was on the point of attacking, when General Oudinot sent a  messenger to treat for an armistice, and as a proof of his sincerity  offered to give up Ugo Bassi, a priest who had remained by the side of a  wounded man when the Garibaldians had for a moment retired. Garibaldi  would peremptorily have refused the request, for he was confident that  he should defeat and capture the whole of the French. Mazzini, however,  with his two associates in the triumvirate, still clung to the hope that  the French would aid them, and determined to accept the armistice,  fearing that were the whole French army destroyed, the national feeling  would be so embittered that there would no longer be any hope  whatever of an alliance. Garibaldi protested, declaring that the  armistice would but enable the French reinforcements to arrive. Mazzini,  however, persisted in the decision, and actually released the five  hundred prisoners in exchange for the priest.    The folly of this violent democrat sealed the fate of Rome. Had  Garibaldi been permitted to carry out his plans, the French army would  have been destroyed or made prisoners to a man, and the enthusiasm that  such a glorious victory would have excited throughout all Italy would  have aroused the whole population to burst their bonds. Furious at this  act of folly, Garibaldi and his troops re-entered Rome. He was greeted  with enthusiasm by the people, but disliking such ovations, he slipped  away with Captain Percival to the latter's house. Professor Forli had  taken no part in the fighting outside the walls, but stationing himself  with the troops that manned them, had kept up a vigorous fire whenever  the enemy were within gunshot. After the repulse of the second attack he  had returned home.    \"The stupidity of these people is incredible,\" Garibaldi, who had  scarcely spoken a word since he had turned back towards Rome, burst out,  waving aside the chair that the professor offered him, and walking up  and down the room like a caged lion. \"We held the French in the palms of  our hands, and they have allowed them to escape. A fortnight, and we  shall have three times their number to face, and you know what the  result will be. I regard the cause as lost, thrown away by Mazzini--a  man who has never taken part in a battle, who kept himself shut up in  the capital when the fighting was going on, a man of the tongue and not  of action. It is too disgusting. I am a republican; but if a republic  is to be in the hands of men like these, they will drive me to become a  monarchist again. Carlo Alberto was weak, but he was at least a man; he  staked his throne for the cause, and when it was lost, retired. Mazzini  stakes nothing, for he has a safe-conduct; if he loses, he will set to  to intrigue again, careless who may fall or what may come to Italy, if  his own wild ideas cannot prevail; he desires a republic, but it is a  republic that he himself shall manipulate. Well, if it must be, it must.  I am no statesman, but simply a fighting man. I shall fight till the  last; and the failure must rest upon the head of him who"]]]
