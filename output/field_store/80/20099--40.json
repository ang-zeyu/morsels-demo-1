Such being the case, he thinks it just, at once to himself and others, to  indicate here the only points on which he can himself lay any claim to  originality. These are as follows:--    The more complete establishment of the truth that, in relation to man and  woman in particular, beauty is the external sign of goodness in  organization and function, and thence its importance.--Chapter I., and the  work generally.    The showing that the discussion of this subject, though involving the  examination of the naked figure, is urgent in relation to decency (the  theory of which is discussed), morality, and happy intermarriage.--Chapter  II.    The showing that the ancient religion was the cause of the perfection of  the fine arts in Greece, by its personification of simple attributes or  virtues, as objects of adoration.--Chapter II.    The exposition of the nature, the kinds, and the characteristics of  beauty; and of some errors of Burke, Knight, &c., on this  subject.--Chapter IV.    The showing that there are elements of beauty invariable in their nature  and effect, and that these are modified and complicated in advancing from  simple to complex beings, and the arts relating to them.--Chapter VI.    The pointing out these elements of beauty, and their mode of operation in  inanimate beings; and the errors of Knight and Allison on this  subject.--Sect. I., Chapter VI.    The pointing out these elements, and others which are superadded, in  living beings; and the errors of Allison on this subject.--Sect. II.,  Chapter VI.    The pointing out these elements, and others which are farther superadded,  in thinking beings; and the errors of Burke and Knight on this  subject.--Sect. III., Chapter VI.    The exposition of these elements, as differing, or variously modified, in  the useful, ornamental, and intellectual arts, respectively; and some  remarks on ornament in architecture, and in female dress.--Sect. IV.,  Chapter VI.    The explanation of the nature of the picturesque, after the failure of  Knight and Price in this respect.--Sect. I., Appendix to preceding  chapters.    The vindication of the doctrine of Hobbes, as to the cause of laughter;  and exposition of the errors of Campbell and Beattie on this  subject.--Sect. II., Appendix.    The explanation of the cause of the pleasure received from representations  exciting pity; and of the errors of Burke, &c., on that subject.--Sect.  III., Appendix.    The arrangement of anatomy and physiology, and the application of the  principles of these sciences to the distinguishing and judging of  beauty.--Chapter VII.    The explanation of the difference in the beauty of the two sexes even in  the same country.--Chapter IX.    Various arguments establishing the standard of beauty in woman; and  exposure of the sophistry of Knight, on this subject.--Chapter X.    The showing, by the preceding arrangements, that the ancient temperaments  are partial or complex views of anthropological phenomena.--Chapter XI.,  et seq.    The description of the first species of beauty, or that of the locomotive  system, and of its varieties, as founded on examination of  structure.--Chapter XII.    The description of the second species of beauty, or that of the nutritive  system, and of its varieties, as founded on examination of  structure.--Chapter XIII.

The explanation of the cause of the different effects of the same face,  even in a state of repose.--Ibid.    The indication of the faulty feature, and its gradual increase, even in  beautiful faces.--Ibid.    The exposition of the different organization of Greek and Roman  heads.--Ibid.    The explanation of the combinations and transitions of beauty.--Chapter  XVI.    The explanation of the numerical, geometrical, and harmonic methods of  proportion, employed by the ancient Greeks.--Chapter XVII.    Some remarks on character, expression, and detail in art.--Ibid.    Some observations on the Greek forehead, actual as well as ideal.--Chapter  XVIII.    The explanation of the reason of the Greek ideal rule, as to the  proportion between the forehead and the other parts of the face.--Ibid.

The explanation of the reason why the Greeks suppressed all great degrees  of impassioned expression.--Ibid.    The mere indication of the Greek idealizations as applied to the nutritive  and locomotive systems, and the explanation of the latter in the  Apollo.--Ibid.    The replies to the objections of Burke and Alison, as to ideal  beauty.--Ibid.    The enunciation of the ideal in attitude.--Ibid.    Various views as to the Venus de Medici, the conformation of the nose, and  the connexion of odor with love, in animals and plants.--Chapter XIX.    Some remarks on the Venus de Medici.--Ibid.    The pointing out and explanation of various defects in beauty.--Chapter  XX.    The pointing out and explanation of various external indications of  figure, beauty, mind, habits, and age.--Chapter XXI.    The writer may possibly be mistaken as to the originality of one or two of  these points; but, leaving the critical reader to deduct as many of these  as it is in his power to do, enough of novelty would remain for the  writer's ambition, in this respect, if he had done no more than exposed  the errors of Burke, Knight, Alison, &c., and established the true  doctrine of beauty, in the first chapters--given an analysis and  classification of beauty in woman, in the chapters which follow--and  applied this to the fine arts, and solved the difficulty of Leonardo da  Vinci, &c., in the last chapters.          ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION OF BEAUTY IN WOMAN.          CHAPTER I.    IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT.      It is observed by Home, in his \"Elements of Criticism,\" that a perception  of beauty in external objects is requisite to attach us to them; that it  greatly promotes industry, by promoting a desire to possess things that  are beautiful; and that it farther joins with utility, in prompting us to  embellish our houses and enrich our fields. \"These, however,\" he says,  \"are but slight effects, compared with the connexions which are formed  among individuals in society by means of this singular mechanism: the  qualifications of the head and heart are undoubtedly the most solid and  most permanent foundations of such connexions; but as external beauty lies  more in view, and is more obvious to the bulk of mankind, than the  qualities now mentioned, the sense of beauty possesses the more universal  influence in forming these connexions; at any rate, it concurs in an  eminent degree, with mental qualifications, to produce social  intercourse, mutual good-will, and, consequently, mutual aid and support,  which are the life of society.\"    Dr. Pritchard similarly observes, that \"the perception of beauty is the  chief principle in every country which directs men in their marriages.\"    Advancing a step farther, Sir Anthony Carlisle thinks a taste for beauty  worthy of being cultivated. \"Man,\" he observes, \"dwells with felicity even  on ideal female attributes, and in imagination discovers beauties and  perfections which solace his wearied hours, far beyond any other resource  within the scope of human life. It cannot, then, be unwise to cultivate  and refine this natural tendency, and to enhance, if possible, these  charms of life. We increase and heighten all our pleasures by awakening  and cultivating reflections which do not exist in a state of ignorance.  Thus, the botanist perceives elegances in plants and flowers unknown and  unfelt by the vulgar, and the landscape-painter revels in natural or  imaginary scenery, with feelings which are unknown to the multitude. It  would be absurd to pretend that the more exquisite and more deeply  attractive beauty of woman is not worthy of more profound, as well as more  universal cultivation.\"    Such are the observations of philosophical anthropologists, who,  nevertheless, in these remarks, consider mere physical beauty independent  of its connexion with corresponding functions or moral qualities.    If, however, the external beauty of woman, calculated as it is to flatter  the most experienced eye, limited its effect to a local impression, to an  optical enjoyment, the sentiment of beauty would be far from having all  its extent and value. Happily, ideas of goodness, of suitableness, of  sympathy, of progressive perfection, and of mutual happiness, are, by an  intimate and inevitable association, connected with the first impression  made by the sight of beauty.    The foundation of this feeling is well expressed by Dr. Pritchard, in his  observation that \"the idea of beauty of person is synonymous with that of  health and perfect organization.\"    Hence, it has been observed, the great ideal models of beauty please us,  not merely because their forms are disposed and combined so as to affect  agreeably the organ of sight, but because their exterior appears to  correspond to admirable qualities, and to announce an elevation in the  condition of humanity.

Hist., 13:351, April 27, 1961.      _Diagnosis._--Dorsum tan to reddish brown; venter white; rarely  flecked with brown or black; a white stripe on upper lip, on flank,  and usually above anus.    _Description._--The following description is based on KU 58008 from  Finca La Paz, Depto. San Marcos, Guatemala (Pl. 12). Adult male having  a snout-vent length of 35.0 mm.; tibia length, 16.5 mm.; tibia  length/snout-vent length, 47.1 per cent; foot length, 14.2 mm.; head  length, 11.0 mm.; head length/snout-vent length, 31.4 per cent; head  width, 10.7 mm.; head width/snout-vent length, 30.6 per cent; diameter  of eye, 3.3 mm.; diameter of tympanum, 1.8 mm.; tympanum/eye, 54.5 per  cent. Snout in lateral profile nearly square, slightly rounded above,  and in dorsal profile bluntly rounded; canthus pronounced; loreal  region moderately concave; lips thick, rounded, and slightly flaring;  nostrils protuberant; internarial distance, 3.0 mm.; top of head flat;  interorbital distance, 4.1 mm., and approximately a third broader than  width of eyelid, 2.9 mm. Moderately heavy dermal fold from posterior  corner of eye above tympanum to point above insertion of forelimb,  covering upper edge of tympanum; tympanum round, its diameter slightly  more than its distance from eye. Forearm moderately robust, having  distinct dermal fold on wrist; dermal fold, but no row of tubercles  along ventrolateral surface of forearm; pollex only slightly enlarged,  bearing triangular shaped patch of small horn-covered spines (128 on  right, 134 on left); second and fourth fingers equal in length;  subarticular tubercles round, distal one on fourth finger bifid; discs  moderate in size, that of third finger equal to diameter of tympanum;  no web between first and second fingers; other fingers one-third  webbed. Heels broadly overlap when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal  articulation reaches to middle of eye; low rounded tarsal fold; inner  metatarsal tubercle large, elliptical, and flat; outer metatarsal  tubercle small and round; low dermal fold from heel to disc of fifth  toe; subarticular tubercles round; length of digits from shortest to  longest 1-2-5-3-4; third and fifth toes webbed to base of disc; fourth  toe webbed to proximal end of penultimate phalanx; thin dermal fold  from inner metatarsal tubercle to disc of first toe; disc smaller than  on fingers. Anal opening at the level of the upper edge of thighs;  anal flap short; anal opening bordered above by thin transverse dermal  fold and laterally by heavy dermal fold. Skin of dorsum and ventral  surfaces of forelimbs and shanks smooth; that of throat, belly, and  ventral surfaces of thighs granular. Ventrolateral glands moderately  developed, not reaching axilla or groin and broadly separated  midventrally. Tongue ovoid, emarginate, and only slightly free  posteriorly; vomerine teeth 2-2, situated on small triangular  elevations between ovoid inner nares; openings to vocal sac large, one  situated along inner posterior edge of each mandibular ramus.    Dorsal ground-color of head, body, and limbs dull reddish brown with  irregular dark brown reticulations on head and body and dark brown  transverse bands on limbs; dorsal surfaces of first and second fingers  and webbing on hand cream color; dorsal surfaces of third and fourth  fingers dull brown; anterior surfaces of thighs dull creamy yellow;  posterior surfaces of thighs dull brown; tarsi and toes tan with brown  flecks; webbing of feet brown; faint creamy white stripe along lateral  edges of tarsi and forearms; thin white line along edge of upper lip;  distinct white stripe above and beside anal opening; axilla white;  throat, chest, belly, and ventral surfaces of forelimbs creamy white;  flanks white, separated from pale venter by a row of partly connected  dark brown spots; ventral surfaces of thighs dull creamy yellow; feet  grayish brown; ventrolateral glands pale grayish brown; small brown  flecks on periphery of chin.    In life the dorsal ground-color was pale reddish brown  (Orange-Cinnamon); dorsal reticulations dark brown (Chocolate); dorsal  surfaces of first and second fingers and webbing on hands creamy tan  (Light Pinkish Cinnamon); posterior surfaces of thighs reddish brown  (Vinaceous-Tawny); webbing of feet gray (Deep Mouse Gray); throat and  belly grayish white (Pale Gull Gray); ventral surfaces of hind limbs  creamy white (Marguerite Yellow); spots on flanks dark brown (Warm  Sepia); iris reddish bronze (Apricot Orange).    _Variation._--No geographic variation in structural characters is  discernible; variation in size and proportions is given in Table 1. Of  32 adults examined, seven have the tongue shallowly notched  posteriorly; in the others the tongue is emarginate. Twenty specimens  have a bifid subarticular tubercle beneath the fourth finger; in the  others there are no bifid tubercles.    The coloration described above is typical of the 16 specimens  available from Finca La Paz. The living coloration at night, when the  frogs were collected, was somewhat darker than the living colors  described above, which were recorded for the frogs the morning after  collection, at which time one individual had a pale reddish brown  dorsum (Orange-Cinnamon) with dull olive green (Deep Grape Green)  reticulations on the back and transverse bands on the limbs; the  dorsal surfaces of the first and second fingers and the discs on the  third and fourth fingers were orange (Mikado Orange).    More than half of the specimens from Finca La Paz agree in all  essential characters with the description given above. The  distinctness of the white stripe on the upper lip is variable; in two  individuals the stripe is barely discernible. Likewise, in some  individuals the white stripe on the flanks is not distinct, either  because there are few or no brown spots separating the stripe from the  pale venter, or because the ventrolateral gland has diffused the pale  color on the flanks. There is some noticeable variation in dorsal  coloration, either through a greater or lesser development of dark  pigment. One specimen (KU 58007) is grayish tan above with dark brown  markings; the posterior surfaces of the thighs are dull grayish  yellow; the first and second fingers and the webbing on the hands are  pale yellowish gray; the belly and throat are dusty white; the flecks  on the throat are gray; the ventral surfaces of the feet are grayish  brown. Dark individuals, such as KU 58009 have a uniform dark brownish  black dorsum; the belly is cream; the first and second fingers and the  webbing on the hands are dull creamy tan; the dorsal and ventral  surfaces of the feet are dark brown. In KU 58013 there is a heavy  suffusion of brown on the throat and flanks. Two specimens have  scattered white flecks on the dorsum.    The reddish brown dorsal ground-color with dark brown reticulations on  the head and body and dark brown transverse bands on the limbs seems  to be rather constant throughout the range of the subspecies.  Likewise, the presence of the white stripe on the upper lip and the  white stripe around the anal opening are present on most specimens. In  breeding males having well-developed ventrolateral glands the lateral  white stripe often is obliterated.    _Description of Tadpole._--The following description is based on KU  60042 from Finca La Paz, Depto. San Marcos, Guatemala (Figs. 4A and  6A). No limb buds; total length, 35.8 mm.; body length, 11.2 mm.; body  length/total length, 31.3 per cent. Body moderately depressed,  slightly wider than deep, ovoid in dorsal profile; mouth directed  ventrally; eyes small, directed dorsolaterally; nostrils slightly  protuberant and directed anteriorly, closer to eye than snout;  spiracle sinistral and posteroventrad to eye; anal tube dextral.  Caudal fin low, rounded posteriorly; depth of caudal musculature about  one-half greatest depth of caudal fin; musculature extends nearly to  tip of tail.    Mouth large; lips having deep lateral folds; two complete rows of  papillae on lips; five to six rows of papillae laterally. Beaks  moderately developed, bearing peglike serrations; slender lateral  projections on upper beak; tooth-rows 4/6; upper rows subequal in  length, second longest; fourth row interrupted medially; lower rows  complete; lower rows 1-4 equal in length to upper rows; fifth lower  row somewhat shorter; sixth lower row short.    Body brown above; tip of snout cream color; grayish cream color below;  caudal musculature creamy tan; caudal fin transparent;"]]]
