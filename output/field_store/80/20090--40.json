Approximately 500 trap nights in Mescal Wash, at 4100 feet elevation, in  the lower edge of the juniper belt, yielded the following mammals:    TABLE 8.--YIELD OF 500 TRAP-NIGHTS IN MESCAL WASH (DESERT SLOPE).    ==========================================================                                        | Number | Per cent                                        |        | of total  --------------------------------------+--------+----------  Perognathus fallax pallidus           |     5  |     4.5  Dipodomys panamintinus mohavensis     |    43  |    38.7  Peromyscus californicus insignis      |     3  |     2.7  Peromyscus truei montipinoris         |     1  |      .9  Peromyscus boylii rowleyi             |     2  |     1.8  Peromyscus eremicus eremicus          |    28  |    25.0  Peromyscus maniculatus sonoriensis    |    23  |    20.5  Onychomys torridus pulcher            |     4  |     3.5  Neotoma lepida lepida                 |     3  |     2.7  --------------------------------------+--------+----------    _Dipodomys panamintinus mohavensis_, _Neotoma fuscipes simplex_, and  _Peromyscus truei montipinoris_ are probably the most characteristic  mammals of the pinyon-juniper association.      Sagebrush Scrub Association    MAJOR PLANTS    _Bromus sp._  _Artemisia tridentata_  _Chrysothamnus nauseosus_  _Purshia glandulosa_    This association is found on only the crest and desert slope of the  range between 5000 and 8000 feet elevation. There it characteristically  occupies flats and clearings in the yellow pine forest and  pinyon-juniper woodland. The dominant plant of the association is basin  sagebrush, and in many places this plant forms mixed growths with  snowbrush and _Haplopappus_. The low brush of this association is formed  by closely spaced bushes with grasses growing between.    Because of its limited occurrence in the San Gabriel Mountains, this  association there has relatively little effect on mammalian  distribution. Locally, nevertheless, the presence of this association  governs the distribution of certain mammals. For example, on Blue Ridge,  islands of sagebrush amid the conifers provide suitable habitat for  _Dipodomys agilis perplexus_ and _Perognathus californicus bernardinus_;  and in Swarthout Valley _D. a. perplexus_, _Reithrodontomys megalotis  longicaudus_, and _Lepus californicus deserticola_ are seemingly  restricted to the sagebrush flats.      Joshua Tree Woodland Association    MAJOR PLANTS    _Yucca brevifolia_  _Lycium Andersonii_  _Eriogonum fasciculatum_  _Tetradymia spinosa_  _Ephedra sp._  _Larrea divaricata_    This association is on the piedmont that dips toward the Mojave Desert  from the interior base of the San Gabriels. The widely spaced Joshua  trees with low bushes between, and the dry washes breaking the level  terrain below the mouths of canyons are typical of this area. Field work  was extended no farther down into the desert than about the 3500 foot  level, where this association was still dominant.    Although the vegetation of this area is scattered and sparse, presenting  a barren and sterile aspect, the area supports a rather high population  of rodents. The soil at the bases of many large box-thorn- and  creosote-bushes is perforated by burrow systems of _Dipodomys  panamintinus_ or _Dipodomys merriami_, and those burrows abandoned by  kangaroo rats are used as retreats by _Onychomys torridus_ and  _Peromyscus maniculatus_. The mammals of this association are all  characteristic of the fauna of the Mojave Desert, with the ranges of  such species as the coyote and jack rabbit extending well up the desert  slope of the mountains.    The mammals listed below were taken in 1948 in roughly 400 trap nights  in the Joshua belt, at an elevation of 3500 feet, one mile below the  mouth of Graham Canyon.    TABLE 9.--YIELD OF 400 TRAP-NIGHTS IN THE JOSHUA TREE BELT.    ======================================================                                     | Number | Per cent                                     |        | of total  -----------------------------------+--------+---------  Dipodomys panamintinus mohavensis  |    36  |   59.0  Dipodomys merriami merriami        |    15  |   24.6  Onychomys torridus pulcher         |     4  |    6.6  Peromyscus maniculatus gambeli     |     6  |    9.8  -----------------------------------+--------+---------    Populations of _Dipodomys merriami_ and _D. panamintinus_ fluctuate  widely, possibly in response to weather cycles. In November of 1948  trapping in the Joshua belt showed that _panamintinus_ outnumbered  _merriami_ approximately three to one, whereas in December of 1951,  after a succession of unusually dry years, _merriami_ was the more  numerous. Further, _merriami_ occurred in the lower parts of the juniper  belt in 1951 where in 1948 it seemed to be absent.    _Dipodomys merriami merriami_ and _Onychomys torridus pulcher_ are  diagnostic of the Joshua tree woodland association in the San Gabriel  Mountains area, since few individuals of either species occur outside of  this association.          ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES      Family DIDELPHIDAE      =Didelphis marsupialis virginiana= Kerr    Virginia Opossum    The opossum is common in and near small towns and cultivated areas at  the Pacific base of the mountain range and does not thrive away from  human habitation; extensive trapping in the coastal sage and chaparral  belts produced no specimens except immediately adjacent to citrus  groves. Pequegnat (1951:47) mentions that opossums in the Santa Ana  Mountains of southern California are in the lower parts of the larger  canyons, especially near human habitation.        _Specimens examined._--Los Angeles County: Claremont, 1600 ft.,      2 (PC).      Family TALPIDAE      =Scapanus latimanus occultus= Grinnell and Swarth    California Mole    Workings of moles were found on the Pacific slope of the mountains from  1600 feet at Claremont up to 7500 feet on Blue Ridge, and on the Pacific  slope beneath basin sagebrush in Cajon Canyon one mile from desert slope  Joshua-tree flats, but not on the desert slope, although moles probably  occur on that slope in some of the places where there is suitable  habitat.    Near Camp Baldy in the sandy soil beneath groves of alders moles seemed  to be especially abundant. Although common on the coastal face of the  range, moles shunned compact, dry, or rocky soils. In the greasewood  chaparral one-half mile west of the mouth of Palmer Canyon, where the  soil was hard and rocky, mole tunnels were in soft soil that had  accumulated at the edge of a fire road beneath a steep road cut. The  assumption is that this accumulation contained insects attractive, as  food, to the moles.        _Specimens examined_, 2: Los Angeles County: Camp Baldy, 4200      ft., 1(PC); Claremont, 1600 ft., 1(PC).      Family SORICIDAE      =Sorex obscurus parvidens= Jackson    Dusky Shrew    Jackson (1928:124) recorded a specimen from Camp Baldy, 4200 feet, San  Antonio Canyon.      =Sorex ornatus ornatus= Merriam    Ornate Shrew    Both of my specimens were taken amid riparian growth on the Pacific  slope of the range.        _Specimens examined_, 2: Los Angeles County: San Antonio Canyon,      3500 ft., 1; Cobal Canyon, 5 mi. N Claremont, 1800 ft., 1 (PC).      =Notiosorex crawfordi crawfordi= (Coues)    Gray Shrew    One was taken in 1946 beneath a woodpile on the campus of Norton School,  two miles northeast of Claremont, and examined by Dr. W. E. Pequegnat.      Family VESPERTILIONIDAE      =Myotis yumanensis sociabilis= H. W. Grinnell    Yuma Myotis    A female was taken in lower San Antonio Canyon, 2800 feet elevation, on  September 27, 1951.      =Myotis evotis evotis= (J. A. Allen)    Long-eared Myotis    This species was observed and collected at several stations ranging from  2800 feet elevation in San Antonio Canyon, to Blue Ridge at 8200 feet,  and down the desert slope to 6000 feet at Jackson Lake. This  distribution encompasses most of the chaparral and yellow pine forest  associations. Within these areas, however, this bat shows marked habitat  preferences.    Woodland habitats seem to be preferred by _evotis_. At several ponds in  lower San Antonio Canyon this bat was observed repeatedly as it foraged  over the water and coursed low between rows of alders and _Baccharis_.  At Blue Ridge in September, 1951, these bats foraged approximately six  feet above the ground beneath the canopy of coniferous foliage and  between the trunks of the trees.    Most of the bats were taken by stretching fine wires above the surface  of a pond as outlined by Borell (1937:478). Collecting was generally  carried on until at least 11:00 p. m., and the time at which each bat  was taken at the pond was recorded, thereby making possible a rough  estimate of the pre-midnight forage period of each bat commonly  collected at the ponds. Usually bats taken at the start of their  supposed forage period had empty or nearly empty stomachs, whereas those  taken towards the end of their forage period had full or nearly full  stomachs. _M. evotis_ usually first appeared just at dark, well after  the pipistrelles and California myotis had begun foraging. The forage  period of _evotis_ seemed to begin approximately 30 minutes after sunset  and to end approximately two and one-quarter hours later.    Individuals of this species were taken from May 4, to October 14, 1951.  A female taken on May 19, 1951, in San Antonio Canyon, carried one  minute embryo, and one taken in the same locality on June 8, had one  embryo four millimeters in length.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 12, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: San Antonio Canyon, 2800 ft., 11; Claremont,      1100 ft., 1 (P.C.).      =Myotis volans interior= Miller    Interior Long-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34853"],[0,"The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries (#5)"],[1,"enough  to have escaped being corrupted by what we egotistically, to distinguish  ourselves from them, call 'civilization'. If our Celtic peasant has  psychical experiences, or if he sees an apparition which he calls one of  the 'good people', that is to say a fairy, it is useless to try to  persuade him that he is under a delusion: unlike his  materialistically-minded lord, he would not attempt nor even desire to  make himself believe that what he has seen he has not seen. Not only has  he the will to believe, but he has the right to believe; because his  belief is not a matter of being educated and reasoning logically, nor a  matter of faith and theology--it is a fact of his own individual  experiences, as he will tell you. Such peasant seers have frequently  argued with me to the effect that 'One does not have to be educated in  order to see fairies'.    Unlike the natural mind of the uncorrupted Celt, Arunta, or American Red  Man, which is ever open to unusual psychical impressions, the mind of  the business man in our great cities tends to be obsessed with business  affairs both during his waking and during his dream states, the  politician's with politics similarly, the society-leader's with society;  and the unwholesome excitement felt by day in the city is apt to be  heightened at night through a satisfying of the feeling which it  morbidly creates for relaxation and change of stimuli. In the slums,  humanity is divorced from Nature under even worse conditions, and  becomes wholly decadent. But in slum and in palace alike there is  continually a feverish nerve-tension induced by unrest and worry; there  is impure and smoke-impregnated air, a lack of sunshine, a substitution  of artificial objects for natural objects, and in place of solitude the  eternal din of traffic. Instead of Nature, men in cities (and  paradoxically some conventionalized men in the country) have  'civilization'--and 'culture'.    Are city-dwellers like these, Nature's unnatural children, who grind out  their lives in an unceasing struggle for wealth and power, social  position, and even for bread, fit to judge Nature's natural children who  believe in fairies? Are they right in not believing in an invisible  world which they cannot conceive, which, if it exists, they--even though  they be scientists--are through environment and temperament alike  incapable of knowing? Or is the country-dwelling, the sometimes  'unpractical' and 'unsuccessful', the dreaming, and 'uncivilized'  peasant right? These questions ought to arouse in the minds of  anthropologists very serious reflection, world-wide in its scope.    At all events, and equally for the unbeliever and for the believer, the  study of the Fairy-Faith is of vast importance historically,  philosophically, religiously, and scientifically. In it lie the germs of  much of our European religions and philosophies, customs, and  institutions. And it is one of the chief keys to unlock the mysteries of  Celtic mythology. We believe that a greater age is coming soon, when all  the ancient mythologies will be carefully studied and interpreted, and  when the mythology of the Celts will be held in very high esteem. But  already an age has come when things purely Celtic have begun to be  studied; and the close observer can see the awakening genius of the  modern Celt manifesting itself in the realm of scholarship, of  literature, and even of art--throughout Continental Europe, especially  France and Germany, throughout Great Britain and Ireland, and throughout  the new Celtic world of America, as far west as San Francisco on the  great calm ocean of the future facing Japan and China. In truth the  Celtic empire is greater than it ever was before Caesar destroyed its  political unity; and its citizens have not forgotten the ancient faith  of their ancestors in a world invisible.    W. Y. E. W.          SECTION I    THE LIVING FAIRY-FAITH          CHAPTER I    ENVIRONMENT         'In the Beauty of the World lies the ultimate redemption of our       mortality. When we shall become at one with nature in a sense       profounder even than the poetic imaginings of most of us, we shall       understand what now we fail to discern.'--FIONA MACLEOD.         Psychical interpretation--The mysticism of Erin and Armorica--In       Ireland--In Scotland--In the Isle of Man--In Wales--In Cornwall--In       Brittany.      As a preliminary to our study it is important, as we shall see later, to  give some attention to the influences and purely natural environment  under which the Fairy-Faith has grown up. And in doing so it will be  apparent to what extent there is truth in the Naturalistic Theory;  though from the first our interpretation of Environment is fundamentally  psychical. In this first chapter, then, in so far as they can be  recorded, we shall record a few impressions, which will, in a way, serve  as introductory to the more definite and detailed consideration of the  Fairy-Faith itself.    Ireland and Brittany, the two extremes of the modern Celtic world, are  for us the most important points from which to take our initial  bearings. Both washed by the waters of the Ocean of Atlantis, the one an  island, the other a peninsula, they have best preserved their old racial  life in its simplicity and beauty, with its high ideals, its mystical  traditions, and its strong spirituality. And, curious though the  statement may appear to some, this preservation of older manners and  traditions does not seem to be due so much to geographical isolation as  to subtle forces so strange and mysterious that to know them they must  be felt; and their nature can only be suggested, for it cannot be  described. Over Erin and Armorica, as over Egypt, there hovers a halo  of romance, of strangeness, of mysticism real and positive; and, if we  mistake not the language of others, these phrases of ours but echo  opinions common to many Celts native of the two countries--they who have  the first right to testify; and not only are there poets and seers among  them, but men of the practical world as well, and men of high rank in  scholarship, in literature, in art, and even in science.      IN IRELAND    If anyone would know Ireland and test these influences--influences which  have been so fundamental in giving to the Fairy-Faith of the past  something more than mere beauty of romance and attractive form, and  something which even to-day, as in the heroic ages, is ever-living and  ever-present in the centres where men of the second-sight say that they  see fairies in that strange state of subjectivity which the peasant  calls Fairyland--let him stand on the Hill of Tara silently and alone at  sunset, in the noonday, in the mist of a dark day. Let him likewise  silently and alone follow the course of the Boyne. Let him enter the  silence of New Grange and of Dowth. Let him muse over the hieroglyphics  of Lough Crew. Let him feel the mystic beauty of Killarney, the  peacefulness of Glendalough, of Monasterboise, of Clonmacnois, and the  isolation of Aranmore. Let him dare to enter the rings of fairies, to  tempt the 'good folk' at their _raths_ and _forts_. Let him rest on the  ancient cairn above the mountain-palace of Finvara and look out across  the battlefields of Moytura. Let him wander amid the fairy dells of  gentle Connemara. Let him behold the Irish Sea from the Heights of  Howth, as Fionn Mac Cumhail used to do. Let him listen to the  ocean-winds amid Dun Aengus. Let him view the stronghold of Cuchulainn  and the Red Branch Knights. Let him linger beside that mysterious lake  which lies embosomed between two prehistoric cairns on the summit of  enchanted Slieve Gullion, where yet dwells invisible the mountain's  Guardian, a fairy woman. Let him then try to interpret the mysticism of  an ancient Irish myth, in order to understand why men have been told  that in the plain beneath this magic mountain of Ireland mighty warfare  was once waged on account of a Bull, by the hosts of Queen Meave against  those of Cuchulainn the hero of Ulster. Let him be lost in the mists on  the top of Ben Bulbin. Let him know the haunts of fairy kings and queens  in Roscommon. Let him follow in the footsteps of Patrick and Bridgit and  Columba. When there are dark days and stormy nights, let him sit beside  a blazing fire of fragrant peat in a peasant's straw-thatched cottage  listening to tales of Ireland's golden age--tales of gods, of heroes, of  ghosts, and of fairy-folk. If he will do these things, he will know  Ireland, and why its people believe in fairies.    As yet, little has been said concerning the effects of clouds, of  natural scenery, of weird and sudden transformations in earth and sky  and air, which play their part in shaping the complete Fairy-Faith of  the Irish; but what we are about to say concerning Scotland will suggest  the same things for Ireland, because the nature of the landscape and the  atmospheric changes are much the same in the two countries, both inland  and on their rock-bound and storm-swept shores.      IN SCOTLAND    In the moorlands between Trossachs and Aberfoyle, a region made famous  by Scott's _Rob Roy_, I have seen atmospheric changes so sudden and so  contrasted as to appear marvellous. What shifting of vapours and clouds,  what flashes of bright sun-gleams, then twilight at midday! Across the  landscape, shadows of black dense fog-banks rush like shadows of flocks  of great birds which darken all the earth. Palpitating fog-banks wrap  themselves around the mountain-tops and then come down like living  things to move across the valleys, sometimes only a few yards above the  traveller's head. And in that country live terrible water-kelpies. When  black clouds discharge their watery burden it is in wind-driven vertical  water-sheets through which the world appears as through an ice-filmed  window-pane. Perhaps in a single day there may be the bluest of heavens  and the clearest air, the"]]]
