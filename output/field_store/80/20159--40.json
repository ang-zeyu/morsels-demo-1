Father married the eldest daughter, Mary  Ann.    Grandfather William Longstreet first applied steam as a motive power, in  1787, to a small boat on the Savannah River at Augusta, and spent all of  his private means upon that idea, asked aid of his friends in Augusta and  elsewhere, had no encouragement, but, on the contrary, ridicule of his  proposition to move a boat without a pulling or other external power, and  especially did they ridicule the thought of expensive steam-boilers to be  made of iron. To obviate costly outlay for this item, he built boilers of  heavy oak timbers and strong iron bands, but the Augusta marines were  incredulous, as the following from the city papers of the times will  indicate:      \"Can you row the boat ashore,        Billy boy, Billy boy;     Can you row the boat ashore,        Gentle Billy?     Can you row the boat ashore,     Without paddle or an oar,        Billy boy?\"    Full of confidence, the inventor thought to appeal to the governor, and  his letter is still preserved in the State archives:        \"AUGUSTA, GEORGIA, September 26, 1790.        \"SIR,--I make no doubt but you have often heard of my steamboat, and      as often heard it laughed at, but in this I have only shared the fate      of other projectors, for it has uniformly been the custom of every      country to ridicule the greatest inventions until they had proved      their utility. In not reducing my scheme to active use it has been      unfortunate for me, I confess, and perhaps the people in general; but,      until very lately, I did not think that artists or material could be      had in the place sufficient. However, necessity, that grand mother of      invention, has furnished me with an idea of perfecting my plan almost      entirely of wooden material, and by such workmen as may be had here;      and, from a thorough confidence of its success, I have presumed to ask      your assistance and patronage. Should it succeed agreeably to my      expectations, I hope I shall discover that sense of duty which such      favors always merit; and should it not succeed, your reward must lay      with other unlucky adventures.        \"For me to mention all of the advantages arising from such a machine      would be tedious, and, indeed, quite unnecessary. Therefore I have      taken the liberty to state, in this plain and humble manner, my wish      and opinion, which I hope you will excuse, and I shall remain, either      with or without your approbation,        \"Your Excellency's most obedient and humble servant,              \"WM. LONGSTREET.        \"GOVERNOR TELFAIR.\"    He failed to secure the necessary aid, and the discovery passed into the  possession of certain New Yorkers, who found the means for practicable  application, and now steam is the goddess that enlightens the world.    My father was a planter. From my early boyhood he conceived that he would  send me to West Point for army service, but in my twelfth year he passed  away during the cholera epidemic at Augusta. Mother moved to North Alabama  with her children, whence in my sixteenth year I made application through  a kinsman, Congressman Reuben Chapman, for appointment as cadet, received  the coveted favor, and entered with the class that was admitted in 1838.    As cadet I had more interest in the school of the soldier, horsemanship,  sword exercise, and the outside game of foot-ball than in the academic  courses. The studies were successfully passed, however, until the third  year, when I failed in mechanics. When I came to the problem of the  pulleys, it seemed to my mind that a soldier could not find use for such  appliances, and the pulleys were passed by. At the January examination I  was called to the blackboard and given the problem of the pulleys. The  drawing from memory of recitation of classmates was good enough, but the  demonstration failed to satisfy the sages of the Academic Board. It was  the custom, however, to give those who failed in the general examination  a second hearing, after all of the classes were examined. This gave me two  days to \"cram\" mechanics, and particularly on pulleys. But the professors  were too wily to introduce them a second time, and took me through a  searching examination of the six months' course. The bridge was safely  passed, however, and mechanics left behind. At the June examination, the  end of the academic year, I was called to demonstrate the pulleys. The  professor thought that I had forgotten my old friend the enemy, but I  smiled, for he had become dear to me,--in waking hours and in dreams,--and  the cadet passed easily enough for a maximum mark.    The cadets had their small joys and sometimes little troubles. On one  occasion a cadet officer reported me for disobedience of orders. As the  report was not true, I denied it and sent up witnesses of the occasion.  Dick Garnett, who fell in the assault of the 3d, at Gettysburg, was one  witness, and Cadet Baker, so handsome and lovable that he was called  Betsy, was the other. Upon overlooking the records I found the report  still there, and went to ask the superintendent if other evidence was  necessary to show that the report was not true. He was satisfied of that,  but said that the officer complained that I smiled contemptuously. As that  could only be rated as a single demerit, I asked the benefit of the smile;  but the report stands to this day, Disobedience of orders and _three_  demerits. The cadet had his revenge, however, for the superintendent was  afterwards known as _The Punster_.    There were sixty-two graduating members of the class of 1842, my number  being sixty. I was assigned to the Fourth United States Infantry as brevet  lieutenant, and found my company with seven others of the regiment at  Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, in the autumn of 1842.    Of the class graduating the year that we entered were G. T. Beauregard and  Irvin McDowell, who, twenty-three years later, commanded the hostile  armies on the plains of Manassas, in Virginia. Braxton Bragg and W. J.  Hardee were of the same class.    The head man of the next class (1839) was I. I. Stevens, who resigned from  the army, and, after being the first governor of Washington Territory,  returned to military service, and fell on the sanguinary field of  Chantilly on the 1st of September, 1862. Next on the class roll was Henry  Wager Halleck, who was commander-in-chief of the United States armies from  July, 1862, to March, 1864. W. T. Sherman and George H. Thomas, of the  Union army, and R. S. Ewell, of the Confederate army, were of the same  class (1840). The class of 1841 had the largest list of officers killed in  action. Irons, Ayers, Ernst, Gantt, Morris, and Burbank were killed in the  Mexican War. N. Lyon, R. S. Garnett, J. F. Reynolds, R. B. Garnett, A. W.  Whipple, J. M. Jones, I. B. Richardson, and J. P. Garesche fell on the  fields of the late war.    Of the class of 1842 few were killed in action, but several rose to  distinguished positions,--Newton, Eustis, Rosecrans, Lovell, Van Dorn,  Pope, Sykes, G. W. Smith, M. L. Smith, R. H. Anderson, L. McLaws, D. H.  Hill, A. P. Stewart, B. S. Alexander, N. J. T. Dana, and others.    But the class next after us (1843) was destined to furnish the man who was  to eclipse all,--to rise to the rank of general, an office made by  Congress to honor his services; who became President of the United States,  and for a second term; who received the salutations of all the powers of  the world in his travels as a private citizen around the earth; of noble,  generous heart, a lovable character, a valued friend,--Ulysses S. Grant.    I was fortunate in the assignment to Jefferson Barracks, for in those days  the young officers were usually sent off among the Indians or as near the  borders as they could find habitable places. In the autumn of 1842 I  reported to the company commander, Captain Bradford R. Alden, a most  exemplary man, who proved a lasting, valued friend. Eight companies of the  Third Infantry were added to the garrison during the spring of 1843, which  made garrison life and society gay for the young people and interesting  for the older classes. All of the troops were recently from service in the  swamps and Everglades of Florida, well prepared to enjoy the change from  the war-dance of the braves to the hospitable city of St. Louis; and the  graceful step of its charming belles became a joy forever.    Of the class of 1843, Ulysses S. Grant joined the Fourth Regiment as  brevet lieutenant, and I had the pleasure to ride with him on our first  visit to Mr. Frederick Dent's home, a few miles from the garrison, where  we first met Miss Julia Dent, the charming woman who, five years later,  became Mrs. Grant. Miss Dent was a frequent visitor at the garrison balls  and hops, where Lieutenant Hoskins, who was something of a tease, would  inquire of her if she could tell where he might find \"the small lieutenant  with the large epaulettes.\"    In May, 1844, all of our pleasures were broken by orders sending both  regiments to Louisiana, near Fort Jessup, where with other troops we were  organized as \"The Army of Observation,\" under General Zachary Taylor.    In March, 1845, I was assigned as lieutenant in the Eighth Regiment, and  joined my company at St. Augustine, Florida. The soldier's life of those  days was not encouraging to those of active aspirations; but influences  were then at work that were beginning to brighten the horizon a little.  The new republic of Texas was seeking annexation with the United States,  which would endanger the peace between them and the republic of Mexico.  Annexation of Texas became the supreme question of the canvass of 1844.  James K. Polk was the nominee of the Democratic and annexation party, and  Henry Clay was on the other side as the Whig nominee. Polk was elected,  and his party prepared to signalize its triumph by annexation as soon as  it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38428"],[0,"Through a Microscope (#5)"],[1,"and  beautiful objects which the microscope reveals. A species common in New  England and the Middle States is known scientifically by the name of  _Carchesium Polypinum_. It is impossible to convey a true idea of its  beauty from a dead black and white drawing. To be appreciated it must be  seen in all its living glory--charming little animals resembling  bell-shaped lilies on the ends of lovely transparent stems.    How curious nature is in the microscopic world! Only think of a tree of  living animals! The stems of the tree are jointed, and the little  creatures can sway the branches about and even throw them into a spiral  coil so as to bring themselves near the main stem. This gives them the  appearance of being very polite toward each other; they bow and courtesy  as if preparing for a grand quadrille, and they are decked out in gay  colors, red, green, and yellow. The margins of the little cups are  fringed with hairs, or _cilia_, which they can put in such rapid motion  that it makes a current in the water and brings little particles to  their mouths which they consume as food. They do not accept everything  that comes in the current. They seem to know what they like as well as  the higher animals, and act as if they were vexed with some of the  particles, rejecting and sending them off with a rapid whirling motion.    The largest of these fairy-like trees are visible to the naked eye, but  it will be necessary for a novice in such matters to use a good strong  lens to be able to find them readily. They are attached to plants  growing in water. I have always been most successful in finding them  among the water-milfoil (_Myriophillum_) several species of which grow  in New England and the Middle States. Some of the species are found in  deep water, others in shallow ponds.    The Bladderworts (_Utricularia_) are also good plants to search among.  They grow in similar places. On either of these plants we shall be sure  to find a good many interesting creatures. If we fail to find the tree,  we may secure other species of vorticella, all of which are very  beautiful.    Do you know the _Utricularia_? I will devote the next chapter to these  curious plants, and to the microscopic animals which they capture.    It will take a little practice to learn where and how to collect  material for the microscope. We should not depend too much upon books in  any branch of natural history. To be successful, you must observe for  yourselves, experiment and examine independently, consulting books that  you may name and classify, that you may recognize and name what you  find. If you fail to find specimens in one spot, try another.    You should not fill your collecting bottles more than two thirds full of  water, nor crowd too many plants in them. These little creatures must  have air in order to live, as well as the higher animals.      [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    The finest tree-vorticellas I ever found were in Florida, in the St.  John's River. These trees were attached to long, floating stems of  _Myriophillum verticillatum_, and were unlike any species that I ever  found at the North. They were very large--in a microscopic  sense--plainly visible to the naked eye, and it took only a moderate  power to bring out their beauty.    _Vorticella nebulifera_ is quite common in swamps and ponds. We find it  attached to a great number of water plants. This species is not built up  in the form of a tree, but it is nevertheless beautiful and graceful.  The delicate, slender stems start from a node, or rounded mass,  sometimes fifty or more of these fairy like creatures in one colony, all  attached to a common centre, swaying about, coiling their delicate  transparent stems, and again uncoiling quick as a flash, apparently  dallying and playing, but never interfering nor becoming entangled one  with another.    The _Stentor_ is another member of the _Vorticellinae_ family. It is one  of the largest of the infusoria, plainly visible to the naked eye, and  one of the most interesting and curious of all the strange animals in  the microscopic world. It assumes various forms. When swimming, it looks  round and plump (_Fig. 2_), and rushes through the water pell-mell,  knocking the smaller animals right and left, always seeming to be in a  great hurry, unless two friendly ones happen to meet, when they  frequently stop and put their heads together a moment as if exchanging  greetings, then away they sail again, dashing through the water,  capturing and devouring the smaller creatures as they go. And now a  couple meet that are very communicative--two gossips, no doubt! At all  events, they put their heads together and conclude to have a good  sociable time.    And they are sensible enough to know that they cannot stand around loose  in the water or public highway. So they select a cosey spot and fasten  their feet to a plant or some firm object, and stretch out their  footstalks sometimes to a great length, making veritable trumpets of  themselves. (_Fig. 3._)    And who knows what grave matters may be settled during these conclaves?  or perhaps they are only rehearsing gossip, as they have had every  possible chance to see what was going on among their neighbors.      [Illustration: THE STENTORS.--\"VERITABLE TRUMPETS.\"]    Sometimes one settles down alone near a group of others, and seems to  proclaim in stentorian voice that it is reception day and he is ready to  receive. Or perhaps he is simply a herald as his name indicates, whose  business it is to conduct ceremonies and regulate affairs! At any rate,  though our ears are too dull to catch the voices of these curious beings  of a lower world--so near, and yet in another sense, so far away, it  would be difficult to believe that these animated creatures have no  means of communication and nothing to communicate.          PART II    THROUGH A MICROSCOPE    BY MARY TREAT      IX.--THE UTRICULARIA.    It seems strange that innocent-looking plants should capture and kill  animals; but this is really what the Bladderworts (_Utricularia_) are  all the time doing. They grow in ponds and swamps, some species in deep,  still water, others in shallow ponds.    Fig. 1 shows a portion of the stem of _Utricularia clandestina_, natural  size. The little bladders are so nearly transparent, that on bringing  them under the microscope, or even under a good lens, you can see the  numerous creatures that they have captured, some partly consumed, others  still alive.    The bladders on these curious plants remind one of some of the  _Entomostracans_ which Mr. Wells described in his fourth paper. Look at  _Chydorus sphericus_ for instance, and then at the magnified bladder  (_Fig. 2_) in this article. The branched horns at the mouth or entrance  have very much the appearance of the antennae of some of the minute  animals, and the stem when it is attached to the main branch may be  likened to a tail. But the way in which they capture and devour the  pretty little creatures that come within their grasp makes them appear,  even more than they look, like wicked animals.      [Illustration: FIG. 1. PORTION OF A STEM OF UTRICULARIA CLANDESTINA;    NATURAL SIZE.]    I have found almost every swimming animalculae with which I am  acquainted, caught in these vegetable traps; and when caught they never  escape. Their entrance is easy enough; there is a sensitive valve at the  mouth of the bladder, which, if they touch it, flies open and draws  them in as quick as a flash. These downward-opening bladders not only  entrap animalculae, but, more wonderful still, the strong larvae of  insects. The larvae most frequently caught are those of the mosquito and  chironomus. Often the mosquito is caught tail first--the entire body  inclosed and the head left sticking out. It always looks as if the  victim might walk or wriggle out, but it never does; and you may be sure  that it never backed in there of its own accord.    You all know how the mosquito larva wriggles in the water, and is known  by the common name of \"wriggler,\" or sometimes inaccurately, \"wiggler.\"  Now just as sure as the tail of this wriggler strikes the mouth of the  bladder, just so sure is he caught--drawn in by some unknown power  quicker than you can speak.    There is yet much to learn about these curious plants. How it is that  the valve or trap can so firmly hold these strong larvae is still a  mystery. I have seen a mosquito larva caught by the head when the first  joint of the body was too large to be admitted through the entrance of  the bladder, and have patiently watched its frantic efforts to escape,  but it was never released. The more it thrashed about, the tighter grew  the fatal trap until death put an end to its struggles.    The chironomus larva is quite unlike that of the mosquito. The  chironomus has brush-like feet which it can withdraw from sight--a sort  of telescopic arrangement--or extend when it wishes to crawl along the  plants, while the mosquito wriggles and swims.    The chironomus is caught more often even than the mosquito larva. At  certain seasons of the year it is almost impossible to find a bladder  without one or more of these victims entrapped.    They feed on the water plants, and seem to have a special liking for the  long-branched antennae which grow at the mouth of the bladders, and, all  unconscious of the trap, on, on they go, their sickle-shaped jaws  cutting the antennae which they eat as they advance, until their heads  reach the mouth of the bladder, when they heedlessly touch the valve and  the trap is sprung and they are drawn within, never more to escape, but  to be slowly devoured.    There is another interesting species of _Utricularia_, the _Purfurea_,  quite different in many particulars from the first. It grows in deep,  still water. The stems are long, sometimes two feet or more in length,  and the branches radiate in every direction, so that one plant often  covers quite a large"]]]
